This distribution represents the final release 5.0 of OntoNotes, an
annotated corpus whose development was supported by the GALE program
of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Contract
No. HR0011-06-C-0022.

Top-level documentation of the release is in the file

  docs/OntoNotes-Release-5.0.pdf

with additional documentation files also found in the docs directory.

The data directory includes files with information on the individual
annotation layers (syntactic structure, propositional structure, word
sense, coreference, and names) for each of the underlying corpus text
files.  That information is also merged into a relation database
ontonotes-v5.0.sql.gz

Included with this release is the package

  OntoNotes DB Tool v0.999 beta

which was used to assemble the database from the original annotation
files.  Found in the directory tools/ontonotes-db-tool-v0.999b, this
tool can also derive various views of the data from the database, and
it provides an API that can implement new queries or views.  Licensing
information for the OntoNotes DB Tool package is included in its
source directory.
