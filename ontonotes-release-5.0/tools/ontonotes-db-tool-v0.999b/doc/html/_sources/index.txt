Ontonotes DB Tool |release|
---------------------------

This document describes the installation and basic uses of the
OntoNotes Database Tool (DB Tool).  It shows how to build the
OntoNotes database from the individual source files and describes the
design of the database tables, as well as parts of the API that can be
used to manipulate the data.  It also provides some documentation on
the core API.  This documentation is by no means comprehensive, but
will get more so, with future releases of the tool.
