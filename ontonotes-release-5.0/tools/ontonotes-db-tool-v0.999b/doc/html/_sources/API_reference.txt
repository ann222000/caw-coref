API Reference
-------------

There are three top level divisions of the API.  The first,
:mod:`tools` contains simple tools for anticipated tasks such as
loading data to the database.  These tools are also designed to
function as sample code for using the API.  The second is a
:mod:`common` module that holds utilities used by all the code.  The
final is the largest and most complex, the :mod:`corpora` module.  It
holds all the routines for dealing with individual banks: building
them from files or the database, aligning them with each other,
writing to files or the database, and querying the python objects
about their contents.
