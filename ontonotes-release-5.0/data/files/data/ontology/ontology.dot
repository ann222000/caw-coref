      This class represents all abstract conceptualizations of every other concept\. Being red, to cook, and table, for example, are respectively a quality, event, and object, but one can consider the abstract notion of being red, or of cooking, or of 'tablehood', as individual separate entities of discussion, apart from their 'normal' presence in experience\. These abstract conceptualizations are represented here\. 'Poverty' provides a clear example: Being poor is a state (hence a Quality), but Poverty, as an abstract conception, is a Conceptualization\.

Note that almost every Artifact was created for a purpose, and hence will have a FunctionOf\. But for any given Artifact, only create the FunctionOf operator if the function is an explicit part of the definition and seems 'necessary' to the essence of the artifact\. Usually, all Artifacts will have a FunctionOf, since artifacts tend to be built for a reason\. Sometimes, something else may function as an artifact -- thus a stick may function as a rod -- but generally we care about the function, not the physical entity\.

  Commentary:     Represents all changes of essential (definitional) properties of entities\.  Essential properties are those aspects of an entity that when altered necessitate one to no longer identify the result as the 'same' entity\.  Since entities may be changed in some 'essential' aspects but remain unchanged in others, this is generally a problematic area\.  For example, a glass may be smashed, losing its shape and functionality, but the shards are still the same material and nothing else\.  Here its topological and functional properties, which are generally essential, have changed, but its material one has not\.  We include here all events that entail a change to any essential property of the classes Material (constituent matter), Topological (shape), Functional (usage), and Morphological (members or parts)\.

      The relations that in general relate Objects and Events to Events; typically, the Case Roles (such as Agent, Patient, Beneficiary, Instrument), but also the relations specifying circumstantial information (such as Location, Time, Duration) and pragmatic information (such as speechact, modality), etc\. (To represent the actual location/position itself, use the concept SpatialLocation, and to represent the time itself, use Time or EventAsTime\.) EventRoles are rather technical things that come from Logic, Philosophy, and Linguistics\. (The idea is that every event/action you can talk about takes a so-called Patient -- that which is changed (or not changed), and may take an Agent (or CoAgents, as when people get married), an Instrument, etc\.) Similarly, for objects, physical things have Weight and Age and Mass and Color and so on (the PhyicalObjectRelations), and nonphysical things may have Provenance (= source) and other qualities, depending on the nature of the object\. Often, English uses the same word to describe both the relation and the filler: thus when you say <quote>weight<quote>, are you talking about the relationship between John and 160 lbs, or about the notion of 160 lbs itself? A good example is provided by the word <quote>source<quote>, which is a relation of this kind\. It points from something to its source (be that a person (as in <quote>he is the source of that idea<quote>), a location (as in <quote>the river's source is the X mountains<quote>), an organization (as in <quote>the government is the source of all our funding<quote>), etc\. If one focuses on Source as the filler, not the relation, it can be almost anything!

      Since many professions are held by humans, many examples of the concept Profession (all Humans that have the relation RoleOf to Profession) can be gathered together under RoleOf\*Human, which is placed immediately below Profession\.

      This concept represents the mental states of an individual (not a society as a whole) that are neither a (typically clinical) psychological condition (like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) nor an emotion\. (Emotion is a subtype of MentalState\.) Typically, MentalStates that are not emotions have longer duration, and can be thought of as habits or traits, such as excitability, placidity, etc\., or conditions, such as being focused\. Other possible examples are interest (as in: showing interest in), calmness, and the mental state of being glad that a certain politician did not win an election\. Some people feel these are in fact emotions, and should classify such concepts under Emotion instead\. So ultimately this may be an empty concept, in which case we will remove it\.

      A generalization to capture various kinds of mental objects, like thoughts, beliefs, goals, etc\., that are employed in the mental activities of people (and other thinkers)\. Not emotions or mental states\. Used mostly as an organizer concept, and hence will generally not be chosen during coding, but we include it in case there are mental states/objects that don't fit the other categories\. There are two direct subclasses: ImaginaryObject and NonImaginaryThoughtObject\.

      The RoleOf operator is used to specify the role a concept plays in the world\. In most cases it is secondary to the concept's primary (ISA) nature; for example, a Teacher is a Human and a Teacher has the RoleOf Profession\. Using this operator helps one distinguish between the person or object fulfilling or playing the role and the role/position itself\. Notice the difference between <quote>the Judge is an important person in the village<quote> and <quote>the judge was taken ill last night<quote>; the profession cannot be taken ill\. There generally exists a shishkebob relation between the two: for any instance of a Profession it is reasonable to talk about the person exercising that profession, and for any instance of a Role it is reasonable to talk about the profession that the Role embodies\. Other important RoleOf concepts are the notions of Choice and Substitute, where one is not considering the thing that is the choice or the substitute, but the relation (being a choice or a substitute) itself\.

Generally, SetOf codes for things that are multiples of the same thing in a set (in contrast to PartOf, which codes for things that are not identical (though some of them might be, like wheels on a car))\. What exactly is 'the same thing' is a bit tricky sometimes: Audience is a SetOf Persons (even they are obviously not all identical)\. Generally, PartOf points to the larger thing (e\.g\., Engine to Car), while SetOf points from the larger thing (e\.g\., Audience to Person)\.

The notion of Payment is a good example\. Regardless of whether one looks at payment as the actual stuff (money, clam shells, whatever), or as an abstract placeholder for the stuff (a check, an IOU), or as an abstraction complete not tied to any stuff (<quote>he'll get his payment one day<quote>), it is intrinsically about something of value, and hence a WealthAbstraction\.

      A placeholder that collects all entities that (in English) are Object-like expressions of Events, such as Explosion, Protection, Decoration, etc\. If in the definition of the concept you can insert <quote>the event of\.\.\.<quote>, then almost certainly you are dealing with an EventAsObject\. In contrast to ProcedureAbstraction, which refers to a (usually organized) sequence of steps or a regularized procedure, this concept is usually considered unitary/atomic\. EventAsObjects can be seen as Events since they take eventive participants like agents, patients, and instruments\. Typically, also, this concept is the filler of a FunctionOf operator: the function of a knife is &lt; to make &gt; a cut; the function of a house is &lt; to provide &gt; shelter; both the cut and shelter are EventAsObjects, since they can take participant roles\. When concepts are defined here, links to their Event equivalents will be inserted later\.

Parts of Artifacts: all artifacts that present themselves primarily as parts rather than as things that we use for themselves\. If a thing can be part of something else, but is not always (or almost always), then it should not be considered a part of; only use PartOf if the thing seems odd or nonsensical unless you think of it in context as part of something else\. For example: Cover, Attachment, Foundation, and maybe even Handle\. (BodyPart is automatically already Part\*Of something\.) An example is the brake of a car, which is an artifact by itself of course &lt; Brake ISA Artifact &gt;, but is also part of a car\. Since such parts are generally Artifacts themselves as well, we have also &lt; Brake PartOf Artifact &gt; (the latter can be written also as &lt; Brake ISA PartOf\*Artifact &gt;\.

      (Reified relation complex of Artifact and SetOf\.) This is a convenient shorthand method of gathering all concepts that have the relation SetOf to Artifact\. In general, if something always (or almost always) is a set of things, by its very nature, then use SetOf\. Examples: a DinnerService (of cutlery), a Colony (of ants), an Organization (though it's not necessary to code SetOf\*Person for Organizations, because that's already been handled using a shishkebob link)\. The concept ShopWindowDisplay, for example, is principally a Display (which is a subtype of EventAsObject), but it is simultaneously a collection of artifacts: &lt; ShopWindowDisplay ISA Display &gt; and &lt; ShopWindowDisplay SetOf Artifact &gt;\. (This latter expression can also be thought of as &lt; ShopWindowDisplay ISA SetOf\*Artifact &gt;, which is useful since many artifacts are collected in sets\.) Another example: a set of plates to make a dinner service\.

      Any time (point or period)\. Examples are: year, 1989, interregnum\. More elaborated theories of time can be inserted at this concept\. (Since many events can be treated as Timepoints, Event is shishkebobbed with EventAsTime, which is a subconcept of Time\. Hence there is no need to link events that are specifically seen as time referents to this concept; they can simply be linked to EventAsTime\.)

      Operators are an unusual type of relation\. Their function is to provide an Object with an additional aspect that is also important to its core essence or definition\. Often, Object concepts belong primarily to one class, but highlight a specific additional one; for example, a Teacher is in essence a Human but has the role of Educator, which is a kind of Profession (defined under IndividualRole)\. To provide this secondary information, the Role-of operator is used: &lt; Teacher ISA Human &gt; and &lt; Teacher RoleOf Profession &gt; (the latter we can also write as &lt; Teacher ISA RoleOf\*Profession &gt;)\. Similarly, a Hand is a NonVolitionalBiologicalObject and is also a BodyPart (using the Part-of operator), every SportsTeam is a SportsOrganization but is also a set of Humans (using the Set-of operator), and every Building is an Artifact but is also a SpatialLocation (using the Location-of operator)\. Information may be inherited down some operators (RoleOf, FunctionOf) but not others (PartOf, LocationOf)\.

      All the relations among concepts: EventRoles (such as agent, patient, instrument) in general relate objects and events to events; ObjectRelations (such as color, weight, age) in general relate Qualities to Objects; and Operators (SetOf, FunctionOf, PartOf) provide a particularly salient additional aspect of Objects\. This class is a rather abstract one and of interest mainly to people specializing in creating formal (logical or linguistic) representations of the world\.

      (Reified relation complex of Artifact and FunctionOf\.) This concept gathers all the functions of Artifacts, insofar as they are all events or activities\. The function of Food, for example, is nourishment, and a cutting activity is the FunctionOf a Knife\. Since Artifacts are made for a purpose, they almost always can have a FunctionOf relation to some purpose\. So it is not necessary to code FunctionOf\*Artifact for every artifact: when ontologizing, please use the FunctionOf operator sparingly, namely only if the artifact is itself the function of something, or if the function appears centrally in the definition of the artifact and seems very necessary for its 'essence'\.

      The Operator PartOf relates a concept to that which it is a part of, allowing one to provide additional definitional information about the concept\. For example, a chicken leg (a Drumstick) is meat (i\.e\., a NonVolitionalBiologicalObject), but it is a part of a chicken, (and at the same time has the function of Food): &lt; Drumstick ISA Meat &gt; and &lt; Drumstick PartOf Chicken &gt; and &lt; Drumstick FunctionOf Food &gt; (the last two can also be written respectively as &lt; Drumstick ISA PartOf\*Chicken &gt; and &lt; Drumstick FunctionOf\*Food &gt;)\. These three perspectives (essential, structural, and functional) are a typically shishkebob of physical objects\. Information may not be inherited down a PartOf link\. PartOf contrasts with the Operator SetOf, which relates a collection to its individual members: generally, SetOf codes for things that are multiples of the same thing in a set (in contrast to PartOf, which codes for things that are not identical (though some of them might be, like wheels on a car))\. What exactly is 'the same thing' is a bit tricky sometimes: Audience is a SetOf Persons (even they are obviously not all identical)\. PartOf points to the larger thing (e\.g\., Engine to Car), while SetOf points from the larger thing (e\.g\., Audience to Person)\.

      The first dimension of differentiation of Eventualities (parallel to the second, Eventuality2, which will be folded together with this one later)\. Eventuality1 focuses on different aspects of how events express a change (or no change) in the world\. Either one state is changed by the process of the event into another, or the 'event' expresses a constant, or apparently constant, state in the world\. The overall structure of this dimension of differentiation is as follows: If the state of the world changes perceptibly: Achievement: If the focus of the concept is on the (more or less instantaneous) change of the state\. Examples: winning a race, tripping\. Accomplishment: If the focus is not only on the state change, but also on the preceding process that led up to it\. Examples: completing a crossword puzzle, building (and completing) a house\. If not: Process: If there is a constantly running process (though there may not be a perceptible change of state, the energy is consumed to maintain the process, which of course does cause some state to change)\. Examples: an engine constantly running, a stream constantly flowing\. State: If there is no constantly running process\. Example: a statue standing in a park\. This analysis is consistent with Vendler's classic work\.

      Profession represents the position an individual might fulfill, and is pointed to using the RoleOf operator\. One sense of the entity in question is always a human, but another sense might be the Profession; sometimes the senses have been collapsed (not ideal) and then the entity is both a Human and a Profession\. For example, a Judge ISA Human and a Judge's RoleOf is Profession\. This allows one to represent the difference between <quote>the Judge is an important person in the village<quote> and <quote>the judge was taken ill last night<quote>; the profession cannot be taken ill\. There generally exists a shishkebob relation between the two: for any instance of a Profession it is reasonable to talk about the person exercising that profession, and for any instance of a Role it is reasonable to talk about the profession that the Role embodies\. (In addition, Profession has a shishkebob relation with DisciplineStudyAbstraction; for any instance of a Profession it is reasonable to talk about the discipline (namely, Law)\.) Since many professions are held by humans, many examples of the concept Profession (all Humans that have the relation RoleOf to Profession) can be gathered together under RoleOf\*Human, which is placed immediately below Profession\. The concept Teacher, for example, is principally a Human, but it is simultaneously a profession: &lt; Teacher ISA Human &gt; and &lt; Teacher RoleOf Profession &gt; (another way to think of this is that human professions point to Profession via the RoleOf operator: &lt; Teacher ISA RoleOf\*Human &gt;)\. RoleOf\*Human includes all examples of this role together with those of NonProfessionRole and KinshipRole\.

      Physical objects that are intentionally made\. Almost all Artifacts are made by humans, but beaver dams and spider webs seem so purposeful that they are included as well\. Since artifacts are made for a purpose, they almost always have a FunctionOf relation to some purpose\. So it is not necessary to select FunctionOf\*Artifact for every artifact; when ontologizing, please use the FunctionOf operator sparingly, namely only if the artifact is itself the function of something else, or if the function appears centrally in the definition of the artifact and seems very necessary for its 'essence'\. For example, a Drone (the aircraft) can be considered a FunctionOf an Aircraft, since you could have two different aircraft, only one of which is going to be a drone, and not even all the time necessarily\. So, in general use FunctionOf for something that performs a duty/function that it doesn't have to perform (like Drone), but not for something that simply serves the purpose it's supposed to serve (like a Column)\. Another example is given by Newspaper, which contrasts with a SheetOfPaper in that the Newspaper has a function (its FunctionOf relation points to InformationObject) while a SheetOfPaper in general has no specific function\. In addition to having functions, Artifacts are often parts of things (and hence can be the fillers of the PartOf role), are often collections of things (hence the fillers of the SetOf role), and since artifacts are tangible, they have a shishkebob relation with SpatialLocation (that is, for any instance of an Artifact, it is generally reasonable to refer to the artifact and mean its location) and are hence often the fillers of the LocationOf role\. Some Artifacts (for example, Buildings) are also shishkebobbed with Organization (so if the artifact is a building belonging to an Organization, it is reasonable to refer to the artifact and mean the organization itself)\.

      Intangible objects that are not measurable (abstractions in the physical or social worlds such as space, time, energy, wealth, etc\.), and are also neither mental objects (thoughts and psychological/mental states), relations (among events and objects and qualities), nor collections (except for purely mathematical collections such as sets)\. This class has 2 direct children: AbstractObject and SupernaturalBeing\. AbstractObject has 2 direct children: InformationObject (procedures, language, disciplines of study, mathematical concepts, etc\.) and EventAsObject, namely all the 'objects' that are in fact events (such as Explosion, Bid (as in an offer), etc\.) and are recognized by having participant (event) roles like agents, patients, instruments, etc\.

The principal subtypes are information objects (names, procedures, etc\.), abstractions of wealth, shape and structure, EventAsObject (those terms that are actually events but masquerade in English as objects (nouns), recognizable by having participant roles such as agent and instrument, and QualityAsObject (those terms that are actually capabilities or attributes but seem to be object and are expressed in English by nouns)\.

      SocialCollections that come about through genetic familial/kin relationships among people and animals\. Typically, members are in a FamilyGroup involuntarily, by birth, but in some cases can join it, by marriage, persistent association, etc\. These collections exhibit some degree of internal organization (with some members fulfilling roles) and tend to persist over time\. Examples include families, tribes, colonies of bees or ants, herds of cows, warrens of rabbits\. This category thus does not include Boy Scouts, philanthropic and/or fraternal groups (like the Elks and Rosicrucians), etc\., since there's no necessary genetic kinship involved\. Even (or especially) with bees and ants and even Mafia, relatedness is an important factor in admittance\. In addition, some FamilyGroups are simultaneously also CommercialOrganizations (like the Mafia) or PoliticoGovernmentOrganizations (like the royal houses of the middle ages)\. Note that its definition seems to allow countries as well\. But if <quote>USA<quote> or <quote>France<quote> are defined as a nation-state they should be under PoliticalOrganization more so than under FamilyGroup, since the idea of nations has strong ties to a centralized government\. However, if the term was <quote>American<quote> or <quote>Russian<quote>, one would be more inclined to code it as FamilyGroup, since it implies more of a citizenship status that one can join\. With respect to Citizenship and Ethnicity: members of a tribe know how the various members of the tribe are related\. This often affects marriage taboos, etc\. In contrast, Citizenship is defined by political boundaries\. It is quite common for members of a family to be citizens of different countries\. Ethnicity is based on a common cultural heritage\. Consider the wide range of countries WASPs originated from\. Therefore we consider Ethnicity to be a SocialAbstraction\.

      (The reified relation complex of Artifact and LocationOf\.) Since many artifacts are immovable, they are often conceptualized and referred to as locations: cities, buildings, monuments, etc\. This concept gathers their locational readings\. Thus &lt; City ISA Artifact &gt; and &lt; City LocationOf SpatialLocation &gt; (the latter can also be written as &lt; City ISA LocationOf\*Artifact &gt;)\. Here it's preferable to be somewhat conservative: only use LocationOf if you feel quite strongly that the artifact serves as a location in general (like a Park), not if it could do so (like a Treehouse)\.
