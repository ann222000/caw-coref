Selenium

Important Health Benefits from an Overlooked Trace Mineral By Julius G.
Goepp, MD

When was the last time your doctor suggested that you supplement with
selenium in an effort to prevent cancer? Scientists now know that this trace
mineral has extraordinary value in fighting various cancers and other
conditions involving oxidative stress and inflammation.1,2

Doctors assume that we get enough selenium through plant foods.
Unfortunately, in many places in America and the rest of the world,
including China and Russia, the soil is badly depleted of its selenium
content because of acid rain, which can dramatically change the chemical
composition of the soil. As a result, soil acidification alters of the
ability of the soil to bind with vital elements such as selenium for
assimilation into edible plants.

Selenium's Unique Biochemical Properties
What makes selenium unique? While scientists are still elucidating selenium's
role in a multitude of biochemical processes, one of its chief attributes is
serving as a component of specific proteins called selenoproteins. Almost
all of these proteins are active in the defense against reactive oxygen
species (free radicals), which fuel numerous diseases and the aging process
itself through their damaging effects on DNA and proteins.

Selenoproteins and their antioxidant products scavenge cell-damaging free
radicals. Selenium is the only mineral nutrient that has its own DNA code,
which instructs the body's protein-synthesis &quot;machinery&quot; to incorporate
selenium into its host proteins. Scientists interpret this unique attribute
as evidence of selenium's fundamental importance to virtually all living
things on Earth.3

Selenium is available from many dietary sources, including garlic, Brazil
nuts, and certain vegetables; however, the amount of bioavailable selenium
from these sources varies tremendously, depending on the soil and weather
conditions where the plants are grown.4 Foods containing selenium may also
contain substances that limit selenium's bioavailability.5 Therefore,
selenium supplementation is often recommended as a way to assure a
dependable, bioavailable supply of this nutrient.6

Selenium deficiency is increasingly associated with adverse health
conditions and even life-threatening diseases. People who live in
selenium-poor regions of the world suffer from dramatically increased rates
of cancer, infections, and inflammatory diseases.1,7-9 Fortunately, many of
these conditions can be prevented and even reversed with selenium
supplementation.10-13 In this article, we will examine how oxidative stress
can increase our vulnerability to inflammation, infection, cancer, and
cardiovascular disease, and how selenium and the selenoproteins work to
counteract oxidative stress, even in people without overt selenium
deficiency.

Selenium Protects Against Oxidative Stress
Scientists now generally recognize that most disease processes produce their
effects through chemically reactive molecules known as free radicals. Free
radicals are composed mostly of reactive oxygen and nitrogen compounds.
These reactive oxygen species initiate a destructive cycle fueled in part by
the body's own defense mechanisms. They disrupt the normal structure of
proteins and the genetic information encoded in DNA. This damage always
results in the release of potent chemical messengers called cytokines.
Cytokines trigger the inflammatory response in tissues, signaling immune and
inflammatory cells to swarm the affected area.

This inflammatory reaction activates powerful factors deep within cell
nuclei-such as nuclear factor-kappa beta (NFkB). These factors &quot;translate&quot;
infection and inflammation into the uncontrolled cell replication that
produces cancer.14 Strong evidence also suggests that NFkB and related
compounds are involved in the conversion of oxidative damage, stress, and
inflammation into the stimuli that produce atherosclerosis and
cardiovascular disease.15

Selenium not only scavenges reactive oxygen species before these free
radicals can damage cells, but also regulates nuclear factor activities deep
within the cells themselves.16 For this reason, scientists now call selenium
&quot;one of the most promising agents&quot; for the prevention and control of
cancer.17

Laboratory evidence also supports selenium's role in protecting cardiac
muscle from the effects of reduced blood flow, or ischemia.18 Under the
extreme oxidative stress triggered by a severe infection, selenium has been
shown to enhance the protective ability of intracellular antioxidant systems
that use glutathione.19 Moreover, selenium specifically inhibits the
activation of NFkB, which in turn inhibits the release of inflammatory
cytokines. In fact, in laboratory studies, a reduction of selenium has been
shown to increase levels of these inflammatory molecules.20 Research also
shows that by reducing NFkB activity, selenium prevents the activation of
inflammatory cells that contribute to vascular disease in type II
diabetes.21

These laboratory findings underscore selenium's promise in preventing and
treating a wide array of human diseases, while reducing the cumulative
oxidative damage that underlies many of the deleterious changes associated
with aging.22

Selenium Combats Inflammatory and Infectious Diseases
The recognition of selenium's ability to prevent oxidative damage has fueled
research into how selenium influences various chronic inflammatory
conditions. For example, in a study of 70 patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, selenium concentrations were found to be significantly lower than
in a healthy population. When the subjects were given selenium or placebo
for three months, the selenium-supplemented group showed fewer tender or
swollen joints and less morning stiffness than did the control group. The
supplemented patients also required less cortisone and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) than did the controls, and demonstrated a
reduction in laboratory indicators of inflammation. No side effects of
selenium supplementation were noted.23

Selenium has shown great promise in the treatment of autoimmune thyroiditis
as well.24 In a recent study, 48 patients with elevated levels of an
antibody to thyroid enzymes were given selenium daily for three months,
while 40 patients received placebo. Serum levels of the antibody dropped
significantly in the supplemented group compared to the placebo group,
demonstrating that selenium suppressed the autoimmune attack on these
patients' thyroid glands.25 Similar reductions in measures of autoimmune
inflammatory response have been shown in other studies of selenium alone or
in combination with other antioxidants.26-28

Many other autoimmune conditions are associated with low selenium levels,
including autoimmune hepatitis and diabetes.29-32 Preliminary trials have
demonstrated a protective effect of selenium supplementation against both
hepatitis C and alcoholic hepatitis; both conditions involve a substantial
inflammatory component that is thought to be mitigated by the actions of
selenoproteins.33,34

FOUR DIFFERENT FORMS OF SELENIUM
Selenium is available in a number of different forms for supplementation,
and each has slightly different uses and benefits. Ideally, a good
supplement should contain all four of the following forms of selenium for
broad-spectrum protection.

In the form of the salt, sodium selenite, selenium has been used to reduce
post-operative swelling that is related to the increased free radical
stresses produced by surgery.69 Related beneficial effects are seen when
sodium selenite is used to protect against radiation treatment-induced
swelling and inflammation.70,71 Sodium selenite has also demonstrated
dramatic immune-boosting function in patients with borderline low selenium
status.72
The natural metabolite of selenium, selenodiglutathione, contains a selenium
ion bonded to two molecules of the potent antioxidant glutathione. This
compound appears to be heavily involved in the cancer chemoprotective
effects of selenium,73-76 as demonstrated by its ability to stimulate
apoptosis, the programmed cell death the body uses to purge itself of
incipient cancers.77,78
The selenium-containing amino acid, L-selenomethionine, is an essential
component of the selenoproteins involved in controlling autoimmune
diseases.79 It is also selectively accumulated in prostate tissue, where it
has been shown to have cancer-fighting activity.80 As a component of an
&quot;antioxidant cocktail,&quot; L-selenomethionine can increase brain blood flow and
scores on psychological testing in elderly people.81
Another selenium-containing amino acid complex, Se-methylselenocysteine, has
especially great potential in the treatment of established cancers,82 where
it has been shown to radically enhance the effects of traditional
chemotherapy drugs while protecting against their toxicity.83 In one study,
drug treatment alone was curative in only 30% of animals bearing human
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck; that rate rose to 100% with
the addition of methylselenocysteine.84

Severe infection imposes some of the most concentrated oxidative stress of
all human diseases. Selenium has shown important benefits for those with
septic shock, one of the most troubling killers of people with infections,
compromised immune systems, or those confined to the hospital. Now known as
systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or SIRS, overwhelming infection
leads to runaway release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators,
ultimately causing a dramatic failure of multiple organs and bodily
systems.19 This condition, formerly known as &quot;septic shock,&quot; has yielded
dramatically to the inclusion of selenium in treatment protocols, as
evidenced by two remarkable studies published in 1999.

The reason why you see a &quot;beneficial&quot; study followed by a
&quot;pathological&quot; one is that the scientists are more interested in
&quot;correlations&quot; than understanding the issue in a comprehensive way.  I
encountered this while trying to &quot;cure&quot; my &quot;illness&quot; (which befuddled
several doctors).  For instance, the severe osteoporosis I had was not
helped by the calcium I took because it was calcium carbonate, and I
had so little stomach acid that not enough was being absorbed.  Within
a couple of months of taking calcium citrate, I noticed my lower back
pain was gone.  I created my free web site as a place where those who
want to understand the evidence in a comprehensive way can read my
conclusions, look at the evidence, and ask me questions or make
relevant points.  Scientists should realize that if there is strong
evidence against a claim that is indisputable, then it must be false.
For example, the raw demographic data demonstrates beyond any doubt
that arguments against saturated fatty acids (in the CHD context) are
simply impossible, but they do not, and are still making the same
ludicrous &quot;saturated fat causes heart disease&quot; claims.  If scientists
don't know how to reason in the most basic of ways, there will always
be new &quot;studies&quot; that are obviously ridiculous to those who have done
the research and understand the overall situation.
