Arsen Wenger was accused this week of being Obsessed with Chelsea to
the point where his interest was described as voyeuristic by Jose
Mourinho.

You know i felt this was very similar to a certain Council Official who
seems obsessed by our identity,paranoid about leaks and bang out of
order wasting Council time on hounding us down.

I am currently compiling a 25 page dossier on said official!!!

Its the small amount of dissent that they are trying to obliterate all
traces of.
They do not really care who or what you are.
They know there really is not anyone who disagrees with them because
Mrs Claridge and Mr Atkinson have repeatedly told them all so.
