Vast campuses of shining white buildings stand empty like abandoned
temples of technology waiting for new throngs of believers. Their
mirror-glass windows reflect immaculate lawns and fountain, surrounded
by vacant parking lots. Click on image to enlarge These buildings and
grounds are so beautiful and so carefully maintained that I felt like a
visitor to an ancient site. Although these are modern buildings, the
intense blue sky and the white structures even brought to mind the
Temple of Poseidon at Sounion.

I am indebted to a security guard named Olga for the opportunity to
take pictures of this campus. After challenging me as to why I was
there, she allowed me to take pictures and even suggested viewpoints
that showed off the surging fountains at the entrance. After shooting
pictures, I spent a few moments absorbing the emotions and mental images
that still pervade this site. I do not know what company filled these
buildings and imbued them with life, but it must have been a fast and
furious time.

Unlike the abandoned factories of my native New England, whose broken
windows and grimy walls still ring with echos of sadness and failure,
these grounds still reverberate with with excitement and conflict, like
a elaborately staged, but flawed, performance that folded after the
first reviews came in.

There are many more empty buildings scattered across this valley. Let
us hope that a new wave of opportunity washes through here and fills
these abandoned structures with purpose and excitement again. The
analogy of corporate office buildings being temples is just absolutely
awesome. This post and the previous ones are outstanding. I'm really
enjoying reading your perspective on things.

If you're still going to be around this weekend, we'd love to see you
up in Boulder Creek. You certainly picked a great week for weather!

The comparison of the faded grandeur of the supernova that was the
dot.com era, with the glory that was the ancient world, is one more
reason why David's blog is a treat for us all. These posts are
fantastic.

Thanks for the feedback! We would love to visit Boulder Creek, but
will have to hold that until the next visit. I have several more posts
that are being held up because I cannot get my laptop on the internet at
my current location. Please check back on Tuesday for more posts on the
state of the Valley and its inhabitants.

Oddly enough, there are MANY brand new buildings that have NEVER been
occupied in various parts of San Diego. For years. So...naturally, they
continue to build more instead of less.

Joanie, How interesting. That seems very much like a modern day cargo
cult. "Wealth came from many people working in new buildings..It is now
gone...Must build new buildings to bring people and money back." The
Melanesian cargo cults were an interesting phenomenon and merit
investigation. http://www.afa.org/magazine/1991/0191cargo.asp
