Part 1
Please see part 0 (template) for warnings and summary.

Inroads.

Disclaimer: Guess what? They're mine!!! Yup, honest. Wait... you don't believe
me? Damn.

Comments: 1) This chapter was originally going to be called 'Reclamation', but
then the exposition fairy came and got exposition dust over *everything*. The
next chapter shall be chock full of action and fun and deserving of the title
'Reclamation', honest.

2) The twins and I want to thank Thatweirdgirl for giving them an identity.

3) Why is it that the majority of the male characters want to up the (not for a
while, but soon R/K) slash content of this fic? It's just not right, I tell
you.

She was dragged out of bed before she could wake up fully, before she could
take stock of her surroundings. The hands that held her and pushed her down the
dark hallway were none too gentle. Before she knew it, Kaylee found herself
alone in a room with nothing but a flat screen taking up a whole wall.

&quot;Look,&quot; a voice sneered over an unseen speaker. &quot;it's your friend.&quot;

Sure enough, Kaylee found herself looking at River breaking into a building. By
the white walls, she guessed it was this very one. Her eyes could not leave the
screen as she watched River stop and have an argument with herself, the terror
plain on her face as she collapsed to the ground. Her heart seized with fear as
she saw the figure on the screen pull herself up and begin to walk away. They
were too calm in showing her this footage.

&quot;Don't worry about River Tam.&quot; Kaylee looked at the walls, trying to find the
source of the voice. &quot;She got what she came for and she has left already.&quot;

She couldn't understand what the voice was talking about until she looked back
at the screen, at the figure of River helping a man down a different corridor.
The same man who had sat with her without really being there.

&quot;That's not...&quot;

Kaylee wanted to say that it was old footage, that if River had come anywhere
near here then she would already be free, but she couldn't. A small recess in
the back of her mind had already recognized the pants River was wearing as a
pair donated to her by Inara.

&quot;Looks like you're not her top priority.&quot; The voice waited for that to sink in.
&quot;But she's still ours. That boy was valuable to us.&quot;

River was helping him up the stairs, Kaylee couldn't take her eyes off the
screen.

&quot;She's taken almost everything we need, but she's left us with you. And we can
work with you. River didn't tell you what we need, did she?&quot;

Without thinking about it, her head was shaking of it's own volition. Her eyes
were watching the figure of a security guard walking blindly into River's path.

&quot;You are healthy, Miss Frye, and we thank you for taking care of yourself well.
It will make it easier to take what we want from you, many times if we need
it.&quot; At this, Kaylee took her eyes off the screen and looked around again.
&quot;What we could never take from River or any of the children here.&quot;

Movement out of the corner of her eye made her turn and she was just in time to
see River deliver a high kick to the security guard and render him unconscious.

&quot;You should know that River knows exactly what we want, what we will do, and
yet she left you here.&quot;

There were no other guards that Kaylee could see, nothing that impeded River's
progress back out of the building.

&quot;Don't think the children will help you, either. Their loyalty to you is
connected with their quickly fading loyalty to River. She has left them to our
mercy a second time. And we have very little mercy to give.&quot;

Nothing to stop River leaving. Nothing to stop her coming back for another
person either.

&quot;They do not know why you're here. They never knew what River knew, what Jonah
knew.&quot;

Kaylee froze at the name. She looked more closely at the screen, at the man
that River held easily. River had told her he was dead.

&quot;Last night will be nothing, Miss Frye, if you do not do all that we ask. We
won't hurt you, your body is ours now and we need it, your current injuries
notwithstanding, but we will hurt the children, every one of them.&quot;

Her blood ran cold.

&quot;One by one.&quot;

The sound of Alexandria's screams still rang in her head.

&quot;Until you beg to obey us.&quot;

She looked once more to the screen, to the sight of River easily slipping out
of the building with Jonah.

&quot;It's up to you.&quot;

***

He woke on a slender bed, tucked in against a wall. The whiteness of it could
only mean one thing: a medical bay. The grittiness of it could only mean one
thing: he was out. IV lines snaked into his arms, but he felt clearer,
stronger. His memories of the night before were vague. They must have hydrated
him, pumped him full of energy boosters. Jonah felt her crouched by his feet, a
small hand dancing fingers up and down his ankle like a spider.

He recognized the man that hovered over the unconscious form in the middle of
the room. He had never met him in person, but Jonah would know Simon Tam
anywhere. The name held a sting in his head that he had forgotten. River's all
powerful brother, perfection personified, the one who must be talked about a
million times a day. He had finally done what River had known he could do, he'd
gotten her out. Jonah could feel the fear and horror in him. He was terrified
and sickened by what River had done, the doctor in him could not understand it.

Jonah spared no thought for the man on the bed.

&quot;River.&quot;

His voice was warm for her. He looked across and watched as her eyes flew up to
him, unfocused and scared. It brought a frown to his face and he tried to reach
her thoughts.

&quot;Six months.&quot; She whispered nervously. &quot;Jonah's dead. Six months.&quot;

Something blocked him. She'd never resisted him before now, even at her worst
he'd been able to break though and find a way to calm her. He got nothing but
flashes, too fast to read them, too bright to take them in. It frightened him.

&quot;River?&quot; He asked gently, vaguely aware of Simon turning to look at them.

&quot;There was blood on my knees.&quot; She rocked a little, back and forth. &quot;Blood.
Everywhere blood. On Kaylee, too. Blue hands in brains. Can't say no. Tell
them. Can't say no. Had to. Six months.&quot;

&quot;Calm down, River.&quot; He pushed himself up onto his elbow and reached out to her.
&quot;It's okay...&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; She threw up a hand to ward him off and leapt from the bed, sending a
tray of instruments clattering to the floor. &quot;It's not... Can't say... Jonah's
dead. Can't be here. Shouldn't be here.&quot;

He forced himself to a sitting position and she flinched from him, threw her
body across the room so that she could be away from him. He couldn't stop
staring at the sharpness of her movements, the irregular jerk of her head, the
way she started to shake.

&quot;River?&quot; Simon approached her carefully. &quot;I'm here, mei mei.&quot;

Her answer was a loud cry in no language that Jonah recognized.

Another energy burst into the room and he turned to see a man opening the door.
Mal. The name hit him with the title. Captain. Jonah could do nothing but watch
as Mal moved quickly to a drawer and pulled out a hypo.

&quot;Can you hold her, doctor?&quot;

&quot;Because of me!&quot; She backed away from both the men. &quot;I did it! And the blood
came. Bubbles through fingers! In the brain! And dead men fall like
stones!&quot;

&quot;River? It's Simon.&quot; Jonah watched him reach out and wrap his arms around her,
bringing her arms in close to her body as she thrashed against him. &quot;It's okay,
mei mei, it's okay.&quot;

Mal rushed in with the hypo. The effect was instant, on River and on Jonah.

&quot;Simon?&quot; Her voice, cracked and desperate, as she ran out of steam. &quot;Simon, I
did it. It was me. When they... but I... and... I wanted... but... he
said...&quot;

The wall that had pushed against him crumbled with her body. She flooded into
him, the violent cascade of her brain slowing to a stupor that flickered once
or twice with an image and was then quiet.

&quot;Sh, mei mei.&quot; Simon's soft voice carried and Jonah watched him run his hands
over her hair, her cheeks. &quot;I'm here. I'm here.&quot;

She was too far gone and Jonah squashed his confusion to focus on Simon. What
he saw there made his jaw ache as he clenched it. Months of it, the medicines,
the episodes, the too brief moments of lucidity at first, tears, laughter, the
everyday struggle to function.

Jonah watched Simon carry her out, easily hefting her into his arms as if he'd
done it many times before. Which he had. He watched Simon and he felt Mal
watching him.

&quot;No.&quot; He answered the question before it was asked. &quot;I haven't seen her like
that before.&quot;

***

*He walks into the room, still flush with his success, head still high with all
the arrogance of the fifteen year old boy he is. It is a school of gifted
people, everyone here is talented beyond belief and now he has been chosen, he
has risen to the very top.*

*There are other children in the room and he notes with a little dismay that
several of them are very young. The girl in the corner looks to be about eight
or nine. They hover, uncertain, called to this special meeting because of their
brilliance.*

*He sees a girl sitting by herself and he gravitates towards her. She's more
his age and he wants to know why she looks so pensive. Her long brown hair lies
impossibly still all the way down her back and her eyes are wistful.*

*I'm Jonah, he tells her.*

*River, is her reply. He takes it as permission to sit down next to her.*

*Can you believe this? Is his next question. I can't wait for the new program
to start. I need a challenge.*

*She turns her face to him and he sees the hint of a smile.*

*I'm not sure. Her voice is soft and he suspects that it would be beautiful if
she were laughing and happy. I have a lot of friends at this school, I'm going
to miss them.*

*Miss them? He asks, surprised by her words. Where are you going? I thought we
were all here to start an advanced schedule.*

*I can't seem to shake it, she shrugs, I have the strangest feeling that I'm
never going to see them again.*

*He laughs gently. You're just nervous. Don't worry, I'll be your friend in
here if you want.*

*She does smile at him then, her face gaining a light he knows he's going love.
She turns to him and takes his hand in hers, shakes it officially with a
charming little nod of her chin.*

*Well, then, Jonah. You'll have to tell me all about you. What's your favorite
class? I'm loving physics right now, but I secretly prefer to dance. They said
I could still dance. Can you imagine? It's like my wildest dreams come true:
school that actually challenges my brain and dance classes as well.*

***

Mal watched the man out of the corner of his eye as he began to pick up the
tools spilled over the floor. What they'd given her this time was half the
strength of the last dose. He hoped it wouldn't debilitate her like the last
one, Simon had promised it wouldn't, they needed her awake and alert.

&quot;You're a hypocrite.&quot;

Jonah stood up, swaying lightly as he tried to adjust. He kept the light sheet
wrapped around his waist and Mal could see that, despite the slightly wasted
look of his body, this was a man that knew strength.

&quot;What?&quot; Mal stopped what he was doing and looked squarely at Jonah. They faced
off. &quot;You care to explain yourself?&quot;

Jonah looked at the doctor on the bed. His mouth tightened into a line as his
hand reached up and pulled the lines from his arm.

&quot;You blame her for what she did.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Oh, I know, it's not the
injuries themselves that bother you. You've seen a lot worse, done a lot worse.
It's the fact that she did it up close.&quot;

Mal stepped to the left as Jonah stepped to the right, stepping closer to the
cot in the middle of the room. They circled each other.

&quot;You think that the distance of a gun makes it noble. You're ready to arm
yourself and your crew right now and break into a facility, shooting everything
that moves. Most likely you'll kill them if you do, without thought or care of
their individual guilt, except the job that they chose. You've done it before,
countless times.&quot;

Mal couldn't deny this.

&quot;The gun itself is not a weapon, it's just an extension of the person holding
it. It's the person that's dangerous. If you shoot someone, you might as well
reach into their body and pull it apart with your fingers. There's no
difference, no distance, nothing that changes the fact of the murder.&quot;

Jonah reached out and touched Dr. William's forehead.

&quot;The only difference between you shooting the people that get in your way and
River harming this man is that River knew he was guilty. She knows first hand
the pain he has caused people, she saw it, she felt it. If anything, her act is
more just than yours.&quot;

He made sure Mal was watching.

&quot;And my act?&quot; Jonah lifted his hand and bought it down with swift precision on
the delicate bones of the doctor's throat. Mal winced as a loud crack sounded
throughout the room. &quot;Well, it just saves River having to become a killer,
doesn't it?&quot;

Jonah shivered as he felt an explosion in his head, the flash of a man's life.
It passed quickly and all that was left behind was the trail of River's guilt.
He could feel how it scratched at her, how the noise in her head had gotten too
loud, how the doctor had not been able to control his memories and that had
pushed her over the edge. The final violation.

&quot;She feels bad enough. Don't you dare make it worse for her by bringing your
own guilt into it.&quot; Jonah spoke slowly and evenly. &quot;River can't help what they
made her. And they made her into a weapon, a finely tuned one at that. This
man? He got off lightly compared to what I know she can do, what she stopped
herself from doing.&quot;

Mal had been slowly making his way to the door, he didn't take his eyes off the
man standing there as he opened it and leaned out.

&quot;Jayne?&quot; He called. &quot;When you and the Sheppard are done cleaning up that dorm
room, I got a body needs disposing of.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Came the response as both men nodded a wary understanding to each
other. &quot;Gorram it, Mal...&quot;

***

Kaylee was left alone.

She stared at the walls. Her brain was going in several different directions
all at once, scanning her situation. All the white was giving her a headache.
The doctor had been right, Wash was currently in a lot of danger, unknowing and
vulnerable. She couldn't think about that. There was nothing she could do to
help him right now.

Kaylee was left alone in a room with nothing.

She didn't even know where she was, but River did. Which meant that Mal did,
which meant there would be lots of weapons and he, Zoe, Jayne and probably
everybody else on the ship would come barreling in any minute now. Except that
they hadn't yet and Kaylee had no idea whether or not River actually did know
where she was, she had nothing but the say so of a vaguely threatening voice.
Anything could happen before Serenity and her crew got to her.

Kaylee was left alone in a room with nothing save the small bed she sat on.

She had gleaned a small sense of security from the figure she now thought of as
Jonah, from the children who had taken her side and come between her and the
doctor. Jonah was gone and she knew he would not be back for her. The memory of
the cries from the night before was enough for Kaylee to stop herself from
expecting the children to continue to help her.

It wasn't even the threats which stuck in her head as much as the scene in that
room the day before. They had shielded the girl, yes, but they had shown no
emotion, even when they knew what would happen. She did not know how many times
it had happened before, but she wasn't going to let it happen on account of her
again.

Kaylee was left alone in a room with nothing save the small bed she sat on and
painfully white walls.

If she was keeping score properly, that ruled out River, Jonah, Wash, anyone on
board Serenity and the children from coming to her immediate aide. It also left
several security guards, Dr. Williams, the many other masked doctors, two men
with blue hands and a really annoying voice preparing to do things to her body
she couldn't begin to imagine and didn't really want to.

Kaylee was left alone in a room with nothing save the small bed she sat on,
painfully white walls and a small sink.

There was only one person she hadn't counted on throughout the whole ordeal. It
struck her with a sudden clarity that tasted like copper in the grooves of her
mouth. She felt their hands run over her skin and through her hair. She looked
down at herself in the stark white hospital gown they'd given her. No places to
hide, no place they wouldn't look.

But Kaylee had been left alone in a room with nothing save the small bed she
sat on, painfully white walls, a small sink...

And a hairpin.

***

She let herself drift, floating and falling and wafting up on a breeze that
wasn't real. Drifting up and gliding down, sliding across a landscape of her
own making, full of trees and sunshine and the tinkling sound of water. There
were footsteps in her garden.

*River?*

She opened her eyes to look at him. He sat across from her, watching, waiting
for her. He was scared, nervous, he didn't flow into her brain like he usually
did. River knew she'd scared him.

&quot;You were dead, you know.&quot; A smile edged onto her lips, shy and embarrassed as
she sat up and blinked her eyes free of the haze.

&quot;That's what they told you.&quot; His eyes studied her and she couldn't meet them.
&quot;It's what they told everyone. I only woke up two days ago.&quot;

Her lip trembled and he moved to her side.

&quot;I missed you.&quot; She looked up at the ceiling, eyes scanning for answers in the
tiles or perhaps a reason to hold back the tears. &quot;You were gone so long.&quot;

&quot;River?&quot; His question was gentle, but she could already feel the tendrils of
his thoughts. &quot;What did they do to you? After...?&quot;

&quot;Don't, Jonah.&quot; She shut her eyes and wished she could control it like he did,
wished she could pick and choose how it worked all the time. &quot;Please
don't?&quot;

His hands came up and rested themselves on the sides of her head as she leaned
into them, let the weight of her head fall into him. She could feel his face
near hers and knew he wanted to look into her eyes.

&quot;It's alright, River.&quot; She knew he was speaking out loud for her, that he
wouldn't press her if she really didn't want it, but she had never been able to
say no to him. &quot;I'll be here, I'll be with you.&quot;

&quot;I don't want to.&quot; Her lip trembled harder now and she opened her eyes, a hot
tear sliding out. &quot;Don't tell them. Can't tell them. Have to keep it
secret.&quot;

Their eyes met and she nodded.

He felt dizzy as he rushed into it, unable to control the speed of her own
thoughts, loud voices and cries and he saw his own body lying broken and
bleeding.

Then the questions, the fear, the pain. He saw her strapped to a table, wires
taped to her skull, felt the agony of the laser as it burrowed into her, felt
the electricity pulse through her systems and the drugs speed up her heart.

They gasped together as Jonah felt the emptiness of her flatline and the
harshness of the pull back when they revived her. Over and over. The questions
never ended and she never broke.

She hadn't told them.

For six months she had kept it from them and it had been his fault. Jonah felt
her retreat further and further, felt her synapses snap and rupture with every
surgery they performed. His jaw tightened as he felt it, knew she'd been awake
for the worst of it. They tried everything they knew and they had known a lot.

&quot;Tell us who. I did it. I said it.&quot; Jonah bit his lips as she sobbed the words
out, same as before, and he tasted his own blood. &quot;I didn't want. When they...
but I... and... I wanted... but... you said...&quot;

It hurt him, her struggle for the words. What he heard in her head was
completely different.

*I didn't want to tell them, I wouldn't have said anything at all, but you kept
telling me to tell them it was you. They would have killed me, like they killed
the others, I knew it and I wanted it to happen right then. But you told me to
tell them and I did. I told them it was you and they killed you in front of
us.*

&quot;Can't say no. Tell them. Can't say no. Had to. Six months.&quot; She was shaking as
she fell into his arms and he found the same strokes her brother had, brushing
her hair back as his chin rested on the top of her head. &quot;Can't say... he's
dead. Can't be here. Shouldn't be here.&quot;

*All the things they did, for six months, everything I went through. It was all
for nothing. You lived. All for nothing. I wasn't the only one who knew. It
should never have happened. None of it. I wanted to let go, but I held on,
because somebody had to know. I could have escaped it all. All for
nothing.*

Jonah left her brain. He didn't want to hear the crystal clarity inside when it
never reached the surface, didn't want to feel the frustration of it, the
absolute certainty that she was right and no one would know, because the words
she said were never the words she wanted and the more she tried the worse it
became.

He laid his hands gently on her shoulders and pushed her back. Her eyes
searched his, scared and confused at the sudden loneliness inside her thoughts.
Jonah stood up and set his jaw.

&quot;We'll make them pay, you and I.&quot; He paused, waited for her to look up at him.
&quot;Now let's see about getting Kaylee back for you.&quot;

He held his hand out, palm down, an offering. He watched as five small fingers
came up to meet his, shaking but sure. Their hands curled into each other and
she let herself be pulled to a standing position.

***

*They huddle in groups, the smallest ones together and the middle ones trying
to act like they don't care as much, as if they're not as worried as the rest
of them. They sit at tables in the middle of the room, stand near the wall,
waiting for the missing among them. In just one week they've gone from
individuals to a group.*

*It started, Jonah thinks, the moment all nineteen of them were herded onto the
ship. That's when they knew, because you need special papers to transport a
child across planetary borders, particularly a group of them. Especially if
their families don't know. No one will know where they are, they won't know
where to look.*

*He stands with his back against the wall.*

*Whatever they're doing, it's not good. River says as she sits on the floor
next to his legs, knees up to her chest and she's hugging her calves. I
shouldn't have come here. It sounds too good to be true, that's what Simon
said. I should have listened. He's never wrong.*

*None of us should be here. He says. None of us knew.*

*She looks up at him and he can see the fear in her eyes.*

*Whatever they're doing to him, they're going to do to us. He feels a chill at
her words and she keeps speaking even as her voice shakes. I think... I think I
can take anything but the not knowing. I can't stand not knowing.*

*Jonah thinks maybe they're all better off not knowing, but he doesn't say it.
She's already scared half out of her wits and he's never really had close
female friends before, but he's convinced that part of the agreement is not
pushing her the rest of the way.*

*We'll be okay. He insists instead, even though he's not sure he believes it
anymore. There's been some sort of mistake and as soon as they realize it,
they'll take us home.*

*Even as he says the words, he knows they're pointless. River's face says she
thinks the same thing, but she's not going to say it.*

*The tests they've been giving us, all those questions. River looks forward,
but her face is still angled up to his as she speaks. They gave us more.
They're planning something for the both of us. I think we fit some sort of plan
of theirs. Don't you?*

*He nods, knows she's right, wishes he knew how to make her feel better.*

*All I wanted was to dance. She sighs petulantly. I think they lied.*

*She's such a brat, it makes him grin. Jonah pushes away from the wall and
turns to face her. She looks up at him with narrowed eyes of confusion. He
holds out his hand palm down, an offering, and watches as she reaches out to
take it.*

*You can still dance, he says as he pulls her up to her feet, you don't need
their permission.*

*Hands still clasped together, he throws his other arm around her waist and
drags her into a wide spin, before she can catch her breath he twirls her
around. There's a spark in her eyes as she catches the beat and they move
together in the silence. The younger ones stop their whispering and nervous
chatter to watch them and their faces begin to smile, too.*

*He can see the laugh about to burst from her face when she stops, frozen in
mid step and he watches her face fall quickly, there's a trickle of blood
running from her left nostril. He watches the question rise to her lips and
feels her hand slip away from his.*

*It's then that he sees the blue hand on her shoulder.*

*What have you done? He demands, wanting to yell the words, but they come out
terrified and small as he looks at the man behind her. She's bleeding.*

*Don't worry about River Tam. Jonah spins to see another man standing behind
him, another pair of blue hands. She'll be perfectly fine.*

*If she does what she's told, announces the first man who lets River go and
doesn't even blink when she crumples to the floor. If you all do what you're
told.*

*Jonah hears the whimpers that come from the youngest of them, he can see some
of the other faces that are a mix of anger and terror. What he feels is a
sudden, groundless knowledge that they're all in danger. He knows for a fact
now that no one will be looking for them, no one that will succeed.*

*They've brought Charles back, the young boy completing their group of
nineteen. He doesn't know what they've done to him, but Jonah can see the marks
along the boy's hairline, can see the vacant way he's staring into the room and
the way his right hand twitches.*

*They've brought Charles back, but they've bought him back wrong.*

***

Simon gave the table one last wipe down. In no way, shape or form did he want
to know what they did with the body. He has to concern himself with the living.
A quiet knock sounded on the door and he gritted his teeth.

&quot;I don't want to talk right now.&quot; He couldn't trust himself not to say
something stupid. &quot;Not to you.&quot;

&quot;I understand that, son,&quot; came Book's reply, &quot;and I respect it as I said I
would, but now is not the time for personal grudges.&quot;

&quot;Personal...?&quot; Simon spun around and caught himself from going further with
that outburst. &quot;You followed me here to kill me and give my sister back to her
torturers. Explain to me how it's not personal?&quot;

&quot;If my calculations are correct,&quot; Book didn't blink at Simon's hostility, he
welcomed it in point of fact, &quot;they'll be planning a rescue mission some time
soon. A big one. Very big. We're all going to need to rely on each other.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Simon drawled the sarcasm out liberally, &quot;because I really feel like
placing my life in your hands right now.&quot;

&quot;Exactly my point, Simon.&quot; Book sighed. &quot;At this point in time things are
bigger than you and me. It's not about who did what months and years ago, this
is about a young girl's life. Kaylee's life. When this is all finished and we
have her back, feel free to hate me. I'll even leave this ship if you feel it's
necessary, I don't want to, but I will. For now, though, we need to call a
truce.&quot;

&quot;There's only one thing wrong with that strategy.&quot; Simon met Book's eyes. &quot;It's
no use planning anything for when this is all finished, because this is never
finished. Trust me, I know.&quot;

Book smiled the very small smile of the newly almost forgiven.

&quot;You're a good man, Simon Tam.&quot;

&quot;So they keep telling me with each new and exciting crime I get involved with.&quot;

&quot;I think we should meet up with the others now.&quot; Book suggested. &quot;I want to be
part of the plans.&quot;

It wasn't ideal, it was awkward and tense, but it was a truce and it was
necessary, Simon knew it as they left the infirmary. He just couldn't get the
thought out of his head, all those times Book had sat with River and he hadn't
once said anything. All the times he'd spoken with Simon and during all of it
there had been an undercurrent Simon had never been aware of.

&quot;Jonah, no!&quot;

Simon felt it before he saw it, before his brain could process River's words.
He stepped back, out of the way, as Jonah slammed Book up against the wall of
the common room, one arm pressed firmly against his throat.

&quot;Not this man.&quot; River placed a hand on Jonah's arm and tried to make him let
go. &quot;No.&quot;

Book struggled to breathe. He trusted his instincts, which had not gotten him
killed once that he knew of, and at that moment his instincts were telling him
to keep still and not speak. Jonah was staring at him, eyes fierce and breath
heavy.

River squeezed between them, forced her body through a non existent gap and
pushed against Jonah, her hands on his shoulders. There was a long moment when
nothing happened and Book felt a trickle of fear for the girl.

&quot;Please, Jonah?&quot; River's voice shook, but her gaze was steady. &quot;For me? Leave
him alone for me?&quot;

Their eyes met and Book knew there was something flowing between them that
neither he, nor Simon, would ever be privy to. What mattered, however, was the
slow easing of the pressure at his throat, the rush of cold air into his lungs
again.

&quot;Stay away from me.&quot; Jonah managed as he pushed back and took a long step away.
&quot;For your own sake.&quot;

Instincts were not always what they were cracked up to be.

&quot;For what it's worth, I am sorry, son.&quot;

Jonah and River had crossed half the room when he stopped and tried to turn.
River kept hold of his hands and tugged him towards the stairs.

&quot;Don't call me son!&quot; There was a flash of anger in Jonah's eyes, before it
turned cold again. &quot;He was my father and you call yourself a man of god?&quot;

There was nothing Book could say to that, nothing that would help. He and Simon
watched the two climb the stairs.

&quot;Working together, huh?&quot; Simon nodded slowly. &quot;Yep, this is going to end well.&quot;

Strange, how the difference between waiting to be rescued and taking steps to
rescue yourself can change your whole perspective. Kaylee was calmer as she lay
on the table this time, she had to be. It was necessary to remain in control if
she was going to take note of all the details.

There were five doctors, two women and three men, none of whom would meet her
eyes. Two of the men and a woman went to adjust switches and monitor screens.
She recognized some of the machines along the wall and the different com links,
but there was a lot of equipment she didn't think she'd ever seen before. There
was only one door into and out of the room.

She was calm, but it didn't stop her flinching when she felt a hand on her arm,
her whole body stiffened.

&quot;Relax.&quot; Said the man who had stayed with her. &quot;We won't hurt you.&quot;

Kaylee did not react to this, just kept herself still and waited. The woman at
her side had the grace to blush.

&quot;None of us here will hurt you unnecessarily.&quot; She corrected. &quot;Dr. Williams is
not here today. He won't be back.&quot;

There was an edge to her voice, if Kaylee wasn't imagining it, and significant
glances shared around the room. She wanted to know just what had happened to
the doctor and whether it had to do with the children.

&quot;How do you feel today?&quot;

She didn't answer the question, just closed her eyes and gave a slight shake of
her head, sure that anything she said in response to this would not be taken
favorably. They taped the wires back onto her head, scanned her with the
machines again, poked and prodded different pressure points, wrote down the
results, talked among themselves. It was almost bearable.

Kaylee knew that whatever she was going to do it couldn't be in this room,
there wasn't enough room for escape and if Mal had taught her anything, it was
the value of a good escape plan. No, the most likely chance she'd get would be
when she was in transit, on the way back to that room. Four guards would ferry
her there and there was an elevator at the other end of the hallway in the
opposite direction they would take her. She had to make it there. This room
with the mysterious medical equipment was useless to her, so was the stark room
with the bed. The elevator, however, was a big box of machinery and she could
use that.

&quot;Headaches?&quot; They continued to ask her and she continued to shake her head.

&quot;Dizziness? Blurred vision? Nausea?&quot; She kept shaking her head to their
questions. &quot;Pain anywhere?&quot;

Kaylee opened her eyes.

&quot;We're getting an accelerated heat reading.&quot; Announced one of the men by the
machines. &quot;Right side of the facial structure.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; The woman replied, dryly. She touched the violent swelling of
Kaylee's cheek and Kaylee had to bite back a whimper. &quot;Is that so? Anywhere
else?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; The man's voice sounded smaller this time.

The woman leaned down close.

&quot;Kaylee? We need to know something.&quot; It was the way her voice had gone suddenly
cold that made Kaylee take notice. &quot;How far along are you in your cycle?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Her eyes flew between the man and woman at her side. &quot;I don't know
what...&quot;

&quot;Listen, Kaylee, you can tell us now or we can take advantage of the fact
you're strapped to our table and physically measure the thickness of your
endometrial lining. Trust me when I say we won't be gentle about it. Do you
understand what that means?&quot;

Kaylee nodded slowly.

Mal caught Zoe on the way to the dining room, his hand taking her elbow and
drawing her aside as she waved a confused Wash onward. She raised her brow and
waited.

&quot;I'm putting Book next to me.&quot; He said quietly. &quot;I want you on his other side.&quot;

&quot;Sir?&quot;

&quot;Just a precaution.&quot; He assured her. &quot;A wise one, I'm thinking.&quot;

Zoe eyed him shrewdly.

&quot;And Jayne?&quot;

&quot;I was thinking,&quot; Mal shrugged a little too casually, &quot;perhaps, right next to
Jonah at the other end of the table.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; A small, knowing smile edged her lips. &quot;Just a precaution.&quot;

&quot;That boy was in a coma for a year and a half.&quot; Mal whispered. &quot;And within days
of waking up he's already killed a man and attacked another. I'm thinking, yes,
a little bit of extra caution is necessary. Don't you?&quot;

&quot;I wasn't arguing.&quot; She replied. &quot;Just pointing out your choice of words.&quot;

He looked at her, but she kept her face blank as they went to meet the others.
The tensions ran high and Jonah swept more than one glare towards Book. It made
Mal nervous, very nervous.

&quot;We need to come up with some kind of plan. We're all in this together.&quot; He
looked around the table, finally ending with River and Jonah at the opposite
end to him. &quot;So I'd take it as a kindness if everything was spoken out
loud.&quot;

They nodded without looking at each other.

&quot;We need to get away from Orpheus.&quot; Mal continued. &quot;It won't be long before
they start looking for the doctor, if they haven't already.&quot;

&quot;I'll give you coordinates.&quot; Jonah said to Wash. &quot;If you push her hard, we can
be there in twelve hours.&quot;

&quot;Twelve is twenty two.&quot; River whispered urgently. &quot;Eight too late. You know it.&quot;

&quot;River...&quot; Jonah started, but she shook her head.

&quot;She won't know. She won't know who it is.&quot; River pleaded. &quot;It's going to make
her sad. Eat her up with it.&quot;

&quot;Who won't she know?&quot;

Simon's question was gentle and River's eyes widened, stretched in time with
her hands that splayed on the table. She gave a shudder before looking at
Jonah. He nodded at her and she swallowed deeply.

&quot;Everybody knows. Sometimes only themselves, but they know that half. Kaylee
won't know.&quot; She gave a nod to Jonah. &quot;We'll have to tell her, she won't like
it.&quot;
