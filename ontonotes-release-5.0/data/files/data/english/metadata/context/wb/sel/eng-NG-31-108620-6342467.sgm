The Criminal Liability of Lisa Nowak

By Philip Averbuck

Spec./Capt. Lisa Nowak faces serious legal jeopardy in Florida.
After reading the arrest/charging affidavits, I have to wonder
at some of the commentary out there. Jeffrey Fieger appeared on
Good Morning America Friday and told the audience that, "at
most, she might be guilty of an assault and battery."  Here in
Florida, those charges are both misdemeanors, punishable by a
maximum of 14 months in the county jail (12 for the battery, 2
for the assault.)

Counselor Fieger was grossly mistaken.

Based on the contents of the bag that was recovered from the
trash can (after a policeman saw Capt. Nowak dump it in there),
the [utterly credible] victim's statement, Capt. Nowak's
post-Miranda statement, and the statutes here in Florida, these
are the charges she could be convicted of in a heartbeat, and
their concomitant maximum prison penalties in Florida:

Florida Statutes 787.02  False imprisonment (5 years)
Florida Statutes 790.07  Persons engaged in criminal
offense, having weapons (5 years)
Florida Statutes 812.133  Carjacking, armed (Life)
Florida Statutes 787.01  Kidnapping, armed (Life)
Florida Statutes 810.02  Burglary, with assault/battery,
armed (Life)

Mr. Fieger put a lot of emphasis on Capt. Nowak's claim that she
had only brought the weapons (steel mallet, knife, real-looking
BB pistol) in order to "scare" her victim so she'd talk to her.
Uhhhhhh, this is exactly what constitutes a false imprisonment
or kidnapping, the unlawful confinement of a victim (by
well-founded fear, in this case--assuming Capt. Nowak never
would have actually used the tubing she had bought to tie up her
victim).

Mr. Fieger had a valid point, in that the attempted first degree
murder charge that Capt. Nowak is facing is probably excessive.
But so what?  This parade of potential life felonies doesn't
need any enhancement..."Hey, Lisa, good news!  The judge threw
out the attempted murder charge!  Now we're only sunk on 2 or 3
other life felonies!"

Did I mention that we don't have parole here in Florida?

Apart from her extraordinary life story, Capt. Nowak has
horrific equities surrounding her case:  long-term
premeditation;  stunningly precise planning and execution of her
plan;  focus on a completely innocent victim;  carrying out her
plan all the way, even to the point of pepper-spraying the
victim when she unwisely rolled her car window down speak to the
"tearful" Capt. Nowak;  making an enormous physical effort to
complete the plan;  a written list of the items needed to
complete the plan (too bad she didn't add one last item to the
list:  "When other items are purchased, BURN THIS LIST!");  and
a great effort to conceal her identity.

I've made it a point to ask many Florida prosecutors one
question over the years:  "What portion of our cases involve (1)
a defendant who is genuinely guilty, (2) doing/attempting to do
something genuinely harmful, (3) to someone who is genuinely
innocent?"  The answer is always, "Oh, about 20-25%."
Unfortunately, Capt. Nowak falls into this category...and the
evidence against her is overwhelming.

Fortunately for her, her life story may just pull her future out
of the fire. I predict that she will eventually plead guilty to
the 2 lesser felonies (it will keep her scoresheet points down),
or perhaps a stipulated reduced charge of aggravated battery
(15-year max), with her sentence to be begun in a lockdown
mental facility.  Then a lengthy probation--4-8 years.

Her life will be ruined in the short term, but unlike so many of
my defendants, she she will have a chance to rebuild it outside
of the Florida State Prison system.

I'm not so sure it'll go that well for her.
The premeditation will make any incompetence defense
difficult, so I don't see a psychiatric prison in here future.

In Florida there's little sympathy for first time offenses for
violent crimes. And the high profile nature of the case will
only cause the prosecutors to want a long and very public
trial. With so much evidence the prosecution doesn't
need to cut any deals, she'll have to go to trial
and hope for a sympathetic jury.

I doubt she'll get less than ten to fifteen hard time for what
she did, if not life. It's what she deserves and what other
people routinely get for attempted murder.  If the story
we're told so far is true, it looks pretty obvious she was
planning kidnapping, murder and disposing of the
body.

Me thinks that she'll end up only facing one or two (reduced) assault and

Assault, with pepper spray, is all she really did...

It happened the moment she appeared on the front page as a psycho killer

Debating Lisa Nowak's future is pointless.

Unless she is declared innocent within months, she is either never
returning to NASA, or would be returning at a time where all the crews for
the remaining shuttle flights will have been assigned.

And even if she returned, her episode would make her unacceptable for fligt
since she has proven she can switch from normal to "nuts" without warning.

A few more points to consider:

Reportedly, she already admitted to the cops that she had been stalking
Ms. Shipman for 2 months prior to this attack.  So you can add a guilty
plea for that onto what you've already listed here.  The legal term is
"criminal harassment" or "criminal menace," and every state in the
Union, Florida included, now has made such stalking illegal.  If the
stalking results in actual harm to the victim, as was the case here
thanks to her spraying Mace on the victim, the penalties for stalking
rise further.

For an insanity defense, having a psychiatrist testify that "Ms. Nowak
has problems" won't be sufficient.  For an insanity defense to be
legally acceptable, Lisa Nowak would have to establish that she either
didn't know what she was doing, or she didn't know it was illegal.  The
fact that she deliberately wore a disguise to hide her identity is going
to make that impossible.

I wouldn't be surprised if the cops have some additional piece of
evidence they're withholding from the media for the moment, that
accounts for why they decided to stick her with a murder charge.   It
could be something she wrote in her letter to Oefelein, the full text of
which hasn't been released to the media, that implied she was going to
get rid of Shipman or something.

The saddest part of all this:
Whatever jail time she gets, won't be in one of those minimum-security
"country club" prisons like the one Martha Stewart went to, for insider
trading.  Lisa Nowak will be going to a women's prison for violent
offenders.  And she is going to find the conditions in there rather
distressing for someone of her background.

But there's a silver lining in this sad episode:  Nobody was seriously
hurt, yet it really illuminated the whole issue of space psychology,
which hasn't been given the attention it deserves, given that
long-duration crewed space missions like lunar bases and Mars landings
are under serious consideration.

Unlike the Challenger and Columbia tragedies, in which flaws were
identified at the cost of human lives, this time NASA got a very big and
very public wake-up call on a potential future problem without having to
pay a big penalty for it in human lives.

It's too politically incorrect for NASA to admit it, but space
psychology is made more difficult by having mixed-gender crews from a
mixed-gender astronaut corps pool.  It can lead to all the problems
we've seen here on earth with "workplace romances," amplified by the
isolation and autonomy and boredom on a long-duration deep space flight.

Not at all. The only space related item in this whole story is that
the perp is an astronaut, the guy she apparantly wanted a romantic
thing with also is one, and the other woman works at the Cape.

Its like saying if a woman who works in a copy centre goes postal,
that there must be something wrong with the copy centre industry.
Nuts.

Theres nothing about this that is "space related " other than what
jobs the three people have. Theres not a whit of evidence that there
is anything NASA related in any of the causes.

Well, who would want to have her on their crew, given that she has obviously
flipped over this.

Whatever the intention, and of course only she can know that,  it seems  to
me she has well and truly shot herself in the foot.

Sadly, this can happen to people, and its why we have justice systems in
place. She is probably not that dangerous of course, only dangerous to
whoever she has a grudge against at the time.

What of her family, was she estranged or  does her  husband not figure in
this?

I mean, every day  people have  several girlfriends, and if that is all it
takes to flip, well. Makes you wonder if there was more going on here in her
life than just this.

All you say may well be the case, but I do not think that this crime is the
result of anything to do with space at all, it has to do with someone  who
could not handle being on the side when another person was the main
relationship.
It plays out lots of times in the world out there, but seldom do such over
the top plans come to pass. Its usually a confrontation or a catfight or
just  beating on the man in the middle. In this case, I wonder if her half
baked plan of disguise was  supposed to make it less obvious who she
actually was for the sake or her career, instead its made it a whole lot
worse!

Such  is life.

I cannot see the man or the other woman will have any problems here. After
all, they have done no more than a million others in this world.

I got the impression that Lisa thought the relationship was more than the
guy actually did.

It might be too politically incorrect for *you* to admit it, but the
problems of "workplace romances" aren't limited to male-female ones,
especially in long-duration single-sex environments.

Sexual jealousy and stereotype-based group conflicts have *not* been
serious problems for the Antarctic research stations, despite growing
numbers of women there.

P.S.:  If you really think single-sex crews are mandatory, the obviously
preferred approach is all-female crews.  They are less competitive and
territorial, and their smaller size and mass reduce resource use.

Possibly, but I'd want to see the data for, say, stays at the base at the
South Pole.  NASA isn't the best place to look for data like this.  They've
not had many "long duration" flights, and those are limited to six months.

The Russians would be a good starting point for some of this, but I doubt
NASA would trust the Russians in this area any more than they've trusted
them elsewhere.  When NASA looks at something the Russians have experience
in, they seem to almost always have a huge Not Invented Here reaction.

Only on the Gemini 7 flight where Frank Borman and Jim Lovell got engaged.
It was always suspected that Borman had a little something to do the
Apollo 13 malfunction after he found Lovell spending a little too much
time with William Anders preparing for the Apollo 8 flight.
That was bad enough, but when Lovell started hanging around with that

This event *is* a data point. A single data point, yes, but still a
data point.

Prior to this event, we assumed that all the people in the astronaut
program were respectable and responsible people. Now, we have had what
appears to be an egregious example of bad behavior from a former
Shuttle astronaut.

This says to us that the people in the astronaut program at the
present time are not as level-headed and responsible as we had assumed
them to be. (Proof: this news item was experienced by the American
people as surprising.) This says that our estimate of the probability
of an untoward event happening in space has to be adjusted upwards.

The reasoning is not illogical. To derive inferences from observation,
one has to resort to Bayesian statistics, because one is operating in
inductive rather than deductive reasoning.

Another shining example of your failure to properly interpret what is

spray is, at most, simple assault. She brought a BB gun and a knife,

By your thinking there can be no such crime as 'attempted murder',
since unless the victim is actually killed there is no 'act'.  So
trying to kill someone AND FAILING isn't a crime at all, according to
you.

Does Nowak lack a conscience? Someone is going to have to prove that
as well.

Yes, but it's conjecture based on the available evidence.  If that

If the suspect actually does shoot you, the bullet misses the heart and

attempted murder. The suspect actually took an action which was clearly
aimed at killing the victim (but failed in its endeavour).

If the person is an experienced sharpshooter and shoots you in the lower

But they didn't kill them, so how can you say they were trying to?
Same thing.

The line for attempted murder isn't nearly so rigourous.  The plan
existed and the first overt action was taken.  That's enough.  They
may let her plead it down, though.

Does Florida use the McNaughton (sp?) Rule for its 'not mentally
competent' test, or is it easier to claim mental defect than that?

:attempted murder since that person probably could have hit you right

Audey Murphy actually used this defense.  He was being accused by
someone of trying to kill them because he discharged a .45 in their
direction.  He brought in a box full of medals (including all his
marksmanship awards), looked at the judge, and said, "If I'd wanted to
hit him, he'd be dead now."

He got off with a misdemeanor ticket for illegally discharging a
firearm.

There are lots and lots of places in Florida where you can toss a body
with the reasonable expectation that 'gators will eat it before it's
found.

With regard to the rest of your silly comment, mere lack of a body
hardly constitutes "the perfect murder".  As usual, your ignorance
betrays you.

So?  Lots of people who don't "lack a conscience" live with all sorts
of things.

:I suppose in your Machiavellian universe asking "why" is justified.

I suppose in your moronic universe that everyone who ever does
anything 'wrong' must "lack a conscience".

Reality, of course, trumps your stupidity.

The question does not require an answer as these items (rubber gloves,
plastic bags, tape) could be explained as item taken from work to
assist in cleaning the cat box. These items were not used in the
crime. They are simply items in the vehicle. She also had a tank of
gas, does this mean she was planning to burn the body? Perhaps she
would use the wiring harness to strangle her victim.
These items were in the vehicle and were not on her person when she
allegedly approached the victim. The only items recovered and
identified as used in the commission of the alleged crime were pepper
spray, wig, trench coat, and money and the bag they were in.
You are correct it is an open and shut case of simple assault for
which she will receive the punishment of :
1. Time served
2. Probation - possibly with a monitoring device
3. Consuling
4. Community Service.
NASA will simply send her back to the Navy
The Navy will apply the UCMJ and discharge her with a less than
honorable discharge. She might luck out with a medical discharge which
will preserve her pension.
And that dear Rand will be that.

Perhaps, but if she did not have the knife *on her person* at the time of
the assault, then the mere presence of a knife in her vehicle *cannot* be
used as evidence to support attempted murder, any more than the guns in the
pawn shops within a hundred miles of the assault would support it. She did
not use it and it was not within easy reach at the time.

The existing evidence *does not* support a charge of attempted murder.
