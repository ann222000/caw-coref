I got a Malibu 600 watt transformer.  Model ML600TW.  When I rotate the
on/off knob, it makes the sound of smacking the outer housing with a stick.
A loud audible clank.  Then it hums.

When I apply the tester to the bottom connectors, I can't get it to read
anything.  Double checked tester with various voltage alkaline batteries on
DC, and they tested fine, so tester is good.

Is this transformer fried?  Is the humming normal?  Is that clanking noise
normal?

I tried it with a light, and the light works.  But I can't get a read on it
with a tester, though I can get a read on batteries with the tester when set
to 20 volt range on the tester.

Guess the clanging and humming is normal.

Steve:

I have a feeling your meter (tester) is not working on AC.  The actual
movement of a meter works on DC only.  So if you are measuring AC then it
has to rectify the AC before it goes to the meter movement.  I suggest you
measure the AC outlet in your place, assuming the meter is capable to
measure your house voltage to see if it is working properly.

The transformer may have some sections loose but otherwise may be working ok

Best Regards,

Ray R

Ah, I thought it was 12V DC but looking at other outdoor lighting, I think
the norm is actually 12 V AC.  Do you have an AC meter?  You should see the
voltage when you set it to AC.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Rafael, this was cross-posted to the metals newsgroup, and the threads there
include information that isn't shown here.  Steve mentioned that the
"transformer" is labeled "12 volt DC Output," so your idea, while logical,
has to be ruled out.  However, it is baffling to have an ekectrical output
that will light a bulb but not move a meter, UNLESS (this just occurred to
me) the output which is SUPPOSED  to be DC is actually AC.  Steve, check the
output  with the AC setting.  You could have a shorted rectifier bridge or
something.

Actually, I ass-u-med that it was 12v. DC output because of the tail light
style bulbs that come in the lights.  On the label, it does not say 12V AC
on the out, but merely 12V output.  I put the meter on there on AC and it
read 12.0.

Doh!

Everything is working, and I'll aim them tonight and bury the cables
tomorrow when I know they're right.

Okay, I admit it.  I'm stupid sometimes.

The difference between being insane and being mentally ill is that when you
are mentally ill, you know there's something wrong with you.  When you are
plain crazy, you haven't got a clue, and you argue that there's nothing
wrong with you.

I'm human.

That's okay.  I got some hideous welding caps that are just as good.

My grandson is four.  The other day, I come around the corner, wearing a
turquoise and yellow welding cap.  I act nonchalant.

"What's that, Papa?" he asks.

"Where?"

"On your head."

Sez me, "A hat."

"No it isn't," he says.  "Take it off."

Smart kid.
