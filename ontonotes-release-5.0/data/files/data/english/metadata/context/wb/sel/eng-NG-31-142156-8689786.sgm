you should be a politician on capitol hill, resty ! we'd save a lot of
money in foreign aid and the military budget would be down to a
minimum. everyone will have a great time at home in the u.s., and the
rest of the world can fight each other for all we care. we'll
negotiate only with the winner.

&gt;&gt; I have seen poor and destitute Americans, and Man, I tell you, it

&gt;&gt; movies, and yet there are these people who exist only on welfare. No

&gt;&gt; lose ? The news coverage on Katrina must have given you an idea of how
&gt;&gt; those poor live in New Orleans, Resty, and those weren't the only
&gt;&gt; ones ! Have you been to Africa ? I have ! You think you're back in the
&gt;&gt; Middle Ages once you get out from the big cities and visit those poor
&gt;&gt; villages ! Have you been to South America ? You've got to see it for
&gt;&gt; yourself to believe it !

&gt; So, instead of wasting all our money on war in Iraq,
&gt; we can help the poor people of the world.

&gt; &quot;Give him a fish, he only eats for one meal.
&gt; Show him how to fish, and he will eat for the rest of his life&quot;.

We do care for the poor and the unfortunates.
Send plows and seeds to plant,
and water pumps to irrigate the fields.
Teach them health and mental care.
Show them we do care.

where have you been all these years, resty ? all the money sent to the
&quot;3rd world&quot; always end up in the swiss bank accounts of the dictators
- yes dictators ! we turn a blind eye, because we want their natural
resources, and sell them surplus arms. like I said, let them fight it
out and we'll see about caring afterwards !
