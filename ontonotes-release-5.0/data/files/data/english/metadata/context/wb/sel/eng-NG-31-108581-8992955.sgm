Canadian-led study aims to answer thorny prostate cancer question

TORONTO (CP) â€” Canadian researchers are launching a large, multi-year
international study to try to find a way to help the hundreds of thousands
of men diagnosed with prostate cancer every year decide whether to opt for
potentially life-altering treatments or choose a watch-and-wait approach.

The Canadian Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute of Canada
announced the study Thursday, saying it is hoped the START trial - the
acronym stands for Surveillance Therapy Against Radical Treatment - will
resolve one of the thorniest dilemmas in prostate cancer care.

&quot;It's answering some questions that we really need some answers to. Does
active treatment at the time of diagnosis really make a difference in
terms of long-term survival from prostate cancer?&quot; explained Heather
Logan, director of cancer control policy with the Canadian Cancer Society.

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canadian men and
the third most fatal form of the disease. The cancer society estimates
that this year 22,300 Canadian men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer
and 4,300 will die from it.

The study is designed to follow 2,100 newly diagnosed volunteers in
Canada, the United States and Britain, randomly assigning them to receive
either treatment or to undergo active surveillance. Men in the
surveillance group whose cancer progresses or who later decide they want
to have treatment can do so.

It's expected it will take four to five years to enrol all the patients
who will then be followed for between 10 to 15 years. It could be 20 years
before this trial produces the answer so many men and their physicians
would like to see.

The principal investigator is Dr. Laurence Klotz, who daily sits across
from men faced with the decision of whether to agree to a watch-and-wait
approach - called active surveillance or watchful waiting - or to instead
have their prostate removed or undergo radiation treatment.

On the one hand is the stress of not trying to eradicate the cancer. On
the other is the real chance of long-term side-effects that can have a
serious impact on the man's quality of life.

&quot;You elect to avoid risk of prostate cancer death by having treatment, you
incur very major risk of erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence,
rectal problems if you have radiation and so on,&quot; said Klotz, chief
urologist at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.

&quot;The idea is we're trying to kind of drive a middle road between treating
everybody, which will result in over-treatment, and treating nobody which
will result in under-treatment and just identify the ones who look like
the bad actors.&quot;

He said choosing to take no immediate action is a particularly difficult
one, running counter to what he calls society's &quot;cancer hysteria&quot; - the
equation of a cancer diagnosis with a death sentence.

Tom LePoidevin, 73, had to make that tough choice in Klotz's office 16
years ago, when a PSA (prostate specific antigen) screening test revealed
he had prostate cancer.

&quot;As soon as you hear the news I think the majority of people would say:
'Oh, when are you going to be operated on,&quot;' said LePoidevin, a retired
marketing executive from Collingwood, Ont.

While he admits he occasionally frets about the fact he has a cancer he
hasn't tried to excise, LePoidevin believes he has made the right choice
for himself. But he hopes men in his position in future will be armed with
science, not best guesses, when they have to make the same decision.

Many men with prostate cancer need to undergo treatment to stop the
advance of the disease. But in many others - perhaps as many as half the
cases that come to light - doctors know the cancer is unlikely to break
out of the prostate and spread to other parts of the body.

Since the advent of PSA testing, large numbers of men who were seemingly
healthy have been told they have cancer cells in their prostates and have
faced this difficult choice. Experts say a significant portion of these
men will die from other causes and would never require any prostate cancer
care if the screening test hadn't signalled the presence of malignant
cells.

&quot;With a disease like this which typically is diagnosed in either late
middle age or more, death from other causes is by far the commonest cause
of death in men with prostate cancer. Heart disease is the commonest cause
of death in men with prostate cancer,&quot; Klotz said.

He noted that at age 50, about one out of every two men will have some
cancer cells in their prostate. By age 80, the number is 80 per cent.

The problem is, doctors don't know how to determine with certainty which
are the cancers that will progress (and therefore should be treated) and
which are the types that won't. As as result, many men receive treatment
they would never have needed if their cancer hadn't been picked up by a
PSA test.

&quot;I think there's a strong consensus, not only in the United States but
around the world, that there is over-treatment,&quot; said Dr. Barnett Kramer,
associate director for disease prevention at the U.S. National Institutes
of Health in Bethesda, Md.

&quot;The magnitude of over-treatment is probably debated, but not the fact
that some men are over-treated.&quot;

Finding a way to be able to determine at the time of diagnosis which is
which would be a valuable contribution to the field of cancer care, Kramer
suggested.

&quot;Absolutely. Because day in and day out the decision is being made with
regard to therapy of screen-detected prostate cancer whether to treat or
how aggressively to treat,&quot; he said.

&quot;And it affects over 100,000 men a year just in the United States, and
around the world it affects that many more. And so it's not an unusual
question that a patient faces and their physicians face.&quot;
