How many of American drivers get an rate hike on their car insurance
lately? I am asking those without any claim and without any traffic
violation.

It looks to me the insurance industry has reached to a new height of power
play: they seem to think they are above the law. Insurance companies have
unlimited amount of money to lobby the corrupted law-makers to kill the
bills that serve the interests of the consumers while making up regulations
that serve the interests of the insurance industry.

The exploitation and the arrogance of the insurance must be stopped before
they destroy our lives. For those hard and honest working Americans, their
disposable incomes have been getting smaller every day and the insurance
industry is getting richer and more power every day. I am not sure if the
terrorists are any worse than the evil insurance industry.

"/> 0 claims, 0 violations. 20% increase. Thanks Allstate. I did shop around (as
always when renewing) and Allstate was still the cheapest.

What I find really disturbing is that to even shop around for rates now, all
the auto insurance carriers want to run credit checks... &lt;sarcasm&gt; I suppose
though, that if I was late on a payment sometime my AUTO insurance should go
up since I am now much more likely to be involved in an accident. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

While I understand your frustration, lets talk about a couple facts
here. I've got nothing to do with any insurance company for the
record.

"/> There are risks that come into play unrelated to your actions.
Meaning that claims and traffic violations aren't the only things that
generate your rate.

And insurance companies have definitely used the higher risks
associated with our new world (terrorism) to increase rates - no
question.

And insurance companies are not &quot;getting rich&quot; right now. Remember,
they make a lot of money from investing the dollars that you give them
in premiums. And I think you can understand that investment
performance have not been great until this year. Add to that pay outs
they have made as an industry in the since 9/11.

Don't get me wrong, insurance companies aren't hurting. But I don't
think it is as bad as you illustrate.

I've been with GEICO for 30 years and they have always helped

(alot!) when I turned 50.

Look at the type of drivers these companies have to insure,
and you soon know why the rates go up for some people:

*drunk + impaired (drugs) drivers

*drivers not paying attention because they are talking on cell
phones

*speeders who buy radar detectors and speed intentionally!

Where I live, the companies are quite brazen and cavalier about the
reasons for the enormous rate hikes over the last 18 months: They made
investments during the dotcom boom, those investments tanked and the
insurance companies are therefore losing money on the investments and
displeasing their shareholders, there are minimal regulations in most
places on insurance rates, so they're making up for the bad investments by
hiking rates.

Reduced to one sentence: They're doing it because they can.

Some insurance companies are publicly traded companies...go to Edgar and check
out their balance sheets and see if this is the case.

I've been lucky apparently. My rates with Geico have been pretty much the same
for years (so far) Although I have a pending claim, so that may end!

Insurance industry *IS* evil. There is NO QUESTION about this. Those who
support such industry - as seen in this thread - are fed by the industry
itself, despite their denials (perhaps for the sake of fake neutrality
appearance).

I have know someone who used to lobby for the insurance industry and from
whom I learned the dirty tricks the insurance industry used to manipulate
the laws to server their interests at the burden of the consumers.

It is nothing more than a legalized robbery and the insurance industry have
reserved itself a serious hole in HELL, where they will be burnt to
eternity.

So, cheer up consumers, eventhough you're being robbed by the evil
insurance industry, the people involved in this robbery will not go without
severe punishment. Let them soak in their own sin for now. The money they
rob from you will be used as fuel to burn them....forever.

notwithstanding. So yes, a radar detector can be a safety tool and it
has nothing to do with a &quot;big hurry&quot; although getting to one's
destination quicker is a nice side benefit. Google for &quot;85th
percentile&quot; both here (RAD) and web-wide, and you'll see what I mean.

major highways and ticket drivers traveling *below* the statistically
safest speeds.

the general public has been fed a steady dose of &quot;speed kills&quot;

The companies don't just have to be able to cover their typical level of

be capable of covering disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes that
require huge payouts even relative to the number of people they insure.

I drive on average 20K+ miles a year or more, which is well more than
the national average. (used to be far more, I used to have a 40 mile
commute each way once upon a time, and then my next job had me
traveling back and forth between Detroit and Sault Ste. Marie just
about every week in the winter.) Any incident that I've been involved
in in recent memory involves someone rear-ending *me* when I'm sitting
still (I did have two actual wrecks when I was younger, one involving
rain and fresh tar, the other a blown tire.) So your implication that
I'm an unsafe driver doesn't really cut it, thanks for playing.

Of course, the piss poor drivers out there don't help, I was actually
run off the road last night by some ricer in a fart-canned Integra
because he didn't notice me beside him. Thank you reflexes and ABS.

collusion does not have to be pre-arranged to be illegal. It does not

a way as to prevent new competition, and then work together to inflate
pricing, as the insurance companies do, that is illegal.

The way it works is that State Farm knows people can not easily change
to AllSucks, I mean AllState. This is because each one requires a
renewal notice from the other, which of course has your pricing on it.
Prices are not published, so you can not freely compare. The result
is that consumers have no &quot;free choice&quot; in insurance.

The end result is that one company can increase rates and know that
the rest will follow suit. Do you really think that if State Farm
doubled their price, that the others would think &quot;Hah, time to grab
market share!&quot;? Quite the contrary, they would simply double their
prices and laugh all the way to the bank.

&gt;Highly competitive? No market could ever even be called &quot;competitive&quot; as
&gt;long as the consumer has no choice but to BUY that market's product. Being
&gt;competitive means more than just looking like a better deal than the next
&gt;guy offers.

"/>  How about when there are no barriers to new competitors? Who is to stop
some college clique knowing a wealthy daddy or two who thinks there is
money to rake in starting a new auto insurance company...

In Pennsylvania literally hundreds of companies are licensed to sell
auto insurance... the list is somewhere in the state's website!

How about New Jersey over most of the past several years (most of the
past decade or two) having a law limiting the profit margin on any
company's auto insurance business in that state - I believe to 7%

I think at least my way, the problem is Philadelphia being so lax on
enforcing traffic laws that it is not too usual for someone to use the
parking lane to pass on the right of someone in the rightmost traffic lane
and signalling a right turn. First township west of the city (straight
west of downtown) is easy on moving violators, apparently since many
appear to be moving in from the city and if motivated to get off their
butts on election day would vote for the party that dominates the city
which is not the one in power in that township. Very common to see people
using turn-only lanes as passing lanes! And I know a couple intersections
not even nominated for Philadelphia's in-the-works-but-already-hated
red-light cameras where it is hard to find a 3 minute period without a
non-turning car enter the intersection 3 or more seconds after the light
turns red!
And how about Philadelphia having 60% of accidents resulting in injury
claims, the 4 counties closest to Philadelphia have about 1/3 of accidents
resulting in injury claims, and less than 1/5 of accidents elsewhere in PA
resulting in injury claims?
Philadelphia now has a &quot;Live Stop&quot; program that confiscates the cars of
moving violators who were stopped while not legally qualified to drive
(unlicensed or uninsured), and that was slowed by local politicians who
represent enough people who believe that &quot;the poor have a right to drive&quot;.
Another slowdown was from agency and union turf battles over who would tow
&quot;live-stopped&quot; vehicles. And moving violation enforcement remains so low
in Philadelphia that if 5% of violations resulted in collected fines the
city can probably abolish its taxes until its offending drivers cleaned up
their act or stopped driving...

I think the best evidence of insurance industry collusion (in PA at
least) is lack of availability of pay-by-the-mile policies. And I suspect
that if those got made available, there would be rate hikes for those who
drove moderate or moderately low but not really low mileage. Appears to
me lobbying on the part of an insurance industry lobbying organization,
although there are enough insurers in PA to give a competitive market.

investment markets to form bubbles and when a bubble forms, it will
attract some sort of a crowd that is betting that the bubble will grow
some more before it bursts...notably dot.com, NASDAQ stocks and &quot;growth
stocks&quot; even more than the stock market in general as of the very end of
the 20th century!

&gt;No, they are much more volatile, as interest rates can eat away the

"/>  Actually Treasury bonds and &quot;investment grade&quot; bonds in general tend to
be less volatile than stocks in general, unless you exclude stocks that
are reasonably knowable to have extra stability (such as utilities in
states having laws requiring utility-regulating agencies to largely
guarantee regulated utilities ability to be profitable).
Any downward mobility of bonds with less downward mobility of stocks is
due to the long-term trend of stocks outperforming bonds (due to &quot;risk
premium&quot;). In a majority of the 20-year year-by-year periods in the past
40 years or as far further back as one can make a useful comparison,
stocks in general mostly outperform bonds in general. Even though a bad
year for stocks in general was usually not as bad for bonds!

It appears to me that all US Treasury securities have, both from
issue-to-maturity and from
any-later-time-of-market-rate-purchase-to-maturity, among all that have
matured, have had positive rate of return.

It appears to me that &quot;tanking&quot; would be a permanent loss of principal,
often a total loss of principal. That is a risk of stocks, but no US
Treasury security has ever matured with a loss. That is why stocks (on an
average) in most years sell low enough that in most 30-year periods of the
past 60 years, it has been a good bet they would outperform bonds for the
next 30 years.

Your ignorant desire to compare bonds sold on the day you wish, to
stocks sold on the worst possible day, still makes stocks a better
value. The only way one can make stocks look worse than bonds is to
compare a single stock bought at the peak, and sold the day it goes to
zero. Other than that, bonds are the absolute worst investment anyone
can make, excluding those few individuals who need the money in the
next 5 years.

A couple of years ago many insurance cos added credit scores as a risk factor.
I see my insurance cos requests on my annual credit bureau report.
I dont think the insurance cos lowered anyone's rate due to their credit
score, but they probably raised bad credit risks significantly.
