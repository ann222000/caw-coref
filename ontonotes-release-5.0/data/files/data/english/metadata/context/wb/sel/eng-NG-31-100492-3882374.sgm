This is a 1996 Grand Caravan, 3.3L V6, 128k miles.

The van sat for about 2 weeks while we were out of town. We went to start it
today, and as soon as the key was turned to start, there was a click and
then everything went dead--guages, lights, everything.

Power comes back after a minute or two (so no fuse is blowing), after which
the same thing happens again if you try to start it.

Any guesses on this one? Are there any non-fused systems (like the starter
for example) that will cause this if they have a short?

Ok, I have this resolved. I pulled the starter relay and it no longer
shorted, so I figured it was the starter for sure. I rapped on it with a
hammer and it started just fine. I guess something in the starter was
shorting, but I can't begin to guess why. I live in a hot dry climate, so I
doubt anything rusted together in the two weeks the van sat. Here's hoping
it doesn't happen again.

Um.... why would the starter cause everything to not get power??? If you hit
the switch and the starter clicks and now you have no power at all why not
go to the main sorce that supplies the power??? The BATTERY!! dirty loose
connection.
