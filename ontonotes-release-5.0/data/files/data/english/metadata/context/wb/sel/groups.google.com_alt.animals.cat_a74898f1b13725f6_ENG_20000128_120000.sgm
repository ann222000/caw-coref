Hi, I have a 6 mth old kitten and she doesn't claw people or claw the
rug, but she does use the arms of our couch as a scratching post. I
have tried to get her to use a post, and tried the water bottle tactic
and yelling and so on....but she still does it. Now, I can handle it,
but my boyfriend can't, and feels we will never be able to own nice
furniture if she always does this. I don't want to declaw her, and
have him convinced she will stop when she gets older, since she mostly
does it when she is running around like a maniac. Does anyone know the
risks of declawing a cat, and what should I do?

Meow!!!Purrrrrr....

Do *NOT* declaw!!! Stick to your guns on this one. Try putting some
sticky tape on the arm of the couches, sticky side out, or tin foil. It
may not look great but it'll help. Another thing you can try. Go to the
local pet store and buy some Bitter Apple Spray. Spray it ONLY on the
arms of the couch, it'll make kitty want to avoid that spot. But please,
whatever you do, do NOT declaw!! It is cruel. To put it into human hand
terms, it is like removing your finger tips to the first knuckle, tendons,
ligaments, bone &amp; all. Very cruel.

Warmest wishes,
Rechelle

Don't do it!!
Go to  www.stickypaws.com . They sell these double sided strips of tape. You
can put them on your furniture, on woodwork, anywhere. They really truly
work.

the problem if you declaw a cat is that when she goes outside or even for a
cat who lives inside, should she one day escape and run outside, she will
not be able to escape from dangers such as dogs because she will not be able
to climb anymore, so you sentence her to death

Actually Jeff, no she's not. Declawed cats can no longer effectively defend
themselves from any predators. The purpose for claws is so the cat doesn't
have to get to close in a fight (as they would to bite). When they go in for a
bite, they leave themselves more vulnerable for injuries.

Hi Jeff,

Since we don't know in which outdoors environment the cat might escape once
declawed, no I don't think it is melodramatic. Cats can meet anything
outdoors, especially enemies (other animals).

Moreover, since declawing is basically a very painful operation (=
mutilation), I wouldn't mind at all using a little bit of melodrama if it
can make people think twice before deciding to have their cat declawed.

I totally agree that declawing he cruel, it's like removing a persons
fingernails. Here in the UK I doubt you could even get a vet to do the
operation.

Are we on this declawing issue again? ... not everyone agrees..
Not all of us let our cats run around where they can get hurt by not
having claws.. none of my four kitties complained when their claws were
taken and none of them have deformed feet... it didn't change their
personalities and I dont' have runs in my socks or scratches on my
furniture or holes in my draperies.. .. and my kitties love me.. I just
don't get the cruel and
inhumane idea.. doesn't compute.. and my vet didn't even bat an eyelash
at doing it... practically everyone I know with indoor cats has had them
declawed.. If I were home all day to keep the cats from scratching on
things.. maybe they could be trained not to scratch.. but we have to work
to pay the bills.. and so kitties have run of the house..

so now here comes the flames.. oh brother..

&gt; Sorry to piggyback Karen,

&gt; Jeff, currently there is a declawed cat running around my complex. She has
&gt; been hurt by other cats because she's been in fights and can't properly defend
&gt; herself. This is why you should *not* ever declaw a cat, not to mention that
&gt; it is maiming the cat and mutilating it's perfect feet.

Hardly takes a rocket scientist to train a cat, any idiot can do it. And of course
your vet didn't bat an eyelash, many won't because that takes away money from their
pocketbooks to refuse to do it. They're too selfish for the most part to do that.
I have 3 fully clawed cats, and beautiful furniture with no holes or shreds in them,
my draperies aren't shredded and my walls are fine. And they have the run of the
house too. It's the equivalent of removing to the first knuckle on a human hand,
maybe you'ld be willing to do that to see how you'ld enjoy it. Tendons &amp; ligaments
of course. Fool.

Hello Darlene Sue,

No flaming, just food for thought.

Have you ever made the effort to train a cat not to claw or to claw only
the scratching post?

Have you ever taken the time to clip a cat's claws?

Have you ever had surgery to remove a limb?

Do you know the phantom pain associated with amputations?

Human beings used to remove a women's ovaries when she became
hysterical; I suppose we are more civilized now?

If one of your 4 kitties chewed on a pillow cover, would you have all of
their teeth pulled?

Next time you get a kitty, would you please give it a chance to learn
where it can scratch and where it can't.

Thank you and good luck, Sandy in Laval, Quebec

My cat, Ballast, lives on a boat so her claws are very necessary to
remaining on the boat. I've seen her almost go over the side when she
was a kitten, but she always managed to get a claw into some wood and
get back up. I've been lucky she has never clawed anything or eaten any
plants. When she does dig into the rugs it means her claws are too long
so I clip them!
I took her to a vet once to be deflead and they ignored my request to
leave her claws alone. They clipped her claws so short they were
bleeding! We were p!$$ed needless to say.

Hi Jenny,

Thanks to Renaud (Leforestier), I finally got the information I was missing
about declawing. Like you, I thought it was just a &quot;declawing&quot; (= taking the
fingernails away) process which itself is already awful.

But, as Dana points out, it is far more like amputating every finger's first
joint. Go to have a look at these sites :
http://amby.com/cat_site/dc-wyntk.html
http://www.maxshouse.com

They both are very informative but you have to be ready to cry and be really
shocked by what you will see and read. (IMHO, try to pass the pictures as
fast as you can). But every one has to know what declawing really is.
Maybe if as many people as possible are informed about what they are about
to do to their pet, declawing will stop. I am still very angry at all vets
who agree to declaw because they KNOW what they are doing and yet, they
don't clearly explain the surgery process and its consequences, probably by
fear of frightening the customer away (... and lose money ?).

I honestly think that, just like long and careless transportation of animals
to slaughterhouses and scientific experimentation on animals finally start
to be considered as cruel and unnecessary, declawing will soon be largely
known as a cruel mutilation ... and maybe, in some years, definitely
forbidden !

I'm against the docking of dogs tails/cropping of ears and I regard the
declawing of cats much the same as the thought of removing a puppies
teeth just because it chews up a shoe. Animals have evolved into their
present form. This means that every bit of them is required in everyday
life whether we like it or not. We can't change nature just because it
doesn't fit into our lifestyle.

I agree with Jenny.

Seems that we have forgotten a long time ago that there was life and order
on this earth before the Human race and with a tiny chance, there will still
be some when human beings are long gone ...
Cats have claws, muscles and ligaments to hold them together and, to my
little narrow cat-terrorist's brain, if you cannot accept that and are too
frightened for your furniture's well-being, you shouldn't get a cat in the
first place. But the solution shouldn't be to declaw the cat, this is just
not fair.

I admire some vets very much and I've known at least one who wasn't even
able to make a correct injection (a vaccine) to my 3 month-old cat.
It's like in every other job, you have vets who are devoted and believe in
what they are doing, make extra unpaid hours in refugees etc ...
And you have some who just do it for the money, somehow they got bored or

"/> The whole thing was pretty bad. We took her in to be flead. In
addition to her claws bleeding they had drugged her so much she couldn't
stand up and to add insult to injury she had more fleas that when I took
her there! They said they had to drug her to bathe her, I reckon after
they hurt her feet she became a terror.

Ballast was born on a sailboat in Florida. After 8 weeks she came to
live on our boat. A couple months later we sailed up to Washington, DC.
where we lived at a marina. She swims well, doesn't like it, but we
trained her in Florida to swim to a bath towel hanging over the side and
climb back up onto the boat! When she was 3 years old we were invited
to sail with a friend from Florida to California. It would have been a
great trip if we hadn't run into that pesky hurricane!
To make a long story short the Coast Guard showed up and airlifted us
all off the boat in the middle of the night. It was blowing about 70mph
and the seas were 20foot. I put Ballast in out laundry bag, tied her
around my shoulders over the life jacket, and jumped over the side into
the rescue basket. The helicopter backed away from the boat, dragging
me and the cat deeply underwater. We went through 3 huge waves before
they winched me up. As soon as I got into the helo. I crawled to a
clear spot and tore open the bag. Her head popped out, with huge eyes
and the Coasties adopted her on the spot. They'd never rescued a cat
before! She's 15 now and doesn't do much besides eat and sleep, perhaps
dreaming of her adventures!

Sigh...

It seems this all began when I accused someone of being melodramatic about
&quot;DEATH SENTENCES&quot; et al...

I don't consider declawing inhumane.

My vet is a young man who has shown himself to be an animal lover with great
compassion (One of the few that will make house calls at no charge above a
clinic visit). He did not go through years of schooling just to cash in on
the cruelty of cat owners who would see all cats declawed. Yet, horrors on
horrors, he doesn't think twice about a declaw operation. Sorry, but he's
not the Dr. Mengele you'd like him to be.

My wife and I are cat lovers. We have five (the latest a rescuee from an
abandoned farm). We have only declawed some of our cats, not because of the
furniture (it's too far gone to worry about claws now!), but because two the
cats don't get along and were injuring each other badly. Since declawing
they are still wary of each other but no more blood spattered on walls or
infected cuts. And Thank God neither lost an eye! Once in a while they bat
at each other then go their seperate ways, but with no harm done.

All our cats are indoor cats. If any got out both my wife and I wouldn't
rest until they were home again. It goes without saying that we are VERY
careful that they don't get out!

The cats with claws have been provided with a nice scratch post in the
basement (a 4x4 post wrapped in carpet) which they love. In fact the
declawed cats like climbing it as well so I disagree that declawed cats
can't climb.

Is it cruel? Well... one of the declawed cats was a barn cat (our latest).
We chose to declaw him because although he is a wonderful, affectionate cat,
he is very territorial. He was near starvation when I rescued him (the
owners were moving away and were just going to leave him behind. He was very
malnourished and dehydrated. Anyway, my wife and I tried finding him a home
without much luck so we ended up keeping him. We discussed it at length
since two of our guys don't get along well and a new cat would only upset
things more...

Anyway... We took him to the vet, got him his shots, had him checked for
EVERYTHING and got a clean bill of health. So we brought him home and
sequestered him in the back bedroom until he could get his strength and get
to know us. As I said he's a VERY affectionate cat!

So after a few days we decided to introduce him to the rest of the family.
It didn't go well. Because a near starvation existance he's very territorial
and immediately attacked the other cats. One cat suffered severe lacerations
on his back in just the few seconds before we got a hold on him. That's what
lead us to declaw him. We intend to keep him and nurture him. We hope that
now that he has gained weight from an good diet, been neutered, etc. that we
can slowly introduce him to the other guys again without injuries to anyone.
He's doing well after the declawing and doesn't seem to be suffering. In
fact he is learning how to play (now that just surviving isn't an issue) and
we have to stop him sometimes because he gets so carried away.

Look.
We didn't declaw some of our cats for the fun of it. Or because our vet
recommended it ($$$). Or because we were worried about our furniture or
stockings. We declawed to ensure the safety of our cats. And not without
debate or attempts to alter the behaviour in other ways. It was after
infected cuts and blood on the walls.

Death sentence?

More like an act of love and compassion.

Believe me; I could find other things to spend $500.00 on than medical bills
for someone's barn cat. But I didn't.

I have to agree with you, there is a time and place for everything. I have a
declawed cat and one with claws. Anybody entering the house would not know
which was declawed and which wasn't..
They climb, play and scratch the post or any other suitable surface the
same. Both are indoor cats, as I don't believe in allowing cats to roam, I
consider it abuse considering the amount of cats run over by cars, killed by
other animals ( and people ) injuries from fights etc. It is no different a
operation, than spaying/neutering. I personally would rather see a happy
household, than another unwanted cat sitting in a shelter. Sometimes you
have to pick the worst of two evils, instead of following misguided

"/> No Jeff, sometimes it is just not possible anymore to be using nice
reasonable arguments and you have to let the frustration and the anger out.

I have read tons of messages from Rechelle and always, she is presenting an
incredible number of exact facts in a very polite way, trying to make
everybody understand what is the best for the cat.

I understand that the declawing issue is a very passionate one, I don't see
why I should be respectful to people who put their cat go thru declawing
(whether they know what it means or not), they are humans, they are the ones
making decisions for a cat who never asked anything. And it is SOOOOO tiring
to see that some people who have had their cat declawed still think that it
is just a minor operation, kind of a manucure. For all these reasons, I
understand why Rechelle and many others, including me, get aggressive
sometimes.

Of course, in a perfect world, we should always be able to make our point
without being rude or brutal.

But in a perfect world, there wouldn't be declawing ....

"/> For your information, go to  www.maxshouse.com  on the declawing page where
are listed numerous facts from vets, who are in the room when your cat wakes
up from a declawing operation.
They all say that the pain after declawing has nothing to do with the pain
after spaying, just like the two operations have nothing in common. I don't
remember hearing that they cut bones, ligaments and muscles when they spay a
cat ... (Declawing is an amputation.) They also say that no pain killer is
strong enough to calm the incrusiating pain.

But then again, everybody is entitled to their opinions even if they don't
have a clue what they are talking about.

Diane,

Perhaps you &amp; Jeff ought to go and have your fingers amputated to the first
knuckle, ligaments,tendons &amp; all. Then tell me that it doesn't hurt. Or wait,
better yet, have your TOES amputated to that first knuckle since the poor cats
have to walk on the amputated paw. Do it to the first knuckle on each toe and
then come back &amp; tell us how it feels. Well you're at it, get yourself spayed
so you can reproduce any children who have the same amount of ignorance as you.

Jeff,

Truly you can teach cats to get along, it just takes time &amp; patience. If not
then you shouldn't stress your cat out by having another cat there that they
don't like. You took the lazy way out Jeff and now you're trying to justify
it. I know of 1 (!) vet that refuses to declaw, every other vet will, because
of the money involved. To think otherwise is foolish. And I do commend you on
rescuing an abandoned cat, not many people will do that. But I con't condone
declawing nor can I accept pitiful excuses for doing it. The *only* reason for
declawing is for the cat, if it's a medical condition. Otherwise, there isn't
any.

&gt; they are still wary of each other but no more blood spattered on walls or
&gt; infected cuts. And Thank God neither lost an eye! Once in a while they bat
&gt; at each other then go their seperate ways, but with no harm done.

&gt; All our cats are indoor cats. If any got out both my wife and I wouldn't
&gt; rest until they were home again. It goes without saying that we are VERY
&gt; careful that they don't get out!

&gt; The cats with claws have been provided with a nice scratch post in the
&gt; basement (a 4x4 post wrapped in carpet) which they love. In fact the
&gt; declawed cats like climbing it as well so I disagree that declawed cats
&gt; can't climb.

&gt; Is it cruel? Well... one of the declawed cats was a barn cat (our latest).
&gt; We chose to declaw him because although he is a wonderful, affectionate cat,
&gt; he is very territorial. He was near starvation when I rescued him (the
&gt; owners were moving away and were just going to leave him behind. He was very
&gt; malnourished and dehydrated. Anyway, my wife and I tried finding him a home
&gt; without much luck so we ended up keeping him. We discussed it at length
&gt; since two of our guys don't get along well and a new cat would only upset
&gt; things more...

&gt; Anyway... We took him to the vet, got him his shots, had him checked for
&gt; EVERYTHING and got a clean bill of health. So we brought him home and
&gt; sequestered him in the back bedroom until he could get his strength and get
&gt; to know us. As I said he's a VERY affectionate cat!

&gt; So after a few days we decided to introduce him to the rest of the family.
&gt; It didn't go well. Because a near starvation existance he's very territorial
&gt; and immediately attacked the other cats. One cat suffered severe lacerations
&gt; on his back in just the few seconds before we got a hold on him. That's what
&gt; lead us to declaw him. We intend to keep him and nurture him. We hope that
&gt; now that he has gained weight from an good diet, been neutered, etc. that we
&gt; can slowly introduce him to the other guys again without injuries to anyone.
&gt; He's doing well after the declawing and doesn't seem to be suffering. In
&gt; fact he is learning how to play (now that just surviving isn't an issue) and
&gt; we have to stop him sometimes because he gets so carried away.

&gt; Look.
&gt; We didn't declaw some of our cats for the fun of it. Or because our vet
&gt; recommended it ($$$). Or because we were worried about our furniture or
&gt; stockings. We declawed to ensure the safety of our cats. And not without
&gt; debate or attempts to alter the behaviour in other ways. It was after
&gt; infected cuts and blood on the walls.

&gt; Death sentence?

&gt; More like an act of love and compassion.

&gt; Believe me; I could find other things to spend $500.00 on than medical bills
&gt; for someone's barn cat. But I didn't.

Thank you Karen. I try to help before I attack, but when this person starts
saying that declawing is ok and his vet doesn't discourage it, I tend to react
badly. But I always try to educate about declawing beforehand. It is
incredibly cruel and is becoming (very slowly though) to light in several states
as being animal abuse. I look forward to the day when it is illegal and
considered what it truthfully is, Horrible and inhumane animal abuse. I know
it's already illegal in the UK.

&gt; No Jeff, sometimes it is just not possible anymore to be using nice

&gt; I have read tons of messages from Rechelle and always, she is presenting an
&gt; incredible number of exact facts in a very polite way, trying to make
&gt; everybody understand what is the best for the cat.

&gt; I understand that the declawing issue is a very passionate one, I don't see
&gt; why I should be respectful to people who put their cat go thru declawing
&gt; (whether they know what it means or not), they are humans, they are the ones
&gt; making decisions for a cat who never asked anything. And it is SOOOOO tiring
&gt; to see that some people who have had their cat declawed still think that it
&gt; is just a minor operation, kind of a manucure. For all these reasons, I
&gt; understand why Rechelle and many others, including me, get aggressive
&gt; sometimes.

&gt; Of course, in a perfect world, we should always be able to make our point
&gt; without being rude or brutal.

&gt; But in a perfect world, there wouldn't be declawing ....

I didn't think I was being self-righteous...

And yes, I called you a Bitch, but I did so privately and in an attempt to
be ironic, not merely insulting.

And who are you calling &quot;boy&quot;? : )

But seriously; If I wasn't interested in your opinion would I continue to
contribute to this group? If I had no interest I could simply unsubscribe to
the group and blissfully go my way. Instead I'm offering you (and others)
the opportunity to present your arguments. But while I'm open to new ideas,
I am only so tolerant of abuse. If you want me to stick around and learn,
you'll have to be more polite.

How much would you have learned in college if your professor put more effort
into telling you how stupid and ignorant you were, than he did educating
you?

I think I've demonstrated that I am willing to take the time to present my
point of view without passing judgement on others. All I ask is that you
offer the same courtesy.

Unless your agenda is not to educate, but to turn this into the
alt.animals.cat.rechelle newsgroup - Members Only.

Jason,

Glad to hear that you're having her spayed. I can provide even more information
about the types of cancer that not fixing an animal can cause. Let me know if
you want to read it, just for information sake, since you've said you're going
to do it.

And you're right of course. I'm so against declawing though, that it's hard to
understand why people do it for their sake and not for the cats. I can
understand if it's for the cats health (medical reasons) but not for furniture
or curtains sakes. People must remember that cats are living, breathing
creatures who do feel pain. I've seen several cats that have been declawed that
have had bad lasting reactions. I'm glad that yours didn't, but it does happen.

I'm off my soapbox right now. Til the next time! *G*

To compensate, we play a lot with our two cats and go to the balcony

taught

"/> I let my cats out because where I live, in the country I feel that if my
cats can go outside then it is more 'natural'. I know in this world
'natural' doesn't exactly exsist esp as we are talking domesticated
animals here. My cats do have a litterbox in the house and I don't let
them out just so they can do their 'business'.
Even if they were kept inside, I'd still have them neutered incase they
accidently got out.

I agree with you... but, please...
This is NOT a special answer to your message, but a reaction to SOME messages of
the thread;
Please, &quot;all of us&quot;, don't you think time has come for a truce?
Shouldn't we make an effort to preserve the friendliness of this NG?
Isn't it normal to find different opinions expressed in a group?
Have personal attacks ever changed somebody's mind?

Destroying the usual courtesy of the group wouldn't make our beloved cats
happier.

&gt;&gt; Sorry people have to disagree with you. I own declawed and clawed cats,
&gt;&gt; there is no difference between them. They can climb and protect themselves
&gt;&gt; equally. You would never know which was declawed and which wasn't. Maybe
&gt; you
&gt;&gt; could explain why it is cruel?

&gt; www.maxshouse.com
&gt; Hold your breath as you read the comments of vets who are in the room when
&gt; your cat wakes up after the declawing operation and explain why it has
&gt; nothing to do with the spaying operation.
&gt; Hold your breath and swallow your tears as you go thru the pictures of what
&gt; can happen in some 30% of the cases, when an infection starts on the
&gt; amputated paws.
&gt; And finally, come back here, a little bit more informed and tell us again
&gt; that both declawed and fully clawed cats can defend themselves in the same
&gt; way because if so, it is physically a miracle.

Might I suggest you talk with a wider selection of people.

Face it, a male or female kitty truly suffers when he or she is left
unaltered. These poor creations are literally out of there minds with
wanting to mate. Imagine yourself being healthy and in the prime of your
life, living with your spouse or mate and never sharing physical intimacy.
Many couples would find this unacceptable, as do I.

I believe, this is what the kitty experiences.

So, in addition to wanting to prevent unwanted kittens and other reasons,
protecting the cat's &quot;sanity&quot; is also an important reason for
spaying/neutering.

Dana,

Sorry to piggyback this is to Diane.

Diane,

Spay/Neutering has *many* health benefits. Anything from cancers to
keeping them from trying to roam and either hurting themselves in an
effort to get outside or if they do get outside, from getting into
fights. If you wish, I can post a list of different cancers that
spay/neutering is preventative. It is incredibly scary. Every time a
female comes into heat, you are increasing her risks of cancers by 1/3.
So for me, spaying &amp; neutering wasn't about saving my nose from
horrendous smells, but as a way to extend the life of my cats. To think
anything else is *incredibly* foolish and naive. As for declawing you
really don't know much about the procedure do you? They are removing to
the first knuckle on the cats foot. Claw, bone, tendons, ligaments,
everything. To see what this is actually like, go to the Declawing link
at  http://www.maxshouse.com  or go to
http://lisaviolet.simplenet.com/cathouse/declaw.html
Or go to
http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pointe/9352/declaw.html  and see what
this surgery truly includes. Many cats have behavioural problems or
health problems as their owners don't believe that they need to switch
litter for a couple weeks to prevent infection. It is the equivalent of
removing part of your toes to the first knuckle. Or fingers. It is
incredibly inhumane and is illegal in the UK and many states as well as
Canada are currently debating this as making it illegal.

Please go to these sites, they may help you understand this horrendous
procedure a little better.

Sincerely,
Rechelle

respect the opinion -- not necessarily the person -- of those with whom I

I must agree.
I think we are losing sight of the fact that everyone here is a cat lover.
If they weren't they'd be elsewhere. Not everyone will agree with everyone
and to try to assert your ideals over others serves no useful purpose. I've
said it before; Educate, not castigate (it's a good line so I'm sticking
with it).

State your case. Support your arguments. Respect each other. No one here is
neutering/declawing for the selfish joy of it. None of us takes pleasure in
the suffering of animals. We may do the wrong thing for the right reasons,
but it is for the right reasons... because we care.

This debate might as well be about spanking children or the theory of
evolution...

Ridiculing each other accomplishes nothing.

Whisper, and people will listen.

SO KNOCK IT OFF!

Hello Ronald,

I am delighted to know that declawing is forbidden in Holland. Is there
a web site I can look up to find the ruling on this? Or perhaps you can
provide me with the mailing address where I can send away for the
information. I would like to see this rule used in Canada and the USA.

Thank you. Sandy in Laval, Quebec

That is a bit overstated. We ARE animal lovers and have a declawed cat
(front only).

There are four cats in our family, ironically the only one to be declawed
was the only cat we sought out. The other three are all strays or give
aways to save them from being euthenized.

The declawed one, mokie, lost her claws when we were living in an apartment,
sneaking in two more cats than we were allowed. She just could not stop
clawing their brand new carpet. It was declaw or death! Sorry, but that
was the practicality of the matter. The likelihood that some one else would
adopt her was less than 50%. This way she gets to live a long and YES happy
life.

BTW, the cats all get along well (or we make them). She is not
disadvantaged in the pecking order because of a lack of front claws. We
have moved into a home with a large back yard and all cats go outside. The
only thing about mokie is that her lack of claws keeps her from killing the
birds she would like to. The other cats with claws are quite good hunter,
though we certainly do NOT encourage their activities. The yard is fenced
so she and the others are safe. None of the cats, except the male, go over
the fence.

So declawing may limit a cats ability to defend themselves, but it does not
always lead to their death. In fact, in this case it saved her life, most
likely!

&gt; Hi Jeff,

&gt; Since we don't know in which outdoors environment the cat might escape
once
&gt; declawed, no I don't think it is melodramatic. Cats can meet anything
&gt; outdoors, especially enemies (other animals).

&gt; Moreover, since declawing is basically a very painful operation (=
&gt; mutilation), I wouldn't mind at all using a little bit of melodrama if it
&gt; can make people think twice before deciding to have their cat declawed.
