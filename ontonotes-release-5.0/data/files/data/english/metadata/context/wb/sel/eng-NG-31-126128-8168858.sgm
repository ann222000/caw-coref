In some societies age is revered.  People gather round elders to hear
what they have to say because their experience is considered an
extremely valuable commodity.

In our western culture people often sneer at age and mock the signs of
it.  It appears to hold great fear for them.  The last taboo.

Dylan has been both young and old.  He has also been middle-aged.

Agatha Christie:

&quot; I have enjoyed greatly the second blooming that comes when you
finish the life of the emotions and of personal relations; and
suddenly find - at the age of fifty, say - that a whole new life has
opened before you, filled with things you can think about, study, or
read about...It is as if a fresh sap of ideas and thoughts was rising
in you.&quot;

Having just read a review of a Dylan show that spent most of its words
attacking the ageing process I wonder if the young-ish and moderately
old citizens of RMD have any thoughts on ageing.

Do you feel you have more wisdom now than you did in your early
twenties?

I feel have more, I'm not sure wisdom now is exactly the right word
but I'm not sure what is(at 30) but less energy/inclination to share
it! The curse of getting older ha,ha.

The older and older I grow, the less and less I know. I am in a state
of perpetual confusion. My head spins round on a 23 degree axis, and
is loaded with growing parasitic thoughts, attached to me by gravity.

I was once asked for an essay for school, if I could meet a famous
person, who would I want to meet, and why. I didn't wanna meet nobody,
I was at a loss for words, I finally decided upon Agatha Christe, I
said I would like to invite her over for dinner, and plan a mystery
for her to solve. The Murder of Roger Ackyroyd was the scariest book I
had ever read. Needless to say, I did not get into this college. LOL!

SIng it with me folks, &quot;I'm a LOSER!&quot; (Maybe I should go to the John
Lennon group, especially since Dylan don't like me. My life sucks.)

I AM IN THE WORST MOOD OF MY LIFE.

Maybe what I should have written was this.

I would invite Robert Allen Zimmerman to dinner, and ply him with
lotsa of pecan pie, and slip some roofies in his drink, and say,
Please Mr. Dylan, I don't wanna go to college. I'm never gonna make
it. My mother always warned me that my poor study habits were gonna
catch up to me, and I don't know shit about diddly squat, I really
like your music, please take me away with you, I'll blow you every
night, I don't wanna go to college, I never did, I wanted to finish
high school, and then go back to Israel, and make aliyah, and go into
the gareen, and then matriculate at the Univerisity in Jerusalem, and
then go back to my kibbutz and work and marry Tal and have his babies,
but he dumped right after I made arrangements to stay and I was so
humiliated, I became seriously bulimic,and got really thin, and was
really really pretty, but I didn't care, because my heart was broken,
and I love no one or nothing else but you, you are my hero, please
save me.

And then Dylan would dig his bootheels into the ground, spin around,
and walk about of my loser life forever, and then I would swallow all
my bottles of pills (this is an anachronistic story), and this time
not call anybody, and end my stupid fucking miserable life forever.

For me, most definitely. I know you've heard it said, how you wish you knew

Sometimes the terminologies we use do get in the way of some increased
unifying aspect of our  larger circle, of a more expansive and
sophisticated system of sorts. Have you ever thought of a reality made
of sophisticated simplicity? One of  elegant sophistication?

But I don't wish to digress  far and my central question is hereby the
following :

What do 'you  mean by &quot;nature&quot;?

and then :
WJ, would you be willing to expand on what this term refers to in your
language? What's your take on it ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; In some societies age is revered.  People gather round elders to hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; what they have to say because their experience is considered an
&gt; &gt; &gt; extremely valuable commodity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In our western culture people often sneer at age and mock the signs of
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.  It appears to hold great fear for them.  The last taboo.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dylan has been both young and old.  He has also been middle-aged.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Agatha Christie:

&gt; &gt; &gt;    &quot; I have enjoyed greatly the second blooming that comes when you
&gt; &gt; &gt; finish the life of the emotions and of personal relations; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; suddenly find - at the age of fifty, say - that a whole new life has
&gt; &gt; &gt; opened before you, filled with things you can think about, study, or
&gt; &gt; &gt; read about...It is as if a fresh sap of ideas and thoughts was rising
&gt; &gt; &gt; in you.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Having just read a review of a Dylan show that spent most of its words
&gt; &gt; &gt; attacking the ageing process I wonder if the young-ish and moderately
&gt; &gt; &gt; old citizens of RMD have any thoughts on ageing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you feel you have more wisdom now than you did in your early
&gt; &gt; &gt; twenties?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Mr Jinx

&gt; &gt; For me, most definitely. I know you've heard it said, how you wish you
knew
&gt; &gt; now, what you didn't know then.
&gt; &gt; I believe I am wiser now and wish I had this in my youth but glad at
least I
&gt; &gt; can say that I am wiser now and haven't remained the same or became less
&gt; &gt; intelligent. Now that wouldn't be a good thing, would it?

&gt; &gt; ~Barbara~

&gt;  not  sure but i am tempted to agree.
&gt;  surely glad to see you on board.   is really real coming too?

I most definitely feel wiser. I think it's hard not to if you have any
sense of growth; if you treat life as a learning experience, learn
from your past mistakes; try to figure out what works in your best
interest and what doesn't. I felt very wise when I was in my 20s but
looking back I was experiencing tunnel vision. What about Dylan's
line: I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now? I've always
been intrigued by that line and think it's a strange reversal. Could
he be implying that his thoughts and ideas as a younger man were more
limited by his age, and now that he's older, his experiences have
freed him; made him younger?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Mr Jinx

&gt; &gt; I may be wiser, but I was much closer to my nature then.

&gt; Sometimes the terminologies we use do get in the way of some increased
&gt; unifying aspect of our  larger circle, of a more expansive and
&gt; sophisticated system of sorts. Have you ever thought of a reality made
&gt; of sophisticated simplicity? One of  elegant sophistication?

&gt; But I don't wish to digress  far and my central question is hereby the
&gt; following :

&gt; What do 'you  mean by &quot;nature&quot;?

&gt; and then :
&gt; WJ, would you be willing to expand on what this term refers to in your
&gt; language? What's your take on it ?

&gt; - Just Curious  a.k.a  Tif
">

When I was younger, I was far less socialized and much more in tune
with my instincts and intuition. Now I have to put up with far more
mediation and contemplation only to find out that my original
instincts and intuition were sound all along. Seems I made better
decisions when I didn't think about things so much! It's as if the
flak of life has clogged my ears to sounds I discerned easily back
them.

I am only wiser now in that I know this!

No. I am more disillusioned and closer to death, perhaps sadder but no

Nope, Wisdom remains like the Rocky Mountains when you're driving

Dudley, I am with you on that one, most of the time. When
innerested , when  not holding on  to any calculations or expectations
of outcomes,  the language can become a free flowing fountain, a
colorful display of sparks, or an underground and almost invisible
river, a vehicle on which dragonflies can ride, rest, until ready to
lift up .  When this happens, understanding can be experienced for
what it truly is: standing under. Under what? you may ask. Under the
glow of love and under a higher power that communicates in flashes,
flashes of wisdom, very brief revelatory flashes, flashes of the
eternal entering  our biological life. Little glimpses of
understanding may -or may not- be consciously remembered every time
our energetic system gets flooded with the love a boundless creator
bestows on us when we learn to release our need to try to control our
lives and the lives of others... through conventional language,
thought, etc... etc... etc... Convention is not among the most
favorite words of the Creator, creativity is.

I will for now innerest my words not too far from yours in this  rmd
terrain full of rocks, sand, streams and wild flowers.   It feels wise
to do this. What does not feel to me  wise is the making  of wisdom
into the  primary goal,  not  in our days and ages anyway. Better to
appreciate her, wisdom, as  the extra bonus that will land on you for
brief moments and fill you with a sense of truer aliveness and
wonder.  If one  grasps at wisdom, like at another social commodity --
to enhance and aggrandize one's own personality-- wisdom will either
quickly dissipate or harden into something else, something too rigid
to flow freely like wisdom must.   Better to let it remain the gift
it is, a gift from the highlands, a gift of the creator coming
through; for when wisdom from on high is invited to couple with the
humble sincerity of one below, it has more landing pads on which to
grow and prosper.  And then suddenly, not one time but many, you're
there and you get to flow with it for a while. Let go of the need to
be wise and wisdom may come to you. Hold on tight and it will escape
you.

211th Chorus, from Mexico City Blues

The wheel of the quivering meat conception
Turns in the void expelling human beings,
Pigs, turtles, frogs, insects, nits,
Mice, lice, lizards, rats, roan
Racinghorses, poxy bubolic pigtics,
Horrible, unnameable lice of vultures,
Murderous attacking dog-armies
Of Africa, Rhinos roaming in the jungle,

Vast boars and huge gigantic bull
Elephants, rams, eagles, condors,
Pones and Porcupines and Pills-
All the endless conception of living beings
Gnashing everywhere in Consciousness
Throughout the ten directions of space
Occupying all the quarters in &amp; out,
