Evening all

Has anyone had any experience with Media4 cable tv? I got hooked up with
them today and it seems the signal comes down the same line my internet
connection. I have  a hub that splits my internet connection and my tv. The
picture is shocking, I have seen better quality on You tube videos. I really
only got this as it was the only provider that has the Australia network. I
am hoping there is something I can do to improve the picture, but I doubt
it. I just bought a nice sony tv, and it is such a shame to have such a crap
picture on it.

arse.

cheers

Just a thought...
Maybe you have an issue with your co-axle fittings also if there is a
splitter or a lot of connections you may be getting a bad pic from those.

What sort of internet connection are you on? You need at least a
6-8Mbps connection to get a decent picture apparently.

Provided you have a fast enough connection, change the picture quality
setting to high quality (高画質) instead of the default (標準画質) and you
should see an improvement in the picture quality.

thanks vm, it is streaming after all so I guess I cant expect much. I am on
a 100Mbit connection. The TV guy came out  again and had a look and said
this was about the best I could expect. For streaming I suppose it is OK,

Thanks for your help
