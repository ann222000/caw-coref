If you refer to

http://www.fai.org/gliding/bureau2006_2

minutes of the FAI Gliding Commission Bureau meeting,
you will find:

'A2.8 Discussion on Class structure in the “light-end”
RS explained the problem we have at the light end,
where a fairly limited number of aircraft are divided
into 3 categories.

It was decided to work towards a solution where the
existing World Class was extended to include the other
gliders after 2009. This could e.g. be with a max take
off weight of 300 kg, including motor gliders, and
possibly with max. 13 meter wingspan. The PW-5 should
be allowed under grandfather rules.
Action: RS and AR to develop year-2 proposal for extension
of the World Class after 2009.
Action: BH to check the FAI rules about changing a
class definition.

It was not considered worth creating a competition
class for the “less than 80 kg” class.'

This seems to indicate that from 2009 aircraft other
than PW-5s will be eligible to compete in a new World
Class.  Heads up for Sparrowhawks and Russias, among
others.

Richard,

The original idea behind the World Class has been a failure. That much
is obvious (to me) and should be acknowledged.  We need to try a new
and different idea.  I can see opening the PW5 only contests to
similar designs to increase the number of gliders. More gliders would
mean a better competition.

I personally would propose the following criteria:

a) Fairly strict 1 design.
b) Decent performance for the cheapest cost.

For decent performance I think 35/1 would be good enough.  Lower
performance is just frustrating when trying XC.

I would not &quot;dumb down&quot; the design to accommodate early solo pilots,
but aim for entry level comp pilots.

Todd,
OK, some of the aspects of original idea had to be a failure and the
whole undertaking simply didn't work.
But, can you tell which specs were wrong?

* substantially lower costs than then-current new gliders
* easy &amp; safe handling in the air and on the ground
* a single design, stabilized for a period of years
* performance sufficient for badges &amp; challenging competition
* simple construction
* suitable for clubs, private owners &amp; early solo pilots.

What would be your new World Class glider ?
Try to stay below $ 60,000.-please.

Bad idea to require suitability for early solo pilot.  This led to
unneeded &quot;dumbing down&quot; of the design.  Specific features such as the
nose wheel and non-retractable landing gear.  It also leads to
sacrificing performance for easier handling.

I think that the design point to aim for is a glider that a newly
licensed pilot, who has done some XC in a club glider and wants a
glider to fly, would find roughly comparable to a Grob 102, Std
Cirrus, LS4.   The possiblilty of one design competition would be a
good additional incentive to buy the &quot;2nd generation&quot; world class
glider.  But the glider would have to be similar in performance to
other gliders that the new XC pilot might also want.

Maybe the new Sparrowhawk or Silent has enough performance for cheap
enough ?  Maybe build Std Cirrus's or LS4's.  Simplify the
construction if needed.  But if a design can not be found that has
sufficiently good performance for a low enough price, then the world
class idea will never work.

It doesn't have to be 50/1, but it does have to be good enough that
weak days are not so painful.

If I recall correctly, the major aim of the World Class
concept was to make competition soaring more accessible
by keeping the cost down.  The lower performance level
and the single-design concepts arose from this aim
[one design to allow mass production and the savings
therefrom].  Unfortunately the masses did not buy the
PW-5.

Perhaps a reasonable class could be built from all
the 13m and below sailplanes that are now around, typically
with 30 or 35:1 L/Ds and easier retrieve characteristics
than bigger ships.  A set of rules can be built around
the existing designs without denying entry to newer
and better designs.  Contrary to advertised beliefs,
30:1 is plenty for X-C [20:1 is plenty for the 1-26
guys].

But how do we keep the cost under control ?  Well,
my only semi-facetious suggestion would be to have
a rule that the top three in any National-level contest
have to offer their ships, fully equipped as flown,
for sale at a fixed price immediately afterwards.
Take $40,000 as a random number.  Will anyone really
want to buy a championship with a $60,000 ship if he
has to sell it for $40,000 afterwards ?  It would be
snapped up.  But the $20,000 ship that wins would probably
not be sellable at $40,000 and the owner could keep
it to fly another day.

As a reference point, the Sparrowhawk is perhaps the
highest performance 13m ship around, and I believe
it still sells for below $40,000.  And my aging Russia
would be competitive; it cost me $19,000 new a few
years ago; even with a trailer and flight recorder
and oxygen etc and CA sales tax, it still came in at
well below $25,000.

It could be done.  With 60 or so Russias, maybe 50
PW-5s, a growing number of Sparrowhawks and a sprinkling
of Apis and Silents we should have a viable nucleus
of a fleet.  And if it works, more people may be enticed
to join in affordable competive soaring.

It's nice to hear there is now consideration to expand the world class
beyond the PW5. I've enjoyed the last two Region 9 competitions flying
my L33. The Solo was designed as a candidate for the world class one
design and, as of this year, has the identical hadicap as the PW5 for
SSA Sports class and OLC. Hopefully it will also be considered as
eligible for the expanded world class.

Russia, Sparrowhawk, Apis, Silent, L33, PW-5.......   you all are very
welcome in Club B .

Why you need to include them into World Class ?.Why pretend that
this odd bunch of  gliders makes a One Design Class ? They are a very
different gliders. They do not have much in common. O, maybe except
for fact that nobody can make any profit on their production.
Leave the PW-5 alone. If it as a World Class die...it will die, let it
be.  Possibly with a Club B we don't need a World Class at all.

Cheap with performance...then lets pitch the one design(which
is really who can trick out their ship the most and
gain L/d, thus defeating the concept)  Run any ship
within certain handicaps...a range that go from Russias
and PW5 up to LS4?  Keep the handicap.

One can try to get the cheapest glider with the best
handicap, or something a little more expensive that
takes a bigger hit.  Not including LS4's in this group
would be a big mistake IMVHO, they are good performers
and relatively cheap used...is that not the objective?

I don't think so, as the usual &quot;tricks&quot; won't add more than a few
percentage points, and are available to all of the competitors anyway.

In any case, the cost of these &quot;tricks&quot; is a lot less than the &quot;tricks&quot;
the manufacturers can add to their new gliders, and then the competitors
do the usual tricks in addition. New glider + usual tricks is a
significant gain in performance and cost.

The World Class is a dead end, replaced by the highly successful Club
Class:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_Competition_Classes#Club_Class

The FAI should just let it quietly die. Back in 1989 there were no old
plastic gliders to populate what could be a &quot;club class&quot; and so a low-
cost &quot;entry-level&quot; design made sense, but nearly twenty years on
there's just no point in flying such a compromised aircraft as the
PW5. For a fraction of the cost of a new one, you can just pick up a
used Cirrus, Grob or Libelle and get a glider with considerably better
performance, and compete in the Club Class if you want to.

&quot;Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.&quot;

I know most of you want soaring to grow and know that the rising cost
of gliders threaten the sport. Don't you wonder why a few people are
trying to kill World Class?  Perhaps these are some of the reasons:

Diminished impact. - A few pilots want to impress others with their
terrific flight. They may not want to share the glory with a person
flying a ship costing a fraction of what they spent.  Recent World
records speak volumes about the PW 5's suitability for long tasks,
even over difficult terrain. We are just beginning to see what the
ship can do. Does the growing list of people who frequently fly 300K
or better threaten the justifications for spending huge sums of money
on other glass ships?

Not part of a close group- Even at contest, where protests abound, the
PW 5 group is enjoying themselves.  The only thing that is not easy to
do with a PW 5 is come up with excuses for losing in a contest.  It is
the pilot not the plane.

Safety.  This sturdy, high winged, easy to fly ship makes land-outs
easy. A very ill-informed contributor to this group suggested that a
PW 5 couldn't deal with strong lift.  I have flown in wave and in
thermals in Cal. City, Minden, and Parowan with confidence in a well-
tested design.

Makes the &quot;club&quot; less exclusive - I became a cross-county pilot and
fly in contests because I fly a ship I can afford. Modest initial
cost, inexpensive insurance, zero maintenance - all contribute to my
being able to fly all over the country.

I don't need to explain to you that one class design is the way to
build our sport.  Look at one design sailboats.  I have never heard a
J Boat owner berate a Sunfish enthusiast. Maybe it's because he/she
learned to sail in that boat. If the World Class loses its one design
status, we will be back to people buying their way into the winner's
circle.

Most of you don't feel threatened by the World Class glider. Why not
support the ideals that brought World Class into existence?

Time to update your knowledge to at least the 1980s, when the LS4,
Discus, and other gliders showed you don't have to sacrifice performance
to have a glider with wonderful, forgiving handling.

&gt; &gt; &gt; there's just no point in flying such a compromised aircraft as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; PW5. For a fraction of the cost of a new one, you can just pick up a
&gt; &gt; &gt; used Cirrus, Grob or Libelle and get a glider with considerably better
&gt; &gt; &gt; performance, and compete in the Club Class if you want to.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dan

&gt; &gt; The PW5 as a world class glider is dead and will fade away.  But a
&gt; &gt; cheaper one-design class is still a good idea.  It might not ever
&gt; &gt; happen, but it's a good idea.

&gt; &gt; Todd

&gt; &quot;Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.&quot;

&gt; I know most of you want soaring to grow and know that the rising cost
&gt; of gliders threaten the sport. Don't you wonder why a few people are
&gt; trying to kill World Class?  Perhaps these are some of the reasons:

&gt; Diminished impact. - A few pilots want to impress others with their
&gt; terrific flight. They may not want to share the glory with a person
&gt; flying a ship costing a fraction of what they spent.  Recent World
&gt; records speak volumes about the PW 5's suitability for long tasks,
&gt; even over difficult terrain. We are just beginning to see what the
&gt; ship can do. Does the growing list of people who frequently fly 300K
&gt; or better threaten the justifications for spending huge sums of money
&gt; on other glass ships?

&gt; Not part of a close group- Even at contest, where protests abound, the
&gt; PW 5 group is enjoying themselves.  The only thing that is not easy to
&gt; do with a PW 5 is come up with excuses for losing in a contest.  It is
&gt; the pilot not the plane.

&gt; Safety.  This sturdy, high winged, easy to fly ship makes land-outs
&gt; easy. A very ill-informed contributor to this group suggested that a
&gt; PW 5 couldn't deal with strong lift.  I have flown in wave and in
&gt; thermals in Cal. City, Minden, and Parowan with confidence in a well-
&gt; tested design.

&gt; Makes the &quot;club&quot; less exclusive - I became a cross-county pilot and
&gt; fly in contests because I fly a ship I can afford. Modest initial
&gt; cost, inexpensive insurance, zero maintenance - all contribute to my
&gt; being able to fly all over the country.

&gt; I don't need to explain to you that one class design is the way to
&gt; build our sport.  Look at one design sailboats.  I have never heard a
&gt; J Boat owner berate a Sunfish enthusiast. Maybe it's because he/she
&gt; learned to sail in that boat. If the World Class loses its one design
&gt; status, we will be back to people buying their way into the winner's
&gt; circle.

&gt; Most of you don't feel threatened by the World Class glider. Why not
&gt; support the ideals that brought World Class into existence?
">

I don't know if this is directed at me, but I'll respond anyway.

I support most of the ideals of the World Class concept, except for
the &quot;early solo&quot; pilots part.  But the specific design criteria that
resulted in the PW5's low performance is what killed the class, not
disdain from other pilots.  When I've been to contests where there was
a PW5 flying, they did not seem to be having much fun, because they
landed out all the damn time.

People keep comparing to sailboat one design racing, but there is a
big difference between sailing a Sunfish in weak conditions and flying
a PW5 in weak conditions, the PW5 lands out and the Sunfish does NOT
sink.  Avoiding landing out in weak conditions is why a minimum of
performance is needed.

The only way I can support the &quot;World class&quot; is to buy one myself or
with a club.  But before I did this, the glider has to have enough
performance that I would have fun.  So I express what I think should
be changed to allow this to happen. This doesn't mean that I am
threatened, but I feel the concept has not been well executed.

In fact, by choosing the PW-5 it commited suicide.

The market has decided.  Face it - there are simply very few people

Sharing the glory is not part of the problem.
The problem is that extremely few pilots love to spend big $$$ on a
glider whose performance is inferior to even basic two-seat trainers,
not to mention 1st-generation glass gliders like Libelle, ASW-15 et
cetera that can be bought for one third of the price for PW-5 - and

Depends on the definition of a &quot;long task&quot;. The PW-5 offers the same
performance as an ancient Ka-6E - but today's pilots standards are way

Then why doesn't the PW5 have better performance ?

Trade offs between handling and performance might be:
span, easier handling with lower span.
wing loading, high for performance, low for safety, happy medium ?
airfoil and twist for better performance or stall ?
fixed gear vs retract.
high wing for safety vs lower drag mid wing ?

All of these items can be optimized one way or the other.  The LS4/
Discus got a really good happy medium with both good handling and
performance.  If the PW5 had near the performance of either of these
gliders, I would own a PW5, but the PW5 does not.

What killed the World Class was the World Class.
When the PW5 was awarded the World Class against a lot of opposition to the
design the proponents of the PW5 sat back fielding criticism and smugly
snubbed the others even after it was well apparent that few were going to
get on their band wagon.
Others that contended for the bid to be the world class glider and their
followers were shut out and left with no place to compete. There were other
good design entrants (most thought better than the committee picked PW5) and
rumors of unfair politics deciding on the PW5 clouded the class.
How the PW5 was picked over the other designs remains a topic of some
controversy but it was and it failed to gather the interest of the masses
(it really is homely) but there were however many other gliders that were in
contention for the title sold that already meet much the original design
criteria. If these models were all lumped together with the existing PW5
gliders the potential is there for a successful competition class to yet
emerge.... Call it World Class or whatever you like but stick with the
gliders already produced and there is no need to go through the process
another time only to end up with the same dismal results.
There is no need to start including Grob Astirs, Cirrus, LS4 and the likes
of these since they already fit nicely into the Club Class (The USA needs
also to finally adopt the rest of the worlds &quot;Club Class&quot; and &quot;Racing Class&quot;
rather than continuing to disguise Ventus 2's and ASW27's and the likes as
&quot;Sports class&quot; gliders)and there is no reason to start looking for a new
alternative &quot;World Class&quot; design... Simply include the L-33's, SZD solo,
Russia in with the PW5's and let them fight it out in a fair and balanced
contest.....choose your weapon and go into battle..... low cost, lower
performance racing.....easy enough.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Soon we will see a very good 13m glider ....for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;$120,000.-only.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; And the happy owner will be a World Class Champion.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Was that an original idea behind the World Class?

&gt; If I recall correctly, the major aim of the World Class
&gt; concept was to make competition soaring more accessible
&gt; by keeping the cost down.  The lower performance level
&gt; and the single-design concepts arose from this aim
&gt; [one design to allow mass production and the savings
&gt; therefrom].  Unfortunately the masses did not buy the
&gt; PW-5.

&gt; Perhaps a reasonable class could be built from all
&gt; the 13m and below sailplanes that are now around, typically
&gt; with 30 or 35:1 L/Ds and easier retrieve characteristics
&gt; than bigger ships.  A set of rules can be built around
&gt; the existing designs without denying entry to newer
&gt; and better designs.  Contrary to advertised beliefs,
&gt; 30:1 is plenty for X-C [20:1 is plenty for the 1-26
&gt; guys].

&gt; But how do we keep the cost under control ?  Well,
&gt; my only semi-facetious suggestion would be to have
&gt; a rule that the top three in any National-level contest
&gt; have to offer their ships, fully equipped as flown,
&gt; for sale at a fixed price immediately afterwards.
&gt; Take $40,000 as a random number.  Will anyone really
&gt; want to buy a championship with a $60,000 ship if he
&gt; has to sell it for $40,000 afterwards ?  It would be
&gt; snapped up.  But the $20,000 ship that wins would probably
&gt; not be sellable at $40,000 and the owner could keep
&gt; it to fly another day.

&gt; As a reference point, the Sparrowhawk is perhaps the
&gt; highest performance 13m ship around, and I believe
&gt; it still sells for below $40,000.  And my aging Russia
&gt; would be competitive; it cost me $19,000 new a few
&gt; years ago; even with a trailer and flight recorder
&gt; and oxygen etc and CA sales tax, it still came in at
&gt; well below $25,000.

&gt; It could be done.  With 60 or so Russias, maybe 50
&gt; PW-5s, a growing number of Sparrowhawks and a sprinkling
&gt; of Apis and Silents we should have a viable nucleus
&gt; of a fleet.  And if it works, more people may be enticed
&gt; to join in affordable competive soaring.

I agree about the 'dumbing down' aspect, but performance
can be built in as mentioned in the Discus/LS4 rebuttal,
so it's performance disadvantage is to cut costs in

Actually a high wing is more efficient (I believe due
to better lift distribution). Don't believe me though,
find some technical reports by OSTIV and look at what
will probably be the newest Shleicher ubership. It
is called the MU: 31, and it is essentially a 27 (it's
fuselage is considered to be just about optimal, drag
wise, since it has to house a human and be crash safe
it is hard to get much better) with the wing moved
to the high position. The trailing edge actually terminates
on a pylon to maintain it's optimal hight at optimal
angle of incidence. It has -7 degrees of inboard washout
(wash-in?) in the first meter which gives it a strange
anhedral sort of look, and these nifty little dimples
in front of the wing/fuselage juncture to discourage
horseshoe vortecies. Due to these mods, it has 16%
less induced drag, and induced being 1/3 of total drag
has around a 5% lower sink rate than a normal 27, but
the high wing is said by them to be more efficient,
although admittedly it does not look as cool. If you
can't find anything on the MU: 31 and want to see it,
I can archive and link my scanned version of it I have
on disk. It really is cool.

The PW-5's performance is not too bad, but it sure
ain't no looker. That is what I believe turns a lot
of people off the idea, when they can get a much cooler
looking ship for less money! I do think there ought
to be a one design ship though, but I would much rather
see the Sparrowhawk be it.

I've had a few fun retrieves, but landing out every other flight is

I have limited XC experience in a nominally greater than 1:35 Std Cirrus, and
early XC in a 1:27 Blanik L13, and a couple of flights in a Kestrel 19. Of the
three performance bands the Standard class Cirrus is the most fun for me -
probably because it is mine, and I have the most experience in it. The lower
performance is very frustrating because it is so slow getting anywhere. The
performance of the Kestrel means that you have to fly far to be challenging -
in high winds even the Cirrus can get tiresome trying to go upwind...

Getting low is a consequence of weather and pilot choices. Where I fly there is
usually lots of energy and anything less than 2000 feet AGL is &quot;low&quot; and wasting
time because the thermals tend to get scrappy and disorganised. That said I have
spent my fair share of time grinding away from some low position. Usually as a
consequence of my poor decision making.

Landouts happen to all of them, even the 1:60+ uber bugsmashers. They just tend
to happen a lot further away from home. Which can make retrieves a real
adventure, or unmitigated pain. Consider the crew a little while ago who I
watched scurrying around for a second trailer that could handle an 18m racer
when both of their pilots called below glide 150km away at 17:00... On rural
dirt roads in the part of the world these guys were in that could be a very long
process. Consider that the area these guys were getting low in is pretty
uninhabited. As one French pilot found out in the 2001 worlds, there are places
you can land in a tilled field and have , no radio comms, no cell phone and no
building in sight from the circuit.

How pleasant an outlanding is depends largely on crew and how easy it is to get
your glider home. The one outlanding involving the L13 was a nightmare. The
trailer is open, and the fittings badly designed, and now old and abused. Then
he lands where the rocks prevent getting a trailer in close.  Conversely, the
Cirrus is easy to derig and has a good trailer, so it is no major problem most
of the time. Never tried it , but there is an adage that you know who your real
friends are the second time you ask them to retrieve you with a Kestrel 19.

How much fun you have depends on your attitude - not on your equipment.

&gt; i think we sould just leave those poor PW-5's alone, i mean usually

&gt; contests.  I wouldnt even care WHICH design it was but as long as it
&gt; was affordable enough for an average pilot to get into.  when the

A World Class glider should have the performance to do 300K flights in
coastal areas where the lift usually starts at 2,500 AGL by noon and
rises to 4-5,000' later in the day.  It should do 500K flights with
higher ceilings and/or ridge lift. It should win some Sports Class
regional contests, even over roughed terrain and weak conditions.

In other words, it should be a PW 5.

Someone asked what I would consider &quot;a long task&quot; for a PW 5.
Currently, along the Gulf Coast, where cloud base rarely gets over
5,000', we do lots of 300K flights in PW 5s. Here a long task would
have to be at least 300K. Out West, 500K would be called a long task.
US records show that you would have to fly quite a bit further than
that for a record.

As for contests, PW 5's have won Sports Class Regionals. Look at Bill
Snead's flights in this year's Region 10 contest.  His flights were
over rough terrain and in challenging conditions.

You may have heard the excuse, &quot;I flew as far as I could; after all, I
was flying a PW 5 ( or another short-winged ship).&quot;  But it's often
our skills, not the ship that limits us.

None of us should accept arbitrary limits. Isn't soaring a sport that
breaks limits and preconceptions?

Here, Here Tim:

The Club Class has definitely stepped up and filled the performance/
price niche the orginal World Class was meant to fill in the soaring
contest world. Club Class around the world offers some of the most
competitive racing in the world right now, in ships that more pilots
can afford - especially inthe US given the Euro/$ rate now. Every
country in the world offers Club Class racing except the US (and maybe
Canada?). Why are we so stubbornly against the concept, while we still
devote the time and effort to site a World Class Nationals every year?

Yes, some rules makers have said to me : &quot;well look at the Club Class
in Europe, with all of its highly modified Cirruses, etc., that will
just mean pilots will take $20K Cirruses and trick them out for $40K ,
and then where is the affordability?&quot;

I was once of that thought. But after having seen the 3rd French Pilot
in a run-of-the mill Std Cirrus place 3rd at Club Worlds ahead of the
supposedly tricked out Cirrus' the top two French pilots flew, I just
do not think that is much of an issue. There is only so much you can
do with Cirrus, Libelles, etc. And now that the IGC Club Class list is
adding the Discus (and like ships) to the list of ships allowed, the
Club class alows a huge portion of the US fleet of gliders to compete
at a high level again. Isn't that a good thing?

Oh, and even if it takes $40k to trick out and old ship to be fully
competitive, I've still saved a good number 10's of thousands of $'s
with which I can compete at more contests. Isn't the possibility of
increased contest participation a good thing as well?

Others have said to me:  &quot;why should I have to purchase an old Libelle
to compete in a contest where I can make the US Team?&quot; And good/great
pilots (often younger) who can only afford crappy gliders or who's
dads don't have a D2  for them to fly should have to buy $100k new
ships to compete on an even palying field in the only handicapped
class the US offers pilots?

The concept of the US Sports Natioanls has outlived its usefullness -
other than to offer pilots more options of flying a nationals each
year. If I own a new ASW-15 meter ship, my nationals should be the 15
meter class. If I own a Schempp-Std Class glider my nationals should
be Stds Nationals. If I own a whatever-Open Class ship, I might be
clamoring for a handicapped Open Class to attract more ships to that
nationals since Sports Class does not cater to me at all. etc. But if
I own a Libelle, or Elfe, or whatever older ship, I am S.O.L. for my
own Nationals.

The current Sports Class Nationals has become a joke for entry level
racing here in the US - unless you can afford to buy a brand new ship
and start racing it as a newbie, OR you can find a glider that has not
been raced in the last 20-30 years and has an overly generous handicap
so you can try and &quot;work&quot; the current system. Otherwise, you need to
depend on a lot of luck fromt he weather gods and superior pilot
skills to have any hope of winning.

Instead Sports Class has become just another &quot;option&quot; for pilots of
the latest and best ships. Many pilots I am sure say: &quot;Well, I own an
ASW-50, my nationals is in XXX. I don't like XXX, but Sports Nationals
is in a place I do like... I might as well just fly Sports Nats and
maybe even pick up a high nationals placing since the tasking is,
after all, more and more set up for ships like mine because that is
(mostly) who goes to it anymore.&quot;

Keep the Sports Class at the regional level - its fun to race agaisnt
others outside of your class and to learn in, BUT give US pilots their
own Club Class Nationals like everyone else in the world has!

Let the World Class, as a separate nationals, die quietly and maybe
set up an A and B Club Class Nationals system and give the US soaring
population a Club Class Nationals to fill the entry level/affordable/
very competitive contest niche.

&gt; Others that contended for the bid to be the world class glider and their

&gt; How the PW5 was picked over the other designs remains a topic of some

&gt; (it really is homely) but there were however many other gliders that were in
&gt; contention for the title sold that already meet much the original design
&gt; criteria. If these models were all lumped together with the existing PW5
&gt; gliders the potential is there for a successful competition class to yet

&gt; There is no need to start including Grob Astirs, Cirrus, LS4 and the likes

THere are many personal reasons for flying a contest, not just that one.
I think one reason the World Class did not become popular is a lot
pilots really don't care if the other pilot is flying a different
glider, as long as the performance (actual or handicapped) is &quot;close
enough&quot;. The Club Class and Sports Class popularity appears to support
this view.

You've just described Club Class performance. Why pay three times as
much for a PW5 when you can do the same flights with a Cirrus, Libelle
or Astir? That is, of course, what everyone asked themselves when the
PW5 finally became available (years late iirc), and why it failed.

Really nobody &quot;tricks out&quot; their gliders.  Everybody seals their
glider properly but that doesn't cost much. If you add winglets (~
$2,000) or wing-root fillets (which probably don't work unless you've
done wind tunnel time) you get extra handicap, so it doesn't make any
difference, and so pilots don't bother.

Certainly nobody is spending tens of thousands of dollars, not even

Plenty of interesting stuff in this lengthening thread.
Assuming (big assume I know) that the concept of one-design
racing, at the lower end of the performance range,
could be a good idea, could work like dinghy racing
classes, and could attract 'new' people to sporting
gliding, can we arrive at some king of concensus about
the spec.  No, don't just say why not the LS4 or the
S-H D(a) because there are almost certainly liability
issues that would preclude an open and widespread re-start
manufacture of those, and they are anyway 'old-technology'
now.  Consider also that the 'one-type' could be a
homebuild (a kit) and in the microlight class (see
Euro rules for this), or generally de-regulated or
lightly regulated.  The comments about how to minimise
cost are correct for sure, so we are looking at a 'small'
glider, and a simple one, so that it can become numerous
rapidly, both as a multi-manufacturer ready-to-fly,
and as a kit.  That's not to say it cannot be sexy
or, in the eyes of the oh so conservative existing
glider pilot community, just look cool - whatever that
is!

Generally, it seems that L/D around 38 would be enough
- that would be better than an old Std Cirrus, not
quite as good as a Discus A, but close to the LS4.
Can we agree on that?

And the cost?  What would folks be prepared to pay
for this one-class 'new' glider - ready-to-fly bare
hull?  Or as a kit?

Club Class, or Sport Class is fine, but the great leveller
is everybody in exactly the same type, and flying at
the same weight.  One of the reasons the idea of one-design
got rubbished was that some of the pilots could not
hack it at that level (of performance) and just blamed
the tool.

So, be constructive, iron out the spec, and maybe there
will be interest in designing the glider, and in producing
it quickly enough, in enough places, and in sufficient
quantity to make the one-design concept fly again.
Who knows, maybe more than one one-design will emerge
- just like dinghy racing.  And that would be cool.

&gt; People keep comparing to sailboat one design racing, but there is a
&gt; big difference between sailing a Sunfish in weak conditions and flying
&gt; a PW5 in weak conditions, the PW5 lands out and the Sunfish does NOT
&gt; sink.  Avoiding landing out in weak conditions is why a minimum of
&gt; performance is needed.

&gt; The only way I can support the &quot;World class&quot; is to buy one myself or
&gt; with a club.  But before I did this, the glider has to have enough
&gt; performance that I would have fun.  So I express what I think should
&gt; be changed to allow this to happen. This doesn't mean that I am
&gt; threatened, but I feel the concept has not been well executed.

Another issue I see in the comparison between sailboat racing and
gliding is cost.   We're talking about vastly different price points.

Here's the problem.   For the same price as a PW-5, I can buy an
LS-3.    This cost is somewhere just north of $25K, with an LS-3 maybe
a shade lower than the PW-5.      I don't think anyone would argue
that the LS-3 has significantly better performance, not just at Max L/
D but more importantly at 60kts and above.    At 70kts, in fact, the
LS-3 has more or less double the L/D of the PW-5.    In gliding,
that's a BIG difference.

We can look at single-handed dinghy sailboats as a comparison.   We're
looking at a used Laser at anywhere from maybe $1000 for a ratty one
with a lot of time on it to maybe $4,000 for a newer one in cherry
condition.      At the same time, a ratty Sunfish can be had for
probably $300 while a cherry might fetch $1000.      To make a fair
comparison, let's assume both boats in similar age and condition;  say
10 years old and solid mechanical shape with hull scratches and
cosmetically poor deck.    We'll put the Sunfish at $500 and the Laser
at $1500.     There's no doubt that the Laser is a &quot;better&quot; boat for
reasonably accomplished sailors.  It's harder to sail (almost killed
myself in one once) than the Sunfish but it handles better and can go
a bit faster, and the price seems to reflect that.     However, even
though it's better, as Todd noted you can still sail on the same
course with the Sunfish and finish 10 times out of 10.

Let's say that Sunfish was the only recognized one design class in
dinghy sailing.   I could buy one for $500 and race in Sunfish
regattas to my heart's content.   I might also buy a Laser for fun.
The combined cost is less than a used Cobra trailer.

Cutting to the point, the economics don't favor the PW-5.   If the
PW-5 was maybe $10K, it might have been a big seller.   But, at $25K
plus it's not in the running, especially with Club Class offering very
competitive racing for even less money.

Do people buy a dinghy just to go sailing most of the time, and race
only once or twice a year? Or are they bought primarily for racing? If
it's the later, we may not learn anything by comparing one design racers
in gliders and sailboats, because most people don't/won't buy a glider
for just racing.

If people are buying gliders mostly for non-contest flying, a new,
&quot;low-cost&quot;, one design racer will never be able to compete in value with
the used market. It will either be &quot;priced right&quot; but have lower
performance, or &quot;perform right&quot; and cost a lot more. I think the flaw in
the one-design concept is thinking a lot pilots like the concept enough
to actually make any sacrifice in cost or performance to get one.

If you look at something like the Lightning (I crewed on one for two
seasons) it was actually designed to be a reasonably pleasant day
sailer that also raced (or, a good racer that also was capable of
being a family day sailer).    Again, though, the issue is price.
If I could get a second generation 30 foot Pearson for the same price
as a Lightning, how many Lightnings do you think would sell?

&gt; Generally, it seems that L/D around 38 would be enough

&gt; quite as good as a Discus A, but close to the LS4.
&gt;  Can we agree on that?

No. As Papa3 pointed out in another post *best* glide is pretty
meaningless. It's the L/D at 70 or 80 knots that counts. That's why you
pay $40,000 for a used 40/1 glider when another 40/1 glider, in similar
condition, sells for $26,000.

My perception of the dinghy racing folk (I'm strictly a cruising
sailor) is that it's almost all racing - not least because there are
generally races every weekend throughout the season. It's probably
also important that most sailing clubs concentrate on a particular
class (or two). To get the equivalent in gliding would require a club
to have ten or twenty PW-5's on the club/PO fleet, with competitions
every Saturday and Sunday throughout the local soaring season.

The good thing about the World Class competition was in stimulating
interest in smaller, less complicated gliders once again. The bad
thing was thinking that top-notch competition pilots would want to
give up their Venti / Nimbi / ASWs /ASHs to fly them. I don't expect
there would be any difficulty in getting entrants for a World Class
competition if some nice sponsor provided a fleet of identical Discus
2's ...
