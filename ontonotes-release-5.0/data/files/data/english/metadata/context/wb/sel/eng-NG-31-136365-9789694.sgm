I have been so &quot;down&quot; on Wild Oats, I'm afraid ... that
I actually stopped going to their stores altogether.  I just
felt, for such a large organization, they didn't deserve my business
for the poor job they did of providing and marketing GF
products.
I mostly went to the one at Nora because we have a couple of
doctors at St. V, and I felt that was an even worse situation than the
one in Carmel.
Well, we were in the Nora area last night, and I just really
needed to get some lettuce -- so I stopped in.  2 hours later, I
was finally checking out -- with Rex dragging his tired feet (me too),
but I felt like a kid in a candy store!
So I don't know if it's Whole Food's ensuing influence -- or if
it's the effect that Shelia has had on them, by doing her GF cooking
classes.  Whatever -- I was shocked and awed!  I found so
much stuff, and got to the checkout line only to remember that I might
attend Shelia's class on Saturday -- and could get 10% discount on all
this stuff at the Carmel store.  So I put a bunch of it back,
though still took some home &quot;just in case&quot; I didn't get to
Carmel on Saturday.
I wish I could list off all the stuff -- but there was so much!
If you just go by their &quot;Gluten Free&quot; section, it isn't
much, but they have it all throughout the store.  They have also
put little GF shelf-talkers underneath products that are regular
brands they carry, but happen to also be GF.  (Although I did get
one thing home, only to more carefully peruse the label, to find
&quot;sprouted barley&quot; in it -- so we still gotta be vigilant.)
Just a couple of goodies to report on:  FRIED CHICKEN -- Bell &amp;
Evans Gluten Free Breaded Chicken Breast Nuggets.  Oh goodness,
these were wonderful -- and sorta even like that real thing!  For
years, I have been addicted to Thai Kitchen instant noodles (like Top
Ramen, but rice noodles in those puffy packages) -- but never liked
all the sodium or MSG.  Wild Oats brand has an &quot;Instant Rice
Noodle Soup&quot; mix -- same basic flavors as Thai Kitchen, about
half the price and even tastier (and without so much sodium or MSG).
I got 3 -- I wish I'd gotten 12.  There are also more and more
&quot;Whole Fields&quot; and &quot;365 Organic&quot; packages showing
up, which are the Whole Foods brands.  I got some 365 Ginger Miso
refrigerated salad dressing that actually SAYS &quot;gluten free&quot;
on the label.
And if you want a real treat, here is something I've always
bought at Wild Oats, which is their store brand bacon:  Wild Oats
Natural Hickory Smoked Bacon.  This is, bar none, the best bacon
ever.  When I was a kid, we used to drive up into the Rocky
Mountains and my dad would cook breakfast on a Coleman stove -- and
this bacon is just like the stuff he cooked!  It is GF, and the
provider is Beeler Farms (http://www.beelerspurepork.com/).  I
used to treat us to Beeler bacon every so often, and then Wild Oats
started packaging it under their store name for about 30% less $.
(I hope that doesn't go away when it becomes Whole Foods!)
So ... wow.
I also talked to someone in the bread and bakery department.
She only &quot;sort of&quot; seemed informed -- but did say that
she thought she saw some GF baked items coming into the store
between Thanksgiving and New Year's.  And that after Jan. 1, it
will be basically a Whole Foods.  Who knows?  She could have
had it all wrong.  But I am still hoping and praying we get THE BREAD!

Hi!  I copied this, literally word-for-word, from Cook's
Illustrated Test Kitchen.  I haven't made it yet, but it looks so
easy and WARM, I thought I'd pass it along.  (Dunno 'bout you
guys, but I am COLD these days!)
I've had good luck with Eckrich kielbasa and sausages -- I always
read the labels, but the brand is on many GF lists.  I also
thought the soup might be really pretty with rainbow chard instead of
the kale, albeit slightly less authentic I suppose.  As for
chicken broth, I usually use either Kitchen Basics (undiluted) or
Better than Bouillon (concentrated) brands -- both are GF and really
good.
I don't happen to own a potato masher -- but discovered something
that works just as well, and that is a pastry cutter.  Actually,
I like it better because it's easier to leave chunks in your potatoes
if that's what you're after.
Also, if you use oil instead of butter, it's DF as well as GF.
Rustic Potato Soup
Our version of Caldo Verde, a Portuguese soup that includes sausage,
potato, and kale, is a one-pot meal that can be prepared in under 20
minutes. The trick is to cut the potatoes into small cubes that cook
quickly while the kielbasa and leeks are sautéing and then partially
mash the potatoes to thicken the soup.

Serves 4 to 6

Let the potatoes simmer in the broth while you prep and cook the
remaining ingredients. Because the kielbasa is quite salty, no added
salt is necessary.

* 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 2 pounds red potatoes, peeled and cut into
3/4-inch cubes
* 1 bay leaf
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 pound kielbasa sausage, cut into 1/2-inch
pieces
* 2 large leeks, white and light green parts only,
cut in half lengthwise, then sliced thin crosswise
* 1/2 bunch kale, stems removed and leaves cut
crosswise into 1/4-inch strips (about 4 packed cups)
* Ground black pepper

1. Bring broth, potatoes, and bay leaf to boil in large
saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Using
potato masher, coarsely break up potatoes, leaving some large
chunks.

2. Meanwhile, melt butter in Dutch oven over medium heat.
Cook kielbasa, stirring frequently, until lightly browned in spots,
about 4 minutes. Add leeks and cook until soft, about 4 minutes.

3. Add potato mixture and kale to Dutch oven and simmer
until kale is tender, about 5 minutes. Season with pepper and
serve.

Carmel Wild Oats has the new Bob's Red Mill GF oats - both varieties.  They now sell quite a few varieties of Breads from Anna mixes too.  I'm eager to try the new Cranberry and Pumpkin breads but didn't see them last time I was at the store.
I've also heard that Whole Foods is rolling out it's own line of GF baking mixes - &quot;rumored&quot; to be made by GF Pantry but this house brand (called &quot;365&quot;) will be a little less expensive.   And wouldn't it be awesome to have the Whole Foods Bakehouse freshly baked items available?   &quot;THE BREAD&quot;!!!  Let's hope that happens!
