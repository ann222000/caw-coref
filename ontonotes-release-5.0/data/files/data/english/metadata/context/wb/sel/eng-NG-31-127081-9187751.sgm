Esq.

An abbreviation for esquire, which is a title used by attorneys in the
United States. The term esquire has a different meaning in English
law. It is used to signify a title of dignity, which ranks above
gentleman and directly below knight.

In the United States, Esq. is written after a lawyer's name, for
example: John Smith, Esq.

Only in North America.

In medieval times an esquire was an apprentice knight, who acted as a kind of
personal assistant and gofer, carried his equipment etc.  The word comes from
the Latin  &quot;scutum&quot; = shield, and refers to a shield bearer.

Later in England it was used for minor gentry, and for a time was used by
status seekers as a substitute for Mr, coming after a man's name instead of
before.

As a book called &quot;Titles and forms of address: a guide to their correct use&quot;
laments:

&quot;The almost universal use of this title for every man who cannot claim a
higher one persists in spite of protests and objections from those who are
really entitled to it.&quot;

Those who are really entitled to it are &quot;Companions&quot; of various orders of
Knighthood, whose members, in order of precedence are &quot;Knights Grand Cross&quot;,
&quot;Knights Commanders&quot; and &quot;Companions&quot;. The first two have &quot;Sir&quot; before their
name, and the last have &quot;Esq.&quot; after.

Sir Robert Johnson G.C.M.G. (Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Oder
of St Michael and St George).

Richard Jackson, Esq., C.M.G. (Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St
Michael and St George).

The main solecism was to use both Mr and Esq.

You either addressed a letter to

John Smith Esq.
or
Mr John Smith

but never, never, ever

Mr John Smith Esq.

I have a friend who still likes to be addressed as Esq., and he also wears a
monocle, which shows what kind of stone he crawled out from under. He was
never a Companion of anything.

It belongs to the age when toilets were labeled &quot;ladies&quot; and &quot;gents&quot;.

Anyway, my dictionary says it is a tile of respect, generally abbreviated
Esq., placed after a man's name.

But in 1809 he may indeed have been a gent.

I use it regularly but I think that, strictly speaking, nowadays it should
be used only for those who are armigerous.  It is not used as it is in USA
for members of the legal profession.

In Samuel Pepys's day that would have meant less tax.  So when the
tax-man did that to him, he do not correct the man, but put the extra

In 1809, there is far more chance that someone described as 'Esq'  was a gentleman
by birth and armigerous (than there would have been 50 years later).  They were still
somewhat picky about exact terminology.
By then, there was already something of a tendency to use 'gentleman' more

Same here. We just got rid of our vicious hate-monger of a PM of 11
years, a man for whom history is irrelevant (including family history I
imagine) unless it's white only. I haven't been reading the various
threads on the black queen but the subject still brings a lot of trolls
and a lot of bites.

Anyway, politics on the backburner until February and massive migration
to the coast (not very far for most of us). Have a good xmas all and
thanks for your help in the couple of threads I've initiated.

And if a yeoman, it means he worked his own land too.

But the ones I am referring to were urban gentlemen who lived in boarding
houses and were not remittance men. They'd come to make their fortune, but
hadn't. Their description as &quot;gentleman&quot; may have been tongue in cheek, of
course.

Not quite as simply as that. Yeoman in the C16,C17, the early C18 meant he owned
his land, but by the late C18 and after, it was equally applied to a big farmer who
might be a major tenant. It was then the size of the holding, not the free status,
which applied. And 'gentleman' even after 1800 rarely applied to a farmer or
tradesman who dirtied his hands - not till he retired (since you had to be rich to retire
anyway.)

&gt;  &gt; &gt;&gt;In 1809, there is far more chance that someone described as 'Esq'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was a gentleman by birth and armigerous (than there would have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 50 years later).  They were still somewhat picky about exact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terminology. By then, there was already something of a tendency to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use 'gentleman' more loosely, for someone who was merely rich enough
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not to work.

&gt;&gt; yeoman or gentleman in a PR,  if a farmer, means that he owned his own
&gt;&gt;  land

&gt; Not quite as simply as that. Yeoman in the C16,C17, the early C18 meant he owned
&gt; his land, but by the late C18 and after, it was equally applied to a big farmer who
&gt; might be a major tenant. It was then the size of the holding, not the free status,
&gt; which applied. And 'gentleman' even after 1800 rarely applied to a farmer or
&gt; tradesman who dirtied his hands - not till he retired (since you had to be rich to retire
&gt; anyway.)

Some weeks ago I came across an individual who was described as a yeoman
in the register entry of the baptism of one of his children and as a
gentleman in another.  And my great grandfather's half-brother who would
have been described as a clothier at home apparently styled himself as a
yeoman when he got to the US.

Forms of address change over time and with circumstances. The general
answer for all such enquiries as the meaning of Esq is 'Get into the
mindsets and social structure of the time.' There is no invariant
meaning.

In the case of Esq, a person who uses it to another would probably be
regarded as fawning and a boot-licker. A person who insists on it
being used for themselves would probably be regarded as a pretentious
prat.

It can be edgy for some older people, such as me, who have lived
through changes of etiquette. It seems odd to address a bishop as
Christopher during a church event although there is hardly a more
logical case and time for using a 'christian' name for a person.

In my era it was possible for a graduate of KCL to refer to himself as
a 'King's man', but not permissible to refer to any other male
graduate in that way. They were 'King's gentlemen'. There was no such
thing as a 'King's woman' since that had rather unfortunate
connotations. They were all 'King's ladies'. Postdocs couldn't be
referred to as gentlemen or ladies, they had to be 'eminent' gentlemen
or ladies. It sounds incredible in modern parlance but it was the rule
50 years and more ago.

Then there are the different rules in other cultures which sound weird
when translated literally into English. I get communications in
impeccable English, except for one thing, from an elderly lady
colleague in Berlin. The one thing she cannot seem to do is cease
using the German form of address.

We won't go into the hysterics which arise when certain Latin cultures
try to get round Don as both honorific and name.

The problem when looking at old records is that the terms and the
etiquette for using them are not explained. At the time, no
explanation was necessary since they were hat was accepted as correct.
Many people, got and get stroppy if addressed in a way which does not
comply with prevailing etiquette. Try dealing with high-ranking
Japanese in the modern sloppy manner of most western business culture.

** When I was a boy (more than half a century ago), it was common for
young people to receive letters addressed to them, esq., with the
implied meaning of someone not yet adult.
As Don says, forms of address change over the years in their meaning and
usage.

I have no reason to fawn or bootlick but I invariably address envelopes to
men I don't know, using Esq. because I was brought up to do so.  A person
who *insisted* on it being used for themselves would be socially insecure
and inept.  IME, the higher up the 'social tree' the person, the less fussed
they are about such things.
But IIRC, the original question had something to do with lawyers in UK being
given Esq. as some form of honorific and they are not, or not by virtue of
being lawyers, anyway.
It's a small courtesy but AFAIK, its origins lie in families which are
armigerous and all that implied with regard to service as a squire.
