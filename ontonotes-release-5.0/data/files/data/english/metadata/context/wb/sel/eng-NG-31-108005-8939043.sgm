For those who remember LN, she sends a big &quot;Hi!&quot; to everyone. She hasn't
been popping in because she hasn't been quilting, but life is good -- she
still loves her job and her two kids are growing like weeds (the oldest is
driving - gasp!).

Thanks for the update, Kathy! Please tell LN that we'd love to see her
here, even if she hasn't been quilting. I'm sure there are others here
like that, and we don't tar and feather them, either. ;)

How could we forget LN? She is so fun. I enjoyed
meeting her at one or two RCTQ gatherings. Tell her to
visit even if she has not been quilting. PAT in VA/USA

That is what I was thinking too Pat.  I miss her around here.
Tell her she can visit once in awhile.

Say hello to LN for me. And not quilting is no excuse for not reading the
newsgroup. Being busy is however...;-)
