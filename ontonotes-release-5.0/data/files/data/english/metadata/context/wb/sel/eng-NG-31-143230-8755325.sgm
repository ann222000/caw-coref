The SC just gave its verdict that the Sharif Brothers are allowed to return
to the country as per their wishes. Should we expect some major political
changes in the near future? Will the lota league (PML-Q) see defections?
Lets see what happens.

Benazir was looking at short term gains whereas the Sharif brothers have
played their cards well.

I think in the long run Sharifs will make more political gains as compared
to Benazir.

Don't forget the corruptions made by Sharif brother during their regime,
also their attitude towards the parliament and constitution. I mean that
they wanted to become BADSHA of this Islamic republic of Pakistan.

Chaar din ki chandni hay aagay kaali ghata. We have a free media and a
judiciary which is slowly and steadily asserting its independence. It wont
be easy for Sharif Brother or any XYZ to get away with anything.

Everyone should keep in mind the day when
*Sharif Brothers ordered their party activist to attack on Supreme court
building and first time in the history the APEX court treated ruthlessly.*
Nawaz was the person
*who expeld the then Chief Justice Sajjad Hussain Shah by force* and then
*sent home to Jhangir Karamat*.
If Supreme court allowed him to come back we should not be so optimistic.
He is *one of the gift given by Dictators* and proved himself one of the
selfish ruler of Pakistan but even then we are happy with the decision as it
is sign of
*SUPERMACY OF JUDICIARY.*
*GOD BLESS PAKISTAN
*
