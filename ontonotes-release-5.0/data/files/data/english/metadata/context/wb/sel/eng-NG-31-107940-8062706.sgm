It appears that the car attempted to bypass the roadblock and got caught!

In the unedited video you see that there are two police cars starting to
line up side by side with their lights on trying to slow down traffic.  The
guy in the white car actually darted between the two police cars, right up
the middle, and cut off the one on the left before speeding on up the road.

The cop runs up to the car like he's going to kill the actual vehicle,
points to the shoulder, the car pulls over and the cop runs over and
continues to yell.  I wonder if he knew that there was an airplane on the
highway...  :&gt;
