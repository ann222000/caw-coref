"According to records available from the Department of State, first
ships from Dalmatia to New York arrived in 1797," says Croatian
genealogist Adam Eterovich www.croatians.com . The first Croatian
captain on the ship "Postojani" was Luka Gerich, followed by Mato
Fiskovich.

Due to economic conditions in the 1800's Croatians came to America to
look for work. "S trbuhom za kruhom" they headed in search of a better
life. Many Croatians were landless peasants, driven out when the
country failed to industrialize. Croatia easily ranked the highest in
the percentage of small peasant proprietors on the land. Leaving the
rural villages, Croatians had most difficult time reaching America.
One word description comes to mind "krvavo". They universally
suspected immigration agents of excessive charges and bad advice and
composed a rhyme on their experiences: "Jer agenti varalice jesu, samo
za se napunjaju kesu." Translation: "For the agents are surely
swindlers, since they are always lining their own pockets."

Despite the hardships and obstacles, Croatian people have succeeded in
America, or for the purposes of this article in New York. The
tremendous struggle to first reach the American soil and then to learn
and assimilate is proven by how many of our people have changed their
names and consequently lost connection to the Croatian community.

New York City is one of the most vibrant, vital cities on earth.
www.go-newyorkcity.com In New York one can take a tour of Croatian
history:

The first Croatian church in Manhattan opened in 1913 on West 50th
Street. First priest serving Croatian people was a Slovene. Fairly
small church serving big community transferred in 1954 to a much
larger church and hall at 502 West 41 Street called Sts. Cyril &amp;
Methodius Croatian Roman Catholic church. The church is exceptionally
beautiful with its stained glass windows. Close to 2000 devoted
parishioner's celebrated 90th anniversary during 2003. Two Franciscan
Friars and two nuns are serving the Croatian community, including
visiting the sick. The nuns are teaching Catechism, Croatian language
and religious songs to youngsters. The ethnic dancing "kolo" group
"Cardinal Stepinac" performs regularly. Outside and inside you can see
huge Croatian Coat of Arms and a large sign "Bog i Hrvati." or
"Croats! God be with you." The church holds the sculpture of Cardinal
Alojzije Stepinac (1898-1960) by Ivan Mestrovic who was a great
Croatian artist. Attached building to the church is the Croatian
Center or the Sveti Nikola Tavelic Hall, where one can see well
preserved wall paintings by talented artist Zvonimir Mihanovic. Born
on August 12, 1946 in Sitno Polje near Split, Mihanovic painted the
famous scenes of Zagreb, Dubrovnik, Split, Mostar, Sarajevo, etc.
Mihanovic draws inspiration from the picturesque harbors, tranquility,
the small harbor and the few fishing boats used by solitary anglers
along the coast, marine vistas and small villages scattered.
Mihanovic's ability to calm the soul through his work in oil is
legendary. www.mihanovic.com

The spacious basement of the church served as the center where we
collected first aid to Croatia from June 15, 1991 until 1995 during
brutal attack by Serbs. In the best Croatian tradition, thousands of
us volunteered by giving generous donation of our time, energy and
valuable resources towards the success and continued progress of
independent, peaceful and democratic Croatia. We also received help
from generous Americans, including the popular actor and activist
Martin Sheen.

For decades after the Civil War, Hell's Kitchen on the New York City's
West Side between 14th and 52nd Streets, from Eighth Avenue to the
waterfront was considered very rough neighborhood full of
slaughterhouses, railroad yards, gas works and docks. This was the old
Croatian neighborhood a hundred years ago when shipping was
prominent.

The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, at 64 St and Broadway, is
a place was many Croatians have performed. The first Croatian national
opera was composed in 1846 by Vatroslav Lisinski called "Ljubav i
Zloba".

There are prominent photos of two famous Croatian opera singers Milka
Ternina and Zinka Kunc Milanov on the wall of the Metropolitan Opera.

Milka Ternina (1863-1941), born in Vojni Kriz, Croatia. Began her
career in Zagreb in 1882 as Amelia, went on to Graz and Vienna. Her
fame dates back to Bremen in 1886. In 1890 the Bavarian Royal Opera
engaged her. Years of triumph followed. Through her appearances at the
Bayreuth Festivals and in several European capitals, Milka gained
prominence at the height of her career as the foremost Wagnerian
soprano in the world. For nine seasons she elated American audiences
at the Metropolitan Opera. She was Met's first Tosca performing with
Enrico Caruso. She was hailed by the great Italian conductor Toscanini
as the "world's greatest artist," with repertory of 85 roles. In 1906,
Milka Ternina returned to her native Zagreb, forced by paralysis she
retired in 1916. But in Zagreb, Milka discovered the young Zinka Kunc,
coached her for three years and gave to the Metropolitan Opera one of
its shining talents. http://www.historicopera.com/ or
www.croatianmall.com/croatia/franolic/milka-ternina.htm

Mira Teresa Zinka Kunc Milanov (1906-1989), was born in Zagreb. She
was widely acclaimed for her operatic talent and even now opera lovers
say when Zinka stopped singing, it was the end of an era. Zinka gave
298 performances at the Metropolitan Opera plus 123 on tour. Starting
in 1937, Zinka had the honor to open the season four times. Considered
among the great artists, she covered Verdi, Puccini, Bellini, Mascagni
and others. During 29 seasons at the Metropolitan she sang Leonora,
Aida, Gioconda, Tosca, the two Amelias, Santuzza, Maddelena, Norma,
Donna Anna, Desdemona and Elvira. Zinka was considered "primadonna
assoluta, la Regina Della casa". Zinka was extremely proud of her
American citizenship. http://www.bassocantante.com/opera/
milanov.html , www.naxos.com/ or www.hr/darko/etf/et12.html

The gift shop at the Lincoln Center is still selling cassettes of
Zinka's operas. Unfortunately Milka's voice is not preserved, as
during her lifetime recording was not perfected. Just as the great
prima donna Milka was teaching Zinka, she too was teaching among
others, Rosalie Olinski. After Zinka's death, Rosalie performed at a
concert in honor of Zinka where she sang the old favorites of Zinka's
including "Domovini i Ljubavi", "Gor Cez Jezero", "Daleko Je Moj
Split", "Pastirica", "Ko Lani Sem", etc.

accompanist and mentor to his world famous sister Zinka Kunc.

Ilma di Murska or Ema Puksec (1834-1889), the "Croatian Nightingale",
as the Viennese used to call her. Ilma di Murska was born in Ogulin.
After studying singing in Zagreb and Graz, she went to Vienna in 1860.
In 1862, di Murska made extraordinarily debut as Queen Marguerite de
Valois in Meyerbeer's Las Huguenots, at the Pergola Theatre in
Florence. After triumphant appearance in Italy, Barcelona, Budapest
and Berlin, di Murska made her debut at the Royal Opera in Vienna as
Leonora in Verdi's Il Trovatore, in 1864. In Vienna she sang in 17
different roles, and performing in 229 operas and 8 concerts. After
appearing in Berlin, Paris and Hamburg, di Murska first appeared in
London at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1865 as Lucia di Lammerinoor where
she sang brilliant soprano. After 1871 she settled in America and was
offered in 1880 a professorship of singing at the National
Conservatory of Music in New York. She died on January 14, 1889 as one
of the great singers in operatic history. www.historicopera.com

countryside. Eventually, however, his boyhood carvings in wood and
stone attracted attention, and local monks gave him some work carving
for them. When he was 15, he was introduced to a retired army officer,
who started a fund to allow Mestrovic to receive some formal training.

Island Ferry at South Ferry Terminal. Commuters and tourists share
some of the best views of the Southern tip of Manhattan while viewing
the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and Verrazano Bridge. Some people
speculate whether Verrazano is Vranjican and along with Marco Polo of
Croatian origin? Marco Polo (1254-1324) according to rumors was born
on Korcula Island and moved on to become Venetian adventurer and
explorer, meritorious for his explorations of China.

Every year Croatian runners participate in the New York City Marathon,
a 27-mile run, making their way from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to
Tavern on the Green in Central Park. The most famous park in New York
City provides 843 acres of greensward in the center of Manhattan. In
2003 there were 34,729 runners, 12,000 volunteers and thousands of
city employees assisting. Runners were cheered on by more than 2
million spectators lining the streets of New York City's five
boroughs: Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Manhattan.
The event is televised globally, all celebrating friendship, sport,
