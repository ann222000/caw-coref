Dilip Hiro - Asia Times August 22, 2007

With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States stood
tall - militarily invincible, economically unrivaled, diplomatically
uncontestable. and the dominating force on information channels
worldwide. The next century was to be the true &quot;American century&quot;,
with the rest of the world molding itself in the image of the sole
superpower.

Yet with not even a decade of this century behind us, we are already
witnessing the rise of a multipolar world in which new powers are
challenging different aspects of US supremacy - Russia and China in
the forefront, with regional powers Venezuela and Iran forming the
second rank. These emergent powers are primed to erode US hegemony,
not confront it, singly or jointly.

How and why has the world evolved in this way so soon? The George W
Bush administration's debacle in Iraq is certainly a major factor in
this transformation, a classic example of an imperialist power,
brimming with hubris, overextending itself. To the relief of many - in
the US and elsewhere - the Iraq fiasco has demonstrated the striking
limitations of power for the globe's highest-tech, most destructive
military machine. In Iraq, Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser
to two US presidents, concedes in a recent op-ed, the US is &quot;being
wrestled to a draw by opponents who are not even an organized state
adversary&quot;.

The invasion and subsequent disastrous occupation of Iraq and the
mismanaged military campaign in Afghanistan have crippled the
credibility of the United States. The scandals at Abu Ghraib prison in
Iraq and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, along with the widely publicized
murders of Iraqi civilians in Haditha, have badly tarnished America's
moral self-image. In the latest opinion poll in Turkey, a secular
state and member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, only 9% of
Turks have a &quot;favorable view&quot; of the US (down from 52% just five years
ago).

Yet there are other explanations - unrelated to Washington's glaring
misadventures - for the current transformation in international
affairs. These include, above all, the tightening market in oil and
natural gas, which has enhanced the power of hydrocarbon-rich nations
as never before; the rapid economic expansion of the mega-nations
China and India; the transformation of China into the globe's leading
manufacturing base; and the end of the Anglo-American duopoly in
international television news.

Many channels, diverse perceptions

During the 1991 Gulf War, only the Cable News Network and the British
Broadcasting Corp had correspondents in Baghdad. So the international
TV audience, irrespective of its location, saw the conflict through
their lenses. Twelve years later, when the Bush administration, backed
by British prime minister Tony Blair, invaded Iraq, Al-Jazeera Arabic
broke this duopoly. It relayed images - and facts - that contradicted
the Pentagon's presentation. For the first time in history, the world
witnessed two versions of an ongoing war in real time. So credible was
the Al-Jazeera Arabic version that many television companies outside
the Arabic-speaking world - in Europe, Asia and Latin America - showed
its clips.

Though, in theory, the growth of cable television worldwide raised the
prospect of ending the Anglo-American duopoly in 24-hour television
news, not much had happened because of the exorbitant cost of
gathering and editing TV news. It was only the arrival of Al-Jazeera
English, funded by the hydrocarbon-rich emirate of Qatar - with its
declared policy of offering a global perspective from an Arab and
Muslim angle - that, last year, finally broke the long-established
mold.

Soon France 24 came on the air, broadcasting in English and French
from a French viewpoint, followed in mid-2007 by the English-language
Press TV, which aimed to provide an Iranian perspective. Russia was
next in line for 24-hour TV news in English for the global audience.
Meanwhile, spurred by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Telesur, a pan-
Latin American TV channel based in Caracas, began competing with CNN
in Spanish for a mass audience.

As with Qatar, so with Russia and Venezuela, the funding for these TV
news ventures has come from soaring national hydrocarbon incomes - a
factor draining US hegemony not just in imagery but in reality.

Russia, an energy superpower

Under President Vladimir Putin, Russia has more than recovered from
the economic chaos that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991. After in effect renationalizing the energy industry through
state-controlled corporations, he began deploying its economic clout
to further Russia's foreign-policy interests.

In 2005, Russia overtook the United States to become the second-
largest oil producer in the world. Its oil income now amounts to US
$679 million a day. European countries dependent on imported Russian
oil now include Hungary, Poland, Germany, and even Britain.

Russia is also the largest producer of natural gas on the planet, with
three-fifths of its gas exports going to the 27-member European Union.
Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland and Slovakia get 100% of their natural gas
from Russia; Turkey 66%; Poland 58%; Germany 41%; and France 25%.
Gazprom, the biggest natural-gas enterprise on Earth, has established
stakes in 16 EU countries.

In 2006, the Kremlin's foreign reserves stood at US$315 billion, up
from a paltry $12 billion in 1999. Little wonder that in July 2006, on
the eve of the Group of Eight summit in St Petersburg, Putin rejected
an energy charter proposed by the Western leaders.

Soaring foreign-exchange reserves, new ballistic missiles, and closer
links with a prospering China - with which it conducted joint military
exercises on China's Shandong Peninsula in August 2005 - enabled Putin
to deal with his US counterpart, President Bush, as an equal, not
mincing his words when appraising US policies.

&quot;One country, the United States, has overstepped its national
boundaries in every way,&quot; Putin told the 43rd Munich Trans-Atlantic
Conference on Security Policy in February. &quot;This is visible in the
economic, political, cultural and educational policies it imposes on
other nations ... This is very dangerous.&quot;

Condemning the concept of a &quot;unipolar world&quot;, he added: &quot;However one
might embellish this term, at the end of the day it describes a
scenario in which there is one center of authority, one center of
force, one center of decision-making ... It is a world in which there
is one master, one sovereign. And this is pernicious.&quot; His views fell
on receptive ears in the capitals of most Asian, African and Latin
American countries.

The changing relationship between Moscow and Washington was noted,
among others, by analysts and policymakers in the hydrocarbon-rich
Persian Gulf region. Commenting on the visit that Putin paid to
longtime US allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar after the Munich conference,
Abdel Aziz Sagar, chairman of the Gulf Research Center, wrote in the
Doha-based newspaper The Peninsula that Russia and Gulf Arab
countries, once rivals from opposite ideological camps, had found a
common agenda of oil, anti-terrorism, and arms sales:
The altered focus takes place in a milieu where the Gulf countries are
signaling their keenness to keep all geopolitical options open,
reviewing the utility of the United States as the sole security
guarantor, and contemplating a collective security mechanism that
involves a host of international players.

In April, the Kremlin issued a major foreign-policy document. &quot;The
myth about the unipolar world fell apart once and for all in Iraq,&quot; it
stated. &quot;A strong, more self-confident Russia has become an integral
part of positive changes in the world.&quot;

The Kremlin's increasingly tense relations with Washington were in
tune with Russian popular opinion. A poll taken during the run-up to
the 2006 G8 summit revealed that 58% of Russians regarded the US as an
&quot;unfriendly country&quot;. It has proved to be a trend. Last month, for
instance, Major-General Alexandr Vladimirov told the mass-circulation
newspaper Komsolskya Pravda that war with the United States is a
&quot;possibility&quot; in the next 10-15 years.

Chavez rides high

Such sentiments resonated with Hugo Chavez. While visiting Moscow in
June, he urged Russians to return to the ideas of Vladimir Lenin,
especially his anti-imperialism. &quot;The Americans don't want Russia to
keep rising,&quot; he said. &quot;But Russia has risen again as a center of
power, and we, the people of the world, need Russia to become
stronger.&quot;

Chavez finalized a $1 billion deal to purchase five diesel submarines
to defend Venezuela's oil-rich undersea shelf and thwart any possible
future economic embargo imposed by Washington. By then, Venezuela had
become the second-largest buyer of Russian weaponry. (Algeria topped
the list, another indication of a growing multipolarity in world
affairs.) Venezuela acquired the distinction of being the first
country to receive a license from Russia to manufacture the famed
AK-47 assault rifle.

By channeling some of his country's oil money to needy Venezuelans,
Chavez broadened his base of support. Much to the chagrin of the Bush
White House, he trounced his sole political rival, Manuel Rosales, in
a presidential contest last December with 61% of the vote. Equally
humiliating to the Bush administration, Venezuela was by then giving
more foreign aid to needy Latin American states than the US was.

After his re-election, Chavez vigorously pursued the concept of
forming an anti-imperialist alliance in Latin America as well as
globally. He strengthened Venezuela's ties not only with such Latin
countries as Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and debt-ridden
Argentina, but also with Iran and Belarus.

By the time he arrived in Tehran from Moscow (via Minsk) in June, the
180 economic and political accords his government had signed with
Tehran were already yielding tangible results. Iranian-designed cars
and tractors were coming off assembly lines in

This &quot;multi-polar&quot; development is well underway courtesy of the profit
first needs of US capitalists who are being &quot;hoisted by their own
petard&quot;. Already in Australia with a Federal election looming the
opposition Labour party is committed to early withdrawal from Iraq and
greater commitment to the &quot;region&quot; - which means closer ties with
China, the principal source of Australia's vast mineral exports. Multi-
polarity of economic/political power would make the world a good deal
more complex for a country like Australia so used to hanging onto the
US coattails.

This piece supplements the Asia Times article.

The Guardian (CPA) 5 September, 2007

The Russians are flying - again

&quot;Our pilots have been sitting around for too long and are happy to
resume&quot; commented President Putin in announcing that Russia is to
resume long distance strategic reconnaissance flights over the
Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Arctic oceans. They will be able to
&quot;suddenly appear&quot; off the coasts of the US, Britain, the Philippines
and Australia according to a statement by a former commander of these
long distance aircraft. (Australia may be mentioned because it is home
to Pine Gap one of the most important US strategic military
directional and listening posts.)

Vladimir Putin's announcement came after large scale military
manoeuvres which involved Russian and Chinese military and air forces,
and those from five central Asian republics - formerly republics of
the Soviet Union. The exercises were called &quot;Peace Mission 2007&quot;.

Strategic flights

The strategic flights first started in 1980 at the time of the Cold
War and were suspended in 1992 in the days of the Yeltsin regime.
However, NATO did not stop its patrols then or since.

The Russian resumption of these patrols after 15 years is an important
event not just for Russia but for the world as well, the Russian media
noted. Step by step, Moscow is not only proving its ability to defend
its sovereignty but it is also resuming its geo-political position.
While the US media response has so far been low key, a former US
commander of similar air forces commented that we may soon wake up to
the fact that while we won the Cold War we have lost the peace.

Weapons

The planes involved can carry a variety of weapons including winged
multi-warhead missiles with a range of 3,000 kms and an accuracy of
1cm over that distance the media claimed. Furthermore, the missiles
can change altitude in flight and take into account the topo­graphy of
the land over which they are flying. They cannot be shot down by the
currently available missile systems that the US intends to install in
the Czech Republic and Poland. The planes can fly more than 12,000 km
after leaving Russia's borders and can stay aloft for up to 22 hours
if refuelled while in the air.

One Russian media outlet reported that President Putin attended the
most recent test of three of these missiles and that they passed
through the window of a cottage known to be a meeting place of
terrorists. It is not reported whether any terrorists were at home at
the time!

The Russian media said that the main reason for this step is Russia's
wish to show that it has a response to any situation including a
military one. If the US wants to install missiles in the Czech
Republic and Poland, NATO has to get used to the idea that Russia's
strategic aviation is quite close.

The planes were described as having the role of delivering the first
blow if there were to be a military attack. The media says that after
delivering a first response, atomic submarines would then &quot;finish off&quot;
the blow delivered by the aircraft.

The joint military manoeuvres with China were followed by a meeting of
the heads of state of the seven Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
(SCO) members and representatives of six other countries with observer
status - India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Mongolia and
Afghanistan. Taken together, these countries contain about half the
world's population, have enormous resources and economic clout and
possess a huge pool of scientific and technological know-how. They
occupy a very favourable strategic location in terms of geographical
position. All these factors indicate that the SCO will wield
considerable influence throughout the rest of the world and this will
not be limited to Asia.

The SCO meeting discussed mutual political and trade issues. Trade is
rapidly increasing between the countries of the organisation.
Infrastructure projects such as railroads, roads, oil and gas
pipelines are either on the drawing boards or are already being built.
Some of the important suppliers of oil and gas, which are located in
the former southern republics of the Soviet Union, have indicated that
they will in future export these commodities through pipelines
traversing Russia.
