A Crazy Fan Dilemma...

So a couple of nights ago I started having a weird problem with my 12&quot;
G4 Powerbook. (Aluminum, 1.33 ghz, 512 mb RAM, Tiger) I wasn't doing
anything particularly intensive (editing a text document) when it just
shut off. I thought at first that it might have been the battery, but
I didn't get the &quot;Your battery is low!&quot; warning message. I plugged it
in, booted it back up, and it seemed fine, except that the clock/date
was wrong, and I received the &quot;The date is set to a year before
something&quot; error. I fixed the date and time, reset, did the PRAM/PMU
resets, which didn't seem to make a difference. The time/date stuck,
and everything seemed ok. I went back to using it as normal, when it
did it again the next day. At this point I got curious and assumed it
might be a heat issue or something, so I opened up iStat to check on
the temperatures and found that the fan wasn't spinning at all. I
quickly shut it off and panicked quietly to myself, then ordered a new
fan online.

I've been mulling over the fan purchase all day, and thought of
something that (I thought) was clever - I downloaded a fan control
program and started it up to see what would happen. Sure enough, the
fan kicked on. iStat says it's on, I can definitely hear it screaming
away, and I can feel the air. If I stop running the fan control
program, the fan stops working.

So I have a few questions, and hopefully someone can help me out!

1 - What on earth would make my fan stop working normally? I followed
the iFixit guide and took it all apart to make sure it wasn't
physically broken or disconnected somehow, and it appeared fine and
spun normally when I pushed it with my fingers. I don't think I've
installed anything odd lately that would have anything to do with
this. It just doesn't seem to want to go on its own.

2 - Could this be related to the random shutoff problem? And is the
date/time thing related to that as well? I'm not even sure these are
both part of the same problem, maybe just two individual problems that
happened to coincide?

3 - Now that I've got the fan control program going, is it safe to
keep using it? iStat says she's (yes, my Powerbook is a she ;) )
running at around 103 degrees F, with the fan at about 5500 rpm. My
main concern is that I want to be able to take her to class with me,
but not if I'm going to damage something by continuing to use her,
etc. I can get by without a laptop if need be, but life is so much
nicer with your own computer instead of the lab machines. If I need to
keep running the control program forever, so be it. I'm just worried.

If anyone could give me any suggestions, that would be great and I
would be extremely thankful, as I'm pretty confused right about now.
Either way, a new fan is on its way to me in the mail so I could try
swapping it and see what that does, but now I'm not so sure it's the
fan itself, unless there's some type of hardware control built into it
that maybe went bad on my present fan.

Anyway, thank you!

I've had issues with the fan in my 1.67 GHz G4 15&quot; PowerBook. It was
extremely noisy so Apple &quot;cleaned&quot; it. The noise came back and so
they replaced it. It started making noise again, but now has been
running quietly for the last week. Strange, but I'm glad I got
AppleCare. If it screws up one or two times more I think they have to
replace the PB as a lemon.

This is for the G4 PPC PowerBooks? Can you share the name of it and
maybe a url? The only fan control program I had heard of was for
Intel 'books.

Seems to work pretty well, though I've only been using it for a short while
so far. I thought they were all for Intel as well. :)

It's either a software / firmware problem or a problem with the
sensor.   I don't know what sensors are used control the fan, perhaps
iStat can tell you.  If it shows the sensor is responding correctly
then it sounds like a software problem.  I'd check the Apple support
pages for any possible update.  I know there have been some related
to fans but I don't know which models.

I would think the random shutoff is due to overheating.  The loss of
date and time is probably also due to it.  The power manager probably
cut power to everything.

As long as the fan is running you should be okay.  The whole point of
slowing or stopping the fan is to reduce noise.

The only other thing that comes to mind is to try resetting the
NVRAM.  Boot up and old down Command-Option-o-f.  A command line will
appear.  Enter the following:

reset-nvram &lt;Enter&gt;
reset-all &lt;Enter&gt;

it will now reboot.
try not starting the fan manually and see if it starts automatically.
But keep an eye on the temperature and start it manually if needed.

I just wanted to add a point to the discussion:

I downloaded and am running G4FanControl 0.5 which allows you to set
three temperature sensor thresholds which kick in the fan.  Even
though those three thresholds ma not be achieved your fan may still
be running.  According to iStat Pro my PowerBook has five temperature
sensors and one of them seems to kick in my fan first.

If you run both apps at the same time you will be able to see which
sensors G4FanControl monitors as it's unlikely that the sensors will
be reading the same temperature.

Actually, I don't think I've ever seen istat report to me that my fans
are running, tho I have heard them once in a while.

What's the usual temp for the g4's before the fans kick in?  Is there
a chart somewhere?  Couldn't find one offhand at Apple's site.

Sorry, I'm not sure and I just trashed G4FanControl but if you Google
it you can download it and try it.  When you start the program the
default values for three of the temperature thresholds are displayed.

Yup--fan display set to on.

I don't need it, my fan works great.  I just wanted to see how it

The iStat pro widget registers my fan! (iBook 1.33)

It did at first and then it stopped for about 7 updates and then
started again.
