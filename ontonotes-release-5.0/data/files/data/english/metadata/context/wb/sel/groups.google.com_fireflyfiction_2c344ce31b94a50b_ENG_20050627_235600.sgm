The Peace of Marduk
By Fish &amp; RSB

* * *

&quot;And you're certain that you'll be able to deliver the cargo to Ananke on
schedule, Captain Reynolds? You're certain that there'll be absolutely no
interference from official channels? That my -&quot;

&quot;It'll be fine,&quot; Malcolm Reynolds assured the anxious businessman. &quot;Allow me to
put all your fears to rest, Mr. Neveu; my ship and I don't have any kinds of
dealings with the Alliance unless it can't be avoided, and I think a simple
delivery, such as yours, will go smooth as glass.&quot;

Manuel Neveu frowned. &quot;And, and you'll be sure that everything will be intact,
won't you?&quot;

&quot;Very sure. Won't no harm come to your cargo if I have anything to say about
it.&quot; He paused and turned to glance at Zoe over his shoulder, then cleared his
throat. &quot;Pardon me, if we have anything to say about it. Because, my crew will
do their best to ensure that... uhm, it'll be fine.&quot;

&quot;I just want to be sure, I don't, I don't uhm, usually resort to these
measures, but with the tariffs on alcohol these days-&quot;

Mal spoke up quickly over Neveu as Zoe raised her eyebrows. &quot;Well, we really do
need to be getting on our travels, Mr. Neveu, if we're to get your goods to
where they're supposed to be on time. Bye now.&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes, thank you so much, Captain,&quot; Neveu said gratefully. &quot;It was so nice
of Inara to introduce us. I hope she's well?&quot;

&quot;Yes, uhm, very well.&quot; Mal started towards where Serenity was docked at Neveu's
private landing. &quot;We'll send you a wave once we've made the drop. You have
yourself a nice day now, and let me worry about the rest.&quot; Mal and Zoe quickly
boarded the ship and retracted the ramp with a wave goodbye.

&quot;Sir.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, Zoe?&quot;

&quot;Am I correct in thinking we're smuggling a load of alcohol to Ananke?&quot;

Mal tried to school his face into a blank expression. &quot;Might be that's so,
might not. Either way, I'm ordering you to make sure not a word of this gets
back to Jayne. You hear me? Not even a whiff.&quot;

Zoe nodded, amused. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;

&quot;Good. Then tell that husband of yours to take us out of the world and set a
course for Ananke.&quot; Mal began climbing the stairs up out of the cargo bay, with
Zoe following close behind.

&quot;Ananke's not a four day trip from Persephone, we won't have to rush to make
the delivery.&quot;

&quot;I know, that's why I like this job,&quot; agreed Mal. &quot;A nice easy run, with a nice
relaxing trip. Smooth sailing.&quot;

&quot;You're forgetting the part where we have Jayne and a load of rum.&quot;

&quot;Not a word, Zoe.&quot;

&quot;Sir.&quot;

As they stepped off the stairs and into a corridor, Mal stopped and turned to
Zoe. &quot;In fact, don't breathe a word of this to anybody. Just don't. More likely
to make it to Ananke with a complete inventory that way.&quot;

As they passed through the mess hall, Jayne looked up from cleaning his pistol.
&quot;Hey, what's our cargo, again?&quot;

Mal and Zoe exchanged nervous glances, and then replied together, &quot;Rugs.&quot;

* * *

The following evening at dinner, Jayne ate halfheartedly and slammed his cup
down on the table.

&quot;Jayne, is there a reason for all that mess and fuss you're making, or am I
going to have ask you to eat alone from now on?&quot; Mal asked around a mouthful of
tomato.

&quot;Gorrammit, Mal, I just want something with a little more bite to it, not this
lan-dan jiang.&quot;

&quot;That's water, Jayne.&quot;

&quot;I know that!&quot; Jayne tossed his fork onto the table sullenly. &quot;I could really
go for a cask of rum right now. Somethin', anything!&quot;

Mal looked at Zoe suspiciously, then went back to his meal after Zoe shrugged
innocently. He didn't pay much attention as Shepherd Book and Jayne began
talking about the merits of abstaining from alcohol, or when Kaylee wondered
out loud exactly what kind of cargo they were delivering to Ananke. He only
paid a half ear when River started with her crazy talk again.

&quot;The sheep are not what they appear to be. They bleat for help when they're
stuck in the mud or when they've got their feet twisted up beneath them. So
many feet, so many sheep.&quot;

The conversations going on around the table fell silent as they turned to stare
at River. In the quiet, muted beeping echoed down into the mess from the
cockpit. Mal flicked a crouton at Wash. &quot;Hey, you gonna answer that?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh, sure.&quot; Wash stood up from the table slowly and headed towards the
cockpit with several glances back over his shoulder at River. &quot;Don't let Jayne
touch my food.&quot;

Jayne smirked and stole an olive off of Wash's salad.

Mal prodded his lettuce around absently and asked Simon, &quot;You want to tell me
what that was all about, Doctor? I don't usually mind when she gets all
creepy-like, but that was unusual even for her.&quot;

&quot;I have no idea, Captain,&quot; Simon said, facing his sister. &quot;River, that was
very... uhm, cryptic. What were you trying to say?&quot;

&quot;They're sheep. Sheep in wolf's clothing. Take off grandma's dress, find the
wolf inside. They follow a shepherd who's lost his way. Sun at his back,
leading them away from home and the sea. They're lost.&quot;

Jayne stabbed a carrot with his fork and grumbled, &quot;Yeah, that sure cleared up
a whole lot.&quot;

Wash came back into the mess hall and rested his hands on the back of his
chair. &quot;That signal we picked up was a distress beacon, coming from a ship not
too far from here. How River heard the signal, I have no idea.&quot;

Book leaned forward and laced his fingers together. &quot;Did they say what kind of
trouble they're in?&quot;

&quot;I don't know,&quot; Wash admitted. &quot;Something to do with their engine being down
and they're adrift. Should I change course?&quot;

Mal wiped his mouth and pushed away from the table. &quot;Think maybe I'll see if I
can have a little chat with the folks first. Wouldn't want to leap before we
look around a bit.&quot; He followed Wash back to the cockpit and sat down in front
of the monitor. He nodded for Wash to transmit. &quot;This is Captain Reynolds, we
picked up your distress beacon. What kind of trouble you folks in?&quot;

A blond man appeared on the monitor, dressed in starched maroon robes. A little
girl in a long dress of the same material in a pale yellow stood looking over
his shoulder. &quot;Greetings, Captain, I am Ammon of the Amaterasu. The peace of
Merodach be with you.&quot;

&quot;Uh yeah, and thanks. Same to you.&quot;

&quot;Our engine broke down a week ago, and our engineer tells me that we lack the
part necessary to fix it. Is there anything you could do for us?&quot; He spoke in
tranquil, measured tones.

&quot;Well, I could have my mechanic hop on over to your ship, take a look at what's
wrong. There's maybe something she could do for you, that being there's a way
she might be compensated for her time,&quot; Mal said.

Ammon bowed his head slightly. &quot;I'm sure we'll be able to arrange something,
Captain. We look forward to meeting you soon. Pax Ba'al Merodach.&quot;

Mal switched off the signal and stood up. &quot;Wash, is it going to be any
inconvenience to stop and see what's wrong their engine?&quot;

&quot;Not if we make it a short one.&quot;

&quot;Fine, then. Change our course, and let me know when we get there,&quot; he
instructed.

As Mal headed back down to finish his dinner, Wash called to him. &quot;So who do
you think this Merodach character is?&quot;

&quot;Whoever he is, let's hope he pays well for our good will.&quot;

* * *

Mal stood warily by the airlock, waiting for Serenity to finish docking
procedures. A few moments after hearing the airlock seal with a satisfying
thud, the inner hatch opened, and Ammon stepped into Serenity's cargo hold. A
young woman followed shyly behind him.

&quot;Captain Reynolds,&quot; Ammon said by way of greeting, dipping his head in an
abbreviated bow. &quot;Pax Ba'al Merodach. Once again, I thank you for coming to
our aid. I offer the traditional Offerings of the Glorious Conflagration of
Merodach to you as a token of friendship.&quot;

The woman trailing behind him stepped forward, head bowed, and held up a fruit
cupped in her palms to Mal, who took it awkwardly. She reached into her robes
again and produced a small, bright-red frog, holding it forward expectantly.
&quot;Will you not partake of the Blazing Oracle of the Eleven Fiery Visions?&quot;

&quot;Maybe another time,&quot; Mal said hesitantly. &quot;Thanks though. As for the rest, it
wasn't too far out of our way.&quot; Nodding behind him, he said, &quot;This is part of
my crew. Zoe, my first mate, Shepherd Book, and Kaylee, my mechanic. She'll
be the one takin' a look at those scrambled engines of yours.&quot;

With a wave of his hand, Ammon gestured to the woman, who had returned the frog
to its hiding place. &quot;Cayde, please escort the young lady to our engine room
and give her any assistance she requires.&quot; He smiled at Kaylee, who looked all
too eager to be getting her hands dirty. &quot;You will be working with our
engineer, Telesto. He will meet you there.&quot;

&quot;If it's alright with you, I'd like to accompany Kaylee,&quot; Shepherd Book spoke
up. &quot;Give her a hand if she needs one, maybe learn more about the peace of
Merodach.&quot;

Ammon inclined his head and Mal agreed with a quiet ok. &quot;Well, if you'd like
to accompany me up to the mess, perhaps we can put this glorious conflagration
on display where all might enjoy it and maybe have ourselves a friendly
palaver.&quot;

&quot;As Merodach wills it.&quot;

The Captain paused a moment to take that in then nodded agreeably and led his
guest up towards the dining area.

* * *

Clutching her toolbox in her arms, Kaylee glanced about the dilapidated
interior of the Amaterasu curiously. Cayde was walking slightly ahead of them,
parting a path through the crowded corridors. Interestingly, collisions were
quite rare, and when they occurred the individuals involved immediately
apologized with a slight dip of the head and a muttered request for
forgiveness.

&quot;Everyone keeps talking about someone named Merodach. Who is he?&quot;

At that moment, Cayde reached out to grab the arm of a man wearing a maroon
tunic. &quot;Namu Pax Ba'al Merodach,&quot; she said reflexively as she released his arm
and turned to Kaylee and Shepherd. &quot;This is my husband, Percival. He is a
high priest of the order.&quot; She smiled sweetly at her husband. &quot;Kaylee wishes
to learn about Merodach.&quot; They began walking again towards the engine
room.

Percival tugged at his collar thoughtfully. &quot;Merodach, son of Ea, slayer of
Tiamat. Merodach is life, Merodach is death, Merodach is eternity...&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Kaylee interrupted brightly. &quot;He's a god.&quot;

Percival frowned. &quot;Merodach is not a god. He is the one, true God, bringer of
peace and keeper of the Soulfires within us.&quot;

Book raised an eyebrow at this, but wisely refrained from commenting. The
group navigated a sharp left turn and stepped into the engine room. Standing
in the center of the room with his hands clasped neatly behind his back and his
eyes closed was a young man dressed in yellow. He glanced up at their arrival
and stepped forward to greet them. &quot;Pax Ba'al Merodach. I apologize for my
inattention. I was praying while waiting for your arrival. I am Telesto.&quot;

Kaylee extended her hand, which Telesto stared at fearfully for a few moments
before she let it drop awkwardly to her side. &quot;I'm Kaylee. I understand
there's a problem with your engines?&quot;

&quot;Yes. They stopped functioning seven days ago. We have prayed to Merodach for
deliverance from the infinity.&quot; Telesto smiled blandly. &quot;Then Merodach
delivered you to us.&quot;

Kaylee smiled back nervously as she knelt to lay her tools out on the metal
grating. &quot;Mind if I take a look?&quot;

* * *

&quot;Maybe you were supposed to, you know...&quot; Wash trailed off as he followed Zoe
down the scaffolding to the cargo hold.

Zoe shook her head. &quot;I don't, actually. Strange women in robes holding up frogs
doesn't exactly fall into my experiences, husband.&quot;

&quot;Well, maybe you were supposed to, maybe get closer to the frog,&quot; he suggested,
holding up his hands in a pantomime. &quot;Real close. Like, he's a
prince-in-disguise closer.&quot;

&quot;I don't know that I want to get that close to anything that involves the word
`burning'.&quot;

&quot;What about visions?&quot; Wash pressed. &quot;Fiery visions. Eleven of them.&quot;

Zoe turned to Wash to say something, but stopped, staring over his shoulder.

&quot;Now you're starting to see the frog's appeal. Aren't you? Zoe?&quot; he looked at
his shoulders. &quot;Is there something on me?&quot;

&quot;Correct me if I'm wrong, Wash, but I don't think we were supposed to have any
more visitors hanging around the airlock,&quot; she explained, indicating the two
maroon-clad figures huddling around the controls. She crossed the hold, raising
her voice. &quot;Excuse me, but may I ask what you're doing here?&quot;

A man pulled his hood back and dipped his head. &quot;Namu Pax Ba'al Merodach. We
did not mean to intrude, but my wife is with child and she was overcome. I
brought her here because I thought the fresh air would be good for her. I am
Assander, the peace of Merodach be with you.&quot;

The other figure turned, keeping her head bowed, though she was clearly
pregnant. &quot;Pax Ba'al Merodach. I am Elara, the peace of Merodach be with you.
This is such a lovely ship. Truly we have been blessed by your arrival.&quot;

&quot;Well, we're glad to be such a blessing,&quot; Wash replied.

Zoe half turned and indicated the other end of the hold. &quot;Actually, we have a
doctor of our very own. Perhaps he could take a look at that child of yours,
make sure it was coming up healthy.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for your generosity,&quot; Assander said, moving to leave. &quot;But we would
not want to be any trouble. The peace of Merodach be with you.&quot;

Wash shrugged and turned around, but Zoe grabbed his arm and spun him around.
&quot;No, it's no problem at all. The infirmary is just this way.&quot;

Assander hesitated, and then nodded as Elara looked down at her stomach with
concern. He made a noise in his nasal cavity. &quot;We will follow you.&quot;

* * *

&quot;Thank the heavens that Merodach has granted us salvation from the darkness.
He sent you as a flame to drive away the night.&quot; Ammon paused as he sliced the
fruit with a ceremonial knife produced from his robes. Blood-red juices
dribbled from the seams onto the rough wooden table. &quot;If you had not arrived
and offered us help, we would surely have been devoured by Tiamat and
her...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, so about that compensation,&quot; Mal interrupted, taking a piece of pulp and
popping it into his mouth. &quot;What can you offer us?&quot;

Ammon continued unabated. &quot;The blessings of Merodach are strange and
mysterious in nature. It is often difficult to comprehend his motives. Some
of our weaker brothers had begun to lose faith in his methods when our engines
failed, but now that you have arrived his plans have once again become
clear...&quot;

&quot;Yes. And I'd be interested to know if any of those plans involved payment of
some type.&quot; Mal cleared his throat, reaching for a glass of water. The fruit
was oddly spicy.

&quot;Ah, yes, to worldly matters. We can provide you with the complete Book of
Merodach, so it may stir the Inner Fires of your Soul.&quot;

&quot;My soul fires are fine, thanks. How about something more practical?&quot;

Ammon sighed, clearly disappointed. &quot;Very well. We have an excess of water
and could part with some.&quot;

&quot;How much?&quot;

&quot;Fifty liters.&quot;

&quot;Sixty and you've got yourself a deal.&quot;

Ammon waved his hand in acquiescence. &quot;It is done.&quot; Ammon flicked his wrist
and the knife reappeared in his hand. He made an arcane gesture with it, and
then the remainder of the fruit appeared in his other palm. He began cutting
more slices.

Mal cleared his throat and reached for his glass again. &quot;Actually, I've, uh,
I've had enough, thank you.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps your followers will wish to partake,&quot; Ammon replied, indicating Zoe
and Wash as they approached, Assander and Elara in tow.

&quot;My followers?&quot; Mal repeated, looking over his shoulder. He guffawed as spotted
his first officer and pilot. &quot;Oh, those two never follow orders. Zoe, Wash, I
see you've made some friends. How about the four of you partake of this
glorious conflagration as a sign of friendship?&quot;

Wash raised a hand and stepped forward with a bounce. &quot;I'd love to, Captain.&quot;
He winked at Zoe and whispered, &quot;Fiery visions.&quot;

Zoe pointed toward the visitors. &quot;Sir, we're looking for Simon. Elara here's in
the family way and we're looking for Simon to maybe see that the baby's fine.&quot;
She looked at Wash who was mouthing the word `Eleven' at her and grinning.

&quot;I think I let him take his harebrained sister up to the bridge to look at
those stars she likes so much,&quot; Mal admitted. He took a piece of fruit and
handed over to Zoe, who took a cautious bite. &quot;Although, I must say I wasn't
expecting any more of Ammon's fine followers to be coming aboard.&quot;

Ammon bowed his head and made a sign with his fingers. &quot;May Tiamat graze upon
my innards at the world's ending, Captain Reynolds. These two will be
disciplined for their behavior.&quot; He gave Assander a sidelong glare. The younger
man met Ammon's gaze for a second, then bowed and repeated Ammon's sign.

&quot;She just needed some fresh air,&quot; Zo insisted.

&quot;It was no intrusion,&quot; Mal agreed. &quot;There's no need to make with the
discipline. In fact, I think it'd do to give the good doctor a distraction. And
it'd get him and his sister off my bridge.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, if our business is complete, Captain, I shall return to my ship. I
trust my followers will not inflict themselves upon you any longer than
necessary in order to insure the health of the child,&quot; said Ammon.

As Ammon passed, Assander leaned in and whispered, &quot;It is done.&quot;

The exchange went unnoticed. The captain moved to escort Ammon back to his
ship. Ammon handed Mal a leather-bound book in a deep scarlet with strange
runes stamped upon the cover in gold. Underneath, an English translation
proclaimed it the Book of Merodach. &quot;In case you change your mind,&quot; the man
said with a slight smile.

Zoe tugged Wash along behind her towards the bridge. She asked him, &quot;How are
those visions, dear?&quot;

Wiping at tears and coughing, Wash shook his head. &quot;Fiery.&quot;

* * *

&quot;Well, it looks like you're going to have a healthy baby,&quot; Simon declared,
taking a step back from Elara. &quot;Would you like to know the gender?&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Assander said. &quot;Merodach forbids such knowledge. It is said that to
know a child's gender before it comes into this world is to invite the wrath of
Tiamat upon the birth. Both mother and child would be at great risk.&quot; He looked
over his shoulder as River poked her head in through the doorway.

&quot;A human pregnancy is remarkably similar to a parasitic invasion of a host by
Echinococcus granulosus,&quot; she said. &quot;Signs and symptoms resemble those of a
space-occupying tumor.&quot;

Simon cleared his throat as Wash suppressed a snicker. Assander and Elara
looked confused. &quot;You'll have to excuse my sister,&quot; Simon said. &quot;She's, well
she's very, that is, she's-&quot;

&quot;She sees with the light of Merodach,&quot; Elara said. &quot;It is a rare blessing, to
understand such disparate things. And in one so young. We have one like her
aboard our ship.&quot; She nodded to River, &quot;The peace of Merodach be with you.&quot;

&quot;Marduk slew chaos, creating the world from Tiamat's body and man from Kingu's
blood,&quot; she replied. &quot;Ea decreed that if you take life, life will be taken from
you.&quot;

&quot;We should return to our vessel,&quot; Assander spoke up. &quot;Thank you for your
assistance, Doctor. The peace of Merodach be with you in abundance.&quot; He
enunciated the name of his patron deity very clearly and motioned for Elara to
join him as he left the infirmary.

River took a step forward, blocking their exit. &quot;Marduk had to prove his
worthiness to Ea before attaining the godhead. Many times, Ea threatened to
strip him of his powers if he did not repent from wrongful and foolish deeds.&quot;

Simon took his sister's hand and gently guided her away from the doorway. &quot;I'm
sorry about that,&quot; he said to Assander.

&quot;It is nothing,&quot; Assander said in response. He made an arcane gesture with his
fingers in front of River. &quot;The peace of Merodach be with you, child. May the
Supreme Fire cleanse you of any impurities and allow the sight of Merodach to
illumine your steps.&quot; He stepped past River, who stuck her tongue out at his
back.

* * *

&quot;Well, here's your problem right here,&quot; Kaylee said from underneath the
Amaterasu's engine. Gritting her teeth, she yanked hard on her wrench, and
with a satisfying clang the malfunctioning piece of machinery hit the deck.

&quot;Are you alright, Kaylee?&quot; Shepherd's voice drifted over from the hallway where
he was chatting with Percival.

&quot;Fine,&quot; she grunted, replacing the casing before handing her toolbox and the
broken intake valve to Telesto. Crawling out, she pushed herself to her feet.
With a content sigh, she brushed the hair back from her eyes and pointed to the
scorches on the valve where the metal had been welded shut by extreme heat.

&quot;Piece's melted,&quot; Kaylee announced proudly. &quot;I can't fix it, but I've got a
spare you folks can use.&quot;

&quot;We are very grateful for your assistance, Kaylee. May Merodach bless you and
your companions,&quot; Telesto said, fingering the broken part almost nervously.
Kaylee smiled, trying to put him at ease, and bent down to straighten up her
toolbox.

&quot;Have you had any visitors recently?&quot; she asked as she wiped the grease from
her hands with a rag.

&quot;You are the first that Merodach has blessed us with in many days,&quot; Telesto
replied.

Kaylee stood and took the broken part from his hands, examining it once more
with a frown. Shrugging, she handed it back and bent down once more.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Telesto asked. He definitely sounded anxious now.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; she replied, chewing on her lip. &quot;It's just that, if I didn't know
otherwise, I'd say that the damage had been caused deliberate, like.&quot;

There was a long pause, and Kaylee glanced over her shoulder. &quot;I didn't mean-&quot;

Something blunt and very heavy slammed into her upper arm. With a startled
yelp, she tumbled onto her back, curling her body protectively around her
shoulder. Telesto stood over her, a pipe clenched in his sweaty hands. He
looked almost apologetic.

&quot;Merodach forgive me.&quot;

The pipe caught her above the eye, throwing her into blackness.

* * *

Percival shook his head angrily and made a slashing motion with his hand. &quot;Your
god is insignificant next to the power of Asaruludu, truly the light of gods,
the mighty leader.&quot;

&quot;I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree with you, Percival,&quot; Shepherd Book
replied.

&quot;Has your god,&quot; Percival spat, &quot;defeated the mighty chaos dragon, Tiamat? Did
he wrestle with eternity and stand forward when no other god had the courage to
face the rampaging waters of destiny?&quot;

Book licked his lips and tried to remain calm. He began to explain his belief
that Merodach was a false god created to distract worship from the True Lord
when he heard a thud followed by a scream. He and Percival leaned into the
engine room to see Telesto taking a step back from a motionless Kaylee. The
Amaterasu's engineer looked up at Book and Percival in alarm, and then slapped
a control that began closing the engine room door.

The shepherd jumped back from the door and stared at Percival blankly. The
Follower of Merodach stared back, equally stunned. Percival realized what had
happened and his hands shot forward in an attack that Book deftly blocked. The
two struggled in the corridor briefly until the heel of Book's hand connected
with Percival's nose. Percival's head snapped back, colliding with the
bulkhead. Book looked up in alarm as hurried footsteps echoed from further up
the corridor. He looked about anxiously before spotting an open air duct in the
ceiling. The shepherd leapt up, caught hold of some ceiling piping and hauled
himself into the crawlspace.

Below, several of Percival's fellows clustered around the unconscious zealot.
The little girl that had appeared on the viewscreen glided into their midst and
the crowd dispersed. Book held his breath as their leader, Ammon, appeared.

&quot;Telesto, I pray you open this door with all due haste,&quot; Ammon intoned. The
door opened. Telesto stepped forward and prostrated himself before Ammon.

&quot;Namu Pax Ba'al Merodach,&quot; Telesto said in a shaky voice. &quot;The, the mechanic
discovered that the engine had been tampered with purposefully. She, she was
suspicious. I was forced to subdue her.&quot;

Ammon indicated for Telesto to rise. &quot;Peace of Merodach be with you, Telesto.
You have done no wrong. Merodach has delivered unto us a gift.&quot; He turned to
address his followers still gathered in the corridor. &quot;A sacrifice. It is
written in the Nineteenth Prophecy of the Tablet of Destinies. We shall offer
up this virgin girl to Merodach in thanks for his many blessings,&quot; he said with
inspired fervor. &quot;Zanna, make preparations for the Glorious Ritual of Searing
Incandescent Consumption.&quot;

As Ammon led his followers away, the little girl remained, staring up at Book's
hiding place. Book began crawling towards what he reckoned was the general
direction of Serenity, spurred on by a growing dread. The strange little girl,
visible through the air duct grating, kept pace with him, head thrown back and
blue eyes gazing up at the ceiling, until she was called away.

&quot;Himalia, attend,&quot; a voice came from down the corridor. Himalia stared at Book
for a few heartbeats more, then disappeared around the corner silently.

Breathing a sigh of relief, Book continued crawling towards Serenity. It wasn't
long, however, before his sense of direction failed him within the narrow
confines of the ship. It was as though he was being driven deeper into the
Amaterasu, and soon Book was forced to admit that he was, in fact, lost.

* * *

&quot;So what are you going to name your baby?&quot; Zoe asked, squeezing Wash's arm in a
none-too-subtle hint.

Elara gave her a fearful look. &quot;It is forbidden to speak the name of the child
aloud until it is able to hear it, and to take the name as its own.&quot;

They stopped outside Elara and Assander's quarters, and Wash flattened himself
against the wall to get out of the way of the people filling the corridor.
&quot;Okay,&quot; he said agreeably, giving his wife a look that was both familiar and
meaningful. &quot;Well, it was nice meeting you. Bye now.&quot;

&quot;Could you point us towards the engine room? I'd like to see how our mechanic
is getting on with those repairs.&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Assander said politely, giving them a short list of turns to make.
With directions and many blessings from Merodach, Zoe and Wash began making
their way through the crowded ship, drawing stares from the other
passengers.

&quot;They're having a baby, honey,&quot; Zoe observed, hooking her arm through Wash's.
&quot;And they live on a spaceship. Can't we have a baby, even though we live on a
spaceship?&quot;

&quot;Just because everyone else is doing it doesn't mean we can too,&quot; Wash replied.
In response, Zoe cuddled up next to him and he sighed in exasperation. &quot;Zoe,
we've been through this - Serenity is no place for a baby.&quot;

Zoe drew back a little. &quot;You think I wouldn't be a good mother?&quot;

&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Wash reassured hurriedly, planting a kiss on the top of her head.
&quot;You'd be a great mother. The best. But even you can't protect a child at
every moment. Remember the fire, when you were hurt?&quot;

Zoe nodded, and started to interrupt, but Wash held up a hand.

&quot;No, wait. Zoe, I was so worried about you. The ship was falling apart, we
were off course, but I didn't care. I was totally focused on you. Everyone
else was trying to keep Serenity in one piece...if we had had a child, I don't
know who...&quot; His voice trailed off, and he stopped in the hallway, reaching
out to gently catch her face between his palms. &quot;Baby, you would be a
wonderful mother, and when the time is right, you will be. But not here. Not
now. Our children deserve to grow up in a place where they are safe and where
they will always have two parents that will love them.&quot;

Zoe looked up at him uncertainly. &quot;So someday we'll have a baby?&quot;

&quot;As many as you want,&quot; Wash assured, leaning down to kiss her softly. People
filed around them, whispering and pointing, obviously uncomfortable in Zoe and
Wash's presence. Noticing the stares, Wash straightened, breaking the kiss.
Taking her hand in his, he gave it a gentle squeeze, but didn't let go as they
resumed their walk to the engine room.

&quot;You don't want Jayne to end up raising our baby, do you, dear?&quot; he joked.

&quot;So when we do have a baby,&quot; Zoe began. &quot;What do you want to name her?&quot;

&quot;Her?&quot; Wash repeated. &quot;I think we should come up with a name that could work
regardless of whether it was a her or a him. Like Jayne. Think about it.&quot;

&quot;I'm not naming my daughter after Jayne,&quot; she insisted. &quot;Or my son for that
matter.&quot;

&quot;I've always enjoyed the notion of scalding a young man named Junior,&quot; Wash
said hopefully.

Zoe laughed as they made the last proscribed turn and stepped into the engine
room, startling a man hunched over the engine. &quot;Uhm, excuse me, we're looking
for Kaylee.&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes! Pax Ba'al Merodach,&quot; Telesto greeted. He mopped his brow with the
sleeve of his yellow robes. &quot;Well, she is, that is, she left. Returned to your
ship. Along with the Shepherd.&quot; He turned back to the engine. &quot;Peace of
Merodach be with you.&quot;

The couple stood in the doorway a few moments, then slowly turned and started
making their way back to the ship. After a few wrong turns, and many mumbled
apologies, Zoe and Wash stepped back through the airlock and onto Serenity.

In the open space of the cargo hold, Mal and Jayne were tossing horseshoes.
Wash leapt out of the way of a particularly ill-aimed toss by Jayne.

&quot;Did you see the blissful couple safely home?&quot; Mal asked.

&quot;That we did, sir,&quot; Zoe agreed.

&quot;Guess I'll go get ready to leave, seeing as we're pretty much done here,&quot; Wash
said, starting up the stairs to the bridge. &quot;Right?&quot;

&quot;Don't go getting too ahead of yourself there,&quot; Mal told him. He made a face as
his horseshoe missed the mark. &quot;We're missing our mechanic, we're missing our
shepherd, and we're missing our water, so we're not leaving just yet.&quot;

&quot;We're missing our water?&quot; Wash asked.

&quot;We're missing Kaylee and Book?&quot; Zoe said over her husband. &quot;Didn't they come
back?&quot;

&quot;Because that's what the flustered yellow guy said,&quot; Wash added.

Mal shook his head. &quot;Haven't side a hair of either of them since they left.&quot;

Wash shrugged. &quot;Possible they could have gotten lost in that dirty old ship.
Lost in those cramped, dank, crowded, dank...&quot; He trailed off. &quot;So, we're
missing our water?&quot;

&quot;Ammon's graciously offered us sixty liters in addition to the complete Book of
Merodach.&quot;

&quot;Is it... fire water?&quot; Wash pressed. &quot;Did he say how many visions it came with?&quot;

&quot;Not now, dear,&quot; Zoe said. She turned back to the captain. &quot;Sir, do you think
one of us might maybe want to go looking for them? This side trip is starting
to take a little longer than we'd planned.&quot;

&quot;We've still got a few hours before we're late to Ananke,&quot; Mal said. He tapped
his chin thoughtfully while Jayne lined up his next shot. Jayne overthrew his
horseshoe again.

Zoe turned to the captain. Mal had a deeply thoughtful expression on his face.
&quot;Sir?&quot;

&quot;I'm just a little confused, is all,&quot; he admitted. &quot;It shouldn't be taking this
long for Kaylee to fix up their ship. And Wash is right that they've been a
little slow to get us our payment... although they were pretty quick with the
great and fiery Book of Merodach.&quot; He started out of the cargo bay towards the
bridge. &quot;I'm gonna go call our friend Ammon, see what he has to say about all
this.&quot;

On the bridge, Zoe and Book crowded over Mal's shoulder as he sat down in front
of the viewer. Wash took his customary pilot's seat and pushed his dinosaurs
around lazily. Jayne leaned on his elbow in the doorway, making a face.

&quot;I'm dialing the ship now,&quot; Wash announced, reaching up to flip a set of three
switches.

Mal wiped at the tiny camera set above the viewscreen. Ammon appeared on the
screen bearing a beatific expression. His fingers described an intricate symbol
before his smiling visage and he made a little bow. &quot;Captain Reynolds. It is my
profound delight to speak with you again so soon, my dear friend. Peace of
Merodach be with you in abundance. Have you discovered the Illuminated Path to
the Enflamed Spirit as witnessed by the Twenty-Third Prophet of the Fiery
Vision?&quot;

&quot;Uh, no, not actually,&quot; Mal admitted. &quot;Though I was hoping a prophet of some
kind could illuminate the path back to Serenity for a few of my
crewmembers.&quot;

Ammon's ear-to-ear smile widened. &quot;If you are speaking of your engineer,
Captain, allow me to put all your fears to rest. A scorching prophecy struck
down my engineer nearly a week ago, prompting the young man to sabotage our
vessel. You may have become informed of the truly wretched condition Merodach
has placed us in as a test of faith. But no more! For in our time of trial,
Merodach bestowed upon his sons and daughters a gift and a blessing. Serenity
will carry the Blessed Light throughout the `verse, once she has been properly
illumined. Your mechanic, though, has an even more glorious destiny, for she
will be sacrificed to Esizkur, sitting aloft in the house of prayer, that his
worshipers may bring their presents before him. That, from him, they may
receive their assignments. Everything is as Merodach wills it.&quot; Ammon raised
his chin upward, brought his fists to his chest then bowed deeply.

&quot;She ain't a virgin!&quot; Jayne offered loudly.

Mal glared over his shoulder then turned back to Ammon. &quot;If you so much as lay
a hand on her-&quot;

&quot;Please, Captain,&quot; Ammon interjected, shaking his head sadly. &quot;There is no need
to resort to base threats. We are not barbarians; it is in fact a great honor
to be offered up to Esizkur, sitting aloft in the house of prayer. Rejoice, for
she shall see the light of Merodach. Now, please excuse me, Captain;
preparations for the ceremony are almost complete and my presence is required.&quot;
Ammon disappeared from the screen.

Mal got to his feet. &quot;Zoe, you're with me, we're going to go get our mechanic
back, and then we're leaving these nutjobs right where we found them. Jayne,
you'll stay aboard the ship, make sure none of Ammon's crew gets aboard and
tries to start illuminating things. Wash, get the ship started, and be ready to
go as soon as we're back.&quot; He started out of the bridge.

&quot;Sir? We're going to get our shepherd back, too, right?&quot; Zoe called after him.

&quot;Yeah, him, too! And tell that doctor to be ready in case something goes
terribly, horribly wrong!&quot;

Something with the consistency of honey slid down the bridge of her nose,
gathering in a pool on her upper lip. Kaylee tried to raise her hand to wipe
away the offending substance, but something held her arm firmly to her side, so
instead she licked it off with the tip of her tongue. The stuff was acrid, and
she began to gag as it hit the back of her throat.

&quot;Do you desire water?&quot; a voice asked, and Kaylee opened her eyes to find Cayde,
the young woman who had escorted her earlier, standing beside her. Weakly, she
nodded, and Cayde held a cup to her lips while Kaylee washed the bitter taste
from her mouth. After a moment, Cayde stepped back, and Kaylee pulled her
wrists and ankles ineffectually against their bindings.

&quot;What happened? What was that stuff? Why am I all tied up?&quot; she asked, words
quickened and jumbled by fear. Unfamiliar hands began rubbing a sticky, sweet
lotion onto her stomach; she tried to jerk away, but was held fast at the
hips.

&quot;Do not be frightened,&quot; Cayde said calmly as she reached out a finger covered
in black goo and touched it to Kaylee's cheek. &quot;You were chosen as a virgin
sacrifice to Merodach, to thank him for his many gifts. These ashes,&quot; Cayde
gestured to a bowl on a nearby table, &quot;are of the Blazing Oracle of the Eleven
Fiery Visions and will mark you so that Merodach will accept your Soulfire into
his house of prayer. You are restrained to ensure that the preparations will
be completed with all expediency.&quot;

Kaylee's laugh was high-pitched and slightly hysterical. &quot;This has all been a
huge misunderstanding. You can't sacrifice me, I'm not a virgin, I have sex
all the time. Every day. With any man that has a pulse, in fact,
honest...&quot;

Cayde gave her a look of profound pity. &quot;It is a great honor to be chosen,&quot;
she repeated. &quot;Do not disgrace yourself in the eyes of Merodach by lying.&quot;

&quot;I'm not lying!&quot; Kaylee shouted in panic. &quot;I'VE HAD SEX!&quot; But her protests
went unheard. Twisting her head wildly, her wide eyes fell upon another woman
who had a very tight grasp on one of the little red frogs she had seen earlier
in Serenity's cargo hold. Without so much as a second thought, the woman
dropped the frog into a bowl of blazing flames. The frog writhed in the
inferno for a few moments before being incinerated. The cultist sprinkled
water on the fire until it was extinguished; all that was left of the frog was
smoke and a watery paste of ashes. Cayde took the cooling bowl from her
colleague, dipped her finger in, and began to smear the still-warm remains onto
Kaylee's forehead.

Mal kicked aside trash and got his foot tangled in a discarded rag. He shook it
off and stopped, biting his lip. &quot;Zoe, I hate to have to ask you this in such a
dire situation.&quot;

&quot;Sir?&quot;

&quot;Do you have any idea where we are?&quot;

&quot;In fact I don't, sir,&quot; Zoe admitted. &quot;I was just following you.&quot;

&quot;I was expecting some weird chanting or humming or conflagrations to illumine
our way,&quot; he explained. &quot;I didn't think we'd actually have to search the whole
gorram ship.&quot; He took a step back from the intersection as the sound of racing
footsteps approached from the opposite direction. Mal put his foot out and a
cultist tripped and sprawled on the deck. He pushed himself halfway to his feet
and the captain hauled him the rest of the way. &quot;Hi. Maybe you could give us
some directions.&quot; The young man stammered. Mal rolled his eyes. &quot;Look, kid, we
ain't gonna hurt ya. Unless you and your friends've done something to deserve
it.&quot;
