Dear Friend in Christ,

If you've been following the Mercy Lakefront blog for anytime you know
that Racial Discrimination, Elder Abuse and support of Islamofascist
Terror is omnipresent in Chicago's Mercy Housing.  Perhaps you're one
of those who believe that this 55 year old Scholar should just "Shut
up and take you pills"   as one of our readers comments; perhaps you
believe, like most liberals, that as long as our residents are
provided with subsidized (often free) housing we should just shut up
and put up with any abuses that are thrown our way; perhaps you are
one who thinks that anyone who would dare to expose abuse like the 18
month persecution I was subject to in 2004-2005 that almost threw me
out into the street should count his blessings, be silent concerning
continuing abuses and real physical dangers and feel that it is
ungrateful to expose these continuing atrocities.  Perhaps you're a
typical liberal that wants to keep poor people poor so you can provide
more welfare (while getting your cut courtesy of Uncle Sam) and
continue to control them like the "Management" of Mercy Lakefront -
I'm not sure what you are but know that when I attempted to expose
these things at all the large Catholic Message Boards at MSN and YAHOO
I was silenced and the criminal protected - but Mother Church can be
very xenophobic and protective of her own, despite injustices - never
forget the Pedophile Priests and Joseph Cardinal Law! I've contacted
the Archdiocese of Chicago, Cardinal George and every Catholic agency
I can but they all have done nothing - that's the thanks I get for 55
years of Dedication to the Roman Catholic Church!

I wish to thank my best friend Jesus Christ! I have been accepted in
the Paralegal Certificate Program at Chicago's Roosevelt University,
when I also got my Masters in Music Composition in 1981.

·      Though Lakefront SRO spent nearly two years trying to throw this 55
year old Devout Roman Catholic out into the street they suffered an
ignominious defeat on November 16, 2005 and  I did it

·      Though (Former) Property Manager Laurence Floyd Spent another year
harassing me, tossing Jesus Christ, Holy Crosses and the American Flag
into the trash can (with the approval of Mercy Housing) and I am now
subject to the abuse of a violent Criminal just a few feet away and
get no help at all I did it

·      Though "Management" of Mercy Lakefront continues to violate federal
and state laws and illegally discriminate against this Conservative
Catholic I did it

Thank you Jesus!!!

I'm going to have to locate funding for nearly $10,000 in Tuition for
the Roosevelt Paralegal Program, will need guidance and counseling but
only encounter jealously and abusive hostility from the "Management"
Or Mercy Lakefront Housing.  Although Mercy Lakefront is a part of the
City of Chicago Workforce Investment Act  which can provide up to
$5,000 for tuition and training, I was discouraged from even asking
about it at Mercy Lakefront and, since these "Scholarships" normally
exclude WHITE CHRISTIAN MEN (though Mercy Lakefront gladly distributes
thousand to the criminal Negroes!) and then BANNED from making any
further progress in this, under threat of arrest.   Though I have a
gun shot wound in my left leg and a bad right leg, every day of the
week, I've walked between half a mile and as far as 7 miles per day
just to keep my internet connections current since it my only real
connection to help.  I can get none and expect to get none at all from
Mercy Lakefront Housing but know that the Lord is with me and this
endeavor will be a success. Mother Angelica began EWTN when she was 58
and since I'm only 55 I've got a three year head start! It's going to
be a hard struggle and I can expect no help at all from Mercy
Lakefront SRO since their only reaction has been jejune jealously
(when I tried to post my letter of acceptance on one of our bulleting
boards it was torn down and cast into the trash - 'de brudders know
how dumb it makes them look) and the "Good" Sisters of Mercy will
continue to look the other way:

SHAME ON YOU MERCY HOUSING!!!

This is what I have been subjected to for the last three years:

Sunday, January 21, 2007

To Whom It May Concern:

This letter is intended to file multiple charges of serious Civil
Rights Violations as well as Continuing Elder abuse committed by
employees of Mercy Lakefront Housing at the above address.  It is also
intended to alert the appropriate authorities that, while Mercy
Lakefront SRO Housing  is happy to derive half of its operating budget
from government grants, it does not intend to obey basic laws of the
federal, state and local governments that supply those monies.  While
serious legal violations have existed in this organizations for years,
nothing or substance has been done internally and serious fraud,
misuse of government funds, abuses and possible tax fraud are
rampant.

The writer is a resident of Lakefront/Mercy Housing of five years, a
Roman Catholic of 55 years, who attends Daily Mass and prays all the
mysteries of the Holy Rosary.  I am also a former teacher for the
Chicago Public Schools, Scholar and Author with a Masters Degree so
well area of what is going on here. Details follow:

Through the grace of God I was led to Franciscan Outreach after nearly
three years of the nightmare of homelessness that included a brief
stint at Franciscan Shelter on Harrison Street who in turn led me to
Lincoln Park Community Shelter.

The Legal Violations by Mercy Lakefront SRO housing include:

The Employment, Training and Education Center in questions is public
to all residents of Mercy Lakefront Housing though this one is illegal
denied access.  Additionally since the intention of this illegal
discrimination is to deny this 55 year old resident opportunities for
additional education violations occur involving:

(Source: P.A. 87‑579.)

Nearly two years ago, a new 'intern' known only as "Eric" (he would
not reveal his late name) began conducting 'workshops' in our
facilities, allegedly under the harmless sounding banner of 'poetry'
classes.  Since the writer is also an author and always interested in
creative writing I attended a number of these "poetry" sessions and
was quite shocked at what I heard:

At this point, the gentlemen known only as "Eric" revealed that he was
"a Muslim" and expressed support for Hamas Palestinian Terrorists,
causing considerable concern since this is one of the groups that has
urged that "American kufir" are the enemy and should be killed
whenever possible.  At this point, since the writer is a (temporarily
unemployed) Substitute Teacher for the Chicago Public Schools and
government employee, I began to suspect possible involvement with anti-
American radical groups.

In a casual conservation in our Employment and Training Center, I
asked the gentleman known only as "Eric" if he was aware of the truly
barbaric nature of the Islamic Terrorists and offered to show him an
on line video clip of the beheading of Mr. Eugene Armstrong.  This new
'intern' watched this brutal murder with casual acceptance and only
comments that it was "No big deal", causing this American patriot
additional angst at such a callous comment about this heinous crime by
an individual with an obviously pro-Terrorist agenda.  These shocking
and brutal videos can be viewed at http://terrorwebs.blogspot.com/
which is one of the Counter Terrorism web sites the writer has
maintained since the terrible attack of 09/11/2001. (WARNING - this
site contains GRAPHIC VIOLENCE)

I emailed the gentleman known only as "Eric" accounts of some quite
serious incidents of Islamic Terrorism in America, and was greeted
with a suggestion that I be "Banned" from any computer use at all,
obviously in an attempt to silence me and possibly conceal something.
This passed, so I emailed the gentleman known only as "Eric" the
following, which we must ask of Muslims in America espousing radical
political agendas:

·      Violence:
·      Modernity:
·      Secularism:
·      Islamic pluralism:
·      Self-criticism:
·      Defense against militant Islam:
·      Goals in the West:

Since the gentleman known only as "Eric" had already expressed support
for Palestinian Terrorists and Revolutionary Militants which is
indicative of non-support and outright hatred for the government of
the United States, had forwarded this teacher a short radical and very
alarming paper that claimed that the 09/11/2001 attacks were actually
a US Government Conspiracy and NOT ISLAMIC TERRORISM, and was
obviously interested in getting this resident "Banned" my suspicions
grew and my level of observation increased. Sadly, there was no
response to any of the questions above, so my level of suspicion was
understandably elevated.

Since our Employment and Training Lab has moved to HWA I have been a
regular, pursuing many job leads and considerable research to aid in
my knowledge of my chosen fields of work - Social Work and Writing on
Social Issues (I do a lot on Terrorism and its nefarious connection to
the illegal drug trade that claims so many lives amongst the homeless
since this issue plays a vital role in social work with the
population).  Though I have diligently attempted to stay our of
anyone's way, and require no help, since I am a former Computer
Consultant of 20 years (Computer Consulting resume attached) I sensed
a great deal of hostility and began to suspect that my observations of
the gentleman known only as "Eric" were at the nexus of this dilemma.

The writer had just completed the superb two week "Job Readiness"
Class taught my Ms. Sheila Jackson and was impressed by the superb and
professional job that she does - as a teacher, my only suggestion is
for a bit more emphasis on the availability of training and education
available in the Uptown Area. (this is through the department of
Employment and TRAINING right?)  All  things considering, Ms  Jackson
provides a wealth of information and should be highly rewarded for her
excellent class with a big raise.

The writer is now pursuing a new career in para legal pursuits and
could benefit greatly from additional course work that in only four
and half months can result in a Certified Paralegal Certificate,
funding for which is available through the Mayor's Office of
Employment. Upon starting this program, this would also greatly
enhance my chances of gaining permanent employment as well.  Though
the writer independently investigated this possibility via Chicago
City Colleges (where I applied and was accepted thanks to the on line
services available to us now) Ms. Jackson painted a very dismal
attitude on the part of Lakefront towards this approach, and since we
can pick only one sponsoring agency, the selection of Lakefront now
seems like a very bad idea - a true pity, but my 20 years of sobriety
and volunteer work in AA, 4 years of S.T.A.I.R.S. (a program of
Chicago Health Outreach for the Homeless), and advanced degrees have
only been ridiculed and never taken seriously here so why waste time
and effort?  This attitude seems a rather odd way to regard
"Education" and "Training".

Upon completion of the "Employment Readiness" course this morning, the
writer was greeted by a three panel inquisition (including someone
that I did not even know) and was summarily informed that I would be
"Banned" from our Employment and Training facility for a week - with
the tired old "Hygiene" paradigm being employed as a justification -
rest assured, being in such close proximity to women for half the day,
the writer makes certain that his "Hygiene" is kept just fine.

Upon hearing of this, and understanding the real reason for it this
teacher unfortunately left in anger since this seemed a truly
insulting reward for my two weeks of effort and additional weeks of
job related research.  Since I had earlier this morning filed eight
job applications at http://careercenter.com along with another in
reply to the "Case Manager - South Loop" position at Lakefront but
since Email is my only way of contact at the moment (my community
voice mail was disconnected last month) the writer trusts you can
understand my anger at being treated in such a deplorable and highly
unprofessional fashion, particularly by a group of people half my age.

Leaving our Center, I spied the gentleman known only as "Eric" and
unfortunately called him a "Filthy Muslim Pig" - since I am quite
certain he was at the cause of all of this.  I acted in anger and
haste and after regretting this insensitive choice of words, went back
into the Employment Training Center to 1.) Apologize and 2.) find out
his last name since this matter is being brought to the attention of
the FBI, Homeland Security, the Chicago Police Counter Terrorism Unit
and other agencies that are entrusted with anti-Terrorism activities
and our vital security. Sadly, the writer was angrily chased out
before any of these objectives could be met.

At the time that these events took place, Lakefront SRO (now Mercy
Lakefront) was attempting to evict this resident on a trumped up and
false charge so I did nothing and hope that time would heal all.  On
November 16, 2005 a Jury found Against Lakefront SRO and For George M
Weinert V so though this abusive two year persecution had ended I have
been 'banned' every since.  These events occurred in Feb of 2004 and
Mercy Lakefront Housing has been violating the laws while taking large
financial grants from our government whose statures they consistently
refuse to obey.

Sadly Elder Abuse also plays a role as detailed in this email of:

Sunday, July 23, 2006

Dear Friend in Christ,

The Elder Abuse at Mercy Lakefront Housing in Chicago is continuing
and as of this date, Pursuant to (320 ILCS 20/) Elder Abuse and
Neglect Act. (320 ILCS 20/1) (from Ch. 23, par. 6601) Sec. 1. Short
title. This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Elder Abuse
and Neglect Act". (Source: P.A. 85‑1184.) Report Number HM403699
has been filed with the Chicago Police Department detailing the abuse
and danger to tenants posed by &lt;A
HREF="mailto:djack ... @lakefront.org"&gt;Sr. Case Manager Deon Jackson&lt;/a&gt;

The National Center on Elder Abuse (NCEA) defines these categories of
Elder Abuse:

Emotional or Psychological Abuse

Emotional or psychological abuse is defined as the infliction of
anguish,
pain, or distress through verbal or nonverbal acts.
Emotional/psychological abuse includes but is not limited to verbal
assaults, insults, threats, intimidation, humiliation, and harassment.
In
addition, treating an older person like an infant; isolating an
elderly
person from his/her family, friends, or regular activities; giving an
older person the "silent treatment;" and enforced social isolation are
examples of emotional/psychological abuse.

Signs and symptoms of emotional/psychological abuse include but are
not
limited to:

* being emotionally upset or agitated;

* being extremely withdrawn and non communicative or non responsive;

* unusual behavior usually attributed to dementia (e.g., sucking,
biting,
* rocking); and

* an elder's report of being verbally or emotionally mistreated.

* Emotional or Psychological Abuse is a specialty of
&lt;AHREF="mailto:djack ... @lakefront.org"&gt;Sr. Case Manager Deon Jackson&lt;/
a&gt; and has gone on far too long.  When the CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT
has to be called on for intervention to PREVENT ADDITIONAL ABUSE AND
THE POTENTIAL FOR PHYSICAL VIOLENCE WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM.

Elder Abuse and Accused Rapist Deon Jackson is also fond of Neglect

Neglect is defined as the refusal or failure to fulfill any part of a
person's obligations or duties to an elder. Neglect may also include
failure of a person who has fiduciary responsibilities to provide care
for
an elder (e.g., pay for necessary home care services) or the failure
on
the part of an in-home service provider to provide necessary care.

Neglect typically means the refusal or failure to provide an elderly
person with such life necessities as food, water, clothing, shelter,
personal hygiene, medicine, comfort, personal safety, and other
essentials
included in an implied or agreed-upon responsibility to an elder.

The "Banning" of individuals from the lounge areas, and the
Employment, Training and Education Center (that works in cooperation
with &lt;a href=" http://www.depaul.edu/ "&gt;De Paul University&lt;/a&gt; School of
Education constitutes not only neglect but also puts the managers of
the facility in question in violation of the Federal Equal Access Act
and Legal Action is forthcoming.

This is &lt;a href=" http://mercyhousing.org/ "&gt;Mercy Housing&lt;/a&gt;?

It's a real pity that the illiterate criminals that run this place
cannot even obey the laws of the land, but after 55 years on this
earth, this is ONE ROMAN CATHOLIC AMERICAN PATRIOT that is NOT GOING
TO TOLERATE THESE IGNORANT AND THUGGISH GANGSTERS!

This is http://mercyhousing.org/?

To add to the violations, personnel of Lakefront's ETE Center, "Sr.
Case Manager Deon Jackson", and another part-time employee of ETE,
Black Muslim Terrorist Agnin Mumin continue to conspire to deny this
tenant his basic civil rights and use threats of violence and coercion
in order to continue their abuse.

Lakefront Mercy SRO Housing continues to violate the laws and abuse
the basic rights of residents like this one but is glad to continue to
accept funds from a government whose laws they do not wish to obey.

The writer humbly requests a full investigation of these heinous
abuses pursuant to:

US CODE: Title 42,SUBCHAPTER V-FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAMS
TITLE 42 &gt; CHAPTER 21 &gt; SUBCHAPTER V
SUBCHAPTER V-FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAMS
§ 2000d. Prohibition against exclusion from participation in, denial
of

connection with employment, real estate transactions, access to
financial credit, and the availability of public accommodations.

It gets worse:

To Whom It May Concern:

It is the sad duty of this 55 year old Mercy Housing resident to
report Federal Crimes being committed by the refugees from the
prisons, projects and whorehouses that masquerade as "staff" in Mercy
Housing apartment units.  The latest is a  VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW -
INTERFERENCE WITH THE OPERATION OF THE UNITED STATES MAIL: Details
follow.

The writer, a Conservative Roman Catholic scholar and author has been
banned from opening his own mail box to check for any mail for over a
month.  The baboons that run this building aver that said mail can be
handled by the dummies known as 'desk clerks' in order to forbid this
resident from entering a lounge area where the mail boxes are
located.   The rationale behind keeping this American from this area
is to prevent any opposing ideas to be posted and/or written on any
publicly viewable bulletin boards.  After five years of normal
operation, 'management' took this illegal action after a flyer was
amended.  The addition urged  our Muslim residents and Liberals to
"Call 1-900-MOHAMMEDSUX!".  Muslims need phone sex too! (and they've
been forced to lower their price for a blow job to just five bucks -
$2.50 at the mosque)

Though this was used as an excuse the real motivation was to allow
"Management" to post any and all political advertising and forcibly
remove and destroy any opposing views or material.  With five to seven
bulletin boards in Mercy Housing buildings, one would think there is
room for all views, but the Gay Liberals here don't see it that way
and must find a way to silence any opposing views.  This is of
particular importance with an election six weeks away. The Democratic
machine counts on a solid voting block from Mercy Housing residents
and offers assistance with welfare and disability money in return.  A
VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATS IS A VOTE FOR MORE BARBERCUE!!! Sadly this is
achieved by repeatedly violating local, state and now federal laws.

Upon entering this 'prohibited' area on this same date, there was
indeed mail that this American has not received for nearly a month in
the mail box. Two bulletin boards boasted three large flyers for the
UPCOMING ELECTION OF ALDERMAN HELEN SCHILLER AND MAYOR RICHARD J.
DALEY!  Thus, our thuggish and illiterate "Management" was caught WITH
THEIR PANTS DOWN in a blatant attempt to SILENCE ANY OPPOSITION IN
TOTAL VIOLATION OF THE 1st AMENDMENT! (but 'de brudders can doos 'dat
- 'dey was slaves, remember?)

The ignorant anthropoids and crack hos that run there buildings are
accustomed to violating the civil rights of our tenants (Especially if
'dey is White!) but have now VIOLATED FEDERAL LAW!

I. Mercy Housing is VIOLATING FEDERAL LAW BY INTERFERING WITH THE
OPERATION OF THE US MAIL

II. Mercy Housing Declaration of Tenants Rights avers that residents
enjoy the basic right of  5. &gt;COMMUNITY AFFILIATION: to be recognized
by Mercy Housing Lakefront staff as having a voice in residential
community affairs and to be free to organize and participate in
decisions regarding the well-being of the apartment and common areas
Where is the voice in community when all written communication is
rigidly controlled and/or 'banned'?

III. Mercy Housing is also guilty of:

a.) &gt;Violating the Provisions of the US Equal Access Act&lt;/B&gt; by
banning this resident from any internet use with no reason but sheer
vindictiveness and preventing him from getting a job or further
training
b.) &gt;Violating numerous provisions of 775 ILCS 5/ Illinois Human
Rights Act and
c.) &gt;Violations of the  Equal Protection Clauses of the United States
Constitution including Amendment IV (illegal searches continue on a
monthly basis)  and Amendment IX of the Bill of Rights

Over 24 months of attempts to stop this abuse and secure basic rights
for our residents have been totally ignored so we ask that management
of Mercy Lakefront -

a.) Be prohibited from receiving any additional federal, state and
local government funding used for the Mercy Lakefront Employment,
Training and Education Center that continues to violate federal laws
b.) Be forced by law to ensure that all of our elderly residents are
given equal access and respect of their basic rights
c.) Be forced by law to terminate immediately heinous rights abusers
and law breakers like Sr. Case Manager Deon Jackson, as detailed in
Report Number HM403699 filed with the Chicago Police Department,
(former) Property Manager  Shawn Mintz and Property Manager Cynthia
Dean and ensuring that Muslim Terrorists are not given sanctuary and
offered special privileges as in the case of Black Muslim Terrorist
(resident) Agnin Mumin
d.) Be required to ensure the physical safety or our resident by
ensuring an end it put to threat of physical violence and even death
by employees of Mercy Lakefront Housing
e.) Be required to Institute an immediate and thorough audit of the
apartment units and personnel involved in order to determine what
other federal laws have been violated by "Management" that has no
respect at all for the law and investigate the possible transfer of
Federal, State and Local government funds to the Islamic Terrorist
groups who are now represented in other Mercy Lakefront apartment
buildings
f.) Be forced to respect the American Flag and appropriately fined for
violations of the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005
signed by President George W Bush

* Why aren't these Mercy Housing Miscreants ARRESTED AND JAILED FOR
INTERFERING WITH THE OPERATION OF THE UNITED STATES MAIL?
* Why aren't &gt;COWARDLY QUEERS LIKE Failed Basketball Player and
Accused Rapist &lt;A HREF="mailto:DJack ... @lakefront.org"&gt;Deon Jackson&lt;/
a&gt;and &lt;A HREF="mailto:Lfl ... @mercyhousing.org"&gt;Illiterate Thug and
Property Manager Laurence Floyd&lt;/a&gt; under investigation for endemic
law breaking or incarcerated?
* Why is Mercy Lakefront Housing allowed to repeatedly VIOLATE FEDERAL
LAWS AND STILL RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS?

Though this matter was referred to the same Alderman Helen Schiller,
no action has been forthcoming but we can expect crap like that from
the Gay Liberals.

SO WHERE IS THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT?

Concerned Residents of Mercy Housing

It gets even worse than that:

Thursday, July 20, 2006

Dear Friend in Christ,

Police Report HM403699 was filed against Deon Jackson on July 23, 2006
to report his continued Elder Abuse.

The struggle against ghetto gansterism and Islamic Jihad continues at
Mercy Lakefront Housing.

In an attempt to do the right thing and answer a required resident
update, this Devout Roman Catholic of 55 years today met with resident
laughing chimpanzee and &lt;A HREF="mailto:djack ... @lakefront.org"&gt;Sr.
Case Manager Deon Jackson&lt;/a&gt;.  After only a minute this Devout
Catholic was informed of yet another series of 'complaints' from a new
'bathmate' that has replaced Black Muslim Terrorist Agnin Mumin who is
now free to plan more Terrorist attacks using the computer facilities
of http://lakefront.org/.(more to come on this next week)

Suddenly, Jackson, who is only in his late 20's began to scream his
new orders out in a loud and threatening voice. When this 55 year old
Catholic who attends Daily Mass and prays three rosaries a day
politely asked him to show  some respect for his elders and cease
screaming at an older man twice his age he only screamed louder.  This
resident appropriately responded "I cannot hold a conversation with a
screaming and impudent punk!" and left his office.  This scenario has
occurred with Jackson at least three times before and is commonly seen
in his 'conferences' with our elderly, poor and formerly homeless
residents. Now  that this  Devout Roman Catholic is 55 years of Age
BEING SCREAMED AT AND THREATENED BY SOME IMPUDENT PUNK IS NOT JUST
INSULTING IT IS AN OUTRAGE BEFORE GOD HIMSELF!

In an incredible display of boorishness, Jackson even went so far as
to comment to this resident, "You've only been here a few minutes and
you're already stinking up my entire office."  1 Sadly, this sort of
derogatory rhetoric is commonly directed at our residents, and since
Jackson deceptively edged out every other "Case Manager" he seems to
feel that he can treat our residents any way he wants.  The modus
operandi employed is that no one shall report this out of fear of
retribution by this marginally educated and certainly un-Christian
bisexual oaf who uses his screaming and threats to keep poor and
elderly residents in a state of fear.

King Solomon reminded us "He that oppresses the poor, REPROACHES HIS
MAKER." - Proverb 14:31 - why hasn't anyone ever told this Failed
basketball players and excuse for a human being?

WHY IS THIS ABUSIVE AND BLASPHEMOUS INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYED AS A 'SR CASE
MANAGER"?   THIS IS ANATHEMA BEFORE GOD AND MAN!

A new 'grievance' procedure has been suggested in order to handle such
THE ONLY "CASE MANAGER" TO EMPLOYEE ABUSE and MISTREATMENT OF THE POOR
AND ELDERLY RESIDENTS AT MERCY LAKEFRONT SRO&lt;/B&gt; - which suggest that
Residents "Contact your Case Manager" - CONTACT IS &lt;A
HREF="mailto:djack ... @lakefront.org"&gt;Deon Jackson&lt;/a&gt;! - THE SAME
DICTATORIAL DELINQUENT WHO CALLED THIS 55 YEAR OLD RESIDENT A DIRTY
STINKING BASTARD JUST FOUR MONTHS AGO AND NOW SCREAMS AT AND EVEN
THREATENS OLDER MEN TWICE HIS AGE WHILE ISSUING NEW THREATS!  THIS IS
THE 'MERCY" IN MERCY HOUSING?

WHY IS SUCH AN ABUSIVE AND EVEN DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYED BY MERCY
HOUSING AT ALL?

Perhaps Jackass (er, Jackson)  has had time to study the Muslim
Queer'ran with his Gay Lover BLACK MUSLIM TERRORIST Agnin Mumin whom
he continues to protect and learned to:

Qur'ran [3:151]
Cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined
companions with God, for which He had sent no authority: their abode
will be  the Fire: And evil is the home of the wrong-doers!

If you don't like it,then you are threatened with physical violence:

To Whom it May Concern

On this date at around 12:30 PM this resident was PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED
BY &lt;A HREF="mailto:lfl ... @mercyhousing.org"&gt;Property Manager Laurence
Floyd &lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;A HREF="mailto:Djack ... @lakefront.org"&gt;Failed
Basketball Player and Accused Rapist Deon Jackson&lt;/a&gt;! When an attempt
was made by these two GOONS to CONDUCT AN ILLEGAL SEARCH of this
residents unit the DOOR WAS FORCED OPEN and THOUGHT I HAD NO PANTS ON
AND WAS HOLDING THE DOOR THE THUGS EMPLOYED PUSHED THEIR WAY IN!

As this resident resisted this ASSAULT FLOYD STATED "I'll beat the
shit out of you" - the entry was complete and the TWO GOONS WHO HAD
ILLEGALLY FORCED THEIR WAY IN TOOK PICTURES THEY INTEND TO USE TO
EVICT THIS DEVOUT ROMAN CATHOLIC OF 55 YEARS - PHENOMENAL!

Now the DUMB GOONS THAT RUN THIS PLACE USE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE ON OUR
OLDER RESIDENTS!!

MERCY YOU SAY?!?!?

Incredible!  To ameliorate the difficulties presented by Jailbird
Marcus Johnson in #308 and his violent threats which required the
intervention of the Chicago Police on December 19, 2006, "Management"
of this Mercy Lakefront housing unit  decides to INSPECT THE APARTMENT
OF THIS DEVOUT ROMAN CATHOLIC of 55 YEARS!  The dumb part is these
clowns presented a NOTICE DATED December 20, 2006 for an INSPECTION ON
December 21, 206.

Mercy Housing's own policy states:

Tenant Rights

In keeping with Mercy Housing Lakefront's mission, Vision and Values
to create a more humane world where poverty is alleviated, communities
are healthy and all people can develop their potential, you are
encourage as a tenant to exercise the following rights and
responsibilities:

Rights:

1. RESPECT: to be treated by staff and neighbors with consideration
and regard for your inherent dignity as a human being, free from
intimidation, harassment, or violence
2. NONDISCRIMINATION: to fair and impartial treatment by staff
regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, national origin, disability,
religion, sexual orientation, or political affiliation
3. JUSTICE: access to the Grievance/Complaint Process; and prompt
consideration from management to all valid grievances/complaints for
resolution as quickly as possible
4. CONFIDENTIALITY: to discretion and respect for your privacy as long
as it does not interfere with the rights, health and safety of others
5. CCMMUNITY AFFILIATION - when all notices are tightly controlled and
American Flags and Crosses and thrown into the trash can?
6. SAFETY: to safe, decent and sanity living conditions
7. MAINTENANCE: to have unit repairs performed in a timely manner upon
completion of proper work order request forms
8. NOTICE: to be given reasonable notice of any non-emergency
inspection or entry into your apartment

Chicago Municipal Code S-12-050 states "A tenant shall permit
reasonable access to a landlord upon receiving two days notice by
mail, telephone, written:notice or other means designed in good faith
to provide reasonable notice."

A Notice given 24 hours before is NOT TWO DAYS NOTICE so I returned
the notice and told the "Desk Clerk" to tell &lt;A
HREF="mailto:lfl ... @mercyhousing.org"&gt;Property Manager Laurance Floyd
&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;A HREF="mailto:Djack ... @lakefront.org"&gt;Failed Basketball
Player and Accused Rapist Deon Jackson&lt;/a&gt; to SHOVE IT UP THEIR
ARSE!

Another 'notice' was placed in my mailbox at later 4:00 PM on December
20, back-dated to December 19, 2006! Incredible -

Meanwhile, back at the old shared bathroom, Jailbird Marcus Johnson of
"You gonna Die White Honkey Motherf**ker" fame continues to leave the
entire bathroom floor wet daily, creating a serious health hazard to
this older resident. Though it has been reported many times,
"Management" does nothing to stop it.

Black Muslim Terrorist Agnin Mumin has once again been overheard
talking about planting bombs, prompting yet more FBI actions so 2007
ought to be great fun.

AND NOW MANAGEMENT FORCES THEIR WAY IN AND ASSAULTS OUR RESIDENTS!!!

WHERE DOES MERCY HOUSING THEY FIND THESE VIOLENT THUGS?

Since when does MERCY HOUSING approve of DRUG USE and VIOLENCE in
their units?

What are they trying to hide?

Why Are the Sisters of Mercy Muzzling the Truth?

It seems that our MSN Community at &lt;a href=" http://groups.msn.com/
Mercylakefront/"&gt;Mercy Lakefront&lt;/a&gt; has someone very upset.  We can
no longer post anything there at all - why would that happen?

Who could be responsible and why?

The why is easy - a lot of folks in the Mercy Lakefront Housing
Organization do not want the general public to find out about the
continuing civil, human rights and elder abuses and the molly coddling
of Negro criminals, crack whores and Black Muslim Terrorists under the
odious aegis of diversity.  Even more folks at Mercy Housing don't
want people to know JUST HOW MANY FEDERAL LAWS they are VIOLATING
since THIS CAN COST A LOT OF MONEY IN LOST FEDERAL GRANTS and EVEN
MORE IN LOST CONTRIBUTIONS.

Who would want to do something like that and conceal these abuses,
illegality, prostitution and support for Islamofascist Terror groups?

The Poverty pimps and welfare hos we've exposed at http://mercylakefront.blogspot.com/
such as Bi-sexual elder abuser and accused rapist Deon Jackson, bald
headed little bastard Shawn Mintz, illiterate "Property Manager"
Laurence Floyd, Black Muslim Terrorist Agnin Mumin and their toadies
are obvious but no one knows who these punks are at MSN - or is there
something more to this attempt to censor the truth?

The Sisters of Mercy have NEVER ONCE responded to ANY OF OUR LETTERS
and THOUGH A ONE PAGE "TENANTS RIGHTS" document was produced NOTHING
HAS CHANGED AND THEY KNOW IT -

Why is that "Good" Sisters Of Charity?

Our Lord and Savior Taught us to THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE  -

* WHY DO THE SISTERS OF CHARITY WISH TO HIDE IT?

* WHY DO THE SISTER OF MERCY ALLOW JESUS TO BE CAST INTO THE TRASH AND
PROTECT THE PEDOPHILE PIG PROPHET MOHAMMED?

* WHY DO THE SISTERS OF MERCY THROW THE AMERICAN FLAG INTO THE GARBAGE
CAN AND TOLERATE VIOLENT DRUG USERS, CRACK HOS AND ISLAMOFASCIST
TERRORISTS?

I'll tell you boys and girls since THE PARISH I LIVED IN FOR 49 YEARS
and my PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS LIVE IN FOR 98 YEARS THREW ME OUT OF
CHURCH AND ALMOST HAD ME ARRESTED (see http://valleyofdeath.blogspot.com/ )
- SO I SPEAK THE TRUTH -  WHEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SEES THEIR MONETARY
INTERESTS THREATENED THEY CAN GET VERY Un-CHRISTIAN - and in THIS CASE
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON. 1

The other reason is that many of the ignorant libs running these
places actually IDENTIFY WITH AND SUPPORT THE ISLAMOFASCISTS - (in the
same fashion that they supported the Commies like Castro and Che
Guevera), despise American ideals and HATE GEORGE W BUSH MORE THAN
THEY LOVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!
It's really sick but they see the MUSLIM TERRORIST as the HERO and SEE
AMERICANS AND CHRISTIANS AS THE ENEMY! (this is why Crosses, Jesus and
flags are torn down and cast into the trash and Christmas is held with
PRAYERS FORBIDDEN)

I can't speak for the Sisters of Mercy but I can tell you about the
VINCENTIAN FATHERS AT DE PAUL UNIVERSITY THAT SUPPORT AND EVEN TEACH
THE GLOBAL JIHAD!!!

My two great aunts, Sisters Adonella (SSF) and Sr. Clodicinda (Poor
Handmaid of Mary) clued me in when I was very young - A LOT OF
'RELIGIOUS' ARE NOT QUITE WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE.

If there are some logical explanations for these continuing abuses,
legal violations and physical dangers why not just respond and explain
them?

ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING SISTERS?

* Yes they are and it's Defrauding the United States, State and Local
governments.
* Yes they are and it's Embezzlement of United States, State and Local
funds.
* Yes they are and it's conspiracy and support for Islamofascist
Terror.

We'll contact MSN Groups and see if this can be reversed but it this
CENSORSHIP CONTINUES that's ok too - we'll JUST START MERCYLAKEFRONT
GROUPS at YAHOO and GOOGLE TOO! (and when they block those, we'll
start MERCYHOUSING groups, etc, etc, etc)

I've fully documented a long string of abuses at Mercy Lakefront SRO
Housing and have been doing so since their ignominious defeat in Court
on November 16, 2005 when a jury found against Lakefront SRO and for
George M Weinert V in an abusive and fraudulent two year long attempt
at 'eviction'.

1.) Elder  Abuse has reached a critical stage with death threats and
continuing violent actions, coupled with profanity laden fulminations
by the latest abusive gansta, Mr. Marcus Johnson. "Management" appears
to feel that this is permissible and though advised many times the
danger  remains requiring Chicago Police Report #HM716423 on 10/12/06
and Report #HM749946 on December 2, 2006  1

2.) Concurrent with this abuse the denial of services continue,
leaving this 55 year old peaceful Man of God penniless and without
anyone to turn to for help in securing training and employment.  This
is exactly what "Management" at this facility wants.   In addition to
denial of communication facilities, (Phone, fax and internet that are
a part of this "Employment, Training and Education Center" that ALL
OTHER MERCY LAKEFRONT RESIDENTS are allowed to use), all
transportation assistance (also a part of this center as well as this
Mercy Lakefront facility and crucial this 55 year old man with a gun
shot wound  in his left let that creates great pain when walking any
long distance) and all counseling (which is impossible since this
resident is Illegally ":Banned" from this Center and the only option
is abusive "Sr. Case Manager" Deon Jackson who screams at our
residents and has called this Conservative Catholic a "Dirty Stinking
Bastard" an concerted attempt has been made to totally ostracize and
isolate this scholar with the effect of creating great pain from
walking daily and frequent spells of depression since there has seen
no way out.  2

3.) Despite a two year logs abusive and illegal attempt at "Eviction"
of this Quiet (and WHITE) Resident that ended on November 16, 2005
when A Jury found Against Lakefront SRO and for George M Weinert V and
ordered all harassment ended, the silly cause of the action (a $47.00
'debt' that never existed) remained on my rent statement for an
additional four months, requiring Mr. Andrew Dougherty of Cabrini
Legal Services to file a COURT ACTION DEMANDING COMPLIANCE WITH THE
ORDER.  Though that action ended, the ILLEGAL SEARCHES and THUGGISH
STYLE of new "Property Manager" Laurence Floyd continue to threatened
this elderly resident with EVICTION based on the results of  ILLEGAL
SEARCHES THAT NEVER EVEN OCCURRED so the continuing threats of
homelessness which effect the serenity and mental health of this
bookish man of God continue.  3   Though these illegal "Inspections"
require at least 48 hours notice, two have been attempted with NO
NOTICE AT ALL on 10/19/02 and 11/16/06 - on both days ENTRANCE WAS
DENIED since NOTICE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN and the response of
"Management" was to provide a notice indicating that this unit
resident FAILED TWO "INSPECTIONS" THAT NEVER EVEN TOOK PLACE!  Since
"Property Manager" Laurence Floyd Threatened to "Start Evictions" of
anyone who failed THREE of these ILLEGAL SEARCHES this is yet another
ATTEMPT AT COERCION that is ELDER ABUSE.

This pattern of abuse began in 2003 and I was powerless to do
anything.  I turned 55 on June 15, 2006 and though I have made a
dedicated attempt to get into the Senior Community Service and
Employment Program, along with the Maryor's Workforce Investment Act
Program to secure funds for Paralegal Training to enter a booming
field I have been stymied at every turn by "Management".  Since said
"Management' CANNOT EVEN SPELL AT A FOURTH GRADE LEVEL and the only
'professional" in this unit is Gay Abuser Deon Jackson (a failed
basketball player with a Bachelors in Physical Education) the fact
that I HOLD A MASTERS DEGREE IN MUSIC COMPOSITION AND HALF OF ANOTHER
IN COMPUTER SCIENCE had been met ONLY WITH JEALOUSLY AND HOSTILITY
that has LED TO THIS CONTINUING ABUSE.

The presence of bi-sexual abusive "Sr. Case Manager" Mr. Deon Jackson
(who is still here and intimidating our elderly residents by screaming
at them &lt;he is also  known to have slapped some&gt; and using his 6"5"
stature to terrorize), illiterate "Propety Manager" Laurence Floyd,
bald headed little bastard and former "Property Manager" Shawn Mintz
(who initiated the action and has been "moved" to another "Management"
Position as a result) and Black Muslim Terrorist Agnin Mumin (who was
sad that the 'blessed event" in Joliet has been foiled but promises
'More for 'dem White Honky mudderf**kers") continue.  The real
physical dangers presented to this 55 year old Devout Roman Catholic
and other older residents has been fully documented at
http://mercylakefront.blogspot.com/ and is available for your
inspection.

Is there a connection with the Palestinian Islamofascist Terror Groups
that have infested Chicago's De Paul University?  Yes there may be.
The Employment, Training and Education Center of Mercy Lakefront works
closely with the De Paul University School of Education that provides
tutors and other resources.  Many of those personnel are Terrorist
sympathizers if not sleeper Islamic Terrorists who have ties to
Radical Student Organizations based at De Paul University like the
United Muslims Moving Ahead at http://condor.depaul.edu/~umma/ who are
connected with the Muslim Students Association who are connected with
HAMAS!   Their presence at Mercy Lakefront allows them to operate
under the guise of "Charity", secure access to large government
grants, portions of which in turn can then be channeled to groups like
the Muslim Student Association (Via the De Paul students and grads)
and then funneled to HAMAS TO SUPPORT PLANNED ISLAMIC TERRORIST
OPERATIONS in CHICAGO! Chicago's Islamofascists are masters at this
sort of thing as we learned with the Holy Land Foundation and
KindHearts who are both on trial at the Dirksen Federal Building now
for Terror Financing.  We've just begun to make these connections and
experts at the Anti-Terrorism Coalition, Anti-Terrorism Blog and
Homeland Security are also involved so look for a lot more on this
ISLAMOFASCIST TERROR FINANCING At Mercy Lakefront SRO in the coming
year.

There's a lot more at http://mercylakefront.blogspot.com/ since I've
been writing about this since February of this year.  All abuses are
also at (the now muffled) http://groups.msn.com/group/mercylakefront/
and Mr. Andrew Dougherty of Cabrini Legal has copies as well if legal
action becomes necessary.  I've also sent copies of all these notices
to &lt;A HREF="mailto:mlov ... @mercyhousing.org "&gt;Mary Lovett&lt;/a&gt;

Lakefront appears to be more interested in protecting the abusers,
criminals and Islamofascist Terrorists since nothing has improved and
in fact things seem to be getting even worse with real physical
dangers that require the frequent intervention of the Chicago Police
and the new attempt to just shut us all up.  (threats of physical
violence will be next and perhaps assaults)

WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF MERCY HOUSING (perhaps the law that the
refugees from the projects, penitentiaries and whorehouses that work
in these units are so good at breaking)?

It's sad that Mercy Lakefront SRO is so dishonest and cowardly that
they must resort to thuggish censorship and threats but of no import.

It's time for the United States Justice Department, the Internal
Revenue Service, the Civil Rights Commission and serious legal action.

When election time rolls around, the politicos are all over Mercy
Lakefront units, looking for votes and support.  Where are our
representatives when not just our rights, but often our physical
safety is in danger?

·      Where is the "Mercy" in Mercy Housing?
·      Where is the Cook County States Attorney?
·      Where is the Roman Catholic Church?

THEY ARE AT THE GAY BAR WITH ALDERMAN TOM TUNNEY AND THE LIBERAL
QUEERS!!!

There's a lot more at the Mercy Lakefront Blog and, though we've been
exposing these abuses for over a year, they continue and are in fact
only getting worse.  Where the hell is the government?

If you're an attorney or legal assistant please contact me - I'm going
to need a lot of help and know that I'll get none from the Sisters or
Mercy - they're too busy protecting Islamofascist Killers from Hamas.

Though I'll have to walk five miles to get there and this will be very
painful I'm going back to Franciscan Outreach at Paulina and Lemoyne
since they are the only ones who can really be counted on to do the
work of Christ! (What does that say about the "good" Sisters of
Mercy?)

Our Lord and Savoir had words for hypocrites like the "Management" or
Mercy Lakefront Housing:

Matthew 23:1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,
7 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You lock the
kingdom of
heaven 8 before human beings. You do not enter yourselves, nor do you
allow
entrance to those trying to enter.
14
15
10 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You traverse
sea and land
to make one convert, and when that happens you make him a child of
Gehenna twice
as much as yourselves.
16
11 "Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If one swears by the temple,
it means
nothing, but if one swears by the gold of the temple, one is
obligated.'
17
Blind fools, which is greater, the gold, or the temple that made the
gold
sacred?
18
And you say, 'If one swears by the altar, it means nothing, but if one
swears by
the gift on the altar, one is obligated.'
19
You blind ones, which is greater, the gift, or the altar that makes
the gift
sacred?
20
One who swears by the altar swears by it and all that is upon it;
21
one who swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in
it;
22
one who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who is
seated on
it.
23
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You pay tithes 12
of mint
and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier things of the
law:
judgment and mercy and fidelity. (But) these you should have done,
without
neglecting the others.
24
13 Blind guides, who strain out the gnat and swallow the camel!
25
14 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You cleanse the
outside
of cup and dish, but inside they are full of plunder and self-
indulgence.
26
Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup, so that the
outside also
may be clean.
27
15 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You are like
whitewashed
tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of
dead men's
bones and every kind of filth.
28
Even so, on the outside you appear righteous, but inside you are
filled with
hypocrisy and evildoing.
29
16 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, 17 you hypocrites. You build
the tombs of
the prophets and adorn the memorials of the righteous,
30
and you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would
not have
joined them in shedding the prophets' blood.'
31
Thus you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of
those who
murdered the prophets;
32
now fill up what your ancestors measured out!
33
You serpents, you brood of vipers, how can you flee from the judgment
of
Gehenna?
