Subject: THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD
Title: THE NEW WORLD ORDER FILES
Author: David Allen Rivera

No other name has become more synonymous with the Illuminati than the
Rothschilds. It is believed that the Rothschild family used the
Illuminati as a means to achieving their goal of world-wide dominance.
Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812)/ /was born in Frankfurt-on-the-Main
in Germany, the son of Moses Amschel Bauer, a banker and goldsmith.
Their name was derived from the 'red shield' ('rotschildt') that hung
over the door of their shop, and had been the emblem of revolutionary
Jews in Eastern Europe. A few years after his father's death, he worked
as a clerk in a Hanover bank, which was owned by the Oppenheimers. He
became a junior partner, and soon left to take over the business started
by his father in 1750. He bought and sold rare coins, and later
succeeded in buying out several other coin dealers. In 1769, he became a
court agent for Prince William IX of Hesse-Kassel, who was the grandson
of George II of England, a cousin to George III, a nephew of the King of
Denmark, and a brother- in-law to the King of Sweden. Soon Rothschild
became the middleman for big Frankfurt bankers like the Bethmann
Brothers, and Rueppell &amp; Harnier. After expanding his business to
antiques, wineries, and the importing of manufactured materials from
England, the Rothschild family began to amass a sizable fortune.

Prince William inherited his father's fortune upon his death in 1785,
which was the largest private fortune in Europe. Some of this money had
come from Great Britain paying for the use of 16,800 Hessian soldiers to
stop the revolution in America, because the money was never given to the
troops. In 1804, the Rothschilds secretly made loans to the Denmark
government, on behalf of Prince William.

In June, 1806, when Napoleon's troops pushed their way into Germany,
Prince William fled to Denmark, leaving his money with Mayer Rothschild.
History tells us that Rothschild secretly buried William's ledgers,
which revealed the full extent of his wealth, a list of debtors and the
interest required from them, and 600,000 pounds ($3,000,000), to keep
Napoleon from confiscating it. Buderus von Carlhausen ( Carl Buderus),
the Treasury official who handled William's finances, was given 'power
of attorney,' and he in turn made Rothschild his chief banker,
responsible for collecting the interest on the royal loans. Napoleon
announced that all debts being paid to Prince William, were to go to the
French Treasury, and offered a 25% commission on any debts that he would
collect. Rothschild refused.

Developing circumstances soon allowed the Rothschilds to formulate a
plan which would guarantee them the financial control of Europe, and
soon the world. It began with taking advantage of the outcome of the
Battle of Waterloo, which was fought at La-Belle-Alliance, seven miles
south of Waterloo, which is a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. Early in the
battle, Napoleon appeared to be winning, and the first secret military
report to London communicated that fact. However, upon reinforcements
from the Prussians, under Gebhard Blucher, the tide turned in favor of
Wellington. On Sunday, June 18, 1815, Rothworth, a courier of Nathan
Rothschild, head of the London branch of the family, was on the
battlefield, and upon seeing that Napoleon was being beaten, went by
horse to Brussels, then to Ostende, and for 2,000 francs, got a sailor
to get him to England across stormy seas. When Nathan Rothschild
received the news on June 20, he informed the government, who did not
believe him. So, with everyone believing Wellington to be defeated,
Rothschild immediately began to sell all of his stock on the English
Stock Market. Everyone else followed his lead, and also began selling,
causing stocks to plummet to practically nothing. At the last minute,
his agents secretly began buying up the stocks at rock-bottom prices. On
June 21, at 11 PM, Wellington's envoy, Major Henry Percy showed up at
the War Office with his report that Napoleon had been crushed in a
bitter eight hour battle, losing a third of his men. This gave the
Rothschild family complete control of the British economy, and forced
England to set up a new Bank of England, which Nathan Rothschild
controlled.

However, that wasn't the only angle he used to profit from the Battle
of Waterloo. Mayer Amschel Rothschild sent some of William's money to
his son Nathan in London, and according to the _Jewish Encyclopedia_:
&quot;Nathan invested it in 800,000 pounds of gold from the East India
Company, knowing it would be needed for Wellington's peninsula campaign.
He made no less than four profits: (1) on the sale of Wellington's paper
(which he bought at 50Â¢ on the dollar); (2) on the sale of gold to
Wellington; (3) on its repurchase; and (4) on forwarding it to Portugal.
This was the beginning of the great fortune.&quot;

After Napoleon's defeat, Prince William returned to resume his rule.
Buderus was made a Baron, and the Rothschilds were the richest bankers
in Europe.

In 1817, France, in order to get back on their feet again, secured
loans from a French banking house in Ouvrard, and from the Baring
Brothers in London. The Rothschilds saw their chance to get a firm grip
on the French economy, and on October, 1818, Rothschild agents began
buying huge amounts of French government bonds, which caused their value
to increase. On November 5th, they were dumped on the open market,
creating a financial panic as their value declined. Thus, the
Rothschilds gained control of France.

Mayer Rothschild had established banks in England, France, and Germany.
His sons, who were made Barons of the Austrian Empire, were set up to
continue and expand his banking empire. Amschel Mayer Rothschild
(1773-1855, who in 1838 said: &quot;Permit me to issue and control the money
of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws.&quot;) was in charge of the
bank in Frankfurt, Germany, which was known as M. A. Rothschild and Sons
(which closed in 1901, after the deaths of Mayer Karl and his brother,
Wilhelm Karl- the sons of Karl Mayer Rothschild). Salomon Mayer
Rothschild (1774-1855) was the head of the bank in Vienna, Austria,
known as S. M. Rothschild and Sons (which was closed during World War II
after the Nazi occupation). Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777-1836, who once
said: &quot;I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to
rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls
Britain's money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the
British money supply.&quot;) was the head of the bank in London, England,
which was known as N. M. Rothschild and Sons (and has occupied the same
premises since 1809, at 2 New Court, St. Swithin's Lane in London, near
the Bank of England and Stock Exchange). Karl Mayer Rothschild
(1788-1868 ) was the head of the bank in Naples, Italy (closed in 1861).
James Mayer Rothschild (1792-1868) was in charge of the bank in Paris,
France, which was known as Messieurs de Rothschild Freres (whose name
was changed to La Banque Rothschild in 1967).

This was the beginning of the House of Rothschild, which controlled a
fortune estimated to be well over $300,000,000. Soon the Rothschilds
spanned Europe with railroads, invested in coal and ironworks, financed
England's purchase of the Suez Canal, paid for oil exploration in Russia
and the Sahara Desert, financed the czars of Russia, supported Cecil
Rhodes' diamond operations, aided France in creating an empire in
Africa, financed the Hapsburg monarchs, and saved the Vatican from
bankruptcy. In this country, through their American and European agents,
they helped finance Rockefeller's Standard Oil, Carnegie Steel, and
Harriman's Railroad. Werner Sombart, in his book _The Jews and Modern
Capitalism_, said that from 1820 on, it was the &quot;age of the Rothschild&quot;
and concluded that there was &quot;only one power in Europe, and that is
Rothschild.&quot; In 1913, the family fortune was estimated to be over two
billion dollars.

After Mayer Rothschild died on September 19, 1812, his will spelled out
specific guidelines that were to be maintained by his descendants:

1) All important posts were to be held by only family members, and only
male members were to be involved on the business end. The oldest son of
the oldest son was to be the head of the family, unless otherwise agreed
upon by the rest of the family, as was the case in 1812, when Nathan was
appointed as the patriarch.

2) The family was to intermarry with their own first and second
cousins, so their fortune could be kept in the family, and to maintain
the appearance of a united financial empire. For example, his son James
(Jacob) Mayer married the daughter of another son, Salomon Mayer. This
rule became less important in later generations as they refocused family
goals and married into other fortunes.

3) Rothschild ordered that there was never to be &quot;any public inventory
made by the courts, or otherwise, of my estate...Also I forbid any legal
action and any publication of the value of the inheritance.&quot;

American and British Intelligence have documented evidence that the
House of Rothschild, and other International Bankers, have financed both
sides of every war, since the American Revolution. Financier Haym
Salomon, who supported the patriots during the American Revolution, then
later made loans to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and James Monroe,
was a Rothschild agent. As explained earlier, during the Napoleonic
Wars, one branch of the family funded Napoleon, while another financed
Great Britain, Germany, and other nations. Their boldest maneuver came
prior to the Civil War.

The Rothschilds operate out of an area in the heart of London, England,
the financial district, which is known as 'The City', or the 'Square
Mile.' All major British banks have their main offices here, along with
branch offices for 385 foreign banks, including 70 from the United
States. It is here that you will find the Bank of England, the Stock
Exchange, Lloyd's of London, the Baltic Exchange (shipping contracts),
Fleet Street (home of publishing and newspaper interests), the London
Commodity Exchange (to trade coffee, rubber, sugar and wool), and the
London Metal Exchange. It is virtually the financial hub of the world.

Positioned on the north bank of the Thames River, covering an area of
677 acres or one square mile (known as the &quot;wealthiest square mile on
earth&quot;), it has enjoyed special rights and privileges that enabled them
to achieve a certain level of independence since 1191. In 1215, its
citizens received a Charter from King John, granting them the right to
annually elect a mayor (known as the Lord Mayor), a tradition that
continues today.

Both E. C. Knuth, in his book _Empire of the City_, and Des Griffin, in
his book _Descent into Slavery_, stated their belief that 'The City' is
actually a sovereign state (much like the Vatican), and that since the
establishment of the privately owned Bank of England in 1694, 'The City'
has actually become the last word in the country's national affairs,
with Prime Minister, Cabinet, and Parliament becoming only a front for
the real power. According to Knuth, when the queen enters 'The City,'
she is subservient to the Lord Mayor (under him, is a committee of 12-14
men, known as 'The Crown'), because this privately-owned corporation is
not subject to the Queen, or the Parliament.

There seems to be little doubt that the Rothschilds continue to
influence the world economy, and it is known that they are squarely
behind the movement to unite all the western European nations into a
single political entity, which is just another step towards one-world
government.
