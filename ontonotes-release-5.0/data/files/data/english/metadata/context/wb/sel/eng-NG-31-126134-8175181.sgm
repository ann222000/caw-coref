I'd just like to mention that a rapper starting to numerate
albums is a clear sign that he's ran out of ideas. Solaar
did it already with &quot;Cinquième As&quot; which was sort of
clever, but &quot;Capitre 7&quot;? Come on now Claude, you can
do better.

Let's face it. Those who listen to him now wouldn't be able to name all the
previous ones, so giving them numbers is kinda smart nevertheless...

Is it me or has he pretty much become irrelevant in French hip-hop?

The issue of 'relevancy' within a scene is an interesting
one. An artist turning 'irrelevant' could also be a sign of
an him/her putting out higher quality material in relation
to his peers. Or it could mean he's gone pop. Or is stuck
in his ancient ways. Or simply too old for today's audience.
Or does simply not give a fuck about acceptance within
the hip-hop mainstream.

I realize Solaar has somewhat become irrelevant in
French rap with ca. his 3rd album. The reasons elude
me, but in his case I used to think it was a good sign.
But an album title like &quot;Chapitre 7&quot; reeks of redundancy.

As I remember it, most rap heads in France back in those days used to
consider that Solaar went for a more poetic/soft style, both in lyrics
and beats, after his 2nd album; that orientation pretty much separated
him from what the rest of the french hip-hop sounded at the time,
hence causing the &quot;irrelevancy&quot; mentioned above. I guess of all the
reasons you listed above, I'd have to assimilate Solaar's fall from
grace to &quot;going pop&quot;.

It's interesting to note that the same phenomenon doesn't seem to take
place on the US scene (disclaimer: I'm not american so I probably
don't have the slightest fucking idea what I'm talking about here):
artists that are more &quot;soft&quot; don't seem to get denigrated in the same
manner; Common for instance comes to mind. Then again, the average
French hip-hop head tends to strongly dislike RnB, which is not the
average stance in the US, so that might explain it.

Going pop in regards to his music or because he happened
to reach a larger audience with every new album?

As I recall, Solaar always leaned toward a cooler and softer
form of hip-hop expression, to the point where he almost
seemed to typify a French approach to hip-hop the rest of
the world took a liking to. He even had distinctly funny or
romantic songs that everybody realized were pop tunes -
&quot;Bouge de là,&quot; &quot;Caroline&quot;...

Obviously next to NTM or AMER a Solaar (unless he would
have become some underground phenomenon) would have
always been 'pop'. But in an intelligent way, not on some
simplistic Benny B ish. For some time (before I stopped caring
about every damn rap record being put out) I really respected
him for trying to find his own way in terms of sound and
songwriting, even though every album after &quot;Qui Sème...&quot;
and &quot;Prose Combat&quot; was underwhelming to me.

I think post &quot;Resurrection&quot;-Common found himself a whole
new audience. And even &quot;Ressurection&quot;-Common is a pretty
mellow dude. As I remember, going 'soft' was definitely a
potential stigma for US rappers back in uh, late 80s/early
90s. Nowadays, with 'urban' music being such a melting
pot, it seems they get away with it pretty easy, see 50,
see TI.

Interesting. I was under the impression the international
urban market mafia had long convinced everybody that
if you like rap you must like R&amp;B.

I'd say with regards to his music itself, but as you point out it's
always sorta been on the softer side anyway, and one didn't have to
wait for the 3rd or 4th albums to realize that. I think the most
simply stated opinion about Solaar's music back when he released his 2
or first albums was that &quot;it's not rap&quot;, plain as that, just by
comparison to what the rest of french hip-hop sounded like.

We're gonna be forced to consider that a typical case of &quot;french
resistance&quot;, then ;)

Really, people went that far? Early scenes can be
dogmatic like that.

Of which there wasn't an awful lot. To me they were all
different from each other. Assassin. IAM. NTM. Solaar.
The people on &quot;Rapattitude.&quot; Lionel D/Dee Nasty.

Ever heard the Saliha album? Now that was pop. (I still
liked it a lot, though.)

I'd say the mellow element was always there in album-era
French rap, maybe even because of Solaar to a certain
degree. It's not like everybody went the complete hardcore
route as the British did at the time. Sages Po, Soon-E,
Ménélik, Doc Gynéco, they were all on the mellow side
musically. Some of it undoubtedly due to the American
influence (jazz rap, ATCQ, g funk, etc.).

never heard it, I'll try to see if I can get my hands on it; but it's
pop'ish or R&amp;B'ish, I doubt I'll appreciate it much...

well, Doc Gyneco and Menelik have always been pure shite to me. I used
to dig Sages Po a lot, though, and Dany Dan and Zoxea kept at it after
the group was done with, which I appreciated too.
