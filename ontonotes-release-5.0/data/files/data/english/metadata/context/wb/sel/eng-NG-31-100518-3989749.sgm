Used Jaguar Engines - Huge Liquidation Sale
We're in the process of clearing out our salvage parts warehouse, but
it's too much work! This isn't a gimmick - we are starting construction
on a new project and must move all of our used parts out of the way.
We'd rather slash our prices and sell the parts at a huge discount than
have to move them. We save time, you save money, and everyone wins!
Over 60 Used Jaguar Engines on the Shelf, Ready to Go!

Over 60 Jaguar Engines On The Shelf, Ready To Go
We've been selling Jaguar parts for over 30 years and have a huge 4+
acre used parts facility. Our warehouse houses over 60 Jaguar engines,
and we don't want to move them! These '88-'97, 3.6 and 4.0, 6 cylinder
Jaguar engines are on the shelf and ready to go. They're all priced at
$399 - the best deal we've ever offered or ever seen on a Jaguar
engine!

Huge Savings on an Unbeatable Deal
These engines normally sell for $1,200 to $1,500, but they are
available to you for a limited time at only $399! That's over $800 off
the normal selling price - a 200% discount! What could you do with an
extra $800? We do not want to move these engines. Take advantage of
this special deal and help us out - buy your Jaguar engine today for

One of Jaguar's Best Engines Ever
These '88-'97 3.6 and 4.0 6 cylinder Jaguar engines are some of the
best engines ever made by Jaguar. They are normally aspirated (not
supercharged) with dual overhead cams, and they are very smooth. These
engines are some of the most durable you can find.

A person wanting to do a Swap would probably want to de-lucasize these
engins. It's possible you could use a Clifford aftermarket FI kit and
the existing injectors, air header and fuel rails, but you might need a
different sensor for cam and crank position. Does the XJ40 distributor
have centrifugal or vac advance or is this aan electronic function?

Is the bolt pattern in common with the XJ/XKE (old 3.8/4.2) six, the
V12, or anything else?

Jaguars could offer a Kit to make it less trouble to put one of these
in earlier Jaguars, than it is to fit a 350 Chevy.
