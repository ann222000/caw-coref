Why does everything have to include a supervillain team?  Why do
hero weddings also have to involve combats?  (Oh, for the
Terry/Donna Troy wedding in Teen Titans, many years ago.) Why do
special-event books always have way too many costumes?  Suitable
only for those whose tastes incline towards the above.

You forgot:

Why does it have to lead to a different series? What about *concluding*
the story in the one-shot?

For a wedding issue I am willing to give this one point a pass.
Weddings are by definition about beginnings.  Not that I have
any intention whatever of buying the series, mind you.

No, that's the *wedding* itself, another special.

This one leads into a JLA arc...

I wonder whether, if a story is both begun and ended in a one-shot,
readers are as inclined to consider it &quot;canon.&quot;

I don't care about the status of the story, as long as it's *good*. This
was more or less a setup for a JLA arc, and a *bad* one in most
respects, too.

What I don't like is the trend of *ending* miniseries, one-shots and
arcs on a cliff-hanger with no proper conclusion to the story. The
&quot;Outsiders&quot; one-shots worked, they had one &quot;case&quot; in each, with a coda
leading into the main title. This one-shot was *all* setup, heroes
gathering in one place, villains in another, getting ready for a battle,
and then it *ends*.

There's also the complication that this story continuing in JLA until
december, while the Wedding itself coming now.

Pudde.
