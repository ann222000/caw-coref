The whole season Reyes was playing grab ass and not being a professional
ballplayer. Maybe if he payed more attention to the game and was acted like
a professional he wouldnt be batting like crap. I never saw the greats of
the game acting like he does. Very unprofessional!

Cortez is right.  Reyes has a swagger.  I don't think he cares if the
Mets win or lose.  He's all about himself and the number of bases he
can steal.  If the Mets had more team players, they wouldn't be in
this situation.

You think lack of team play is the problem with the bullpen???? (I think
it's the humidity).

The problem is that whatever &quot;Cortez&quot; says is, by definition, wrong,
even when he says the day between Tuesday and Thursday is Wednesday. In
addition, &quot;Cortez&quot; never says anything that is accurate or true by
intention. He's a troll making an inflammatory statement that you just
happen, on this occasion, to agree with. This is rare, because he's got
a brain the size of a lima bean.

As for Reyes, yes, he's a little showy and demonstrative, but he's also
from a culture that seems to tend to wear their hearts on their
sleeves, and is very young. Add to that the fact that most of the team
and the broadcasters admit that his success is tied directly into that
of the team. Back when they were saying these things about Piazza or
Beltran, this was known as &quot;carrying the team&quot;. It's also a lot of
stress.

After a several-weeks-long slump that Reyes may be slowly emerging
from, at a time when you're universally thought to be carrying the
team, or shouldering a large part of that burden, how could he react
any differently to a little success?

The charge of being all about himself and stealing bases (which, note,
is impossible when you can't get on base) is very much undeserved.

&quot;Cortez&quot; is just picking on Reyes because Milledge didn't play tonight.

Oh yeah let's blame it on a guy batting .300 stealing 75 bases, scoring
100 runs, and having fun.  It's all his fault.

When he's hitting it's called youthful enthusiasm. He has to learn when and
how to celebrate without taking away his energy for *playing* the game.

Well then, he'd be my favorite player on the team and I'd probably
blame all remaining losses on Green &amp; LoDuca!
