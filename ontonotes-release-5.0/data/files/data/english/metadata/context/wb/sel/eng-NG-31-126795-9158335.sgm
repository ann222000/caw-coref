Dear Mr. Panda:

Thanks for your valuable time and answering our readers queries.

I have a habit of asking directly to the people's involved, instead of
searching hear and there and get a twisted version.

Hope, you are fine with this attitude.

I  have faith in Indian Law and all the best.

Thanks again
Manoj Padhi

Dear Readers:

Please find a limited version (since the case is subjudice)  from Shri
B.J.Panda.

Hope, this clarifies any rumour(s), you might have been heard.

Thanks
Manoj Padhi

Dear Manoj Babu,

Since the matter is sub-judice, I can
only comment on limited aspects.  This matter relates to 2003 and is being
raked up by people with certain vested interests.  Imfa's sister concern
ICCL's mining lease was delayed for several years due to political
interference, but was finally granted by an order of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in 1999.  ICCL, which had been running in losses, then resumed regular
payments to all lenders.  In 2003, after several years of regular payments,
ICCL entered into a corporate debt restructuring (CDR) scheme (as per RBI
guidelines).

The loan itself was around 200 odd crores and was not waived.  However,
there were waivers of penal interest, liquidated damages, etc.  This did not
involve either the state or the central governments at all.  Such schemes
have been availed by hundreds of companies all over the country, including
many well known national names (eg. Jindals, Essar, IG Petrochem) and also
many companies in Orissa (eg Eastern Media- Sambad, Facor).

Besides debt restructuring, the scheme involved sacrifice of large portion
of shareholding in the company.  Further, the CDR scheme also imposed a
merger of the company with Imfa (which did NOT have accumulated losses).
This scheme was sanctioned by an order of the Hon'ble High Court, which
dismissed identical allegations by another party only a few weeks ago.
Subsequently, some parties have tried to imply motives which simply do not
arise.

I am sure all your questions will be satisfactorily answered when the
present matter in the Hon'ble High Court gets heard.  I cannot say more at
this stage, perhaps after the matter has been completed in court.

With regards,

Baijayant Panda

Dear All,

Going by a News Item from ETV-Oriya,  7.00 PM, 4th October,2007,  various
Financial Institutions viz. IDBI, IFCI, ICICI and PSU Banks like IOB, Canara
Bank, PNB, etc have announced  to waive  a major part of the Loans provided
to IMFA/ICCL,  during the Nineties and that the total amount to be waived
works out to approximately Rupees 2300 Crores!

Whilst the background of such a massive Waiver  is not clear, it appears
very strange as to how the Banks and FIs could waive such a big amount for a
large Industrial House.

Some critics opine that it is a manipulation by the powerful IMFA/ICCL group
to obtain such a massive waiver when the Banks  do not hesitate to deploy
goons to  heckle the common man for the timely repayment of Loans provided
for the purchase of Motor Cycles/ Scooters, and when the poor farmers  in
the State ( cotton growers in Bolangir/Kalahandi Districts ) are committing
suicides  under the pressure of Bank Loans.

I am sure the matter will be taken up by the Political Parties of the State.

Thanks,

J.N.Mahanty

Dear Readers:

This is not only a matter of pity, but also a matter of concern regarding
the quality of primary education in our state. How can some teacher live
without salary and yet teach students efficiently. We celebrate 'Guru
Divas'  to respect whom ?

I  am copying this to our Honorable CM and CS of Orissa for immediate
release of the teacher's salary with interest.

Thanks
Manoj Padhi

Dear friends,
it is very sad to inform that the news reporting in our state is not
impartial. What I feel is they are driven by specific political parties.
Some are inclined to the Government and some are to the opposition. Hence
the news comming in a news paper is clearly indicating the orientation of
the editor towards a party.
I dont know how far it is helpful in the public information system. But so
far the important news are concern, it should be publish with honesty.

Recently there are some happening in the state, which is a hinious crime,
which cannot be tolerated, which cannot be imagined, which states that the
law and order is how badly exist.

HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A NEWS REPORTING AGENT WHICH CAN VIEW THE RARE
BANANA TREE FORM A REMORT AREA OF KORAPUT DISTRICT, IS UNABLE TO FLASH HIS
CAMERA FOR THE HINIUS CRIME EVENT, HAPPENING JUST FEW  MILES FROM THE RELAY
STATION.

I guess following points

* The agency which is not able to report this news is having some intrest
in this.
* Or they are afraid of this happening
* The criminals are gangsters, and they dont want to expose them.
* Or this happening is a political game to blame the Government

Please raise a broad discussion on this happening and draw the attention of
the Government to rectify the public information system.

HAPPY DIWALI TO ALL

&gt; Dear All,

&gt; Going by a News Item from ETV-Oriya,  7.00 PM, 4th October,2007,  various
&gt; Financial Institutions viz. IDBI, IFCI, ICICI and PSU Banks like IOB,
&gt; Canara
&gt; Bank, PNB, etc have announced  to waive  a major part of the Loans
&gt; provided
&gt; to IMFA/ICCL,  during the Nineties and that the total amount to be waived
&gt; works out to approximately Rupees 2300 Crores!

&gt; Whilst the background of such a massive Waiver  is not clear, it appears

&gt; Some critics opine that it is a manipulation by the powerful IMFA/ICCL

&gt;  goons to  heckle the common man for the timely repayment of Loans
&gt; provided
&gt; for the purchase of Motor Cycles/ Scooters, and when the poor farmers  in
&gt; the State ( cotton growers in Bolangir/Kalahandi Districts ) are
&gt; committing
&gt; suicides  under the pressure of Bank Loans.

&gt; I am sure the matter will be taken up by the Political Parties of the
&gt; State.

Dear Chief Minister of my state and My dear OTN members,

A happy Diwali to all.

Here is an opportunity for me to share something important in the occassion
of Diwali. We are talking a lot about Light, but we are still in complete
darkness. I dont know if we delibarately want the darkness to stay with us.
The public information system in our state is still blind and partial.It is
not able to report correct information. For a single happening different
news paper present it in different way. Some times some news paper ignore
the happening or not reporting the same. Why it is so? Mostly it is found
that the news reporters are associated with Political activities and this
is the reason why they ignore some news, even if it is important.

IT IS FOR THE CHIEF MINISTER TO TAKE A STEP FORWARD AND SET UP A PUBLIC
INFORMATION REVIEW SYSTEM,IF IT IS NOT IN EXISTENCE. THERE SHOULD BE A
PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE NEWS REPORTING AND IT'S QUALITY ASSESSMENT, TO MAKE
IT MORE COMPETENT, THE HELP SHOULD BE SHOUGHT OUT FROM SOME REPUTED NEWS
REPORTING FIRM.

My dear news reporters, if you are not able to inform the correct news,if
you are not able to upgrade, please get out of the public information
system. A news paper we ORIYAS want to see not of the Editors', but of the
interest of Orissa.

This is a Diwali message.

&gt; Dear Manoj Babu,

&gt;                                    Since the matter is sub-judice, I can
&gt; only comment on limited aspects.  This matter relates to 2003 and is
&gt; being
&gt; raked up by people with certain vested interests.  Imfa's sister concern
&gt; ICCL's mining lease was delayed for several years due to political
&gt; interference, but was finally granted by an order of the Hon'ble Supreme
&gt; Court in 1999.  ICCL, which had been running in losses, then resumed
&gt; regular
&gt; payments to all lenders.  In 2003, after several years of regular
&gt; payments,
&gt; ICCL entered into a corporate debt restructuring (CDR) scheme (as per RBI
&gt; guidelines).

&gt; The loan itself was around 200 odd crores and was not waived.  However,
&gt; there were waivers of penal interest, liquidated damages, etc.  This did
&gt; not
&gt; involve either the state or the central governments at all.  Such schemes
&gt; have been availed by hundreds of companies all over the country,
&gt; including
&gt; many well known national names (eg. Jindals, Essar, IG Petrochem) and
&gt; also
&gt; many companies in Orissa (eg Eastern Media- Sambad, Facor).

&gt; Besides debt restructuring, the scheme involved sacrifice of large
&gt; portion
&gt; of shareholding in the company.  Further, the CDR scheme also imposed a
&gt; merger of the company with Imfa (which did NOT have accumulated losses).
&gt; This scheme was sanctioned by an order of the Hon'ble High Court, which
&gt; dismissed identical allegations by another party only a few weeks ago.
&gt; Subsequently, some parties have tried to imply motives which simply do
&gt; not
&gt; arise.

&gt; I am sure all your questions will be satisfactorily answered when the
&gt; present matter in the Hon'ble High Court gets heard.  I cannot say more
&gt; at
&gt; this stage, perhaps after the matter has been completed in court.

&gt; Dear All,

&gt; Going by a News Item from ETV-Oriya,  7.00 PM, 4th October,2007,  various
&gt; Financial Institutions viz. IDBI, IFCI, ICICI and PSU Banks like IOB,
&gt; Canara
&gt; Bank, PNB, etc have announced  to waive  a major part of the Loans
&gt; provided
&gt; to IMFA/ICCL,  during the Nineties and that the total amount to be waived
&gt; works out to approximately Rupees 2300 Crores!

&gt; Whilst the background of such a massive Waiver  is not clear, it appears
&gt; very strange as to how the Banks and FIs could waive such a big amount
&gt; for a
&gt; large Industrial House.

&gt; Some critics opine that it is a manipulation by the powerful IMFA/ICCL
&gt; group
&gt; to obtain such a massive waiver when the Banks  do not hesitate to deploy
&gt;  goons to  heckle the common man for the timely repayment of Loans
&gt; provided
&gt; for the purchase of Motor Cycles/ Scooters, and when the poor farmers  in
&gt; the State ( cotton growers in Bolangir/Kalahandi Districts ) are
&gt; committing
&gt; suicides  under the pressure of Bank Loans.

I totally agree with the views of Mr.Mishra. Over the last two years
since I shifted to Orissa there has not been a single day that I
have'nt searched the local newspapers i.e., New Indian Express, Times
of India, Dharitri, Samaj the main ones. And ironically theres always
a different story on the same issue. Further, without naming any
newspapers, some important issues are deliberately left out by some
publications. This raises an apprehension that perhaps media is not
independent in Orissa. These are my observations, however, I may be
wrong as well.

Regards,

Sreejit

&gt; Dear friends,
&gt; it is very sad to inform that the news reporting in our state is not
&gt; impartial. What I feel is they are driven by specific political parties.
&gt; Some are inclined to the Government and some are to the opposition. Hence
&gt; the news comming in a news paper is clearly indicating the orientation of
&gt; the editor towards a party.
&gt; I dont know how far it is helpful in the public information system. But so
&gt; far the important news are concern, it should be publish with honesty.

&gt; Recently there are some happening in the state, which is a hinious crime,
&gt; which cannot be tolerated, which cannot be imagined, which states that the
&gt; law and order is how badly exist.

&gt; HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A NEWS REPORTING AGENT WHICH CAN VIEW THE RARE
&gt; BANANA TREE FORM A REMORT AREA OF KORAPUT DISTRICT, IS UNABLE TO FLASH HIS
&gt; CAMERA FOR THE HINIUS CRIME EVENT, HAPPENING JUST FEW  MILES FROM THE RELAY
&gt; STATION.

&gt; I guess following points

&gt; * The agency which is not able to report this news is having some intrest
&gt;   in this.
&gt; * Or they are afraid of this happening
&gt; * The criminals are gangsters, and they dont want to expose them.
&gt; * Or this happening is a political game to blame the Government

&gt; Please raise a broad discussion on this happening and draw the attention of
&gt; the Government to rectify the public information system.

Dear Friends:
This is a very partinent point. I commend Manoj babu and OTN members
to bring up such burning issues.
Yes, this is a well known fact that newspapers have their party lines.
I still remember how Biju-Biren Govt were destroyed - partly because
of their acts but mostly because of vicious attack  in both Samaj and
Prajatantra. Biju Patnaik tried to hoist Kalinga  but did not succeed.
Similarly, Nandini Sathpathy started Dharitri, when she got isolated
from the main two news papers. Sambada is JP's paper- to everyone's
knowledge.

The reporting on POSCO story in Orissa is very biased. Because 24 of
the top journalists visited Korea and Japan at their cost and were
wined and dined for a month. The media has not even reported the names
of the compromised journalists. Does any one  have here have a clue to
this as to who they were?
All we know  that some top 24 journalists, were invited by POSCO to
visit their country as a good will gesture. But not who they were.
Why?
Do you know  these 24 can be unbiased?
Best wishes,
Sandip

&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thu, 4 Oct 2007 21:01:05 +0530

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear All,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Going by a News Item from ETV-Oriya,  7.00 PM, 4th October,2007,  various
&gt; &gt; &gt; Financial Institutions viz. IDBI, IFCI, ICICI and PSU Banks like IOB,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Canara
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bank, PNB, etc have announced  to waive  a major part of the Loans
&gt; &gt; &gt; provided
&gt; &gt; &gt; to IMFA/ICCL,  during the Nineties and that the total amount to be waived
&gt; &gt; &gt; works out to approximately Rupees 2300 Crores!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Whilst the background of such a massive Waiver  is not clear, it appears
&gt; &gt; &gt; very strange as to how the Banks and FIs could waive such a big amount
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a
&gt; &gt; &gt; large Industrial House.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Some critics opine that it is a manipulation by the powerful IMFA/ICCL
&gt; &gt; &gt; group
&gt; &gt; &gt; to obtain such a massive waiver when the Banks  do not hesitate to deploy
&gt; &gt; &gt;  goons to  heckle the common man for the timely repayment of Loans
&gt; &gt; &gt; provided
&gt; &gt; &gt; for the purchase of Motor Cycles/ Scooters, and when the poor farmers  in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the State ( cotton growers in Bolangir/Kalahandi Districts ) are
&gt; &gt; &gt; committing
&gt; &gt; &gt; suicides  under the pressure of Bank Loans.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am sure the matter will be taken up by the Political Parties of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; State.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,

Dear Sandip ji

There is no doubt that the present day media is not which it used to be even
few years before.

Media has been named as 4th pillar of our democracy. When the other pillars
are also shaking, how this 4th pillar will remain unaffected?

Just as political persons have their agenda and to prove it or carry
forward, they need their own voice in shape of what has been described by
you with few examples, but for industrial houses, it has become a fashion to
manage and  create an atmosphere in their favour and hence the bribery of
the 4th pillar is evident in shape of the visit of few journalists to South
Korea. The extended stay of one month also raises more questions that can
only be answered by the news paper editors what was seen by them and what
work out they have done over there that can be of any use to the people of
Orissa to share with.

The fact is very simple. To build an opinion in favour of the company who
wants to have his own port to play all sorts of gimmicks in iron ore and
steel slabs and what not, the need of port is there. POSCO is to import poor
quality or iron ore from Brazil, use the same here in their plant, create
huge pollution by paying bribe to the state pollution control board, as it
may not be possible in their country and export top quality iron ore from
India to their south Korean plant and our so called intellectuals glorify
the need of a private port for a foreign company whose roots extends to the
USA and is now coming out that the said lobby is also one amongst few others
to push forward the Indo- US Nuke deal. It is expected from the 4th pillar
to create awareness amongst the people but how can we expect them to do that
when they have been served properly and who knows even now the 24 Carat
investment for POSCO is yielding results for them.

मेरा भारत महान है
यहा पैसा फेंको तमाशा देखो वाला हाल है.
जब चोर लोग सरकार में हो तब
आप हम और बहोत से साथियों
चर्चा करने के अलावा और कर भी क्या सकते है?

&gt; Dear Friends:
&gt; This is a very partinent point. I commend Manoj babu and OTN members
&gt; to bring up such burning issues.
&gt; Yes, this is a well known fact that newspapers have their party lines.
&gt; I still remember how Biju-Biren Govt were destroyed - partly because
&gt; of their acts but mostly because of vicious attack  in both Samaj and
&gt; Prajatantra. Biju Patnaik tried to hoist Kalinga  but did not succeed.
&gt; Similarly, Nandini Sathpathy started Dharitri, when she got isolated
&gt; from the main two news papers. Sambada is JP's paper- to everyone's
&gt; knowledge.

&gt; The reporting on POSCO story in Orissa is very biased. Because 24 of
&gt; the top journalists visited Korea and Japan at their cost and were
&gt; wined and dined for a month. The media has not even reported the names
&gt; of the compromised journalists. Does any one  have here have a clue to
&gt; this as to who they were?
&gt; All we know  that some top 24 journalists, were invited by POSCO to
&gt; visit their country as a good will gesture. But not who they were.
&gt; Why?
&gt; Do you know  these 24 can be unbiased?
&gt; Best wishes,
&gt; Sandip

&gt; &gt; I totally agree with the views of Mr.Mishra. Over the last two years
&gt; &gt; since I shifted to Orissa there has not been a single day that I
&gt; &gt; have'nt searched the local newspapers i.e., New Indian Express, Times
&gt; &gt; of India, Dharitri, Samaj the main ones. And ironically theres always
&gt; &gt; a different story on the same issue. Further, without naming any
&gt; &gt; newspapers, some important issues are deliberately left out by some
&gt; &gt; publications. This raises an apprehension that perhaps media is not
&gt; &gt; independent in Orissa. These are my observations, however, I may be
&gt; &gt; wrong as well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear friends,
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is very sad to inform that the news reporting in our state is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; impartial. What I feel is they are driven by specific political
&gt; parties.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some are inclined to the Government and some are to the opposition.
&gt; Hence
&gt; &gt; &gt; the news comming in a news paper is clearly indicating the orientation
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the editor towards a party.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I dont know how far it is helpful in the public information system.
&gt; But so
&gt; &gt; &gt; far the important news are concern, it should be publish with honesty.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Recently there are some happening in the state, which is a hinious
&gt; crime,
&gt; &gt; &gt; which cannot be tolerated, which cannot be imagined, which states that
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; law and order is how badly exist.

&gt; &gt; &gt; HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A NEWS REPORTING AGENT WHICH CAN VIEW THE RARE
&gt; &gt; &gt; BANANA TREE FORM A REMORT AREA OF KORAPUT DISTRICT, IS UNABLE TO FLASH
&gt; HIS
&gt; &gt; &gt; CAMERA FOR THE HINIUS CRIME EVENT, HAPPENING JUST FEW  MILES FROM THE
&gt; RELAY
&gt; &gt; &gt; STATION.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess following points

&gt; &gt; &gt; * The agency which is not able to report this news is having some
&gt; intrest
&gt; &gt; &gt;   in this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; * Or they are afraid of this happening
&gt; &gt; &gt; * The criminals are gangsters, and they dont want to expose them.
&gt; &gt; &gt; * Or this happening is a political game to blame the Government

&gt; &gt; &gt; Please raise a broad discussion on this happening and draw the
&gt; attention of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Government to rectify the public information system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; HAPPY DIWALI TO ALL

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Mr. Panda:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for your valuable time and answering our readers queries.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a habit of asking directly to the people's involved, instead
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; searching hear and there and get a twisted version.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Hope, you are fine with this attitude.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I  have faith in Indian Law and all the best.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope, this clarifies any rumour(s), you might have been heard.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Manoj Babu,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                    Since the matter is sub-judice, I
&gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only comment on limited aspects.  This matter relates to 2003 and is

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raked up by people with certain vested interests.  Imfa's sister
&gt; concern
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ICCL's mining lease was delayed for several years due to political
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interference, but was finally granted by an order of the Hon'ble
&gt; Supreme
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Court in 1999.  ICCL, which had been running in losses, then resumed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regular
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; payments to all lenders.  In 2003, after several years of regular
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; payments,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ICCL entered into a corporate debt restructuring (CDR) scheme (as
&gt; per RBI
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guidelines).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The loan itself was around 200 odd crores and was not
&gt; waived.  However,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there were waivers of penal interest, liquidated damages, etc.  This
&gt; did
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; involve either the state or the central governments at all.  Such
&gt; schemes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been availed by hundreds of companies all over the country,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; including
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many well known national names (eg. Jindals, Essar, IG Petrochem)
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many companies in Orissa (eg Eastern Media- Sambad, Facor).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Besides debt restructuring, the scheme involved sacrifice of large
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; portion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of shareholding in the company.  Further, the CDR scheme also
&gt; imposed a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merger of the company with Imfa (which did NOT have accumulated
&gt; losses).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This scheme was sanctioned by an order of the Hon'ble High Court,
&gt; which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dismissed identical allegations by another party only a few weeks
&gt; ago.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subsequently, some parties have tried to imply motives which simply
&gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am sure all your questions will be satisfactorily answered when
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; present matter in the Hon'ble High Court gets heard.  I cannot say
&gt; more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this stage, perhaps after the matter has been completed in court.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With regards,
