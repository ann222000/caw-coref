I'm trying to backup my entire hard drive to an external hard drive
but having some problems.

I was previously using Windows backup but it locks up (with a tiny
window that says &quot;looking for backup devices&quot;) when I try to
run it now, after previously having to terminate it with task manager
when it locked up during a backup due to the failure of my former
external hard drive.

Robocopy fails when it comes to ntuser.dat because the file is in use
- even though I've disabled copying of system and hidden files.

Anyone know of some reasonable and inexpensive backup software that
works better than copy *.*  i.e. that will reliably copy changed or
new files when I re-run the backup.

TIA.

This was recommended either here or in a mag a while back, it's free.

Thanks, it seems quite nice but doesn't let me exclude files based on
attributes and can't easily copy open files  - not bad for free
though.

XP Pro.  Windows backup is starting up ok now - I think my USB drives
might have caused it a problem, depending on whether they're plugged
in or what drive letter gets assigned to them.  Whatever the reason, I
don't want to use Windows backup anymore because if you can't run the
backup software, you can't use your backup.

It sounds like yer plugging the USB drive in at the wrong time :)

ntbackup works just fine with USB drives, although it's not the solution
that 'impossible' suggests, which you might want to run also.

I run both, ntbackup runs daily as does the full version of Paragon's
Drive Backup.  Acronis True Image is pretty much the same, and that you
have access to a free cutdown/older version is pretty cool I think.

The cool thing about backing up using imaging s/w (with the exception to
MS's crappy new ASR backups which you'll find probably won't work at
boot with a USB drive (unlike Acronis or Paragon)), is that you have a
complete image to restore.  ntbackup covers file based backups a lot
better IMO (and is the only way to backup things like Exchange Server).
You should also check your database backups if you have any to do, and
do those using the database engine if you run a client/server database.

Dunno, not used it for a few years, but I'd guess it can do file
restores (dig in and open an image to see files etc).

Imaging s/w is best tried out at OS install time - so if a test restore
fails, you've not lost much.

Unfortunately, if you're way down the track, then you still need to test
a restore (just as you need to test file restores).  The consequences of
an image restore failure though... hmmm... :(  But you *do* have to test
it.  No point in makin' 'em otherwise. Good luck :)

The pro versions of backup software can usually copy open files.  I'm
used to Windows ntbackup being able to do it.

I don't know exactly what the problem is but if an application is in
the process of changing a file, the operating system would have to
make a copy to provide for &quot;readers&quot; before allowing &quot;writer&quot; access
to the file  - I guess Windows doesn't do this but I really don't know
anything about it.  I wonder how the pro versions handle files that
are in an &quot;incomplete&quot; state  - I would have thought they'd have to
skip locked files.

I've always had good luck with Abakt ( http://www.xs4all.nl/~edienske/
abakt/index.html) -- at least I've always had good luck with it. Plays
nice with 7-zip and networked drives, decent filtering options, and it's
even GPL software. I haven't tried the new Python version though.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; works better than copy *.*  i.e. that will reliably copy changed or
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; new files when I re-run the backup.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;What version of windows are you running?

&gt;&gt;&gt; XP Pro.  Windows backup is starting up ok now - I think my USB drives
&gt;&gt;&gt; might have caused it a problem, depending on whether they're plugged
&gt;&gt;&gt; in or what drive letter gets assigned to them.  Whatever the reason, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't want to use Windows backup anymore because if you can't run the
&gt;&gt;&gt; backup software, you can't use your backup.

&gt;&gt;It sounds like yer plugging the USB drive in at the wrong time :)

&gt;&gt;ntbackup works just fine with USB drives, although it's not the solution
&gt;&gt;that 'impossible' suggests, which you might want to run also.

&gt;&gt;I run both, ntbackup runs daily as does the full version of Paragon's
&gt;&gt;Drive Backup.  Acronis True Image is pretty much the same, and that you
&gt;&gt;have access to a free cutdown/older version is pretty cool I think.

&gt;&gt;The cool thing about backing up using imaging s/w (with the exception to
&gt;&gt;MS's crappy new ASR backups which you'll find probably won't work at
&gt;&gt;boot with a USB drive (unlike Acronis or Paragon)), is that you have a
&gt;&gt;complete image to restore.  ntbackup covers file based backups a lot
&gt;&gt;better IMO (and is the only way to backup things like Exchange Server).
&gt;&gt;You should also check your database backups if you have any to do, and
&gt;&gt;do those using the database engine if you run a client/server database.

&gt; I have Norton Ghost version 9 (aka V 2004) but never installed it and
&gt; not sure I want to.  Without installing it I can't tell whether I can
&gt; &quot;restore&quot; selected files and folders from the backup - if not, it's
&gt; not what I want.

Either Norton Gost 12 or Acronis TrueImage Home 10 will do what you want,
and both are reasonably priced.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Is not the problem of copying open files created by MS windows

&gt;&gt; The pro versions of backup software can usually copy open files.

&gt;Why is this considered a &quot;pro&quot; (i.e. extra-cost) feature?

Because syncback pro and viceversa can do it (so they say) but
syncback free, robocopy and cobian can't.

That's just restating the point I was questioning, without actually
answering the question.
