I first discovered them in an old but wonderful book from the library whose name
I have forgotten.  Most of the book was taken up with chooks but there was a
section on ducks and geese at the back, with a photo of this glorious goose with
ringlets!

Yes, I can imagine they'd be hard to keep in show condition.  I've got a
half-frizzle rooster and he's very beautiful and no trouble whatsoever.  He came
from friend L's collection of the morning's eggs from her assorted chooks.  She
had had pure-breds but said the full frizzles were messy, always breaking
feathers and looking like vandalized dust-mops.  His son is waiting for fate.
Like his Dad he is gentle and very sweet and I long for him to go to a good
home, not Casserole Castle.  Meanwhile he and a younger non-frizzle lad who will
end up at that destination as soon as I get a round tuit live in a bachelor flat
and get let out periodically to eat grass and fallen fruit.  But the fallen
fruit is down the orchard, and they'd rather hang around the chook house so they
can admire the girls through the wire.  Frizzle Jr spends quite a bit of time
visiting Big Red and her 3 araucana chicks &amp; one pale gold part-friz, coming
into grey and white feathers.

Isn't it intriguing watching the feathers come in?  A chick who looks like it
ought to be pure white can turn into a rainbow!

But that page says: "They are reputed to be of European origin and were
called Sebastopol after being brought from the seaport of Sebastopol."

So were they developed in that region or were they wild gees? I don't
understand ...

I referred to the sebostopol as an "exotic" breed because if I go buy an
Embden, white Chinese, Tolouse, or African, I'd pay less than $10 for
the goslings, but for sebastopol it's about $50, and sebastopols are
harder to get. Same applies to Canadians...

I paid $200 for a pair of canadians.  Yes, Canadians run wild in
certain areas, but they are more expensive to get than the other breeds.

Except Canadian Geese are a wild bird - anywhere in the world.
Their availablility to the market may vary considerably around the world and
so their price.

Sepastapols are a genetic variant of the domestics. Almost all of these are
derived from teh Greylag [there may be a bit of Swan goose in a few]
Their price is a reflection of demand and probably, like many of these
breeds, low productivity - they lay few geese and hatch fewer. Therefore, in
an effort to support the time, money and effort that goes into raising each
generation the price is higher than for others. The sales of each bird has
to contribute to raising surplus males; keeping their parents all year
around; failed hatching attempts; time; feed; bedding;
Examples are
Two young adult birds sold from one pair in a year compared to
Ten young adult birds sold from one pair in a year

The economics are pertty simple then
;)

Yup -- there are farmers in Islay who would commisserate
There are now schemes to compensate land owners in certain places
Some of our areas are important wintering grounds for various species but
boy do they eat alot!

in certain areas, some geese take over golf courses and drive the gofers
and greenskeepers crazy..

In parts of Scottsdale, Arizona, along the Indian Bend Wash, what is now
a green belt, golf courses and the like, you can find lots of Canadian
Geese here in the winter months.

geese are great lawn mowers. they mow the grass and fertilize at the
same time, only problem is if you dont watch it, you can step in their
droppings.

At my house, I need to fix the fence as the geesse like to come on the
front porch and leave their droppings behind.

It's easy to tell when my two candians honk as they sound more like a
whoop.  than a chinese, tolouse or embden....
