Does a 1200 ride/handle much like an 883?  I have very little experience
on a bike, but took my friends 883 Sportster out for a 10 mile ride.  I
had no problems with the clutch or control, and felt like it would be
second nature after a week or two of driving it.  I'm planning on
getting my first bike soon, but would really prefer a sportster 1200.  I
see that the dimensions and weight are very similar, and am curious if
the ride is as well.  Thanks in advance for your input.

Yeah, do it. I'm new around here and I haven't ridden a sporty (so
YMMV), but go bigger. I wish I had my first time around. Just don't get
too confident with it as your first bike so you don't wrap it around a
tree. Lots of folks will say a 1200 is too big for your first bike, but
as long as you're a grown up who can hold back at first you'll do great.

And your response is EXACTLY what scares the hell out of anyone who's
been riding for years. You feel like after a "week or two" of "driving
it", it'll become "second nature" and the plain fact of the matter is,
IT WON'T.

Let me tell ya something, I've been riding for, jeez, 37 years now
(big fucking deal, many in here have been at it a lot longer) and if I
ever feel so smug and accomplished that I think motorcycling is second
nature, I hope the hell someone takes my keys and never lets me on two
wheels again.  That's the kind of attitude that gets people killed,
plain and simple.

Am I comfortable on a bike?  Sure, even more so than in a car, but if
you honestly think that in a week or so you're gonna be in tune with a
two wheeled machine, then I'm with Snag - you're more than likely
gonna wrap yourself around a tree, mailbox, or back end of a buick in
fairly short order.  Hopefully you won't take any of your new "bro's"
out with ya in the process.

Take my advice, buy a beater and head for the dirt.  Practice doing
stoopid shit and dump the bike a lot. Dirt's forgiving and with luck
you won't break many bones doing this. Learn how to bounce off rocks,
stumps, and small animals, then learn how to avoid all three at low
and high rates of speed. Learn how to react when your rear tire slides
out from under you.  Practice cornering in slippery mud, wet leaves,
and loose sand.  Learn how to shift your weight to keep controlled
balance going uphill and downhill. Do all these things before you get
on the road on a high-powered motorcycle and start aiming at other
people in big shiny boxes and on other motorcycles (myself included).

Motorcycling isn't so much about learning what to do.  It's more about
learning what NOT do to, and that takes a lifetime to learn.

Not that anyone asked, but my learner was a 750cc Kawasaki. I took the
safety course and took it really really easy. I never stopped taking
it really really easy. My advice to the guy was putting him in my
shoes where I stay paranoid which might not be the best kind of
advice.

My 750 revved way too high on the highway to be comfortable so within
a few months I wanted a bigger engine.

That safety course saved my life I think. We practiced evasive action
stuff for an evening and when a car almost took me out at 50mph a few
years ago I still had the muscle memory to countersteer from all the
practicing. It was very close.

I typically don't frequent news groups and especially don't tend to
respond, but couldn't help this time.  I'm not sure what made you
extrapolate what I said into me being Evel Knievel.  I merely asked if a
1200 handles like an 883, and the next thing I know, I am wrapping
myself around a tree and killing my "bros".
All of last summer I drove an old 250.  I was glad to cut my teeth on
it.  Maybe "learn to react when the back tire slides out" and see how a
motorized two wheeler responds to different conditions.  I would like a
Harley, and was just a little surprised to find a close-knit group that
would wave as I drove my tiny POS by even though they were on 1600 hogs.
I was therefore more than a little surprised to be flamed here for
asking a simple question.  I am a very conservative driver.  I did drive
and old bike 2000 miles last year, but I don't consider myself "smug and
acclomplished".
I guess it isn't fair to call the potential Harley my first bike- I
didn't call the old beater 74 VW Rabbit I drove years ago my first car
either.  That was the Honda I bought when I got out of school.
What I meant by 2nd nature was just that:  When I drive my manual car,
I don't think about how fast I am going, if I am going up hill or down,
if I am accelerating or not.... I just drive.  That's what I meant by
2nd nature.  Not thinking about what gear you're in etc... just feeling
the road and responding.  Since I have ridden a bike, and am familiar
with a manual tranny, I expect that to be the case in short order.  I
certainly don't expect to be any sort of expert biker in 2 weeks.  All I
want is a bike I can enjoy for years, not to be bashed for asking a
question.

Thank you for your advice, SS.  You were the only one to not
completely flame me for asking a question.  I guess that technically,
this will not be my first bike.  I have a hard time calling the 250 I am
driving now a "bike"  Yes, It will be a jump to go from a 250 to an 883
or a 1200.  That's why I asked the question that I did.
I am also a paranoid driver.  I have seen how car drivers look right
through you as they stop at an intersection and am going to take the
safety course this summer.  Feel free to take the policy out if you like!!

&gt; it.  Maybe &quot;learn to react when the back tire slides out&quot; and see how a
&gt; motorized two wheeler responds to different conditions.  I would like a
&gt; Harley, and was just a little surprised to find a close-knit group that
&gt; would wave as I drove my tiny POS by even though they were on 1600 hogs.
&gt;  I was therefore more than a little surprised to be flamed here for
&gt; asking a simple question.  I am a very conservative driver.  I did drive
&gt; and old bike 2000 miles last year, but I don't consider myself &quot;smug and
&gt; acclomplished&quot;.
&gt;  I guess it isn't fair to call the potential Harley my first bike- I
&gt; didn't call the old beater 74 VW Rabbit I drove years ago my first car
&gt; either.  That was the Honda I bought when I got out of school.
&gt;  What I meant by 2nd nature was just that:  When I drive my manual car,
&gt; I don't think about how fast I am going, if I am going up hill or down,
&gt; if I am accelerating or not.... I just drive.  That's what I meant by
&gt; 2nd nature.  Not thinking about what gear you're in etc... just feeling
&gt; the road and responding.  Since I have ridden a bike, and am familiar
&gt; with a manual tranny, I expect that to be the case in short order.  I
&gt; certainly don't expect to be any sort of expert biker in 2 weeks.  All I
&gt; want is a bike I can enjoy for years, not to be bashed for asking a
&gt; question.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What's the matter?  You had your first bike once, too.

&gt;&gt; And your response is EXACTLY what scares the hell out of anyone who's
&gt;&gt; been riding for years. You feel like after a &quot;week or two&quot; of &quot;driving
&gt;&gt; it&quot;, it'll become &quot;second nature&quot; and the plain fact of the matter is,
&gt;&gt; IT WON'T.

&gt;&gt; Let me tell ya something, I've been riding for, jeez, 37 years now
&gt;&gt; (big fucking deal, many in here have been at it a lot longer) and if I
&gt;&gt; ever feel so smug and accomplished that I think motorcycling is second
&gt;&gt; nature, I hope the hell someone takes my keys and never lets me on two
&gt;&gt; wheels again.  That's the kind of attitude that gets people killed,
&gt;&gt; plain and simple.

&gt;&gt; Am I comfortable on a bike?  Sure, even more so than in a car, but if
&gt;&gt; you honestly think that in a week or so you're gonna be in tune with a
&gt;&gt; two wheeled machine, then I'm with Snag - you're more than likely
&gt;&gt; gonna wrap yourself around a tree, mailbox, or back end of a buick in
&gt;&gt; fairly short order.  Hopefully you won't take any of your new &quot;bro's&quot;
&gt;&gt; out with ya in the process.

&gt;&gt; Take my advice, buy a beater and head for the dirt.  Practice doing
&gt;&gt; stoopid shit and dump the bike a lot. Dirt's forgiving and with luck
&gt;&gt; you won't break many bones doing this. Learn how to bounce off rocks,
&gt;&gt; stumps, and small animals, then learn how to avoid all three at low
&gt;&gt; and high rates of speed. Learn how to react when your rear tire slides
&gt;&gt; out from under you.  Practice cornering in slippery mud, wet leaves,
&gt;&gt; and loose sand.  Learn how to shift your weight to keep controlled
&gt;&gt; balance going uphill and downhill. Do all these things before you get
&gt;&gt; on the road on a high-powered motorcycle and start aiming at other
&gt;&gt; people in big shiny boxes and on other motorcycles (myself included).

&gt;&gt; Motorcycling isn't so much about learning what to do.  It's more about
&gt;&gt; learning what NOT do to, and that takes a lifetime to learn.

Yeah, but you said it was your first bike, implying that you had little to

Yes, and in the long run you will much happier with it as your skill
set improves.  There is a chance that you'll out-grow the 1200, but at
a far slower rate then the 883.  If you do, you'll be glad you got the
1200 as there is a very small used market for the 883's and they
depreciate the fastest of all of the models.

I've always been both a dirt and street rider. There's been times when
I did one more than the other, but I'm currently enjoying both dirt
and street riding. What I find interesting is that (for me), dirt
riding does very little to improve how I ride or respond on the
street. On the other hand, after a long ride on the Harley, I can do
stuff on my dirt bike that  surprises me.

Yes, but I was never arrogant enough to think that a "week or two" of
riding would make it feel like "second nature" to me. (Or a month or
two, or a year or two.) That kind of arrogance will get you or someone
else killed. One moment of inattention is enough to get you killed. If
you don't know that, and practice that religiously, you don't belong

You just need to be aware of what you're doing at all times and even

&gt; &gt;(big fucking deal, many in here have been at it a lot longer) and if I
&gt; &gt;ever feel so smug and accomplished that I think motorcycling is second
&gt; &gt;nature, I hope the hell someone takes my keys and never lets me on two
&gt; &gt;wheels again.  That's the kind of attitude that gets people killed,
&gt; &gt;plain and simple.

&gt; &gt;Am I comfortable on a bike?  Sure, even more so than in a car, but if
&gt; &gt;you honestly think that in a week or so you're gonna be in tune with a
&gt; &gt;two wheeled machine, then I'm with Snag - you're more than likely
&gt; &gt;gonna wrap yourself around a tree, mailbox, or back end of a buick in
&gt; &gt;fairly short order.  Hopefully you won't take any of your new &quot;bro's&quot;
&gt; &gt;out with ya in the process.

&gt; &gt;Take my advice, buy a beater and head for the dirt.  Practice doing
&gt; &gt;stoopid shit and dump the bike a lot. Dirt's forgiving and with luck
&gt; &gt;you won't break many bones doing this. Learn how to bounce off rocks,
&gt; &gt;stumps, and small animals, then learn how to avoid all three at low
&gt; &gt;and high rates of speed. Learn how to react when your rear tire slides
&gt; &gt;out from under you.  Practice cornering in slippery mud, wet leaves,
&gt; &gt;and loose sand.  Learn how to shift your weight to keep controlled
&gt; &gt;balance going uphill and downhill. Do all these things before you get
&gt; &gt;on the road on a high-powered motorcycle and start aiming at other
&gt; &gt;people in big shiny boxes and on other motorcycles (myself included).

&gt; &gt;Motorcycling isn't so much about learning what to do.  It's more about
&gt; &gt;learning what NOT do to, and that takes a lifetime to learn.

&gt; While your overall  advice isn't bad, I've seen tons of guys who
&gt; thought they were the cats shit in the dirt, kill themselves in their
&gt; first week on the street trying to pull some of the same shit they did
&gt; out in the woods.

Well, yeah., You can learn some good skills in the dirt.
Common sense OTOH, I guess you get that from living.

with respect, I'd strongly suggest an old smallish metric bike for the first
bike. It will be easier to pick up, and the damages won't cost anywhere near
as much to fix up.It ain't a mattter of IF yer goin' down, but WHEN. An
inexperienced rider is very likely to go down a few times - hopefully at low
speeds. This motorcycle shit is the most fun you are going to have with your
clothes on, but you gotta get into it gradual, like, before you get your
first new "good" bike. Of any marque. I respectfully suggest you also check
out the MSF beginner's course... it will save your life and shorten the time
you need to spend on your first small old used bike before getting that new
beauty.
Yeah, we were all beginners once, and this is the way that many of us started
and why we are still here.

Read the manual twice,  read the Mo. HP manual twice took the

untill I  had ridden about 5 mi.  Did I think I was Evel at that point?
No. But I knew  it was going to be fine.  The bike has VH pipes, sounds

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What's the matter?  You had your first bike once, too.

&gt;&gt; &gt;And your response is EXACTLY what scares the hell out of anyone who's
&gt;&gt; &gt;been riding for years. You feel like after a &quot;week or two&quot; of &quot;driving
&gt;&gt; &gt;it&quot;, it'll become &quot;second nature&quot; and the plain fact of the matter is,
&gt;&gt; &gt;IT WON'T.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Let me tell ya something, I've been riding for, jeez, 37 years now
&gt;&gt; &gt;(big fucking deal, many in here have been at it a lot longer) and if I
&gt;&gt; &gt;ever feel so smug and accomplished that I think motorcycling is second
&gt;&gt; &gt;nature, I hope the hell someone takes my keys and never lets me on two
&gt;&gt; &gt;wheels again.  That's the kind of attitude that gets people killed,
&gt;&gt; &gt;plain and simple.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Am I comfortable on a bike?  Sure, even more so than in a car, but if

&gt;&gt; &gt;two wheeled machine, then I'm with Snag - you're more than likely

&gt;&gt; &gt;out with ya in the process.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Take my advice, buy a beater and head for the dirt.  Practice doing
&gt;&gt; &gt;stoopid shit and dump the bike a lot. Dirt's forgiving and with luck
&gt;&gt; &gt;you won't break many bones doing this. Learn how to bounce off rocks,

My dad bought my first bike so I could get to college.  Paid $300 for a
Honda in 1972.  (I think it was 175 cc.)  I've had about a half a dozen
Japanese bikes and a 1968 pile 'o crap sporster chopper.  In my teens and
20's I rode two trucks, a Cadillac, some small import while splitting lanes
on the freeway, and about 30 yards of asphalt.  (It was the asphalt that
REALLY hurt!)

I soon figured out that I was really crappy at it and quit riding for a
while.  I got a brand new 883 last year and ride a lot more a cautiously now
in my old age.  (For example, I haven't dropped acid and gone for a ride
lately.)  I'm pretty good at dodging dumb-asses who try to change lanes into
me and pull out in front of me.

If you're getting your first bike, don't ride like a psycho.  Assume drivers
will hit you every chance they get and be ready to get out of the way.  Ride
like an asshole : Die like an asshole.

my advice to you is go get an older jap bike for awhile they are quite
affordable and you can usually find someone to buy it for about the same
price you bought it for if you take care of it and fix what it needs as
you own it ,good practice to get into , one bike that is very popular is
the yamaha xs 650 there are plenty of them around since they sold like
about 500,000 units during its run and you can pick up a real decent
ride for around 1200 bucks and later you could trade it in or sell it
and goto the next size up like the HD 883 or even the 1200 but run the
smaller bike for at least 1 year and if your not sure yet go 2 years and
definitely go take the MSF course it is well worth the time it takes .
well good luck

I would get a big twin like a Fat Boy, I found them easier to ride than the
