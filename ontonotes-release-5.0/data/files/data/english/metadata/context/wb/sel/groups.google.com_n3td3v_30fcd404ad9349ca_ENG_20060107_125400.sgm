Breaking Computrace's LoJack Part II

After my first hurried document, I figured I'd offer some follow
information. An employee from Absolute.com contacted my employer
rambling on about me being misinformed on their product. The
employee from Absolute was more than likely a salesman as he
couldn't answer technical questions so I requested that he send me
information about my laptop since he was &quot;concerned&quot; that it had
not &quot;phoned home&quot;. But yet he was stating it had &quot;phoned home&quot; and
Absolute was still able to track my machine.

One thing this person stated was that &quot;my machine was still calling
in, but not updating their database with information on the state
of my machine to their front end, but the back end was still
working&quot;. Meaning, although my machine was not phoning home, it was
phoning home. After a quick chuckle I again iterated that if this
were the case - that my machine still contacting his company - he
should be able to provide me with the information my machine was
supposedly sending. After I received his response I sent off a
detailed e-mail calling his bluff.

According to the staff at Absolute.com, my machine had called in
yesterday (January 06th 2006) morning at 9:45am. They even provided
me with an IP address. I was shocked and ready to throw in the
towel at that point, but decided to respond right back to them.

Firstly, on January 06th 2005, my machine was powered down.
Secondly, it was not physically plugged into any network. Thirdly,
Troppix was running on the machine and the CD was still in its
drive. Now I wondered what a marvelous feat it would be for 1)
Absolute to create a kinetic based program to power up my machine
at will. Such a great feat would bring them millions in revenue
from people seeking to conserve money on power. I then thought even
neater of them to have the ability to connect my machine to a
network without my knowledge. Zeroconf ( www.zeroconf.org ) must have
sped up production and given rights to Absolute or something.
Almost lastly would be the fact that they've ported over Windows
executable's and DLL's over to Linux.

If that wasn't enough of a slap in the face, Absolute graciously
provided me with what they labeled an IP address. The address they
gave me was 485819880. So I wondered? 1CFC05E8?
00011100111101010000010111101000? What kind of crap are they giving
me? If that's a decimal IP that would place me at 28.245.5.232.
That would mean that my machine was &quot;phoning home&quot; from a
Department of Defense&quot; network which would probably make me a
terrorist. Now I informed Absolute that I have a static address at
home, this I could verify with my company's syslog server as well
as 4 other (non company) servers which could provide them with my
IP address if they wanted it for verification purposes. Surely a
provider wouldn't pull Absolute's chain and give them false
information so any claims by Absolute of me &quot;fabricating my IP
address&quot; would be an insult.

So now as it stands, Absolute has a kinetic, Zeroconf, password
cracking, interchangeable (Windows executable to Linux binary)
product capable of finding anyone anywhere on the planet. For those
wondering about the password cracking part, how else could it have
booted up Troppix and logged in - in order to send out information.

To be fair I decided to boot into Windows XP turn on my firewall
and watch whatever tries to connect to - where and why. Sure enough
Internet Explorer was trying to send out information to a site that
just so happened to be owned by Absolute. Packet data anyone?

mequery.com.

So what was the best thing to do? Block it via my firewall or play
with my hosts file:

echo &quot;search.namequery.com 127.0.0.1&quot;&gt;&gt; C:\PATH\TO MY\HOSTS ...

Maybe I could have played with Absolute using Scapy
( http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/):

&lt;Ether dst=00:09:5b:6d:a0:9c src=00:00:00:31:33:17 type=0x800 |&lt;IP

urgptr=0

Perhaps change IP addressing every 5 minutes on a script, call them
and ask them &quot;Can you hear me now...&quot; ... &quot;Can you hear me now...&quot;

Anywho(w)...

Now I'd really like to know what Absolute has to say about 1) their
miraculous methods of finding my machine even when it is booted
into Windows with me redirecting via my hosts file. I'd also like
to know why if they were so concerned - as this salesperson's call
alluded to, why didn't he mention the 3-4 other laptops in my
stable that haven't &quot;phoned home&quot;.

Anyhow, the jury is out on this... Absolute has yet to respond
(once again). So for those from Absolute reading this (you've done
so before... Obviously in order to contact me at work) let it be
known, prior to the original writing being posted, and prior to
this one being sent, your company was notified.

Maybe, Just maybe. There's a parallel universe with you and a mirror
of your laptop. Of course in the other universe, Somethings would be
different such as the DoD IP address block
