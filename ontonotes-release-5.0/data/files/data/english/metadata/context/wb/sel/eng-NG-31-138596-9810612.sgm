Trapped gold miners brought to surface amid safety fears

Most of the 3,200 workers trapped a mile down a South African gold
mine were brought to the surface in a long rescue operation yesterday,
as the mine's owner acknowledged that safety might have been
compromised in favour of profits.
Some 2,700 miners emerged exhausted by their ordeal in temperatures
that ran as high as 40C (104F), after a broken pipe crashed down the
main lift shaft, cutting power on Wednesday. The remaining 500 miners
were expected to reach the surface by last night, via a second shaft
usually used to lift equipment and waste.

&quot;We nearly died down there,&quot; one man yelled as he emerged. &quot;I'd rather
leave than die in the mine.&quot;

Nearly 200 women were among those trapped underground.

Patrice Motsepe, chairman of Harmony Gold, the owner of the Elandsrand
mine west of Johannesburg, described the accident as a &quot;wake-up call&quot;
on safety in a country where deaths and injuries are several times
higher than in countries with comparable mines, such as Australia. &quot;We
have to recommit ourselves to refocus on safety in this country. Our
safety record both as a company and an industry leave much to be
desired,&quot; he said.

Mr Motsepe implicitly acknowledged that the competition between
investment in mine safety and dividends for shareholders put pressure
on maintenance. &quot;We run companies that have an obligation to all
constituencies. Shareholders are one of those constituencies, but we
[also] have an obligation to our employees,&quot; he said.

The National Union of Mineworkers said workers at the mine - the third
deepest in South Africa -had warned the management about poor
maintenance of the main shaft. &quot;We suspect negligence. Because of
continuous operations there is no time to make adequate checks,&quot; the
NUM president, Senzeni Zokwana, said.

Harmony Gold denied negligence. It said the shaft was inspected once a
week according to mine safety regulations. But the minerals and energy
minister, Buyelwa Sonjica, ordered the mine to be closed for up to six
weeks for investigations and repairs.

The union yesterday threatened a strike unless the government took
urgent action to ensure mine owners complied with safety standards.

The inspector of mines, Thabo Gazi, said he would conduct an
investigation into the accident, describing it as worrying. &quot;Old
infrastructure must be upgraded,&quot; he said.
