The 4 Boneheaded Biases of Stupid Voters

(And we're all stupid voters.)

Bryan Caplan &lt; http://www.reason.com/contrib/show/719.html &gt; | October 2007 Print

Almost all the &quot;respectable&quot; economic theories of politics begin by assuming
that the typical citizen understands economics and votes accordingly—at
least on average. By a &quot;miracle of aggregation,&quot; random errors are supposed
to balance themselves out. But this works only if voters' errors are random,
not systematic.

The evidence—most notably, the results of the 1996 Survey of Americans and
Economists on the Economy—shows that the general public's views on economics
not only are different from those of professional economists but are less
accurate, and in predictable ways. The public really does generally hold,
for starters, that prices are not governed by supply and demand, that
protectionism helps the economy, that saving labor is a bad idea, and that
living standards are falling. Economics journals regularly reject
theoretical papers that explicitly recognize these biases. In a well-known
piece in the *Journal of Political Economy* in 1995, the economists Stephen
Coate and Stephen Morris worry that some of their colleagues are smuggling
in the &quot;unreasonable assumptions&quot; that voters &quot;have biased beliefs about the
effects of policies&quot; and &quot;could be persistently fooled.&quot; That's the
economist's standard view of systematic voter bias: that it doesn't exist.

Or at least, that's what economists say as researchers. As *teachers*,
curiously, most economists adopt a different approach. When the latest batch
of freshmen shows up for Econ 1, textbook authors and instructors still try
to separate students from their prejudices. In the words of the famed
economist Paul Krugman, they try &quot;to vaccinate the minds of our
undergraduates against the misconceptions that are so predominant in
educated discussion.&quot;

Out of all the complaints that economists lodge against laymen, four
families of beliefs stand out: the anti-market bias, the anti-foreign bias,
the make-work bias, and the pessimistic bias.

*Anti-Market Bias
*I first learned about farm price supports in the produce section of the
grocery store. I was in kindergarten. My mother explained that price
supports seemed to make fruits and vegetables more expensive but assured me
that this conclusion was simplistic. If the supports went away, so many
farms would go out of business that prices would soon be higher than ever. I
accepted what she told me and felt a lingering sense that price competition
is bad for buyer and seller alike.

This was one of my first memorable encounters with anti-market bias, a
tendency to underestimate the economic benefits of the market mechanism. The
public has severe doubts about how much it can count on profit-seeking
business to produce socially beneficial outcomes. People focus on the
motives of business and neglect the discipline imposed by competition. While
economists admit that profit maximization plus market imperfections can
yield bad results, noneconomists tend to view successful greed as socially
harmful per se.

Joseph Schumpeter, arguably the greatest historian of economic thought,
matter-of-factly spoke of &quot;the ineradicable prejudice that every action
intended to serve the profit interest must be anti-social by this fact
alone.&quot; Anti-market bias, he implied, is not a temporary, culturally
specific aberration. It is a deeply rooted pattern of human thinking that
has frustrated economists for generations.

There are too many variations on anti-market bias to list them all. Probably
the most common error of this sort is to equate market payments with
transfers, ignoring their incentive properties. (A transfer, in economic
jargon, is a no-strings-attached movement of wealth from one person to
another.) All that matters, then, is how much you empathize with the
transfer's recipient compared to the transfer's provider. People tend, for
example, to see profits as a gift to the rich. So unless you perversely pity
the rich more than the poor, limiting profits seems like common sense.

Yet profits are not a handout but a quid pro quo: If you want to get rich,
you have to do something people will pay for. Profits give incentives to
reduce production costs, move resources from less-valued to more-valued
industries, and dream up new products. This is the central lesson of *The
Wealth of Nations*: The &quot;invisible hand&quot; quietly persuades selfish
businessmen to serve the public good. For modern economists, these are
truisms, yet teachers of economics keep quoting and requoting this passage.
Why? Because Adam Smith's thesis was counterintuitive to his contemporaries,
and it remains counterintuitive today.

A prejudice similar to the one against profit has dogged interest, from
ancient Athens to modern Islamabad. Like profit, interest is not a gift but
a quid pro quo: The lender earns interest in exchange for delaying his
consumption. A government that successfully stamped out interest payments
would be no friend to those in need of credit, since that policy would crush
lending as well.

Anti-market biases lead people to misunderstand and reject even policies
they should, given their preferences for end results, support. For example,
the Princeton economist Alan Blinder blames opposition to tradable pollution
permits on anti-market bias. Why let people &quot;pay to pollute,&quot; when we can
force them to cease and desist?

The textbook answer is that tradable permits get you more pollution
abatement for the same cost. The firms able to cut their emissions cheaply
do so, selling their excess pollution quotas to less flexible polluters. End
result: more abatement bang for your buck. But noneconomists, including
relatively sophisticated policy insiders, disagree. In his 1987 book *Hard
Heads, Soft Hearts*, Blinder discusses a fascinating survey of 63
environmentalists, congressional staffers, and industry lobbyists. Not one
could explain economists' standard rationale for tradable permits.

The second most prominent avatar of anti-market bias is monopoly theories of
price. Economists acknowledge that monopolies exist. But the public
habitually makes monopoly a scapegoat for scarcity. The idea that supply and
demand usually control prices is hard to accept. Even in industries with
many firms, noneconomists treat prices as a function of CEO intentions and
conspiracies.

Historically, it has been especially common for the public to pick out
middlemen as uniquely vicious &quot;monopolists.&quot; Look at these parasites: They
buy products, &quot;mark them up,&quot; and then resell us the &quot;exact same thing.&quot;
Economists have a standard response. Transportation, storage, and
distribution are valuable services—a fact that becomes obvious whenever you
need a cold drink in the middle of nowhere. Like most valuable services,
they are not costless. The most that is reasonable to ask, then, is not that
middlemen work for free, but that they face the daily test of competition.

One specific price, the price for labor, is often thought to be the result
of conspiracy: capitalists joining forces to keep wages at the subsistence
level. More literate defenders of this fallacy point out that Adam Smith
himself worried about employer conspiracies, overlooking the fact that in
Smith's time high transportation and communication costs left workers with
far fewer alternative employers.

In the Third World, of course, the number of employment options is often
substantially lower than in developed countries. But if there really were a
vast employer conspiracy to hold down wages, the Third World would be an
especially profitable place to invest. Query: Does investing your life
savings in poor countries seem like a painless way to get rich quick? If
not, you at least tacitly accept economists' sad-but-true theory of Third
World poverty: Its workers earn low wages because their productivity is low,
due partly to lower skill levels and partly to anti-growth public policies.

Collusion aside, the public's implicit model of price determination is that
businesses are monopolists of variable altruism. If a CEO feels greedy when
he wakes up, he raises his price—or puts low-quality merchandise on the
shelves. Nice guys charge fair prices for good products; greedy scoundrels
gouge with impunity for junk. It is only a short step for market skeptics to
add &quot;…and nice guys finish last.&quot;

Where does the public go wrong? For one thing, asking for more can get you
less. Giving your boss the ultimatum &quot;Double my pay or I quit&quot; usually ends
badly. The same holds in business: Raising prices and cutting quality often
lead to lower profits, not higher. Many strategies that work as a one-shot
scam backfire as routine policies. It is hard to make a profit if no one
sets foot in your store twice. Intelligent greed militates against
dishonesty and discourtesy because they damage the seller's reputation.

An outsider who eavesdrops on economists' discussions might get the
impression that the benefits of markets remain controversial. But economists
who debate certain issues about the perfection of markets are *not *debating,
say, whether prices give incentives. Almost all economists recognize the
core benefits of the market mechanism; they disagree only at the margin.
Widespread bias against market mechanisms as reasonably efficient means of
meeting human needs affects politicians' incentives in almost every decision
they make. It is perhaps most relevant today in the debate over whether the
American health care system needs more markets and choice or more central
control.

*Anti-Foreign Bias
*A shrewd businessman I know has long thought that everything wrong in the
American economy could be solved with two expedients: 1) a naval blockade of
Japan, and 2) a Berlin Wall at the Mexican border.

Like most noneconomists, he suffers from anti-foreign bias, a tendency to
underestimate the economic benefits of interaction with foreigners. Popular
metaphors equate international trade with racing and warfare, so you might
say that anti-foreign views are embedded in our language. Perhaps foreigners
are sneakier, craftier, or greedier. Whatever the reason, they supposedly
have a special power to exploit us.

There is probably no other popular opinion that economists have found so
enduringly objectionable. In *The Wealth of Nations*, Adam Smith admonishes
his countrymen: &quot;What is prudence in the conduct of every private family,
can scarce be folly in a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us
with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of
them with some part of the produce of our own industry.&quot;

As far as his peers were concerned, Smith's arguments won the day. More than
a century later, Simon Newcomb could securely observe in the *Quarterly
Journal of Economics* that &quot;one of the most marked points of antagonism
between the ideas of the economists since Adam Smith and those which
governed the commercial policy of nations before his time is found in the
case of foreign trade.&quot; There was a little backsliding during the Great
Depression, but economists' pro-foreign views abide to this day.

Even theorists, such as Paul Krugman, who specialize in exceptions to the
optimality of free trade frequently downplay their findings as abstract
curiosities. As Krugman wrote in his 1996 book *Pop Internationalism*: &quot;This
innovative stuff is not a priority for today's undergraduates. In the last
decade of the 20th century, the essential things to teach students are still
the insights of Hume and Ricardo. That is, we need to teach them that trade
deficits are self-correcting and that the benefits of trade do not depend on
a country having an absolute advantage over its rivals.&quot;

Economics textbooks teach that total output increases if producers
specialize and trade. On an individual level, who could deny it? Imagine how
much time it would take to grow your own food, while a few hours' wages
spent at the grocery store can feed you for weeks. Analogies between
individual and social behavior are at times misleading, but this is not one
of those times. International trade is, as the economic writer Steven
Landsburg explains in his 1993 book *The Armchair Economist*, a technology:
&quot;There are two technologies for producing automobiles in America. One is to
manufacture them in Detroit, and the other is to grow them in Iowa.
Everybody knows about the first technology; let me tell you about the
second. First you plant seeds, which are the raw materials from which
automobiles are constructed. You wait a few months until wheat appears. Then
you harvest the wheat, load it onto ships, and sail the ships westward into
the Pacific Ocean. After a few months, the ships reappear with Toyotas on
them.&quot;

How can anyone overlook trade's remarkable benefits? Adam Smith, along with
many 18th- and 19th-century economists, identifies the root error as
misidentification of money and wealth: &quot;A rich country, in the same manner
as a rich man, is supposed to be a country abounding in money; and to heap
up gold and silver in any country is supposed to be the best way to enrich
it.&quot; It follows that trade is zero sum, since the only way for a country to
make its balance more favorable is to make another country's balance less
favorable.

Even in Smith's day, however, his story was probably too clever by half. The
root error behind 18th-century mercantilism was an unreasonable distrust of
foreigners. Otherwise, why would people focus on money draining out of &quot;the
nation&quot; but not &quot;the region,&quot; &quot;the city,&quot; &quot;the village,&quot; or &quot;the family&quot;?
Anyone who consistently equated money with wealth would fear *all* outflows
of precious metals. In practice, human beings then and now commit the
balance of trade fallacy only when other countries enter the picture. No one
loses sleep about the trade balance between California and Nevada, or me and
iTunes. The fallacy is not treating all purchases as a cost but treating *
foreign* purchases as a cost.

Anti-foreign bias is easier to spot nowadays. To take one prominent example,
immigration is far more of an issue now than it was in Smith's time.
Economists are predictably quick to see the benefits of immigration. Trade
in labor is roughly the same as trade in goods. Specialization and exchange
raise output—for instance, by letting skilled American moms return to work
by hiring Mexican nannies.

In terms of the balance of payments, immigration is a nonissue. If an
immigrant moves from Mexico City to New York and spends all his earnings in
his new homeland, the balance of trade does not change. Yet the public still
looks on immigration as a bald misfortune: jobs lost, wages reduced, public
services consumed. Many in the general public see immigration as a distinct
danger, independent of, and more frightening than, an unfavorable balance of
trade. People feel all the more vulnerable when they reflect that these
foreigners are not just selling us their products. *They live among us.*

It is misleading to think of &quot;foreignness&quot; as a simple either/or. From the
viewpoint of the typical American, Canadians are less foreign than the
British, who are in turn less foreign than the Japanese. From 1983 to 1987,
28 percent of Americans in the National Opinion Research Center's General
Social Survey admitted they disliked Japan, but only 8 percent disliked
England, and a scant 3 percent disliked Canada.

Objective measures like the volume of trade or the trade deficit are often
secondary to physical, linguistic, and cultural similarity. Trade with
Canada or Great Britain generates only mild alarm compared to trade with
Mexico or Japan. U.S. imports from and trade deficits with Canada exceeded
those with Mexico every year from 1985 to 2004. During the anti-Japan
hysteria of the 1980s, British foreign direct investment in the U.S. always
exceeded that of the Japanese by at least 50 percent. Foreigners who look
like us and speak English are hardly foreign at all.

Calm reflection on the international economy reveals much to be thankful for
and little to fear. On this point, economists past and present agree. But an
important proviso lurks beneath the surface. Yes, there is little to fear
about the international economy itself. But modern researchers rarely
mention that *attitudes* about the international economy are another story.
Paul Krugman hits the nail on the head: &quot;The conflict among nations that so
many policy intellectuals imagine prevails is an illusion; but it is an
illusion that can destroy the reality of mutual gains from trade.&quot; We can
see this today most vividly in the absurdly overblown political reactions to
the immigration issue, from walls to forcing illegal workers currently in
America to leave before they can begin an onerous procedure to gain paper
legality.

*Make-Work Bias
*I was an undergraduate when the Cold War ended. I still remember talking
about military spending cuts with a conservative student. The whole idea
made her nervous; she had no idea how a market economy would absorb the
discharged soldiers. In her mind, to lay off 100,000 government employees
was virtually equivalent to disemploying 100,000 people for life.

If a well-educated individual ideologically opposed to wasteful government
spending thinks like this, it is hardly surprising that she is not alone.
The public often literally believes that labor is better to use than
conserve. Saving labor, producing more goods with fewer man-hours, is widely
perceived not as progress but as a danger. I call this the make-work bias, a
tendency to underestimate the economic benefits of conserving labor. Where
noneconomists see the destruction of jobs, economists see the essence of
economic growth: the production of more with less.

Economists have been at war with the make-work bias for centuries. The
19th-century economist Frederic Bastiat ridiculed the equation of prosperity
with jobs as &quot;Sisyphism,&quot; after the mythological fully employed Greek who
was eternally condemned to roll a boulder up a hill.

In the eyes of the public, he wrote, &quot;effort itself constitutes and measures
wealth. To progress is to increase the *ratio of effort to result*. Its
ideal may be represented by the toil of Sisyphus, at once barren and
eternal.&quot; For the economist, by contrast, wealth &quot;increases proportionately
to the increase in the *ratio of result to effort*. Absolute perfection,
whose archetype is God, consists [of] a situation in which no effort at all
yields infinite results.&quot;

Nineteenth-century economists believed they had diagnosed enduring economic
confusions, not intellectual fads, and they were right. The crudest form of
make-work bias is the Luddite fear of the machine. Common sense proclaims
that machines make life easier for human beings. The public qualifies this
&quot;naive&quot; position by noting that machines also throw people out of work. It
forgets that technology also* creates *new jobs. Without the computer, to
give one obvious example, there would be no jobs in computer programming or
software development. But the fundamental defense of labor-saving technology
is deeper than that. Employing more workers than you need wastes valuable
labor.

After technology throws people out of work, they have an incentive to find a
new use for their talents. The Dallas Fed economist W. Michael Cox and the
journalist Richard Alm illustrate this process in their 1999 book *Myths of
Rich and Poor*, citing history's most striking example, the drastic decline
in agricultural employment: &quot;In 1800, it took nearly 95 of every 100
Americans to feed the country. In 1900, it took 40. Today, it takes just
3.…The workers no longer needed on farms have been put to use providing new
homes, furniture, clothing, computers, pharmaceuticals, appliances, medical
assistance, movies, financial advice, video games, gourmet meals, and an
almost dizzying array of other goods and services.&quot;

Many economists advocate government assistance to cushion the displaced
workers' transition to new jobs and to retain public support for a dynamic
economy. Other economists disagree. But almost all economists grant that
stopping those transitions has a grave cost.

Exasperating as the Luddite mentality is, countries rarely accede to public
anxieties and turn back the clock of technology. But you cannot say the same
about another controversy infused with make-work bias: hostility to
downsizing.

Inside of a household, everyone understands what Cox and Alm call &quot;the
upside of downsizing.&quot; You do not worry about how to spend the hours you
save when you buy a washing machine. Make-work confusion can arise only in
an exchange economy. If you receive a washing machine as a gift, the benefit
is yours; you have more free time and the same income. If you get downsized,
the benefit goes to other people; you have more free time, but your income
temporarily falls. In both cases, though, society conserves valuable labor.

The danger of the make-work bias is easiest to see in Europe, where labor
market regulation to &quot;save jobs&quot; has produced decades of high unemployment.
But we can see it in the U.S. as well, especially in our massive employment
lawsuit industry. The hard lesson to learn is that giving people &quot;rights to
their jobs&quot; is a drain on productivity—and makes employers think twice about
hiring people in the first place.

*Pessimistic Bias
*I first encountered anti-drug propaganda in second grade. It was called
&quot;drug education,&quot; but it was mostly scary stories. I was told that kids
around me were using drugs and that a pusher would soon offer me some too.
Teachers warned that more and more kids would become addicts, and that by
the time I was in junior high I would be surrounded by them. Authority
figures would occasionally speculate about our adulthood, and wonder how a
country could function with such a degenerate work force.

I am still waiting to be offered drugs. The junior high dystopia never
materialized. By the time I reached adulthood, it was apparent that most
people were not going to their jobs high on PCP. Generation X's entry into
the work force accompanied the marvels of the Internet age, not a
stupor-induced decline in productivity and innovation.

My teachers' predictions about America's economic future fit nicely into a
larger pattern. As a general rule, the public believes economic conditions
are not as good as they really are. It sees a world going from bad to worse;
the economy faces a long list of grim challenges, leaving little room for
hope. We can call this the pessimistic bias, a tendency to overestimate the
severity of economic problems and underestimate the economy's performance in
the recent past, the present, and the future.

Pessimism about the economy comes in two varieties. You may be pessimistic
about symptoms, overblowing the severity of the effects of everything from
the deficit to affirmative action. But you can also be pessimistic overall,
seeing negative trends in living standards, wages, and inequality. Public
opinion is marked by both forms of pessimism. Economists constantly advise
the public not to lose sleep over the latest economic threat in the news,
pointing out massive gains we've made during the last 100 years and now take
for granted.

David Hume—economist, philosopher, and Adam Smith's best friend—blamed
popular pessimism on our psychology. &quot;The humour of blaming the present, and
admiring the past, is strongly rooted in human nature,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and has
an influence even on persons endued with the profoundest judgment and most
extensive learning.&quot;

But 19th-century economists did little to develop the theme of pessimistic
bias. Nineteenth-century socialists who predicted &quot;immiseration&quot; of the
working class met intellectual resistance from economists. But the root of
the socialists' forecast was hostility to markets, not pessimism as such.
Economists often ridiculed socialists for their wild *optimism* about the
impending socialist utopia.

Pessimistic bias is widely thought to have grown worse in the modern era. In
*The Idea of Decline in Western History* (1997), the historian Arthur Herman
of the Smithsonian Institution maintains that it peaked soon after the end
of World War I, when &quot;talking about the end of Western civilization had
become as natural as breathing. The only subject left to debate was not
whether the modern West was doomed but why.&quot;

How can high levels of pessimism coexist with constantly rising standards of
living? Although pessimism has abated since World War I, the gap between
objective conditions and subjective perceptions is arguably greater than
ever. In *The Progress Paradox* (2003), the journalist Gregg Easterbrook
ridicules the &quot;abundance denial&quot; of the developed world: &quot;Our forebears, who
worked and sacrificed tirelessly in the hopes their descendants would
someday be free, comfortable, healthy, and educated, might be dismayed to
observe how acidly we deny we now are these things.&quot;

Not all professional economists are utter optimists about tomorrow. There is
an ongoing debate among economists about growth slow-down. This is what
relatively pessimistic economists like Paul Krugman mean when they say that
&quot;the U.S. economy is doing badly.&quot; Other economists counter that standard
numbers inadequately adjust for the rising quality and variety of the
consumption basket and the changing composition of the work force. Either
way, the worst-case scenario that GDP statistics permit—a lower speed of
progress—is no disaster.

The intelligent pessimist's favorite refuge is to argue that standard
statistics such as GDP miss important components of our standard of living.
The leading candidate is environmental quality. Pessimists often add that
our failure to deal with environmental destruction will soon morph into
economic disaster as well. If resources are rapidly vanishing as our numbers
multiply, human beings are going to be poor and hungry, not just out of
touch with Mother Earth.

A number of economists have met these challenges. The most wide-ranging is
the late Julian Simon, who argued that popular &quot;doom-and-gloom&quot; views of
resource depletion, overpopulation, and environmental quality are
exaggerated and often the opposite of the truth. Past progress does not
guarantee future progress, but as Simon explained in his 1995 book *The
State of Humanity*, it does create a strong presumption: &quot;Throughout the
long sweep of history, forecasts of resource scarcity have always been
heard, and—just as now—the doomsayers have always claimed that the past was
no guide to the future because they stood at a turning point in history.&quot;

Simon has been a lightning rod for controversy, but his main theses—that
natural resources are getting cheaper, population density is not bad for
growth, and air quality is improving—are now almost mainstream in
environmental economics. Since the Harvard economist Michael Kremer's
seminal 1993 paper &quot;Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million
B.C. to 1990,&quot; even Simon's &quot;extreme&quot; view that population growth raises
living standards has gained wide acceptance.

The UCLA geographer Jared Diamond's immensely popular 1997 book *Guns,
Germs, and Steel* links population and innovation in essentially the same
way, albeit with little fanfare. The upshot: GDP may not be the best
conceivable measurement of our well-being, but refining measures of economic
welfare does not revive the case for pessimism. In fact, more inclusive
measures cement the case for optimism, because life has also been getting
better on the neglected dimensions.

This pessimistic bias is a general-interest prop to political demagoguery of
all kinds. It creates a presumption that matters, left uncontrolled, are
spiraling to destruction, and that *something* has to be done, no matter how
costly or ultimately counterproductive to wealth or freedom. This mind-set
plays a role in almost every modern political controversy, from downsizing
to immigration to global warming.

*Bias Against Bias
*Economists have a love-hate relationship with systematic bias. As
theorists, they deny its existence. But when they teach, address the public,
or wonder what is wrong with the world, they dip into their own private
stash of the stuff. On some level, economists not only recognize that
systematically biased beliefs exist; they think they have discovered
virulent strains in their own backyard.

You can hardly teach economics without bumping into these biases. Students
of economics are not blank slates for their teachers to write on. They
arrive with strong prejudices. They underestimate the benefits of markets.
They underestimate the benefits of dealing with foreigners. They
underestimate the benefits of conserving labor. They underestimate the
performance of the economy. And in doing all that underestimating, they
overestimate both the need for the government to solve these purported
problems and the likely efficacy of its solutions.
