What We Owe Our Parasites

Dr. Oliver delivered this address to a German-American group assembled at
the Lorelei Club in Hamburg, New York, near Buffalo, on 9th June, 1968.
The typescript was lost in a flood in 1990 at Dr. Oliver's home, but has
been restored by your editor to printed form based upon the original tape
recording made by Mr. Everett Weibert. Any errors introduced in the article
are of course the editor's and not Dr. Oliver's.
This is one of Dr. Oliver's finest speeches, and is certainly his most
comprehensive short work. It appears here in printed form for the first
time.-Kevin Alfred Strom.
by Dr. Revilo P. Oliver
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, let me thank you first of all for the honor of your
invitation and the pleasure of being with you today. In the past dozen years
I have spoken before a great many conservative and patriotic organizations,
but this is the first time that I have appeared before a society that is
specifically German: that is to say, composed of the descendants of the part
of our race that stayed home in the fifth century, while their kinsfolk
conquered and occupied all the western territories of the largely
mongrelized and moribund Roman Empire that their more remote kinsfolk had
founded more than a thousand years before.
As I understand it, I am speaking to a closed meeting of your members and of
guests in whom they have confidence. I believe that it is stipulated that
what is said here today is off the record and not for publication in any
form and that there are no reporters present. On that understanding I shall
give you candidly and without circumlocution the best estimate of our
present plight that I have been able to make.
Some of you may remember the old story about the college girl who went to
bed one night, and finally dropped off to sleep, but in the early hours of
the morning she heard the clock strike two and she felt the door of her room
was slowly opening. Terrified, she tried to call out in the darkness, but a
handkerchief was whipped over her mouth and she felt strong arms lift her
from the bed. She was carried downstairs, thrown into the tonneau of a large
and luxurious Rolls-Royce that set off at high speed. After a long ride she
was lifted out and carried into the large hall of a vast and palatial
mansion, up marble stairs, and into an elegantly appointed room, where she
was thrown on the bed. Only then did she see her captor clearly. He was a
strong and handsome man attired in faultless evening dress. He stood by the
bed, looking down at her speculatively and silently. She tried to speak, and
at last she was able to say whimperingly, &quot;What, oh, what are you going to
do to me?&quot; The man shrugged his shoulders. &quot;How should I know?&quot; he said.
&quot;This is your dream.&quot;
The story is absurd, of course, but it owes what little humor it possesses
to its equivocal play on the mystery of our own consciousness. A dream is by
definition a series of sensations that occur in the brain when both our
senses of perception and our powers of will and reason are in abeyance, so
that we have no control over that flux of sensations. But it is, of course,
a well-known phenomenon that when we dream that we are dreaming, the dream
ends and we awaken. Then the conscious mind takes over and we are again
responsible for our thoughts, and must face a day in which we must be
responsible for our actions, which, by their wisdom or folly, may determine
the rest of our lives. Our dreams may give expression, pleasant or painful,
to our subconscious desires or fears. But in our waking hours we must, if we
are rational, make our decisions on the basis of the most objective and
cold-blooded estimates that we can make: estimates of the forces and
tendencies in the world about us; estimates of the realities with which we
must deal; remembering always that nothing is likely to happen just because
we think it's good, or unlikely to happen just because we think it's evil.
If ever we have had need to appraise carefully and rationally our position
and prospects, the time is now. In the outer quadrangle of Brasenose at
Oxford, if I remember correctly, there is in the middle of the green sward a
solitary sundial, whose bronze plate bears the chilling inscription, It is
later than you think. I assure you, my fellow Americans, that it is now
later-much later-than you think. It is possible, of course, that it may now
be too late and that, as a veteran observer and distinguished friend of mine
recently assured me, our cause is now as hopeless as was that of the South
after the fall of Richmond and near the tragic conclusion of the second war
for independence which was fought on our soil. I honestly believe, however,
we still have some chance of survival. If I did not believe that, I
certainly would not be speaking to you today or asking you to consider with
me the odds against us.
I may be wrong. I have no powers of divination, nor of prophecy. And I
certainly do not know the secret plans of our enemies, or even the inner
structure of their organization. I can only guess the probable extent of
their power and the probable efficacy of their strategy by extrapolation
from what they have thus far accomplished. I can only give you my best
estimate, made after long and anxious consideration; but I do not pose as an
expert in these matters, and since I have promised to be candid, I will tell
you candidly that my estimates in the past proved to be overly optimistic.
When I left the mephitic atmosphere of Washington late in 1945, I had no
great misgivings about the future of our nation. On the basis of the best
estimates that I could then make, I was confident that our future was
assured by a popular reaction which I deemed inevitable within the next five
years. I felt certain that the secrets of Washington would quickly become
known and that our nation would be swept with moral indignation and
revulsion when Americans saw exposed to the light of day even a small part
of the foul record of the diseased creature that had squatted in the White
House for so many years, surrounded by his appalling gang of degenerates,
traitors, and alien subversives.
I knew that the secret of Pearl Harbor would be quickly disclosed, and that
Americans would soon know how the Japanese had been maneuvered and tricked
into destroying our fleet and killing so many of our men. I was sure that
the public would soon learn of the old conspiracy between Roosevelt and
Churchill (who was at that time a private citizen in what was still Great
Britain), and also of Roosevelt's persistent efforts from 1936 to 1939 to
get started in Europe the insanely fratricidal war that devastated that
continent, that destroyed so much of what is the most precious and
irreplaceable treasure of any race-the genetic heritage of its best men-and
that inflicted on our own country a great squandering of life and wealth in
a war that was deliberately conducted to assure the defeat of the United
States and Great Britain no less than that of France and Germany. I was sure
that we would quickly, once peace had come, see that we had fought for the
sole purpose of imposing the beasts of Bolshevism on a devastated land. I
was sure that we would quickly see the nature of the great treason trap
called the United Nations. I thought that decent men's stomachs would turn
when they learned of the officially admitted strategy of the British
government which, in deliberate violation of all the conventions of
civilized warfare, had initiated the vicious bombing of unprotected German
cities for the express purpose of slaughtering so many defenseless German
civilians that the German government would be forced to bomb unprotected
British cities and slaughter enough helpless British civilians to work up in
Great Britain some enthusiasm for the suicidal war that the British
government was imposing on its reluctant people-the first example in
history, I believe, of a government at war deliberately having its own
citizens massacred for the purposes of propaganda. I thought that the truth
about such domestic outrages as the infamous Sedition Trial in Washington
would necessarily become known, and excite the feelings that such crimes
must excite in the breasts of decent men.
And I was sure that a thousand other infamies, unsurpassed and only rarely
equaled in recorded history, would be disclosed with the result that all the
steamships outward bound from our shores would, within a few years, be
crowded to their very rails with hordes of vermin desperately fleeing from
the wrath of an aroused and angry nation.
In 1945 I really believed that by the year 1952 no American could hear the
name of Roosevelt without a shudder or utter it without a curse. You see; I
was wrong. I was right about the inevitability of exposure. Like the bodies
of the Polish officers who were butchered in Katyn Forest by the Bolsheviks
(as we knew at the time), many of the Roosevelt regime's secret crimes were
exposed to the light of day. The exposures were neither so rapid or so
complete as I anticipated, but their aggregate is far more than should have
been needed for the anticipated reaction. Only about 80 per cent of the
secret of Pearl Harbor has thus far become known, but that 80 per cent
should in itself be enough to nauseate a healthy man. Of course I do not
know, and I may not even suspect, the full extent of the treason of that
incredible administration. But I should guess that at least half of it has
been disclosed in print somewhere: not necessarily in well-known sources,
but in books and articles in various languages, including publications that
the international conspiracy tries to keep from the public, and not
necessarily in the form of direct testimony, but at least in the form of
evidence from which any thinking man can draw the proper and inescapable
deductions. The information is there for those who will seek it, and enough
of it is fairly well known, fairly widely known, especially the Pearl Harbor
story, to suggest to anyone seriously interested in the preservation of his
country that he should learn more. But the reaction never occurred. And even
today the commonly used six-cent postage stamp bears the bloated and
sneering visage of the Great War Criminal, and one hears little protest from
the public. Why?
It is true that there were some faint and feeble beginnings of reaction,
especially when Senator Joseph McCarthy began his famous series of hearings
before the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. All that those hearings
produced was but a small trickle leaking through the vast dike of official
secrecy that held back the ocean of evidence that the United States had been
stealthily captured by aliens and by the traitors in their employ. But when
dikes begin to leak they soon break. And when the McCarthy hearings started,
only a little later than I had predicted, I said to myself, This is it at
last! This is the beginning. And soon will begin that great exodus of
panic-stricken rats fleeing from a just retribution.
But I was wrong again. Instead, a friend of mine was right. He was at that
time a member of the Central Intelligence Agency, which at that time
included some Americans. And he happened to be in Wheeling, West Virginia,
on the 9th of February, 1950, when Senator McCarthy made his famous speech
in which he stated that there were 57 members of the Communist Party or of
the Soviet espionage apparatus in the State Department in positions of
responsibility and that the State Department knew that they were there.
After the speech, my friend found an opportunity to talk to McCarthy alone.
He told him, &quot;Senator, you said there were 57 known Communists in the State
Department. If you had access to the files of my agency, you would know that
there is absolute proof that there are ten times that many. But Senator, you
do not realize the magnitude and the power of the conspiracy you are
attacking. They will destroy you-they will destroy you utterly.&quot;
But Senator McCarthy merely shook his head and said, &quot;No, the American
people will never let me down.&quot; He was wrong too, you see.
It's not necessary here to rehearse the steps by which McCarthy was
destroyed. He was of course sabotaged from within his own staff. The aliens
who control our press and radio and the boob tubes spattered their slime
over the country. Swarms of the ignorant and neurotic little shysters whom
we call &quot;intellectuals&quot; issued from the doors of the colleges and
universities, shrieking and spitting as is their wont. And all that had its
effect. But the conspiracy was able to silence McCarthy only by a somewhat
less routine operation.
They found an Army officer who had been a military failure until Bernard
Baruch promoted him to General, and who in 1945 should have been able to
hope for nothing better than that he could escape a court martial and thus
avoid being cashiered, if he could prove that all the atrocities and all the
sabotage of American interests of which he had been guilty in Europe had
been carried out over his protest and under categorical orders from the
President. The conspiracy took that person, and with the aid of their press
they did a quick masquerade job and dressed him up as a conservative. They
wrote speeches that he was able to deliver without too much bumbling. They
displayed his grin on all the boob tubes. And they elected him President.
And, of course, &quot;Ike&quot; was elected with a mandate from his masters to stab
Senator McCarthy in the back. And he did. And so the conspiracy plugged that
small leak in the dike.
But how was it able to do that? Oh yes, we could trace the whole operation
step by step. We know that our enemies are sneaking and cunning. We know
that they command the wealth of the world, including whatever is in the
United States Treasury and, through the income tax, whatever is in your
pocket and mine. They can hire stupid or unprincipled Americans to do
anything for them and to act as front men. But the real question before us
is not their cunning and their innate evil.
The deeper, more important, and far more unpleasant question is: What was
and is wrong with American people that made them and is still making them
willing victims of their enemies?
Some years ago, it was customary for fast-talking confidence men to find
some chump with five or ten thousand dollars in cash and sell him the
Brooklyn Bridge or the Holland Tunnel. And I hear that when the Pennsylvania
Railroad began to demolish its station in New York City, someone bought it
for $25,000 cash. Now the swindlers in all those cases are undoubtedly
wicked men. They deserve exemplary punishment. But, you know, there must
have been something wrong with the purchasers too. Much as we may sympathize
with them, we shall have to agree, I think, that they were not overly
bright.
We Americans, you know, are regarded with supreme contempt by our enemies,
who describe us in private and sometimes in public in the most contumelious
terms. You may remember that some years ago a man named Khrushchev was the
manager employed on the conspiracy's estate in Russia. He was invited to
this country by his pal Ike, and he toured our land, honored and applauded
by the press and even by some Americans. Soon after he returned, he told
newspaper reporters in Vienna, &quot;The Americans? Why, you spit in their faces
and they think it's dew.&quot;
That delicate phraseology reminded me of what I had been told by an
acquaintance in Washington during the Second World War. This man, a veteran
journalist, held a position of importance in one of the lie-factories
operated by the Roosevelt regime to keep the boobs pepped up with enthusiasm
for sending their sons or their husbands to a senseless slaughter. At one
policy conference, this man objected to a proposed lie on the grounds that
it was so absurd that it would destroy public confidence, with the result
that Americans would soon cease to believe anything that the agency
manufactured. There was a great deal of debate over that question in this
policy conference until it was ended by the agency's great expert in such
matters. He was a man who, by the way, for some reason or other, had left
Germany a few years before and come to bless the United States with his
presence. This expert, being a bit ruffled by the debate, finally took his
elegant little cigar from his mouth and said decisively, &quot;Ve spit in ze
faces of the American schwine!&quot; And that settled it. The master had spoken.
Why do we receive and deserve such contempt? Unless we have simply
degenerated into a race of imbeciles, unfit to survive in the world, there
must be some ascertainable mental block that makes us so gullible. And, if
so, we most urgently need to identify it. That's the real reason why I
brought up the question of Senator McCarthy and what may have seemed history
long past and otiose. That episode was obviously the antecedent of our
present terrible plight. And when we try to look back at the obvious
factors, such as the alien control of our channels of information and of our
finances, we know there must be something back of that. And then we look at
an obvious factor, of which many were made aware only recently by the
shocking behavior of so-called students in so-called universities and by the
far more shocking behavior of the administrative officers and faculties of
those diploma mills. We now see that the gang of sleazy racketeers headed by
John Dewey has attained its goal. We realize that the public schools have
been for many years a vast brainwashing and brain-contaminating machine that
has worked, on the whole, with great efficiency. It's a machine to which we
send our children to have their minds filled with grotesque and debasing
superstitions; to have their instincts of integrity and honor leached from
their souls; to be incited to premature debauchery and perversion; to be
imbued with thoughtless irresponsibility; and to be prepared for addiction
to mind-destroying drugs and an existence below the animal level. The public
schools have indeed been the most powerful single engine of subversion that
our enemies have used upon us. The rest of this hour would not suffice even
to enumerate the ways in which the self-styled &quot;educators&quot; have accomplished
their deadly work.
When we go back to the affair of Senator McCarthy and look for a deeper
cause, we can of course blame the schools, which were doing then, a little
less openly, the work that they are doing now. But that leaves us with the
question: Why did the American people fall for that racket? Why were they
gullible enough to be so easily taken in by John Dewey's hoax?
Well, let us go back to 1917, when Dewey's fraud had gained control of only
a relatively small area, and when the world was certainly a brighter and
more pleasant place. That brings us, of course, to the time of Woodrow
Wilson, another baleful figure in our history. I am not one of those who
regard Wilson as entirely a villain. I think he was primarily a man who
could intoxicate himself with his own words. And I think that he went
through most of his life mistaking his hallucinations for reality, as surely
as he did on that day in 1919 when he was driven in the early morning
through the deserted streets of Washington, mechanically raising his hat and
bowing to the applauding crowds that existed only in his feverish brain. I
am therefore willing to believe that he believed a good deal of what he
said. And although in his political life he was merely a marionette that
danced and pranced on the stage as its strings were pulled by Jacob Schiff,
Bernard Baruch, the Warburgs, and their agent Colonel House, the fact
remains that Wilson ranted to the American people about &quot;making the world
safe for democracy&quot; and &quot;a war to end wars,&quot; and they believed him. Instead
of calling a physician when he began to babble that arrant nonsense, they
let him plunge them into a war in which they had no conceivable concern and
to use the power of the United States to make the result of that war as
disastrous in the long run for Britain as it was for Germany.
Now I admit that the notion of a warless world is a pleasant and attractive
thought. But people who believe that there can be such a thing should ask it
of Santa Claus, in whom they doubtless also believe.
Let us go back to 1909, when the American people were offered a plan for
destroying nations that had been formulated again by a filthy degenerate
named Mordechai, alias Karl Marx. Now it's true that the promoters hired a
few journalists, liberal professors, and other intellectual prostitutes, to
prove conclusively that the proposed income tax could never under any
circumstances exceed four per cent. on the income of millionaires and could
never affect anyone else, for the obvious reason that no federal government
could possibly spend so much money. But the point is that a majority of the
American people-the inheritors of a free government based on the premise
that government must be limited to essentials and must be tied down by the
chains of a stringent constitution restraining the exercise of all powers
except those deemed absolutely necessary for national defense-those American
people believed that hogwash. In effect, what the promoters were telling
them in wheedling tones was, &quot;Come, little boobies, put your heads into the
noose and we'll do you lots of good.&quot; And the boobous little boobies stuck
their necks into the noose, and so the country is now under the regime of
the great White Slave Act, and that's why we are where we are today.
We could go much farther back, and if we had the time we certainly should go
back at least to the 18th century, when the weird mythology of what is now
called &quot;liberalism,&quot; and all of the basic lies that are rammed into the
minds of our children in the schools, were manufactured by a motley and
bizarre gang composed of agents of Weishaupt's great conspiracy, many
ordinary swindlers and mountebanks, and quite a bevy of &quot;idealists&quot; with
buzzing brains and twittering tongues. But I think that we have said enough
to see that we Americans are suffering from a chronic disease or tropism
that has invariably placed us at the mercy of our enemies by making us
incapable of taking thought for ourselves. There is in us a weakness,
perhaps a fatal weakness, that makes us not only listen to the babble of
self-professed do-gooders, but to do whatever they tell us to do, and to do
it as mindlessly as though we were in a hypnotic trance and had surrendered
our will to that of the hypnotist.
Now I believe that this strange weakness, unlike so many of our
peculiarities, is not a single congenital and hereditary idiocy. If that
were true, we would not be here: our remote ancestors would have been eaten
long before the dawn of history. It is compounded, it seems to me, of a
perversion of seven different qualities; a perversion effected and fostered
by certain misunderstandings in the peculiar circumstances that resulted
from the prosperity, power, and world dominion we of the West achieved for
ourselves and enjoyed in recent centuries. All of the seven elements of our
mentality that I shall enumerate are good qualities, at least in the sense
that they are born in us, that we could not eliminate them from our genetic
heritage if we wanted to, and that we have perforce to accept them. We could
comment at length on each of them, and it would be particularly interesting
to contrast ourselves with other races at each point. But I must list them
as briefly as possible, with only a word or two of explanation to make my
meaning clear.
The first is imagination, which is highly developed in us, and vivid; an
imagination which means, among other things, that we have a spiritual need
of a great literature: both a literature of vicarious experience and a
literature of the fantastic and marvellous that transcends the world of
reality. But this gift bears with it, of course, the danger that we may not
distinguish clearly between a vivid imagination and something that we can
actually see in the world.
Second, the sense of personal honor which is so strong in us, and seems so
fatuous and silly to other races. It is this, among other things, that gives
us the conception of an honorable contest when men of our race meet as
opponents in war. It gives us the knightly ethos that you see when Diomedes
and Glaucus meet on the plains of Troy and in all subsequent history and
story of our race. It also exposes us to the danger of behaving in knightly
fashion to those to whom those standards are lunacy.
The third is the capacity for objective and philosophical thought, which is
virtually limited to our race, and which enables us to put ourselves
mentally in the position of others, but simultaneously exposes us to the
risk of fancying that their thoughts and feelings are what ours would be.
The fourth is our capacity for compassion. We have a racial reluctance to
inflict unnecessary pain, and we are ourselves distressed by the sight of
suffering. That is, of course, a peculiarity that brings upon us the
ridicule and contempt of the numerical majority of the world's population,
who are beings differently constituted. The savages of Africa, who are now
your masters in the sense that you have to work for them every day, find the
spectacle of a human being under torture simply hilarious. And when they see
a blinded captive with broken limbs squirm as they prod him with red-hot
irons, they laugh with glee-with a merriment, a real merriment, that is
greater than the funniest farce on the stage has ever excited in you. You
may search the vast and respectable literature of China in vain for any
trace of compassion for suffering per se.
Fifth, our generosity, both as individuals and as a nation, which naturally
brings on us the contempt of those to whom we give abroad.
The capacity for self-sacrifice is sixth; and that is, of course, highly
developed in us, but it is a necessary basis for the existence of any
civilized society. No people above the stage of unthinking savagery can
survive in this world without some instinct or some belief which makes its
young men give their lives for the preservation of the society in which they
were born.
And the seventh and last is the sentiment of religion, which of course is
common to all mankind, although here again it takes a distinctive form in
us. For fifteen centuries the religion of the Western world has been
Christianity, Western Christianity, and there is no other religion now known
or even imaginable that could take its place. But it is simply an historical
fact, which we must deplore but cannot change, that only a small part of our
population today, 12 or 15 per cent., really believes that Christ was the
son of God, that the soul is immortal, and that our sins will be punished in
a future life. That means that the religious instinct, which is a part of
our nature, finds in the majority of our people no satisfaction in an
unquestioning faith; so that those frustrated instincts are available for
exploitation by any halfway clever scoundrel, as the shysters and punks who
now occupy the majority of our pulpits well know. When faith is lost, what
Pareto calls the religious residue in a people becomes its most vulnerable
point, its Achilles heel. It is the unsatisfied need for an unquestioning
faith in a superior power.
Now, a perversion of all of these qualities in us operated during the
centuries of our dominance to give us an utterly false conception of other
peoples. We have imagined that by some magic we could convey to them not
only our material possessions, but the qualities of our mind and soul.
And we have always succumbed to the flattery of imitation. The capacity for
imitating behavior is common not only to all human beings, but to all
anthropoids, as we all know from the proverbial expression, &quot;monkey see,
monkey do.&quot; An ape's ability to imitate is, of course, limited. But, with
the exception of the Australoids, other races have the capacity to imitate
us convincingly in externals. If they dress in our clothes, observe our
social conventions, and speak our language, using the phrases which as they
can learn by observation please us, and using those phrases even if they don't
understand them or if they regard them as preposterous drivel and nonsense,
the members of other races could imitate us so plausibly that we believe
them converted to our mentality and to our conception of life. And any
shortcomings that we may notice in the performance of the imitator, we
generously overlook or regard as endearing naivete.
This capacity for imitation is possessed by savages, at least by the more
intelligent ones, and it has deceived us time after time. The British are as
gullible as we are. Hundreds and hundreds of times, at least, they gave
scholarships to Blacks from Basutoland or Kenya or Nigeria or one of their
other possessions, and the result was almost always the same. With the money
given him, the savage bought himself a good wardrobe, attended an English
school, learned to play soccer, attended Oxford, wrote a charming essay on
Wordsworth or on ancient law, copulated with half-witted English women who
thought him &quot;romantic&quot; and themselves &quot;broad-minded,&quot; and when he got tired
of living on English generosity, went home to his tribe where he had a
well-roasted baby served up to him as a delicacy of which he had been long
deprived by the stupid prejudices of the stupid British.
With some of the highly intelligent Oriental peoples, the capacity for
dissimulation goes much farther than that and approaches genius.
That strange and unique international people, the Jews, who for all the time
in which they are known to history have lived and flourished by planting
their colonies in other people's countries, have owed much of their success
to the chameleon-like ability to take on, when they choose, the manners and
attitudes of whatever country they choose to reside in. They are a highly
intelligent people, quite possibly much more intelligent than we are. But
all observers, notably Douglas Reed and Roderick Stohlheim, have commented
on the Jews' amazing ability to seem a German in Berlin, a Czech in Prague,
an Italian in Rome, and an Englishman in London, shifting from one role to
the other with the ease with which a man might change his suit of clothes.
The Jews have, of course, the great advantage that their skins are white,
and that many of them resemble, in features, members of our race, even to
the point of being indistinguishable, at least to an untrained eye, and
including persons with such non-Oriental characteristics as blond or red
hair.
I am not sure, therefore, that the highest talent for dissimulation does not
belong to a people that does not have that very great physical advantage:
the Japanese. Their ability to gain our confidence and appropriate our
technology and science is simply phenomenal, as is obvious from what they,
living crowded together on a few poor islands, have accomplished. But their
talent for dissimulation is equally great.
I always remember the experience of a friend of mine, who was in the late
1930s a professor of chemistry in a large university in what may be called a
strategic area of this country. The outstanding students in his graduate
classes were four young Japanese. And partly because they were so apt in
learning the more abstruse forms of chemistry, and partly because they were
foreigners and so excited in him the generosity that is normal to us, he
invited them to his home; and in the course of three years he came, he
thought, to know them very well personally. Their manners and their English
were excellent. They professed the greatest admiration for America and its
institutions. They spoke, of course, of &quot;democracy&quot; in terms of high praise.
They deplored &quot;militarism,&quot; and they fervently hoped for &quot;world peace&quot; and
&quot;understanding among all peoples.&quot; My friend was convinced that if only we
could bring more young men like that to the United States, the policy of
Japan would eventually change, and the two nations would live thenceforth in
perpetual amity.
Then one day he found himself alone at a crossroads in the open country some
twenty miles from the university, waiting for some friends to pick him up in
their automobile. They were late, and since the day was hot, he went to a
nearby orchard to repose in the shadow of the trees while waiting. He saw
his four Japanese students come sauntering down one of the roads, evidently
out on a leisurely hike. At the crossroads, they stopped, looked up and down
each road, looked around and saw no one. Then they straightened up and stood
back to back, each facing in one direction, produced a Leica camera, and
photographed each road and then the surroundings on each diagonal and made
notations on a map. They had, of course, come to our country not only to
learn our chemical science for eventual use against us, but also
incidentally to map out the territory around the university for future
reference, should their army have occasion to invade us or should they have
occasion to land a secret force on our shores. And they went about their
work with the patient thoroughness of their race, doubtless chuckling
inwardly at the naivete of the big White boobies who freely deliver all
their hard-won knowledge to their natural enemies.
Our minds have been beclouded by an even more dangerous misconception long
annexed to our religion. For centuries we have labored under the illusion
that Western Christianity was something that could be exported, and only
recent events have at last made it obvious to us how vain and futile have
been the labors and zeal of devoted missionaries for five centuries. When
Cortez and his small but valiant band of iron men conquered the empire of
the Aztecs, he was immediately followed by a train of earnest and devoted
missionaries, chiefly Franciscans, who began to preach the Christian gospel
to the natives. And they soon sent back home, with innocent enthusiasm,
glowing accounts of the conversions they had effected. You can feel their
sincerity, their piety, their ardor, and their joy in the pages of Father
Sagun, Father Torquemada, and many others. And for their sake I am glad that
the poor Franciscans never suspected how small a part they had really played
in the religious conversions that gave them such joy. Far more effective
than their words and their book had been the Spanish cannon that had
breached the Aztec defenses and the ruthless Spanish soldiers who had slain
the Aztec priests at their altars and toppled the Aztec idols from the
sacrificial pyramids. The Aztecs accepted Christianity as a cult, not
because their hearts were touched by doctrines of love and mercy, but
because Christianity was the religion of the White men whose bronze cannon
and mail-clad warriors made them invincible.
That was early in the 16th century, and we of the West have gone on
repeating that fond mistake ever since, as the missionaries whom we sent to
all parts of the world wrote home with innocent satisfaction glowing
accounts of the number of hearts they had &quot;won for Christ.&quot; And it is only
after the international conspiracy's campaign of &quot;anti-colonialism&quot; really
got underway that most of us realized that what had won all those hearts was
primarily the discipline of British regiments and the power of the White
man. On many a shore of Africa, for example, missionaries eager to win souls
ventured to land alone; and the natives, after having a lot of fun torturing
them to death, ate them-either cooked or raw, according to the local custom.
What often happened was that a few months later a British cruiser hove to
offshore, and lobbed a half a dozen 4.5-inch high explosive shells into the
native village, and, if not in a hurry, perhaps landed half a company of
marines to beat the bushes and drag out a dozen or so savages to hang on
convenient trees. Unless the tribe was excessively stupid, they took the
hint. The next bevy of missionaries was respected, as somehow representing
the god of thunder and lightning. And if those men of God distributed enough
free rice and medical care with their sermons, they were able to make many
converts. They could teach a ritual, and they could perhaps inculcate a
superstition that had some superficial resemblance to their religion; but as
for teaching the spiritual substance of Christianity, they might as well
have followed the example of St. Francis and delivered sermons to the birds.
Although it is true that in some places in the former colonial possessions
missionaries are still tolerated, if they pay very well, we have at last
learned that the gospel follows the British regiments in the White man's
ignominious and insane retreat from the world that was his.
All of these factors have contributed, I think, to our strange toleration of
the &quot;do-gooder&quot; and our incredible obtuseness in never asking against whom
he is &quot;doing good.&quot; For it is unfortunately true that fully 80 per cent. of
all those high-sounding projects of &quot;uplift&quot; and &quot;social justice&quot; are
motivated not by concern for the supposed beneficiaries, but by greed or
malice. But we never ask.
That is why we have so many &quot;intellectuals&quot; battening upon us. They have
discovered the safest and most profitable of all rackets. An &quot;intellectual&quot;
is distinguished by two talents: a glib proficiency with words, and very
sensitive nostrils. He can smell a twenty dollar bill in your pocket a block
away, and within two minutes after that delicious aroma reaches his nostrils
the &quot;ideals&quot; are drooling down his jaw. You know the jargon: &quot;the
underprivileged&quot;; &quot;equality of opportunity&quot;; &quot;Athe culturally deprived&quot;;
&quot;underdeveloped nations&quot;; &quot;emerging peoples&quot;; and the like, ad infinitum
nauseam. And as you listen to his sing-song the chances are you won't even
notice his hand as it goes into your pocket.
Now we may be rich enough to be suckers, but we cannot afford the more
elaborate kinds of &quot;do-gooding&quot; that are inspired by malice and hatred. But
yet we tolerate them with a collective masochism that is simply suicidal. We
have accepted an incredible inversion of values to the point that we have
declared ourselves to be an inferior species, fit only to be enslaved,
beaten, and butchered at the whim of our betters. That is what the
proposition amounts to, although, of course, it is daubed over with the
viscid slobber of humanitarian drivel devised by our enemies and mindlessly
multiplied by our own sniveling sentimentalists.
It is not a new thing. If I had time, I would direct your attention in some
detail to the vast and irreparable calamity brought upon our nation in the
last century by a tiny group of vociferous and crazed fanatics, the
abolitionists, who forced upon the South its tragic war for independence. I
am not defending slavery, Negro slavery, as an institution. I believe that
Jefferson and Lincoln were right in regarding it as a system that was
pernicious, for quite rational reasons, of which the most important were:
first, that it maintained on our soil millions of persons of a race
radically different from our own, and by our standards inferior; and second,
that it resulted in some production of mongrels, pitiable creatures torn
apart by the incompatible instincts they had inherited. As you know, it was
the firm purpose of Abraham Lincoln to have all the Negroes either returned
to Africa, or, in the interests of economy, to Central America. But the
abolitionists were not rational. They were, I am sorry to say, most of them
Americans, including such persons as Wendell Phillips, Professor Elizur
Wright, and, of course, hysterical females such as Lydia Child and Harriet
Beecher Stowe. Their leader was William Lloyd Garrison, who was an American
too, though he was financed by Isaac Mack and other Jews. They were a tiny
group, despised by sane Americans, North and South. But they ranted and
raved until they got their way. They began to agitate in 1840 for
dissolution of the American union, and for division of the United States, by
secession, into two countries. And after twenty years of ranting, they
finally persuaded the states of the South to take their proposal seriously.
It is most instructive to read the abolitionists. They spout quotations from
the Bible, and they babble about &quot;human rights&quot; and &quot;equality.&quot; But they
cannot completely conceal their real animus and inspiration. Their venom is
directed against the plantation owners of the South, most of whom, though by
no means all, were ladies and gentlemen. The abolitionists had in their
minds a picture, partly correct, of the Southern landowner as man far
superior to themselves in education, culture, and humanity. And for that
they hated him, implacably. They also had in their feverish minds a picture,
totally false, of the planter as a man of unbounded wealth and leisure who
spent his life lolling on a wide veranda and sipping mint juleps. And they
envied him passionately. They had a picture, equally false, of the Southern
lady as one who spent her days in fairy-like ease, waited on hand and foot
by obsequious slaves. They had a picture, largely correct, of those women as
being accorded by men a chivalrous respect that was almost unknown in the
North. And so they yearned to humiliate and destroy that Southern lady. That
was the real inspiration of their frantic &quot;do-gooding.&quot;
You can take the true measure of what has happened to our national mentality
by just remembering the name of that distinguished horse thief and homicidal
manic, John Brown, who, financed by a conspiratorial group that called
themselves the Secret Six, was sent into the South to start a slave revolt.
As everyone admits, his purpose was to get all the White women of the South
raped and butchered, and to get all the White men of the South barbarously
mutilated and butchered. What does that make of him in contemporary opinion?
Why, he was a &quot;champion of human rights,&quot; &quot;a martyr of freedom,&quot; and all
that. He wanted to butcher, it's true, but to butcher White men and women.
That is to say, White slime, like ourselves, as we wallow in ecstasies of
self-abasement and self-hatred. And that suffices to make him admirable, to
make him noble. And so his soul goes marching on-over the hot coals, I hope.
I remind you that that little body of howling dervishes brought on us a
terribly fratricidal war, inflicting on us an irreparable loss and
impoverishing our nation and race forever by destroying the genetic heritage
of our best men. And it also coarsened us morally, perhaps also irreparably.
For after the assassination of Lincoln, which they certainly contrived, our
hate-crazed &quot;do-gooders&quot; had their way. If there is any American who can
read the history of all the suffering wantonly inflicted on the White people
of the South during what is called &quot;Reconstruction&quot; without hanging his head
in shame and feeling through his whole being an anguished remorse, I can
only say that he is hard-hearted and sadistic beyond my understanding.
With that beginning, is it any wonder that we have reached today the point
at which frenzied hatred of us is the certain way of attaining our
veneration and our reverence? How the Americans have been taught to hate
themselves!
Chinese Communists attack and capture one of our naval vessels, which we,
perhaps by agreement between them and our enemies in Washington, refuse to
defend although we had ample warning of the attack. But who cares? They're
just White slime like us, born to work and die for their masters' pleasure.
Now of course if they had been something really choice and noble, such as a
mongrel syphilitic lousy homosexual Communist cannibal, why all of our
liberal punks would be out screaming and howling in our streets from dawn to
dusk and all night.
Every day, more and more of our young men are shipped to Vietnam and forced
to fight under conditions carefully contrived to ensure the maximum loss of
American life and to ensure eventual defeat. But let us overlook that. Let
us assume that it really is a war and that it is being honestly fought. What
is its professed purpose? To secure a naval or air base for the United
States? To conquer a colony for the United States? To protect our blood
brothers in Australia? Those would be rational purposes, although one might
debate the strategic necessity of that particular location. No. The
ostensible purpose, the declared purpose, is to save the prolific Orientals
of South Vietnam from the horrors of Communism. Never mind that that purpose
is transparent hypocrisy. Assume that it is sincere. What then?
We are Americans, White men of the West. And if we were sane, no truth would
be more obvious and unquestionable to us than the fact that, so far as we
are concerned, all the teeming population of Vietnam is not worth the life
of one American soldier. But if anyone suggests that, why everyone is
horrified: &quot;Are we not the world's slaves to be used for do-gooding? Who
cares about your son and mine-they're expendable.&quot;
Now at the instigation of the promoters of that slaughter in Vietnam for
political purposes, hordes of young punks come screaming from the doors of
our hoodlum-hatcheries (which for some reason are still called colleges),
and they protest the awful war in Vietnam. What are they protesting? The
useless death of a brother? Or of a former classmate, a White man? No, they
are yowling and yammering because some of the sweet Orientals in North
Vietnam get hurt sometimes. If only we could find some plausible way of
killing American boys without discomfort to the Orientals, those rabid
protestors would be perfectly happy.
The Jews, who, as I have said, are a highly intelligent people, and who with
perhaps five per cent. of our military resources knew how to finish in six
days a war against opponents far more numerous and formidable than the
Vietnamese, and who were intelligent enough to know that the only
justification for aggressive war is the territory that is conquered by it,
decided that it would be fun to kill some despised goyim on our ship the
Liberty, and they did so-with the result that the legislature of at least
one American state rushed them an official message of congratulations. Our
men were killed where we sent them, ostensibly in the service of our
country, killed while wearing our uniform and flying our flag. They were the
symbols of our nation. They would have been the visible embodiment of our
self-respect, if we had any. But who cares? They're just White slime like
us.
Down in Memphis, somebody shoots a Black automobile thief, noted Communist
agent, and bloodthirsty inciter of riots and revolution against us. What
happens? Half the White nitwits in this country snivel and sob and mourn,
saying tearfully, &quot;What a wonderful man he was. He wanted to kill White
slime like us. Wasn't that sweet, wasn't that noble, wasn't that saintly,
wasn't he just like Jesus?&quot;
One could go on for hours listing more examples. But I have said enough,
surely, to show you what is really the greatest single obstacle that we
face: the perverted collective masochism that has been incited in so many of
our people.
What I have been saying right now is not what I first intended to say to
you. I meditated, and prepared a discourse that was intended to show you
that we have passed the point of no return, and that we now face a future of
violence that can result only in our total subjection to the status of
livestock, or survival at the cost of great hardships, sacrifice, and loss
of life. I intended to speak at some length about Francis Parker Yockey and
his great book Imperium. It is a book which evidently has the power to give
to sound and healthy young Americans an inspiration and a purpose. And I
intended to comment on it as representing, probably, our only force that
will help us emerge from our present plight.
But after that, I had two telephone calls from men whose names you would
probably recognize. The patriotic movements in this country include some
phonies and a number of double agents, whose mission it is to see to it that
all patriotic endeavors are directed down blind alleys, where they must end
in frustration and discouragement. But I feel sure that neither man who
called me belonged to either of those groups. I feel convinced that they
were sincere and earnest. One of them spoke to me very solemnly about our
duty to protect and defend the people of Vietnam from the horrors of
Communism. The other, in the course of the conversation, spoke very
emphatically about our duty to give to the rest of the world an inspiring
example of the blessings of free enterprise-to the rest of the world, mind
you. We are obliged to give them a model they can follow. So I discarded the
discourse I had prepared and substituted this discussion, which has already
been both too long and too cursory.
For I am convinced that we shall never be able to think rationally about our
own survival until we have the courage to say, in our own minds: We are
Americans, White men of the West. This is our country because we took it
from the Indians. And we have an unquestionable right to this country so
long as we have the power and will to defend it.
What do we owe the nations of Western Europe and such nations as Australia
and South Africa? We owe them recognition of our blood relationship to the
men of our race who remained in the lands from which we came, and with whom
we have, to the extent that they recognize it, a common interest, since we
and they together form a race that is numerically a minority on this globe,
the rest of whose inhabitants hate us.
What do we owe the rest of the world? Nothing, absolutely nothing.
What are the &quot;civil rights&quot; that we owe our Negroes if they insist on having
them? A free ride to Africa.
What do we owe the self-chosen people? Ordinary courtesy and considerate
treatment so long as we are convinced that it is to our advantage to have a
cohesive body of 12 to 15 million aliens reside in our country and own a
large part of it.
What do we owe to the unspeakable gang that now rules us in Washington? A
fair trial.
Now all this, of course, is something that we can say only in our own minds
and in closed meetings. It is probably rash to say it even in such
assemblies as this, given the strange infatuation of the majority of our
people to which I have called your attention as being the greatest single
obstacle before us. Such statements are obviously not feasible as propaganda
or proclamations. Indeed, I greatly fear that for most of our people those
implanted &quot;humanitarian&quot; hallucinations are so deep and inveterate that they
can be broken, if at all, only by the terrible shock of physical suffering.
And that they will surely receive.
In the meantime, it will fall to you, if you do not intend to surrender, to
provide such leadership in your own circles and communities and to make such
preparations and take such actions as will advance our cause with due
consideration to prudence and strategy. I have said this to you because I am
firmly convinced that our future is hopeless indeed if we do not clearly see
in our own minds our own purposes. And that, I am certain, we can never do,
unless we can free our own minds from the constricting trammels of
&quot;humanitarian&quot; superstition and the counterfeit moral inhibitions that have
replaced true morality.
I trust that I have not shocked any of you. But I know that it is quite
possible that some of you may feel that what I have said is heartless and in
violation of our Christian duty to love everyone. If so, I can only say that
I am sorry and observe that you are much too good for this world. I know
that the prospect that I have suggested is grim and may well daunt a man. I
can only remind you of the most incontrovertibly true statement in the great
and prophetic work of Oswald Spengler: &quot;Glucklich wird niemand sein der
heute irgendwo in der Welt lebt.&quot; [No one in the world today can expect
happiness.] From that destiny there is no retreat, no escape. There is no
place to hide from the consequences of what we of the West have brought on
ourselves by our generous folly.
The only alternatives now are to fight or to whimper. But if you think that
you can escape, good-bye and good luck. To the rest of you I suggest that we
shall see our problem clearly when we say to ourselves:
We are Americans. This is our country. He who would take it from us, by
force or by stealth, is our enemy. And it is our purpose-nay, it is our duty
to our children and to their children and to our yet unborn posterity-it is
our duty to use all feasible means to destroy him.
