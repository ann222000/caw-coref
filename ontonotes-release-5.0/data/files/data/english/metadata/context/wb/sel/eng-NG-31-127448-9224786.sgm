Question about teaching History at BYU

I have seen article over the years about how Brigham Young University
in Utah tries to force everyone attending the school, everyone affiliated
with the school, and even any *roomates* of anyone connected with the
school to live in accordance with Mormon doctrine.  I also saw mention
in an article once of some faculty members being dismissed in a
disagreement with the university over the teaching of history.  This
got me to thinking...the version of history laid out in the Book of
Mormon differs pretty drastically from any history recorded outside
the Mormon church.  It doesn't just conflict with secular history,
most biblical literalists would have problems with it as well.  And
as far as the archeology and pre-Columbian written history of the
Americas...forget it.  So this leads me to ask the question:

What sort of history do they teach at BYU?  The Mormon version, or what
actually happened?  Do they have an archeology department, and if so,
do the faculty get a dispensation to be un-Mormon about things?  I know
they are supposed to have a respectable paleontology department, but
those guys should do fine as long as the school gives them free reign
regarding anything more than a few thousand years ago.

I don't know about the other stuff, but BYU-trained
archaeologists tend to be very good technical archaeologists. As
I remember from archie school some time ago, and paying some
attention since, BYU archaeologists deal with the evidence they
find in a scientific way, whether it conflicts with the BoM or not.

But that is a very general, and perhaps inadequate, view on my
part. I know some Mormons who take the BoM as absolute fact; and
in fact, a high school classmate of mine runs a magazine,
_Ancient American_, which looks for (and finds!) all sorts of
archaeological evidence to support the BoM's history.

It is crap. Some of it is racist crap. All of it is what your
worst nightmare of what Mormon archaeology might be.

But in my opinion, the _Ancient American_ approach is anathema to
real BYU archies.

I wonder what they teach about this:

The Mountain Meadow Massacre is a pretty nasty chapter in their
history. Do they mention it?

They finally &quot;apologized' for it recently.  Wasn't an &quot;apology&quot; since
they said Mormons don't apologize but it read that way.  No, they
don't ignore it.  I have seen mentions of it over the years.

Here's their course catalog:
http://saas.byu.edu/classSchedule/schedule.aspx?yearTerm=20075&amp;dept;=HIST
It mostly looks like pretty straight stuff, except for all the classes
on &quot;family history&quot;, which would only be important to Mormons.
I suspect that their regular history classes will be totally
standard and probably pretty high quality.

If they teach their version of ancient American history, it must be
in religion classes.

It is an interesting point, though. I know a Mormon who specializes
on ancient religious history, but he concentrates on the Middle East,
and
focuses almost entirely on things where Mormonism, mainstream
Christianity, and secular history are not in conflict.  He's actually
*extremely* knowledgeable.

More generally, I'm fascinated that some with fundamentalist religious
view are pretty intelligent, and therefore have no choice by to
compartmentalize their knowledge.  There is no better example
of this than Mormons.  By and large, they're the most down to
Earth people you'll ever meet: practical, industrious, trustworthy.
On the other hand they embrace a dogma that is only epsilon
less weird than Scientology.

The cult still refuses to modify their &quot;monument&quot; at the Mountain
Meadows Mormon Massacre site near Enterprise, Utah: that monument
mentions the slaughter but utterly fails to say WHO did the
killing and raping, let alone why. Attempts to be a real monument
there have been opposed by the cult.

I plan on making a series of YouTube videos on the subject.

The words &quot;being a&quot; dropped out of that sentence by mistake, if that
helps.

I like 'anacronyms.' Clearly it means making up false stories about
word origins which involve acronyms long before acronyms became
popular. E.g. For Use (of) Carnal Knowledge, Port Outboard Starboard
Home, etc.

Sorry for the nitpickering, but I had to google for &quot;SAHM&quot;. Neither of
the two Mormon women in my family are SAHM. The mother of my brother in
law, and one of her daughters, they are.
