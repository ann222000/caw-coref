Do the math: Costs of illegals outweigh benefits

By JED BABBIN
April 9, 2005

Sometimes the clearest-thinking people — even presidents — have a
blind spot. Why does President Bush fail again and again to deal with
the dangers to America that cross our borders on the shoulders of
illegal immigrants?

The president and his immigration allies argue that illegals benefit
our economy by doing jobs Americans won't, and at a low cost, that
makes agriculture and many urban domestic tasks affordable. Mr. Bush
wants to let illegal workers earn legal status under a temporary work
program, and he's about to enter a big political fight to get his
proposal passed. In that fight, Congress will consider a bunch of
lightweight proposals that have one common characteristic: They don't
do anything about the deadly problems illegal immigration creates in
health care, education and in terrorist infiltration.

Those who oppose effective action against illegal immigration insist
that our economy is dependent on their cheap labor, that they
contribute considerable tax revenue and that they are, at the very
least, a net benefit to our state economies. Which, apparently, is all
a lot of hooey.

According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, about 1.2
million illegal immigrants now reside in Texas, a 71 percent increase
since 1996. This month, FAIR reported, analysis of the latest Census
data indicates Texas' illegal immigrant population is costing the
state's taxpayers more than $4.7 billion per year for education,
medical care and incarceration. Even if the estimated tax
contributions of illegal immigrant workers are subtracted, net outlays
still amount to more than $3.7 billion per year. The annual fiscal
burden amounts to about $725 per Texas household headed by a
native-born resident. The claimed economic benefit from the illegals
can't come close to offsetting those costs.

An article in the Spring 2005 Journal of American Physicians and
Surgeons by Dr. Madeline Cosman shows that illegal immigrants are
bringing to America many diseases we had thought we were rid of.
Tuberculosis, which had virtually disappeared from America, is
reappearing in many states because some of the illegals — especially
some from Mexico — have the disease in a new drug-resistant strain
which is lethal for about 60 percent who contract it. Cosman says
other lethal diseases — Chagas disease and dengue fever — are
springing up, brought in by illegals from nations such as India,
Brazil and Mexico. Illegals are also bringing back polio, malaria,
leprosy and strains of hepatitis. But even that isn't the biggest
problem illegal immigrants bring us.

We mustn't think of all illegals the same way. They should be
separated into three categories: those who wish to escape the poverty
of their home country and make a new start in America; those who have
severe health problems and come here to take advantage of our welfare
and health care systems; and those who come here to kill Americans.
Since 9/11, we have made considerable strides in reducing the flow of
the first two categories, but very little progress in stopping the
third. One of the greatest threats we face — if not the single
greatest one — is terrorists coming across the border unimpeded and
bringing in virtually any weapon that they want. We're doing nothing
to stop it, said Wayne Simmons, who is a pretty fair judge of border
security. For about 20 years Simmons worked for South American drug
lords trying to get their shipments into America. His clients were
rather unsuccessful because Simmons, then an undercover CIA agent, was
giving them the kind of help they least wanted.

Simmons' counterparts — former agents of the KGB and other
intelligence services — are working against us, in the employ of the
drug lords and terrorists. For a price, they also run terrorist
infiltrations as well, smuggling terrorists and whatever weapons they
wish to bring, such as rocket launchers and plastic explosives. These
men won't scruple at the inevitable nuclear weapon.

Simmons believes the situation is desperate enough to justify
deploying great numbers of troops to seal the borders. Instead,
neither Bush nor Congress seems to have a taste for putting real
pressure on our least helpful neighbor — Mexico — to act effectively
against the drug and people smugglers. Mexico, and its utterly corrupt
president, have been Bush's blind spot since before he became
president. Vicente Fox has no interest in America other than as a
destination for the poverty-stricken, those in bad health and the
criminals Fox can export to the United States. When American citizens,
such as the so-far-law-abiding Minutemen, try to help stop the flow of
illegals into America, Fox threatens to use American courts to stop
them and Bush calls them vigilantes.

We need facts, not rhetoric. If the president wants illegal immigrant
workers to be welcomed and legalized, let him show how cheap labor
offsets the huge financial burdens on health, education and prison
systems. Let those such as Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, who want to
grant amnesty to illegals, disprove Dr. Cosman's study on the dangers
to America's health.

If we are serious about confronting these problems, before Congress
acts on any legislation the president needs to change his mind on this
threat to our security and our economy. Once he does, he needs to make
sure our neighbors get the message. Secretary of State Rice should
deliver a message to Mexico's Fox and Prime Minister Paul Martin of
Canada in clear and unmistakable terms: Unless you put the weight of
your government behind helping us protect our borders from terrorists,
forget any hope of cooperation from us on any other subject.

administration, is a contribution editor for The American Spectator

&quot;So, likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained, and by exciting jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld; and it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation) the interests of their own country without odium, sometimes even with popularity, gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a
commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation . . .

&quot;Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government . . . Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their interests.

&quot; . . . nothing is more essential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others should be excluded, and that in place of them just and amicable feelings toward all should be cultivated. The nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest.&quot;

-- President George Washington
