A sardar from Delhi had an old car which had run for over a 1,00,000
kilometres. He wanted to sell it, but was not getting a good price because
of its excess mileage.He approached a Madrasi friend of his and asked for
help.
The Madrasi gave him an address in Chennai (Madras) and asked him to visit a
mechanic there. The mechanic would adjust the meter so that it shows only
30,000 kilometres.
The sardar thanked him and left for Madras. For a few days,
the Madrasi didn't see the sardar. He assumed that the sardar would have
sold the car.
A few weeks later, the sardar came to see the Madrasi in the same car. The
Madrasi was surprised and asked - &quot;What happened? Why have you not sold your
car yet?&quot;
The sardar replied - &quot;Why should I? It has run for only 30,000 kilometres.&quot;

A sardar, a Madrasi and a Gujarati were waiting for a bus when a
dangerous-looking guy approached them. He suddenly pulled out a syringe with
blood inside it and said in a menacing tone - &quot;Give me all your valuables or
I'll pierce you with this needle. This contains AIDS infected blood!&quot; Our
friends were naturally alarmed - all except the sardar.

The Madrasi immediately gave away all his valuables. The Gujju bargained
with the stranger and gave away half of his belongings. The sardar, however,
was unfazed. He refused to part with his money. In anger and frustration,
the guy pricked the sardar with the needle and ran away.The alarmed Madrasi
and Gujju asked the sardar - &quot; How could you do this? Now you will get AIDS
surely!&quot; The sardar coolly replied - &quot; No! I won't! I am wearing a condom&quot;.

A young ventriloquist is touring North India and stops to entertain a
gathering in Punjab. He's going through his usual stupid sardar jokes
(similar to the ones in the Sirippu web site!), when a big burly sardar in
the audience stands up and says &quot;I've heard just about enough of your silly
sardar jokes; we aren't all stupid here in Punjab.&quot;

Flustered, the ventriloquist begins to apologize, when the big guy pipes up
&quot;You stay out of this mister, I'm talking to the stupid little fellow on
your knee!&quot;

Darla had applied for a job and when she returned home, her mother asked how
the interview went.

&quot;Pretty good, I think,&quot; replied Darla, &quot;but if I go to work there I won't
get a vacation until I'm married.&quot;

Her mother, of course, had never heard of such a thing. &quot;Is that what they
told you?&quot;

&quot;No&quot;, replied Darla, &quot;but right on the application it said 'vacation time
may not be taken until you've had your First Anniversary.'&quot;

Cop Lines

- &quot;Take your hands off the car, and I'll make your birth certificate a
worthless document.&quot;

- &quot;If you run, you'll only go to jail tired.&quot;

- &quot;Can you run faster than 1,200 feet per second? In case you didn't know,
that is the average speed of a 9 mm bullet fired from my gun.&quot;

- &quot;So you don't know how fast you were going. I guess that means I can write
anything I want on the ticket, huh?&quot;

- &quot;Warning! You want a warning? O.K., I'm warning you not to do that again
or I'll give you another ticket.&quot;

- &quot;The answer to this last question will determine whether you are drunk or
not. Was Mickey Mouse a cat or a dog?&quot;

- &quot;Fair? You want me to be fair? Listen, fair is a place where you go to
ride on rides, eat cotton candy, and step in monkey poop.&quot;

- &quot;Yeah, we have a quota. Two more tickets and my wife gets a toaster oven.&quot;

- &quot;Just how big were those two beers?&quot;

- &quot;No sir, we don't have quotas anymore. We used to have quotas, but now
we're allowed to write as many tickets as we want.&quot;

- &quot;I'm glad to hear the Chief of Police is a good personal friend of yours.
At least you know someone who can post your bail.&quot;

- &quot;In God we trust, all others are suspects.&quot;

An old prospector walks his tired old mule into a western town one day. He'd
been out in the desert for about six months without a drop of whiskey. He
walked up to the first saloon he came to and tied his old mule to the
hitching rail.

As he stood there brushing some of the dust from his face and clothes, a
gunslinger walked out of the saloon. He had a gun in one hand and a bottle
of whiskey in the other hand. He looked at the old man and laughed.

Then he said, &quot;Hey old man have you ever danced?&quot;

The old man looked up at him and said, &quot;Nope, never had a hankering to.&quot;

A crowd had gathered by then and the gunslinger said, &quot;Well you old fool
you're gonna dance now,&quot; and he started shooting at the old man's feet. The
old man was hopping around and everybody was laughing. He fired his last
bullet, holstered his gun and turned around to go back in the saloon.

The old man reached up on the mule, got his 10 gauge shotgun and pulled both
hammers back, making a loud click. The gunslinger heard this, then
everything got quiet. He slowly turned around and was looking at the old
prospector aiming both barrels right at him.

The old man asked him, &quot;Did you ever kiss a mule's a&amp;&amp;?&quot;

The gunslinger swallowed hard, then said, &quot;No Sir, but I've always wanted
to!&quot;
