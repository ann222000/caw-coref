Hello,

I am trying to locate existing copies of Dr. Gene Scott's tape
albums, since they are no longer being sold by
Dolores Press.   I am specifically looking for ALL volumes of the
following series:

Demonology
Great Pyramid
History of British Kings
Tribes of Israel

I seek to either purchase them outright or secure them on loan (with
any necessary security deposit) for the purpose of creating duplicates
for preservation.

If anyone reading this has ANY leads on where copies might be found,
whether in private collections, libraries ... wherever ... please
contact me.  I can be reached at (702) 505-4642.

through Dolores Press?

Looks like you will just have to wait for his wife to study all these
subjects and regurgitate them back out in her own words.

Yes, but this person taped them from the original broadcast. If
someone taped Melissa's &quot;messages&quot; directly off Pax/Ion, could they
sell them? Her mesages are copyrighted, weren't Doc's?

It says in the ad that it's a 12 tape boxed set, which is how many of

taped from live broadcasts, but not by this person who is selling the
