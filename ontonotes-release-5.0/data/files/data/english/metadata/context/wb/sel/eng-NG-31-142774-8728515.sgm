LOST LAND OF THE LIZARD PEOPLE
According to the legend and the radio surveys, the underground city was laid

out in the shape of a lizard, with its tail under the Main Library at Fifth
and Hope.
by Robert Stanley
In the summer and fall of 1933, a Los Angeles mining engineer named G.
Warren Shufelt was surveying the L.A. area for deposits of oil, gold and
other
valuable materials, using a new device which he had invented. Shufelt had
designed and built a radio-directed apparatus which he claimed was able to
locate
gold and other precious resources at great depths. He believed that the
radio
device worked on a newly discovered principle involving electrical
similarities of matter which had the same chemical, physical and vibrational

character.
His device appeared to consist of a large pendulum suspended in a
cylindrical glass case which was housed in a black box with compasses on it.
The
pendulum would trace a line directly from a piece of ore broken from a vein
to the
vein it was originally taken from. Hair taken from a test subject would lead

investigators to the person who had donated the hair sample. It was said to
have worked even at a distance of many miles.
Although he would not tell exactly what was in the box, Shufelt believed
that by tuning into the individual frequency of a particular material, he
could
locate similar matter. He believed that the emanations and gravitational
factors of matter influenced the pendulum and that, in principle, no two
separate things were exactly alike. Shufelt was extremely puzzled when one
day,
while taking readings near downtown Los Angeles, his instruments showed him
what
seemed to be a pattern of tunnels which led from what is now the Public
Library in the heart of L.A. to the top of Mount Washington and the
Southwest
Museum to the north in Pasadena.
He proceeded to draw a map and had it copyrighted. What he discovered
appeared to be a well planned underground labyrinth with large rooms located
at
various points, and deposits of apparently man made gold in the chambers and

passage ways.
Some of the tunnels ran west for 20 miles under the Santa Monica Bay, which
he believed were only used for ventilation. Unfortunately, Shufelt had no
idea that they were connected to the older ruins of an even greater city
which
was covered by the Pacific Ocean thousands of years ago during a tremendous
earthquake and subsequent flood.
The subterranean complex he had discovered was used for emergencies and was
only designed to accommodate 5,000 people or less. Food supplies of
imperishable herbs were stored in sufficient quantities which would enable
the
survivors to live underground until it was safe to come back to the surface.

Valuable personal belongings and utensils were also brought into the complex
along
with historical records and gold treasures.
During his research, he met a Hopi Indian named Chief Little Green Leaf, who

told him about the legend of an ancient race of &quot;Lizard People&quot;. The legends

said that about 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, an enormous meteor shower fell on
the western coast covering an area hundreds of miles wide. Winslow crater in

northern Arizona is only one of the pieces that fell from the sky at that
time.
Thousands of people were killed, their crops wiped out, dwellings destroyed,

and the forests set on fire. The surviving members of the medicine lodge,
which had remained on the west coast, met to make plans for constructing
safe
areas. The sentinels of the sky gave their warning that it was time to enter

the shelters and seal the shafts behind themselves. They were forced to go
underground to save them selves from a gigantic meteor shower which
devastated
most of the west coast of the US.

&quot;Hey you guys, relax! I'm only walking on rocks.&quot;
The &quot;Lizard People&quot; of Los Angeles survived the meteor shower, but were
killed by natural gas leaking into their bunkers. Shufelt believed that they
had
built 13 such underground facilities in different areas for such a purpose.
One was located in the eastern section of Arizona in a small town called
Springerville and was only discovered recently. Another was located under a
hill
which was surrounded by a curving ridge of mountains like the middle of a
horse's hoof. This is exactly the type of terrain seen in downtown L.A. in
the
area that is now the Board of Education, which is built over the ruins of
the
old Willis Estate on top of Fort Moore hill. Shufelt and his partner Chief
Little Green Leaf were both convinced that the ancient legends and the
readings
from Shufelt's mystery machine were true.
They decided to obtain a permit to sink a shaft down into the ruins of the
subterranean city. They located a vacant lot at 518 North Hill Street,
directly above one of the largest rooms. On 21st February 1933, the County
Board of
Supervisors approved a contract with Rex McCreary, Warren Shufelt and Ray
Martin to search for buried treasure there. The permittees were to bear all
expenses, to leave the property in its original condition, and to share 50%
of
all discoveries and treasure with the city of L.A.
The county originally only allowed them to dig up to depths of 50 feet for
fear of cave-ins. On 27th March 1933 they requested additional time and
depths
on their permit, believing that the labyrinth of tunnels was at least 1,900
feet in length, with rooms containing 9,000 square feet which contained
valuable gold treasure in at least 16 places.
On 10th April 1933 the contract was renewed. By the end of November in 1933,

the main shaft was at a depth of 200 feet. Shufelt was determined to drill
to a depth of 1,000 feet if necessary. On 29th January 1934, the first
stories regarding the legend of the &quot;Lost Land of the Lizard People&quot; made
the L.A.
newspapers. By this time, one of the five shafts was already 250 feet deep.
According to the legend and the radio surveys, the underground city was laid

out in the shape of a lizard, with its tail under the Main Library at Fifth
and Hope, and the body extending Northeast, with the head being at Lookout
and Marda near North Broadway. The key room to the city was located under
Second and South Broadway. The legends state that the key room is the
directory
to the rest of the city, and to the historical gold record tablets. These
gold
tablets were slabs of gold, 4 feet long and 14 inches wide.
The tablets were believed to contain the records of the origins of the human

race, and the history of modern man in the Americas, including details
regarding the history of the mysterious Mayan people. Shufelt's radio-wave
machine mapped the rooms and tunnels as subsurface voids, with the gold
slabs as
dark areas, showing perfect geometric angles.
The rooms, seven of which occurred within an area of six square city blocks,

varied in size from 23' x 23' to 34' x 42'. The room below the first shaft
was 31' x 42', and the key room was the smallest. Water had seeped into some

of the tunnels, and several of the rooms including the largest were flooded.

Shufelt was prepared to use divers to explore the submerged areas when they
finally broke into the subterranean city. Chief Little Green Leaf claimed
that
the &quot;Lizard People&quot; had been able to predict earthquakes and that he had
also been able to do so.
He had accurately predicted the destruction of the Long Beach quake on 10th
March 1933, a month in advance. He believed that it was easy for anyone to
tell 96 hours in advance when an earthquake was coming, because the needle
on a
compass would become demagnetized and refuse to point north. By the
beginning of February 1934, the first shaft had reached a depth greater than
250
feet and was still being dug, despite difficulty caused by the water
encountered
in its path.
Several newspaper articles featured updates on the project. Shortly after
all the media attention was focused on this search for the lost city under
L.A., the project was suddenly stopped and abandoned. On 5th March 1934, the

shafts had been filled in and the contract with the city was canceled.
Neither
gold nor any other treasure was ever turned over to the County of Los
Angeles.
Mr. Arche Dunning of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce stated in December
of 1947 that, &quot;It is quite possible, of course, that the supposed labyrinth
really exists. But in view of the fact that the overlaying area is the
immediate Civic Center area where an important building program is to be
carried
out, including federal, state, county and city building, there is little
probability of any further excavations.&quot;
This is really not a true statement because it is necessary to excavate many

hundreds of feet into the ground before a high-rise building can be
constructed. Also, one should consider that sewage systems are all
underground. And
let's not forget the new Metro Rail System, which rises up from many feet
below the Civic Center before it speeds commuters on their way. Long ago
even
the Chinese dug tunnels around the area which is now the train yard.
These red brick subsurface tunnels were used for their safe passage, from
one end of Old Chinatown to the other and are now an historic landmark found

preserved at Alvera Street. It is quite possible that there is another city
below the L.A. Civic Center which only a small number of people have access
to.
The question is, who?

LIZARD PEOPLE UPDATE
Dear Duncan,

Here is a reptilian relic that was found in Los Angeles in 1954 that neatly
fits into the &quot;Lost Land of the Lizard People&quot; article [see NEXUS 2/19].
Enclosed is a photo of an artifact that is definitely very old, depicting a
full-bodied dragon.
The upper section of the medallion is made of pure silver that was somehow
fused to a copper-alloy base which is composed of over 40 different types of

metal. The medallion's actual dimensions are 7/8&quot; (width) x 1/4&quot; (length) x
1/l6&quot; (depth).
The man who found it, Mr. G., was an aerospace engineer who lived and worked

for the US Government in Chatsworth, California. The artifact was found
while Mr. G. was helping a friend, who lived on the northern shore of
Chatsworth
Reservoir, repair the wooden stairway to the front porch. Mr. G. dropped his

hammer, which fell into a soft sandy area, and when he reached to pull his
hammer out he noticed this small metal medallion.
Mr. G. still has the artifact in his possession, and after much research
feels that it belonged to an ancient race of space people named ALTEC, who
left
behind their influence on this world long ago. The Friendly or Sleeping
Dragon is a very old symbol, one which has definite connections to UFO's.
I once had the opportunity to show a picture of a Pleiadian -style UFO to a
man from Bhutan (near Tibet) and asked if he had ever seen such a thing. He
replied that yes, they did see them often and that they were called
&quot;Friendly
Dragon&quot;.
Chatsworth is located in Los Angeles County near the northwest border of the

city and county lines. It is likely that a Chinese laborer lost this
artifact while working in Chatsworth on railroad construction, around the
turn of
the century. There is a railroad tunnel that was cut by the Chinese through
a
solid red rock ridge called the Santa Suzana Pass near the Chatsworth Lake.
Old Chinatown is located in downtown Los Angeles and was built where the new

rail-yard now sits.
New Chinatown is built over much of the old tunnel systems that the first
Chinese leaders had constructed for their 'safety' when they first arrived
in
the area. It is possible that engineer/inventor G. W. Shufelt did not know
what he had stumbled onto electronically, and it is also logical that
Chinese
people would not admit to the existence of a secure system of tunnels and
rooms they had worked so hard to build in secret.
There may even have existed a series of older tunnels and rooms that the
Chinese discovered during their own excavations and construction. However,
the
Federal Government definitely stepped in during the '50s and took control of

the entire underground tunnel system for their Cold War operations, adding
many new paranoid-influenced improvements over the years that followed.
In the '9Os, two suspicious arson fires were started as a distraction while
ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence) operatives gained access to the secret
entrance that Shufelt located in the basement of what is now the main
library.
There is more to this story than can be told at this time.
Take care, and keep up the great work with NEXUS magazine.

Robert Stanley
