My 98 Jimmy drivers power window is not working. I went to a supply shop and
they asked with a regulator or without. Not a clue what they are talking
about so here I am.

All moveable windows have a window regulator. I presume they were asking if
you want the motor or motor regulator assembly. Check the switch first, it's
more likely and less expensive, too.

Still no idea what the regulator is. Is it  what I would call the gear box.
When I think of a regulator I think electrical.

It is not the switch.

Correct, it is the mechanism the motor is attached to.  They often get
screwed up also.  It could be that the motor is turning but the regulator is
not moving.

Windows are too common a problem on cars. It would take just pennies to make
them more reliable.

I know a motor cost around $60 and with a regulator it is $120.

Many things on these Jimmy's could be made more reliable. I would start with
wheel bearing hubs.

There should not be an engineering change it should have been engineered a
bit beefier from the start.  Take a look at a bunch of failed units and see
what is broken and think about how cheaply it could have been made with
heavier material, such as the cable.  If you need samples, I have three of
them from two different cars, all the same failure.  Let's see, three of
eight failed the same way.  What could be the problem?

When you build millions of cars a year, pennies sure add up to big bucks.
Car makers (not just GM) want to use minimal material even if there will be
a certain number of failures down the road.  They figure that after 4 or 5
years the customer will just repair it for $200, but GM saved $18,000,000

I agree with you many things on a car could and should be built better.

But I remember the day when 4-5 years would bring time to replace the entire
car, not a few parts. The old saying was they build them to last 5 years so
you must buy a new one.

True.  You don't see this problem as often on say, Toyotas or Lexus.
They would not tolerate a supplier / design providing a part that was
underdesigned and failed as often as it appears that the GM units have
a habit of doing.

i find it strange the toyota and other jap dealers have service

Don't get me wrong, I own two Oldsmobiles!

But....I just finished replacing a wiper motor assembly on a 98 GM
van, and the local parts store had the part!  This tells me a few
things:  A)  They are failing enough to stock the part and make money
selling them, and B) On the other hand its good to have parts so
readily available.  I also just replaced both front hub/wheel
bearings...but the transmission has not been touched and the vehicle
has 140k on it.  Of course I did have to have the intake manifold
gasket replaced, which should have been a recall...  Overall its been
good on drivetrain but bad on other things like interior bits,
interior fit and finish, the power door quit working and gave up
trying to diagnose, rear window vents work sometimes, sometimes only
one works, etc.  The good part of my GM cars is that I buy used, and
with the poor resale value you can get a great value on a vehicle with
a lot of life left in it.

No offence, but if that is your major complaint, then I don't know what to
say. Parts stores are supposed to have the part you want. Are you telling me

That I will agree with. I recently had a gasket job done in an '01 Montana.
$1100 (Canadian) for the repair...Then again, it also has well over

I only had those kind of problems on my '91 Grand Prix. The main reason was
I had a tendency to beat the crap out of the car. Either way, not once did I
have any major problems with the door locks or power windows. It did have

It was a local O'Riley autoparts store.  I figured it was one of those
freak things where I'd have to go to a junk yard or the dealer to
replace it, but apparently enough fail that they stock them in new and
rebuilt.  Guy at the store said they seem to be a weak point as he
gets his share of customers buying them.  I had a '65 and '70 Nova and
my sister had a '65 LeMans, My parents had a variety of cars mostly GM
but including a '70 Toyota and a '84 Mazda pickup.  Over years and
years of car ownership we never had a wiper system fail before this,
but they were the older design - so  go figure.

Also, from doing due dilligiance on the Intrigue, I couldn't help but
notice that for years the vehicle was produced with alternators that
flickered the lights, but GM did not address this for a long time.  My
dad also owned 3 1980s/early 90's SSE Bonnevilles and he just about
had to keep a spare alternator in the trunk, they were junk for years
and GM just ignored it.  Must have been the bean counters not the
engineers, but hard to keep customers happy when the same part keeps
failing...

Its not just GM though, my since departed '95 Ram PU blew a speedo/odo
unit and power door lock mech right before I sold it, lightening my
wallet considerably even just for parts.  Not to mention the tire that
egg shaped as I was marketing it....

GM cars are good for driving the crap out of, they seem to get to a
point of wear but then go for a long time before actually going over
the edge.  When you do get an import up in miles, the parts and
difficulty working on some of them makes them a losing proposition.
But the lines are blurring with US plants and US designed import
vehicles...

I guess it depends on where you go, too.  I went to a Napa (if memory

I owned a 1990 and 1991 Bonnie SSE, a 1996 Bonnie SE and now have a 1996

Those dash boards are expensive as sin. I had to replace one in the 1990
Bonnie. Well, the dash worked fine (Odo, spedo, ect), but the little
computer's that gave Driver Info and a digital Compass didn't. I thought
they were neat, so I paid $200 (IIRC) for a used one.

&gt; GM cars are good for driving the crap out of, they seem to get to a

I drive the crap out of my cars, and I always have. The car that took the
most was a 1991 Grand Prix. By time I scraped it with well something like
350,000 on it, it had more dents in it then I could have counted. Not to
mention the multi-colored  exterior...all burgundy, just different
'versions' of it...But, she drove all the way to the junk yard, and out ran
my then-new-car '97 Olds Cutlass Supreme. Oh the cars we miss...
