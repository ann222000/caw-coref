Anyone know what the exact number of them is in the 2007 inventory?

Last I heard it was 92 +/-

It's been projected that the old BUFFs will stay in service until
2040... decades ago. Why get rid of a good thing?

I think that you will find that the right stick is actually the tail
end of a stick from a plane above, closer to the camera and ahead of the
plane pictured. Notice that the top bomb is ahead of the front opening
of the bomb bay and that the bombs  appear to be larger.

Bombs aren't very selective as to whom they kill. You may be correct
as to the target, but I am willing to bet noncombatants were also waxed.
I have seen up close the aftermath of bombing raids. I will let you try
to imagine the sounds, smells and visuals.

I understand collateral casualties are almost impossible to avoid
short of a sniper shot. That doesn't change what I said about being on
the receiving end.

Biggest strategic military aviation mistake ever?: Agreeing to a
treaty calling for Buffs to be cut up and scrapped.

Nothing says &quot;you're going to die like cockroaches&quot; quite like a fleet
of bomb truck Buffs overhead.

Had we the Buffs, we could have moved 120 of them to Kandahar airfield
in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban, told the Pakistanis that
the tribal areas are, either, 1) part of Pakistan and that the central
government had better get in there, control them, and eliminate the
Taliban and Al-Qaeda or, 2) that failure of the central government to
do this will lead to our decision, by fiat, to recognize that these
tribal areas are independent countries not subject to Pakistani
central authority.

The Pakistani government, completely unable and unwilling to control
these areas, certainly would have required the implementation of
option 2 above.

We then could have declared war on these areas.

Sure, not the normal procedures of international law, but after 9/11,
GW Bush certainly could have gotten away with it had he acted
decisively enough. The Western world would have foregone any outcry.

We could have then sent the Buffs and completely destroyed the safe
havens of both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. Around the clock destruction
of those areas and everyone in them.

Had we done so, we would be out of Afghanistan by now instead of
fighting a dragging counterinsurgent war. Sure lots of civilians in
Quetta would have died, but Al-Qaeda hides amongst
civilians..........so tough noogies. You civilians had better either
not hide these people amongst you, or be prepared to fight for your
&quot;right&quot; to harbor international criminals.

Sure &quot;the world&quot; would have been outraged. The Pakistanis could do
nothing under our threat of nuclear annihilation. Protest to the UN.
Much paper shuffling, etc. Send up aircraft to oppose the Buffs? Lose
your air force and a few cities too.

End result: Taliban and most of Al-Qaeda gone, along with the
establishment of a precedent that, simply put, said in no uncertain
terms to the Islamic world: &quot;conduct terror attacks against the United
States by your convoluted network of proxy warriors for whom no one
can claim legal responsibility, and you will be extincted from the
human race by superior military forces not inclined to fight according
to your asymmetrical warfare plan for world domination&quot;.

It would have worked and we would be out of Afghanistan by now. Sure
it would have radicalized Pakistan...so what!! We can kick their asses
anytime. One Pakistani nuke goes off anywhere in the world in some
attack on the West, and that place gets a whole ballistic missile
submarine full of MIRV's raining down on it.

Escalate with the US? Really? Is THAT what you really want?

The Taliban were attacked because they wouldn't sell OIL pipeline

&gt; &gt;&quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;

&gt; &gt;Rob

&gt; &gt;p.s. We have nukes and are developing next-generation micro-nukes...
&gt; &gt;but carpet-bombing is much more fun IMO :)

&gt; Biggest strategic military aviation mistake ever?: Agreeing to a
&gt; treaty calling for Buffs to be cut up and scrapped.

&gt; Nothing says &quot;you're going to die like cockroaches&quot; quite like a fleet
&gt; of bomb truck Buffs overhead.

&gt; Had we the Buffs, we could have moved 120 of them to Kandahar airfield
&gt; in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban, told the Pakistanis that
&gt; the tribal areas are, either, 1) part of Pakistan and that the central
&gt; government had better get in there, control them, and eliminate the
&gt; Taliban and Al-Qaeda or, 2) that failure of the central government to
&gt; do this will lead to our decision, by fiat, to recognize that these
&gt; tribal areas are independent countries not subject to Pakistani
&gt; central authority.

&gt; The Pakistani government, completely unable and unwilling to control
&gt; these areas, certainly would have required the implementation of
&gt; option 2 above.

&gt; We then could have declared war on these areas.

&gt; Sure, not the normal procedures of international law, but after 9/11,
&gt; GW Bush certainly could have gotten away with it had he acted
&gt; decisively enough. The Western world would have foregone any outcry.

&gt; We could have then sent the Buffs and completely destroyed the safe
&gt; havens of both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. Around the clock destruction
&gt; of those areas and everyone in them.

&gt; Had we done so, we would be out of Afghanistan by now instead of
&gt; fighting a dragging counterinsurgent war. Sure lots of civilians in
&gt; Quetta would have died, but Al-Qaeda hides amongst
&gt; civilians..........so tough noogies. You civilians had better either
&gt; not hide these people amongst you, or be prepared to fight for your
&gt; &quot;right&quot; to harbor international criminals.

&gt; Sure &quot;the world&quot; would have been outraged. The Pakistanis could do
&gt; nothing under our threat of nuclear annihilation. Protest to the UN.
&gt; Much paper shuffling, etc. Send up aircraft to oppose the Buffs? Lose
&gt; your air force and a few cities too.

&gt; End result: Taliban and most of Al-Qaeda gone, along with the
&gt; establishment of a precedent that, simply put, said in no uncertain
&gt; terms to the Islamic world: &quot;conduct terror attacks against the United
&gt; States by your convoluted network of proxy warriors for whom no one
&gt; can claim legal responsibility, and you will be extincted from the
&gt; human race by superior military forces not inclined to fight according
&gt; to your asymmetrical warfare plan for world domination&quot;.

&gt; It would have worked and we would be out of Afghanistan by now. Sure
&gt; it would have radicalized Pakistan...so what!! We can kick their asses
&gt; anytime. One Pakistani nuke goes off anywhere in the world in some
&gt; attack on the West, and that place gets a whole ballistic missile
&gt; submarine full of MIRV's raining down on it.

MOSCOW

A wealthy Russian tried to buy a U.S. B-52 bomber from a group of shocked
American pilots at an airshow near Moscow, a Russian newspaper reported
on Friday.

The unidentified Russian, wearing sunglasses and surrounded by
bodyguards, approached the U.S. delegation and asked to buy the bomber,
the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper said.

An astounded member of the U.S. delegation said the bomber was not for
sale but that it would cost at least $500 million if it were to be sold
on the spot.

&quot;That is no problem. It is such a cool machine,&quot; the Russian was quoted
as saying by the newspaper, which said its reporter overheard the
conversation. The bomber was not sold.

I seriously doubt any noncombatants were killed in the bombings around
the Tora Bora region. (Don't know if the pics actually showed Tora
Bora or not. Just a guess because it looked like Afghanistan.)

The mountains around TB are so brutal, I can hardly believe that any
civilians would have any motivation to be there. Maybe the odd
mountain sheep herder or hermit, but nobody else would actually live
around there.

Which is why Osama and the gang used the place to regroup before
fleeing southwards........very hard to penetrate by enemy recon teams
and/or spies.

Mostly I think the US used drones to spot and Buffs to bomb once
Al-Qaeda locations were found. You can find vids of bomb runs working
through the mountain peaks on the internet. The delaying force of
Al-Qaeda was pretty much wiped out there, but the higher ups went
south and then escaped into Pakistan.

That's not quite right. They requested evidence to support

The Constitution gives Congress the authority to &quot;declare War&quot; along
with the Power of the Purse; the President cannot legally spend money not
appropriated by Congress.

Thus Congress could force a withdrawal from Iraq simply by refusing to
appropriate any funds not related to withdrawal.

The Constitution gives the Congress the sole authority to DECLARE war,
but it also names the Executive Office as Commander in Chief of all US
military forces.

This has traditionally been used by the Executive Office to send US
military forces on missions deemed by the Executive to be critical to
national security, but which fall short of such an existential threat
to the nation that would muster the Congress to declare war.

The Congress, however, has budgetary responsibility and can cut off
funding for military actions conducted by the Executive branch if the
Congress can decide by a majority that such actions are wrongheaded.

Subsequent to the Vietnam war, Congress passed The War Powers Act in
an attempt to limit the ability of the Executive Office to conduct
military operations short of declared war. The total impact of this
act has not been completely tested in any Supreme Court cases as far
as I am aware. There may be some &quot;limited in scope&quot; rulings on it, but
it most certainly has not been used to pull US military forces out of
action by the Congress.

That is an outright LIE!

The Government of Afghanistan offered to turn Osama over to US
authorities IF the US would show evidence that Osama was involved in
the events of Sept 11, 2001.

The US Government refused.

Could it be because the FBI said they have NO evidence linking Osama
to 911?

They were informed that, in that

&gt; Unfortunately for the Taliban, our attack overloaded their capacity to

I guess The &quot;Government of Afghanistan&quot; i.e., The Taliban, were
willing to bet the continued existence of their rule in Afghanistan
based on their demands for &quot;evidence&quot; huh? And what &quot;evidence&quot; do you
think would have satisfied the Taliban?

This is/was all just a stalling tactic leading to diplomatic impasse.
The Taliban's bluff was called and they were removed from power.

If you're going to be stupid, you'd better be tough.

The fact of the matter is: high level Taliban (and Mullah Omar...their
leader) were perfectly aware of what Osama was cooking up on Afghani
territory. They fled to the hills shortly after the attack. Innocent
people don't do that.

The Taliban &quot;hosted&quot; Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and provided a safe haven
for terrorist training. These people had no diplomatic &quot;right&quot; to ask
the US for &quot;evidence&quot; as they were perfectly aware of Al-Qaeda's
purpose. Their demands for &quot;evidence&quot; were merely an attempt to
compromise US intelligence gathering methods and possibly root out
spies amongst them.

The FBI wasn't charged with listening to Al-Qaeda's satellite phone
conversations, the NSA was. NSA intel on international terrorists was
shared with the CIA info on them, which puts together the daily intel
briefings for the US President.

This type of diplomatic maneuvering is obvious to the astute observer.
That you can't figure the reasoning for these maneuvers reflects very
poorly on your debased and subjugated social position as a bunghole.

Until one comes apart and sends pieces into a school and kills a bunch
of kids.

If we are going to keep these things flying we should scrap the
present airframes and build new ones, or at least rewing the fleet.

Better yet, design a new bomber that does the same mission using as
many 747/777 rotables as possible.

3,253 assuming &quot;children&quot; means those under 18 and 2,942 if &quot;children&quot;
means those short of their sixteenth birthday. (No allowance made for
&quot;under eighteen but also under arms&quot; and other awkwardness about how
&quot;women and children&quot; are generally, but not always, noncombatants)

On the other hand, it _saved_ 954,284,591 lives on a very conservative
estimate, so the BUFF was a pretty good deal overall.
