Could this have anything to do with the high cost of housing in
Fairfax County?

The Board of Supervisors has decided that buyers of new or renovated
homes that exceed the 35-foot height limit will have to lower the roofs
or raise the ground around the foundations before they move in.
According to Lisa Rein with the Washington Post , some 15 buyers have
been denied occupancy permits because their houses are too tall.

The violations stem from a difference of opinion between builders and
the county on how to measure the height of a house. For years, builders
have interpreted the zoning ordinance more liberally than the county
when measuring structures with multiple roof lines. They averaged the
heights of all the roof lines, while the county says the midpoint of the
highest roof line should have been measured. County officials
acknowledged last week that they had issued valid permits to build at
those heights and had failed to monitor compliance with their zoning
rules. Now homeowners are paying the price for the County's negligence.
More to the point, what's the reasoning behind the County's regulation
of the height of housing in the first place?

I don't know, but I assume the reasoning is based on the old fear
that density = poverty and crime.

And poverty and crime are code words for "brown people".

I'm assuming this is just another antiquated zoning ordinance from
the 60s or 70s that was meant to keep suburbia free of affordable
housing

Actually height may have more to do with the ladders on the fire
department to get up on the roof, than with race.

But, nice try to put a red herring in the mix.

If the rules are ambiguous, and the builder submitted the plans to
the county, and the county approved the plans, how can the county now
block residency?

VA Centrist. The houses affected are generally the McMansions that
have towering and multiple roof lines. The regulations state that the
height of a house is to be measured to the highest roof line. It appears
that some builders calculated an average height from multiple roof, some
higher and some lower than the 35 foot limit.

It ain't fair, but it is a matter of primacy: the King can do no
wrong.

If they say you can't move in, then you can't and there may be no
recourse, or no recourse that is likely to work, that you can afford,
and will happen in yoour lifetime.

It is still wrong, the plans were submitted and approved. The county
should live with it, and make corrections to see it doesn't happen
again.

I got slammed with a similar thing: asked the county what I was
allowed to do, they told me in writing, but when I tried to do it and
had already spent the money, they said, hey, you can't do that.

No recourse.

JBB:

Oh right, I forgot. Race doesn't exist. And white boards of
supervisors never tried to keep blacks out using zoning ordinances.

My bad.

Virginia Leftist: Virginia has had a black population since 1619. If
you know when a county or city used zoning to segregate then I'd like to
hear about it. That kind of de facto segregation is a Northern
invention.

The closest thing I know to it is the gerrymandering of school
division lines in the 60s - maybe the 70s. For example the lines were
drawn in Arlington to keep Yorktown HS almost all white, Halls Hill
neighborhood went to W&amp;L and Green Valley neighborhood went to
Wakefield after they closed Hoffman-Boston.

Maybe I've lived in Fairfax County so long that I've become oblivious
to things others can easily see. However, I don't see the relationship
of the belated enforcement of height limits for new homes to race.

Given the many successful business and professional people of all
races in Fairfax County, I'm sure that this decision by the BoS would
affect both whites and non-whites alike, but, for the life of me, how
could it affect non-white people more?

If the argument is that zoning's chief purpose in Fairfax County is
to penalize non-whites, that argument is simply silly. The chief purpose
of Fairfax County's zoning ordinance is to generate campaign
contributions for elected officials who then, in turn, manipulate it as
far as possible without creating a complete citizen rebellion -- which
is probably occurring.

Hey JAB - Check out Vienna's Historic District. If you knew anything
about it, you'd see that ALL the historical black houses & cemeterys
were completely left out - even though it's all the same neighborhood.

But, nice try.

It's not fun when you're forced to live this nightmare as I am. After
building a house to FC building permit, we have been denied an occupancy
permit due to a review failure in FC. We are now asked to bear the
financial burden of fixing FC's mistakes. This is outrageous and is
causing a heavy financial and mental strain on me and my family. I hope
that someone in the County will come to their senses soon.

I am building a home with an approved FC building permit. We have
passed all inpsections and were ready for the final Residence Use Permit
(RUP). During the application process, we were surprised by a 'hold'
citing building height violation. The County failed to notify us of this
hold-another failure in the process. So now we are victims of regulatory
changes, caught in the middle and forced to carry the economic burden.
My position is simple- if FC approved the permit, it should stay
approved. If FC want to change the regs then do it going forward and not
penalize homes that they've already approved. That is only FAIR. We have
filed a lawsuit against the County.

If you agree with my position, then please support us by writing
letters to the Chairman of the Board of Supervisor. Thanks- <
