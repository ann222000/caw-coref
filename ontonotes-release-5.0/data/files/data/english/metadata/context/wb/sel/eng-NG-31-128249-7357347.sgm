Reinforcing the Occupation: Israel's High Court

Journalist Gideon Levy wrote in the Israeli daily Haaretz: "From now
on, the [Israeli] Supreme Court will act without
Aharon Barak. It will, however, presumably continue to act within his
legacy, which has authorized nearly all
injustices in the territories. Barak, meanwhile, will continue to be
depicted in Israel and the world as a
pursuer of justice." The Israeli High Court of Justice under the
presidency of Professor Barak has impressed many
observers as being many things: progressive, daring, precedent setting.
However, the actual results of the
Barak Court offer little in the way of comparison to a Court like the
Warren Court in the United States. The
Warren Court is most remembered for breaking down the cruel and
completely undemocratic system of racial
segregation in United States schools and for its Miranda decision which
said that criminal defendants must be
clearly informed of their civil rights, including the right to an
attorney. The Barak Court, in contrast (while
not detracting from some of its decisions regarding civil rights in
Israel), admonished the state on many occasions
regarding some of the more egregious manifestations of Israeli
Occupation cruelty but did little to dismantle the
occupation and, instead, left it intact and actually, as Mr. Levy
notes, reinforced it.

Granted, the Supreme Court in Israel, sitting as the High Court of
Justice, is under constant pressure from the both
Israel's center and right wing who threaten to constrain its authority
to decide constitutional issues. Because
Israel has no real constitution and certainly no comprehensive
instrument to protect civil and human rights
the Court is consistently faced with calls to restrict its so-called
Judicial activism. This, however, should not
have hampered the Court. The Court should have declared the Occupation
illegal. It could have used the clear and
highly developed legal reasoning for which it is so well known in order
to explain exactly how there is no
fundamental difference between an 'illegal' outpost such as Kochav
Ya'akov West and a 'legal' settlement such as
Kochav Ya'akov or Ma'aleh Adumim (both of which are over the Green
Line, on expropriated and occupied Palestinian
land) and that the State has no right to confiscate land in order to
build a wall that divides Palestinians and
protects settlements that have no right to exist. The Court might have
easily relied on international
humanitarian law (IHL) which forbids Israel from doing exactly what it
is doing in the OPT. The Court left the
assassinations policy in place, delivering a meticulously reasoned
legal analysis while forgetting or ignoring the
human and human rights dimensions of the issue. After all, has anyone
thought to ask how it is that Israel manages to
know so much about so many 'terrorists'? Israel has infiltrated
Palestinian society, worming its way into the
soil of Palestinian life in order to 'persuade' Palestinians to join
Israel's counter-insurgency efforts
as informers. Most often these offers are too hard to refuse, with the
"choice" often being, become an informer
or be labeled as one. Furthermore, the Court, in an important decision,
by many accounts, ostensibly
prohibited torture in Israel, yet it did not refer to the Israeli
euphemism "moderate physical pressure" as torture
-- which it is. Rather than reconciling its decision with international
law and absolutely outlawing torture and
cruel and inhuman treatment it left the window open and actually paved
the way for torture and cruel, inhuman and
degrading treatment to continue to be used as a
counter-terrorism/insurgency tool albeit, (and perhaps),
to a lesser extent than in the past. In short, in these two cases, at
least, the Court acted as an agent of the
state (albeit a critical one) rather than a fully unbiased arbiter of
the law.

In both judgments Court President Barak opens with a factual background
that reflects a very specific narrative
of Israel fighting terrorism and requiring the use of special means to
do so. Essentially the Court, in these
two instances, acts as a regulator of these means rather than as an
adjudicator of the ultimate justness of these
so-called methods of prosecuting its "war against terrorism." The
annexation barrier continues to be built,
walling Palestinians off from their kin while setting the boundaries
for the Palestinian non-state and the expanded
Israeli settler state. In fact, in one of the High Court's most recent
decisions on the wall, it too opened with a
similar narrative of Israel fighting terror and the need for security.
The wall is being constructed, in Barak's
words, "against this background." Although in this decision (Mara'abe
v. Prime Minister of Israel, H.C.J.
7957/04) the Court ordered the State to readjust the route of the
barrier, the Court "endorsed the policy of
construction of the wall ..." In essence, the 'progressive' nature (in
the Israeli context) of the High
Court of Justice is consigned to irrelevance by its inability or
unwillingness to come out against the
Occupation and the Court simply acts to regulate the Occupation.

The problem that I want to address is not the seemingly unending
catalog of human rights abuses associated with the Occupation, but
rather the fact that these abuses are integral components of the
primary human rights abuse, the state violence that is the Occupation.
Israeli human rights attorney Michael Sfard noted that, as opposed to
"human rights neutralists" who may bifurcate the Occupation from its
abuses, "the occupation in itself is a
human rights issue. Therefore in examining the [Israeli High] Court's
contribution or damage to human rights, one
must examine the Court's role in strengthening or weakening the
occupation as [a] legal and political
entity." This observation is absolutely true and it must frame any
discussion of human rights abuses in the course
of the Occupation and in any reference to Israeli assertions of power,
sovereignty and authority over the
Palestinian population in the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem. The
Occupation, furthermore, has simultaneously
plagued Israel for forty years and imprisoned the Palestinians as a
stateless people with virtually no
access to rights protection except for the grossly inadequate appeals
to the Israeli legal system, which may
have scolded Israel at times while consistently maintaining the bars of
the imprisonment that is the
Occupation locked. This creates a situation so absurd that even when a
human rights attorney 'wins' a favorable
judgment in the HCJ she actually must inquire into whether the victory
gained was actually another plank in the
structure of the Occupation.

The Occupation and its deleterious effects continue both inside and
outside of the Green Line. Israel forbids
Palestinian citizens of the state from marrying Palestinians from the
OPT. Migrant workers are still
treated as virtual slaves while the State pursues children of migrant
workers, who know nothing of their "homelands,"
targeting them for deportation. In recent weeks Israel's Haaretz weekly
magazine has run articles about African
political refugees fighting for the right not to be deported by Israel
and sent back to their native
countries, perhaps to be killed, raped or otherwise abused back to back
with Gideon Levy's running chronicle of
Israel's cruelty to the Palestinians -- killing, destruction of
families and homes, humiliation and
expropriation of their humanity -- in the name of the Occupation. After
forty years of this cruel occupation,
which has destroyed Palestinian society as well as Israeli society,
Israel harbors no misgivings and certainly fails
to display any sense of shame.

Rather, Israel continues its destructive occupation, unimpeded and with
impunity. The Palestinian Authority is
being dragged into civil war while Israel gloatingly sits back as if
this too is part of its plan. For Palestinians,
Israel and its Court are two sides of the same coin. While the Court
may have shaken its finger at the State on a
number of occasions (and in some instances offering genuine relief to
individual petitioners) it has failed --
perhaps it was unable or frightened -- to utter the essential word
which each case demanded: No. Instead,
Israel pursues its Occupation enterprise to the point of what seems to
be no return. Palestinians have been so
dehumanized that they fit Hannah Arendt's definition of those who "have
been driven outside the pale of the law"
and who, even while enjoying 'human rights,' have been so cut off from
political community that they have, at
various times, been denied even the right to an identity. Again, those
'rights of man', which according to Arendt
are supposedly inalienable, are unenforceable, even in those states
that purport to base their very democratic
existence upon them, in regards to peoples who have been divested of
their citizenship. The Israeli Occupation has
done just that to the Palestinians, removing them from the realm of
citizenship and completely rebuffing their
aspirations to national identity and sovereignty.
Similarly, Agamben's concept of 'homo sacer' in relation to the status
of the Palestinians also sheds light on the
problem and contributes naturally to Hannah Arendt. Under Agamben, the
Palestinian, by virtue of his standing
vis-a-vis the absolute power of the Israeli Occupation, has been
stripped of even the most minimal status and
rights that a slave enjoys. Even a slave had some rights and
protections, and increasingly it seems that
Palestinians lack even these basic protections.

The Palestinian is subject to the will of the Israeli Occupation. He or
she has no voice and no substantial
political status. Far too often Israel acts with impunity when life,
property and well being of Palestinians are
concerned. Even when they gain access to the courts Palestinians find
little relief and are subject to the
arbitrary power of Israel. Moreover, Palestinians are subject to a
separate system of justice, namely "military
justice" in which their rights to due process, fair trials and pain
free interrogations are severely hampered.
Israelis (especially Israeli settlers in the Occupied Territory), on
the other hand, are governed by Israeli
justice and all too often find that they enjoy virtual immunity from
prosecution when they commit crimes -- even
violent crimes -- against Palestinians and when they continue to engage
in the structural violence of
settlement expansion and construction, which are patently illegal acts.
For Palestinians the principle of equal
protection of the law does not to apply to them. It is virtually
meaningless. Although ruled by Israel they are
offered no protection especially in relation to the protections
afforded settlers, other Israelis and those
entitled to be Israelis (that is Jews). It is, then, obvious that the
Palestinian is indeed homo sacer in the
eyes of the Israeli occupation system if not in the eyes of Israeli
society as a whole. According to Dani Filc and
Hadas Ze'ev, "The homo sacer is included in the community as the
excluded one, as he who may be killed and his/her
killing will not be considered a murder. S/he is included within the
law as s/he who is excluded from the protection
of the law. .. In certain contexts, such as in the Occupied
Territories, people become in fact 'homines
sacri'" ("The fiction of sovereignty and the denial of the right to
health care: Israel's policy in the Occupied
Territories (Draft)). 1967 and the subsequent decades of the Occupation
proved that Israel was not interested in
reconciliation but rather in territorial superiority at the expense of
political wisdom, justice and equality

Perhaps the loss of Palestinian human rights stems from another human
rights situation that Arendt discussed in
relation to the first loss the rigthless suffer, the "loss of their
homes ... and the loss of entire social texture
in to which they were born and in which they established for themselves
a distinct place in the world." This loss
is tantamount to a monumental loss of social and political life that
only began in 1948, if not before. Perhaps, if
not for the 1967 Occupation, which continued this trend of rights
corruption, there might have been room for healing
and reconciliation. However, 1967 and the subsequent decades of the
Occupation proved that Israel was not
interested in reconciliation but rather in territorial superiority at
the expense of political wisdom, justice
and equality. It might be that for this reason at least one well-known
academic refers to Israel as an
anachronism, as a country that by virtue of its destruction of
Palestinian society, occupation and
settlement policy has placed itself in the same category as a 19th
century colonialist state, such as the United
States, which expanded beyond its borders by conquering and settling
its western frontier always at the expense of
the Native American population.

The Israeli High Court of Justice oversaw and continues to oversee
these developments lending the Occupation its
judicial imprimatur. Thus Palestinians remain essentially faceless
persons, divested of civil and human rights with
no real avenue for redress. As Levy writes, following the delivery of
Aharon Barak's final judicial decisions, "the
Israeli occupation won significant power. This additional power came in
the form of the broad legitimization granted
its injustices by the most prestigious institution in Israeli society,"
the High Court of Justice.

Yet, it is impossible, to lay the entire blame for this travesty at the
feet of Israel's High Court of Justice.
The policy of Occupation is a comprehensive one to which Israel's
citizens have tacitly if not overtly acquiesced
over the course of four decades. The extent to which complicity
attaches is a complex one yet it is clear that
the Occupation constructs a situation in which, at least indirectly,
Israeli society bears as much responsibility
as Israel's political, military and judicial authorities. Denial and
myopia are Israeli pathologies. Much like the
Iraqi is "unmournable" for Americans, so too are Palestinians
unmournables for Israelis. Perhaps Israelis
see the violence that is inflicted on the Palestinians as incapable of
being a violation of human rights, but
rather, to continue Cyra Choudhury's line of thought regarding the
United States and Iraq, as a corrective
measure "applied" to a people who bear a collective guilt for both
being the Other and a 'criminal' collective that
dared to resist and oppose a patently illegal Occupation.

Just as Guantanamo Bay has become the metaphor for how the United
States has and continues to act with impunity,
perhaps the Occupation can now be seen as Israel's Guantanamo Bay.
