I'm supporting the Pres this time. First time I felt that they are
being upfront about things and are finally willing to admit mistakes
and change the course. We can't let Iraq slip into Iranian and Syrian
control.
Having Iran control the 2nd largest oil reserve would be devastating.
Even though I feel they probably screwed it up beyond repair, we should
support this last effort.

They need to have more troops to be able to actually keep the
insurgents out. The way it's been is just like VietNam. They chase the
enemy away, then move on, only to have them come right back. The other
thing they need to do is to actually build back up the infrustructure,
so that people can have services, safety and not feel the need to join
these millitias for protection.

The Iraqi army is a disaster, according to all sources, and I do mean *ALL*.

The Iraqi police have been infiltrated by every form of rat imaginable.
Nobody trusts them.

Insurgents seem to have found a new weapon: 13 year old kids loaded with
explosives. No more pictures of American soldiers being friendly with kids.
That's over.

We just pissed off the Kurds, our only sorta kinda ally in the country.

Got a plan?

You could have included words to the effect "kind of Iraqi ally".
OTOH, the US's non-Iraqi allies are so easy to overlook.  And, if
they too get pissed off, whattheheck.  Overlooking foreigners and
their feelings can become an expensive habit.  A wee thought. ;-)

Considering that after 9/11, other terrorist attacks have been in London,
Spain and Indonesia, I think it's not worth a try. We've already seen that
our presence in Iraq does not necessarily stop terrorist attacks.

The fact that he actually admitted it's a mess is a step in the right
direction - albeit way too late.  I don't know if 20K more troops will
actually help, though.  Seems like more of an internal (Iraqi) political
mess (a huge one) than something that can be cleaned up with more of our
troops.

22,000 extra soldiers just isn't nearly enough to accomplish anything
positive in Iraq, especially with a commander-in-chief who's clueless
about war and who doesn't want to do what's really needed to win.  This
war was lost when we fired the Iraqi army and police, and I say that

invaded with only 150,000 soldiers.

Please tell me that all of you KNEW we had even more troops in Iraq at one
point than we will have after upping the current count by 20k. Please tell
me you guys knew that.

Please tell me you know that we had 140k troops in Iraq on Nov. 30, and the
addition of 20k more will push that number to 160k, and that you knew that
as recently as mid-2005 we had more than 160k troops.

I think this is the first time I've ever agreed with you. While the exact
words you spout here are accurate, I can't help but wonder if you understand
what they mean.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STOP ANY AND ALL TERRORIST ATTACKS FROM EVER
HAPPENING. Not possible. Ever. At all.

The reason is, to stop any and all terrorists attacks that might ever
happen, we have to be 100% right every minute of every day, forever. If you
really want to be free of any terrorist attack, then you are living in a
dream world. It is impossible to protect against terrorist atttack. The very
best we can hope for is to derail a few attacks on occasion, and to respond
better to any attack once it has happened.

While our presence in Iraq might not foil all terrorist attacks, there is
every reason to believe that our absence from Iraq would likely lead to more
attacks.

The US doesn't have any true foreign allies, your country included.

Every other nation acts in their own best interest, secure in the
knowledge that when things get too hot for them they can run and duck
under Uncle Sam's friendly wing.

If an American president ever has the courage to withdraw all of our
forces to inside our continental borders, the rest of the world will be
on fire within a week.

Problem is that Bush's incompetence has created this mess, so you can
stop blaming the Democrats, up till now Bush got everthing he asked
for. Because of this botched war, we now face the real and likely
possibility that there will be a far far larger danger to the world
than Sadaam ever was, a nuclear super power Iran. This is Bush's
legacy. I don't have much hope that any new plan coming from him will
do much, other than get more of our soldiers killed, but regardless, we
are at this point were we need to do whatever we can to prevent this
from happening. I can't blame anybody who doesn't believe that his war
isn't already a lost cause, cause in all likely hood it is, but I'm
will to support Bush for now on the slim hopes that things can get
turned around in Iraq.

The administration has long wanted to decrease the number of US
soldiers in Iraq -- don't you remember when Rumsfeld said that he
doubted we'd still be in Iraq six months after the invasion started?
Even the military expected to be out by then, which is why the first
soldiers there weren't trained at all for peacekeeping (who needs it
when the war will be a cakewalk and the Iraqis will welcome you with
open arms and flowers?).  Also the administraton decreased our force
level in the summer of 2006, either by pulling out troops or pulling
them back, and had the new Iraqi army take over more of the
responsibility for security around Bagdhad.  That worked out badly, so
we had to add about 8,000 US soldiers, yet they couldn't achieve peace.
While 22,000 is substantially more (would almost double our force in
Bagdhad), but do you really think it's enough, especially considering
that the original contingency plan for the invasion of Iraq called for
380,000 soldiers and co-opting original local army?

the fact that there was no plan in place post "mission accomplished" was a
huge clue that things were not destined to go well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; support this last effort.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; They need to have more troops to be able to actually keep the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; insurgents out. The way it's been is just like VietNam. They chase
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; enemy away, then move on, only to have them come right back. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; thing they need to do is to actually build back up the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; infrustructure,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; so that people can have services, safety and not feel the need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; join
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; these millitias for protection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Iraqi army is a disaster, according to all sources, and I do mean
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *ALL*.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Iraqi police have been infiltrated by every form of rat imaginable.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody trusts them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Insurgents seem to have found a new weapon: 13 year old kids loaded
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; explosives. No more pictures of American soldiers being friendly with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kids.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's over.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We just pissed off the Kurds, our only sorta kinda ally in the country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Got a plan?

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is worth a try.  Let's see what happens.  If results don't happen
&gt;&gt;&gt; in some months then time to pull up stakes and hunker down in the U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt; then let the rest of the world take care of itself.  This perhaps will
&gt;&gt;&gt; be a wakeup call for the rest of those lazy nations not willing to pitch
&gt;&gt;&gt; in.

&gt;&gt; Considering that after 9/11, other terrorist attacks have been in London,
&gt;&gt; Spain and Indonesia, I think it's not worth a try. We've already seen
&gt;&gt; that our presence in Iraq does not necessarily stop terrorist attacks.

&gt; I think this is the first time I've ever agreed with you. While the exact
&gt; words you spout here are accurate, I can't help but wonder if you
&gt; understand what they mean.

&gt; IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STOP ANY AND ALL TERRORIST ATTACKS FROM EVER
&gt; HAPPENING. Not possible. Ever. At all.

&gt; The reason is, to stop any and all terrorists attacks that might ever
&gt; happen, we have to be 100% right every minute of every day, forever. If
&gt; you really want to be free of any terrorist attack, then you are living in
&gt; a dream world. It is impossible to protect against terrorist atttack. The
&gt; very best we can hope for is to derail a few attacks on occasion, and to
&gt; respond better to any attack once it has happened.

&gt; While our presence in Iraq might not foil all terrorist attacks, there is
&gt; every reason to believe that our absence from Iraq would likely lead to
&gt; more attacks.
">

Which "every reason", Jeff?  How many people does it take to carry out a
sophisticated attack? 5? 10? 15?  We have not, and cannot seal the borders
or Iraq, nor have we tried. If a group wants out, they'll get out.
Hopefully, they will have a harder time getting INTO this country than OUT
of Iraq.

Jeff, the only reason that would be true is that he's got a little bit of a
head start with CERTAIN kinds of knowledge - the kind you get from
professional advisors, like generals. However, according to his own
admissions, he was way behind some of us on day #1 of his presidency. He
explicitly stated that he doesn't read much, and that is why he is failing
now. That saying about being doomed to repeat history if you are ignorant of
it - it's true, and he is demonstrating that right now.

More irony:  There are more private contractors in Iraq at the moment than
there are troops. Now, this may sound weird, but I wonder if corporations
have any influence in Washington. What do you think, Jeff?

&gt;&gt; &gt; I'd hate to think of what would happen if the weak spined Dims get
&gt;&gt; &gt; their way!

&gt;&gt; Problem is that Bush's incompetence has created this mess, so you can
&gt;&gt; stop blaming the Democrats, up till now Bush got everthing he asked
&gt;&gt; for. Because of this botched war, we now face the real and likely
&gt;&gt; possibility that there will be a far far larger danger to the world
&gt;&gt; than Sadaam ever was, a nuclear super power Iran. This is Bush's
&gt;&gt; legacy. I don't have much hope that any new plan coming from him will
&gt;&gt; do much, other than get more of our soldiers killed, but regardless, we
&gt;&gt; are at this point were we need to do whatever we can to prevent this
&gt;&gt; from happening. I can't blame anybody who doesn't believe that his war
&gt;&gt; isn't already a lost cause, cause in all likely hood it is, but I'm
&gt;&gt; will to support Bush for now on the slim hopes that things can get
&gt;&gt; turned around in Iraq.

&gt; Terrorism is a global threat Tom, gee whiz get it right.  Terrorism is
&gt; not some sort of time bite, it's been going on for years.  Have you been
&gt; in a cave or had your head stuck in the sand.  9/11 brought it to
&gt; reality for the U.S.  With Bush in charge we are now taking the fight to
&gt; the terrorists.
">

Actually, terrorist attacks are so rare as to be a non-event. The problem is
that they are often spectacular, so they make news. You've been told to
worry about them more than other more important things, though.

What if I told you that you would be checked for alcohol every single time

In this case the support many are showing is constructive criticism.  One

without first acknowledging the problem.  Last night he acknowledged that
the previous "stay the course" strategy didn't work, &amp; now his extra 20K

this as a viable solution, why keep mum?

And...  Why show false support?  (Which is what I suspect your above
statement really means: support the President, right or wrong.  Arghhh.  We
live in a society which allows us to express our honest opinions - may was
well exercise that right, esp. when it concerns something so important!)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; because I'm an optimist -- the realists said it was lost the moment we
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; invaded with only 150,000 soldiers.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The ground troops are going to secure Bagdad.  The Navy will take care

&gt; Do you?  Please press me with your knowledge.

I don't know. My theory is that the place is a shooting gallery. Controlling
it will require shooting anything that moves, including little kids,
especially since a 13 year old boy was used as a bomb carrier today or
yesterday. So, in order to control the area, we will be immediately
perceived as villains when we begin killing innocent people.

Why do you think it will work when the original invasion plan called
for 380,000 soldiers?

And what will the navy do that they haven't done already with air
attacks?

The navy?  One of the biggest problems we need to deal with is Sadr City, a
tightly packed slum that's so dangerous, our soldiers prefer to avoid the
place. It's urban warfare at its worst, insurgents completely blended in
with the general population.

You sound pretty sure about the navy. What are they doing to do? At least
take a guess.

Congratulations on finally having some sense to see what the price of
failure would be.  It takes insanity or pure hatred to ignore the
realities of allowing Iraq to fall into the hands of Iran.  Even the
Democratic leadership really know they can't pull the troops out or
they would cut funding.  All their posturing is nothing more than
partisan politics designed to satisfy their loony base.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 22,000 extra soldiers just isn't nearly enough to accomplish anything
&gt;&gt;&gt; positive in Iraq, especially with a commander-in-chief who's clueless
&gt;&gt;&gt; about war and who doesn't want to do what's really needed to win.  This
&gt;&gt;&gt; war was lost when we fired the Iraqi army and police, and I say that
&gt;&gt;&gt; because I'm an optimist -- the realists said it was lost the moment we
&gt;&gt;&gt; invaded with only 150,000 soldiers.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The other nations aren't lazy; they just weren't stupid enough to start
&gt;&gt;&gt; an unjustified war.

&gt;&gt;I'm going to go out on a limb here, but I'm pretty sure that Clueless
&gt;&gt;George
&gt;&gt;knows more about war than you will ever know. That's E-V-E-R.

&gt; For sure!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd hate to think of what would happen if the weak spined Dims get
&gt; &gt; &gt; their way!

&gt; &gt; Problem is that Bush's incompetence has created this mess, so you can
&gt; &gt; stop blaming the Democrats, up till now Bush got everthing he asked
&gt; &gt; for. Because of this botched war, we now face the real and likely
&gt; &gt; possibility that there will be a far far larger danger to the world
&gt; &gt; than Sadaam ever was, a nuclear super power Iran. This is Bush's
&gt; &gt; legacy. I don't have much hope that any new plan coming from him will
&gt; &gt; do much, other than get more of our soldiers killed, but regardless, we
&gt; &gt; are at this point were we need to do whatever we can to prevent this
&gt; &gt; from happening. I can't blame anybody who doesn't believe that his war
&gt; &gt; isn't already a lost cause, cause in all likely hood it is, but I'm
&gt; &gt; will to support Bush for now on the slim hopes that things can get
&gt; &gt; turned around in Iraq.

&gt; Terrorism is a global threat Tom, gee whiz get it right.  Terrorism is
&gt; not some sort of time bite, it's been going on for years.  Have you been
&gt; in a cave or had your head stuck in the sand.  9/11 brought it to
&gt; reality for the U.S.  With Bush in charge we are now taking the fight to
&gt; the terrorists.

&gt; Democratic leadership really know they can't pull the troops out or
&gt; they would cut funding.  All their posturing is nothing more than
&gt; partisan politics designed to satisfy their loony base.

Don't get too congratulatory. We are only at this point because of Bush

going into Iraq in the first place and then by running the war
incompetently,
but I do agree at this point we need to make a real effort to win this
thing and bring stability to Iraq, I think the real screwup was Rummy,
hopefully Bush has better advisors now.

Sadr City is almost half of Baghdad, but putting another 22,000
soldiers in Baghdad, almost doubling our force there, may not be enough
to take control of Sadr City because of its population density, Sadr's
militia, and the fact that our forces have less experience there than
in any other part of Baghdad..  And any all-out fight could result in a
lot, lot more casualties than usual or a lot of homes being destroyed,
which will certainly help al Sadr's side.  But if we're going to bomb
the whole place, why not instead just give the residents 72 hours
notice to evacuate and then carpet bomb everything?  Unfortunately
Sadr's militia operates all over central and southern Iraq.

Another problem is that Iraq is in civil war, and we don't know whose
side to take -- al Sadr is Shiite, which is anti-Sunni, anti-al Quada,
and nationalist; the Mahdr Army, which sides with al Sadr but is cozy
with Iran, or the military Baathists, who are Sunni, anti-al Quada, and
nationalist but too small to rule Iraq on their own.  This is a lot
worse than choosing the right competing strongman because the wrong
strongman is a lot easier to kill than a militia.

If all we want is oil, we can simply give diplomatic recognition to the
new sovereign nations of Kurdistan and Shiastan and carpet bomb the
Sunni region.  The best thing (only thing?) we can probably do now
about Iran is to not make stupid mistakes and wait until the Iranian
people kick out their crazies.  Most Iranians were born after the
revolution, so they hate it, and the US has a higher approval rating in
Iran than about anywhere else in the Middle East.

I don't know how the worst international mistake in US history can be
fixed, at least not in a manner that GW Bush would approve of or that
would prevent China and Russia to turn completely against  us.  I don't
think there is a good solution..

Dick Cheney's grand contingency plan for the Middle East was to take
over Iraq to keep Saudi oil power in check and perhaps later invade the
eastern, Shiite-majority area of Saudi Arabia where almost all the oil
is.  The plan would drive out the Saudi family into the western desert.

BTW, something strange is happening with Iran because Israel recently
held secret talks with them over some debt Israel owed.  This may
simply be another instance of non-Arabs of the Middle East cooperating
with one another.

I don't think the Patriot Act has been very effective.  We've been kept
safe mostly because Airline cockpit doors are armored and kept locked,
there's widespread suspicion of anybody who looks Middle Eastern, and
the war in Afghanistan has disrupted al Quada quite a bit (Why did al
Quada bomb a train in Spain?  Because they couldn't bomb anything in
the US).

Unfortunately we're still not doing nearly enough about providing
secular education in Afghanistan and Pakistan and countering the money
the radical Saudis (the royal family) have been sending there for
extremist religous schools.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing is perfect.  I am pleased we are fighting terrorism.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The only fight against terrorism that's working is one that you
&gt;&gt; &gt; cannot see. It's not in the news.

&gt;&gt; This may be true.  I'm glad you recognize how invaluable the Patriot
&gt;&gt; Act is.

&gt; I don't think the Patriot Act has been very effective.  We've been kept
&gt; safe mostly because Airline cockpit doors are armored and kept locked,
&gt; there's widespread suspicion of anybody who looks Middle Eastern, and
&gt; the war in Afghanistan has disrupted al Quada quite a bit (Why did al
&gt; Quada bomb a train in Spain?  Because they couldn't bomb anything in
&gt; the US).

&gt; Unfortunately we're still not doing nearly enough about providing
&gt; secular education in Afghanistan and Pakistan and countering the money
&gt; the radical Saudis (the royal family) have been sending there for
&gt; extremist religous schools.
">

I'd like to see a modern equivalent of the WWII victory garden effort, but
with gasoline. If Americans (theoretically) approve of a pointless war to
"git them nasty terrorists", you'd think we could manage to direct some of
that (theoretical) anger toward each of us driving 20% less each week. Too
bad the last 5 presidents have been so happy to blow the Saudis, rather than
spank them for their part in this mess. Otherwise, one of them might have
the balls to say "Look - money talks, but the Saudis don't believe we have
the gumption to hit them in the pocket book. What do YOU all think?"

&gt;&gt;&gt; Except that the whole thing was a mistake from day 1.  Then given that
&gt;&gt;&gt; fact that we were there, once Saddam was toppled (even in the literal
&gt;&gt;&gt; sense!), the fact that there was no plan in place post &quot;mission
&gt;&gt;&gt; accomplished&quot; was a huge clue that things were not destined to go well.

Petroleum products.  Iran will own some 20% of the world's oil
reserves, they will manipulate all the European countries into giving
them technology.  They will also have created nuclear weapons and
finally they will be training and supplying terrorists with impunity
since no one will be able do anything about it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; likely if we lose in Iraq?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Petroleum products.  Iran will own some 20% of the world's oil
&gt;&gt; &gt; reserves, they will manipulate all the European countries into
&gt;&gt; &gt; giving them technology.  They will also have created nuclear
&gt;&gt; &gt; weapons and finally they will be training and supplying terrorists
&gt;&gt; &gt; with impunity since no one will be able do anything about it.

&gt;&gt; Interesting that you mention all this at this particular time.

&gt; I have mentioned all this before in my conversations with DH.  It's
&gt; really not that difficult to see what will happen if we leave Iraq.

&gt; Are you starting to see the reality of the bigger picture now?
">

Bush said that when there is "success" in Iraq (whatever that means), we
would leave. Therefore, he believes that at some point, we will leave. When
that happens, the result will be the same as if we left now, since the Iraqi
army apparently has no interest in defending the country.

Their soldiers get one week of leave per month to bring their pay home to
their families. Many never return. You call that an army?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing is perfect.  I am pleased we are fighting terrorism.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The only fight against terrorism that's working is one that you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cannot see. It's not in the news.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This may be true.  I'm glad you recognize how invaluable the Patriot
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Act is.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think the Patriot Act has been very effective.  We've been kept
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; safe mostly because Airline cockpit doors are armored and kept locked,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there's widespread suspicion of anybody who looks Middle Eastern, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the war in Afghanistan has disrupted al Quada quite a bit (Why did al
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Quada bomb a train in Spain?  Because they couldn't bomb anything in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the US).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Unfortunately we're still not doing nearly enough about providing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; secular education in Afghanistan and Pakistan and countering the money
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the radical Saudis (the royal family) have been sending there for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; extremist religous schools.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I'd like to see a modern equivalent of the WWII victory garden effort,
&gt; &gt;&gt; but
&gt; &gt;&gt; with gasoline. If Americans (theoretically) approve of a pointless war to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;git them nasty terrorists&quot;, you'd think we could manage to direct some
&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; that (theoretical) anger toward each of us driving 20% less each week.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Too
&gt; &gt;&gt; bad the last 5 presidents have been so happy to blow the Saudis, rather
&gt; &gt;&gt; than
&gt; &gt;&gt; spank them for their part in this mess. Otherwise, one of them might have
&gt; &gt;&gt; the balls to say &quot;Look - money talks, but the Saudis don't believe we
&gt; &gt;&gt; have
&gt; &gt;&gt; the gumption to hit them in the pocket book. What do YOU all think?&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; For golf boy:
&gt; &gt;&gt; google world war II victory garden

&gt; &gt; Your cavalier attitude regarding terrorists. &quot;git them nasty
&gt; &gt; terrorists&quot;, is appalling.  It is apparent your innocent family members
&gt; &gt; weren't on one of the 9/11 planes or in either WTC building on 9/11, nor
&gt; &gt; do you show any compassion for the ones that were caught by the
&gt; &gt; terrorists that fateful day.

&gt; I don't see YOU making any sacrifices to combat terrorism. I'd bet a year's
&gt; pay that if Bush said everyone needed to use 20% less petroleum products
&gt; starting tomorrow, you'd cheat.

I'm already using less than the average driver and have been for years.

So you do acknowledge there is a terrorist threat.

No it doesn't. It means that any slip on our part can lead to our suffering

Too risky? What fucking risk? The terrorists are willing to die in the
attack. They do not consider risk if they have a willingness to die. They
are equally willing to die killing on victim as they are willing to die
killing hundreds, or thousands. Risk is not an assessment they make.

Bullshit. We are not in the crosshairs because we are in Iraq. We would be
in the crosshairs even if we were not in Iraq. Our presence in Iraq has
nothing to do with being in the crosshairs. Indeed, there is a strong
argument that the crosshairs are not in focus _because_ we are in Iraq.
Dialing in the focus only requires a radicalism that is not distracted by
where we are and what we are doing. If we were not in Iraq, the radicals
would have more time to work on the focusing dial for the crosshairs.

The radicals that we are facing have already declared thier war, it is
incumbant upon us to behave as if we are at war because they are at war. You
can not pretend you are not at war just because your head is up your ass,
muffling the sounds of the bombs going off.

Maybe we would be better off if the "terrorists" form a government and
organized army in Iraq in our absence.  Then we could go back in 5 years
from now with a coalition and at least have an army to fight.  We could do
the job right instead of screwing up as we did in Afghanistan.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Iraqi police have been infiltrated by every form of rat imaginable.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody trusts them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Insurgents seem to have found a new weapon: 13 year old kids loaded
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; explosives. No more pictures of American soldiers being friendly with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kids.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's over.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We just pissed off the Kurds, our only sorta kinda ally in the country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Got a plan?

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is worth a try.  Let's see what happens.  If results don't happen

&gt;&gt;&gt; then let the rest of the world take care of itself.  This perhaps will
&gt;&gt;&gt; be a wakeup call for the rest of those lazy nations not willing to pitch

my question:

What physical process, performed by our troops, is keeping bad guys from
leaving Iraq? "Killing them" is an incorrect answer, as is "finding them and

&gt; No it doesn't. It means that any slip on our part can lead to our
&gt; suffering another attack. Any means for any of several different fronts,
&gt; all means all. We can not protect 100% from any and all. It's silly to
&gt; assume that we can. Or insist that we do.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason is, to stop any and all terrorists attacks that might ever
&gt;&gt;&gt; happen, we have to be 100% right every minute of every day, forever.

&gt;&gt; Or just be perceived as too risky a target for the terrorists, as the
&gt;&gt; US has been since 9/11.

&gt; Too risky? What fucking risk? The terrorists are willing to die in the
&gt; attack. They do not consider risk if they have a willingness to die. They
&gt; are equally willing to die killing on victim as they are willing to die
&gt; killing hundreds, or thousands. Risk is not an assessment they make.
">

The risk of failing and NOT dying might be enough to deter them. Various
smart people in our government have commented that the huge network is
largely a myth. These are small cells operating independently, except for
sharing ideas. They probably want a high chance of success because they have
no real idea whether another group of loonies will step up and finish the
job for them.

That's a bit extreme, Jeff. If you go into a bar and talk to 20 people, are
you able to get a rough idea of who's been drinking too much? Of course you
are, and your evaluations would be based on their speech, unless someone
fell right off their bar stool onto the floor, in which speech would be
superfluous.

So, speech is one way of judging intelligence.

fight these nuts in Iraq without waiting to be attacked.  If this was going

The President has made a good decision.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So you do acknowledge there is a terrorist threat.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course. What a silly question.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Your turn:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Would you agree that since 9/11, there have been terrorist attacks in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; England, Spain and Indonesia?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there have been none here in the U.S.  That is what is important to me.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The other countries have to step up to the plate like we are doing in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; order to preserve their safety.  There is no free lunch.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt; &gt;&gt; Stick with me on this. You've said that our presence in Iraq is the
&gt; &gt;&gt; reason
&gt; &gt;&gt; this country hasn't been attacked. Does this mean our military kept bad
&gt; &gt;&gt; guys
&gt; &gt;&gt; from leaving Iraq and coming here?

&gt; &gt; One of the reasons.  We've also made some changes here at home to
&gt; &gt; discourage terrorists.  Armed crew and air marshals for a couple.
&gt; &gt; --

&gt; OK. I agree that changes here at home have helped. It's that other reason I
&gt; don't understand.

&gt; This leads to two questions:

&gt; ---  What physical functions in Iraq are keeping bad guys from leaving? I'm
&gt; referring to the ones who wish they could get here and do bad things. Border
&gt; patrols? I've heard no such thing, and it would be impossible anyway.

&gt; ---  Since Muslim terrorists have attacked England, Spain and Indonesia (as
&gt; we agreed earlier), why are American and British forces allowing them to
&gt; leave Iraq to attack those countries, but not the U.S.?
">

Basically they don't want to leave.  Rather, they would like to make
Iraq a new base of operation because they have been kicked out of Afgan.
Also, Iran is upset because we are so close to them now and syria.  We
are within striking distance.  This makes them feel uncomfortable.  Our
presences there upsets their whole apple cart, now rather than taking
the terrorism war to us, we are taking it to them and have been for
three years.  I think this is good, and it is my opinion.  Your milage
may vary.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The President has made a good decision.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The lousy rules of engagement were made to satisfy the Dims.

&gt; &gt;&gt; That was a mistake.

&gt; &gt;You're so full of crap. Bush ran the war exactly the way he wanted
&gt; &gt;it. Quit making excuses for that dimwit. Maybe you could give an
&gt; &gt;example of  how the &quot;Rules of engagemnt &quot; were changed to satisfy the
&gt; &gt;Dems? People, included many Democrats were questioning the troop levels
&gt; &gt;from the start. Rummy kept insisting that they had all the troops they
&gt; &gt;needed. Besides, wasn't that one of the things you said was so great
&gt; &gt;about Bush, that he didn't let politics or public opinion steer his
&gt; &gt;decision making?

&gt; You Dims and the drive by media forced the change in the rules of
&gt; engagement.

&gt; George W. Bush has tried a number of times to satisfy you cowards.

You'll need to explain what 1 has to do with "the rules of engagement"
and 2 is just repeat your unsubstatiate claim.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course. What a silly question.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Your turn:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Would you agree that since 9/11, there have been terrorist attacks
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; England, Spain and Indonesia?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there have been none here in the U.S.  That is what is important to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The other countries have to step up to the plate like we are doing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; order to preserve their safety.  There is no free lunch.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Stick with me on this. You've said that our presence in Iraq is the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reason
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this country hasn't been attacked. Does this mean our military kept
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bad
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; guys
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from leaving Iraq and coming here?

&gt;&gt; &gt; One of the reasons.  We've also made some changes here at home to
&gt;&gt; &gt; discourage terrorists.  Armed crew and air marshals for a couple.
&gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; OK. I agree that changes here at home have helped. It's that other reason
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; don't understand.

&gt;&gt; This leads to two questions:

&gt;&gt; ---  What physical functions in Iraq are keeping bad guys from leaving?
&gt;&gt; I'm
&gt;&gt; referring to the ones who wish they could get here and do bad things.
&gt;&gt; Border
&gt;&gt; patrols? I've heard no such thing, and it would be impossible anyway.

&gt;&gt; ---  Since Muslim terrorists have attacked England, Spain and Indonesia
&gt;&gt; (as
&gt;&gt; we agreed earlier), why are American and British forces allowing them to
&gt;&gt; leave Iraq to attack those countries, but not the U.S.?

&gt; Basically they don't want to leave.  Rather, they would like to make
&gt; Iraq a new base of operation because they have been kicked out of Afgan.
&gt; Also, Iran is upset because we are so close to them now and syria.  We
&gt; are within striking distance.  This makes them feel uncomfortable.  Our
&gt; presences there upsets their whole apple cart, now rather than taking
&gt; the terrorism war to us, we are taking it to them and have been for
&gt; three years.  I think this is good, and it is my opinion.  Your milage
&gt; may vary.
&gt; --

What you just said seems to contradict the theory that our presence in Iraq
has stopped terrorist attacks here.

I suspect that if you could waterboard your favorite (?) politician, in

budget. This is analogous to my attempts to hide $80.00 worth of fishing
lures in the health care part of my budget.

If you've asked me a question THIS AFTERNOON that I haven't answered, I'm
not aware of it. Perhaps my ISP's news server is missing a few messages,
something it does with annoying regularity. Post your question again.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That was a mistake.

&gt;&gt;You're so full of crap. Bush ran the war exactly the way he wanted
&gt;&gt;it. Quit making excuses for that dimwit. Maybe you could give an
&gt;&gt;example of  how the &quot;Rules of engagemnt &quot; were changed to satisfy the
&gt;&gt;Dems? People, included many Democrats were questioning the troop levels
&gt;&gt;from the start. Rummy kept insisting that they had all the troops they
&gt;&gt;needed. Besides, wasn't that one of the things you said was so great
&gt;&gt;about Bush, that he didn't let politics or public opinion steer his
&gt;&gt;decision making?

&gt; You Dims and the drive by media forced the change in the rules of
&gt; engagement.

&gt; George W. Bush has tried a number of times to satisfy you cowards.

&gt; That was a mistake, that is being changed.

&gt; You cowards are responsible for a NUMBER of unnecessary deaths of our
&gt; troops in Iraq.

&gt; IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STOP ANY AND ALL TERRORIST ATTACKS FROM EVER
&gt; HAPPENING. Not possible. Ever. At all.

&gt; &gt; &quot;Any and all&quot; or just &quot;all&quot;?  Because what you wrote means that every
&gt; &gt; attack will succeed, which hasn't been the track record.

&gt; No it doesn't. It means that any slip on our part can lead to our suffering
&gt; another attack. Any means for any of several different fronts, all means
&gt; all. We can not protect 100% from any and all. It's silly to assume that we
&gt; can. Or insist that we do.
">

Then why not just write, "IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STOP ALL TERRORIST
ATTACKS..."?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The reason is, to stop any and all terrorists attacks that might ever
&gt; happen, we have to be 100% right every minute of every day, forever.

&gt; &gt; Or just be perceived as too risky a target for the terrorists, as the
&gt; &gt; US has been since 9/11.

&gt; Too risky? What fucking risk? The terrorists are willing to die in the
&gt; attack.
">

But they don't want to fail or get caught, and they did take
precautions against that, such as by doing practice runs on the
airliners.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; While our presence in Iraq might not foil all terrorist attacks, there is
&gt; every reason to believe that our absence from Iraq would likely lead to
&gt; more  attacks.

&gt; &gt; But we'd be even safer if we had never invaded Iraq because there
&gt; &gt; wouldn't be any terrorists in Iraq (except in the north, where our
&gt; &gt; &quot;friends&quot; the Kurds are in control), Iran would have a formidable enemy
&gt; &gt; next door, and every one of our enemies would still be in awe of our
&gt; &gt; invasion of Afghanistan.

&gt; Bullshit. We are not in the crosshairs because we are in Iraq. We would be
&gt; in the crosshairs even if we were not in Iraq. Our presence in Iraq has
&gt; nothing to do with being in the crosshairs. Indeed, there is a strong
&gt; argument that the crosshairs are not in focus _because_ we are in Iraq.
&gt; Dialing in the focus only requires a radicalism that is not distracted by
&gt; where we are and what we are doing. If we were not in Iraq, the radicals
&gt; would have more time to work on the focusing dial for the crosshairs.
">

Wrong.  Iraq under Saddam had nothing to do with international
terrorism, according to the CIA, being one of only two Middle Eastern
nations with no al Quada presense (the other was Israel).  All the Iraq
war has done is let Islamist terrorists infiltrate Iraq, caused our
unwise President to divert forces from Afghanistan, and increased the
power of Iran.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The radicals that we are facing have already declared their war, it is
&gt; incumbant upon us to behave as if we are at war because they are at war.
">

And to not fall into the terrorists' trap, which in this case was a big
war in the heart of the Middle East, although bin Laden wanted it to
occur in Saudi Arabia, not Iraq.

Read about Arab pan-nationalism to learn why Saddam hated the Islamist

There's a fine line between "winning hearts and minds", which is bullshit,
and helping some group create unrest or topple their government. Then,
there's what we did in Afghanistan immediately after 9/11: Hand various
warlords bags containing huge amount of cash, in return for their
assistance, which they gave. (We've since blown that plan, but never mind).
I wonder where these types of cash payments fall, in terms of the
constitution.

Iran, Israel hold talks on longtime oil debt

ASSOCIATED PRESS

December 6, 2006

JERUSALEM - While Iran continues to deny that Israel has the right to
exist, representatives of the two countries are holding clandestine
talks in Europe to settle an old Israeli debt, a newspaper reported
today.

Iran is still owed hundreds of millions of dollars for oil it supplied
to Israel in the years before the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The two
countries, now sworn enemies, are holding contacts attempting to settle
the debt, according to the report in the daily Haaretz,  citing
anonymous Israeli and Swiss officials involved in the negotiations.
Israel and Iran had a close relationship in the 1950s, '60s and '70s,
when Iran was ruled by the pro-Western shah. Israeli companies were
given large construction contracts in Iran, and the countries
cooperated on security and weapons development. According to the
newspaper, a joint Israeli-Iranian company, Trans Asiatic Oil Ltd.,
supplied Iranian oil to Israel.

In 1979, when Shiite clerics ousted the shah, Iran cut off all contacts
with Israel, leaving an Iranian debt to Israeli companies for services
rendered and a much larger Israeli debt to Iranian oil suppliers,
according to the report.

Two mediation processes involving separate parts of the debt are
ongoing, the report said. A third ended in a ruling that Israeli fuel
companies owe Iran tens of millions of dollars.

But I don't, mostly because GW Bush did less to intercept the
terrorists in the first place, despite being warned repeatedly.  This
was probably mostly because his advisors told him that the #1 terrorist
threat was Iraq, not al Quada (early in his first term, Richard Clark
gave a presentation saying it was al Quada, then Condoleezza Rice spoke
next and said it was Iraq).  I'm credit the lack of further terrorist
attacks again since 9/11 to the armored aircraft cockpit doors and the

That's true, but the children of Iraq's Islamic revolution , who tend
to be pro-US, will start coming into power in just 20-30 years, which
is only a brief blip in the history of mankind..  I believe Saudi

there back then, maybe al Quada wouldn't have been able to hide there
so easily.

&gt; Then apparently you have no friends or acquaintances in those countries -

You are correct, (not self centered however).  I don't have any friends
or relatives in those countries.  However if I did, I would ask them to
please tell their government leaders to step up to the plate, join in
with the U.S. and President Bush fighting terrorism all over the globe.
It is in your best interest to do so.

Speaking of being self centered, why is it our democrat leaders want to
leave Iraq and leave their innocent citzens to a life of fear and
uncertainty?  Those folks have been through the mill and we are trying
to help them, the dimmorcrats want us to pack up and leave, that in my
opinion is self centered.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; addition of 20k more will push that number to 160k, and that you knew
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; as recently as mid-2005 we had more than 160k troops.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Does that mean the new surge of about 20K won't work either?

&gt; &gt; No, that is not what it means.

&gt; &gt; It only means that increasing by 20K is nothing to complain about.

&gt; If you think soldiers are objects made of plastic, than there's nothing to
&gt; complain about. In my mind, it's equivalent to a felony to use human beings
&gt; as part of an ill-conceived experiment. Hitler did that. Bush is doing it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So you do acknowledge there is a terrorist threat.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course. What a silly question.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Your turn:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Would you agree that since 9/11, there have been terrorist attacks in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; England, Spain and Indonesia?

&gt;&gt; &gt; there have been none here in the U.S.  That is what is important to me.

&gt;&gt; Then apparently you have no friends or acquaintances in those countries -
&gt;&gt; for whom you'd be concerned.

&gt;&gt; Or else are just plain self-centered.

&gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt; You are correct, (not self centered however).  I don't have any friends
&gt; or relatives in those countries.  However if I did, I would ask them to
&gt; please tell their government leaders to step up to the plate, join in
&gt; with the U.S. and President Bush fighting terrorism all over the globe.
&gt; It is in your best interest to do so.
">

Considering your use of Usenet (something like 67 ngs, IIRC?), you have
*some* sort of ties to people around the world, I'd imagine.  Ones with whom
you at least converse in cyberspace.

I have friends &amp; acquaintances in the U.K. and Italy.  When the London tube
&amp; bus bombs went off, I was just *hoping* they either weren't in London that
day, or at least weren't riding those particular trains &amp; that bus.

The U.K. had been on the ball via terrorism long before the U.S. ever
considered it, internally. (IRA ring a bell?)  And remember the (non-IRA)
terrorists they caught/thwarted at Heathrow, both years ago &amp; recently?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Many other countries took a look, said, "Hey, Saddam isn't the root of the
problem, re: global terrorism, so no thanks", &amp; apparently could foresee the
futility of entering such a war.  I'm surprised there are as many countries
as there are - providing their own troops, considering the opposition GWB
faced right from the beginning.

I'll tell ya what - you look at the link below, and if you still wonder if

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So you do acknowledge there is a terrorist threat.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course. What a silly question.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attacks
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Stick with me on this. You've said that our presence in Iraq is the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reason
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this country hasn't been attacked. Does this mean our military kept
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bad
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; guys
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from leaving Iraq and coming here?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One of the reasons.  We've also made some changes here at home to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; discourage terrorists.  Armed crew and air marshals for a couple.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What about our ports? (Acckkk! ===:-O)  What about the cargo holds of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; passenger planes?  (ditto)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt;&gt; Working on what?

&gt; Working on the ports, duh.....Cathy, have a tough day in class?

No, a pretty good day, actually.  I mentioned ports &amp; then planes' cargo
holds, but you didn't specify which (or maybe both?) you were talking about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt;  Why did you bring up ports?

&gt;&gt; Why?!?  Are you seriously asking this question, wondering why I might be
&gt;&gt; concerned about our ports' security?

&gt;&gt; Because they are incredibly vulnerable, w/ a tiny percentage of ships &amp;
&gt;&gt; cargo being inspected.  Anyone wants to sneak a nasty substance into this
&gt;&gt; country, just send it via container ship.

&gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt; Of course it's serious.

In that case, I don't understand your previous post.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there have been none here in the U.S.  That is what is important to me.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Then apparently you have no friends or acquaintances in those countries -
&gt; &gt;&gt; for whom you'd be concerned.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Or else are just plain self-centered.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt; &gt; You are correct, (not self centered however).  I don't have any friends
&gt; &gt; or relatives in those countries.  However if I did, I would ask them to
&gt; &gt; please tell their government leaders to step up to the plate, join in
&gt; &gt; with the U.S. and President Bush fighting terrorism all over the globe.
&gt; &gt; It is in your best interest to do so.

&gt; Considering your use of Usenet (something like 67 ngs, IIRC?), you have
&gt; *some* sort of ties to people around the world, I'd imagine.  Ones with whom
&gt; you at least converse in cyberspace.

&gt; I have friends &amp; acquaintances in the U.K. and Italy.  When the London tube
&gt; &amp; bus bombs went off, I was just *hoping* they either weren't in London that
&gt; day, or at least weren't riding those particular trains &amp; that bus.

&gt; The U.K. had been on the ball via terrorism long before the U.S. ever
&gt; considered it, internally. (IRA ring a bell?)  And remember the (non-IRA)
&gt; terrorists they caught/thwarted at Heathrow, both years ago &amp; recently?

&gt; &gt; Speaking of being self centered, why is it our democrat leaders want to
&gt; &gt; leave Iraq and leave their innocent citzens to a life of fear and
&gt; &gt; uncertainty?  Those folks have been through the mill and we are trying
&gt; &gt; to help them, the dimmorcrats want us to pack up and leave, that in my
&gt; &gt; opinion is self centered.

&gt; The mired mess has become more &amp; more mired and violent with our &quot;help&quot;.

Your opinion of course.

&gt; Many other countries took a look, said, &quot;Hey, Saddam isn't the root of the
&gt; problem, re: global terrorism, so no thanks&quot;, &amp; apparently could foresee the
&gt; futility of entering such a war.  I'm surprised there are as many countries

Many other countries have decided that let's let the U.S. do the dirty
work for us, then we will reap the bennies.  They are slackers, nothing
new.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So you do acknowledge there is a terrorist threat.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course. What a silly question.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Your turn:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Would you agree that since 9/11, there have been terrorist attacks
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; England, Spain and Indonesia?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there have been none here in the U.S.  That is what is important to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Then apparently you have no friends or acquaintances in those
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; countries -
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for whom you'd be concerned.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Or else are just plain self-centered.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt;&gt; &gt; You are correct, (not self centered however).  I don't have any friends
&gt;&gt; &gt; or relatives in those countries.  However if I did, I would ask them to
&gt;&gt; &gt; please tell their government leaders to step up to the plate, join in
&gt;&gt; &gt; with the U.S. and President Bush fighting terrorism all over the globe.
&gt;&gt; &gt; It is in your best interest to do so.

&gt;&gt; Considering your use of Usenet (something like 67 ngs, IIRC?), you have
&gt;&gt; *some* sort of ties to people around the world, I'd imagine.  Ones with
&gt;&gt; whom
&gt;&gt; you at least converse in cyberspace.

&gt;&gt; I have friends &amp; acquaintances in the U.K. and Italy.  When the London
&gt;&gt; tube
&gt;&gt; &amp; bus bombs went off, I was just *hoping* they either weren't in London
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; day, or at least weren't riding those particular trains &amp; that bus.

&gt;&gt; The U.K. had been on the ball via terrorism long before the U.S. ever
&gt;&gt; considered it, internally. (IRA ring a bell?)  And remember the (non-IRA)
&gt;&gt; terrorists they caught/thwarted at Heathrow, both years ago &amp; recently?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Speaking of being self centered, why is it our democrat leaders want to
&gt;&gt; &gt; leave Iraq and leave their innocent citzens to a life of fear and
&gt;&gt; &gt; uncertainty?  Those folks have been through the mill and we are trying
&gt;&gt; &gt; to help them, the dimmorcrats want us to pack up and leave, that in my
&gt;&gt; &gt; opinion is self centered.

&gt;&gt; The mired mess has become more &amp; more mired and violent with our &quot;help&quot;.

&gt; Your opinion of course.
">

You do not think it is a mired mess, &amp; that it hasn't become more violent?
From GWB's speech, even *he* thinks so.  And it took a few years for it to
sink in, in his case.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Stick with me on this. You've said that our presence in Iraq is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reason
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this country hasn't been attacked. Does this mean our military
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; kept
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bad
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; guys
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from leaving Iraq and coming here?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One of the reasons.  We've also made some changes here at home to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; discourage terrorists.  Armed crew and air marshals for a couple.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What about our ports? (Acckkk! ===:-O)  What about the cargo holds
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; passenger planes?  (ditto)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; working on that too.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Working on what?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Working on the ports, duh.....Cathy, have a tough day in class?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Why did you bring up ports?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why?!?  Are you seriously asking this question, wondering why I might
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; concerned about our ports' security?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Because they are incredibly vulnerable, w/ a tiny percentage of ships
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &amp;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cargo being inspected.  Anyone wants to sneak a nasty substance into
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; country, just send it via container ship.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course it's serious.

&gt;&gt; Idiot. You made it sound as if you thought the problem was not important,
&gt;&gt; by

Holy crap, I sure do.  You implied that I was suggesting something which was
way out in left field, re: the lack of security at our ports &amp; for the goods

Any time you see "this v. that", like United Haulers Assn., Inc. v.
Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority (from the web page), it's a
court case with two opponents. Government v. person, person v. corporation,
etc. I have no idea about the details of Marbury v. Madison, but the letter
"v" with a period means it's a court case.

Haven't you ever watched ANY legal dramas, going back as far as Perry
Mason???

&gt; I have friends &amp; acquaintances in the U.K. and Italy.  When the London tube
&gt; &amp; bus bombs went off, I was just *hoping* they either weren't in London that
&gt; day, or at least weren't riding those particular trains &amp; that bus.

&gt; The U.K. had been on the ball via terrorism long before the U.S. ever
&gt; considered it, internally. (IRA ring a bell?)  And remember the (non-IRA)
&gt; terrorists they caught/thwarted at Heathrow, both years ago &amp; recently?

&gt; &gt; Speaking of being self centered, why is it our democrat leaders want to
&gt; &gt; leave Iraq and leave their innocent citzens to a life of fear and
&gt; &gt; uncertainty?  Those folks have been through the mill and we are trying
&gt; &gt; to help them, the dimmorcrats want us to pack up and leave, that in my
&gt; &gt; opinion is self centered.

&gt; The mired mess has become more &amp; more mired and violent with our &quot;help&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The other countries have to step up to the plate like we are doing in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; order to preserve their safety.  There is no free lunch.

&gt; Many other countries took a look, said, &quot;Hey, Saddam isn't the root of the
&gt; problem, re: global terrorism, so no thanks&quot;, &amp; apparently could foresee the
&gt; futility of entering such a war.  I'm surprised there are as many countries

Have we had any terrorist attacks, here in the CONUS?  We have had in
the last hours an attack on our embassy in Greece, however, it has not
been determined to be a terrorist attack.  So have we?  Your answer
please.

I cannot speak for our friends in the U.K., but perhaps they did not
have adequate security.  Now, I would expect the U.K. has reviewed their
security and made adjustments.  That goes for Spain also.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm not kidding.  What is your answer?  Is it?  You asked the question
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and I answered you, now I want your response.  What is your answer?

&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll tell ya what - you look at the link below, and if you still wonder
&gt; &gt;&gt; if
&gt; &gt;&gt; Marbury v. Madison is part of the constitution, I will be polite and

&gt; &gt;&gt; next
&gt; &gt;&gt; post will answer your question, if you still have one.

&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the link:
&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts.html

&gt; &gt; Well, I'll tell ya Joe, I know what the constitution says and all of the
&gt; &gt; amendments, frankly I could not find anything regarding Marbury v.
&gt; &gt; Madison that was part of it, nothing.  The link you posted shows
&gt; &gt; arguments not decisions, further, they only go back to the year 2000.
&gt; &gt; How does that relate to the Constitution?  Explain.  Further, I could
&gt; &gt; not find anything in the link you posted that related to Marbury v.
&gt; &gt; Madison.  It appears that you are just leading me on.  I am not

&gt; Any time you see &quot;this v. that&quot;, like United Haulers Assn., Inc. v.
&gt; Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority (from the web page), it's a
&gt; court case with two opponents. Government v. person, person v. corporation,
&gt; etc. I have no idea about the details of Marbury v. Madison, but the letter
&gt; &quot;v&quot; with a period means it's a court case.

&gt; Haven't you ever watched ANY legal dramas, going back as far as Perry
&gt; Mason???
">

The letter "v." means versus, as in "opposed to".  It is used in legal
language and court cases such as you have presented.

I don't watch much TV, except for C-SPAN Joe, thankyou.

So let's hear from you in your own words some answers of some of my

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; England, Spain and Indonesia?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there have been none here in the U.S.  That is what is important to

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for whom you'd be concerned.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Or else are just plain self-centered.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You are correct, (not self centered however).  I don't have any friends

Well, I don't for a minute think that it isn't a mess, but is it worth
the effort?  I think it is, in my opinion it is.  I don't think we, you
and I can know what this event has on the future, but it seems, in my
opinion again and others which share the same opinion, this islamic
terrorist movement is a threat, a very large threat on our way of life.
History will only be the judge of that.  If we are successful, history

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course. What a silly question.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Your turn:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Would you agree that since 9/11, there have been terrorist
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attacks
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; England, Spain and Indonesia?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there have been none here in the U.S.  That is what is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; important
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The other countries have to step up to the plate like we are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; order to preserve their safety.  There is no free lunch.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Stick with me on this. You've said that our presence in Iraq is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reason
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this country hasn't been attacked. Does this mean our military
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; kept
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bad
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; guys
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from leaving Iraq and coming here?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One of the reasons.  We've also made some changes here at home to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; discourage terrorists.  Armed crew and air marshals for a couple.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What about our ports? (Acckkk! ===:-O)  What about the cargo holds
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; passenger planes?  (ditto)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; working on that too.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Working on what?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Working on the ports, duh.....Cathy, have a tough day in class?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Why did you bring up ports?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why?!?  Are you seriously asking this question, wondering why I might
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; concerned about our ports' security?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Because they are incredibly vulnerable, w/ a tiny percentage of ships
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &amp;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cargo being inspected.  Anyone wants to sneak a nasty substance into
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; country, just send it via container ship.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Of course it's serious.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Idiot. You made it sound as if you thought the problem was not important,
&gt; &gt;&gt; by
&gt; &gt;&gt; saying &quot;the dimmies brought it up&quot;. Your style has changed since earlier
&gt; &gt;&gt; today. When you are drinking, you should proofread your messages 3 times
&gt; &gt;&gt; before sending them.

&gt; &gt; I don't see anything above to indicate what you said is true.

&gt; Holy crap, I sure do.  You implied that I was suggesting something which was
&gt; way out in left field, re: the lack of security at our ports &amp; for the goods
&gt; in planes' cargo holds.

&gt; Cathy
">

You mention airplanes also.  I thought you were referring to cargo ships
only.  I am quite confident our airlines are well taken care of.  I'm
not so sure of our cargo ships, like container ships and all the cargo
they transport here are 100 percent safe.  Of course, nothing will be
100 percent safe, you should know that from your school district
training, right?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   I don't
&gt; &gt; know what you mean by &quot;drinking&quot;.  Could you elaborate a little
&gt; &gt; regarding that comment?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You ***MUST*** be kidding, or trolling. Please tell me you're
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; serious.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You're really asking that question?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm not kidding.  What is your answer?  Is it?  You asked the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; question
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and I answered you, now I want your response.  What is your answer?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll tell ya what - you look at the link below, and if you still
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wonder
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; if
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Marbury v. Madison is part of the constitution, I will be polite and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; answer
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that question. Deal? You look at the web page, and then I promise - my
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; next
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; post will answer your question, if you still have one.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the link:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts.html

&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, I'll tell ya Joe, I know what the constitution says and all of
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; amendments, frankly I could not find anything regarding Marbury v.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Madison that was part of it, nothing.  The link you posted shows
&gt;&gt; &gt; arguments not decisions, further, they only go back to the year 2000.
&gt;&gt; &gt; How does that relate to the Constitution?  Explain.  Further, I could
&gt;&gt; &gt; not find anything in the link you posted that related to Marbury v.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Madison.  It appears that you are just leading me on.  I am not
&gt;&gt; &gt; insincere, but it appears you are.  Are you?

&gt;&gt; &gt; You have not answered my question.  Instead you posted a link.  I want
&gt;&gt; &gt; you to directly, in your own words to answer my questions, in YOUR own
&gt;&gt; &gt; words Joe.  Don't post any links again.  Joe.....your turn bud.
&gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; Any time you see &quot;this v. that&quot;, like United Haulers Assn., Inc. v.
&gt;&gt; Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority (from the web page),
&gt;&gt; it's a
&gt;&gt; court case with two opponents. Government v. person, person v.
&gt;&gt; corporation,
&gt;&gt; etc. I have no idea about the details of Marbury v. Madison, but the
&gt;&gt; letter
&gt;&gt; &quot;v&quot; with a period means it's a court case.

&gt;&gt; Haven't you ever watched ANY legal dramas, going back as far as Perry
&gt;&gt; Mason???

&gt; The letter &quot;v.&quot; means versus, as in &quot;opposed to&quot;.  It is used in legal
&gt; language and court cases such as you have presented.

&gt; I don't watch much TV, except for C-SPAN Joe, thankyou.

&gt; So let's hear from you in your own words some answers of some of my
&gt; questions.  Don't be afraid of rebuttle

&gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference between cause and correlation?

&gt; Could you explain, in your own words please.  Don't present a link,

Cause:
I shoot you 15 times in the chest and head. You die. My shooting you was the
cause of death.

Correlation:
A Greek restaurant serves lots of chickpeas. 100 regular customers who love
chickpeas get the exact same cancer. An idiot thinks the chickpeas are the
cause, when in fact, it was pesticides incorrectly applied too close to open
containers of dried chickpeas. The chickpeas were correlated to the cancer,
but not the cause.

When pigs can fly, you'll be able to apply this analogy to our invasion of
Iraq, and the theory that our presence there has prevented further terrorist
attacks in this country.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You ***MUST*** be kidding, or trolling. Please tell me you're
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; serious.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You're really asking that question?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm not kidding.  What is your answer?  Is it?  You asked the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; question
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and I answered you, now I want your response.  What is your answer?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll tell ya what - you look at the link below, and if you still
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wonder
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; if
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Marbury v. Madison is part of the constitution, I will be polite and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; answer
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that question. Deal? You look at the web page, and then I promise - my
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; next
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; post will answer your question, if you still have one.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the link:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts.html

&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, I'll tell ya Joe, I know what the constitution says and all of
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; amendments, frankly I could not find anything regarding Marbury v.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Madison that was part of it, nothing.  The link you posted shows
&gt;&gt; &gt; arguments not decisions, further, they only go back to the year 2000.
&gt;&gt; &gt; How does that relate to the Constitution?  Explain.  Further, I could
&gt;&gt; &gt; not find anything in the link you posted that related to Marbury v.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Madison.  It appears that you are just leading me on.  I am not
&gt;&gt; &gt; insincere, but it appears you are.  Are you?

&gt;&gt; &gt; You have not answered my question.  Instead you posted a link.  I want
&gt;&gt; &gt; you to directly, in your own words to answer my questions, in YOUR own
&gt;&gt; &gt; words Joe.  Don't post any links again.  Joe.....your turn bud.
&gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; Any time you see &quot;this v. that&quot;, like United Haulers Assn., Inc. v.
&gt;&gt; Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority (from the web page),
&gt;&gt; it's a
&gt;&gt; court case with two opponents. Government v. person, person v.
&gt;&gt; corporation,
&gt;&gt; etc. I have no idea about the details of Marbury v. Madison, but the
&gt;&gt; letter
&gt;&gt; &quot;v&quot; with a period means it's a court case.

&gt;&gt; Haven't you ever watched ANY legal dramas, going back as far as Perry
&gt;&gt; Mason???

&gt; The letter &quot;v.&quot; means versus, as in &quot;opposed to&quot;.  It is used in legal
&gt; language and court cases such as you have presented.

&gt; I don't watch much TV, except for C-SPAN Joe, thankyou.

&gt; So let's hear from you in your own words some answers of some of my
&gt; questions.  Don't be afraid of rebuttle, it's good for you, it will
&gt; enable you to think deeper.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this is the first time I've ever agreed with you. While the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exact words you spout here are accurate, I can't help but wonder if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand what they mean.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STOP ANY AND ALL TERRORIST ATTACKS FROM EVER
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HAPPENING. Not possible. Ever. At all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason is, to stop any and all terrorists attacks that might ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen, we have to be 100% right every minute of every day, forever. If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you really want to be free of any terrorist attack, then you are living
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a dream world. It is impossible to protect against terrorist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; atttack. The very best we can hope for is to derail a few attacks on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occasion, and to respond better to any attack once it has happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While our presence in Iraq might not foil all terrorist attacks, there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is every reason to believe that our absence from Iraq would likely lead
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to more attacks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which &quot;every reason&quot;, Jeff?  How many people does it take to carry out a
&gt;&gt;&gt; sophisticated attack? 5? 10? 15?

&gt;&gt; 1 person can kill thousands if he does it right.

&gt;&gt; We have not, and cannot seal the borders
&gt;&gt;&gt; or Iraq, nor have we tried. If a group wants out, they'll get out.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully, they will have a harder time getting INTO this country than
&gt;&gt;&gt; OUT of Iraq.

&gt;&gt; But, we cherish our right to travel freely, this demands that our borders
&gt;&gt; be porous to a certain degree. If you want security, then you have to
&gt;&gt; accept a police state. And, I'm not convinced a police state will secure
&gt;&gt; you, or me ...

&gt; You said &quot;there is every reason to believe our absence from Iraq would
&gt; likely lead to more attacks&quot;.

Yes, I did.

For reasons I'll explain later, it would be

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; great if you didn't follow up this message until 4-5 hours from now.
&gt; Here's my question:
">

I follow up when I'm here, but I can't be here all of the time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What physical process, performed by our troops, is keeping bad guys from
&gt; leaving Iraq? &quot;Killing them&quot; is an incorrect answer, as is &quot;finding them
&gt; and throwing them in prison&quot;.
">

There is no direct physical process, I suppose. but, the fact is that our
presence in Iraq is at the very least a distraction to them, and they seem
to fixate on the distractions over there instead of make new attacks here.

If we pull our troops out, two things happen. 1.) the distraction vanishes
and they set about with new plans for over here. And, 2.) if we pull out, it
will appear that we haven't the fortitude to stick it out long enough to
defeat them. Having said that, defeating them will be exceedingly difficult,
assuming it is even possible. I happen to think that it is possible, but it
will be a bloodbath that I think the vast majority hasn't the stomach for.
It will require us to blow up mosques, which we will not do, or we take
great pains to avoid doing. It will require us to kill innocent men women
and children, again, we are not willing to do that. The problem we face is,
our attackers are will ing to blow up our houses of worship, and attack
innocent men women and children.

You see, my solution is precisely that which you dismiss before I can even
get the first word out. As long as we are confined in our actions by people
that think like you, radical Islam will have the upper hand because they
have no confines at all. The lack of morality gives them a distinct
advantage. I accept that we have to abandon our morality if we hope to
defeat them in the long run, and we are not willing to do that. I am
willing, but I am probably in a minority on that point.

&gt;&gt; Too risky? What fucking risk? The terrorists are willing to die in the
&gt;&gt; attack.

&gt; But they don't want to fail or get caught, and they did take
&gt; precautions against that, such as by doing practice runs on the

Fail? They are willing to take out as few as one other person and consider
it a victory. I suppose there is a risk they get nobody, but that would not
be much of a terrorist attack, would it?

&gt;&gt; &gt; wouldn't be any terrorists in Iraq (except in the north, where our

&gt;&gt; Bullshit. We are not in the crosshairs because we are in Iraq. We would
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; in the crosshairs even if we were not in Iraq. Our presence in Iraq has
&gt;&gt; nothing to do with being in the crosshairs. Indeed, there is a strong
&gt;&gt; argument that the crosshairs are not in focus _because_ we are in Iraq.
&gt;&gt; Dialing in the focus only requires a radicalism that is not distracted by
&gt;&gt; where we are and what we are doing. If we were not in Iraq, the radicals
&gt;&gt; would have more time to work on the focusing dial for the crosshairs.

&gt; Wrong.  Iraq under Saddam had nothing to do with international
&gt; terrorism, according to the CIA, being one of only two Middle Eastern
&gt; nations with no al Quada presense (the other was Israel).  All the Iraq
&gt; war has done is let Islamist terrorists infiltrate Iraq, caused our

Dizzy, these people are prepared to die. Do you REALLY think they are
bothered by being captured instead.

First of all, let me bring up a bit of history for you. Terrorist bad guys
have been captured and put in jails all around the globe. OTHER terrorist
bad guys have stolen dozens of planes and demanded the release of the jailed
bad guys as a condition to give the airplane and its passengers back. These
guys don't care if they get caught because another bad guy will step into
the void and hijack a plane and demand the release of his jailed comrade(s).

They face no risk, certainly no risk that they care about.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you really want to be free of any terrorist attack, then you are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; living in a dream world. It is impossible to protect against terrorist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; atttack. The very best we can hope for is to derail a few attacks on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occasion, and to respond better to any attack once it has happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While our presence in Iraq might not foil all terrorist attacks, there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is every reason to believe that our absence from Iraq would likely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lead to more attacks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which &quot;every reason&quot;, Jeff?  How many people does it take to carry out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a sophisticated attack? 5? 10? 15?

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 person can kill thousands if he does it right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We have not, and cannot seal the borders
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or Iraq, nor have we tried. If a group wants out, they'll get out.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully, they will have a harder time getting INTO this country than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OUT of Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But, we cherish our right to travel freely, this demands that our
&gt;&gt;&gt; borders be porous to a certain degree. If you want security, then you
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to accept a police state. And, I'm not convinced a police state
&gt;&gt;&gt; will secure you, or me ...

&gt;&gt; You said &quot;there is every reason to believe our absence from Iraq would

&gt;&gt; What physical process, performed by our troops, is keeping bad guys from
&gt;&gt; leaving Iraq? &quot;Killing them&quot; is an incorrect answer, as is &quot;finding them
&gt;&gt; and throwing them in prison&quot;.

&gt; There is no direct physical process, I suppose. but, the fact is that our
&gt; presence in Iraq is at the very least a distraction to them, and they seem
&gt; to fixate on the distractions over there instead of make new attacks here.

&gt; If we pull our troops out, two things happen. 1.) the distraction vanishes
&gt; and they set about with new plans for over here. And, 2.) if we pull out,
&gt; it will appear that we haven't the fortitude to stick it out long enough
&gt; to defeat them. Having said that, defeating them will be exceedingly
&gt; difficult, assuming it is even possible. I happen to think that it is
&gt; possible, but it will be a bloodbath that I think the vast majority hasn't
&gt; the stomach for. It will require us to blow up mosques, which we will not
&gt; do, or we take great pains to avoid doing. It will require us to kill
&gt; innocent men women and children, again, we are not willing to do that. The
&gt; problem we face is, our attackers are will ing to blow up our houses of
&gt; worship, and attack innocent men women and children.

&gt; You see, my solution is precisely that which you dismiss before I can even
&gt; get the first word out. As long as we are confined in our actions by
&gt; people that think like you, radical Islam will have the upper hand because
&gt; they have no confines at all. The lack of morality gives them a distinct
&gt; advantage. I accept that we have to abandon our morality if we hope to
&gt; defeat them in the long run, and we are not willing to do that. I am
&gt; willing, but I am probably in a minority on that point.
">

This all assumes that those who want to harm us are happy to do it 2-3
soldiers at a time in Iraq. But, I'm convinced there are plenty who want to
do it HERE, on a grand scale, like 9/11. They haven't done it yet. Our
presence in Iraq has no effect on them. If such people are in Iraq and want
to leave, they can do so any time they want. We won't stop them, unless by
pure luck. What's more likely to stop them is security at 2-3 airports, and
spooks. If they come from elsewhere, it'll be spooks that stop them.

What are we spending in Iraq per month? I don't know any more. I thought it
was 4 billion. Meanwhile, every few years, the NSA goes begging.

There are a few corporations whose operations are a model for other
companies, in terms of efficiency. I'd like to see the government tap one of
those CEOs to run both NSA and FBI. Offer him/her some insane salary, and
give them carte blanche to hire and fire ANYONE, with complete impunity.
Infighting between FBI &amp; CIA? Make heads roll. Give no consideration to
which senator's kid got a job as a favor, or which deputy director plays
golf with the vice president. If some positions work better with people who
are not team players, leave them alone. For other positions, if cowboys are
causing difficulty, fire them.

Spooks are what will stop terrorism. Years ago, NSA managed to bug Anwar
Sadat's office, home and car, even though Egyptian security is notoriously
tight. We should be able to manage terrorists.

Right.  Which then means that it is not only impossible to thwart all
attacks (agree), but _also_ impossible to thwart *any* attacks (disagree).

&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason is, to stop any and all terrorists attacks that might ever

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Or just be perceived as too risky a target for the terrorists, as the

&gt;&gt;&gt; Too risky? What fucking risk? The terrorists are willing to die in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; attack.

&gt;&gt; But they don't want to fail or get caught, and they did take
&gt;&gt; precautions against that, such as by doing practice runs on the
&gt;&gt; airliners.

&gt; Fail? They are willing to take out as few as one other person and consider
&gt; it a victory. I suppose there is a risk they get nobody, but that would
&gt; not be much of a terrorist attack, would it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; While our presence in Iraq might not foil all terrorist attacks, there
&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; every reason to believe that our absence from Iraq would likely lead to
&gt;&gt;&gt; more  attacks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; But we'd be even safer if we had never invaded Iraq because there
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; wouldn't be any terrorists in Iraq (except in the north, where our
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;friends&quot; the Kurds are in control), Iran would have a formidable
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; enemy
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; next door, and every one of our enemies would still be in awe of our
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; invasion of Afghanistan.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit. We are not in the crosshairs because we are in Iraq. We would
&gt;&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the crosshairs even if we were not in Iraq. Our presence in Iraq has
&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing to do with being in the crosshairs. Indeed, there is a strong
&gt;&gt;&gt; argument that the crosshairs are not in focus _because_ we are in Iraq.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dialing in the focus only requires a radicalism that is not distracted
&gt;&gt;&gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt; where we are and what we are doing. If we were not in Iraq, the radicals
&gt;&gt;&gt; would have more time to work on the focusing dial for the crosshairs.

&gt;&gt; Wrong.  Iraq under Saddam had nothing to do with international
&gt;&gt; terrorism, according to the CIA, being one of only two Middle Eastern
&gt;&gt; nations with no al Quada presense (the other was Israel).  All the Iraq
&gt;&gt; war has done is let Islamist terrorists infiltrate Iraq, caused our
&gt;&gt; unwise President to divert forces from Afghanistan, and increased the

Not really. We *are* losing our grip on Afghanistan, although it's not as up
front in the news. Warlords we bought right after 9/11 are disgusted because
the country's not much better off than when the war began. Pakistan doesn't
know how to handle the tribes on its borders, and the Taliban is regrouping.
So yes, we have been distracted from the place closest to where OBL is
believed to be.

&gt;&gt;&gt;words you spout here are accurate, I can't help but wonder if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;understand
&gt;&gt;&gt;what they mean.

&gt;&gt;&gt;IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STOP ANY AND ALL TERRORIST ATTACKS FROM EVER
&gt;&gt;&gt;HAPPENING. Not possible. Ever. At all.

&gt;&gt; Can you be any more obvious, idiot?

&gt;&gt;&gt;While our presence in Iraq might not foil all terrorist attacks, there is
&gt;&gt;&gt;every reason to believe that our absence from Iraq would likely lead to
&gt;&gt;&gt;more
&gt;&gt;&gt;attacks.

&gt;&gt; Dumbshit liar.  There is ZERO reason to believe that our absence from
&gt;&gt; Iraq would likely lead to more attacks.

&gt;&gt; Invading Iraq HAS NOT and DOES NOT make us safer from terrorists.

&gt;By the same token, it hasn't hurt us either.

Lying asshole.

It's hurt us financially.  It's hurt us by losing soldiers.  It's hurt
us by pissing-off a lot of people, both allies and non-allies.  It
hurt us by limiting our options with Iran and Korea.

&gt; Bullshit. We are not in the crosshairs because we are in Iraq. We would

&gt; nothing to do with being in the crosshairs. Indeed, there is a strong

&gt; &gt; Wrong.  Iraq under Saddam had nothing to do with international
&gt; &gt; terrorism, according to the CIA, being one of only two Middle Eastern
&gt; &gt; nations with no al Quada presense (the other was Israel).  All the Iraq
&gt; &gt; war has done is let Islamist terrorists infiltrate Iraq, caused our

How so?  Fundamentalist Iran is no longer held in check by secular
Iraq, toppling Saddam turned Iraq into a huge base for international
terrorists, who have quite a bit of free reign in Anbar province, and
our problems in Iraq make us look weak to Iran, terrorists, North
Korea, and even Russia and China.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I think the average American who has no family in the military has
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not experienced any difficulty or change of lifestyle, no
&gt;&gt;&gt; sacrifices &gt;&gt;&gt; whatsoever, in this war.  It may be a good idea to
&gt;&gt;&gt; enforce &gt;&gt;&gt; rationing to give people a taste of what will happen if
&gt;&gt;&gt; we lose in &gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq.  Supporting the troops requires much more than
&gt;&gt;&gt; putting a &gt;&gt;&gt; sticker on your back bumper.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you on some sort of medication? What kind of rationing will be
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; likely if we lose in Iraq?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Petroleum products.  Iran will own some 20% of the world's oil
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; reserves, they will manipulate all the European countries into
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; giving them technology.  They will also have created nuclear
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; weapons and finally they will be training and supplying terrorists
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; with impunity since no one will be able do anything about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Interesting that you mention all this at this particular time.

&gt;&gt; I have mentioned all this before in my conversations with DH.  It's
&gt;&gt; really not that difficult to see what will happen if we leave Iraq.

&gt;&gt; Are you starting to see the reality of the bigger picture now?

&gt; Bush said that when there is &quot;success&quot; in Iraq (whatever that means), we
&gt; would leave. Therefore, he believes that at some point, we will leave.
&gt; When that happens, the result will be the same as if we left now, since
&gt; the Iraqi army apparently has no interest in defending the country.

&gt; Their soldiers get one week of leave per month to bring their pay home to
&gt; their families. Many never return. You call that an army?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing is perfect.  I am pleased we are fighting terrorism.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The only fight against terrorism that's working is one that you
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cannot see. It's not in the news.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This may be true.  I'm glad you recognize how invaluable the Patriot
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Act is.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think the Patriot Act has been very effective.  We've been
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; kept
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; safe mostly because Airline cockpit doors are armored and kept locked,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; there's widespread suspicion of anybody who looks Middle Eastern, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the war in Afghanistan has disrupted al Quada quite a bit (Why did al
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Quada bomb a train in Spain?  Because they couldn't bomb anything in
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the US).

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Unfortunately we're still not doing nearly enough about providing
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; secular education in Afghanistan and Pakistan and countering the money
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the radical Saudis (the royal family) have been sending there for
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; extremist religous schools.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd like to see a modern equivalent of the WWII victory garden effort,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt; with gasoline. If Americans (theoretically) approve of a pointless war
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;git them nasty terrorists&quot;, you'd think we could manage to direct some
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; that (theoretical) anger toward each of us driving 20% less each week.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Too
&gt;&gt;&gt; bad the last 5 presidents have been so happy to blow the Saudis, rather
&gt;&gt;&gt; than
&gt;&gt;&gt; spank them for their part in this mess. Otherwise, one of them might
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; the balls to say &quot;Look - money talks, but the Saudis don't believe we
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; the gumption to hit them in the pocket book. What do YOU all think?&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; For golf boy:
&gt;&gt;&gt; google world war II victory garden

&gt;&gt; Your cavalier attitude regarding terrorists. &quot;git them nasty
&gt;&gt; terrorists&quot;, is appalling.  It is apparent your innocent family members
&gt;&gt; weren't on one of the 9/11 planes or in either WTC building on 9/11, nor
&gt;&gt; do you show any compassion for the ones that were caught by the
&gt;&gt; terrorists that fateful day.

&gt; I don't see YOU making any sacrifices to combat terrorism. I'd bet a
&gt; year's pay that if Bush said everyone needed to use 20% less petroleum
&gt; products starting tomorrow, you'd cheat.

You're thinking that terrorists who carry out attacks in foreign lands
are easily replaceable, and I contend that they're the most highly
trained members of their groups and are rather scarce, not just because
of the level of talent but also due to budgetary constraints (I don't
believe that all the 9/11 hijackers had taken flying lessons).  And not
all terrorists were expected to go on suicide missions -- in the 1970s
the PLO had retirement plans for their terrorists to prevent them from
becoming rogues who could endanger the PLO itself.

It has hurt us by a huge amount and will continue to hurt us for at

took over Afghanistan, and it hurt our moral standing so much that our
Allies are less likely to help us, and we can no longer scold
authoritarian nations about human rights or the importance of obeying
international law.  Colin Powell had warned GW Bush in 2002 that all
the goodwill we had built up just after 9/11 would vanish if we invaded
Iraq, and he was right.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You're really asking that question?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm not kidding.  What is your answer?  Is it?  You asked the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; question
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and I answered you, now I want your response.  What is your answer?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll tell ya what - you look at the link below, and if you still
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wonder
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; if
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Marbury v. Madison is part of the constitution, I will be polite and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; answer
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that question. Deal? You look at the web page, and then I promise - my
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; next
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; post will answer your question, if you still have one.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the link:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, I'll tell ya Joe, I know what the constitution says and all of

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Madison that was part of it, nothing.  The link you posted shows
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; arguments not decisions, further, they only go back to the year 2000.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How does that relate to the Constitution?  Explain.  Further, I could
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not find anything in the link you posted that related to Marbury v.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Madison.  It appears that you are just leading me on.  I am not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; insincere, but it appears you are.  Are you?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt; &gt;&gt; Any time you see &quot;this v. that&quot;, like United Haulers Assn., Inc. v.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority (from the web page),
&gt; &gt;&gt; it's a
&gt; &gt;&gt; court case with two opponents. Government v. person, person v.
&gt; &gt;&gt; corporation,
&gt; &gt;&gt; etc. I have no idea about the details of Marbury v. Madison, but the
&gt; &gt;&gt; letter
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;v&quot; with a period means it's a court case.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Haven't you ever watched ANY legal dramas, going back as far as Perry
&gt; &gt;&gt; Mason???

&gt; &gt; The letter &quot;v.&quot; means versus, as in &quot;opposed to&quot;.  It is used in legal
&gt; &gt; language and court cases such as you have presented.

&gt; &gt; I don't watch much TV, except for C-SPAN Joe, thankyou.

&gt; &gt; So let's hear from you in your own words some answers of some of my
&gt; &gt; questions.  Don't be afraid of rebuttle, it's good for you, it will
&gt; &gt; enable you to think deeper.

&gt; If you understood what the &quot;v.&quot; meant, why did you ask?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Of course it's serious.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Idiot. You made it sound as if you thought the problem was not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; important,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; saying &quot;the dimmies brought it up&quot;. Your style has changed since
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; earlier
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; today. When you are drinking, you should proofread your messages 3
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; times
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; before sending them.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't see anything above to indicate what you said is true.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Holy crap, I sure do.  You implied that I was suggesting something which
&gt; &gt;&gt; was
&gt; &gt;&gt; way out in left field, re: the lack of security at our ports &amp; for the
&gt; &gt;&gt; goods
&gt; &gt;&gt; in planes' cargo holds.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt; &gt; You mention airplanes also.  I thought you were referring to cargo ships
&gt; &gt; only.

&gt; Sigh... read back through that post, above.  I will C&amp;P it here for you:
&gt; &quot;What about our ports? (Acckkk! ===:-O)  What about the cargo holds
&gt; of passenger planes?  (ditto)&quot;
">

I know what you ment, but you brought up airplanes later.  Quite
different than container ships or LP ships, oil tankers ect.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I am quite confident our airlines are well taken care of.

&gt; OMG - I'm not!  Nevermind the carry-on stuff, the checked luggage isn't
&gt; screened!

gimmie a break.  I know someone who works behind the scene.  There is an
army that you never see when you are at an airport.  They screen all the
baggage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   I'm
&gt; &gt; not so sure of our cargo ships, like container ships and all the cargo
&gt; &gt; they transport here are 100 percent safe.

&gt; They're not even 50% safe.  (I wish I could remember the actual %-age of
&gt; cargo that's inspected at our ports; it's very low.  Part of my brain is
&gt; saying 4%, &amp; another part is saying up to ~20%.)

It is quite an impossible job.  However the cargo is screened before
it's loaded.  Everybody knows that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   Of course, nothing will be
&gt; &gt; 100 percent safe, you should know that from your school district
&gt; &gt; training, right?

&gt; My &quot;school district training&quot;?  In what?  Lock-down procedures, you mean?

&gt; Anyway... re: ports (&amp; airline cargo holds): I'll take 90+% over whatever
&gt; the present percentage is, any day.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course. What a silly question.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Your turn:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Would you agree that since 9/11, there have been terrorist
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attacks
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; England, Spain and Indonesia?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there have been none here in the U.S.  That is what is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; important
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The other countries have to step up to the plate like we
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doing

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Stick with me on this. You've said that our presence in Iraq
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reason
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this country hasn't been attacked. Does this mean our
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; military
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; kept
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bad
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; guys
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from leaving Iraq and coming here?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One of the reasons.  We've also made some changes here at home
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; discourage terrorists.  Armed crew and air marshals for a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; couple.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What about our ports? (Acckkk! ===:-O)  What about the cargo
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; holds
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; passenger planes?  (ditto)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; working on that too.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Working on what?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Working on the ports, duh.....Cathy, have a tough day in class?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Why did you bring up ports?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why?!?  Are you seriously asking this question, wondering why I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; might
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; concerned about our ports' security?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Because they are incredibly vulnerable, w/ a tiny percentage of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ships
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &amp;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cargo being inspected.  Anyone wants to sneak a nasty substance
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; into
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; country, just send it via container ship.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Of course it's serious.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Idiot. You made it sound as if you thought the problem was not

&gt; &gt;&gt; Holy crap, I sure do.  You implied that I was suggesting something which

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You ***MUST*** be kidding, or trolling. Please tell me you're
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; serious.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You're really asking that question?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm not kidding.  What is your answer?  Is it?  You asked the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; question
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and I answered you, now I want your response.  What is your answer?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll tell ya what - you look at the link below, and if you still
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wonder
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; if
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Marbury v. Madison is part of the constitution, I will be polite and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; answer
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that question. Deal? You look at the web page, and then I promise - my
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; next
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; post will answer your question, if you still have one.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the link:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts.html

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, I'll tell ya Joe, I know what the constitution says and all of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; amendments, frankly I could not find anything regarding Marbury v.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Madison that was part of it, nothing.  The link you posted shows
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; arguments not decisions, further, they only go back to the year 2000.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How does that relate to the Constitution?  Explain.  Further, I could
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not find anything in the link you posted that related to Marbury v.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Madison.  It appears that you are just leading me on.  I am not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; insincere, but it appears you are.  Are you?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You have not answered my question.  Instead you posted a link.  I want
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you to directly, in your own words to answer my questions, in YOUR own
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; words Joe.  Don't post any links again.  Joe.....your turn bud.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt; &gt;&gt; Any time you see &quot;this v. that&quot;, like United Haulers Assn., Inc. v.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority (from the web page),
&gt; &gt;&gt; it's a
&gt; &gt;&gt; court case with two opponents. Government v. person, person v.
&gt; &gt;&gt; corporation,
&gt; &gt;&gt; etc. I have no idea about the details of Marbury v. Madison, but the
&gt; &gt;&gt; letter
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;v&quot; with a period means it's a court case.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Haven't you ever watched ANY legal dramas, going back as far as Perry
&gt; &gt;&gt; Mason???

&gt; &gt; The letter &quot;v.&quot; means versus, as in &quot;opposed to&quot;.  It is used in legal
&gt; &gt; language and court cases such as you have presented.

&gt; &gt; I don't watch much TV, except for C-SPAN Joe, thankyou.

&gt; &gt; So let's hear from you in your own words some answers of some of my
&gt; &gt; questions.  Don't be afraid of rebuttle

&gt; rebuttal

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Idiot. You made it sound as if you thought the problem was not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; important, by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; saying &quot;the dimmies brought it up&quot;. Your style has changed since

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; times
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; before sending them.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't see anything above to indicate what you said is true.  I don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; know what you mean by &quot;drinking&quot;.  Could you elaborate a little
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; regarding that comment?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; --

&gt;&gt; &gt; No need for me to repeat what Cathy said. You're outvoted. You should
&gt;&gt; &gt; feel
&gt;&gt; &gt; flattered that we're even responding to you right now.

&gt;&gt; YOU should be flatterered that no one takes you seriously enough to leap
&gt;&gt; out
&gt;&gt; of the shadows and.......

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing is perfect.  I am pleased we are fighting terrorism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The only fight against terrorism that's working is one that you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cannot see. It's not in the news.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This may be true.  I'm glad you recognize how invaluable the Patriot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Act is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think the Patriot Act has been very effective.  We've been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; kept
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; safe mostly because Airline cockpit doors are armored and kept
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; locked,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; there's widespread suspicion of anybody who looks Middle Eastern, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the war in Afghanistan has disrupted al Quada quite a bit (Why did al
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Quada bomb a train in Spain?  Because they couldn't bomb anything in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the US).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Unfortunately we're still not doing nearly enough about providing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; secular education in Afghanistan and Pakistan and countering the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; money
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the radical Saudis (the royal family) have been sending there for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; extremist religous schools.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd like to see a modern equivalent of the WWII victory garden effort,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with gasoline. If Americans (theoretically) approve of a pointless war
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;git them nasty terrorists&quot;, you'd think we could manage to direct some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that (theoretical) anger toward each of us driving 20% less each week.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Too
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bad the last 5 presidents have been so happy to blow the Saudis, rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spank them for their part in this mess. Otherwise, one of them might
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the balls to say &quot;Look - money talks, but the Saudis don't believe we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the gumption to hit them in the pocket book. What do YOU all think?&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For golf boy:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; google world war II victory garden

&gt;&gt;&gt; Your cavalier attitude regarding terrorists. &quot;git them nasty
&gt;&gt;&gt; terrorists&quot;, is appalling.  It is apparent your innocent family members
&gt;&gt;&gt; weren't on one of the 9/11 planes or in either WTC building on 9/11, nor
&gt;&gt;&gt; do you show any compassion for the ones that were caught by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; terrorists that fateful day.

&gt;&gt; I don't see YOU making any sacrifices to combat terrorism. I'd bet a
&gt;&gt; year's pay that if Bush said everyone needed to use 20% less petroleum
&gt;&gt; products starting tomorrow, you'd cheat.

&gt; Stop projecting your OWN slimy, cocksucking LIEbrawl DEMONrat corruption.
">

I'm going to be using about 20% less petroleum this next year, I bought a
newer Toyota that gets better gas mileage than my old worn out Toyota.
Besides that, I've been working on cutting down my gas usage all this last
year.

&gt; I've been mentioning those payments here for a couple of years now.
&gt; Saddam started to pay Palestinians only after the US threatened

&gt; Israelis, not the US, Europe, or any of our wonderful Arab allies.

&gt;&gt; Now it is time for you to do some more study....

&gt; You need to learn far more because you're still stuck in the falsehood

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You ***MUST*** be kidding, or trolling. Please tell me you're
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; serious.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You're really asking that question?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm not kidding.  What is your answer?  Is it?  You asked the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; question
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and I answered you, now I want your response.  What is your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; answer?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll tell ya what - you look at the link below, and if you still
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wonder
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; if
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Marbury v. Madison is part of the constitution, I will be polite
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; answer
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that question. Deal? You look at the web page, and then I promise -
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; next
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; post will answer your question, if you still have one.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the link:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts.html

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, I'll tell ya Joe, I know what the constitution says and all of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; amendments, frankly I could not find anything regarding Marbury v.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Madison that was part of it, nothing.  The link you posted shows
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; arguments not decisions, further, they only go back to the year
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2000.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How does that relate to the Constitution?  Explain.  Further, I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; could
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not find anything in the link you posted that related to Marbury v.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Madison.  It appears that you are just leading me on.  I am not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; insincere, but it appears you are.  Are you?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You have not answered my question.  Instead you posted a link.  I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; want
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you to directly, in your own words to answer my questions, in YOUR
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; own
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; words Joe.  Don't post any links again.  Joe.....your turn bud.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Any time you see &quot;this v. that&quot;, like United Haulers Assn., Inc. v.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority (from the web page),
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it's a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; court case with two opponents. Government v. person, person v.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; corporation,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; etc. I have no idea about the details of Marbury v. Madison, but the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; letter
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;v&quot; with a period means it's a court case.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Haven't you ever watched ANY legal dramas, going back as far as Perry
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mason???

&gt;&gt; &gt; The letter &quot;v.&quot; means versus, as in &quot;opposed to&quot;.  It is used in legal
&gt;&gt; &gt; language and court cases such as you have presented.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't watch much TV, except for C-SPAN Joe, thankyou.

&gt;&gt; &gt; So let's hear from you in your own words some answers of some of my
&gt;&gt; &gt; questions.  Don't be afraid of rebuttle, it's good for you, it will
&gt;&gt; &gt; enable you to think deeper.
&gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; If you understood what the &quot;v.&quot; meant, why did you ask?

&gt; You goofy or delusional.  I never asked, but tried to it explain to you.
&gt; You never answer any of my questions.  I think you are a phony.
&gt; --
">

OK - you didn't specifically ask about the "v.", but you asked about the
word arrangement used in *all* descriptions of specific legal cases. Did you
really think "Marbury v. Madison" might be "part of the constitution", as
you put it?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Haven't you ever watched ANY legal dramas, going back as far as Perry
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mason???

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The letter &quot;v.&quot; means versus, as in &quot;opposed to&quot;.  It is used in legal
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; language and court cases such as you have presented.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't watch much TV, except for C-SPAN Joe, thankyou.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So let's hear from you in your own words some answers of some of my
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; questions.  Don't be afraid of rebuttle, it's good for you, it will
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; enable you to think deeper.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt; &gt;&gt; If you understood what the &quot;v.&quot; meant, why did you ask?

&gt; &gt; You goofy or delusional.  I never asked, but tried to it explain to you.
&gt; &gt; You never answer any of my questions.  I think you are a phony.
&gt; &gt; --

&gt; OK - you didn't specifically ask about the &quot;v.&quot;, but you asked about the
&gt; word arrangement used in *all* descriptions of specific legal cases. Did you
&gt; really think &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; might be &quot;part of the constitution&quot;, as
&gt; you put it?

You asked I didn't.  You lead people around in circles.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; serious.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You're really asking that question?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm not kidding.  What is your answer?  Is it?  You asked the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; question
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and I answered you, now I want your response.  What is your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; answer?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll tell ya what - you look at the link below, and if you still
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wonder
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; if
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Marbury v. Madison is part of the constitution, I will be polite
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; answer
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that question. Deal? You look at the web page, and then I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; promise -
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; next
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; post will answer your question, if you still have one.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, I'll tell ya Joe, I know what the constitution says and all
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; amendments, frankly I could not find anything regarding Marbury
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; v.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Madison that was part of it, nothing.  The link you posted shows
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; arguments not decisions, further, they only go back to the year
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2000.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How does that relate to the Constitution?  Explain.  Further, I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; could
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not find anything in the link you posted that related to Marbury
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; v.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Madison.  It appears that you are just leading me on.  I am not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; insincere, but it appears you are.  Are you?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You have not answered my question.  Instead you posted a link.  I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; want

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Any time you see &quot;this v. that&quot;, like United Haulers Assn., Inc. v.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority (from the web
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; page),
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it's a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; court case with two opponents. Government v. person, person v.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; corporation,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; etc. I have no idea about the details of Marbury v. Madison, but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; letter

&gt;&gt; &gt;  Why did you bring up ports?

&gt;&gt; Why?!?  Are you seriously asking this question, wondering why I might be

&gt;&gt; Because they are incredibly vulnerable, w/ a tiny percentage of ships &amp;

But they may have been in the Kurdish area, as the Kurds have long been

Soon after we invaded Afghanistan, Syria was cooperating with the US on

Because GW Bush will never, ever fight the Iraqi war well enough to win
it.  He just doesn't understand war, and he can't help but be anything
more than a partisan politician rather than  the real leader we need.

The citizens of Iraq already lead lives of fear and uncertainty, and
most of them want the US to leave.  OTOH most of the citizens of
Afghanistan want the US to stay there.  What do you think that means?

We were discussing Iraq.  I guess that was Bush's mistake too,  He invaded
Iraq instead of Iran.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this is the first time I've ever agreed with you. While the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exact words you spout here are accurate, I can't help but wonder if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand what they mean.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STOP ANY AND ALL TERRORIST ATTACKS FROM EVER
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HAPPENING. Not possible. Ever. At all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason is, to stop any and all terrorists attacks that might ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen, we have to be 100% right every minute of every day, forever. If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you really want to be free of any terrorist attack, then you are living
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a dream world. It is impossible to protect against terrorist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; atttack. The very best we can hope for is to derail a few attacks on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occasion, and to respond better to any attack once it has happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While our presence in Iraq might not foil all terrorist attacks, there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is every reason to believe that our absence from Iraq would likely lead
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to more attacks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which &quot;every reason&quot;, Jeff?  How many people does it take to carry out a
&gt;&gt;&gt; sophisticated attack? 5? 10? 15?

&gt;&gt; 1 person can kill thousands if he does it right.

&gt;&gt; We have not, and cannot seal the borders
&gt;&gt;&gt; or Iraq, nor have we tried. If a group wants out, they'll get out.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully, they will have a harder time getting INTO this country than
&gt;&gt;&gt; OUT of Iraq.

&gt;&gt; But, we cherish our right to travel freely, this demands that our borders
&gt;&gt; be porous to a certain degree. If you want security, then you have to
&gt;&gt; accept a police state. And, I'm not convinced a police state will secure
&gt;&gt; you, or me ...

&gt; You said &quot;there is every reason to believe our absence from Iraq would
&gt; likely lead to more attacks&quot;. For reasons I'll explain later, it would be
&gt; great if you didn't follow up this message until 4-5 hours from now.
&gt; Here's my question:

&gt; What physical process, performed by our troops, is keeping bad guys from
&gt; leaving Iraq? &quot;Killing them&quot; is an incorrect answer, as is &quot;finding them
&gt; and throwing them in prison&quot;.

What a fucking dickwad. He asks a question and then he does his level best
to try and control the answers. FUCK OFF AND DIE, LIEbrawl asshole. If it

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Iraqi army is a disaster, according to all sources, and I do mean
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *ALL*.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Iraqi police have been infiltrated by every form of rat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imaginable.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody trusts them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Insurgents seem to have found a new weapon: 13 year old kids loaded
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; explosives. No more pictures of American soldiers being friendly with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kids.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's over.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We just pissed off the Kurds, our only sorta kinda ally in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Got a plan?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is worth a try.  Let's see what happens.  If results don't happen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in some months then time to pull up stakes and hunker down in the U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then let the rest of the world take care of itself.  This perhaps will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be a wakeup call for the rest of those lazy nations not willing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pitch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Considering that after 9/11, other terrorist attacks have been in
&gt;&gt;&gt; London, Spain and Indonesia, I think it's not worth a try. We've already
&gt;&gt;&gt; seen that our presence in Iraq does not necessarily stop terrorist

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; sorry for  the families that have lost a loved one, or two. But, we
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; are up to just  over 3,000 in how many years, 4? It is safer to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; a troop in Iraq than a  teenager in New York City, if all you look
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; at is the raw number.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Uh oh. It's the pathetic &quot;not so bad compared to other wars&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; argument. You can do better than that, Jeff. That kind of horseshit
&gt;&gt;&gt; is golf boy's specialty.

&gt;&gt; If you are referring to me I have never said such a thing.  If you were
&gt;&gt; thinking of Mike Hunt then you would be closer.  But since he served in
&gt;&gt; WWII he probably knows a thing or two about sacrifice that the rest of
&gt;&gt; us don't.

&gt; The numbers don't matter. You never EVER say such a thing. If you said
&gt; that to a parent of a dead soldier, that parent would have every right to
&gt; kill you and gut you like a deer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does that mean the new surge of about 20K won't work either?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, that is not what it means.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It only means that increasing by 20K is nothing to complain about.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless... it still doesn't work &amp; even more troops are killed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt;&gt; Cathy, we lost more troops in a single day saving Europe from Hitler.

&gt; You're equating the two scenarios??  (Rhetorical question.  Yeah, you
&gt; are.)

&gt;&gt; We have not begun to lose enough troops to even bat an eye.

&gt; Considering the marked lack of progress (or to put it another way, the
&gt; complete mess, which has been getting worse &amp; worse), I'd say any lives
&gt; lost are too many.

&gt;  I am sorry for
&gt;&gt; the families that have lost a loved one, or two. But, we are up to just
&gt;&gt; over 3,000 in how many years, 4?

&gt; &quot;*Just* over 3,000&quot;?

&gt; It is safer to be a troop in Iraq than a
&gt;&gt; teenager in New York City, if all you look at is the raw number.

&gt; This last I rather wonder about... AFAIK, NYC now has the lowest crime
&gt; rate of all large cities in the U.S.  (And you know which is the safest
&gt; precinct in all of NYC?  Central Park. ;-)  )

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this is the first time I've ever agreed with you. While the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exact words you spout here are accurate, I can't help but wonder if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you understand what they mean.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STOP ANY AND ALL TERRORIST ATTACKS FROM EVER
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HAPPENING. Not possible. Ever. At all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason is, to stop any and all terrorists attacks that might ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen, we have to be 100% right every minute of every day, forever.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you really want to be free of any terrorist attack, then you are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; living in a dream world. It is impossible to protect against terrorist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; atttack. The very best we can hope for is to derail a few attacks on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occasion, and to respond better to any attack once it has happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While our presence in Iraq might not foil all terrorist attacks, there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is every reason to believe that our absence from Iraq would likely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lead to more attacks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which &quot;every reason&quot;, Jeff?  How many people does it take to carry out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a sophisticated attack? 5? 10? 15?

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 person can kill thousands if he does it right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We have not, and cannot seal the borders
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or Iraq, nor have we tried. If a group wants out, they'll get out.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully, they will have a harder time getting INTO this country than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OUT of Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But, we cherish our right to travel freely, this demands that our
&gt;&gt;&gt; borders be porous to a certain degree. If you want security, then you
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to accept a police state. And, I'm not convinced a police state
&gt;&gt;&gt; will secure you, or me ...

&gt;&gt; You said &quot;there is every reason to believe our absence from Iraq would
&gt;&gt; likely lead to more attacks&quot;. For reasons I'll explain later, it would be
&gt;&gt; great if you didn't follow up this message until 4-5 hours from now.
&gt;&gt; Here's my question:

&gt;&gt; What physical process, performed by our troops, is keeping bad guys from
&gt;&gt; leaving Iraq? &quot;Killing them&quot; is an incorrect answer, as is &quot;finding them
&gt;&gt; and throwing them in prison&quot;.

&gt; What a fucking dickwad. He asks a question and then he does his level best
&gt; to try and control the answers. FUCK OFF AND DIE, LIEbrawl asshole. If it
&gt; were in my power....
">

"Killing them" or "throwing them in prison" are incorrect answers because
they contradict simple mathematical factors, which you know nothing about
because you never finished high school. Come back if &amp; when you decide to
get your GED.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; words you spout here are accurate, I can't help but wonder if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand what they mean.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STOP ANY AND ALL TERRORIST ATTACKS FROM EVER
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HAPPENING. Not possible. Ever. At all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason is, to stop any and all terrorists attacks that might ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen, we have to be 100% right every minute of every day, forever.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you really want to be free of any terrorist attack, then you are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; living
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a dream world. It is impossible to protect against terrorist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; atttack.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The very best we can hope for is to derail a few attacks on occasion,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to respond better to any attack once it has happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While our presence in Iraq might not foil all terrorist attacks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every reason to believe that our absence from Iraq would likely lead
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more attacks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which &quot;every reason&quot;, Jeff?  How many people does it take to carry out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sophisticated attack? 5? 10? 15?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1 person can kill thousands if he does it right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 person could solve the Mid East problem with nukes....but we are
&gt;&gt;&gt; doing it the hard way.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Scott in Florida

&gt;&gt; Troll alert.

&gt; In other words, Joe has NO answer, bullshit or otherwise, to that comment.

If you want your leaders to use nukes in an area 1/3 the size of Ontario,
you are an idiot. But wait...we knew that already.

Bah-lone-eee!!  The terrorists were just getting going.  Had it not been
for GWB and America and our allies it would be much worse.  You really
need to look back through the years and all of the terrorist activities
that have killed innocent people culminating in 9/11 WTC attack, the
ultimate terrorist attack to date.

&gt; &gt;&gt;I think our relationship with Japan would have been quite different today
&gt; &gt;&gt;if
&gt; &gt;&gt;we hadn't used it on her. So with that in mind, I hate to see more jobs go
&gt; &gt;&gt;overseas as an indirect way of rebuilding what ever we had destroyed. Do
&gt; &gt;&gt;you
&gt; &gt;&gt;understand what I'm trying to say?

&gt; &gt; If we had not dropped the nukes on Japan, we would have lost a million
&gt; &gt; troops and the Japanese would have lost a hell of a lot more.

&gt; &gt; The more I think about it....the more a well placed nuke in the Middle
&gt; &gt; East sounds like a great idea....

You mean spooks, as in spies, right?

I agree. We need a covert operation to deal with this. The trouble we face
is that we are legally bound to NOT engage in covert operations. We get in
trouble everytime anybody finds out we do stuff in secret.

You saw what happened when Saddam was tried. Can you imagine the uproar that
would have come out if he was found hanging from the yard arm -- or simply
found dead somewhere -- and it was traced back to a UC covert operation?

OBL's status as a Good Guy would be cemented if his demise came at the hands
of a US covert oeprative.

Covert operations are not always a bad thing, unless it is the USA that is
doing them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The reason is, to stop any and all terrorists attacks that might ever

&gt;&gt; &gt; Or just be perceived as too risky a target for the terrorists, as the
&gt;&gt; &gt; US has been since 9/11.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Too risky? What fucking risk? The terrorists are willing to die in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attack.

&gt;&gt; &gt; But they don't want to fail or get caught, and they did take
&gt;&gt; &gt; precautions against that, such as by doing practice runs on the
&gt;&gt; &gt; airliners.

&gt;&gt; Fail? They are willing to take out as few as one other person and
&gt;&gt; consider
&gt;&gt; it a victory.  I suppose there is a risk they get nobody, but that would
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; be much of a terrorist attack, would it?

&gt; I seriously doubt they would have been satisfied with that, and if all
&gt; they wanted to do was kill a few passengers, the hijackers wouldn't
&gt; have taken flying lessons.

They don't have to be satisfied. If they are not satisfied, they simply
reload another bomb vest and try again.
Even if they are satisfied, they will load another vest.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our presence in Iraq does not necessarily stop terrorist attacks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think this is the first time I've ever agreed with you. While the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what they mean.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STOP ANY AND ALL TERRORIST ATTACKS FROM EVER
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HAPPENING. Not possible. Ever. At all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you be any more obvious, idiot?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;While our presence in Iraq might not foil all terrorist attacks, there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;every reason to believe that our absence from Iraq would likely lead to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;attacks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dumbshit liar.  There is ZERO reason to believe that our absence from
&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq would likely lead to more attacks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Invading Iraq HAS NOT and DOES NOT make us safer from terrorists.

&gt;&gt;By the same token, it hasn't hurt us either.

&gt; Lying asshole.

&gt; It's hurt us financially.
">

It's just money, and a small percentage of the GDP.

It's hurt us by losing soldiers.

We lost more civilians due to gang-related violence in New York City last
year than in all of the years of being in Iraq. Statistically, an 18 to 29
year old male has a better chance of survival in Iraq than in a major city
in the USA. A sad statistic to be sure, but you are not crying about the
lives lost in the inner city, unless the inner city is in Baghdad.

I'm thinking more of spooks stopping attacks in this country. The borders of
Iraq are not sealed, so I can't see our military presence there having a
major effect on anyone who wants to leave and bomb another building here or
in Europe. What's more likely to stop them is having to pass through
multiple checkpoints at airports, since there are no non-stop flights from
Iraq to this country.

The simpletons like to say that the 3000 soldiers we've lost so far died for
a cause which is obvious: The lack of any further attacks here. But, that
assumes something absurd: That the work of NSA, CIA and FBI have had no
effect at all. We will not know this until 20-30 years from now. NSA is
capable of some truly amazing things. But, there's no way they're going to
be in the news trumpeting their achievments, which would reveal their

If there is anything al Qaeda &lt;whatever&gt; can do, it's reload an explosives

Speaking of which, the NYT has some interesting comments on Rice's visit to
Egypt. Apparently, she's tip-toeing around the idea of selling democracy,
opting instead for coddling a country which provides STABILITY in the
region, even if we don't much like their ethics much of the time.

al Quada carried out four airliner hijackings on 9/11 for $500,000, an
operation that took years of preparation and training.  If they had
more money or more trained personnel, don't you think they would have
attempted far more hijackings on that day?  And why did they carry out
the train bombing in Spain on 3/11?  I say it was because they couldn't
do anything in the US and may not have had enough skilled people left
for a more complex operation.

Funny. They opposed it because of business. Bush wanted it because of
business. You'd think the two sides would stop eyeing each other

They aren't surrendering in Afghanistan, where they've been fighting on
our side for the past five years, and they didn't surrender during the
American Revolution, even though they went bankrupt.  The only reason
France surrendered to the Nazis was because they were right next to
Germany, and I'm afraid any country would have done the same.  You
should have more respect for France.

&gt;al Quada carried out four airliner hijackings on 9/11 for $500,000, an

&gt;&gt;&gt;infiltrators and inside men who have been bought to get us the
&gt;&gt;&gt;information that would prevent more spectacular attacks in the future.
&gt;&gt;&gt;We can only ward them off with the Iraq War for so long.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe things have become better since 2003, but it wouldn't have taken

Your analysis is a contradiction to Joe's.  He says nothing we have
done has stopped terrorism in America.  He says spies making deals with
people is the way to combat terrorism.  It seems to me you think the
way to combat terrorism is to allow more of them to blow themselves up
and henceforth there will be less.

The way to combat terrorism is to hurt them, a lot.  This means
physically, financially, and their reputation.  Hurting their abettors
in a lesser way is needed also, just to get the message across.
Unfortunately the terrorist sympathizers are at all levels of
government and media, here and abroad.  That's where the spies can come
into play.  Whether overtly or covertly the spies can "convince" them
to change their minds.

&gt; &gt; think the way to combat terrorism is to allow more of them to blow
&gt; &gt; themselves up and henceforth there will be less.

&gt; &gt; The way to combat terrorism is to hurt them, a lot.  This means
&gt; &gt; physically, financially, and their reputation.  Hurting their
&gt; &gt; abettors in a lesser way is needed also, just to get the message
&gt; &gt; across.  Unfortunately the terrorist sympathizers are at all levels
&gt; &gt; of government and media, here and abroad.  That's where the spies
&gt; &gt; can come into play.  Whether overtly or covertly the spies can
&gt; &gt; &quot;convince&quot; them to change their minds.

&gt; Some of what you said is correct. It's funny that you'll never figure
&gt; out which parts.

Everything I said is correct.  Tell me what is correct in your mind.
No wait, you can't speak for yourself.  All you can do is interrogate
people.

&gt; They aren't surrendering in Afghanistan, where they've been fighting on

&gt; American Revolution, even though they went bankrupt.  The only reason
&gt; France surrendered to the Nazis was because they were right next to

&gt; &gt; The way to combat terrorism is to hurt them, a lot.  This means
&gt; &gt; physically, financially, and their reputation.  Hurting their
&gt; &gt; abettors in a lesser way is needed also, just to get the message
&gt; &gt; across.  Unfortunately the terrorist sympathizers are at all levels
&gt; &gt; of government and media, here and abroad.  That's where the spies
&gt; &gt; can come into play.  Whether overtly or covertly the spies can
&gt; &gt; &quot;convince&quot; them to change their minds.

&gt; I wonder if you get all those virgins when your head is removed during

&gt; They don't have to be satisfied. If they are not satisfied, they simply
&gt; reload another bomb vest and try again.
&gt; Even if they are satisfied, they will load another vest.

&gt; &gt; I don't think that al Quada ever had the resources to easily reload,
&gt; &gt; and every international attack took a big toll on their human and
&gt; &gt; material resources.

&gt; SAY WHAT!!!???

&gt; If there is anything al Qaeda &lt;whatever&gt; can do, it's reload an explosives
&gt; vest (or truck) with another load of explosives and another suicide
&gt; attacker.

But how do they deliver those explosives to high value targets that
will really impress the American public and not be forgotten after 15
minutes?  After all, al Quada now has to compete against the war in
Iraq and YouTube videos of SNL's ____ In A Box and celebrities who
don't wear underwear.

But is that a realistic assumption?  After all it turned out that
Saddam had no WMDs, did comply (begrudgingly) with UN orders to
eliminate his WMDs after the Gulf War, and was not only not helping al
Quada but was actually trying to infiltrate them.  Before the war, the
CIA said Saddam wouldn't support terrorists except possibly threatened
with attack.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think our relationship with Japan would have been quite different today
&gt;&gt;&gt;if
&gt;&gt;&gt;we hadn't used it on her. So with that in mind, I hate to see more jobs
&gt;&gt;&gt;go
&gt;&gt;&gt;overseas as an indirect way of rebuilding what ever we had destroyed. Do
&gt;&gt;&gt;you
&gt;&gt;&gt;understand what I'm trying to say?

&gt;&gt; If we had not dropped the nukes on Japan, we would have lost a million
&gt;&gt; troops and the Japanese would have lost a hell of a lot more.

&gt;&gt; The more I think about it....the more a well placed nuke in the Middle

&gt;&gt;&gt; The lousy rules of engagement were made to satisfy the Dims.

&gt;&gt;Those lousy Dems, who were in the minority in both houses of Congress
&gt;&gt;when the war resolution was passed in 2002, had nothing to do with
&gt;&gt;setting those rules.  Get your history right.

England was across the Channel and so far away that German planes
couldn't carry much bomb payload or operate very long over it --
remember the Battle of Britain?  The British RAF had not only the
advantage of radar but also shorter distance, allowing each of their
fighter planes to fly much longer before returning to base for

So how do you blitzkrieg military tanks from Germany to Britain over
water?  Ships move a lot slower and are sitting ducks.

If the ocean was more than a foot deep between Germany and Britain, the
maps would say so, but not a single one does.  Not only that, but they
don't show any bridges spanning those two countries, as would be
expected if the water was deep.  It's just simple logic.  Point and
match for Scottie.

That was due to another ill-conceived preemptive war by us, also by a
president who's not considered one of our greatest.   :(

Even the US military allows foreign workers on projects in the US, and
it was known that when some construction work was done at the base at
Yuma, AZ, some illegal labor was employed.  This was under a program
that allowed contractors to pay less than prevailing wages (i.e., union
wages), and it always results in foreign labor being used.

But if terrorists quit attacking, the public will feel complacent
again, and subsequent attacks have to be bigger, otherwise the public
will think of them as nothing unusual (look at Israelis -- the bombings
hurt but don't change their will or everyday life).

Al Quada is failing for two reasons:  1) The US took over Afghanistan,
a move they didn't expect (unlike the Iraq war, which they hoped for),
and 2) it has no popular appeal, except among young men.

The Brits got the $#it kicked out of them for over three years and did not
surrender.  The difference was they had the ba$$ to fight and the French
were cowards by comparison in both wars.

Not expendable, but I don't consider them to be cowards either nor do I
feel they would be neglect in their duty to country.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't follow the herd.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; OK. And what about this question? Everyone has a limit to their
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; patience.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What's yours?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If we send as many troops as Bush wants, and things are still the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; enough
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; enough?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I am prepared for the U.S. to stay in the middle east for an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unlimited
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; amount of time.  In other words, forever.  To back away would be a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; disaster which we would have to deal with down the line only much
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; worse
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; than now.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If your kids died there, would that be OK, even if no results were

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes.  They would have died honorably in the service of their country

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have mixed feelings about Dick Morris.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes he is just wrong....

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This Obama craze is funny.  Hillary has to 'kill' him.  Should

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It will be fun to see you vanish from this newsgroup when you
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; figure
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; out
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that these people are right about the war.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't follow the herd.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; OK. And what about this question? Everyone has a limit to their
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; patience.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What's yours?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If we send as many troops as Bush wants, and things are still the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same in
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; number of years, what value would YOU assign to X before you say
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; enough
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; enough?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I am prepared for the U.S. to stay in the middle east for an unlimited
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; amount of time.  In other words, forever.  To back away would be a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; disaster which we would have to deal with down the line only much
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; worse
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; than now.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If your kids died there, would that be OK, even if no results were
&gt;&gt;&gt; forthcoming?

&gt;&gt; Yes.  They would have died honorably in the service of their country
&gt;&gt; while doing what they wanted to do.  No different than if they had died
&gt;&gt; on a Mt Everest avalanche while snowboarding.  I would not have to make
&gt;&gt; excuses for them having dodged a draft or some other cowardly act.

If Bush keeps his promise to listen to his generals, it may end much sooner
than you think. Retired General Barry McCaffrey called Bush's plan a fool's
errand today. I know that generals have their brains removed when they
retire, so their military training becomes useless, but still, his wording
was rather strong.

No, they don't have to worry about kissing ass anymore and can say what they
