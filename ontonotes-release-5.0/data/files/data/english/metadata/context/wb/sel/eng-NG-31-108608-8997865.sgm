&gt; &gt; The fact that All Possible Digit Arrangements as a definition of the
&gt; &gt; Reals resists all
&gt; &gt; of Cantor's diagonal argument is very noteworthy and we can actually
&gt; &gt; see it with
&gt; &gt; finite place values.

&gt; Alright, my critics keep carping about doing the Cantor diagonal on
&gt; infinite
&gt; place valued Reals, as if infinite place values is going to save and
&gt; salvage
&gt; Cantors schemata. So below I set up all the Reals between 0 and 1
&gt; and I  find the particular Real that Cantor claims is not in the list
&gt; itself.
&gt; But to everyone's surprise the Real that Cantor claims was not in the
&gt; list
&gt; is actually in the list itself and forthwith, Cantor is proven to be
&gt; wrong. So that by
&gt; example of finite place value such as 1 place value for Cantor's
&gt; method

&gt; 9
&gt; 8
&gt; 7
&gt; 6
&gt; 5
&gt; 4
&gt; 3
&gt; 2
&gt; 1
&gt; 0

&gt; That change each digit above to try to find a new Cantor number is
&gt; impossible
&gt; for we cannot change the 9 to be something new and not on the list,
&gt; nor 8, nor 7.

&gt; And Cantor's method collapses and falls apart with every finite place
&gt; value under
&gt; *ALL Possible Digit Arrangements*

&gt; So now I give the Infinite Place Value and I show you where Cantor's
&gt; diagonal method
&gt; fails and does not deliver a new number that is not on the original
&gt; list.

&gt; 000000.......00000000001
&gt; 000000.......00000000000

&gt; Now the diagonal starts at the upper left corner  with &quot;9&quot; and goes
&gt; downward
&gt; ending with the &quot;0&quot; in 0000....0000. Now here in Cantor Diagonal
&gt; Schemata
&gt; he changes a 9 to 0, and a 8 to 9 and a 7 to 8, and a 6 to 7, and a 5
&gt; to 6, and
&gt; a 4 to 5 and a 3 to 4, and a 2 to 3, and a 1 to 2, and a 0 to 1.

&gt; So Cantor's alleged new number looks like this

&gt; 0000000.....9.....8.....7.....6......10.....5......4.....3.....2.....111111 1.........1

&gt; That number is an infinite number no doubt about that but it is less
&gt; than 1 percent of the way (sic)
&gt; of the numbers from 0 to .....9999999.

&gt; And the only important question here is whether that number already
&gt; exists in the
&gt; original list. And the answer is a resounding yes, that it already
&gt; existed in the original
&gt; list even with what Cantor calls a change in every number by changing
&gt; one digit
&gt; in its place value.

&gt; Again we go to the example of 1 place value or 2 place value

&gt; 9
&gt; 8
&gt; 7
&gt; 6
&gt; 5
&gt; 4
&gt; 3
&gt; 2
&gt; 1
&gt; 0

&gt; Or two place value
&gt; 99
&gt; 98
&gt; 97
&gt; .
&gt; .
&gt; .

&gt; 04
&gt; 03
&gt; 02
&gt; 01
&gt; 00

&gt; And we see that it is impossible to generate a &quot;new Cantor number&quot; that
&gt; does
&gt; not already exist in the list.

&gt; So if it is impossible to generate a new Cantor number regardless of
&gt; whether the
&gt; list is finite place value or infinite place value under *All Possible
&gt; Digit Arrangements*
&gt; then of course there is a huge flaw and error in Cantor's program.

&gt; And the error was that he, nor anyone else thought that what if we say
&gt; Reals are
&gt; all possible digit arrangements. Does the Cantor program stand up
&gt; logically under
&gt; that test and experiment? And the answer is that it falls to pieces.
">

Does anyone know what the definition of Reals was during the 1870s
when
Cantor was plying his diagonal method? Anyone know what Cantor's own
idea of a Real Number was?

Does anyone know if any mathematician before 1993 said that Reals are
all possible digit arrangements of rightward infinite strings with a
finite portion
leftwards. I perhaps have a &quot;first&quot; on that idea, but would need to
make sure.

Anyway the title of this post tells it all. The more I think about the
situation
the more clearer it becomes. That if the Reals were all possible digit
arrangements
then Cantor and any Cantor-follower should give up before even
starting. That they are
defeated on the spot and in their tracks. That the concept of all
possible digit arrangements
precludes anyone from finding a &quot;Cantor new Real&quot; no matter what they
do, because
All possible digit arrangements does not allow room for any new Real.

It is self contradictory to even begin to look for some Real not on a
list of all possible
digit arrangements.

So, for those that still worship Cantor, and those are really silly
people with dafty minds, then
they have alot of explaining to do. They have to explain why the
Cantor Reals is a smaller
set than the All-Possible-Digit-Arrangement Reals. They have to
explain what Reals exist in
the Digit Arrangement Reals that do not exist in the Cantor Reals and
for which the diagonal
method fetches these so called unlisted Cantor Reals.

And laughable how Cantor sets up his bogus proof of Reductio Ad
Absurdum supposing the
Reals are Countably Infinite and then applying a diagonal to fetch out
some alleged unlisted Real.
Ironic because the Reals as All Possible Digit Arrangements is already
Countable because
all possible digit arrangements already arranges the Reals so that
they are Countable. So it
is laughable that Cantor supposes the Reals as Countable when they
already are countable.
And because the Reals are All Possible Digit Arrangements terminates
the ability for Cantor
to fetch a new Real. When you have All Possible Digit Arrangements,
you cannot find any Real
that is not already listed.

So I think the whole entire problem of Cantor and his transfinites
concocted from a erroneous
method of diagonal, came about in the 19th century when mathematics
just was not equipped
enough with clear thinking as to What are the Reals? and the
misfortune that no mathematician
from Cantor to 1993 hit upon the idea that All Possible Digit
Arrangements is the logical anchor
for the Reals as a definition. Keep in mind that in the 1870s Peano
was just working out the
axioms for Natural Numbers and so the concept and notion and
definition of Reals was in a
state of fogginess and would remain so until 1993.

Now I am going to have to devote a full chapter on the common
knowledge in Physics that definitions
are, and important definitions at that, are built from a Probablity
Schemata. The definition of
Quantum Numbers of quantum states are probabilitistic such as the N,
L, m_L and m_s. My point
is that the definition of Reals as all possible digit arrangements and
the definition of P-adics
as all possible digit arrangements (although in opposite infinite
string directions), well, if
good enough for Physics then it is darn well good enough for
Mathematics to have central ideas
defined probabilistically. So I should devote a full chapter early on
in this book to the probability
definition of Real and P-adics. There is plenty of room since this
textbook is over a 1,000 pages
but there is not one single space or room in the Reals for a Cantor
diagonal number.

Things AP does not understand about Cantor's method:

(1) What it shows is that you cannot have a list of N numbers with N
digits that lists all the N-digit numbers. Hence, it doesn't apply if
you have a list of 10 numbers with 1 digit in them, as 10 and 1 are
different. It does not apply if you have a list of 100 numbers with 2
digits in them. AP's list of 9,8,7,...,1 is a non sequitur, a red
herring.

(2) AP claims that the number D obtained from Cantor's diagonalization
is in the list. In his sloppy mannor of &quot;proving&quot; things, he does not
say which specific item on the list D is. The truth is: He can't. On
his initial list of P-adics, the Nth digit of the Nth P-adic differs
from the Nth digit of D, for all N. Hence D cannot be _any_ P-adic on
the list. He is only confusing himself.

(3) AP's &quot;axiom&quot; that &quot;there is only one type of infinity&quot; (which is
at odds with Cantor's proof; hence the antagonism) is based on a
flawed fact: The reciprocal of infinity is not zero; it is an
infinitesimal. If you're going to treat infinity as a number, then
zero times infinity is still zero.

&gt; &gt; 000000.......00000000001
&gt; &gt; 000000.......00000000000

&gt; &gt; Now the diagonal starts at the lower left corner  with &quot;9&quot; and goes
&gt; &gt; downward
&gt; &gt; ending with the &quot;0&quot; in 0000....0000. Now here in Cantor Diagonal
&gt; &gt; Schemata
&gt; &gt; he changes a 9 to 0, and a 8 to 9 and a 7 to 8, and a 6 to 7, and a 5
&gt; &gt; to 6, and
&gt; &gt; a 4 to 5 and a 3 to 4, and a 2 to 3, and a 1 to 2, and a 0 to 1.

&gt; &gt; So Cantor's alleged new number looks like this

&gt; &gt; 0000000.....9.....8.....7.....6......10.....5......4.....3.....2.....111111 1.........1

&gt; &gt; That number is an infinite number no doubt about that but it is less
&gt; &gt; than 1 percent
&gt; &gt; of the numbers from 0 to .....9999999.

&gt; &gt; And the only important question here is whether that number already
&gt; &gt; exists in the
&gt; &gt; original list. And the answer is a resounding yes, that it already
&gt; &gt; existed in the original
&gt; &gt; list even with what Cantor calls a change in every number by changing
&gt; &gt; one digit
&gt; &gt; in its place value.

&gt; Okay; which line does this number exist on? Then we go to the
">

The reason I put the midpoint in there was an important reason,
because
that number is in the infinite swath-band of all the Reals that begin
with
0s

This swath band block of all Reals from 0 to 0999999.....
09999999999..........
.
.
.
00000000000...........

So the number

0000.....9.....8.....7.....6......10.....5......4.....3.....2.....1111..... ....1

is in the mid-region of that swath band of all Reals between 0 and 1

Now, that number above has these as neighbors

0000.....9.....8.....7.....6......99.....5......4.....3.....2.....1111..... ....1
0000.....9.....8.....7.....6......98.....5......4.....3.....2.....1111..... ....1
0000.....9.....8.....7.....6......97.....5......4.....3.....2.....1111..... ....1
0000.....9.....8.....7.....6......96.....5......4.....3.....2.....1111..... ....1
.
.
.
0000.....9.....8.....7.....6......11.....5......4.....3.....2.....1111..... ....1
0000.....9.....8.....7.....6......10.....5......4.....3.....2.....1111..... ....1
0000.....9.....8.....7.....6......09.....5......4.....3.....2.....1111..... ....1
0000.....9.....8.....7.....6......08.....5......4.....3.....2.....1111..... ....1
.
.
.

Now under ALL POSSIBLE DIGIT ARRANGEMENTS, that number
that Cantor's diagonal fetched is already on his list and so when
Cantor announces he has a new number, he is making a huge mistake
because all he did was find a number that already existed in his list.

Just as running a diagonal on all the 1 place value only ends up
repeating
another number that exists. Or on 2 place value etc etc.

So the lesson to learn is that All Digit Arrangements are so full of
numbers
that running a Diagonal and changing one digit does not give you a new
number not on the list.

So when Cantor runs a second diagonal for his above, he will find out
that
changing the midpoint of that previous diagonal number ends up with

0000.....9.....8.....7.....6......10.....5......4.....3.....2.....1111..... ....1

And the question is what will Cantor change the 10 midpoint? No matter
what his diagonal changes the 10 to say 33 or 98 or 65, whatever, the
All Possible Digit Arrangement Definition already has that number as
I diagrammed above.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; appropriate place of the number on that line and find out that the
&gt; number 9999....8888....7777...(etc) does not agree at that digit.

&gt; Sloppiness does not prove Cantor was wrong.

&gt; &gt; Again we go to the example of 1 place value or 2 place value

&gt; A non-sequitur; lots of irrelevacy deleted at this point.
">

The sloppiness of your mind is understandable in that you are a
hatemonger first, and
only secondly do you engage in a reasoned conversation.

Now, since you are found to be so wrong, do me a favor and tell me
what was on Cantor's
mind as a definition of a Real Number when he proposed his diagonal
method in circa 1870s?
I need to know whether transcendentals played into Cantor's picture
and understanding of Reals
because the concept of a Real number as a transcendental should have
discouraged any
mathematician in the 19th century to have ever ventured into making
such bold and unsound claims
of infinity. In other words, being stupid and silly about what is
Transcendental Real? and then
crafting some silly and stupid diagonal when Cantor never tested the
diagonal on finite place values
but jumps directly to infinite sets, is a sign of stupidity, not
genius.

So, what was the definition of Real Number when Cantor was crafting
his diagonal method?

How many times do you have to be told? Cantor assumed he had
a countable list - ok, you can do it this way too - of all the reals.
Then he derived from that list a number which is not on the
list no matter how hard you kick and scream. It's not on the
list because it's constructed to be not on the list.

If you claim it's a list of all possible digit arrangements, the
number derived is STILL not on the list because it's constructed
to be not on the list. This is what's called a proof by
contradiction. You assume it has all possible digit arrangements
(if you choose - or you can choose all reals - or you can choose
any countable set of reals) and then derive, by valid
mathematical methods, a number not in the list.

If you by valid means use A to derive ~A, then A can't be true.

&gt; I diagrammed above.

&gt;&gt; appropriate place of the number on that line and find out that the

&gt; what was on Cantor's
&gt; mind as a definition of a Real Number when he proposed his diagonal
&gt; method in circa 1870s?
&gt; I need to know whether transcendentals played into Cantor's picture

&gt; because the concept of a Real number as a transcendental should have
&gt; discouraged any
&gt; mathematician in the 19th century to have ever ventured into making
&gt; such bold and unsound claims
&gt; of infinity. In other words, being stupid and silly about what is
&gt; Transcendental Real? and then
&gt; crafting some silly and stupid diagonal when Cantor never tested the
&gt; diagonal on finite place values
&gt; but jumps directly to infinite sets, is a sign of stupidity, not
&gt; genius.

&gt; So, what was the definition of Real Number when Cantor was crafting
&gt; his diagonal method?

">

Call me greedy, I don't mind. When I discover something important, I
usually try to pluck
all the fruit before others come barging in and pick some fruit.

So the world's finest and best definition of Real Numbers is All
Possible Digit Arrangements
to infinite place value of a rightward infinite string with a tiny
finite portion leftwards. For the
symmetry is obeyed that allows us to go from P-adics to Reals and
where both are similar
but vastly different.

So this world's finest definition of Reals already shows us how wrong
and errorfilled is Cantor's
diagonal and Cantor's claim that Reals are uncountable. Cantor was all
wrong and was all wet.

But Marshall leads me to ask whether the defintion of Reals as All
Possible Digit Arrangements
clears up any other errors of mathematics. So my first pick would be
to question the Axiom
of Choice.

Now in my foggy mind over when I first encountered the Axiom of Choice
was I believe in Euclidean
geometry where Euclid implied the axiom of Choice to do one of his
proofs. Don't hold me to that
but if that is true, then the axiom of choice is really indispensible.
For if geometry requires
the Axiom of Choice then it is a true axiom. I need to find out about
this need of Axiom of Choice
for the Euclidean Geometry proof program so I will not discuss that
further here.

But what I will discuss in detail is how the Axiom of Choice fares
with All Possible Digit Arrangements
as the definition of Reals.

Before I started this thread, every mathematician in the world thought
that a number like this
as a P-adic

0999999999.........99999999999999999

does not exist

and every mathematician prior to this thread would have said this is
not a Real Number
1.099999999999999999999999999999999999999..........9999999999990

Yes, your eyes are correct in that is a Real Number whose last digit
is a &quot;0&quot; with an infinity
of 9s in between.

So that if the Internet were alive and running in 1870 and Georg
Cantor was reading this thread,
that he would never need to bother with a diagonal to alter a digit in
every Real Number.

Because all the Cantor needed was say

here is a Real Number that no diagonal method can ever forge.

And all that Cantor needed to do is plop down this number

0.099999999......999999990

because no diagonal can craft such a number and Cantor would have been
hard pressed
to show that this number is even a Real Number

But it is a Real Number!!!!!!!!

Just as this is a genuine P-adic Number of 099999999......999999990
where its predecessor is 0999999.....9999999989 and its successor is
0999999.....99999991

Now let me get back to the Axiom of Choice. If Cantor cannot create
that above
Real Number by diagonals, what can create that number is the Axiom of
Choice
That as I go from the Ones place value I choice a 0 as I go to the
Tens place value
I choice a 9, as I go to the Hundreds place value I choice another 9
and so on until I
come to the Infinity Place Value and I choice not another 9 but I
choice a 0.

So, in other words, Cantor's diagonal cannot forge or create or craft
the Real Number that
is

0.0999999999999.....999999999999990

but that the Axiom of Choice and forge that Real Number in the All
Possible Digit Arrangement
Definition of Reals.

And it is no wonder that Choice became an axiom and not diagonal. And
that today, mathematics
has an Axiom of Choice, not an Axiom of Diagonal.

So, the Axiom of Choice is another facet of the Definition that the
Reals are created probabilitistically
as All Possible Digit Arrangements. The concept of choice comes from
probability theory
and All Possible Digit Arrangements comes from probability theory.

Now I bet you, that Axiom of Choice and All Possible Digit
Arrangements are integral to one
another and are dependent on one another.

&gt; Things AP does not understand about Cantor's method:

&gt; you have a list of 10 numbers with 1 digit in them, as 10 and 1 are
&gt; different. It does not apply if you have a list of 100 numbers with 2
&gt; digits in them. AP's list of 9,8,7,...,1 is a non sequitur, a red

&gt; (2) AP claims that the number D obtained from Cantor's diagonalization
&gt; is in the list. In his sloppy mannor of &quot;proving&quot; things, he does not
&gt; say which specific item on the list D is. The truth is: He can't. On
&gt; his initial list of P-adics, the Nth digit of the Nth P-adic differs
&gt; from the Nth digit of D, for all N. Hence D cannot be _any_ P-adic on
&gt; the list. He is only confusing himself.

&gt; (3) AP's &quot;axiom&quot; that &quot;there is only one type of infinity&quot; (which is

&gt; flawed fact: The reciprocal of infinity is not zero; it is an

Maybe I should change the title of this new textbook to read:
&quot;Mathematical-Physics (p-adic primer) for Univesity professors of
math and onwards&quot;

I say that sarcastically because I know if I walk into any High School
in the USA or England or
Europe and say to them

Do you know it it means to be All Possible Digit Arrangements?

There will be alot of hands raised by High School Students who know
what the concept of
All Possible Digit Arrangements means.

Alot of them will know what *ALL* means.

So the second question would be, then, now Cantor has a diagonal where
he changes one digit
in every number of his INFINITE list of numbers.

Can that new Cantor number be not on the list?

There will be many and many High School students who instantly
recognize that no matter what
Cantor does, whether he does a double somersault diagonal or even a
Olympic triple somersault
that there is no escaping from the word ALL and no escaping of ALL
POSSIBLE DIGIT ARRANGEMENTS.

That no matter what Cantor does, he can never find a number not on the
list of All Possible
Digit Arrangements.

So it is little wonder to me that some bozo in Arizona State
University who could never admit to
his mistake about his flawed Euclid Infinitude of Primes proof and who
is interested in hatemongering
then in ever learning anything, that when a person has no respect for
the other person whom they
engage in a conversation, that it is little wonder they keep acting
like a bozo that they are.

Even a bright 6 year old is smarter than this Arizona State University
professor who cannot grasp what
All Possible Digit Arrangements means, and that no Cantor method can
scrounge up a number that
is not in that list. Regardless of whether the list is finite or
infinite. When you say ALL, means there
is no room for some unlisted number.

I do not know how many posts the above Arizona State chap has made
saying that &quot;I do not
understand Cantor&quot;, but it is obvious that he is so ridden with hatred
and unwilling to ever admit
his mistakes, that I seldom read his posts and only reply when it
serves me to further my ideas.

It is sad in the USA education system, that educators are hesitant to
sit and counsel a college
professor who is lost in hatred.

Now here is a second example of a bozo who posts to sci.math. The
first example
is the Arizona State University professor who spams hatred and seldom
any wisdom
or information.

But the problem of the above second bozo is a problem that is often
occurring in colleges
and universities and which should be addressed in this book.

It is a problem I am very closely familar with because of my
experience in the 1970s of a
math classroom where a student was there who would make a &quot;horrible
math teacher&quot; and
yet the University never seemed to try to persuade this student that
math education was never
his path in life and that he would probably go out and  make a
miserable math teacher and
ruin an hour of every class day for a large number of students.

The problem is that our large Universities have little time to counsel
and guidance those students
who clearly are in the wrong career path. And these large colleges
have professors who do not have
the &quot;heart&quot; to tell a student that he is not meant to be a
mathematician or a math teacher and
that his true calling is really somewhere else.

So our Colleges and Universities fail miserably in guidance and
probably one of the biggest strong
suits of a small College is that such guidance exists, or can exist to
save alot of students of the
misery of graduating in a subject or field that they will be miserable
in.

I do not remember the first post of Ken Quirici, but usually for me I
can tell if a person is a oaf
or buffoon of mathematics by the first or second post. And I knew Ken
was an oaf by his second
post, but I have the tendency to use oafs. I use them to act as a
&quot;filler&quot;. When I have an oaf
like Chris Heckman, he is a better oaf than is Ken Quirici. So I do
not killfile all oafs because
then my discussion becomes more of a monologue and that repulses other
readers. So I use these
oafs to make the conversation look like a conversation.

And there is a huge difference between Chris Heckman and Ken Quirici.
Chris at least has the ability
to understand mathematics, when he does not let his hatred flood his
mind. But Ken does not
have that ability to understand mathematics, at least none of his
posts that I ever read show of
a ability to understand mathematics. Now if Ken has a philosophy
degree, then okay, I can
forgive his oafishness because philosophers waffle on like Ken
waffles. But if Ken has a degree
in mathematics, then that is pretty alarming because I would hazard to
guess that he got it
from a large university that has pitifully low standards where no
professor at that university guided
Ken by saying &quot;Hey, you are not cut out for mathematics&quot;.

Now one possibility is that Ken went to one of these large
Universities which had few guidance
couselors and where the math professors did not have the heart to tell
Ken, that math was beyond
him and that Ken should go into Accounting or Hotel Managing but not
mathematics.

So one possible answer is that Ken has some physical handicap or some
other handicap and that the
combination of a handicap and a large University that none of the
professors there had the heart
to tell Ken, math is beyond you, and that instead they graduated Ken.

So, yes, I should bring up a slice of Education System in the USA, in
a book written to teach
students what the P-adics are and the best way to make the P-adics
available to a High School
Student.

&gt; &gt; mathematical methods, a number not in the list.

&gt; &gt; If you by valid means use A to derive ~A, then A can't be true.

&gt; Now here is a second example of a bozo who posts to sci.math. The
&gt; first example
&gt; is the Arizona State University professor who spams hatred and seldom
&gt; any wisdom
&gt; or information.

&gt; But the problem of the above second bozo is a problem that is often
&gt; occurring in colleges
&gt; and universities and which should be addressed in this book.

&gt; It is a problem I am very closely familar with because of my
&gt; experience in the 1970s of a
&gt; math classroom where a student was there who would make a &quot;horrible
&gt; math teacher&quot; and
&gt; yet the University never seemed to try to persuade this student that
&gt; math education was never
&gt; his path in life and that he would probably go out and  make a
&gt; miserable math teacher and
&gt; ruin an hour of every class day for a large number of students.

&gt; The problem is that our large Universities have little time to counsel
&gt; and guidance those students
&gt; who clearly are in the wrong career path. And these large colleges
&gt; have professors who do not have
&gt; the &quot;heart&quot; to tell a student that he is not meant to be a
&gt; mathematician or a math teacher and
&gt; that his true calling is really somewhere else.

&gt; So our Colleges and Universities fail miserably in guidance and
&gt; probably one of the biggest strong
&gt; suits of a small College is that such guidance exists, or can exist to
&gt; save alot of students of the
&gt; misery of graduating in a subject or field that they will be miserable
&gt; in.

&gt; I do not remember the first post of Ken Quirici, but usually for me I
&gt; can tell if a person is a oaf
&gt; or buffoon of mathematics by the first or second post. And I knew Ken
&gt; was an oaf by his second
&gt; post, but I have the tendency to use oafs. I use them to act as a
&gt; &quot;filler&quot;. When I have an oaf
&gt; like Chris Heckman, he is a better oaf than is Ken Quirici. So I do
&gt; not killfile all oafs because
&gt; then my discussion becomes more of a monologue and that repulses other
&gt; readers. So I use these
&gt; oafs to make the conversation look like a conversation.

&gt; And there is a huge difference between Chris Heckman and Ken Quirici.
&gt; Chris at least has the ability
&gt; to understand mathematics, when he does not let his hatred flood his
&gt; mind. But Ken does not
&gt; have that ability to understand mathematics, at least none of his
&gt; posts that I ever read show of
&gt; a ability to understand mathematics. Now if Ken has a philosophy
&gt; degree, then okay, I can
&gt; forgive his oafishness because philosophers waffle on like Ken
&gt; waffles. But if Ken has a degree
&gt; in mathematics, then that is pretty alarming because I would hazard to
&gt; guess that he got it
&gt; from a large university that has pitifully low standards where no
&gt; professor at that university guided
&gt; Ken by saying &quot;Hey, you are not cut out for mathematics&quot;.

&gt; Now one possibility is that Ken went to one of these large
&gt; Universities which had few guidance
&gt; couselors and where the math professors did not have the heart to tell
&gt; Ken, that math was beyond
&gt; him and that Ken should go into Accounting or Hotel Managing but not
&gt; mathematics.

&gt; So one possible answer is that Ken has some physical handicap or some
&gt; other handicap and that the
&gt; combination of a handicap and a large University that none of the
&gt; professors there had the heart
&gt; to tell Ken, math is beyond you, and that instead they graduated Ken.

&gt; So, yes, I should bring up a slice of Education System in the USA, in
&gt; a book written to teach
&gt; students what the P-adics are and the best way to make the P-adics
&gt; available to a High School

Unbelievable. Not a word about my argument. When I
think back on the probably 2 or 3 years I've been
posting to his threads, and how inane and childish
his attempts at mathematics are, and the outlandish
arrogance he manifests, and the refusal to
acknowledge error (and anybody who's posted here
is quite aware of how willing I am to acknowledge
my own errors), and the refusal to hear any
contradiction of his hideous 'theories', and
they are ugly, truly ugly, his ideas, it's clear
I've been wasting a lot of my time. And it's
my own fault for not pulling the plug a lot
sooner.

The Drexel Math Forum pegs the above author as a Brian Quincy Hutchins

So the Uncle Al posts are several people such as Hutchins as Baez all
going under
one name Uncle Al. And of course Hutchins branches out into other
silly fake names
such as the above.

Anyway, in life, if you have to pretend to be someone else or
consistently hide behind
fake names then you are squandering your life.

In youth we often have heroes and pretend to be them, but then we grow
up, but we do not
grow up properly or mature if we still are playing these childish kid
games of pretension.

One of the reasons or better yet excuses for an Uncle Al is to air a
pitiful new theory of
physics, and Baez too ashamed to air it under his name so he airs it
under the name
Uncle Al.

I peg Hutchins as the primary author of the above &quot;stooopid post&quot; for
his hyphenations
and other language fingerprints.

And it is a shame that Baez is in education, for he really never did
grow up by hiding behind
fake names.

&gt; Things AP does not understand about Cantor's method:
&gt; (1) What it shows is that you cannot have a list of N numbers with N
&gt; digits that lists all the N-digit numbers. Hence, it doesn't apply if
&gt; you have a list of 10 numbers with 1 digit in them, as 10 and 1 are
&gt; different. It does not apply if you have a list of 100 numbers with 2
&gt; digits in them. AP's list of 9,8,7,...,1 is a non sequitur, a red
&gt; herring.
&gt; (2) AP claims that the number D obtained from Cantor's diagonalization
&gt; is in the list. In his sloppy mannor of &quot;proving&quot; things, he does not
&gt; say which specific item on the list D is. The truth is: He can't. On
&gt; his initial list of P-adics, the Nth digit of the Nth P-adic differs
&gt; from the Nth digit of D, for all N. Hence D cannot be _any_ P-adic on
&gt; the list. He is only confusing himself.
&gt; (3) AP's &quot;axiom&quot; that &quot;there is only one type of infinity&quot; (which is
&gt; at odds with Cantor's proof; hence the antagonism) is based on a
&gt; flawed fact: The reciprocal of infinity is not zero; it is an
&gt; infinitesimal. If you're going to treat infinity as a number, then
&gt; zero times infinity is still zero.

Obviously both Heckman and Quirici believe Cantor is correct and
right. And they
both believe that a diagonal will scrounge up a new Real that was not
on the list
of all Reals (between 0 and 1).

I keep telling them, but they are both blind, that All Possible Digit
Arrangements is
so full, that no diagonal can create a new number that is not already
there.

I have shown both Heckman and Quirici how it is impossible to
diagonalize finite place
value set of All Digit Arrangements, and impossible to extract any new
number from that
universe of place value. And because of infinite place value makes no
difference, since
All Possible Digit Arrangements goes beyond any diagonal procedure.
Still, both Heckman
and Quirici are blinded.

So, here, ....

Here is a number in the list of all Reals which is a number in the All
Possible Digit Arrangements
but is a number that no Cantor Diagonal can ever create:

099999999.......9999999999999999999999990

Cantor cannot craft or forge that Real Number by means of a diagonal
because there are alot
of numbers where the diagonal lands on a &quot;9&quot; and where Cantor is
obliged to change that 9
to something else.

So, I have given you a number that exists in All Possible Digit
Arrangements, but is a number
impossible for Cantor's diagonal to fetch.

So, to those that still believe Cantor had any truth, then the burden
is on them to explain why
Cantor's diagonal breaks apart in the face of All Possible Digit
Arrangements and why this set
is larger than Cantor's set.

I can easily answer that question. Cantor, like Zeno's paradox, was
never on the truth of the Reals
but that Cantor was a falsehood.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How many times do you have to be told? Cantor assumed he had

&gt; &gt; &gt; Then he derived from that list a number which is not on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; list no matter how hard you kick and scream. It's not on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; list because it's constructed to be not on the list.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you claim it's a list of all possible digit arrangements, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; number derived is STILL not on the list because it's constructed
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be not on the list. This is what's called a proof by
&gt; &gt; &gt; contradiction. You assume it has all possible digit arrangements
&gt; &gt; &gt; (if you choose - or you can choose all reals - or you can choose
&gt; &gt; &gt; any countable set of reals) and then derive, by valid
&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematical methods, a number not in the list.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you by valid means use A to derive ~A, then A can't be true.

&gt; Obviously both Heckman and Quirici believe Cantor is correct and
&gt; right. And they
&gt; both believe that a diagonal will scrounge up a new Real that was not
&gt; on the list
&gt; of all Reals (between 0 and 1).

&gt; I keep telling them, but they are both blind, that All Possible Digit
&gt; Arrangements is
&gt; so full, that no diagonal can create a new number that is not already
&gt; there.

&gt; I have shown both Heckman and Quirici how it is impossible to
&gt; diagonalize finite place
&gt; value set of All Digit Arrangements, and impossible to extract any new
&gt; number from that
&gt; universe of place value. And because of infinite place value makes no
&gt; difference, since
&gt; All Possible Digit Arrangements goes beyond any diagonal procedure.
&gt; Still, both Heckman
&gt; and Quirici are blinded.

&gt; So, here, ....

&gt; Here is a number in the list of all Reals which is a number in the All
&gt; Possible Digit Arrangements
&gt; but is a number that no Cantor Diagonal can ever create:

&gt; 099999999.......9999999999999999999999990

&gt; Cantor cannot craft or forge that Real Number by means of a diagonal
&gt; because there are alot
&gt; of numbers where the diagonal lands on a &quot;9&quot; and where Cantor is
&gt; obliged to change that 9
&gt; to something else.

&gt; So, I have given you a number that exists in All Possible Digit
&gt; Arrangements, but is a number
&gt; impossible for Cantor's diagonal to fetch.

&gt; So, to those that still believe Cantor had any truth, then the burden
&gt; is on them to explain why
&gt; Cantor's diagonal breaks apart in the face of All Possible Digit
&gt; Arrangements and why this set
&gt; is larger than Cantor's set.

&gt; I can easily answer that question. Cantor, like Zeno's paradox, was
&gt; never on the truth of the Reals
&gt; but that Cantor was a falsehood.

Since Barb Knox believes the work of AP is rubbish, well, I ask of the
students there in
England where Barb teaches, to go to Barb and ask her how the Cantor
diagonal program
is able to function under All Possible Digit Arrangements.

And I hope some of those students can thence report back to this
sci.math newsgroup in
this thread as to what Barb was able or unable to explain.

because the diagonal process lands on a 7 digit somewhere and is

So All Possible Digit Arrangements has an infinite supply of numbers

So what does that tell a reasoned and logical person? It should tell
the reasoned and logical

so filled up completely
that any number which Cantor's diagonal yields or coughs up, is
already existing within the list
itself.

This is what I keep harping that a bright High School kid whose mind

anything that Cantor cranks out, is just a one example of All Possible

And you are utterly wrong. Let me show why.

There are the mirror image of Reals called P-adics. Instead of
infinite rightward string, these
P-adics are infinite leftward strings.

And a complete list of these P-adics is begot from All Possible Digit
Arrangements

Starting with ......00000000000000

then

.....00000000001

going all the way up to .......999999998 then .......9999999

Now give me any infinite integer number you wish to give me. It is one
of All Possible
Digit Arrangements.

And once you given me such a number I can immediately tell you of its
predecessor
and its successor.

That means I can COUNT from 0, 1, all the way up to
9999999.....9999999

So here, I have All Possible Digit Arrangements of infinite leftward
strings which are P-adics
and they are Countable and Infinite and no Cantor Diagonal is going to
find a P-adic not on
that list.

Now, easily, I merely shift the mirror to Reals which are Infinite
rightward strings. Give me any
Real number between 0 and 1 as an Infinite Digit Arrangement and I can
tell you what the predecessor
and successor of that Real is. Thus, the Reals between 0 and 1 are
Countable.

And, above all, the moment you perform a Cantor diagonal, well, I beat
you to it, because it already
is in the list as just another example of one Possible Digit
Arrangement.

Can you see your fallacy of your mind Peter? Can you see in your mind
that All Possible Digit
Arrangements precludes you handing me any number that is not in the
list.

I know the concept of infinity may be difficult for you Peter, but I
never would imagine that the
concept of All in All Possible Digit Arrangements should be difficult
for you.

The only way Cantor's Diagonal can defeat All Possible Digit
Arrangements is for there to exist
a Real Number which cannot be represented as a digit arrangement.

Now this book does point out there are numbers which cannot exist as
digit arrangements and they
are the two transcendental numbers of pi and (e). This book, like my
other books tells us that
the difference between a Algebraic and Transcendental number is that
an Algebraic number is
one of All Possible Digit Arrangements and that (pi) and (e) stop at
some place-value where there is
no digit in that place value and beyond. So that pi and (e) are
growing numbers trying to grow up
to be a Real Number and are dependent on the time clock of the Cosmos.

The concept of Transcendental Numbers in the historical time period of
Cantor was primitive.

So, Peter, the only way you or anyone can defeat All Possible Digit
Arrangements as the definition
of Reals is for the Cantor diagonal to pull up a number that has no
digits in at least one place value.
But if anyone does that, would that be a Real Number if it had no
digit in a place value? Of course not.

So the summary is that all of Cantor's transfinite work is wet and
invalid and wrong and
erroneous.

You sure? In some contexts(*), the &quot;reciprocal&quot; of zero
is defined as &quot;infinity&quot;, so then the &quot;reciprocal&quot; of &quot;infinity&quot; there
is defined as *zero* -- no infinitesimals. But that has nothing to do
with set-theoretic infinities, ie. Cantor theory, and hence AP is
still wrong. But I just thought I'd point something out. In other
contexts, such as the so-called &quot;surreal&quot; numbers, which include the
infinite ordinal numbers as well as infinitesimal numbers, then you
(not AP) may be right. It really depends on the context.

(*) Ex. the real/complex projective line has a point called &quot;infinity&quot;
attached, to which 1/0 is _defined_ to equal this. Of course then

That's only half of the argument. It's not surprising that AP can't
recognize a valid reducio ad absurdum proof of the Infinitude of
Primes. After all, he says, &quot;If {p1, p2, ..., pn} is the set of all
primes, then p1*p2*...*pn-1 must be prime.&quot; He doesn't realize there's
another half to reducio proofs; namely to show that p1*p2*...*pn-1
cannot possibly be prime, which completes the argument.

his B.A. in Mathematics (at an Ohio college) and moved to Utah, he
moved to Australia a short time afterwards.* I suspect what happened
was that in a class, that the professor asked AP (who then called
himself Ludwig Hanson,* his adopted name) to prove something, and AP
and the class realized that he couldn't prove it. Another of the
graduate students, who had a nervous habit of playing with his/her
hair, went up to the board and provided a short proof. Being
embarrassed must have taken its toll, causing him to quit graduate
school. Furthermore, he found out that his BA degree couldn't get him
a job in the United States, so he ended up in Australia as a tutor.*
He only came back when his adopted father died and left some or all of
his money to AP.* ... Of course, this is all speculation.

Is that why you hate Mathematics and mathematicians, then, AP? Because

&gt; I do not remember the first post of Ken Quirici, but usually for me I

&gt; not killfile all oafs because
&gt; then my discussion becomes more of a monologue and that repulses other
&gt; readers. So I use these
&gt; oafs to make the conversation look like a conversation.

Now that e-mail I got from KQ is starting to make sense. AP is not
motivated by whether his mathematics is correct; he just wants someone
that he can sling mud at, while claiming he's a genius.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And there is a huge difference between Chris Heckman and Ken Quirici.
&gt; Chris at least has the ability
&gt; to understand mathematics, when he does not let his hatred flood his
&gt; mind. But Ken does not
&gt; have that ability to understand mathematics, at least none of his
&gt; posts that I ever read show of
&gt; a ability to understand mathematics. Now if Ken has a philosophy
&gt; degree, then okay, I can
&gt; forgive his oafishness because philosophers waffle on like Ken
&gt; waffles. But if Ken has a degree
&gt; in mathematics, then that is pretty alarming because I would hazard to
&gt; guess that he got it
&gt; from a large university that has pitifully low standards where no
&gt; professor at that university guided
&gt; Ken by saying &quot;Hey, you are not cut out for mathematics&quot;.
">

Well, at least it's not a Bachelors of Art. It isn't, is it, KQ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now one possibility is that Ken went to one of these large
&gt; Universities which had few guidance
&gt; couselors and where the math professors did not have the heart to tell
&gt; Ken, that math was beyond
&gt; him and that Ken should go into Accounting or Hotel Managing but not
&gt; mathematics.
">

One had to wonder what kind of counselling _AP_ got when he was in
college. My guess is that no one ever told him that he didn't have to
study mathematics. Or else he didn't listen. Certainly, when I
suggested that AP turn his &quot;Atom Totality Universe&quot; into a novel (the
L. Ron Hubbard approach), he didn't take _that_ suggestion, even
though he could approach it as &quot;fact disguised as fiction&quot;.

But I do have to admit that AP is right about one thing, and this is
an issue which came up a few months ago at ASU: The counselling here
leaves much to be desired. The department is thinking of hiring one
person who would serve as a full-time counsel, regarding classes. It
seems that the advisors in other, non-technical, departments aren't
sure which math classes they should send their students to ...

--- Christopher Heckman

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So one possible answer is that Ken has some physical handicap or some
&gt; other handicap and that the
&gt; combination of a handicap and a large University that none of the
&gt; professors there had the heart
&gt; to tell Ken, math is beyond you, and that instead they graduated Ken.

&gt; So, yes, I should bring up a slice of Education System in the USA, in

Exactly, and I take it the above is base 2, or 2-adics to two place
value.

When a mind has only one solo concept of running a diagonal, then that
mind is susceptible
to a fraud scam.

But when a mind has two concepts to grapple with, where one concept
grapples and wrestles
with the other concept. Where All Possible Digit Arrangements wrestles
with Diagonal creation,
then can one begin to find the real truth of the matter.

Cantor never played two concepts with Diagonal and when a weak mind in
mathematics comes
running up to a picture where you change one digit in each number of a
column of numbers, that
weak mind would collapse into agreement that the diagonal number is
not in the original list.

But when the weak mind is presented with Two concepts that the list is
every possible digit arrangement
for a given place value, from place value 1 to infinity, that no
matter what the diagonal creates,
the diagonal number already exists within the list itself.

So many oafs have responded to this thread, like parrots, because they
were force fed the
Cantor argument, and their weak minds can never see how a list could
ever yield a diagonal number not
that was already in the list itself.

But when you slowly show people that any list, no matter if finite
place value or infinite place value, that
if that list is all possible digit arrangements then that list will
NEVER yield a new diagonal number not
in the list. That every diagonal number formed from such a list is
already well inside the list itself.

So as Androcles shows above of 2 place value 2-adics

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 00
&gt; 01
&gt; 10
&gt; 11
">

That any Cantor diagonal will only repeat one of the numbers already
on the list.

Some oafs will carp that the list is not infinite. The reply is that
it does not matter if the list is
finite or infinite. What generates the repeating of the Diagonal
number is the fact that All Possible
Digit Arrangements is immune to any diagonal process.

So if Cantor, way back in 1870s had realized about All Possible Digit
Arrangements as the proper
definition of Reals, the world would have been spared of a 137 years
of false and fake mathematics
of transfinite numbers.

This may be due to the fact they're utterly unable to grasp concepts

I bought a copy of Martin Gardner's _In The Name of Science_ a few
weeks ago. AP's recent &quot;ejaculation of hatred&quot; reminded me of a few
things that Gardner says in his introduction. Keep in mind that this
was written in 1952, and so does not apply to anyone in particular

***

There is a type of self-styled scientist who can legitimately be
called a crank. It is not the novelty of his views or the neurotic
motivations behind his work that provide the grounds for calling him
this. The grounds are the technical criteria by which theories are
evaluated. If a man persists in advancing views that are contradicted
by all available evidence, and which offer no reasonable grounds for
serious consideration, he will rightfully be dubbed a crank by his
colleagues.

Cranks vary widely in both knowledge and intelligence. Some are
stupid, ignorant, almost illiterate men who confine their activities
to sending &quot;crank letters&quot; to prominent scientists. Some produce
crudely written pamphlets, usually published by the author himself,
with long titles, and pictures of the author on the cover. Still
others are brilliant and well-educated, often with an excellent
understanding the branch of science in which they are speculating.
Their books can be highly deceptive imitations of the genuine
article---well-written and impressively learned. In spite of these
wide variations, however, most pseudo-scientists have a number of
characteristics in common.

First and most important of these traits is that cranks work in almost
total isolation from their colleagues, ... in the sense of having no
fruitful contacts with fellow researchers. In the Renaissance, this
isolation was not necessarily a sign of the crank ... [However],
today, these social conditions no longer obtain.

The modern crank insists that his isolation is not desired on his
part. It is due, he claims, to the prejudice of established scientific
groups against new ideas. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Scientific journals today are filled with bizarre theories; if
anything, scientific journals err on the side of permitting
questionable theses to be published, so they may be discussed and
checked in the hope of finding something of value. Oten the quickest
road to fame is to overturn a firmly-held belief. Einstein's work on
relativity is the outstanding example. Although it met with
considerable opposition at first, it was on the whole an intelligent
opposition. With few exceptions, none of Einstein's reputable
opponents dismissed him as a crackpot. They could not so dismiss him
because for years he contributed brilliant articles to the journals
and had won wide recognition as a theoretical physicist. ...

It would be foolish, of course, to deny that history contains many sad
examples of novel scientific views which did not receive an unbiased
hearing, and which later proved to be true. The pseudo-scientist never
tires in reminding his readers of these cases. ...

The modern pseudo-scientist stands entirely outside the closely
integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and
evaluated. He works in isolation. He does not send his findings to the
recognized journals, or if he does, they are rejected for reasons
which in the vast majority of cases are excellent. In most cases the
crank is not well enough informed to write a paper with even a surface
resemblance to a significant study. As a consequence, he finds himself
excluded from the journals and societies, and almost universally
ignored by the competent workers in his field. In fact, the reputable
scientist does not even know of the crank's existence unless his work
is given wide-spread publicity through non-academic channels, or
unless the scientist makes a hobby of collecting crank literature. The
eccentric is forced, therefore, to trod a lonely way. He speaks before
organizations he himself has founded, contributes to journals he
himself may edit, and---until recently---publishes books only when he
or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed
privately.

A second characteristic of the pseudo-scientist, which greatly
strengthens his isolation, is a tendency towards paranoia. This is a
mental condition (to quote a recent textbook) &quot;marked by chronic,
systemized, gradually developing delusions, without hallucinations and
with little tendency toward deterioration, remission, or
recovery.&quot; ... It is easy to understand that a strong sense of
personal greatness must be involved whenever a crank stands in
solitary, bitter opposition to every recognized authority in his
field.

If the self-stylized scientist is rationalizing strong religious
convictions, his paranoid drives may be reduced to a minimum. ...
Otherwise the pseudo-scientist would lack the stamina to fight a
vigorous, single-handed battle against such overwhelming odds. If the
crank is insincere---interested only in making money, playing a hoax,
or both---the obviously paranoia need not enter his make-up. ... There
are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-scientist's paranoid
tendencies are likely to be exhibited.

(1) He considers himself a genius.

(2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as ignorant
blockheads. Everyone is out of step except himself. Frequently he
insults his opponents by accusing them of stupidity, dishonesty, or
other base motives. If they ignore him, he takes this to mean his
arguments are unanswerable. If they retaliate in kind, this
strengthens his delusion that he is battling scoundrels. ... Sooner or
later, almost every pseudo-scientist expresses similar sentiments.

(3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated against.
The recognized societies refuse to let him lecture. The journals
reject his papers and either ignore his books or assign them to
&quot;enemies&quot; for review. It is all part of a dastardly plot. It never
occurs to the crank that his opposition may be due to error in his
work. It springs solely, he is convinced, from blind prejudice on the
part of the established hierarchy---the high priests of science who
fear to have their orthodoxy overthrown.

Vicious slanders and unprovoked attacks, he usually insists, are
constantly being made against him. ... If he has had no formal
training in the field in which he works, he will attribute this
persecution to a scientific masonry, unwilling to admit into its inner
sanctums anyone who has not gone through the proper initiation
rituals. He repeatedly calls your attention to important scientific
discoveries made by laymen.

(4) He has strong compulsions to focus his attacks on the greatest
scientists and the best-established theories. ... This same defiance
can be seen in a tendency to assert the diametrical opposite of well-
established beliefs. ...

(5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex jargon, in many
cases making use of terms and phrases he himself has coined.
Schizophrenics sometimes talk in what psychiatrists call
&quot;neologisms&quot;---words which have meaning to the patient, but sound like
Jabberwocky to everyone else. Many of the classics of crackpot science
exhibit a neologistic tendency.

When the crank's I.Q. is low, he rarely achieves much of a following.
But if he is a brilliant thinker, he is capable of developing
incredibly complex theories. He will be able to defend them in books
of vast erudition, with profound observation and often liberal
portions of sound science. His rhetoric may be enormously persuasive.
All the parts of his world usually fit together beautifully, like a
jig-saw puzzle. It is impossible to get the best of him in any type of
argument. He has anticipated all your objections. He counters them
with unexpected answers of great ingenuity. Even on the subject of the
shape of the earth, a layman may find himself powerless in a debate
with a flat-earther.

Gardner gives a good description of Einstein, the word &quot;assume&quot;
appears 13 times in his 1905 relativity paper.
Einstein was a type of self-styled scientist who can legitimately be
called a crank.

It is not the novelty of Einstein's views or the neurotic motivations behind
Einstein's work that provide the grounds for calling Einstein this.
The grounds are the technical criteria by which theories are evaluated,
and after 100 years nothing technical has ever come out of special
relativity.

&gt; : motivations behind his work that provide the grounds for calling him
&gt; : this. The grounds are the technical criteria by which theories are
&gt; : evaluated. If a man persists in advancing views that are contradicted
&gt; : by all available evidence, and which offer no reasonable grounds for
&gt; : serious consideration, he will rightfully be dubbed a crank by his
&gt; : colleagues.
&gt; :
&gt; : Cranks vary widely in both knowledge and intelligence. Some are
&gt; : stupid, ignorant, almost illiterate men who confine their activities
&gt; : to sending &quot;crank letters&quot; to prominent scientists. Some produce
&gt; : crudely written pamphlets, usually published by the author himself,
&gt; : with long titles, and pictures of the author on the cover. Still
&gt; : others are brilliant and well-educated, often with an excellent
&gt; : understanding the branch of science in which they are speculating.
&gt; : Their books can be highly deceptive imitations of the genuine
&gt; : article---well-written and impressively learned. In spite of these
&gt; : wide variations, however, most pseudo-scientists have a number of
&gt; : characteristics in common.
&gt; :
&gt; : First and most important of these traits is that cranks work in almost
&gt; : total isolation from their colleagues, ... in the sense of having no
&gt; : fruitful contacts with fellow researchers. In the Renaissance, this
&gt; : isolation was not necessarily a sign of the crank ... [However],
&gt; : today, these social conditions no longer obtain.
&gt; :
&gt; : The modern crank insists that his isolation is not desired on his
&gt; : part. It is due, he claims, to the prejudice of established scientific
&gt; : groups against new ideas. Nothing could be further from the truth.
&gt; : Scientific journals today are filled with bizarre theories; if
&gt; : anything, scientific journals err on the side of permitting
&gt; : questionable theses to be published, so they may be discussed and
&gt; : checked in the hope of finding something of value. Oten the quickest
&gt; : road to fame is to overturn a firmly-held belief. Einstein's work on
&gt; : relativity is the outstanding example. Although it met with
&gt; : considerable opposition at first, it was on the whole an intelligent
&gt; : opposition. With few exceptions, none of Einstein's reputable
&gt; : opponents dismissed him as a crackpot. They could not so dismiss him
&gt; : because for years he contributed brilliant articles to the journals
&gt; : and had won wide recognition as a theoretical physicist. ...
&gt; :
&gt; : It would be foolish, of course, to deny that history contains many sad
&gt; : examples of novel scientific views which did not receive an unbiased
&gt; : hearing, and which later proved to be true. The pseudo-scientist never
&gt; : tires in reminding his readers of these cases. ...
&gt; :
&gt; : The modern pseudo-scientist stands entirely outside the closely
&gt; : integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and
&gt; : evaluated. He works in isolation. He does not send his findings to the
&gt; : recognized journals, or if he does, they are rejected for reasons
&gt; : which in the vast majority of cases are excellent. In most cases the
&gt; : crank is not well enough informed to write a paper with even a surface
&gt; : resemblance to a significant study. As a consequence, he finds himself
&gt; : excluded from the journals and societies, and almost universally
&gt; : ignored by the competent workers in his field. In fact, the reputable
&gt; : scientist does not even know of the crank's existence unless his work
&gt; : is given wide-spread publicity through non-academic channels, or
&gt; : unless the scientist makes a hobby of collecting crank literature. The
&gt; : eccentric is forced, therefore, to trod a lonely way. He speaks before
&gt; : organizations he himself has founded, contributes to journals he
&gt; : himself may edit, and---until recently---publishes books only when he
&gt; : or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed
&gt; : privately.
&gt; :
&gt; : A second characteristic of the pseudo-scientist, which greatly
&gt; : strengthens his isolation, is a tendency towards paranoia. This is a
&gt; : mental condition (to quote a recent textbook) &quot;marked by chronic,
&gt; : systemized, gradually developing delusions, without hallucinations and
&gt; : with little tendency toward deterioration, remission, or
&gt; : recovery.&quot; ... It is easy to understand that a strong sense of
&gt; : personal greatness must be involved whenever a crank stands in
&gt; : solitary, bitter opposition to every recognized authority in his
&gt; : field.
&gt; :
&gt; : If the self-stylized scientist is rationalizing strong religious
&gt; : convictions, his paranoid drives may be reduced to a minimum. ...
&gt; : Otherwise the pseudo-scientist would lack the stamina to fight a
&gt; : vigorous, single-handed battle against such overwhelming odds. If the
&gt; : crank is insincere---interested only in making money, playing a hoax,
&gt; : or both---the obviously paranoia need not enter his make-up. ... There

Although I wouldn't literally do that, and for somewhat

the fascination to some extent.

I confess to a certain degree of morbid fascination with
JSH (although I try not to interact with him too much,
and usually have him killfiled, although I don't at the
moment).  I like to compare and contrast his psychology
with mine, to &quot;find my inner James Harris&quot;, as someone
so memorably put it.  And in his own way he writes both
amusingly and coherently, even though he's as daft as a
brush.  I don't feel any similar kinship with AP, but
perhaps that's because I just happen not to have paid
him as much attention.

So I don't grudge you your interest; I just wish there
were fewer postings on this one single topic which, at
least for the moment, doesn't interest me.

No, you are not playing by the rules of Cantor. If you draw out all
3place values then 101 is
among them.

But the INFINITY PLACE VALUE is where the Cantor fallacy really comes
to light and comes
to life.

In the 2 place value there are at most two numbers which the diagonal
always misses. That
means the Diagonal Cantor Set is always smaller in size than the All
Possible Digit Arrangement
Set. And since the All Possible Digit Arrangement Set is always
countable, whether finite or
infinite, means the Cantor Set is a worthless set.

Peter should be able to figure out or compute how many numbers the
Cantor Diagonal misses
in the 3 place value, in the 4 place value.

I know how many numbers the Cantor set misses in the Infinite Place
Value of All Possible
Digit Arrangements. It misses an infinity of Reals.

The Cantor Diagonal misses an infinity of Reals that look like this

.......99999999xyz

and an infinity of Reals that look like this

.....000000000xyz

How is that possible you ask? Because as the diagonal must change at
least one digit in
every place value, it is impossible for the Diagonal to spit out a
number such as
.....000000000000000

or

......111111111111111

It is impossible to spit or produce those numbers because there are an
infinite 1s and no number
in the Diagonal escapes from seeing at least a 9 or 8 or 7  or 6 or 5
or 4 or 3 or 2 or 1 or 0
digit.

So as Androcles showed you, Peter, how the Cantor diagonal is unable
to yield a new
number not on this list

00
01
10
11

But that list is in surplus of two numbers which the Diagonal always
misses.

Cantor and his silly followers envisioned a partial set and run a
diagonal over a partial set and
yes you will construct a number not already in the list. But when your
list is All Possible
Digit Arrangements, then Cantor diagonal falls to pieces.

Yes, Einstein attacked Newton, Galileo and Copernicus and the principle of
relativity.

&quot;Prominent theoretical physicists were therefore more inclined to reject the
principle of relativity, in spite of the fact that no empirical data had
been found which were contradictory to this principle.&quot; -- Albert Einstein,
self proclaimed &quot;prominent theoretical physicist&quot;.

I agree with Gardner, Einstein was definitely a crank.

: &gt; : There is a type of self-styled scientist who can legitimately be
: &gt; : called a crank. It is not the novelty of his views or the neurotic
: &gt; : motivations behind his work that provide the grounds for calling him
: &gt; : this. The grounds are the technical criteria by which theories are
: &gt; : evaluated. If a man persists in advancing views that are contradicted
: &gt; : by all available evidence, and which offer no reasonable grounds for
: &gt; : serious consideration, he will rightfully be dubbed a crank by his
: &gt; : colleagues.
: &gt; :
: &gt; : Cranks vary widely in both knowledge and intelligence. Some are
: &gt; : stupid, ignorant, almost illiterate men who confine their activities
: &gt; : to sending &quot;crank letters&quot; to prominent scientists. Some produce
: &gt; : crudely written pamphlets, usually published by the author himself,
: &gt; : with long titles, and pictures of the author on the cover. Still
: &gt; : others are brilliant and well-educated, often with an excellent
: &gt; : understanding the branch of science in which they are speculating.
: &gt; : Their books can be highly deceptive imitations of the genuine
: &gt; : article---well-written and impressively learned. In spite of these
: &gt; : wide variations, however, most pseudo-scientists have a number of
: &gt; : characteristics in common.
: &gt; :
: &gt; : First and most important of these traits is that cranks work in almost
: &gt; : total isolation from their colleagues, ... in the sense of having no
: &gt; : fruitful contacts with fellow researchers. In the Renaissance, this
: &gt; : isolation was not necessarily a sign of the crank ... [However],
: &gt; : today, these social conditions no longer obtain.
: &gt; :
: &gt; : The modern crank insists that his isolation is not desired on his
: &gt; : part. It is due, he claims, to the prejudice of established scientific
: &gt; : groups against new ideas. Nothing could be further from the truth.
: &gt; : Scientific journals today are filled with bizarre theories; if
: &gt; : anything, scientific journals err on the side of permitting
: &gt; : questionable theses to be published, so they may be discussed and
: &gt; : checked in the hope of finding something of value. Oten the quickest
: &gt; : road to fame is to overturn a firmly-held belief. Einstein's work on
: &gt; : relativity is the outstanding example. Although it met with
: &gt; : considerable opposition at first, it was on the whole an intelligent
: &gt; : opposition. With few exceptions, none of Einstein's reputable
: &gt; : opponents dismissed him as a crackpot. They could not so dismiss him
: &gt; : because for years he contributed brilliant articles to the journals
: &gt; : and had won wide recognition as a theoretical physicist. ...
: &gt; :
: &gt; : It would be foolish, of course, to deny that history contains many sad
: &gt; : examples of novel scientific views which did not receive an unbiased
: &gt; : hearing, and which later proved to be true. The pseudo-scientist never
: &gt; : tires in reminding his readers of these cases. ...
: &gt; :
: &gt; : The modern pseudo-scientist stands entirely outside the closely
: &gt; : integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and
: &gt; : evaluated. He works in isolation. He does not send his findings to the
: &gt; : recognized journals, or if he does, they are rejected for reasons
: &gt; : which in the vast majority of cases are excellent. In most cases the
: &gt; : crank is not well enough informed to write a paper with even a surface
: &gt; : resemblance to a significant study. As a consequence, he finds himself
: &gt; : excluded from the journals and societies, and almost universally
: &gt; : ignored by the competent workers in his field. In fact, the reputable
: &gt; : scientist does not even know of the crank's existence unless his work
: &gt; : is given wide-spread publicity through non-academic channels, or
: &gt; : unless the scientist makes a hobby of collecting crank literature. The
: &gt; : eccentric is forced, therefore, to trod a lonely way. He speaks before
: &gt; : organizations he himself has founded, contributes to journals he
: &gt; : himself may edit, and---until recently---publishes books only when he
: &gt; : or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed
: &gt; : privately.
: &gt; :
: &gt; : A second characteristic of the pseudo-scientist, which greatly
: &gt; : strengthens his isolation, is a tendency towards paranoia. This is a
: &gt; : mental condition (to quote a recent textbook) &quot;marked by chronic,
: &gt; : systemized, gradually developing delusions, without hallucinations and
: &gt; : with little tendency toward deterioration, remission, or
: &gt; : recovery.&quot; ... It is easy to understand that a strong sense of
: &gt; : personal greatness must be involved whenever a crank stands in
: &gt; : solitary, bitter opposition to every recognized authority in his
: &gt; : field.
: &gt; :
: &gt; : If the self-stylized scientist is rationalizing strong religious
: &gt; : convictions, his paranoid drives may be reduced to a minimum. ...
: &gt; : Otherwise the pseudo-scientist would lack the stamina to fight a
: &gt; : vigorous, single-handed battle against such overwhelming odds. If the
: &gt; : crank is insincere---interested only in making money, playing a hoax,
: &gt; : or both---the obviously paranoia need not enter his make-up. ... There
: &gt; : are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-scientist's paranoid
: &gt; : tendencies are likely to be exhibited.
: &gt; :
: &gt; : (1) He considers himself a genius.
: &gt; :
: &gt; : (2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as ignorant
: &gt; : blockheads. Everyone is out of step except himself. Frequently he
: &gt; : insults his opponents by accusing them of stupidity, dishonesty, or
: &gt; : other base motives. If they ignore him, he takes this to mean his
: &gt; : arguments are unanswerable. If they retaliate in kind, this
: &gt; : strengthens his delusion that he is battling scoundrels. ... Sooner or
: &gt; : later, almost every pseudo-scientist expresses similar sentiments.
: &gt; :
: &gt; : (3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated against.
: &gt; : The recognized societies refuse to let him lecture. The journals
: &gt; : reject his papers and either ignore his books or assign them to
: &gt; : &quot;enemies&quot; for review. It is all part of a dastardly plot. It never
: &gt; : occurs to the crank that his opposition may be due to error in his
: &gt; : work. It springs solely, he is convinced, from blind prejudice on the
: &gt; : part of the established hierarchy---the high priests of science who
: &gt; : fear to have their orthodoxy overthrown.
: &gt; :
: &gt; : Vicious slanders and unprovoked attacks, he usually insists, are
: &gt; : constantly being made against him. ... If he has had no formal
: &gt; : training in the field in which he works, he will attribute this
: &gt; : persecution to a scientific masonry, unwilling to admit into its inner
: &gt; : sanctums anyone who has not gone through the proper initiation
: &gt; : rituals. He repeatedly calls your attention to important scientific
: &gt; : discoveries made by laymen.
: &gt; :
: &gt; : (4) He has strong compulsions to focus his attacks on the greatest
: &gt; : scientists and the best-established theories. ... This same defiance
: &gt; : can be seen in a tendency to assert the diametrical opposite of well-
: &gt; : established beliefs. ...
: &gt; :
: &gt; : (5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex jargon, in many
: &gt; : cases making use of terms and phrases he himself has coined.
: &gt; : Schizophrenics sometimes talk in what psychiatrists call
: &gt; : &quot;neologisms&quot;---words which have meaning to the patient, but sound like
: &gt; : Jabberwocky to everyone else. Many of the classics of crackpot science
: &gt; : exhibit a neologistic tendency.
: &gt; :
: &gt; : When the crank's I.Q. is low, he rarely achieves much of a following.
: &gt; : But if he is a brilliant thinker, he is capable of developing
: &gt; : incredibly complex theories. He will be able to defend them in books
: &gt; : of vast erudition, with profound observation and often liberal
: &gt; : portions of sound science. His rhetoric may be enormously persuasive.
: &gt; : All the parts of his world usually fit together beautifully, like a
: &gt; : jig-saw puzzle. It is impossible to get the best of him in any type of
: &gt; : argument. He has anticipated all your objections. He counters them
: &gt; : with unexpected answers of great ingenuity. Even on the subject of the
: &gt; : shape of the earth, a layman may find himself powerless in a debate
: &gt; : with a flat-earther.
: &gt; :
: &gt; :

Yes, thanks to Androcles, the world now has at least two people who
know better
than Cantor.

And it is funny how reading the history of Cantor who went insane and
was committed
to an insane asylum later in his life because the math community
rejected his work.

And ironic that the 20th century math community would then go on to
accepting this
pile of nonsense about the Reals. So I guess the flow of history has
it where a madman
concocts a diagonal that is a fakery and then the human public of the
20th century
becomes a insane general public that accepts the fakery of a madman.

Look at people like Cohen who wasted his entire lifetime in math over
the Continuum
Hypothesis which is a huge fakery built on top of the Cantor fake.

I wonder if Cohen ever wrote the phrase &quot;All Possible Digit
Arrangements&quot; in any of his
work. Whether he ever had a milligram of brains to realize All
Possible Digit Arrangements
destroys the Continuum Hypothesis.

The Continuum Hypothesis in modern day mathematics is akin to fire
breathing dragons
in biology of the Middle Ages.

Cohen only spent a few years working in set theory.
His speciality was something else before he worked
on the continuum hypothesis (CH) and he did very little
work in the field after he proved the independence
of CH. Even as little as 6 or 7 years after the
announcement of his work on CH, the vast majority
of the work that made use of the techniques Cohen
developed was done by other people.
