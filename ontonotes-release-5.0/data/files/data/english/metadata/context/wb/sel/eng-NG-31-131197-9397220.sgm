SUBJECT: Southern  Komfort Saloon

The new floor at Southern  Komfort Saloon is great! It seems we can dance
longer and our feet and legs  don't hurt so much!! Please take a look at the
floor by going to _ www.myspace.com/fancyboot_ ( http://www.myspace.com/fancyboot )
There are  several pictures of some of the dancers and the floor. We do mostly
country, but  we also do some of the really popular dances like A Gigolo,
Zjozzoy's Funk, To  Love Somebody, Bridge Over Troubled Water, and Stand By Me
Cha.
Beginner line  dance classes are offered on Thursday at 7:30 and more
difficult dances are  taught on Fridays at 7:00.

Subject:  Correction

Shim Sham Boogie was choreographed by Susan Clark and Bonnie KING -- my
apologies, Bonnie! I know a Bonnie Hunt as well and realized almost
immediately that I had mixed things up! Congrats again on the win.

SUBJECT:  The having things on the stepsheets  thread.

The BPM would be nice but I find the majority of these that are there are
way off from the actual pace. Also, the number one &quot;Should Be There Item&quot; item I
find missing on many is the Intro/Count In information.

Subject: Been to two line dance heavens and back
From: Eugenia

1) Singapore and Joyce Lim  (Jus danz):

In June, while visiting my son in Singapore--and spurred by her fantastic
style in online videos--
I visited Joyce Lim's class, and later, her party.

Joyce is not only a beautiful and artistic dancer, she is also an  absolutely
wonderful teacher.
It's an understatement to say that she and her  students are very progressive
and fast learners.
I felt right at home with  them. Joyce teaches new dances choreographed from
all over the globe,
usually when the ink on the script has not even had a chance to dry!

Singapore's LD scene is very vibrant. There are so many classes and socials
to choose from
that you can be any type or level of dancer and there will be  something for
you. Line Dance Heaven
in my book!
2) Southern Calif and  Lou Ann Schemmel &amp; thanks also to Mel Branham, Tom
Araujo and Pati  Fall

I found Lou Ann's web site soon after visiting Mel Branham's Sat. class  over
3 years ago, when I
was just a LD &quot;baby&quot;. I had been observing since and  later following her
teachings when I finally
started to attend the weekend  events on a regular basis. Lou Ann and many of
her students attend
and  support the weekend events often and, in my opinion, have quite an
influence on  the dances
played, especially for the Int/Adv crowd.

In Aug and Sept, I visited family in L.A. twice. Visiting Lou Ann's class
was a must in my book.
Her style of teaching suits me to a &quot;T&quot;, and every  one of her classes is a
mini-social.
It's an understatement to say that I  enjoyed and had great fun in her class.
To her and my dismay,
I had to leave  for home a few days before her Sept socials.

Since I sensed Lou Ann and I have similar taste in dances, I was a little
bold in telling her the dances
I liked. &quot;Burning&quot; is one out in the public.  She liked and picked up, to my
delight, &quot;Bellisimo&quot;
&amp; &quot;Hold On&quot; as new  teachings for the 2 weeks I was there. Such a &quot;cool&quot;
teacher! She is yet to be
receptive about &quot;Let's get saved&quot; and a fun easy party dance, &quot;Mr. Luver,&quot;
though.... :-)

Southern Calif has lots of classes and socials to choose from, thanks to  all
the dedicated teachers in the
area. It is another LD Heaven in my book!

SUBJECT:  MIO  MONDO - reason for the revised script
Because of the last  section was ‘mis read’ by a number of dancers and
instructors the dance has  become a TWO wall version - even though the original
header details clearly said  different…but more confusion was to follow
I originally used a 'remix' of  Patrizio’s ‘You’re My World’ for the dance…
but …unbeknown to me at the time and  until recently, this remix was a special
promotional version and only available  for a very short period to selected
outlets.
To allow this dance to be  performed by more than those who managed to get
hold on the ‘remix’, the album  (and single) version by Patrizio was used -
along with the very distinctive  version by Cilla Black. This meant the ‘restart’
position was had to be  changed…. But I DID keep the TWO wall adaptation.
My apologies for all the  confusion.
Stay bright – Stay happy
Hold on to your dreams

SUBJECT:  DUDLEY NEWLINE DANCES
Hi

This week's new dance was a classic - Gaye Teather's D.H.S.S. to Coffee by
Supersister. An improver dance although quite fast and nippy for beginners!
Went  down well with the arms &quot;Hot, Strong and Sweet&quot; :) of course. Other popular
mainstream dances include The Sailor's Hornpipe (Barbara Lowe), Alfie (Cato
Larsen), Big Girls Boogie (Mavis Broom), Sing Sing Sing (Rafel Corbi) and The
Lemon Tree (Kim Ray).

Popular Newline dances include Helter Skelter (Ayaka Momoko), Rock This
Party (Dawn Parker), Sound Of Freedom (Ryan Hunt), Freak Your Finger (David  Marsh
&amp; Jack Healy) and You Don't Know Me (Ryan Hunt).

What we now have is a 50/50 split between improver/easy intermediate
mainstream and newline dances which is good so that I can keep introducing new
footwork as well as funky moves or arms. Class in good attendance again,  promising
stuff.

Thanks for reading,

Ryan

SUBJECT:  WHAT KAREN STURMEY IS TEACHING IN THE  UK

13 classes so a mixed bag of dances
SNAP CRACKLE  AND POP ALISON AND PETER, WEEK 1 i just love it when i teach a
dance and can  feel the positive vibes coming from the floor. this was a
massive massive hit in  class. the ladies were drooling and melting when josh
turner growls at the  begnning of the track. up tempo country track, the class
luved it even with the  3 tags, which all occur facing front wall the first 3
times so easy to remeber.  you know its a hit dance, when you play the track later
on in the evening and  every bum is off the seats and they dont need
reminding of the steps. happy  class happy me
TO LOVE SOMEBODY PETER AND ALISON WEEK 1 slow dances do not  do well at my
classes at all. but this dance is popular locally so for the  benefit of the
hard core social dancer who travels out and about, i taught it  late on in class.
as already said my classes are very well known for not liking  the slow night
club 2 step type of dance. i persoanlly luv this one.
CHARANGA RACHEAL MCEANEY WEEK 2 a big big hit in all classes.
WHOLE LOT  OF LEAVING ALAN BIRCHALL WEEK 3 this dance is being taught a awful
lot and  locally its on our dance floors. my hard core social dancers are
doing this one,  a lot did get put off by the turns, even though we split the
room in half to  teach it, the big turners on one side, the little turners on the
other. it just  caused a lot of confusion on both sides. just what happened
within my own  classes, nothing personal, as i know elsewhere the dance has
gone down very very  well.

SUBJECT:  TUSCON  DANCE EVENT

Just got back from a  fabulous time at the Tuscon Dance Event (Sept. 21-23)!
How could you go wrong  with John Robinson, Michael Barr, Noel Castle, and
Duane Richards? Then, as a  bonus, add Neil Hale, Kathy Heller, Gary Clayton,
Ano, all of whom I had not had  the previous pleasure of meeting. The space to
dance was great and DOORS OF  LIFE, BROKEN HEART, QUANTUM LEAP, FALLING IN LOVE
TONIGHT, ROCK WITH YOU, HOT  DAMN, BREAD ON THE TABLE, CRAZY CHA were a
terrific set of dances! The only snag  was a scheduling problem of having ZERO time
to travel between classes (the  classes ended and started at exactly the same
time in all three classrooms) -  instructors were hurried and everyone was
under some stress because no one likes  to be flooding into class late,
especially those in the 'older' crowd. I know of  two people who were asked not to
return next year when they voiced their  frustration on the issue. It's a shame
because EVERYONE was pretty much saying  they felt the same way, and the
situation could have been handled easily when it  became apparaent someone had not
thought out the scheduling. We all realize the  hard work and effort it takes to
put these events on and we APPRECIATE all who  do it. We just want to go and
have fun, and I'm sure the organizers want their  &quot;dancers&quot; to be happy also -
so why did it come to this?

SUBJECT:  iTunes at Kickit
FROM: Peter

A commenter mentioned that &quot;Kickit is specifying what songs are on  iTunes&quot;
now, but they would still like the album title to simplify searching  at
iTunes. When you see iTunes mentioned at Kickit, that's not just  an
indicator that the song is at iTunes. It is an actual button you can  click
to go to the page at iTunes.com where you can download the music.  No
searching required. Just click and go. (Watch for another huge online  mp3
provider to show up at Kickit in the next few  days.)
