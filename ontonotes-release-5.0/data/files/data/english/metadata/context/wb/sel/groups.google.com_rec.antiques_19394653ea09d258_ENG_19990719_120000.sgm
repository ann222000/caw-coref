Greetings...

It's time to share a little of my disease with you. Lacking time to scan
my favorite sheets, I won't be posting from my collection just yet.
However, ol' eBay has been a virtual cornucopia of scarce ragtime music
these days.

Here are some I found which I hope will appeal to a few of you here. I'm
not affiliated with the sellers in any way - just showing the kind of
stuff I collect.

Great cover, very good rag:
&lt;http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=130872447&gt;

F. Henri Klickmann was one of those great guys who wrote incredible
music but maintained a very low profile. He later became one of the
founders of the American Accordian Association. He was a sweet looking,
little bespectacled man. Here's one of his really good rags, very scarce:
&lt;http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=131429735&gt;

I thought I'd show you this one... the cover is nice, but not immortal.
The composer, Louis Muir, was also the writer of Ragtime Cowboy Joe and
Waitin' for the Robert E. Lee. This is one of his lesser-known works:
&lt;http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=132072860&gt;

Here is a beautiful cover.. to die for! Lucien Denni was a very
interesting composer - his tunes are wonderful. This piece was published
in Kansas City:
&lt;http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=132074977&gt;

This is one of the weirder subjects for a rag. The writer, Charles L.
Johnson, was part American Indian. He also wrote &quot;Dill Pickles Rag.&quot;:
&lt;http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=132612444&gt;

This is perhaps the most brilliant cover I've ever seen on a rag. I
don't know much about the composer, but it is a really neat tune as
well. This will go for some money:
&lt;http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=133472736&gt;.

Hope you enjoy these!

RAGards,

Tracy

Tracy, neat stuff is right! The ones going for $40 or more... is the
price high because of the great covers, or do folks pay that much for
particular songs?

Have fun, Michele

Hi, Michele...

Thanks for looking. The higher prices generally indicate that the piece
is rare. Very few songs (i.e., tunes with lyrics) ever pull really high
prices unless the covers are outstanding and the piece is scarce. These
tunes which I pointed you to are all instrumental rags, almost all
scarce (I hesitate to say rare - Scott Joplin's &quot;Solace&quot; and &quot;Lily
Queen&quot; are rare) and very desirable for their music *and* their covers.

There are two types of collectors out there - tune collectors and cover
collectors. Prices can really get wild when these two camps begin
battling each other. Usually one group will value a piece more than the
other. An original of Scott Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag has a lousy cover
(except for the very first edition which features art of a cakewalking
couple - extremely rare). However, these are becoming more and more
valuable, especially since the advent of eBay. I'm not sure why.

These days more of the die-hard tune collectors I know are getting on
eBay. I suppose the same thing is true of cover collectors, but I am not
acquainted with most of them. They're easy to spot by looking at their
bidder lists.

I guess the &quot;rule,&quot; if there is one, for sheet music prices is the
scarcer the piece, the more collectible the composer, the better the
tune and the better the art, the better the money. All it takes is two
collectors who want a piece to drive the price way up. Recently a copy
of Joplin's &quot;Lily Queen&quot; sold for more than $1000 on eBay. Just after
that, another one showed up and was sold privately for about that
amount.

I really get a laugh (or sometimes become very sad) when I look through
piles of sheet music at antiques shops. I know that dealers in furniture
or glassware usually wind up with the contents of piano benches as part
of a lot and they have paid virtually nothing for it. They don't really
want it because they don't know the market. Yet, they look upon this
stuff as having only art value, marking up really common stuff with good
art WAY out of the ballpark, generally 10 to 50 TIMES the fair market
value. The really scarce stuff is way below collector's value. It's
laughable. Sometimes they put it in a pile with a sign - &quot;RARE OLD SHEET
MUSIC - $20 EACH.&quot; Nobody in their right mind would pay $20 for a copy
of &quot;Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight&quot; or &quot;Joan of Arc They Are Calling
You.&quot; I can't tell you how many sheets I've walked away from because
they were outrageously overpriced. It's a waste of my time to even look
at it and theirs to bag and tag it. Then the dealers say they don't like
to deal in sheet music because it doesn't move. Well, then, price it to
move! You'll wind up giving some valuable stuff away, but you will often
get a few bucks more for the common stuff - unless you have an extreme
rarity, it will all balance out. Before you know it, you'll have a good
reputation with the collectors and they will visit your shop. You can
then learn from them about what's valuable and what's not.

Perhaps I should post an &quot;unofficial guide&quot; to sheet music. Is there
anyone here who is interested? I don't want to go through all that
effort if no one cares...

RAGards,

Tracy

There's a large pile of sheet music in the shop I'm in. We sell music
quite steadily -- at $3.00 each (or 10 for $25.) I'd really like to
read your &quot;Unofficial Guide&quot; if it's not too much trouble. We get
about as many people buying for the music as for the covers. I know
that there are a few cover artists that people look for (can't
remember off hand, but if you told me the names it'd ring a bell.)

Thanks for the great information Tracy! Yes, I'd like to learn a little
bit more too... always willing to learn a new subject! Recently I had a
stack of postcards to sell and I didn't know which were good for the
stamps (mostly 1906-1912), and which for postcards. eBay has a Stamp
board, so off I went, dumb questions in hand. I learned a lot from them,
picked up a good book on stamps, and actually did quite well on my
stamps and postcard listings. So now I've a smidgen of knowledge about
postcards and stamps, and would love to learn about more paper stuff!

So bring the info on!

Have fun, Michele

You know, I have thought on occasion to ask you about those piles of
sheet music I bought (remember when we talked about it -- the day I
berated myself for passing up that wonderful old buggy at the same
sale?) But I figured it would be a lot to ask. I'd LOVE to have some
guidance.

Definitely interested...what is correct way to store? I have a fair amount of
sheet music from 1920-40's primarily of sentimental value (and being a pack-rat
it kills me to throw anything out) but I would to know how to prevent further
damage. Would also like a greater appreciation of what I have

Hi, wj...

You would be talking about standard (or &quot;small&quot;) format music, not large
format (10.5&quot; x 14&quot;) as was common until 1917. There are several
companies manufacturing plastic poly bags which suit this purpose just
fine. For your music which is what... 9&quot; x 12&quot;, get bags which are about
10&quot; x 14&quot;. You can find them on eBay or do an online search for
&quot;archival supplies&quot; for commercial vendors. I would recommend putting in
a stiffener, usually a die-cut cardboard piece slightly larger than the
sheet music, but make sure it is acid-free or it will yellow the music.

The best position to put them in is to lay them flat in a stack.
Pressure won't hurt them, but if you stand them on end they will
invariably bend.

If you really want to get crazy, you can order some very nice clear
mylar envelopes and darned if I can remember what they're called... They
are glossy and stiff, two sides have stiff flaps which overlap. They're
wonderful because not only do they preserve the music and stiffen, but
the rich gloss makes even lousy sheet music look beautiful. But they are
very expensive.

Sometime in the distant past I posted a bunch of links to archival
suppliers on the net and darned if I can find it now. Perhaps a search
of Deja.com for my posts concerning preservation or archival materials
will reveal it.

Hope this helps!

BTW, it is going to be a few days before I'll have a chance to write my
sheet music guide...

RAGards,

Tracy

&gt; Definitely interested...what is correct way to store? I have a fair amount of
&gt; sheet music from 1920-40's primarily of sentimental value (and being a pack-rat
&gt; it kills me to throw anything out) but I would to know how to prevent further
&gt; damage. Would also like a greater appreciation of what I have

&gt;&gt; Perhaps I should post an &quot;unofficial guide&quot; to sheet music. Is there
&gt;&gt; anyone here who is interested? I don't want to go through all that
&gt;&gt; effort if no one cares...
