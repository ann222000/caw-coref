I have been lurking around for a while and have noticed that there are some
things the people in this group and others love to argue about.

!. declawing
2. inside vs. outside
3. wet food vs dry food

Can you agree to disagree and get on with it instead of being afraid to let
someone have the last word?
Why can't everyone put their .02 or .03 cents worth in and just get over it
without having to argue? I believe in letting everyone have their say, and
if I'm attacked, I will attack back, but I don't usually attack first. and
stating an opinion is not considered attacking, but you don't have to be so
ugly to each other. That's my .01 cents worth. I'm saving the other .01
for later.

I've been subcribing to this ng for about 2½ years, &amp; believe me, it just
goes on &amp; on. And currently this is *nothing* compared to what I've seen at
times in the past. The food issue is the least volatile of the 3, though,
IMO (w/ the exception of the newest poster in that regard).

It is all a matter of putting what is more convenient for you above your cat
in alot of these cases. It is convient for us to put our needs above those
of our pet. Humans act is if the world is theirs and their alone and that
pets are our subservient little slaves. The stuff alot of you do to your
cats is cruel and if done to a human would be a human rights violation.
Why do you think cats would like it? Humans do not like having their digits
cut off or being locked inside. Well guess what neither would a cat. Yes
they are *gasp* like us.

It is convient for us to declaw our cats but it hurts them a fucking lot. I
am sure if a human was declawed it would be easy for those assholes who
declaw their cats to point out why declawing a human is wrong. Why the
hell can these people not make the same distinction with a cat? Cats are
not some magical creatures that feel no pain. I think if we take five
people who have declawed cats as an example and stick them in the room with
a tiger and have them try to declaw the tiger that would deter other
potential declawers if we made that the punishment for declawing.

It is convient for us to lock our cats in but I doubt they like it. No
human likes to be inside all day. Why the fucking hell can people not make
the same distinction with cats?

Dry vs wet food is just stupid.

"/> Pets are not our slaves. However, in the case of cats what everyone tends to
conveniently overlook is that humans domesticated the cat. Humans developed
breeds that were never meant to be in the outdoors as well as making their
habitat in some areas where they don't even have their own part in the
ecology. Hence, it is up to humans to be responsible for domesticated cats.
Unless you would like to just go out and start exterminating, it *is* up to
humans to provide for the cats in our lives. Many of the outdoor only
fanatics claim then just don't have cats, but it is not that simple, many of
those same proponents let their cats propagate with no regard to population.
That alone adds to the need to have owners. If everything were simple and
straight forward there would be no need to debate, but that isn't the case.

Louie is my rider cat. He goes for daily rides in the basket on my

REALLY wants to go outside) is because he loves riding so much, even
in cars, that he gets into peoples cars if they've left their windows
down, hoping to go cruising. He went to work with my neighbor one
morning in her Chevy Suburban. Thank goodness she recognized who the

No one said you couldn't or shouldn't discuss, or stand up for what you
believe is right. Just be nice about it and quit being so nasty because
they don't agree with your way of seeing things. There's always two sides
to each story. I feel quite strongly on not declawing and have definite
ideas of inside/outside cats, but name calling , please you should have
stopped doing that in grade school. If you disagree with someone's ideas
the name calling is not going to help you see the issue as they see it or
help them see the issue as you see it. It's only going to make them ignore
you most of the time. I believe each one of us had someone in our life who
warned us about our reputation didn't they... oh well, it's __________
again and this could be the time you might have excellent information
that could sway someone to seeing things your way. But they're not going to
know that are they, because they're going to get p'd at you over your
attitude and ignore the rest.

The first thing the next morning I got up and went to the ng and read it
again. I sat here with tears streaming down my face. It has been over 14
years since Ugly passed away and I can still hear those pitiful cries he
made when I found him, the same ones in the car on the way to the vet. I

people that if they can't afford a pedigree they need to think carefully
about if they can afford *any* cat, as it's very easy to spend £200 at
the vets on things such as cancers, which indoor and indoor/outdoor cats
can all get. It's much easier to find £200 when it's planned for than
when it's not.

"/> It's not reasonable to expect a sick kitten to survive in the wild - it
wouldn't even if born to generations of feral cats. However the changes
to most pedigree breeds are not major compared with the originals - a
fancy pattern here, a long nose there. Everything in pedigree cats
started in non-pedigrees. What indoor cats are lacking is not instinct,
but experience. Feral kittens stay with their mothers for quite a
period of time, and are taught to hunt (and scavenge) and what the
hazards are by their mothers. Cats are very good at learning by
imitation.

The 'instinct bred out' argument has been used to justify battery hens.
However plenty of people in the UK have brought 'old' battery hens for
the outdoor life, and once they've got over the dramatic change in
circumstance they have all the instincts to scratch, dust bathe and so
on of any other hen.

Our pampered pets similarly (IMHO) have all the instincts of wild cats,
but not the experience.

to all of the shelters. Finally on the sixth day, my husband spotted
him on the back fence, headed for the house. He was dirty, muddy,
skinny, his little feet were really sore, and he was so exhausted,
that he slept for nearly two days, only waking up to eat, drink, and
use the litter box. I'm sure he had gotten into some ones car, and
went for quite a ways away from our house, before he was able to get
out, or was maybe discovered and tossed out. If only they could talk
eh?

At any rate, it's a chance I just won't take again with Louie.

never forget it, my brother was working on his car and I was watching Hans

couldn't believe it (we had usually 5 to 7 cats so its only now thinking
back I realize that I actually recognized it RIGHT away). There she was on
the step, skinny, skinny, skinny. Talking to me like there was no tomorrow.
Right away I went to feed her and give her water and she talked the whole

figure she must have either gotten into someones car or stuck in someones
basement. Luckily it wasn't winter. Man was I happy!

I agree. My entrie premise on this subject is it is a personal choice up to
the cat's owner/momma/daddy whatever we call outselves. If you, or
Wazu-moron, or anyone else want to let their cats outside I think it's fine
(as long as they weigh the risks, which I am sure they would) I have never
told anyone *not* to let their cats out. I, however, will continue to keep my
cat indoors.

As for the '4 year old kid' analogy. Please read it in the context of Wazu's
post. He first equated the analogy of keeping a cat indoors with keeping a
human indoors. I was simply making light of his analogy.

thanks,
Joshua

&gt; It is convient for us to lock our cats in but I doubt they like it. No

make
&gt; the same distinction with cats?

"/> While you are intitled to your own opinion, I can't agree with you regarding
this issue.
I work in a vet clinic (for the SPCA) and I see countless lost and/or
injured cats come in every
year. Some are so badly injured (by cars, other animals, and even humans)
that they have to
be euthanised immediately to end their suffering.

Some sit in cages day after day waiting for their owners to come. The lucky
ones get reunited
with their owners.. some only to be allowed outside again to this time be
killed.

In the country where there is no traffic, or neighbours are few and far
between, I am all for cats
being outside. But I live in the city where traffic is a nightmare, coyotes
are running rampant
and cats and dogs are getting killed everyday because their owners think
it's better for them to be able to run free.

I have two cats that are 1 1/2 and 3 1/2 years old. They are healthy, happy
and content to be indoor cats.
The older cat has escaped once or twice only to find herself terrified to be
outdoors. They have each other
for exercise, each other and my husband and I for interaction and affection
and their sweet attitudes.

Face it.. the day of cats being outside is coming to the end. Unless your
cat is smart enough to stay in the backyard
(and even THIS will not prevent death by other animals) there is NO safe
place for your cats but inside.

&gt; There is such thing as being overprotective you know.

make

&gt; overprotect cats they will evovle to be pathetic creatures completely
&gt; dependent on humans for their every need. I do not want to see that
happen.
&gt; Look at dogs for an example of this.

"/> Sorry buddy.. Humans domesticated cats thousands of years ago. If you didn't
want a domestic animal then why did you get one? While some cats may be
smart
enough to stay off the road, that doesn't mean that they are safe from
predators (human
and animal) or that one day they are not going to get spooked by something
and run into
traffic. Then there are countless other concerns such as viruses, minor
wounds from fights
turning into abscesses, etc. etc.

As for your crack aobut overprotecting human children.. if you are willing
to let a 4 year
old child out into the world without protection then God forbid you ever be
allowed to have kids.
The world is changing. It's overpopulating, crowding in. The only safe place
for kids and pets are
where they can be supervised by those who care for them. If that means a cat
only goes out
on a leash, or into a protected environment where it is safe from danger,
then as pet owners it is our
responsibility to see to it.

"/> Out into the world. Mmmm. A 4 year old child. Well outside yes, no
child (or cat) should be kept in all the time. Beyond that, you allow
your child to grow, to experience new things. By 5 or 6 a walk to the
local shop on his/her own maybe. 7/8 and the longer walk to school.
9/10 a trip into town on their own - all of course depending on the
child, so will do things faster than others (or slower).

And it is the same with cats, except that this growing up is condensed
into a year or two.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The world is changing. It's overpopulating, crowding in. The only safe place

&gt;where it is safe from danger, then as pet owners it is our responsibility to
&gt;see to it.

&gt;While you are intitled to your own opinion, I can't agree with you regarding
&gt;this issue.
&gt;I work in a vet clinic (for the SPCA) and I see countless lost and/or
&gt;injured cats come in every
&gt;year. Some are so badly injured (by cars, other animals, and even humans)
&gt;that they have to
&gt;be euthanised immediately to end their suffering.

"/> But what is that as a percentage of the population of cats - very
small. If you worked in an Accident &amp; Emergency unit and saw the
number of people coming in with sporting injuries would you want to
ban all sports?

In Britain we have cats killed on the road, not a high percentage but
it is there. But that would not stop us letting cats out because we
evaluate the risk and believe the quality of life of the cat outweighs
some risks.

If the dangers become too bad we stop having cats because we do not
consider cats to be indoor only animals - every bit of expert opinion
tells us that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Some sit in cages day after day waiting for their owners to come. The lucky

&gt;being outside. But I live in the city where traffic is a nightmare, coyotes

"/> LOL, Susan! Our Misha (1988-99) did always enjoy exploring the &quot;outdoors&quot; --
as long as it was within our screened-in enclosure, that is.

Occasionally, my [human] daughters insisted on taking him out to the &quot;REAL
outside world.&quot; (We lived on a quiet cul-de-sac; no traffic, no dogs, no
other children running around at the time.) They'd carry him way out into
the yard, and as soon as they set him down, he'd do an immediate beeline (as
in Monopoly: DIRECT -- DO NOT STOP AT &quot;GO&quot;), right back to the house!!!

Once inside, he'd look at his feet in sheer disgust, almost as if to say,
&quot;Sheesh, now look at what I have to put up with! I'm faced with this
gigantic project of removing all evidence of contact with earth and grass -
yuck!&quot; He would spend the next hour obligatorily grooming away all traces of
his 60-second excursion.

[By the way, Misha was this way since day-one. He was always a &quot;home-body,&quot;
much preferring to be the master of his domain, and definitely wanting to
keep all of us in sight: even if he did sometimes have to make the
cumbersome &quot;rounds&quot; from room to room for &quot;spot-checks&quot; on all of us!]

My two kitties now, Katya and Sergei, also show no &quot;roaming&quot; interests.
Maybe it's because I, myself, am pretty much a &quot;home-body,&quot; preferring the
coziness of my cottage to that of being a gad-fly around town . . .

I agree with you. My two cats are kept indoors. But they are used to.
Sometimes, I leave the door opened and they don't try to get out. Simply,
they are not used to and I sincerely think they feel happy anyway.

Sometimes, during the summer time, when it's to hot inside, I bring them out
and after a few minutes, they stay in front of the door asking to get in.

Before taking the decision to let them inside or outside, I ask my vet for
her opinion. She told me as long as a cat is used to stay inside when he is
young, it's OK.

But if I would adopt one who was trained to get out I would never change his
habits. It would be cruel....

I also travel a lot with my cats (every two weeks) and they are used
to......!!!

They are really my two best friends.......

To train them, I put my cat on my knees and I do a fence with my arms around
the cat without touching him (just to show him that he is not allowed to go
everywhere in the car). It lasts about ten minutes and the cat knows he can
lie on my knee but don't never go anywhere. And they purr......!!!! This
way, this is secure, and the cat stays lying or sitting and they see
everywhere....!!!!

But since I have two cats, I have trained the second the same way and it
always works. But, or I have both on my knees for a while (25 pounds) or I
put them in a cat carrier because for 3 or 5 hours driving it is
heavy.....!!!!!

This is all speculation on my part.... I've been giving the jelly from canned foods to my cats for the past 12 years.... Only one of six is overweight..... and one of them eats the jelly &amp; licks up any

Ciboulette, a male, my older cat (15-yrs-old) is a white domestic cat.
Very special, like to be dressed as a doll.....!!!!!! Probably because he
likes to have attention. When we celebrate Halloween, I dress the cat and
he purrs all the time he is dressed. It last from years and years. People
come from towns around especially to see Ciboulette. He never try to take
it off. Nothing attached, so he could take it off easily, but
never.....!!!!! So funny.....!!!!

&gt;&gt; I'm enjoying your posts. Can you tell us about your cats? Their names and
&gt;&gt; ages?

&gt;&gt; Karen

&gt; Hi Karen,

&gt; Sure.....!

&gt; Ciboulette, a male, my older cat (15-yrs-old) is a white domestic cat.
&gt; Very special, like to be dressed as a doll.....!!!!!! Probably because he
&gt; likes to have attention. When we celebrate Halloween, I dress the cat and
&gt; he purrs all the time he is dressed. It last from years and years. People
&gt; come from towns around especially to see Ciboulette. He never try to take
&gt; it off. Nothing attached, so he could take it off easily, but
&gt; never.....!!!!! So funny.....!!!!

&gt; Gucci, a male, blue somali, Supreme Champion, ( 5-yrs-old). Completely the
&gt; opposite. Particulary athelete, plays all day long. This one wouldn't be
&gt; dressed not even a minute....!!!
&gt; ...a good hockey player.......!!!!! Sniky...!

&gt;&gt; Hi Joshua,
&gt;&gt; Everyone lives in different circumstances and has to decide what is
right

&gt; No, you learn what is right for a cat and then see if you can provide
&gt; the right type of home for one. Big difference.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;I live in the suburbs and have a garden so I've always let my cats out
when
&gt;&gt;they want to , but not at night.

"/> Yeah ..... but despite their reputation as being nocturnal animals, my cats
seem to prefer to spend their nights snoozing on our bed..... although the

is considerate enough to leave me rats heads in the passage, lizards tails
in the hall and live baby snakes in the kitchen.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;Most people in the Uk let their cats out . My friends have built an
outside
&gt;&gt;contained play area for their cats so they can get fresh air and have
some
&gt;&gt;fun . For cats who are languishing in rescue centres I think they would
just
&gt;&gt;like a home whether they can go out or not.

&gt; Would they? I wonder. Or would they say &quot;hang on, I'll wait for the
&gt; next offer&quot;.

"/> S'pose you'd soon find out. We have one cat who spent months in the local
boarding kennels after having been dumped by her owners. She sorta came to
stay here on a temporary basis two years ago, despite hating all other cats
and although she lives in another wing of the house, the windows are always
open but she seems to prefer staying inside (preferably on my desk or
computer keyboard). She's as affectionate as all heck when any visitors
arrive, but whenever she has been faced with the prospect of a &quot;next offer&quot;
(when we tried to rehome her - thinking she'd be better as a single,
pampered puss), she has always taken an instant dislike to the person
concerned.

&gt;On 1/17/01 Susan shared:

&gt;&lt;snipped for brevity&gt;

&gt;&gt; My older cat tries to get out once in a blue moon, but once she's out she gets
&gt;&gt; a look on her face like &quot;WHAT THE HECK AM I DOING HERE??&quot; and runs right back
&gt;&gt; inside.

&gt;&gt; Susan

&gt;LOL, Susan! Our Misha (1988-99) did always enjoy exploring the &quot;outdoors&quot; --
&gt;as long as it was within our screened-in enclosure, that is.

&gt;Occasionally, my [human] daughters insisted on taking him out to the &quot;REAL
&gt;outside world.&quot; (We lived on a quiet cul-de-sac; no traffic, no dogs, no
&gt;other children running around at the time.) They'd carry him way out into
&gt;the yard, and as soon as they set him down, he'd do an immediate beeline (as
&gt;in Monopoly: DIRECT -- DO NOT STOP AT &quot;GO&quot;), right back to the house!!!

&gt;Once inside, he'd look at his feet in sheer disgust, almost as if to say,
&gt;&quot;Sheesh, now look at what I have to put up with! I'm faced with this
&gt;gigantic project of removing all evidence of contact with earth and grass -
&gt;yuck!&quot; He would spend the next hour obligatorily grooming away all traces of
&gt;his 60-second excursion.

&gt;[By the way, Misha was this way since day-one. He was always a &quot;home-body,&quot;
&gt;much preferring to be the master of his domain, and definitely wanting to
&gt;keep all of us in sight: even if he did sometimes have to make the
&gt;cumbersome &quot;rounds&quot; from room to room for &quot;spot-checks&quot; on all of us!]

&gt;My two kitties now, Katya and Sergei, also show no &quot;roaming&quot; interests.
&gt;Maybe it's because I, myself, am pretty much a &quot;home-body,&quot; preferring the
&gt;coziness of my cottage to that of being a gad-fly around town . . .

"/> I know several cats like that. Pick them up and take them anywhere and
it is a case of &quot;Not on your life bud, I go where I want to go.&quot; I've
often thought that is you want to put a cat in one place then it is
better to put it as far away from there as possible - it will go where
you really want then just to be awkward :)

In other words. Let the cat walk out onto the grass itself. Don't, as
Gerry puts it, &quot;thrust&quot; the poor mog out, just let it find its own way
out.

I loved the story about your 'Halloween Cat'. But then, I LOVE

a black cat, and my daughter was a witch. While out
trick-or-treating, a big dog started barking at us, which caused all
of my hair to stand up, and my claws to come unsheathed. In all of
the excitement, I wasn't paying attention to where I was walking, and
I stepped in a big pile of dog doo-doo. Yuck!!! I checked my tail,
and thank goodness, I hadn't dragged it through the offensive matter,
so all was good, and we continued on. Got lots of candy and had a
blast. Of course, right before we got back to our house, I had to
remove my 'ears' because my sweet faced little Darla cat for some
reason is absolutely terrified of me when I wear them.

Firstly.. I want to apologize to one and all if my last post got a little
preachy or heated.
It's not my place to tell people what to think or do with their cats. If you
live in a safe
neighborhood where your cats can wander outside, then good for you! I only
wish I had the same option. My cats stay inside not because I &quot;imprison&quot;
them, but
because I love them, and want to keep them safe. Where I live there are too
many
factors that could lead to harm or death to my cats, and I don't want to
take that risk.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Out into the world. Mmmm. A 4 year old child. Well outside yes, no
&gt; child (or cat) should be kept in all the time. Beyond that, you allow
&gt; your child to grow, to experience new things. By 5 or 6 a walk to the
&gt; local shop on his/her own maybe. 7/8 and the longer walk to school.
&gt; 9/10 a trip into town on their own - all of course depending on the
&gt; child, so will do things faster than others (or slower).
&gt; And it is the same with cats, except that this growing up is condensed
&gt; into a year or two.

"/> I would like the world to be a safe place where my 5 or 6 year old could
walk
to the store by herself, but in Canada that is not possible. Although the
streets are fairly
safe the newspaper abounds with stories of child rapists, kidnappers, etc. I
could never forgive
myself if something happened to my child because I was not careful. When I
do have children they
will be allowed out with groups of friends, but only with adult supervision
until they are old enough to
truly understand about being safe.

If my cats could hang out in groups, know better to stay off the roads or
away from strangers, I would do
the same.

My cats are healthy, happy and affectionate. They are playful and friendly
to people who come in to
visit me. They do not suffer from being strictly indoors. They are in no
danger of animal attacks, being hit
by cars or getting lost. Therefore they stay inside.

&gt; I agree with you. My two cats are kept indoors. But they are used to.
&gt; Sometimes, I leave the door opened and they don't try to get out. Simply,
&gt; they are not used to and I sincerely think they feel happy anyway.
&gt; Sometimes, during the summer time, when it's to hot inside, I bring them
out
&gt; and after a few minutes, they stay in front of the door asking to get in.
&gt; Before taking the decision to let them inside or outside, I ask my vet for
&gt; her opinion. She told me as long as a cat is used to stay inside when he
is
&gt; young, it's OK.
&gt; But if I would adopt one who was trained to get out I would never change
his
&gt; habits. It would be cruel....
&gt; I also travel a lot with my cats (every two weeks) and they are used
&gt; to......!!!
&gt; They are really my two best friends.......
&gt; That was my opinion but I respect yours.

"/> Well said. Maybe in different parts of the world, in different cities or
towns, traffic is less, there are less
wild animals in urban areas, or more well behaved pets who are allowed
outdoors. Unfortunately this
does not hold true for where I live. Also, since I work at vet clinic/animal
shelter I see horrifically injured
cats and dogs everyday, who were allowed out to roam at will. I am NOT
saying ALL dogs and cats who are
allowed outside meet this end. Some pets are clever enough to stick close to
home, and know how to
avoid danger. Unfortunately not ALL pets are like this, and I do not want to
risk finding out if my cats are
or not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; LOL, Susan! Our Misha (1988-99) did always enjoy exploring the
&quot;outdoors&quot; --
&gt; as long as it was within our screened-in enclosure, that is.
&gt; Occasionally, my [human] daughters insisted on taking him out to the &quot;REAL
&gt; outside world.&quot; (We lived on a quiet cul-de-sac; no traffic, no dogs, no
&gt; other children running around at the time.) They'd carry him way out into
&gt; the yard, and as soon as they set him down, he'd do an immediate beeline
(as
&gt; in Monopoly: DIRECT -- DO NOT STOP AT &quot;GO&quot;), right back to the house!!!
&gt; Once inside, he'd look at his feet in sheer disgust, almost as if to say,
&gt;&quot;Sheesh, now look at what I have to put up with! I'm faced with this
&gt; gigantic project of removing all evidence of contact with earth and
grass -
&gt; yuck!&quot; He would spend the next hour obligatorily grooming away all traces
of
&gt; his 60-second excursion.
&gt; [By the way, Misha was this way since day-one. He was always a
&quot;home-body,&quot;
&gt; much preferring to be the master of his domain, and definitely wanting to
&gt; keep all of us in sight: even if he did sometimes have to make the
&gt; cumbersome &quot;rounds&quot; from room to room for &quot;spot-checks&quot; on all of us!]

"/> Grin. Sounds like your Misha was an original! :) I know Ally was an outdoor
cat before
I got her, but the whole reason I got her was the she wound up at the SPCA
as a stray. She
had recently had a litter of kittens and was still lactating. She was
scared, lost and no one came
to claim her. I adopted her and have kept her inside since September of 98.
She shows NO
signs of being discontented with her life. She is a healthy, if slightly
plump kitty who is now happy
to be an indoor cat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My two kitties now, Katya and Sergei, also show no &quot;roaming&quot; interests.

"/> (Please tell me they were named after the famous ice skaters!!!!)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Maybe it's because I, myself, am pretty much a &quot;home-body,&quot; preferring the
&gt; coziness of my cottage to that of being a gad-fly around town . . .

"/> I think Ally does a little better indoors since we brought Cobee home to
keep her company, but
she seemed pretty happy (aside from the very occasional bout of curiousity
to get outside). I don't think
Cobee has EVER been outside. We got him when he was 4 1/2 months old, and
although he really enjoys
looking out the window, he has never tried to get out the door.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But what is that as a percentage of the population of cats - very
&gt; small. If you worked in an Accident &amp; Emergency unit and saw the
&gt; number of people coming in with sporting injuries would you want to
&gt; ban all sports?
&gt; In Britain we have cats killed on the road, not a high percentage but
&gt; it is there. But that would not stop us letting cats out because we
&gt; evaluate the risk and believe the quality of life of the cat outweighs
&gt; some risks.
&gt; If the dangers become too bad we stop having cats because we do not
&gt; consider cats to be indoor only animals - every bit of expert opinion
&gt; tells us that.

"/> I can't agree there. I know many clients and friends who keep their cat(s)
indoors.
Most of them report that their cats are healthy, happy and content. I think
one cat
killed is one cat too many. I am NOT saying that EVERYONE has to keep their
cats inside, but if you live in a busy city or suburb with lots of traffic
and sightings
of wild animals then it makes sense to keep your cats inside and safe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I too live in a city, and have lived in the centre of London, we still
&gt; let our cats out. We have foxes, dogs, humans, cars - but we still
&gt; feel that although our cats can never be 100% safe

"/> And that is your perogative. My perogative is to weigh what can happen to my
cats
outside against safety inside. If my cats were miserable and always trying
to get out, pining
away to be outside then I would also consider it.. but they are happy and
healthy inside.
Why should I change that?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But not as content and happy as they would be if they were able to go
&gt; out part of the time.

"/> How do you know that? Just because some cats enjoy being outside does not
mean
ALL do.. I have talked to people who gave their cats a chance to be outside
and the cats
preferred indoors. I even tried taking my cat on a leash outside a few times
2 years ago. She
hated being outside, and was much happier once she was back indoors.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Its like humans and water, we have to learn to swim, until we do we
&gt; are not happy in water.

"/> Yes, but if the water were also infested by sharks and people driving huge
boats going extremely fast
who would WANT to go in the water?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Not enough. How would you like to live in a tiny world with just a
&gt; handful of people to relate to.

"/> How can you know what my cats or anyone else's cats would like?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the wild a cat would have 20 to 50 colony members to relate to.
&gt; Your cats need to go out to have this social interaction with other cats.

"/> Funny.. my cats sure seem to be healthy, happy and content. Friends and
clients of my work
who have 1 or 2 cats who are indoors don't seem to have problems with their
cats.. yet I know some
people who have many cats or who allow their cats outdoors and find their
cats fighting or wounded
from cat fights..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That is untrue. No place, even indoors, is 100% safe. But if you feel
&gt; your area is too unsafe. Don't keep cats.

"/> My OUTDOOR environment is not safe. My indoor environment is a lot safer.
You should not
tell people they should not keep cats unless they are allowed outdoors. That
is wrong and unfair.
What makes you the expert on cat psychology? We all think we know what's
best for our own cats,
and maybe we do, but that does not give us the right to tell everyone else
what they should do.

I don't know who wrote this passage or where they heck they live but this is
not reality. It was reality when I was growing up but it just is not reality
anymore. I do have a shop down the street but there is no way in hell I
would let my son go there alone at 5 or 6 years of age. The school is also
right down the road and I would drive him every damn day. I would not let my
child go to town by himself at 9 or 10, I would honestly never see him
again. If someone did not get him, I am sure CPS would be called and they
would.

It does not depend on the child. It does depend on where we live and even
more important the time we are living in. It just is not safe anymore for
anyone, let alone a child.

So to come full circle this also applies to my cats. People run them over,
dogs/coyotes/wolves attack them. People kill, abuse, torture and maim cats.
It is the times we live in and the area(traffic wise) I live in that means I
keep as many of my cats indoors as possible at all times. Most are feral as
I work in rescue and there is not much I can do there but keep trying to get
them inside.

Interestingly, S. Sylvestris which are believed to be our domesticated cat's
ancestors were normally solitary like nearly all other species of cats.
Luckily, domestic cats do make friends with each other when placed into
unnaturally high-density situations (like outdoors in the UK). It just goes
to show how adaptable cats can be when placed under unnatural and stressful
situations such as outdoors in the UK and how social tendancies can be
developed in order to reduce repeated territorial confrontations.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Out into the world. Mmmm. A 4 year old child. Well outside yes, no
&gt;&gt;&gt; child (or cat) should be kept in all the time. Beyond that, you allow
&gt;&gt;&gt; your child to grow, to experience new things. By 5 or 6 a walk to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; local shop on his/her own maybe. 7/8 and the longer walk to school.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 9/10 a trip into town on their own - all of course depending on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; child, so will do things faster than others (or slower).
&gt;&gt;&gt; And it is the same with cats, except that this growing up is condensed
&gt;&gt;&gt; into a year or two.

&gt;&gt; I don't know who wrote this passage or where they heck they live but this is

&gt;&gt; would let my son go there alone at 5 or 6 years of age.

&gt; Our local shops are about 300 yards away, my 6 year old goes there
&gt; quite often and has done since last summer. There are no roads to
&gt; cross, but since we moved here it has been nice for her to go and get
&gt; her own sweets or something for her mum.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; The school is also
&gt;&gt; right down the road and I would drive him every damn day. I would not let my
&gt;&gt; child go to town by himself at 9 or 10, I would honestly never see him
&gt;&gt; again. If someone did not get him, I am sure CPS would be called and they
&gt;&gt; would.

&gt;&gt; It does not depend on the child.

&gt; Of course it does.

&gt;&gt; So to come full circle this also applies to my cats. People run them over,
&gt;&gt; dogs/coyotes/wolves attack them. People kill, abuse, torture and maim cats.
&gt;&gt; It is the times we live in and the area(traffic wise) I live in that means I
&gt;&gt; keep as many of my cats indoors as possible at all times. Most are feral as
&gt;&gt; I work in rescue and there is not much I can do there but keep trying to get

&gt;&gt;&gt; You should not

&gt;&gt; That

&gt;&gt;&gt; What makes you the expert on cat psychology? We all think we know what's

&gt; paths? And their cats and sparrows *don't* get along with each other?

&gt; You're seriously interrupting my idyllic vision here ;-)

&gt; Gerry

"/> Sorry Gerry, but that ideal only lives on in re-runs of 1940's Hollywood
movies. At the risk of repeating myself here's a copy of a message that I
posted on the 'We found Tigger' thread (rope?). It was sent to a cat club by
a 15 year old girl from Rotherham in the north of England:

*** Her name is Tizer, the tiniest female cat you ever saw; and she's bright
orange - female gingers are very rare.
It was about two years ago when we found her, all moth-eaten and wounded.
We were about to buy this lovely detached house in the country with climbing
roses. I was checking out the garden when I saw an old door right at the
bottom, lying propped on a brick and seemed to be quivering gently.
I ran down to have a closer look and there she was with her squirming body
rubbing against the tiny carcasses of her long dead kittens, as if somehow
trying to bring thm back to life. Not only did this display of motherly
tenderness fill my heart with love for this little cat but it made me wonder
because I did not know that cats had the capacity to grieve. The poor little
thing had blood pouring from her mouth and her bright red coat was barely
visible under all the grime.
She was so weak and in pain hat she hardly noticed when I gently picked her
up and carried her inside. As I walked down the path a lady from across the
street shouted at me &quot;What are you doing with that ugly thing? Full of
vermin it is. I've put down me rat poison under that old door where it
sleeps in old Mrs Kinsey's garden, might kill of those kittens too. Full of
diseases they are.&quot; And then someone else from further down the street,
putting her children into the car threatened, &quot;Keep that old thing away from
my kids.&quot;
I told my family that we couldn't move into this house at all costs and we
went away taking the wounded cat with us.
At the vet's they said that they would keep her under intensive care but
that it was unlikely that she'd make it through the night because the rat
poison was too far into her system.
Against all odds she pulled through and after a week we took her home.
But from then on it wasn't all perfect. It took a lot of time and hard work
to get her to trust us. I can still remember that gorgeous day when I was
reading in the study and she jumped on my lap and started to suckle on my
sweater. She just lay on her tummy sucking and purring frantically, and I
really felt as though I had achieved something.
We named her Tizer after the fizzy drink because she has a red coat and has
a bubbly temperament. Now she's the most loving pet you could ever have. She
doesn't mind at all when my little sister pulls er tail or picks her up by
her back legs.
I have since discovered that the suckling is a sign of being removed at an
early age from their mother and they suckle as a kind of attempt toget back
their long lost childhood. Cats who do this cannot be discouraged from the
habit, because it is an inbuilt instinct.
I believe that my cat is one of the luckiest cats alive and I often think
that she knows it too; there are times when she looks to me exactly like
she's saying &quot;Thanks&quot;! ***

If this sort of thing goes on in an 'idyllic' village what hope is there for
any cat 'enjoying' the freedom to roam?

Luv and purrs
Phil and Collie ,,,^.&quot;.^,,,

Karen,
Hundreds and hundreds of people all over the Britain keep cats and let them
out. They don't all end up posioned or run over or eaten by foxes. They
live very happy long lives. I've had cats that lived to 16, 17, and 19. They
enjoyed their lives. They had the choice of staying in or out. Bob and some
of the posters from the UK made valid points which you ignored and mocked
because you don't agree with.

&gt; live very happy long lives. I've had cats that lived to 16, 17, and 19. They

&gt; Alison

"/> I believe you. You take a reasonable approach to that. I mock
Bob/Frank/Adrian because they sweeping statements and attribute complete cat
happiness to *one* factor. They won't go *past* that one factor. I agree
that England has far better animal protection laws than here, but I also
think that there are different situations that mean keeping cats indoors.
They simply stick to a cat, is a cat, is a cat. They speak with
condescension toward anyone who does not adhere to that. It deserves to be
mocked. It is really as though they consider their lifestyles the be all and
end all and no one deserves companionship. I asked Frank outright, you mean
you'd rather see cats out on the street than in an apartment with plenty of
love, care and attention. He gave a resounding 100% yes to that. Don't you
think that is a little overboard? I believe there are room for all ways of
having a cat, depending on your area. They simply call me cruel for that
belief. I've pointed out, that when I am in the right position I do let my
cats out as well, with supervision. They scoff at me.

Maybe this is a good place to elaborate on what I mean be supervision. I
grew up with indoor/outdoor cats. We got our first one when I was five (she
chose us) and it snowballed from there. We had a neighbor that if he even
saw a cat walking across his yard, who would call the pound. One of our
beauties got shot in the face with a bebe gun (got her patched up, but it
was nasty) and she also disappeared for three weeks one time and came back
skinny and tired but unharmed. So we changed our ways. We had seven cats. We
made sure we knew when they went out, and when they came in. They 'had' to
be in by dark. We always let them out the back door into the fenced yard and
if we weren't out there, we checked on them occasionally or checked out the
window. If one started heading out of the yard you called them back and got
them interested in something in the yard. you didn't have to be there ALL
the time and they pretty much learned not to roam. If we were going
somewhere, you fetched them all in. In the winter, they didn't care to go
out much or for long anyway. Some of these cats were strays we took in, some
were born to the house. We accounted for our cats. Is this an unreasonable
attitude to take to caring for a cat?

My two cats now have always been indoors. They act the same way any of the
cats I had growing up, who had daily access to the outside acted. Yet Bob
etc. say my cats are not cats. That I cannot see they are happy, etc. They
deride my cats life, but it is OK? They admit they have never known
personally indoor only cats while I have had a LOT of cats and they have all
behaved in the same manner whether indoor or indoor/outdoor. I really think
that I have a better grasp on reality than they do, but its OK for them to
mock my beliefs?

If you think I am out of line, I'm sorry, but I never mocked, until they
mocked first. Once they started using terms like idiot and daft, I replied
in kind. Guess it doesn't work that way, huh?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My OUTDOOR environment is not safe. My indoor environment is a lot safer.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You should not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tell people they should not keep cats unless they are allowed outdoors.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is wrong and unfair.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What makes you the expert on cat psychology? We all think we know what's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; best for our own cats,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and maybe we do, but that does not give us the right to tell everyone else
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what they should do.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was wrong in my earlier message saying all cats should be kept indoors,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I have the right
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to keep my cats inside, and I resent you implying that I am cruel to my
&gt;&gt;&gt; cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; otherwise.

&gt;Good God, he's constantly saying how cats should have the company of up to

&gt;You tend to say that whenever we catch you at a fib.

&gt;Karen

"/> Cats have a complex social structure that starts at the mother-kitten
level and goes up to their place in the neighbourhood. The average cat
in the UK would, in one way or another, interact with a large number
of cats in the normal week. That does not make them herd or pack
animals - just very social animals.

charity that sees people dump cats off by the thousands because they don't
want the responsibility, they are tired of the cat breeding (but don't do
anything to stop it) or the cat has been injured, attacked, or become sick
and the owners cant afford or don't want to pay for the treatment.. or worst
of all, the owners who just got tired of taking care of their cats.
I see thousands of stray cats, locked in cages because they wandered away

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't take anything this Bob guy says as &quot;real&quot;. I mean this idiot
&gt; even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinks that cats are herd/pack animals for goodness sake.

&gt;&gt;&gt; one of your comics?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank.

&gt;&gt; Good God, he's constantly saying how cats should have the company of up to
&gt;&gt; 50 cats. I'd post it but then you'd just tell me I was wasting bandwidth.
&gt;&gt; You tend to say that whenever we catch you at a fib.

&gt; LOL! I'm *almost* sorry I have Frank in my killfile. That's a good one.
&gt; Obviously his job doesn't involve reading. I'll repost Bob's statement
&gt; again for his &quot;analysis&quot; and waste bandwidth myself:

&gt; Bob said this erroneous dribble:
&gt;&gt; In the wild a cat would have 20 to 50 colony members to relate to.
&gt;&gt; Your cats need to go out to have this social interaction with other cats.

&gt; Now Bob is in my killfile too. I read this from the post by &quot;Susan &amp; Julian
&gt; Pereira&quot;. If Susan forged this as originating from Bob, I'm sorry.

&gt; Gerry

"/> If I'm not mistaken, cats are solitary animals, the only exception to this being
lions. Otherwise, cats travel alone or with one or 2 companions. I have no
idea where Bob gets the idea that cats are social animals, he's mixing them up
with (as my cats would say) the lowly dog. Dogs travel in packs. Lions travel
in &quot;prides&quot;. No other cat species that I can think of are social animals.

Well many of the needs that a cat has, including fresh air, sunlight,
natural things like grass and trees, the need to interact with other
cats in a true social way - those things cannot be fully met indoors.

In a era when great strides have been made in the keeping of exotic
pets I am saddened to see so many people who claim to be cat lovers

A child is now SAFER on the streets of the UK than they were pre-war.
Each year since the war the figures for children killed by strangers
has gone down. Since 1965 the number of children sexually abused by
strangers [1] has dropped by more than 50%.

That is the reality. Yes, children die almost every week, but nearly
all are killed by family members or people who have been trusted by
the parents.

Yes there is sexual abuse. But the same rider applies.

streets drops year by year.

&gt;&gt; Why do you keep cats? It is a fair question. To me (and most people

&gt;&gt; - we don't &quot;keep&quot; them.

&gt;Funny... I know TONS of people who keep their cats indoors. Not because they
&gt;are trying
&gt;to be cruel to them but because they love their cats so much that the risk
&gt;of them getting harmed outside
&gt;is not worth letting them out. Others let their cats outside because &quot;that's
&gt;the way it has always been - cats belong
&gt;outside.&quot; I had many cats, growing up, who were all outside cats, and most

&gt;Here's another though.. Since cats are &quot;wild animals&quot; and we do not &quot;keep&quot;
&gt;them.. how would you feel if your
&gt;cat went missing and you found it days/weeks/months later living with
&gt;someone just down the street or on the
&gt;next block.. perfectly content to stay where it was. Would you be happy for
&gt;it because &quot;it's a wild animal - I cannot
&gt;tell it where to live.&quot;?

"/> Actually yes, that is something that I've known happen several times
in the past. as recently as last October my son's cat went off (she
did not like the new kitten very much, far to energetic for her
liking) so she moved out - just as she had moved in 9 months before.
Someone found they had a new cat because she is still around and is
well looked after. It happens. I agree with you final statement, I can
do what I can to encourage my cats to stay - but I can't make them.

The problem is that indoor cats are more at risk if (and when) they

The overall result is, I believe from debated we have had here over
the last year, that the average life expectance is rather similar.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good God, he's constantly saying how cats should have the company of up to
&gt;&gt;&gt; 50 cats. I'd post it but then you'd just tell me I was wasting bandwidth.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You tend to say that whenever we catch you at a fib.

&gt;&gt; LOL! I'm *almost* sorry I have Frank in my killfile. That's a good one.
&gt;&gt; Obviously his job doesn't involve reading. I'll repost Bob's statement
&gt;&gt; again for his &quot;analysis&quot; and waste bandwidth myself:

&gt;&gt; Bob said this erroneous dribble:
&gt;&gt;&gt; In the wild a cat would have 20 to 50 colony members to relate to.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Your cats need to go out to have this social interaction with other cats.

&gt;&gt; Now Bob is in my killfile too. I read this from the post by &quot;Susan &amp; Julian
&gt;&gt; Pereira&quot;. If Susan forged this as originating from Bob, I'm sorry.

&gt;&gt; Gerry

&gt;If I'm not mistaken, cats are solitary animals, the only exception to this being
&gt;lions. Otherwise, cats travel alone or with one or 2 companions. I have no
&gt;idea where Bob gets the idea that cats are social animals, he's mixing them up
&gt;with (as my cats would say) the lowly dog. Dogs travel in packs. Lions travel
&gt;in &quot;prides&quot;. No other cat species that I can think of are social animals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi John,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was going to ask a question about the jelly in tinned cat food but
&gt; the way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; things are going at the moment I think I'll wait. I don't fancy bing
&gt; called
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a f***** moron or what ever .
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LOL.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alison

&gt;&gt; The jelly ? I think that it is the equivalent of conume' (sp ? ) --
some
&gt; form of congealed juice ---my father use to eat chicken consume' when on a
&gt; weight loss diet --
&gt;&gt; came in cans from the Campbell soup p company -- you can get the same
&gt; thing, with much more fat, by saving the drippings you get when roasting a
&gt; chicken or a beef roast. I've had my congeal after refrigerating the
&gt;&gt; left-overs with the pan juices.

&gt;&gt; This is all speculation on my part.... I've been giving the jelly
from
&gt; canned foods to my cats for the past 12 years.... Only one of six is
&gt; overweight..... and one of them eats the jelly &amp; licks up any
&gt;&gt; gravy/juice/fluid before starting on the solid meat ...

&gt;&gt; We need input from a vet or industrial food processing expert ...
&gt;&gt; Please don't be put off by some of the rude behavior here .... there is
a
&gt; lot of good information in-between the flames --- you could kill file the
&gt; regular flamers if you like..
&gt;&gt; Never saw this question before!
&gt;&gt; John

&gt; Hi John,
&gt; I've always given the jelly to my cats but the one I have now is a little
&gt; overweight and I thought I would cut out the jelly. She has 25g complete
cat
&gt; biscuits (plus 225g whiskas tin food) each day which I hope will make up
for
&gt; any vitamins lost . According to my maths, 25g of dry =100g of wet. The
&gt; label said feed a whole tin a day which I think is too much for an
average
&gt; moggie.
&gt; Alison

"/> Collie always licks the jelly off first too :)

Actually the manufacturers add vitamins etc. to the jelly so it is actually
better for the cat than the meat. Sometimes Collie will eat the jelly, leave
the meat, then eat her dry crunchy food. I don't mind because I know she is
getting all the goodness she needs and the only time she ever throws up is
when she eats the dry food so fast that she swallows it whole instead of
crunching. It swells in her tummy and she chucks it back out - still whole.

"/> See, one of the assumptions that people like our Bob/Frank/Adrian make is
that cats cannot be cats indoors - meaning express their natural instincts
or be &quot;happy&quot;. Apparently, they believe that harness training or even
enclosed runs outdoors are not suitable for cats. They base this assumption
on NO experience, since they have never met/seen/had an indoor cat before.
I seriously don't know why any rational human being would such an
assumption, and I've never heard of it before joining this group.

I have experience with both indoor and outdoor cats. Unfortunately my 3
cats I've had since I left home that were outdoor/indoor cats died of
preventable causes. Not all at once, but over a period of 10 years or so.
The causes were antifreeze poisoning (my good neighbor had a hose leak on
his car - didn't notice right away), hit by car, and killed by teenagers.
This occured in the country and the suburbs. Since I was batting 100%
failure rate resulting in death (bad odds), I decided that keeping my cats
safe was important since I had great difficulty with my other cat's deaths
(especially my Bosco). And nobody, I mean nobody is going to tell me that I
shouldn't have a cat if I cannot let them roam the streets. Especially from
people like Bob/Frank/Adrian who all advocate them running around
unneutered. Intelligence isn't exactly a ubiquitous trait on these
newsgroups I'm afraid.

For people who live in lovely safe environments (I can think of only one so
far on this newsgroup), outside is fine. But that accounts for a minority
of the population regardless of which country you come from.

&gt; Subject: Re: The Great Debate - Indoors Vs. Outdoors

&gt;&gt; and there you have the heart of the problem on this newsgroup. It is not
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; people who discuss reasonably the pros and cons of the different
&gt; lifestyles
&gt;&gt; but the unreasonable, holier than thou group whom you have discovered.
&gt; They
&gt;&gt; will now jump on you for calling your cats your kids (for some reason this
&gt;&gt; disturbs them greatly) or family (apparently they are not loving enough to
&gt;&gt; consider cats family or anyone that isn't related by blood). They will
&gt; only
&gt;&gt; intensify their claim now that you are cruel. It makes them ridiculous,
&gt; but
&gt;&gt; indeed it does get under ones skin, so I guess that is why they do it.
&gt;&gt; That's why I think they are trolls; they LIKE to get people mad at them
&gt; for
&gt;&gt; some odd reason. All I can tell you is your talking to a complete wall if
&gt;&gt; you think they won't continue to tell people what to do.

&gt; It's crazy. I have already decided to ignore one of them because I can't
&gt; stand his
&gt; narrow minded hypocrisy anymore. I would just quit this group altogether but
&gt; I know I shouldn't let a few rotten animals spoil the basket :)

&gt; So... tell me more about YOUR cats!! :)

"/> Grant and Sugar are all black with greeny gold eyes. I got them from a co
worker who had some outdoor cats that had had a litter. They had a sister
that was all white but she got run over the very same day I came and got the
other two. They had earmites, worms and fleas, but we got them over all
that. Grant was very lucky because a few weeks before I got them, he crawled
into my coworkers engine and was driven 40 miles (on a hot August day) then
sat on black pavement all day. He survived amazingly. I think he still has
some problems from that (he doesn't see super well and sometimes he wakes
out of a deep sleep straight up into the air as though from a nightmare) but
has grown up to be a *big* boy. Solid and looong. Real lap fungus, lover
boy, schmooze. Sugar is petite and pretty. She is super playful and only
cuddles on her terms.They are wonderful kitties and I love them soooo much.

&gt;&gt; I am from Canada too (B.C.) and I find it hard to believe
that everyone is
&gt;&gt; so caring, and careful of outside pets in England. That cats
roam freely
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt; little danger to themselves. What an idyllic, fantasmigorical
place :)

&gt;&gt; As it stands I have decided to ignore Bob from now on. I
think he is
&gt;&gt; deluded,
&gt;&gt; and he is extremely opionated and judgemental. I did not come
to the
&gt;&gt; newsgroups
&gt;&gt; to be abused or judged. I came to hear about other people's
cats and maybe
&gt;&gt; share
&gt;&gt; some of my stories!

&gt; Oh BC is lovely :-) I was born in Nova Scotia, now live in
Ontario but have
&gt; seen some of BC. Even did the wine run through the Okanagan.
Loved the Echo
&gt; lake area. Now talking about idyllic ;-)

&gt; Don't get the wrong impression about people from England by the
likes of
&gt; Bob/Frank/Adrian. You find nuts like them in any country. I
don't know if
&gt; they actually believe the stuff they say, or if they say it
just because
&gt; they're immature bored people who like getting attention. And
thanks to the
&gt; Internet we get to see the worst of them sometimes. There are
some
&gt; excellent contributers here from the UK that don't hold their
views. Bob has
&gt; been in my kill list since summer. I only see his posts when
others quote
&gt; him!

&gt; Cats? Wow, what a subject for a cat newsgroup. Well let me
introduce you
&gt; to my lovely furrballs. I have three cats. Two are from the
humane society
&gt; and one is a Bengal. Willow is my black cat, Pouncer is my
ginger tabby,
&gt; and Suma is the Bengal. I have some pics of them here (adding

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good God, he's constantly saying how cats should have the company of
up to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 50 cats. I'd post it but then you'd just tell me I was wasting
bandwidth.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You tend to say that whenever we catch you at a fib.

&gt;&gt;&gt; LOL! I'm *almost* sorry I have Frank in my killfile. That's a good
one.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously his job doesn't involve reading. I'll repost Bob's statement
&gt;&gt;&gt; again for his &quot;analysis&quot; and waste bandwidth myself:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob said this erroneous dribble:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the wild a cat would have 20 to 50 colony members to relate to.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your cats need to go out to have this social interaction with other
cats.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now Bob is in my killfile too. I read this from the post by &quot;Susan &amp;
Julian
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pereira&quot;. If Susan forged this as originating from Bob, I'm sorry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Gerry

&gt;&gt;If I'm not mistaken, cats are solitary animals, the only exception to
this being
&gt;&gt;lions. Otherwise, cats travel alone or with one or 2 companions. I have
no
&gt;&gt;idea where Bob gets the idea that cats are social animals, he's mixing
them up
&gt;&gt;with (as my cats would say) the lowly dog. Dogs travel in packs. Lions
travel
&gt;&gt;in &quot;prides&quot;. No other cat species that I can think of are social
animals.

&gt; Look at the structure of a true feral colony.

"/> ...and?

Feral colonies are *not* based on companionship or socialization - in the
same sense as packs of wolves or most dogs. The basis of feral colonies are
food and shelter - not hanging out with pals....

Feral cats which support themselves by hunting prey dispersed over a wide
area tend to lead solitary lives. When there is an abundant food source
concentrated at one point (e.g. when a cat lover regularly puts out food) a
group of cats tends to form around it.

Feral cat colony size is sometimes governed by the availability of suitable
shelter positions rather than by the availability of food.

Most feral cat colonies consist of related females and their offspring. New
members are recruited to the group by birth - strange females usually being
excluded. Mature males are usually more loosely attached to several groups
and often move between different groups of fertile females.

Distribution of 237 cat colonies in Britain has been studied. A high
percentage of these cats are fed by people nearby or have access to food in
waste bins. Food often is the common thread that keeps several cats in a
specific area.

The basis of feral colonies are food and shelter - not necessarily
socialization.... or hangin' out with the gang...

&gt;safe was important since I had great difficulty with my other cat's deaths
&gt;(especially my Bosco). And nobody, I mean nobody is going to tell me that I
&gt;shouldn't have a cat if I cannot let them roam the streets.

&gt; Hello? Have you not heard of sex offenders? Reckless drivers? Bullying
gangs
&gt; of
&gt; kids? In a small town where everyone knows everyone it would be fine to
let
&gt; your 5 year old to go
&gt; to the corner store, but in the 21st century
&gt; in the city it's just not safe. My parents did not let me go to the store
&gt; unsupervised until
&gt; I was AT LEAST 9 years old (and this was over 20 years ago). They were not
&gt; over-protective,
&gt; they were PROTECTIVE. If I wanted to go to the store I went with my
parents
&gt; or my older brother
&gt; until I was 9. I was allowed to go to friends house without someone coming
&gt; with me IF these friends
&gt; lived very close. This was BEFORE most of these sex offenders came out of
&gt; the woodwork. In the decades
&gt; that have followed I have heard so many stories of little ones being
&gt; abducted right off of their front yard,
&gt; or while &quot;going down to the local shop&quot;.

&gt;&gt; All I can say is kids must be more responsible over here.

&gt; Do you even have children? They are wonderful, amazing small people.. but
if
&gt; you
&gt; send a 5 year old out by himself, AND YOU SAY YOU LIVE IN A CITY, do you
&gt; not realize the amount of danger you are putting them in?

&gt;&gt; Why do you keep cats? It is a fair question. To me (and most people
&gt;&gt; around the world) one of the things that defines a cat is that it is a
&gt;&gt; wild animal that has chosen to live in our home. Our cats stay with us
&gt;&gt; - we don't &quot;keep&quot; them.

&gt; Funny... I know TONS of people who keep their cats indoors. Not because
they
&gt; are trying
&gt; to be cruel to them but because they love their cats so much that the risk
&gt; of them getting harmed outside
&gt; is not worth letting them out. Others let their cats outside because
&quot;that's
&gt; the way it has always been - cats belong
&gt; outside.&quot; I had many cats, growing up, who were all outside cats, and most
&gt; of the disappeared in the 1st year.
&gt; They were all well fed, loved, and paid attention to, but we lived on a
busy
&gt; street.. and we never saw them again.

&gt; Here's another though.. Since cats are &quot;wild animals&quot; and we do not &quot;keep&quot;
&gt; them.. how would you feel if your
&gt; cat went missing and you found it days/weeks/months later living with
&gt; someone just down the street or on the
&gt; next block.. perfectly content to stay where it was. Would you be happy
for
&gt; it because &quot;it's a wild animal - I cannot
&gt; tell it where to live.&quot;?

of
&gt; up to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 50 cats. I'd post it but then you'd just tell me I was wasting
&gt; bandwidth.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You tend to say that whenever we catch you at a fib.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LOL! I'm *almost* sorry I have Frank in my killfile. That's a good
&gt; one.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously his job doesn't involve reading. I'll repost Bob's
statement
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; again for his &quot;analysis&quot; and waste bandwidth myself:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob said this erroneous dribble:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the wild a cat would have 20 to 50 colony members to relate to.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your cats need to go out to have this social interaction with other
&gt; cats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now Bob is in my killfile too. I read this from the post by &quot;Susan &amp;
&gt; Julian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pereira&quot;. If Susan forged this as originating from Bob, I'm sorry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gerry

&gt;&gt;&gt;If I'm not mistaken, cats are solitary animals, the only exception to
&gt; this being
&gt;&gt;&gt;lions. Otherwise, cats travel alone or with one or 2 companions. I
have
&gt; no
&gt;&gt;&gt;idea where Bob gets the idea that cats are social animals, he's mixing
&gt; them up
&gt;&gt;&gt;with (as my cats would say) the lowly dog. Dogs travel in packs.
Lions
&gt; travel
&gt;&gt;&gt;in &quot;prides&quot;. No other cat species that I can think of are social
&gt; animals.

&gt;&gt; Look at the structure of a true feral colony.

&gt; ...and?

&gt; Feral colonies are *not* based on companionship or socialization - in the
&gt; same sense as packs of wolves or most dogs. The basis of feral colonies
are
&gt; food and shelter - not hanging out with pals....

&gt; Feral cats which support themselves by hunting prey dispersed over a wide
&gt; area tend to lead solitary lives. When there is an abundant food source
&gt; concentrated at one point (e.g. when a cat lover regularly puts out food)
a
&gt; group of cats tends to form around it.

&gt; Feral cat colony size is sometimes governed by the availability of
suitable
&gt; shelter positions rather than by the availability of food.

&gt; Most feral cat colonies consist of related females and their offspring.
New
&gt; members are recruited to the group by birth - strange females usually
being
&gt; excluded. Mature males are usually more loosely attached to several groups
&gt; and often move between different groups of fertile females.

&gt; Distribution of 237 cat colonies in Britain has been studied. A high
&gt; percentage of these cats are fed by people nearby or have access to food
in
&gt; waste bins. Food often is the common thread that keeps several cats in a
&gt; specific area.

&gt; The basis of feral colonies are food and shelter - not necessarily
&gt; socialization.... or hangin' out with the gang...

&quot;Distribution of 237 cat colonies in Britain has been studied. A high
percentage of these cats are fed by people nearby or have access to food in
waste bins. Food often is the common thread that keeps several cats in a
specific area.&quot;

And this came from Katherine Houpt, Professor of Veterinary Physiology and
Director of the Behavior Clinic at Cornell

&quot;Cats have a fairly fluid organization in their social structure. When food
is dispersed, as on an island inhabited by ground-nesting birds, cats are
solitary, but when food resources are clumped, as on a dairy farm, cats are
more social.&quot;

The basis of feral colonies are food and shelter - not necessarily
socialization.... or hangin' out with the gang... Prove otherwise! (Fat
chance)

In addition, you *still* haven't produced *any* evidence of a
confinement-stress-related epidemic in the USA!

Suffice to say, you have proven, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that you are
absolutely CLUELESS about cats and that you're just following someone else's
lead! Perhaps you should get a sheep dog, it suits you better.

Cherrio and Tally Ho - off you go!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good God, he's constantly saying how cats should have the company
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; up to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 50 cats. I'd post it but then you'd just tell me I was wasting
&gt;&gt; bandwidth.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You tend to say that whenever we catch you at a fib.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LOL! I'm *almost* sorry I have Frank in my killfile. That's a
good
&gt;&gt; one.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously his job doesn't involve reading. I'll repost Bob's
&gt; statement
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; again for his &quot;analysis&quot; and waste bandwidth myself:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob said this erroneous dribble:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the wild a cat would have 20 to 50 colony members to relate
to.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your cats need to go out to have this social interaction with
other
&gt;&gt; cats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now Bob is in my killfile too. I read this from the post by &quot;Susan
&amp;
&gt;&gt; Julian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pereira&quot;. If Susan forged this as originating from Bob, I'm sorry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gerry

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If I'm not mistaken, cats are solitary animals, the only exception to
&gt;&gt; this being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lions. Otherwise, cats travel alone or with one or 2 companions. I
&gt; have
&gt;&gt; no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;idea where Bob gets the idea that cats are social animals, he's
mixing
&gt;&gt; them up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with (as my cats would say) the lowly dog. Dogs travel in packs.
&gt; Lions
&gt;&gt; travel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in &quot;prides&quot;. No other cat species that I can think of are social
&gt;&gt; animals.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Look at the structure of a true feral colony.

&gt;&gt; ...and?

&gt;&gt; Feral colonies are *not* based on companionship or socialization - in
the
&gt;&gt; same sense as packs of wolves or most dogs. The basis of feral colonies
&gt; are
&gt;&gt; food and shelter - not hanging out with pals....

&gt;&gt; Feral cats which support themselves by hunting prey dispersed over a
wide
&gt;&gt; area tend to lead solitary lives. When there is an abundant food source
&gt;&gt; concentrated at one point (e.g. when a cat lover regularly puts out
food)
&gt; a
&gt;&gt; group of cats tends to form around it.

&gt;&gt; Feral cat colony size is sometimes governed by the availability of
&gt; suitable
&gt;&gt; shelter positions rather than by the availability of food.

&gt;&gt; Most feral cat colonies consist of related females and their offspring.
&gt; New
&gt;&gt; members are recruited to the group by birth - strange females usually
&gt; being
&gt;&gt; excluded. Mature males are usually more loosely attached to several
groups
&gt;&gt; and often move between different groups of fertile females.

&gt; Thanks, Phil. I assumed this to be true, but did not
&gt; have the factual data to back it up.

had an indoor-outdoor cat. I knew that there were more and different dangers
outside, but I felt there was also more fun and stimulation. So I worked
hard to make it work for Thackeray. I adopted him in November, and, as
I lived in Minnesota, I kept him in altogether until April when it started
getting warm. For about 6 weeks, I only let him out when I could be with
him, until I was sure he could climb trees well, and knew which house
was his. I talked to all the neighbors and asked them to please let me
know if they had any problems or concerns about him. When he started taking
naps outside, I checked his spot to make sure he wasn't visible from any angle.
(dogs were not out off-leash there, so that afforded some comfort, too).
In the summer, Thackie and I played tree tag: I would run to a tree and
then he'd zoom up it, then I'd go to another tree and he'd run up that one
too. In the fall, he'd help me rake lots and lots of leaves. In the winter,
he didn't go out much, but I shoveled the back yard into a maze for him,
and on warmer days he loved to play in his maze. I was lucky: he survived
all that for 5 years, and didn't die until we had moved and he had been an
indoor cat for 3 years.

I'm rambling, I know, because I wasn't sure just what point I wanted to
make. I guess it's this: sometimes when an owner lets their cat out, it's
because they're trying really hard to give their cat all the possible
enjoyment they can AND keep their cat safe, knowing they may be making
a hard-breaking mistake. Riley and Sukey will never be outdoor cats, but
I still sometimes wish there was some way they could know that life a
little, instead of just watching it through a window.

which rather coincide with yours. There is also the cat owner who is highly
involved indoor/outdoor. In the right situation I believe it works but
requires a good deal of participation from the owner that perhaps not all
the go-hoers on the newsgroup would care to do. I wrote:

Maybe this is a good place to elaborate on what I mean be supervision. I
grew up with indoor/outdoor cats. We got our first one when I was five (she
chose us) and it snowballed from there. We had a neighbor that if he even
saw a cat walking across his yard, who would call the pound. One of our
beauties got shot in the face with a bebe gun (got her patched up, but it
was nasty) and she also disappeared for three weeks one time and came back
skinny and tired but unharmed. So we changed our ways. We had seven cats. We
made sure we knew when they went out, and when they came in. They 'had' to
be in by dark. We always let them out the back door into the fenced yard and
if we weren't out there, we checked on them occasionally or checked out the
window. If one started heading out of the yard you called them back and got
them interested in something in the yard. you didn't have to be there ALL
the time and they pretty much learned not to roam. If we were going
somewhere, you fetched them all in. In the winter, they didn't care to go
out much or for long anyway. Some of these cats were strays we took in, some
were born to the house. We accounted for our cats. Is this an unreasonable
attitude to take to caring for a cat?

I think that this is a reasonable compromise with reasonable accountability.
I do not think it is necessary for a cat to have outdoor access to be happy,
but if it can go out, you'd better be prepared to take measures to help its
safety which includes the above. I thought the practice you made of asking
the neighbors to let you know if there was a problem was great too. It may
help some of them to also &quot;look after&quot; the cat and at least they know it is
owned and by who.

&gt;&gt; ............
&gt;&gt; I think you may have hit the bullseye! At least this will help me be
more
&gt;&gt; tolerant.

&gt;&gt; Sharp thinking!

&gt;&gt; Phil

&gt; I'm jumping into the middle of this, so forgive me if I'm retreading old
&gt; ground. I found the categories Phil described very enlightening, and based
&gt; on that, I would consider myself a highly involved cat owner. But I have
&gt; in the past, with a different cat and in a different kind of neighborhood
&gt; had an indoor-outdoor cat. I knew that there were more and different
dangers
&gt; outside, but I felt there was also more fun and stimulation. So I worked
&gt; hard to make it work for Thackeray. I adopted him in November, and, as
&gt; I lived in Minnesota, I kept him in altogether until April when it started
&gt; getting warm. For about 6 weeks, I only let him out when I could be with
&gt; him, until I was sure he could climb trees well, and knew which house
&gt; was his. I talked to all the neighbors and asked them to please let me
&gt; know if they had any problems or concerns about him. When he started
taking
&gt; naps outside, I checked his spot to make sure he wasn't visible from any
angle.
&gt; (dogs were not out off-leash there, so that afforded some comfort, too).
&gt; In the summer, Thackie and I played tree tag: I would run to a tree and
&gt; then he'd zoom up it, then I'd go to another tree and he'd run up that one
&gt; too. In the fall, he'd help me rake lots and lots of leaves. In the
winter,
&gt; he didn't go out much, but I shoveled the back yard into a maze for him,
&gt; and on warmer days he loved to play in his maze. I was lucky: he survived
&gt; all that for 5 years, and didn't die until we had moved and he had been an
&gt; indoor cat for 3 years.

&gt; I'm rambling, I know, because I wasn't sure just what point I wanted to
&gt; make. I guess it's this: sometimes when an owner lets their cat out, it's
&gt; because they're trying really hard to give their cat all the possible
&gt; enjoyment they can AND keep their cat safe, knowing they may be making
&gt; a hard-breaking mistake. Riley and Sukey will never be outdoor cats, but
&gt; I still sometimes wish there was some way they could know that life a
&gt; little, instead of just watching it through a window.

"/> I would absolutely consider you a highly involved cat owner!!!

Years ago my cats were all indoor/outdoor, also; free to come and go at
will. But times have changed and the outdoors, in most areas, is not as
safe as it once was - in fact, its dangerous. I lost one cat to trauma - I
won't lose another. An outdoor-oriented cat would certainly be unhappy
indoors exclusively - some can be converted, but many can't be. I think the
best of both worlds is a protected outdoor environment.

An outdoor pen can be constructed very easily and cheaply - even enclosing a
tree! My first pen was about 42' X 10' and cost about $100. My new one is
6,400 cu. ft with two trees and cost about $800 - probably could be build
cheaper by using chicken wire. My next home will have an enclosure around
three sides of the house with cutouts for trees at roof level - if not the
entire property fenced in. Local laws, here, prohibit perimeter fences
higher than 4'.

For apartment dwellers, it depends on your landlord. When I lived in NYC, I
screened in my balcony and had a tree and grass box. Also, at night, I used
to take my cats to a fenced in tennis court and let them run around. If you
don't have a balcony, you can a use a large cage, similar to a giant
birdcage (I have a picture and the information if you'd like to see it),
that has platforms for climbing and attaches outside your window.

Large pens are also available (80&quot; x 40&quot; x 40&quot;); with add-on sections 40' x
40&quot; x 40&quot;. And flexible pens 48&quot; H with add-ons are available also that you
can shape. I also saw small window units that are built like
airconditioners and hang out the window, but I think they're too small -
still they're better than nothing. They're large enough for a cat to
stretch out in the sun and get fresh air.

How's Riley? Good, I hope!

Phil.

&gt; the cats do not get on reasonably well and learn their position in the

"/> Cat groups do not seem to establish a clear dominance hierarchy in the same
way as wolves or most dogs. Although an individual cat in a group may have
precedence in access to resources such as food, such precedence does not
seem to be claimed by displays of dominance nor acknowledged by displays of
submission by other cats as in dog or wolf packs. Instead, when provoked,
the 'superior' cat may show actual aggression or pronounced threat behaviour
towards the others to which they respond with defensive or fearful, rather
than appeasing, behaviour (Voith and Borchelt, 1986).

"/> Some feral cats voluntarily form colonies with high levels of social
interaction. Factors which influence the tendency towards sociability seem
to be:

1 . Availability and dispersion of food: feral cats which support themselves
by hunting prey dispersed over a wide area tend to lead solitary lives. When
there is an abundant food source concentrated at one point (e.g. when a cat
lover regularly puts out food) a relatively stable group of cats tends to
form around it (Kerby and Macdonald, 1988). The same applies to pet cats
attached to one household.

2. Shelter: feral cat colony size is sometimes governed by the
availability of suitable shelter positions rather than by the availability
of food (Bradshaw, 1992). Except, perhaps, for households keeping large
numbers of cats, pet cats normally find shelter easily.

3. Gender: most feral cat colonies consist of related females and their
offspring. New members are recruited to the group by birth - strange females
usually being excluded. Mature males are usually more loosely attached to
several groups and often move between different groups of fertile females.

The basis of feral colonies are food and/or shelter and mating- not
necessarily the &quot;need&quot; for socialization.... to hang out with the gang...
Prove otherwise! (Fat chance).

Also, your point is moot because we're discussing *domestic* *pet* cats not
ferals. My cats &quot;socialize&quot; with each other. You're going nowhere with
this.

&gt; you really want then just to be awkward :)

&gt; In other words. Let the cat walk out onto the grass itself. Don't, as

"/> I can certainly see a &quot;truism&quot; here, regarding the general character of a
cat. However, having read the bulk of your recent posts, I'm aware of [what
I believe is] your agenda here.

The argument that it is &quot;natural&quot; for a cat to want to spend time outdoors,
and therefore, that one should permit it to unmitigatedly do so, is a vacant
one.

Is it not &quot;natural&quot; for humans to pee and poop as soon as the urge to do so
arises? Is it not &quot;natural&quot; for humans to respond to feelings of &quot;chemistry&quot;
by &quot;pawing&quot; at one another and commencing the sexual act, no matter the
circumstances? Is it not &quot;natural&quot; for humans to react violently towards
those whom they perceive as threatening?

All of these behaviors are &quot;natural.&quot; So why, then, do we not succumb to
them, in the civilized world??? Is it not because we KNOW BETTER?!?!??? Is
it not because we realize the CONSEQUENCES of uncontrolled behavior???

You, sir, of course, may choose to act entirely based upon your instincts.
But I, knowing that certain behaviors are, in the long run, UNHEALTHY for me
or mine or others, choose to curtail those behaviors.

If you want to shit, fuck others, and beat them up, anytime and anywhere,
this is NOT the place to do it. Take your shit, and everything that goes

&gt; But Phil, even in a wide-spread group, but even more so in a close
&gt; grouping - you still have to have socilisation - things don't work if
&gt; the cats do not get on reasonably well and learn their position in the
&gt; group.

"/> This is a result of needing the food and shelter. Food and shelter are the
reasons for the colonies. Not socialization. But I guess it's difficult for
you to grasp that, even though Phil has given you ample explanation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Even in the island situation the best areas for hunting go to the cats
&gt; with the higher social ranking. Cats are not pack animals in the sense
&gt; of dogs. They do not cooperate to obtain food in the same way as some
&gt; animals. They therefor have to have a social structure or they would
&gt; spend all their time fighting over everything.

"/> Why looky there! You got it. They must develop socialization in the colony
situation in order to survive. The socialization is a by product of
necessity for food and shelter. You just don't seem to be able to grasp that
if they all had adequate food and shelter individually, they wouldn't
colonize. That should tell you something, but I guess you are too dense.

"/> I don't think anyone here believes that cats cannot be social once
individuals acclimatize to each other. It's just that the arguement &quot;Cats
*must* be let out in order to socially interact with 50 cats because it is
their nature and makes them happy&quot; doesn't hold water. The argument is
based on faulty assumptions, perhaps arising out of these people's
anthropomorphic attitudes.

Do cats &quot;love&quot; us? I'd certainly say they *own* us (my cats are marking me
constantly with headbutts) and recognize us as a source of comfort, safety,
food, and stimulation. Would my cats be just as happy with anyone else?
No, at least not at first. They know me, and react to me in ways they will
not with others. Perhaps we can call that love. Heck, it's probably more
&quot;love&quot; than I've experienced from some people who've said the word ;-)

An interesting thing also happens to domestic cats kept as pets, especially
neutered ones - and that is regression to kitten behavior, or expression of
maternal behavior. For example, my cats alternatively view me (and each of
the other cats) as their kitten and their mother. They take turns licking
each other (and me), and pad me with their paws like they were trying to
milk me while purring their little faces off. But this has nothing to do
with &quot;Cats must be able to roam to socialize with other roaming cats or they
will not be happy&quot;. I would suspect that roaming and confronting 50 cats
everyday would be stressful, not to mention hazardous in terms of disease
and injury.

But a solitary cat indoors is not good IMO either, just because it's less
likely the owners would have the time to provide the necessary amount of
stimulation a cat needs to be happy/healthy. My cats not only give each
other baths, but take turns stalking and hunting each other, and wrestling
for hours each day. 2 or more cats at home that do adjust to each other and
get along is much better than one for this reason.

Alison, noooooooo say it isn't so! Actually, I think you are probably
right on one level. But I remember once when I had to leave a cat I had
had for a long time with someone for a few weeks and he got very
depressed. They do get used to one human family and, I believe,
attached. At least, I like to think so. wishful thinking? Maybe.

&gt;The argument that it is &quot;natural&quot; for a cat to want to spend time outdoors,
&gt;and therefore, that one should permit it to unmitigatedly do so, is a vacant
&gt;one.

&gt;&gt; Do you realise how important socialisation is to cats? Looks like you

&gt;&gt; such small areas.

&gt;Quote your sources, please. I used to think as you did until others who

Anthropomorphism is a constant danger of course. But in this case the
danger is the reverse, that of failing to look within ourselves, and
see how we have been screwed up by ignoring our natural heritage, and
then not applying that to our animals.

&gt;&gt; grouping - you still have to have socilisation - things don't work if
&gt;&gt; the cats do not get on reasonably well and learn their position in the
&gt;&gt; group.

&gt;Cat groups do not seem to establish a clear dominance hierarchy in the same
&gt;way as wolves or most dogs. Although an individual cat in a group may have
&gt;precedence in access to resources such as food, such precedence does not
&gt;seem to be claimed by displays of dominance nor acknowledged by displays of
&gt;submission by other cats as in dog or wolf packs. Instead, when provoked,
&gt;the 'superior' cat may show actual aggression or pronounced threat behaviour
&gt;towards the others to which they respond with defensive or fearful, rather
&gt;than appeasing, behaviour (Voith and Borchelt, 1986).

"/> It have the same effect Phil. It may not be the same as in dogs but it

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Even in the island situation the best areas for hunting go to the cats

&gt;&gt; animals. They therefor have to have a social structure or they would
&gt;&gt; spend all their time fighting over everything.

&gt;Some feral cats voluntarily form colonies with high levels of social
&gt;interaction. Factors which influence the tendency towards sociability seem
&gt;to be:

&gt;1 . Availability and dispersion of food: feral cats which support themselves

&gt;attached to one household.

&gt;2. Shelter: feral cat colony size is sometimes governed by the
&gt;availability of suitable shelter positions rather than by the availability
&gt;of food (Bradshaw, 1992). Except, perhaps, for households keeping large
&gt;numbers of cats, pet cats normally find shelter easily.

&gt;3. Gender: most feral cat colonies consist of related females and their

or have my &quot;beliefs&quot; tested.

I believe in God.. that doesn't mean I want to have people trash me for

&gt;&gt;&gt; Feral cats live in colonies and socially interact with each other .
&gt; How
&gt;&gt;&gt; many depends on

&gt;&gt; ...the amount of food and shelter available. The basis of feral
colonies
&gt;&gt; are food and shelter - not necessarily socialization. Where food and
&gt;&gt; shelter are widely dispersed, cats are solitary. It understandable to
&gt;&gt; believe the colonies are &quot;clubs&quot; because the cat's seem to hang out
&gt;&gt; together, however, the thread that binds them together is food and/or
&gt;&gt; shelter and not necessarily socialization.

&gt;&gt; Phil.

&gt; Hi Phil,
&gt; I wouldn't say cats are solitary but independant.

"/> Hi Alison,

The discussion kinda went off course when someone said cats need to
socialize with large groups of cats to be happy, which obviously is not
true. We began discussing domesticated pet cats and wound up practically
comparing our pet cats to the Dinictis! I hope I didn't give you the
impression that I was implying cats are not or can not be sociable! I have
5 cats that prove that theory wrong!

They like to play

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; together and sleep next to each other but they're just as happy to go off
&gt; somewhere on their own or sleep in another room.

"/> I believe cats form bonds with each other. I have two that are inseparable;
the other three seem like they couldn't care less who they're hanging out
with! Aside from an occasional hiss and swat, they all get along and play
nicely with each other - could be because they *have to* get along, but I
don't think that's it entirely. They also like to be alone at times in
their own &quot;special&quot; place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We like to think our cats love us for ourselves but I'm sure they would
be
&gt; just as happy with anyone who fed them and cared for them.

"/> I have a cat who was surrendered because of behavioral problems after being
declawed. In fact, she was placed and returned three times. The person who
fostered her for about 6 months came over once to see her - the cat wouldn't
go near her anymore. Three of my 5 get along with everybody - the other
two, only with me. It seems they view their caretakers as maternal figures,
also.

Whatever their motive is, it sures seems like love - if it isn't, they sure
do a good impression of it! ;)

Phil.

My two cats are indoors. Cobee has been inside all his life, Ally for the

3 1/2 year old life. Both cats have healthy appetites, normal bowel
movements, regular sleep patterns.
They both have healthy, plush coats and bright eyes. They are playful,
restful, energetic and mischeveous
in turns. They are NOT suffering from any stress related disorder that I can
see of. The only time they
DO get stressed is when I put them in a car to take them in for their yearly
vet visits.

All but a small minority on the UK and Europe would take that

needs, and one of those is to be allowed outside. If you can't do that
then your home is not right for most cats.

&gt;&gt; I know several cats like that. Pick them up and take them anywhere and
&gt;&gt; it is a case of &quot;Not on your life bud, I go where I want to go.&quot; I've
&gt;&gt; often thought that is you want to put a cat in one place then it is
&gt;&gt; better to put it as far away from there as possible - it will go where
&gt;&gt; you really want then just to be awkward :)

&gt;&gt; In other words. Let the cat walk out onto the grass itself. Don't, as
&gt;&gt; Gerry puts it, &quot;thrust&quot; the poor mog out, just let it find its own way
&gt;&gt; out.

&gt;I can certainly see a &quot;truism&quot; here, regarding the general character of a
&gt;cat. However, having read the bulk of your recent posts, I'm aware of [what
&gt;I believe is] your agenda here.

&gt;The argument that it is &quot;natural&quot; for a cat to want to spend time outdoors,
&gt;and therefore, that one should permit it to unmitigatedly do so, is a vacant
&gt;one.

&gt;Is it not &quot;natural&quot; for humans to pee and poop as soon as the urge to do so
&gt;arises? Is it not &quot;natural&quot; for humans to respond to feelings of &quot;chemistry&quot;
&gt;by &quot;pawing&quot; at one another and commencing the sexual act, no matter the
&gt;circumstances? Is it not &quot;natural&quot; for humans to react violently towards
&gt;those whom they perceive as threatening?

&gt;All of these behaviors are &quot;natural.&quot; So why, then, do we not succumb to
&gt;them, in the civilized world??? Is it not because we KNOW BETTER?!?!??? Is
&gt;it not because we realize the CONSEQUENCES of uncontrolled behavior???

&gt;You, sir, of course, may choose to act entirely based upon your instincts.
&gt;But I, knowing that certain behaviors are, in the long run, UNHEALTHY for me
&gt;or mine or others, choose to curtail those behaviors.

&gt;If you want to shit, fuck others, and beat them up, anytime and anywhere,
&gt;this is NOT the place to do it. Take your shit, and everything that goes
&gt;with it, somewhere else.

&gt;Thank you.

&gt;No Frank, its food and/or shelter and mating that brings cats together.
&gt;Where food and shelter are widely dispersed, cats are solitary.

&gt;Some cat's living together form bonds, others never get along.

&gt;&gt; But Phil, even in a wide-spread group, but even more so in a close
&gt;&gt; grouping - you still have to have socilisation - things don't work if
&gt;&gt; the cats do not get on reasonably well and learn their position in the
&gt;&gt; group.

&gt;This is a result of needing the food and shelter. Food and shelter are the
&gt;reasons for the colonies. Not socialization. But I guess it's difficult for
&gt;you to grasp that, even though Phil has given you ample explanation.

"/> Oh dear, when these simple minds get hold of something....

Look Karen, its like a chicken and egg situation. To be able to exist
together they need to socialise, to make the most of a small area they
need to be together. And round and round and round....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Even in the island situation the best areas for hunting go to the cats
&gt;&gt; with the higher social ranking. Cats are not pack animals in the sense
&gt;&gt; of dogs. They do not cooperate to obtain food in the same way as some
&gt;&gt; animals. They therefor have to have a social structure or they would
&gt;&gt; spend all their time fighting over everything.

&gt;Why looky there! You got it. They must develop socialization in the colony
&gt;situation in order to survive. The socialization is a by product of
&gt;necessity for food and shelter. You just don't seem to be able to grasp that
&gt;if they all had adequate food and shelter individually, they wouldn't
&gt;colonize. That should tell you something, but I guess you are too dense.

"/> But the socilisation is built in already because it is a natural part
of their make-up. Deprived of it they are the poorer.

&gt;&gt; Having social contact with other cats is not exactly &quot;hanging out with

&gt;&gt; The social structure of a cat community is very important.

&gt;Only if you *have* a cat community! Cats don't need a community to be

Hi Phil,
Some of the my posts haven't been showing up so I'm reading bits of posts
attached to others
. I suppose I should go back and read all the posts but theres too many!
I think we should agree that we all love cats and want to do the best for
them under the circumstances in which we live.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the wild a cat would have 20 to 50 colony members to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Feral cats live in colonies and socially interact with each other
.
&gt;&gt; How
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many depends on

&gt;&gt;&gt; ...the amount of food and shelter available. The basis of feral
&gt; colonies
&gt;&gt;&gt; are food and shelter - not necessarily socialization. Where food and
&gt;&gt;&gt; shelter are widely dispersed, cats are solitary. It understandable
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; believe the colonies are &quot;clubs&quot; because the cat's seem to hang out
&gt;&gt;&gt; together, however, the thread that binds them together is food and/or
&gt;&gt;&gt; shelter and not necessarily socialization.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Phil.

&gt;&gt; Hi Phil,
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't say cats are solitary but independant.

&gt; Hi Alison,

&gt; The discussion kinda went off course when someone said cats need to
&gt; socialize with large groups of cats to be happy, which obviously is not
&gt; true. We began discussing domesticated pet cats and wound up practically
&gt; comparing our pet cats to the Dinictis! I hope I didn't give you the
&gt; impression that I was implying cats are not or can not be sociable! I
have
&gt; 5 cats that prove that theory wrong!

&gt; They like to play
&gt;&gt; together and sleep next to each other but they're just as happy to go
off
&gt;&gt; somewhere on their own or sleep in another room.

&gt; I believe cats form bonds with each other. I have two that are
inseparable;
&gt; the other three seem like they couldn't care less who they're hanging out
&gt; with! Aside from an occasional hiss and swat, they all get along and play
&gt; nicely with each other - could be because they *have to* get along, but I
&gt; don't think that's it entirely. They also like to be alone at times in
&gt; their own &quot;special&quot; place.

&gt;&gt; We like to think our cats love us for ourselves but I'm sure they would
&gt; be
&gt;&gt; just as happy with anyone who fed them and cared for them.

&gt; I have a cat who was surrendered because of behavioral problems after
being
&gt; declawed. In fact, she was placed and returned three times. The person
who
&gt; fostered her for about 6 months came over once to see her - the cat
wouldn't
&gt; go near her anymore. Three of my 5 get along with everybody - the other
&gt; two, only with me. It seems they view their caretakers as maternal
figures,
&gt; also.

&gt; Whatever their motive is, it sures seems like love - if it isn't, they sur
e
&gt; do a good impression of it! ;)

&gt; Phil.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But Phil, even in a wide-spread group, but even more so in a close
&gt;&gt;&gt; grouping - you still have to have socilisation - things don't work if
&gt;&gt;&gt; the cats do not get on reasonably well and learn their position in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; group.

&gt;&gt;This is a result of needing the food and shelter. Food and shelter are
the
&gt;&gt;reasons for the colonies. Not socialization. But I guess it's difficult
for
&gt;&gt;you to grasp that, even though Phil has given you ample explanation.

"/> That's the point you can't seem to comprehend. Cats don't *need* to exist
together. If they have their own food and shelter, feral cats are solitary
which means they don't naturally gather unless they HAVE TO for food and
shelter. Socialization only becomes important if cats NEED to gather for
food and/or shelter -- and since we're discussing OUR cats who HAVE food and
shelter, they don't need to go out and socialize. Cats that live together
in the home ARE already socializing.

to make the most of a small area they

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; need to be together. And round and round and round....

"/> Let me explain this in *real* simple terms that even you can understand.
The force that brings the cats together in an area is food and/or shelter.
When food and shelter are dispersed, cats are solitary. Therefore, my
obtuse friend, socialization is a consequence of the need for food and
shelter rather than a need itself. If this were not true, feral cats who
have their own food supply and shelter would not be solitary.

I know I'm hitting the nail on the head, but it just keeps bending.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Even in the island situation the best areas for hunting go to the cats
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the higher social ranking. Cats are not pack animals in the sense
&gt;&gt;&gt; of dogs. They do not cooperate to obtain food in the same way as some
&gt;&gt;&gt; animals. They therefor have to have a social structure or they would
&gt;&gt;&gt; spend all their time fighting over everything.

&gt;&gt;Why looky there! You got it. They must develop socialization in the
colony
&gt;&gt;situation in order to survive. The socialization is a by product of
&gt;&gt;necessity for food and shelter. You just don't seem to be able to grasp
that
&gt;&gt;if they all had adequate food and shelter individually, they wouldn't
&gt;&gt;colonize. That should tell you something, but I guess you are too dense.

&gt; But the socilisation is built in already because it is a natural part
&gt; of their make-up. Deprived of it they are the poorer.

"/> No, Frank. Cats adapt. If feral cats have their own food supply and
shelter, they are solitary. Which PROVES they don't NEED to socialize.
They socialize ONLY when they HAVE TO. They adapt.

You *still* haven't produced *any* evidence of a confinement-stress-related
epidemic in the USA!

Since I know you are incapable of grasping this concept, and since you have
not and cannot produce refuting evidence, there's no point in continuing
this discussion with you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having social contact with other cats is not exactly &quot;hanging out with

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The social structure of a cat community is very important.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Only if you *have* a cat community! Cats don't need a community to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;happy. They group around food, shelter and mating, otherwise they're
&gt;mostly
&gt;&gt;&gt;solitary.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Pets cats view *us* as their &quot;community&quot;.

&gt;&gt; No, doesn't work Phil. Sorry but without the cats need to socialise
&gt;&gt; they would not be able to get together.

&gt;That's what you're missing; They don't need to get together - unless they're

Not academic studies. Quite a different level of verification. I am
afraid I am going to have to reject these offerings of yours as proof of
the social nature of the cat. This appears to be quite an enjoyable

&gt;&gt; My cat is indoors to protect it, period. Does she want to go out&gt;sometimes..
&gt;&gt; of course. But she's not going to.

&gt;There is such thing as being overprotective you know.

&gt;&gt;Great logic. OK, when you have a 4 year old kid... you just let him out
&gt;&gt;unsupervised anytime he wants to, afterall... humans don't like being&gt;indoors
&gt;&gt;all the time.

&gt;Thanks to thousands of years of overprotection human children are taking
&gt;longer and longer to be viable in the real world. Intelligent cats do not
&gt;need supervision. Maybe your cat is dumb but none of mine do stuff to make
&gt;me worry. Dumb cats should be kept inside but a cat that shows it does not
&gt;wander in the middle of the street and looks before crossing should be let
&gt;out unless it was raised as an indoor cat.

"/> Our cats have demonstrated intelligence, opening and close cabinet
doors, filedrawers, even answering our speaker phone. But as they have
NEVER been outdoors, I guess it is FINALLY your advise to keep them
inside.

&gt; Hi Joshua,
&gt; Everyone lives in different circumstances and has to decide what is right
&gt;for their cat.
&gt;I live in the suburbs and have a garden so I've always let my cats out when
&gt;they want to , but not at night.
&gt;I dont think you can compare a four year old child with an adult cat. An
&gt;adult cat is safer as they've become street wise.
&gt;Most people in the Uk let their cats out . My friends have built an outside
&gt;contained play area for their cats so they can get fresh air and have some
&gt;fun . For cats who are languishing in rescue centres I think they would just
&gt;like a home whether they can go out or not.

"/> We did much the same screening in our porch. You are right it depends
on many factors, including your location, whether or not it is best to
let your cats out, or not. This is part of what I have been trying to
explain. Where we live, it isn't save out there. When we lived on the
farm as a kid we had barn cats. I don't see as either type of cat as
being happier than the other (indoor or outdoor).

&gt;read on the care of the cat and information on the most popular breeds.
&gt;Not cat behavioralism. Sorry.

&gt;Tracy

"/> They are written by highly respected feline experts. What difference
does it make that they were aimed at a more popular market?

The chapter in David Taylor's book contains the following &quot;Cats are
very social animals, and even if you pet is the only feline in your
house, if it isn't confined it will be part of a community of cats in
the neighbourhood. This cat community organizes itself into an
'association' with a built in hierarchy, rituals and rules that are
laid down in a very precise way. All cats in the association know one
another and are allotted positions in the hierarch.&quot;

And before anyone starts, yes David Taylor clearly leans towards cats
only be kept indoors under special circumstances. The behavioural
chapter, and many others, are clearly illustrated with outdoor cats.

Now the above fits with all I've ever seen written about cats. Cats
are not happy on their own, they can be solitary creatures when
feeding ranges dictate, but they prefer to be very social creatures.

Does that make things any clearer?

"/> I'm sure Bob et al don't need me to defend them but I would like to make
some comments.
I've not got all the posts but obviously Bob feels very strongly that cats
should have outdoor access and that if you can't let your cat out you
shouldn't have one. Rightly or wrongly, this is his belief , just as you
might feel as strongly about a subject such as declawing. (I'm not
comparing the two , thats just an example.) If somone rented a property
where the landlord said the cat had to be declawed, you would say don't get
a cat or live somewhere else.
. On the posts I have , I can't see rude or snotty replies from him. He
states facts he believes are correct . Just because he doesn't agree with
you doesn't mean to say he is calling you a liar.

"/> Most houses are far too small for 20+ cats in the UK, unless they are
very laid back characters. However like many people I have found it
certainly works better to get two kittens at the same time, instead of
having a kitten on it's own when it would naturally still be with it's
mother and litter mates (they stay for quite a bit longer than we give
them) or with an older cat that doesn't want to play.

But 20+? The only people I know with that number of cats are either
breeders (who often keep them in smaller groups) and those who worked in
rescue and couldn't say no to yet another cute kitten.

Mad.

"/> FHow lame... by mentioning declawing in sucha manner you *are* comparing
them, despite your weak claim not to be.

They are completely separate issues. Declawing involves mutilation...painful
and unnecessary. People who get their cats declawed hold the interests of
their furniture and pocketbook above that of the cat. Those who keep cats
indoors hold the interest of the cat's safety over whatever desire to go
outside and explore - but it's still the cats' interests at the heart of the
matter. BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG DIFFERENCE. Keeping a cat indoors isn't painful
(though Bob may *think* it is), it isn't placing the value of a couch above
that of a companion, nor is it *unnecessary* -if I feel the cat's safety is
important enough to make that decision. Many, including most responsible
breeders, catteries and vets (at least here in the US), feel that it is
NECESSARY to keep a cat indoors. I'm not such a hardliner, I just want the
right to make up my own mind.

"/> Hi Alison. While Bob doesn't use rude names to get his point across, he may
as
well. Most of us agree to disagree, and agree that it is the owner's choice
to
keep their pets indoors or let them out, based on their own decisions. Our
big problem (at least 1 of them) is that Bob'n'Frank refuse to see that our
indoor cats
are healthy, happy and content. They accuse of us of abusing them and tell
us
we don't have the right to have a pet, much less keep them indoors. That is
unfair,
and wrong. My cats are NOT suffering from being kept indoors. I live 2
blocks away from a
busy street. I have spotted coyotes in my neighborhood. I work for the SPCA
where I have seen
hundreds of dead and severely injured cats, and thousands of lost and sick
cats come through the
doors.

I believe MY cats should be inside. I don't presume to say ALL cats should
and that owners
who let their cats outside are abusive and don't deserve to have pets. That
is the difference between
we (the inside cat people) and them. We actually believe that everyone is
entitled to their own choice in
this matter. As long as the cats are healthy, happy and content.

Phew.. :)

&gt;fascists are saying &quot;NO, you must let your cat out or don't have a cat&quot;.

"/> Actually, if you really read things you will find that what I want is
for ALL people to recognize what their cat needs.

Now, there can be NO doubt that cats evolved outdoors and have lived
largely outdoor lives until very recently. Cats love the outdoors and
although an artificial environment can be provided for them it can
never match what they get outdoors.

Once you accept that then there really are two choices if you want the
best for your cat. Let them out or do not have cats.

If your area is too dangerous for cat to roam free, and we all know
that some area are, then again you have two choices. Work to improve
your area or vow not to replace your current cats when the eventually
die.

There may be some areas that cannot be improved. These area should
forever be closed to cat owners.

But I think most areas sure as hell can be improved - is people want
them to be. If cat owners don't want to improve their area then they
are not the sort of people who should have cats.

The problem with too many cat owners in the USA is that they appear to
be putting themselves first. They want cats, they do not want to
suffer the anguish of their cat being killed (no matter how low the
risks really are), therefore they will ignore some of the important
things a cat needs - just so they can have their way.

ROFL....

this is getting TOOOO funny. I'm not even going to address the drivel you
once again blessed us with. It jsut ain't worth it....

Bob, you can climb the nearest mountain and shoot fire from your finger tips
preaching YOUR BELIEFS. I disagree. Kapeesh?

I am comfortable in my beliefs. I am confident when I lookinto my cats eyes
that she is living a happy, fulfilling life. Keep it coming if you must - but
you really are wasting alot of time and energy. My cat stays indoors.... my
future cats (yes, in fact I am getting one this weekend -and the breeder has
me agree to keep him indoors in the contract) will be an indoor cat.

Deal with it.

toodles,
Joshua and his happy, loved indoor cat.

&gt;&gt;Yes, but unless I am missing something (I could be, afterall I am NOT reading
&gt;&gt;all this crap) there isn't anyone from the indoor cat camp saying that. The
&gt;&gt;indoor cat people are basically saying &quot;Ok, it's our choice&quot;... the UK Cat
&gt;&gt;fascists are saying &quot;NO, you must let your cat out or don't have a cat&quot;.

&gt; Actually, if you really read things you will find that what I want is
&gt; for ALL people to recognize what their cat needs.

&gt; Now, there can be NO doubt that cats evolved outdoors and have lived
&gt; largely outdoor lives until very recently. Cats love the outdoors and
&gt; although an artificial environment can be provided for them it can
&gt; never match what they get outdoors.

&gt; Once you accept that then there really are two choices if you want the
&gt; best for your cat. Let them out or do not have cats.

&gt; If your area is too dangerous for cat to roam free, and we all know
&gt; that some area are, then again you have two choices. Work to improve
&gt; your area or vow not to replace your current cats when the eventually
&gt; die.

&gt; There may be some areas that cannot be improved. These area should
&gt; forever be closed to cat owners.

&gt; But I think most areas sure as hell can be improved - is people want
&gt; them to be. If cat owners don't want to improve their area then they
&gt; are not the sort of people who should have cats.

&gt; The problem with too many cat owners in the USA is that they appear to
&gt; be putting themselves first. They want cats, they do not want to
&gt; suffer the anguish of their cat being killed (no matter how low the
&gt; risks really are), therefore they will ignore some of the important
&gt; things a cat needs - just so they can have their way.

&gt;&gt;I fully understand them wanting to let their cat outside, and it's their cat
&gt;&gt;so be my guest. I used to have an outdoor cat.. but it was poisoned. I have
&gt;&gt;also seen dozens of dead cats in my life on the road (DOZENSSSS) from being
&gt;&gt;hit by cars to god knows what killed em. Hence I weighed the pros and cons
&gt;&gt;and made my decision regarding MY CAT. I find it insulting to have someone
&gt;&gt;tell me I am cruel because my cat is indoor-only.

&gt; Sorry Josh, but as long as you cannot accept that, no matter how much

&gt;I never said that people who let their pets out are cruel. I said *I*
&gt;believe it's in *MY* pets best
&gt;interest to stay indoors, based on *MY OWN* personal experiences. If others
&gt;choose to keep their
&gt;pets indoors, wonderful. If they choose to let their pets outside and feel
&gt;comfortable with that, then
&gt;that is *THEIR* choice. I also never said my area was safe. I live in a
&gt;fairly quiet neighborhood but I live
&gt;2 blocks away from an EXTREMELY busy road and I know for a fact that coyotes
&gt;have been spotted in
&gt;this area.

"/> Two blocks? What is that in yards? I live about 100 yards from a busy
road. Our own road has heavy traffic at school times as there are two
large schools very close.

Let me take you on a guided tour. Here is a link to a map (you may
want to store the URL to easymap.co.uk because it can come in useful
as all people need to go is give you their house number and their
postcode and you can locate quite closely where they are in the UK.

http://www.easymap.co.uk/map.html?hnn=34&amp;ad=&amp;vtc=&amp;pc=gl4+0le&amp;sm=0&amp;sub...

Anyway, the arrow points to just about where I live. Steroid Road is
the main road. Just opposite the entrance to Bourton Road is a very
large Secondary school (high school) While down on Bisley road are
both an infants school (5 to 8 year olds) and a Junior school (8 to
11). If you find Seventh Avenue, that is where out local shops are
(take-away, butchers, newsagents+post office, general food store and a
bakers/confectionairs) That is the distance I would be happy to see a
5/6 yr old walk if the wanted a bar of chocolate although that would
depend on the time of day of course)

On the corner of Woods Orchard Road is a large filling station with a
busy pub-resturaunt next door.

If you zoom out a couple of steps you see we have a major motorway
quite close and the green patch that is in the triangle between us,
the motorway and Matson is a country park, a large part of which is a
nature conservation area and the home of a lot of wildlife.

We have red foxes, but they of course are not a danger to cats. We
have lots of dogs around - not all well looked after and of course a
lot of other wildlife.

We have major rail lines, quite a bit of distribution warehousing, and
some light industry in the area.

I've live here for 27 years.

Yes I have know cats killed on the road, I've had one cat injured on
the road. But I see many more foxed, rabbits and other animals killed
- one reason we have worked so hard to slow traffic down. Still some
way to go, but the wildlife is worth the effort.

So. how about a few others explaining their area?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Phil,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I wouldn't say cats are solitary but independant. They like to play
&gt;&gt;&gt; together and sleep next to each other but they're just as happy to go off
&gt;&gt;&gt; somewhere on their own or sleep in another room.
&gt;&gt;&gt; We like to think our cats love us for ourselves but I'm sure they would be
&gt;&gt;&gt; just as happy with anyone who fed them and cared for them.
&gt;&gt;&gt; alison

&gt;&gt;But Alison, the point is that Bob and Frank propose socialization with up to
&gt;&gt;20+ cats is necessary to the cats happiness and quote colonies as proof,
&gt;&gt;when actually colonies are not formed from a need of socialization but
&gt;&gt;because of a single source of food and shelter. Your point is perfectly
&gt;&gt;valid. It simply doesn't pertain to the argument at hand.

&gt;Most houses are far too small for 20+ cats in the UK, unless they are
&gt;very laid back characters.

"/> Oh very true. I know one with 5 and that is a squeeze.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;However like many people I have found it
&gt;certainly works better to get two kittens at the same time, instead of
&gt;having a kitten on it's own when it would naturally still be with it's
&gt;mother and litter mates (they stay for quite a bit longer than we give
&gt;them) or with an older cat that doesn't want to play.

&gt;But 20+? The only people I know with that number of cats are either
&gt;breeders (who often keep them in smaller groups) and those who worked in
&gt;rescue and couldn't say no to yet another cute kitten.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Great logic. OK, when you have a 4 year old kid... you just let him out

&gt;&gt; indoors
&gt;&gt;&gt; all the time.

&gt;&gt; Hi Joshua,
&gt;&gt; Everyone lives in different circumstances and has to decide what is right
&gt;&gt; for their cat.
&gt;&gt; I live in the suburbs and have a garden so I've always let my cats out when
&gt;&gt; they want to , but not at night.
&gt;&gt; I dont think you can compare a four year old child with an adult cat. An
&gt;&gt; adult cat is safer as they've become street wise.
&gt;&gt; Most people in the Uk let their cats out . My friends have built an outside
&gt;&gt; contained play area for their cats so they can get fresh air and have some
&gt;&gt; fun . For cats who are languishing in rescue centres I think they would just
&gt;&gt; like a home whether they can go out or not.

&gt;&gt; My cat is indoors to protect it, period. Does she want to go out sometimes..

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Karen,
&gt;&gt; I'm sure Bob et al don't need me to defend them but I would like to make
&gt;&gt; some comments.
&gt;&gt; I've not got all the posts but obviously Bob feels very strongly that
cats
&gt;&gt; should have outdoor access and that if you can't let your cat out you
&gt;&gt; shouldn't have one. Rightly or wrongly, this is his belief , just as
you
&gt;&gt; might feel as strongly about a subject such as declawing. (I'm not
&gt;&gt; comparing the two , thats just an example.) If somone rented a property
&gt;&gt; where the landlord said the cat had to be declawed, you would say don't
&gt; get
&gt;&gt; a cat or live somewhere else.
&gt;&gt; . On the posts I have , I can't see rude or snotty replies from him.
He
&gt;&gt; states facts he believes are correct . Just because he doesn't agree
with
&gt;&gt; you doesn't mean to say he is calling you a liar.

&gt; Aparently you AREN'T getting all the posts. He frequently calls me and
&gt; others LIAR in big capitol letters. He also talks down to us and says
&gt; condescending things. Either that or you are selectively reading what he
&gt; says. Not only that but in general he bashes &quot;Merkins&quot; as he calls us.
&gt; Perhaps you need a new newsserver or go look it up in Deja, but Bob et al
&gt; are constantly saying rude things and calling anyone who tries to say
&gt; different than them liars. Not only that but now Frank is holding himself
up
&gt; to published experts in the field of feline behaviour and saying that
&gt; because he doesn't believe them, they are wrong. How much more riduculous
&gt; can this get?

&gt; Karen

"/>  Hi karen,
I'll check out Deja.
Bob, if you are reading this , dont call people liars , ok!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't take anything this Bob guy says as &quot;real&quot;. I mean this idiot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even thinks that cats are herd/pack animals for goodness sake.

&gt;&gt; Bob stated that wild cats in a colony would have 20 to 50 cats to
interact

&gt;&gt; they need to go outside to socially interact with other cats whether
it's
&gt;&gt; two or twenty.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And once the weather improves you really need to address the root

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob wrote:--
&gt;&gt; You
&gt;&gt;&gt; therefor have to ask yourself &quot;what is wrong with your cat&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Some cats, especially the odd one that does not go out when it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; young enough to have its mother with it, do run scared at first but
&gt;&gt;&gt; they quickly learn there is fun to be had outside.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If your cat really has a problems with going out then you need to
&gt;&gt;&gt; consult a vet with behavioural problem experience.

&gt;&gt; You might find some of Bobs posts extreme or eccentric but do you
really

&gt;&gt;Our pampered pets similarly (IMHO) have all the instincts of wild cats,

Read some other threads, we &quot;indoor only&quot; types are NOT against cats
being outside in enviorments where it is safer for them. We have
stated this among ourselves. When we win the Lotto (dream on) we
intend to move out of the city, to let them out into a big cat proofed
yard (at least). For now, they enjoy going out into our screened in
porch. (we live 3 floors up, we screened it in, partly to keep insects
out, and to make it safer for our cats)

And NO, we are NOT cruel to our cats, we have cats that have Never
enjoyed the outdoors, and prefer to be indoors. I would NEVER bring a
country cat into the city (such would be cruel).

&gt;&gt; I agree with you. My two cats are kept indoors. But they are used to.
&gt;&gt; Sometimes, I leave the door opened and they don't try to get out. Simply,
&gt;&gt; they are not used to and I sincerely think they feel happy anyway.
&gt;&gt; Sometimes, during the summer time, when it's to hot inside, I bring them
&gt;out
&gt;&gt; and after a few minutes, they stay in front of the door asking to get in.
&gt;&gt; Before taking the decision to let them inside or outside, I ask my vet for
&gt;&gt; her opinion. She told me as long as a cat is used to stay inside when he
&gt;is
&gt;&gt; young, it's OK.
&gt;&gt; But if I would adopt one who was trained to get out I would never change
&gt;his
&gt;&gt; habits. It would be cruel....
&gt;&gt; I also travel a lot with my cats (every two weeks) and they are used
&gt;&gt; to......!!!
&gt;&gt; They are really my two best friends.......
&gt;&gt; That was my opinion but I respect yours.

&gt;Well said. Maybe in different parts of the world, in different cities or
&gt;towns, traffic is less, there are less
&gt;wild animals in urban areas, or more well behaved pets who are allowed
&gt;outdoors. Unfortunately this
&gt;does not hold true for where I live. Also, since I work at vet clinic/animal
&gt;shelter I see horrifically injured
&gt;cats and dogs everyday, who were allowed out to roam at will. I am NOT
&gt;saying ALL dogs and cats who are
&gt;allowed outside meet this end. Some pets are clever enough to stick close to
&gt;home, and know how to
&gt;avoid danger. Unfortunately not ALL pets are like this, and I do not want to
&gt;risk finding out if my cats are
&gt;or not.

just ignoring Bob'N'Frank (sounds like this should be a fried chicken
joint). I read their posts still looking for new/useful information--to no
avail. Someday I may find something that is not just the same old rehash of
narrowmindedness or perhaps, if I notice ne'er before seen names, I'll reply
with contridictory data...but for now I find it more pleasurable to ignore
them...maybe they'll go away. :-)

&gt;&gt; expressed my view . That is the point of newsgroups.

&gt;&gt; posts or
&gt;&gt; reply, you do that of your own free will. If you think he is a troll
don't
&gt;&gt; feed him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; might feel as strongly about a subject such as declawing. (I'm not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comparing the two , thats just an example.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; FHow lame... by mentioning declawing in sucha manner you *are*
comparing
&gt;&gt;&gt; them, despite your weak claim not to be.

&gt;&gt; Nonsense . I mention cat declawing as an issue you can understand
.I
&gt;&gt; could have mention wing clipping or ear cropping but that wouldn't have
&gt;&gt; been relevant to a cat ng.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They are completely separate issues. Declawing involves
&gt;&gt; mutilation...painful
&gt;&gt;&gt; and unnecessary. People who get their cats declawed hold the
interests of
&gt;&gt;&gt; their furniture and pocketbook above that of the cat. Those who keep
cats
&gt;&gt;&gt; indoors hold the interest of the cat's safety over whatever desire to
go
&gt;&gt;&gt; outside and explore - but it's still the cats' interests at the heart
of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; matter. BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG DIFFERENCE. Keeping a cat indoors isn't
&gt;&gt; painful
&gt;&gt;&gt; (though Bob may *think* it is), it isn't placing the value of a couch
&gt;&gt; above
&gt;&gt;&gt; that of a companion, nor is it *unnecessary* -if I feel the cat's
safety
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; important enough to make that decision. Many, including most
responsible
&gt;&gt;&gt; breeders, catteries and vets (at least here in the US), feel that it
is
&gt;&gt;&gt; NECESSARY to keep a cat indoors. I'm not such a hardliner, I just
want
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; right to make up my own mind.

&gt;&gt; I agree with everything you say about cat declawing. Fortunately
its
&gt;&gt; banned in the UK
&gt;&gt; Alison

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If somone rented a property
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where the landlord said the cat had to be declawed, you would say
don't
&gt;&gt; get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a cat or live somewhere else.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, a big difference between mutilation and keeping a cat indoors.
&gt;&gt; Come
&gt;&gt;&gt; on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; . On the posts I have , I can't see rude or snotty replies from
him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He's arrogant and forces his beliefs upon others. That's not rude or
&gt;&gt; snotty?

&gt;&gt;&gt; He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; states facts he believes are correct.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again that funny word BELIEVE.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just because he doesn't agree with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you doesn't mean to say he is calling you a liar.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Jsut because we don't agree with him doesn't make us wrong... but it
does
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt; his eyes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob stated that wild cats in a colony would have 20 to 50 cats to
&gt;&gt; interact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with . He is not saying that domestic cats need that many. He is
saying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they need to go outside to socially interact with other cats whether
&gt;&gt; it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; two or twenty.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Whatever.... more psychobabble... The issue he is so adamant about
(and
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; using this cat's socialization issue for) is the indoor/outdoor issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You might find some of Bobs posts extreme or eccentric but do you
&gt;&gt; really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find them offensive?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. But that's just Bob.

&gt; allow a lie to go unchallenged is to add credence to that lie.

&gt; --
&gt; Bob.

&gt; In court, why do they ask if you swear to tell the truth? If you're
&gt; planning on lying, do they really think you'll tell them so?

"/>  Bob,
I'm presuming that you think people are lying because they say their cats
are unhappy indoors? You can't see their cats so you don't know if they're
happy or not. Do you know anyone with indoor cats so that you can see them
and then judge .?
Whats the RSPCA stance on this.? I don't remember our local RSPCA refusing a
home where the cat can't go out.
Terrible things happen to cats in other countries In the far east they get
boiled alive and skinned.Now *that* is cruel. Wouldn't it be better if we
tried to do something about that, instead of wasting time and energy
arguing on this NG.

Ok now Bob I have asked and asked you to please show me in usenet where it
says Top Posting is bad. To date no such response. So I went to Usenets site
and checked around found nothing on posting be it top or bottom, I did find
this however. So unless you can show me the url to follow then perhaps you
should follow the below rules. The Url is
ftp://ftp.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/what-is/part1&lt;there was no part 2&gt;

AN APPROXIMATE DESCRIPTION
--------------------------

Usenet is a world-wide distributed discussion system. It consists of a
set of &quot;newsgroups&quot; with names that are classified hierarchically by
subject. &quot;Articles&quot; or &quot;messages&quot; are &quot;posted&quot; to these newsgroups by
people on computers with the appropriate software -- these articles are
then broadcast to other interconnected computer systems via a wide
variety of networks. Some newsgroups are &quot;moderated&quot;; in these
newsgroups, the articles are first sent to a moderator for approval
before appearing in the newsgroup. Usenet is available on a wide variety
of computer systems and networks, but the bulk of modern Usenet traffic
is transported over either the Internet or UUCP.

WHY IS USENET SO HARD TO DEFINE?
--------------------------------

The first thing to understand about Usenet is that it is widely
misunderstood. Every day on Usenet, the &quot;blind men and the elephant&quot;
phenomenon is evident, in spades. In my opinion, more flame wars
arise because of a lack of understanding of the nature of Usenet than
from any other source. And consider that such flame wars arise, of
necessity, among people who are on Usenet. Imagine, then, how poorly
understood Usenet must be by those outside!

Any essay on the nature of Usenet cannot ignore the erroneous
impressions held by many Usenet users. Therefore, this article will
treat falsehoods first. Keep reading for truth. (Beauty, alas, is
outside the scope of this article.)

WHAT USENET IS NOT
------------------

1. Usenet is not an organization.

No person or group has authority over Usenet as a whole. No one
controls who gets a news feed, which articles are propagated
where, who can post articles, or anything else. There is no
&quot;Usenet Incorporated,&quot; nor is there a &quot;Usenet User's Group.&quot;
You're on your own.

Granted, there are various activities organized by means of Usenet
newsgroups. The newsgroup creation process is one such
activity. But it would be a mistake to equate Usenet with the
organized activities it makes possible. If they were to stop
tomorrow, Usenet would go on without them.

2. Usenet is not a democracy.

Since there is no person or group in charge of Usenet as a whole
-- i.e. there is no Usenet &quot;government&quot; -- it follows that Usenet
cannot be a democracy, autocracy, or any other kind of &quot;-acy.&quot;
(But see &quot;The Camel's Nose?&quot; below.)

3. Usenet is not fair.

After all, who shall decide what's fair? For that matter, if
someone is behaving unfairly, who's going to stop him? Neither
you nor I, that's certain.

4. Usenet is not a right.

Some people misunderstand their local right of &quot;freedom of speech&quot;
to mean that they have a legal right to use others' computers to
say what they wish in whatever way they wish, and the owners of
said computers have no right to stop them.

Those people are wrong. Freedom of speech also means freedom not
to speak. If I choose not to use my computer to aid your speech,
that is my right. Freedom of the press belongs to those who own
one.

5. Usenet is not a public utility.

Some Usenet sites are publicly funded or subsidized. Most of
them, by plain count, are not. There is no government monopoly
on Usenet, and little or no government control.

6. Usenet is not an academic network.

It is no surprise that many Usenet sites are universities,
research labs or other academic institutions. Usenet originated
with a link between two universities, and the exchange of ideas
and information is what such institutions are all about. But the
passage of years has changed Usenet's character. Today, by plain
count, most Usenet sites are commercial entities.

7. Usenet is not an advertising medium.

Because of Usenet's roots in academia, and because Usenet depends
so heavily on cooperation (sometimes among competitors), custom
dictates that advertising be kept to a minimum. It is tolerated
if it is infrequent, informative, and low-hype.

The &quot;comp.newprod&quot; newsgroup is NOT an exception to this rule:
product announcements are screened by a moderator in an attempt to
keep the hype-to-information ratio in check.

If you must engage in flackery for your company, use the &quot;biz&quot;
hierarchy, which is explicitly &quot;advertising-allowed&quot;, and which
(like all of Usenet) is carried only by those sites that want it.

8. Usenet is not the Internet.

The Internet is a wide-ranging network, parts of which are
subsidized by various governments. It carries many kinds of
traffic, of which Usenet is only one. And the Internet is only
one of the various networks carrying Usenet traffic.

9. Usenet is not a UUCP network.

UUCP is a protocol (actually a &quot;protocol suite,&quot; but that's a
technical quibble) for sending data over point-to-point
connections, typically using dialup modems. Sites use UUCP to
carry many kinds of traffic, of which Usenet is only one. And
UUCP is only one of the various transports carrying Usenet
traffic.

10. Usenet is not a United States network.

It is true that Usenet originated in the United States, and the
fastest growth in Usenet sites has been there. Nowadays, however,
Usenet extends worldwide.

The heaviest concentrations of Usenet sites outside the U.S. seem
to be in Canada, Europe, Australia and Japan.

Keep Usenet's worldwide nature in mind when you post articles.
Even those who can read your language may have a culture wildly
different from yours. When your words are read, they might not
mean what you think they mean.

11. Usenet is not a UNIX network.

Don't assume that everyone is using &quot;rn&quot; on a UNIX machine. Among
the systems used to read and post to Usenet are Vaxen running VMS,
IBM mainframes, Amigas, Macintoshes and MS-DOS PCs.

12. Usenet is not an ASCII network.

The A in ASCII stands for &quot;American&quot;. Sites in other countries
often use character sets better suited to their language(s) of
choice; such are typically, though not always, supersets of ASCII.
Even in the United States, ASCII is not universally used: IBM
mainframes use (shudder) EBCDIC. Ignore non-ASCII sites if you
like, but they exist.

13. Usenet is not software.

There are dozens of software packages used at various sites to
transport and read Usenet articles. So no one program or package
can be called &quot;the Usenet software.&quot;

Software designed to support Usenet traffic can be (and is) used
for other kinds of communication, usually without risk of mixing
the two. Such private communication networks are typically kept
distinct from Usenet by the invention of newsgroup names different
from the universally-recognized ones.

Well, enough negativity.

WHAT USENET IS
--------------

Usenet is the set of people who exchange articles tagged with one or more
universally-recognized labels, called &quot;newsgroups&quot; (or &quot;groups&quot; for short).
There is often confusion about the precise set of newsgroups that constitute
Usenet; one commonly accepted definition is that it consists of newsgroups
listed in the periodic &quot;List of Active Newsgroups&quot; postings which appear
regularly in news.lists.misc and other newsgroups. A broader definition of
Usenet would include the newsgroups listed in the article &quot;Alternative
Newsgroup Hierarchies&quot; (frequently posted to news.lists.misc). An even
broader definition includes even newsgroups that are restricted to specific
geographic regions or organizations. Each Usenet site makes its own
decisions about the set of groups available to its users; this set differs
from site to site.

(Note that the correct term is &quot;newsgroups&quot;; they are not called areas,
bases, boards, bboards, conferences, round tables, SIGs, echoes, rooms or
usergroups! Nor, as noted above, are they part of the Internet, though
they may reach your site over it. Furthermore, the people who run the
news systems are called news administrators, not sysops. If you want to
be understood, be accurate.)

DIVERSITY
---------

If the above definition of Usenet sounds vague, that's because it is.

It is almost impossible to generalize over all Usenet sites in any
non-trivial way. Usenet encompasses government agencies, large
universities, high schools, businesses of all sizes, home computers of
all descriptions, etc, etc.

(In response to the above paragraphs, it has been written that there
is nothing vague about a network that carries megabytes of traffic per
day. I agree. But at the fringes of Usenet, traffic is not so

&gt;Ok, I really have a problem with this. This &quot;Bob&quot; doesn't snip the post (on
&gt;purpose no doubt, since he complains about it all the time himself), and
&gt;then calls someone who complains about a 2 word comment put at the end of an
&gt;unsnipped post lazy (who in fact states he is handicapped as said above).
&gt;This is a new low for Bob, especially being since he has made this very

a charity that tries to keep animals

(and I brought that home myself)
my cats have not had a sick day since I adopted them. They have plush,
healthy coats, bright eyes and
active, energetic personalities. They are both very friendly (although Cobee
is a lap fungus, and Ally prefers
not to be picked up) and happy. Bob'n'Frank can bleat all they want, but I

"/> Hi Alison. I work for the BCSPCA in British Columbia, Canada. The adoption
screening
prefers to know that cats are going into homes where they will be kept
indoors. They feel
that a cat has a better chance of living a long, safe life in our busy city
if not exposed to the
dangers outdoors.

That being said, they don't NOT adopt to people who may let their cats
outdoors. They just prefer
it if the cats were kept indoors. Surely the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals would not
condone keeping cats indoors if they felt it was a cruel thing to do. It
would go against everything
the Society stands for.

&gt;Whats the RSPCA stance on this.? I don't remember our local RSPCA refusing a

"/> They will. It depends on the cat and the home. They do not like to put
cats in homes that are in very dangerous areas because, if you think
about it, there is no way to guarantee that a cat can't get out -
being the world's greatest escapologist :)

They, and Cats Protection, have a strong preference for homes where
the cat can go out, at least at some point during the day. There are
however some cats who, for reason of illness, old age or disability,
cannot really go out. My wife's; mother's, second husband (now ex) has
a heart condition so he only goes out when one of his carers is
available. The local CPL got him a lovely black and white moggie that
was effectively blind (actually the muscles in the eye were damaged by
an infection so the eyes don't move properly. Woppa (so called because
he was so small) cannot go out and so was the ideal cat for John and
John's was the ideal home for Woppa. Even so, Woppa has got out on
several occasions.

Spacial cases like that are fine. But to take a health cat and lock it
indoors is cruel, there really is no getting away from that. The law
would not allow is to do it with more exotic creatures but because the
cats was already part of the British way of life they were never
included when laws were drafted. That said, they are not actually
excluded so it may happen one day.

Americans consider it right to deprive cats of an outdoor life it will
go on, and on, and on. Where will it end? Every cat in North America

If an animal dies for to feed us then it would be a crying same to
waste its skin so I accept leather, even fur is the animal was not

&gt;I've *never* got the impression that Bob doesn't get his cats neutered,
&gt;and calling him a 'backyard breeder' seems rather beyond the pale.

"/> I will explain, for anyone new.

I do not believe that it is good for a cat to be neutered until it is
sexually mature. As most cats are born around here (UK) in the March
to May period I would normally advise an owner that, if they do not
wish their female cat to have kittens, then the ideal time to neuter
them is the December of their first year.

Now, the fist time I suggested this, I was instantly flamed. You see
there seems to be a movement that finds it acceptable to neuter a cat
at a very young age. I (and most vets in the UK and Europe by the way)
do not subscribe to that belief because I feel that nature intend the
cat to reach adulthood and that the hormones related in that maturity
are important to the final stages of the cats development.

Some people, and a number of web sites, will claim that the risks of
certain diseases is increased if this maturity is allowed. True, there
are a handful of problems that are reduced - but as the 'risk' of
those is quite small. Even 10 times very small is still very small.

My vets (large animal hospital) have a mix of vets from just out of
collage to 35 years experience. They do not neuter under 6 months
unless there are medical reasons.

Males are different. Some people believe there are really three types
of cats. Female, Intact male and Neutered male. This fits with most
other animals. I, and others, like intact males, there are different.
Until fairly recently a lot of vets recommended that a male was left
to around 18 months anyway because there was a higher incidence of
urinary track problems in males neutered earlier. Several studies now
say differently - for me the jury is still out. If, like most cats I
know, the intact male has access to the outside during the day it is
true they will roam further and fight more - but that is part of the
nature of a cat. If a male cat was constantly losing fights, and I've
see it quite often, then that may be the right time to neuter - but at
the end of the day it is up to the owner.

Breeding cats should only be undertaken by someone who is VERY sure
they know what they are letting themselves in for. If is really hard
work, and very expensive. I do not keep pedigree cats, I do not even
like many pedigree cats - I feel sorry for them, created by the vanity
of man, at a disadvantage in health terms - I would much rather have a
moggie. If someone wants to breed from their cat then as far as I'm
concerned there are two golden rules - 1. Makes absolutely sure you
have more than enough good homes arrange BEFORE you even think of
allowing your cat to get pregnant. 2. Make absolutely, 101% sure, you
follow rule 1.

There are people out there for whom a kitten is the only animal they
want (adopting a grown cat from a shelter is not for them, at least
not first time round) and most of them would rather have a kitten from
someone they know, and where they can see the mother with the kittens.

Last year (April 2000) Tammy gave birth to 4 kittens - we had homes
lined up for 8 (or 9 if you count that we wanted to keep one). This
year Tammy has been neutered and we will not allow Tiggy to breed.
Next year, far to early to say.

Now. If in American eyes that makes me a back-yard breeder then fine,
I'll hold my head up high and wear the crown. However, I think there
is a lot of difference between those back-yard breeders who churn out
kittens for profit year after year until their cats are exhausted -
and someone who does it purely for the love and to help spread cat
ownership to new people.

The claim was made, ad nauseum, that ANY breeding deprives another cat
of a home and therefore results in its death. I disproved this over
and over again but it appears that some of the regulars on alt.cats
have a problem with logic. There are two arguments, both of which
produce the same thing. First: If cats are only bred for arranged
homes, and if those homes would not have taken another cat, then no
potential home has been lost - in fact the reverse because I'm sure
next time they are looking for a cat they will at least consider a cat
from a shelter. Second: As nearly all the UK's shelters are no-kill[1]
then it follows that no cat is deprived of life. I've been careful
never to say that this applies in the USA (although I think it could
if people changed their attitudes).

Right, that covers it. Oh, one last argument that developed. That the
population explosion was affected by there being unneutered males
roaming. The argument against that logic is that it is the female that
has the kittens, 10 unneutered females 1 unneutered male - result 10
litters of kittens. On the other hand 1 unneutered female and any
number of unneutered males will only result in 1 litter of kittens.
That is why feral programmes in Europe target the females because it
is money better spent.

Hope this helps

The easiest way to deal with people like that is to either force them out

My only problem with this topic is that a few &quot;pro-outside&quot; folks believe
that anyone who
keeps their cat(s) inside are cruel and don't deserve cats. :(

Cats Protection, who tell me that they would NEVER allow someone who

Mr Brenchley has defended the breeding and non-neutering of moggies at

threads. I believe one of them was called &quot;Cute kitty looking for

an absurd comparison. Living in a house or apartment is NOT like being in a
cage. It is illogical to make that particular comparison. At least we can
agree to disagree, but that particular comparison is really moot. It is as
silly as saying you stick your cats outside and don't care for them. It
makes me wonder if the indoor cats you've seen are the ones (and I've seen
them too and consider it cruel) who are largely ignored and sometimes
partitioned off to various rooms. They've become obese and inactive. This is
wrong, totally and undeniably. However, I can also say that this is not how
all indoor cats live. I'll be interested to see if this is what you see that
makes you believe it cruel or brings you to the 4 x 4 cage comparison.

Susan,

I agree with what you say that some people think you are cruel if you keep
you cats indoors. I seem to spend most of my time having to justify why I
keep my cats indoors, and for everyone out there I want you to know it is
not that I am being cruel. I had Penny from a kitten and although I tried
many times to take her outside she was just too scared and the vet said it
was being MORE cruel to force her outside. Daffy then came along as a
rescued cat and she had been so badly abused she did not want to go out,
probably of fear that she would be kicked again! So because of these
circumstances I decided that my cats were meant to be indoors and thus I
have catered for their outside needs inside eg a climbing frame that reaches
from floor to ceiling etc. My cats are very content and they do go outside
into the backgarden accompanied so that they can get fresh air but feel safe
and secure. I also feel after being a cat owner for a while now that even
if my cats were not scared of the big bad world outside I would not let them
into it, ask yourselves this question would you let a dog roam the streets
unaccompanied to get hurt and into trouble, well I bet the answer is No, so
why should it be different for cats(from what I have seen and heard they are
no more streetwise!)

&gt;&gt; live in areas humans consider too dangerous. It is not an acceptable
&gt;&gt; alternative to keep them in all the time - that is cruel.

a heck of a lot easier for me to forgo the litter box, the cat condos,
harness training, etc. and kick my three cats out all day to roam loose. I
think most people who restrict their cat's roaming in the great outdoors
firmly believe that they are doing so for the cat - not themselves. I know
I do, and I think I'm better qualified to determine my own motives for doing
so than some stranger on a newsgroup.

the reason dogs are not allowed to roam is not for the safety of the dog.
Dogs who roam tend to eventually group with other dogs, and they begin being
destructive. It was quite an eye opening experience to live near a sheep
farm for 17 years and see tame as can be house pets who weren't being
contained band up and destroy both sheep and rabbits of a local farmer.

Roaming dogs are also a hazard to small children and family pets.

&gt;&gt; I think that would probably be true of most Brits. Keeping cats indoors
&gt;&gt; here is generally considered to be very cruel.

&gt;Most Americans consider it cruel to expose cats to being hit by cars, being
&gt;injured in cat fights, catching infections such as feline leukemia virus and
&gt;feline immunodeficiency virus (Feline &quot;AIDS&quot;), being stolen and tortured,
&gt;territorial disputes, threats from other animals, people, environmental
&gt;noises which cause panic, and situations which generate pure fear and
&gt;stress.

&gt;But that's in a country
&gt;&gt; where it's safe for cats to have indoor/outdoor lives.

&gt;We seem to have either different interpretations of &quot;safe&quot; or value our cats
&gt;much differently..

&gt;I know how you feel. I would very much like to see Brits stop having cats
&gt;if they can't provide safe protected lives for their cats. I guess we both
&gt;have to bite the bullet because neither of us will ever see our wishes come
&gt;true.

&gt;&gt; because having seen a lot of indoor cats and having spent my entire life
&gt;&gt; with indoor/outdoor cats I have absolutely no doubt that indoor cats
&gt;&gt; live half-lives.

&gt;You have not seen my cats or the millions of cats that are living happily
&gt;and safely in protected environments. I have had both, indoor and
&gt;indoor/outdoor cats as well. The only difference between the two is that my
&gt;indoor/protected cats are still alive. I have absolutely no doubt that my
&gt;indoor/protected outdoor cats have a full life. If they are unhappy, they
&gt;sure are doing a great job of fooling me, my vet and everyone else who knows
&gt;them. I would think if there was any adverse effects of indoor/protected
&gt;outdoor life, after ~20 years, some kind of evidence would be detectable.
&gt;There is none.

&gt;That this is all most American owners can offer is the
&gt;&gt; sad part of this, and I know that most of you do everything you can to
&gt;&gt; provide full and entertaining lives for your cats.

&gt;Sad for whom? Surely not my cats. However, I understand providing full and
&gt;entertaining lives for our cats takes a bit of effort - a tad more than
&gt;swinging open a door - Oh, I forgot, many Brits don't even do that, they
&gt;have cat flaps - and no litter boxes....

a soft toy, not a child. Animals NEED (get that Phil, NEED) to be
given as natural an environment as possible to avoid stress. Keeping
them in MAY be protecting them from some things, and nobody is saying
that cats should be thrown out onto a multi lane highway. However
keeping them in not a fair option - it is a very selfish option.

&gt;and all of you didn't have cats, what would happen to all the cats?

&gt;But I have a more realistic, burning question: As stated by your fellow

&gt;are kittens; your cats eliminate outdoors. Here's my burning question: If
&gt;you don't *see* your cats eliminate, how do you know when your cats have a
&gt;urinary tract disorder or obstruction? Urinary tract obstruction can be
&gt;*fatal* for a male cat who doesn't urinate for more than 24-36 hours. Male
&gt;cats that can't urinate can *die* from acute renal failure and/or severe
&gt;damage to the urinary bladder.

"/> Could it be that with better feeding practice we have less problems.
Added to which generally later neutering and a less stressful
lifestyle, which comes from going out, there are far less cases to
worry about. Added to this our level of care is generally higher, I
believe animal owners in the UK have better access to vet services,
especially if they are on low income.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

future for animals is to be lock up in houses for the rest of their
lives - it is not acceptable to treat animals like that.

&gt; sometime (especially Cayce :) I like your style!

"/> Hi,

Amazing how easily I let my mouth work before my brain has had a chance to
register when I'm getting ticked off :)

Cayce is a four year old seal point siamese who's owner put her in the local
kennels and then decided that they didn't want her back. I know the kennel
owners quite well and they know I'm a sucker .... end result was yet another
cat (with free boarding for life when needed). I don't know much about her
background beyond knowing that she was a single cat. She's ok with our dogs
but absolutely detests other cats, point blank refuses to integrate herself
into the household as a whole and consequently lives in my treatment rooms.
She also has absolutely no desire to go outside beyond having the odd nibble
of grass. In the two years we've had her, I don't think she's bothered to
haul her fat butt further than a few metres from her window and she seems to
spend her life draping her fat tum over my computer keyboard or lying on top
of the scanner when she wants a change of scenery (this involves her moving
at least 18&quot;)...... her nose is currently hovering over the keyboard as I
type.

After eating, her favourite recreational pursuits are to annoy the hell out
of me; cuddle my patients; and, when she feels that she isn't getting enough
attention, she pops off and rips the hell out of any paperwork I've left
lying around.

I reckon she's as irritatingly normal as the other cats .... but I'm just a
cat owner, so what do I know? :)

&gt;&gt;cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated custom.

&gt;&gt;However, until someone comes up with a better way
&gt;&gt;&gt; than simply euthanising all those who can't find suitable
indoor/outdoor
&gt;&gt;&gt; homes, I understand why this goes on.

&gt;&gt;Apparently, neither of us thinks the other should have cats. If all of
us,
&gt;&gt;and all of you didn't have cats, what would happen to all the cats?

&gt;&gt;But I have a more realistic, burning question: As stated by your fellow
&gt;&gt;countrymen, most Brits don't have litterboxes unless the cat is ill or
they
&gt;&gt;are kittens; your cats eliminate outdoors. Here's my burning question:
If
&gt;&gt;you don't *see* your cats eliminate, how do you know when your cats have
a
&gt;&gt;urinary tract disorder or obstruction? Urinary tract obstruction can be
&gt;&gt;*fatal* for a male cat who doesn't urinate for more than 24-36 hours.
Male
&gt;&gt;cats that can't urinate can *die* from acute renal failure and/or severe
&gt;&gt;damage to the urinary bladder.

&gt;&gt;This is another reason why I'd like to see Brits put the health and
safety
&gt;&gt;of their cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated
custom.

&gt; This looks like the beginning of a transatlantic flame war. OK, we
&gt; know you saved our sorry limey asses in World Wars I and II and will
&gt; no doubt be called upon to do the same in World War III :-)

&gt; wonder how many early signs of disease have gone unobserved as a

"/> When I had free-roaming cats (years ago when it was safe to let cats out
loose), one of my biggest worries was not being able to observe elimination.
Not only for urethral obstruction, and/or constipation and/or obstipation
(which can lead to megacolon and subsequent subtotal colectomy), I was also
worried about not seeing *blood* which can be an indicator of internal
hemorrhage possibly caused by a gastrointestinal foreign object - or a
linear foreign body such as a string tangled in, and pleating the intestines
and cutting through the intestinal wall. Cats love string. I was also
worried about not detecting discolored urine (hemoglobinuria) which is an
indicator of very serious problems. So my decision to keep my cats in a
protected environment is not only based on my peace of mind, but moreso on
the health and welfare of my cats where I can catch early symptoms.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My only problem with this topic is that a few &quot;pro-outside&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cruel and don't deserve cats. :(

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that would probably be true of most Brits. Keeping cats
indoors
&gt;&gt;&gt; here is generally considered to be very cruel.

&gt;&gt;Most Americans consider it cruel to expose cats to being hit by cars,
being
&gt;&gt;injured in cat fights, catching infections such as feline leukemia virus
and
&gt;&gt;feline immunodeficiency virus (Feline &quot;AIDS&quot;), being stolen and tortured,
&gt;&gt;territorial disputes, threats from other animals, people, environmental
&gt;&gt;noises which cause panic, and situations which generate pure fear and
&gt;&gt;stress.

&gt;&gt;But that's in a country
&gt;&gt;&gt; where it's safe for cats to have indoor/outdoor lives.

&gt;&gt;We seem to have either different interpretations of &quot;safe&quot; or value our
cats
&gt;&gt;much differently..

&gt;&gt;Having spent a
&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of time in the US I'm well aware of the very different dangers that
&gt;&gt;&gt; North American cats face, so I do understand why so many of them are
&gt;&gt;&gt; kept indoors.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Having said that I have to admit that if there was a way of doing it
&gt;&gt;&gt; without having millions of healthy cats euthanised, I'd very much like
&gt;&gt;&gt; to see North Americans stop having cats at all if they can't go outside

&gt;&gt;I know how you feel. I would very much like to see Brits stop having
cats
&gt;&gt;if they can't provide safe protected lives for their cats. I guess we
both
&gt;&gt;have to bite the bullet because neither of us will ever see our wishes
come
&gt;&gt;true.

&gt;&gt;&gt; because having seen a lot of indoor cats and having spent my entire
life
&gt;&gt;&gt; with indoor/outdoor cats I have absolutely no doubt that indoor cats
&gt;&gt;&gt; live half-lives.

&gt;&gt;You have not seen my cats or the millions of cats that are living happily
&gt;&gt;and safely in protected environments. I have had both, indoor and
&gt;&gt;indoor/outdoor cats as well. The only difference between the two is that
my
&gt;&gt;indoor/protected cats are still alive. I have absolutely no doubt that
my
&gt;&gt;indoor/protected outdoor cats have a full life. If they are unhappy,
they
&gt;&gt;sure are doing a great job of fooling me, my vet and everyone else who
knows
&gt;&gt;them. I would think if there was any adverse effects of indoor/protected
&gt;&gt;outdoor life, after ~20 years, some kind of evidence would be detectable.
&gt;&gt;There is none.

&gt;&gt;That this is all most American owners can offer is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sad part of this, and I know that most of you do everything you can to
&gt;&gt;&gt; provide full and entertaining lives for your cats.

&gt;&gt;Sad for whom? Surely not my cats. However, I understand providing full
and
&gt;&gt;entertaining lives for our cats takes a bit of effort - a tad more than
&gt;&gt;swinging open a door - Oh, I forgot, many Brits don't even do that, they
&gt;&gt;have cat flaps - and no litter boxes....

&gt;&gt;In an ideal world,
&gt;&gt;&gt; though, I wish that there was a humane way for you to put the needs of
&gt;&gt;&gt; your cats above your wish to own them, and for the practise of keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor cats to cease.

&gt;&gt;In an ideal world, I'd like to see Brits put the health and safety of
their
&gt;&gt;cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated custom.

Okay mn fair point about the dogs, but in my case my dog who is afraid of
children would be far worse off if she was to roam! plus there are not too
many sheep in my area! but point is well taken honest!

There seems to be less debate about inside V outside and more in Americans V
British!!!
I am British ie I was born in England but most of my family are Irish
American. I really don't think it is an issue of who has better veterinary
care etc it is the welfare of the cat. I had no choice to keep my cats
indoors, but as I have seen all the advantages my cats have by being indoors
I would not change it, even if I could. I often pick up my local paper to
hear that another cat has been tortured by KIDS having fun!!!! or that they
have been shot by air rifles. So the question is am I really being Cruel?!
It is sad to say in this modern day that it is just not safe no matter where
you live to let your cats roam, by all means let them out into the
backgarden(supervised ) or build them an outside play pen, so that they can
enjoy the benefits of the outside in safety. If your cat is catered for eg
plenty of climbing equipment in the home and an always clean litter tray ( I
had imported from the States a littermaid, their great!) then I don't see
what it is missing from being outside apart from cuts, scratches, broken
limbs etc etc.
But remember this is only my point of view , remember it is a debate not an
attack on Nationalities!

&gt; the reason dogs are not allowed to roam is not for the safety of the dog.

Bob,

The catered bit was only an example, obviously my cats need more than a
climbing frame or a clean loo!
Also I don't live in such unusual place, Hertfordshire to be exact and these
things do happen maybe not everyday but often enough.

Look this is my view and my cats seem (and I can only say seem because I
have not had an indepth conversation with them on this subject ) happy
living inside and going out everyday for playtime!

At the end of the day we can only do what we think is right for our cats and
hope that we are making the right decision.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I, for one, think that if a cat is loved, healthy, happy and the owner
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; caring for it to the best of his/her ability - what the heck difference
&gt; does
&gt;&gt;&gt; it make at the end of the day?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Morag (speaking as one who is getting a tad cheesed off with the
&gt; bickering
&gt;&gt;&gt; and who, for the record, has 10 cats all of whom are either
&gt; neutered/spayed,
&gt;&gt;&gt; all are inside/outdoor cats (apart from Cayce who refuses to move her
&gt; fat
&gt;&gt;&gt; butt), are fed a wet/dry diet and over the years, the life expectancy of
&gt;&gt;&gt; said cats is 16 years.)

&gt;&gt; Morag, you truly have a GOOD point. I'd like to hear about those cats
&gt;&gt; sometime (especially Cayce :) I like your style!

&gt; Hi,

&gt; Amazing how easily I let my mouth work before my brain has had a chance to
&gt; register when I'm getting ticked off :)

&gt; Cayce is a four year old seal point siamese who's owner put her in the local
&gt; kennels and then decided that they didn't want her back. I know the kennel
&gt; owners quite well and they know I'm a sucker .... end result was yet another
&gt; cat (with free boarding for life when needed). I don't know much about her
&gt; background beyond knowing that she was a single cat. She's ok with our dogs
&gt; but absolutely detests other cats, point blank refuses to integrate herself
&gt; into the household as a whole and consequently lives in my treatment rooms.
&gt; She also has absolutely no desire to go outside beyond having the odd nibble
&gt; of grass. In the two years we've had her, I don't think she's bothered to
&gt; haul her fat butt further than a few metres from her window and she seems to
&gt; spend her life draping her fat tum over my computer keyboard or lying on top
&gt; of the scanner when she wants a change of scenery (this involves her moving
&gt; at least 18&quot;)...... her nose is currently hovering over the keyboard as I
&gt; type.

&gt; After eating, her favourite recreational pursuits are to annoy the hell out
&gt; of me; cuddle my patients; and, when she feels that she isn't getting enough
&gt; attention, she pops off and rips the hell out of any paperwork I've left
&gt; lying around.

&gt; I reckon she's as irritatingly normal as the other cats .... but I'm just a
&gt; cat owner, so what do I know? :)

&gt; Morag

"/> LOL! She sounds a real character all right! Are you a people doctor? She's
good therapy huh.

&gt;&gt; That this is all most American owners can offer is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sad part of this, and I know that most of you do everything you can to
&gt;&gt;&gt; provide full and entertaining lives for your cats.

&gt;&gt; Sad for whom? Surely not my cats. However, I understand providing full and
&gt;&gt; entertaining lives for our cats takes a bit of effort - a tad more than
&gt;&gt; swinging open a door - Oh, I forgot, many Brits don't even do that, they
&gt;&gt; have cat flaps - and no litter boxes....

&gt;&gt; In an ideal world,
&gt;&gt;&gt; though, I wish that there was a humane way for you to put the needs of
&gt;&gt;&gt; your cats above your wish to own them, and for the practise of keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor cats to cease.

&gt;&gt; In an ideal world, I'd like to see Brits put the health and safety of their
&gt;&gt; cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated custom.

&gt;&gt; However, until someone comes up with a better way
&gt;&gt;&gt; than simply euthanising all those who can't find suitable indoor/outdoor
&gt;&gt;&gt; homes, I understand why this goes on.

&gt;&gt; Apparently, neither of us thinks the other should have cats. If all of us,
&gt;&gt; and all of you didn't have cats, what would happen to all the cats?

&gt;&gt; But I have a more realistic, burning question: As stated by your fellow
&gt;&gt; countrymen, most Brits don't have litterboxes unless the cat is ill or they
&gt;&gt; are kittens; your cats eliminate outdoors. Here's my burning question: If
&gt;&gt; you don't *see* your cats eliminate, how do you know when your cats have a
&gt;&gt; urinary tract disorder or obstruction? Urinary tract obstruction can be
&gt;&gt; *fatal* for a male cat who doesn't urinate for more than 24-36 hours. Male
&gt;&gt; cats that can't urinate can *die* from acute renal failure and/or severe
&gt;&gt; damage to the urinary bladder.

&gt;&gt; This is another reason why I'd like to see Brits put the health and safety
&gt;&gt; of their cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated custom.

&gt; This looks like the beginning of a transatlantic flame war. OK, we
&gt; know you saved our sorry limey asses in World Wars I and II and will
&gt; no doubt be called upon to do the same in World War III :-)

&gt; Joking apart though, there are many cat owners in the UK whose cats
&gt; are strictly indoor. My three have never gone out - where would they
&gt; go in Central London? Your point about litterboxes is well taken: I
&gt; wonder how many early signs of disease have gone unobserved as a
&gt; result. The depletion of Fuller's Earth reserves suggests that cat
&gt; litter usage is expanding, unless someone has found an innovative use
&gt; for it.

&gt; Brits are known throughout Europe as animal lovers. We are less
&gt; kindly inclined towards our children. That's why there's a Royal
&gt; Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) but only a
&gt; National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

"/> Watch, now Bob will call you odd. Or worse. As he has any of his countrymen

Just remember, Jeanne, that &quot;thinking&quot; is not something that Bob and Frank
do, or can accept when it comes to &quot;your&quot; or &quot;my&quot; cats. It has to be done
their way, or we are cruel and shouldn't own cats and ... well, I don't

&gt; Bob,

&gt; The catered bit was only an example, obviously my cats need more than a
&gt; climbing frame or a clean loo!
&gt; Also I don't live in such unusual place, Hertfordshire to be exact and
these
&gt; things do happen maybe not everyday but often enough.

&gt; Look this is my view and my cats seem (and I can only say seem because I
&gt; have not had an indepth conversation with them on this subject ) happy
&gt; living inside and going out everyday for playtime!

&gt; At the end of the day we can only do what we think is right for our cats
and
&gt; hope that we are making the right decision.

&gt;&gt; You are obviously living an a vary unusual part of the UK if what you

&gt;&gt;&gt;It is sad to say in this modern day that it is just not safe no matter
&gt; where
&gt;&gt;&gt;you live to let your cats roam, by all means let them out into the
&gt;&gt;&gt;backgarden(supervised ) or build them an outside play pen, so that they
&gt; can
&gt;&gt;&gt;enjoy the benefits of the outside in safety.

&gt;&gt; An outdoor cage is better than an indoor one, but it is still not
&gt;&gt; perfect.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If your cat is catered for eg
&gt;&gt;&gt;plenty of climbing equipment in the home and an always clean litter
tray
&gt; ( I
&gt;&gt;&gt;had imported from the States a littermaid, their great!) then I don't
see
&gt;&gt;&gt;what it is missing from being outside apart from cuts, scratches,
broken
&gt;&gt;&gt;limbs etc etc.

&gt;&gt; Oh they are missing one hell of a lot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But remember this is only my point of view , remember it is a debate
not

&gt;Outdoor cats on the street, or even in the country, are faced every day with

&gt;environmental noises which cause panic, and situations which generate pure
&gt;fear and stress. Indoor cats generally live longer, healthier and happier
&gt;lives than outdoor cats. That's how. Got it this time????

"/> No. Territorial disputes, when they occur, are a natural part of a
cats existence, as are other animals and noise. Provided a cat is
introduced to the outside world at a young enough age they take
everything in their stride because it is part of their nature to do
so.

they chose to commit a violent crime. They should be locked up, and
not allowed to be made &quot;trustees&quot; where they have access to tool
rooms, office duties, etc. There are plenty of pot smokers, etc. in
prison (the furthest thing from a violent criminal) who, again in my
opinion, would be a much better choice for trustee duty.

Since this conversation has gotten a bit off topic, I'll now say this
about cats, and prisons......

On the PBS channel a while back we watched a really fantastic special
about cats, and in one part, somewhere in the state of California they
are bringing shelter cats into a prison, and the inmates who
volunteered for the project are each issued a cat for a couple of
hours, to bathe it, brush it, clean it's ears, and anything else the
cat may require to make it a better candidate for adoption. The
inmates really seemed to like it, as well as the cats, and apparently
the adoption rate has increased for that shelter.

experience the natural world they belong to or to use many of the senses
and instincts they were born with. You only have to take the time to
seriously observe a cat in the outside world, to watch it communing with
nature and interracting with the rest of the natural world, to see a
whole new set of behavioural patterns come into play. The domestic
moggie walks through the cat flap and a tiger emerges on the outside.

A few years ago a British team of behaviourists attached a camera to a
cat's collar before it left its home. They spent weeks following the
cat as best they could and analysing the footage that it brought back
each evening. The resulting film was fascinating and some of what
emerged amazed even those experienced naturalists who thought they knew
the cat. It gave new insight into the true nature of what we believe to
be a domesticated animal.

This is a wild animal that kids us into giving it shelter, and a cat
that doesn't have the chance to be what it truly is doesn't live a full
life any more than I would if I spent my entire life inside.

"/> No, it's simply evident that you haven't the faintest idea what the UK
is like or what dangers are and are not present. It's also a
well-understood fact that you are congenitally incapable of ever
acknowledging that there are people whose knowledge and experience
exceed yours in some things. You have great knowledge is some areas
Phil, but this isn't one of them.

As for your most peculiar idea that the British don't use litterboxes,
surely you don't believe what the Bob/Frank/Adrian/Sally/Jen entity
says? I thought better of you than that. I have known very, very few
British cat owners who don't have litterboxes. The vast majority keep
their cats indoors at night and have litterboxes for them to use whilst
indoors. Even those who don't keep their cats inside at night have
litterboxes for when the cat chooses to be indoors.

One of our cats always comes back indoors to use a litterbox rather than
go outside, whatever the weather. Another couple prefer to come indoors
when it's raining rather than dig around in wet earth. We have eight
litterboxes around our house.

You need to grow up Phil. Your vision is black and white. It's your
way or no way, and when you don't get your own way you stamp and scream.
You have no concept of the meaning of &quot;moderation&quot; and don't seem to
realise that if you preach, patronise and abuse people they won't listen
to you. You are not the world's authority on cats, although you give
anyone reading your posts cause to think that is what you believe. That
you spout forth about things about which you know little is a pity.
That some of what you say, as in this instance, is based on complete
ignorance is a shame, because a great deal of what you post is very
valuable information. That you are unable to express your disagreement
without being civil is also a great shame, because it shows immaturity
and detracts from the value of your other contributions.

You need to learn to listen and learn as well as teach, but most of all
you need to learn when to say nothing instead of regurgitating the same
old prejudices as if by rote.

they train puppies into seeing eye dogs. It was absolutely amazing the
response which it garners and the prisoners response to it. We're talking
something like two years training one dog. Some have even talked about how
they have transferred the ideas to their own children. How you cannot set
them up for failure, which is evidentally the prime law in training the dog.
They spend almost every waking moment with these dogs caring for them,
cleaning them and training them. It was fascinating. Here in my state there
is a new program called HEART, Humane Education for At-Risk Teens which is
similar to the cat program you mentioned (except they use dogs) and learn to
groom and train them to make them more adoptable. Some great ideas I think.

car or know what's poisonous to them, or know where is dangerous - like

have unlimited access to the outdoors - complete with trees to climb, grass
to roll around and nibble on, butterflies to chase. As much of a shock as

Your problem is that your sad devotion to an outdated custom (and that's all

who are indoors now stalk things, stalk each other, play, they rest a lot,
groom a lot. This is what I am telling you folks, they act the same, they
appear to derive the same satisfaction from playing with their cat dancer,
climbing their furniture, chasing each other at top speed around the place,
play with their mousies and balls as the cats I grew up with did playing in

extraordinary refusal to acknowledge that not everywhere is like the US

that are safe for cats to go outside. It is your blanket demand that
all cats must be kept indoors wherever they live that I dispute, because
it's ludicrous. You insist that because your country is the way it is
our countries must be to, and you have the staggering arrogance to tell
us that, when our countries are so different that we treat our cats
differently, we are irresponsible owners.

"/> I say Free-roam or nothing? Really? That you say that proves that you
don't read the posts of the people you're preaching at. Here are just a
few things I've posted to the threads you've been involved in - I can
provide dates and times of posting if you wish:

- I do not criticise those who don't allow their cats outside
if their environment is too dangerous.

- I'm not telling you that you must let your cats outside if
it's too dangerous to do so where you live,

- While I understand why some people decide to keep their cats
inside, I believe it's a far from ideal life for a cat and
would hope never to be in a situation where it might be
necessary to keep my own cats inside. I would certainly never
move to a home where my cats wouldn't be safe outside during
the day.

- I'd certainly never suggest that any cat should be made to go
outside if it doesn't want to, but having observed indoor/outdoor
cats in their natural environment my whole life I just wish that
everyone lived in circumstances that made it feasible to give
their cat(s) the choice.

- I've never once told anyone they shouldn't keep their cats
inside if they believe that this is the safest thing to do in
the environment they live in. I've continually emphasised that
having spent time in the US I understand completely why so many
Americans *do* choose to keep their cats inside. But just
because that's the best option for you, where you live, please
don't presume to assume that this is the best option for
other people - either elsewhere in the US or around the world.

- Most of the dangers that exist in your country simply don't
exist here, and those that do can be avoided. Yes, I *do*
believe that cats allowed outside have a far better, balanced
and happier life, but I also understand why some people can't
allow their cats the opportunity and, unlike you, I wouldn't
presume to judge other people or tell them that I know their
home environment better than they do.

- While I don't dispute that some places are too dangerous to
allow a cat outside...

- Yes, there are obviously some circumstances which mean that
it's too dangerous to allow the cat outside, but keeping it
inside is not the best or ideal environment for the cat. It's
just the safest in that situation. I really don't think the
fact that the cat might adjust is an acceptable argument in
favour of it. A cat would adjust to living in a 6 foot square
cage if it had to. What reasonable people should agree on is
that sometimes a cat has to be kept indoors because the
dangers outside are too great, but that it isn't the ideal
way for a cat to live, given the nature of the beast.

I have NEVER said &quot;Free-roam or nothing&quot;.

If you have any guts you'll read the following and then apologise. I've
posted this a couple of times before during indoor/outdoor debates:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Sorry if this sounds a little heated, it really is not personal.
&gt; I just have strong feelings on it.

"/> I think we all do, and it's an issue that I've seen go round and round
in very heated circles many times. I honestly don't believe that
there's any way the two sides will *ever* be able to understand where
the other is coming from.

As someone who's travelled pretty extensively through your country, I
understand why most Americans say it's too dangerous to let cats
outside. I think that in vast areas of the US it *is* too dangerous. I
don't think that most Brits appreciate just how many predators and
dangers cats have to deal with in your land, because it simply isn't
like that here. I don't think they appreciate just how many human foes
the cat has in the US either, because here if a cat is ill-treated by
someone it makes headline news. And the fact that it isn't like that
here is what most Americans just aren't able to appreciate.

In trying to apply the same rationale to cat-keeping in both our
countries, we're trying to compare chalk with cheese. The circumstances
are so different, the conventions are so different, and the experience
is so different, that there is little, if any, common ground on which to
base the discussion.

Our two countries are very different in the way cats are viewed, in the
way the non-cat loving population behaves towards them, and in the
danger levels cats face outside. I've lost count of the number of times
in these debates that Americans have used coyotes, rabies, racoons,
people with guns etc. as arguments against Brits letting their cats
out. Only a couple of days ago someone here said &quot;what about the wild
dogs?&quot;. The fact is we don't have coyotes, rabies, racoons or wild
dogs, and we have virtually nobody with guns either. Where I live I
can't remember the last time I saw an unaccompanied domestic dog, let
alone a wild one. Other than traffic, the dangers your cats would have
to face simply don't exist here. Even the danger of disease so often
raised in these debates is different, because the vast majority of
cat-owners here have their cats vaccinated and neutered. We don't have
heartworm here either. While yes, of course we have ferals, and yes,
there are unvaccinated, unneutered cats out there, most of us don't
worry about that because our cats are vaccinated and neutered and we
know from decades of experience that the vast majority of our cats live
long and happy indoor/outdoor lives. Personally I've never lost one
younger than 16, and every one has spent its life going out during the
day.

I don't dismiss for a minute the fact that British cats get run over by
cars. Of course they do, but proportionally the number is very small.
That's not to say it doesn't matter, but the British are so certain that
keeping a cat indoors all its life is cruel that we weigh up the risks
and believe that the risk is acceptable, in the same way that we weigh
up the risk of our children going out of the house alone and decide when
that is acceptable. We believe that the quality of life of an indoor
cat is so low that risking a little less in quantity is acceptable. And
it really is only a *little* less here, the figures of outdoor cats only
living 2-3 years would be quite laughable here. So what we do is
minimise the risk as much as possible by trying to live somewhere away
from busy roads. All my cat-loving friends live in quiet areas where
their cats don't have to deal with speeding cars.

&gt; If you feel your cat does need to be out for part of the day, put it
on a
&gt; leash and take it out yourself. Beats having it squashed by a semi,
don't
&gt; you think?

Of course, but being held on a leash still isn't letting the cat be a
cat, and you might only understand what I mean by that if you've had
cats that are free outside. The other thing so often misunderstood by
non-Brits is that here, in the main, if people live on a busy road or
somewhere that would be dangerous, they don't have cats. My cats would
never be squashed by a semi, because semis don't come anywhere near
here. People here who live in places where an outdoor cat would be at
risk, or where the cat can't get to the outside (high-rise apartments
for example) mostly choose not to keep cats because they believe keeping
them in is cruel. And this is something that American cat owners will
never be able to get past. In the same way that most Americans are
convinced that letting a cat out is cruel, most Brits are absolutely
certain that keeping it in is cruel.

This whole debate is a totally lost cause, because the participants are
so completely opposed on every level that there's no common ground to
meet on. If someone tried to convince you to do something that you
thought was cruel to your cat, would you do it? Telling a Brit to keep
his/her cat indoors all its life is telling him/her to be cruel to it
(in our eyes). No matter what arguments you put up, it ain't going to
happen, particularly as the arguments always presented are completely
irrelevant to the British environment.

Over here, of course, because the majority of our shelters are no-kill,
cat lovers have the luxury of being able to choose not to have a cat
without wondering if that means that they're condemning the cat they're
not going to have to death at the Humane Society. Every shelter within
100 mile radius of where I live is no-kill, so if I decide the road's
too dangerous to have a cat here, I know it won't mean the death of any
cat in those shelters. How people would react if they knew that the cat
they're not having would die in a week I don't know. It's not
something, thank god, the Brits have ever had to deal with.

&gt; there is no way you can tell me that keeping them indoors
&gt; is cruel.

Which is why, although I believe 100% that keeping a cat indoors all its
life is extremely cruel, I won't try to convince you.

&gt; Every vet I have seen in 27 years of owning cats has said that
&gt; indoors only is the absolute best way to go.

I'm sure that's true, and every vet I've seen in 31 years of owning cats
has said that indoors is unnatural, stressful and cruel, so that doesn't
get us any further in the debate, does it? Our vets are reacting to the
individual conditions of our countries, as we both are.

&gt; And that's a lot of vets,
&gt; seeing as I worked part time at the vet hospital in college.

Unfortunately that's a lot of vets for me too, because I'm getting a bit
&quot;mature&quot;.

So there we are, still going round in that circle. The environment my
cats have to deal with is almost certainly very different from yours,
and if you haven't seen it I can't expect you to understand why my cats
are safe. The conditions for cats here are so different from the
conditions most American cats would have to face that I can understand
why so many Americans find it impossible to understand. Likewise, most
Brits don't understand your environment, so they don't understand that,
for a lot of you, telling you to let your cats out is asking you to
condemn them to death. Most cat-loving Brits don't realise how lucky
they are to live where they do.

There is never, ever going to be an accommodation reached in this
argument. The best we can hope for, I believe, is to accept the fact
that our two environments differ enormously and that because of this we
can't expect our cats to live in the same conditions. Americans should
accept that the UK simply isn't the same as the US and that when they
envisage our towns and streets as being the same as American towns and
streets, they're wrong. It's about time that Brits accepted that when
Americans say it's too dangerous to let their cats out, most of them are
probably right. And when Americans pose the question &quot;Is it better for
the cat to die in the shelter than live indoors with me?&quot;, it's about
time that Brits stopped responding with &quot;It's better that you let your
cat go outside&quot;, and instead acknowledge that this is a very valid
question and a very real problem for Americans. In return it's about
time that Americans stopped telling Brits that we're irresponsible and
uncaring - because our cats are living long, happy and healthy
indoor/outdoor lives over here, and we love our cats just as much as you
love yours. Do you really believe that we don't want the best for our
cats? Is it really impossible for us to credit each other with the
intelligence to be able to judge what is and isn't safe for the cat we
love?

Personally, I *do* understand why most Americans keep their cats inside,
but I also believe that the quality of the cats' lives is severely
reduced because of that. But rather than yell at Americans on
newsgroups, I intend to thank my lucky stars that my cats are able to
live unrestricted lives. When I look out of the window tomorrow and see
my cats lying in the sunshine, climbing trees, chasing leaves, stalking
the frogs and generally loving their outdoor lives, I shall thank god
that I don't see coyotes, rabid dogs or cat-hating neighbours with
shotguns coming round the corner.

If you still claim I said you shouldn't have cats if you can't let them
out you're a raving lunatic.

&gt; On the PBS channel a while back we watched a really fantastic special
&gt; about cats, and in one part, somewhere in the state of California they
&gt; are bringing shelter cats into a prison, and the inmates who
&gt; volunteered for the project are each issued a cat for a couple of
&gt; hours, to bathe it, brush it, clean it's ears, and anything else the
&gt; cat may require to make it a better candidate for adoption. The
&gt; inmates really seemed to like it, as well as the cats, and apparently
&gt; the adoption rate has increased for that shelter.

"/> The SPCA does that too.. We have many pets fostered out to correctional
centers.
They are kept in the same enclosed space as the prisoners and are treated
with
all the love, tenderness and respect that many stray cats will never know,
and misguided
hurting people are given a new direction in life.

&gt; Among other things, such as your conclusion from personal observation that
&gt; *all* indoor cats live &quot;half&quot; lives, I also disagree that you make the
&gt; assumption that those who keep their cats indoors do this to satisfy their
&gt; own needs rather than the cat's. It would certainly be more convenient
and
&gt; a heck of a lot easier for me to forgo the litter box, the cat condos,
&gt; harness training, etc. and kick my three cats out all day to roam loose.
I
&gt; think most people who restrict their cat's roaming in the great outdoors
&gt; firmly believe that they are doing so for the cat - not themselves. I
know
&gt; I do, and I think I'm better qualified to determine my own motives for
doing
&gt; so than some stranger on a newsgroup.

"/> Too true. Although I did appreciate that Alley Cat was a lot less cruel and
opinionated
in her belief than Frank'n'Bob are, I do not believe my cats are suffering
from staying indoors.
It would be nice not to have to clean litter boxes, have a couch that ISN'T
shredded, etc..
but my cats are worth every second of extra chores, and are more important
than furniture.
Their health and well-being is more important to me than some so-called need
to be outdoors.
I grew up with outdoor/indoor cats and like Karen, I see no difference in
their behaviour
than my indoor cats except that my indoor cats will not disappear or get hit
by cars.

&gt; That's absolute rubbish. Should we never allow our children outside the

&gt; serious injuries your children suffer playing these sports each year?
&gt; Do you advocate keeping children inside their entire lives, or do you
&gt; concede that in order to be balanced human beings they *need* to be
&gt; allowed their freedom to experience what the world has to offer?
&gt; You're not addressing your cats' *needs* at all, just your own.

"/> Well, personally, my need is to keep my cats safe and healthy, so I would
think it would be mutually beneficial.

As for kids compared to cats statement.. I would not DREAM of letting my
children out unattended until they were able to figure out how to cross a
road
at the proper light, to NOT run into traffic.. to not eat poison (as cats
with antifreeze or rat poison).
I would also not let my children run loose in an area where children with
sharp weapons (as cats with claws and teeth) would attack my kids just
because
they wandered into someone else's yard. I would not let my child walk
unattended in a
place that I was not certain would not be safe for them, or they would be
abducted (as cats being
stolen off the street) or where wild animals would abduct them.. or they
might be scared by
something and not be able to find there way home.

But kids are not cats and cats are not kids and you cannot treat them the
same way.

Some cats are quite clever, and can stay in their specific territory. Some
cats know how to avoid wild
animals or other cats.. but yet many, many other cats wind up in pet
hospitals or shelters (and I work for the
Vancouver SPCA Hospital so I have actually SEEN this happen regularly).

If you feel your outdoor cat is safe and happy then I hope your cat lives a
long, happy healthy life. Please do
not presume to tell me that my cat is living a less than happy life because
it is not living the life you would chose.
If I thought my cats were not living a good life I would not have them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have never said you are cruel or irresponsible. I have questioned
&gt; your motives for keeping your cats indoors, but I have never told you
&gt; that you must let them out. What I dispute with you is your
&gt; extraordinary refusal to acknowledge that not everywhere is like the US
&gt; and your tunnel vision in being unable to accept that there are places
&gt; that are safe for cats to go outside. It is your blanket demand that
&gt; all cats must be kept indoors wherever they live that I dispute, because
&gt; it's ludicrous. You insist that because your country is the way it is
&gt; our countries must be to, and you have the staggering arrogance to tell
&gt; us that, when our countries are so different that we treat our cats
&gt; differently, we are irresponsible owners.

"/> Hi Alley.. yup, it's me again! I appreciate your willing to keep from
extremist points
of view..I do recall you saying something to the effect of:

&quot;Having said that I have to admit that if there was a way of doing it
without having millions of healthy cats euthanised, I'd very much like
to see North Americans stop having cats at all if they can't go outside
because having seen a lot of indoor cats and having spent my entire life
with indoor/outdoor cats I have absolutely no doubt that indoor cats
live half-lives. That this is all most American owners can offer is the
sad part of this, and I know that most of you do everything you can to
provide full and entertaining lives for your cats. In an ideal world,
though, I wish that there was a humane way for you to put the needs of
your cats above your wish to own them, and for the practise of keeping
indoor cats to cease.&quot;

That is an extremist point of view. Some cats like to go outside, some cats
prefer
inside. Some owners have cats who live their lives in and out of doors and
live to be
old, healthy kitties. Some have cats who don't live past their first year
because they
have been killed by cars, other animals, or disappeared without a trace.
Some pets
wander away from their homes and wind up in shelters or turn feral because
they
couldn't find their way home.

In all fairness some indoor kitties die of illnesses that would have struck
them if they were
indoor or outdoors. Some get into household cleaners or fall prey to
accidents...

This happens all over the world. Not just in America, or England, or Canada
or anywhere else.

I guess what I object to, is you telling me that my cats are leading a half
life. That they are somehow
cheated out of a better life because I chose to keep them inside. I do not
do it because I am a sadistic
monster that keeps these little creatures penned up for her amusement. I
keep them indoors because
I love them so much that I would see no harm befall them.

In the end, if (those of us who choose to keep our cats inside) we didn't
want the responsibility of
protecting our cats, why did we domesticate them in the first place? I
suppose it would have been
kinder to let them stay wild, mating and overpopulating. Dying in mass
numbers of disease, animal
attacks or being killed by man.

I do not regret my choice. You do not regret yours. 'Nuff said.

Hi Jeanne..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I agree with what you say that some people think you are cruel if you keep
&gt; you cats indoors. I seem to spend most of my time having to justify why I
&gt; keep my cats indoors, and for everyone out there I want you to know it is
&gt; not that I am being cruel. I had Penny from a kitten and although I tried
&gt; many times to take her outside she was just too scared and the vet said it
&gt; was being MORE cruel to force her outside. Daffy then came along as a
&gt; rescued cat and she had been so badly abused she did not want to go out,
&gt; probably of fear that she would be kicked again! So because of these
&gt; circumstances I decided that my cats were meant to be indoors and thus I
&gt; have catered for their outside needs inside eg a climbing frame that
reaches
&gt; from floor to ceiling etc. My cats are very content and they do go outside
&gt; into the backgarden accompanied so that they can get fresh air but feel
safe
&gt; and secure. I also feel after being a cat owner for a while now that even
&gt; if my cats were not scared of the big bad world outside I would not let
them
&gt; into it, ask yourselves this question would you let a dog roam the streets
&gt; unaccompanied to get hurt and into trouble, well I bet the answer is No,
so
&gt; why should it be different for cats(from what I have seen and heard they
are
&gt; no more streetwise!)

"/> My Ally was a stray cat when I adopted her from the SPCA. She was in the
SPCA
Hospital, sick and lost. After I adopted her I chose not to let her go
outside because
I weighed the pros and cons. (I got Cobee as a kitten and I assume he has
always
been indoors).As I said, I work for the SPCA Hospital. I see soooo many
sick and injured and DEAD cats and dogs come through the doors every day. I
also
remembered the cats I had growing up.. of the 3 outdoor cats we had 2 went
missing in the
first year. (The 1st was kept in a very quiet neighborhood). I choose to
keep my cats
indoors because I have thought long and hard about it. I see that my cats
are healthy (verified by vets),
content and happy. I do not presume to say ALL should do the same, but it
works for me and my kitties.

Actually if any of the shower products you use contain any forms of
glyceryl or glycol that may explain it. Since cats and dogs find glyceryn to
be sweet tasting. Of course this stuff is toxic to them.
My cat won't show any interest in water straight from the fridge either.

&gt; Subject: Re: The Great Debate - Indoors Vs. Outdoors

&gt;&gt; Among other things, such as your conclusion from personal observation that
&gt;&gt; *all* indoor cats live &quot;half&quot; lives, I also disagree that you make the
&gt;&gt; assumption that those who keep their cats indoors do this to satisfy their
&gt;&gt; own needs rather than the cat's. It would certainly be more convenient
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; a heck of a lot easier for me to forgo the litter box, the cat condos,
&gt;&gt; harness training, etc. and kick my three cats out all day to roam loose.
&gt; I
&gt;&gt; think most people who restrict their cat's roaming in the great outdoors
&gt;&gt; firmly believe that they are doing so for the cat - not themselves. I
&gt; know
&gt;&gt; I do, and I think I'm better qualified to determine my own motives for
&gt; doing
&gt;&gt; so than some stranger on a newsgroup.

&gt; Too true. Although I did appreciate that Alley Cat was a lot less cruel and
&gt; opinionated
&gt; in her belief than Frank'n'Bob are, I do not believe my cats are suffering
&gt; from staying indoors.
&gt; It would be nice not to have to clean litter boxes, have a couch that ISN'T
&gt; shredded, etc..
&gt; but my cats are worth every second of extra chores, and are more important
&gt; than furniture.
&gt; Their health and well-being is more important to me than some so-called need
&gt; to be outdoors.
&gt; I grew up with outdoor/indoor cats and like Karen, I see no difference in
&gt; their behaviour
&gt; than my indoor cats except that my indoor cats will not disappear or get hit
&gt; by cars.

"/> And I am still wondering what Alley Cat has observed about indoor only cats
that makes her believe this. It may easily be the case that she has seen
indoor cats that do not get the kind of interaction and pro-involvement that
many of us provide for our cats. Plenty of toys, pots of grass, cat
furniture etc. In those cases, which I too have seen, one could easily say
the cat is living a half life. I still haven't seen a response to the hours
of observations of my cats where the indoor ones do all the same things as
my indoor/outdoor ever did. I'm hoping that she was just too busy with Phil
to respond.

actually see it. It's kinda fun and educational. We even have this game
where I chase them, and they run behind or under somthing. Then I hide, and
they slowly come out stalking me. When one sees me I run away and they

&gt;&gt; a 4 foot cage, I wasn't actually talking about keeping a cat indoors at
&gt;&gt; all, I was challenging Morag's statement that what matters is not how
&gt;&gt; its kept but whether a cat is healthy and the owner is caring for it to
&gt;&gt; the best of his/her ability. I was following her logic to its natural
&gt;&gt; conclusion because her statement could be seen to be justifying keeping
&gt;&gt; a cat in any conditions as long as the owner was doing his/her best. My
&gt;&gt; point was that this *isn't* what matters because the best of many
&gt;&gt; people's ability doesn't stop an animal suffering, as all the animal
&gt;&gt; welfare organisations will verify.

&gt;I find it interesting that you took Morag's post that way. I certainly can

&gt;&gt; That's absolute rubbish. Should we never allow our children outside the

&gt;&gt; kid? Would you not allow any American child to play football or

&gt;&gt; serious injuries your children suffer playing these sports each year?
&gt;&gt; Do you advocate keeping children inside their entire lives, or do you
&gt;&gt; concede that in order to be balanced human beings they *need* to be

&gt;Hi Jeanne..

&gt;&gt; I agree with what you say that some people think you are cruel if you keep
&gt;&gt; you cats indoors. I seem to spend most of my time having to justify why I
&gt;&gt; keep my cats indoors, and for everyone out there I want you to know it is
&gt;&gt; not that I am being cruel. I had Penny from a kitten and although I tried
&gt;&gt; many times to take her outside she was just too scared and the vet said it
&gt;&gt; was being MORE cruel to force her outside. Daffy then came along as a
&gt;&gt; rescued cat and she had been so badly abused she did not want to go out,
&gt;&gt; probably of fear that she would be kicked again! So because of these
&gt;&gt; circumstances I decided that my cats were meant to be indoors and thus I
&gt;&gt; have catered for their outside needs inside eg a climbing frame that
&gt;reaches
&gt;&gt; from floor to ceiling etc. My cats are very content and they do go outside
&gt;&gt; into the backgarden accompanied so that they can get fresh air but feel
&gt;safe
&gt;&gt; and secure. I also feel after being a cat owner for a while now that even
&gt;&gt; if my cats were not scared of the big bad world outside I would not let
&gt;them
&gt;&gt; into it, ask yourselves this question would you let a dog roam the streets
&gt;&gt; unaccompanied to get hurt and into trouble, well I bet the answer is No,
&gt;so
&gt;&gt; why should it be different for cats(from what I have seen and heard they
&gt;are
&gt;&gt; no more streetwise!)

&gt;My Ally was a stray cat when I adopted her from the SPCA. She was in the
&gt;SPCA
&gt;Hospital, sick and lost. After I adopted her I chose not to let her go
&gt;outside because
&gt;I weighed the pros and cons. (I got Cobee as a kitten and I assume he has
&gt;always
&gt;been indoors).As I said, I work for the SPCA Hospital. I see soooo many
&gt;sick and injured and DEAD cats and dogs come through the doors every day. I
&gt;also
&gt;remembered the cats I had growing up.. of the 3 outdoor cats we had 2 went
&gt;missing in the
&gt;first year. (The 1st was kept in a very quiet neighborhood). I choose to
&gt;keep my cats
&gt;indoors because I have thought long and hard about it. I see that my cats
&gt;are healthy (verified by vets),
&gt;content and happy. I do not presume to say ALL should do the same, but it
&gt;works for me and my kitties.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Katherine Houpt - Director of the Behavior Clinic at Cornell

&gt;&gt;&gt;That is true, something we accept as part of keeping a cat - because
&gt;&gt;&gt;it is part of the nature of the cat.
&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; I suspect the quote from Katherine Houpt applies to ENTIRE toms. One of
&gt;&gt; the benefits of neutering is that the animal fights much less, if at
&gt;&gt; all, and therefore rarely or never get fight injuries.

&gt;&quot;Castration is approximately 90 percent effective in eliminating roaming and
&gt;fighting, although the disappearance of either roaming or fighting may not
&gt;necessarily be associated with a decline in the other.&quot;
&gt;(Katherine Houpt - Director, Cornell Behavior Clinic)

&gt;The problem is not eliminated only by neutering your cat, an unneutered tom
&gt;will defend his turf and can attack your cat.

&gt;&gt; If it applied to neuters as well I suspect those of us who keep more
&gt;&gt; than one cat would also have problems with our cats fighting with each
&gt;&gt; other and injuring each other, especially when a new cat or kitten is
&gt;&gt; being introduced.

&gt;Neutering greatly reduces, and in many cases, eliminates territorial
&gt;aggression and fighting in cats housed together. Four of my sister's 6 cats
&gt;are neutered males and the only occasional &quot;swat&quot; comes from the original
&gt;spayed *female*! However some people have cats that never get along, others
&gt;have cats that &quot;tolerate&quot; each other, and others have cats who are one big
&gt;happy family (like mine).

&gt;&gt;Too true. Although I did appreciate that Alley Cat was a lot less cruel
and
&gt;&gt;opinionated
&gt;&gt;in her belief than Frank'n'Bob are, I do not believe my cats are
suffering
&gt;&gt;from staying indoors.

&gt; You know they used to say that about the kids sent down the coal

&gt; Perceptions of cruelty change, especially as you learn more about the

&gt;&gt;It would be nice not to have to clean litter boxes, have a couch that

&gt;&gt;but my cats are worth every second of extra chores, and are more
important
&gt;&gt;than furniture.
&gt;&gt;Their health and well-being is more important to me than some so-called
need
&gt;&gt;to be outdoors.
&gt;&gt;I grew up with outdoor/indoor cats and like Karen, I see no difference in
&gt;&gt;their behaviour
&gt;&gt;than my indoor cats except that my indoor cats will not disappear or get
hit
&gt;&gt;by cars.

&gt; Nor will it enjoy nature, socialize with other cats, have a chance to

&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't say that it is. Sorry, but you've misunderstood the point I
&gt;&gt;&gt; was making. I wasn't comparing keeping a cat indoors with keeping it
in
&gt;&gt;&gt; a 4 foot cage, I wasn't actually talking about keeping a cat indoors at
&gt;&gt;&gt; all, I was challenging Morag's statement that what matters is not how
&gt;&gt;&gt; its kept but whether a cat is healthy and the owner is caring for it to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the best of his/her ability. I was following her logic to its natural
&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusion because her statement could be seen to be justifying keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt; a cat in any conditions as long as the owner was doing his/her best.
My
&gt;&gt;&gt; point was that this *isn't* what matters because the best of many
&gt;&gt;&gt; people's ability doesn't stop an animal suffering, as all the animal
&gt;&gt;&gt; welfare organisations will verify.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Alley Cat

&gt;&gt;I find it interesting that you took Morag's post that way. I certainly
can
&gt;&gt;not see that as a logical conclusion to the post, but that is much of
the
&gt;&gt;difficulty throughout these threads, everyone reads things differently. I
&gt;&gt;think there is also a fine point to if the owners *think* they are doing

&gt; Quite easy. Its not 100% safe on the streets - keep cats penned in the
&gt; garden. Its not 100% safe outside - keep cats in. Its not 100% safe in
&gt; the house - put it in a cage.......

&gt; And don't try to say it will never happen - parts 1 &amp; 2 already have
&gt; in your country.

If you are giving them water from the tap, chances are they are smelling the
chemicals used to treat the water. Mine prefer the water from the toilet -
ewwwww! Why they prefer the soapy water, I don't know. My kitty Harry drank
from my tub water while I was taking a bath, no matter how many times I scolded
him and pushed him to the floor, he jumped right back up and started drinking.
Oh, silly kitties... :)

I think we need to not make generalizations about the U.K. vs. the U.S. I live
in the U.S. and many people here let their cats out -- and many don't. It's an
individual choice, based on where you live, what the neighborhood is like, and
what your personal beliefs are concerning letting your cat out. My sister had a
cat that would have happily spent the rest of his life indoors if he could (alas
he couldn't use a litter box and had to spend time outside when no one would be
home for a while). I have two cats and both like going outside, one more so than
the other - he throws fits if I don't let him out at least for an hour or so
each day. I call him in frequently to make sure he's okay. I have a fairly safe
area near my apartment so I feel alright letting him out. I am in the process of
looking for a home with a good fenced in yard, though. Anyway, my point is - no
one is going to win this argument, so can we please stop pointing fingers and
accusing each other of not caring about our cats?? Because I think it's safe to
say 99.9999% of us do - very much.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My only problem with this topic is that a few &quot;pro-outside&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; folks believe that anyone who keeps their cat(s) inside are
&gt;&gt;&gt; cruel and don't deserve cats. :(

&gt;&gt; I think that would probably be true of most Brits. Keeping cats indoors
&gt;&gt; here is generally considered to be very cruel.

&gt; Most Americans consider it cruel to expose cats to being hit by cars, being
&gt; injured in cat fights, catching infections such as feline leukemia virus and
&gt; feline immunodeficiency virus (Feline &quot;AIDS&quot;), being stolen and tortured,
&gt; territorial disputes, threats from other animals, people, environmental
&gt; noises which cause panic, and situations which generate pure fear and
&gt; stress.

&gt; But that's in a country
&gt;&gt; where it's safe for cats to have indoor/outdoor lives.

&gt; We seem to have either different interpretations of &quot;safe&quot; or value our cats
&gt; much differently..

&gt; Having spent a
&gt;&gt; lot of time in the US I'm well aware of the very different dangers that
&gt;&gt; North American cats face, so I do understand why so many of them are
&gt;&gt; kept indoors.

&gt;&gt; Having said that I have to admit that if there was a way of doing it
&gt;&gt; without having millions of healthy cats euthanised, I'd very much like
&gt;&gt; to see North Americans stop having cats at all if they can't go outside

&gt; I know how you feel. I would very much like to see Brits stop having cats
&gt; if they can't provide safe protected lives for their cats. I guess we both
&gt; have to bite the bullet because neither of us will ever see our wishes come
&gt; true.

&gt;&gt; because having seen a lot of indoor cats and having spent my entire life
&gt;&gt; with indoor/outdoor cats I have absolutely no doubt that indoor cats
&gt;&gt; live half-lives.

&gt; You have not seen my cats or the millions of cats that are living happily
&gt; and safely in protected environments. I have had both, indoor and
&gt; indoor/outdoor cats as well. The only difference between the two is that my
&gt; indoor/protected cats are still alive. I have absolutely no doubt that my
&gt; indoor/protected outdoor cats have a full life. If they are unhappy, they
&gt; sure are doing a great job of fooling me, my vet and everyone else who knows
&gt; them. I would think if there was any adverse effects of indoor/protected
&gt; outdoor life, after ~20 years, some kind of evidence would be detectable.
&gt; There is none.

&gt; That this is all most American owners can offer is the
&gt;&gt; sad part of this, and I know that most of you do everything you can to
&gt;&gt; provide full and entertaining lives for your cats.

&gt; Sad for whom? Surely not my cats. However, I understand providing full and
&gt; entertaining lives for our cats takes a bit of effort - a tad more than
&gt; swinging open a door - Oh, I forgot, many Brits don't even do that, they
&gt; have cat flaps - and no litter boxes....

&gt; In an ideal world,
&gt;&gt; though, I wish that there was a humane way for you to put the needs of
&gt;&gt; your cats above your wish to own them, and for the practise of keeping
&gt;&gt; indoor cats to cease.

&gt; In an ideal world, I'd like to see Brits put the health and safety of their
&gt; cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated custom.

&gt; However, until someone comes up with a better way
&gt;&gt; than simply euthanising all those who can't find suitable indoor/outdoor
&gt;&gt; homes, I understand why this goes on.

&gt; Apparently, neither of us thinks the other should have cats. If all of us,
&gt; and all of you didn't have cats, what would happen to all the cats?

&gt; But I have a more realistic, burning question: As stated by your fellow
&gt; countrymen, most Brits don't have litterboxes unless the cat is ill or they
&gt; are kittens; your cats eliminate outdoors. Here's my burning question: If
&gt; you don't *see* your cats eliminate, how do you know when your cats have a
&gt; urinary tract disorder or obstruction? Urinary tract obstruction can be
&gt; *fatal* for a male cat who doesn't urinate for more than 24-36 hours. Male
&gt; cats that can't urinate can *die* from acute renal failure and/or severe
&gt; damage to the urinary bladder.

&gt; This is another reason why I'd like to see Brits put the health and safety
&gt; of their cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated custom.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wounds and abscesses, the result of aggressive behaviors.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Katherine Houpt - Director of the Behavior Clinic at Cornell

&gt;&gt;&gt;That is true, something we accept as part of keeping a cat - because
&gt;&gt;&gt;it is part of the nature of the cat.
&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; I suspect the quote from Katherine Houpt applies to ENTIRE toms. One of
&gt;&gt; the benefits of neutering is that the animal fights much less, if at
&gt;&gt; all, and therefore rarely or never get fight injuries.

&gt;&quot;Castration is approximately 90 percent effective in eliminating roaming and
&gt;fighting, although the disappearance of either roaming or fighting may not
&gt;necessarily be associated with a decline in the other.&quot;
&gt;(Katherine Houpt - Director, Cornell Behavior Clinic)

&gt;The problem is not eliminated only by neutering your cat, an unneutered tom
&gt;will defend his turf and can attack your cat.

&gt;&gt; If it applied to neuters as well I suspect those of us who keep more
&gt;&gt; than one cat would also have problems with our cats fighting with each
&gt;&gt; other and injuring each other, especially when a new cat or kitten is
&gt;&gt; being introduced.

&gt;Neutering greatly reduces, and in many cases, eliminates territorial
&gt;aggression and fighting in cats housed together. Four of my sister's 6 cats
&gt;are neutered males and the only occasional &quot;swat&quot; comes from the original
&gt;spayed *female*! However some people have cats that never get along, others
&gt;have cats that &quot;tolerate&quot; each other, and others have cats who are one big
&gt;happy family (like mine).

"/> This is a bit 'have your cake and eat it'. It takes two to fight, and
since neutered males don't understand what it's about they don't hang
around. They are also possibly not picked upon as the entire male will
realise they are 'not quite all there' (in the nicest possible way) and
are therefore no threat to his chance of access to females.

Hi Karen,
This isn't a reply to your post, I just wanted to make a couple of points in
general. sorry.
In this country (UK) some cats are owned by pet lovers who would like a pet
but are at work a lot. They choose a cat because they are more independant
and they have a cat door so they can come and go as they please. If they get
bored they can go out, if the weathers bad they can snooze indoors.
If couples are at work all day I feel an indoor cat/s wouldn't have enough
attention to make up for not going outside.
Also, There was a post on the uk cat ng from someone who moved to the
States . Her cat is unhappy indoors but her vet put pressure on her not to
let her cat out. Surely its up to her to decide, not her vet. I don't think
a UK vet would put pressure on someone to let her cat out if they wanted to
keep her in..

&gt;&gt;&gt; Since you are the first person expressing this view who says they have
&gt;&gt;&gt; experience with both, I am curious as to why you find that indoor cats
have
&gt;&gt;&gt; half-lives?

&gt;&gt; They have half-lives because they never have the opportunity to
&gt;&gt; experience the natural world they belong to or to use many of the senses
&gt;&gt; and instincts they were born with. You only have to take the time to
&gt;&gt; seriously observe a cat in the outside world, to watch it communing with
&gt;&gt; nature and interracting with the rest of the natural world, to see a
&gt;&gt; whole new set of behavioural patterns come into play.

&gt; My point is, that I grew up watching my cats outside. We had anywhere from
7
&gt; to 9 at one time. I spent much of my youth (7-18) in the backyard just
&gt; watching them. They stalked things and each other, played, they rested a
&gt; lot, slept a lot, came in to poop and went outside to sit. I watch my cats
&gt; who are indoors now stalk things, stalk each other, play, they rest a lot,
&gt; groom a lot. This is what I am telling you folks, they act the same, they
&gt; appear to derive the same satisfaction from playing with their cat dancer,
&gt; climbing their furniture, chasing each other at top speed around the
place,
&gt; play with their mousies and balls as the cats I grew up with did playing
in
&gt; the backyard. I can't call it a half life.

&gt;&gt; The domestic
&gt;&gt; moggie walks through the cat flap and a tiger emerges on the outside.

&gt; It's a lovely romantic image, but what practicality in the life of the cat
&gt; does it really show? I still wonder what *you* have seen in cats that are
&gt; raised indoor that makes them seem unhappy to you. That is the question I
am
&gt; asking. Do the owners not take sufficient effort to provide new challenges
&gt; and entertainment? heck, sometimes after a toy starts getting ignored
(i.e.
&gt; they are *bored* with it) you make it into something new. You get new
toys,
&gt; invent toys. They have grass to nibble on are energetic, playful. How is
&gt; that possible if they are living a &quot;half-life&quot;? Wouldn't you expect them
to
&gt; be listless or aggressive?

&gt;&gt; A few years ago a British team of behaviourists attached a camera to a
&gt;&gt; cat's collar before it left its home. They spent weeks following the
&gt;&gt; cat as best they could and analysing the footage that it brought back
&gt;&gt; each evening. The resulting film was fascinating and some of what
&gt;&gt; emerged amazed even those experienced naturalists who thought they knew
&gt;&gt; the cat. It gave new insight into the true nature of what we believe to
&gt;&gt; be a domesticated animal.

&gt; It gives insight into how adaptable they are. How does it show they are
&gt; somehow &quot;less&quot; without it?

&gt;&gt; This is a wild animal that kids us into giving it shelter, and a cat
&gt;&gt; that doesn't have the chance to be what it truly is doesn't live a full
&gt;&gt; life any more than I would if I spent my entire life inside.

&gt;&gt; Alley Cat

&gt; I was really wondering, since you mentioned it, what indoor cats did that
&gt; led you to the belief they are only half alive.

Hi Susan,
About stray cats. Micro chipping is beginning to catch on here. I'm hoping
people will think it's as necessary as innoculations.
Not all cats brought in to shelters are genuine strays. Some cats tend to
hang around places they like. There was a case once where two families went
to court over a cat they both believed they *owned*.
I suspect a lot of strays are dumped cats. Sadly ,even in this animal loving
country people thow their cats out of cars if they can,t be bothered to take
them to the RSPCA.

&gt;&gt; That's absolute rubbish. Should we never allow our children outside the

&gt;&gt; serious injuries your children suffer playing these sports each year?
&gt;&gt; Do you advocate keeping children inside their entire lives, or do you

&gt;&gt; You're not addressing your cats' *needs* at all, just your own.

&gt; Well, personally, my need is to keep my cats safe and healthy, so I would
&gt; think it would be mutually beneficial.

&gt; As for kids compared to cats statement.. I would not DREAM of letting my
&gt; children out unattended until they were able to figure out how to cross a
&gt; road
&gt; at the proper light, to NOT run into traffic.. to not eat poison (as cats
&gt; with antifreeze or rat poison).
&gt; I would also not let my children run loose in an area where children with
&gt; sharp weapons (as cats with claws and teeth) would attack my kids just
&gt; because
&gt; they wandered into someone else's yard. I would not let my child walk
&gt; unattended in a
&gt; place that I was not certain would not be safe for them, or they would be
&gt; abducted (as cats being
&gt; stolen off the street) or where wild animals would abduct them.. or they
&gt; might be scared by
&gt; something and not be able to find there way home.

&gt; But kids are not cats and cats are not kids and you cannot treat them the
&gt; same way.

&gt; Some cats are quite clever, and can stay in their specific territory. Some
&gt; cats know how to avoid wild
&gt; animals or other cats.. but yet many, many other cats wind up in pet
&gt; hospitals or shelters (and I work for the
&gt; Vancouver SPCA Hospital so I have actually SEEN this happen regularly).

&gt; If you feel your outdoor cat is safe and happy then I hope your cat lives
a
&gt; long, happy healthy life. Please do
&gt; not presume to tell me that my cat is living a less than happy life
because
&gt; it is not living the life you would chose.
&gt; If I thought my cats were not living a good life I would not have them.

&gt; Ciao for now,

Your post is one of the few (though, not the only) reasonable posts I have
seen on this thread. You are to be commended for clear, objective thinking.

But you must realize that this &quot;debate&quot; is not about indoor-only vs
indoor-outdoor cats. This debate is about a handful of people who are
desperate to believe that they are &quot;right&quot;. They will never admit a mistake
&amp; never rethink an issue. This might lead them to change their minds ...
something that is, admittedly, diffcult ... &amp; something that they obviously
find frightening.

&gt; I think we need to not make generalizations about the U.K. vs. the U.S. I
live

It's an
&gt; individual choice, based on where you live, what the neighborhood is like,
and
&gt; what your personal beliefs are concerning letting your cat out. My sister
had a
&gt; cat that would have happily spent the rest of his life indoors if he could
(alas
&gt; he couldn't use a litter box and had to spend time outside when no one
would be
&gt; home for a while). I have two cats and both like going outside, one more
so than
&gt; the other - he throws fits if I don't let him out at least for an hour or
so
&gt; each day. I call him in frequently to make sure he's okay. I have a fairly
safe
&gt; area near my apartment so I feel alright letting him out. I am in the
process of
&gt; looking for a home with a good fenced in yard, though. Anyway, my point
is - no
&gt; one is going to win this argument, so can we please stop pointing fingers
and

safe to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cruel and don't deserve cats. :(

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that would probably be true of most Brits. Keeping cats
indoors
&gt;&gt;&gt; here is generally considered to be very cruel.

&gt;&gt; Most Americans consider it cruel to expose cats to being hit by cars,
being
&gt;&gt; injured in cat fights, catching infections such as feline leukemia virus
and
&gt;&gt; feline immunodeficiency virus (Feline &quot;AIDS&quot;), being stolen and
tortured,
&gt;&gt; territorial disputes, threats from other animals, people, environmental
&gt;&gt; noises which cause panic, and situations which generate pure fear and
&gt;&gt; stress.

&gt;&gt; But that's in a country
&gt;&gt;&gt; where it's safe for cats to have indoor/outdoor lives.

&gt;&gt; We seem to have either different interpretations of &quot;safe&quot; or value our
cats
&gt;&gt; much differently..

&gt;&gt; Having spent a
&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of time in the US I'm well aware of the very different dangers
that
&gt;&gt;&gt; North American cats face, so I do understand why so many of them are
&gt;&gt;&gt; kept indoors.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Having said that I have to admit that if there was a way of doing it
&gt;&gt;&gt; without having millions of healthy cats euthanised, I'd very much like
&gt;&gt;&gt; to see North Americans stop having cats at all if they can't go
outside

&gt;&gt; I know how you feel. I would very much like to see Brits stop having
cats
&gt;&gt; if they can't provide safe protected lives for their cats. I guess we
both
&gt;&gt; have to bite the bullet because neither of us will ever see our wishes
come
&gt;&gt; true.

&gt;&gt;&gt; because having seen a lot of indoor cats and having spent my entire
life
&gt;&gt;&gt; with indoor/outdoor cats I have absolutely no doubt that indoor cats
&gt;&gt;&gt; live half-lives.

&gt;&gt; You have not seen my cats or the millions of cats that are living
happily
&gt;&gt; and safely in protected environments. I have had both, indoor and
&gt;&gt; indoor/outdoor cats as well. The only difference between the two is
that my
&gt;&gt; indoor/protected cats are still alive. I have absolutely no doubt that
my
&gt;&gt; indoor/protected outdoor cats have a full life. If they are unhappy,
they
&gt;&gt; sure are doing a great job of fooling me, my vet and everyone else who
knows
&gt;&gt; them. I would think if there was any adverse effects of
indoor/protected
&gt;&gt; outdoor life, after ~20 years, some kind of evidence would be
detectable.
&gt;&gt; There is none.

&gt;&gt; That this is all most American owners can offer is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sad part of this, and I know that most of you do everything you can to
&gt;&gt;&gt; provide full and entertaining lives for your cats.

&gt;&gt; Sad for whom? Surely not my cats. However, I understand providing full
and
&gt;&gt; entertaining lives for our cats takes a bit of effort - a tad more than
&gt;&gt; swinging open a door - Oh, I forgot, many Brits don't even do that, they
&gt;&gt; have cat flaps - and no litter boxes....

&gt;&gt; In an ideal world,
&gt;&gt;&gt; though, I wish that there was a humane way for you to put the needs of
&gt;&gt;&gt; your cats above your wish to own them, and for the practise of keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor cats to cease.

&gt;&gt; In an ideal world, I'd like to see Brits put the health and safety of
their
&gt;&gt; cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated custom.

&gt;&gt; However, until someone comes up with a better way
&gt;&gt;&gt; than simply euthanising all those who can't find suitable
indoor/outdoor
&gt;&gt;&gt; homes, I understand why this goes on.

&gt;&gt; Apparently, neither of us thinks the other should have cats. If all of
us,
&gt;&gt; and all of you didn't have cats, what would happen to all the cats?

&gt;&gt; But I have a more realistic, burning question: As stated by your fellow
&gt;&gt; countrymen, most Brits don't have litterboxes unless the cat is ill or
they
&gt;&gt; are kittens; your cats eliminate outdoors. Here's my burning question:
If
&gt;&gt; you don't *see* your cats eliminate, how do you know when your cats have
a
&gt;&gt; urinary tract disorder or obstruction? Urinary tract obstruction can be
&gt;&gt; *fatal* for a male cat who doesn't urinate for more than 24-36 hours.
Male
&gt;&gt; cats that can't urinate can *die* from acute renal failure and/or severe
&gt;&gt; damage to the urinary bladder.

&gt;&gt; This is another reason why I'd like to see Brits put the health and
safety
&gt;&gt; of their cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated
custom.

&gt;&gt; Phil.

Unfortunately, the cats do enjoy repeatedly spreading the soil around the
kitchen floor ;-) There are a variety of smells, including new ones right
in here that my cats enjoy everyday. They also smell each other right in
here too.

You also forget that in warmer seasons, my cats go out supervised on a
harness. But regardless my cat's sense of smell are all working just fine
thanks!

&gt; Hi Karen,
&gt; This isn't a reply to your post, I just wanted to make a couple of points
in
&gt; general. sorry.
&gt; In this country (UK) some cats are owned by pet lovers who would like a
pet
&gt; but are at work a lot. They choose a cat because they are more independant
&gt; and they have a cat door so they can come and go as they please. If they
get
&gt; bored they can go out, if the weathers bad they can snooze indoors.
&gt; If couples are at work all day I feel an indoor cat/s wouldn't have
enough
&gt; attention to make up for not going outside.
&gt; Also, There was a post on the uk cat ng from someone who moved to the
&gt; States . Her cat is unhappy indoors but her vet put pressure on her not to
&gt; let her cat out. Surely its up to her to decide, not her vet. I don't
think
&gt; a UK vet would put pressure on someone to let her cat out if they wanted
to
&gt; keep her in..
&gt; Alison

"/> Well, that's silly for a vet to do that. I've certainly never had one
pressure me. That would annoy me and I'm all for whatever is reasonable
under your circumstances. I've known quite a few vets and don't think any of
them would have done that. After all, it *is* a business too. Unless there
were factors in that area, of course. I myself quite agree it is a personal
and very important decision.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They have half-lives because they never have the opportunity to
&gt;&gt;&gt; experience the natural world they belong to or to use many of the
senses
&gt;&gt;&gt; and instincts they were born with. You only have to take the time to
&gt;&gt;&gt; seriously observe a cat in the outside world, to watch it communing
with
&gt;&gt;&gt; nature and interracting with the rest of the natural world, to see a
&gt;&gt;&gt; whole new set of behavioural patterns come into play.

&gt;&gt; My point is, that I grew up watching my cats outside. We had anywhere
from
&gt; 7
&gt;&gt; to 9 at one time. I spent much of my youth (7-18) in the backyard just
&gt;&gt; watching them. They stalked things and each other, played, they rested a
&gt;&gt; lot, slept a lot, came in to poop and went outside to sit. I watch my
cats
&gt;&gt; who are indoors now stalk things, stalk each other, play, they rest a
lot,
&gt;&gt; groom a lot. This is what I am telling you folks, they act the same,
they
&gt;&gt; appear to derive the same satisfaction from playing with their cat
dancer,
&gt;&gt; climbing their furniture, chasing each other at top speed around the
&gt; place,
&gt;&gt; play with their mousies and balls as the cats I grew up with did playing
&gt; in
&gt;&gt; the backyard. I can't call it a half life.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The domestic
&gt;&gt;&gt; moggie walks through the cat flap and a tiger emerges on the outside.

&gt;&gt; It's a lovely romantic image, but what practicality in the life of the
cat
&gt;&gt; does it really show? I still wonder what *you* have seen in cats that
are
&gt;&gt; raised indoor that makes them seem unhappy to you. That is the question
I
&gt; am
&gt;&gt; asking. Do the owners not take sufficient effort to provide new
challenges
&gt;&gt; and entertainment? heck, sometimes after a toy starts getting ignored
&gt; (i.e.
&gt;&gt; they are *bored* with it) you make it into something new. You get new
&gt; toys,
&gt;&gt; invent toys. They have grass to nibble on are energetic, playful. How is
&gt;&gt; that possible if they are living a &quot;half-life&quot;? Wouldn't you expect them
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; be listless or aggressive?

&gt;&gt;&gt; A few years ago a British team of behaviourists attached a camera to a
&gt;&gt;&gt; cat's collar before it left its home. They spent weeks following the
&gt;&gt;&gt; cat as best they could and analysing the footage that it brought back
&gt;&gt;&gt; each evening. The resulting film was fascinating and some of what
&gt;&gt;&gt; emerged amazed even those experienced naturalists who thought they
knew
&gt;&gt;&gt; the cat. It gave new insight into the true nature of what we believe
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be a domesticated animal.

&gt;&gt; It gives insight into how adaptable they are. How does it show they are
&gt;&gt; somehow &quot;less&quot; without it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a wild animal that kids us into giving it shelter, and a cat
&gt;&gt;&gt; that doesn't have the chance to be what it truly is doesn't live a
full
&gt;&gt;&gt; life any more than I would if I spent my entire life inside.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Alley Cat

&gt;&gt; I was really wondering, since you mentioned it, what indoor cats did
that
&gt;&gt; led you to the belief they are only half alive.

I know that they are highly encouraged to contain their cats either indoors
or in enclosed runs because of the feral problem and the impact on local
fauna. I've read a couple of really interesting articles on the New Zealand
Parks site. Just type it in to a search engine.

&gt;&gt;&gt; result. The depletion of Fuller's Earth reserves suggests that cat
&gt;&gt;&gt; litter usage is expanding, unless someone has found an innovative use
&gt;&gt;&gt; for it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Brits are known throughout Europe as animal lovers. We are less
&gt;&gt;&gt; kindly inclined towards our children. That's why there's a Royal
&gt;&gt;&gt; Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) but only a
&gt;&gt;&gt; National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

&gt;&gt; Thank you.. I have always wanted to visit England, and you have restored
&gt; my
&gt;&gt; faith in British pet owners.. :) I am NOT saying Brits who allow their
&gt; pets
&gt;&gt; outdoors,
&gt;&gt; or Yanks, or my fellow Canucks that do are bad.. but I had a hard time
&gt;&gt; believing
&gt;&gt; ALL England's pet owners believed that indoor cats are miserable
creatures
&gt;&gt; living
&gt;&gt; half lives.

have had this unique relationship - neither one as master, living
together because we both want to not because we keep them captive.
Sharing, for our mutual benefit, companionship.

Sure take a cat that has been shut in doors for years and throw it
out, or one who has been outside all its life and shut it in, and you
have one very stressed cat.

I've mentioned before that I quite often foster for my vets, taking in
short term cats whose owners are unable to look after them (usually
due to illness).

Usually keep them in for ten days to get them imprinted on the house,
but then they go out with mine.

Once, and only once, I had a cat who had not gone out before because
his owner lived on the 5th floor. It was born in that flat, lived
about 4 years there, poor thing had never seen grass before. As his
owner was going to sheltered accommodation in a small bungalow when
she left hospital we started to leave the back door open so he could
go out. Took him about a week to get used to the idea that outside was
just the sort of fun place he wanted.

Yes. I do believe that a cat which, when given the choice, does not go
out, does have a problem.

a safe life as well as a happy life. This can be accomplished by providing a

&quot;balance&quot;. Free roaming is one extreme - not a balance. No charge for the

grass

difficult concept for you to understand, right now, but when you advance to
the current times, I'm sure you'll make the same adaptations. Apparently

proven facts about cats throughout this thread, its obvious that my

by certified experts and responded with ludicrous remarks in absolute
opposition to provable and incontrovertible fact; you have made statements

spiteful, despicable ass. Your intent is not the health and wealfare of
cats or the indoor/outdoor issue - you're only objective is the active and
deliberate destruction of civilized discourse. You are a waste of space,
time, energy, oxygen, DNA and bandwidth.

you have 3MB space, anything over you pay $1 per MB for. I'm working on migrating them
though to my Crosswinds account, which is unlimited. ; ) Anyway, here's the link:
http://home.swbell.net/kwintjen/cats/

My baby (well, he's roughly 4 1/2 I think) is happy to be inside. I'm harness-training him,
and he seems to like that as well. That way he can go outside, and yet I know he won't lose
a fight w/ a raccoon, skunk, big dog, car, etc. He's still in the early stages yet, and
it's mostly cold here so he doesn't get to go out much yet. When he does he's still ready
to lead me inside after about 20 minutes, 10 if he decides he's too cold. Only thing is he
still kinda fights me buckling the harness. The idiot who put the buckle under the belly
where all the fur is, and so you have to have the cat on its back, was nuts. My parents
have a harness that of course goes around their belly just behind the elbows, but it still
buckles on top. But, alas, it's too small for my kitty. Mine's a little guy, but he weighs
about 10lbs so it just doesn't quite reach.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many

bite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wounds and abscesses, the result of aggressive behaviors.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Katherine Houpt - Director of the Behavior Clinic at Cornell

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That is true, something we accept as part of keeping a cat - because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it is part of the nature of the cat.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I suspect the quote from Katherine Houpt applies to ENTIRE toms. One
of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the benefits of neutering is that the animal fights much less, if at
&gt;&gt;&gt; all, and therefore rarely or never get fight injuries.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Castration is approximately 90 percent effective in eliminating roaming
and
&gt;&gt;fighting, although the disappearance of either roaming or fighting may
not
&gt;&gt;necessarily be associated with a decline in the other.&quot;
&gt;&gt;(Katherine Houpt - Director, Cornell Behavior Clinic)

&gt;&gt;The problem is not eliminated only by neutering your cat, an unneutered
tom
&gt;&gt;will defend his turf and can attack your cat.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If it applied to neuters as well I suspect those of us who keep more
&gt;&gt;&gt; than one cat would also have problems with our cats fighting with each
&gt;&gt;&gt; other and injuring each other, especially when a new cat or kitten is
&gt;&gt;&gt; being introduced.

&gt;&gt;Neutering greatly reduces, and in many cases, eliminates territorial
&gt;&gt;aggression and fighting in cats housed together. Four of my sister's 6
cats
&gt;&gt;are neutered males and the only occasional &quot;swat&quot; comes from the original
&gt;&gt;spayed *female*! However some people have cats that never get along,
others
&gt;&gt;have cats that &quot;tolerate&quot; each other, and others have cats who are one
big
&gt;&gt;happy family (like mine).

&gt; Two of mine are female from the same litter. They have always been
&gt; together. About once a month they have an argument - I think it
&gt; starts by one of them giving the other one a funny look. They circle
&gt; each other for a few minutes growling and then it's quiet again -
&gt; until next time.

"/> Most of the time, all mine get along - they even sleep *on* each other! I
think the most highly contested territory is the top of my monitor. If a
tail is not dangling blocking my view (good thing I used to box - I know how
to bob and weave so I can see the damn screen), its getting ambushed from
behind which sends the other one landing on my keyboard. Other than that,
they all have their special spots and get along (or tolerate) each other.

&gt; many of us provide for our cats. Plenty of toys, pots of grass, cat
&gt; furniture etc. In those cases, which I too have seen, one could easily say

life. Cobee is, at this moment,
tearing through the house in one of his playful kitty moods. He is full of
vim and vigor. All sleek, wiry
kitty grace.. Ally is a little pudgier, but has lots of energy and loves to
play, and be paid attention to.
If my cats were lethargic, depressed or listless I could agree that I am was
not giving them all

safe from a multitude of
dangers in the outdoors, but have not become sad creatures for the lack of
it..

Ally &amp; Cobee chase each other through the house all the time, but they love

when I get in on the action. It's great fun to them. And the best part is
that they KNOW they
are safe and it's just a game.. whereas if they were outside and something
were chasing them..

&gt; Hi Susan,

&gt; Not all cats brought in to shelters are genuine strays. Some cats tend to
&gt; hang around places they like. There was a case once where two families
went
&gt; to court over a cat they both believed they *owned*.
&gt; I suspect a lot of strays are dumped cats. Sadly ,even in this animal

"/> Good Morning, Alison! :)
Microchipping is getting really big here also. Almost all pets adopted out
are microchipped, but just as tattoo information goes, some owners never
update information when they move or give their pets away.

Granted, a number of pets at the SPCA are surrendered or abandoned, many
others
are stray (outside pets who wandered away from their homes and got lost).
And other
pets, who as you say, knew exactly where they were and decided to stay where
the
catgrass was greener..

drinking from the bathroom isn't as weird as you think. Cats are attracted
to the sound of running water, because instinctly they know that running
water is fresh water.

&gt; area which is potentially dangerous) ... but if I was the one who'd got a

&gt; provided protection to said puss and the puss had plenty of safe space, does
&gt; this mean that this breeder would still want me to say that my cat couldn't

"/> I would imagine so. Just as reputable dog breeders pretty much demand a
fenced yard... with very few exceptions.

These reputable breeders work very hard to improve the breeds they love and
work jsut as hard to find them quality safe homes - I was 'interviewed'
several times before I got the green light. The kittens are part of their
family for 12-14 weeks and they love each one, so I don't blame them for being
so strict. Just one of the many things which separate a quality breeder from
one who's in it for the cash.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Among other things, such as your conclusion from personal observation

&gt;their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own needs rather than the cat's. It would certainly be more convenient
&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a heck of a lot easier for me to forgo the litter box, the cat condos,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; harness training, etc. and kick my three cats out all day to roam
&gt;loose.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think most people who restrict their cat's roaming in the great
&gt;outdoors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; firmly believe that they are doing so for the cat - not themselves. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do, and I think I'm better qualified to determine my own motives for
&gt;&gt;&gt;doing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so than some stranger on a newsgroup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Too true. Although I did appreciate that Alley Cat was a lot less cruel
&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;opinionated
&gt;&gt;&gt;in her belief than Frank'n'Bob are, I do not believe my cats are
&gt;suffering
&gt;&gt;&gt;from staying indoors.

&gt;&gt; You know they used to say that about the kids sent down the coal
&gt;&gt; mines. Sometimes you turn off the perception of cruelty when you are
&gt;&gt; performing it.

&gt;&gt; Perceptions of cruelty change, especially as you learn more about the
&gt;&gt; animals you have.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It would be nice not to have to clean litter boxes, have a couch that
&gt;ISN'T
&gt;&gt;&gt;shredded, etc..
&gt;&gt;&gt;but my cats are worth every second of extra chores, and are more
&gt;important
&gt;&gt;&gt;than furniture.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Their health and well-being is more important to me than some so-called
&gt;need
&gt;&gt;&gt;to be outdoors.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I grew up with outdoor/indoor cats and like Karen, I see no difference in
&gt;&gt;&gt;their behaviour
&gt;&gt;&gt;than my indoor cats except that my indoor cats will not disappear or get
&gt;hit
&gt;&gt;&gt;by cars.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, I can't accept this at all because it makes an enormous

&gt;&gt;&gt; and cared for them as best we could.

&gt;&gt;Excuse me?? My cats have full run of an 1125 sq ft apartment. They
aren't
&gt;&gt;locked out of any room in this place! They also have access, if they
ever
&gt;&gt;would take it, to a 10 foot by 3 foot patio. So I'ld say that's HARDLY a
4
&gt;&gt;foot cage!! The Humane Society &amp; ASPCA both agree that this is more than
&gt;&gt;enough space for 3 cats to coexist happily. So until you come here to
&gt;&gt;inspect my cats &amp; their living enviroment, I'ld appreciate it if you
didn't
&gt;&gt;make assumptions.

&gt; No, it is a bigger cage - but still a cage. You cats can't get out of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Too true. Although I did appreciate that Alley Cat was a lot less

&gt;&gt;&gt; You know they used to say that about the kids sent down the coal

&gt;&gt;&gt; performing it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Perceptions of cruelty change, especially as you learn more about the
&gt;&gt;&gt; animals you have.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It would be nice not to have to clean litter boxes, have a couch that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but my cats are worth every second of extra chores, and are more

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Their health and well-being is more important to me than some
so-called
&gt;&gt;need

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I grew up with outdoor/indoor cats and like Karen, I see no difference
in

Yes, I know. (sigh...) I just wish people could stop being so vicious toward

&gt;&gt; I think we need to not make generalizations about the U.K. vs. the U.S. I
&gt; live
&gt;&gt; in the U.S. and many people here let their cats out -- and many don't.
&gt; It's an
&gt;&gt; individual choice, based on where you live, what the neighborhood is like,
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; what your personal beliefs are concerning letting your cat out. My sister
&gt; had a
&gt;&gt; cat that would have happily spent the rest of his life indoors if he could
&gt; (alas
&gt;&gt; he couldn't use a litter box and had to spend time outside when no one
&gt; would be
&gt;&gt; home for a while). I have two cats and both like going outside, one more
&gt; so than
&gt;&gt; the other - he throws fits if I don't let him out at least for an hour or
&gt; so
&gt;&gt; each day. I call him in frequently to make sure he's okay. I have a fairly
&gt; safe
&gt;&gt; area near my apartment so I feel alright letting him out. I am in the
&gt; process of
&gt;&gt; looking for a home with a good fenced in yard, though. Anyway, my point
&gt; is - no
&gt;&gt; one is going to win this argument, so can we please stop pointing fingers
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; accusing each other of not caring about our cats?? Because I think it's
&gt; safe to
&gt;&gt; say 99.9999% of us do - very much.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that would probably be true of most Brits. Keeping cats
&gt; indoors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here is generally considered to be very cruel.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Most Americans consider it cruel to expose cats to being hit by cars,
&gt; being
&gt;&gt;&gt; injured in cat fights, catching infections such as feline leukemia virus
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; feline immunodeficiency virus (Feline &quot;AIDS&quot;), being stolen and
&gt; tortured,
&gt;&gt;&gt; territorial disputes, threats from other animals, people, environmental
&gt;&gt;&gt; noises which cause panic, and situations which generate pure fear and
&gt;&gt;&gt; stress.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But that's in a country
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where it's safe for cats to have indoor/outdoor lives.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We seem to have either different interpretations of &quot;safe&quot; or value our
&gt; cats
&gt;&gt;&gt; much differently..

&gt;&gt;&gt; Having spent a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of time in the US I'm well aware of the very different dangers
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; North American cats face, so I do understand why so many of them are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kept indoors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having said that I have to admit that if there was a way of doing it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without having millions of healthy cats euthanised, I'd very much like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to see North Americans stop having cats at all if they can't go
&gt; outside

&gt;&gt;&gt; I know how you feel. I would very much like to see Brits stop having
&gt; cats
&gt;&gt;&gt; if they can't provide safe protected lives for their cats. I guess we
&gt; both
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to bite the bullet because neither of us will ever see our wishes
&gt; come
&gt;&gt;&gt; true.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because having seen a lot of indoor cats and having spent my entire
&gt; life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with indoor/outdoor cats I have absolutely no doubt that indoor cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; live half-lives.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You have not seen my cats or the millions of cats that are living
&gt; happily
&gt;&gt;&gt; and safely in protected environments. I have had both, indoor and
&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor/outdoor cats as well. The only difference between the two is
&gt; that my
&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor/protected cats are still alive. I have absolutely no doubt that
&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor/protected outdoor cats have a full life. If they are unhappy,
&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt; sure are doing a great job of fooling me, my vet and everyone else who
&gt; knows
&gt;&gt;&gt; them. I would think if there was any adverse effects of
&gt; indoor/protected
&gt;&gt;&gt; outdoor life, after ~20 years, some kind of evidence would be
&gt; detectable.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There is none.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That this is all most American owners can offer is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sad part of this, and I know that most of you do everything you can to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; provide full and entertaining lives for your cats.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sad for whom? Surely not my cats. However, I understand providing full
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; entertaining lives for our cats takes a bit of effort - a tad more than
&gt;&gt;&gt; swinging open a door - Oh, I forgot, many Brits don't even do that, they
&gt;&gt;&gt; have cat flaps - and no litter boxes....

&gt;&gt;&gt; In an ideal world,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though, I wish that there was a humane way for you to put the needs of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your cats above your wish to own them, and for the practise of keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor cats to cease.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In an ideal world, I'd like to see Brits put the health and safety of
&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt; cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated custom.

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, until someone comes up with a better way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than simply euthanising all those who can't find suitable
&gt; indoor/outdoor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; homes, I understand why this goes on.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Apparently, neither of us thinks the other should have cats. If all of
&gt; us,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and all of you didn't have cats, what would happen to all the cats?

&gt;&gt;&gt; But I have a more realistic, burning question: As stated by your fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt; countrymen, most Brits don't have litterboxes unless the cat is ill or
&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt; are kittens; your cats eliminate outdoors. Here's my burning question:
&gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt; you don't *see* your cats eliminate, how do you know when your cats have
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; urinary tract disorder or obstruction? Urinary tract obstruction can be
&gt;&gt;&gt; *fatal* for a male cat who doesn't urinate for more than 24-36 hours.
&gt; Male
&gt;&gt;&gt; cats that can't urinate can *die* from acute renal failure and/or severe
&gt;&gt;&gt; damage to the urinary bladder.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is another reason why I'd like to see Brits put the health and
&gt; safety
&gt;&gt;&gt; of their cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated
&gt; custom.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hi Becky,
&gt; I' ve heard of leash laws for cats. What is the reason for it? We have to
&gt; keep our dogs on a lead here on a public highway ( in my area at least)
but
&gt; not cats.
&gt; Alison

"/> My understanding was that the leash law was put out in our city because many
people were complaing about free roaming cats in their gardens and yards.
Unfortunately, unlike in the UK, not everyone is a cat lover. A cat in the
yard is seen as a violation of private property by many. They will not
hesitate to call animal control on the pet.

There were other factors as well. For instance, a lot of dog lovers were
complaing that cats did not have the same laws applied to them as dogs did.
If their dogs were not allowed off leash unless in designated areas, then
why was the neighbours cat allowed to roam free and pee in their rosebushes
etc.?

I have to clear up that I would have put my cats on lead anyway. I lived on
a very busy road with no traffic lights to slow traffic. It was a main
thoroughfare into the city during rush hours. I was not confident that my
boys would be 100% aware at all times of all the cars racing down the road.
I did not feel that I could trust other people to watch out for them. I
think that's one of the main differences between the UK and the US and
Canada. In the UK it is a culture of cat lovers that respect the cat, if not
absolutely adore it. They are probably more likely to go out of their ways
and watch out for a cat in the road. A lot of people here couldn't care
less. &quot;So what if there's a cat on the side of the road, I'm in a hurry to
get to work.&quot; seems to be the general feeling. We are talking about the land
of road rage, after all.

A lot of people think putting a cat on lead is cruel. My two are living
proof that if given time to get accustomed to it they can have fun out there
with a harness around them. I didn't start putting them on lead until they
were adults. I figured there would be a lot of problems with it. Can't teach
an old cat new tricks, or something like that. :-) But they took to it
eventually, and you wouldn't know by their romping around that they were
constricted.

I don't even take them for walks, per say. I put them on the harness and
leash, carry them out to the courtyard or sometimes take them to parks. Then
I sit down and let them do whatever the heck they want. Sometimes that means
they just lay in the grass and sleep, sometimes they're up and running
around, up trees, under benches. Wherever they want. I have an extendable
leash so they have quite a bit of room to roam. The only time I've stopped
them from doing whatever their little hearts desired was once when Chewie
ran straight for a road while chasing a bug of some sort.

I'm confident that they get to enjoy the outdoors but still be safe. My
ultimate goal is to have a large backyard outfitted for them so they can
explore and bask in the sun on their own terms. Until then, a lead and
harness is the next best thing.

&gt; I haven't heard of it either, but alot of our clients try to train new
&gt; kittens on to a leash as young
&gt; as possible. That way they can take them out for walks as an alternative
to
&gt; strictly indoors, or outdoors
&gt; unsupervised. I tried it with Ally, but she was already a year old and was
&gt; miserable with a leash on.

"/> Hi Susan,

We live in the same province. :-)

I started training the boys on lead when they were about three years old. I
just put the harness on them for a little while every day so they'd get used
to it. At first they didn't know what to make of it, and walked about
crouched over, trying to escape the harness. After a couple weeks of wearing
the harness every day they were used to it, and we graduated to putting the
leash on the harness. Keep in mind, this is all inside the apartment. I
wanted them used to the harness before I put them outside in it. One thing
at a time.

Once they were reasonably comfortable with the harness and leash on them, I
started taking them out into the apartment hallway. I found that once they
were in a new place with new smells and things to look at the harness became
less important. They were too busy exploring to care. My neighbours got a
real kick out of me walking up and down the hallways with two cats on lead
:-)

After a lot of training, and patience, I was able to take them outside. Some
cats will never take to it, though. Which is unfortunate, because I think
it's a very good way to allow your cat outside but keep them safe.

Doh! Why didn't I think of it sooner? Frank! FRANK!!! are you
paying attention? Okay, how about since you are the Worlds no. 1
Expert on cats, regarding which type of environment is best (meaning
your's of course) tell you what......

How about we (the USA) promptly send YOU personally all of our poor
homeless kitties living in shelters (and are at risk of being adopted
by someone who may want to keep them indoors) and we can all breathe a
big sigh of relief. Those kitties will finally be able to live a life
(as you put it) &quot;best for the cats&quot; and we'll all live happily ever
after.

But one word of caution......you had better hope like hell not ONE of
those precious babies falls victim to a car, a demented torturous
human, a dog, or a disease, because if that were to happen, we'd be
forced to open up a BIG can of whoop ass on you.

Now! Make haste! You've got a lot of work ahead of you

"/> Hi Becky. I think I just didn't try long enough. I only tried it a half
dozen times and that was
putting the harness and leash on all at once and taking her outside. She was
completely freaked out.
I think I will keep them strictly inside, but if I do decided to go to
harnass and leash I will definitely
follow your sensible advice!

&gt;they're still just on Kodak paper. Besides, it's at Southwestern Bell, and they only let
&gt;you have 3MB space, anything over you pay $1 per MB for. I'm working on migrating them

&gt;&gt;Hi Jeanne..

&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with what you say that some people think you are cruel if you
keep
&gt;&gt;&gt; you cats indoors. I seem to spend most of my time having to justify why
I
&gt;&gt;&gt; keep my cats indoors, and for everyone out there I want you to know it
is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not that I am being cruel. I had Penny from a kitten and although I
tried
&gt;&gt;&gt; many times to take her outside she was just too scared and the vet said
it
&gt;&gt;&gt; was being MORE cruel to force her outside. Daffy then came along as a
&gt;&gt;&gt; rescued cat and she had been so badly abused she did not want to go
out,
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably of fear that she would be kicked again! So because of these
&gt;&gt;&gt; circumstances I decided that my cats were meant to be indoors and thus
I
&gt;&gt;&gt; have catered for their outside needs inside eg a climbing frame that
&gt;&gt;reaches
&gt;&gt;&gt; from floor to ceiling etc. My cats are very content and they do go
outside
&gt;&gt;&gt; into the backgarden accompanied so that they can get fresh air but feel
&gt;&gt;safe
&gt;&gt;&gt; and secure. I also feel after being a cat owner for a while now that
even
&gt;&gt;&gt; if my cats were not scared of the big bad world outside I would not let
&gt;&gt;them
&gt;&gt;&gt; into it, ask yourselves this question would you let a dog roam the
streets
&gt;&gt;&gt; unaccompanied to get hurt and into trouble, well I bet the answer is
No,
&gt;&gt;so
&gt;&gt;&gt; why should it be different for cats(from what I have seen and heard
they
&gt;&gt;are
&gt;&gt;&gt; no more streetwise!)

&gt;&gt;My Ally was a stray cat when I adopted her from the SPCA. She was in the
&gt;&gt;SPCA
&gt;&gt;Hospital, sick and lost. After I adopted her I chose not to let her go
&gt;&gt;outside because
&gt;&gt;I weighed the pros and cons. (I got Cobee as a kitten and I assume he has
&gt;&gt;always
&gt;&gt;been indoors).As I said, I work for the SPCA Hospital. I see soooo many
&gt;&gt;sick and injured and DEAD cats and dogs come through the doors every day.
I
&gt;&gt;also
&gt;&gt;remembered the cats I had growing up.. of the 3 outdoor cats we had 2
went
&gt;&gt;missing in the
&gt;&gt;first year. (The 1st was kept in a very quiet neighborhood). I choose to
&gt;&gt;keep my cats
&gt;&gt;indoors because I have thought long and hard about it. I see that my cats
&gt;&gt;are healthy (verified by vets),
&gt;&gt;content and happy. I do not presume to say ALL should do the same, but it
&gt;&gt;works for me and my kitties.

&gt;&gt;Susan

&gt; The question is - why do you have cats?

&gt;
&gt; They have half-lives because they never have the opportunity to

I'm interested in knowing exactly which senses and instincts a cat is

obviously one instinct has been deprived. Of course this doesn't relate to
the indoor/outdoor issue.

i have plenty of chasy games in the yard with my cats, and i believe they enjoy plenty!!
&quot;I think a benefit to having an indoor cat is that you have much more
interaction with them.
Ally &amp; Cobee chase each other through the house all the time, but they love
it (especially Cobee)
when I get in on the action. It's great fun to them. And the best part is
that they KNOW they
are safe and it's just a game.. whereas if they were outside and something
were chasing them..
well.. I don't think they would be enjoying it as much!

&quot;put the health and safety
of their cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated custom.&quot;

Phil.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---

natural, biological urges are neither ancient nor outdated customs - the fact is, probably over 95% (or more) of cats, given the choice would choose to live having free, unrestrained access to the outdoors. but then, we humans decide that we have the right to make that decision for them, don't we? in the name of protecting them?? in the name of our desire to have them as adored pets? in the name of protecting other species?? the environment?? this has been one scintillating debate going on around here.....

My 3 cats are all indoor and they live good lives. Our youngest cat
was only about 10 weeks old when she turned up on our doorstep and
after we took her in, she has never once, in the 2 years since, ever
showed and interest in going out no matter how long my kids dawdle
with the door open, even in summer.
(I might add, 2 days after we took in our youngest, we discovered 3 of
her little siblings all crushed at the road side a 2 minute walk from
our house).
Quite often our neighbors little one year old tabby goes nose to nose
with mine with a pane of glass between..(there are never growls or ill

house looking inside through the windows than at her house, where she
gets ignored....

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we need to not make generalizations about the U.K. vs. the
U.S. I
&gt;&gt; live
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the U.S. and many people here let their cats out -- and many don't.
&gt;&gt; It's an
&gt;&gt;&gt; individual choice, based on where you live, what the neighborhood is
like,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; what your personal beliefs are concerning letting your cat out. My
sister
&gt;&gt; had a
&gt;&gt;&gt; cat that would have happily spent the rest of his life indoors if he
could
&gt;&gt; (alas
&gt;&gt;&gt; he couldn't use a litter box and had to spend time outside when no one
&gt;&gt; would be
&gt;&gt;&gt; home for a while). I have two cats and both like going outside, one
more
&gt;&gt; so than
&gt;&gt;&gt; the other - he throws fits if I don't let him out at least for an hour
or
&gt;&gt; so
&gt;&gt;&gt; each day. I call him in frequently to make sure he's okay. I have a
fairly
&gt;&gt; safe
&gt;&gt;&gt; area near my apartment so I feel alright letting him out. I am in the
&gt;&gt; process of
&gt;&gt;&gt; looking for a home with a good fenced in yard, though. Anyway, my
point
&gt;&gt; is - no
&gt;&gt;&gt; one is going to win this argument, so can we please stop pointing
fingers
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; accusing each other of not caring about our cats?? Because I think
it's
&gt;&gt; safe to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cruel and don't deserve cats. :(

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that would probably be true of most Brits. Keeping cats
&gt;&gt; indoors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here is generally considered to be very cruel.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most Americans consider it cruel to expose cats to being hit by
cars,
&gt;&gt; being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; injured in cat fights, catching infections such as feline leukemia
virus
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feline immunodeficiency virus (Feline &quot;AIDS&quot;), being stolen and
&gt;&gt; tortured,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; territorial disputes, threats from other animals, people,
environmental
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; noises which cause panic, and situations which generate pure fear
and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stress.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But that's in a country
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where it's safe for cats to have indoor/outdoor lives.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We seem to have either different interpretations of &quot;safe&quot; or value
our
&gt;&gt; cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much differently..

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having spent a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of time in the US I'm well aware of the very different dangers
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; North American cats face, so I do understand why so many of them
are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kept indoors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having said that I have to admit that if there was a way of doing
it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without having millions of healthy cats euthanised, I'd very much
like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to see North Americans stop having cats at all if they can't go
&gt;&gt; outside

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know how you feel. I would very much like to see Brits stop
having
&gt;&gt; cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if they can't provide safe protected lives for their cats. I guess
we
&gt;&gt; both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have to bite the bullet because neither of us will ever see our
wishes
&gt;&gt; come
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; true.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because having seen a lot of indoor cats and having spent my
entire
&gt;&gt; life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with indoor/outdoor cats I have absolutely no doubt that indoor
cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; live half-lives.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have not seen my cats or the millions of cats that are living
&gt;&gt; happily
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and safely in protected environments. I have had both, indoor and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor/outdoor cats as well. The only difference between the two is
&gt;&gt; that my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor/protected cats are still alive. I have absolutely no doubt
that
&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor/protected outdoor cats have a full life. If they are
unhappy,
&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sure are doing a great job of fooling me, my vet and everyone else
who
&gt;&gt; knows
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them. I would think if there was any adverse effects of
&gt;&gt; indoor/protected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; outdoor life, after ~20 years, some kind of evidence would be
&gt;&gt; detectable.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is none.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That this is all most American owners can offer is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sad part of this, and I know that most of you do everything you
can to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; provide full and entertaining lives for your cats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sad for whom? Surely not my cats. However, I understand providing
full
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entertaining lives for our cats takes a bit of effort - a tad more
than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swinging open a door - Oh, I forgot, many Brits don't even do that,
they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have cat flaps - and no litter boxes....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In an ideal world,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though, I wish that there was a humane way for you to put the
needs of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your cats above your wish to own them, and for the practise of
keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor cats to cease.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In an ideal world, I'd like to see Brits put the health and safety
of
&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated custom.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, until someone comes up with a better way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than simply euthanising all those who can't find suitable
&gt;&gt; indoor/outdoor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; homes, I understand why this goes on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Apparently, neither of us thinks the other should have cats. If all
of
&gt;&gt; us,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and all of you didn't have cats, what would happen to all the cats?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I have a more realistic, burning question: As stated by your
fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; countrymen, most Brits don't have litterboxes unless the cat is ill
or
&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are kittens; your cats eliminate outdoors. Here's my burning
question:
&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you don't *see* your cats eliminate, how do you know when your cats
have
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; urinary tract disorder or obstruction? Urinary tract obstruction
can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *fatal* for a male cat who doesn't urinate for more than 24-36
hours.
&gt;&gt; Male
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cats that can't urinate can *die* from acute renal failure and/or
severe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; damage to the urinary bladder.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is another reason why I'd like to see Brits put the health and
&gt;&gt; safety
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of their cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated
&gt;&gt; custom.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Phil.

"/> I'm going to answer my own question! I ve just heard from someone in
Australia and she said:

:Oh good topic. Well over here it's nothing to do with what you think of
your
cat. Because we are still such a new country we all (well most) care a great
deal about our native wildlife. So therefore most cats are brought in at
night to protect the little bandicoots, birds etc and when they are out
during the day they wear bells. We have a lot of feral cats also. In some
states it is the law to keep your cat in at night, and I think some are
trying to make it an all day thing too. Australia is still trying to come to
terms with the settlers who brought over foxes and rabbits etc., that have
killed lots of native animals. Ultimately it has a big knock on effect
aswell because if there aren't enough small animals for the larger natives
to eat, and so on and so forth.:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Brits are known throughout Europe as animal lovers. We are less

"/> Maybe so, but is it a real risk? One that is worth keeping cats in to
avoid - no. Antifreeze can be, and it appears often is even in the

animals. No difference in cost I would expect, so why not campaign to
make sure everyone uses it?

And poison plants seem to be more of an indoor problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;LOL!

&gt;&gt;&gt;They're a little different.

&gt;cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;have unlimited access to the outdoors - complete with trees to climb,
&gt;grass
&gt;&gt;&gt;to roll around and nibble on, butterflies to chase. As much of a shock
&gt;as
&gt;&gt;&gt;this may be to you, my cats are indeed quite happy and healthy.

&gt;They don't! That's why my cats don't contract fatal diseases like FeLV, FIV,
&gt;FIP, Rabies, or get into cat fights or sustain injuries. Not to mention
&gt;local ordinances prohibit free-roaming animals. But since cats are
&gt;naturally asocial and solitary (as I have definitively proven), its not a
&gt;problem for them.

"/> Phil. You continue to carry on this totally daft and ridiculous idea

&gt;&gt; behaving or acting, or a particular established way of behaving&quot;.

&gt;It seems more like an &quot;habitual practice&quot; if not &quot;robotic&quot; to me.

&gt;But
&gt;&gt; a custom based on hundreds, if not thousands of years of keeping cats.
&gt;&gt; Now as the cats have not evolved into new creatures in the last 30
&gt;&gt; years - so why change customs that work?

&gt;Letting cats and dogs out loose used to be a custom here, too. But times
&gt;and environments have changed so, in many places, we have to put the health
&gt;and welfare of our cats before some ritualistic custom that was once
&gt;acceptable 20 or 30 years ago and adapt to modern times.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Joking apart though, there are many cat owners in the UK whose cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are strictly indoor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not many. When I asked Battersea last year their estimate for central
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;London was &lt;20%, and for London (inside the M25) &lt;10%.

&gt;&gt;&gt;With all due respect to the good people at Battersea Dogs' Home - two
&gt;&gt;&gt;of my three cats came from there - their rehoming policies are biased
&gt;&gt;&gt;towards people with gardens. Their perception of the proportion of
&gt;&gt;&gt;London cats that are indoor may be distorted.

&gt;&gt;Biased in the sense that they strongly leaning towards homing healthy
&gt;&gt;cats in homes where they can get out at least part of the day.
&gt;&gt;Something the recognize is good for the cat.

&gt;It seems that sometimes they would prefer to keep a cat in a cage
&gt;rather than rehome him/her with someone who will keep the cat indoors.
&gt;The RSPCA Mayhew Home in Kensal Green is even worse.

"/> I'm sure they would prefer to wait a few weeks more for the right sort
of home. There are always a few cats that will suit an indoor only
home, but only a small number.

someone told me once that neutered cats sometimes still engage in sexual
activity - i have no idea????

Well, I can't say for all male cats, but my Cobee got neutered at 5 1/2
months and he hasn't ever tried
anything like that on Ally (spayed female) .. then again, I did get him
neutered before he hit puberty.

Hello NG:

What a great debate! We were adopted by a Tuxedo alley cat and ended up
making him a house cat. Got him fixed and all of the required shot's. Also
had him declawed in front to protect our well-being, as he can be
tempermental. The only time he is out side now is when he is supervised by
us. The law here in Amarillo Texas is leash for cats and dogs although dogs
can be off the leash as long as they are in sight and controlled.

We found out that Whiskers had Feline HIV after having for a year and he
developed a sore throat. He is on oral interferon and antibiotics daily.

My question to you is: would he be better outside and untreated (and
infecting other cats) or inside where he is pampered, spoiled and RULES?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi Jeanne..

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with what you say that some people think you are cruel if you
&gt; keep
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you cats indoors. I seem to spend most of my time having to justify
why
&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keep my cats indoors, and for everyone out there I want you to know
it
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not that I am being cruel. I had Penny from a kitten and although I
&gt; tried
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many times to take her outside she was just too scared and the vet
said
&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was being MORE cruel to force her outside. Daffy then came along as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rescued cat and she had been so badly abused she did not want to go
&gt; out,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probably of fear that she would be kicked again! So because of these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; circumstances I decided that my cats were meant to be indoors and
thus
&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have catered for their outside needs inside eg a climbing frame that
&gt;&gt;&gt;reaches
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from floor to ceiling etc. My cats are very content and they do go
&gt; outside
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into the backgarden accompanied so that they can get fresh air but
feel
&gt;&gt;&gt;safe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and secure. I also feel after being a cat owner for a while now that
&gt; even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if my cats were not scared of the big bad world outside I would not
let
&gt;&gt;&gt;them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into it, ask yourselves this question would you let a dog roam the
&gt; streets
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unaccompanied to get hurt and into trouble, well I bet the answer is
&gt; No,
&gt;&gt;&gt;so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; why should it be different for cats(from what I have seen and heard
&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no more streetwise!)

&gt;&gt;&gt;My Ally was a stray cat when I adopted her from the SPCA. She was in
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;SPCA
&gt;&gt;&gt;Hospital, sick and lost. After I adopted her I chose not to let her go
&gt;&gt;&gt;outside because
&gt;&gt;&gt;I weighed the pros and cons. (I got Cobee as a kitten and I assume he
has
&gt;&gt;&gt;always
&gt;&gt;&gt;been indoors).As I said, I work for the SPCA Hospital. I see soooo many
&gt;&gt;&gt;sick and injured and DEAD cats and dogs come through the doors every
day.
&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;also
&gt;&gt;&gt;remembered the cats I had growing up.. of the 3 outdoor cats we had 2
&gt; went
&gt;&gt;&gt;missing in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;first year. (The 1st was kept in a very quiet neighborhood). I choose
to
&gt;&gt;&gt;keep my cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;indoors because I have thought long and hard about it. I see that my
cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;are healthy (verified by vets),
&gt;&gt;&gt;content and happy. I do not presume to say ALL should do the same, but
it
&gt;&gt;&gt;works for me and my kitties.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Susan

&gt;&gt; The question is - why do you have cats?

Cats, you ignoramus have *some* color vision -- not *&quot;full&quot;* color vision -
and use their cones for greater visual discrimination rather than color
vision.

Your &quot;common sense&quot; and &quot;logic&quot; isn't worth much around here, so unless you

&gt;-&gt;My 3 cats are all indoor and they live good lives. Our youngest cat
&gt;-&gt;was only about 10 weeks old when she turned up on our doorstep and
&gt;-&gt;after we took her in, she has never once, in the 2 years since, ever
&gt;-&gt;showed and interest in going out no matter how long my kids dawdle
&gt;-&gt;with the door open, even in summer.
&gt;-
&gt;-Why do I find this so very hard to believe - oh yes, I know cats.

Believe what you want - and obviously you don't know cats that well
to be able to judge mine .....

despite my own view on this debate, a possible reason for the younger cat showing no interest in going outdoors is probably 2 things: previous trauma experienced outdoors, plus following the lead of the other 2 cats in the household, particularly as she was a younger cat modelling her behavious on the older cats around, who have accepted that outdoors is a no-go zone. just a thought, anyway.

&quot;Outdoor cats on the street, or even in the country, are faced every day with
territorial disputes, threats from other animals, people,
environmental noises which cause panic, and situations which generate pure
fear and stress.

Its a well known ***FACT*** that
cats are asocial! Well known to the rest of the world but you.

where the heck did you come up with that???? cats a-social??? sorry mate, but that just ain't true! that statement is completely false. cats are incredibly social, just cause they don't wag there tails and run up to eachother licking eachother's faces or shaking paws doesn't mean anything. cats, as i'm sure you are aware, are highly communicative, and not just with their human owners. cats meet cats out in the night/day who they've never come across before, and sometimes they'll 'dislike' eachother, and other times will become the best of buddies! that's not a-social, in fact, i'd go so far as to say that that examples a complex system of socialisation. bears may be loners most of their life, but they too are biologically programmed to socilaize quite deliberately with other bears in specific ways for specific needs.

no offence, but i had to add that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And I would like Americans to recognize that the cat is an ANIMAL, not
&gt;&gt;&gt; a soft toy, not a child. Animals NEED (get that Phil, NEED)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have already proven, ad nauseam, that cats *do not* &quot;need&quot; to roam
free...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; given as natural an environment as possible to avoid stress.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;An outdoor cat lives a more stressful life than an indoor cat. The
&gt;&gt;environment you're providing for your cats is *more* stressful than ours!
&gt;
&gt; Rubbish. How can you possibly work that out?

Outdoor cats on the street, or even in the country, are faced every day with
territorial disputes, threats from other animals, people, cars,
environmental noises which cause panic, and situations which generate pure
fear and stress. Indoor cats generally live longer, healthier and happier
lives than outdoor cats. That's how. Got it this time????

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Open your eyes, man! Your sad devotion to an ancient and outdated
&gt;&gt;ritualistic custom has blinded you from reality. So, realistically, the
&gt;&gt;time is gone when we can debate about where cats should live. The cats
are
&gt;&gt;here, now, and we are responsible for them.
&gt;
&gt; And a very important part of that responsibility is to give them the
&gt; best lifestyle we can.

Exposing them to unnecessary risks and dangers is *not* being responsibile
or giving the best lifestyle we can.

Cats have very complex needs, many of which
&gt; CANNOT be met when the cat is kept in a human home 24/7.

You really don't know cats as well as you think you do. Cats sleep most of
the day; most of their waking hours are spent grooming, eating and lying in
the sun. They're perfectly content doing all those things in a protected
environment.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;The crowding experienced in an urban setting thus creates many
territorial
&gt;&gt;disputes, with fighting among intact males being a very common problem.
&gt;
&gt; Fighting amongst cats is part of nature. Most of the time it will only
&gt; occur for short periods while a cats is establishing his/her position
&gt; within the local cats social structure.

Why unnecessarily subject your cat to bite wounds, abscesses, loss of an
eye, stress of territorial disputes, transmission of lethal, infectoius
diseases, when they can have their own protected area? You make absolutely
no sense. Your sad devotion to some ancient, ritualistic custom is truly
pathetic. You actually seem programmed... almost robotic with your
replies... New name &quot;Robo Bobo&quot;. LOL!

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Many
&gt;&gt;toms are repeatedly presented to the veterinarian for treatment of bite
&gt;&gt;wounds and abscesses, the result of aggressive behaviors.&quot;
&gt;&gt;Katherine Houpt - Director of the Behavior Clinic at Cornell
&gt;
&gt; That is true, something we accept as part of keeping a cat - because
&gt; it is part of the nature of the cat.

*You* can accept unnecessary bite wounds, abscesses, loss of an eye, stress
of territorial disputes, transmission of lethal, infectoius diseases, but I
won't. That &quot;part of the nature of the cat&quot; can be safely fulfilled in a
protected environment.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt; them in MAY be protecting them from some things, and nobody is saying
&gt;&gt;&gt; that cats should be thrown out onto a multi lane highway. However
&gt;&gt;&gt; keeping them in not a fair option - it is a very selfish option.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Actually, allowing cats to roam free is a *much* more selfish and lazy
&gt;&gt;option! You're not burdened with providing a stimulating and enjoyable
&gt;&gt;environment - you don't even want to be burdened with a litter box!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; No animal expert in their right mind would say it is better to keep an
&gt;&gt;&gt; animal caged - no matter how big and well appointed the cage is.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Here are four, who, according to you, must not be &quot;in their right mind&quot;:
&gt;
&gt; Yes, unless you have taken what they say out of context, I firmly
&gt; believe that they are wrong and that the go against the vast body of
&gt; zoologists, animal behavourists and above all common sense.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Although not a group hunter, the cat retains an enormous capacity to be
&gt;&gt;sociable and accepts the benefits of living in the human family and den
&gt;&gt;without compromising its self-determining and independent behaviour.&quot;
&gt;&gt;Peter Neville - Feline Behaviorist (and Brit) (Manual of Feline
Behaviour)
&gt;
&gt; That statement says nothing about not allowing a cat out.

Its doesn't say the cat must roam free, now does it?. It says the cat can
live &quot;in the human family and den without compromising its self-determining
and independent behaviour.&quot; That's clear enough for me!

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Although cats are considered to be asocial, they have the ability to
adapt
&gt;&gt;to confinement with other cats, and can be kept together in a relatively
&gt;&gt;small colony pen where they appear rather indifferent to each other.&quot;
&gt;&gt;Benjamin Hart - Feline Behaviorist (Canine and feline behavioral
therapy)
&gt;
&gt; Cats are not asocial unless in areas where the food resources are low
&gt; and they are forced to roam over a large area just to eat.

Jezzz you're obtuse! Cats *are* asocial but can adapt. Produce evidence to
the contrary - none of your &quot;common sense&quot; because its not &quot;common&quot;; you're
the only one who has that peculiar brand. Its a well known ***FACT*** that
cats are asocial! Well known to the rest of the world but you.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Cats can be happily kept inside all the time. Many people do so and
would
&gt;&gt;have it no other way. They say they have deeper and more satisfying
&gt;&gt;relationships with their cats and that those cats are healthier and live
&gt;&gt;longer. While living happily inside, cats are not getting hit by cars,
being
&gt;&gt;injured in cat fights, catching infections such as feline leukemia virus
and
&gt;&gt;feline immunodeficiency virus (Feline &quot;AIDS&quot;), being stolen, hunting and
&gt;&gt;possibly killing wildlife, urinating and defecating on neighbors'
&gt;&gt;properties, and harassing or being harassed by other animals. Clearly
there
&gt;&gt;are many good reasons for permanently keeping cats indoors.&quot;
&gt;&gt;Robert J. Holmes, BVM&amp;S, PhD, MRCVS, FACVSc -Feline Behaviorist --- and
Brit
&gt;
&gt; He is clearly wrong in his first statement. Shows the selfishness of
&gt; some humans in first part of the third sentence and then compounds his
&gt; error with a blatant untruth in the second half of the third sentence.
&gt; The paragraph contains sufficient untrue information to render its
&gt; entire contents useless.

Wrong, Bob. I think most people will give Robert J. Holmes, BVM&amp;S, PhD,
MRCVS, FACVSc -a Feline Behaviorist enormously more credibility than they'll
give you. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you look disputing *6* feline
behaviorists? This is one of the reasons why no one in this group respects
you. You think you're right and everyone else, including experts are wrong!

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Sure, ideally, cats should have access to both the cozy indoors and, if
not
&gt;&gt;the open countryside, at least to protected outdoor areas. But the time
has
&gt;&gt;passed when they can safely roam, even in most rural areas. Cats do not
&gt;&gt;necessarily suffer from confinement. In fact, a major difference of
indoor
&gt;&gt;cats is that they enjoy longer and healthier lives than their
counterparts
&gt;&gt;on the street, in the yard, or on the farm. Many of the reservations
people
&gt;&gt;have about keeping cats indoors may stem from mistaken notions about the
&gt;&gt;nature of cats.&quot; (Like yours) Patricia Curtis - Animal Behaviorist
&gt;
&gt; She may believe that the time is past - I believe that is based on the
&gt; erroneous information and downright lies that have been spread about
&gt; the dangers to cats in the USA. However, clearly her comments about
&gt; the nature of cats shows she knows little about cats.

Ahhhh, you know more than a feline behaviorist - *6* feline behaviorists ???
I see. Maybe they should sue their colleges for a refund and study under
you??? &quot;Professor Bob&quot;. ROTFLMAO!!!

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Are you *that* egocentric and egomaniacal that you actually believe we'll
&gt;&gt;talk your word over that of feline behavioral experts??? Say it isn't
so!
&gt;
&gt; I will go with the body of knowledge

That you have ****FAILED**** to produce.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;2) An outdoor cat lives a more stressful life than an indoor cat.
&gt;
&gt; Not if introduced to that environment from the start and provided with
&gt; what it considers safe places to sleep, groom or just loaf when it
&gt; wants to.

...all of which it is thoroughly content to do in a protected environment

&gt;The difference is that the cat controls itself.

But the cat can't control cars, trucks, buses, environmental dangers,
infectious diseases...... give it up. You lost a long time ago.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;3) I have produced proof, ad nauseam, that prepubertal gonadectomy
&gt;&gt; produces **less** adverse effects than neutering at the traditional
&gt;&gt; age.
&gt;
&gt; The jury is still out on that. Outside of the USA vets are, in
&gt; general, still very doubtful of the benefits you claim.

The jury has been back and the verdict has been in for years. There's an
example of the behind-the-times British veterinary medicine that you brag
about.

oh that's right, cats evolved indoors, have always lived indoors, except when these crazy folk decided a few years ago that putting them outside might be an interesting idea! c'mon, try telling the cats who choose to have access to the garden that they're clinging to an archaic and antiquated custom! oops, that's right, cats are mere animals who aren't as sophisticated as us humans who can sometimes read books!!! surely that gives us the right to assume the role of dominant species on this planet - god knows where doing such a great job at it!

i'm in australia too.

there are definately issues over here regarding cats not being a native animal to our country and of having to protect the native wildlife from them. therefore responsible ownership is talked about often here. cats wearing bells to protect native birds, keeping them in for most of the night. not many people keep cats indoors permanently compared to the numbers that have access to the outdoors, although it does happen on occassion where people live in apartment block (we have huge areas of suburbia compared to cities in america and the UK).

most people i know wouldn't like to keep their cats from going outdoors from time to time, especially because we live in such an 'outdoors' country with the weather even encouraging outdoor fun nearly all year round.

it sounds to me like our country is a &quot;safer&quot; place, even though we have our share of feline deaths due to accidents etc, but isn't death a way of life? it's a funny balance between loving protection and living in a bubble from our cruel, cruel world, kind of.

it's clear to me that everybody here loves their cats, and feels that they are providing them with the environment that is adequate, but i'm just sad that we have to alter what nature intended, because of what we are afraid the 'human' constructed world will do to us (and the beloved animals who live with us). i know it's true that we don't live in a 'natural' world anymore, and it could be viewed as romantic or even hypocritical to hold to that ideal....

one thing though, just because we paid human money for these animals, and took good care of them by going to the vet and feed them each morning/day doesn't mean that we own them. we never never own another living creature, and we ought to remember that always. what would thet cats choose if given the choice? (probably not to live the modern day world we have now, i'm thinking - just cause they're domesticated doesn't mean that they prefer a safer environment to the old world of mountains, drought, illness, injury, fornicating, sleeping in the sun by a river/pond..... )

how do we answer this question?

what would the cats prefer? what would they choose? how do we find that out? how do we ask?

i'm not sure.

i would just like to sincerely apologise; i thought that these 2 karens were the same, which they are not!

i agree with karen McGill (first one) that this debate needs to maintain integrity.

again, my apologies for confusing these 2 statements as coming from the same person!

kt
Yes, I know. (sigh...) I just wish people could stop being so vicious toward
each other and debate the issues politely. There really isn't a clear-cut
&quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; in many cases, just opinion -- though some more thought out
than others.... :)

problem for them.

i've read the entire posting, and cats in the wild have a social existence and interactions of significance; besides, wild cats are not what we're talking about, we're talking about letting muffy and fluffy mix with the other cats in the neighbourhood!

Not *all* of the posts were in this thread. They weren't talking about
wildcats either. There are several postings of Bob saying cats *need* to
socialize with up towards 50 other cats as ferals do basically. Phil posted
citations from 6 experts denoting that colonies form due to a centralized
location of food and shelter but it is dependant on those factors,
socialization is a result as is then pecking order and such. Bob has
blatantly said the experts don't know what they are talking about and that
he knows more. So unless you go back and read postings from several threads
from the last few weeks, you *don't* have the whole story.

one of my girls, pinky, likes to drink out of the small bathroom basin so much, that afterward she will curl up inside it (just fitting!) and relax for a while there (till i chase her out) - like an attachmnet to her favourite watering-hole! she still drinks from her water bowl, too, though. shushu however has not once curled up inside the basin - not her style!

where is that?? i'm curious...

hey, i know the air around here has been tense of late, but i'm not looking for a fight! i accept that you have info regarding the socialbility of cats from said experts, and i'm interested in sussing this out, also. i have read approximately 85% of this posting, and i shall continue exploring the arguement, but please don't include in me in the 'live-one' category for having a varying opinion.

i read and comprehend very well, thank you, and i'll get back to you after i've perused the facts.

geese, this is like a debate on the existence of GOD, the people are so jittery...

&gt;cats a-social??? sorry &gt;mate, but that just ain't true! that statement is

I'm sure Peter Neville (UK), Bonnie Beaver, Katherine Houpt (Director of the
Behavior Clinic at Cornell), Benjamin and Lynette Hart (UC-Davis), Robert J.

Re: The Great Debate - Indoors Vs. Outdoorswell, i am new around here - only started looking at this NG last night, and what an introduction!! i have never seen a topic go like this!! is it common around here? anyway, it has been interesting, to say the least...

but, like i have always said, i shan't be passing any judgement on anyone who chooses to keep their cats indoors, even if i have varying opinions. what's the most important is that the cats are truly loved and are not being hurt at all, right!

but i think it is ok for paople to have different ideas, too!

back to the real deal - i have 2 lovely kittens who i bought to replace my first cat who i sadly had to put down in july 2000. their names are pinky and shushu, and they moggie sisters who apparaently have tabbie and blue burmese in them.

today is their big day for the operation, and they are almost 6 mths old, and soo cute and loving and adorable (as all of our cats are!!). i have some awesome pics, which i'll post sometime soon - one of my cats is cross-eyed and it is a very cute sight to behold!

how about yours?

Re: bah - the rebuttalWell here in the good ole USA, which is where our lovely debate over

am bound by contract (as well as conscience) to keep him indoors.

with

crikey!! 25!!! a-mazing age - that's more than twice the age of when my old girl, penn had to be put down!! wow.

:)

I have three, a purrrson , a siamese, and a SnowShoe (siamese like,
but with white markings)
The Purrrrrson Comit is out &quot;old man&quot; he is 25 and acts like a kitten.
Our &quot;lap cat&quot; is Tacha, a siamese young lady, 10 years old
Our &quot;warrior&quot; the baby is Sam, he is only 5 years old.

Comit lives up to his name and runs around the house in a white
BLURRR.
Tasha, makes sure the water dish is clean, and lets you know it when
you forget to keep it that way.
Sam is fightsty, loves being played with, and won't let you get away
with not giving him due attention. He thinks himself to be the king of
the house
Wish my computer was set-up for sending pictures, I would LOVE to show
my cats off--- get a little green with envy when I see the pictures of
other people's sweet balls of fur here.

You sound like you have some wonderful kitties. Not to make you jealous or anything, but I
did just start putting up a webpage again and that's the first thing I did, was to put up
cat pictures I'd taken and scanned. I've got pictures of 3 cats there, one I met while at
school, another is my parents' 2nd cat (mine too, I guess), and the third is my furbaby.
(He's curled up in the middle of the beanbag chair right now! How adorable!) I have a lot
more pictures of my cat, but I only could scan them at school (no scanner at home) so
they're still just on Kodak paper. Besides, it's at Southwestern Bell, and they only let
you have 3MB space, anything over you pay $1 per MB for. I'm working on migrating them

My baby (well, he's roughly 4 1/2 I think) is happy to be inside. I'm harness-training him,
and he seems to like that as well. That way he can go outside, and yet I know he won't lose
a fight w/ a raccoon, skunk, big dog, car, etc. He's still in the early stages yet, and
it's mostly cold here so he doesn't get to go out much yet. When he does he's still ready
to lead me inside after about 20 minutes, 10 if he decides he's too cold. Only thing is he
still kinda fights me buckling the harness. The idiot who put the buckle under the belly
where all the fur is, and so you have to have the cat on its back, was nuts. My parents
have a harness that of course goes around their belly just behind the elbows, but it still
buckles on top. But, alas, it's too small for my kitty. Mine's a little guy, but he weighs
about 10lbs so it just doesn't quite reach.

no worries, i actually just had a peek at your website, and it was such a privelage to have a view into your world! your cats are adorable - expecially that cobee! but i know that it's dangerous ground to take favourites!!

i know what you mean about the car-wreck analogy - i'm sure there must over 200 postings on this topic, and i've just read them all in the last day or so. wow.

opinions, opinions, facts, facts - all intersting reading (and drama! better than any daytime soap!!)

anyway, i posted a new message at the top of the page with a couple of pics of my girls (they are currently passed out on my bed after coming home from the vet! poor little buggers...)...i'll have to put up a better one of shushu, but pinky is there showing off her funny and adorable cross-eyed face!!

jittery...

Yeah, sorry Aquaviolet.. we have all been getting so tense with the
arrogance and obtuseness of
others around here that we have forgotten our manners. While I don't agree
with some of your view
points, I surely recognize that you are a rational and sensible person. I
hope our rudeness doesn't chase
you off because it's nice to have a voice of reason pop up.

I, normally being a very peace loving and anti-confrontational person, have
found myself getting really
on the defensive, and being a lot more derogatory than I normally am, about
this topic. It's kind of like
a car wreck. I want to look away, but I can't :P Oy!

Anyhow, welcome to this group, and can't wait to hear more about your little

mmm... i agree, that's why i often refer, perhaps romantically, to wishing we didn't live in a world with such man-made threats. the natural threats i can accept, though, perhaps to some people's confusion.

lucky for me, i live in a very safe place for my cats to play outside, but they choose to stay in at night, and pinky for alot of the day. mind you, it's so hot here in summer, that they both often choose to go under the house where it's cooler than inside!!

&quot;Outdoor cats on the street, or even in the country, are faced every day
with
&gt;territorial disputes, threats from other animals, people,
&gt;environmental noises which cause panic, and situations which generate pure
&gt;fear and stress.
&gt;as nature intended?

Umm.. I hardly think nature intended cats to be mowed down in the street by
cars,
or hurt by humans.

That's sort of like saying we shouldn't vaccinate ourselves, or try to cure
diseases because
it's natures way of thinning us out. :(

&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi Becky,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I' ve heard of leash laws for cats. What is the reason for it? We have

&gt;&gt;&gt; Alison

&gt;&gt; In the UK there is no law that requires you to have a dog on a lead.
&gt;&gt; You do have to have it under control, and of course if you lost

way, she stretches uo so I can rub her tummy then I lift her up and kiss the
top of her head and refill her water glass. She can jump up alone and does
when I am not home. She ttries this with my hubby but he is harder to train

But the arguments with Frank, Bob and Adrian Lane was generally about the
number of Americans (as in USA &amp; Canada) keeping their cats indoors..... I am
fully aware of the international make up of the newsgroup.

We (the Americans with Indoor cats) basically say.. it's an individual
decision to be made by assessing risks. THey (the absolutict Brits) say no,
if we can't let cats outside then we shouldn't have cats. Thus a conversation
about life in the US of A got started. hence my post.

Was it a joke? Well, ...

1) I (personally) applaud anyone who can present a concise, reasoned
viewpoint &amp; is open to other ideas.

2) The vast majority of traffic on this topic is from a handful of
extremists who refuse to consider any other point of view. These people do
not want to hear anything that has to do with &quot;reason&quot;.

&gt; but, like i have always said, i shan't be passing any judgement on
anyone
&gt; who chooses to keep their cats indoors, even if i have varying opinions.
&gt; what's the most important is that the cats are truly loved and are not
being
&gt; hurt at all, right!

Then you are not welcome in this discussion. This debate is for those who
KNOW that their way of thinking is the right way &amp; refuse to look at the
issues objectively &amp; reasonably.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is another reason why I'd like to see Brits put the health and safety
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of their cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated custom.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This looks like the beginning of a transatlantic flame war. OK, we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;know you saved our sorry limey asses in World Wars I and II and will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;no doubt be called upon to do the same in World War III :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Joking apart though, there are many cat owners in the UK whose cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are strictly indoor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not many. When I asked Battersea last year their estimate for central
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;London was &lt;20%, and for London (inside the M25) &lt;10%.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;With all due respect to the good people at Battersea Dogs' Home - two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of my three cats came from there - their rehoming policies are biased
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;towards people with gardens. Their perception of the proportion of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;London cats that are indoor may be distorted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Biased in the sense that they strongly leaning towards homing healthy
&gt;&gt;&gt;cats in homes where they can get out at least part of the day.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Something the recognize is good for the cat.

&gt;&gt;It seems that sometimes they would prefer to keep a cat in a cage
&gt;&gt;rather than rehome him/her with someone who will keep the cat indoors.
&gt;&gt;The RSPCA Mayhew Home in Kensal Green is even worse.

&gt;I'm sure they would prefer to wait a few weeks more for the right sort
&gt;of home. There are always a few cats that will suit an indoor only
&gt;home, but only a small number.

League has a more enlightened attitude.

We like cats because they have a large amount of independence, because
we don't &quot;control&quot; them, because they could leave us if they wanted

no worries, i actually just had a peek at your website, and it was such a privelage to have a view into your world! your cats are adorable - expecially that cobee! but i know that it's dangerous ground to take favourites!!

Especially since Cobee is the BRAT of the family. We love them both, but Ally is Mommy's Girl and Cobee is Daddy's Boy :)

i know what you mean about the car-wreck analogy - i'm sure there must over 200 postings on this topic, and i've just read them all in the last day or so. wow. opinions, opinions, facts, facts - all intersting reading (and drama! better than any daytime soap!!)

That's one way of looking at it! A Soap Opera.. All My Kittens, As The Litterbox Turns..

anyway, i posted a new message at the top of the page with a couple of pics of my girls (they are currently passed out on my bed after coming home from the vet! poor little buggers...)...i'll have to put up a better one of shushu, but pinky is there showing off her funny and adorable cross-eyed face!!

Ooo.. I can't wait to check them out. I work for the SPCA Hospital and we spay/neuter up to 30 animals a day. When
I start my shift at 4p.m. I go into the wards and check out all the spays and neuters to see how they are recovering.. and, yes..
to pick my favorites of the day. I love to be able to say to the owner &quot;Oh your cat/dog is soooooo sweet... soooooo cute.. &quot;
The owners just brighten right up and lose some of their fear of the operation.

Ciao for now,
Susan

&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank,

&gt;&gt;&gt; My cats enjoy nature, as I take them out with me every day when it's
nice
&gt;&gt;&gt; out to walk. They are taken out on lead, as the city I lived in before
&gt;&gt;this
&gt;&gt;&gt; one required me to do so, by *law*.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My cats socialize with other cats every day. They socialize with each
&gt;&gt;other,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and with the other cats in our apartment building.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How are they missing out by being indoor only except when supervised?

&gt;&gt;&gt; becky

&gt;&gt;Hi Becky,
&gt;&gt; I' ve heard of leash laws for cats. What is the reason for it? We have
to
&gt;&gt;keep our dogs on a lead here on a public highway ( in my area at least)
but
&gt;&gt;not cats.
&gt;&gt; Alison

&gt; In the UK there is no law that requires you to have a dog on a lead.
&gt; You do have to have it under control, and of course if you lost
&gt; control you would be liable for any damage.

&gt; --
&gt; Frank.

"/> Try telling that to our local dog warden! he's over enthusiastic.

A point about dog owners complaining that cat owners don't have to pick up
the poo.
(I'm a dog and cat owner) before the local council got tough dog owners
never picked it up and all the pavements leading to the fields would be
covered in it. The local school chidren would walk it and it stuck to push
chair wheels and shopping trollys. The trouble is dogs do such large piles
of it where everyone walks compared with cats who do it in earth and cover
it (although it's not much fun if they do it your garden!)

mmm... i agree, that's why i often refer, perhaps romantically, to wishing we didn't live in a world with such man-made threats. the natural threats i can accept, though, perhaps to some people's confusion.

lucky for me, i live in a very safe place for my cats to play outside, but they choose to stay in at night, and pinky for alot of the day. mind you, it's so hot here in summer, that they both often choose to go under the house where it's cooler than inside!! (bring on winter, and to new feet-warmers!! [i've only had them since spring])

Once I buy my own house (sometime in the next 6 months) I plan on compromising by building a &quot;cat run&quot;. An internet pal said she put together two huge metal dog kennels from Wal-Mart. She secured them to the side of the house, and then
put a cat door leading into the kennel. Inside the kennel is a &quot;cat house&quot;, a cat tree, and lots of grass to play in. The
cat house gives shade from the sun or shelter from the rain (although I doubt my cats would want to be out in the rain).
The cat tree would give them an alternative to sharpening their claws (COBEE!!) on my furniture :) And if I could I
would grow a patch of cat grass, or catnip as well as regular grass inside the kennel for them to graze on.

That way, my cats have the best of both worlds. The wind on their faces, the sun warming their fur, the smells
and sounds of outdoor life, without the dangers. When they get bored of it, they can always come back inside
and curl up on their favorite perches.

one of my girls, pinky, likes to drink out of the small bathroom
basin so much, that afterward she will curl up inside it (just
fitting!) and relax for a while there (till i chase her out) -
like an attachmnet to her favourite watering-hole! she still
drinks from her water bowl, too, though. shushu however has not

I admit I didn't read that, but was he FORCING his position on others as out
absolutist Brit frriends have done so savagely?????? Is he telling others
that let their cats out, that they are CRUEL and shoudln't own cats (as our
Brit friends have countless times) or was he jsut voicing his beleifs?

We all have our opinions.... one isn't an extremist to have a belief or
position, but whether or not we allow others to have their own. That has been
the issue, IMHO, on these threads.

I don't rememebr seeing Phil telling others how cruel, and un cat-worthy they
are for letting their cats roam free... then again I DID miss that post you
referred to... maybe he did????

If you are sure others have been extremists forcing their beleifs on others
(in regards to indoor/outdoor) then please let me know. I am not aware of ANY.

"/> Allowing a cat outdoors in a protected area is hardly being an &quot;extremist&quot;.
Actually, its the best of both worlds -- a balance between the two extremes
of indoors and free-roaming. Depending on the location, a &quot;protected area&quot;
can be pretty big - my next home will have several acres.

In case you haven't noticed, there aren't many areas left that are safe to
let a cat roam free. So unless you live on a farm, or far away from roads
and/or highways and unknown cats and/or predators, or on property that is
larger than the distance a cat will roam -- yeah, I still say the cat should
be kept in a protected area. If that seems extreme to you, so be it. I
really don't care.

When you see a few more mangled cats, and cats ripped apart by dogs, and
wafer thin cats embedded into the road in areas that people thought were
&quot;safe&quot;, then maybe you'll become a little more &quot;extreme&quot;, also. I've had
both, protected and free-roaming; I lost one to trauma and I don't make the
same mistake twice.

How long have you been volunteering in a shelter, a few months? You've got
a long way to go. You can speed up the process a bit by working for the
DPW, the department that goes around scraping up dead animals. Until then,
I'd rather be an &quot;extremist&quot; that a sanctimonious, bleeding heart liberal.

People have the right to, and will ultimately make their own decisions. I
just don't want people to base that decision on the false concept that a cat
*must* roam free to be happy or live a &quot;full life&quot;.

There are about 30 million cats currently living indoors in the USA. If
there was an indoor or protected area stress or depression problem, you
could bet the ranch it would be well publicized. So the theory that *every*
cat *must* roam free or even want to go outside is pure and utter nonsense.

You want to call me an &quot;extremist&quot; that's fine with me because I think
you're a sanctimonious, bleeding heart liberal who's more interested in
arguing about the argument than the issue. My only concern is the cats. I'd
be happier than a pig in sh!t being wrong if it meant saving the life of
just one cat. I don't stand on principals when a cat's life is at stake.

That's my position.... and I hope you don't like it.

it is cruel to not allow a cat to roam, and add that one who cannot let cats

mmm... i agree, that's why i often refer, perhaps romantically, to wishing
we didn't live in a world with such man-made threats. the natural threats
i can accept, though, perhaps to some people's confusion.

lucky for me, i live in a very safe place for my cats to play outside, but
they choose to stay in at night, and pinky for alot of the day. mind you,
it's so hot here in summer, that they both often choose to go under the
house where it's cooler than inside!! (bring on winter, and to new
feet-warmers!! [i've only had them since spring])

Once I buy my own house (sometime in the next 6 months) I plan on
compromising by building a &quot;cat run&quot;. An internet pal said she put together
two huge metal dog kennels from Wal-Mart. She secured them to the side of
the house, and then
put a cat door leading into the kennel. Inside the kennel is a &quot;cat
house&quot;, a cat tree, and lots of grass to play in. The
cat house gives shade from the sun or shelter from the rain (although I
doubt my cats would want to be out in the rain).
The cat tree would give them an alternative to sharpening their claws
(COBEE!!) on my furniture :) And if I could I
would grow a patch of cat grass, or catnip as well as regular grass inside
the kennel for them to graze on.

That way, my cats have the best of both worlds. The wind on their faces,
the sun warming their fur, the smells
and sounds of outdoor life, without the dangers. When they get bored of
it, they can always come back inside
and curl up on their favorite perches.

&gt;&gt;talking about, we're talking about letting muffy and fluffy mix with the
&gt;&gt;other cats in the neighbourhood!

&gt;&gt;Not *all* of the posts were in this thread. They weren't talking about
&gt;&gt;wildcats either. There are several postings of Bob saying cats *need* to
&gt;&gt;socialize with up towards 50 other cats as ferals do basically. Phil posted
&gt;&gt;citations from 6 experts denoting that colonies form due to a centralized
&gt;&gt;location of food and shelter but it is dependant on those factors,
&gt;&gt;socialization is a result as is then pecking order and such. Bob has
&gt;&gt;blatantly said the experts don't know what they are talking about and that
&gt;&gt;he knows more. So unless you go back and read postings from several threads
&gt;&gt;from the last few weeks, you *don't* have the whole story.

&gt;&gt;Karen

&gt;Not quite what he said. Cats are by nature social animals and will in
&gt;there natural existence take every opportunity to socialize. In the
&gt;wild this could lead to a cat having social contacts with anything up
&gt;to 50 cats. I would put the norm at around 10 to 20.

and he car

&gt;&gt; I would understand that.. a clean, receptacle (sp?) filled
with constantly

water from the

&gt;&gt; My cousin's have a cat that will drink a glass of milk by
dipping a paw into
&gt;&gt; the glass, and then
&gt;&gt; licking off his paw :)

&gt;&gt; My cats don't get milk, but the other night my husband was
preparing his
&gt;&gt; late night snack which included a
&gt;&gt; glass of milk. He left the milk on the table and turned to
make his bagel
&gt;&gt; when Ally (the better behaved of our
&gt;&gt; two cats) jumped up on the table and, calm as you can please,
walked over to
&gt;&gt; the glass, sniffed it, and started
&gt;&gt; lapping it up!! Cheeky little monkey!

Here is a description, written in another post in this NG, of how a walk

I don't even take them for walks, per say. I put them on the harness and
leash, carry them out to the courtyard or sometimes take them to parks. Then
I sit down and let them do whatever the heck they want. Sometimes that means
they just lay in the grass and sleep, sometimes they're up and running
around, up trees, under benches. Wherever they want. I have an extendable
leash so they have quite a bit of room to roam. The only time I've stopped
them from doing whatever their little hearts desired was once when Chewie
ran straight for a road while chasing a bug of some sort.
----------------------------------------

It is not your ideal, I know. It is ideal for the situation I and my cats
live in.

&gt; So they are free to roam within the apartment building? If so that is

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; better than nothing - not ideal but a good start.

"/> I am lucky to live on a floor in my building that is very cat friendly.
Myself and many of my neighbours open our doors during the day when we're
home and let the cats roam about. Chewie has a particular liking for Bailey,
the cute Maine Coone next door. Neither of them have the &quot;equipment&quot;, but
they like to flirt. :-)

We are lucky to be in this building with such friendly cat loving people.
Most apartment buildings in this city don't allow cats whatsoever, let alone
letting them walk around the hallways. For the last few months I have been
looking for a new apartment (found one! Yay!). From the many places that I
researched I would say about 90% of them had a &quot;no negotiations&quot; no pet
rule.

Heck, even many condominiums that you purchase and own outright will not
allow pets. I don't understand it, but it's true.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;How are they missing out by being indoor only except when supervised?

&gt; A cat is a very free and independent animal, they never enjoy having
&gt; restrictions placed on them.

"/> I don't enjoy restrictions either, yet many are necessary for my own safety.

I understand your point, Bob. I understand that in an ideal world cats would
and should be allowed to enjoy the outdoors on their own terms. I am happy
that you and many of your country men are in a position to do so. I hope
that one day me and my country men will be able to follow suit. However,
until a lot of things are taken care of many of us will simply not be able
to in good conscience allow our cats to roam free.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Once I buy my own house (sometime in the next 6 months) I
&gt; plan on compromising by building a &quot;cat run&quot;. An internet
&gt; pal said she put together two huge metal dog kennels from
&gt; Wal-Mart. She secured them to the side of the house, and
&gt; then
&gt; put a cat door leading into the kennel. Inside the kennel is
&gt; a &quot;cat house&quot;, a cat tree, and lots of grass to play in. The
&gt; cat house gives shade from the sun or shelter from the rain
&gt; (although I doubt my cats would want to be out in the rain).

"/>&lt;snip&gt;
Susan

Don't bank on it, my two indoor/outdoor cats go out in the rain (they
have a cat flap so they can choose whether to be in or out) and then
come back in and dry off by rolling on the furniture!!! They are not
too keen on the rain but after a while they usually decide to brave it
because they want to go out. We gave up having a litter tray (except
when they have to be kept in, for example before vets visits) because
they never, ever used it. They prefer going out and that is that.
BTW I don't want to get too involved in the indoor/outdoor argument
because we have our different opinions and are not going to agree. I
choose to let my cats out based on my knowledge of the area where I live
(and partly having chosen my house on the suitability or otherwise for
outdoor cats) but I don't doubt that the people here who keep their cats
in love their cats and I do think cats can be happy living indoors
(although I have known some very bored indoor only cats) but mine prefer
to go out and I prefer to let them. I think this argument is very dull
and it was one of the reasons I gave up on the cat ngs a few months ago
(although is seems to have been continuing non-stop since then). I have
been lurking a bit and couldn't resist chipping in though.

I've heard that too, but I'm not sure if it's true.
I think there are different ways to neuter. Or maybe a not so well done
neutering.
Would be interesting to know though.

that

cats

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, these are *not* &quot;clearly&quot; 2 extremes of the same issue.

"/> On the one extreme you have the feral cat without human care of any
sort. At the other end you have the poor cats kept indoors on its own
in a high-rise block of flats.

Between those extremes there lies the ideal. In most of the world that
is clearly in/out at the cats own will with an acceptably safe
environment. Keeping them in outdoor runs is not ideal, but it is
better than indoor only.

What I advocate is think of the cat. If you can give it as near to
ideal as possible then have one. If you can't get anywhere near ideal
then you are cruel to have one.

&gt;Allowing a cat outdoors in a protected area is hardly being an &quot;extremist&quot;.
&gt;Actually, its the best of both worlds -- a balance between the two extremes

&gt;&quot;safe&quot;, then maybe you'll become a little more &quot;extreme&quot;, also. I've had

&gt;How long have you been volunteering in a shelter, a few months? You've got

&gt;I'd rather be an &quot;extremist&quot; that a sanctimonious, bleeding heart liberal.

&gt;People have the right to, and will ultimately make their own decisions. I
&gt;just don't want people to base that decision on the false concept that a cat
&gt;*must* roam free to be happy or live a &quot;full life&quot;.

"/> It is far from a false concept Phil, except to those that want to
ignore the needs of their animals.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;There are about 30 million cats currently living indoors in the USA. If

"/> Sure. Phil has spoken. Now what are you going to do Phil when next

frank, even i have to pull you up on this one... respectfully

if you really feel that cats should have as close to their natural habitat,
then wouldn't you be in favour of having them live in their native
environments (country of origin), not having them neutered or vaccinated etc
etc? as other animals in the world do? i think more and more that this
arguement is actually about how far we domesticate them. you *keep* cats as
'pets' too right? naturally, the 'domesticated' cat was kind of like a
scavenger (for food, warmth and safety), wasn't it? (correct me if i'm
wrong) that has co-habited with humans for ages. when did we actually
decide to start keeping them healthier to protect the population from
disease so that we could have them around as purely 'pets' and not just the
vermin-exterminators?

do you agree that this arguement is about how far domestication of the cat
is acceptable?

and then i think to myself that that line of acceptibility is very hazy and
completely subjective.

&quot;natural and near-to-natural&quot; are 2 very. very different things, really.
which one do you mean?

i hope u this as a curiosity and not a put-down. i think there is room for
further clarification from your camp.

been

&gt;&gt;I don't rememebr seeing Phil telling others how cruel, and un cat-worthy
they
&gt;&gt;are for letting their cats roam free... then again I DID miss that post
you

a battle of the extremists??? The fact that you also had a heated
disagreement with Phil is also suspect to why you feel the way you do about
the debate. Perhaps you should go back and re-read the threads.

&gt;&gt;&gt;citations from 6 experts denoting that colonies form due to a
centralized
&gt;&gt;&gt;location of food and shelter but it is dependant on those factors,
&gt;&gt;&gt;socialization is a result as is then pecking order and such. Bob has
&gt;&gt;&gt;blatantly said the experts don't know what they are talking about and
that
&gt;&gt;&gt;he knows more. So unless you go back and read postings from several
threads
&gt;&gt;&gt;from the last few weeks, you *don't* have the whole story.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Karen

&gt;&gt;Not quite what he said. Cats are by nature social animals and will in
&gt;&gt;there natural existence take every opportunity to socialize. In the
&gt;&gt;wild this could lead to a cat having social contacts with anything up
&gt;&gt;to 50 cats. I would put the norm at around 10 to 20.

&gt; Great. The chances of catching something horrible must be quite good,
&gt; then?

&gt; Don't bank on it, my two indoor/outdoor cats go out in the rain (they
&gt; have a cat flap so they can choose whether to be in or out) and then
&gt; come back in and dry off by rolling on the furniture!!! They are not
&gt; too keen on the rain but after a while they usually decide to brave it
&gt; because they want to go out. We gave up having a litter tray (except
&gt; when they have to be kept in, for example before vets visits) because
&gt; they never, ever used it. They prefer going out and that is that.

"/> Hi Hannah. Well if my cats want to go out (eventually) in a protected
environment, rain or shine, I will give them that option. Because I work at
a vet clinic, I prefer them using their litter box to keep an eye out for

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; outdoor cats) but I don't doubt that the people here who keep their cats
&gt; in love their cats and I do think cats can be happy living indoors
&gt; (although I have known some very bored indoor only cats) but mine prefer
&gt; to go out and I prefer to let them. I think this argument is very dull

&gt;Never said they were, never said I did. I put them on lead, yes. However, I

&gt;very idea of teaching a cat to heel boggles my mind. I think their reaction
&gt;would go something like &quot;HA! I'm not a dog, I'm a *god*!&quot;

&gt;Here is a description, written in another post in this NG, of how a walk
&gt;with my cats goes:

&gt;---------------------------------------
&gt;I don't even take them for walks, per say. I put them on the harness and
&gt;leash, carry them out to the courtyard or sometimes take them to parks. Then
&gt;I sit down and let them do whatever the heck they want. Sometimes that means
&gt;they just lay in the grass and sleep, sometimes they're up and running
&gt;around, up trees, under benches. Wherever they want. I have an extendable
&gt;leash so they have quite a bit of room to roam. The only time I've stopped
&gt;them from doing whatever their little hearts desired was once when Chewie
&gt;ran straight for a road while chasing a bug of some sort.
&gt;----------------------------------------

&gt;It is not your ideal, I know. It is ideal for the situation I and my cats
&gt;live in.

are. Why do you think we do it, if not for the welfare of our cats?

I'm genuinely interested in your answers.

Hi,
I've already asked for opinions from aussies and NZ ers in this thread and no one replied. I asked someone (aussie) I knew from another ng and posted her reply. So anyone lurking who is not from the USA and UK please post in your view.!

hold on a tick, i thought this news group was open to all. just because most of you may come from the 'good ole US of A' doesn't mean that a fair few of us don't live in other parts of the wolrd!

anyway a large part of this seems to be USA vs UK, but there has been representation from NZ, SA and AUSTRALIA!! (we're 'good 'ole countries too, you know!)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the most vociferous participants in this
&gt;&gt;&quot;discussion&quot; has put
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; forth very clearly many times. Here's a recent
&gt;&gt; example:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; . . .
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This couldn't be any clearer. Phil is not the only
&gt;&gt; extremist in
&gt;&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regard, but this is the only example I could lay my
&gt;&gt; hands on easily.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But that does not seem extremist in the fact that the cat
&gt;&gt; would have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor/outdoor access. At least in my eyes (which
&gt;&gt; granted I suppose I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; biased BUT) that is not at all like someone preaching
&gt;&gt; that I am cruel,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong, I hate cats because they don't have access to the
&gt;&gt; outdoors
&gt;&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the loudest extremist attitude (certainly not yours JR)
&gt;&gt; on this list.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The UK extremists say that &quot;ALL cats should be allowed
&gt;&gt; unsupervised time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; outdoors&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Phil says that &quot;NO cats should be allowed unsupervised time
&gt;&gt; outdoors&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These are clearly 2 extreme ends of the same issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, these are *not* &quot;clearly&quot; 2 extremes of the same issue.
&gt;&gt; Two extremes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be indoor only and free roaming. A protected
&gt;&gt; environment is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; balance
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between the two.

&gt;&gt;&gt; yes, but there certainly has been *extremely* emotional
&gt;&gt; arguement going back
&gt;&gt;&gt; and forth - that's for sure. as a newcomer to this group, i am
&gt;&gt; simply
&gt;&gt;&gt; bowled over by the ferocity of some of the discussions taking
&gt;&gt; place here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Perhaps you don't see the room for variations in *our* position.
&gt; Extremism by its very nature leaves NO room for such.

"/> Actually, extremism means &quot;the quality or state of being extreme&quot;. There
can be lots of variations in extremist positions.

Let me try once more to explain why I think this position is extremist ...

The question on the table is
Should cats be allowed unsupervised outdoors time?

The &quot;UK&quot; Position:
Yes. ALL cats should be allowed unsupervised outdoors time.

Your position (as I understand it):
No. NO cats should be allowed unsupervised outdoors time.

It seems clear to me that these two positions are at the extreme opposite
ends of the question. Neither position allows for the possibility that SOME
(BUT NOT ALL) cats should be allowed unsupervised outdoors time.

&gt;&gt; It is far from ideal, but better than nothing. I would only have real
&gt;&gt; objections if you were in that situation before you got the cat.

&gt;When we got the boys we lived in a small rural community. At that time they
&gt;were allowed outdoors without the lead, as long as they had a human with
&gt;them. Even in that small rural community there were two very big dangers
&gt;that I had been warned about through my vet:

&gt;1) coyote family living on the outskirts of town that had been fingered for
&gt;two barn cat deaths.
&gt;2) a small group of young boys who entertained themselves by torturing pets.
&gt;Tin cans around the tail, locking them in dumpsters, chasing them etc.

&gt;Those boys were reported many times but never faced punishment.

"/> That is a very sad reflection on law and order :(

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am lucky to live on a floor in my building that is very cat friendly.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Myself and many of my neighbours open our doors during the day when we're
&gt;&gt;&gt;home and let the cats roam about. Chewie has a particular liking for
&gt;Bailey,
&gt;&gt;&gt;the cute Maine Coone next door. Neither of them have the &quot;equipment&quot;, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;they like to flirt. :-)

&gt;&gt; You are lucky it seems. During the summer it is much the same here
&gt;&gt; with cats wondering in and out. Even in winter I often get a knock on
&gt;&gt; the window from one of the local cats who can't understand why the
&gt;&gt; back door is closed.

&gt;Hehe, well when I started opening the door for the boys to go out I didn't
&gt;even consider that other people's cats were going to come in and that our
&gt;cats were going to go into other people's apartments. Imagine my surprise
&gt;the first day when I walked into the livingroom to find three cats sitting
&gt;at the food bowls instead of two. It's not often that they wonder into the
&gt;apartments. I think they respect territory lines. They mostly just share the
&gt;hallways. Bum sniffing is their activity of choice. :-)

"/> During the open door time of year you will often find a group of 5 or
6 going from house to house waiting for food to be put out. Its like
starters and number 5, main course at number 12, dessert at number 14
and cheese and biscuits at number 17 - then back to number 8 for
coffee and after dinner mints :)

&gt;&gt; What I object most to is the people here who go out of their way to
&gt;&gt; exaggerate the outdoor dangers in order (I believe) to scare people
&gt;&gt; into keeping their cats in. Phil and Sherry are prime examples. We all
&gt;&gt; know there are dangers, it is just that some of them are so small they
&gt;&gt; can be ignored. Phil's belief is clearly that the only acceptable risk
&gt;&gt; is ZERO risk - which is just about as stupid as you can get.

&gt;I don't think they are exaggerating. I have seen and heard of many of the
&gt;dangers they have brought up. If it is so rare then why have all of these
&gt;people, across the US and Canada, experienced these things?

"/> I really don't think they are experiencing things. Over the last year

&gt;As for level of risk. If Phil thought that nothing except ZERO risk was
&gt;acceptable, he wouldn't be allowing his cats outdoors *at all*. I understand
&gt;that he lets them out under supervision. He is taking risks with that. Ones
&gt;that he feels are acceptable. The very same risks that I feel are
&gt;acceptable, in fact. However, as has been stated many times, there are much
&gt;bigger risks here that I don't think should be ignored. If these risks don't
&gt;even register, as you have claimed, then why have all of us heard of and
&gt;experienced them?

"/> I strongly believe the risks are exaggerated. But if they are not then
the real answer has to be not having cats. I do not believe we have
the right to have cats if we don't give them the sort of lifestyle
they need.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; To me the cats quality of live has to be balanced with the quantity.

"/> Of the dangers that have been mentioned I have experienced the following:

1) cats being hit by cars. I've seen this many times, and in every part of
the country I've lived in.
2) cats as prey for larger predatory animals. The coyotes mentioned above
are one example.
3) cats being tortured by disgusting humans.
4) cats being taken away, either by animal control, or other animal lovers
looking to do a good deed.

This is all first hand experience. I have also *heard* of these things
happening to other people. Though entirely unscientific, my conclusion has
to be that these things happen frequently enough for them to be considered a
risk by me.

"/> Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of picking and choosing at this
time. It may not be the case in the UK, that cats are killed by the
thousands every month, but it certainly is the case here in Canada and the
US. Until our shelters are no-kill (and many of us work towards that goal),
then cats can not be left in the shelters. I would much rather see a cat
pampered and cared for indoors than left in a shelter for a few weeks until
they have to be killed in order to make room for the next batch of homeless
cats.

Why are our shelters &quot;kill&quot;? Very little public awareness, very little
government funding, and a lack of motivation by the majority to do anything
about it.

"/> I know of quite a few people here who have taken cats in and given up things
for themselves. I won't name anyone in particular, but some here have
basically made no-kill shelters out of their homes. Taking in starving and
sick cats to provide care for them and make them well. How are they
improving their own quality of life (in terms of spending money providing
for their cats, instead of buying life's little luxuries) and not giving any
regard to the quality of life for the cats?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, if you had been in an unsafe area to start with - would you
&gt; have considered a cat for a pet?

"/> This is a good question.

The small rural community we lived in when we got the boys did not have a
problem getting cats out of the shelter. In fact, the litter that was there
when we picked out Chewie and Enzo was entirely gone the very next day. It
is a farming community, and many people were actually *waiting* for cats to
keep in their barns as mousers, and also to have as pets. So if I couldn't
have provided for them then I think, no, I wouldn't have got them to begin
with. I knew that if we didn't take them they would still have found a home.

Unfortunately, most places do not have a demand that exceeds the supply of
cats. People go to the shelters, see cages of cats lining the walls, and
know that most of them will not make it unless they are taken in. These
people take the cat, provide the very best life that they can for it, and

&gt;&gt;&gt;Those boys were reported many times but never faced punishment.

&gt;&gt; That is a very sad reflection on law and order :

&gt; Yes, it is. The answer that was given by the authorities went, &quot;Boys will be
&gt; boys. They are just entertaining themselves. Better than doing drugs...&quot; etc
&gt; etc.

&gt;&gt; During the open door time of year you will often find a group of 5 or
&gt;&gt; 6 going from house to house waiting for food to be put out. Its like
&gt;&gt; starters and number 5, main course at number 12, dessert at number 14
&gt;&gt; and cheese and biscuits at number 17 - then back to number 8 for
&gt;&gt; coffee and after dinner mints :)

&gt; I can just imagine it. Cats comparing notes on what their humans are serving
&gt; that day, deciding which house to hit first. :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't think they are exaggerating. I have seen and heard of many of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;dangers they have brought up. If it is so rare then why have all of these
&gt;&gt;&gt;people, across the US and Canada, experienced these things?

&gt;&gt; I really don't think they are experiencing things. Over the last year
&gt;&gt; we have been over several perceived dangers and have been able to show
&gt;&gt; that while the dangers may exist, they are being exaggerated.

&gt; Of the dangers that have been mentioned I have experienced the following:

&gt; 1) cats being hit by cars. I've seen this many times, and in every part of
&gt; the country I've lived in.
&gt; 2) cats as prey for larger predatory animals. The coyotes mentioned above
&gt; are one example.
&gt; 3) cats being tortured by disgusting humans.
&gt; 4) cats being taken away, either by animal control, or other animal lovers
&gt; looking to do a good deed.

&gt; This is all first hand experience. I have also *heard* of these things
&gt; happening to other people. Though entirely unscientific, my conclusion has
&gt; to be that these things happen frequently enough for them to be considered a
&gt; risk by me.

&gt;&gt; I strongly believe the risks are exaggerated. But if they are not then
&gt;&gt; the real answer has to be not having cats. I do not believe we have
&gt;&gt; the right to have cats if we don't give them the sort of lifestyle
&gt;&gt; they need.

&gt; Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of picking and choosing at this
&gt; time. It may not be the case in the UK, that cats are killed by the
&gt; thousands every month, but it certainly is the case here in Canada and the
&gt; US. Until our shelters are no-kill (and many of us work towards that goal),
&gt; then cats can not be left in the shelters. I would much rather see a cat
&gt; pampered and cared for indoors than left in a shelter for a few weeks until
&gt; they have to be killed in order to make room for the next batch of homeless
&gt; cats.

&gt; Why are our shelters &quot;kill&quot;? Very little public awareness, very little
&gt; government funding, and a lack of motivation by the majority to do anything
&gt; about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you'll find that to many of the people who post on these NGs
&gt; quality
&gt;&gt;&gt;of life is very important.

&gt;&gt; From over a years experience on alt.cats I've found a lot of people
&gt;&gt; got for their quality of life rather than the cats.

&gt; I know of quite a few people here who have taken cats in and given up things
&gt; for themselves. I won't name anyone in particular, but some here have
&gt; basically made no-kill shelters out of their homes. Taking in starving and
&gt; sick cats to provide care for them and make them well. How are they
&gt; improving their own quality of life (in terms of spending money providing
&gt; for their cats, instead of buying life's little luxuries) and not giving any
&gt; regard to the quality of life for the cats?

&gt;&gt; However, if you had been in an unsafe area to start with - would you
&gt;&gt; have considered a cat for a pet?

&gt; This is a good question.

&gt; The small rural community we lived in when we got the boys did not have a
&gt; problem getting cats out of the shelter. In fact, the litter that was there
&gt; when we picked out Chewie and Enzo was entirely gone the very next day. It
&gt; is a farming community, and many people were actually *waiting* for cats to
&gt; keep in their barns as mousers, and also to have as pets. So if I couldn't
&gt; have provided for them then I think, no, I wouldn't have got them to begin
&gt; with. I knew that if we didn't take them they would still have found a home.

&gt; Unfortunately, most places do not have a demand that exceeds the supply of
&gt; cats. People go to the shelters, see cages of cats lining the walls, and
&gt; know that most of them will not make it unless they are taken in. These
&gt; people take the cat, provide the very best life that they can for it, and
&gt; know that at the very least that cat will not die alone and unloved in a
&gt; shelter. One of millions every year.

&gt; If we had all no-kill shelters I would be able to say quite happliy that
&gt; people should not get a cat unless they could allow it time outdoors. Until
&gt; that time we are making do with the situation we're in. And this situation

&gt;&gt; I can understand people bringing their cats in if a danger appears.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the most vociferous participants in this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;discussion&quot; has put
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; forth very clearly many times. Here's a recent
&gt;&gt;&gt; example:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; . . .
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This couldn't be any clearer. Phil is not the only
&gt;&gt;&gt; extremist in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regard, but this is the only example I could lay my
&gt;&gt;&gt; hands on easily.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But that does not seem extremist in the fact that the cat
&gt;&gt;&gt; would have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indoor/outdoor access. At least in my eyes (which
&gt;&gt;&gt; granted I suppose I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; biased BUT) that is not at all like someone preaching
&gt;&gt;&gt; that I am cruel,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong, I hate cats because they don't have access to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; outdoors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the loudest extremist attitude (certainly not yours JR)
&gt;&gt;&gt; on this list.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The UK extremists say that &quot;ALL cats should be allowed
&gt;&gt;&gt; unsupervised time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; outdoors&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Phil says that &quot;NO cats should be allowed unsupervised time
&gt;&gt;&gt; outdoors&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These are clearly 2 extreme ends of the same issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, these are *not* &quot;clearly&quot; 2 extremes of the same issue.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Two extremes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be indoor only and free roaming. A protected
&gt;&gt;&gt; environment is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; balance
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between the two.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yes, but there certainly has been *extremely* emotional
&gt;&gt;&gt; arguement going back
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and forth - that's for sure. as a newcomer to this group, i am
&gt;&gt;&gt; simply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bowled over by the ferocity of some of the discussions taking
&gt;&gt;&gt; place here.

going to get the idea that it's a contentious issue and give it due
consideration. have you seen how long this is?? it took me about 24 hrs
to catch up, and i never even saw the first thread!!

just my 'opinion'...

&gt;&gt; why buy into it though, if you see it as headbutting a brickwall? all
&gt;&gt; you're all doing is getting yourselves all worked up, over someone who
&gt; lives
&gt;&gt; the other side of the world, whose choices you can't affect anyway..

&gt;&gt; just seems a little silly to me - especially when it's just reduced to
&gt;&gt; insult-throwing. there's no sensible, rational arguement taking place
&gt; here
&gt;&gt; anymore (apart from a few). it appears as simple stubborness now. why
&gt;&gt; bother?

&gt; Because people who want advice poke their heads in here and see this
stuff.
&gt; Many are new to cats altogether and a shelter kitty somewhere may not get
a
&gt; loving home because someone took this stuff seriously.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, when two (or three) morons start telling you you are cruel and

&gt;&gt;&gt; keep cats because you don't let them roam would probably piss you of
&gt;&gt; too...
&gt;&gt;&gt; especially if you've lost a cat to a sick neighbor who poisoned a
dozen
&gt;&gt;&gt; neighborhood cats.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They are trolls nothing more, nothing less. They don't care about
&gt; cats..
&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt; care about getting a rise on this newsgroup. Period. hence they are
&gt; being
&gt;&gt;&gt; starved for attention.

let me just check something, is outdoor free-roaming the same thing as
unsupervised access to the outdoors?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But it sounds like you want to argue about which extremist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; position is more extreme. If you feel better trying to to draw that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; distinction, fine.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well thanks for your permission. ;oÞ

&gt;&gt; You're welcome. Please be sure to check with me again before doing
&gt; anything
&gt;&gt; else.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, if you'll notice, I have stayed, for the most part, out
&gt;&gt;&gt; of this thread.

&gt;&gt; Yep.

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, I do not have to *draw* a distinction between extreme
&gt;&gt;&gt; positions on the subject. I don't find Phil's position, or any of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; other supervision proponents for that matter, to be extreme at all.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps you don't see the room for variations in *our* position.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Extremism by its very nature leaves NO room for such.

&gt;&gt; Actually, extremism means &quot;the quality or state of being extreme&quot;.
There
&gt;&gt; can be lots of variations in extremist positions.

&gt;&gt; Let me try once more to explain why I think this position is extremist
...

&gt;&gt; The question on the table is
&gt;&gt; Should cats be allowed unsupervised outdoors time?

&gt; No! That is NOT the question! You don't understand the answer because you
&gt; don't even understand the question. The issue is indoor or outdoor
&gt; free-roaming! My position is a balance between the two. *You* added the
&gt; other category.

&gt;&gt; The &quot;UK&quot; Position:
&gt;&gt; Yes. ALL cats should be allowed unsupervised outdoors time.

&gt;&gt; Your position (as I understand it):
&gt;&gt; No. NO cats should be allowed unsupervised outdoors time.

&gt;&gt; It seems clear to me that these two positions are at the extreme
opposite
&gt;&gt; ends of the question.

&gt; Seems like clear to me that you added another category which has been
&gt; heretofore dealt with.

&gt; Neither position allows for the possibility that SOME
&gt;&gt; (BUT NOT ALL) cats should be allowed unsupervised outdoors time.

&gt; Seems clear you missed a few posts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Those boys were reported many times but never faced punishment.

&gt;&gt; That is a very sad reflection on law and order :

&gt; Yes, it is. The answer that was given by the authorities went, &quot;Boys will
be
&gt; boys. They are just entertaining themselves. Better than doing drugs...&quot;
etc
&gt; etc.

&gt;&gt; During the open door time of year you will often find a group of 5 or
&gt;&gt; 6 going from house to house waiting for food to be put out. Its like
&gt;&gt; starters and number 5, main course at number 12, dessert at number 14
&gt;&gt; and cheese and biscuits at number 17 - then back to number 8 for
&gt;&gt; coffee and after dinner mints :)

&gt; I can just imagine it. Cats comparing notes on what their humans are
serving
&gt; that day, deciding which house to hit first. :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't think they are exaggerating. I have seen and heard of many of
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;dangers they have brought up. If it is so rare then why have all of
these
&gt;&gt;&gt;people, across the US and Canada, experienced these things?

&gt;&gt; I really don't think they are experiencing things. Over the last year
&gt;&gt; we have been over several perceived dangers and have been able to show
&gt;&gt; that while the dangers may exist, they are being exaggerated.

&gt; Of the dangers that have been mentioned I have experienced the following:

&gt; 1) cats being hit by cars. I've seen this many times, and in every part of
&gt; the country I've lived in.
&gt; 2) cats as prey for larger predatory animals. The coyotes mentioned above
&gt; are one example.
&gt; 3) cats being tortured by disgusting humans.
&gt; 4) cats being taken away, either by animal control, or other animal lovers
&gt; looking to do a good deed.

&gt; This is all first hand experience. I have also *heard* of these things
&gt; happening to other people. Though entirely unscientific, my conclusion has
&gt; to be that these things happen frequently enough for them to be considered
a
&gt; risk by me.

&gt;&gt; I strongly believe the risks are exaggerated. But if they are not then
&gt;&gt; the real answer has to be not having cats. I do not believe we have
&gt;&gt; the right to have cats if we don't give them the sort of lifestyle
&gt;&gt; they need.

&gt; Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of picking and choosing at this
&gt; time. It may not be the case in the UK, that cats are killed by the
&gt; thousands every month, but it certainly is the case here in Canada and the
&gt; US. Until our shelters are no-kill (and many of us work towards that
goal),
&gt; then cats can not be left in the shelters. I would much rather see a cat
&gt; pampered and cared for indoors than left in a shelter for a few weeks
until
&gt; they have to be killed in order to make room for the next batch of
homeless
&gt; cats.

&gt; Why are our shelters &quot;kill&quot;? Very little public awareness, very little
&gt; government funding, and a lack of motivation by the majority to do
anything
&gt; about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you'll find that to many of the people who post on these NGs
&gt; quality
&gt;&gt;&gt;of life is very important.

&gt;&gt; From over a years experience on alt.cats I've found a lot of people
&gt;&gt; got for their quality of life rather than the cats.

&gt; I know of quite a few people here who have taken cats in and given up
things
&gt; for themselves. I won't name anyone in particular, but some here have
&gt; basically made no-kill shelters out of their homes. Taking in starving and
&gt; sick cats to provide care for them and make them well. How are they
&gt; improving their own quality of life (in terms of spending money providing
&gt; for their cats, instead of buying life's little luxuries) and not giving
any
&gt; regard to the quality of life for the cats?

&gt;&gt; However, if you had been in an unsafe area to start with - would you
&gt;&gt; have considered a cat for a pet?

&gt; This is a good question.

&gt; The small rural community we lived in when we got the boys did not have a
&gt; problem getting cats out of the shelter. In fact, the litter that was
there
&gt; when we picked out Chewie and Enzo was entirely gone the very next day. It
&gt; is a farming community, and many people were actually *waiting* for cats
to
&gt; keep in their barns as mousers, and also to have as pets. So if I couldn't
&gt; have provided for them then I think, no, I wouldn't have got them to begin
&gt; with. I knew that if we didn't take them they would still have found a
home.

&gt; Unfortunately, most places do not have a demand that exceeds the supply of
&gt; cats. People go to the shelters, see cages of cats lining the walls, and
&gt; know that most of them will not make it unless they are taken in. These
&gt; people take the cat, provide the very best life that they can for it, and
&gt; know that at the very least that cat will not die alone and unloved in a
&gt; shelter. One of millions every year.

&gt; If we had all no-kill shelters I would be able to say quite happliy that
&gt; people should not get a cat unless they could allow it time outdoors.
Until
&gt; that time we are making do with the situation we're in. And this situation
&gt; is not going to change over night.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm interested to know what you think our reasons for keeping cats
&gt; indoors
&gt;&gt;&gt;are. Why do you think we do it, if not for the welfare of our cats?

&gt;&gt; I can understand people bringing their cats in if a danger appears.
&gt;&gt; What I cannot understand is why people actually go out and get cats
&gt;&gt; when they know they will never let them out --- WHY?

&gt; I've already explained this above, so I won't repeat it here. Granted,
many
&gt; people who get cats (and any other pet for that matter) do it for very
&gt; selfish reasons. &quot;I just want one!&quot; or something along those lines.
However,
&gt; there are also many of us who just love the cats, and even if we don't
live
&gt; in a Utopia where cats can roam free and be loved by everyone, we think
they
&gt; deserve more than a shelter cage and death.

&gt;&gt;It's pretty safe to say there are extremists on both sides of the litter

manage ..... but the same can be said for those who's cat's remain indoors.

..... and, at the end of the day, as long as I know that my animals are
healthy and apparently happy, what the heck does it matter if they go
outside or stay inside?

There is nothing that any of the petty arguments in this thread may say
which would ever convince me to behave in any other way.

Although I may choose to have indoor/outdoor cats ... it's been *my* choice
.... but, if I listen to some of your arguments, does that mean that I am an
irresponsible cat owner because Cayce cat *chooses* to be an indoor cat ...?

such thing.
And I don't believe most of the others have either, that is why I
object to the 'extremist' title.
It's just that while it would be lovely to allow the cats such
freedom in a SAFE environment,
ie. temperate climate, no traffic, no diseases, no predatory
wildlife etc etc., there are very few places in the world where
that exists in this time. It may have 50 or more years ago, but
like it or not, that is no longer the case for most areas.
If that were the criterion for most adopters, sadly most shelter
cats would be euthanised.
However, as has been stated by us 'moderates' time and again, if
that is the case for any particular petowner, all the power to
them.
Personally, due to my suburban home as well as the nature of my
chosen breed, I prefer to keep mine safe and happy INDOORS. It's
more work, but it's worth it.

"/> Hi Morag.. I won't even both responding to Frankenbob's post as I have given
up on them.
Thank YOU for being reasonable, respectful and open to the idea that indoor
cats are
just as happy as outdoor cats. I have thought long and hard, and lost cats
to the outdoors
so I feel good about my decision. Unlike Frankenbob, I believe that I am
doing the best
for my cats and that many others who post here, indoor or outdoor
supporters, do also.

"/> Yes, and no. If we (man) had not destroyed so much of animals natural
habitat then maybe.

As it is I try to encourage people to keep their cats in as near a
natural environment as possible. Giving them good vet care adds well
to their life expectancy by a lot - worth doing. Feeding them well
increases their life expectancy by a lot - worth doing. Vaccinating
can save them from certain diseases - worth doing if your vet advises
it for your area. Keeping them indoors only increases their life
expectancy if conditions outside are really unsafe - as cats are not
indoor animals and as it clearly causes a lot of cats stress to be
kept in - then I do not approve of people acquiring cats they know
they will not let out.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Show me where anybody from the indoor side said they'd rather see
&gt;&gt;&gt; cats euthanised than let out please. To me, and I'm sure many

&gt;&gt; I am aware of this point that the UK Extremists (sounds like a punk band)
&gt;&gt; make. I think their position is silly &amp; indefensible.

&gt;&gt; But it sounds like you want to argue about which extremist position is more

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The question on the table is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Should cats be allowed unsupervised outdoors time?

&gt;&gt;&gt; No! That is NOT the question! You don't understand the answer because
&gt;you
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't even understand the question. The issue is indoor or outdoor
&gt;&gt;&gt; free-roaming! My position is a balance between the two. *You* added the
&gt;&gt;&gt; other category.

&gt;&gt; ..... and how does one define &quot;free roaming?&quot;

&gt;Running loose outdoors unsupervised and not in a protected area.

"/> Other than a cage - what is a protected area, protected from what?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Very rational. But these mental midgets insist a cat *can't* be happy
&gt;indoors or in an outdoor protected area - and thus we shouldn't have cats.

"/> And the clear evidence of stress in cats goes to show that removing
them from nature is not a good idea.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Following that illogical reasoning would result in the death of 30 million
&gt;cats who are currently living indoors in the USA.

"/> No, because A) I do not believe the USA is anywhere near as dangerous
as you make out. And B) there are a lot of potential home being
ignored at the moment because people who should know better are
turning down homes because they will not sign indoor-only clauses.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Just grow up and accept that things differ from place to place and what is
&gt;&gt; right for animal A is not necessarily right for animal B. When dealing
&gt;with
&gt;&gt; a domesticated animal, one does the best that one can do .....

&gt;That's the position of rational people. However, there are a few psychos
&gt;who say a cat is better off dead than living indoors or in a protected
&gt;outdoor area.

&gt;&gt; I really don't think they are experiencing things. Over the last year
&gt;&gt; we have been over several perceived dangers and have been able to show
&gt;&gt; that while the dangers may exist, they are being exaggerated.

&gt;Of the dangers that have been mentioned I have experienced the following:

&gt;1) cats being hit by cars. I've seen this many times, and in every part of
&gt;the country I've lived in.

"/> I've seen cats hit by cars. But I see many times the number of foxes,

&gt;are one example.

"/> A problem in rather limited areas.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;3) cats being tortured by disgusting humans.

"/> A problem your society has to deal with.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;4) cats being taken away, either by animal control, or other animal lovers

"/> Your animal control needs to be taught to tell the difference between
a feral cat and an owned cat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;This is all first hand experience. I have also *heard* of these things
&gt;happening to other people. Though entirely unscientific, my conclusion has
&gt;to be that these things happen frequently enough for them to be considered a
&gt;risk by me.

&gt;&gt; I strongly believe the risks are exaggerated. But if they are not then
&gt;&gt; the real answer has to be not having cats. I do not believe we have
&gt;&gt; the right to have cats if we don't give them the sort of lifestyle
&gt;&gt; they need.

&gt;Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of picking and choosing at this
&gt;time. It may not be the case in the UK, that cats are killed by the
&gt;thousands every month, but it certainly is the case here in Canada and the
&gt;US. Until our shelters are no-kill (and many of us work towards that goal),

"/> I know, and I have offered help and advice from the UK - it has always

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;then cats can not be left in the shelters. I would much rather see a cat
&gt;pampered and cared for indoors than left in a shelter for a few weeks until
&gt;they have to be killed in order to make room for the next batch of homeless
&gt;cats.

&gt;Why are our shelters &quot;kill&quot;? Very little public awareness, very little
&gt;government funding, and a lack of motivation by the majority to do anything
&gt;about it.

"/> I would like to point out again (for anyone who has missed it before)
that none of our shelters receive a penny of government money. It is
all down to donations.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you'll find that to many of the people who post on these NGs
&gt;quality
&gt;&gt;&gt;of life is very important.

&gt;&gt; From over a years experience on alt.cats I've found a lot of people
&gt;&gt; got for their quality of life rather than the cats.

&gt;I know of quite a few people here who have taken cats in and given up things
&gt;for themselves. I won't name anyone in particular, but some here have
&gt;basically made no-kill shelters out of their homes. Taking in starving and
&gt;sick cats to provide care for them and make them well. How are they
&gt;improving their own quality of life (in terms of spending money providing
&gt;for their cats, instead of buying life's little luxuries) and not giving any
&gt;regard to the quality of life for the cats?

"/> I am on about the people who put their own feelings ahead of the cats
- preferring to deprive a cat of a real life rather than risk the
sadness of losing it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; However, if you had been in an unsafe area to start with - would you
&gt;&gt; have considered a cat for a pet?

&gt;This is a good question.

&gt;The small rural community we lived in when we got the boys did not have a
&gt;problem getting cats out of the shelter. In fact, the litter that was there
&gt;when we picked out Chewie and Enzo was entirely gone the very next day. It
&gt;is a farming community, and many people were actually *waiting* for cats to
&gt;keep in their barns as mousers, and also to have as pets. So if I couldn't
&gt;have provided for them then I think, no, I wouldn't have got them to begin
&gt;with. I knew that if we didn't take them they would still have found a home.

&gt;Unfortunately, most places do not have a demand that exceeds the supply of
&gt;cats. People go to the shelters, see cages of cats lining the walls, and
&gt;know that most of them will not make it unless they are taken in. These
&gt;people take the cat, provide the very best life that they can for it, and
&gt;know that at the very least that cat will not die alone and unloved in a
&gt;shelter. One of millions every year.

&gt;If we had all no-kill shelters I would be able to say quite happliy that
&gt;people should not get a cat unless they could allow it time outdoors. Until
&gt;that time we are making do with the situation we're in. And this situation
&gt;is not going to change over night.

"/> Well at least lets start to change it. Lets get these shelters
no-kill, lets raise money and support for them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm interested to know what you think our reasons for keeping cats
&gt;indoors
&gt;&gt;&gt;are. Why do you think we do it, if not for the welfare of our cats?

&gt;&gt; I can understand people bringing their cats in if a danger appears.
&gt;&gt; What I cannot understand is why people actually go out and get cats
&gt;&gt; when they know they will never let them out --- WHY?

&gt;I've already explained this above, so I won't repeat it here. Granted, many
&gt;people who get cats (and any other pet for that matter) do it for very
&gt;selfish reasons. &quot;I just want one!&quot; or something along those lines. However,
&gt;there are also many of us who just love the cats, and even if we don't live
&gt;in a Utopia where cats can roam free and be loved by everyone, we think they
&gt;deserve more than a shelter cage and death.

Our cats are in and out all day long - the cat flap rarely stops
clattering with one or other of them on its way in or out. I would
question the concept of a cat being put outdoors all the time as much as
that of a cat being kept indoors all the time. The Brits here (even the

there's a big difference.

I don't know why so many people involved in this debate don't seem to

In the UK there is absolutely no correlation between cats being allowed
indoor/outdoor lives and being abandoned. Your implication that if a
cat is allowed outside it will end up back in a shelter has no relevance
to the UK at all.

If you live somewhere too dangerous to allow cats their freedom then an
outside run is obviously a better option than keeping them indoors all
the time, but it in no way equates to cats being &quot;unsupervised&quot;.

You can try as hard as you like Phil, you can't change the fact that
from the beginning I have been totally consistent. I believe that in
the best of all possible worlds every cat would have the choice of going
outside or staying in. That is what I would *like* to see in the best
case scenario, but I have never demanded that this be the case and have
never told a single American that they should let their cat outside. I
believe that there are some external environments that are not safe for
cats and I understand why those who live in those environments keep
their cats inside. I also believe that those cats that don't have the
opportunity to live indoor/outdoor lives miss out. That is my opinion,
which I have every right to hold. My holding that opinion does not
change the fact that I understand why many American cat owners keep
their cats inside.

I believe that North American cat owners, in the main, keep their cats
indoors because to allow them outside would be too dangerous in North
America. I know that in the UK this is not the case. I have never,
ever, on a single occasion told a North American cat owner that they are
wrong to keep their cats indoors.

No amount of manoeuvering,manipulating or lying by you can change that.

Live with it.

&gt; Oh dear, I *do* so wish that you folk would understand what
&gt; indoor/outdoor means. You all seem to think that it means that the cats
&gt; are outside and gone all the time. It doesn't. It simply means that
&gt; the cats are able to go outside when and if they want to. In practise
&gt; it means that they're coming in and out and pottering around the whole
&gt; time. There are always two or three of them around, always cats to sit
&gt; on laps, never a house empty of cats. Interaction is constant.

"/> Sorry.. I guess my original comment came out the wrong way and sounded
extremist..

come in when
they are ready for huggins and lovins from their human families.

&gt; Why do you think it would be &quot;something&quot; chasing them, rather than them

&gt; enjoy it enormously.

"/> I am sure they do have play time.. but not every animal gets along.. and
(and this is where I live and does

Thank you for that consideration. To be honest, at least in the suburb of
Vancouver, BC, Canada it's
not as if the streets are teeming with drag racing cars, packs of wild dogs
and coyotes and disease ridden
hordes of cats. BUT there are still enough instances of these happening that
I feel my cats are safer indoors.
They do not mope, seem depressed or sleep most of the day away in sheer
boredom. They are happy and
content.

I have also made my PERSONAL decision based on where I work. I see many
people bring in their cats
dead or gravely injured.. or even with minor injuries.. from all of the
circumstances described above. I have
seen single people or entier families devestated and crying becauset their
pet is gone.

I also have based my PERSONAL decision on childhood pets who were allowed to
be indoor/outdoor cats.
We never had them more than a year or two because they disappeared. I have
seen friends and co-workers
in tears because their pets are dead (hit by car, attacked by other dogs) or
disappeared, never to return.

I know most people will understand, even if they don't agree with, my
decision. I guess I just don't like people
telling me my cats lives are somehow lacking because I have chosen to keep
them indoors.

From what I can see, they look as happy and healthy, or even healthier than
the client's cats who have equal access
to the indoors and outdoors.

&gt; Fish and dairy are bad for cats? Come again?

"/> According to the vets I work with dairy products can cause diaharrea (sp?)
because most
cats are lactose intolerant (or something to that effect) and in some cats a
diet of fish, canned fish,
or fish flavored cat foods can cause crystals to build in the urinary tract,
eventually blocking the
urinary tract and keeping the cat from being able to pee. If not caught in
time it can lead to death.

My own personal theory on that is that when cats were wild they probably did
not eat fish (unless
it was found beached or left behind by another animal) because most cats
don't like getting wet.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess it's like humans with pop and junk food! :)
&gt;&gt; Fish and dairy are bad for cats? Come again?

&gt; According to the vets I work with dairy products can cause diaharrea (sp?)
&gt; because most
&gt; cats are lactose intolerant (or something to that effect) and in some cats
a
&gt; diet of fish, canned fish,
&gt; or fish flavored cat foods can cause crystals to build in the urinary
tract,
&gt; eventually blocking the
&gt; urinary tract and keeping the cat from being able to pee. If not caught in
&gt; time it can lead to death.

&gt; My own personal theory on that is that when cats were wild they probably
did
&gt; not eat fish (unless
&gt; it was found beached or left behind by another animal) because most cats
&gt; don't like getting wet.

"/> Hadn't thought about the lactose. Even though I have seen lactose free milk
being sold as &quot;kitty milk&quot; in the pet stores.
But I had thought that *protein* caused crystals to form in certain animals
urinary tracts.
Reason I say this is because that was the case concerning a dalmation my
sister owned.
What could possibly be in fish or even fish flavored foods that could have
this effect on certain animals? Magnesium?
I mean ...ain't nothin' I'm gonna worry about but geez.
Besides diaharrea is quite a ...shall we say, noticable, symptom? And so is
an animals increasing inability to urinate.
So I'm going to consider those products safe until proven guilty in a box of
litter. But thanks for the tip off.

&gt; The fact that you believe anyone posting in favour of indoor/outdoor
&gt; cats is a supporter of Frank/Bob is a further demonstration of how
&gt; little you're reading. However, here are just three comments by Phil in

&gt;&quot;allowing cats to roam free is a *much* more selfish and lazy option!&quot;

&gt;&quot;My need is to fulfill my cats needs as best and as safely as I can.
&gt; Which I can safely say I'm doing much better than you are if
&gt; you're allowing your cats to roam free.&quot;

&gt;&quot;In an ideal world, I'd like to see Brits put the health and safety
&gt; of their cats before their sad devotion to an ancient and outdated
&gt; custom.&quot; (referring to the UK custom of indoor/outdoor cats).

"/> And you accuse me of taking your phrases out of context???? You're quite a

statements - and so does everyone else! My phrases were in direct response
to similar allegations made about us by your countryman, Bobity/Frank as an
example that the same things could be said about people who let their cats
free-roam.

The concept of &quot;people shouldn't have cats if we can't let them roam-free&quot;,
came from *your* corner, not ours! No one on this side of the Atlantic said
you people shouldn't have cats until *you* brought it up!

Quite a manipulator you are! You must be getting desperate to feel the need

"/> Actually, your cat situation sounds just like mine, except, my yard
is fenced and I don't have a cat flap yet. But they basically come
and go outside all day long (when I am home). Without the fence,
I probably would never have seen Blackie or Cali again, once they
went out; and before we had the fence, Kitty spent all his time
wondering around the neighborhood. Nevertheless, I try to give
them the outdoors, but with some restrictions.

Hi susan,
I don't know about fish but our vets in the uk say the same about milk. Its
best not to give it to them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess it's like humans with pop and junk food! :)
&gt;&gt; Fish and dairy are bad for cats? Come again?

&gt; According to the vets I work with dairy products can cause diaharrea (sp?)
&gt; because most
&gt; cats are lactose intolerant (or something to that effect) and in some cats
a
&gt; diet of fish, canned fish,
&gt; or fish flavored cat foods can cause crystals to build in the urinary
tract,
&gt; eventually blocking the
&gt; urinary tract and keeping the cat from being able to pee. If not caught in
&gt; time it can lead to death.

&gt; My own personal theory on that is that when cats were wild they probably
did
&gt; not eat fish (unless
&gt; it was found beached or left behind by another animal) because most cats
&gt; don't like getting wet.

&gt;&gt;Ours doesn't, I've known quite a number that don't, and other Brits have
&gt;&gt;posted here to say the same.

&gt;Battersea Dogs Home, to which I was originally referring, use cages
&gt;with a small open area behind for 'exercise'. Space is clearly
&gt;limited and they don't want possibly infectious cats mixing with each
&gt;other.

"/> I've volunteered at Battersea back in the early-mid 80s. Their recent
rebuilds have helped a lot, but conditions can never be perfect.
However, keeping in mind that most cats are rehomed very quickly the
conditions don't cause problems for the cats.

"/>  Frank and Bob too,
You feel that cats should be put down rather than be indoor cats.
If you worked at a shelter could you do the destroying.? can you be the one
that holds it and strokes it while it purrs and rubs its face against you
and then the vet kills it. Not just one cat but many.
Survival is in a cats nature. A feral cat can be half starved and freezing
cold but its instinct is not to die. An indoor cat has food , warmth,
affection. given the choice it wouldn't want to die. I can let my cat out
and I'm happy to do so but if I were in a position of having to keep her
indoors or having her destroyed, I would keep her inside.

&gt; I'm sorta gonna change the subject here but our local SPCA is normally
&gt; filled with stray cats as are our local shelters.
&gt; Our's don't. They get put to sleep after a couple of days if unclaimed
which
&gt; basically accounts for the vast majority of them.

"/> Things get bad at our SPCA in the summer, but alot of strays, unless they
catch upper resp,
are usually shuffled from shelter to shelter, and to Petcetra until they are
adopted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I often wonder if this attitude doesn't go a bit too far. We have a local
&gt; organisation which has a similar sentiments and when I went up there, to
say
&gt; that I was, quite frankly, disgusted to see the cats' living environment,
&gt; would be an understatement.
&gt; I found one sickly kitten inside a chair, one dead kitten in the corner of
&gt; the room and ended up coming home with two very very sickly kittens .....
&gt; one of whom died a few days later. Poor wee sod died from starvation
because
&gt; of a mammoth infestation of worms (despite me having taken it to the vet
on
&gt; the way home) ... the &quot;caring&quot; shelter had simply been too over-burdened
to
&gt; take care of all the cats it had....

"/> I notice that a lot of &quot;Animal Aid&quot; shelters out here point accusing fingers
at the SPCA
for lack of effort, cruelty, etc.. yet they are 10 times worse than anything
they could ever
dream we are. At the SPCA there is maximum of two cats in a cage. Their
litter boxes and food and
water are changed twice daily, their bedding is changed once daily.
Volunteers come in and groom
them and pay attention to them. Sounds alot better than that horrific place
you visited.

In situations were this would be /really/ unsafe (no area is 100% safe
of course) then if someone really must have a cat the option is to go
for one that has a medical reason for not going out (illness,
disability, you know what I mean).

Short of that. What you have to weigh up is the loss of life against
the long life of confinement, stress and deprivation.

Some homes will be far better than others. Given an ideal world no cat
would be kept in unless it was for a medical reason, and that is what
we should start working towards. It may take time, but we have to
start.

&gt;&gt; I didn't say your cats are living a less than happy life,

&gt; You said indoor cats are living a &quot;half-life&quot; -- Which &quot;half&quot; are they
&gt; living?

&gt; but I do
&gt;&gt; believe they are missing out.

&gt; You said indoor cats are living a &quot;half-life&quot;. That's a tad more extreme
&gt; than &quot;missing out&quot;.

Fresh water from the tap contains 'chlorine' which some cats do not like, it
is best left standing for 24 hours and the chlorine disappears, and
hopefully the cats will drink it. My three Siamese love drinking my day old
water left on my bedside table! Fi

&gt; Actually if any of the shower products you use contain any forms of

to

I personally don't think as many adult cats are as lactose intolerant as
some people seem to think. Maybe it's just luck, but of 4 cats I've had
over the years, none have been lactose-intolerant. Those who are
intolerant, do develop diarrhea, apparently.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess it's like humans with pop and junk food! :)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fish and dairy are bad for cats? Come again?

&gt;&gt; According to the vets I work with dairy products can cause diaharrea
(sp?)
&gt;&gt; because most
&gt;&gt; cats are lactose intolerant (or something to that effect) and in some
cats
&gt; a
&gt;&gt; diet of fish, canned fish,
&gt;&gt; or fish flavored cat foods can cause crystals to build in the urinary
&gt; tract,
&gt;&gt; eventually blocking the
&gt;&gt; urinary tract and keeping the cat from being able to pee. If not caught
in
&gt;&gt; time it can lead to death.

&gt;&gt; My own personal theory on that is that when cats were wild they probably
&gt; did
&gt;&gt; not eat fish (unless
&gt;&gt; it was found beached or left behind by another animal) because most cats
&gt;&gt; don't like getting wet.

&gt; Hadn't thought about the lactose. Even though I have seen lactose free
milk
&gt; being sold as &quot;kitty milk&quot; in the pet stores.
&gt; But I had thought that *protein* caused crystals to form in certain
animals
&gt; urinary tracts.
&gt; Reason I say this is because that was the case concerning a dalmation my
&gt; sister owned.
&gt; What could possibly be in fish or even fish flavored foods that could have
&gt; this effect on certain animals? Magnesium?
&gt; I mean ...ain't nothin' I'm gonna worry about but geez.
&gt; Besides diaharrea is quite a ...shall we say, noticable, symptom? And so
is
&gt; an animals increasing inability to urinate.
&gt; So I'm going to consider those products safe until proven guilty in a box
of
&gt; litter. But thanks for the tip off.

"/> I agree that we should not dispute Dr. Dodman. Let's see what else he has
to say (from &quot;The Cat Who Cried for Help&quot;):

I have always had concerns about restricting cats' freedom
because it seems so unnatural to confine any creature with
a free spirit. ... I see many cats stressed as a result of confinement.

The situation reminds me of Chief Seattle's famous speech as he signed
over his tribe's lands to the white man, cautioning that [this] would
lead
to an existence of mere survival instead of one in which people take joy
in living. I sometimes wonder we aren't guilty of creating a similar
situation
for our pets when we incarcerate them. It's safer, yes, but at what
cost?

Some people may disagree, saying that outside life is stressful, too,
and
a darn sight more dangerous. In a way they're right, and in a way
they're
not. Indoor life is associated with more behavior problems.

Owning an indoor/outdoor cat, what I call the British solution, may be
something of a compromise, but I see it as the nearest thing to
achieving the best of both worlds.

&gt;&gt;Just to make a point (and I am not trying to suggest that you don't care

&gt;&gt;access via a cat flap) and I also buy them toys, play with them, pet
&gt;&gt;them, care for them, love them. My cats are 2 years old and very
&gt;&gt;playful. Thay both love their toys and I regularly buy them different
&gt;&gt;toys (they don't like exactly the same toys) and play with them a lot.
&gt;&gt;They love to play with us and they also like to go outside. Just
&gt;&gt;because your cats go out doesn't necessarily mean that you don't put
&gt;&gt;effort into giving your cat fun and stimulation in its life. I think my
&gt;&gt;cats have got the best of both worlds - pampering indoors and the chance
&gt;&gt;to go out and be a tiger whenever they choose.

this is a non-negotiable item ...&quot;

&gt;&gt; I belive we who keep our cats indoors put a lot of effort in making our cats

&gt; This may be true, of you, but people like you are not the problem. The
&gt; problem is that is everyone gets the idea that indoors is possible
&gt; (let alone preferred) then you get many people who will not be able to
&gt; offer their indoor cats even a half life.

&gt;&gt; We play with them, give them toys, pay them

&gt;&gt;&gt; all the indoor/outdoor
&gt;&gt;&gt; cats I have seen in the clinic I work in. The only difference I can see is
&gt;&gt;&gt; that my cats are completely healthy.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They don't have fleas or worms, they don't have abscesses or broken bones.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They don't have scars from
&gt;&gt;&gt; old cat fights.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am not saying my cats are better off than everyone else's indoor/outdoor
&gt;&gt;&gt; cats.. but I sure feel that they
&gt;&gt;&gt; are safe and happy indoors.

&gt;&gt; Agree.
&gt;&gt; As I've said befor: a cat who is not satisfied with something will show it
&gt;&gt; and there is no way one could ignore that.

&gt; But it appears some people do ignore it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not really. You know most cats go through their lives without major
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;disease.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know that mine are less likely to catch something infectious indoors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than outdoors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But when they do catch something they are likely to get it worse.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you saying that outdoor cats build up a resistance to infectious
&gt;&gt;&gt;diseases? Or what?

&gt;&gt;Yes. Just like a human.

&gt;So I can build up a resitance to AIDS or the Ebola virus?

"/> You build up resistance to a lot of illnesses - that is a big part of
how the immune system works.

In the cat a kitten will inherit certain immunity from its mother,
from then on in it need to build its immunity through life. One reason
why lab animals are kept isolated from outside animals so their
immunity levels are controllable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just to make a point (and I am not trying to suggest that you don't care
&gt;&gt;&gt;for your cats well) but I have 2 indoor/outdoor cats (they have free
&gt;&gt;&gt;access via a cat flap) and I also buy them toys, play with them, pet
&gt;&gt;&gt;them, care for them, love them. My cats are 2 years old and very
&gt;&gt;&gt;playful. Thay both love their toys and I regularly buy them different
&gt;&gt;&gt;toys (they don't like exactly the same toys) and play with them a lot.
&gt;&gt;&gt;They love to play with us and they also like to go outside. Just
&gt;&gt;&gt;because your cats go out doesn't necessarily mean that you don't put
&gt;&gt;&gt;effort into giving your cat fun and stimulation in its life. I think my
&gt;&gt;&gt;cats have got the best of both worlds - pampering indoors and the chance
&gt;&gt;&gt;to go out and be a tiger whenever they choose.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just to make a point (and I am not trying to suggest that you don't care
&gt;&gt;&gt;for your cats well) but I have 2 indoor/outdoor cats (they have free
&gt;&gt;&gt;access via a cat flap) and I also buy them toys, play with them, pet
&gt;&gt;&gt;them, care for them, love them. My cats are 2 years old and very
&gt;&gt;&gt;playful. Thay both love their toys and I regularly buy them different
&gt;&gt;&gt;toys (they don't like exactly the same toys) and play with them a lot.
&gt;&gt;&gt;They love to play with us and they also like to go outside. Just
&gt;&gt;&gt;because your cats go out doesn't necessarily mean that you don't put
&gt;&gt;&gt;effort into giving your cat fun and stimulation in its life. I think my
&gt;&gt;&gt;cats have got the best of both worlds - pampering indoors and the chance
&gt;&gt;&gt;to go out and be a tiger whenever they choose.

&gt;&gt; Hanna
&gt;&gt; I didn't intend to make it look like indoor/outdoor cats are not as loved as
&gt;&gt; indoor only, just that indoor cats are very well taken care of and not
&gt;&gt; necessarily lead dull and boring lives.

&gt;&gt; I'm sorry if I've offended you or anyone else.

&gt;I get your point and am not offended at all. People in this discussion
&gt;are far too inclined to take every small (or potential) disagreement as

"/> A few years ago that was added to many dry food packets. At that time
most dry was removed from the shelves in the UK.

These day the stuff is better, but even the lowest quality tinned is
better for your cat than the best dry.

Giving a little helps exercise their jaws and will not hurt their
health, but make sure you never exceed 30% dry per day.

I feed mine tinned Whiskas or Felix morning and night, with a few
biscuits or a foil pouch for lunch.

&gt;&gt;opportunity to expose you as the uninformed, ignorant, parrot that you

&gt;&gt;&quot;The word about the dangers of outdoor living must be out, because about
&gt;&gt;half of America's sixty million cats are currently living indoors.&quot;

&gt;&gt;Go ahead, make a bigger fool of yourself than you already have (if that's
&gt;&gt;even possible) and dispute Dr. Dodman....

&gt; A source for that figure of 60 million? Its just that it differs from
&gt; all that I can find so I would like to base my response on a fairly
&gt; respected figure?

decision in different circumstances. I am aware that my cats ARE
exposed to some more risks by being allowed out, but I believe they are
outweighed by the quality of life which they have. They are only
allowed out of the back where it is not too easy for them to get to the
road (although one of them does occasionally) and even if they get to
the road it is a very quiet street. They are microchipped and also wear
(breakaway) collars, minimising the risk of them going missing never to
be found again. They are neutered, fully vaccinated, regularly wormed
and de-fleaed, regular health checks at the vets, trying to start tooth
cleaning but not going well at the moment. That is my decision made
with open eyes and the best interests of my cats at heart. They also
have lots of toys, games and fuss with us inside. I think they have a
good life (they are not complaining).

There was an Horizon program on the subject around this time last year

small infections so the bigger ones get through.

First off.... I am a Canadian who has visited England (London and
surrounding areas) and other than our much harsher winters here, I do
not see any less risk for cats to roam free there than here...
So what makes Britain such a safe place for cats to roam than North
America?

Cats are at greater risk of being hurt by a Mad Cow there than on a
farm here, not to mention they have to learn to look in opposite
directions there before crossing the road safely. And what about that
fog they have to navigate through hahahaha *JOKE*

Secondly, I would rather have a cat live half a life as a family
member indoors for 15+ years (like my oldest surviving cat right now,
previous to her, I had Misha who lived to be 24yrs.) than have a cat
with a so called &quot;Full Life&quot; that is lucky if it lives to be 5 years
of age.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;The word about the dangers of outdoor living must be out, because about
&gt;&gt;&gt;half of America's sixty million cats are currently living indoors.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Dr. Nicholas Dodman, Professor of Behavioral Pharmacology and Director of
&gt;&gt;&gt;the Behavior Clinic at Tufts University School
&gt;&gt;&gt;of Veterinary Medicine and internationally known specialist in domestic
&gt;&gt;&gt;animal behavioral research.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Go ahead, make a bigger fool of yourself than you already have (if that's
&gt;&gt;&gt;even possible) and dispute Dr. Dodman....

&gt;&gt; A source for that figure of 60 million? Its just that it differs from
&gt;&gt; all that I can find so I would like to base my response on a fairly
&gt;&gt; respected figure?

&gt;I don't think you can count to 6, much less to 60 million. But here's 2
&gt;links that I found in about a minute of searching. Not looking very hard
&gt;are you?

&gt;Here's one for 70 million:
&gt;http://www.csmonitor.com/durable/2000/03/06/p16s2.htm
&gt;Here's one for 66 million:  http://www.hsfn.org/catinfo.htm

&gt;ESAD
&gt;Dave

"/> The 66 million fits close with the source I have which puts it at 58
million owned cats. 65% of which are outdoor or indoor/outdoor cats.

If we use the 66 million (as it falls in the middle) that gives nearly
43 million owned cats in the USA with access to what everyone (well
every American here it seems) is claiming is a lethal environment.

So. Add in the millions of cats who are feral and you see that even in
the USA the number of indoor cats is still very much in the minority.
A large minority it is true. But you have a large majority that are
living full and active lives.

&gt;&gt;-This site, and others like it come up every so often. In truth, while
&gt;&gt;-the figures given have an air of authority, they fail to present what
&gt;&gt;-is really important - the actual effect on the animal population.
&gt;&gt;-
&gt;&gt;-Also, their idea of feral cat management goes against most experts
&gt;&gt;-I've ever read.
&gt;&gt;-
&gt;&gt;---
&gt;&gt;-Bob.
&gt;&gt;-

&gt;Well Bob.... it would make sense as with other creatures, food supply
&gt;does seem to influence population....
&gt;If there is less food available for ferals, then their population
&gt;stays down, reducing the number of cats killing wildlife.

"/> Actually the reverse would be true. If you feed the ferals there will
be less need for them to kill wildlife.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Unless your going to take in every feral cat that you feed and have it
&gt;neutered?

"/> Well the neutering is something that most of the feral groups do
target quite heavily.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Also the site that I posted was a State site, not just a personal
&gt;webpage with one person's opinion. it &quot;appeared&quot; to me they had at
&gt;least done some research and showed alot of referrence to back their
&gt;views....

"/> Ah. Yes, they do their statistical counts. Most of the figures they
give actually ring reasonably true. But what the do not do is to put
those figures in context. You need to know not the number of a
particular animal killed but the effect on its total population over a
period of time.

"/> I'm not going to hold my breath on this one, though. ;-)

If traffic weren't a danger, I'd let my cats out during the day, when I'm at
home - no crazy/cruel neighbors, AFAIK, no predators, etc. If anything, the
cats would pose a problem to the birds, chipmunks, &amp; rabbits; the gray
squirrels seem to be able to escape from cats, chattering/swearing at them
from high up in trees. But traffic is a very real danger in this
neighborhood, &amp; I would worry about antifreeze, etc. to a degree.

The way I see it, I think you're exposing your cats to suffering by being
run over by cars, truck, buses, and even trains by which limbs have been
severed; exposing them to suffering from fatal, infectious diseases;
exposing them to suffering by being ripped apart by dogs; exposing them to
suffering from poisoning (plants, chemicals); exposing them to suffering
from serious wounds from cat fights.

The way I see it, you have no choice but to stand by - because there's not a
damn thing you can do about it. Its about time you faced that fact. People
will make their own decisions about what is best for their cats and will not
allow you to bully them into doing what you tell them to do, nor will they
allow you to lay a cheap, guilt-trip con game on them to do what you want.
People *know* their cats *better* than you. Your guilt-trip is a one way
ride. But you have to resort to a cheap guilt-trip because you have nothing
else to back you up.

You have no choice *but* to &quot;stand by&quot;. And I hope it twists your guts into
knots.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;minimise their exposure to such diseases.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The thing is that, given the way the immune system works, you never
&gt;&gt;&gt;know. Already people have been found who are immune to the human AIDS
&gt;&gt;&gt;virus, almost certainly an acquired immunity not a genetic immunity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But apart form a few big diseases, most illnesses are less in a cat
&gt;&gt;&gt;with an immune system that is kept in full working order by exposure
&gt;&gt;&gt;to minor ailments.

&gt;&gt;This may be valid for some minor infectious diseases (to which my cats
&gt;&gt;aren't exposed anyway) but I doubt it makes any difference in the case
&gt;&gt;of degenerative diseases such as those of the kidneys.

&gt;It is the minor infectious diseases that help to build immunity to the

&gt;-Actually the reverse would be true. If you feed the ferals there will
&gt;-be less need for them to kill wildlife.

"/> I beg to differ...... I have seen plenty of well fed pets (not ferals)
killing wildlife just for the fun of it... I have picked up their
spoils myself... so why would feeding ferals decrease their killing
instict?

which only angers me to no end, as my 3 cats are strictly indoor, they
don't even bother with my conure unless my conure alerts them to a
strange cat outside his window. then they all come running to see what
the alarm is about. I don't understand why it is I can enjoy my
cats, and enjoy my bird watching, but still have to clean up after
other peoples cats outside!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;-
&gt;-Ah. Yes, they do their statistical counts. Most of the figures they
&gt;-give actually ring reasonably true. But what they do not do is to put
&gt;-those figures in context. You need to know not the number of a
&gt;-particular animal killed but the effect on its total population over a
&gt;-period of time.

"/> To quote the site I referred to:

&quot;Despite the difficulties in showing the effect most predators have on
their prey, cats are known to have serious impacts on small mammals
and birds. Worldwide, cats may have been involved in the
extinction of more bird species than any other cause, except habitat
destruction. Cats are contributing to the endangerment of populations
of birds such as Least Terns, Piping Plovers and LoggerheadShrikes. In
Florida, marsh rabbits in Key West have been threatened by predation
from domestic cats [11]. Cats introduced by people living on the
barrier islands of Florida's coast have depleted several unique
species of mice and woodrats to near extinction [12, 13]. &quot;

I don't think time frame is really as much a factor as the actual
effect that these cats are having on the wildlife mentioned, they
don't even mention statistics here they mearly point out the damage
done according to their research. (which is the bottom line). They do
also mention habitat destruction as another factor, but perhaps the
effects would not be so devastating without felines adding to injury.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;-
&gt;-As long as you look at the details with a great deal of caution :)
&gt;-Bob.

"/> Oh yes, the same way I post to news groups with caution :)
I prefer mostly to post according to my own personal experience based
on what I know first hand and try not to assume someone elses
circumstance, unless &quot;I have been there... done that&quot;.

&gt; exposing them to suffering by being ripped apart by dogs; exposing them to

"/> Thanks very much, again it's good to be able to discuss these issues
(indoor/outdoor) and the others which concern us all (the welfare of our
cats) without any climbing onto high horses. I know what you mean about
tooth cleaning, I took Diblo and Roxy for their check-ups and booster
vaccinations a couple of weeks ago and was told:
A) Roxy is a little overweight (which we knew and are attempting to
rectify although it's difficult to stop her from eating Diblo's dinner
as she's greedy and he's a snacker).
B) Diblo has tartar on his teeth and they are going to need cleaning by
the vet in approximately 6 months. She advised me to start cleaning his
teeth, and I figured if I'm going to do one I might as well do both of
them (even though Roxy's teeth are fine - they both have exactly the
same diet and are the same age, brother and sister so who knows why?).
Oh the perversity of cats! Roxy (whose teeth are fine) is quite happy
to have her teeth brushed. Diblo (who's heading for a general
anaesthetic to have his teeth scraped) doesn't want to know. This
didn't entirely surprise me as although under most circumstances he is
the most placid cat in the universe, he goes loopy when you try to give
him a pill or put him in his cat basket. I'm going to keep trying
though - I gave it a break for a few days and I think I should try again
this evening. He's a very big strong cat though - if he struggles I
really can't hold onto him. Wish me luck!! They are both snoozing
underneath the radiator at the moment in a big furry heap.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Actually the reverse would be true. If you feed the ferals there will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-be less need for them to kill wildlife.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I beg to differ...... I have seen plenty of well fed pets (not ferals)
&gt;&gt;&gt;killing wildlife just for the fun of it... I have picked up their

&gt; You're a sick piece of work. You dispute Peter Neville when I quoted him,
&gt; then you cite a reference with a quote from him!!!

&gt;&quot;Peter Neville, a pet behaviorist and author of many books on cats, worked
&gt; in England for two decades with feral colonies. Neville states, &quot;a
&gt; deliberate strategy of scavenging has enabled many feral cats almost to give
&gt; up hunting altogether. They may learn instead to lie around waste bins of
&gt; hotels for fresh supplies or to cadge from well-meaning human providers in
&gt; urban areas.&quot;

&gt; You didn't seem to think Peter Neville had any credibility when he said
&gt; this:

&gt;&quot;Availability and dispersion of food: feral cats which support themselves by
&gt; hunting prey dispersed over a wide area tend to lead solitary lives. When
&gt; there is an abundant food source concentrated at one point (e.g. when a cat
&gt; lover regularly puts out food) a relatively stable group of cats tends to
&gt; form around it &quot;

&gt; Just goes to prove the fact that you're a manipulating, convoluting SOB.

&gt;&gt; It is long, and takes a little reading but it does put things a little
&gt;&gt; more in perspective.

&gt; You mean like this -- about no cat problem in the UK?

&gt; UK News Electronic Telegraph
&gt; Sunday 4 January 1998
&gt; Issue 954

&gt; RSPCA fears growth of the feral cat
&gt; By Greg Neale and John Dean

&gt; BRITAIN is facing a huge increase in the number of feral cats, according to
&gt; the RSPCA. It says the cats - pets and their offspring that have gone wild -
&gt; are a problem in both towns and the countryside.

&gt; The RSPCA has issued an appeal to people who may have been given kittens as
&gt; Christmas presents to make sure that they do not become unwanted. It is
&gt; particularly concerned that - unless they specifically want their pets to
&gt; breed - cat owners should have them neutered.

&gt; The charity says that although statistics are insufficient to chart the
&gt; growth of the feral cat population, animal welfare workers across the
&gt; country suggested it was mushrooming.

&gt; Jo Crozier, an RSPCA spokesman, said that while some owners took unwanted
&gt; pets to the association or animal sanctuaries for adoption, many abandoned
&gt; them. Discarded cats are breeding in many towns, in some cases establishing
&gt; colonies, and scavenging from dustbins and rubbish tips.

&gt; Maggie Eden, the manager of the RSPCA's Great Ayton animal rescue centre
&gt; near Middlesbrough, said the situation had grown worse in the last decade.
&gt;&quot;It is way out of control.&quot;

&gt; How's that perspective.....? Can't wait to watch you squirm and convolute
&gt; your way out of this one, although I'm betting you'll sure try!

"/> He'll claim they are wrong and don't know what they're talking about... just
as he claims abotu eveyone who disagrees with him.. including the HSUS.

That's good. Alexia like tuna. How often can i give her tuna?
As I've understood it, they should not eat tuna to often?

Doing a quick tab just now, I counted 17 cats (friends, neighbors, family -
all in the NE US - in the countryside, in residential areas of small cities,
&amp; suburban) that I've known over the years, who've been inside/outside cats.
Of those 17 cats, 4 died in traffic accidents - by the age of 3. That a
23.5%-age. Too large of a minority for my peace of mind. (And one of the
survivors is the 9 yr. old cat who had the broken pelvis, another lesser car
accident, &amp; the fence accident.)

"/> So? What about all the cats that did not suffer the accidents? Last
year (well 1999) there were 4 children under the age of 7 killed in
the UK by falling down stairs. 23 suffered major spinal damage causing
long term disability. Does that mean we ban all kids under 7 from
using stairs?

Were do you draw the line? There is no such thing as a 100% safe
environment - it cannot exist. So what you have to do is balance the
risks against their quality of life. An indoor/outdoor cat has a
better quality of life - that is what it comes down to.

If things are too dangerous in your area then please, do not have cats
- that is the only valid answer.

&gt; Issue 954

&gt;RSPCA fears growth of the feral cat
&gt;By Greg Neale and John Dean

&gt;BRITAIN is facing a huge increase in the number of feral cats, according to
&gt;the RSPCA. It says the cats - pets and their offspring that have gone wild -
&gt;are a problem in both towns and the countryside.

&gt;The RSPCA has issued an appeal to people who may have been given kittens as
&gt;Christmas presents to make sure that they do not become unwanted. It is
&gt;particularly concerned that - unless they specifically want their pets to
&gt;breed - cat owners should have them neutered.

&gt;The charity says that although statistics are insufficient to chart the
&gt;growth of the feral cat population, animal welfare workers across the
&gt;country suggested it was mushrooming.

&gt; Jo Crozier, an RSPCA spokesman, said that while some owners took unwanted
&gt;pets to the association or animal sanctuaries for adoption, many abandoned
&gt;them. Discarded cats are breeding in many towns, in some cases establishing
&gt;colonies, and scavenging from dustbins and rubbish tips.

&gt;Maggie Eden, the manager of the RSPCA's Great Ayton animal rescue centre
&gt;near Middlesbrough, said the situation had grown worse in the last decade.
&gt;&quot;It is way out of control.&quot;

&gt;How's that perspective.....? Can't wait to watch you squirm and convolute
&gt;your way out of this one, although I'm betting you'll sure try!

"/> I have already proven to you that there is not big overpopulation
problem in the UK. Other UK posters have said the same. There are
feral cats in the UK, their numbers, like the numbers of most wildlife
in the UK, is growing. That does not make it a problem.

the
&gt;&gt;survivors is the 9 yr. old cat who had the broken pelvis, another lesser
car

in cruel conditions with half lives?

This debate is terrible but I must admit I am hooked, it must be doing
me some sort of underlying therapy to be able to vent this way!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thanks very much, again it's good to be able to discuss these issues
&gt; (indoor/outdoor) and the others which concern us all (the welfare of our
&gt; cats) without any climbing onto high horses. I know what you mean about
&gt; tooth cleaning, I took Diblo and Roxy for their check-ups and booster
&gt; vaccinations a couple of weeks ago and was told:
&gt; A) Roxy is a little overweight (which we knew and are attempting to
&gt; rectify although it's difficult to stop her from eating Diblo's dinner
&gt; as she's greedy and he's a snacker).
&gt; B) Diblo has tartar on his teeth and they are going to need cleaning by
&gt; the vet in approximately 6 months. She advised me to start cleaning his
&gt; teeth, and I figured if I'm going to do one I might as well do both of
&gt; them (even though Roxy's teeth are fine - they both have exactly the
&gt; same diet and are the same age, brother and sister so who knows why?).
&gt; Oh the perversity of cats! Roxy (whose teeth are fine) is quite happy
&gt; to have her teeth brushed. Diblo (who's heading for a general
&gt; anaesthetic to have his teeth scraped) doesn't want to know. This
&gt; didn't entirely surprise me as although under most circumstances he is
&gt; the most placid cat in the universe, he goes loopy when you try to give
&gt; him a pill or put him in his cat basket. I'm going to keep trying
&gt; though - I gave it a break for a few days and I think I should try again
&gt; this evening. He's a very big strong cat though - if he struggles I
&gt; really can't hold onto him. Wish me luck!! They are both snoozing
&gt; underneath the radiator at the moment in a big furry heap.
&gt; Hannah

"/> Yeah, I know.. I am supposed to start cleaning Ally's teeth too. She hates
being
restrained in any fashion. I haven't had to pill her yet, thank God, but
even trimming
her nails can be a wrestling match. She has gotten better about that though.

Cobee may not be as much of a problem as he is very easy to pill, but I
still don't think
he is going to be thrilled with having a tooth brush popped in his puss!

Ciao for now,
Susan

there is still traffic, amongst other dangers there, that your cats

In the 24 years that my oldest cat lived, other than being spayed and
getting her initial shots, never had to visit a vet for illness or
injury. (BTW she was a great mouser, without having to go outdoors!)
Can you say the same about your old cats? Have any of YOUR cats lived
that long without illness or injury?

Darlene

In memory of Misha  http://www.geocities.com/ddesmar/misha

the picture of her there was taken not long before she was put to
rest. The last 6 months of her life, was like someone was turning her
off with a dimmer switch. She was senile and very fragile at that
point and could hardly stand. The only &quot;normal&quot; function she had left
was her appetite. She never cried with any pain, never complained.
I had to carry her downstairs to eat at meal times.
It was the hardest decission I ever had to make, but I couldn't go on
wondering if every time we left the house, we would come home and find
her in a permanent sleep. (near the end she always slept on my
daughter's bed and I didn't want my daughter to wake up and find her
&quot;gone&quot; next to her).
when we took her to the vet for that last trip, the vets were
astonished at how she looked for her age, yet couldn't believe how
fragile she was to the touch, they agreed it was time and a tear came
to their eyes along with ours....

&gt;&gt;&gt;You mean those cats who died young don't *count*, because they're in the

&gt;&gt;&gt;example.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Doing a quick tab just now, I counted 17 cats (friends, neighbors,
&gt;family -
&gt;&gt;&gt;all in the NE US - in the countryside, in residential areas of small
&gt;cities,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&amp; suburban) that I've known over the years, who've been inside/outside
&gt;cats.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Of those 17 cats, 4 died in traffic accidents - by the age of 3. That a
&gt;&gt;&gt;23.5%-age. Too large of a minority for my peace of mind. (And one of
&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;survivors is the 9 yr. old cat who had the broken pelvis, another lesser
&gt;car
&gt;&gt;&gt;accident, &amp; the fence accident.)

&gt;&gt; So? What about all the cats that did not suffer the accidents?

&gt;You're still ignoring the ones who *did*. The 23.5%.

one of the kittens. The next was a literally starving stray found in the

were completely clogged w/ asst. debris, rendering him partially (but
temporarily, until he had a deep-ear cleaning) deaf, along w/ coughing &amp;

&gt;rest. The last 6 months of her life, was like someone was turning her
&gt;off with a dimmer switch. She was senile and very fragile at that
&gt;point and could hardly stand. The only &quot;normal&quot; function she had left

the garden during the daylight ours - loves watching the cars go past
if she is out the front or the trains if she is out the back. She is
now quite slow on her feet until she knows there is food in the
offing.

She is at least 23. They have had her for 20 years and she was at
least three when they got her. She is now very thin, but eats well.

&gt;&gt; animals. This appears form web sites to also be true for several major
&gt;&gt; brands in the USA. I would not rate antifreeze as a major risk to
&gt;&gt; cats.

&gt;It is not a major problem in terms of number of occurances, but once
&gt;ingested, it is a *major* problem, as in potentially lethal.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course accidents occur - to all ages, in a huge variety
&gt;&gt;&gt;of circumstances. But cats do not understand:

&gt;&gt; I think you underestimate cats.

&gt;Remember the 23.5% of indoor/outdoor cats that I've personally known who who
&gt;were hit &amp; killed by cars? You mean to say that *your* own cats understand
&gt;fully the dangers of traffic, and the admonition of, &quot;Please do not cross
&gt;the road, Kitty. Cars, trucks, &amp; vans are very dangerous &amp; often lethal to
&gt;small animals, including cats&quot; ?O-kay...

"/> Yes of course my cats understand the dangers of traffic. They learnt
to cross the road when they were young, as all cats do in the UK. Ok
some don't learn well enough, I think I worked out some time back that
in this road we had lost around 1 in 200 cats to car accidents in the
25+ years I've lived here. I think we are fairly typical.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Were do you draw the line? There is no such thing as a 100% safe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; environment - it cannot exist. So what you have to do is balance the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; risks against their quality of life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bingo. I *have* assessed the risk. And over a 20% risk is way too high,
&gt;&gt;&gt;IMO. Who wants to lose approx. 1 out of every 5 cats to car accidents?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Not me. My cats get their fresh air out on the screened porch.

&gt;&gt; That is not acceptable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Why do you have cats if you don't let them

&gt;How about... there is an overpopulation of cats - many waiting in shelters,

&gt;first cat was adopted from a friend whose friend's cat got pregnant &amp; the
&gt;friend's friend did not then want the cat or the resultant kittens - I took
&gt;one of the kittens. The next was a literally starving stray found in the

&gt;were completely clogged w/ asst. debris, rendering him partially (but

&gt;sneezing. Personally, I think these 4 cats were lucky to have been adopted;
&gt;if you think not, that it's unacceptable that they are indoor/screened-porch

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; An indoor/outdoor cat has a

&gt;Your absolute, B&amp;W, answer again. And who *is* then going to adopt all of
&gt;the homeless strays &amp; shelter cats, if you immediately blip all out of the
&gt;potential owners who will keep the cats inside, for their own safety,
&gt;because of their locales?? You really, truly, don't seem to get the point
&gt;that there is a cat overpopulation problem.

"/> Is there? Our country if far warmer than yours so our breeding season
should in theory be longer. We don't have an overpopulation problem.

Oh I know it is hard for you to accept, but the cat, like any other
animal really is not very happy when it is removed from nature. It is
just selfish to keep cats if you can't give the a proper cat
lifestyle.

See this is why the UK uses &quot;Seeing-Eye Cats&quot; instead of &quot;Seeing-Eye Dogs&quot;
for blind people. Each dog takes many months and thousands of dollars to
train. A kitten learns to navigate cross-walks and traffic lights in just a
few weeks by itself without training.

Just a little UK trivia ;-)

&gt;&gt;Certain types of fish, such as carp and herring, contain a compound
&gt;&gt;(thiaminase) that destroys thiamin, a B vitamin, and may cause a thiamin
&gt;&gt;deficiency. Cooking detroys this compound. Raw fish should never be fed
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;cats. Bones are another concern.

&gt;&gt;Gotta be careful with salmon and trout, too - can be infected with
&gt;&gt;Neorickettsia helminthoeca or Neorickettsia elokominica - causes an
acute
&gt;&gt;systemic disease called salmon poisoning. There's a 90% mortality rate
in
&gt;&gt;untreated cases - death occurs 5-12 days after ingestion of the organism.

&gt;&gt;Tuna is ok a treat as long as its packed in water and not oil.

&gt; Phil
&gt; That's good. Alexia like tuna. How often can i give her tuna?
&gt; As I've understood it, they should not eat tuna to often?

"/> Hi Lotta,

Sorry for the delayed response, I took this thread off watched status - a
mutual friend emailed me about your post.

Tuna is ok as an occasional treat, but fed too often, cats can become &quot;tuna
junkies&quot; and refuse their regular food. Also, the calcium-to-phosphorus
ratio is way off.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; How about macherel? They both like the one in tomatosuce.

"/> Mackerel is in the same family as tuna. The bigger mackerels, the giant
king mackerel in particular, may carry ciguatoxins, responsible for a
serious form of food poisoning (ciguatera poisoning), and this applies to
fresh, frozen, canned and salted mackerel alike. What happens is this: A
protozoan attaches itself to coral algae and produces a poison called
ciguatoxin. Small fish eat the algae, poison and all; bigger fish eat the
small fish, which are in turn gobbled up by still bigger fish. And so it
goes up the food chain, the oil-soluble ciguatoxin becoming more
concentrated each step of the way. The trouble with ciguatoxin is that
there's no way to detect its presence in fish. And no way to destroy it.
Cooking doesn't help, nor do soaking, smoking, pickling, canning, freezing,
drying. If you're gonna feed Mackeral, make sure you buy the smallest fish
you can find -- and *don't* buy fillet! -- it may have been cut from a
150-pounder loaded with ciguatoxin!!!

Gerry,
I've said this before but thousands of cats here live indoor/outdoor . They
don't get run over /poisoned /eaten by wild animals. I/ve had three cats
that lived to 16/17/19 years old. My friend a few miles away has two 16
years old cats.

&gt; See this is why the UK uses &quot;Seeing-Eye Cats&quot; instead of &quot;Seeing-Eye Dogs&quot;

a

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes of course my cats understand the dangers of traffic. They learnt
&gt;&gt;&gt; to cross the road when they were young, as all cats do in the UK.

&gt;&gt; LOL! Yeah, right, they're all traffic-smart, *and* now you're speaking
&gt; for
&gt;&gt; all of the UK instead of just your own cats. A tad presumptuous of you,
&gt;&gt; n'est-ce pas? Tell you what - you get your cats to be turn-key
&gt; instructors
&gt;&gt; for my cats, so that they completely understand that they are not to
cross
&gt;&gt; the streets, &amp; then mine will be allowed out, when I'm at home.

&gt;&gt; Ok
&gt;&gt;&gt; some don't learn well enough, I think I worked out some time back that
&gt;&gt;&gt; in this road we had lost around 1 in 200 cats to car accidents in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; 25+ years I've lived here. I think we are fairly typical.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Were do you draw the line? There is no such thing as a 100% safe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; environment - it cannot exist. So what you have to do is balance
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; risks against their quality of life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bingo. I *have* assessed the risk. And over a 20% risk is way
too
&gt;&gt; high,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;IMO. Who wants to lose approx. 1 out of every 5 cats to car
&gt;&gt; accidents?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not me. My cats get their fresh air out on the screened porch.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is not acceptable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not acceptable to whom? You? Too bad. Live w/ it. ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt; No. To the cats. The deserve better.

&gt;&gt; Re-read below - they were either considered redundant by their owner,
were
&gt;&gt; strays - in need of medical attention, or else were in the shelter.
They
&gt;&gt; did deserve better; they got adopted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why do you have cats if you don't let them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How about... there is an overpopulation of cats - many waiting in
&gt;&gt; shelters,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;others who are strays/homeless, coupled w/ the fact that I love cats?
&gt; My
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;first cat was adopted from a friend whose friend's cat got pregnant &amp;
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;friend's friend did not then want the cat or the resultant kittens -
I
&gt;&gt; took
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;one of the kittens. The next was a literally starving stray found in
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;middle of winter, the 3rd was in the Humane Society shelter, &amp; the
most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recent adoptee was a stray - full of fleas, worms, &amp; ear mites - his
&gt; ears
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;were completely clogged w/ asst. debris, rendering him partially (but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;temporarily, until he had a deep-ear cleaning) deaf, along w/
coughing
&gt;&amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sneezing. Personally, I think these 4 cats were lucky to have been
&gt;&gt; adopted;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if you think not, that it's unacceptable that they are
&gt;&gt; indoor/screened-porch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&amp; window cats, that's *your* problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No. Not my problem, the cats problem - they are the ones being
&gt;&gt;&gt; deprived.
&gt;&gt;&lt;a whole lot snipped&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob.

&gt;&gt; What, of a life, along w/ proper medical attention? Wake up, already.

&gt;Oh what bull crap. What does that have to do with how long indoor/outdoor
&gt;cats live on average to indoor only cats? That's like saying your NASDAQ

&gt;last year, while my portfolio heavy in financials, oil, insurance, and gas
&gt;pipelines have also experienced some upside. However, your portfolio would
&gt;be down 52% for the last 52 weeks, mine would be up 87% for the last 52

&gt;Therefor backup that claim with referenced statistics, or shut your &quot;arse&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Josh you little troll you. We have, on many occasions in the past,
&gt;&gt;&gt; talked about the length of lives of our cats. The conclusions was that
&gt;&gt;&gt; all of us in the UK have or know cats who are just as old as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; oldest you have in the USA. Our cats are of course indoors/outdoors.

&gt;&gt;Oh what bull crap. What does that have to do with how long
indoor/outdoor
&gt;&gt;cats live on average to indoor only cats? That's like saying your NASDAQ
&gt;&gt;heavy portfolio has a *couple* examples of stocks that have doubled in
the
&gt;&gt;last year, while my portfolio heavy in financials, oil, insurance, and
gas
&gt;&gt;pipelines have also experienced some upside. However, your portfolio
would
&gt;&gt;be down 52% for the last 52 weeks, mine would be up 87% for the last 52
&gt;&gt;weeks.

&gt;&gt;Jeez, do you ever make any sense? Have you ever tried? You made a
claim.
&gt;&gt;Therefor backup that claim with referenced statistics, or shut your
&quot;arse&quot;
&gt;&gt;hole.

&gt;&gt;Gerry

&gt; The &quot;statistics&quot; were gathered on this newsgroup several times last
&gt; year. They showed that our indoor/outdoors cats lived just as long are
&gt; your indoor only cats.

&gt; Gerry,
&gt; I've said this before but thousands of cats here live indoor/outdoor .
They
&gt; don't get run over /poisoned /eaten by wild animals. I/ve had three cats

&gt; years old cats.

"/> Only thousands? I thought it would be more. Here in North America, there
are 100's of thousands indoor/outdoor cats at least. However, unlike the
fact that no UK outdoor/indoor cat has ever been runover/poisoned/lost etc.
as you claim, many of among those 100's of thousands on this side of the
pond do. This probably explains why many in North America choose to keep
their cats indoors.

Anyway, I'm not sure what your post had to do with my joke about
&quot;seeing-eye&quot; cats. Err... or do you really use cats instead of dogs to lead
the blind in your country? Perhaps that's why you didn't get it.

&gt;&gt;Hi Lotta,

&gt;&gt;Sorry for the delayed response, I took this thread off watched status - a
&gt;&gt;mutual friend emailed me about your post.

&gt; Than you &quot;mutual friend&quot; :-)

&gt;&gt;Tuna is ok as an occasional treat, but fed too often, cats can become
&quot;tuna
&gt;&gt;junkies&quot; and refuse their regular food. Also, the calcium-to-phosphorus
&gt;&gt;ratio is way off.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How about macherel? They both like the one in tomatosuce.

&gt;&gt;Mackerel is in the same family as tuna. The bigger mackerels, the giant
&gt;&gt;king mackerel in particular, may carry ciguatoxins, responsible for a
&gt;&gt;serious form of food poisoning (ciguatera poisoning), and this applies to
&gt;&gt;fresh, frozen, canned and salted mackerel alike. What happens is this: A
&gt;&gt;protozoan attaches itself to coral algae and produces a poison called
&gt;&gt;ciguatoxin. Small fish eat the algae, poison and all; bigger fish eat the
&gt;&gt;small fish, which are in turn gobbled up by still bigger fish. And so it
&gt;&gt;goes up the food chain, the oil-soluble ciguatoxin becoming more
&gt;&gt;concentrated each step of the way. The trouble with ciguatoxin is that
&gt;&gt;there's no way to detect its presence in fish. And no way to destroy it.
&gt;&gt;Cooking doesn't help, nor do soaking, smoking, pickling, canning,
freezing,
&gt;&gt;drying. If you're gonna feed Mackeral, make sure you buy the smallest
fish
&gt;&gt;you can find -- and *don't* buy fillet! -- it may have been cut from a
&gt;&gt;150-pounder loaded with ciguatoxin!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; (I tried Perch as you suggested, but I had to eat it myself. At least I
&gt;&gt;&gt; liked it.)

&gt;&gt;At least it didn't go to waste. ;) Try to get them used to chuck steak
or
&gt;&gt;prime rib marbled with fat. My ladies *love* them, rare, as treats. My
&gt;&gt;butcher jokes about my cats eating better than most of his customers! ;).

&gt; Well, isn't that the way it should be? That's the story of my life since I
&gt; got
&gt; cats into my household:-)

&gt; Once again thank you for your advice - now I'll try chuck steak and prime
&gt; rib.
&gt; I hope they'll like that (I only eat it if fried or barbequed).

&gt; Lotta

"/> That's it! Stir fry a few cubes in a non-stick pan. The rarer the better.
You can also try duck - my girls go crazy over duck! Just let it cool down
to body temperature.

Gerry. Lets for a moment assume that none of you &quot;keep um in at all
costs&quot; brigade are not telling porkies on the ages of cats (and we do
know a few of you do tell some woppers on other things) but we will
assume this once that the figures given are correct. Then if we
compare all of the ages quoted by UK posters with your figures there
is no real difference in the life expectancy of cats between our
in/out cats with full lives and you poor indoor only cats with their
half lives.

Actually I've always said it does make a slight difference, maybe two
years over the average life of around 15 years.

Do you get it now?

Prolly not, but then your grasp of maths has been flawed in the past.

&gt;&gt; Yes of course my cats understand the dangers of traffic. They learnt
&gt;&gt; to cross the road when they were young, as all cats do in the UK.

&gt;LOL! Yeah, right, they're all traffic-smart, *and* now you're speaking for
&gt;all of the UK instead of just your own cats. A tad presumptuous of you,
&gt;n'est-ce pas? Tell you what - you get your cats to be turn-key instructors
&gt;for my cats, so that they completely understand that they are not to cross
&gt;the streets, &amp; then mine will be allowed out, when I'm at home.

"/> It is not a case of not crossing streets, cats do that all the time.
It is learning, which they do best when they are young (just like our
kids)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Ok
&gt;&gt; some don't learn well enough, I think I worked out some time back that
&gt;&gt; in this road we had lost around 1 in 200 cats to car accidents in the
&gt;&gt; 25+ years I've lived here. I think we are fairly typical.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Were do you draw the line? There is no such thing as a 100% safe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; environment - it cannot exist. So what you have to do is balance the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; risks against their quality of life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bingo. I *have* assessed the risk. And over a 20% risk is way too
&gt;high,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;IMO. Who wants to lose approx. 1 out of every 5 cats to car
&gt;accidents?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not me. My cats get their fresh air out on the screened porch.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is not acceptable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Not acceptable to whom? You? Too bad. Live w/ it. ;-)

&gt;&gt; No. To the cats. The deserve better.

&gt;Re-read below - they were either considered redundant by their owner, were
&gt;strays - in need of medical attention, or else were in the shelter. They
&gt;did deserve better; they got adopted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Care to find me an exception??

&gt;&gt;&gt; Josh you little troll you. We have, on many occasions in the past,

&gt;&gt;&gt; oldest you have in the USA. Our cats are of course indoors/outdoors.

&gt;&gt;Oh what bull crap.

&gt; What is? You dispute what we have found several times?

&gt;&gt; What does that have to do with how long indoor/outdoor
&gt;&gt;cats live on average to indoor only cats?

&gt; Well if I'm talking to someone with some sense I would expect them to

&gt; is no real difference in the life expectancy of cats between our
&gt; in/out cats with full lives and you poor indoor only cats with their
&gt; half lives.

&gt; Actually I've always said it does make a slight difference, maybe two

&gt; Do you get it now?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry dear but we have done the mine is older than yours before, many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times, and the truth is that indoor/outdoor cats in the UK live just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as long and indoor only in the USA.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any evidence to substantiate that ridiculous claim?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Didn't think so....

&gt;&gt;&gt; As Frank say, we ave done this before. Go and look at the archives to
&gt;&gt;&gt; see the evidence.

&gt;&gt; Oh for goodness sakes Bob, grow up, stop throwing stones and simply accept
&gt;&gt; that things aren't always the same in different parts of the world....

&gt; The cats are, and they have the same needs. Needs which cat owners
&gt; should respect regardless of where they live in the world.

&gt;&gt; By spouting off in the way you do, the only blasted thing you achieve (well,
&gt;&gt; in my books at any-rate) is a sense of exasperation and an inclination to
&gt;&gt; dismiss anything you rattle on about even if you may have a valid statement
&gt;&gt; to make about something.

&gt; Look Morag. When you have been through as many of these arguments as I
&gt; have over the last year then you will have the right to get
&gt; exasperated.

&gt;&gt; You appear to be incapable of seeing anyone else's point of view and regard
&gt;&gt;&quot;your&quot; way as being the &quot;true and just&quot; way ... which is, in my opinion, the
&gt;&gt; biggest load of twaddle out.

&gt; Ah! So you dispute that cats in the UK live long healthy lives while
&gt; still enjoying the outside world? Is that correct?

&gt;&gt; Morag (who never did like history when they discussed the crusadors.)

&gt; ???? Have I missed something?

"/> Morag's apparently too sharp for Bob. By the way, Morag, now he's trying to
claim superiority in both exasperation AND arguing :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes of course my cats understand the dangers of traffic. They learnt
&gt;&gt;&gt; to cross the road when they were young, as all cats do in the UK.

&gt;&gt; LOL! Yeah, right, they're all traffic-smart, *and* now you're speaking for
&gt;&gt; all of the UK instead of just your own cats. A tad presumptuous of you,
&gt;&gt; n'est-ce pas? Tell you what - you get your cats to be turn-key instructors
&gt;&gt; for my cats, so that they completely understand that they are not to cross
&gt;&gt; the streets, &amp; then mine will be allowed out, when I'm at home.

&gt; It is not a case of not crossing streets, cats do that all the time.
&gt; It is learning, which they do best when they are young (just like our
&gt; kids)

&gt;&gt; Ok
&gt;&gt;&gt; some don't learn well enough, I think I worked out some time back that
&gt;&gt;&gt; in this road we had lost around 1 in 200 cats to car accidents in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; 25+ years I've lived here. I think we are fairly typical.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Were do you draw the line? There is no such thing as a 100% safe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; environment - it cannot exist. So what you have to do is balance the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; risks against their quality of life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bingo. I *have* assessed the risk. And over a 20% risk is way too
&gt;&gt; high,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IMO. Who wants to lose approx. 1 out of every 5 cats to car
&gt;&gt; accidents?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not me. My cats get their fresh air out on the screened porch.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is not acceptable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not acceptable to whom? You? Too bad. Live w/ it. ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt; No. To the cats. The deserve better.

&gt;&gt; Re-read below - they were either considered redundant by their owner, were
&gt;&gt; strays - in need of medical attention, or else were in the shelter. They
&gt;&gt; did deserve better; they got adopted.

&gt; But not into an idea home for healthy cats. Better than some, but
&gt; still far from ideal.

"/> That's Bob's problem right there. He believes that there can be an ideal
world. But ideal would that in itself is impossible.

&gt;&gt; don't get run over /poisoned /eaten by wild animals. I/ve had three
cats
&gt;&gt; that lived to 16/17/19 years old. My friend a few miles away has two 16

&gt; Only thousands? I thought it would be more. Here in North America, there
&gt; are 100's of thousands indoor/outdoor cats at least. However, unlike the
&gt; fact that no UK outdoor/indoor cat has ever been runover/poisoned/lost
etc.
&gt; as you claim, many of among those 100's of thousands on this side of the
&gt; pond do. This probably explains why many in North America choose to keep
&gt; their cats indoors.

&gt; Anyway, I'm not sure what your post had to do with my joke about

&gt;&gt; fact that no UK outdoor/indoor cat has ever been runover/poisoned/lost
&gt; etc.
&gt;&gt; as you claim, many of among those 100's of thousands on this side of the
&gt;&gt; pond do. This probably explains why many in North America choose to
keep
&gt;&gt; their cats indoors.

&gt;&gt; Anyway, I'm not sure what your post had to do with my joke about
&gt;&gt;&quot;seeing-eye&quot; cats.

&gt; Err what did your reply to Bob have to do with his post?

&gt; Err... or do you really use cats instead of dogs to lead
&gt;&gt; the blind in your country? Perhaps that's why you didn't get it.

&gt; Gerry, sweetie, you're not amusing as you think you are. Try telling a
&gt; joke thats funny. But judging by your *joke* you don't seem to realise the
&gt; difference between a dog and a cat which is why you seem to have trouble
&gt; understanding them.

"/> Hmmm.... now your confusing me. I make a *joke* about seeing-eye cats in
response to Bob's utter nonsense he's been spewing about cats being able to
learn to navigate intersections, and know when the light turns green, etc.
and you call me not amusing? Ok. But a good reason to say I don't know a
dog from a cat? HINT: I'm not Bob ;-)

And frankly, I really don't give a shit whether you find my &quot;joke&quot; funny or
not. It's certainly not something that will keep me up at night. Believe
me sweetie.

&gt;Gerry

"/> Of those that replied :-)

There were Americans and Europeans. Nearly all the Americans kept
their cats in, nearly all the Europeans let their cats out.

The average lifespan of cats owned by the Americans was actually lower
than those owned by Europeans but when adjusted to remove cats,
referred to in the past tense, that the Americans let out.

This left a split between American Indoor-Only cats and European
In-Out pussycats.

The result was a very even match in ages.

HTH - but I doubt it :-(

&gt;Lets see....
&gt;My indoor cats get
&gt;1) Sun and Fresh air through screens and windows.
&gt;2) I used to grow cat grass for my cats, but they weren't interested
&gt;though they do like an old sock stuffed with fresh catnip from my
&gt;garden (the dirt I think they can live without, they have their litter
&gt;box).
&gt;3) With 3 cats in the house, they can socialize or not with each
&gt;other, without me worrying about them getting fleas or catching
&gt;disease.
&gt;4) Other animals? What other animals? Around here I don't want my
&gt;cats confronting raccoons or the skunk that lives in my garage! I
&gt;have a peach fronted conure who's cage is at a window, across from
&gt;that window is one of my bird feeders. quite often the cats lay on
&gt;top of the bird cage and talk to the wild birds at the feeder. As for
&gt;insects, my cats keep spiders and flies at bay quite well here in the
&gt;house.
&gt;5) They are free to do what ever they please in the house (except go
&gt;on my kitchen counters and table).

&gt;hmmmm so much for that...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The ONLY evidence I've found in teh archives is from those debating
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;AGAINST you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and Frank.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Care to find me an exception??

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Josh you little troll you. We have, on many occasions in the past,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; talked about the length of lives of our cats. The conclusions was
&gt;that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all of us in the UK have or know cats who are just as old as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oldest you have in the USA. Our cats are of course indoors/outdoors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh what bull crap.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What is? You dispute what we have found several times?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What does that have to do with how long indoor/outdoor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cats live on average to indoor only cats?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well if I'm talking to someone with some sense I would expect them to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have worked it out by themselves. But as if Mr NoNothing Gerry, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suppose I have to explain :(

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gerry. Lets for a moment assume that none of you &quot;keep um in at all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; costs&quot; brigade are not telling porkies on the ages of cats (and we do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know a few of you do tell some woppers on other things) but we will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assume this once that the figures given are correct. Then if we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compare all of the ages quoted by UK posters with your figures there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is no real difference in the life expectancy of cats between our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in/out cats with full lives and you poor indoor only cats with their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; half lives.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually I've always said it does make a slight difference, maybe two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years over the average life of around 15 years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you get it now?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prolly not, but then your grasp of maths has been flawed in the past.

&gt;&gt;&gt;LOL! And prey tell how was this a statistically valid sample? You would
&gt;&gt;&gt;have to be a nut to make conclusions about life spans from a thread on a
&gt;&gt;&gt;newsgroup!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Gerry

&gt;&gt; Of those that replied :-)

&gt;&gt; There were Americans and Europeans. Nearly all the Americans kept
&gt;&gt; their cats in, nearly all the Europeans let their cats out.

&gt;I would say your sample is not valid. And since your pushing this as a

brick wall.. totally
unrewarding. We recently joked on here that we could send all our homeless
cats to Bobnfrank.
It would be his responsibility to make sure they were all healthy, whole and
content. It would be
his responsibility to pay for all the vet bills, food and etc. that goes
with raising a cat. It would
be his responsibility to take care of EVERY SINGLE cat including every
single feral kitten born
to all those unaltered pets he would like to see wandering around.. and if
*1* became ill, or died
from his negligence, escaped his so called feral colony, etc.. a human was
going to come over
there and &quot;open a can of whup-ass&quot; on him.

I would think it would sound like a great idea.. but I wouldn't want a cat
subjected to that life.

&gt;-&gt; Must be pretty neat to see all those UK cat owners, all standing
&gt;-&gt; outdoors every evening on their step, at the same time all shaking a
&gt;-&gt; box of dry food to call their kitties home for dinner (If they are
&gt;-&gt; alive and able).
&gt;-
&gt;-And everyone knows everyone, and all the Mommies wear aprons and pearls,
&gt;-even while vacuuming.
&gt;-Daddies all carry brief cases and smoke pipes, and kids all say things like
&gt;-&quot;Golly Gee, Mom. Meatloaf
&gt;-for dinner sounds KEEN!&quot;
&gt;-

"/> ROFLMAO that was sort of the image I got when I posted about them
all on their door steps calling their cats home for dinner hahahaha

I have to use a hand can opener when I open people food so my cats
don't come running from where ever they are in the house... the
electric opener is used for their food. I recycle cans too, so the
sound of a label being peeled also gets them running to the kitchen
hahahaha

My cats actually start converging on me if I am a few minutes late in
feeding them their canned food in the evening.(they always have a bowl
of dry food to nibble on through the day). About a month before the
clocks go back or forward an hour here, my cats adjust their own inner
clocks about a month before the time actually changes. Funny my kids
used to do the same with their bed times too.

&gt; have a peach fronted conure who's cage is at a window, across from
&gt; that window is one of my bird feeders. quite often the cats lay on

&gt; 5) They are free to do what ever they please in the house (except go

there's no need to be sarcastic....... speaking as a Morag who has 9/10

is asleep on top of the stove, 1 is sprawled on top of the freezer, 1 is
lying on top of the dressing table, 1 is snoozing in the laundry basket, 1

But then our weather conditions here go to extremes, and at least the

aviary for one bird.
Besides my conure does get out of his cage periodically, in fact until
we moved to our last house (had very large windows and our bird used
to crash into them) his cage door was always left open. for his
safety, we only take him out to handle and socialize with him now.

&gt;OK, now I see the light....
&gt;in the UK, cats who roam freely outdoors live as long as our indoor

"/> No, even quite old cats still go out, I know one who is at least 23

However, some cats do become very frail with advancing years and these
do sometimes need their movement restricted. Usually that is not
something taken lightly, if fact it most often happens when a cat has
to be rehomed at an advanced age and of course it is more difficult
for an elderly cat to fit in to an area's social grouping.

It seems to me you all want the best for your pets. To me, that is the key
issue - you care. Second to this, you will have differences of opinion -
an inevitability ! Add to this the difference in local law............

I have had both inside and outside cats. At present, I have a 'herd' of
rescues. I have TRIED to let them go out - they don't like it. They live
half of the time in a big run I built for them in my back garden, and the
other half of the time in the house. The key point to stress is that they
are happy. I have a dog too, and she gets on with the cats a treat.

One observation I will make of cats is that they LOVE to sleep ! This is
regardless of in or outdoors. The cats I have known will quite happily
sleep 18 hours a day - most of the 6 waking hours a day spent when I'm
back from, or off to work - and of this, most of it was spent either
gorging (eating) or cuddling, or teasing my dog (in one case,
but he does give her a good morning nuzzle)......... At which point I find
myself asking why you are arguing over this ? Moggy draws a big line of
zzzzzzzzzzzz's most of the day.....until owner comes home/gets up,
etc..... moggy is well treated, loved, goes out, stays in - whatever.

If people keep rescue animals, and treat them well, this is better by far
than the alternative - destruction. Especially as animals are genuine (if
mischievous) and don't give you the bull that life throws at you.

So it is by no means as clearcut as some seem to think on here. In
fact, it is clear as mud. Does this clarify the real issues ?

Why not put this debate to bed for a good long line of zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz's
and discuss some real issues ? In fact, let me start the ball rolling -
techniques for getting moggy to take pill, and how to keep their teeth
from plaque buildup, and subsequent decay. I have big problems with
both. Any ideas ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't twist things Susan. All the cats I've seen in the UK who are

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cat in.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Aww, now the truth comes out. Bobbity is now saying that the cats he met
&gt;&gt;&gt; being kept in didn't cause any problems, but that they are now indoors
&gt;&gt;&gt; because of problems they developed outdoors! See the irony?! LOL
&gt;&gt;&gt; So Bobbity has in fact never actually met a regular indoor cats then. This
&gt;&gt;&gt; is too funny.

&gt;&gt;Yeah.. I have noticed how Unreasonabob can change his tune when it suits him
&gt;&gt;but none of us are allowed to have an opinion. I wonder why he hasn't met
&gt;&gt;any
&gt;&gt;happy just because they are indoor cats..

&gt; Because there are no happy just because they are indoor cats - they do
&gt; not exist.

&gt;&gt;Probably because his peers are
&gt;&gt;afraid to
&gt;&gt;let him over to hear his diatribe on indoor cats. Either that or he's afraid
&gt;&gt;that he will
&gt;&gt;actually meet a healthy, happy, content indoor cat and all his inflated
&gt;&gt;opinions will
&gt;&gt;tumble like a house of cards.

I know I have just replied to your post in Alt.cats, but forgot to
mention that I was not bickering, simply asking why I was being Tut
Tutted....
I have no idea what that was all about.

I don't appreciate being used as an example of bickering and cross
posting, as I said previously, (not being an overly experience NGer) I
didn't even notice that some of my replies were being cross posted
till later.
I agree after visiting some of the NG where cross posting has occured
with the debates on indoor/outdoor, that it is a pain to read new
posts duplicated on other NGs.
I don't know why people cross post anyway, unless they are desperate
for help on an issue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It seems to me you all want the best for your pets. To me, that is the key
&gt; issue - you care. Second to this, you will have differences of opinion -
&gt; an inevitability ! Add to this the difference in local law............

&gt; I have had both inside and outside cats. At present, I have a 'herd' of
&gt; rescues. I have TRIED to let them go out - they don't like it. They live
&gt; half of the time in a big run I built for them in my back garden, and the
&gt; other half of the time in the house. The key point to stress is that they
&gt; are happy. I have a dog too, and she gets on with the cats a treat.

&gt; One observation I will make of cats is that they LOVE to sleep ! This is
&gt; regardless of in or outdoors. The cats I have known will quite happily
&gt; sleep 18 hours a day - most of the 6 waking hours a day spent when I'm
&gt; back from, or off to work - and of this, most of it was spent either
&gt; gorging (eating) or cuddling, or teasing my dog (in one case,
&gt; but he does give her a good morning nuzzle)......... At which point I find
&gt; myself asking why you are arguing over this ? Moggy draws a big line of
&gt; zzzzzzzzzzzz's most of the day.....until owner comes home/gets up,
&gt; etc..... moggy is well treated, loved, goes out, stays in - whatever.

&gt; If people keep rescue animals, and treat them well, this is better by far
&gt; than the alternative - destruction. Especially as animals are genuine (if
&gt; mischievous) and don't give you the bull that life throws at you.

&gt; So it is by no means as clearcut as some seem to think on here. In
&gt; fact, it is clear as mud. Does this clarify the real issues ?

&gt; Why not put this debate to bed for a good long line of zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz's
&gt; and discuss some real issues ? In fact, let me start the ball rolling -

"/> The reason it goes on and on is because Bob/Frank/Adrian insist we who have
indoor cats are cruel. Over and over. They will insert that assertion to any
post where it is indicated one has an indoor cat. Otherwise it would drop.

Pilling is easy. Get a pill gun. I had to pill my cat for dental disease for
several months before we pulled them (which has happily put an end to the
problem and he is wayyyyy happy). I just wrapped him in a towel and popped
the pill down his throat with the pill gun. Available at the vet or on line.

often innocent victims who get preyed upon by animals and whether we really
like it or not, they wheedle their way into our life and decide to stay
..... and by the time we've decided that said animal has to go, they've
wheedled their way into our hearts too.

Hence the reason I have a cat called &quot;Kit&quot; and two dogs called &quot;Dog&quot; and
&quot;Dog Dog&quot; ....... and my Cayce cat who lives downstairs and refuses to be
rehomed ...... and none of whom were meant to stay, because we thought we
had enough animals.

don't and it's safest to cross not at a junction, but down the street.

Anyway, on the day they had three cats in for treatment as a result of
road accidents. Two owned and one feral.

Nobody can get away from the fact that car accidents are the largest
single cause of cat death in the UK other than age. However, for most
areas it would be a over reaction to deprive a cat of going outdoors
because the risk level is still low (and falling).

"/> But does the death of your animal mean that everyone else should keep
theirs in? Does even the death of one of your animals give you the
right to imprison other animals? I would say no to both.

If you live in an area where you don't think it is reasonable safe to
let cats out (and it is only you that can judge that) then the simple
answer is not to have cats. If you do insist on your 'rights' to keep
cats then at least keep those that for some genuine reason cannot be
allowed out.

"/> Yes, I thought that was what you meant. Not a problem in the UK, nor
any of the countries I've been in Europe.

Here we would teach our children to move away from corners to cross
the road, and away from parked cars. We teach them to find a place
where they can see - an be seen.

Even if there is a crossing there are no laws which demand that you
only cross at that place. In essence I suppose it is still true that
the pedestrian has more rights on the road than the car driver.

As for cats. Well they usually stand back from the road (giving them
the best view) and wait for the gaps. But yes, reports of cats waiting
at light controlled crossings for the lights to be in their favour do
appear quite often - the cat learns.

Any person who would let their cats out must be nuts - they get parasites,
get attacked by other cats, get run over, etc. Their lives are vastly
shortned.

I know. I have a neighbor who lost 2 cats, due to cars.

&gt;&gt;Excuse me?? My cats have full run of an 1125 sq ft apartment. They
aren't
&gt;&gt;locked out of any room in this place! They also have access, if they
ever
&gt;&gt;would take it, to a 10 foot by 3 foot patio. So I'ld say that's HARDLY a
4
&gt;&gt;foot cage!! The Humane Society &amp; ASPCA both agree that this is more than
&gt;&gt;enough space for 3 cats to coexist happily. So until you come here to
&gt;&gt;inspect my cats &amp; their living enviroment, I'ld appreciate it if you
didn't
&gt;&gt;make assumptions.

&gt; No, it is a bigger cage - but still a cage. You cats can't get out of
&gt; it, other cats can't get into it - it is a cage.

Genseng,
Sounds to me like most of you people have convinced yourselves that whatever
you do to your cat, is in their best interest - but have you ever asked your
cats what they want? I know a girl who every time I go over there, opens
the door about a eigth of an inch and tries to yank me in through the
crack - because here come her three precious darlings heel-bent on escape.
She too thinks she is not just a jailer with animal inmates. Well, if your
so sure - try this little test: get your cats attention and go over and
open your front door and leave it open for five minutes - if your cat is
miles away at the end of that time, maybe you really are just another
jailer! &quot;newsgroup&quot;&lt;blan ... @jps.net&gt;

Following is an excerpt from an HSUS newsletter I received in April. The
update follows:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; VIOLENCE AND ANIMAL CRUELTY IN U.S. PRISONS:
&gt; In an act of cruelty reminiscent of the The Green Mile, a prison guard in
&gt; New York state deliberately crushed to death a box of kittens found in an
&gt; inmate's cell. According to reports, Sergeant Ronald Hunlock ordered the
&gt; inmate to drop the kittens in a trash compactor. When the man refused,
&gt; Hunlock picked up the kittens himself, dumped them into the trash
&gt; compactor, and turned it on, crushing the kittens to death. The kittens'
&gt; mother, a cat named Midnight, escaped by running across the prison yard,
&gt; and is now being cared for at a local animal shelter. Hunlock pled not
&gt; guilty, and at an April 3rd arraignment, a judge denied his lawyer's
&gt; request for bail reduction. Hunlock will appear in court again for a
&gt; preliminary hearing on April 10th.
&gt; WHAT YOU CAN DO:
&gt; You can help the prosecution by sending letters of support, asking for a
&gt; stern sentence for Mr. Hunlock. In your letters, you may wish to
&gt; reference the strong connection between animal cruelty and violence
&gt; against humans. Send your letters to: Prosecuting Attorney Lynn
&gt; Rosenthal,111 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., White Plains, NY 10601 /
&gt; Fax: (914) 995-3368 / westcodista ... @netscape.net please note that the DA
&gt; requests only letters--- no phone calls). Although the case will be
&gt; reassigned to a State Supreme Court judge (stay tuned for updates), you
&gt; can still send your letters of thanks to the lower court judge who denied
&gt; Mr. Hunlock's request for bail reduction to: The Honorable Raymond
&gt; Barlamm, Village Justice, Ossining Town Court, 86 Spring St., Ossining, NY
&gt; 10562 / ph: 914-941-3067 / fax: 914-941-3404

"/> Hunlock had an arraignment a couple of months ago and will be going to trial
in August. I'll keep everyone posted when I get an update.
