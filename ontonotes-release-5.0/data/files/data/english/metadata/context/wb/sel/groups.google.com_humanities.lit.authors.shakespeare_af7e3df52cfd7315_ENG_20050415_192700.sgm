Hi everyone,

Roger and I just presented our powerpoint in Portland.

This is what I'm prepared to say for now:

The authors of travel narratives of the time often plagiarised the work
of others.

Strachey is a well-known plagiarist. Portions of his other major work,
History of Travel, were copied verbatim from other writers.

Purchas, Strachey's editor, also &quot;borrowed&quot; the work of others.

Portions of True Repertory, including details of the storm, were copied
from elsewhere and do not accord with the other Bermuda narratives of
1609.

It is impossible that the Strachey letter was transmitted in its
present form in July 1610 on Gates' boat. Either it existed in a
different form or did not exist at all. We give decisive evidence for
this.

Shakespeare did not need Strachey. We have shown conclusively that his
two main sources were Eden 1555 and Erasmus' de Naufragium, 1523.
Almost every Tempest parallel that David sees to Strachey has a closer
parallel to one of these two sources.

Although it appears that Strachey also used these sources, Shakespeare
could not have copied from Strachey because he used many details from
Eden and Erasmus not in True Repertory.

In Ashland in September we will show that The Tempest was likely
performed far earlier than 1611.

Regards to all. May not be able to dialogue on this for the time being
as computer access is erratic where I am.

Do any two Bermuda narratives accord with each other in every detail?

This is the only thing here that makes no sense whatever. It does not
follow that if Shakespeare used material from more than one source,
like any gifted writer would, he could not have copied some other
writer. (No one argues that Shakespeare copied Strachey, anyway, as
far as I know--only that he based a good deal of his play on him.)

Yes. Anyone who doubts this should wait for our essay, which we will be
writing over the summer. We already explained in Portland why we are
able to state the above with such confidence.

Bunny, you're talking nonsense. But that's allowed, especially when

Hmmmm.....perhaps they're going to argue that Strachey copied
from a source that was written later than 1610?

In any event, this sounds interesting. Looking forward to

Hi Elizabeth,

Thanks for worrying. I was on my way to catch a train to Montreal to
give workshops and readings. Then I took a plane down to Baltimore so
Roger and I could decide who would say what, then a plane to Portland.
I avoided the derailment but caught a nasty cold and cough instead.

Still in Baltimore but will be in Washington on the weekend. If any
Oxfordian (or other friendly person) would like to join some of us for
Oxie Dim Sum Sat lunch-time in DC, please email me privately.

Love,

I couldn't have expected you to understand, Paul, that using
Stratfordian thinking to promote the opposite point of view was the
most effective way to make our point: that Shakespeare had no need of
Strachey to write The Tempest, and that the Strachey letter in its
entirety could not have been written or transmitted in time for
Shakespeare to use it as a source if the play was performed in the fall
of 1611. But that's only the beginning. We have also demonstrated that
both Strachey and Purchas were plagiarists of major proportions. One or
the other of them copied wholesale from sources that were easily
available to Shakespeare--from 1555. To my mind all this plagiarism
goes to the heart of the authorship question. There was in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a culture of copying or stealing
the works of others, even with regard to supposedly truthful travel
narratives. This was evident in many of the sources we looked at.

What has Paul done, LynnE? Why he's proved that although Shakespeare
didn't &quot;need&quot; your crummy sort of sources to write his works, he DID
need the real-life sources of Queen Elizabeth's court and outhouse,
neither of which were available to the Stratford illiterate.

By the way, I don't think I've ever composed anything that wasn't
significantly influenced by a hundred or more writers and other
artists, how about you? Nor have I become reasonably knowledgeable
about the works of any writer of importance who composed anything not
influenced significantly by a great number of writers. In fact, I
think that the better an artist is, the more other artists there are,
at all levels of ability, who have significantly influenced him.

Bob, I believe it's impossible for an author not to be influenced by
other writers, although it was apparently more acceptable in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to appropriate the work of others.
But none of us could ever write anything if we hadn't previously
patterned on or been influenced by earlier writers. Even Paul Crowley
must have been influenced by someone somewhere down the line. It
boggles the mind...

I'm sure that you are right in all this.
Although you have not made clear
a couple of salient points:
(a) no one would have put on a play
about mystical island in 1611 when
London was full of dramatic accounts
of a real one. If anyone had been
preparing to put on such a play, they'd
have had to pull it, in much the same
way as some disaster movies had to
be pulled after 9/11.
(b) there was nothing around in 1611
from which anyone would copy anything.
Purchas (? -- I've forgotten the names)
copied from the Folio in 1625, making
up that story about a letter to a mystery
lady, pretending to back-date everything.

I agree with you, Peter, though there are limits. We can produce
competent writers by encouraging reading, reading, reading, patterning,
writing--but not great or even necessarily good ones. There has to be
that extra ingredient, not sure what it is.

&gt;&gt; It's true of every writer worth reading. That's why I despair of
&gt;&quot;creative

&gt;&gt; reading and reading (not to mention writing).

&gt; I agree with you, Peter, though there are limits. We can produce
&gt; competent writers by encouraging reading, reading, reading, patterning,
&gt; writing--but not great or even necessarily good ones. There has to be
&gt; that extra ingredient, not sure what it is.

Certainly: by &quot;craft of writing&quot; I meant something rather modest. If that
extra ingredient is genius, or even just talent, no-one is going to get it
from a creative writing workshop if they didn't bring it with them. There's
a lovely essay by William Golding in &lt;The Hot Gates&gt; in which he imagines
Blake in a creative writing class.

New information about the date of The Tempest would be welcome to all
students of Shakespeare, regardless of what odd ideas the discoverers
might hold on other subjects. In the hope of being helpful to your
enterprise, may I offer a few comments?

1. That Strachey copied extensively from other writers isn't news. His
entry in the DNB says as much. The author of The Tempest could have
made use of his narrative even if it lacked originality.

2. Whether Samuel Purchas was a plagiarist strikes me as having no
bearing on the question of whether the author of The Tempest read
Strachey. He certainly didn't read Purchas His Pilgrims, published in
1626. (As an aside, I note that Purchas was not himself a travel
writer; he never, by his own account went farther than 200 miles from
his birthplace. His own writing consisted of editorial notes, mostly
theological, one sermon and an anti-Papist tract. Why do you care
whether any of those borrowed material from other writers?)

3. If portions of the True Repertory were indeed &quot;copied from
elsewhere&quot; and are inconsistent with other accounts of the same events,
that fact, again, doesn't mean that the author of The Tempest didn't
use it.

4. Are the parts of Strachey's letter that, in your view, could not
have been transmitted in 1610 among those regarded as sources for The
Tempest? If not, you have merely demonstrated that changes were made to
the letter before it appeared in Purchas.

5. Both Eden's &quot;Decades&quot; and Erasmus' &quot;Naufragium&quot; (or &quot;de Naufragio&quot;,
*not* &quot;de Naufragium&quot;; you should know better than to trust Dr.
Stritmatter's Latin) are commonly listed as possible sources for the
play (e. g., in Bullough). The theory that the author relied
principally on Strachy was formulated by readers who were aware of the
alternatives. Do you address their reasons for that conclusion? Does
your proposed source explain at least as well such phenomena as the
occurrence of words in Strachey and The Tempest that don't appear
elsewhere in the canon (such as &quot;glut&quot;, &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;thunder-stroke&quot;)?
(BTW, the motive for the conventional theory can't have been to
discredit Oxenfordianism, for it antedates Looney.)

6. Do the parallels that you find between The Tempest and &quot;Naufragium&quot;
come from Erasmus' Latin or from an English translation? If the latter,
which translation? The one reproduced in Bullough was printed in 1606,
making it as inaccessible to Oxenford as the Strachey letter.

&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; Roger and I just presented our powerpoint in Portland.

&gt; This is what I'm prepared to say for now:

&gt; The authors of travel narratives of the time often plagiarised the
work
&gt; of others.

&gt; Strachey is a well-known plagiarist. Portions of his other major
work,
&gt; History of Travel, were copied verbatim from other writers.

&gt; Purchas, Strachey's editor, also &quot;borrowed&quot; the work of others.

&gt; Portions of True Repertory, including details of the storm, were
copied
&gt; from elsewhere and do not accord with the other Bermuda narratives of
&gt; 1609.

&gt; It is impossible that the Strachey letter was transmitted in its
&gt; present form in July 1610 on Gates' boat. Either it existed in a
&gt; different form or did not exist at all. We give decisive evidence for
&gt; this.

&gt; Shakespeare did not need Strachey. We have shown conclusively that
his
&gt; two main sources were Eden 1555 and Erasmus' de Naufragium, 1523.
&gt; Almost every Tempest parallel that David sees to Strachey has a
closer
&gt; parallel to one of these two sources.

&gt; Although it appears that Strachey also used these sources,
Shakespeare
&gt; could not have copied from Strachey because he used many details from
&gt; Eden and Erasmus not in True Repertory.

&gt; In Ashland in September we will show that The Tempest was likely
&gt; performed far earlier than 1611.

&gt; Regards to all. May not be able to dialogue on this for the time
being
&gt; as computer access is erratic where I am.

Thank you very much, Tom. What you write is helpful to me in collecting
my thoughts, which are, as usual, all over the place. And I agree, our
findings should be welcome to all students of Shakespeare. We didn't

Right. As a plagiarist who made use of other fictional material and

If Richard Hakluyt (from whose heirs Samuel Purchas bought this and
other manuscripts) was able to get a copy of the letter, it isn't very
hard to believe that William Shakespeare saw it, too. There are plenty
of instances of 17th Century writings circulating in manuscript. The
precise path of transmission is unknowable on the basis of the facts in

Note, too, that, if the letter really was &quot;a private letter to a lady&quot;,
there's no reason why she couldn't have shown it to others. The
Virginia Company had an interest in suppressing the document, since it
was critical of the state of affairs in Jamestown. A recipient without
that motive for reticence would very likely share this interesting
correspondence with her friends, from which it could spread more

What's your evidence for doubting it? William Strachey was an

the letter, July 15, 1610. He had no motive that I can imagine to

I *hope* that we are not about to be presented with another

reasons, fabricates the letter just after seeing a performance of The

It occurs to me that there is a straightforward explanation of how
William Shakespeare obtained the Strachey letter: Strachey gave it to
him.

As Lynne observes, the letter doesn't look like an official report. It
is addressed to an unnamed lady and contains much material that would
not have interested the Virginia shareholders in their business
capacity. It is also superfluous, since a contemporaneous despatch to
the Company covering the same events, probably written in large part by
Strachey, is extant in manuscript. (It formed the basis of &quot;True
Declaration of the Estate of the Colonie in Virginia&quot;, which the
Company published to counter adverse publicity about the Jamestown
colony.) A reasonable hypothesis is that Strachey's letter was a
literary production intended for publication.

In its entry for Strachey, the Dictionary of American National
Biography says, &quot;In London he traveled in literary company and was at
least acquainted with Ben Jonson, Thomas Campion, and John Marston. He
published a sonnet commending Jonson's Sejanus, and Campion thought
enough of Strachey to dedicate an epigram in his name, Ad Gulielmum
Stracheum. He invested money in the Blackfriar's Theater, which he
frequently attended.&quot;

So we have an aspiring writer with a manuscript and a leading figure in
the literary world whom he almost certainly knew at least slightly.
What could be more natural than for the former to give a copy of his
work to the latter, in the hope that he would commend it for
publication? That the recipient would then read it, and transform some
of the contents in his own way, is not too daring a speculation.

Strachey didn't return to England until the end of 1611. My notion was
that he sent one or more copies of the letter to acquaintances, who
then circulated it in the hope of attracting a publisher. Shakespeare
is a plausible first or second hand recipient.

Thank you, Tom. It *is* dated July 15, 1610, but not by Strachey. In
fact, the author put no date on it. The date was added by Purchas, I
believe from a date inside the narrative that pertains to something
entirely different. Purchas also wrote, at the beginning of Chapter 1,
that there were &quot;manifold deaths&quot; during the storm that would be &quot;here
to the life described,&quot; while in fact there were no deaths described in
the narrative of the storm at all. As you can see, he was a very
careful editor.

Since the manuscript of Strachey's letter no longer exists, there is no
way to know when or whether he dated it. Which is more likely: that
Strachey put a date on the letter and Purchas copied it or that the
letter was undated and Purchas unnecessarily added a date?

The misstatement in the chapter heading shows that the editor was
careless but has no conceivable bearing on when the letter was written.

&gt;&gt; time. I don't have a MS date-stamped &quot;15/7/10&quot; but presume that you
&gt;&gt; will accept circumstantial evidence where direct isn't available.

&gt; Thank you, Tom. It *is* dated July 15, 1610, but not by Strachey. In
&gt; fact, the author put no date on it. The date was added by Purchas, I
&gt; believe from a date inside the narrative that pertains to something
&gt; entirely different. Purchas also wrote, at the beginning of Chapter
1,
&gt; that there were &quot;manifold deaths&quot; during the storm that would be
&quot;here
&gt; to the life described,&quot; while in fact there were no deaths described
in
&gt; the narrative of the storm at all. As you can see, he was a very
&gt; careful editor.

You know, Tom, I've been thinking about this much of the night, when I
should have been sleeping. ;) In his essay, Dave frequently says: &quot;This
word (or phrase) only appears x times in Shakespeare.&quot; Once or twice he
says the word or phrase doesn't appear at all. This has put Oxfordians
on the defensive, scurrying to look for prior use by Shakespeare of
those terms. And of course in most cases they have found them. But the
real question is (or is also)--how many times did Strachey use those
words prior to his using them in True Repertory? In most or all cases
we have NO RECORD AT ALL of his ever using them elsewhere prior to the
supposed date of his letter. We couldn't have because his output was so
meager. Shakespeare writes many similar details of the storm, for
example, over and over again in different plays, so he has a kind of
internal consistency. Where is Strachey's consistency? Show me, where
does he earlier use &quot;glut&quot;? &quot;bosk&quot;? &quot;thunder stroke&quot;? Even &quot;manacles&quot;
or &quot;hoodwink&quot;? If I can't find one word in Dave's list that Shakespeare
used prior to Tempest, does that mean that Shakespeare copied Strachey,
even though you guys would be hard pressed to find ANY words on Dave's
list previously written by Strachey ?

I'm not sure why no one ever picked up on this before.

We do apparently have Strachey being influenced by Shakespeare
elsewhere, by the way, in the poem you mentioned yesterday that is in
response to Sejanus. I have a quote somewhere by a traditionalist--and
can dig it up if you wish, probably when I get home--that says it was
likely influenced by the storm in King Lear.

You are confusing two separate questions. The coincidences between the
Strachey letter and The Tempest are evidence that one was influenced by
the other. They don't tell us, in and of themselves, which came first.

A priori it's possible that Strachey was influenced by The Tempest
rather than the other way around, but is it probable? One must
hypothesize that Strachey's letter was misdated for no discernible
reason and that the letter writer picked up a fairly large number of
words and phrases from seeing the play performed. He can't have read
it, since he died in 1621 and The Tempest didn't appear in print until
the First Folio was published.

It is easier to imagine that the author of The Tempest drew on a
written source than that the author of the letter drew on an unwritten
one, particularly as more than a couple of parallels occur.

Or that the play was actually written earlier. A performance doesn't

Um, excuse me, you're mixing up &quot;written&quot; with &quot;published.&quot; Are you

If &quot;busky&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; were the same word to the author, that would be

It would suggest that he changed the form of a word known to be in his

that he had read Strachey. There could, of course, be other

The OED's first definition of 'busky' is &quot;Bosky, bushy'.
The OED's first definition of 'bosky' is &quot;Consisting of or
covered with bushes or underwood; full of thickets, bushy.&quot;
No axe to grind here, of course, Terry, but does it really?

As a present to all opponents, however, I will point out
that the verb 'to glut' was a favourite of Tamburlaine's,
so how come Shakespeare never used it (again?) until 'The
Tempest'?

Don't be silly, Tom. You're telling me that because Shakespeare spelled
one word differently in two places he likely read Strachey, who has a
different formation of the same word in an entirely different context?
Have you never heard of compositors? They tended to spell things
idiosyncratically, and I read in Peter Blayney's book that one could
even be distinguished from another by spelling in the ff. And different
quartos of Shakespeare plays have different spellings for what were
presumably the same or similar words. In my OED, by the way, the entry
for &quot;busky&quot; says it's a variation of &quot;bosky.&quot; Does Terry not have the
same OED? In any case, &quot;bosky&quot; hardly even merits a footnote in the
scheme of things.

It is beginning to appear to me that you are making some kind of what
Terry might call &quot;a special case&quot; for Strachey. It is acceptable to you
to explain much away by saying the date might/must have been
somewhere--and it was, but where it is militates against Strachey's
having sent the letter in July 1610--he must have given his unpublished
letter to Shakespeare, etc., but at the same time you've decided that
Strachey couldn't possibly have read Shakespeare's unpublished
play--although there must have been many more copies of the play or
parts of the play than copies of the letter, plus performances. You've
concocted a beautiful imaginary tale for what happened to the Strachey
letter so that Shakespeare could have read it, and feel that what you
have done is reasonable speculation, but say that anti-Stratfordians
who suggest that Purchas invented the letter are on shaky ground and
are in fact indulging in conspiracy theory. I suggest you're both
standing on shaky ground and moreover barking up the wrong tree.

This discussion will be more fruitful, I agree, once you reveal your
case. Let me note, though, that I haven't &quot;explained away&quot; anything,
because you have yet to call attention to any anomalies that need
explanation. That Strachey, an aspiring litterateur, should have
written an account of a dramatic series of events in which he was
personally involved is not odd. That he should have sent copies to
acquaintances is not odd. That William Shakespeare, a prominent
theatrical figure, should have been among the first or second hand
recipients of a letter written by someone known to have a passionate
interest in the theater is not odd. That Shakespeare should have read
the letter is not odd. That it should have influenced a play that he
wrote not long afterward is not odd.

That none of these links is odd does not prove that the whole chain of
reasoning is correct, but it is certainly reasonable. You claim to have
evidence that the letter could not have been written before the play.
If so, I'll be happy to take it into account but can't do so without
knowing what it is.

Yes, you are quite right, Tom. I don't believe the letter was written
or at least sent before the play could have been written. But our main
evidence will be to show that the parallels that Dave, Gayley and
others point out to Strachey were actually from a source other than
Strachey. I think we can prove this, in fact I'm sure we can, but time
will tell if you guys have a decent come-back argument.

Coulda, shoulda, woulda. Must have, might have, could have. Perhaps, it

row. Trying again to makes a probability out of thin air.

In law there's this thing called chain of evidence. You ain't got one.
If you're going to refute Lynne. You'll have to do better.

Once again we run into the typical pile of Strat manure. You're making
Greenblatt look grounded.

&gt; written an account of a dramatic series of events in which he was
&gt; personally involved is not odd. That he should have sent copies to
&gt; acquaintances is not odd. That William Shakespeare, a prominent
&gt; theatrical figure, should have been among the first or second hand
&gt; recipients of a letter written by someone known to have a passionate
&gt; interest in the theater is not odd. That Shakespeare should have read
&gt; the letter is not odd. That it should have influenced a play that he
&gt; wrote not long afterward is not odd.

&gt; That none of these links is odd does not prove that the whole chain
of
&gt; reasoning is correct, but it is certainly reasonable. You claim to
have
&gt; evidence that the letter could not have been written before the play.
&gt; If so, I'll be happy to take it into account but can't do so without
&gt; knowing what it is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They appear to mean the same thing in Shakespeare, and we know

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't regularised. I would say that bosky and busky are at
least
&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; close as bosky and bosk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynne

&gt;&gt;&gt; If &quot;busky&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; were the same word to the author, that
would
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt; an argument, albeit far from the weightiest one, against your

&gt;&gt;&gt; It would suggest that he changed the form of a word known to be

&gt;&gt;&gt; that he had read Strachey. There could, of course, be other
&gt;&gt;&gt; explanations for the change, but it is certainly consistent with
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; conventional theory.

&gt;&gt; Don't be silly, Tom. You're telling me that because Shakespeare
&gt; spelled
&gt;&gt; one word differently in two places he likely read Strachey, who has
a
&gt;&gt; different formation of the same word in an entirely different
&gt; context?
&gt;&gt; Have you never heard of compositors? They tended to spell things
&gt;&gt; idiosyncratically, and I read in Peter Blayney's book that one
could
&gt;&gt; even be distinguished from another by spelling in the ff. And
&gt; different
&gt;&gt; quartos of Shakespeare plays have different spellings for what were
&gt;&gt; presumably the same or similar words. In my OED, by the way, the
&gt; entry
&gt;&gt; for &quot;busky&quot; says it's a variation of &quot;bosky.&quot; Does Terry not have
the
&gt;&gt; same OED? In any case, &quot;bosky&quot; hardly even merits a footnote in the
&gt;&gt; scheme of things.

&gt;&gt; It is beginning to appear to me that you are making some kind of
what
&gt;&gt; Terry might call &quot;a special case&quot; for Strachey. It is acceptable to
&gt; you
&gt;&gt; to explain much away by saying the date might/must have been
&gt;&gt; somewhere--and it was, but where it is militates against Strachey's
&gt;&gt; having sent the letter in July 1610--he must have given his
&gt; unpublished
&gt;&gt; letter to Shakespeare, etc., but at the same time you've decided
that
&gt;&gt; Strachey couldn't possibly have read Shakespeare's unpublished
&gt;&gt; play--although there must have been many more copies of the play or
&gt;&gt; parts of the play than copies of the letter, plus performances.
&gt; You've
&gt;&gt; concocted a beautiful imaginary tale for what happened to the
&gt; Strachey
&gt;&gt; letter so that Shakespeare could have read it, and feel that what
you
&gt;&gt; have done is reasonable speculation, but say that
anti-Stratfordians
&gt;&gt; who suggest that Purchas invented the letter are on shaky ground
and
&gt;&gt; are in fact indulging in conspiracy theory. I suggest you're both
&gt;&gt; standing on shaky ground and moreover barking up the wrong tree.

&gt; No axe to grind here, of course, Terry, but does it really?

Peter, the OED does not give separate entries to the various spellings of
the word &quot;year&quot; and treat them as different words.

I think Lynne's claim is (or used to be) that &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; were the
same word -- not similar words, not related words, not neighbors or
friends, not even twins, but one and the same word. The OED does not
agree. If the OED considered them merely different spellings of the same
word, then the words would not have separate entries.

The words &quot;bushy&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; may have meant pretty much the
same thing, and may well be related, but the OED gives them separate
entries (as there are separate entries for &quot;bosk,&quot;&quot;bush,&quot; and &quot;busk&quot;).
Shakespeare never uses &quot;bushy,&quot; but we do have single instances of &quot;busky&quot;
and &quot;bosky.&quot; Spenser, on the other hand uses &quot;bushy&quot; but not &quot;bosky&quot; or
&quot;busky.&quot;

Poets are not always careless in the their word choices. When Milton uses
&quot;bosky&quot; rather than &quot;bushy&quot; in *Comus* the word seems to be a deliberate
rusticism by Comus, who is pretending to be a shepherd:

I know each lane, and every alley green
Dingle or bushy dell of this wilde Wood,
And every bosky bourn from side to side
My daily walks and ancient neighbourhood,

In *the Tempest*, &quot;bosky&quot; is used by Ceres, who is given a pastoral
introduction by Iris. Ceres replies,

Haile, many-coloured Messenger, that nere
Do'st disobey the wife of Iupiter:
Who, with thy saffron wings, vpon my flowres
Diffusest hony drops, refreshing showres,
And with each end of thy blew bowe do'st crowne
My boskie acres, and my vnshrubd downe,
Rich scarph to my proud earth: why hath thy Queene
Summond me hither, to this short gras'd Greene?

&quot;Busky&quot; is used by Henry 4 in *1H4*, in a somewhat less pastoral mood:

How bloodily the Sunne begins to peere
Aboue yon busky hill: the day lookes pale
At his distemperature.

The OED missed Strachey's use of &quot;bosk&quot; in *The True Repertory*, or we
would not read that the word is &quot;not recorded between 14th and 19th c.,&quot;
and there may well be other post-14th-Century instances the OED missed.

The OED says that &quot;bosk and busk are still used dialectally for BUSH; but
the modern literary word [i.e., 'bosk' meaning 'thicket'] may have been
evolved from BOSKY.&quot; That's an interesting thought: &quot;Bosk&quot; disappeared
from the standard language, but Ceres's &quot;bosky acres&quot; and Comus's &quot;bosky
bourn&quot; may have given birth to a new back-formation.

Were &quot;busky&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; identical for Shakespeare? Lynne is sure that
they were; I am not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As a present to all opponents, however, I will point out that the verb
&gt; 'to glut' was a favourite of Tamburlaine's, so how come Shakespeare
&gt; never used it (again?) until 'The Tempest'?

"/>

Oh, I don't know -- how come Shakespeare used &quot;unhousled&quot; only once,
&quot;disappointed&quot; only once, and &quot;unannealed&quot; only once -- and used them all
in a single line?

only grudgingly - while resting his own arguments on remote

&gt;From Roger:

Terry, I'm not sure what your point is here. If you are arguing that
OED does not give separate entries for words of identical etymology and
related or identical denotation, then your argument is manifestly
erroneous and, as I will show in a moment, specifically in error with
respect to the word in question.

Terry, you're a master at interpreting evidence so that gullible
readers who don't themselves have access to the evidence to formulate
their own conclusions will unthinkingly agree with you. In order to
show how dubious your interpretation is, let's take another look at
what the OED actually says, in the OED's own words, about the matter in
dispute. Here is the first of the two entries in question:

Bosky (written in bold) [(f. bosk not recorded between 14th and 19th
c., but preserved in dial.) + y: or alteration of BUSKY, after It.
boscoso] Consisting of or covered with bushes or underwood; full of
thickets, bushy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The words &quot;bushy&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; may have meant pretty much
the
&gt; same thing, and may well be related, but the OED gives them separate
&gt; entries

"/>

Yes, Terry, the entries are separate. But please read the entry cited
above. Even without looking at the second entry, you should be able to
determine that the OED does not consider the two words to be different
lexical items. In fact, the entry explicitly cites the spelling
&quot;busky&quot; as a variant of &quot;bosky.&quot; Therefore I am at a loss to explain
how you feel there is any wriggle room to save Dave from his error. The
two words manifestly do mean the same thing, at least according to your
own authority, the OED. The OED gives them as separate entries not
because the words are different, but because readers attempting to
ascertain the meaning of either variant will look under the available
spelling and need to be able to find the definition at that location.

Here is the second entry, which we find if we are looking for the folio
spelling from The Tempest:

Busky a. (f. busk, var. of bush, sb. 1+y cf. bushy, bosky.]
Bosky, busy.

This entry confirms what was apparent in the first entry: &quot;busky&quot; is a
variant of &quot;bosky,&quot; not a separate lexical item.

But there is another point which needs to be made. Close readers will
note the the OED entry for &quot;busky,&quot; unlike that for &quot;bosky,&quot; is not in
bold face. This signifies that the entry is what the OED calls a
subordinate entry. Subordinate entries are made for

&quot;Obsolete and variant forms of words, when these are so far removed in
spelling as not to come closely before or after the regular form as to
readily suggest it. These words are concisely referred to the Main
form to which they belong, with an explanatory synonym, when the latter
is itself obsolete&quot; (Compact Ed, 1971, xxii).

In other words, Terry, you have misread the OED. The two entries do
not signify any lexicographical doubt regarding the essential identity
of the word. They merely represent, as previously suggested, a
practical solution to the needs of users of the OED. &quot;Bosky&quot; is the
Main Entry; &quot;Busky&quot; is a subordinate entry for the variant form of the
word.

(as there are separate entries for &quot;bosk,&quot;&quot;bush,&quot; and &quot;busk&quot;).

Of course there are separate entries for these words. The aim of the
OED is to provide definitions for all the lexemes of the English
language. But that fact has no bearing on the fact that &quot;Bosky&quot; and
&quot;Busky,&quot; according to the OED, are the same lexeme.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Thanks for the information, Terry, but I have to ask what the relevance
of this information might possibly be. I'm sure we could go through an
entire inventory of the uses of these words in Elizabethan English and
in the process become thoroughly enlightened about the range of
dialectical variation. It would be illuminating to see in what
contexts the writers use these words, as that might serve to confirm
or, alternatively, call into doubt, the OED's contention that they are
the same word. But you haven't done this, so the information seems
more intended to distract than to inform.

I don't think you need to lecture Lynne or Peter about poets and their
word choices. Perhaps you are correct that the Milton intended &quot;bosky&quot;
to be an archaic version of &quot;bushy.&quot; But that doesn't change the fact
that the OED says that the words are, etymologically and denotatively,
identical. Is &quot;bosky&quot; more archaic than &quot;busky&quot;? Who knows? Is it an
intentional variant manifest in Shakespeare's original manuscript? Who
knows? The question is beside the point because you have chosen to
equivocate over what the OED says.

I
I'm glad you acknowledge the point first raised by Lynne, that
Shakespeare uses the word in Henry IV I as well as the Tempest. The
mood is irrelevant. The context of usage in both passages in
Shakespeare confirms the OED's view that the two spellings are variants
of the same word with the same essential meaning, covered by the modern
English &quot;bushy&quot; or perhaps the phrase &quot;shadowed with bushes.&quot;

Thanks for pointing this out, Terry. It confirms that you are reading

I think *one* documented piece of evidence from any moment in the man's
life that would support ANY contention such as the ones you are making
now would suffice. But they don't exist, do they? Oh, I forgot, you're
a leading proponent of the Price as total archetype of the mishaped
unscholarly.

Its apparently OK for Greenblatt, to be considered for National Book
award fantasizing about Will and Campion, but God forbid Oxfordians
demonstrate links between Cardanus Comforte, Hamlet, Oxford-Shakespeare
word usage , phraseology, and metaphor in the letter, in addition to
consciousness displayed in the prefatory poem, and ask, &quot;What is the
relationship between these two men?&quot;

When you consign exploratory links such as that to a particular
Stratfordian version of Purgatory, even leaving authorship assertions
aside, you leave your claim of &quot;scholar&quot; in the dirt and don the robes
of ideologue.

There can be sifting here, you know. Not everything is &quot;this&quot; or
&quot;that&quot;. But that would threaten you too much, wouldn't it.

These biographies get more and more out of control, all aping Looney
and the Oxfordians, desperate to find some relationship between life
and work. So Lear becomes a product of angst over retirement. How
droll. What nonsense.

You claim (sigh, with SUCH weariness), we are SO irrelevant. Crap.
Stratfordia has been reeling from the Oxfordians for over a decade.

Imitation is the best form of flattery.

Will can be anything, now, can't he? A concealed author by his own
choice. Flying under the radar. What a fascinating concept. Except as
one well versed fellow said on the SF site, &quot;anybody but Oxford,
anybody but Oxford&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; because you have yet to call attention to any anomalies that need

&gt;&gt;&gt; personally involved is not odd. That he should have sent copies
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; acquaintances is not odd. That William Shakespeare, a prominent

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; great degree, nor does it explain the other rare-word
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; parallels.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The OED has separate entries for &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky,&quot; and
&gt;&gt; seems
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regards
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them as different words, not as different spellings of
the
&gt;&gt; same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; word.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They appear to mean the same thing in Shakespeare, and we
&gt; know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spelling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't regularised. I would say that bosky and busky are at
&gt;&gt; least
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; close as bosky and bosk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynne

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If &quot;busky&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; were the same word to the author, that
&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an argument, albeit far from the weightiest one, against your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; position.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It would suggest that he changed the form of a word known to
be
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vocabulary to match the form used by Strachey, which in turn
&gt;&gt;&gt; suggests
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that he had read Strachey. There could, of course, be other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; explanations for the change, but it is certainly consistent
&gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conventional theory.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't be silly, Tom. You're telling me that because Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt; spelled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one word differently in two places he likely read Strachey, who
&gt; has
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different formation of the same word in an entirely different
&gt;&gt;&gt; context?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you never heard of compositors? They tended to spell
things
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idiosyncratically, and I read in Peter Blayney's book that one
&gt;&gt; could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even be distinguished from another by spelling in the ff. And
&gt;&gt;&gt; different
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quartos of Shakespeare plays have different spellings for what
&gt; were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presumably the same or similar words. In my OED, by the way,
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; entry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for &quot;busky&quot; says it's a variation of &quot;bosky.&quot; Does Terry not
have
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same OED? In any case, &quot;bosky&quot; hardly even merits a footnote in
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scheme of things.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is beginning to appear to me that you are making some kind
of
&gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Terry might call &quot;a special case&quot; for Strachey. It is
acceptable
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to explain much away by saying the date might/must have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; somewhere--and it was, but where it is militates against
&gt; Strachey's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; having sent the letter in July 1610--he must have given his
&gt;&gt;&gt; unpublished
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; letter to Shakespeare, etc., but at the same time you've
decided
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Strachey couldn't possibly have read Shakespeare's unpublished
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; play--although there must have been many more copies of the
play
&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; parts of the play than copies of the letter, plus performances.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You've
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concocted a beautiful imaginary tale for what happened to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Strachey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; letter so that Shakespeare could have read it, and feel that
what
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have done is reasonable speculation, but say that
&gt;&gt; anti-Stratfordians
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who suggest that Purchas invented the letter are on shaky
ground
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are in fact indulging in conspiracy theory. I suggest you're
both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; standing on shaky ground and moreover barking up the wrong
tree.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps we should end there, or at least, I should for the time
&gt;&gt;&gt; being.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can continue if you wish.

If by &quot;making now&quot;, you mean &quot;on this thread&quot;, I can find only one
contention that I have made about William Shakespeare of Stratford,
viz., that he was a prominent theatrical figure. That contention is
documented by records showing him to have been a principal member of
the Lord Chamberlain's and King's Men, a part-owner of the Globe and
Blackfriars Theaters, and an actor listed in the cast lists of plays by
Jonson and &quot;Shakespeare&quot; (whoever that was).

I have no idea what point you think you're making. For the record,
although I have a low opinion of Miss Price's scholarship, she is much
superior to Ogburn père, mère et fils, Richard Whalen, Joseph Sobran
and Roger Stritmatter, not to mention loony tunes like Paul Streitz.

As for the remainder of your screed, I think that, in your obvious and
abundant anger, you have confused me with somebody else. I've never
written a word about Greenblatt's biography of Shakespeare, nor about
the supposed resemblances between Cardanus Comforte and Hamlet. The
opinions that you attribute to me seem to derive from your rather
fevered image of your enemies rather than from reading what they write.

It's astonishing, too, considering that I've several times challenged
Ken to produce a single non-surmise in favor of Oxford after he'd
thrown his coulda/woulda boiler plate at me over at the Shakespeare
Fellowship, and I'd reminded him of the many non-surmises that show
that Shakespeare was Shakespeare--for instance, it's not a coulda that
his monument says he was a writer at the level of Virgil and worthy of
Olympus . . . Usually, my challenges knock him silent for a week or
so. But then back come the woulda/coulda posts.

It is, isn't it. Depends on your lens, doesn't it? Strats nEVER, EVER
have bad scholarship. Its only those bad, bad anti strats, particularly
those Oxfordians. So &quot;imagination&quot; and &quot;metaphor&quot; and possibly
&quot;archetype&quot; are wonderful things for big time Strat biographers to play
with and wander all over who knows what, but God forbid one might to
use those same tools from a different perspective to enlarge a
dialogue.

Too bad your mind is so literally oriented and ideologically fixed that
you never thought there might be some room there to create that kind of
space.

Surprised to see I elicited a response from you. Why don't you go screw
up the DNB some more with your partisan antics (talk about breathtaking
irony), or come out with more support for Foster. Or better yet, spin
me again the story that these biographies are just part of a &quot;cycle&quot;,
and they have *no* bearing on the Oxfordian movement's pressure.

Now, Bob, let's be truthful. And once again for the hundredth time, if
you are going to refer to a discussion on another site, PLEASE provide
some specific documentation or reference to a particular discussion
instead of your OPINION and ASSERTION of what may have taken place.

I have said often, and recently, that none of us refutes the power and
magnitude of dealing with the Folio and Monument attribution. It just
is not the end all and be all of the discussion, or exploration, which
I've tried to indicate here might have important other facets besides
&quot;who did it&quot;.

I admit these two , primarily in and of themselves, constitute and have
been the foundation for the orthodox attribution. Our problem, along
with many, as we've discussed thoudsands of times is the perceived gap
between the life and CPLE and that attribution.

As Tom has demonstrated aptly above, no one, even the best Strat
scholars, has a clue as to any relationshop between life and work. To
you, and Dave has said this openly, the attribution gives one license
to follow all these ludicrous flights of fancy.

I disagree and while admitting to the formidable nature of the Folio
evidence, I find it hypocrital in the greatest degree to not
acknowledge there is an authorship problem with the biography. That has
been my complaint from the beginning.

It's really very simple. Let's go back to Lynne's claim:

This claim, I have said, is false. It is NOT TRUE that &quot;'bosky' appears
elsewhere in the canon, in a much earlier play.&quot; The word &quot;busky&quot; DOES
appear in a much earlier play, but that is NOT the same word as &quot;bosky.&quot;
This is not my opinion, but that of the OED, which quotes Shakespeare's
use of &quot;bosky&quot; as an illustration of the word &quot;bosky&quot; --

1593 PEELE Chron. Edw. I (1874) 407 In this bosky wood Bury his corpse.

The bosky bourns of Alfred's shires. 1810 SCOTT Lady of L. III. xiv,
The bosky thickets. 1851 H. MELVILLE v. 33 A brown and brawny company
with bosky beards.

and quotes his use of the word &quot;busky&quot; as an illustration of the word
&quot;busky&quot; --

1570 LEVINS Manip. 99 Buskye, dumosus. 1596 SHAKES. 1 Hen. IV, V. i. 2
The Sunne begins to peere Aboue yon busky hill. 1600 TOURNEUR Transf.

J. RAYNOLDS Dolarnys Prim. (1880) 71 Huge Tmolus..with buskey haire.
c1800 K. WHITE Clift Gr. 272 Yon busky dingle.

The OED has separate entries for &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky,&quot; which are treated as
different words.

But let me add a complication. If you check Spevack's concordance, you
will not find two instances of &quot;bosky&quot;, as one would expect if &quot;busky&quot; and
&quot;bosky&quot; were considered spelling variants of the same word. The Spevack
is based on a normalized text, that of the Riverside (1st edition), and
mere spelling variants might not be treated as separate words. Nor is
there any entry at all for Spevack for &quot;busky.&quot; The word Shakespeare used
in 1H4 is neither &quot;busky&quot; nor &quot;bosky&quot; but &quot;bulky,&quot; which is the word that
appears in the First Quarto. Here are the lines from Q1:

King. How bloudily the sunne begins to peare
Aboue yon bulky hill, the day lookes pale
At his distemprature.

Here are the lines from F1:

King. How bloodily the Sunne begins to peere
Aboue yon busky hill: the day lookes pale
At his distemperature.

The textual notes to the Riverside point out that &quot;bulky&quot; appears in Q1,
(see the Q1 facsimile reproduced in Allen and Muir's *Shakespeare's Plays
in Quarto*, p. 364). Subsequent quartos were set in type from earlier
ones, and the First Folio was set from Q5. Later quartos and the First
Folio have &quot;busky&quot; rather than &quot;bulky.&quot; Why the change? The &quot;l&quot; in
&quot;bulky&quot; is rather faint, as the Riverside editors note (and as it appears
in the Q1 facsimile I checked). When Q2 was being set in type from Q1,
there may have been doubt about what the letter between &quot;bu&quot; and &quot;ky&quot; was,
and an &quot;s&quot; replaced the &quot;l&quot; that had appeared in Q1.

The changes from Q1 to Q2 (and on through Q5 and F1) are not considered
authorial by editors, and Q1 is used as the source text for modern
editions of 1H4 (checking editions on my shelves I find &quot;bulky&quot; in the
Riverside 1st edition, the Penguin 1st and 2nd, the Signet, the Oxford
modern spelling and original spelling editions edited by Wells and
Taylor).

So did Shakespeare ever use the word &quot;busky&quot;? If you answer &quot;yes,&quot; then
you must credit him with all the textual changes that appeared between Q1
and Q2, and you need to come up with an argument for regarding Q2 (or some
other post-Q1 version) as the copy text for 1H4. Until we see that
argument, we need not accept the reading &quot;busky.&quot;

In anticipation that you may some day wish to make that argument, it may
be worth spending some time on the OED entries fro &quot;bosky,&quot;&quot;bushy,&quot; and
&quot;busky.&quot;

WARNING: the rest of this post may strike some readers as trivial beyond
comprehension, as repetitive, as overconcerned with such minutiae as
font-changes between the 1st and 2nd editions of the OED. Proceed at
your peril.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you are arguing that OED does not give separate entries for words of
&gt; identical etymology and related or identical denotation, then your
&gt; argument is manifestly erroneous and, as I will show in a moment,
&gt; specifically in error with respect to the word in question.

"/>

It was Lynne's claim to have discovered that &quot;Dave and other
traditionalists are mistaken and 'bosky' appears elsewhere in the canon,
in a much earlier play&quot; that is erroneous (doubly erroneous now), since
the word &quot;busky&quot; does not appear in the version of 1H4 that is considered
by modern editors the one closest to Shakespeare's text, and since in any
event &quot;busky&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; are treated as separate words by the OED.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I think Lynne's claim is (or used to be) that &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; were
&gt;&gt; the same word -- not similar words, not related words, not neighbors or
&gt;&gt; friends, not even twins, but one and the same word. The OED does not
&gt;&gt; agree. If the OED considered them merely different spellings of the
&gt;&gt; same word, then the words would not have separate entries.

&gt; Terry, you're a master at interpreting evidence so that gullible readers
&gt; who don't themselves have access to the evidence to formulate their own
&gt; conclusions will unthinkingly agree with you.

I hope those who disagree and those who agree with me with me will do so
&quot;thinkingly,&quot; but that's not really something I can control. All I can do
is ask people to check for themselves if they think I'm trying to pull a
fast one.

If you and Lynne have a good argument to make, then by all means do so.
It really is not enough for Lynne to announce that you two have a good
argument that you intend to make some day, and expect us all to salute,
especially when the only point advance in support of your potential
argument is mistaken.

Lynne said about one part of your potential argument, &quot;I think we can
prove this, in fact I'm sure we can, but time will tell if you guys have a
decent come-back argument.&quot;

Isn't it a bit early for her to be longing for a &quot;decent come-back
argument&quot; when you have yet to give your readers your own argument?
Still, the very fact that you dream of a really strong argument for your
side was enough for Ken Kaplan, who said (very loyally),

&quot;In law there's this thing called chain of evidence. You ain't got one. If
you're going to refute Lynne. You'll have to do better.&quot;

That's MARVELOUS! Lynne dreams of an argument that you two may some day
make, and that will be so astonishing that the &quot;guys&quot; on hlas who do not
immediately accept every word from her as gospel may not even &quot;have a
decent come-back argument,&quot; and Ken, joining her dream, lectures the guys
about what they'll have to do to refute her -- when she has not yet
presented her argument.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In order to show how dubious your interpretation is, let's take another
&gt; look at what the OED actually says, in the OED's own words, about the

There is nothing whatsoever &quot;dubious&quot; about my argument -- in fact, it
hardly amounts to an argument at all, but is more of a factual
observation. The OED has separate entries for &quot;bushy&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; and
&quot;bosky,&quot; and considers them different words. I have also said that the
words are related, but they are different. I have now added a few words
about the textual history of 1H4 and suggested why they word &quot;busky&quot; may
NEVER have been used by Shakespeare (whose &quot;bulky&quot; was changed to &quot;busky&quot;
when a faint Q1 letter &quot;l&quot; was replaced by an &quot;s&quot; in Q2) -- thus even if
you disagree with the OED and consider &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; to be the same
word, you STILL can't claim that Shakespeare used &quot;b[ou]sky&quot; earlier than
*The Tempest*.

Incidentally, the OED has never noticed Shakespeare's use of &quot;bulky&quot; in
Q1. The first quotation given for the word is dated 1687 (this is true of
the 1st edition, the 2nd edition, and the online edition).

Back to &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; and how they grew.

Roger, please pay attention to what you have just posted. &quot;Bosky&quot; is
derived EITHER from the noun &quot;bosk&quot; plus &quot;-y&quot; OR is an &quot;alteration of
'busky'&quot; after an Italian form -- in neither case is it merely a variant
spelling of the same word. The references to &quot;bosk&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; are given

Yes, that is more than I ever wanted to know about &quot;busky&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot;.
The one other point that needs to be made is that, if the author of the
plays did regard the two as a single word, that fact would weaken the
Strachey-Shakespeare coincidence hardly at all. The author uses a word
once, then again years later, in a different form and in a much
different context and at just about the same time as Strachey is using
it in the same form and in the same context. If that were the *only*
resemblance between Strachey's letter and The Tempest, it would mean
little. As one of quite a few, it demands a better explanation than
Roger/Lynne have furnished.

&gt;&gt;&gt; From Roger:

&gt; It's really very simple. Let's go back to Lynne's claim:

&gt;&gt; Here I should say that Dave and other traditionalists are mistaken
and
&gt;&gt;&quot;bosky&quot; appears elsewhere in the canon, in a much earlier play. I
came
&gt;&gt; on it by accident, which is how I make most of my discoveries. :(

&gt; This claim, I have said, is false. It is NOT TRUE that &quot;'bosky'
appears

DOES
&gt; appear in a much earlier play, but that is NOT the same word as
&quot;bosky.&quot;
&gt; This is not my opinion, but that of the OED, which quotes
Shakespeare's
&gt; use of &quot;bosky&quot; as an illustration of the word &quot;bosky&quot; --

&gt; The OED has separate entries for &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky,&quot; which are
treated as
&gt; different words.

&gt; But let me add a complication. If you check Spevack's concordance,
you
&gt; will not find two instances of &quot;bosky&quot;, as one would expect if
&quot;busky&quot; and
&gt;&quot;bosky&quot; were considered spelling variants of the same word. The
Spevack
&gt; is based on a normalized text, that of the Riverside (1st edition),
and
&gt; mere spelling variants might not be treated as separate words. Nor
is
&gt; there any entry at all for Spevack for &quot;busky.&quot; The word Shakespeare
used
&gt; in 1H4 is neither &quot;busky&quot; nor &quot;bosky&quot; but &quot;bulky,&quot; which is the word
that
&gt; appears in the First Quarto. Here are the lines from Q1:

&gt; King. How bloudily the sunne begins to peare
&gt; Aboue yon bulky hill, the day lookes pale
&gt; At his distemprature.

&gt; Here are the lines from F1:

&gt; King. How bloodily the Sunne begins to peere
&gt; Aboue yon busky hill: the day lookes pale
&gt; At his distemperature.

&gt; The textual notes to the Riverside point out that &quot;bulky&quot; appears in
Q1,
&gt; (see the Q1 facsimile reproduced in Allen and Muir's *Shakespeare's
Plays
&gt; in Quarto*, p. 364). Subsequent quartos were set in type from
earlier
&gt; ones, and the First Folio was set from Q5. Later quartos and the
First
&gt; Folio have &quot;busky&quot; rather than &quot;bulky.&quot; Why the change? The &quot;l&quot; in
&gt;&quot;bulky&quot; is rather faint, as the Riverside editors note (and as it
appears
&gt; in the Q1 facsimile I checked). When Q2 was being set in type from
Q1,
&gt; there may have been doubt about what the letter between &quot;bu&quot; and &quot;ky&quot;
was,
&gt; and an &quot;s&quot; replaced the &quot;l&quot; that had appeared in Q1.

&gt; The changes from Q1 to Q2 (and on through Q5 and F1) are not
considered
&gt; authorial by editors, and Q1 is used as the source text for modern
&gt; editions of 1H4 (checking editions on my shelves I find &quot;bulky&quot; in
the
&gt; Riverside 1st edition, the Penguin 1st and 2nd, the Signet, the
Oxford
&gt; modern spelling and original spelling editions edited by Wells and
&gt; Taylor).

&gt; So did Shakespeare ever use the word &quot;busky&quot;? If you answer &quot;yes,&quot;
then
&gt; you must credit him with all the textual changes that appeared
between Q1
&gt; and Q2, and you need to come up with an argument for regarding Q2 (or
some
&gt; other post-Q1 version) as the copy text for 1H4. Until we see that
&gt; argument, we need not accept the reading &quot;busky.&quot;

&gt; In anticipation that you may some day wish to make that argument, it
may
&gt; be worth spending some time on the OED entries fro &quot;bosky,&quot;&quot;bushy,&quot;
and
&gt;&quot;busky.&quot;

&gt; WARNING: the rest of this post may strike some readers as trivial
beyond
&gt; comprehension, as repetitive, as overconcerned with such minutiae as
&gt; font-changes between the 1st and 2nd editions of the OED. Proceed at
&gt; your peril.

&gt;&gt; If you are arguing that OED does not give separate entries for
words of
&gt;&gt; identical etymology and related or identical denotation, then your
&gt;&gt; argument is manifestly erroneous and, as I will show in a moment,
&gt;&gt; specifically in error with respect to the word in question.

&gt; It was Lynne's claim to have discovered that &quot;Dave and other
&gt; traditionalists are mistaken and 'bosky' appears elsewhere in the
canon,
&gt; in a much earlier play&quot; that is erroneous (doubly erroneous now),
since
&gt; the word &quot;busky&quot; does not appear in the version of 1H4 that is
considered
&gt; by modern editors the one closest to Shakespeare's text, and since in
any
&gt; event &quot;busky&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; are treated as separate words by the OED.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think Lynne's claim is (or used to be) that &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot;
were
&gt;&gt;&gt; the same word -- not similar words, not related words, not
neighbors or
&gt;&gt;&gt; friends, not even twins, but one and the same word. The OED does
not
&gt;&gt;&gt; agree. If the OED considered them merely different spellings of
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same word, then the words would not have separate entries.

&gt;&gt; Terry, you're a master at interpreting evidence so that gullible
readers
&gt;&gt; who don't themselves have access to the evidence to formulate their
own
&gt;&gt; conclusions will unthinkingly agree with you.

&gt; I hope those who disagree and those who agree with me with me will do
so
&gt;&quot;thinkingly,&quot; but that's not really something I can control. All I
can do
&gt; is ask people to check for themselves if they think I'm trying to
pull a
&gt; fast one.

&gt; If you and Lynne have a good argument to make, then by all means do
so.
&gt; It really is not enough for Lynne to announce that you two have a
good
&gt; argument that you intend to make some day, and expect us all to
salute,
&gt; especially when the only point advance in support of your potential
&gt; argument is mistaken.

&gt; Lynne said about one part of your potential argument, &quot;I think we can
&gt; prove this, in fact I'm sure we can, but time will tell if you guys
have a
&gt; decent come-back argument.&quot;

&gt; Isn't it a bit early for her to be longing for a &quot;decent come-back
&gt; argument&quot; when you have yet to give your readers your own argument?
&gt; Still, the very fact that you dream of a really strong argument for
your
&gt; side was enough for Ken Kaplan, who said (very loyally),

&gt;&quot;In law there's this thing called chain of evidence. You ain't got
one. If
&gt; you're going to refute Lynne. You'll have to do better.&quot;

&gt; That's MARVELOUS! Lynne dreams of an argument that you two may some
day
&gt; make, and that will be so astonishing that the &quot;guys&quot; on hlas who do
not
&gt; immediately accept every word from her as gospel may not even &quot;have a
&gt; decent come-back argument,&quot; and Ken, joining her dream, lectures the
guys
&gt; about what they'll have to do to refute her -- when she has not yet
&gt; presented her argument.

&gt;&gt; In order to show how dubious your interpretation is, let's take
another
&gt;&gt; look at what the OED actually says, in the OED's own words, about
the
&gt;&gt; matter in dispute.

&gt; There is nothing whatsoever &quot;dubious&quot; about my argument -- in fact,
it
&gt; hardly amounts to an argument at all, but is more of a factual
&gt; observation. The OED has separate entries for &quot;bushy&quot; and &quot;busky&quot;

Unlike many other Oxfordians, I have never doubted there were

&gt; you're going to refute Lynne. You'll have to do better.&quot;

&gt; That's MARVELOUS! Lynne dreams of an argument that you two may some
day
&gt; make, and that will be so astonishing that the &quot;guys&quot; on hlas who do
not
&gt; immediately accept every word from her as gospel may not even &quot;have a
&gt; decent come-back argument,&quot; and Ken, joining her dream, lectures the
guys
&gt; about what they'll have to do to refute her -- when she has not yet
&gt; presented her argument.

&gt;&gt; In order to show how dubious your interpretation is, let's take
another
&gt;&gt; look at what the OED actually says, in the OED's own words, about
the
&gt;&gt; matter in dispute.

&gt; There is nothing whatsoever &quot;dubious&quot; about my argument -- in fact,
it
&gt; hardly amounts to an argument at all, but is more of a factual
&gt; observation. The OED has separate entries for &quot;bushy&quot; and &quot;busky&quot;
and
&gt;&quot;bosky,&quot; and considers them different words. I have also said that
the
&gt; words are related, but they are different. I have now added a few
words
&gt; about the textual history of 1H4 and suggested why they word &quot;busky&quot;
may
&gt; NEVER have been used by Shakespeare (whose &quot;bulky&quot; was changed to
&quot;busky&quot;
&gt; when a faint Q1 letter &quot;l&quot; was replaced by an &quot;s&quot; in Q2) -- thus even
if
&gt; you disagree with the OED and consider &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; to be the
same
&gt; word, you STILL can't claim that Shakespeare used &quot;b[ou]sky&quot; earlier
than
&gt; *The Tempest*.

&gt; Incidentally, the OED has never noticed Shakespeare's use of &quot;bulky&quot;
in
&gt; Q1. The first quotation given for the word is dated 1687 (this is
true of
&gt; the 1st edition, the 2nd edition, and the online edition).

&gt; Back to &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; and how they grew.

&gt;&gt; Here is the first of the two entries in question:

&gt;&gt; Bosky (written in bold) [(f. bosk not recorded between 14th and
19th
&gt;&gt; c., but preserved in dial.) + y: or alteration of BUSKY, after It.
&gt;&gt; boscoso] Consisting of or covered with bushes or underwood; full of
&gt;&gt; thickets, bushy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The words &quot;bushy&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; may have meant pretty
much
&gt;&gt;&gt; the same thing, and may well be related, but the OED gives them
&gt;&gt;&gt; separate entries

&gt;&gt; Yes, Terry, the entries are separate.

&gt; But Roger, that is exactly my point.

&gt;&gt; But please read the entry cited above. Even without looking at the
&gt;&gt; second entry, you should be able to determine that the OED does not
&gt;&gt; consider the two words to be different lexical items.

&gt; Roger, please pay attention to what you have just posted.

There are several distinct meanings of BOSC~ BUSK~, as below, with a dozen
earlier dates, unequivocal in Chaucer, and 2 in Anglo Saxon. Here are enough
illustrations to fit the [Shak] context:--
----------

BOSKE: a bush, &quot;A boske of breres, la dume.&quot; //Reliq. Antiq. ii. 83

which says &quot;/Bosky/, bushy, but generally explained /woody/, as in the
Tempest, iv. 1.

This is evidently not sufficient to date the term's use more than generally.
The stem~ seems to be the Anglo Norman BOSC: a bush, and BOSCARDE: A wood.
See /Boscage/ says Halliwell, Ywaine and Gawin, 1671; Skelton, 11. 28.
According to Blount, &quot;that food which wood and trees yield to cattle.&quot;
Cotgrave has, &quot;Infoliature, boscage, or leafe-worke in carving.

BOSCHAYLE: a thicket; a wood [A. N.]
BOSCHES: bushes
BOSHOLDER: a tithing man, the chielf person in an ancient tithing of ten
families //Lambard's Perambulations, ed. 1596, p. 27

But of BOSKED: see /Buske/

Therefore, the term Busk~y may be a localism for Bosc~. It is unfortunate
that Ray did not publish the first dictionary on English localisms and
regional dialects until 1674.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;The OED has separate entries for &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky,&quot; which are treated as

different words.

This is contentious in any specific case without sufficient citation, eg:

But let me add a complication. If you check Spevack's concordance, you
will not find two instances of &quot;bosky&quot;, as one would expect if &quot;busky&quot; and
&quot;bosky&quot; were considered spelling variants of the same word. The Spevack
is based on a normalized text, that of the Riverside (1st edition), and
mere spelling variants might not be treated as separate words. Nor is
there any entry at all for Spevack for &quot;busky.&quot; The word Shakespeare used
in 1H4 is neither &quot;busky&quot; nor &quot;bosky&quot; but &quot;bulky,&quot; which is the word that
appears in the First Quarto. Here are the lines from Q1:

King. How bloudily the sunne begins to peare
Aboue yon bulky hill, the day lookes pale
At his distemprature.

Here are the lines from F1:

King. How bloodily the Sunne begins to peere
Aboue yon busky hill: the day lookes pale
At his distemperature.

The textual notes to the Riverside point out that &quot;bulky&quot; appears in Q1,
(see the Q1 facsimile reproduced in Allen and Muir's *Shakespeare's Plays
in Quarto*, p. 364). Subsequent quartos were set in type from earlier
ones, and the First Folio was set from Q5. Later quartos and the First
Folio have &quot;busky&quot; rather than &quot;bulky.&quot; Why the change? The &quot;l&quot; in
&quot;bulky&quot; is rather faint, as the Riverside editors note (and as it appears
in the Q1 facsimile I checked). When Q2 was being set in type from Q1,
there may have been doubt about what the letter between &quot;bu&quot; and &quot;ky&quot; was,
and an &quot;s&quot; replaced the &quot;l&quot; that had appeared in Q1.

The changes from Q1 to Q2 (and on through Q5 and F1) are not considered
authorial by editors, and Q1 is used as the source text for modern
editions of 1H4 (checking editions on my shelves I find &quot;bulky&quot; in the
Riverside 1st edition, the Penguin 1st and 2nd, the Signet, the Oxford
modern spelling and original spelling editions edited by Wells and
Taylor).

So did Shakespeare ever use the word &quot;busky&quot;? If you answer &quot;yes,&quot; then
you must credit him with all the textual changes that appeared between Q1
and Q2, and you need to come up with an argument for regarding Q2 (or some
other post-Q1 version) as the copy text for 1H4. Until we see that
argument, we need not accept the reading &quot;busky.&quot;

In anticipation that you may some day wish to make that argument, it may
be worth spending some time on the OED entries fro &quot;bosky,&quot;&quot;bushy,&quot; and
&quot;busky.&quot;

WARNING: the rest of this post may strike some readers as trivial beyond
comprehension, as repetitive, as overconcerned with such minutiae as
font-changes between the 1st and 2nd editions of the OED. Proceed at

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you are arguing that OED does not give separate entries for words of
&gt; identical etymology and related or identical denotation, then your
&gt; argument is manifestly erroneous and, as I will show in a moment,
&gt; specifically in error with respect to the word in question.

"/>

It was Lynne's claim to have discovered that &quot;Dave and other
traditionalists are mistaken and 'bosky' appears elsewhere in the canon,
in a much earlier play&quot; that is erroneous (doubly erroneous now), since
the word &quot;busky&quot; does not appear in the version of 1H4 that is considered
by modern editors the one closest to Shakespeare's text, and since in any
event &quot;busky&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; are treated as separate words by the OED.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I think Lynne's claim is (or used to be) that &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; were
&gt;&gt; the same word -- not similar words, not related words, not neighbors or
&gt;&gt; friends, not even twins, but one and the same word. The OED does not
&gt;&gt; agree. If the OED considered them merely different spellings of the
&gt;&gt; same word, then the words would not have separate entries.

&gt; Terry, you're a master at interpreting evidence so that gullible readers
&gt; who don't themselves have access to the evidence to formulate their own

I hope those who disagree and those who agree with me with me will do so
&quot;thinkingly,&quot; but that's not really something I can control. All I can do
is ask people to check for themselves if they think I'm trying to pull a
fast one.

If you and Lynne have a good argument to make, then by all means do so.
It really is not enough for Lynne to announce that you two have a good
argument that you intend to make some day, and expect us all to salute,
especially when the only point advance in support of your potential
argument is mistaken.

Lynne said about one part of your potential argument, &quot;I think we can
prove this, in fact I'm sure we can, but time will tell if you guys have a
decent come-back argument.&quot;

Isn't it a bit early for her to be longing for a &quot;decent come-back
argument&quot; when you have yet to give your readers your own argument?
Still, the very fact that you dream of a really strong argument for your
side was enough for Ken Kaplan, who said (very loyally),

&quot;In law there's this thing called chain of evidence. You ain't got one. If
you're going to refute Lynne. You'll have to do better.&quot;

That's MARVELOUS! Lynne dreams of an argument that you two may some day

Tom, there is no reason to prepare a hypothetical response based on the
assumption that what Lynne said was correct. Here is the claim to which I
have been responding:

Dave and other traditionalists are mistaken and &quot;bosky&quot;
appears elsewhere in the canon, in a much earlier play.
I came on it by accident, which is how I make most
of my discoveries. :(

This claim is wrong; neither Dave nor the others whom the hypertraditional
Lynne calls &quot;traditionalists&quot; were mistaken to say that Shakespeare's one
and only use of &quot;bosky&quot; was in *The Tempest.*

1. While the word &quot;busky&quot; may be found in later quartos of *1H4* and in
the First Folio, its presence is most probably the result of a printer's
error. The word used in Q1 is &quot;bulky,&quot; and in that edition the &quot;l&quot; in
&quot;bulky&quot; is quite faint. When Q2 was set in type from a copy of Q1, the
letter &quot;s&quot; was used in place of the letter &quot;l&quot;; hence &quot;bulky&quot; became
&quot;busky.&quot; The Q1 text is used as the source text for every modern edition
I have checked; the change from &quot;bulky&quot; to &quot;busky&quot; is not considered
authorial.

2. The OED treats &quot;busky&quot; as a different word than &quot;bosky,&quot; and unless
there is some overwhelming reason NOT to go along with them, we should as
well.

Thus even if one produced an argument for accepting the Q2 change from
&quot;bulky&quot; to &quot;busky&quot; as something Shakespeare intended, it would STILL be
the case that Lynne's claim was false.

Why then should one imagine how one would respond if her claim had been
true? Rather let her withdraw the claim, and try to support her larger
argument (if indeed she has one) with points that are not false.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Rats, that is EXACTLY what I was going to say!

Bob, why bother refuting a false claim? As I have said here before,

It is always a good rule when dealing with Oxfordian claims first
to see whether they are factual (they generally are not) and only
then to consider whether they are pertinent (they never are).

There may be a slight exaggeration here, but if so, it is a very slight
one.

Not to give aid and comfort to the enemy, but ...

Would anyone in the Renaissance have made this distinction between &quot;busky&quot;
and &quot;bosky&quot;? I suppose that is exactly what the OED editors are trying to
tell us, but the OED is primarily concerned with written language, right? I
find it hard to believe that a theater-goer, even without the separation of
a decade between uses, would have thought they were different words. If the
1H4 &quot;busky&quot; holds up, I would agree with the contention that *Shakespeare*
thought he was using the same word, with slightly different pronunciations.

On the other hand ... the &quot;bulky-busky&quot; issue is a valid point of
contention. The passage at issue is (Henry IV, immediately before the
battle of Shrewsbury):

How bloodily the sun begins to peer
Above yon busky/bulky hill! the day looks pale
At his distemperature.

Editors seem to agree Shakespeare meant &quot;bulky&quot;, treating the Q2 emendation
as &quot;unnecessary&quot;. The Arden Third Series points out that it may refer to an
actual topographic feature of the field of battle and that it hearkens back
to the portliness of both Henry and Falstaff. These *might* have been
relevant to Shakespeare, writing the play, but I'm quite certain no audience
member would make the topographic connection, and the Falstaff-connection
would have been subliminal at best (unless you directed Henry to point past
Falstaff ... could be funny onstage.) On the whole, I find the logical
connection weak.

As someone who has played Henry IV, however, I suggest that most actors
would prefer &quot;busky&quot;. It's a crisper word, and no less descriptive. The
speech alternates between sharp and dull words, and the position of
busky/bulky seems to call for the sharper choice. I would not be at all
surprised if Q2 represented a valid correction.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, that is more than I ever wanted to know about &quot;busky&quot; and

&gt;&gt;&gt; The one other point that needs to be made is that, if the author
of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; plays did regard the two as a single word, that fact would weaken
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Strachey-Shakespeare coincidence hardly at all. The author uses a
word
&gt;&gt;&gt; once, then again years later, in a different form and in a much
&gt;&gt;&gt; different context and at just about the same time as Strachey is
using
&gt;&gt;&gt; it in the same form and in the same context. If that were the
*only*
&gt;&gt;&gt; resemblance between Strachey's letter and The Tempest, it would
mean
&gt;&gt;&gt; little. As one of quite a few, it demands a better explanation
than
&gt;&gt;&gt; Roger/Lynne have furnished.

&gt; Tom, there is no reason to prepare a hypothetical response based on
the
&gt; assumption that what Lynne said was correct. Here is the claim to
which I
&gt; have been responding:

&gt; Dave and other traditionalists are mistaken and &quot;bosky&quot;
&gt; appears elsewhere in the canon, in a much earlier play.
&gt; I came on it by accident, which is how I make most
&gt; of my discoveries. :(

&gt; This claim is wrong; neither Dave nor the others whom the
hypertraditional
&gt; Lynne calls &quot;traditionalists&quot; were mistaken to say that Shakespeare's
one
&gt; and only use of &quot;bosky&quot; was in *The Tempest.*

&gt; 1. While the word &quot;busky&quot; may be found in later quartos of *1H4* and
in
&gt; the First Folio, its presence is most probably the result of a
printer's
&gt; error. The word used in Q1 is &quot;bulky,&quot; and in that edition the &quot;l&quot;
in
&gt;&quot;bulky&quot; is quite faint. When Q2 was set in type from a copy of Q1,
the
&gt; letter &quot;s&quot; was used in place of the letter &quot;l&quot;; hence &quot;bulky&quot; became
&gt;&quot;busky.&quot; The Q1 text is used as the source text for every modern
edition
&gt; I have checked; the change from &quot;bulky&quot; to &quot;busky&quot; is not considered
&gt; authorial.

&gt; 2. The OED treats &quot;busky&quot; as a different word than &quot;bosky,&quot; and
unless
&gt; there is some overwhelming reason NOT to go along with them, we
should as
&gt; well.

&gt; Thus even if one produced an argument for accepting the Q2 change
from
&gt;&quot;bulky&quot; to &quot;busky&quot; as something Shakespeare intended, it would STILL
be
&gt; the case that Lynne's claim was false.

"/>

Would you like me to rephrase: A variant of &quot;bosky&quot; appears elsewhere
in the canon, in a much earlier play. I came on it by accident, which
is how I make most of my discoveries. :(

If you are now changing your argument to say that Shakespeare didn't
mean &quot;busky&quot; at all, but &quot;bulky&quot; (God, horrible word in that context),
just to please me, show me where Strachey previously uses bosky or
busky (or even bulky). I haven't checked but the problem is that
traditionalists (is that word not ok to use? I switched to it when you
guys didn't like &quot;Stratfordians.&quot; I'm having difficultly finding
something acceptable) would be hard pressed to show any previous use of
any of the words, phrases, or sentences in Strachey that Dave calls
parallels to Shakespeare. To say this is not important would be to deny
part of Dave's argument, which is that usage is significant. He keeps
writing (paraphrased): &quot;Shakespeare uses this word only three times.
Shakespeare uses this word only once. Shakespeare doesn't use this word
elsewhere in the canon.&quot;

Dave's interest in previous usage (without taking into consideration
Strachey's usage, by the way) is not, however, the main thrust of our
argument, which we would get down on paper if people gave us half a
chance.

That's an interesting question. There are actually THREE closely related
words involved (of course, we're assuming at this point that the Q2
reading &quot;busky&quot; instead of the Q1 &quot;bulky&quot; represents Shakespeare's choice,
which is a considerable leap) -- &quot;bosky,&quot;&quot;bushy,&quot; and &quot;busky.&quot; How many
writers used more than one of those words? Did any writer use all three?
Milton distinguished &quot;bushy&quot; from &quot;bosky&quot;; his one use of the latter is in
a self-consciously pastoral speech by Comus. Milton may well have been
influenced by the word's use in a speech by Ceres that also partook of a
self-consciously pastoral context.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes; part of the problem is that dialectical forms may survive without
recorded in documents known to the OED; hence the OED's remark that the
term &quot;bosk&quot; disappears from the written record between the 14th and 19th
Centuries. The OED missed Strachey's use of &quot;bosk,&quot; and perhaps missed
others as well. The OED also missed Shakespeare's early use of &quot;bulky.&quot;

What &quot;1H4 'busky'&quot;? Look in all the modern editions of 1H4 that you own,
and tell me how many have &quot;busky&quot; rather than &quot;bulky&quot; in the third line of
act 5 scene 1. All the ones I checked have &quot;bulky.&quot; The Spevack
concordance has no entry for Shakespeare's ever having used &quot;busky&quot; but it
does have his single uses of &quot;bulky&quot; in 1H4 and &quot;bosky&quot; in *The Tempest*.
Now there may be some theater-goers who would not hear any difference
between &quot;bulky&quot; and &quot;bosky,&quot; but those are the people who need concern us
here.

We cannot decide that we prefer &quot;busky&quot; to &quot;bulky&quot; because it makes life
easier for Lynne and Roger, just as we cannot decide to reject &quot;busky&quot;
because doing so would be a thorn in their path. The choice for &quot;bulky&quot;
is made on editorial grounds that are widely accepted, but those grounds
could be overturned IF Roger and Lynne constructed a solid case for
rejecting the textual authority of the Q1 text of 1H4. I don't think they
can make the case, but if they wish to try, then I will hear them out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Your are certainly entitled to your belief about how you would react today
if you heard the words, but I hope you will understand why that may not be
sufficient for some of the rest of us. I don't know about you, but I try
to notice how words in Shakespeare are spoken -- how do the actors say
&quot;Milan&quot; or &quot;Calais&quot; or &quot;Petruchio&quot;? Is Hamlet's flesh too too &quot;solid&quot; or
&quot;sullied&quot; or &quot;sallied&quot;?

On Shakespeare's birthday my wife and I watched two films: the Charley
Chase two-reeler *Bromo and Juliet* (which contains some delightful
business by the star, and some very enjoyable trashing of famous
Shakespeare scenes, as well as a performance by a pre-Laurel Oliver
Hardy), and the MGM *Romeo and Juliet* (with Leslie Howard and Norma
Shearer). We were struck by Juliet's saying &quot;when HE is dead / Take him
and cut him out in little stars&quot; rather than &quot;when I am dead / Take him
and cut him out in little stars.&quot; Are there some people who would not
notice or care whether she said &quot;he&quot; or &quot;I&quot;? No doubt.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; On the other hand ... the &quot;bulky-busky&quot; issue is a valid point of

More than that, we have a very good idea of how it may well have occurred.

Don't sell the entire audience short. Anyone who eavesdrop a bit during
intermission will notice that there are some people in today's audiences
who get nothing more than the gist (if that) of Shakespearean speeches,
while others seem to get more than one might have thought possible.
Surely the most capable members of Shakespeare's audience were at least as
attentive as today's most capable members. Of course sometimes an actor
does not understand the lines he is speaking; sometimes actors rewrite or
forget lines; sometimes actors are given business that provides
alternative jokes for those members of the audience who don't laugh at
Shakespeare's jokes.

Har-de-har-har.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the whole, I find the logical connection weak.

"/>

You have your preferences; on merely aesthetic grounds I prefer &quot;bulky&quot; to
&quot;busky.&quot; If there is no difference at all between &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky,&quot;
then &quot;busky&quot; seems a little too down-home for the speaker and the
occasion, and it also seems physically inaccurate. If the sun were
beginning to peer over a &quot;busky&quot; hill, then the buskiness would be
noticeable because the sun was peering not just over but THROUGH some of
the busk. The &quot;bulk&quot; of the hills would be noticeable at the first light
that appeared over that bulk. The hills are more solid and ominous if
they are &quot;bulky,&quot; and the dawn is slightly earlier than if the hills are
&quot;busky.&quot;

That said, if the words were reversed -- that is,

If the Q1 text were used as the copy text by modern editors, AND

If the Q1 text read &quot;busky&quot;, AND

If the &quot;s&quot; in the Q1 text were so very faint that the word &quot;busky&quot; could
easily be misread when Q2 was set in type from Q1 as &quot;bulky&quot;,

-- then I would have no hesitation in accepting &quot;busky.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; As someone who has played Henry IV, however, I suggest that most actors
&gt; would prefer &quot;busky&quot;. It's a crisper word, and no less descriptive.

Crisper? Nothing adds &quot;crispness&quot; quite like the letter &quot;s,&quot; I suppose.
Actors with sibilance problems might prefer &quot;bulky.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The speech alternates between sharp and dull words, and the position of
&gt; busky/bulky seems to call for the sharper choice. I would not be at all
&gt; surprised if Q2 represented a valid correction.

"/>

In the old days editors would pick and choose from the various texts to
create the version of the play they would have preferred if they could
have advised Shakespeare. That hasn't been the fashion for some time, but
in performance, greater leeway can be allowed. If you're directing 1H4
and prefer &quot;busky&quot; or even &quot;bosky&quot; to &quot;bulky,&quot; then you can make that
choice. In *Measure for Measure* I have heard &quot;filling a bottle with a
tundish&quot; changed to &quot;filling a bottle with a funnel,&quot; presumably on the
grounds that the latter meant pretty much the same as the former, but was
more familiar; if the word &quot;tundish&quot; were kept, then only pedants and
steelworkers would get the joke.

But this was not Lynne's point. Lynne's point was this:

Dave and other traditionalists are mistaken and &quot;bosky&quot;
appears elsewhere in the canon, in a much earlier play.
I came on it by accident, which is how I make most
of my discoveries. :(

Lynne was wrong. &quot;Bosky&quot; does not occur elsewhere in the canon;
Shakespeare's one and only instance of the word is in *The Tempest*.

Yes - I could understand the gloss; a progression from the idea of; to

In the same way Bosc/Busk were originally woodlands or woodland bushes, then

Terry, this is actually quite interesting. I'm sure a theatre-goer
would have been able to distinguish that &quot;bushy&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; were
different words with the same meaning; however, I'm not so sure that
they would have recognised the difference between &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky,&quot;
especially when we take into account different accents and dialects,
which I assume were much stronger at the time.

Even today, the u in &quot;busky&quot; would we pronounced like the u in &quot;mutt&quot;
to Southerners in England, but would be closer to the u in &quot;put&quot; to
Northerners, or even the o in &quot;bosky&quot; or somewhere in between. It would
take an expert on dialect to let us know whether this was so during the
Elizabethan era, and even then I fear his or her opinion would to some
extent involve guesswork.

I hear it the other way with modern Americans. It drives me crazy that
Buffalonians, or whatever they're called, pronounce &quot;dollars&quot; as
&quot;dullars&quot; when fund-raising on our local PBS station. A friend of mine
does that too. :(

&gt; writers used more than one of those words?

"/>

It is common in old texts to find 3 spellings of the same word! Chaucer, eg.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Did any writer use all three? Milton distinguished &quot;bushy&quot; from &quot;bosky&quot;;
&gt; his one use of the latter is in a self-consciously pastoral speech by
&gt; Comus. Milton may well have been influenced by the word's use in a speech
&gt; by Ceres that also partook of a self-consciously pastoral context.

&gt;&gt; I suppose that is exactly what the OED editors are trying to tell us, but
&gt;&gt; the OED is primarily concerned with written language, right?

&gt; Yes; part of the problem is that dialectical forms may survive without
&gt; recorded in documents known to the OED; hence the OED's remark that the
&gt; term &quot;bosk&quot; disappears from the written record between the 14th and 19th
&gt; Centuries.

?! Perhaps somewhere after 1675.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The OED missed Strachey's use of &quot;bosk,&quot; and perhaps missed others as
&gt; well. The OED also missed Shakespeare's early use of &quot;bulky.&quot;

"/>

What are you taking 'bulky' to indicate? Is there other Elizabethan use of
it as a modern term?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I find it hard to believe that a theater-goer, even without the

I think some strong comment from a medieval linguist on the subject of
'Standard English' is in order. In short, there was none. It was a
retrofitted invention suggesting an homgeneity which never existed, and
where it may have pertained, only to the extent that a few percentum of
people may have used a word or spelling as standard, and these located in
either [probably not and] London or Oxford.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If the 1H4 &quot;busky&quot; holds up,
&gt;&gt; I would agree with the contention that *Shakespeare* thought he was using
&gt;&gt; the same word, with slightly different pronunciations.

&gt; Your are certainly entitled to your belief about how you would react today
&gt; if you heard the words, but I hope you will understand why that may not be
&gt; sufficient for some of the rest of us. I don't know about you, but I try
&gt; to notice how words in Shakespeare are spoken -- how do the actors say
&gt;&quot;Milan&quot; or &quot;Calais&quot; or &quot;Petruchio&quot;? Is Hamlet's flesh too too &quot;solid&quot; or
&gt;&quot;sullied&quot; or &quot;sallied&quot;?

"/>

Good point, and the answer is that we don't know unless we perceive the word
usually in several [rhyming and metered preferably] texts, since there are
then comparisons.

In addition BOSC~ is A. Sax. The root is much older however, and is British.
In the resilient South West the stem appears in place-names such as Boscawen
and Boscastle and Bosmary [Cwll.]

tends to involve us and motivate participation.

I have no idea whether S or the players did trial balloons with
&quot;off-Broadway,&quot; select scenes for little theaters, or traveling shows
before dressing up a full production; but no doubt, like players in a
company, we all are enjoying being part of your rehearsals for the
scholarly performance at Ashland and what follows in the media.
Moving and shaking scenes on both coasts as well as several news
groups, and sharing with everyone your production plans is highly
dramatic and engaging for us, I think, no matter how it all shakes
out. bookburn

&gt; Terry, this is actually quite interesting. I'm sure a theatre-goer would

Different words with somewhat different (but related) meanings. In any
event, the point is a distraction from the double falsehood of your claim
that

Dave and other traditionalists are mistaken and &quot;bosky&quot;
appears elsewhere in the canon, in a much earlier play.
I came on it by accident, which is how I make most
of my discoveries. :(

The word &quot;bulky&quot; (which I don't think the hearers of Shakespeare's day
would have confused with &quot;bushy&quot; or &quot;bosky&quot; or &quot;busky&quot;) appears in the
first quarto of 1H4. In the printing of the word, the &quot;l&quot; in &quot;bulky&quot; was
quite faint, and it is quite likely that when Q2 was set up for Q1, an &quot;s&quot;
was substituted for the &quot;l&quot; by mistake. Each successive quarto departs
further from the one thought to be closest to Shakespeare's text, and the
First Folio is even further removed. Q1 of 1H4 is not considered a &quot;bad
quarto,&quot; and modern editors use it as the copy text for the play. They do
not regard the change from &quot;bulky&quot; to &quot;busky&quot; as authorial. If you DO
wish to regard the change as authorial, then I look forward to your
argument in favor of Shakespeare's correcting the Q1 text. Until then,
let us agree with the modern editors that the word in 1H4 was &quot;bulky.&quot;

Until we see that argument, though, it might be just as well for you to
withdraw your false claim that Dave and the other &quot;traditionalists&quot; are
wrong to cite *The Tempest* as the location of Shakespeare's first use of
&quot;bosky.&quot;

Oh yes; at that point (if you ever reach that point) the
&quot;bosky/bushy/busky&quot; business could come back to haunt us, and you would
then need to tell us why the OED is wrong to treat &quot;bosky,&quot;&quot;busky,&quot; and
&quot;busky,&quot; as three different main words.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; however, I'm not so sure that they would have recognised the difference
&gt; between &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky,&quot; especially when we take into account
&gt; different accents and dialects, which I assume were much stronger at the
&gt; time.

"/>

That is an interesting question (although it has no bearing on your
erroneous claim). How would you go about investigating such a point?

One approach (which would not settle the issue but which might shed some
light) is to look at other pairs of words that one can find in the
literature of the day that varied only in the vowel sounds we find in
&quot;busky&quot; and &quot;bosky.&quot; What about &quot;mock&quot; and &quot;muck,&quot; another pair of words
that vary only in those vowels. Do you think either readers or members of
the audience were unable to hear the difference?

Our spoyles he kickt at,
And look'd vpon things precious, as they were
The common Muck of the World: he couets lesse
Then Miserie it selfe would giue, rewards his deeds
With doing them, and is content
To spend the time, to end it.

But I will rise there with so full a glorie,
That I will dazle all the eyes of France,
Yea strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs,
And tell the pleasant Prince, this Mocke of his
Hath turn'd his balles to Gun-stones, and his soule
Shall stand sore charged, for the wastefull vengeance
That shall flye with them:

What about &quot;duck&quot; and &quot;dock&quot;?

Tri. Swom ashore (man) like a Ducke: I can swim
like a Ducke i'le be sworne.

Ant. Hee'd sow't vvith Nettle-seed.
Seb. Or dockes, or Mallowes.

Do you think readers or listeners of the time would have been unable to
distinguish such pairs as &quot;stock&quot; and &quot;stuck,&quot;&quot;lock&quot; and &quot;luck,&quot; and so
on? Of course these pairs are more different in meaning than &quot;bosky&quot; and
&quot;bushy&quot; and &quot;busky,&quot; but if the word pairs WERE pronounced
indistinguishably, then we might expect to find Shakespeare (or other
poets of the time) rhyming &quot;uck&quot; words with &quot;ock&quot; words. Do you think
there were many such rhymes? Can you give us a few examples?

We also might expect &quot;-ock/-uck&quot; word puns such as the &quot;Rome/room&quot; bit in
*Julius Caesar* -- a pun that does not work today, but that did work when
&quot;Rome&quot; and &quot;room&quot; were homonyms.

So are &quot;duck&quot; and &quot;dock&quot; homonyms in Shakespeare? Were they words that
Shakespeare thought rhymed? Were they so close in sound and so likely to
be confused that he punned one against the other? If so, then perhaps
&quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; would have been homonyms for him, if Shakespeare had
ever come across the latter word.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Even today, the u in &quot;busky&quot; would we pronounced like the u in &quot;mutt&quot; to
&gt; Southerners in England, but would be closer to the u in &quot;put&quot; to
&gt; Northerners, or even the o in &quot;bosky&quot; or somewhere in between. It would
&gt; take an expert on dialect to let us know whether this was so during the
&gt; Elizabethan era, and even then I fear his or her opinion would to some
&gt; extent involve guesswork.

"/>

Dialectically different groups of speakers may have somewhat different
sets of vowel sounds, but the two sounds in question do not appear to have
been identical in Shakespeare's works, and even when Shakespeare writes in
dialect, I don't think he makes &quot;-uck/-ock&quot; confusion a part of the
procedure.

I grew up speaking an accent in which &quot;Mary,&quot;&quot;marry,&quot; and &quot;merry&quot; were
perfect homonyms, and it was startling at first to listen to people who
distinguished the vowels in those words. Alan J. Lerner seems to have
thought &quot;rather&quot; would rhyme with &quot;bother&quot; in Freddie Eynsford-Hill's
accent. I have known people who pronounced &quot;milk&quot; as &quot;melk.&quot; This does
not mean that all vowels are interchangeable, or even that every set of
variations we come across today in regional accents or dialects must have
had its correspondence in Shakespeare's writings.

Even if we cannot say with precision which particular modern sound
Shakespeare himself would have uttered, we can at least get a pretty good
idea of which ones sounded close enough for him to rhyme.

If Shakespeare rhymed &quot;pluck with &quot;luck&quot; but not with &quot;clock&quot; or &quot;dock&quot;,
if Shakespeare rhymed &quot;not&quot; with &quot;blot&quot; and &quot;got&quot; and &quot;plot&quot; but not with
&quot;gut&quot;; -- if Shakespeare consistently rhymed words that had the vowel of
&quot;bosk&quot; with other similarly vowelled words while rhyming 'busk'-vowelled
words with each other (but did not consistently mix the rhyme words from
the different sets), then we may be reasonably confident that he would not
have pronounced &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; alike even if he had known the latter
word.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I hear it the other way with modern Americans. It drives me crazy that
&gt; Buffalonians, or whatever they're called, pronounce &quot;dollars&quot; as
&gt;&quot;dullars&quot; when fund-raising on our local PBS station. A friend of mine
&gt; does that too. :(

"/>

Some birders pronounce the second syllable of Osprey as &quot;PRAY,&quot; or the
first syllable of Pileated as &quot;pill&quot;; some even stress the second syllable
of Egrets (which one should only do for the rare and endangered birds know
as the Miss Otis Egrets).

And let's not even go near the mispronunciation of &quot;nuclear.&quot;

&gt; Aye. But it illustrated quite well the difference in scholarly

I've not read the posts on &quot;busky&quot; and
&quot;bosky&quot;(and probably won't). But, whether
or not Terry is right in this instance, we
should expect such differences. There are
VAST numbers of well-financed 'scholars'
in the Shakespeare industry. Then, while
it's easy to see that the Strat theory is
nonsense (with those illiterate parents and
illiterate children, etc.), it's very difficult to
clarify exactly what took place. We should
expect to see what we get -- all manner of
wild theories.

Inevitably, many anti-Strats are odd-balls
with strange beliefs. They are nearly
always amateurs. It's easy to pick on some
of the weakest (such as Lynne and Roger,
who, if they can go wrong, they will).
Winning an argument against them is a
no-brainer. But you'll notice how careful
Terry is to avoid me. Last time I tried to
engage him (last December), he dropped
out on the grounds that I used the
dreadful word: 'b*llsh*t'.

That won't help you, because the word &quot;bosky&quot; is not found elsewhere in
the canon (the word elsewhere in the canon is &quot;bulky&quot; -- which surely you
do not consider &quot;a variant of 'bosky'), and because even the word &quot;busky,&quot;

It is not a change in an argument but an additional point - one that makes
my earlier response even less important. I don't know why on earth you
should want to find &quot;bulky&quot; in Strachey, unless you want to claim that he
found the word in 1H4. Actually, that WOULD be a rather interesting find,
but it would not have any bearing on Shakespeare's familiarity with

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It's not really very helpful. The Oxfordians as a group seem more
slavishly &quot;traditional&quot; than a great many Shakespeare scholars. One still
finds Oxfordians who trust what they read in Looney or Clark or the

I don't know how many of &quot;us guys&quot; oppose the term, but it is not one I
would use of myself. I do not make an idol of William Shakespeare, and
when I visit his home town I do not check my sense of irony outside the
town limits.

I have no special rules of evidence that apply only in the case of
Shakespeare, but Oxfordianism is impossible without the deploying of
special Oxford-only rules of gullibility and Shakespeare-only rules of
cynicism. I do not use different standards for evaluating attributions to
Shakespeare than I would use for attributions to Spenser or Daniel or
Sidney or Jonson or Marlowe or any other writer of the period, but the
only Oxfordians who can justly make a similar claim are those who think
Oxford wrote everything, and they have no standards worth the name. Even
that is just the borrowing of an older (but no more honored) tradition,
that of the Baconian universalists, who thought THEIR lad wrote
everything.

The problem is that neither you nor Roger appears to have done your
homework. If you had done your homework, then you would have known that
the only time &quot;bosky&quot; or any variant appears in the canon is in *The
Tempest*. The word we find in that play is actually &quot;boskie,&quot; which I
think we all grant is a variant of &quot;bosky.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To say this is not important would be to deny part of Dave's argument,
&gt; which is that usage is significant. He keeps writing (paraphrased):
&gt;&quot;Shakespeare uses this word only three times. Shakespeare uses this word
&gt; only once. Shakespeare doesn't use this word elsewhere in the canon.&quot;

"/>

That's part of how such an argument can be made. You find clusters of
correspondences, and it would be helpful if some of what you found was not
too common. It's not very useful to say that both Strachey and
Shakespeare used &quot;the&quot; or &quot;is.&quot;

Here is how Dave introduces the &quot;Miscellaneous Verbal Parallels&quot; section
of his essay:

&quot;None of the following parallels would have much value as evidence taken
by themselves, but combined with the mass of correspondences noted above,
I think they can be taken as further evidence of Shakespeare's knowledge
of Strachey's account:&quot;

One of those miscellaneous parallels is the following:

&quot;Strachey mentions 'Boske running along the ground' (48); in the masque in
The Tempest, Ceres mentions 'my bosky acres' (4.1.81), Shakespeare's only
use of this word.&quot;

Dave does NOT say he finds the word &quot;bulky&quot; in Strachey, not does he say
he found &quot;bosky.&quot; Dave does NOT say &quot;the presence of 'bosky' in *The
Tempest* is in and of itself proof that Shakespeare had read Strachey's
letter before writing his play.&quot; Rather this is but one of a set of
miscellaneous parallels (no one of them compelling by itself) which
together with the other parallels already mentioned strengthens the case
for Shakespeare's having seen Strachey's letter before he wrote *The
Tempest*.

Dave again:

&quot;As the above list shows, Strachey's *True Reportory* (and to a lesser
extent the other two narratives) pervades the entire play. It provides the
basic premise and background of the shipwreck, many details of the storm,
the general characteristics of the island along with many details, the
basic elements and many details of the conspiracies, many verbal parallels
(most of them involving similar or identical contexts), and direct
suggestions of the magic, love story, wood-carrying, and Prospero vs.
Caliban elements of the play. Moreover, it is obvious that Shakespeare
could only have borrowed from Strachey, Jourdain, and *A True Declaration*
rather than the other way around; this was not another work of fiction
Shakespeare was basing his play on, but three independent accounts of
actual events which did not happen until 1609-10.&quot;

It's not merely a question of a detail here and a detail there; rather
Dave presents a large set of &quot;thematic, verbal, and plot correspondences&quot;
between Strachey's account and *The Tempest*.

Dave gives detailed citations to Shakespeare and Strachey (and the others
who wrote accounts of the Sea-venture's voyage), so that it will be easy
to check the parallels for yourself.

Is Dave's essay irrefutable? Perhaps not; perhaps you and Roger will be
the ones to offer a strong counter. I wish you well in the attempt. I do
not, however, wish to applaud the duet before it has been composed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Dave's interest in previous usage (without taking into consideration
&gt; Strachey's usage, by the way) is not, however, the main thrust of our

Lynne, it may well be that &quot;bosky/busky/bu[ls]ky&quot; has little to do with it
it now, but that was just about the only morsel you offered &quot;us guys&quot; on

&gt;&gt; Bob, why bother refuting a false claim? As I have said here before,

&gt;&gt; It is always a good rule when dealing with Oxfordian claims first
&gt;&gt; to see whether they are factual (they generally are not) and only
&gt;&gt; then to consider whether they are pertinent (they never are).

It is sound advice; it may not be 100% applicable, but it is much more

anybody who might read my words with approval that recently was posted
here from your account:

Terry, you're a master at interpreting evidence so that gullible
readers who don't themselves have access to the evidence to
formulate their own conclusions will unthinkingly agree with you.

Mild stuff by the standards of a newsgroup, I grant you, but I think if I

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; There may be a slight exaggeration here, but if so, it is a very slight

That's the thing -- you say &quot;as I will see&quot; -- &quot;as I WILL see&quot;: but I've
been snuffling about in this bosk for many years, and time and again I
have seen Oxfordian claims come along that were absolutely worthless. Is
that going to change? Perhaps it will, and perhaps I will then have cause

You and Tom and Dave et al miss the point entirely. I have no qualms
admitting a case for Oxford is circumstantial, that there is no direct
link in the same manner as the Folio attribution. That I can't provide
one. I also freely admit my doubts and confusions in the matter.

What I AM clear about is what I consider the rankest hypocricy of the
pot calling the kettle black. I have said before and I will say it
again that whatever the &quot;truth&quot; may be, the BIOGRAPHY as constituted is
problematic and that doubting it, examiming it, is not some form of
heresy. That I accept Price's criticisms, which are nothing more than a
codification of critiques made by Greenwood, Looney, Twain, and a host
of others concerning a strange lack of evifdence where one would
suppose SOME evidence to exist from a man who had a twenty + year
career in the center of the London Renaissance and became the most
famous literary writer of all time, yet remaimns so obscure as to look
and feel like a masque for someone else.

Furthermore, as the author of this thread implictly implied, the level
of scholarship often used to VALIDATE that biography and its component
parts has at times been flawed, manipiulated, or dishonestly presented.
(The last two are mine, not Lynne's) David Kathman's presentation on
Meres in the DNB is an example of such manipulation, subtle but present
to advance a cause.

All I've ever asked is honesty from Stratfordia. Honesty about the
emptiness of its bio, honesty about some respect that others might have
a problem with the constituted terrain. Some Strats are honest, such as
Schoenbaum late in life. Even Greenblatt was partially honest in
admitting that the paucity of evidence he found grudgingly gave him
some insight as to why there were doubters and where they were coming
from.

To disagree is one thing. Security in one's itellectual stance allows
for discourse, openness, exploration But the &quot;Rovian&quot; (Karl Rove)
stance of the majority of Stratfordians, including the hard core
ideologues here and elsewhere demonstrate something else, a hardness, a
religiosity that only seeks to smear.

Many of us have talked time and again about the freshness authorship
considerations bring, especially to students, how Shakespeare becomes
more relevant to them, more a part of their lives, how a process of
intellectual investigation is opened in them. These are all good
things.
What we get here and elsewhere is hysteria, more akin to Salem than
anything else. God forbid one questin the true faith.

in

&gt;&quot;Coulda, shoulda, woulda. Must have, might have, could have. Perhaps,

&gt;&quot;In law there's this thing called chain of evidence. You ain't got
one.

&gt; If you're going to refute Lynne. You'll have to do better.

&gt;&quot;Once again we run into the typical pile of Strat manure. You're
making

&gt; Greenblatt look grounded.&quot;

&gt; Ken Kaplan

&gt; Aside from that, I see no reason I should not mention (open)
&gt; conversations elsewhere, or that I should provide evidence for every
&gt; minor assertion I make. I people don't think I can be trusted, so be
&gt; it. But I assert that you have more than once used the above
&gt; boilerplate and that I have challenged you to produce some argument
for
&gt; Oxford that was not could/shoulda/woulda. You never have.

&gt; If you have, you can be the one to produce evidence.

&gt;&gt; I have said often, and recently, that none of us refutes the power
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; magnitude of dealing with the Folio and Monument attribution. It
just
&gt;&gt; is not the end all and be all of the discussion, or exploration,
&gt; which
&gt;&gt; I've tried to indicate here might have important other facets
besides
&gt;&gt;&quot;who did it&quot;.

&gt;&gt; I admit these two , primarily in and of themselves, constitute and
&gt; have
&gt;&gt; been the foundation for the orthodox attribution. Our problem,
along
&gt;&gt; with many, as we've discussed thoudsands of times is the perceived
&gt; gap
&gt;&gt; between the life and CPLE and that attribution.

&gt;&gt; As Tom has demonstrated aptly above, no one, even the best Strat
&gt;&gt; scholars, has a clue as to any relationshop between life and work.
To
&gt;&gt; you, and Dave has said this openly, the attribution gives one
license
&gt;&gt; to follow all these ludicrous flights of fancy.

&gt; I doubt very much that Dave has said anything of the sort, and I
&gt; certainly have never done so.

&gt;&gt; I disagree and while admitting to the formidable nature of the
Folio
&gt;&gt; evidence, I find it hypocrital in the greatest degree to not
&gt;&gt; acknowledge there is an authorship problem with the biography. That
&gt; has
&gt;&gt; been my complaint from the beginning.

&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt; It can't be hypocritical with me, a person who honestly sees no
&gt; discrepancy between what we know of Will Shakespeare and the plays

&quot;If by &quot;making now&quot;, you mean &quot;on this thread&quot;, I can find only one
contention that I have made about William Shakespeare of Stratford,
viz., that he was a prominent theatrical figure. That contention is
documented by records showing him to have been a principal member of
the Lord Chamberlain's and King's Men, a part-owner of the Globe and
Blackfriars Theaters, and an actor listed in the cast lists of plays by

Jonson and &quot;Shakespeare&quot; (whoever that was)&quot;

Thank you. You helped make my point. You cited three kinds of evidence,
none of which point to the man as a *writer* &quot;prominent&quot; in the
theatrical field. Your context was how the letter got to him as writer.
This is the modus operendi of Strat biographers. But there's no
evidentiary chain here. Because there isn't for Oxford or anyone else
doesn't change the fact that you don't have one either.

The Strat assunption is because the Folio says so, there must be a
link, even though none ever surfaces during the man's life.

Lynne's essay claims that many of these assumptions such as the Tempest
letter, are based on poor scholarship and are part of attempts to
shoehorn the facts into the biography. That's one reason why people
question it.

I found your answer to be particularly wanting and very much in the
current vein of &quot;imagination&quot;. Yes you can criticize us all you want
that we are ALL imagination and tsk tsk the terrible irony. I have no
problem with that. What I DO have a problem with is the same problems
that you deny within your own house. Its that simple.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coincidence to any great degree, nor does it explain the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other rare-word parallels.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The OED has separate entries for &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky,&quot; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; seems to regards them as different words, not as different
&gt;&gt;&gt; spellings of the same word.

&gt;&gt; The OED's first definition of 'busky' is &quot;Bosky, bushy'.
&gt;&gt; The OED's first definition of 'bosky' is &quot;Consisting of or
&gt;&gt; covered with bushes or underwood; full of thickets, bushy.&quot;
&gt;&gt; No axe to grind here, of course, Terry, but does it really?

&gt;Peter, the OED does not give separate entries to the various spellings of
&gt;the word &quot;year&quot; and treat them as different words.

&gt;I think Lynne's claim is (or used to be) that &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; were the
&gt;same word -- not similar words, not related words, not neighbors or
&gt;friends, not even twins, but one and the same word. The OED does not
&gt;agree. If the OED considered them merely different spellings of the same
&gt;word, then the words would not have separate entries.

&gt;The words &quot;bushy&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; may have meant pretty much the
&gt;same thing, and may well be related, but the OED gives them separate
&gt;entries (as there are separate entries for &quot;bosk,&quot;&quot;bush,&quot; and &quot;busk&quot;).
&gt;Shakespeare never uses &quot;bushy,&quot; but we do have single instances of &quot;busky&quot;
&gt;and &quot;bosky.&quot; Spenser, on the other hand uses &quot;bushy&quot; but not &quot;bosky&quot; or
&gt;&quot;busky.&quot;

&gt;Poets are not always careless in the their word choices. When Milton uses
&gt;&quot;bosky&quot; rather than &quot;bushy&quot; in *Comus* the word seems to be a deliberate
&gt;rusticism by Comus, who is pretending to be a shepherd:

&gt; I know each lane, and every alley green
&gt; Dingle or bushy dell of this wilde Wood,
&gt; And every bosky bourn from side to side
&gt; My daily walks and ancient neighbourhood,

&gt;In *the Tempest*, &quot;bosky&quot; is used by Ceres, who is given a pastoral
&gt;introduction by Iris. Ceres replies,

&gt; Haile, many-coloured Messenger, that nere
&gt; Do'st disobey the wife of Iupiter:
&gt; Who, with thy saffron wings, vpon my flowres
&gt; Diffusest hony drops, refreshing showres,
&gt; And with each end of thy blew bowe do'st crowne
&gt; My boskie acres, and my vnshrubd downe,
&gt; Rich scarph to my proud earth: why hath thy Queene
&gt; Summond me hither, to this short gras'd Greene?

&gt;&quot;Busky&quot; is used by Henry 4 in *1H4*, in a somewhat less pastoral mood:

&gt; How bloodily the Sunne begins to peere
&gt; Aboue yon busky hill: the day lookes pale
&gt; At his distemperature.

&gt;The OED missed Strachey's use of &quot;bosk&quot; in *The True Repertory*, or we
&gt;would not read that the word is &quot;not recorded between 14th and 19th c.,&quot;
&gt;and there may well be other post-14th-Century instances the OED missed.

&gt;The OED says that &quot;bosk and busk are still used dialectally for BUSH; but
&gt;the modern literary word [i.e., 'bosk' meaning 'thicket'] may have been
&gt;evolved from BOSKY.&quot; That's an interesting thought: &quot;Bosk&quot; disappeared
&gt;from the standard language, but Ceres's &quot;bosky acres&quot; and Comus's &quot;bosky
&gt;bourn&quot; may have given birth to a new back-formation.

&gt;Were &quot;busky&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; identical for Shakespeare? Lynne is sure that
&gt;they were; I am not.

"/>

Perhaps it is worth mentioning that 'busky', 'bosky' and
'bushy' are all etymologicaly the same word. Onions in his
Concise Etymological traces them all back to a (reconstructed)
old German word 'busk-', with the U pronounced long.

I agree that they *would* have heard the differences, even on &quot;busky/bosky&quot;.
My point was that they would have thought of &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; as two
different (perhaps, as Lynne suggests, regional) pronunciations of the same
word.

The newest versions of 1H4 use &quot;bulky&quot;, and I don't dispute this, really - I
bow to superior authority. My comment was that I would not be surprised to
hear evidence that Q2 contained authorial corrections since &quot;bosky&quot; seems
the better choice to me on aesthetic grounds. Perhaps it sounded better to
the compositor of Q2, as well :) I am not as strong on this as Lynne - I
don't think &quot;bulky&quot; is a dreadful choice - but I think busky is preferable.
Your point on &quot;above&quot; versus &quot;through&quot; is noted, however.

I should point out tht both the Yale and New Shakespeare editions choose
&quot;busky&quot;. These are not &quot;new&quot;, but they are authoritative, I believe. I
presume this is on the basis of the Folio. According to David Scott Kasten
(Arden 3 edition, which uses &quot;bulky&quot;) the F1 was set from Q5 but clearly had
some editorial attention from Heminges or Condell. F1 contains many
corrections, and adds many features that seem to come from a playhouse
manuscript. At the same time, it fails to correct many assumed errors. In
any case, it does not correct &quot;busky&quot; to &quot;bulky&quot;. &quot;Modern&quot; editors seem to
work from Q1 (and the fragmentary Q0, as Kasten notes).

My copy of Schmidt is out on loan, but the Crystals in Shakespeare's Words
recognize bosky and busky as separate words, and do not have an entry for
bulky. Folio influence again, I assume.

It is certainly incumbant on Lynne to take note of the diverse word choices,
but I think she's justified in noting the &quot;busky/bosky&quot; connection with that
caveat.

Admittedly, part of bosky's charm to the modern actor (well, THIS modern
actor, anyway) is its very foreign-ness. I too have experienced disturbing
rewrites of difficult passages. Imagine my horror at hearing Malvolio
exclaim &quot;Daylight and open country discover not more&quot;. Even in hidebound
old Stratford, Ontario, they chose modern equivalents for some words in last
year's Midsummer. My instinct is to use the exotic word and clarify its
meaning through voice and gesture, and I think many modern interpreters of
Shakespeare are overly concerned with the audience not recognizing archaic
words.

And, by the way, of course I respond to the spelling and pronunciation of
Shakespeare's words. If I encountered bosky and busky in the same passage,
I would probably go out of my way to clarify the divergent pronunciation.

Not sure if your comment elsewhere on the &quot;cripsness&quot; of the sibilant was
intended to be sarcastic, but it is the combined &quot;sk&quot; of &quot;bosky/busky&quot; sound
which is crisper in sound than the &quot;lk&quot; of &quot;bulky&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Terry, this is actually quite interesting. I'm sure a theatre-goer would
&gt;&gt; have been able to distinguish that &quot;bushy&quot; and &quot;bosky&quot; were different
&gt;&gt; words with the same meaning;

&gt; Different words with somewhat different (but related) meanings. In any
&gt; event, the point is a distraction from the double falsehood of your claim
&gt; that

&gt; Dave and other traditionalists are mistaken and &quot;bosky&quot;
&gt; appears elsewhere in the canon, in a much earlier play.
&gt; I came on it by accident, which is how I make most
&gt; of my discoveries. :(

&gt; The word &quot;bulky&quot; (which I don't think the hearers of Shakespeare's day
&gt; would have confused with &quot;bushy&quot; or &quot;bosky&quot; or &quot;busky&quot;) appears in the
&gt; first quarto of 1H4. In the printing of the word, the &quot;l&quot; in &quot;bulky&quot; was
&gt; quite faint, and it is quite likely that when Q2 was set up for Q1, an &quot;s&quot;
&gt; was substituted for the &quot;l&quot; by mistake. Each successive quarto departs
&gt; further from the one thought to be closest to Shakespeare's text, and the
&gt; First Folio is even further removed. Q1 of 1H4 is not considered a &quot;bad
&gt; quarto,&quot; and modern editors use it as the copy text for the play. They do
&gt; not regard the change from &quot;bulky&quot; to &quot;busky&quot; as authorial. If you DO
&gt; wish to regard the change as authorial, then I look forward to your
&gt; argument in favor of Shakespeare's correcting the Q1 text. Until then,
&gt; let us agree with the modern editors that the word in 1H4 was &quot;bulky.&quot;

&gt; Until we see that argument, though, it might be just as well for you to
&gt; withdraw your false claim that Dave and the other &quot;traditionalists&quot; are
&gt; wrong to cite *The Tempest* as the location of Shakespeare's first use of
&gt;&quot;bosky.&quot;

&gt; Oh yes; at that point (if you ever reach that point) the
&gt;&quot;bosky/bushy/busky&quot; business could come back to haunt us, and you would
&gt; then need to tell us why the OED is wrong to treat &quot;bosky,&quot;&quot;busky,&quot; and
&gt;&quot;busky,&quot; as three different main words.

&gt;&gt; however, I'm not so sure that they would have recognised the difference
&gt;&gt; between &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky,&quot; especially when we take into account
&gt;&gt; different accents and dialects, which I assume were much stronger at the
&gt;&gt; time.

&gt; That is an interesting question (although it has no bearing on your
&gt; erroneous claim). How would you go about investigating such a point?

&gt; One approach (which would not settle the issue but which might shed some
&gt; light) is to look at other pairs of words that one can find in the
&gt; literature of the day that varied only in the vowel sounds we find in
&gt;&quot;busky&quot; and &quot;bosky.&quot; What about &quot;mock&quot; and &quot;muck,&quot; another pair of words
&gt; that vary only in those vowels. Do you think either readers or members of
&gt; the audience were unable to hear the difference?

&gt; Our spoyles he kickt at,
&gt; And look'd vpon things precious, as they were
&gt; The common Muck of the World: he couets lesse
&gt; Then Miserie it selfe would giue, rewards his deeds
&gt; With doing them, and is content
&gt; To spend the time, to end it.

&gt; But I will rise there with so full a glorie,
&gt; That I will dazle all the eyes of France,
&gt; Yea strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs,
&gt; And tell the pleasant Prince, this Mocke of his
&gt; Hath turn'd his balles to Gun-stones, and his soule
&gt; Shall stand sore charged, for the wastefull vengeance
&gt; That shall flye with them:

&gt; What about &quot;duck&quot; and &quot;dock&quot;?

&gt; Tri. Swom ashore (man) like a Ducke: I can swim
&gt; like a Ducke i'le be sworne.

&gt; Ant. Hee'd sow't vvith Nettle-seed.
&gt; Seb. Or dockes, or Mallowes.

&gt; Do you think readers or listeners of the time would have been unable to
&gt; distinguish such pairs as &quot;stock&quot; and &quot;stuck,&quot;&quot;lock&quot; and &quot;luck,&quot; and so
&gt; on? Of course these pairs are more different in meaning than &quot;bosky&quot; and
&gt;&quot;bushy&quot; and &quot;busky,&quot; but if the word pairs WERE pronounced
&gt; indistinguishably, then we might expect to find Shakespeare (or other
&gt; poets of the time) rhyming &quot;uck&quot; words with &quot;ock&quot; words. Do you think
&gt; there were many such rhymes? Can you give us a few examples?

&gt; We also might expect &quot;-ock/-uck&quot; word puns such as the &quot;Rome/room&quot; bit in
&gt; *Julius Caesar* -- a pun that does not work today, but that did work when
&gt;&quot;Rome&quot; and &quot;room&quot; were homonyms.

&gt; So are &quot;duck&quot; and &quot;dock&quot; homonyms in Shakespeare? Were they words that
&gt; Shakespeare thought rhymed? Were they so close in sound and so likely to
&gt; be confused that he punned one against the other? If so, then perhaps
&gt;&quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; would have been homonyms for him, if Shakespeare had
&gt; ever come across the latter word.

&gt;&gt; Even today, the u in &quot;busky&quot; would we pronounced like the u in &quot;mutt&quot; to
&gt;&gt; Southerners in England, but would be closer to the u in &quot;put&quot; to
&gt;&gt; Northerners, or even the o in &quot;bosky&quot; or somewhere in between. It would
&gt;&gt; take an expert on dialect to let us know whether this was so during the
&gt;&gt; Elizabethan era, and even then I fear his or her opinion would to some
&gt;&gt; extent involve guesswork.

&gt; Dialectically different groups of speakers may have somewhat different
&gt; sets of vowel sounds, but the two sounds in question do not appear to have
&gt; been identical in Shakespeare's works, and even when Shakespeare writes in
&gt; dialect, I don't think he makes &quot;-uck/-ock&quot; confusion a part of the
&gt; procedure.

&gt; I grew up speaking an accent in which &quot;Mary,&quot;&quot;marry,&quot; and &quot;merry&quot; were
&gt; perfect homonyms, and it was startling at first to listen to people who
&gt; distinguished the vowels in those words. Alan J. Lerner seems to have
&gt; thought &quot;rather&quot; would rhyme with &quot;bother&quot; in Freddie Eynsford-Hill's
&gt; accent. I have known people who pronounced &quot;milk&quot; as &quot;melk.&quot; This does
&gt; not mean that all vowels are interchangeable, or even that every set of
&gt; variations we come across today in regional accents or dialects must have
&gt; had its correspondence in Shakespeare's writings.

&gt; Even if we cannot say with precision which particular modern sound
&gt; Shakespeare himself would have uttered, we can at least get a pretty good
&gt; idea of which ones sounded close enough for him to rhyme.

&gt; If Shakespeare rhymed &quot;pluck with &quot;luck&quot; but not with &quot;clock&quot; or &quot;dock&quot;,
&gt; if Shakespeare rhymed &quot;not&quot; with &quot;blot&quot; and &quot;got&quot; and &quot;plot&quot; but not with
&gt;&quot;gut&quot;; -- if Shakespeare consistently rhymed words that had the vowel of
&gt;&quot;bosk&quot; with other similarly vowelled words while rhyming 'busk'-vowelled
&gt; words with each other (but did not consistently mix the rhyme words from
&gt; the different sets), then we may be reasonably confident that he would not
&gt; have pronounced &quot;bosky&quot; and &quot;busky&quot; alike even if he had known the latter
&gt; word.

&gt;&gt; I hear it the other way with modern Americans. It drives me crazy that
&gt;&gt; Buffalonians, or whatever they're called, pronounce &quot;dollars&quot; as
&gt;&gt;&quot;dullars&quot; when fund-raising on our local PBS station. A friend of

Oxfordians are not &quot;locked out of the peer review process&quot;. They are
free to submit articles to any peer-reviewed journal they choose, just
as anybody else is. Why they choose not to do so is not my concern,
though perhaps it's just as well. Based on the dubious &quot;scholarship&quot; I
have seen in Oxfordian writings, those writings would have a very tough
time indeed passing peer review, since they violate some of the most

How strange that &quot;a highly energized messianic movement&quot; hides its
light under a bushel. I've been told, for instance, that Drs. Brame and
Stritmatter have essayed refutations of my less than favorable reviews
of their works - but only in the sanctuary of closed anti-Stratfordian
newsgroups, so that the faithful alone are aware of their vindication.
That bespeaks not a messianic movement but an inbred cult.

You'll note that, in the post that started this thread, a pair of
Oxenfordians are determinedly coy about an allegedly major discovery
for which they claim to have overwhelming evidence. Energized advocates
would be eager to get their story out as quickly and widely as
possible. Sure it will then draw opposition, but aren't they confident
of the strength of their case? Wouldn't they like to get a feel for
what may be said against it, so that their formal presentation will be
as convincing as possible? If they were genuine prosyletizers, they
would. If they would rather grumble among themselves and occasionally
make faces at the oppressive Establishment, that is another matter.

We don't prefer to grumble among ourselves, Tom. We are getting it out as
quickly as possible. Roger is coming to Toronto in June and by then we
should be able to put the essay into its final form. There is also at least
one table that I'm preparing now to go with the essay, although I have at
least six tables that I worked on while working on our presentation. Our
main problem is deciding how to shape the argument so we can cut down the
material. We used perhaps a quarter of it in our powerpoint (apologies,
Greg). And we worked so fast that we have to go back over voluminous sources
and note pages, etc. that I might have missed.

I put something up before we were done because I promised Elizabeth I would
as soon as we'd given our presentation in Portland. I would be glad to show
it all, but that would likely preclude our getting it published when it is
in essay form. And we have already received so much criticism (not here)
from one or two negative people who have never even seen our presentation
that we judge it wiser to show it now to a few people we trust, and get some
genuine feedback before putting our work into its final form. Then, when
it's accepted for publication somewhere, hopefully somewhere mainstream
(pigs might fly), you may all see it and criticise it to your heart's
content.

I wouldn't actually say on reflection that this was a major discovery. I'd
say it was something or some several things that were around all the time,
but their significance was either missed or ignored by Stratfordians in
glasshouses who shouldn't throw stones.

Some messiah! I could pick a better messiah out of a hat -- come to think
of it, perhaps that how Looney actually DID choose Oxford; it's no more
absurd than the creation myth he described.

As for being &quot;highly energized,&quot; the Oxfordians seem to expend a great
deal of their energy in schisms and in attacking fellow Oxfordians whose
views of the nature of that messiah differ from their own (was the queen
his girlfriend? Was she his mum? Was Southampton his sonny boy? DId
Oxford write hundreds of thousands of lines in addition to writing
Shakespeare's works?).

There is also a fair amount of energy fizzled away in self-pity (by the
shores of Babble-on, there we sat, yea we wept when we remembered that our
twaddle was not published in *Shakespeare Quarterly*, nor had it been
submitted).

Then there is the expense of energy in avoiding the name &quot;Shakespeare&quot;
when referring to William Shakespeare -- let him be renamed &quot;William of
Stratford&quot; or &quot;The man from Stratford&quot; or &quot;the Stratman&quot; or &quot;Will-yum&quot;
lest the messiah be offended. A bit of the resulting energy must power
the puny engines that mock William Shakespeare for not being a handsome
earl. Some of the biggest laughter and applause lines from the recent
Portland Oxfordian conference went something like this:

&quot;Have you SEEN the Droeshout? That guy wasn't handsome.

&quot;Have you SEEN the bust in Shakespeare's monument? That guy wasn't
handsome.&quot;

Oh what rib-ticking wit your messiah inspires.

What energy is left? There is enough for some lazy re-Baconizing;
performing search-and-replace operations on the scriptures that honored a
different messiah. There is a enough for cherry-picking, piggy-backing,
and the few other events sanctioned in the messiah's book of games.

At that point the batteries (never very impressive) have been pretty much
drained, and there is no energy whatsoever for scholarship.

For myself, I do not consider Shakespeare a messiah; I do not consider
either his own writings or the writings of genuine critics and scholars to
be gospel. There are interesting historical questions one may ask about
Shakespeare and his works, but making the man a messiah would probably
corrupt the process of trying to answer those questions.

Give it a few years. Then the big issues will be:
(a) how many children Elizabeth had,
(b) who they were,
(c) who their fathers were
(d) how many of her children had sex with their mother, and
(e) who was _their_ offspring
(f) how many expected (or were expected) to succeed to the throne
(g) which of them (or how many of them) were Shakespeare.

Standards in English Literature

When Dan delivered his &quot;Very Interesting&quot; talk several years ago I
asked why he had not submitted it to a publication such as SQ. He said
it would be fruitless for two reasons, both political. The extreme
adversarial stance of the Stratfordian community made it extremely
unlikely that an oppositional, authorship oriented article would be
accepted. Secondly he postulated that the economic issues of
maintaining the subscriber base also mitigated against it.

Here is a recent post from a member of the Shakespeare Fellowship.
Given the Ogburn got similar responses years ago, this kind of hysteria
sheds volumes on why I think Dave is living in a fantasy world.

&quot;My brief experience occurred on some Shakespeare education site
created for the use of students querying experts. I have no literary
nor educational reputation to protect, so I innocently waded in on a
discussion about the &quot;Black Lady.&quot; The usual Stratfordian guesses had
been forwarded and I thought I'd give it a try and introduced the Anne
Vavasour connection. Well, one furious &quot;Bardolph&quot; burned me at the
stake and scolded me with, &quot;This is an educational site. Young students
come here to learn the truth.&quot; Then Bardolph informed me de Vere was a
sorry sort to fantasize as the Bard. &quot;He (de Vere) was an old cripple,
of whom his peers held in contempt.&quot;

I replied, &quot;So the author of &quot;Shakespeare's Sonnets&quot; concurs.&quot;

It was the next day while trying to return to the site, to catch
Bardolph's answer, I found myself barred from the site. I found the
whole thing humorous. Apparently Bardolph and pals just saw me as a
threat to their sanity.

I wonder what anecdotes others may have about their run ins with the
keepers of the faith.&quot;

They are legion.

the

&gt; (g) which of them (or how many of them) were Shakespeare.

I don't doubt that papers on Continental Drift were
unfairly rejected prior to 1967 and surely some were
rejected even after that date. Nevertheless, there are a
fair number of papers and books on the Continental Drift
theory written by prominent professional geologists
that were published a long time before 1967. Arthur
Holmes is perhaps the best known and he started publishing
his pro-drift books and papers way back in 1928. I believe
Alexander du Toit published his first pro-drift book around the
same time. Beno Gutenberg, discoverer of the mantle/core
boundary, published his first pro-drift paper in 1936.
Vening Meinesz was publishing pro-drift work in the 1930s.
Holmes's influential _Principles of Geology_, first published
in 1944, contained a chapter on Continental Drift. S. A.
Carey organized international symposiums on the theory
in the late 1950s. etc...

If Oxfordianism had followed the same track as Continental
Drift, there would have been quite a few scholarly adherents
in the first decade after Looney's publication. Then the
theory's popularity would have collapsed to the point where
only a few well-regarded scholars still proposed it. For
the next three decades, a few well-regarded scholars would
continue to work on it, gradually persuading more and more
scholars that there was something to the theory and in the 4th
decade, it would quite suddenly become the dominant paradigm.

Needless to say, it seems that Oxfordianism has yet to reach
stage 1. (ie. I know of absolutely no scholars who have
previously established reputations in relevant fields
who have published papers or books favoring of Oxfordianism.)

And now, back to what I get paid for...

Ken, if Christopher Paul's understanding of my point is no better than
yours, then his &quot;80 page essay&quot; would not amount to much, would it?
Still, I have not read the essay, and I have known your reports to be
unreliable in the past, so it would not be fair to judge him (either
favorably or unfavorably) on the basis of your assessment.

Do you even know what the Oxfordians have claimed and still claim
regarding &quot;Minerva&quot; and &quot;spear shaking&quot;? Did Christopher Paul not educate
you on this issue? Do you even know what I have said? Must I educate you
on that as well?

Here, for example, is what Peter Dickson has said:

&quot;In 1612, Peacham published *Minerva Britanna*, a compilation of literary
emblems dedicated to Prince Henry. Minerva is the Roman equivalent for
Athena, the hasti-vibrans (spear-shaking) patron Goddess of Greek
theater.&quot;

What is false about this? Athena was NOT the &quot;patron goddess of Greek
theater&quot; and Athena/Minerva was NOT known as the &quot;hasti-vibrans&quot; anything.
The word &quot;hastivibrans&quot; was in fact invented by Thomas Fuller as a witty
tribute to William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon.

In the April 1999 *Harper's*, Dan Wright said Athena &quot;was known to all and
sundry as 'the spear shaker,'&quot; while Mark Anderson said &quot;Elizabethans knew
that Pallas Athena was known by the sobriquet 'the spear-shaker.'&quot; These
claims are not only false but silly. If &quot;Athena 'was known to all and
sundry as 'the spear shaker,'&quot; then it should be easy to produce a great
heap of such instances. How many has Dan Wright or Mark Anderson (or
Christopher Paul) produced? How many can you produce?

What is the difference between an epithet and being &quot;associated with&quot;?
Let's look at an ACTUAL epithet. Jupiter was called &quot;Tonans&quot; -- &quot;the
Thunderer&quot; -- by Ovid, and the term was used by later writers (including
our old friend Gabriel Harvey in his *Gratulationes Valdinenses*). It
would not be entirely inaccurate to say (if I may borrow Dan Wright's
language) that Jupiter &quot;was known to all and sundry as &quot;the Thunderer.&quot;

Jupiter appears in *Cymbeline*; his entrance is described thus:

Iupiter descends in Thunder and Lightning, sitting vppon an
Eagle: hee throwes a Thunder-bolt. The Ghostes fall on
their knees.

Jupiter knows his own epithet:

How dare you Ghostes
Accuse the Thunderer, whose Bolt (you know)
Sky-planted, batters all rebelling Coasts.

Jupiter is also addressed &quot;thou Thunder-Master&quot; in *Cymbeline*.

In *Antony and Cleopatra* there is the oath, &quot;By Ioue that thunders.&quot;

Lear says,

I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoote,
Nor tell tales of thee to high-iudging Ioue,

Thersites in *Troilus and Cressida*:

O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget
that thou art Ioue the King of gods:

... and so on. Where are the similar passages for Minerva in which
&quot;spear-shaker&quot; is used as an epithet? Where is she addressed as &quot;thou
great spear-shaker of Olympus&quot; as Jupiter is &quot;thou great thunder-darter of
Olympus?&quot; Where is the called &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; as Jupiter is called
&quot;the Thunder-bearer&quot;? Where does she call herself &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; as
Jupiter calls himself &quot;the Thunderer&quot;?

The one (sort-of) epithet for the goddess that we find in Shakespeare is
&quot;straight-pight&quot; in *Cymbeline*; not only is she never called the
&quot;spear-shaker&quot; in Shakespeare, she is never even &quot;associated with&quot; spears
or shaking. Here is a more representative example:

Pericles to Marina:

Prethee speake, falsnesse cannot come from thee,
for thou lookest modest as iustice, &amp; thou seemest a Pallas
for the crownd truth to dwell in;

Minerva/Athena/Pallas is much more strongly &quot;associated with&quot; wisdom than
with spears and spear-shaking. This is not to say that Minerva was never
&quot;associated with&quot; spears -- of course she was, as were a great many other
figures. She was commonly depicted wearing a helmet, holding a spear, and
bearing a shield. She sometimes shook her shield and on occasion shook
her spear (although no more frequently than, say, Mars) -- but she did not
bear the epithet &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; as Jupiter did &quot;the Thunderer.&quot;

What has happened (perhaps to some extent as a result of my pointing out
the true history of &quot;hastivibrans&quot; to Oxfordians who were too lazy to
investigate the matter for themselves) is NOT that the false claim has
been withdrawn, but that it has been watered down.

Instead of saying that &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; was Minerva's common sobriquet
or epithet (which is false), Oxfordians now say that she was sometimes
&quot;associated with&quot; spear shaking, which is sort of true -- I say &quot;sort of,&quot;
because Minerva was one of a great many figures who from time to time
shook a spear and thus were &quot;associated with spear shaking,&quot; but it is
false to say that &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; was an epithet for Minerva the way
&quot;the thunderer&quot; was for Jupiter, and it would be misleading to ignore all
the other figures who were also &quot;associated with&quot; spears or spear-shaking
in the way Minerva sometimes was.

Ovid could call Jove &quot;Tonans&quot; and without his otherwise referring to the
god, readers knew who he meant. Athena/Minerva had a great many common
epithets, but &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; was not one of them. Although many
Oxfordians (and Baconians before them; this bit is one more thing the
Oxfordians have stolen from their models) have asserted that
&quot;hastivibrans&quot; was an epithet of Minerva, that claim is false.

Here is a page containing many English references to &quot;spear shaking&quot;
through 1640; I have more examples that could be added, and perhaps
Christopher Paul has found others as well:

Anyone who looks at these examples will see that a great many figures have
been &quot;associated with&quot; spear shaking. Minerva is one of them, but she is
only one of a great many figures who from time to time shakes things.
Aeneas is another. Mars is another. The army of Brute shook spears, as
should the Scots, as did the heavenly host. Rinald shook a spear.
Spears were shaken against Sidney. Bauld Bacleuch could shake a spear.
What is not true is that Minerva went by the sobriquet &quot;the spear-shaker.&quot;

Is this so difficult to understand?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; An excellent piece. Pray tell sir, with the authorship issue defacto
&gt; regulated to the staus of &quot;creationism&quot; (Alan Nelson's words in the New
&gt; York Times&quot;) and refused to be acknowledged as a subject worthy of study
&gt; in Stratford land, where would such an essay find a home?

"/>

Who would trust a creationist's review of a creationist essay? If
Christopher Paul thinks has an original contribution to make, let him
submit it to serious and qualified readers. If his only readers are
Oxfordians, then he is taking the easy way out -- and if he actually DID
have something new and true to say, he would be wasting his work on such
readers.

Did Christopher Paul in his &quot;excellent piece&quot; look at other figures who
were &quot;associated with&quot; spears and spear shaking? If he did not, then he
probably failed in his task (as you describe it -- I have not seen the
essay; it it may be that you are not doing him justice, and that I am
naive to trust your account).

Of course there is nothing much at stake regarding the question whether in
English literature Athena/Minerva bore the epithet &quot;spear shaker&quot; as Jove
was &quot;the Thunderer&quot;; this bit is part of an attempt to prop up a larger
argument.

The underlying argument goes something like this (there are false
statements in what follows, but the point here is not the validity of them
but the nature of the &quot;argument&quot;):

1. &quot;Shakespeare&quot; was an obvious pseudonym; a reference to Minerva (the
goddess of the theater) under her common epithet &quot;hastivibrans.&quot;

2. There is a passage or two where Oxford's name appears in rather close
to the name &quot;Minerva&quot; (or &quot;Athena&quot; or &quot;Pallas&quot;).

3. There is a passage or two where Oxford's name appears in
proximity to the word &quot;spear&quot; or a reasonable synonym.

4. There is a passage or two where Oxford's name appears in the
neighborhood of the word &quot;shake&quot; or a reasonable synonym.

THEREFORE Oxford was known as &quot;Shakespeare&quot; (or therefore Oxford chose the
name &quot;Shakespeare&quot; to honor his own &quot;associations&quot; Minerva and spears).

What's wrong with this? Some things I have already pointed out (e.g.,
Minerva was NOT the goddess of theater; Minerva was NOT known as
&quot;hastivibrans&quot;; the word &quot;hastivibrans&quot; was coined as a 17th-Century
tribute to William Shakespeare of Stratford on Avon by Thomas Fuller;
there are other Elizabethans who were more pointedly &quot;associated with&quot;
spears or spear-shaking than Oxford; there were other Elizabethans who
were more closely &quot;associated with&quot; Minerva than Oxford; Oxfordians have
overstated the strength of the &quot;associations&quot; they refer to; even though
an Oxfordian periodical was called *the Spear Shaker Review*, there is no
reason to believe that Oxford himself was ever called by anybody &quot;the spear
shaker.&quot;

It's not necessary, and certainly not as strange as Stratman +
illiterate daughters = the &quot;soul of the age.&quot; Or Stratman + title pages

&gt;&gt;&gt; They'd have as much chance of being published
&gt;&gt;&gt; as a paper in support of 'Continental Drift' would
&gt;&gt;&gt; have been before 1967.

&gt;&gt; I don't doubt that papers on Continental Drift were
&gt;&gt; unfairly rejected prior to 1967 and surely some were
&gt;&gt; rejected even after that date. Nevertheless, there are a
&gt;&gt; fair number of papers and books on the Continental Drift
&gt;&gt; theory written by prominent professional geologists
&gt;&gt; that were published a long time before 1967. Arthur
&gt;&gt; Holmes is perhaps the best known and he started publishing
&gt;&gt; his pro-drift books and papers way back in 1928. I believe
&gt;&gt; Alexander du Toit published his first pro-drift book around the
&gt;&gt; same time. Beno Gutenberg, discoverer of the mantle/core
&gt;&gt; boundary, published his first pro-drift paper in 1936.
&gt;&gt; Vening Meinesz was publishing pro-drift work in the 1930s.
&gt;&gt; Holmes's influential _Principles of Geology_, first published
&gt;&gt; in 1944, contained a chapter on Continental Drift. S. A.
&gt;&gt; Carey organized international symposiums on the theory
&gt;&gt; in the late 1950s. etc...

&gt;&gt; If Oxfordianism had followed the same track as Continental
&gt;&gt; Drift,

&gt; These are only rough comparisons -- closer
&gt; to analogies. Continental Drift (like most such
&gt; examples) is in the Sciences, where there is
&gt; usually a mass of data, rarely available to, or
&gt; even understandable by, educated laymen.

Today, most educated laymen can't read Latin very
well. Most will have trouble reading a document in
the Secretary script. They will not have a broad
acquaintance with the literature. Probably their
understanding of the history will be on a similar
level. They won't know what is unique. They won't
know what is commonplace. They won't know what is
an idiom. In short, their initial impression of
what's in a contemporary document is likely not very
close to what is really in there. Perhaps the worst
thing is that they won't know enough to be able to
accurately evaluate their own level of understanding.
Having no benchmark for understanding what it takes
but themselves, they may imagine themselves reasonably
competent when they are anything but.

Ideal or not, Wegner's theory followed
roughly that path after it gained the notice
of the professionals. Most dismissed it outright.
As for the rest, after Jeffries(1929) and others
pointed out rather brutally that Wegner's proposed
mechanism was not only a million times too weak
to account for the movement but that the continents
would have been shattered by the force necessary
to move them in that fashion, well, they mostly
stopped thinking about Wegner. That situation
changed very very gradually until the 1950s when the
theory began to get some mainstream momentum. (Not
so much in the USA and from what I've read, not at
all in Germany.) By the early 1960s, supporters
were still very much in the minority, but they
were far from rare. And of course, we all know what
happened in the late 1960s.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; For
&gt;&gt; the next three decades, a few well-regarded scholars would
&gt;&gt; continue to work on it, gradually persuading more and more

&gt;&gt; decade, it would quite suddenly become the dominant paradigm.

&gt; Sure, sure. That's the kind of bedtime
&gt; story your parents told you.

"/>

It'd have been a bedtime story along the lines of _The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions_, but sadly, no, my
parents did not scoop Kuhn.

Guess who this was written for:

--- extracted from an old post ---

You claim that amateurs were responsible for the success of the
Copernican revolution and that Kuhn supports you in that claim.

Kuhn in his _The Copernicus Revolution_:

page 118:

&quot;Therefore, if the decision between the Copernican and the traditional
universe had concerned only astronomers, Copernicus' proposal would
almost have certainly achieved a quiet and gradual victory.&quot;

You claim that after Galileo's invention of the telescope, that amateur
astronomers were instrumental in getting the professionals to accept
Copernicanism.

page 220:
&quot;Coming when it did, Galileo's astronomical work contributed primarily
to a mopping-up operation, conducted after the victory was clearly in
sight.&quot;

page 222:
&quot;For the astronomically initiate the evidence of the telescope was,
perhaps, superflous.&quot;

The conclusion can only be that Kuhn did not see the amateur astronomers
necessary or important in the conversion of professional astronomers
to Copernicanism. In fact, most who trouble themselves to read Kuhn's
_The Copernican Revolution_ will rightly come away with the idea that
amateurish preconceptions delayed the popular acceptance of the theory
to a time more than a century after the majority of the professionals
had accepted it.

Yep, you guessed it. It was written for you.

the view of the 'qualified experts'.

However, in some disciplines and some
topics, a few laymen will take an interest
and will build up a level of expertise.
Their opinions will often carry much
greater weight than those of the
professionals, since they are likely to
be much more objective. Everyone
appreciates how it would, nearly always,
be professional suicide for, say, a junior
lecturer in English Literature to express
anti-Stratfordian opinions -- in much the

Few professionals and even fewer laymen
will acquire the skills you describe. But
how often are they relevant? The issues
under debate usually go far beyond them.
Revolutions in science (e.g. the Copernican,
the Plate Tectonics, the Dinosaur Extinction)
are not decided by detail. In many cases,
detail is a distraction from the issues. How
often is such detail discussed here? How
often is it relevant? Is any detail going to
tell us whether or not the name &quot;Will Shake-
speare&quot; like to be one contrived by an
Elizabethan poet? Too often those on
BOTH sides get lost in the detail, and fail
to see the wood for the trees. Terry Ross
is a perfect example of an academic who
long ago lost all capacity for seeing woods,
-- even if he may be able to compare the
spores of species of fungus that grow on
some leaves of some trees that might grow
in woods.

will go back and gather all the tiny items
of 'progress' into a list that might seem

of context. There is much progress; but
it is all outside the realm of academe.
There was much steady progress as
regards Continental Drift in the 1950s and

We DON'T know what happened in the

direction. It was entirely unpredictable,
and as hard to explain as a sudden turn
in a shoal of fish. It was also strangely
silent. When the Open University (in the
UK) sought for a book on the topic in
1971 they could not find a single one,
and had to write their own, almost from
scratch.

Likewise, it is quite impossible to forecast
when the Oxfordian revolution will occur,
or the manner in which it will take place.
One day everyone will wake up realising
that it has happened -- but they won't be
able to say exactly when, why or how.
There may be a period of 'silence' within
the profession, as took place in Geology
on Continental Drift. Or there may be a
huge and unholy row. But whichever
way it happens, there will certainly be
casualties.

rebutting
&gt;&gt; Terry Ross' submission that the association between Minerva, the
Spear,
&gt;&gt; and &quot;Spear Shaking&quot; was not real intllectual currency in
Elizabethan
&gt;&gt; times.

&gt; Ken, if Christopher Paul's understanding of my point is no better
than
&gt; yours, then his &quot;80 page essay&quot; would not amount to much, would it?
&gt; Still, I have not read the essay, and I have known your reports to be
&gt; unreliable in the past, so it would not be fair to judge him (either
&gt; favorably or unfavorably) on the basis of your assessment.

&gt; Do you even know what the Oxfordians have claimed and still claim
&gt; regarding &quot;Minerva&quot; and &quot;spear shaking&quot;? Did Christopher Paul not
educate
&gt; you on this issue? Do you even know what I have said? Must I
educate you
&gt; on that as well?

&gt; Here, for example, is what Peter Dickson has said:

&gt;&quot;In 1612, Peacham published *Minerva Britanna*, a compilation of
literary
&gt; emblems dedicated to Prince Henry. Minerva is the Roman equivalent
for
&gt; Athena, the hasti-vibrans (spear-shaking) patron Goddess of Greek
&gt; theater.&quot;

&gt; What is false about this? Athena was NOT the &quot;patron goddess of
Greek
&gt; theater&quot; and Athena/Minerva was NOT known as the &quot;hasti-vibrans&quot;
anything.
&gt; The word &quot;hastivibrans&quot; was in fact invented by Thomas Fuller as a
witty
&gt; tribute to William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon.

&gt; In the April 1999 *Harper's*, Dan Wright said Athena &quot;was known to
all and
&gt; sundry as 'the spear shaker,'&quot; while Mark Anderson said &quot;Elizabethans
knew
&gt; that Pallas Athena was known by the sobriquet 'the spear-shaker.'&quot;
These
&gt; claims are not only false but silly. If &quot;Athena 'was known to all
and
&gt; sundry as 'the spear shaker,'&quot; then it should be easy to produce a
great
&gt; heap of such instances. How many has Dan Wright or Mark Anderson (or
&gt; Christopher Paul) produced? How many can you produce?

&gt; What is the difference between an epithet and being &quot;associated
with&quot;?
&gt; Let's look at an ACTUAL epithet. Jupiter was called &quot;Tonans&quot; -- &quot;the
&gt; Thunderer&quot; -- by Ovid, and the term was used by later writers
(including
&gt; our old friend Gabriel Harvey in his *Gratulationes Valdinenses*).
It
&gt; would not be entirely inaccurate to say (if I may borrow Dan Wright's
&gt; language) that Jupiter &quot;was known to all and sundry as &quot;the
Thunderer.&quot;

&gt; Jupiter appears in *Cymbeline*; his entrance is described thus:

&gt; Iupiter descends in Thunder and Lightning, sitting vppon an
&gt; Eagle: hee throwes a Thunder-bolt. The Ghostes fall on
&gt; their knees.

&gt; Jupiter knows his own epithet:

&gt; How dare you Ghostes
&gt; Accuse the Thunderer, whose Bolt (you know)
&gt; Sky-planted, batters all rebelling Coasts.

&gt; Jupiter is also addressed &quot;thou Thunder-Master&quot; in *Cymbeline*.

&gt; In *Antony and Cleopatra* there is the oath, &quot;By Ioue that thunders.&quot;

&gt; Lear says,

&gt; I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoote,
&gt; Nor tell tales of thee to high-iudging Ioue,

&gt; Thersites in *Troilus and Cressida*:

&gt; O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget
&gt; that thou art Ioue the King of gods:

&gt; ... and so on. Where are the similar passages for Minerva in which
&gt;&quot;spear-shaker&quot; is used as an epithet? Where is she addressed as
&quot;thou
&gt; great spear-shaker of Olympus&quot; as Jupiter is &quot;thou great
thunder-darter of
&gt; Olympus?&quot; Where is the called &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; as Jupiter is
called
&gt;&quot;the Thunder-bearer&quot;? Where does she call herself &quot;the spear-shaker&quot;
as
&gt; Jupiter calls himself &quot;the Thunderer&quot;?

&gt; The one (sort-of) epithet for the goddess that we find in Shakespeare
is
&gt;&quot;straight-pight&quot; in *Cymbeline*; not only is she never called the
&gt;&quot;spear-shaker&quot; in Shakespeare, she is never even &quot;associated with&quot;
spears
&gt; or shaking. Here is a more representative example:

&gt; Pericles to Marina:

&gt; Prethee speake, falsnesse cannot come from thee,
&gt; for thou lookest modest as iustice, &amp; thou seemest a Pallas
&gt; for the crownd truth to dwell in;

&gt; Minerva/Athena/Pallas is much more strongly &quot;associated with&quot; wisdom
than
&gt; with spears and spear-shaking. This is not to say that Minerva was
never
&gt;&quot;associated with&quot; spears -- of course she was, as were a great many
other
&gt; figures. She was commonly depicted wearing a helmet, holding a
spear, and
&gt; bearing a shield. She sometimes shook her shield and on occasion
shook
&gt; her spear (although no more frequently than, say, Mars) -- but she
did not
&gt; bear the epithet &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; as Jupiter did &quot;the Thunderer.&quot;

&gt; What has happened (perhaps to some extent as a result of my pointing
out
&gt; the true history of &quot;hastivibrans&quot; to Oxfordians who were too lazy to
&gt; investigate the matter for themselves) is NOT that the false claim
has
&gt; been withdrawn, but that it has been watered down.

&gt; Instead of saying that &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; was Minerva's common
sobriquet
&gt; or epithet (which is false), Oxfordians now say that she was
sometimes
&gt;&quot;associated with&quot; spear shaking, which is sort of true -- I say &quot;sort
of,&quot;
&gt; because Minerva was one of a great many figures who from time to time
&gt; shook a spear and thus were &quot;associated with spear shaking,&quot; but it
is
&gt; false to say that &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; was an epithet for Minerva the
way
&gt;&quot;the thunderer&quot; was for Jupiter, and it would be misleading to ignore
all
&gt; the other figures who were also &quot;associated with&quot; spears or
spear-shaking
&gt; in the way Minerva sometimes was.

&gt; Ovid could call Jove &quot;Tonans&quot; and without his otherwise referring to
the
&gt; god, readers knew who he meant. Athena/Minerva had a great many
common
&gt; epithets, but &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; was not one of them. Although many
&gt; Oxfordians (and Baconians before them; this bit is one more thing the
&gt; Oxfordians have stolen from their models) have asserted that
&gt;&quot;hastivibrans&quot; was an epithet of Minerva, that claim is false.

&gt; Here is a page containing many English references to &quot;spear shaking&quot;
&gt; through 1640; I have more examples that could be added, and perhaps
&gt; Christopher Paul has found others as well:

&gt; http://shakespeareauthorship.com/spershak.html

&gt; Anyone who looks at these examples will see that a great many figures
have
&gt; been &quot;associated with&quot; spear shaking. Minerva is one of them, but
she is
&gt; only one of a great many figures who from time to time shakes things.
&gt; Aeneas is another. Mars is another. The army of Brute shook spears,
as
&gt; should the Scots, as did the heavenly host. Rinald shook a spear.
&gt; Spears were shaken against Sidney. Bauld Bacleuch could shake a
spear.
&gt; What is not true is that Minerva went by the sobriquet &quot;the
spear-shaker.&quot;

&gt; Is this so difficult to understand?

&gt;&gt; An excellent piece. Pray tell sir, with the authorship issue
defacto
&gt;&gt; regulated to the staus of &quot;creationism&quot; (Alan Nelson's words in the
New
&gt;&gt; York Times&quot;) and refused to be acknowledged as a subject worthy of
study
&gt;&gt; in Stratford land, where would such an essay find a home?

&gt; Who would trust a creationist's review of a creationist essay? If
&gt; Christopher Paul thinks has an original contribution to make, let him
&gt; submit it to serious and qualified readers. If his only readers are
&gt; Oxfordians, then he is taking the easy way out -- and if he actually
DID
&gt; have something new and true to say, he would be wasting his work on
such
&gt; readers.

&gt; Did Christopher Paul in his &quot;excellent piece&quot; look at other figures
who
&gt; were &quot;associated with&quot; spears and spear shaking? If he did not, then
he
&gt; probably failed in his task (as you describe it -- I have not seen
the
&gt; essay; it it may be that you are not doing him justice, and that I am
&gt; naive to trust your account).

&gt; Of course there is nothing much at stake regarding the question
whether in
&gt; English literature Athena/Minerva bore the epithet &quot;spear shaker&quot; as
Jove
&gt; was &quot;the Thunderer&quot;; this bit is part of an attempt to prop up a
larger
&gt; argument.

&gt; The underlying argument goes something like this (there are false
&gt; statements in what follows, but the point here is not the validity of
them
&gt; but the nature of the &quot;argument&quot;):

&gt; 1. &quot;Shakespeare&quot; was an obvious pseudonym; a reference to Minerva
(the
&gt; goddess of the theater) under her common epithet &quot;hastivibrans.&quot;

&gt; 2. There is a passage or two where Oxford's name appears in rather
close
&gt; to the name &quot;Minerva&quot; (or &quot;Athena&quot; or &quot;Pallas&quot;).

&gt; 3. There is a passage or two where Oxford's name appears in
&gt; proximity to the word &quot;spear&quot; or a reasonable synonym.

&gt; 4. There is a passage or two where Oxford's name appears in the
&gt; neighborhood of the word &quot;shake&quot; or a reasonable synonym.

&gt; THEREFORE Oxford was known as &quot;Shakespeare&quot; (or therefore Oxford
chose the
&gt; name &quot;Shakespeare&quot; to honor his own &quot;associations&quot; Minerva and
spears).

&gt; What's wrong with this? Some things I have already pointed out
(e.g.,

This is interesting - 'professionals' of what?

Acceptance of Copernicus was not a mopping-up summary for astronomers, but a
socio-religious battle which he lost to the Roman Church!

A subsidiary point is that telescopes allowed observations to be made, but
the import of the observation was to physics then philosophy. It was in fact
Kepler who utilised stellar observations of Tycho de Brae &amp; Others, to
establish and make by mathematical proof the fact of elliptical orbits. And
this proof was important to him as a philosophical device by which he could
assess a Platonic canonic sequence of intervals and harmonies.

Re:

Comment:

Kepler labored for many years on a book known as 'Kepler's Dream'. In
it, he tells of a &quot;dream&quot; voyage to the Moon by a character named
Duracotus who is said to have been born on the slopes of the Icelandic
volcano Hekla. During the voyage, an Icelandic-speaking spirit reveals
the secrets of the solar system to Duracotus.

By the time Kepler was finished with the book, which was published a
few years after his death, footnotes comprised some 50% of the text!

The book is an amalgam of physics and philosophy and makes for hard
reading. In it, Kepler identifies Ignorance as &quot;mother&quot; of Science and
explains that the &quot;son&quot; cannot reveal his mother's &quot;secrets&quot; until
after her death.

At the time, Kepler reported that &quot;the old mother&quot; was alive &quot;in the
universities&quot;, yet living such a life that death must seem preferable
to her!

I wonder if Kepler's obsessive interest in &quot;a Platonic canonic sequence
of intervals and harmonies&quot; at the level of the solar system may have
been rooted in his familiarity with the Augustan-Saga-Shakespeare
concept of Microcosmic Man as Creation in Time and Space alias The
Solar System, where maximum dissonance in Man's Psyche is identified
with the number 729 (Plato's Tyrant) and its polar opposite with the
Comma of Pythagoras, an ancient symbol of Redemption expressed as a
ratio derived from Pythagorean music theory.

Ken, instead of requiring Terry to read yet another essay that you
think brilliant but which our side will probably think nonsense, why
don't you give him some reason to--by providing a few details about it.
For instance, does it use the killed hasti-vibrans argument? What
points does it make against Terry's other points? Why not give just
Paul's BEST reason for claiming that Minerva was associated with
spear-shaking.

Christopher Paul does indeed have a &quot;strong Oxfordian argument,&quot; then he
is the first, and the former null set now has a single member. Of course
at this point we only have your word for it, and your word in this area is
not something that experience has taught us is a reliable guide.

One pattern we HAVE seen over the years is that some Oxfordian will
announce that there IS a &quot;strong argument&quot; in favor of his view, that the
weaknesses of the &quot;strong argument&quot; will be pointed out, and that the
original enthusiasm for the purported &quot;strong argument&quot; will wane until

Bob, you really shouldn't fall for the Oxfordian tosh here. Was Minerva
&quot;associated with&quot; spear shaking? Sure -- as was Mars, as was Aeneas, as
was Robert the Bruce, as was Philip Sidney, as were a great many other
people and figures whose names have appeared close to forms or synonyms of
the words &quot;shake&quot; and &quot;spear.&quot; Look at the examples on this page, and you
will see that &quot;associations with&quot;&quot;spears&quot; and &quot;shaking&quot; were common:

That is NOT the issue. The issues are whether (as some Oxfordians still
claim) Minerva was known as &quot;hastivibrans&quot;; whether &quot;spear-shaker&quot; was an
epithet for Minerva in the way that &quot;the thunderer&quot; was for Jupiter&quot;;
whether Oxford was himself called a &quot;spear-shaker.&quot;

I have argued at some length that all three of these common Oxfordian
claims are false.

&quot;Associated with&quot; is Oxfordian weasel language -- a way of retreating from
the original false claims about Minerva and Oxford sharing the epithet
&quot;spear-shaker&quot; while still giving the deliberately misleading impression
that there is a genuine and important connection between Minerva, Oxford,
and William Shakespeare's last name.

Why let them get away with such an obvious dodge?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There are NO &quot;strong Oxfordian
&gt; arguments&quot; that I know of, and I have looked at quite a few.

The following is a strong argument in this
field. It is not Chris Paul's nor that of
anyone else, who does not post to HLAS.
So Terry, if he deigns, will have no problems
about who said what when -- or why. It's all
mine, and he can deal direct with me.

He won't, of course. Direct dealing is not
something that he likes. It leaves little room
for all the dodging, ducking and other tricks
that he so much enjoys.

The name 'Will Shake-speare' is manifestly
contrived. It was IMO probably adopted
by the poet when he was around twenty
(in 1570) and there are references to a 'Will'
or 'Willy' before we hear of the Stratman.
That man (i.e. William Shagsper) was
probably located through Richard Field,
after the printing of V&amp;A in 1592 and
fawned off on the gullible public largely
as a joke, played by the top aristocracy on
the profoundly ignorant middle-classes.

It is very easy to appreciate the contrived
nature of the name 'Will Shake-speare'.
How many other names in the language
make a statement? What other name could
possibly fit our poet better?

It is make up of three single-syllable Anglo-
Saxon words, each of great punning power.

1) &quot;Will&quot;
On the simplest level we have a name that
makes a statement -- exceedingly usually
among English names -- with 'will' being
taken as the auxiliary verb.

But 'will' can also refer to the sexual organs
(of either sex) and for sexual passion and,
as we know from the 'Will' sonnets, the
poet enjoyed punning on all possible
senses of the word.

2) &quot;Shake&quot;
'Shake' is a common verb, with numerous
senses -- the OED entry is much too long
to reproduce here. However, 'shake' is
also a euphemism for 'fuck' -- as in 'shag'.

3) 'Spear'
'Spear' readily stands in for 'pen' and for
'penis'.

Other senses playing on the last syllable
are:
(a) 'will shakes peer' -- with peer meaning
either 'lord of the realm' or 'equal in rank'
(which, in Oxford's case, were identical).
(b) 'will shakes pee-er' (as in shaking one's
penis after pissing).
(c) 'will shakes pear' -- as in the bawdy
Chaucerian sense of 'pear' -- the fruit.
(d) 'will shakes 'pear' -- with 'pear' in the
aphetic form of 'appearance'. In this
sense the poet is suggesting that he will
'fuck appearance' -- which indeed he did,
in so many ways.

1593 Shakes. Lucr. 472
Who ore the white sheet peers her whiter chin,
The reason of this rash allarme to know.

The range of punnings, mostly bawdy,
on each part of the name, yield a large
number of possible combinations, making
the name unique among 'possibly genuine'
three-syllable English names.

All that is apart form what must have
been the major sense in the mind of the
poet, under which he promises to take
up the 'spear' of his goddess: Pallas
Athena -- the virginal, all-wise, all-seeing,
man-loving but marriage-hating, guardian
of state: his adored Elizabeth.

Obviously, the poet did not plan all the
possible puns -- in the sense of working
them all out before he opted for the name;
but he would have seen many, and been
fully aware of the punning potential of
the selection of such a combination of
words.

Only an insane, rock-bottom fool is
capable of denying the made-up nature
of the name.

&gt;&quot;80-page essay.&quot;

&gt; I can understand your not responding to my questions, especially if
you
&gt; remain unable to understand my points and unable to understand
whatever it
&gt; is that Christopher Paul might have said. We have seen this kind of
tease
&gt; from you before.

&gt;&gt; Among the thousands of irrelevant words in your response are these

&gt;&gt; **&quot;Still, I have not read the essay&quot;.** Hmmm.

&gt; I said that at the outset and repeated it for the benefit of those
with
&gt; limited attention spans. I might well be unfair to Christopher Paul
to
&gt; take his essay at your estimation.

&gt;&gt; Forget the past, Chris did great research. Read the essay, then
&gt;&gt; respond. You have the right to disagree.

&gt; How would you know whether his research was &quot;great&quot; or not? What
have you
&gt; done that would equip you to be able to make such a judgment?

&gt;&gt; Although my experience of you is when confronted with a strong
argument
&gt;&gt; you have a tendency to disconnect and fly off into wild tangents.

&gt; If you were honest with yourself, and a competent judge in these
matters
&gt; (or even a person with a reliable memory) you would know that I have
not
&gt; been &quot;confronted with strong arguments&quot; by Oxfordians -- strongly
worded
&gt; claims, perhaps, but not strong arguments. There are NO &quot;strong
Oxfordian
&gt; arguments&quot; that I know of, and I have looked at quite a few. If
&gt; Christopher Paul does indeed have a &quot;strong Oxfordian argument,&quot; then
he
&gt; is the first, and the former null set now has a single member. Of
course
&gt; at this point we only have your word for it, and your word in this
area is
&gt; not something that experience has taught us is a reliable guide.

&gt; One pattern we HAVE seen over the years is that some Oxfordian will
&gt; announce that there IS a &quot;strong argument&quot; in favor of his view, that
the
&gt; weaknesses of the &quot;strong argument&quot; will be pointed out, and that the
&gt; original enthusiasm for the purported &quot;strong argument&quot; will wane
until
&gt; the next &quot;strong argument&quot; is announced.

&gt;&gt; [..]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If Oxfordianism had followed the same track as Continental
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Drift,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These are only rough comparisons -- closer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to analogies. Continental Drift (like most such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; examples) is in the Sciences, where there is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually a mass of data, rarely available to, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even understandable by, educated laymen.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Today, most educated laymen can't read Latin very
&gt;&gt;&gt; well. Most will have trouble reading a document in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Secretary script. They will not have a broad
&gt;&gt;&gt; acquaintance with the literature. Probably their
&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding of the history will be on a similar
&gt;&gt;&gt; level.

&gt;&gt; No one claims (or is likely to claim) that
&gt;&gt; at any point in almost any society 'most
&gt;&gt; educated laymen' will have developed
&gt;&gt; opinions on controversial topics in the
&gt;&gt; sciences or in literature or history. For
&gt;&gt; nearly all topics in nearly all subjects,
&gt;&gt; the great majority will happily admit their
&gt;&gt; ignorance, and unquestioningly accept
&gt;&gt; the view of the 'qualified experts'.

&gt;&gt; However, in some disciplines and some
&gt;&gt; topics, a few laymen will take an interest
&gt;&gt; and will build up a level of expertise.

&gt; No doubt.

&gt;&gt; Their opinions will often carry much
&gt;&gt; greater weight than those of the
&gt;&gt; professionals, since they are likely to
&gt;&gt; be much more objective.

&gt; I doubt it.

&gt;&gt; Everyone
&gt;&gt; appreciates how it would, nearly always,
&gt;&gt; be professional suicide for, say, a junior
&gt;&gt; lecturer in English Literature to express
&gt;&gt; anti-Stratfordian opinions

&gt; Junior lecturers, if they are any good, will
&gt; eventually have established reputations, will
&gt; be awarded tenure, and will then be in the position
&gt; to say pretty much whatever they please.

&gt; Needless to say, we haven't seen academics of
&gt; high repute coming out in favor of Oxfordianism.
&gt; (So far, the record of Oxfordianism seems somewhat
&gt; worse than that of Creationism in that regard.)

"/>

Speaking as an academic scholar of English who has mixed with such people
(professionally and socially, domestically and at conferences) for thirty
years, I can say that I have never once heard a colleague in any context
suggest any inclination towards anti-stratfordianism of any stripe. None
of them, incidentally, has claimed to be the Emperor Napoleon either. I mix
with such a boring lot.

Peter G.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; -- in much the
&gt;&gt; same way as it would have been for his
&gt;&gt; counterpart in Astronomy around 1600
&gt;&gt; to express a Copernican one.

&gt; Going by Kuhn, the first adopters of the Copernican view
&gt; fell into the professional category.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They won't know what is unique. They won't
&gt;&gt;&gt; know what is commonplace. They won't know what is
&gt;&gt;&gt; an idiom. In short, their initial impression of
&gt;&gt;&gt; what's in a contemporary document is likely not very
&gt;&gt;&gt; close to what is really in there.

&gt;&gt; Few professionals and even fewer laymen
&gt;&gt; will acquire the skills you describe. But
&gt;&gt; how often are they relevant?

&gt; If you want to look only at issues that have already
&gt; been thoroughly discussed by academics and you trust
&gt; what the academics say about the primary documents, I
&gt; suppose never.

&gt;&gt; The issues
&gt;&gt; under debate usually go far beyond them.
&gt;&gt; Revolutions in science (e.g. the Copernican,
&gt;&gt; the Plate Tectonics, the Dinosaur Extinction)
&gt;&gt; are not decided by detail.

&gt; The professionals in all of those scientific
&gt; revolutions appear to have been persuaded by
&gt; the &quot;details.&quot;

&gt;&gt; In many cases,
&gt;&gt; detail is a distraction from the issues.

&gt; I don't believe I've ever found factual evidence to be
&gt; a distraction.

&gt;&gt; How
&gt;&gt; often is such detail discussed here?

&gt; Given how often I see entirely subjective opinions
&gt; expressed as if they were facts, not nearly often
&gt; enough.

&gt;&gt; How
&gt;&gt; often is it relevant? Is any detail going to
&gt;&gt; tell us whether or not the name &quot;Will Shake-
&gt;&gt; speare&quot; like to be one contrived by an
&gt;&gt; Elizabethan poet?

&gt; I don't usually find questions whose answers can
&gt; only be reached through entirely subjective means,
&gt; very useful.

&gt;&gt; Too often those on
&gt;&gt; BOTH sides get lost in the detail, and fail
&gt;&gt; to see the wood for the trees. Terry Ross
&gt;&gt; is a perfect example of an academic who
&gt;&gt; long ago lost all capacity for seeing woods,
&gt;&gt; -- even if he may be able to compare the
&gt;&gt; spores of species of fungus that grow on
&gt;&gt; some leaves of some trees that might grow
&gt;&gt; in woods.

&gt; Terry appears to be correct much more often than
&gt; he is wrong. In any event, his level of knowledge
&gt; is much more useful than that of the amateur who
&gt; only knows the names of a few of the plants in the
&gt; forest, but nevertheless thinks he has a firm grasp
&gt; on the forest's ecology.

&gt;&gt; [..]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there would have been quite a few scholarly adherents
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the first decade after Looney's publication.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Scholarly' . . ? Are you joking?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You may have a false conception of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modern 'scholars', but surely you can a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ppreciate the shallowness and weakness
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of those around 1900? Or in the 1920s?

&gt;&gt;&gt; That the trend has been towards better scholarship

&gt;&gt; Another joke! You think the post-post-
&gt;&gt; modernist kind of thing (or whatever multi-
&gt;&gt; syllable meaningless name for whatever
&gt;&gt; meaningless idea is currently in vogue)
&gt;&gt; represents a trend to 'better scholarship'?

&gt; It seems that in the Crowley school, knowing what
&gt; something is, is not a prequisite for dismissing
&gt; it as meaningless.

&gt;&gt; There _were_ some decent scholars around
&gt;&gt; 1900 (or even around 1920). There can't
&gt;&gt; possibly be said to be any around now.

&gt; A usenet crank opinion, if ever I've heard
&gt; one.

&gt;&gt;&gt; does not mean that there were not good and honest
&gt;&gt;&gt; scholars then.

&gt;&gt; There were a few -- in certain topics -- but
&gt;&gt; they were swimming in vast cess pool of
&gt;&gt; mediocrity. Today, the cess pool is about
&gt;&gt; a thousand times larger and deeper, and
&gt;&gt; there are no honest or even marginally
&gt;&gt; competent scholars.

&gt; In your world, every last human who decides that they
&gt; love literature and/or history so much that they make
&gt; it into a career, ends up corrupted.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you really have a problem with
&gt;&gt;&gt; the scholarship of Sidney Lee? JQ Adams?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Halliwell-Phillips? (I see he's actually 19th
&gt;&gt;&gt; century, but no matter; things were worse
&gt;&gt;&gt; then.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Even if I supposed that scholars were then all either
&gt;&gt;&gt; dishonest or bad, that'd still be no explanation
&gt;&gt;&gt; for respected scholars(in relevant fields) *since*
&gt;&gt;&gt; the 1920s have all dismissed Oxfordianism.

&gt;&gt; Ridiculous. There's every reason.
&gt;&gt; You might as well wonder why Iraqi
&gt;&gt; academics didn't denounce Saddam
&gt;&gt; Hussein.

&gt; Iraqi academics would have been risking their lives to do such
&gt; a thing. If a tenured English history professor said that he was
&gt; an Oxfordian, I suppose he might be ostracized by his old friends.
&gt; Not very analogous, I'm afraid, especially since, he'd be a pretty
&gt; stupid man if he couldn't figure out how to profit from his
&gt; statements(in favor of Oxfordianism.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Am I
&gt;&gt;&gt; to suppose that the very large majority of Elizabethan
&gt;&gt;&gt; literary and history scholars from every era have been
&gt;&gt;&gt; dishonest and/or incompetent?

&gt;&gt; No. They just know where their interests
&gt;&gt; lie and, as they have been thoroughly
&gt;&gt; trained to do, tamely adjust their thoughts
&gt;&gt; accordingly.

&gt; Is this how you see yourself as behaving in such
&gt; circumstances? (I'd guess not, but the idea that
&gt; you believe yourself to be better than almost
&gt; any other human is equally repugnant.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; It does not seem the least bit likely.

&gt;&gt; Extraordinary. Try to imagine yourself
&gt;&gt; as a teacher in Germany in 1933, watching
&gt;&gt; as all your Jewish, Communist-sympathizer,
&gt;&gt; and female colleagues were dismissed.
&gt;&gt; What would you have done? (Most |keep
&gt;&gt; their heads down, and pray that no one
&gt;&gt; notices them. Some crawl, and they are the
&gt;&gt; ones that get promotion.)

&gt; So you think all of the academics live in a world
&gt; much like that one that was ruled by the gestapo.
&gt; Amazing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ideal or not, Wegner's theory followed
&gt;&gt;&gt; roughly that path after it gained the notice
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the professionals. Most dismissed it outright.
&gt;&gt;&gt; As for the rest, after Jeffries(1929) and others
&gt;&gt;&gt; pointed out rather brutally that Wegner's proposed
&gt;&gt;&gt; mechanism was not only a million times too weak
&gt;&gt;&gt; to account for the movement but that the continents
&gt;&gt;&gt; would have been shattered by the force necessary
&gt;&gt;&gt; to move them in that fashion, well, they mostly
&gt;&gt;&gt; stopped thinking about Wegner. That situation
&gt;&gt;&gt; changed very very gradually until the 1950s

&gt;&gt; There was no &quot;very very gradually&quot;.
&gt;&gt; The was no movement.

&gt; I'm sure you've read a web page somewhere to
&gt; that effect.

&gt;&gt; It's exactly like
&gt;&gt; the 'progress' anti-Stratfordianism is
&gt;&gt; making in academia now. No doubt, in
&gt;&gt; 100 years time, some idiot (like you now)
&gt;&gt; will go back and gather all the tiny items
&gt;&gt; of 'progress' into a list that might seem
&gt;&gt; impressive. But it will be taken right out
&gt;&gt; of context. There is much progress;

&gt; One fool persuads other fools that there was
&gt; something to Oxfordianism and some call it
&gt; progress.

&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; it is all outside the realm of academe.

&gt; All outside the light of hlas too.

&gt;&gt; There was much steady progress as
&gt;&gt; regards Continental Drift in the 1950s and
&gt;&gt; 1960s, but there was none within Geology
&gt;&gt; departments.

&gt; Untrue.

&gt;&gt; A student enrolling in 1966
&gt;&gt; would have heard of the topic only as a
&gt;&gt; joke.

&gt; Untrue.

&gt;&gt;After 1967 there were no jokes.

&gt; I'm guessing that there were still jokes.

The fact that you thought Terry &quot;won&quot; the debate shows only how little
you are able to think. I have a standard bet, $100-500 that ten people
who know nothing of the authorship issue and have no bias either way,
read Price's book, then read pertinent threads from the discussions
with Dooley, (Ross Filter Fetish is a good one), minimum 50% will side
with Price-Dooley. My suspicion is 70--80 % is closer.

Since we are supposedly so &quot;insane&quot; 30-50% would be a major victory.
Care to put your money where your mouth is?

Mr. Paul's post doesn't address the central weakness of its thesis: If
Minerva was so closely connected to &quot;spear shaking&quot; and to the theater
that &quot;Shakespeare&quot; was an obvious pen name for a playwright, why did no
contemporary, after the name &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; became prominent,
make the connection? Jonson, Fuller and others pun on the surface
meaning of &quot;shake spear&quot;; no one plays with the supposedly self-evident
link to the purported patron goddess of the stage.

That is an argument from silence, of course, but it is a strong one in
this context. Besides, Oxenfordians argue from silence all the time.

Was it published in the SF magazine? Have you read this essay?

Though the essay does not appear where I can find it on the SF site, I
have found a post by Christopher Paul on the SF forum:

In this post (which was actually a response to something I posted, but I
can't find that I ever replied to Paul's post), we find no mention of the
Oxfordian &quot;hastivibrans&quot; claim; no mention of the Oxfordian claim that
Oxford himself bore the epithet &quot;spear-shaker&quot;; and no attempt to deal
with the actual issues I discussed. Perhaps if I had responded to Paul's
post we could have engaged on those issues, and I could have saved him
from some very basic boo-boos that I do hope he caught before he finished
his essay.

What do we find in his post? Two points of interest. First, Christopher
Paul presents a number of instances where &quot;Minerva&quot; (or one of her other
names) is near &quot;spear&quot; (or a synonym) and &quot;shake&quot; (or a synonym). Paul
made a search that was both wider and narrower than mine. Wider because
he looked for more synonyms; narrower because he did not look for any
sources where any figure other than Minerva was &quot;associated with&quot; spears
and shaking. If he had wished to be truly thorough, he would also have
looked for every non-Minerva instance where a name was near &quot;spear&quot; (or
the same set of synonyms) and &quot;shake&quot; (and the same set of synonyms).

Second, he also made the point that one common derivation of the epithet
&quot;Pallas&quot; was from a Greek word meaning &quot;to shake,&quot; a point Art has often
made here. Paul does NOT exactly claim that whenever people refer to
Athena or Minerva as &quot;Pallas&quot; that they are ipso facto calling her
&quot;Shakespeare&quot; or even &quot;spear-shaker&quot; (which would be false), and he pays
little attention to other suggested derivations that occur in his own
sources.

In any event, no part of Paul's post even attempts to demonstrate that
Minerva was called &quot;hastivibrans&quot; (she was not) or that she was known by
the epithet &quot;spear-shaker&quot; as Jupiter was known as &quot;the Thunderer&quot; or that
Oxford himself was known as &quot;spear-shaker&quot;.

What is most unfortunate about Christopher Paul's SF post (and I hope he
corrected this in his essay, if he did indeed write one), is that his
description of derivations of the name &quot;Pallas&quot; is seriously flawed -- I
hope through simple carelessness.

In particular, his discussion of Henri Estienne's *Thesaurus Linguae
Graecas* is at best woefully incompetent (Paul cannot even tell which
Greek word Estienne is discussing), and extraordinarily misleading. It
may be that Paul corrected his mistakes for the essay that Ken so loved,
so it would be unfair to hold Paul accountable for what may have been
merely the kind of sloppiness any of us might commit before we had checked
our work carefully.

"/>

Obviously we disagree about Dooley. Neither he, nor Price, nor any of her
other defenders has been able to counter my observations about her
anti-Shakespearean filter by quoting what Price had actually said in her
book.

It was a strange situation to be in. I would quote chapter and verse from
Price, explaining clearly what she had actually said, and taking her
actual arguments seriously -- which lead to conclusions so idiotic (e.g.,
that any person for whom there is any evidence of ever having touched a
book should therefore be considered a &quot;professional writer&quot;) that even
those who disagreed with Price thought she surely couldn't have meant what
she said. And yet Price has never renounced the descriptions she gives in
her book of what I called her &quot;filter,&quot; and such defenders as Dooley were
forced to prop up their tacit rejection of her actual argument by using a
substitute that Dooley was making up as he went along. I would have been
willing to discuss Dooley's own argument, if he had ever made it, but I
was not willing to ignore Price's own published work. So sue me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; And while you're at it, if you're going to be snide about fractions

"/>

You still have trouble typing the name &quot;William Shakespeare,&quot; don't you?

As for divisions among genuine scholars, I have no problem whatsoever with
them. Let the debates continue! Of course genuine debate among members
of a scholarly community is possible only because there are shared
standards for evidence and argumentation (the standards evolve, but at any
given time, there is more agreement than disagreement about them). Many
of the kinds of &quot;arguments&quot; Oxfordians habitually use, and without which
Oxfordianism would be impossible, would not be generally recognized as
legitimate by genuine literary historians.

As David Kathman has said, &quot;Oxfordians typically ignore or rationalize
away the external evidence, relying instead on notoriously subjective
internal evidence; they apply a sometimes radical double standard in order
to make Shakespeare look bad in comparison to other playwrights, and to
make Oxford look good; they confidently interpret texts without looking at
the context those texts appeared in; they are distressingly reluctant to
criticize previous Oxfordian writers, even when those writers are clearly
wrong.&quot;

The need to construct or prop up a &quot;case&quot; for Oxfordian views is itself
corrupting, and makes it much less likely that any genuine scholarship
that is also genuinely Oxfordian will occur.

This is actually a logical point. It is so
unusual to see one emanating from a
Strat, that I'm almost tempted to call it
good.

The name 'William Shakespeare' was
seen as contrived by many at the time.
That was why it was printed with the
hyphen. But those, who recognised it
for it was, were obliged to keep quiet
or, at least, they were not able to
publish anything about it in any form
that has been allowed to survive.

However the great majority of those,
who read the name, took it at face value.
We have to remember that they were
quite unsophisticated in the manner in
which they regarded printed matter.
This newly-literate majority were almost
as ignorant as modern professors of
English Literature, and tended to regard
anything in print as almost necessarily
true. Once they accepted the name as
real, the pattern was set, and soon it
reached the unquestioning consensus
that we all first encounter.

The key point was the publication of
the name as the author of 'Venus &amp;
Adonis'. The poet, his queen, and
others who knew its true sense, must
at first have been flabbergasted that
anyone took it as a genuine name.
When they saw that the great majority
did so, and that many started asking:
'Who is this William Shakespeare?', and
when they also learned (through the
printer, Richard Field) that there was a
real person living in Stratford-upon-
Avon who had a name almost fitting
that of the pseudonym, the possibility
occurred to them of both (a) a way out
of the complex dilemma they faced in
attempting to continue the pseudonymity
indefinitely, and (b) of a huge practical
joke to be played on an appallingly
ignorant public.

The near-identity of Eliza with Pallas-
Athena was indisputably manifest to
many. But, in fact, it is rarely made
explicit in Elizabethan literature. There
must be an explanation for this -- and
I suggest that it was officially
discouraged, since it was, in effect,
reserved for one poet.

And if you had, they'd not have remained a
colleague for very long. Would you expect
a cardinal at the recent conclave to express
his atheism? Or, if you were a member of the
NKVD before 1953, would you expect to hear
a colleague express his doubts about the
sanity of Comrade Stalin? If you been a papal
astronomer any time before ~1800 you'd not
have heard a colleague say anything in favour
of Copernicanism.

You can multiply such examples ad infinitum.

The only thing you prove is the academics

As Woman's brain to Man's - (that's rule of three),-

In Mathematics, Woman leads the way;
The narrow-minded pedant still believes

He wheedles monarchs - Woman wheedles him!
Logic? Why, tyrant Man himself admits
It's a waste of time to argue with a woman!
Then we excel in social qualities:

excellent piece of work.&quot; You told us that it was available on the SF
site, but I can find no trace of its existence. Now you are offering in
its place a much much shorter forum post by Christopher Paul that is not
80-pages long, not an essay (although some of the material in the post
might have made it to an essay if the essay had been written), and,
frankly, not &quot;an excellent piece.&quot; One of Christopher Paul's major
sources is a book that he does not seem capable of reading, as anyone
could tell who compared the original to his bizarre and tendentious
account. Trusting your word that there WAS an 80-page essay, and knowing
that the standards are much lower in forum posts than in &quot;really excellent
pieces,&quot; I was not inclined to go into too much detail about Paul's
blunders, but if this post is the latest word of his you've seen, then
perhaps it should be taken more seriously.

So 'fess up now -- have you actually read the 80-page &quot;excellent piece of
work&quot; you praised here? Does it even exist?

Paul's essay addresses Ross' denial that Minerva (Athena) was not
associated with &quot;spear shaking&quot;.
Ross: &quot;Minerva was one of a great many figures who from time to time
shook a spear, but it is false to say that &quot;the spear-shaker&quot; was an
epithet for Minerva the way &quot;earth-shaker&quot; was for Poseidon or &quot;the
thunderer&quot; was for Jove. Ovid could call Jove &quot;tonans&quot; and without his
otherwise referring to the god, readers knew who he meant.
Athena/Minerva had a great many common epithets, but &quot;the spear-shaker&quot;
was not one of them . . . [she] does from time to time &quot;shake&quot; things.
Sometimes she shakes a spear, sometimes she shakes the aegis, sometimes
she shakes other things. So do many other classical figures. What is
not true is to say that she was commonly called &quot;the spear-shaker.&quot;

This is literalist nonsense. Iconically Athena/Minerva is almost always
shown holding a spear. What did she do with it when not in repose? I am
really tired of this BS techno micro argument.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the New Century Classical Handbook:

"/>

&quot;The worship of Athena is essentially an expression of developing
ethical and social principles. SHE IS A GODDESS OF WAR WHO *FIGHTS IN
RIGTEOUS CAUSES*. Like Zeus, she weilds the thunderbolt and the
lightning. She personifies the clear upper air as well as mental
clearness and acuteness, embodying the spirit of truth and Divine
wisdom; she weas the aegis, symbolizing the dark storm cloud, and IS
ARMED WITH THE RESTLESS SPEAR (THE SHAFT OF LIGHTNING).

She participates with skill and wisdom in wars to DEFEND THE STATE, but
does not fight, like Ares, with uncontrolled ferocity for sheer love of
strife. HER ACTIVITIES IN WAR RESTORE ORDER, and thus she is a Goddess
of peace. She upholds law abd order, ENCOURAGES THE ARTS BY WHICH THE
STATE IS STRENGTHENED.

At Troy, Athena/Minerva guided Diomedes' SPEAR so that he wounded Ares
himself. At the judgment of Paris, she offered glory and military
victory. She was so fierce, she put the head of the Medusa on her
shield. The Romans emphasized and strengthened her warrior aspect.

I could go on and on but what's the point? If people announce Oxford
could not be Hamlet because Hamlet was a Prince and Oxford was an Earl,
or that Burghley could not be Polonius because Burghley had two sons,
and Polonius one, how can I expect them to understand how emotional
associations could easily and naturally be made? Whether Minerva was
patron of the theater, which I agree she explicitely wasn't, has no
bearing for me.

For someone like Oxford, who was a jousting champion, to incorporate
the elements listed above into a psuedonym is entirely plausible. The
Goddess of wisdom, clarity, truth, and war whose chief icon is a spear
along with helmet and shield, whose energy was linked with
illumination, restoration of order and strengthening the society.
Harvey stated Minerva was hid in his hand?

Duh?

You ask why Jonson did not pun the name. Pun? Jonson made no mention of
Shakespeare, whoever he was, until long after the author was dead. To
me its a no brainer that as confusion possibly occurred, the name was
hypenated on the plays to send a signal. Who the hell hypenates his own
name? Especially when he published a raving best seller years before
already unhypenated?

Shake-Spears Sonnets? What you ask seems to be right before your eyes,
staring you in the face.

And as you know, Oxfordians contend that Shake-speare was far more
political than thought of by orthodoxy. So I agree with Crowley. Tread
lightly.

IMO Davies knew. So he obliquely referenced our &quot;Terence&quot;, very slyly.

This is what I found. Read my reply to Veal. Its sufficient. Your
argument is typical Ross micro literalist nonsense. I've seen it before
many times. I'm sure I'll see it again. When I do I pass over it
because its useless and a waste of time, space, and energy.

When you do good work, I say so. This ain't one of them. I'm sorry you
see yourself as such a legend in your own mind and are so oblivious to
your blind spots. You're an enigma that way. Kathman plods along. You
soar often but crash spectacularly. Each to his own. Life's a mystery
that way.

Disagree? Even vehemently? Fine. Its a free will universe.

The question isn't Why didn't Ben Jonson play on &quot;Minerva&quot; and
&quot;Shakespeare&quot;, but why didn't *anybody*? Thomas Fuller, writing half a
century later, played on the literal meaning of &quot;shake spear&quot;, but no
one ever, to the best of knowledge, has drawn attention to any
connection between the great playwright's (ostensible) surname and the
goddess of wisdom and war. If the link was *obvious*, if shaking spears
ineluctably suggested Minerva, that silence is inexplicable. Had the
playwright's name been William Thunderbolt, we can be sure that he
would be repetitiously addressed as &quot;The Jupiter of the Stage&quot;.

I take it, BTW, that the &quot;80 page essay&quot; by Christopher Paul was
hyperbole for an 80 line post.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One pattern we HAVE seen over the years is that some Oxfordian

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; announce that there IS a &quot;strong argument&quot; in favor of his
view,
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weaknesses of the &quot;strong argument&quot; will be pointed out, and
that
&gt;&gt; the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; original enthusiasm for the purported &quot;strong argument&quot; will
wane
&gt;&gt;&gt; until
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the next &quot;strong argument&quot; is announced.

&quot;Associated with&quot; is Oxfordian weasel language -- a way of retreating
from
the original false claims about Minerva and Oxford sharing the epithet
&quot;spear-shaker&quot; while still giving the deliberately misleading
impression
that there is a genuine and important connection between Minerva,
Oxford,
and William Shakespeare's last name.&quot;

I am not responsible for other Oxfordians just as you, for example, are
not responsible for Michael Wood. I am a storyteller and folklorist.
Archetpes, images, metaphors, symbols, have importance. Associations
carry weight depending on the specific claim or event.

George Bush and his administration has sworn from here to Heaven they
did not lie and manipulate the country into a war they desperately
wanted. They blamed it on &quot;faulty intelligence&quot;. I didn't need new
revelations from the British government to know they were liers and
thieves from the beginning. &quot;Associations&quot; were enough. Similarly, you
might read John Shelby Spong's &quot;Liberating the Gospels&quot;. You're a smart
fellow, so it might come as no surprise that the New Testament is NOT
narrative history but a grouping of &quot;associations. In fact, the core
Christian doctrine that Christ &quot;died for our sins&quot; is based on one of
the gravest mistaken &quot;associations&quot; of all time.

Thus the power &quot;associations&quot; can have. Who knows how and why people
form them without *documents* to prove them.

Why you yourself fall prey to your own &quot;associations&quot; often, as we all
do. When you wrote about &quot;First Heir of My Invention&quot;, you whipped and
scorned us all over creation because we failed to understand that
Shakespeare was referring to &quot;wit&quot; or &quot;imagination&quot;. It could never
mean &quot;device&quot;.

A good argument, but only potentially half right. You see, dear Terry,
Shakespeare uses &quot;invention&quot; in his works about equally split between
the two. It is your &quot;association&quot; that caused you to ignore the other
half. After all, the author NEVER would use a double meaning with a
word in his work, just as the author of GGW NEVER would intentionally
choose and nuance the word &quot;supposes&quot; for its meaning of *pretend*,
even though the parallelism between the Crow fable and the tirade might
suggest it.

You weren't being a weasel, just earnest (and selective). There were
other times, though, when you have been downright and dirty &quot;weasely&quot;.
Sorry to say. Guess we all have the &quot;disease&quot;.

I did a search here and on the web for this. Apparently you're the only
one here who accepts this as real evidence. It seems it is quite in
contention as a forgery and is not accepted in general as authentic. If
it were, I rather think it would head the list of &quot;evidence&quot; which to

Good point. Let me think about it. I seem to remember Chris stating he
had drafted a long reply to Terry. I remember &quot;80 pages&quot;. If this is
it, then it is not what I was thinking of. Sentiments are the same.

I accede to Terry's point that &quot;Spear shaker&quot; was not a stated name for
Athena/Minerva. To my mind, as I wrote, it wouldn't matter.

For Oxfordians, the point obviously revolves a great deal around
Harvey's description. Especially that &quot;Minerva lies hidden in your
(right) hand.&quot; What then is the meaning to Oxford, as possibility of
the pseudonym evolves in his mind, assuming an Oxfordian paradigm?

Its the author's state of mind I'm concerned with, not peers or

Wait a minute Ken -- you told us that there was an 80-page paper by
Christopher Paul that you thought was an excellent piece of work. Are you
now telling us that you have not read any such paper? Are you telling us
that as far as you know, no such paper exists?

[snip]

This is really incredible -- and I think of myself as a person who tries
to be skeptical of antistratfordian claims. Ken, I BELIEVED you! No, I
didn't believe (without having seen the 80-page essay) that it was &quot;an
excellent piece of work&quot; -- as you know, I have my doubts about your
ability to judge &quot;excellence&quot; in these matters, and I wanted something
more than your word to go by.

What I DID believe was that there was an &quot;80-page paper&quot; and that you had
read it -- after all, I have had no reason in the past to doubt your
ability to know whether you have read something or not, and no reason to
doubt your ability to count to 80, and no reason to doubt your ability to
know whether such an impressive object as an 80-page paper exists or not.

Now we find that you have not read the 80-page paper carefully enough to
judge its excellence; we find that you have not even skimmed its 80-pages;
we find that you have not even held its 80 pages in your hand with the
honest intention of reading it some day; now we find that there is no
80-page paper at all (nor a 70-page paper, nor a 60-page paper, nor a
50-page paper, nor a 40-page paper, nor a 30-page paper); now we find that
you have made up the whole thing.

Excuse me for using language that I have not used before on this
newsgroup, but what a little liar you have turned out to be.

I do not as a rule call those antistratfordians I disagree with &quot;liars&quot;
because I think in many cases they don't know enough to know that what
they are saying (in many cases, what they are parroting from some other
Oxfordian) is false. Such people may be ill-informed; they may be
gullible -- but they do not intend to deceive.

You, on the other hand, are demonstrably a liar. You knew full well that
you had never read the &quot;80-page paper&quot; by Christopher Paul that you
singled out as an example of excellent Oxfordian scholarship (and that you
attacked me for NOT reading when I repeatedly stated that I had not seen
it). Perhaps you honestly believed that such a paper existed somewhere,
but your KNEW that it was not something that you had read.

It may not a problem that you disgrace HLAS with your lying (what, after
all, is HLAS?). As for your lying to me -- well, perhaps I have my own
gullibility problems; perhaps I am sometimes more trusting than I should
be. But surely even a demonstrable liar such as yourself can see that you
do your cause no good when you can only defend it by lying. Of what value
is your Oxfordianism if you cannot defend it honestly? Of what value is
your presence here to your fellow Oxfordians? Of what value to you is
your presence here, where you are now known to be a liar?

Right, Terry. I wasn't falling for anything, just poorly expressing

contention that Minerva had so strong an association with spear-shaking
that just about any mention of spear-shaking in Elizabethan times would
be taken to refer to her alone.

Ooops, I WAS falling for something: like you, I thought there was a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; True, but don't you live in Australia, Peter? That would explain it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynne

&gt;&gt;&gt; An excellent point, Lynne: my new compatriots are well known for a
kind
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; robust scepticism that inoculates them against loopy cults like
&gt;&gt;&gt; Flat-Earthism and Oxfordianism. But a coupe of years ago I attended
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; huge Renaissance Society of America conference in your own fair city
of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Toronto, and authorship speculation was no more in evidence there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter G.

&gt;&gt; Next time you come to Toronto please get in touch. Where is the RSA
&gt;&gt; conference next year? I thought I read it was somewhere on the west
coast
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; the States. Maybe I'll go and speculate about authorship...will I see
you
&gt;&gt; there?

&gt;&gt; Lynne

&gt; I'd like to think so, but I need to have a paper (Toronto was on Wyatt).
&gt; I've got one on Shakespeare's editors, but it treads on too many toes.

&gt; Peter G.

"/>

Peter, it is perfectly acceptable to tread on toes, as I've just been saying
on the Fellowship boards. Treading on toes is often the way we change and
grow. Fear of challenge leads to stagnation. Go for it, I say. And maybe
I'll be there to hear you.

--Does one get any kind of honorarium if one presents a paper there? the
Mouse asked hopefully.

&gt; To be fair, Terry, the 80-page essay is as real as any other Oxfordian
&gt; evidence, so asserting its existence was not out of character for Kaplan.

"/>

Tom, I think there is a difference between saying that Charlton Ogburn's
tract *The Mysterious William Shakespeare* (which is worthless but not
nonexistent) is an excellent piece of work and saying the same of an
80-page essay that one knows one has not read and knows does not exist.

I have never considered Kaplan a competent judge in literary historical
matters, but I did consider him a competent judge of whether he had indeed
read an &quot;80-page essay&quot; well enough to have decided that it was &quot;an
excellent piece.&quot; While I doubted whether I myself would have found the
essay &quot;an excellent piece,&quot; I did not doubt that it must have existed and
that Ken must have read it. How else would he know that it was 80-pages
long and that it was by his lights an excellent piece unless he had read
it? Such details as the specific length and purported excellence of the
essay (and my own unwillingness to think ill of a fellow creature) made me
fall for Kaplan's lies.

Then there was also Ken's outrage that because this excellent 80-page
piece expressed an Oxfordian view, it would be kept from publication by
those nasty Stratfordians. Again, without seeing the essay I was not
willing to accept that the piece was excellent, or that its ultimate
rejection by *SQ* or some comparable journal would have been an injustice
-- but I DID accept that the 80-page essay existed, and that Ken had read
it, and that he found it excellent, and that he was outraged on
Christopher Paul's behalf that such a fine example of genuine scholarship
would have had trouble being published because of its author's views.

Said Kaplan:

&quot;AS another example, Christopher Paul wrote an 80 page essay rebutting
Terry Ross' submission that the association between Minerva, the Spear,
and 'Spear Shaking' was not real intllectual currency in Elizabethan
times. An excellent piece. Pray tell sir, with the authorship issue
defacto regulated to the staus of 'creationism' (Alan Nelson's words in
the New York Times) and refused to be acknowledged as a subject worthy of
study in Stratford land, where would such an essay find a home?&quot;

There might be a library in Borges where &quot;such an essay&quot; as that
&quot;excellent piece&quot; the &quot;80-page essay&quot; by Christopher Paul could find a
home.

The final word may be what Kaplan said elsewhere on this thread: &quot;All I've
ever asked is honesty from Stratfordia.&quot;

A good point. Looking through Boardman's Black-figure and
Red-figure books, I can't find a single action picture. The
miniature copy of Athena Parthenos in the National Museum at
Athens is certainly not in action, though no spear is in
evidence: presumably lost, since she has the hoplite shield.

I find it very easy to imagine any spear-armed army shaking their weapons,
beating them against their shields, etc. &quot;Zulu&quot;, whatever we may think of
its colonialism, presented this very potently. Perhaps I'm overly
influenced by Hollywood in this, but I think I recall John Wayne holding his
rifle over his head and shaking it in some war movie. Seems like a very
natural gesture to threaten an enemy, like pumping your fist in the air.

My point was only that I think you're chasing the wrong rabbit and maybe
letting the right one get away. Even if spear-shaking is common, the more
relevant point - which you were making quite well - is that we don't have
any actual references linking Minerva - or anyone else - and spear-shaking.
As you pointed out, it would have to be essentially proverbial for the
wordplay to work, yet there is nothing. This makes it ridiculous to claim
that anyone would choose Shakespeare as a pseudonym in order to connecct the
writer to Minerva.

What I want to say is that a hoplite battle was not like John
Wayne. It was more like a parade-ground. Or like the
twenty-odd soldiers in Zulu.

That was because of the type of armour. Each man had a round
shield on his left arm which protected his left side. For
protection on the right, he depended on the next man's shield.
So the line must be maintained from beginning to end or all
was lost. The right-hand man was only half protected, and so
he tended to lead a shuffle off towards the right; it was
almost standard to find each army, as it advanced, overlapping
its opponents' left wing (Thucydides 5.71 is perfectly clear).

The success of the Greeks as soldiers was partly due totheir
armour, but equally to the strict discipline that it imposed:
keep the line or die. A steady man (monimos) was what they
needed, not an enthusiast.

You could judge the steadiness of your opponents by watching
how they moved: 'Those men will not stand up to us. It shows
from the movement of their spears and heads. When men are like
that, they rarely stand an attack.' (Thucydides 5.10.5.
Gomme's commentary suggests the whole army is moving, and
Brasidas can see that by looking at their heads and spears. I
can't reconcile that with the next sentence - which indeed one
commentator proposes to delete for no other reason.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;My point was only that I think you're chasing the wrong rabbit and maybe
&gt;letting the right one get away. Even if spear-shaking is common, the more
&gt;relevant point - which you were making quite well - is that we don't have
&gt;any actual references linking Minerva - or anyone else - and spear-shaking.
&gt;As you pointed out, it would have to be essentially proverbial for the
&gt;wordplay to work, yet there is nothing. This makes it ridiculous to claim
&gt;that anyone would choose Shakespeare as a pseudonym in order to connecct the
&gt;writer to Minerva.

I agree this is my weakest point and perhaps not necessary to

I get it. Then shaking your spear would actually be a BAD idea under the
circumstances. It suggests a scene for &quot;Mel Brooks's Troy II&quot; - as the army
is about to charge, Odysseus (Mel himself, naturally) gives a little speech,
concludes with shaking his spear in the air. The entire army follows suit,
each man knocking out the guy next to him.

&gt; Right you are.

From a post I wrote a couple of years ago:

---Start extract from old post---

From   :

&quot;Actors are skilled entertainers, able to excel in
rhetorical and oratorical skills, dance and
pantomime. They might also be musicians, or be
accompanied by musicians. An actor who is highly
skilled might be able to buy his freedom and become a
producer himself. The profession is definitely
upwardly mobile, at least in aspirations. Eventually
there is a theatrical guild for theatre people.
Actors, writers, technicians and managers are
artifices scaenici (scenic artists). The guild is
vaguely religious, associated with the goddess
Minerva who is in charge of skills. The guild never
has the stature or social standing of its Greek
counterpart. Rather, it is similar to other skilled
craft guilds.&quot;

---End extract from old post---

Additionally, on the same web page, you'll find this claim:

In 207 BCE the College of Playwrights* is founded mainly
in honor of Andronicus. This grows into the College of Poets*.
A Temple of Minerva is built to house the meetings of the poets.

FWIW, I have read elsewhere about the poets meeting at the Minerva
Temple. (Can't say that I've seen the claim that the temple was
built for that purpose anywhere else.)

I was away and missed the end of this section.

I'm not sure where this throwing out of &quot;liar&quot; comes from unless you've
decided to ape Ross' worst tendencies. I merely commented on the fact
that you presented in a way that seemed to me that this was very
significant evidence. All I did was question your interpretation on two
counts:

1) That in credible circles part of it is deemed a forgery or that its
authenticity is in question enough to keep it from the certainty you
ascribed to it.
2)That it appears from most arguments to be way down the evidentiary
chain, not in a league of a Groatsworth, for example. A web search and
an HLAS search seemed to confirm this. Your post to me implied
differently.

Why would that make you a &quot;liar&quot;? Lying implies some kind of conscious
attempt to manuipulate evidence or events. Perhaps &quot;real&quot; was the wrong
word. &quot;Significant&quot; would have been better. I had no such beliefs at
all about your position. I thought you just over stated what this
meant. That's your right.

Since I was away from this group, I want to respond. I'll do this in
two parts because I want to address the actual, not inflated issue
later. I suppose in a perverse way I have been given a very big honor
by Mr. Ross for the amount of time, energy, and apparent gravity (if it
is real) for so serious a charge. Imagine, the first time Terry ever
called anyone a liar. FOr what? A memory lapse?

Actually though, Terry, I've come to realize you should seek some
professional help. Truly. This bizarre disconnect that you demonstrate
quite often between the issue at hand and some distracting tactic
usually is just irritating, but in this case seems pathological. I'm
truly sorry that your mind has so left you that this seeming &quot;offense&quot;
in your eyes carries such mighty weight, that the disproportion of your
reaction to what could have been a simple memory error plays out in
public this way.

If you think I'm kidding, think again. I think you are sick. There is
also a deep disconnect between the generous, affable, approachable
person I met in Baltimore and this hysterical apparition. But since
this seems to be a symptom of the web to which I also have succumbed, I
can attribute it partly to the nature of the teritory. Partly.

I previously said &quot;could have been&quot; for a reason. I wrote Chris and he
wrote the following that I'm sure was posted on the Felolowship site,
which is where the idea came to me of a long essay.

&quot; I don't know what you mean by &quot;80 pages&quot;. I just took another look
at that post of mine ***on the SF boards.*** I mention that &quot;The Word
document containing these citations is around 150 pages at this point.
I'll just offer here enough that I think will refute the claims made by
Messrs. Ross and Kathman that Pallas Minerva was no spear-shaker.&quot;
That's the only mention of &quot;pages&quot; that I can think of.&quot;

So I was wrong. Chris had written 150 page essay on the issue, not 80
pages but had only put part of it up. I'll deal with the content of
that next time. But as I was doing a search for &quot;Minerva&quot; and &quot;hidden&quot;
(to see how the group had debated the issue here, very little-all
concentration on 'spear shaking') I came upon this post from December
4, 2003 by who else, Chris Paul. Here are part of his words

&quot;Terry, let me remind you of some history you have conveniently
forgotten in your effort to persuade readers of you own convenient
illusions. In addition to Roger Stritmatter's essay on Minerva
Brittana, which you can read here, this issue came up on the
private Fellowship boards on a thread on which you were an
active participant. Christopher Paul, writing in a post titled
&quot;Pallas Athena=SpearShaker,&quot;
on 24/05/03, replied to you as follows:

The essay folllows which Terry claims is incomplete but enclosed are
these words on this board:

&quot;It's been my intention for too long now to submit an article
incorporating the hundreds of references to Pallas Minerva
contemporary to the Elizabethan/Jacobean era that I've collected
over the years, in which she'll be shown not only as the spear-shaker,
but that when she was not warring, her spear equated--poetically--to
her pen. ***The Word document containing these citations is around
150 pages at this point.*** I'll just offer here enough that I think
will
refute the claims made by Messrs. Ross and Kathman that Pallas
Minerva was no spear-shaker.&quot;

If you were that serious about dealing with the issue in a rational
manner, you could have contacted Chris to ask for the more complete
version, which I erroneously cited (as too short). You have every right
to disagree with Chris' conclusions, but I'll have more to say on that
later.

Now I could go ape here and insinuate that Ross is a deviant liar who
deliberately misled this group by witholding evidence he knew was
pertinent, but I don't believe that. I believe you were most likely
ignorant of the HLAS 2003 post, and/or did not see or pursue enough
Chris' reference to his larger essay on the Fellowship, which easily
could have been done by asking and having a simple trust that my
motives were clean.

But you couldn't do that, and went on some kind of intellectual rampage
which actually looks silly. Except it reveals the total disassociated
shit you can be quite often. A shit, who as George Carlin so aptly put
it is (often) &quot;fucking nuts&quot;.

No, I

something

&gt; What I DID believe was that there was an &quot;80-page paper&quot; and that you

ability to

&gt; Now we find that you have not read the 80-page paper carefully enough

&gt; we find that you have not even held its 80 pages in your hand with

that
&gt; you have made up the whole thing.

&gt; Excuse me for using language that I have not used before on this
&gt; newsgroup, but what a little liar you have turned out to be.

&gt; I do not as a rule call those antistratfordians I disagree with
&quot;liars&quot;
&gt; because I think in many cases they don't know enough to know that
what
&gt; they are saying (in many cases, what they are parroting from some
other
&gt; Oxfordian) is false. Such people may be ill-informed; they may be
&gt; gullible -- but they do not intend to deceive.

&gt; You, on the other hand, are demonstrably a liar. You knew full well
that
&gt; you had never read the &quot;80-page paper&quot; by Christopher Paul that you
&gt; singled out as an example of excellent Oxfordian scholarship (and
that you

somewhere,
&gt; but your KNEW that it was not something that you had read.

&gt; It may not a problem that you disgrace HLAS with your lying (what,

own

is
&gt; your presence here, where you are now known to be a liar?

No, for lying.

I don't expect you to apologize to this newsgroup for your lies, and to be
frank, I'm not sure what value a liar's apology would have. You might
consider apologizing to your Oxfordian friends, because your lies
reinforce the notion (which I do not share) that Oxfordianism cannot exist
without lies, and the judgment (which I DO share) that there is no such
thing as genuine Oxfordian scholarship. The fact that you had to lie in
order to come up with an example of &quot;excellent&quot; Oxfordian scholarship
might be powerful testimony to the paucity of such &quot;scholarship&quot; if you
were a respected spokesman for Oxfordianism.

&gt; Actually though, Terry, I've come to realize you should seek some

That &quot;truly,&quot; coming from the one regular on this newsgroup that I am
forced to call a &quot;liar,&quot; is a nice touch.

&gt; This bizarre disconnect that you demonstrate quite often between the
&gt; issue at hand and some distracting tactic usually is just irritating,
&gt; but in this case seems pathological. I'm truly sorry that your mind has
&gt; so left you that this seeming &quot;offense&quot; in your eyes carries such mighty
&gt; weight, that the disproportion of your reaction to what could have been
&gt; a simple memory error plays out in public this way.

"/>

It was not a &quot;simple memory error.&quot; Let's go back to your original lies:

AS another example, Christopher Paul wrote an 80 page essay rebutting
Terry Ross' submission that the association between Minerva, the
Spear, and &quot;Spear Shaking&quot; was not real intllectual currency in
Elizabethan times. An excellent piece. Pray tell sir, with the
authorship issue defacto regulated to the staus of &quot;creationism&quot; (Alan
Nelson's words in the New York Times&quot;) and refused to be acknowledged
as a subject worthy of study in Stratford land, where would such an
essay find a home?

If the essay you describe had existed, but you had happened to misremember
its length or had exaggerated its excellence, or has misstated its
argument -- those things might not have been lies. If you had heard that
such an essay was being written but had not claimed to have read it, that
might not have been a lie. You, however, not merely claimed that such an
essay existed, you outlined the argument that this nonexistent essay
advanced, you pronounced this nonexistent essay &quot;an excellent piece,&quot; and
you feigned indignation about the difficulty this excellent piece would
have &quot;find[ing] a home&quot; in a scholarly journal of literary history.

The reason I do NOT call antistratfordians &quot;liars&quot; even when they say
things that are demonstrably false is that I try always to remember that
they may not know that what they are saying is false. If they knew what
they were talking about, they would not be Oxfordians. You, however, DID
know that you had never read the nonexistent 80-page &quot;excellent piece&quot; by
Christopher Paul, and you lied to us not merely about the existence of the
piece but also your reading of it, your judgment of its excellence, and
your indignation over its scholarly homelessness.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; If you think I'm kidding, think again.

"/>

I don't much care whether you want us to think you are &quot;kidding.&quot; Who
cares whether a liar wants to be though to be either &quot;kidding&quot; or NOT
&quot;kidding&quot;? Ken, you lied to us about your indignation over the difficulty
Christopher Paul's nonexistent 80-page excellent piece would have in
finding a home in a scholarly journal -- I see no reason to trust any
claims you might make about your emotional state.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think you are sick.

"/>

I doubt you actually believe that, but it does not much matter one way or
the other. Who would trust the diagnosis of a liar even if he were
medically qualified? Of course what you are really saying, I suppose, is
that you are upset with me, but since you have lied to this group about
your emotions before, why should I bother with the question whether your
current pouting is genuine?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is also a deep disconnect between the generous, affable,
&gt; approachable person I met in Baltimore and this hysterical apparition.

"/>

All the more strange that would lie to a person you thought &quot;generous,
affable, approachable.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But since this seems to be a symptom of the web to which I also have
&gt; succumbed, I can attribute it partly to the nature of the teritory.
&gt; Partly.

Can you not take responsibility for your own actions? Do you lack even a
liar's honor?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I previously said &quot;could have been&quot; for a reason. I wrote Chris and he
&gt; wrote the following that I'm sure was posted on the Felolowship site,
&gt; which is where the idea came to me of a long essay.

&gt;&quot; I don't know what you mean by &quot;80 pages&quot;. I just took another look at
&gt; that post of mine ***on the SF boards.*** I mention that &quot;The Word
&gt; document containing these citations is around 150 pages at this point.
&gt; I'll just offer here enough that I think will refute the claims made by
&gt; Messrs. Ross and Kathman that Pallas Minerva was no spear-shaker.&quot;
&gt; That's the only mention of &quot;pages&quot; that I can think of.&quot;

"/>

If I can trust what you claim to have quoted from Christopher Paul, he
does not understand either what I wrote or what the issues are. I have
read his post, and while he misrepresents what his most important sources
say, I would not accuse him of lying because it seems more likely that he
cannot understand his sources. If I get the time, I may detail his
boo-boos at greater length.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; So I was wrong. Chris had written 150 page essay on the issue, not 80
&gt; pages but had only put part of it up.

"/>

No, that's not what he said. He said his collection of texts in which
Minerva is near a synonym for &quot;spear&quot; or &quot;shake&quot; or &quot;pen&quot; is about 150
pages. There is no essay refuting me.

Whatever the merits of his 150 page collection may be, you have not read
it, and you KNOW you have not read it, and you knew at the time of your
earlier posts that you had not read it, so it was a lie to proclaim the
document &quot;an excellent piece&quot; and it was a lie to feign indignation that
this &quot;excellent piece&quot; could not find a home in a scholarly journal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'll deal with the content of that next time. But as I was doing a
&gt; search for &quot;Minerva&quot; and &quot;hidden&quot; (to see how the group had debated the
&gt; issue here, very little-all concentration on 'spear shaking') I came
&gt; upon this post from December 4, 2003 by who else, Chris Paul. Here are
&gt; part of his words

&gt;&quot;Terry, let me remind you of some history you have conveniently
&gt; forgotten in your effort to persuade readers of you own convenient
&gt; illusions. In addition to Roger Stritmatter's essay on Minerva
&gt; Brittana, which you can read here, this issue came up on the
&gt; private Fellowship boards on a thread on which you were an
&gt; active participant. Christopher Paul, writing in a post titled
&gt;&quot;Pallas Athena=SpearShaker,&quot;
&gt; on 24/05/03, replied to you as follows:

"/>

The words you quote are from a post by Roger Stritmatter, not by
Christopher Paul. I would not call your misidentification of the author a
&quot;lie,&quot; as you are simply mistaken in this case. Attribution is not your
strong suit, or you would not be an Oxfordian.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The essay folllows which Terry claims is incomplete but enclosed are
&gt; these words on this board:

That was more of Roger's throat-clearing as he prepares to quote
Christopher Paul. NOW comes the prose of Christopher Paul as quoted by
Roger:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;It's been my intention for too long now to submit an article
&gt; incorporating the hundreds of references to Pallas Minerva contemporary
&gt; to the Elizabethan/Jacobean era that I've collected over the years, in
&gt; which she'll be shown not only as the spear-shaker, but that when she
&gt; was not warring, her spear equated--poetically--to her pen. ***The Word
&gt; document containing these citations is around 150 pages at this
&gt; point.*** I'll just offer here enough that I think will refute the
&gt; claims made by Messrs. Ross and Kathman that Pallas Minerva was no
&gt; spear-shaker.&quot;

"/>

Paul does not appear to know what the issues are or what I have said about
them. Let me repost some comments I gave Ken in an earlier post:

=========================

Ken, if Christopher Paul's understanding of my point is no better than
yours, then his &quot;80 page essay&quot; would not amount to much, would it? Still,
I have not read the essay, and I have known your reports to be unreliable
in the past, so it would not be fair to judge him (either favorably or
unfavorably) on the basis of your assessment.

Do you even know what the Oxfordians have claimed and still claim
regarding &quot;Minerva&quot; and &quot;spear shaking&quot;? Did Christopher Paul not educate
you on this issue? Do you even know what I have said? Must I educate you
on that as well?

Here, for example, is what Peter Dickson has said:

&quot;In 1612, Peacham published *Minerva Britanna*, a compilation of literary
emblems dedicated to Prince Henry. Minerva is the Roman equivalent for
Athena, the hasti-vibrans (spear-shaking) patron Goddess of Greek
theater.&quot;

What is false about this? Athena was NOT the &quot;patron goddess of Greek
theater&quot; and Athena/Minerva was NOT known as the &quot;hasti-vibrans&quot; anything.
The word &quot;hastivibrans&quot; was in fact invented by Thomas Fuller as a witty
tribute to William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon.

In the April 1999 *Harper's*, Dan Wright said Athena &quot;was known to all and
sundry as 'the spear shaker,'&quot; while Mark Anderson said &quot;Elizabethans knew
that Pallas Athena was known by the sobriquet 'the spear-shaker.'&quot; These

It always fascinates me that when you respond to anything, you put out
enough energy to light up a city. There should be a &quot;Ross emergency
energy reserve&quot;.

After reading this drek, I realize once again I am not dealing with a
rational person. Whatever emotional excesses I have exhibited in the
past that may parallel what I consider to be your utter nonsense here I
am certainly willing to claim.

You, on the other hand, have never and most likely will never admit to
anything, even when you present pieces of work that are poorly thought
out and presented, such as &quot;Polus&quot;, are just plain bizarre, such as
your responses to Pat Dooley, or act out and respond irrationaly, as
you have in this and other cases.

If you want to continue to rant on and be an asshole, fine, rant on.
The luxery of the internet is I don't live with you and can tune you
out.

I'll post my response to the one credible aspect of your post, the
contention over the content of the issue rather than this typical,
though strangely inflated (and inaccurate in essence) Ross diversionary
barrage sometime soon.

You have an extraordinary inability to distinguish between the forest

wedded to literalist interpretations of nearly eveything in such a
fanatical fashion.

You have a limited point. As Chris mentioned, he cited the extensive
work he had prepared on the issue and as posted gave out enough that he
felt was sufficient to counter the claims that disagreed with his
position. I was impressed enough with what he posted, which was
probably 20 pages or so in word, that I thought I'd reference it here,
(the longer work, from memory conflating them in my mind). Given the
ferocity of assault on &quot;accuracy-presented as &quot;lying&quot;&quot; leveled here, I
probably should have been more assiduous in scoping out the landscape
because I do have a bad habit of working from memory a little too
cavalierly and make mistakes, for which I have been taken to task over
before, but not like this.

The point that is pertient is twofold:

1)The &quot;essence&quot; of my contention is that Chris had referenced (I
thought prepared) because I had read it in his post, a lengthy rebuttal
to the Minerva issue. 80 pages, 150 pages, what's the difference except
that a longer document that was thorough existed?

2) The excerpts from that document satisied me as to the quality of
that longer work, dealt also satisfactorily with the issue at hand, and
in my mind supported the claim that Oxfordians can do excellent work.

Whether one agrees with the conclusions of the piece is another matter,
and I'll address Terry's concerns, which are legitimate shortly. I
doubt they'll be accepted but that's life.

If I am to jump on Grumman at the Fellowship on problems in
presentation, then I will accept appropriate lumps here for similar
mistakes. But this was beyond the pale. And I got pissed.

&quot;Excesses&quot;? Is there some moderate amount of lying that I should have

the enthusiasm with which you express your views -- such enthusiasm has
often proven misplaced, and is no sign that what you are impressed by

your claims to have read anything, to have judged the quality of anything,

My &quot;Polus&quot; essay is a close look at a point on which Oxfordians have
deceived themselves for decades.

They have similarly deceived themselves about &quot;hastivibrans.&quot; In fact,
some of the same laziness and ignorance that lay behind the Oxfordian
&quot;Burghley = Polus&quot; myth also lies behind the &quot;hastivibrans = Minerva =
Oxford&quot; myth.

As for my responses to Dooley, what was &quot;bizarre&quot; about them is that I was
the one who was able to back up my comments on Price's book through direct
quotation of Price's own words, taken directly from her book. Dooley was
unable to defend Price's methods, and so he began to sketch some of his
own. At some point it might have been interesting to see whether he would
be able to form an argument, but since the entire point of our exchanges
concerned Price's book, I did my best to focus attention on what Price
herself had actually said. It really is not my fault that Price made an
idiotic argument. If you wish to be angry, then perhaps you should be
angry not at me but at those who have deceived you; better yet, don't be
angry at all, but learn not to allow your desire to believe overwhelm your
judgment.

No it isn't. It is primarily that but badly clothed in an attempt to
defuse the Burghley as Polonius issue. Either that or you can't
coherently construct an argument in this case. And your attempts since
I initially confronted you on it to spin it don't change that
fundamental mishsandlimg of the presentation.

Were you a &quot;liar&quot; and &quot;deceiver&quot; to do that, just zealous and over
reaching, or maybe it just wasn't one of your better thought out
presentations.

I sense it was the latter, mixed with the touch of the middle. I tend
to respect your position in that you represent it usually well. I do
not respect your deflections, distractions, and overly literal
interpretations.

&gt; How then should I act rationally in the presence of your words now?
&gt; Should I take you at your words now? Should I believe you? No, that would
&gt; NOT be rational.

&gt;&gt; Whatever emotional excesses I have exhibited in the past that may
&gt;&gt; parallel what I consider to be your utter nonsense here I am certainly
&gt;&gt; willing to claim.

&gt;&quot;Excesses&quot;? Is there some moderate amount of lying that I should have
&gt; considered acceptable? How would that be rational? I DO try to discount
&gt; the enthusiasm with which you express your views -- such enthusiasm has
&gt; often proven misplaced, and is no sign that what you are impressed by
&gt; should impress any of the rest of us -- but I do not know how to evaluate
&gt; your claims to have read anything, to have judged the quality of anything,
&gt; to have an opinion on the fairness or unfairness of anything. Under some
&gt; circumstances these might be trivial matters, but in a form such as this
&gt; (or the SF forum) there has to be at least a modicum of trust.

&gt;&gt; You, on the other hand, have never and most likely will never admit to
&gt;&gt; anything, even when you present pieces of work that are poorly thought
&gt;&gt; out and presented, such as &quot;Polus&quot;, are just plain bizarre, such as your
&gt;&gt; responses to Pat Dooley, or act out and respond irrationaly, as you have
&gt;&gt; in this and other cases.

&gt; My &quot;Polus&quot; essay is a close look at a point on which Oxfordians have
&gt; deceived themselves for decades.
&gt; http://shakespeareauthorship.com/polus.html

&gt; They have similarly deceived themselves about &quot;hastivibrans.&quot; In fact,
&gt; some of the same laziness and ignorance that lay behind the Oxfordian
&gt;&quot;Burghley = Polus&quot; myth also lies behind the &quot;hastivibrans = Minerva =
&gt; Oxford&quot; myth.

&gt; As for my responses to Dooley, what was &quot;bizarre&quot; about them is that I was
&gt; the one who was able to back up my comments on Price's book through direct
&gt; quotation of Price's own words, taken directly from her book. Dooley was
&gt; unable to defend Price's methods, and so he began to sketch some of his
&gt; own. At some point it might have been interesting to see whether he would
&gt; be able to form an argument, but since the entire point of our exchanges
&gt; concerned Price's book, I did my best to focus attention on what Price
&gt; herself had actually said. It really is not my fault that Price made an
&gt; idiotic argument. If you wish to be angry, then perhaps you should be
&gt; angry not at me but at those who have deceived you; better yet, don't be
&gt; angry at all, but learn not to allow your desire to believe overwhelm your
&gt; judgment.

&gt;&gt; If you want to continue to rant on and be an *ssh*le, fine, rant on. The
&gt;&gt; luxery of the internet is I don't live with you and can tune you out.

&gt; Yes, but you don't, do you? You rant and pout and whine and call bad
&gt; names, like a little boy who has been caught cheating -- believe me when I
&gt; tell you I sympathize with the frustration you must feel, but you really
&gt; have brought this on yourself by your lying. And what did your lies gain
&gt; you?

&gt;&gt; I'll post my response to the one credible aspect of your post, the
&gt;&gt; contention over the content of the issue rather than this typical,
&gt;&gt; though strangely inflated (and inaccurate in essence) Ross diversionary
&gt;&gt; barrage sometime soon.

&gt; Your lying has been a diversion without being diverting; this much is
&gt; true. I have never called any HLAS regular a liar before, and I am not
&gt; pleased to have to call you on your lies. As for the question whether
&gt; Minerva ever bore the epithet &quot;hastivibrans,&quot; the answer to that is &quot;no.&quot;
&gt; That term was coined by Thomas Fuller as a witty tribute to William
&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford on Avon. Oxfordians (and Baconians) have been
&gt; deceiving themselves for decades about this matter. It is not really my
&gt; fault that they have done so.

&gt;&gt; You have an extraordinary inability to distinguish between the forest
&gt;&gt; and the trees.

&gt; The cliches you rely on today are somewhat milder than those you used a
&gt; few days ago, which is probably a sign that you're cooling down somewhat.

&gt;&gt; I have in my entire lifetime never met a person so wedded to literalist
&gt;&gt; interpretations of nearly eveything in such a fanatical fashion.

&gt; There is nothing particularly fanatical about a willingness to focus on
&gt; what people have actually said.

&gt;&gt; Truly unique in my experience.

&gt; There's that word &quot;truly&quot; again. I wonder what you can mean by it?

You wrote

My &quot;Polus&quot; essay is a close look at a point on which Oxfordians have

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; deceived themselves for decades.
&gt; http://shakespeareauthorship.com/polus.html

"/>

Partly true but you just couldn't contain yourself, so you wrote a
poorly constructed and in many ways mislesading essay. Let's take a
closer look. The preview is technically correct :
&quot;For fifty years Oxfordians have contended that strong evidence that
the character Polonius in Hamlet was based on Lord Burghley is that
Burghley's nickname was &quot;Polus...&quot; but your essay does not follow this
logic.

It is axiomatic in composition that the purpose of the paper be
displayed early, often in the first paragraph or two. Here is your
first paragraph.

&quot;Anyone who wishes to argue that the works we know as Shakespeare's
were actually written by Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of
Oxford, faces the problem that no contemporary ever credited Oxford
with writing so much as a line that is now generally credited to
Shakespeare. Oxfordians must look elsewhere for evidence, and they have
sought it in verbal parallels between the works of Shakespeare and
Oxford, or in the fact that some of the verse forms used by one were
also used by the other; they have even argued that Oxford's reputation
as a poet was so great that he must have been Shakespeare.
Unfortunately for the Oxfordians, the alleged evidence for their
arguments cannot stand up under scrutiny. The most common argument is
that Shakespeare's works are somehow &quot;about&quot; Oxford's life. One point
that Oxfordians raise repeatedly is that since some critics have
suggested that the character of Polonius in Hamlet may owe something to
Lord Burghley, Hamlet himself must have been Oxford's self-portrait. In
an op-ed piece that appeared in the Washington Post on March 21, 1999,
David Ignatius embraced a hoary Oxfordian myth when he said, &quot;The
officious, advice-giving character Polonius may have been based on Lord
Burghley (whose nickname, it happens, was 'Polus').&quot;

To reiterate: after a bunch of dismissal you &quot;declare&quot; the main point:

&quot;The most common argument is that Shakespeare's works are somehow
&quot;about&quot; Oxford's life. (your words) One point that Oxfordians raise
repeatedly is that since some critics have suggested that the character
of Polonius in Hamlet may owe something to Lord Burghley, Hamlet
himself must have been Oxford's self-portrait.&quot;

A big topic. Obviously you're going to address this argument. In fact
later on you actually *concede * that Polonius may have partly been
based on Burghley, so now the argument may be one of degree not kind.
Perhaps you're going to contend with many of the elements of that
discussion, for example how offensive is the epithet Hamlet gives
Polonius &quot;Jephthah&quot;, how degrading is it to skewer a caricature of one
of the Chief officers of the state, insulting him soon after his death,
how intimate is the insult, how much does the Ophelia-Polonius-Hamlet
triangle echoe the Devere-Burghley-Anne Cecil relationship, especially
in emotional tone, how startling are the parallels between the specific
concerns Burghley expressed for his son Thomas in Paris in private
letters compared to the advice Poloinius gives Reynaldo-things like
that?

Since you brought it up as a central declarative statement regarding
the purpose of your essay.
Again:
&quot;The most common argument is that Shakespeare's works are somehow
&quot;about&quot; Oxford's life. (your words) One point that Oxfordians raise
repeatedly is that since some critics have suggested that the character
of Polonius in Hamlet may owe something to Lord Burghley, Hamlet
himself must have been Oxford's self-portrait.&quot;

Instead, you move off on a tangent:

&quot;In an op-ed piece that appeared in the Washington Post on March 21,
1999, David Ignatius embraced a hoary Oxfordian myth when he said, &quot;The
officious, advice-giving character Polonius may have been based on Lord
Burghley (whose nickname, it happens, was 'Polus').&quot;

This myth is not in the portrayal but in the nickname &quot;Polus&quot; and
instead of putting what you perceive to be bad scholarship and the over
use of this factoid in some perspective to the core issue you have
stated, you energetically (as usual) begin a huge deconstruction of
Oxfordian failures regarding this term.

Now, was Ignatious *wrong* to claim &quot;The officious, advice-giving
character Polonius may have been based on Lord Burghley...&quot;

Your last paragraph reveals your true intention and what should have
been the lead in, but even here you cannot help dodging the larger
argument.

&quot;The question whether Burghley was nicknamed &quot;Polus&quot; is, of course, a
minor one.&quot;

Really, you just spent a gazillion words and your reputation to make it
a major issue.

&quot;Even if the Oxfordians had been correct, that would not have
strengthened their case.&quot;

Oh, I see, assertion without evidence on a really major topic, one that
might require an enormous delicacy of discerment and much discussion
and diversity of opinion works just fine for you.

&quot;Some actual scholars have suggested that the character of Polonius may
owe something to Burghley, and Burghley certainly was lampooned by
Spenser (where?), so it is conceivable though far from certain that
Shakespeare (who, like Spenser, had never been Burghley's ward) used
some elements of the statesman in his character Polonius.

Oh, a nice left handed compliment. &quot;It may be true, but examining the
consequences of the portrayal really is beneath me and clearly a waste
of time. After all, I the great Ross have spoken.&quot; So there are no
consequences for a commoner gutting one of Elizabeth's most trusted
officials in public. Robert Cecil is just fine with it.

&quot;What is telling about the history of this Oxfordian myth is how it
could have been exploded at any point in the last fifty years by any
Oxfordian who had bothered to do a bit of proper research on the
question. A reader who browses through the other pages at the
Shakespeare Authorship site will find many other Oxfordian myths
refuted, and in many cases the same pattern holds: an Oxfordian myth
arises, and later Oxfordians are content to repeat and even elaborate
that myth without returning to the ostensible evidence. Given this
pattern, the &quot;polus&quot; myth is not an isolated instance but is
representative of the carelessness and lack of scholarship without
which Oxfordianism could not exist.

There is your real intention, buried at the end:

&quot;A reader who browses through the other pages at the Shakespeare
Authorship site will find many other Oxfordian myths refuted, and in
many cases the same pattern holds: an Oxfordian myth arises, and later

returning to the ostensible evidence. Given this pattern, the &quot;polus&quot;
myth is not an isolated instance but is representative of the
carelessness and lack of scholarship without which Oxfordianism could
not exist.&quot;

If you had started with this premise, left it at that, dealing with a
minor but significant issue, you would have been on firm ground. And on
its terms *within* the essay, you were right.

BUT THAT'S NOT HOW YOU FRAMED IT. You couldn't hold back. I can't tell
whether you were just too obsessed to slay the dragon, over zealous, or
just sloppy.

Another person might insinuate that you deliberately had intent to
mislead a public that would not know the particulars of the issue, that
your methods and motives were dishonest. That your broad brush stroke
and downplay was not accidental. I don't think that. I think you were
careless, lazy and exhibited a major characteristic you have sometime,
distraction by trying to make the lesser argument carry the larger one.
&quot;The Oxfordians claim Oxford's life is reflected in many of the works.
One of the main claims is that Polonius is Burghley. The parallels
(plus didactic evidence'falling out at tennis, se offendo,
pirates'among others) give us pause as to Devere's relationship to
Hamlet. Oh, I'll focus on one point. That will invalidate the entire
argument.&quot;

Sometimes you delete pertinent evidence from a discussion, as you did
with &quot;First Heir of My Invention&quot;. Sometimes you distract by attacking
the accuracy of your opponent, rather than deal with the genuine points
they have laid before you.

Disconnect/blind spot Mark termed it.

YOU are the one who demands razor sharp accuracy. YOU are the one who
belittles every misstep.

I have said often that I respect much of the work you do. That your
website has forced much more rigor among many Oxfordians. (The
Fellowship was scathing on &quot;Shakespeare's Fingerprints&quot;.) This essay
was writren many years ago. What was true then may not be as true now.

This thread began because Kositsky and Stritmatter posited research
that claims a huge Stratfordian assumption, encapsulated by David
Kathman in his essay, was based on sloppy, shallow research, parroted
year after year after year. Sound familiar?

One of my bad habits is working from memory rather than checking
sources. Off the cuff I can make a lot of errors. I get whupped for
them. In this case there WAS a larger paper. You HAD or COULD HAVE
CHECKED to see if it existed. What Chris put down satisfied me on the
issue, about which I will say more later. If you felt run around, I
apologize, but your outburst was uncalled for.

Your Polus essay contained some fine points. You did good archival
scholarship. But you marred it badly in your zealousness. You
introduced and ended it in a sloppy, careless, cognitively dissonent
fashion. (If you choose to edit it, taking into account my criticisms,
I demand credit.)

Pigs most likely will fly first but I hope, vain as you are, that you
maintain it as is. Its a good example of how your thought process can
sever according to your whims.

No, you are not reading the essay I wrote. My essay is an examination of

Do you know any Oxfordian who has read my essay and has produced any
evidence that Burghley was indeed known as &quot;Polus&quot;? Have you seen any
response to the essay that contradicts any part of it? I do know of at
least one Oxfordian who read the essay on its merits and agreed with its
central argument. Nina Green includes among her &quot;Oxmyths relating to
persons other than Oxford and Shaksper&quot; this item:

MYTH: Lord Burghley was known as Polus.

There is no evidence of this.

References:

We haven't been on clark.net for many years, so Nina must have seen the
essay when it was quite new. Of course Nina also believes a great many
things with which I do not agree, but I mention her as one Oxfordian
reader who not only did not find the essay difficult to understand, but
who agreed with it. She perhaps had the advantage over you of dealing
with the actual essay I wrote.

fairly. I have made my case. There is no evidence that Burghley was ever

No, that is not the &quot;main point&quot; of the essay, as you would know if you
were a more careful reader. If you look at that first paragraph again,
you will see that it narrows the focus of attention from what &quot;Anyone who
wishes to argue&quot; for Oxford needs to do, to a particular point made by a
particular person who is arguing for Oxford. Have you never in your wide
lifetime of reading seen an opening paragraph that brought the reader from
a general perspective into the particular issue that will be the focus of
the essay?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; A big topic. Obviously you're going to address this argument.

"/>

That is not what the essay attempts to do. The title of the essay is
&quot;Oxfordian Myths: Was Burghley Called 'Polus'?&quot; -- you should have figured
that the focus of the essay was on whether Burghley was indeed called
&quot;Polus.&quot; The first paragraph of the two-paragraph introduction moves from
the general (the first word is &quot;Anyone&quot;) to the particular (the last word
of the first paragraph is &quot;Polus&quot;). That is not an accident, but I don't
mind if people don't notice all the architecture of the piece; still, even
you would not have missed the point if you were a more careful reader.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In fact later on you actually *concede * that Polonius may have partly

&gt; must have been Oxford's self-portrait.&quot;

"/>

At the risk of repeating myself -- the first paragraph narrows the
(astute) reader's focus from the general to the particular. By way of
contrast, the last paragraph moves from the particular (the &quot;Polus&quot; myth)
back to the general: &quot;Given this pattern, the 'polus' myth is not an
isolated instance but is representative of the carelessness and lack of
scholarship without which Oxfordianism could not exist.&quot;

Did you get that much? Begin with the general, and move by the end of the
first paragraph to the announced focus of the essay. In the second
paragraph, outline the argument and the means of examination. In the body
of the essay, give the evidence and develop the argument. In the first
paragraph of the two-paragraph conclusion, recapitulate the particular
argument. In the final paragraph of the conclusion, broaden the focus
once more.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Instead, you move off on a tangent:

&gt;&quot;In an op-ed piece that appeared in the Washington Post on March 21,
&gt; 1999, David Ignatius embraced a hoary Oxfordian myth when he said, &quot;The
&gt; officious, advice-giving character Polonius may have been based on Lord
&gt; Burghley (whose nickname, it happens, was 'Polus').&quot;

"/>

No careful reader would see that as a tangent; rather it brings the reader
to the particular focus announced by the title.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; This myth is not in the portrayal but in the nickname &quot;Polus&quot; and
&gt; instead of putting what you perceive to be bad scholarship and the over
&gt; use of this factoid in some perspective to the core issue you have
&gt; stated, you energetically (as usual) begin a huge deconstruction of
&gt; Oxfordian failures regarding this term.

"/>

It is not a &quot;deconstruction&quot; (a word whose signification appears foreign
to you) but an analysis. I look first at the source material claimed by
Oxfordians -- Gabriel Harvey's *Gratulationes Valdinenses* -- the ONLY
place where Oxfordians claim the purported nickname &quot;Polus&quot; was ever used
for Burghley. I discuss every instance of &quot;polus&quot; in Harvey's volume.
In NONE of them is it used as a nickname of Burghley.

Having established that there is no merit to the claim, I then sketch its
history. Now, I could have sketched the history first and discussed
Harvey later -- any careful reader should have been able to deal with
either structure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Now, was Ignatious *wrong* to claim &quot;The officious, advice-giving
&gt; character Polonius may have been based on Lord Burghley...&quot;

"/>

Ignatius was wrong to say &quot;whose nickname, it happens, was 'Polus.'&quot;
Note that Ignatius is not sure that Polonius WAS based on Burghley (the
careful reader will not have noticed Ignatius's &quot;may have been&quot;), but he
offers as a fact of history that Burghley's nickname was &quot;Polus.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your last paragraph reveals your true intention and what should have
&gt; been the lead in, but even here you cannot help dodging the larger
&gt; argument.

"/>

There is no dodging whatsoever, as any reasonably capable reader can
judge. The title promises a look at the Oxfordian myth that Burghley was
called &quot;Polus.&quot; The essay delivers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&quot;The question whether Burghley was nicknamed &quot;Polus&quot; is, of course, a
&gt; minor one.&quot;

"/>

It is indeed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Really, you just spent a gazillion words and your reputation to make it
&gt; a major issue.

"/>

No, I wrote a few thousand words exposing the myth and sketching its
history. I don't know what you mean by my &quot;spen[ding my] reputation,&quot; but
I did sign the piece, as is my habit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&quot;Even if the Oxfordians had been correct, that would not have
&gt; strengthened their case.&quot;

This is true.

&gt; Oh, I see, assertion without evidence on a really major topic, one that

&gt;&gt; Since I was away from this group, I want to respond. I'll do this in
&gt;&gt; two parts because I want to address the actual, not inflated issue
&gt;&gt; later. I suppose in a perverse way I have been given a very big honor
&gt;&gt; by Mr. Ross for the amount of time, energy, and apparent gravity (if it
&gt;&gt; is real) for so serious a charge. Imagine, the first time Terry ever
&gt;&gt; called anyone a liar. FOr what? A memory lapse?

&gt;&gt; Actually though, Terry, I've come to realize you should seek some
&gt;&gt; professional help. Truly. This bizarre disconnect that you demonstrate
&gt;&gt; quite often between the issue at hand and some distracting tactic
&gt;&gt; usually is just irritating, but in this case seems pathological. I'm
&gt;&gt; truly sorry that your mind has so left you that this seeming &quot;offense&quot;
&gt;&gt; in your eyes carries such mighty weight, that the disproportion of your
&gt;&gt; reaction to what could have been a simple memory error plays out in
&gt;&gt; public this way.

&gt;&gt; If you think I'm kidding, think again. I think you are sick. There is
&gt;&gt; also a deep disconnect between the generous, affable, approachable
&gt;&gt; person I met in Baltimore and this hysterical apparition. But since
&gt;&gt; this seems to be a symptom of the web to which I also have succumbed, I
&gt;&gt; can attribute it partly to the nature of the teritory. Partly.

&gt;&gt; I previously said &quot;could have been&quot; for a reason. I wrote Chris and he
&gt;&gt; wrote the following that I'm sure was posted on the Felolowship site,
&gt;&gt; which is where the idea came to me of a long essay.

&gt;&gt;&quot; I don't know what you mean by &quot;80 pages&quot;. I just took another look
&gt;&gt; at that post of mine ***on the SF boards.*** I mention that &quot;The Word
&gt;&gt; document containing these citations is around 150 pages at this point.
&gt;&gt; I'll just offer here enough that I think will refute the claims made by
&gt;&gt; Messrs. Ross and Kathman that Pallas Minerva was no spear-shaker.&quot;
&gt;&gt; That's the only mention of &quot;pages&quot; that I can think of.&quot;

&gt;&gt; So I was wrong. Chris had written 150 page essay on the issue, not 80
&gt;&gt; pages but had only put part of it up. I'll deal with the content of
&gt;&gt; that next time. But as I was doing a search for &quot;Minerva&quot; and &quot;hidden&quot;
&gt;&gt; (to see how the group had debated the issue here, very little-all
&gt;&gt; concentration on 'spear shaking') I came upon this post from December
&gt;&gt; 4, 2003 by who else, Chris Paul. Here are part of his words

&gt;&gt;&quot;Terry, let me remind you of some history you have conveniently
&gt;&gt; forgotten in your effort to persuade readers of you own convenient
&gt;&gt; illusions. In addition to Roger Stritmatter's essay on Minerva
&gt;&gt; Brittana, which you can read here, this issue came up on the
&gt;&gt; private Fellowship boards on a thread on which you were an
&gt;&gt; active participant. Christopher Paul, writing in a post titled
&gt;&gt;&quot;Pallas Athena=SpearShaker,&quot;
&gt;&gt; on 24/05/03, replied to you as follows:

&gt;&gt; The essay folllows which Terry claims is incomplete but enclosed are
&gt;&gt; these words on this board:

&gt;&gt;&quot;It's been my intention for too long now to submit an article
&gt;&gt; incorporating the hundreds of references to Pallas Minerva
&gt;&gt; contemporary to the Elizabethan/Jacobean era that I've collected
&gt;&gt; over the years, in which she'll be shown not only as the spear-shaker,
&gt;&gt; but that when she was not warring, her spear equated--poetically--to
&gt;&gt; her pen. ***The Word document containing these citations is around
&gt;&gt; 150 pages at this point.*** I'll just offer here enough that I think
&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt; refute the claims made by Messrs. Ross and Kathman that Pallas
&gt;&gt; Minerva was no spear-shaker.&quot;

&gt;&gt; If you were that serious about dealing with the issue in a rational
&gt;&gt; manner, you could have contacted Chris to ask for the more complete
&gt;&gt; version, which I erroneously cited (as too short). You have every right
&gt;&gt; to disagree with Chris' conclusions, but I'll have more to say on that
&gt;&gt; later.

&gt;&gt; Now I could go ape here and insinuate that Ross is a deviant liar who
&gt;&gt; deliberately misled this group by witholding evidence he knew was
&gt;&gt; pertinent, but I don't believe that. I believe you were most likely
&gt;&gt; ignorant of the HLAS 2003 post, and/or did not see or pursue enough
&gt;&gt; Chris' reference to his larger essay on the Fellowship, which easily
&gt;&gt; could have been done by asking and having a simple trust that my
&gt;&gt; motives were clean.

&gt;&gt; But you couldn't do that, and went on some kind of intellectual rampage
&gt;&gt; which actually looks silly. Except it reveals the total disassociated
&gt;&gt; shit you can be quite often. A shit, who as George Carlin so aptly put
&gt;&gt; it is (often) &quot;fucking nuts&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Ken Kaplan
&gt; To make a long story short: Ken Kaplan has read neither the 80-page or the
&gt; 150-page &quot;excellent piece of work&quot; that he attacked Terry for not reading.

"/>

That does indeed appear to be the most accurate précis of the affair.
However, I find Ken's apoplectic outburst bizarre -- while I have more
than once commented ruefully upon Ken's thoroughly misdirected and
apparently ungovernable anger, I have never seen it displayed to such an
absurd extreme as in this thread. Of course, Ken is by no means the
first anti-Stratfordian who has proven to be an inattentive reader --
or nonreader -- of text that he himself brings up; this sort of thing
happens time and time again. However, most of Ken's coreligionists are
somewhat more cognizant of how foolish they look when they lash out at
others for their own slapdash disregard for accuracy. In particular,
in no way does Terry Ross deserve to be called &quot;A sh*t who [...] is
'f*cking nuts'.&quot; It is a pity that Oxfordians are seldom as creative in
their insults as they are in their &quot;reading.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is what I found.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wait a minute Ken -- you told us that there was an 80-page paper by

&gt;&gt; Are you
&gt;&gt;&gt; now telling us that you have not read any such paper? Are you
&gt;&gt; telling us
&gt;&gt;&gt; that as far as you know, no such paper exists?

&gt;&gt;&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is really incredible -- and I think of myself as a person who
&gt;&gt; tries
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be skeptical of antistratfordian claims. Ken, I BELIEVED you!
&gt;&gt; No, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't believe (without having seen the 80-page essay) that it was
&gt;&gt;&quot;an
&gt;&gt;&gt; excellent piece of work&quot; -- as you know, I have my doubts about your
&gt;&gt;&gt; ability to judge &quot;excellence&quot; in these matters, and I wanted
&gt;&gt; something
&gt;&gt;&gt; more than your word to go by.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What I DID believe was that there was an &quot;80-page paper&quot; and that you
&gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt;&gt; read it -- after all, I have had no reason in the past to doubt your
&gt;&gt;&gt; ability to know whether you have read something or not, and no reason
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; doubt your ability to count to 80, and no reason to doubt your
&gt;&gt; ability to
&gt;&gt;&gt; know whether such an impressive object as an 80-page paper exists or
&gt;&gt; not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now we find that you have not read the 80-page paper carefully enough
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; judge its excellence; we find that you have not even skimmed its
&gt;&gt; 80-pages;
&gt;&gt;&gt; we find that you have not even held its 80 pages in your hand with
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; honest intention of reading it some day; now we find that there is no

&gt;&gt;&gt; 80-page paper at all (nor a 70-page paper, nor a 60-page paper, nor a

&gt;&gt;&gt; 50-page paper, nor a 40-page paper, nor a 30-page paper); now we find
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you have made up the whole thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Excuse me for using language that I have not used before on this
&gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroup, but what a little liar you have turned out to be.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not as a rule call those antistratfordians I disagree with
&gt;&gt;&quot;liars&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; because I think in many cases they don't know enough to know that
&gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt;&gt; they are saying (in many cases, what they are parroting from some
&gt;&gt; other
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordian) is false. Such people may be ill-informed; they may be
&gt;&gt;&gt; gullible -- but they do not intend to deceive.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You, on the other hand, are demonstrably a liar. You knew full well
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you had never read the &quot;80-page paper&quot; by Christopher Paul that you
&gt;&gt;&gt; singled out as an example of excellent Oxfordian scholarship (and
&gt;&gt; that you
&gt;&gt;&gt; attacked me for NOT reading when I repeatedly stated that I had not
&gt;&gt; seen
&gt;&gt;&gt; it). Perhaps you honestly believed that such a paper existed
&gt;&gt; somewhere,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but your KNEW that it was not something that you had read.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It may not a problem that you disgrace HLAS with your lying (what,
&gt;&gt; after
&gt;&gt;&gt; all, is HLAS?). As for your lying to me -- well, perhaps I have my
&gt;&gt; own
&gt;&gt;&gt; gullibility problems; perhaps I am sometimes more trusting than I
&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt;&gt; be. But surely even a demonstrable liar such as yourself can see
&gt;&gt; that you
&gt;&gt;&gt; do your cause no good when you can only defend it by lying. Of what
&gt;&gt; value
&gt;&gt;&gt; is your Oxfordianism if you cannot defend it honestly? Of what value
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; your presence here to your fellow Oxfordians? Of what value to you
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; your presence here, where you are now known to be a liar?

Still, I agree with Lynne, and I just told her so: the Strachey letter

I apologize. Again I rely too much on off the cuff memory. Will have to
research more thorougly the archives and be more precise. It wasn't
you. It was Knave. Here's the quote. July 2, 2002

&quot;He grew up in the countryside, so it seems to me common sense
that his consciousness would be permeated with the natural world.
Even in London, there is no reason to suppose that people didn't have
gardens.
They don't have to be &quot;vast grounds&quot;, they can be flowerpots scattered
here and there.&quot;

To which I replied;

&quot;Since Davis is a neurosurgeon he may be in a better position to
evaluate how advanced Shakespeare's knowledge is, or whether or how
easily it could have been obtained. But atleast you are consistent as
to my previous remarks. The idea that someone could learn intimately
about flowers and use that knowledge metaphorically from &quot;flower pots&quot;
scattered in London, or learn about the pia mater in a bar seems
ludicrous and again falls into the &quot;idiot savant&quot; , &quot;snap, snap&quot;
theory of acquisition.&quot;

Sorry again.

Ken

I think you might also start asking yourself (right) what is the payoff
for the level of vitriol that constantly gets expressed in posts like
this? You could have said, &quot;Are you sure its me? Check and see if you
have me confused with someone else. I'd prefer if you were more careful
and precise before posting attributions.&quot;

I doubt Xrob, who is just as committed as you but generous in his
responses would act this way.

Webb confronted me often about anger management. Does this &quot;get you
off&quot;? Is this how you treat associates around you? Even those who
disagree with you? Are you this contemptuous of everyone in your
personal life? Is your opinion of yourself that inflated? If this
behavior is some &quot;high point' in your life, I feel truly sorry for you.

I'll be more careful in the future because the level of pathology here
is so great.

I stand by my criticism of Ross. He tried to have it both ways. I
accept the correctness of the stricter argument, I said that. Does the
loss of &quot;Polus&quot; change the larger argument in a major way? If you
believe there is no basis for argument, then nothing matters. If you
believe the discussion is pertinent, then it is not nearly fatal.

My criticisms of Stratfordians is that similar mistakes as Ross pointed
out, as well as other egregious pieces of &quot;scholarship&quot; go on all the
time. Kathman's Strachey piece most likely is one of them. But the
level of hypocricy and double standard from orthodoxy is noxious.

Ross admitted in the same piece the possibility that Polonius was
partly based on Burghley. Therefore there is a basis for debate beyond
a dismissal of half a paragraph. Terry is trying to pull a sleight of
hand.

&gt; Partly true but you just couldn't contain yourself, so you wrote a

Your rooting interest in Oxfordianism may to some extent impair your

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Let's take a closer look. The preview is technically correct : &quot;For
&gt; fifty years Oxfordians have contended that strong evidence that the
&gt; character Polonius in Hamlet was based on Lord Burghley is that
&gt; Burghley's nickname was &quot;Polus...&quot; but your essay does not follow this
&gt; logic.

"/>

The essay is broken into clearly marked sections, and there are internal
links to those sections at the very top of the essay. The sections are

# Introduction
# &quot;Polus&quot; in Gratulationes Valdinenses
# &quot;Polus&quot; in Oxfordian Myth
# Conclusion
# Works Cited

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; It is axiomatic in composition that the purpose of the paper be
&gt; displayed early, often in the first paragraph or two. Here is your first
&gt; paragraph.

"/>

How to be clear without sounding patronizing? Ken, the section marked
&quot;Introduction&quot; is meant to serve as an, um, &quot;introduction&quot; to the essay.
I'm sorry if the word &quot;introduction&quot; misled you. The introduction has two
(count 'em, two) paragraphs, and BOTH paragraphs are part of the
introduction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&quot;Anyone who wishes to argue that the works we know as Shakespeare's were
&gt; actually written by Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford,
&gt; faces the problem that no contemporary ever credited Oxford with writing
&gt; so much as a line that is now generally credited to Shakespeare.
&gt; Oxfordians must look elsewhere for evidence, and they have sought it in
&gt; verbal parallels between the works of Shakespeare and Oxford, or in the
&gt; fact that some of the verse forms used by one were also used by the
&gt; other; they have even argued that Oxford's reputation as a poet was so
&gt; great that he must have been Shakespeare. Unfortunately for the
&gt; Oxfordians, the alleged evidence for their arguments cannot stand up
&gt; under scrutiny. The most common argument is that Shakespeare's works are
&gt; somehow &quot;about&quot; Oxford's life. One point that Oxfordians raise
&gt; repeatedly is that since some critics have suggested that the character
&gt; of Polonius in Hamlet may owe something to Lord Burghley, Hamlet himself
&gt; must have been Oxford's self-portrait. In an op-ed piece that appeared
&gt; in the Washington Post on March 21, 1999, David Ignatius embraced a
&gt; hoary Oxfordian myth when he said, &quot;The officious, advice-giving
&gt; character Polonius may have been based on Lord Burghley (whose nickname,
&gt; it happens, was 'Polus').&quot;

&gt; To reiterate: after a bunch of dismissal you &quot;declare&quot; the main point:

&gt;&quot;The most common argument is that Shakespeare's works are somehow
&gt;&quot;about&quot; Oxford's life. (your words) One point that Oxfordians raise
&gt; repeatedly is that since some critics have suggested that the character
&gt; of Polonius in Hamlet may owe something to Lord Burghley, Hamlet himself
&gt; must have been Oxford's self-portrait.&quot;

"/>

No, that is not the &quot;main point&quot; of the essay, as you would know if you
were a more careful reader. If you look at that first paragraph again,
you will see that it narrows the focus of attention from what &quot;Anyone who
wishes to argue&quot; for Oxford needs to do, to a particular point made by a
particular person who is arguing for Oxford. Have you never in your wide
lifetime of reading seen an opening paragraph that brought the reader from
a general perspective into the particular issue that will be the focus of
the essay?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; A big topic. Obviously you're going to address this argument.

"/>

That is not what the essay attempts to do. The title of the essay is
&quot;Oxfordian Myths: Was Burghley Called 'Polus'?&quot; -- you should have figured
that the focus of the essay was on whether Burghley was indeed called
&quot;Polus.&quot; The first paragraph of the two-paragraph introduction moves from
the general (the first word is &quot;Anyone&quot;) to the particular (the last word
of the first paragraph is &quot;Polus&quot;). That is not an accident, but I don't
mind if people don't notice all the architecture of the piece; still, even
you would not have missed the point if you were a more careful reader.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In fact later on you actually *concede * that Polonius may have partly
&gt; been based on Burghley, so now the argument may be one of degree not
&gt; kind.

"/>

No, the point of the essay is to examine the Oxfordian myth that Burghley
was called &quot;Polus.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Perhaps you're going to contend with many of the elements of that
&gt; discussion, for example how offensive is the epithet Hamlet gives
&gt; Polonius &quot;Jephthah&quot;, how degrading is it to skewer a caricature of one
&gt; of the Chief officers of the state, insulting him soon after his death,
&gt; how intimate is the insult, how much does the Ophelia-Polonius-Hamlet
&gt; triangle echoe the Devere-Burghley-Anne Cecil relationship, especially
&gt; in emotional tone, how startling are the parallels between the specific
&gt; concerns Burghley expressed for his son Thomas in Paris in private
&gt; letters compared to the advice Poloinius gives Reynaldo-things like
&gt; that?

"/>

That is not the essay I wrote, and that is not the essay that the reader
is promised in the title, or in the first paragraph, or in the second
paragraph, or anywhere in the essay. When you read an essay in the
future, try reading the essay that is written.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Since you brought it up as a central declarative statement regarding the
&gt; purpose of your essay.

"/>

No, the purpose of the essay is to examine the Oxfordian myth that
Burghley was known as &quot;Polus.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Again: &quot;The most common argument is that Shakespeare's works are somehow
&gt;&quot;about&quot; Oxford's life. (your words) One point that Oxfordians raise
&gt; repeatedly is that since some critics have suggested that the character
&gt; of Polonius in Hamlet may owe something to Lord Burghley, Hamlet himself
&gt; must have been Oxford's self-portrait.&quot;

"/>

At the risk of repeating myself -- the first paragraph narrows the
(astute) reader's focus from the general to the particular. By way of
contrast, the last paragraph moves from the particular (the &quot;Polus&quot; myth)
back to the general: &quot;Given this pattern, the 'polus' myth is not an
isolated instance but is representative of the carelessness and lack of
scholarship without which Oxfordianism could not exist.&quot;

Did you get that much? Begin with the general, and move by the end of the
first paragraph to the announced focus of the essay. In the second
paragraph, outline the argument and the means of examination. In the body
of the essay, give the evidence and develop the argument. In the first
paragraph of the two-paragraph conclusion, recapitulate the particular
argument. In the final paragraph of the conclusion, broaden the focus
once more.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Instead, you move off on a tangent:

&gt;&quot;In an op-ed piece that appeared in the Washington Post on March 21,
&gt; 1999, David Ignatius embraced a hoary Oxfordian myth when he said, &quot;The
&gt; officious, advice-giving character Polonius may have been based on Lord
&gt; Burghley (whose nickname, it happens, was 'Polus').&quot;

"/>

No careful reader would see that as a tangent; rather it brings the reader
to the particular focus announced by the title.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; This myth is not in the portrayal but in the nickname &quot;Polus&quot; and
&gt; instead of putting what you perceive to be bad scholarship and the over
&gt; use of this factoid in some perspective to the core issue you have
&gt; stated, you energetically (as usual) begin a huge deconstruction of
&gt; Oxfordian failures regarding this term.

"/>

It is not a &quot;deconstruction&quot; (a word whose signification appears foreign
to you) but an analysis. I look first at the source material claimed by
Oxfordians -- Gabriel Harvey's *Gratulationes Valdinenses* -- the ONLY
place where Oxfordians claim the purported nickname &quot;Polus&quot; was ever used
for Burghley. I discuss every instance of &quot;polus&quot; in Harvey's volume. In
NONE of them is it used as a nickname of Burghley.

Having established that there is no merit to the claim, I then sketch its
history. Now, I could have sketched the history first and discussed
Harvey later -- any careful reader should have been able to deal with
either structure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Now, was Ignatious *wrong* to claim &quot;The officious, advice-giving
&gt; character Polonius may have been based on Lord Burghley...&quot;

"/>

Ignatius was wrong to say &quot;whose nickname, it happens, was 'Polus.'&quot; Note
that Ignatius is not sure that Polonius WAS based on Burghley (the careful
reader will not have noticed Ignatius's &quot;may have been&quot;), but he offers as
a fact of history that Burghley's nickname was &quot;Polus.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your last paragraph reveals your true intention and what should have
&gt; been the lead in, but even here you cannot help dodging the larger
&gt; argument.

"/>

There is no dodging whatsoever, as any reasonably capable reader can
judge. The title promises a look at the Oxfordian myth that Burghley was
called &quot;Polus.&quot; The essay delivers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&quot;The question whether Burghley was nicknamed &quot;Polus&quot; is, of course, a
&gt; minor one.&quot;

"/>

It is indeed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Really, you just spent a gazillion words and your reputation to make it
&gt; a major issue.

"/>

No, I wrote a few thousand words exposing the myth and sketching its
history. I don't know what you mean by my &quot;spen[ding my] reputation,&quot; but
I did sign the piece, as is my habit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&quot;Even if the Oxfordians had been correct, that would not have
&gt; strengthened their case.&quot;

Ross says: &quot;How to be clear without sounding patronizing? Ken, the
section marked
&quot;Introduction&quot; is meant to serve as an, um, &quot;introduction&quot; to the
essay. I'm sorry if the word &quot;introduction&quot; misled you. The
introduction has two (count 'em, two) paragraphs, and BOTH paragraphs
are part of the introduction.&quot;

The word &quot;unctuous&quot; comes to mind. Ross enjoys the full definition for
his oily style, fat and greasy, of a smug soapiness, nothing sincere,
it's a trademark of his.

&gt; research more thorougly the archives and be more precise. It wasn't

&gt;&quot;He grew up in the countryside, so it seems to me common sense
&gt; that his consciousness would be permeated with the natural world.
&gt; Even in London, there is no reason to suppose that people didn't have
&gt; gardens.
&gt; They don't have to be &quot;vast grounds&quot;, they can be flowerpots scattered
&gt; here and there.&quot;

&gt; To which I replied;

&gt;&quot;Since Davis is a neurosurgeon he may be in a better position to
&gt; evaluate how advanced Shakespeare's knowledge is, or whether or how
&gt; easily it could have been obtained. But atleast you are consistent as
&gt; to my previous remarks. The idea that someone could learn intimately
&gt; about flowers and use that knowledge metaphorically from &quot;flower pots&quot;
&gt; scattered in London, or learn about the pia mater in a bar seems
&gt; ludicrous and again falls into the &quot;idiot savant&quot; , &quot;snap, snap&quot;
&gt; theory of acquisition.&quot;

&gt; Sorry again.

You mean in the same manner you wrote, &quot;I believe it was Reedy, if I'm not
mistaken, who said that Shakesperare's extensive knowledge and use of
grdening images came from looking at flower pots in London?&quot;

I could have sworn you wrote, &quot;Reedy once claimed that Shakesperare's
extensive knowledge and use of grdening images came from looking at flower
pots in London.&quot; And then after Bob questioned you, you wrote, &quot;Fine. Could
have. Either way The ludicrous nature of the statement doesn't change for
me.&quot;

Your entire representation of what Rob said was warped. First you invent
something somebody said, then you attribute it to the wrong person, then you
snicker about how ludicrous the comment -- which you invented -- was.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I doubt Xrob, who is just as committed as you but generous in his

&gt; Webb confronted me often about anger management. Does this &quot;get you

I thought you were going to be more precise. What makes you think those who
accept the traditional and scholastically-accepted attribution of
Shakespeare's works are diseased?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I stand by my criticism of Ross.

You would, because it is obvious you don't understand his argument.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He tried to have it both ways. I
&gt; accept the correctness of the stricter argument, I said that. Does the
&gt; loss of &quot;Polus&quot; change the larger argument in a major way? If you
&gt; believe there is no basis for argument, then nothing matters. If you
&gt; believe the discussion is pertinent, then it is not nearly fatal.

&gt; My criticisms of Stratfordians is that similar mistakes as Ross pointed
&gt; out, as well as other egregious pieces of &quot;scholarship&quot; go on all the
&gt; time. Kathman's Strachey piece most likely is one of them. But the
&gt; level of hypocricy and double standard from orthodoxy is noxious.

"/>

That's because you don't really understand what the standards are.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Ross admitted in the same piece the possibility that Polonius was
&gt; partly based on Burghley. Therefore there is a basis for debate beyond
&gt; a dismissal of half a paragraph. Terry is trying to pull a sleight of
&gt; hand.

No, he's not. He set out to destroy an Oxfordian myth, and he did it.
Unfortunately, it's like trying to kill the Hydra.
