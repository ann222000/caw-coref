Abstract
AIM:
To compare the anti-inflammatory properties of butyrate with two other
SCFAs, namely acetate and propionate, which have less well-documented
effects on inflammation.
METHODS:
The effect of SCFAs on cytokine release from human neutrophils was
studied with ELISA. SCFA-dependent modulation of NF-κB reporter
activity was assessed in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line,
Colo320DM.
Finally, the effect of SCFAs on gene expression and cytokine release,
measured with RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively, was studied in mouse
colon organ cultures established from colitic mice.
RESULTS:
Acetate, propionate and butyrate at 30 mmol/L decreased LPS-stimulated
TNFα release from neutrophils, without affecting IL-8 protein release.
All SCFAs dose dependently inhibited NF-κB reporter activity in
Colo320DM cells. Propionate dose-dependently suppressed IL-6 mRNA and
protein release from colon organ cultures and comparative studies
revealed that propionate and butyrate at 30 mmol/L caused a strong
inhibition of immune-related gene expression, whereas acetate was less
effective. A similar inhibition was achieved with the proteasome
inhibitor MG-132, but not the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. All SCFAs
decreased IL-6 protein release from organ cultures.
CONCLUSION:
In the present study propionate andbutyrate were equipotent, whereas
acetate was less effective, at suppressing NF-κB reporter activity,
immune-related gene expression and cytokine releasein vitro. Our
findings suggest that propionate and acetate, in addition to butyrate,
could be useful in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, including
IBD.

Leptin is an adipose-derived hormone that regulates a wide variety of
physiological processes, including feeding behavior, metabolic rate,
sympathetic nerve activity, reproduction, and immune response.
Circulating leptin levels are tightly regulated according to energy
homeostasis in vivo. Although mechanisms for the regulation of leptin
production in adipocytes are not well understood, G protein-coupled
receptors may play an important role in this adipocyte function. Here
we report that C2–C6 short-chain fatty acids, ligands of an orphan G
protein-coupled receptor GPR41, stimulate leptin expression in both a
mouse adipocyte cell line and mouse adipose tissue in primary culture.
Acute oral administration of propionate increases circulating leptin
levels in mice. The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids required
to stimulate leptin production are within physiological ranges,
suggesting the relevance of this pathway in vivo.

Utilization and/or Synthesis of Valeric Acid during the Digestion of
Glucose, Starch and Cellulose by Rumen Micro-Organisms in vitro1, 2,
Jack H. Cline, T. V. Hershberger3 and Orville G. Bentley
Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station, Wooster

Abstract

The composition of the carbohydrate substrate in the in vitro rumen
fermentation was found to influence the concentration of valeric acid
present in the medium at the end of 30-hr, experiments. Little or no
valeric acid was synthesized when cellulose was the carbohydrate
substrate or, alternatively, the ultilization exceeded the rate of
formation under these conditions. Likewise, if valeric acid was added
at the start of an experiment, the final level was only 40 to 60% of
the amount added initially. However, 2-10 mg. of valeric acid per 100
ml. of the in vitro medium was found in flasks containing a
carbohydrate mixture composed of 1/3 to 1/2 starch with cellulose
making up the remainder. Furthermore, valeric acid added to the
starch-
cellulose medium at the start of the experiment did not appear to be
utilized by the micro-flora.

Rumen organisms grown in a medium deficient in urea nitrogen appeared
to synthesize valeric acid; however, as the level of added nitrogen
was increased the level of valeric acid in the flasks decreased. This
change in valeric acid concentration was accompanied by an increase
in
the amount of cellulose digested and in the content of
trichloroacetic
acid-insoluble nitrogen in the flasks, suggesting that as microbial
growth increased the rate of valeric acid synthesis decreased and/or
the rate of utilization increased.

I wonder how much undigested high urea / meat .. makes it to the ..
caecum .. ?

&quot;Ammonia concentration in the caecal digesta&quot;

http://www.gcnm.com/pic005.htm

Transit time

The longer the transit time, the longer the toxic waste matter sits in
the bowels, allowing proteins to putrefy, fats to become rancid, and
carbohydrates to ferment.

Low Fibre Diet or Slow Transit time

Food Transit time of a person on a typical Western (Low fibre) diet.
Average Transit time is 65-100 hours!

High Fibre Diet or Proper Transit Time
Food Transit time of a person on a High fibre diet.
Average Transit time is 20-45 hours.

http://www.galensgarden.co.uk/herbivores/health/dietary.php

The wall of the caecum is designed to pick up the digestible nutrients
in small pockets and to concentrate the indigestible fibre into the
centre through muscular contraction. Indigestible particles are sent
down to be processed into hard waste droppings and the digestible
ingredients fermented by the good bacteria in the caecum into amino
acids (protein), fatty acids (energy) and B vitamins.

http://www.veggiehealth.org/page14.htm

The larger undigestible matter present in fruits and vegetables
provides bulk which enhances the forward passage of undigested waste
matter from the caecum to the rectum and anal canal. It also reduces
the transit time from caecum to rectum. This prevents stasis of
poisonous end-products of digestion and resulting diseases of the
colon.

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1378831

Abstract
We have previously shown that infusion of triglycerides and long chain
fatty acids into the ileum of humans and rats delays small bowel
transit time. The present studies have investigated the effect on the
stomach to caecum transit time of a baked bean meal of the ileal
infusion of 20 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM acetic, butyric, hexenoic, and
caprylic acids in rats.  Acetic acid (20 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM), butyric
acid (100 mM), and caprylic acid (100 mM) produced a significant
acceleration of transit which was inversely proportional to SCFA chain
length.

http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/127/1/130

Fructooligosaccharides, oligofructose and XOS have been shown to be
indigestible by human enzymes in the small intestine, but are
extensively fermented in the large bowel (Hidaka et al. 1986, Mitsuoka
et al. 1987, Okazaki et al. 1990) to SCFA which can be absorbed and
metabolized by the host.

http://tinyurl.com/2a6y3j

ABSTRACT:
Inulin and oligofructose caused a significant increase in the SCFA
content produced in the whole caecum.
Cellulose as well as fructans decreased the ammonia concentration in
the caecal digesta .

Research was conducted to determine the physiological effect of
substituting 5% of maize starch with cellulose, inulin and
oligofructose in the diet of rats. The feeding of cellulose and
fructans did not influence the food intake and weight gains of
animals. The addition of oligofructose and inulin induced an
enlargement of the caecum (wall and digesta). Dry matter and pH of
caecal digesta were significantly decreased in rats receiving fructan
preparations compared to the cellulose and starch groups. Inulin and
oligofructose caused a significant increase in the SCFA content
produced in the whole caecum (calculated per 100 g BW). Cellulose as
well as fructans decreased the ammonia concentration in the caecal
digesta compared to control rats. The diet composition did not have a
significant influence on the concentration of glucose, triglycerides
and total cholesterol in the serum of rats. Compared to the control
and cellulose, the investigated fructans were very efficient by
inducing beneficial changes in the functioning of the caecal
ecosystem.

&gt; &gt; ah, the favorite saying of  E. Joseph Cossman :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just make sure he don't .. eat .. it ..

&gt; &gt; Joe doesn't eat anything anymore, hasn't for a number of years now :(

&gt; &gt; For all that he knew, I'll bet he never discovered EM  (efficient microbes)

&gt; &gt; That's what we're talking about,... eh?

&gt; &gt; I found this piece of fairly old research immensely helpful:
&gt; &gt; &lt; http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=169573&amp;pageind; ...&gt;

&gt; &gt; They are the digesters in the gut, the &quot;good flora&quot; that break down starches /
&gt; &gt; soluble fiber into the short chain fatty acids? They are beneficial microbes,
&gt; &gt; helpful in most every arena of healthful living. They are miracle workers when
&gt; &gt; transforming compost and soil into highly fertile humus.

caecum .. ?&quot;

Wonder as you might, it does not explain the source of the short chain
fatty acids in question.

What is the source of this class of them?

What effect leptin on iron status?

Questions still unanswered:

1. what is the primary source of short chain fatty acids for humans?
All attempts at answers to date failures.

2. what effect on iron status of leptin?
No attempts to answer to date.

Sorry, this is not the class of short chain fatty acids referenced in
your original post and the reason this thread continues.

This doesn't answer the question of what in that class is the major
source in humans.

It does reveal however the level of your knowledge/ignorance on the
topic.

Do you want to try again?

Don't forget the second question still outstanding:

What effect leptin on iron status?

Tuberculosis Therapy
Data on tuberculosis therapy described by researchers at Ohio State
University, Department of Microbiology

November 6th, 2007

(NewsRx.com) -- A report, 'Expression and localization of hepcidin in
macrophages: a role in host defense against tuberculosis,' is newly
published data in Journal of Leukocyte Biology. &quot;Hepcidin is an
antimicrobial peptide produced by the liver in response to
inflammatory stimuli and iron overload. Hepcidin regulates iron
homeostasis by mediating the degradation of the iron export protein
ferroportin 1, thereby inhibiting iron absorption from the small
intestine and release of iron from macrophages,&quot; scientists writing in
the Journal of Leukocyte Biology report.
&quot;Here, we examined the expression of hepcidin in macrophages infected
with the intracellular pathogens Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. Stimulation of the mouse RAW264.7 macrophage cell line
and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages with mycobacteria and IFN-
gamma synergistically induced high levels of hepcidin mRNA and
protein. Similar results were obtained using the human THP-1 monocytic
cell line. Stimulation of macrophages with the inflammatory cytokines
IL-6 and IL-beta did not induce hepcidin mRNA expression. Iron loading
inhibited hepcidin mRNA expression induced by IFN-gamma and M. avium,
and iron chelation increased hepcidin mRNA expression. Intracellular
protein levels and secretion of hepcidin were determined by a
competitive chemiluminescence ELISA. Stimulation of RAW264.7 cells
with IFN-gamma and M. tuberculosis induced intracellular expression
and secretion of hepcidin. Furthermore, confocal microscopy analyses
showed that hepcidin localized to the mycobacteria-containing
phagosomes. As hepcidin has been shown to possess direct antimicrobial
activity, we investigated its activity against M. tuberculosis. We
found that hepcidin inhibited M. tuberculosis growth in vitro and
caused structural damage to the mycobacteria,&quot; wrote F.B. Sow and
colleagues, Ohio State University, Department of Microbiology.

The researchers concluded: &quot;In summary, our data show for the first
time that hepcidin localizes to the phagosome of infected, IFN-gamma-
activated cells and has antimycobacterial activity.&quot;

Sow and colleagues published their study in the Journal of Leukocyte
Biology (Expression and localization of hepcidin in macrophages: a
role in host defense against tuberculosis. Journal of Leukocyte
Biology, 2007;82(4):934-45).

&quot;Hepcidin regulates iron homeostasis by mediating the degradation of the

from the small intestine and release of iron from macrophages,&quot;
scientists writing in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology report.&quot;

Yup, this research is really taking off.  The role of this substance
controls the level of iron in humans within a rather narrow range.

This is the 3rd such post mr. justice has made this week, another on the
list of the iron hall of shame.  That list contains posts at his own
hand which refute the iron causes all disease because people eat meat
notion.

Iron levels are controlled in humans which cuts off the leg of the iron
notion stool that says the body increases iron stores willy nilly
without control.
