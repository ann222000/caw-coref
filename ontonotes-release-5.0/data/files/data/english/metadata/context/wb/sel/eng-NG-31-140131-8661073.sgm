How many years do the real fans need to waste before Buffalo starts a
proven vet instead of a long term project?

Which year is Lossman going to become better than what we HAD in
Bledsoe?  10 years from now?

Even retired, Bledsoe has more wins than Lossman in the last 3 years.
Retired, Bledsoe has the same number of wins and 3 less losses.  ROTFL

Learning has not occured.  Again.

Funny thing is, Edwards came into today's game and put up numbers just
like JP.  Just to spell it out for the slow, Trent, with no NFL exp
facing one of the best teams in the NFL put up the same numbers as the
&quot;project&quot; with 4 years NFL exp. and most of the reps in practice.

Lossman in not the only problem on the Bills, he is just ONE of
them.

Funny how the knobbers like stan, doc, bender and kraputski all
avoided my bet in the offseason?

A decade full of knob blunders and they still won't admit their
stupidity.  Amazing.  They must be loyal Bushies.

It's not totally lost.  If Brian Moorman never punted another ball this
season, he would still get a trip to Hawaii as the AFC punter in the Pro
Bowl.
