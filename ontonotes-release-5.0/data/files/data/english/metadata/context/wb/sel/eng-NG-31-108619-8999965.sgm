Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
October 5, 2007

JAXA performed the lunar orbit injection maneuver (LOI1) for the
&quot;KAGUYA&quot; (SELENE) at 6:20 a.m. on October 4, 2007 (Japan Standard
Time, JST.) As a result of the orbit calculation after the maneuver,
we
have confirmed that the KAGUYA was injected into the following lunar
orbit.

Injected orbit: Apogee altitude 11,741 km, Perigee altitude 101 km

The satellite is confirmed to be in good health.
We are now pleased to be able to report to you that we have safely
delivered messages and signs that were collected from 412,627 people
around the world through the Wish upon the Moon Campaign and engraved
on
the sheets to be aboard the KAGUYA to the Moon. We would like to
express
our profound appreciation to all perticipants and hope your continued
support to the KAGUYA mission.
