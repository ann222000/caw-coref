&quot;Reports of missing persons [in the United States] have increased sixfold in
the past 25 years, from roughly 150,000 in 1980 to about 900,000 this year.
The increase was driven in part by the country's growing population. But the
numbers also indicate that law enforcement treats the cases more seriously
now, including those of marginalized citizens.

An astounding 2,300 Americans are reported missing every day, including both
adults and children.

But only a tiny fraction of those are stereotypical abductions or
kidnappings by a stranger.

For example, the federal government counted 840,279 missing persons cases in
2001. All but about 50,000 were juveniles, classified as anyone younger than
18.

The National Center for Missing Adults, based in Phoenix, consistently
tracks about 48,000 &quot;active cases,&quot; says president Kym Pasqualini, although
that number has been bumped up by nearly 11,000 reports of persons missing
after this year's hurricanes.

In a phone interview, Pasqualini said a breakdown of the 48,000 cases
reveals the democratic nature of America's missing persons.

Slightly more than half-about 25,500-of the missing are men. About four out
of 10 missing adults are white, three of 10 black and two of 10 Latino.

Among missing adults, about one-sixth have psychiatric problems. Young men,
people with drug or alcohol addictions and elderly citizens suffering from
dementia make up other significant subgroups of missing adults.

About half of the roughly 800,000 missing juvenile cases in 2001 involved
runaways, and another 200,000 were classified as family abductions related
to domestic or custody disputes.

Only about 100 missing-child reports each year fit the profile of a
stereotypical abduction by a stranger or vague acquaintance.

Two-thirds of those victims are ages 12 to 17, and among those eight out of
10 are white females, according to a Justice Department study. Nearly 90
percent of the abductors are men, and they sexually assault their victims in
half of the cases.&quot;
