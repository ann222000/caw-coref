Where can I get ring tones from other than Verizon?

I don't want Verizon to get my ring tone money. I see offers all over
for free ring tones. Somehow I feel that if I sign up, I get obligated
to recieve messages from these people. Messages that I pay for.

Specifically I would like to get the sounds from the tv show 24.
Rigntones and the ticking clock.

I have bought exactly 4 ring tones. In a weak moment I went to buy a
new Henrrix tone. At $2.99 I decided on the 4 for $10. I got a new
phone a couple of weeks ago and found out that I paid for expensive
pieces of songs that I could not transfer to my new phone.

Again, I have been afraid to get tones from elsewhere. Anyone got any
ideas?

Thanks.

If you are computer savvy and own a Motorola phone...

1) Purchase Motorola Phone Tools via Amazon for $7.29

2) Do a "SEEM" edit
(look here: http://mark.cdmaforums.com/V710_SeemEdit.htm )

3) Take an MP3 or WAV file and edit it to work for your phone
(look here: http://www.ninetoez.net/moto/maketones.html )

4) Upload the MP3 file to your phone

I did this for my V325 phone. Worked great. But I only recommend this
if you really know what you're doing. Its not easy - but the results
are great.

Upload pictures and ringtones to your phone. Verizon doesn't let you
do this - but with the knowledge, you can do it and tell them to shove
it! :-)

I have the LGVX8600 and I just edit a song and send it to my phone via
email and save the sound as a ringtone. Doesn't cost a cent since I
have the $10.00 unlimited pix/text.

I have the same phone, how do you edit the song,  I can figure out the
e-mail part, but I was able to rip and move songs to the micro card with my
laptop and win XP, but not sure about editing one.

I started this thread trying to find out how to buy ring tones and if
buying from other providers opens me up to phone spam.

I don't see any way to make a ring tone go from my computer to my
phone and actually ring.

So, where can I go to get a tone and download it to my phone and get
it cheaper or free.

I have this nagging suspicion that if I go to a company and get a
ringtone sent to my phone that I will be victimized by text messaging.
I seem to remember that if I am doing business with a company that the
do not call list does not apply. So, if I inquire about an interest
rate from a company I can get phone calls and I cannot stop them.

So I am thinking that if I buy or get a free ring tone that I will be
spammed by the people that give me this great deal.

OR

How the heck do I get a ring tone into my Samsung SCH A 990?

I have the cable for the music software from Verizon. I tried bitpim
and it did not work with my phone. My son did something in a hidden
directory and put a song in there and it doesn't work and cannot be
deleted.

I like the phone and I like the reliable Verizon service but I hate
the way that they try to keep getting every penny possible out of me.
So I don't give it to them.

Sorry to ramble on but I am getting frustrated.
