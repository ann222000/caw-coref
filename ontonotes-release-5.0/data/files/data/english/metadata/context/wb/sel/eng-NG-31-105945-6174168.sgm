I'd be on for Slade tomorrow (Wednesday) night. I'll be coming from
Bray direction around the M50 and I can give a lift if someone wants
one (only got space for my own + one other bike). What time are people
meeting there?

Oisin.

nice one Ciaran, glad you enjoyed it
..and that was one of the trickier spins, so if you enjoyed that, then
there's a lot more fun to come
in case you are thinking about it Slade valley tonight will be overall a
good bit mellower, except for one section, which is optional (but
mandatory for longer term MAD folk, ahem!)

Thanks

Hi Paul,

First off i'll say that if you're a total beginner it'd be better to
join one of the beginner spins we hold regularly on saturdays as its
easier to show people what they're supposed to be doing in the
daylight. We also prefer if people come out during the daytime first
as it'll give us an idea of whether you'll be able for them or not.
(most likely you'd be fine but we prefer to know this for certain).

We do have various levels of night time spins .. sometimes fast
sometimes slower but its not really something you should attempt until
you have at least been out a few times suring the daylight.

You do need a set of proper off road lights as well, not just the sort
of thing you'd use for commuting (there are some threads on the
mtbireland.com forums talking about night lights. you can get more
info there),

As regards the bike .. you'd be much better off with a proper mountain
bike as you generally use a much smaller frame for mountian bikign
then you would for road bikes or hybrid bikes. It would also be built
to withstand the abuse whereas a hybrid would not be so i would not
guarantee that it won;t fall apart at some point, having said that you
could certainly get away wiht it on a beginners spin or two (wiht the
right tyres on it) before deciding whether or not you want to buy a
proper mountain bike..

Hope this helps,

Paddy
