Word was requested for certificate for flag flown over Capitol; U.S.
Rep. Turner helps family fix omission.

DAYTON - - The inscription on the certificate accompanying the flag
that had flown over the United States Capitol was supposed to be a
personal message from 17-year-old Andrew Larochelle to his
grandfather, a veteran and a devout Catholic.

Andrew requested the certificate say, &quot;This flag was flown in honor of
Marcel Larochelle, my grandfather, for his dedication and love of God,
Country and family.&quot;

But, the Acting Architect of the Capitol, Stephen T. Ayers, censored
&quot;God&quot; from the request.

&quot;I was completely shocked at the way things played out ... faith is
very important to our entire family,&quot; Andrew said.

Andrew, who will be honored today for his 11-year effort to become an
Eagle Scout, plans to present the flag to his grandfather during that
ceremony.

&quot;A lot of what I learned about faith comes from him,&quot; Andrew said. &quot;I
never expected such controversy over getting my Eagle Scout rank.&quot;

The flag request was made by Andrew's father, Paul Larochelle, through
the office of U.S. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Centerville, who on Saturday
gave the family another certificate, written just as they requested.

&quot;Our Nation's Capitol contains many religious references including &quot;In
God We Trust&quot; inscribed in both the House and State chambers,&quot; Turner
wrote in a letter of complaint to President Bush. &quot;The architect's
policy is in direct conflict with his charge as well as the scope of
his office and brings into question his ability to preserve a building
containing many national religious symbols.&quot;

Turner said Bush is currently in the process of appointing a new
Architect of the Capitol.

Too bad no mention was made of Jesus Christ.
