Hi!

When restoring older bikes like 70's Bultacos, Maicos, Huskies, etc,.
if you take the motor apart the the one thing ya can't find is a
gasket kit.  Not talking top end here, I mean cases out..

I imagine ya gotta make them manually but how do ya do that?  Any
links?  Or telling me how?

Thanks for your help!

Go to the auto parts store, pick up a roll of gasket paper.  Available in
differnet thicknesses.

Easy copy 1:  Use the old gasket to trace a new one.

Easy copy 2:  Put the case on an inkjet copier.  Cut a piece of gasket paper
to copier paper size.  Turn the contrast way down, copy the side cover.  Cut
the gasket based on the printed copy.

For any gaskets, laying the paper over the case &amp; gently tapping with a
small plastic mallet will cut the edge with the case.  For cutting the bolt
holes, take a steel ball that is larger than the hole, lay it in place, and
tap with a hammer, allowing the cases to cut a perfect circle.

Good luck.

lightly grease the surface you want the gasket on then use the case like a
rubber stamp and stamp it onto a gasket then carefully cut out the print
with a box cutter or exacto knife...

they also make gasket cutters that are sort of like protractors with a knife
blade in one end... or like this
http://www.tdcgaskets.com/pages/gasket%20cutters%20and%20supplies/All...

some shops have a plotter with a cutter blade in them that can cut gaskets
up for you on the spot provided they have the proper dimensions programmed
into the machine....

I have a mail order business that does just what you want.  Check out
www.MotoGaskets.com The website is still under construction, but I have
access to almost 10,000 gasket templates and can make them on demand.
Sure beats cutting them by hand!

Sorry for the spam, I only do this when someone asks.

I love tests.

The 2007 200 XC lists 5 different thicknesses of base gaskets. I can
only supply the .5mm or .75mm thickness gaskets.  I get 8 bucks for a
base gasket.  Honestly, for a modern bike a dealer with stock is a
better way to go.

I specialize in 60's, 70's, and 80's vintage and evolution motocross
bikes (I started riding in the 60's) and am working on getting up to
speed on street bikes from the same time period.  I DO have gaskets for
the more esoteric modern bikes (Gas Gas, ATK, Husaberg, modern Huskys)
which sometimes prove hard to come by.  And if you need restoration
advice, I probably can help you find the right source or offer my
condolences. :-)

I was referring to another thread where I was trying to determine
which thickness I should go with on the first top end on that
bike...

Just wondering... if somebody gave you an old gasket from a bike which isn't
already in your database, can you scan that baby in there? Vector graphics
or something? Is there a scanned file format that mortals can make and send
to you via interweb?
Just wondering, nothing leaky right now.

Yep, if you have the old gasket, I can get it scanned and into the database.

Odds are if it is for a bike of Oriental persuasion, I already have a
template for it.  I go back to 1962 on Hondas, 1963 on Yamaha, 1966 on
Kawasaki, 1969 for Suzuki.  Hell, if you have an Indian Chief or a
1930's model Harley, I have those too!  I even have gaskets that will
make Brit bikes quit leaving spots in the garage.
