Compared to these roads and trails, the Mokie Dugway is a parkway.

Enjoy!

I had not seen very many pictures of Bolivia's road to las Yungas, but I
knew of it's bad reputation.  I have been on a bus on a Bolivian road
that looked like that, a shelf road, but it had almost zero traffic, and
the road was dry  Our biggest concern was that the bus would break down
in the middle of nowhere.  Well, I guess we were a bit concerned when
the bus turned around on a wider spot on the shelf road.  ;-)

I understand that the locals make offerings to the Gods before they
drive the Yungas road.  Some of the local expedition outfitters offer to
take you down there in 4WD SUV s, which is probably safer than a bus.

It looks like one of the hazards of the Yungas road is the relatively
heavy traffic, and the need to get close to the edge for two vehicles to
pass.

We have shelf roads in Colorado as well, but generally not with a lot of
traffic.  You get used to it, driving along with a 100 foot drop off and
no guard rail.  I think that there may be some shelf road with no
guardrail between Ouray and  Durango in Colorado, the Million Dollar
Highway.  The guardrails interfere with plowing.  Of course, in
Colorado, roads like that may have snow and ice on them.  The Million
Dollar highway has monuments for some of its victims, including snowplow
drivers caught by avalanche, and a clergyman and his family.

The Bolivian Road of Death has a 1 hour show on the History Channel.  It's
on the same list of shows that covered the Old Route 66.

I heard that same advice at Lackland but one day our flight was asked
for a volunteer to type supply forms and I held up my hand.  I had no
idea what the rest of the flight would be doing but they were detailed
to spread dirt and rake it level WHILE it was raining.  Meanwhile typing
supply forms was a learning experience in a cozy environment.

Besides, I already knew how to rake dirt.

I've traveled roads like that...when I was a pipeline inspector. It looks
like a pipeline right of way in the Canadian bush.
