OK, so it's really just one potted plant on my back porch,
but that's the only garden I have.

Both have a more natural look that the others.  The first has a 3D quality.

Great stuff!

Cheers,

The first one really does have a 3D quality to it!  Both give the
viewer the feeling of being right there.  The color is very natural
and true-to-life.  Very vibrant.  The bokeh is a beautiful creamy
color. Fantastic work, Bret!
It must feel like living in an enchanted forest!

LOL!  Now why would I want to do that?  Am I in the business of

Can you imagine D-Mac's answer if someone asked him to &quot;give away&quot; his
work for free?  He'd go crazy at the thought of someone downloading
his pics to use on their computers without him getting paid.
Hell, he might even go down to the Magistrate on Monday morning and
swear out a warrant!

You only have glance a Glen's warbirds to discover the answer to that.
Mick's footy pic's aren't to shabby either ...and then there's the
occasional shot for Russell to wet your pallet for what you can achieve with
a little knowledge gained quietly.

Most of these are technically challenging shots at the best of times yet
these fellows get them without cropping the shit out of their pics and
yelling about how good they are or find the need to make up some absurd (and
childish) name for their cameras and bash up on anyone who critisizes their
work.

If you seperate the trolls and bullies from aus.photo, loud and offensive
people like Bret could learn a lot about good photography from aus.photo...
But then he know it all, doesn't he? Just ask him and he'll tell you in 250
words or more, how good he is.

Actually it's not such a bizarre request - it's very hard to find high quality
graphics of that size, most walls are 1280 or at most 1600... and blowing them
up makes a mess since they are usually poor jpegs.

If you ever need a favor from me just post here!

Three points:

What claims have I ever falsified?  I usually post complete EXIF data
with my pics.  Are some of them cropped?  Of course, is that now a
crime?  Do I use Photoshop to improve them?  Fuckin-A!

So what's your point?  My point has always been to demonstrate what
kind of results an amateur like me can get from certain equipment.  I
don't have the very best equipment so we may never know what I could
do with that. Others with similar equipment may even get better
results (not you, of course).

That crappy Panasonic P&amp;S taht D-Mac leeps touting doesn't even
compare to a decent DSLR from any manufacturer.  In fact, it doesn't
even compare to Canon's own P&amp;S models, which are some of the best out
there.

I have a friend who owns one of those Panasonics (a FZ-30, I think).
Someday I'll get it and do a real comparison showing just how sucky it
is compared to my Canon DSLRs.

I have never EVER claimed to have posted an unaltered image since it
is impossible to do.  Even JPG files straight from the camera have
been altered by decisions in the conversion process.  So if you are
bitching about altering images then please don't reference any pic
posted to the internet.  Stick to slide film, but don't scan them or

Hmmm, &quot;...on subject...&quot; What subject are you talking about? Still
haven't quite figured out what you are so pissy about. The use groups

just have people who have no life and want to hassle others. Noon's I
haven't seen any of your images here nor any on the Pbase site that
this group uses for the project shoots. Like hard water, strength, and
many, many other PHOTOGRAPHIC endevers.
So why are you so mad? Why is it that you can not talk in a civil

Just a simple question asked politely and with respect. Any answer

&gt; with? It shouldn't be too hard to work out how? Can you read
&gt; and write or do you need Brett for that also?

&gt; &gt; When you swear and call people
&gt; &gt; names, it just causes arguments and bad feelings.

&gt; Amazing! Did you come up with that all by yourself
&gt; or did you ask for help? Oh BTW: it's bad feelings
&gt; exactly what I want to elicit.  Perhaps that will sink
&gt; in, given that plain English is proving too hard for
&gt; you imbeciles?

&gt;  &gt; The newsgroups are

&gt; &gt; free and open to all,

&gt; Let's see if you can grasp this concept once and for all,
&gt; you stupid BITCH:

&gt; They are not free and open to all for ANY purpose.
&gt; I don't give a rats arse if you are from the US,
&gt; Outer Mongolia or Brett's-arseland, it's got
&gt; NOTHING to do with this and you and anyone else
&gt; can post anywhere, if on subject.

&gt; But if you persist in cross-posting to aus.photo
&gt; every single one of your stupid private life posts,
&gt; you will get this reaction from me every single time
&gt; and NOTHING will stop that from happening.

&gt; If you want to post  about photography
&gt; in aus.photo and only to aus.photo, you are most welcome.
&gt; But if your posts are all about your relationship with Brett and
&gt; cross-posted there, then do not complain about the results.

&gt; Because you are in violation of every single most
&gt; basic rule of Usenet and how to use it.

&gt; &gt; and to try to segregate the aus.photo group is
&gt; &gt; very discriminating.

&gt; the only one here discriminating is you and
&gt; your lot.  You have been told very clearly
&gt; that you should post on topic of aus.photo
&gt; and not cross-post from everywhere else to
&gt; here.

&gt; you persist in pushing your silly off topic
&gt; cross posts here, you pay the price.
&gt; Simple, really.

">

You? offer advise to me? ROTFL at that one.

Was that before or after you posted a tiny selection of my client's proof
shots with disgusting and insulting comments on a site your forged my name
and used my identity to create?

Maybe it was when you invited all the Internet's scum to make even more
disgusting comments? Or perhaps it was when you created site after site
after site and duplicated your pathetic display of jealousy that you offered
me advise?

Maybe you offered me advise after you pasted (another stolen image) of a
couple of homo's sucking each other's dicks over a picture you pinched from
Margie's web site and had your Canadian witch post links to it?

Perhaps you offered me advise after I exposed your attempt to hack into my
eBay seller account? Could you be a little clearer about the value of your
advise?

Before you continue with what's shaping into a lead up to further criminal
activity by you, I suggest you take 10 deep breaths and put your dick back
in your pants.

Paying out on someone you know you'll never need to see face to face is a
cowardly deed. Take a long look at your disgusting antics of the past and
ask yourself ... Why on earth would anyone be jealous of a pathetic, loud
mouthed Bragard like you?

Have a look mate, at what a laughing stock you are making of yourself. A
washed out golf caddie who's new job is hash slinging...  WOW! A
photographer too!

If you had a grain of photographic ability you'd stop this ridiculous dick
measuring routine of yours and put up or shut up. See how you'd cope with
watching your &quot;beautiful photos&quot; get auctioned for less than you paid to
make them. It's called the &quot;Acid test&quot; and the first step in realizing being
able to use a computer to dose up your pictures is not going to fool fine
art buyers.

Then you might take a lesson from those of us who've been there and done
that and still manage to make a living selling their work and then you might
learn how to get some respect from people who manage to do what you so
desperately want to but still can't after all these years of trying.

As it is, you've got camera one step up from a P&amp;S that takes such poor
quality pictures, you have to spend hours repairing them with Photoshop
before you dare show them to anyone. This is not photography so don't try
and tell another photographer how to imitate your idea of good.

Get your sorry arse out of Aus Photo and leave it to Aussies. You bastards
do enough polluting here when you send your rusting hulks to intimidate us -
which they don't. YANKEE GO HOME!

Did it ever occur to you Helen, that even though we speak a common language,
there are cultural differences you are not taking into account here?

Australia culture is way more conservative than American. We frown upon the
verbal pollution you and Bret are creating. Seeing as this is an AUStralian
news group, not an International or  RECreational photo group... You should
recognize our country's conventions and expectations, behaving accordingly.

Neither you nor Bret bothered with this simple bit of ethicality polite
protocol. What you see as good fun is highly offensive to other
nationalities and when you start posting your pollution to a country
specific news group with no recognition of that county's cultural and social
expectations, you are the outsider's.

You are the ones doing the insulting. You are simple not wanted here and
have no rights here. Why do you try to defend your unwanted activities?

Being asked to stop cross posting your pollution and you not doing it. Can
only result in a verbal slanging match that escalates into defamation and in
your case, (as demonstrated in the past) illegal activity as you (wrongly)
try to defend your &quot;right&quot; which doesn't exist in this group ...to post
whatever you like.

Whatever level this thread escalates to, is the direct fault of a couple of
people from different countries, refusing to acknowledge their impolite
invasion of this country specific group. Why don't you try your stuff in an
Italian group and see what happens?

So I'll ask you now... Would you please get your sorry ass out of this group
with your unwanted verbal pollution?

Come back when you have something related to AUStralian PHOTOgraphy to
discuss and you'll be accepted here. Otherwise you are just another hostile,
unwanted alien invader. Sort of like a verbal Iraq situation.

The plain and very simple fact of the matter is that when I answer a post, I
have to send it to everyone that is on the header line of the post I am
answering. Otherwise, it may not reach the person that I am answering. So,
unless I am expected to memorize all the Usenet groups of everyone on earth,
I have little choice but to post to everyone in the header. This seems to me
to be a very simple concept. - I don't know why some other posters don't
seem to be able to grasp it.
Now, should I initiate a first-time post, and send it to multiple
groups, then I can understand why some people would be offended. This kind
of posting is generally called, &quot;spamming&quot;, and is a tool used primarily by
people who are advertising their products, or using Usenet to sell some idea
to people in general, rather than sticking to one subject of interest to a
particular group. I have never personally done this, even though some of the
things I post on might be of interest to more than one group. Even if I knew
exactly which of several different groups the original poster was sending
from, if I want my answer to be seen by all who saw the original question,
then I am forced to send it to all the groups listed in the header. If it
were not for this, then Usenet would be a chaos of disconnected answers that
stood by themselves without any recognizable questions, so nobody would know
what the hell they were doing
This is an imperfect world....Some people should get used to it, and
just learn to live with it.
