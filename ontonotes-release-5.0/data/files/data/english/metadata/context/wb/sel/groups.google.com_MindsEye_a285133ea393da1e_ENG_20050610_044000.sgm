Katy has made a very interesting point. When we talk about intolerance we tend to think about cases like the general that said that muslims were idolaters, or the Guantanamo people that mistreated the Koran. In the last century, more or less, it has become fashionable to respect peoples, cultures, beliefs. You shouldn´t mock any of them. The exception is us. The only culture you can deride is the Western one. And you can be intolerant about Christianity, specially about Catholicism. There has been a lot of talk about paidophilia among the Catholic clergy, but the same has happened in several countries in public, secular schools. In Mexico there´s an outcry right now because the new Interior Minister is a very devout Catholic. The Inquisition is at our doors! is the claim. Many of his predecesors, however, were deeply intolerant men. Against Catholicism. Some government officials in Spain have uttered very intolerant views. But they were anti-Catholic, so that´s all right. I´ve read a lot of quotations of books published a long yime ago, and I wonder if they´re of any but historical interest. Scholars like Renan and Wellhausen have been treated as if they were Scripture, and scientific progress dethroned them, not for religious reasons, but because they were mistaken.

There's a far greater history of anti-semitism than anti-catholicism.
I get the sense though that alot of religious people (including some
jews btw) tend to cry and moan about how much people discriminate
against them, and generally they greatly exagerate. We live in very
tollerant times. Things aren't perfect, but they never will be.

Agreed. Political correctness has given alot of people the
misconception that they have the right to not be offended (No Kari,
not aimed at you). Removing Christmas displays from schools because
some people were offended at the Christian idealogy connected to the
holiday is just ridiculous, and that is only one example.

I actually totally agree with you. We have the right to act on the
offense (in this case, leave the group), but all Americans should know
that being offended occassionally is part of living here. (If you're
offended, argue or leave, but for the love of God, DON'T SUE!!)

On a related topic, I am unconvinced that &quot;tolerance&quot; is a virtue.
Tolerating various ethnicities or religions is appropriate in my view,
but I don't find every lifestyle choice equivalent, good, or worth
tolerating. We've gone to an extreme in this nation.

The thing with virtues is that they are only truly good if they are
truly good when taken to an extreme. Can you be too honest, too pure,
too peaceful? In their true form, no, but can you be too tolerant?
Sure you can --- and if you are tolerant to an extreme, you tolerate
genocide, pedophilia, etc. That's not very virtuous.

Not to get to far off topic, but I disagree that removing Christmas is
an issue of not being offended. Assuming we are talking about public
schools, its an establishment clause issue, and one that I think is
very serious.

Hey Kari, et al, :-)
When it comes to the subject of virtue (and tolerance for example),
however, I would say that some degree of resilience is required, the
deeper understanding of the basis of the virtues one upholds, and
living by them insofar as they gauge the 'virtuosness' of their deeds
and actions by analysis and reason.
Resilience: &quot;re·sil·ience ( rĭ-zĭl ' yəns ) n. The ability to recover
quickly from illness, change, or misfortune; buoyancy&quot; or for example,
on may say that they shall not lie, but if to protect someone who is
knowingly innocent hiding in their home from the authorities a
dictatorship, say, not telling the truth to the authorities on the
whereabouts of the innocent person is a virtuous deed even though they
may have apparently contradicted their virtue of truthfulness. (heh,
one could also say that all lies are true - there are millions or way
to justify things and such justification is the reasoning of many
criminals who commit crimes repeatedly and just don't seem to 'get the
idea' - however we all know beaurocratic ideas of the day are still
not totally - or should I say far from? - something that is virtuous)
- another way to look at resilience is to tell you that if I told you
that if you followed rules 'A', you are a resilient person, and you
followed them to the letter, then you have just proven yourself to not
be resilient, if you follow what I mean ;-).
- Sorry if I stray slightly from the topic, and yes, I agree with
Chris on what he said about Political Correctness.

intolerance is something that has happened for ages, is based mainly on
ingnorance and prejudice. as long as there is ingnorance it will breed
prejudice, and there will be religious intolerance, racism and hate
crime.
the muslim intolerance of any other religion is a driving force in
terrorism today; hand in hand with ignorance and hatred of our way of
life. many of these terrorists were indoctrinated at a very young age,
and told that we are the enemy.
your faith and belief system was, more likely than not, based on what
your parents believed. this is not true for everyone, but applies to
most. many things are passed on from generation to generation. values,
and beliefs are among these things.
it is not written in stone that you will believe as your father did,
or if your father was a racist, so shall you be. but the point is, you
cannot make people raise their children in a way they do not find
suitable. you do not have the right, to tell a parent what values he
can and cannot instill in his children.
the bottom line, is if we tell people they cannot be intolerant of a
religion, and cannot be racists, then we have lost what america stands
for. i am not advocating racism or relious intolerance, let alone
violence. they all sicken me. i am, however, advocating EVERYONES right
to live and die how he decides, to believe how he chooses, and raise
his children and instill the values that he/she sees fit.

Yes Larry this is indeed what people have fought and died for. Heh
even if it means I don't like it. Free will, and the right to act as
you will is truely important. So what you actualy advocate is
tolerance, in the way that we have to tolerate even that which we
disaprove off.

The only problem then of course is how far to take tolerance? We
cannot of course tolerate, as Kari says genocide(even though in this
day and age we seem to be doing just that), we can of course tolerate
Catholisim ;~) though, and any other personal choice that does not
conflict with the laws of the land, heh and probably we can even
tolerate some that do conflict with some laws.

This topic though seems once again to be heading towards that old
chestnut morality/ethics. A sticky subject as we all know.

When it comes to the issue of tolerence, however, the question is why
should we tolerate everyone's free will? What if we know someone to,
for example, be training a squad of pyromaniacs or something, or
suicide bombers for that matter, I mean - where do we draw the lines?
Besides, in the case of raising children, the same child has the right
for chosing what they take as right or wrong and if they are raised in
a certain manner then whats right and wrong will become defined in
terms of their language as well as the surrounding culture. Some form
or guidelines need to be established that prevent free will becoming
total stark insanity - however, then again what is it that tells us
something is specifically right or wrong? What you may define as
acceptable may not be so for others, for example, in some East African
tribes, drinking blood is totally normal behaviour - and they'd find
it strange that someone won't join them when they're doing so,
possibly even find it rude. And we consider that as rather barbaric
behaviour - and some of us may consider it spiritually or morally
wrong, spiritually because blood is a form of the 'life force' of a
creature and so the mingling of it into another would be considered
unacceptable.
There are other examples for that matter, some tolerable, some not,
and where exercising tolerence is at the risk of allowing someone to
implant in a child's malleable mindset that it is their goal to become
a suicide bomber, say, that tolerence is far from tolerence but is in
fact ignorance. The child has no idea and the manipulator is merely
being 'accepted' and his 'beliefs' (though highly hypocritical) are
being 'tolerated'. Yes, Tolerence and Understanding are highly
important virtues, but so is standing up against what is, &quot;wrong&quot; and
make sure that what is &quot;right&quot; is accepted - this then boils down to
what is right and wrong? and how do you define it? probably - is it
definable at all? or is it something intuitive?
Okay, I've shed my boredom in this computer lesson at school, I'll get

On where to draw the on tolerance, I think that ever-wise philosopher Bill
Hicks has something to say:

&quot;My final point about alchohol, about drugs, about Pornography...What
business is it of your's what I do, read, buy, see or take into my body as
long as I don't harm another human being whilst on this planet? And for
those of you having a little moral dilemna on how to answer this, I'll
answer for you. NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS. Take that to the bank, cash
it and take it on a vacation outta my fucking life.&quot;

Which I can only agree with. As long as your actions or beliefs don't harm
another human being, I have no problem with anything.

Ian,
That sounds very libertarian of you. I tend to agree with this
viewpoint, but there is one hangup I have with it. How do we know
which of our actions will harm others and which won't? Or more
specifically, How do we know which of our actions will violate someone
else's rights and which won't?
We'll use drug abuse as an example. Let's imagine that a pregnant
woman is abusing a drug (be it marijuana, or alcohol, it doesn't
matter). Is she hurting anyone else? Well if you consider her baby to
be a somebody else then yes. It doesn't matter what your stance is on
when the baby actually becomes a person because the baby is a potential
person, no one would argue with that. Or let's say a father is abusing
alcohol and he comes home every night and beats the heck out of his
wife and kids. The father is only directly harming himself by taking
alcohol into his body, but indirectly it's harming his family. These
are only examples, there are other examples which would not be so clear
but still examples of how one's actions could harm another that on the
surface look to be only harming the individual. What do you think?

Hi Craig,

Both examples do not conform to the Hicksian (I just coined that) notion of
not harming another human-being.

The mother who harms her child by drug abuse is in violation of it because
her actions clearly harm a 3rd party.

The drunkard, through abusing his own body and mind, directly enacts
violence upon another human-being.

Hicks would object to both, as do I.

Even if the result is someone being hurt indirectly (say a drink driving
related accident) it is still wrong.

Now you could argue that by injecting heroin, for example, you are
indirectly funding a corrupt regime or terrorism... well, that's a tougher
one.

Let's take it even further down the scale......Does it do harm to anyone else to smoke marijuana while being employed? I don't mean &quot;on the job&quot;. I mean even after hours. If one is unable to give 100% at work because of something they do &quot;after&quot; hours, isn't that causing harm?

argue with my girlfriend a lot, then I won't be doing my best work come

On the other side of that, I am employed a creative and I would say smoking
pot can take me to some interesting, otherwise inaccessible, places of my

Ian,
The reason I gave the examples I did is because they are clear
examples. I could think of examples that were not so clear. The point
is, our actions are so interconnected with the welfare of others that
it's hard to say which actions harm only ourselves and which ones harm
others.

Because it is such slippery slope, we tend to conform to the mores of
the majority. Our modern, highly twisted concept of tolerance is the
opposite of that, and is due in large part to the cultural guilt the US
carries for the highly discriminatory practices of its past. It used to
be that when people immigrated here to become citizens, they were
encouraged, and in some ways required to learn the language, adapt to
the culture, often americanize their names, etc. Now, we are so
&quot;tolerant&quot; of multi-culturalism that we have replaced our &quot;melting pot&quot;
concept of cultural evolution with a seperatist approach that allows
and encourages people to not integrate into mainstream american
culture, causing further divisiveness. This same tolerance causes the
abomination of a holiday known as Kwanzaa to be held in higher esteem
and given more room in schools (at least in this state) than
traditional American holidays such as Christmas and Hannukah, in the
name of &quot;redressing&quot; sins of the past. Because &quot;tolerance&quot; and
&quot;diversity&quot; are pushed so incredibly hard, people can make up a
history, heritage, and culture, and demand that it be celebrated, and
we do.

Chris,
I lived in Canada for two years, and while I was there, the big
complaint they had was that America is a melting pot of cultures,
whereas Canada is a &quot;salad bowl&quot;. But now that you bring it up, I
think they are wrong. I think we are just as much a salad bowl. The
difference being though, I do not see this as a good thing. Culture
can be a good thing, just as long as you don't turn it into a moral
issue. What do we mean now when we say &quot;We're proud to be Americans&quot;.
What does it mean to be an American? I think it's our loss when we
lose our culture to avoid offense.

right and wrong is a matter of which side you are on. its a point of
view, a decision based on you belief system. there is no black and
white to the issue, as some tend to believe. there are however, social
norms; these norms generally dictate what is considered 'right' or
'wrong.' many of these are universally accepted, murder, theft,
marriage, and many other concepts are exhibited in almost every culture
as either acceptable or unacceptable.
almost every religion tends to believe that there's is the ONLY
correct one. so, for these zealots what they are doing is 'right' and
they are supported by those of their faith, even encouraged sometimes
to commit acts of violence, in the name of God.

"/> What culture has USA ever had other than a &quot;salad bowl&quot;? Ever since the
very beginning we have been divided into groups whose interests
ostensibly conflict - radical protestants, enlightenment economic
liberals, greedy profiteers, african slaves and their descendants. The
&quot;melting pot&quot; was a myth that masked an uneasy truce. The cultural
elements we are supressing now in the name of tolerance, namely the
radical protestant and confederacy elements are regarded as the most
dangerous of American subcultures and were growing in influence in the
last century. Because cultural differences usually imply moral
differences, I don't see much hope for a genuine &quot;American Culture&quot;
anytime soon.

I don't believe the melting pot was a myth. During the heavy
immigration that occurred during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, there was a strong push for 'Americanization'. Much of what
we consider Americana was created during that time (baseball, hot dogs
and cracker jacks, god mom and apple pie).

There was somehting of a melting pot, inasmuch as people who didn´t belong
originally to the mainstream culture were encouraged to merge into it. Many
Blacks and Hispanics have done it. It seems strange that people who are
blocking the merging of other Blacks and Hispanics into the mainstream
culture are complaining of their not doing it.

In reading 'The Source' (yes, I know it's fiction, but historical
fiction), it seems that Byzantine Turkey was the ideal of racial and
religious tolerance. In a more war oriented time, inter-country
commerce overcame zealous religious differences.

Why is that not the case today?

There´s no religion that is &quot;chemically pure&quot;, or something like that.
Religion is incarnated in a culture, and the attitudes of the faithful take
a lot from it. the same thing happens to philosophies, of course. Russian
marxism was as it was in a good measure because it was Russian. When a
religion has existed for a very long time and in different lands, you´ll see
that its believers are different from place to place and from time to time.
Muslims were often very tolerant, but then came people from a somewhat
rudimentary cultural milieu, that took a very fanatical way of thinking, and
became fanatical Muslims. Western European isolation led many people to see
anything foreign as suspicious. When it comes to imagining, people imagine
in terms of what they knew. European painters painted biblical scenes as if
they had happened in a European scenery, and asian painters ad if the
protagonists had been asian. They didn´t necessarily believe that God was
European or Asian.

"/> I think it is the case today. As long as the economic motivation to get
along is there. When that economic motivation goes, so does our
tolerance.

The expanding information infrastructure may be to blame for an
increase in tensions. When you have very focussed marketing of
information, there is less incentive to absorb other points of view.

That's why I am not sure about the melting pot and Americana culture -
whether it actually happened or whether it exists only in the media
left behind. I also think we have a very unique culture at this very
moment - as long as you accept that Hispanics and blacks arabs and
asians to a lesser extent (as well as reactionary elements) are driving
the change from the classic &quot;Americana&quot;. I think that this is a more
conflict-driven society, but that doesn't make it any less interesting.

"/> I assume, then, that your kids are quite young? They won't always be
kids however. Hence your first point doesn't really apply; I am
obviously not suggesting 8 year olds take crack for example.

Being the strong advocate that I am on the philosophy of the Dionsyian
society--a lone voicr here amongst all you Apollonian-sorts--I am
staunchly pro drugs. I believe in the stimulation of the senses, the
body, and the mind to transcend the limitations of the conscious mind.

Although I am not a particularly frequent user myself I do think
hallucinogenic drugs have had a hugely positive affect on our culture
and we can reasonably assume that many users' motives/experience in
taking them are likely peaceful and probably consciousness expanding
and educational. Even taking the argument at a very shallow level,
it's recreational fun.

To answer the inevitable question, yes I would encourage my children
to take drugs if I believed them to be of the right mind and
disposition to benefit from them.

..except that they are illegal almost everywhere. The only intoxication
that would be legally available to my kids when they turn 21 where I
live is tobacco and alcohol. These are not mind expanding drugs. There
is some probability that marijuana, which could be classified as a mild
mind-expanding drug, will be legalized and regulated by then. On the
other hand, I'm not about to recommend that anyone smoke anything on a
regular basis. IMO cancer is caused by the process of smoking, not by
what you smoke.

I don't see any other hallucinogenic drugs becoming any more tolerated
in the future, here in USA at least. I think that politicians have a
vested interest in not allowing the minds of the voting public to be
expanded.

Now is intoxication and stimulation and even mind-expansion worth the
risk of a drug charge? Sorry, but I am brainwashed to think naively
that if I do something against the law, even once, I will get caught.

But I guess your point is that I should imagine a world where
mind-expanding substances are legal (or you can't get caught) and safe,
and would I still recommend against using them in such a scenario?
