The AC and recirculate buttons will not stay on. If I jam a coin under the
button they will stay on most of the time, but toggle back and forth.

I reseated the vacumn lines but that had no effect.

It may go days at a time without doing this, and on other days it constantly
happens and that is when I jam a coin under the button to keep it on.

Does this sound like I need to replace the whole climate control unit? Does
it have to be from a Malibu, or can I use an Oldsmobile or Cadillac?

I take it you have a Malibu ...What year is it?
The Control heads are also ways shorting out ...You might be able to use
another one from a different model as long as they have the same part
number....But all in all its your control head going out..

I fixed the controller in my '99 Malibu two years ago and it is still
working great.
Thanks to whoever posted this originally.  You saved me $$$!

How do you get the faceplates, etc off so you can get to the control
unit?

Try reading this document. I did this last night, and it worked. It only
took me about 30 minutes.

I posted a few weeks ago it worked, but rutt row, it started doing it again
the other day, but just not as bad. It made a huge difference and I
recommend it. I might have waited too long, or the hot humid weather in July
in North Carolina is effecting it.
