US: Provide access to detained Burmese
By MICHAEL CASEY, Associated Press Writer
Wed Sep 12, 6:35 AM ET

BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) - The United States has demanded that Myanmar
provide access to scores of activists who were detained following the
worst protests against the military government in a decade, citing
reports that many of them have been beaten in custody.

State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in a statement late
Tuesday that the American government was concerned about the &quot;well-
being&quot; of more than 150 citizens jailed since the Aug. 19
demonstrations began.

&quot;Multiple reports indicate that many of these protesters have been
brutally beaten and interrogated,&quot; McCormack said in a statement. &quot;We
call upon the Burmese regime to allow access to prisoners by
international humanitarian organizations, such as the International
Committee of the Red Cross, and renew our call for the immediate
release of all political prisoners in Burma.&quot;

Myanmar's government is facing worldwide condemnation for its hard-
line handling of the demonstrations, prompted by the governments snap
decision to increase fuel prices by as much as 500 percent in the
impoverished country.

The government and its supporters have detained scores of pro-
democracy activists and launched a campaign to round up those still in
hiding. It also has cut off cellular phone access to dissidents and
harassed their families.

Authorities also have stepped up surveillance of monasteries after
monks - angry at being beaten up for protesting - temporarily took
officials hostage and later smashed a shop and a house belonging to
junta supporters.

Historically, monks in Myanmar, also known as Burma, have been at the
forefront of protests - first against British colonialism and later
military dictatorship. They also played a prominent part in the failed
1988 pro-democracy rebellion that sought an end to military rule,
imposed since 1962. The uprising was brutally crushed by the military.

Myanmar's junta, meanwhile, has pleaded with its citizens to stop
protesting and to instead express their views through a promised
referendum on a new constitution.

Earlier this month, the government wrapped up a 14-year national
convention to draw up guidelines for a new constitution, the first
stage of its seven-step &quot;road map to democracy&quot; that it promised would
lead to elections.

Critics have called the entire process a sham, saying the guidelines
ensure the military a prominent role in politics and bar Nobel
laureate Suu Kyi from holding elected office.

The junta held general elections in 1990, but refused to honor the
results when Suu Kyi's NLD party won. Suu Kyi has been detained under
house for more than 11 of the past 18 years.

US demands access to Myanmar's prisoners amid brutality claims
Tue Sep 11, 6:18 PM ET

WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States demanded Tuesday that Myanmar's
military junta allow international access to prisoners following
reports that many arrested pro-democracy protestors have been brutally
beaten.

More than 150 Myanmar citizens have been detained as the military
launched a violent crackdown on a rare string of anti-government
protests, which erupted on August 19 in anger at a large hike in fuel
prices.

&quot;We are concerned for (their) well-being,&quot; said State Department
spokesman Sean McCormack, referring to the jailed protestors.

&quot;Multiple reports indicate that many of these protestors have been
brutally beaten and interrogated,&quot; he said in a statement.

The United States, he said, called on the junta &quot;to allow access to
prisoners by international humanitarian organizations, such as the
International Committee of the Red Cross.&quot;

Washington also renewed its call for the immediate release of all
political prisoners in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.

Its military generals, who have ruled since 1962, do not tolerate even
the slightest show of public dissent.

Among the latest detainees was Min Ko Naing, considered Myanmar's most
prominent pro-democracy leader after detained opposition leader and
Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

Min Ko Naing and 12 activists were sent to Myanmar's notorious Insein
prison in northern Yangon, home to some of the nation's estimated
1,100 political prisoners. Rights groups say torture is rampant at
Insein.

Amnesty International said the new detainees were &quot;at risk of torture
and other ill-treatment, which is commonly reported during
interrogation and pre-trial detention in Myanmar.&quot;

&quot;The authorities should also ensure that none are tortured or ill-
treated in detention, and provide medical care for those injured
during the violent break-up of demonstrations,&quot; the rights group said
earlier this month.

Several of the detained protesters had launched a hunger strike to
demand medical treatment for a colleague whose leg was broken when he
was arrested after a protest on August 28.

They ended the hunger strike last week after the victim was finally
granted treatment.

UN Calls on Burma To Free Jailed Labor Activists
Wed Sep 12, 9:23 AM ET

BANGKOK, Sept 12, 2007 (AFP) - The United Nations labour agency on
Wednesday called on Myanmar's [Burma] military government to
immediately release six activists sentenced to a total of 152 years in
prison.

Four men were jailed for 28 years and two others for 20 years, their
lawyer said Saturday, after being charged with organising &quot;an unlawful
gathering&quot; -- a workers' rights seminar at the US embassy in Yangon in
May.

&quot;The government should welcome, and not repress, attempts at
exercising freedom of association,&quot; the International Labour
Organisation's (ILO) executive director in Geneva Kari Tapiola said in
a statement.

Myanmar should review and reverse the sentences handed out to the
activists without delay, the ILO, which promotes human and labour
rights, said.

&quot;These kinds of sentences are not only entirely unwarranted. They can
also harm the few processes of engagement that exist, such as the
activities against forced labour,&quot; Tapiola said.

The ILO has said that forced labour is widespread in Myanmar, but it
recently reached a deal with the military regime allowing victims to
file complaints with the ILO without fear of retaliation by the
authorities.

The harsh sentences came as Myanmar cracked down on any form of
dissent after a hike in fuel prices on August 15 sparked rare
protests.

Amnesty International estimates that more than 150 people have been
detained by the junta since the peaceful rallies began, while many pro-
democracy activists have gone into hiding.

Four of the jailed labour activists were former members of Myanmar's
opposition party, the National League for Democracy, headed by
detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

EXCLUSIVE-Myanmar protests &quot;just the start&quot; - top dissident
13 Sep 2007 03:25:11 GMT

BANGKOK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Nearly four weeks of protests in Myanmar
are &quot;just the start&quot; of a mass movement against the ruling junta and
the grinding poverty endured by the former Burma's 53 million people,
a top activist said from hiding. &quot;There is no way this will stop,&quot;
Htay Kywe told Reuters from a secret location inside Myanmar, where he
has been in hiding since evading an Aug. 21 crackdown on dissidents
who launched a rare string of protests against shock increases of fuel
prices.

&quot;Arresting and killing people will not free us from economic
hardship,&quot; the 39-year-old said in digitally recorded answers to
questions e-mailed by Reuters and authenticated by a person known to
be a very close friend.

Thirteen of Htay Kywe's colleagues in the &quot;88 Generation Students
Group&quot; that spearheaded a nationwide uprising against military rule in
1988 have been arrested and accused of terrorism, charges that could
see them jailed for decades.

But Htay Kywe, who managed to elude midnight raids on homes across
Yangon, said the generals who have run the Southeast Asian nation for
the last 45 years would never be able to cover up the reality of
deepening poverty.

&quot;As long as the public are experiencing a lack of development,
economic hardship, authoritarian rule and injustice, there will be,
and will always be, a situation where the public will not accept it
and will fight back,&quot; he said.

More than 150 people have been detained in the current crackdown, one
of the harshest since troops were sent in to crush the 1988 uprising
with the loss of an estimated 3,000 lives.

Although memories of the bloodshed are still fresh in people's minds,
Htay Kywe said increasing economic hardship would fuel the underground
social movement.

&quot;As long as they are unable to solve the troubles the country is in
today, movements like this will never end,&quot; he said. &quot;Like the rising
tide and waves, the military government will be hearing these voices
loud and clear.&quot;

Even as the protests have spread, they have remained focused firmly on
deteriorating living conditions in a country seen as one of Asia's
brightest prospects when it won independence from Britain in 1948 and
now one of the region's poorest.

&quot;AMONG THE PUBLIC&quot;

Countering junta charges he was being &quot;sheltered&quot; by a Western
embassy, Htay Kywe said he was hiding &quot;among the public&quot;.

&quot;We are hiding because we want to continue working hand-in-hand with
the public to show evidence of this military government's untruthful
political solutions,&quot; he said.

Analysts said the fact he and other activists such as Ma Nilar and Suu
Suu Nway had remained undetected for so long suggested the junta's
internal spy networks may not be as powerful or sophisticated as they
used to be.

In particular, they pointed to the 2004 purge of Prime Minister Khin
Nyunt and the dismantling of his Military Intelligence-run network of
informants and secret police.

Despite the latest crackdown, the fuel price protests have spread to
the centre and northwest and have started to involve Buddhist monks,
key players in the 1988 uprising.

The army's firing of warning shots to disperse a crowd of protesting
monks in Pakokku last week triggered an angry response the next day
from monks, who seized 13 government officials and torched four of
their vehicles.

Lone Myanmar protester jailed for four years
12 Sep 2007 05:58:29 GMT
By Aung Hla Tun

YANGON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - A court in military-ruled Myanmar has
sentenced a man to four years jail for a solo protest calling on
Buddhist monks to turn their backs on junta supremo Senior General
Than Shwe, the opposition said on Wednesday.

The man, in his late 20s and identified as Soe Aung, was arrested in
Taunggok, 250 miles (400 km) northwest of Yangon, on Tuesday and tried
and sentenced at a closed hearing within a few hours, the local
National League for Democracy (NLD) said.

He also called for a reversal of last month's shock fuel price rises.

However, Soe Aung's waving of a placard urging the Buddhist equivalent
of excommunication of Than Shwe coincided with reports of some
monasteries demanding a public apology for a junta crackdown on monks
last week.

The threat evoked memories of 1990 when monks refused to accept
donations of food from military officials or their families in protest
at the junta's refusal to accept their crushing defeat at the hands of
the NLD in that year's elections.

Such rejection by monks, who are not allowed to own material
possessions and depend on daily alms for food, is taken very seriously
in the devoutly Buddhist former Burma.

Donations are seen as a means of paying respect to ancestors, atoning
for bad deeds and storing up merit for rebirth.

&quot;Legal action was taken, so immediately he did not have any right of
defence. It could be because of his slogan calling for the expulsion
of the Senior General,&quot; Khin Hla, the NLD's Taunggok chairman, told
Reuters.

&quot;We will do all we can to help this activist. We are now making
necessary inquiries and having discussions with legal experts,&quot; he
added.

Two young protesters arrested in Taunggok last month were released
five days later when 1,000 people rallied in their defence.

At least 150 activists have been arrested in more than three weeks for
protests against shock increases in fuel prices and declining living
standards.

Thirteen leaders of the so-called &quot;88 Generation Students Group&quot; who
spearheaded a mass uprising against military rule in 1988 have been
arrested. Soe Aung appears to be the first dissident to receive an
official trial and sentence.

Families of the 13 still-influential student leaders have appealed to
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to try to find out
where they are being held and get access to them.

Official media have made no mention of the group since their arrest on
Aug. 21 and the United States demanded on Tuesday that humanitarian
groups be allowed to visit those detained following unconfirmed
reports some detainees had been beaten.

&quot;The ICRC has promised to help,&quot; one family member said.

Myanmar has been under unbroken military rule for the last 45 years
during which time its economy has been transformed from one of Asia's
brightest economic prospects to one of the region's poorest
countries.

Myanmar battles dengue epidemic
12 Sep 2007 13:24:00 GMT
Blogged by: Amy Leung

(Reuters) - Five-year-old May May Hlaing came down with a fever on
Tuesday. She started vomiting on Wednesday. Her parents rushed her to
the Yangon Children's Hospital on Thursday morning. She never saw one
of the 17 paediatricians at the hospital who were overwhelmed with the
numbers of children turning up. She died of dengue fever in her
mother's arms before night.

Dengue is caused by a mosquito called Aedes egypti. In some countries
there are control programmes. In army-ruled Myanmar, where more than
half the government's budget is spent on the military, and less than
0.4 percent is spent on health care ($0.50 per person), there is no
such programme. Not surprisingly dengue outbreaks hit the impoverished
country hard and fast.

Throughout Myanmar more than 1000 people a week, most of them
children, were diagnosed with dengue in July, according to government
statistics. However this figure is only for public hospitals. In
Yangon alone there are over 1000 private clinics.

One paediatrician who runs a private clinic in Yangon reported seeing
more than 100 children a day in the first 10 days of August. &quot;I
started work every day at 6am and didn't finish until 11pm. It hasn't
been this bad since the outbreak in 1996,&quot; he says. In 1996, tens of
thousands of people were affected.

The cost of treating dengue is $1.50. The average Myanmar family makes
$1.64 a day. But even if a family is able to pay for tests, the
medicines may not be available. One paediatrician who didn't want to
be identified said medicines were not stockpiled in advance for an
epidemic.

And where are the humanitarian agencies? World Health Organisation
(WHO) held its first coordination meeting on August 3 in Yangon. At
around the same time, the U.N. children's agency UNICEF started
distributing leaflets with information on how to prevent dengue,
identify the symptoms and what to do at the first sign a child has the
disease.

However, the problem is less likely to be one of awareness so much as
a lack of planning and prevention at a larger scale. Governmental and
humanitarian agencies with the mandate, the responsibility, and the
capacity to prevent epidemics such as the current one simply did not
do their job.

You might be surprised that U.N. and international aid agencies are
allowed to work in Myanmar, a country which has been ruled by the
military since the 1960s. The authorities keep close tabs on the
agencies but they can undertake needs assessments and distribute
relief in close coordination with the government.

Dengue is cyclical and surges in the number of mosquitoes carrying the
disease are predictable so it shouldn't be impossible to plan for an
outbreak.

Cases in April and May were nearly double what they were the year
before, official statistics show. In June, WHO's regional office
reported there was a risk of a major outbreak.

But WHO's first coordination meeting to combat the epidemic was four
months after the numbers of children showing up at public hospitals
with the disease started to exceed average levels.

In August, UNICEF received a request from the government for $55,000
to buy pesticides, fumigation equipment, and continue education
campaigns. However, UNICEF and WHO officials said that even if they
had ordered the pesticides and equipment then, it would have been more
than a month, possibly two, before it was available in the country. By
then it would have been October and the rains would have stopped.
Instead, the agencies have decided to focus their efforts on being
better prepared for next year.

If nothing is done and the trend continues, 2007 will be the worst
outbreak in a decade. For the hundreds of children, maybe thousands,
who will have died it will have been too little, too late.

Myanmar protests verge on mass movement
By Larry Jagan

BANGKOK - Popular protests have spread across Myanmar, putting the
authoritarian military government's hold on power to a crucial and
potentially volatile test. The demonstrations that started against the
ruling junta's fuel-price policy now threaten to become a full-blown
mass political movement due to the military's heavy-handed handling of
protesters.

Many political activists are already starting to draw comparisons
between recent events and the pro-democracy demonstrations in1988 that
forced longtime military leader General Ne Win to resign. Mass
protests involving students, civil servants, workers and Buddhist
monks then brought the country to a standstill for months until armed
soldiers brutally crushed the movement and reasserted the military's
hold on power through a coup.

For the first time since those tragic and momentous events, the
military government faces concerted and growing public protests, which
political analysts believe could easily escalate to a popular demand
for the end of military rule. The State Peace and Development
Council's (SPDC's) drive to introduce neo-liberal-inspired economic
reforms, including last month's sudden and unexpected withdrawal of
fuel subsidies, has apparently backfired badly.

Public protests are rare in Myanmar, where the regime maintains strict
social controls. Military leaders apparently did not foresee or plan
for the protests that have attended their shock-therapy policies.
Whether the public anger snowballs into a full-blown mass movement, as
happened in 1988, depends largely on how the historically heavy-handed
regime responds in the weeks ahead.

The violent tactics employed by the regime to quell the protests so
far, however, do not augur well for future stability. Small, peaceful
protest marches have continued for weeks in Yangon, Myanmar's main
commercial city and until recently the national capital.

They have since spread to several other parts of the country,
including crucially the central town of Pakokku, near Mandalay, where
an estimated 100 Buddhist monks recently spearheaded the unrest,
including taking government officials hostage and burning their cars.
The military eventually fired warning shots, and one monk was badly
hurt in the melee.

The junta has long fretted about politicized monks - who command deep
respect among the population and many of whom are known to sympathize
with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest.
Since the early 1990s, the military have effectively controlled the
Buddhist governing religious bodies by retiring, replacing and
relocating known-dissident abbots.

But the recent clergy-inspired violence and the military's violent
response may yet prove to be a watershed moment. The monks have
demanded an apology from the government for its use of force, but to
date junta leaders have failed to reply. In the meantime, in an
unprecedented move, police and security forces have been deployed
outside the monasteries in the key Buddhist cities of Mandalay,
Pakkoku and Yangon to prevent the monks from staging further
protests.

Nonetheless, the monks have expressed their particular concerns about
the government's reported use of armed civilian vigilante groups to
counter and contain protesters. Since the protests erupted last month,
the authorities have arrested hundreds of people. The junta has often
used pro-government thugs to disperse the crowds violently and deter
journalists from recording events.

The vigilantes are known to be part of a pro-government community
group, the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA), which
the regime often deploys to drum up popular support for the junta and
is expected to morph into a full-fledged political party with the
SPDC's promised transition to democracy. USDA vigilantes launched an
assassination attack on Suu Kyi in May 2003, and many of her National
League for Democracy supporters were killed in the violent exchange.

Now the USDA's special security force, known as the Swan Arrshin, is
at the forefront of countering the current protests. &quot;The members of
this group have been especially trained in crowd control and the
violent suppression of protests,&quot; a Western diplomat in Yangon told
Asia Times Online. &quot;We have had reports of its foundation to act as a
security and intelligence wing since the beginning of the year.&quot;

Many former criminals recently released from prison have reportedly
been recruited as vigilantes, according to diplomatic sources in
Yangon. At least 600 convicted criminals were released from Yangon's
notorious Insein Prison in recent months and recruited by the USDA
into the Swan Arrshin, the sources say. The pro-democracy opposition
in Yangon puts the figure at closer to 2,000 members.

&quot;It is the use of these thugs which has particularly upset the
Buddhist clergy. Pitting Buddhist civilians against other Buddhist
civilians disturbs social harmony,&quot; said a senior Buddhist monk in the
central city of Mandalay, who spoke by mobile telephone. &quot;The
government should not condone this practice, let alone promote it.&quot;

Popular protest leaders

The junta has a potentially bigger problem in dealing with the 88
Generation Student group, which was involved in organizing the
original protests. The dissident group's key leaders, including
internationally renowned poet Ming Ko Naing and the charismatic Ko Ko
Gyi, were released from prison two years ago after spending nearly 14
years behind bars and are known to command immense respect among the
local population.

The authorities detained nearly 20 of the group's members immediately
after the first protest and they are being interrogated in Insein
Prison. There have been unconfirmed reports that one of the group's
leaders, Kyaw Min Yu, popularly known by his English nickname Jimmy,
has died in prison as a result of the injuries he sustained while
being detained by armed vigilantes.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has made discreet
inquiries about the prisoners, though no information is available
about their treatment or condition. The regime is acutely aware of the
public sympathy the group's leaders command and as an early concession
released one arrested member who had suffered a broken leg upon being
arrested. At the same time, the government has warned that the other
detained group members face 20-year jail sentences if convicted and
sentenced.

Such harsh treatment could politicize and add new fuel to the fire of
the protests, some analysts predict. It's still unclear whether the
protests are part of a larger political strategy launched by the
dissident group. &quot;They knew they would be detained again and could
face another stiff term in prison,&quot; said one of the group's
supporters. &quot;So they had contingency plans in place for that.&quot;

The authorities have since placed all of the arrested leaders'
families under strict surveillance and are searching for a key member
of the group, Htay Kywe, who is in hiding. On the run, he has become
the public voice of the movement through interviews given to the Oslo-
based Democratic Voice of Burma and e-mail communications with the
international media.

In an e-mail sent over the weekend to foreign journalists, including
Asia Times Online, he disputed the government's accusations that the
88 Student Group is using violence to try to overthrow the government,
and retorted that it is the junta that is using violence as a pretext
to detain the group's leaders.

&quot;We believe that no Myanmar people ... will accept these acts of
political violence by the military government,&quot; said Htay Kywe in the
e-mail. &quot;We, the 88 Generation Students, together with people
including monks, students, workers and farmers, will continue our
efforts to remove the military dictatorship by firmly resisting any
kind of arrest and torture.&quot;

Economic squeeze

Runaway inflation, meanwhile, is causing economic chaos. An unofficial
consumer price index maintained by a leading Yangon-based economic
journal based on a basket of essential commodities showed a 35% spike
in prices as a result of the fuel-price increase.

According to recent United Nations-conducted surveys, more than 90% of
Myanmar's population spent 60-70% of their household income on food.
&quot;These price increases are likely to be the result of speculation and
anticipation, rather than a real increase in costs,&quot; the top UN
official in Yangon, Charles Petrie, told Asia Times Online.

A UN economist based in Yangon, requesting anonymity, said in a recent
interview: &quot;I estimate that now the vast majority of Burmese people
are spending over 80% of their monthly salaries on food.&quot;

As inflation gallops, the potential for widespread unrest, not yet at
the tipping point, is growing. Already more people are living without
permanent shelter on Yangon's streets, many of them workers who have
day jobs but cannot afford to travel from home and back, a Japanese
businessman and regular visitor to Yangon recently observed.

Laborers who live in poor areas on the outskirts of Yangon - after the
government razed their slums and relocated them there in 1988 in a
policy designed to depopulate the national capital - are now walking
to work rather than paying higher transportation costs. &quot;Many workers
are taking more than an hour and a half to walk to work,&quot; said an
economist, a Myanmar national based in Yangon. &quot;Some even spend up to
three hours walking to their factories.&quot;

UN officials believe the policy will in time impact adversely on
public health conditions - which because of low government spending
were already abysmal. &quot;Malnutrition will increase as a result&quot; of the
policy, said a UN official. &quot;While people will not starve, there will
be a slow increase in deaths from diseases which should not be
terminal - it will especially affect children and the elderly.&quot;

The majority of people are not yet so deprived that they are willing
to risk joining the protests. But tensions are bubbling away under the
surface, which could be accentuated in the weeks ahead, particularly
if rice prices were to surge. Heavy rains and flooding in Myanmar's
rice bowl this year means yields and supply could be substantially
reduced compared with recent years - providing yet another source of
inflationary pressure.

&quot;The current protests are still economic,&quot; said Khin Ohmar, a leading
activist based in Thailand with close links to protest organizers. She
said she believes it's only a matter of time before the protests
become political. &quot;Everyone recognizes that the root cause of the
inflation is the junta's economic mismanagement. By concentrating on
what really concerns people in their daily lives, people will be
encouraged to participate [in the rallies], and that will eventually
generate a momentum for real change - as happened in 1988.&quot;

The dramatic events of August 1988, which likewise were spurred by
economic mismanagement, took months to evolve. In late 1987, the
military demonetized certain denominations of the local currency, the
kyat, which wiped out many people's savings overnight. The initial
peaceful protest marches were suspended after the regime violently
cracked down on them. Three months later, student groups initiated a
fresh series of protests which by August of that year had grown into a
mass movement.

Nearly 20 years later, the military's economic mismanagement and
political heavy-handedness are strikingly similar.

5 Myanmar detainees, 1 M'sian killed in Kedah accident

KUALA LUMPUR - A BUS carrying dozens of illegal immigrants from
Myanmar crashed into a ravine in northern Malaysia, killing five of
them and a Malaysian, police said on Wednesday.

An immigration officer, the driver and 43 other illegal immigrants
were injured - 11 of them seriously - in Tuesday's crash in the
northern state of Kedah, a police officer said.

The dead Malaysian was the driver's assistant, he said speaking on
condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the
media.

Local newspapers published pictures of the wreckage, showing the front
portion of the bus mangled and its roof ripped off - reminiscent of a
crash last month that killed 22 people in what was described as the
country's worst bus crash ever.

Tuesday's tragedy happened when the bus skidded and landed in a ravine
30km after leaving a detention camp. The illegal immigrants were being
moved from that camp to another near the Thai border, the police
officer said.

Tens of thousands of refugees from Myanmar are estimated to live in
Malaysia, which is not a signatory to a United Nations convention on
refugees and classifies them as illegal immigrants who can be
detained, caned and deported.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which is allowed to operate in
the country, currently recognizes some 36,000 refugees, most of them
from Myanmar, but thousands more seek refugee status. -- AP

Myanmar monks threaten new protest of junta

BANGKOK - BUDDHIST monks in military-ruled Myanmar have threatened to
stop accepting alms from soldiers unless the junta apologises for
beating the clergy last week, reports from dissident media said on
Tuesday.

A boycott of alms from soldiers would be a serious protest toward the
military since giving donations to monks is an important spiritual
duty for devout Buddhists.

The Thailand-based Irrawaddy magazine reported that a group calling
itself the 'Alliance of All Burma Buddhist Monks' was distributing a
leaflet calling for the boycott unless the junta issues an apology by
Sept 17.

Exiled dissidents have reported that several new groups of monks have
formed to make similar demands of the military, but it is impossible
to confirm their existence inside the country.

Few monks are willing to speak openly about politics and the military
has cut the phone lines of several key pro-democracy supporters.

Myanmar's influential clergy was enraged last Wednesday when soldiers
and state-backed militia beat a crowd of some 300 monks who were
protesting in the central city of Pakokku, an important centre of
Buddhist learning.

The following day, the monks held a group of 20 government officials
hostage for several hours and then trashed a store and a home
belonging to militia leaders.

The confrontation in Pakokku, about 500 kilometres north of the
commercial capital Yangon, came amid a rare string of anti-government
protests that erupted on Aug 19 in anger at a massive hike in fuel
prices.

The military and the Buddhist clergy are the two most important
institutions in Myanmar. They are the only groups that maintain
networks stretching across the entire country formerly known as
Burma.

Monks were credited with helping to rally popular support for a pro-
democracy uprising in 1988, which was crushed by the military when
soldiers opened fire on protesters, killing hundreds, if not
thousands.

After that uprising, the military held elections in 1990 that were won
by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party. The junta never
recognised the result and Aung San Suu Kyi has spent most of the time
since then under house arrest. -- AFP

Myanmar junta, fearing monks' protests, demonstrates fealty to
Buddhism
The Associated Press
Published: September 12, 2007

YANGON, Myanmar: Myanmar's military government, widely condemned for
its heavy-handed crackdown on anti-government protests by Buddhist
monks, has been making high-profile donations to monasteries, the
state-controlled press reported Wednesday.

The junta's top officials in the central area around the city of
Mandalay donated cooking oil to 102 monasteries, the New Light of
Myanmar newspaper reported on its front page, showing photos of
kneeling officials offering gifts to senior monks. Making donations to
temples is a traditional way of showing respect and making merit.

The move follows a security clampdown on monasteries in an attempt to
keep young monks from joining weeks of protests that began Aug. 19
over high prices for fuel and consumer goods.

The protests are the most sustained challenge in a decade to the
government. More than 100 people have been detained for taking part in
demonstrations, many of which have been broken up by pro-government
toughs.

In northern Myanmar last week, monks - angry at being beaten up for
protesting economic conditions - temporarily took officials hostage
and later smashed a shop and a house belonging to junta supporters.

A nervous government responded by tightening security around
monasteries in major cities, including Yangon, Mandalay and Bago.

Monks in Myanmar, also known as Burma, have historically been at the
forefront of protests - first against British colonialism and later
military dictatorship. They also played a prominent part in the failed
1988 pro-democracy rebellion that sought an end to military rule,
imposed since 1962. The uprising was brutally crushed by the military.

The New Light of Myanmar has made officials' activities at temples its
top front page story two days in a row.

Its report Wednesday said donations of edible oil and cash were made
to monasteries in the Mandalay area by the junta's commander for the
central region, Maj. Gen. Khin Zaw, as well as Minister for Industry-1
Aung Thaung and other officials.

On Tuesday, the newspaper highlighted a visit by a top defense
ministry official, Lt. Gen. Myint Swe, to a senior abbot at a temple
in Yangon.

Monks are highly respected by most people in the predominantly
Buddhist nation, and using force to disperse them has upset the
public.

Companies from four countries to invest in Myanmar cyber city project

Some companies from Thailand, China, Malaysia and Russia will invest
in Myanmar's first prospective cyber city of Yadanabon in the early
phase of its development, local media reported Wednesday.

These companies are Shin Satellite (Thailand), ZTE and Alcatel
Shanghai Bell (ASB) ( China), IP Tel Sdn. Bhd. (Malaysia) and CBOSS
(Russia), the local 7-Day News quoted an official responsible for the
construction of the cyber city as saying.

The Yadanabon Cyber City, Myanmar's new emerging largest information
and communication technology (ICT) park, is nearing completion and two
phases have been set for the opening of the cyber city.

The factories from these foreign companies will be cornerstoned
together with the soft opening of the cyber city in the end of this
month as the first phase, while the full inauguration will follow in
next January as the second phase along with the introduction of an ICT
Week activities and the opening of a National Land Mark near the cyber
city.

The 10,000-acre (4,050-hectare) Yadanabon cyber city project, located
in hilly Pyin Oo Lwin near a highway, 67 kilometers east of the second
largest city of Mandalay in the north, has been under hasty
construction since last year after jungle areas there were cleared.

To attract foreign investment in the cyber city project, Myanmar has
offered to grant both foreign and local entrepreneurs to be engaged in
ICT business in the project to develop the silicon mountain town.

On completion of the cyber city project, investors will be allowed to
directly export their computer accessories produced in the cyber city
and one stop service center, which renders customs and banking
services, will be established for the purpose, according to the media.

It was disclosed that green light has been opened to domestic national
entrepreneurs to buy land for business engagement, while foreign
investors are limited to lease land only for the purpose.

To enable prompt use of internet in the cyber city, various systems
including ADSL, CATV, Triple Play and Wi Max are being installed,
experts said, adding that the present stage before the soft opening
deals with fiber cable installation.

According to the experts, the Yadanabon cyber city stands at a point
where new internet lines linking China, Thailand and India meet.

An airport has been built at the cyber city which is 40-minute- drive
from Mandalay. (Source: Xinhua)

'Myanmar hiding its AIDS/HIV figures'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From Sobhapati Samom
">

IMPHAL, Sept 11 - The Indian officials who have been actively taking
part in HIV/AIDS preventive programmes for the past 15 years have
accused their Myanmar counterparts of hiding their AIDS population.

They shouldn't do that, as this disease is a human tragedy, says an
Indian official who works with an implementing agency of the National
AIDS Control Society.

Even the newly appointed Project Director of Manipur State AIDS
Control Society (MACS) shared the same sentiment during a seminar on
'Role of media intervention in preventing HIV/AIDS and promoting
awareness' held under the aegis of the American Center Kolkata in
collaboration with the All Manipur Working Journalists' Union and
MACS.

When the Indian authorities approached their Myanmar counterparts for
an HIV/AIDS intervention programme either at Moreh or in their own
town of Tamu, the Myanmar officials working at Tamu were even
reluctant to disclose the actual number of the infected or affected
HIV people.

&quot;Most of the time they want to conceal their HIV infected population&quot;
lamented Dr T R Kom of Manipur while giving his deliberation at the
seminar.

According to Dr Kom, as many as two rounds of intervention programmes
were organised in 2005 with much impact in the local populace. A
similar programme is going to be held soon.

Though the Myanmar authorities could not provide the logistic support
and cooperation in the global fight against the dreaded disease, many
HIV people as well as commercial sex workers of Myanmar visit the
Indian NGOs based at Moreh for condoms and syringes which were
distributed free of cost from time to time under the directive of
India's National AIDS Control Society.

Most of the time when Indian authorities approach their Myanmar
counterparts over necessary steps to control the disease, the latter's
response is not encouraging at all. &quot;They may say they have less
number of drug users and others, but when we start organising medical
camps wherein medicines and even condoms are distributed freely, many
of them (Myanmarese) would turn up at the Indian border town for the
opportunity,&quot; said an official.

To contain the disease Manipur has been taking up many preventive as
well as intervention programmes. Acknowledging the situation the
American Center Kolkata decided to hold a daylong seminar so that the
matter relating to the media reporting on the global issue could be
taken up in a better way.

Manipur being one of the six high AIDS/HIV prevalence Indian states,
the state authorities under the sponsorship of NACO have been giving
Anti-Retroviral Treatment to over 3271 HIV/AIDS patients including 257
children out of the state's 25,000 people living with HIV. There are
many unreported cases too.

The American Center Kolkata's Director and Public Affairs Officer
Douglas G Kelly, Rai Baruah, Smt Devaki Nambiar, Fulbright scholar and
fellow of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health attended the
seminar where Manipur's senior journalist Pradip Phanjoubam also spoke
on the role of media in fighting the disease.

Burma's 'constitutional' dictatorship

Burma looks set to create a new form of authoritarian state as the
National Convention has completed a marathon session, drafting
guidelines for its next constitution, which will maintain the
military's central role in government with little or no checks and
balances.

The junta-sponsored National Convention, which started in 1993, ended
its final session in early September with 15 chapters of basic
principles set out for the constitution, which is to be drafted by a
committee that has yet to be named. The timeline for the new
constitution for the military-ruled country remains unknown.

Burma has now completed only the first of the seven steps on its &quot;road
map to democracy&quot;.

Burma has previously had two constitutions: the democratic one of 1947
during the U Nu regime and the authoritarian one of 1974 during the
reign of dictator Ne Win. The current junta, the State Peace and
Development Council, wants its own version to fit new circumstances.

The junta, previously known as the State Law and Order Restoration
Council, called the 1990 election but refused to open the People's
Assembly and hand over power to those who had won the election.
Instead, the junta set up the National Convention three years later to
lay down principles for the drafting of a constitution. Very few of
those elected in 1990 participated in the convention.

Basically, the 14 years of constitution drafting had only two
objectives: barring major opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from
leading the country, and constitutionalising the military's political
power.

The basic principles for the constitution make it clear that Aung San
Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy won a landslide victory
in the 1990 elections, would have no chance to stand as a candidate
for the leadership of the country. Among the qualifications it sets
for the position of state president is a clause stating that &quot;either
of his/her parents, spouse, any legitimate child or the spouse of any
of legitimate children shall not be a loyal subject to any foreign
government or a person under the influence of a foreign government or
citizen of an alien country&quot;.

Aung San Suu Kyi was married to Briton Michael Aris, who died in 1999.
With his death, Suu Kyi could claim that she has no spouse, but her
children could still be deemed loyal subjects of a foreign government.
Even if she could prove that they are not the subjects of any foreign
government, she might still be disqualified for lacking a military
background, as the constitution stipulates that the candidate for
state president should have a vision for military matters, as well as
national, administrative and economic affairs.

It is too naive to imagine that the military, which has run the
country since the 1962 coup to overthrow the democratic U Nu
government, would work itself out of politics. On the contrary, the
new Burmese constitution would provide legal grounds for the generals
to continue holding on to political power.

The guidelines for the new constitution indicate that the military
will be entrenched in every state institution including the union
presidency, the union government, the union assembly as well as
regional and state assemblies.

The Burmese military, known locally as Tatmadaw is essentially
established as an ultra-constitutional organisation. The
constitutional guidelines state that the

Tatmadaw is the sole existing army and that it must be strong and
modern. The commander-in-chief of the army is constitutionally the
most powerful person in the country. The president would appoint the
commander-in-chief with approval of the National Defence Ministry and
the Security Council, but the process for his removal was not
mentioned in the National Convention's adopted guidelines. The
commander-in-chief has complete authority over the armed forces. His
decision is final in matters of military justice. He is not
responsible to any assembly, but he has the authority to pick some
members of the assemblies within the military's quota.
Burma's parliament, which is called Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (Union
Assembly), comprises two assemblies: the People's Assembly, which is
composed of representatives elected on the basis of population, and
the National Assembly, composed of representatives from different
states and regions. Nonetheless, the commander-in-chief has the
authority to pick up to one-fourth of the total number of members in
each assembly. In other words, the military has a quota of 110 out of
440 seats in the People's Assembly and 56 out of 224 seats in the
National Assembly.

Like the Thai military, the Burmese military also believes in
selection rather than election, as Burma's constitutional guidelines
state that the state president of the union (the head of state) shall
be &quot;elected&quot; by the presidential election body, rather than directly
by the population. The presidential election body was formed by
members of the parliament, including those MPs who were picked by the
commander-in-chief of the army. In short, the selection of the top
leader of the country cannot be done without military approval.

Burma's state president is very powerful. The president is authorised
to pick ministers to sit in cabinet, summon an emergency or special
session of the Union Assembly and appoint and dismiss heads of public-
service agencies. The president, in principle, needs to report to the
Union Assembly but he/she &quot;shall not be responsible for answering to
any assemblies or to any courts for the exercise or performance of the
duties and functions vested in him by the constitution or any of the
existing laws or for any of his action in the exercise and performance
of these powers and functions&quot;.

The Burmese military got what the Thai military only dreamed of when
they sponsored the 2007 constitution-drafting process. The Tatmadaw is
able to exercise full power during a state of emergency. The president
is obligated to announce a state of emergency and later transfer
executive, legislative and judicial power to the commander-in-chief,
enabling the latter to take necessary measures to restore the country
to normalcy. All assemblies would be terminated during the emergency.
In practice, the president should refrain from declaring a state of
emergency, as it could dissolve his authority unless he is also acting
as the commander-in-chief of the Defence Force. The constitutional
guidelines do not bar the commander-in-chief from holding the
presidency. In that case, a military leader, in his capacity as the
president and the commander-in-chief, could declare an extended state
of emergency and impose dictatorship for as long as he pleases.

Tharawaddy USDA plans mass rally

Sep 12, 2007 (DVB)-The Tharawaddy Union Solidarity and Development
Association is planning a mass rally in support of the Burmese
military's National Convention, according to residents in the area.

Several Tharawaddy sources told DVB that village leaders from the Bago
district were called to the Tharawaddy Township Peace and Development
Council office yesterday and told to organise 100 people each to
attend a USDA rally at the local football field on September 17.

&quot;They said they needed a total of 10,000 people to attend the parade.
Tharawaddy township and the surrounding villages have to contribute
5000 people while other townships have to send another 5000,&quot; one
resident said on condition of anonymity.

&quot;They told us to prepare our own food for the day and that we are not
allowed to bring beetle nut or drinking bottles. We are also not
allowed to wear hats or caps either,&quot; the resident said.

Another Tharawaddy resident said that village leaders and ward peace
and development council leaders from 21 wards in Tharawaddy and 48
village groups have been asked to help transport people to the rally.

&quot;The gathering is to start at about 6am in the morning . . . Nobody
really wants to go there,&quot; the resident said.

He said many residents resented being forced to go to the rally. The
military's constitution-drafting National Convention, which was
wrapped up at the start of this month after more than 14 years of
deliberations, has been widely condemned as a sham.

&quot;The convention has been done by the government according to their
wishes and decisions. We are not happy to support it,&quot; the resident
said.

Ma-ubin monks go hungry as commodity crisis continues

Sep 12, 2007 (DVB)-Monks from Irrawaddy division's Ma-ubin township
said today that high commodity prices have forced them to start
skipping meals as the impact of the recent fuel hikes deepens.

Nearly 400 monks from the Mahabawdi monastery said that they were
unable to buy enough food to feed themselves and that the number of
alms being donated by the public was steadily decreasing.

&quot;We are skipping breakfast now since we don't have enough money for
rice for all of us. The people here are also struggling and they can't
donate much to us,&quot; U Paneinda, the abbot of the monastery, told DVB.

&quot;We are no longer able to cook for ourselves as we don't have enough
food supplies,&quot; he said.

Monks are highly revered in Burma and news of the food crisis facing
the monastery has sent a shockwave through the community. The reports
have come just days after monks from different areas around the
country took to the streets to protest the government's recent
decision to drastically increase fuel prices.

According to state-run newspapers, the State Peace and Development
Council has donated large sums of money to several high-profile
monasteries around the country since the start of the month.

But U Paneinda said that the government had not given out donations in
Ma-ubin.

&quot;We have read about the donations in the newspaper. But it never
happened here in Ma-ubin,&quot; he said.

Families seek ICRC help to find detained activists

Sep 12, 2007 (DVB)-The families of detained 88 Generation Students
leaders have asked the International Committee of the Red Cross in
Burma for help as they continue to try to locate the activists.

Daw Nyunt Nyunt, the mother of 88 Generation Students leader Pandate
Htun, told DVB today that the families of Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, Ant
Bwe Kyaw, Ko Mya Aye, Pyone Cho and Ko Jimmy have asked the ICRC to
help them find out where the arrested men are being held.

Most of the top leaders of the 88 student group were arrested late
last month for staging several protests over the government's decision
to increase fuel prices by up to 500 percent.

Daw Nyunt Nyunt said that while the ICRC continues to be denied access
to Burma's prisons and detention facilities by the government, the
international rights group has promised to help.

&quot;The ICRC said they were facing difficulties with access but they also
said they would do their best to try to help us,&quot; Daw Nyunt Nyunt
said.

&quot;They asked us to submit a formal letter to them asking for help so we
wrote to them saying that our sons had been detained since August 21
and we want the government to tell us where they are being held,&quot; she
said.

Daw Nyunt Nyunt said several family members of the detained men went
to Insein prison on Monday to find out if the student leaders were
being detained there. She said prison officials refused to give them a
straight answer.

&quot;At first they said our sons weren't there . . . but then they told us
to go to the interrogation centres they were initially detained in to
ask whether or not they had been sent to Insein,&quot; she said.
