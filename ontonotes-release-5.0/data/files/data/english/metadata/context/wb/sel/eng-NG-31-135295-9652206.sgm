Hi Folks,

I might need to rewrite my gadgets do to the way used resources will be
handled in the future.
Seams as i will need to persist a lot more data then currently.
For now i'm thinking about persisting that data through some hidden user
prefs.
So question is, what kind of (quantity) limitations are on user prefs? - ie:
can i have as many prefs as i want? also how long can 1 pref string value
be?

Thanks a lot

Hello,

The UserPrefs (hidden and displayed) combined cannot be more than
approximately 2KB in size (it's actually a little bit less), because
they get passed as part of a URL, and IE limits the length of a URL to
about 2048 characters.  Individual preference can be as much or as
little of that size as you'd like, it's only the combined length that
matters.

I hope this helps.

Best,
Dan

Yep, it helps, thanks.
I was afraid of that exactly...

Any crazy idea how one could persist data within a gadget? :)

Thanks

I've always thought it would be fantastic for gadgets to be able to
access a server-side &quot;data store&quot;. Each gadget could have its own
storage area, be able to save any key/value combination it wants, and
retrieve any or all key/values with an API call. This would allow for
more extensive storage of information and enable more complex gadgets
that may want to analyze trends over time, store user history, collect
data to be analyzed, etc.

Currently doing this either requires that everything stored in prefs,
which is not practical, or the gadget needs to contact an external
server to store its data, which raises security concerns. Having this
built into the API would be fantastic.

It would also be great to be able to access readon-only user
information and preferences. So the user may be able to specify his
favorite color or time zone or whatever, and any gadget that wants to
access that data would be able to do so.

Hey Matt,

The OpenSocial API actually has a data store API that works pretty
much like how you described. There is still a storage limit (of I
think about 10KB per instance-user), but that's a lot larger than what
is available in the core API.

As for read-only data access, the closest thing to this is the ability
to pull information out of a user's profile (in Orkut or the other
OpenSocial containers), but the specific key that the gadget might be
looking for could be available on one container and not another.

Best,
Dan

Matt,

I probably don't need to remind you, but others reading this might not
be aware that functionality analogous to system-wide preferences can
be found in the PubSub infrastructure (see http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/pubsub.html ).

Hm, the Persistence Data API looks like it would fit for my means...
But I'm getting from what i've read that it is not yet available?
Also my &quot;issue&quot; with it is that i'd prefer something more transparent for
the end users.
Like it would be nice for them not to have to authenticate before hand...
Dunno will need to take a better look at it...

Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but I was under the impression
that the max size for a single user preference was ~2K, as this is the
limit of the GET url which is used for setting it.

This thread seems to suggest that the total combined size of all user
prefs in a single gadget is ~2K - is that correct?

Hi Simon,

Yes, that is correct. You're right about the ~2K limit on a GET
request limiting the preference size, but there is only request made
and that fetches all of the preferences along with other information
(which is why less than 2K is allowed for prefs).

Best,
Dan

Apologies for the rather large post...

Well I did a bit of investigation over the weekend, because if the
suggested limitations were true then I believe my gadget would be
breaking (a lot).  From my very (very) crude investigations the 2k
limit doesn't exist in either Firefox or IE7, although I did find out
some other rather worrying limits.

I created a little test gadget ( http://qiladan.shackspace.com/ig/
TestGadget.xml) and the following seems to be true.  I need to add the
caveat &quot;for me&quot;, as Bonstio gets wildly different results for the per-
gadget/tab limits:

1) The maximum amount of combined data for visible prefs per gadget
(pref name and value) is ~1900 characters.  Data is sent to Google via
a GET request.

2) The maximum size of a single hidden user pref is ~13,700 characters
in Firefox and ~14,700 characters in IE7.  If a single call to set the
pref data (name + value) is less than 1,746 characters, a GET request
is used for setting the pref.  Otherwise the setPref call resorts to a
POST.

3) The maximum combined size of prefs for a single gadget appears to
be ~13,750 characters in Firefox and ~14,750 characters in IE7.  I
successfully stored and retrieved this much data for a single gadget,
in both IE7 and Firefox 2.

While carrying out this testing I also found out that there appears to
be some limit, which I initially thought was for the entire tab (see
test case below).  As soon as this limit was hit, gadget pref data
saving became incredibly erratic with single prefs occasionally not
being set or the entire functionality around adding/removing gadgets
stopping working.

Reproducible test case (for me anyway) on a fresh tab:

1) Add the gadget to an empty tab, using the developer gadget
2) In IE7, set the gadget data to 14700 in a single pref
3) Refresh the page and validate.
4) Add the gadget again.
5) Tab functionality breaks!  The new gadget doesn't get added.
6) Set the data in the first gadget to 14600 in a single pref.
7) Refresh the page.
8) Inlining and gadget removal now works.

Alternative reproducible test case (for me anyway):

1) Add the gadget to an empty tab, using the developer gadget.
2) Add the gadget again.
3) In IE7, set the first gadget data to 4500 in a single pref.
4) In IE7, set the second gadget data to 10000 in a single pref.
5) Refresh the page and validate.
6) Add the gadget again.
7) Tab functionality breaks really badly!  The new gadget doesn't even
get added.
8) Set the data in the second gadget to 9800 in a single pref.
9) Refresh the page.
10) Tab functionality now works.

I got Bonstio to try these tests out, but his limit appeared to be
5600 for a single gadget.  Once again, as soon as this was hit that
tabs functionality completely broke - he couldn't add new gadgets, or
remove gadgets from that tab.  More worryingly, he couldn't add new
gadgets onto any of his existing tabs!

So now I'm wondering if there is either a data limit or a pref-number
limit across the entire iGoogle account.  This may explain why users
suddenly have problems saving their gadget data using setPref, as I
know Bonstio and myself have users who get this quite often and it
always appears to be users who have a lot of gadgets on their tabs.

This is an excellent post, thanks Simon.

I would like to remind others of similar posts made on this topic in
the past particularly this thread ( http://groups.google.com/group/
Google-Gadgets-API/browse_frm/thread/a83ae01920f1c53a/1ce2a3e0f2b38d13?
lnk=gst&amp;q=viewlet+builder#1ce2a3e0f2b38d13)  in which I went to the
trouble of creating a viewlet to demonstrate the problem. I believe
Simon's issue is the exact same one.

I have had dozens of mails from users of my web stickies gadget who
have come up against this problem. I have put a warning in the gadget
which alerts users when they are nearing the limit of the gadget's
capacity but as Simon demonstrates, this seems to vary per account.

I would love to get this problem fixed once and for all. I realise
that there will inherently be some limit to the amount of data iGoogle
can store but I would like to know what the limit is and also when
it's been hit - otherwise the apparent unreliability of gadgets
translates to a bad user experience.

That was the conclusion I reached as well. Because adding gadgets on
one tab will either kill the tab functionality or prohibit saving of
prefs on other tabs, etc.

The thing is, if there is some upper limit, I think it should be quite
obvious to the iGoogle development team, shouldn't it? Perhaps it's
even documented somewhere? But to date we haven't heard a single thing
about this problem, even though it has affected a number of us. It got
to the point where I couldn't even add test gadgets that I was
developing without removing my real content that I read daily, so I
stopped development!

Maybe it's just a db column size that needs increased ;)

I am not a programmer so my descriptions may not be helpful.  I love
the gadget but now:

I pick a skin such as Mac OSX.

My Igoogle page repaints and is beautiful.

I go to any other tab and come back and the custom skin is gone.

Also:

I keep getting the appearance of the custom skins gadget that says
&quot;Custom skins off.&quot;  I cannot get them to stay on and don't know how
to do it.

&gt; This is an excellent post, thanks Simon.

&gt; I would like to remind others of similar posts made on this topic in
&gt; the past particularly this thread ( http://groups.google.com/group/
&gt; Google-Gadgets-API/browse_frm/thread/a83ae01920f1c53a/1ce2a3e0f2b38d13?
&gt; lnk=gst&amp;q=viewlet+builder#1ce2a3e0f2b38d13)  in which I went to the
&gt; trouble of creating a viewlet to demonstrate the problem. I believe
&gt; Simon's issue is the exact same one.

&gt; I have had dozens of mails from users of my web stickies gadget who
&gt; have come up against this problem. I have put a warning in the gadget
&gt; which alerts users when they are nearing the limit of the gadget's
&gt; capacity but as Simon demonstrates, this seems to vary per account.

&gt; I would love to get this problem fixed once and for all. I realise
&gt; that there will inherently be some limit to the amount of data iGoogle
&gt; can store but I would like to know what the limit is and also when
&gt; it's been hit - otherwise the apparent unreliability of gadgets
&gt; translates to a bad user experience.

Hello, All:  I agree that it is time for Google to consider posting
iGoogle size limitations so that end users such as myself can make
full use of our gadgets.  My extremely robust page has been &quot;frozen&quot;
for several weeks. (It has 14 tabs with over 240 gadgets.) While I can
still navigate through the tabs, I can no longer add or delete new
gadgets or tabs and several of my favorite gadgets no longer function
properly.  Perhaps Google could offer a temporary increase in capacity
to allow users to unfreeze their pages in order to reduce total
gadgets to an acceptable number.  They could also consider adding a
capacity display feature to alert users when they will most likely
experience errors caused by exceeding the posted safe limits.
Something other than wiping the page clean and starting all over again
must be developed soon.

Is there any update on this? To me it looks like a pretty serious
limitation, but maybe I'm incorrect.

Thanks everyone for your comments and concerns.  I agree that this is
a considerable limitation in gadgets.  I do need to clarify though
that the size limit is not something we're enforcing.  It's really a
limitation from the browser.  UserPref values are currently passed
into the gadget via URL.  However, each browser has a different limit
on how long the URLs can be.  Whether it's 13700 characters or 14700
characters, it really depends on what browser and possibly OS you're
using.  So unfortunately, we can't provide any official numbers on
this.

It'll take time to redesign the architecture of gadgets to address
this, but we definitely realize the issues that lie here.  Is it
possible to shard the data and save them into multiple UserPrefs?

Thanks,

Dann

Sorry, I don't think you're understanding the problem Dann.

This isn't a per-gadget limit we're seeing, it's a per account limit.
As soon as the hard-limit of 13-14k of data is hit on the account, the
entire iGoogle page (every tab) stops works properly - new gadgets
can't be added, existing gadgets can't be removed, etc, across *every*
tab.
