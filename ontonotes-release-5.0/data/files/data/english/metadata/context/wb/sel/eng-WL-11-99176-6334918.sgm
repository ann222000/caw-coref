The headlines of the hour are that "Al-Sadr Reportedly Accepts Peace Plan." Well, it's possible of course. But here's the article which backs up that headline: "Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr accepted a peace plan Wednesday to end fighting in Najaf that would disarm his militiamen and remove them from a holy shrine where they are hiding out, according to an al-Sadr spokesman. However, al-Sadr wanted to negotiate how the deal would be implemented." Pardon the cynicism, but isn't "how the deal would be implemented" the very essence of any "peace plan"? Which means, of course, that he hasn't accepted any peace plan, except in some vague "in principle" way.

Details are important to a peace plan, but so is another word in the article: negotiation. This was an ultimatum, with members of the delegation going out of their way to point out that they weren't negotiating, just issuing demands. An agreement, between two sides, is also the essence of a peace plan.

Good points, both. What I wish to know is what happens to Al-Sadr and the Mahdis? Must they give up and be imprisoned, or are they permitted to fade off into their community? I doubt the latter but really fear the former. And to give up their weapons -(word used lightly, since guns are no match for tanks and helicopter bombers, etc.)? They'll be sitting ducks during a surrender and victims when in prison. This sounds bad. Does anyone think Al-Sadr's just sick of the thought of more Iraqis getting slaughtered and thinks anything would be better than that, or is that a naive belief? In any case, it reeks. Thanks for your site, it's great. CP

I thought the latter was intended, at least up until today, but then there's this story, in which the defense minister says something quite different.

Um, whose site is great, mine or Eli's? Not that I'm fishing for compliments or anything.

I was referring to Eli's site, not knowing who you were. But now that I've checked, I see you're "Whatever...", which I also like a lot. Both sites are in my instant access list (I refuse to use the AOL word "favorites" as though you were colors or brands of pizza).

Ralph Nader filed for ballot access in Ohio yesterday and today the Plain Dealer (Cleveland) has an article by a writer who should know better, saying that the votes Nader siphoned off from Gore in 2000 helped elect Bush. I absolutely refuse to give any time to a writer who refers to Bush as "elected," and doesn't yet get it about who voted for whom (i.e. as all the Dems who crossed over to get their puny tax refund).

Do you think the only reason the U.S. hasn't moved on Al-Sadr and company by now is that they don't want to create martyrs? I'm so desperate at this point I'm for anything that saves lives, even temporarily. Of course, if they pulled all the troops out they could save a lot of lives.

Al-Sadr's position is that he'll leave Najaf AFTER the US troops pull out. That ain't gonna happen, so I guess we go to war with the whole of Islam and flatten the shrine, all because some low-level marines decided to carry the fight to the enemy, without regard to the desires of their superiors.

A case where sensitivity might have saved lives and money, you know?
