*Leicester staged a stirring second half fightback to claim a deserved point
against local rivals Derby.

Leicester 1-1 Derby
By Jourdan Rhule

In a sluggish opening 20 minutes, Derby coolly negotiated a spell of
harmless dominance from the hosts. Leicester probed away but never really
created openings that asked too much of the Derby defence. Frustration grew
amongst the home supporters, as their attempt to find a breakthrough was
then thwarted by referee Howard Webb on 22 minutes. Patrick Kisnorbo looked
set to reach a left wing cross into the box, but was victim to a clumsy
challenge by Darren Moore. This ignited protests for a penalty that were
shrugged off by Webb to the disappointment of the City faithful. Derby
seized on Leicester's misfortune by edging ahead moments later. Craig Fagan
scored his first goal for the Rams when he pounced on Giles Barnes' crisp
through ball to beat Paul Henderson with a calmly placed finish from 10
yards.

A tussle for the decisive second goal then unfolded but neither side could
make a breakthrough. Derby manufactured the most encouraging opportunity
during the remainder of the half, but Barnes blazed over from 8 yards when
he met Darren Currie's floated cross, after some promising build up from the
visitors. The whistle blew for half time to leave Derby narrowly ahead and
Leicester bemoaning their failure to convert possession into genuine
chances.

The second half began with the hosts looking refreshed and determined to
find an equaliser. But they would have to be patient as Iain Hume's
long-range effort glided over the bar minutes after the restart. Danny
Tiatto drilled over from a similar position moments later, as Leicester
began to play with increasing confidence. Derby fans blew a collective sigh
of relief when Stephen Bywater clawed away Hume's delicate 22 yard free kick
on 53 minutes.

City boss Rob Kelly looked to capitalise on the Foxes' period of pressure by
bringing Matty Fryatt into play for Elvis Hammond on 55 minutes. Whilst
Billy Davies tried to turn the tide by bringing Gary Teale on for Jon Macken
shortly after. And it looked like the changes may have worked in favour of
the visitors, but Fagan fired straight at Henderson after stealing the ball
from a sleepy Foxes defence and David Jones miscued his header from Jay
McEveley's precise left wing cross.

Jones' miss would prove costly for the Rams as Leicester drew level
instantly after. Jason Jarrett found space on the edge of the box to poke a
teasing ball forward for Fryatt who took it under control, before dancing
past Dean Leacock to find room to sweep the ball low into the net past
Bywater.

Both sides then threw caution to the wind in an attempt to salvage a winner.
But a catalogue of opportunities were wasted. Moore's close range header
flew over the bar from Currie's corner. Before good work down the right
found Lupoli - whose blocked shot fell invitingly for Fagan at the back
post, who preceded to stab a tame shot straight at Leicester keeper
Henderson. Then on another Rams attack, Lupoli wriggled free in the penalty
area but his audacious left foot shot boomed over and wide of the goal. Levi
Porter had Leicester's best chance to snatch the win at the death but after
fighting off the Derby defence, his firm right foot shot was parried away
confidently by Bywater to ensure that honours were even at the final
whistle.

Today's result saw Derby surrender much of the initiative in the race for
promotion to the Premiership. A victory for Sunderland tomorrow would see
them close the gap on the leaders to a solitary point, while Birmingham look
comfortable only 3 points behind the Rams with 2 games in hand. Many Rams
fans will have gone home disappointed that they failed to take all 3 points
from a game which was considered tough but winnable, based on the recent
form of the Foxes. In what was a largely uninspiring contest, Leicester
looked more eager and committed and might themselves feel aggrieved they
didn't win the game. Personally, I view today's result as 2 points dropped
for the Rams, because if they would have shown more desire, urgency and
ruthlessness in front of goal, they could have won today. But they didn't
and make no mistake - Birmingham and Sunderland will capitalise.

The open top bus tour around Derby city centre in May, with Billy & the boys
parading the Championship trophy will remain a pipe dream, unless Derby
become more ruthless all over the park and ensure they finish off
opposition.

Bywater - 8 - (man of the match) Produced some crucial saves to keep Derby
in the game.

McEveley - 7 - Looked a danger going forward and calm in defence

Moore - 6 - Inconsistent display. Sometimes he looked solid and other times
he looked a liability.

Leacock - 6 - Unspectactular performance. Allowed Fryatt to pass him too
easily for the goal.

Mears - 6 - Ordinary display, he did what was asked of him. Longing to see
more from him going forward

Currie - 7 - Showed a lot of promise with great craft & confidence on the
ball.

Jones - 6 - Not one of his best performances in a Rams shirt. Clearly
affected by the injury picked up against Barnsley

Oakley - 6 - Didn't do enough to dominate the midfield. Disappointing,
expected more from him.

Barnes - 7 - Energetic and dangerous with his forward runs from midfield
until he got injured, assisted Derby's goal with a delightful through ball.

Fagan - 6 - Took his goal very well, but should have done better with his
chances in the second half.

Macken - 5 - Didn't provide a genuine focal point for the Rams attack and
didn't impose himself enough on the opposition.

Subs.:

Bisgaard - 5 - Didn't make enough of an impact on the game

Lupoli - 5 - Didn't have enough time to make a lasting impression

Teale - 6 - Gave the team impetus down the right, but still didn't sparkle.
