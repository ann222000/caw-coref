Brimfield, didn't go. But about the snoring....

Earplugs. Spongy little things you can buy at a drug store. They work great,
of course if anyone were to break in, I'd never know it.

I'm back! Went yesterday for the adventure. Had to get up at 3 AM to drive
2 1/2 hours to Brimfield. Between 11 PM and 3 AM my husband snored and woke
me up at least 3 times (but that is another story....any creative suggestions
to remedy this situation are welcome).
Aside from the fact that I was so tired I could barely function, I did
survive. Saw hoosiers for $1950-$2200. Saw some nifty gold metal letters ( 2
feet high, maybe) that spelled out &quot;Roses 25 cents&quot; (can't find the cent key on
this keyboard). I think, cool (!) and ask how much? $1800. I pretend like
this is not a shock (ha!) and walk away. Saw some nifty advertising signs for
grape cola for $40. I even bought one. Saw them later at another booth for
$145. Yes, he bought them that morning. I asked. Revolving piano stools are
still only $95.
Anyway...filled up the van in about 8 hours and turned around and came
home. Whew! Anyone else go? Love to hear your impressions. Fayette

No Brimfield impressions, but a solution to the dh waking you
up with the snoring from here. I finally gave up on the whole
thing, have a separate bedroom &amp; a SOUND MACHINE!! You
may be able to &quot;cope&quot; with just the machine, tho'.

Fayette,
On my keyboard the 'cents' symbol is found by holding down the 'alt' key
and hitting the 'dollar' key,like this
¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢...
NOW, as to the snoring.... I can't attest to this,as I am sleeping
at the time,BUT,my wife tells me that I Don't snore when I go to sleep
sexually exhausted......
Now, if I could only get her to participate.. IMO
yeehaaaa,

"/> Thank you everyone for the advice on snoring husbands. I think I will remain
in the same room...but the sound machine is an idea. Earplugs....yes, I have
tried those...but since I am in charge of security at night (!) I like to be
alert. And the exhausted part....Douglas....I've tried it. :-) Makes him
snore louder! Fayette

My mother once heard that poking the snorer with a hatpin was a surefire
cure (aversion therapy?) and has often thought about using the method, but
in the end, she stuck to more conventional remedies, like making Dad turn
over onto his side when he was rattling the rafters. I think her latest
effort involves those new devices that look a little like the butterfly
bandage you get when you break your nose...

Loved it...first time there and want to go back. Was there Tues., Wed, and Thurs.
Impressions:
1. Many dealers had items priced at what I would consider &quot;show prices&quot;...I took a
quick look at those tables and kept
walking. (I saw the 'Roses 25 Cents' letters too...cool, but expensive!)
2. Found some great items at low prices; had to work to find them, but well worth
it. (Example: 2 books that I bought for $5 each list at $125 each on Bibliofind.)
3. Don't like the concept of no-setup-til-the-gate-opens. Since I flew out there,
was buying smalls. There was no point being
there when gates opened as dealers couldn't get totally unpacked for quite awhile.
4. Took quite a bit of cash, (much more than I normally would carry), but when
that ran out found a lot of resistance to Traveler's Checks. I pointed out to some
dealers that they are far more likely to get burned by counterfeit $20 bills
(common
where I live). I wasn't trying to clean their change out either; this was for say
a $48 item paid for with a $50 traveler's check.
5. Met interesting people. We stayed in a B&amp;B where there was a couple from
England, (advanced collectors of miniature
sewing machines), an edge-tool collector from Colorado, and a mining collector from
Delaware among others.
6. New collection started: Shaker Sewing kits and other old sewing/needlework
items.
7. Want to take a truck next time I go and bring back furniture. Lots more nice
old primitives than I find around here.
8. Don't like the truckloads of European primitives and sap buckets that people
were scarfing up.
9. Missed my snoring husband. Traveled with my mother. She's 72 years old and
hums a lot. (Love her anyway!)

I have to say I was disappointed in this Brimfield. I have been to the
May brimfield shows this being my third year.

1. It was way way more crowded. Various cable home shows and Martha
Stewart have certainly helped increase attendance. Which I will admit is
great for the dealers.

2. Because of the crowds the prices were much higher than previous
brimfields. In fact, in March I was in France at a few flea markets there
and with the exception of the incredibly priced Paris flea markets the
prices and deals were way better.

3. I was disappointed to see so many dealers at Brimfield dabbling in
selling Beanie Babies

I do like the no setting up early rule contrary to previous posts. This
was enacted by several fields years ago to prevent dealer to dealer
selling prior to the start. In fact, last year several dealers were
thrown out for selling before the field opened.
