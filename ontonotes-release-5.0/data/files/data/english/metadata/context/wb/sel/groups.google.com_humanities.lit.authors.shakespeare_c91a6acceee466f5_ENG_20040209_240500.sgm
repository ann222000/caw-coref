September 22: Autumnal equinox
-----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;In a DUEL on September 22, 1598, at Shoreditch Jonson killed Gabriel
Spencer, an actor who had been in the Marshalsea prison with him the
year before as a result of the government's outrage over Jonson's and
Nashe's _The Isle of Dogs_. This time, to escape the gallows, Jonson
pleaded benefit of clergy: he read his 'neck verse' to prove he knew
Latin, and received a BRAND with a hot iron at the BASE of his
LEFT THUMB, 'T' for Tyburn.&gt;&gt; - Shakespeare by Halliday

Probably not. Hale's death was not even noted at the time.
It was not until the Americans were condemned
for the execution of a British spy, John Andre,
who was also hanged, that Hale was remembered.

&gt; [Nathan Hale] disguised himself as a Dutch schoolmaster.

Hale was one of the worst spies in history. He did not
disguise himself ... at all. He was carrying his *own*
papers. Worse: He told many people he met on Long Island
and in New York ... exactly what he was doing. Including
his cousin, a Tory, who may have betrayed him. No one is
exactly sure who betrayed Nathan Hale ... because he told
so many people of his plans.

Three years ago papers given to the Library of Congress,
written by Consider Tiffany, a shopkeeper from Connecticut,
and a Tory sympathizer, state Hale was betrayed by a British
major, Robert Rogers (a hero of the French and Indian War).

Captain William Hull (later, *General* Hull), a friend of
Nathan Hale, tried to talk him out of spying. Hull did his
best, to no avail, to impress upon Hale ... that he (Hale)
was *not* spy material. Hull also told Hale that spying was
a dishonorable profession. To Hale's credit, he responded:

&quot;I wish to be useful, and every kind of service,
necessary to the public good, becomes honorable
by being necessary.&quot;

I love the legend of Nathan Hale, but to me, the above quote
(one he actually said) is more impressive. In the service
of his country, for a cause he believed in, he was willing
to do anything. To accept dishonor (by the standards
of his time) ... for the good of America.

Captain Nathan Hale (1755 - 1776)
By Rev. Edward Everett Hale

&lt;&lt;Nathan Hale, a martyr soldier of the American Revolution, was born in
Coventry, Conn., June 6, 1755. When but little more than twenty-one
years old he was hanged, by order of General William Howe, as a spy, in
the city of New York, on September 22, 1776. At the great centennial
celebration of the Revolution, and the part which the State of
Connecticut bore in it, an immense assembly of the people of
Connecticut, on the heights of Groton, took measures for the erection of
a statue in Hale's honor. Their wish has been carried out by their
agents in the government of the State. A bronze statue of Hale is
in the State Capitol. Another bronze statue of him has been
erected in the front of the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford.
Another is in the city of New York.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;While the Allied Forces were planning the Normandy invasion
of June 6, 1944, the following code words were used
(and were among the best kept secrets of the war):

UTAH and OMAHA for the beaches where the landing would take place;
MULBERRY, for the artificial harbor which would be put in place;
NEPTUNE, the overall plan for Naval operations;
OVERLORD the entire planned invasion itself.

Thirty three days before the invasion,

on May 3, 1944, UTAH,
appeared as an answer in the London Daily Telegraph crossword.

Thirteen days before the invasion,

on May 23, OMAHA appeared similarly;
on May 31, MULBERRY appeared; and four days before the invasion,
on June 2, NEPTUNE and OVERLORD both appeared.

Sure that a spy was sending the code through the
newspaper in the crossword puzzles, security forces
descended on the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; offices, convinced that
they had uncovered a German spy. Instead what they found was
a very shocked and shaken schoolteacher by the name of
Leonard Dawe, who had been drafting the crossword puzzles
for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; for the past twenty years.
It took a bit of convincing, but Dawe finally managed to
convince the spy catchers that it was all a huge coincidence,
and that he had never, and would never spy for the enemy.&quot;

&quot;it appears that [Hale] was interested in theatrical performances.&quot;

Captain Nathan Hale (1755 - 1776)
By Rev. Edward Everett Hale

&lt;&lt;Nathan Hale's father was Richard Hale, who had emigrated to Coventry,
from Newbury, Mass., in 1746, and had married Elizabeth, the daughter of
Joseph Strong. By her he had 12 children, of whom Nathan was the 6th.

Richard Hale was a prosperous and successful farmer. He sent to Yale
College at one time his two sons, Enoch and Nathan, who had been born
within two years of each other. This college was then under the
direction of Dr. Daggett. Both the young men enjoyed study, and Nathan
Hale, at the exercises of Commencement Day took what is called a pert,
which shows that he was among the thirteen scholars of highest rank in
his class.

From the record of the college society to which he belonged, it appears
that he was interested in their theatrical performances. These were not
discouraged by the college government, and made a recognized part of the
amusements of the college and the town. Many of the lighter plays
brought forward on the English stage were thus produced by the pupils of
Yale College for the entertainment of the people of New Haven.

When he graduated, at the age of eighteen, he probably intended at some
time to become a Christian minister, as his brother Enoch did. But, as was
almost a custom of the time, he began his active life as a teacher in the
public schools, and early in 1774 accepted an appointment as the teacher of
the Union Grammar School, a school maintained by the gentlemen of New
London, Conn., for the higher education of their children. Of thirty-two
pupils, he says, &quot;ten are Latiners and all but one of the rest are
writers.&quot;

In his commencement address Hale had considered the question whether
the higher education of women were not neglected. And, in the
arrangement of the Union School at New London, it was determined that
between the hours of five and seven in the morning, he should teach a
class of &quot;twenty young ladies&quot; in the studies which occupied their
brothers at a later hour. He was thus engaged in the year 1774. The
whole country was alive with the movements and discussions which
came to a crisis in the battle of Lexington the next year. Hale, though
not of age, was enrolled in the militia and was active in the military
organization of the town. So soon as the news of Lexington and Concord
reached New London, a town-meeting was called. At this meeting, this
young man, not yet of age, was one of the speakers. &quot;Let us march
immediately,&quot; he said, &quot;and never lay down our arms until we obtain our
independence.&quot; He assembled his school as usual the next day, but only
to take leave of his scholars. &quot;He gave them earnest counsel, prayed
with them, shook each by hand,&quot; bade them farewell. It is said that
there is no other record so early as this in which the word
&quot;independence&quot; was publicly spoken. It would seem as if the
uncalculating courage of a boy of twenty were needed to break
the spell which still gave dignity to colonial submission.

Washington knew that their next point of attack would be New York. Most
of his army was, therefore, sent there, and Webb's regiment among the
rest. They were at first assigned to the Canada army, but because they
had a good many seafaring men, were reserved for service near New York,
where their &quot;web-footed&quot; character served them well more than once that
summer. Hale marched with the regiment to New London, whence they all
went by water to New York. On that critical night, when the whole army
was moved across to New York after the defeat at Brooklyn,
the regiment rendered effective service.

It was at this period that Hale planned an attack, made by members of
his own company, to set fire to the frigate Phoenix. The frigate was
saved, but one of her tenders and four cannons and six swivels were
taken. The men received the thanks, praises, and rewards of Washington,
and the frigate, with her companions, not caring to risk such attacks
again, retired to the Narrows. Soon after this little brush with the
enemy, Colonel Knowlton, one of the Connecticut regiments, organized a
special corps, which was known as Knowlton's Rangers. On the rolls of
their own regiments the officers and men are spoken of as &quot;detached on
command.&quot; They received their orders direct from Washington and Putnam,
and were kept close in front of the enemy, watching his movements from
the American line in Harlem. It was in this service, on September 15th,
that Knowlton's Rangers, with three Virginia companies, drove the
English troops from their position in an open fight. It was a spirited
action, which was a real victory for the attacking force. Knowlton and
Leitch, the leaders, were both killed. In his general orders
Washington spoke of Knowlton as a gallant and brave officer
who would have been an honor to any country.

But Hale, alas! was not fighting at Knowlton's side. He was indeed
&quot;detached for special service.&quot; Washington had been driven up the island
of New York, and was holding his place with the utmost difficulty. On
September 6th he wrote, &quot;We have not been able to obtain the least
information as to the enemy's plans.&quot; In sheer despair at the need of
better information then the Tories of New York City would give him, the
great commander consulted his council, and at their direction summoned
Knowlton to ask for some volunteer of intelligence, who would find his
way into the English lines, and bring back some tidings that could be
relied upon. Knowlton summoned a number of officers, and stated to them
the wishes of their great chief. The appeal was received with dead
silence. It is said that Knowlton personally addressed a
non-commissioned officer, a Frenchman, who was an old soldier. He did so
only to receive the natural reply, &quot;I am willing to be shot, but not to
be hung.&quot; Knowlton felt that he must report his failure to Washington.
But Nathan Hale, his youngest captain, broke the silence. &quot;I will
undertake it,&quot; he said. He had come late to the meeting. He was pale
from recent sickness. But he saw an opportunity to serve,
and he did the duty which came next at hand.

William Hull, afterward the major-general who commanded at Detroit, had
been Hale's college classmate. He remonstrated with his friend on the
danger of the task, and the ignominy which would attend its failure. &quot;He
said to him that it was not in the line of his duty, and that he was of
too frank and open a temper to act successfully the part of a spy, or to
face its dangers, which would probably lead to a disgraceful death.&quot;
Hale replied, &quot;I wish to be useful, and every kind of service necessary
to the public good becomes honorable by being necessary. If the
exigencies of my country demand a peculiar service, its claim to perform
that service are imperious.&quot; These are the last words of his which can
be cited until those which he spoke at the moment of his death.
He promised Hull to take arguments into consideration,
but Hull never heard from him again.

In the second week of September he left the camp for Stamford with
Stephen Hempstead, a sergeant in Webb's regiment, from whom we have the
last direct account of his journey. With Hempstead and Asher Wright, who
was his servant in camp, he left his uniform and some other articles of
property. He crossed to Long Island in citizen's dress, and, as
Hempstead thought, took him his college diploma, meaning to assume the
aspect of a Connecticut schoolmaster visiting New York in the hope to
establish himself. He landed near Huntington, or Oyster Bay, and
directed the boatman to return at a time fixed by him, the 20th of
September. He made his way into New York, and there, for a week or more
apparently, prosecuted his inquiries. He returned on the day fixed, and
awaited his boat. It appeared, as he thought; and he made a signal from
the shore. Alas! he had mistaken the boat. She was from an English
frigate, which lay screened by a point of woods, and had come in for
water. Hale attempted to retrace his steps, but was too late. He was
seized and examined. Hidden in the soles of his shoes were his
memoranda, in the Latin language. They compromised him at once.
He was carried on board the frigate, and sent to New York
the same day, well guarded.

It was at an unfortunate moment, if anyone expected tenderness from
General Howe. Hale landed while the city was in the terror of the great
conflagration of September 21st. In that fire nearly a quarter of the
town was burned down. The English supposed, rightly or not, that the
fire had been begun by the Americans. The bells had been taken from the
churches by order of the Provincial Congress. The fire-engines were out
of order, and for a time it seemed impossible to check the flames. Two
hundred persons were sent to jail upon the supposition that they were
incendiaries. It is in the midst of such confusion that Hale is taken to
General Howe's head-quarters, and there he meets his doom.

No testimony could be stronger against him than the papers on his
person. He was not there to prevaricate, and he told them his rank and
name. There was no trial, and Howe at once ordered that he should be
hanged the next morning. Worse than this, had he known it, he was to be
hanged by William Cunningham, the Provost-Major, a man whose brutality,
through the war disgraced the British army. It is a satisfaction to know
that Cunningham was hanged for his deserts in England, not many years
after.

Hale was confined for the night of September 21st in the greenhouse of
the garden of Howe's head-quarters. This place was known as the Beekman
Mansion, at Turtle Bay. This house was standing until within a few years.

Early the next day he was led to his death. &quot;On the morning of the
execution,&quot; said Captain Montresor, an English officer, &quot; my station
being near the fatal spot, I requested the Provost-Marshal to permit the
prisoner to sit in my marquee while he was making the necessary
preparations. Captain Hale entered. He asked for writing materials,
which I furnished him. He wrote two letters; one to his mother and one
to a brother officer. The Provost-Marshal destroyed the letters, and
assigned a reason that the rebels should not know that they had
a man in their army who could die with so much firmness.&quot;

Hale asked for a Bible, but his request was refused. He was marched out
by a guard and hanged upon an apple-tree in Rutgers's orchard. The place
was near the present intersection of East Broadway and Market Streets.
Cunningham asked him to make his dying &quot;speech and confession.&quot;

&quot;I only regret, that I have but one life to lose for my country.&quot;&gt;&gt;
