Prof Hal Puthoff, a self confessed sceptic, and quantum physycist, appeared
on a Discovey Channel documentary recently, and reported on his research
into various psychic phenomena.

He demonstrated and honest and paradoxical stand point, whereby his closing
statement was along the lines of " I've run out of rational reasoning to
deny such phenomena having observed what i have observed"

One of the barriers to such academic perspective, is the academic is trained
to look for cause and effect, whereby the two aspects can be linked. What he
said was in  effect was"we know it happens, but we dont know why".

Many years ago, a friend who was lecturing in biochemistry to medical
students, set up a pyramid with razor blades suspended within, to see if
there was any effect (there was a lot of interest in 'pyramid power' at the
time). This was done more for fun . The head of department didnt see it that
way, and tore strips of this friend.

He wondered why such an extreme reaction, and was told " If there was such a
phenomena, we have no way of explaining it"

Some things just dont change.

Hey Brian;

You're right...

A closed mind is a terrible thing to possess....

Belief without ironclad science is an anathema to many...too bad...

I think you might have a kindred spirit over at "Minds Eye". Check
it out (tell me who he is)..
Don't have to worry about Mikey posting over there, it's heavily
moderated but low on activity.

That's exacly how science has been working for, well, as long as there
has been science. We didn't know why when we observed the apples
falling or planets revolving around the sun. We didn't know why when
we observed the photoelectric effect, spectral lines of hydrogen,
Rutherford experiment... etc. Fundamentally, we still don't really
know why things work the way they do. Experimental science simply
about documenting what happens.

It's a BS claim to say that academics are trained to look for cause
and effect. Experimenters are trained to look for effects, period.
Theorists are trained to explain these new effects in terms of
previously documented effects.

However, what differentiates the above real observations from such
said psychic phenomena and other snake oils is that the latter isn't
even an effect, it's not observed, it's not there. Those who have
claimed otherwise, have without an exception, failed to make the
proper observation, they have made glaring systematic errors. They
have been crappy experimenters or observers (and many

If there were indeed such things as perpetual motion machines and
psychic pheomena, people would be making fortunes with them, even if
they didn't have a clue on how to explain the cause. The problem is,

Both academic, but I take your point. I'm not criticising scientific method,
just trying to illustrate , as in Puthoff's example, how uneasy many can get
when they look beyond established accumulated wisdom, and how many are
reluctant to look.

One mans crap is another's experience. I am a rational succesful business

Heh and I beg to differ.  I know loads of people who make a reasonable
living out of the 'paranormal'

I myself have seen and done things that have no other rational
expliantion.  Now wether you want to belive it or not (I really don't
mind which) there are many things that are just not explianable by
science.

This does though remind me of a great friend of mine, who is skeptical
about lots of things.  When I one day reminded him, of the things that
we have together seen and done (in the oldendays) he mummbled
something about mass hallucinations, and then quickly dropped the
subject.

Heh I just found it funny that he can belive in such a thing as mass
hallucination, but not in the power of the runes for example.

V. Krasnoholovets reported that a razor blade placed in a pyramid
"resonator" became smoother and less angular over time. Similar claims
were made in the 1980s by Birmingham researcher Roger Payton
concerning the psychic powers of dredger buckets.

"Pyramid Power" may be (scalar_resonance) caused by the geometric
shape of the pyramid, also related to shape energy. Any
electromagnetic frequencies are converted by the direct influence of
the perfect pyramid shape causing it to act as a accumulator changing
them into a new harmonized form of energy or prana.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_power

A burning-glass is a large convex lens, which can focus the sun's rays
on a small area and so ignite materials. Used in 18th century chemical
studies for burning materials in closed glass vessels where the
products of combustion could be trapped for analysis, the burning-
glass was a useful contrivance in the days before electrical ignition
was easily achieved.

The technology of the burning glass has been known since antiquity.
Aristophanes mentions the burning-lens in his play The Clouds (424
BC), and Archimedes, the renowned mathematician, was said to have used
a burning glass (although it is more likely that a large number of
angled hexagonal mirrored surfaces were used) in 212 BC when Syracuse
was besieged by Marcellus. Archimedes constructed a burning-glass on a
scale of such magnitude that by means of it the Roman fleet was
incinerated, though eventually when the city was taken, he was found
among the slain. The use of a mirror was however proven to be untrue
by the Myth Busters. The legend of Archimedes gave rise to a
considerable amount of research on burning glasses and lenses until
the late 17th century.

Recent excavations at the Viking harbor town of Fröjel, Gotland in
Sweden have revealed that this technology of fire-starting was known
in the Viking Age as well. Rock crystal lenses produced at Fröjel in
the 11th to 12th century via turning on pole-lathes have been found
that have an imaging quality comparable to that of 1950s aspheric
lenses. The Viking lenses quite effectively concentrate sunlight
enough to ignite fires.

In the scalar EM extension, EM field energy can be turned into
gravitational field energy and vice versa. This exchange can be
patterned and
localized, in specific areas and objects.

Interesting stuff. I have a what I think is a truly scientific mind. I am
open to any idea until it is disproven or proven. Where something cannot be
proven (eg supernatural) im in favour of conducting experiments where
possible, eg experiments on effectivness of prayers to heal the sick (a
scientific study proved that prayers have no effect, and can even be worse
than if no one prays for them).

For the razors in pyramids, I would want to know exactly how much time it
took to blunt the blades, and exactly how much blunter they became, and that
this could be replicated anywhere. I woulndt have thought it would be too
difficult to test the sharpness of the blades before and after their time in
the pyramids, and compare this with blades which spent equal time in a
sqaure, a circle, and left out in the open.

unfortunately, science isn't always scientific. it has its own politics and
prejudicies. few scientists will touch cold fusion because it is now seen as
wacky and therefore a career-wrecker.

As in all endevours, it is ones willingness to be a "free radicle" (LOVE the

Ultimate? Thats the foundation of a deep thread ! Many of those

I know a couple of scientists who do know more than the "established

But, for me, science is always playing catch up, but will never "get

These questions don't need supernatural answers. They may have complex
answers, but just like our inability to precisely predict the weather
doesn't imply magic pixies are in charge of weather, our inability to
perfectly explain the effect of music in individuals doesn't mean
supernatural is involved. In fact, any interesting question is
terribly complex, even when we know the principles. Try predicting how
a dice will roll or if a penny will turn up heads or tails. Even
though the principles of mechanics is well known, even such mundane
questions turn out to be a computational mess in a realistic setting.
It then becomes apparent why explaining how music affects individuals
is an immensely complex problem, not because its beyond science, but
because it's well beyond our current technological and computational
means.

Accourding to your approach, repeated experiments showd that when
people don't know that they are being prayed for and they get worse,
while that didn't know and were not prayed prayed for were unaffected,
you would be forced to support the power of prayer?

Many accept that prayer can aid in recovery, not due to divine
influence but due to psychological and physical benefits. It has also
been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed
for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery.
(See Subject-expectancy effect.) Many studies have suggested that
prayer can reduce physical stress, regardless of the god or gods a
person prays to, and this may be true for many worldly reasons.
According to a study by Centra State Hospital, "the psychological
benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more
positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live." Other practices
such as Yoga, Tai Chi, and Meditation may also have a positive impact
on physical and psychological health.

However, a 2005 study published in the American Heart Journal
indicated that bypass surgery patients who were aware that they were
being prayed for developed more complications than patients who were
unaware of prayers on their behalf, and patients who were unaware that
they were being prayed for had more major complications than those who
were not prayed for as part of the study.

Others feel that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects
a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer.

The terms pseudoskepticism (sometimes pseudo-skepticism) and
pathological skepticism are used to denote the phenomena when certain
forms of skepticism deviate from objectivity. ...Since "skepticism"
properly refers to doubt rather than denial - nonbelief rather than
belief - critics who take the negative rather than an agnostic
position but still call themselves "skeptics" are actually pseudo-
skeptics.

...healthy skepticism can see through unsupported
assertions, and ...pathological skepticism can work
against honest scientific inquiry

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoskepticism

"Abuses of skepticism" is a term describing when skepticism either has
ulterior motives or is taken to a counterproductive extreme. ...the
term is more criticism of an individual's thinking rather than their
psychology.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuses_of_skepticism

Debunkers are scientific skeptics who attempt to disprove and pursue
what they consider to be false, unscientific, bizarre or abnormal
claims. The ultimate intent of the debunking, according to some, is
conclusively to disprove the validity of an event, theory, and/or
phenomenon by exposing it as nonsense. According to Wiktionary, debunk
means To discredit, or expose to ridicule the falsehood or the
exaggerated claims of something.

Topics that many debunkers focus on include U.F.O.s, claimed
paranormal phenomena, alternative medicine, research outside
mainstream science, or pseudoscientific subjects. The term debunker is
applied when a person functions as an activist and performs research,
writes articles, holds speeches, conducts seminars, or engages in
other activities with the specific intent of disproving a dubious,
bizarre, or abnormal claim, such as those about U.F.O.s or other
paranormal phenomena, and hopefully conclusively disproves the
validity of the event and/or object.

As a slang term, debunking is the act of disproval of a proposal or
theory, generally in an academic or scientific sense...

...genuine skeptics are neutral or agnostic, often critical of new
claims, but not vehemently opposed to them. They want better evidence.
In contrast, pseudoskeptics are simply deniers with an agenda and
often use unscientific arguments to debunk what they oppose. Many
things that pseudoskeptics label pseudoscience, could be more aptly be
described as "protosciences" still struggling to establish mainstream
acceptance. It is argued there are many historical examples of where
pseudoskepticism seriously hindered scientific progress by
unreasonably opposing introduction of radical new ideas. On the other
hand true skepticism would recognize the need for better evidence, but
not actively oppose, ridicule, or discourage further investigation
into any subject by serious and qualified researchers.

I have seen no example of science contradicting the past wisdoms, from "the
sins of the father" (dna inheritence), to reaping and sowing (quantum
mechanics).

How easy it would have been to explain back then, with such scientific
breakthroughs...IF it was an intellectual pursuit...which it isnt.

Hey Alan,

Lets styart again here, I feel we are just getting our wires crossed.

So my original post to you was in counter to your 'not make use' reply
to Brian.

I said that I know plenty of people that make a living out of what we
would call the supernatural, or the paranormal if you prefer.

The rest was just confussing the matter.  Now I guess the point you
are trying to make is that no such thing as the paranaormal exists,
and that scince is the only valid methoed to show what is and what
isn't?

The problem I encounter more that I would expect, is the denial factor, in
light of empirical evidence.

Even the local recent Perth based Nobel prize winners, took ten years to
convince the gastroenterologists that their discovery of a bacteria causing
ulcers.

One example of recognition not becoming science is acupuncture. Denial
amongst academics is rife. Not that I'm knocking them. When one has invested
his whole life into a particular paradigm, shift potential is frightening
(to the ego).

First, don't take it personally, but saying doesn't make it so. Many
people say many things.

However, I don't doubt the essence. Many people make money peddling
supernatural. Moreover, a few people make obscene amounts of money.
That in itself is only a testament on how gullible or vulnerable rest
of the people are. Care to provide one example where "supernatural" is
used in production? For instance, show me someone who runs a factory,
or equipment, on a PPM and thus produces things cheaper than his
competitors? It doesn't have to be PPM either, show me anything
supernatural that makes some task more efficient, even possible, that
natural doesn't.

Clinical medicine is even more frightening to acupuncturists who have
invested their whole life and livelihood into acupuncture. But besides
the two, there are researchers who make living by publishing papers
comparing merits and claims of any kind of practice. In fact, they
stand to gain more visibility and fame if their studies reveal the
unexpected, break new ground. If acupuncture hasn't shown the stellar
benefits that acupuncturists claim, it's not because it's been
ignored, but because it's a low efficiency treatment at best, or even
a placebo.

I find it in turn fascinating how people are fascinated by the ancient
and the exotic, even when there is little demonstratable merit or
understanding, but feel utter contempt for the familiar, the local and
contemporary, even when it works day in and day out with solid
evidence behind it. Not to say that western medicine is mature or
perfect, but we have made amazing leaps in the last hundered years or
so. In fact, its very success is what causes us to forget that it
works so well, in spite of the failings due to human factors.

&gt;&gt; True. But at least it's progressing. Same cannot be said of
&gt;&gt; superstition. If anything, it would seem that &quot;supernaturalists&quot; are
&gt;&gt; always longing for the past, admitting that they keep losing knowledge
&gt;&gt; (if you believe them, ancient Egyptians, for instance, were so much
&gt;&gt; more smarter and had stronger &quot;mystical powers&quot;... etc). Even if we
&gt;&gt; take their claims at face value, between something that's regressing
&gt;&gt; and something that's progressing, I'd say the choice is obvious.

Ah, so you beat your children.

Seek and ye shall find. There are just as many bits of ancient kookery
as there are bits of ancient wisdom. Even so, any sane person would
have to admit there's precious little connection between reaping and
sowing and quantum mechanics, unless one is grasping at straws.

Lets assume the ridiculous and ask then: What would have made ancients
so wiser than us?

Ahhh well that is the crux of it isn't it Alan.  I'd love top put

As to supernatural being beyond nature, I don't belive it is.

One mans natural is another mans supernatural.All depends on the experience,
and the willingness to go beyond epistemology.

I challenged the group here to look at the evidence in support of the
statistical validiy of numerology, on the Hamburg university site. I need no
validation, having spent over`twenty years "talking that language".

I also understand that people will only look toward the "supernatural" when
they are`ready, 'naturally'.
