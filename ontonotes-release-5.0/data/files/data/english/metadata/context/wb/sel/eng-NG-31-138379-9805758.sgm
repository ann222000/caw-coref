I'm sorry to bring this up, but I can't help but be interrested in
what these other &quot;societies&quot; call the true past of Christianity. Has
anyone else studyed it? Anyone else think that it could be possible? I
don't think it could be impossible. Where there really scruptures left
out of the bible on purpose, and was that decision made by the councel
of rome to make Jesus look like a God and not man? As you all see I'm
still trying to understand and make sense of all of this. Do I believe
in Him of course. Do I think He is immortal, only in the sense that it
is possible He could have desendents, meaning His blood is still alive
in us today. I'm taking my walk with God, but which path am I supposed
to take? It is wrong to want to know more about this &quot;true past&quot;? Or
would it be wrong in the long run, in His eyes, to continue the
traditional beliefs? Traditional beliefs have so many holes how can
anyone make complete sense of it? I know just have faith and will
understand, but I don't want to put my faith into a false belief.

So without underminding me, can anyone help me out here?

Well, first off, faith is nothing more than empty opinion. Organized
religion is the only institution in existence that operates on this blind
type of trust that they are right. They are not right. Christianity in
particular, since you inquired about it, is basically a con game, created by
the Roman Emperor Constantine and what is now known as the Catholic Church.
Christianity is a blend of what is now called paganism and  Christianity.
Interestingly enough, paganism did not exist prior to Christianity. You're
correct in stating that these folks chose what writings to include in the
Bible and what to leave out. You're also correct in stating that the Bible
is &quot;full of holes.&quot; I prefer to call them contradictions and outright
errors.

I would recommend you start a critical examination of your religion. If
there is a Creator, and He created you, then He gave you the inherent
intelligence and abilities to apply rational, logical thought to anything.
That's how science has advanced to the stage it has,  by rational, logical
thought. Religion should be no different. God will not kill you for using
your inherent capabilities to examine your beliefs in a critical manner.
There are two possibilities:

1: You will convince yourself that your critical examination supports your
beliefs, or,
2: You will convince yourself that it is as stated above, and shed yourself
of it.

This is a long road, if you embark upon it; there are miles of propaganda
that has to be discarded right off the bat. You also have to recognize that
your parents have probably brainwashed you into your faith from birth. This
kind of mind control stuff is not easy to work around. But, if you're
sincere, you can do it and arrive at a reasonable version of the real truth.
You will not get that from the preacher...

Army wife, your questions here are interesting, we know without a doubt that certain books were not “canonized” and
destroyed “in the name of truth”. There is more to God than what is restricted by Religion, and for you to be asking
these questions is good for you, as you want to know the truth.

Some of these questions will require some intense study with the pros and cons being quite amazing for one to figure
out. Right now I don’t have as much time as I would like to give you some answers to your questions, but I will give you
some input soon.

Mark
