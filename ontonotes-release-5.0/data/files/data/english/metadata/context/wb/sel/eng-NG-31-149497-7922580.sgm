You're doing it now! Keep writing to everyone. Letters to the editor of
your newspaper is a great place to have a voice. The worst thing we can
do is to do nothing and let the fundies think they are correct.

I respectfully disagree that one cannot counter faith with reason.
After all, this is how most of us who are Ex-Christians came to the
position we have now.However, reason is not the only arrow in our
quiver. I think when we educate the Christian about the real history of
their &quot;faith,&quot; such as the consequences of religious intolerance
(crusades, inquistion, etc), there's an emotional reaction -- hopefully
a revulsion at what has been done in the name of &quot;faith.&quot;Chucky Jesus

I agree with your position regarding emotion vs. rational thought, and
as Bob said, our only option is to keep speaking out against what we
see as delusion. That said, I also agree with you and Mr. Harris that
our prospects look dim. I will use my spouse as an example.She is
intelligent, hardworking, rational and thoughtful in all areas of her
life, except one. When it comes to belief in Jesus, she takes on a
completely different personality and becomes unwilling to hear
differing viewpoints. Not at all a fire and brimstone sort, she is more
tied up in the beatitudes, 1st corinthians &quot;love is patient, love is
kind&quot; type of belief. I see the difference between her and myself being
my willingness to look at another viewpoint and try to see things from
there. Sort of like John Loftus' Outsider Test (see the Debunking
Christianity website). I know she is far from alone in her viewpoint
about keeping 'special places' in her mind that are immune to
examination. From this I posit that there are those who, like me, are
willing to take a different viewpoint to see where it will lead, and
those, like my wife, who will not.As Chucky Jesus stated, one can
counter faith with reason, but only as regards reasonable people.

I feel that you CAN counter faith with Reason, but it has to happen
internally, that is, YOU have to question your OWN faith.We were
conditioned early on to totally reject any outside questioning as &quot;That
old Devil trying to test your Faith&quot;, so it just won't work unless you
happen across a person who is already questioning things for themselves.

We live at a time when faith still has huge control on certain groups
of people. I think that if you start in the south part of the US and
travel north into Canada you can see the gradual change in fundyism
from extreme to half assed reasonable. Could it be the hot weather in
the south which causes their brains to par boil and make those poor
folks different than we northerners?I don't think there is a quick fix
for this problem. I t may take another century before clear thinking in
most people will be the norm.We have tendency push our views about
atheism so hard that we sound like them. They have noticed this and are
now saying that we sound like we are the &quot;Church of Atheism&quot;. We do not
belong to &quot;churches&quot;, we are freethinkers.To date the worst form of
fundyism is Islam. They want us all to be Islamic or dead.They are the
real threat.

John of Indiana, I agree. Reason led me away from my faith. But those
same arguments, for years, bounced off me until I was ready to look for
truth whether or not it agreed with my religion. Once I took the
pre-conclusion away, everything else fell apart.I really am starting to
see religion as a sort of insanity, though. In the people I know, it's
Mostly Harmless (though globally, we can see otherwise). But it still
amounts to deciding first that This Over Here is the Inerrant Truth,
and then only taking whatever science leads to that.Having recently
come out as a gay man, I am seeing this like crazy in all the ex-gay
literature I find suddenly being sent my way. If you read it for long
enough, the truth comes out: Sexual Orientation can't be unchangeable
because the bible says homosexuality is wrong. So because of that
pre-conclusion, then ex-gay programs MUST work (despite overwhelming
evidence that almost never change gay people into straight people).I
noticed the pre-conclusions in a video that my wife and kids watched
the other day about how evolution cannot possibly be true. First of
all, the reason, according to the DVD, that scientists hold onto
evolutionary belief in spite of the overwhelming evidence that we were
created by the Christian God is that we don't want to do what the bible
says. The rest of the DVD made equally ridiculous leaps in logic. (It
also made me realize that I truly have been deconverted).Jamie,
Reluctantly atheist-leaning agnostic.

&quot;Must we wait for some fanatic with a ‘nuke to start a REAL Armageddon
before the religious communities at large realize their insanities? I
sometimes wonder if even the devastation of nuclear war would jar the
convictions of some people.&quot;----Monk:At first when reading this section
of your post, I nodded an affirmative that surely such a religious
nuclear war would make them see the truth about their invisible God(s),
but then I thought of other catastrophes that haven't made 'believers'
even blink an eye in their steadfast faith. Did such recent
catastrophes such as Hurricane Katrina or the Tsunami disaster in Asia
even put a dent in their undying faith. One would think such disasters
would make them wonder how God can permit such indiscriminate death and
destruction, but the answers the faithful seem to provide us range
from; &quot;God will take care of his own in the next life&quot;, or God is
sending a message to the planet earth that we need to shape-up or
suffer more such disasters, as punishment for our wicked ways; right up
to some fundies thinking that God needed to punish the overflow of
sinners in those area's; that surely deserved to die.Let's look at the
example of Katrina.I never hear a reasonable answer to how God chose to
ignore what must have been thousands of related Christian prayers, many
of them directly from those in the area of Katrina, that begged God
from the deepest part of their spirit to let them not die or at least
to spare their loved one's. Did we see any tangible evidence that only
those who begged God in a most sincere manner, were the only one's who
were saved. Should we assume if you didn't pray hard enough, that
either your loved one's died, or you yourself died.Can we assume that
all who survived Katrina, were the ones who's God decided met the
minimal requirements for begging for their lives, or the lives of
others they prayed for?Perhaps I have it all backwards and the reward
from God is actually to die during such disasters and those who lived
were the one's actually ignored by God.If that is the case, then surely
everyone who is both good and a believer, should have died during that
storm and on a more global scale, all the good believers should be
dying at a young age, to collect their early rewards in heaven?While
Katrina happened in an area of the USA that is mostly God fearing (even
while some say they love to 'sin away'), I bet if we could somehow poll
those who survived the storm waters that we'd find a couple of
interesting mind-sets going on.1. To those survivors who are still
religious, we would find that they are thanking their god for sparing
their lives and hearing their prayers. They would ignore that fact that
their god permitted their friends and loved one's to perish and their
own homes to be obliterated.These are the folks who insist god works in
mysterious ways and who are they to question such things about his
strange decisions.2. Then we have what are probably the few who were
non-religious, along with those who lost their faith in god because god
didn't hear their prayers, yet we still see both these groups still
alive. I suppose the Christian answer would be that god must have hope
that these folks will change their minds in the future. Again, who are
we to question his infinite knowledge, they will say to us
non-believers.3. Then surely we must have some who clearly were huge
sinners in god's eye's and yet they also are still alive. If we
speculate that the disaster was to punish the sinners for their errant
ways, then how do we explain that some terrible sinners are still
amongst the living?Let me guess, god only killed the sinners he knew
had no chance of ever changing so surely what we have left are
the &quot;redeemable sinners&quot;.Would taking such a poll show any odd trends
at all here?Would accounting for believing in god or praying one's best
prayers, show us that those who were faithful in god met a much
different outcome than normal statistics of chance would clearly show
us, as to who survived or didn't survive.Would it show us that those
who prayed for their homes to be spared the sweeping flood waters,
actually had their homes spared more so than those who failed to pray
or believe.I'm willing to argue that if we could see such a poll, that
we'd find that faith in any god, made absolutely zero difference in the
outcome of who/what was affected and who/what wasn't affected during
this tragedy.Alas, if we did have such a poll and showed it to the
faithful, their response would be either that we didn't take the poll
properly, or that Satan himself misdirected the results of the
blasphemous poll.As others have pointed out already, you can not reason
with folks who's minds were made up long ago about their own 'reality'.
To debate such things with most of them feels much like trying to
convince a 5 year old child who has a stubborn belief in Santa, that
there is no Santa to believe in. If the child isn't mature enough to
accept the adult belief that Santa isn't reality, then no amount of
evidence will persuade that child that their hero is nothing more than
fiction.No, I'm not saying that I would try to convince such a young
child that Santa is phoney, but if that same child still believed in
Santa when they reached something like their 15th birthday, I think I
would be justified in at least trying to show them the errors of their
ways at that point. My point is that trying to show reality to the god
believers is very much like trying to convince a firm child believer of
Santa's existence, that those presents aren't really from the north
pole.Such a child will make a million excuses as to why their must be a
santa and ignore all the evidence to the contrary, which parallels
adult god-believers who do the exact same thing. No Monk, I have no
reason to believe from history that even such a nuclear war would shake
the faith of any humans who believe that their god is running the show
down here from day to day. They will not conclude that their is no god
controlling earthy/human events, but once again will insist that god
works in mysterious ways and that us humans with our limited
understanding can never second guess God's motives.They will just
go-with-the-flow and maintain their faith, just as most of them
continue to do with smaller scale natural disasters we see all the
time.They will surely again attribute any deaths of the enemies to god
helping their own cause and make grand excuses for the casualties of
their own.The Atheist Tooth Fairy

I keep bouncing back and forth between hope and despair when thinking
about this issue. You already articulated the despair side, so I'll
mention one instance of hope I had recently. In discussion of science
and religion with a Christian friend (typical young/old earth stuff), I
mentioned how Copernicus and Galileo were persecuted by the church for
showing that the bible did not fit with reality. My friend said &quot;But
the bible does not say the earth is flat or that the son goes around
the earth.&quot; I countered by showing him the exact verses that were used
against Galileo and talk about the foundations of the earth, how the
earth does not move and the son does. He had never looked at or heard
these verses before, and was surprised to see them. All I got from him
was a quizzical &quot;Huh, how about that.&quot; and the conversation ended. And
thus a seed of doubt was planted.One thing I will disagree with on
Monk's post is his list of weapons we have. He mentions reason, logic,
PROOF, evidence, etc., but we ex-christians also have the bible. We
know it as well if not better than the christians themselves.They tend
to cherry pick the things in the bible that support their particular
flavor of theology, whereas we can use the entire thing to uncover its
inconsistencies, errors and just plain silliness.So if the religious
won't listen to reason, logic, etc. then use the foundation of their
faith against them, namely the bible. It is in our favor that it is
such an easy target.

The Atheist = Nihilist fallacy is one of my larger pet peeves. There is
only one basic tenet of faith required by atheists to give their life
meaning - &quot;It matters.&quot; The answer to this question is as diverse as
the Atheist population, but you can certainly find 'rational faith',
reasons to believe that your life and your actions matter without
resorting to believing in an anthropomorphic deity. As for the original
question of this thread... It is clear to me that the gift of
rationality is hardly universal. For those of us who share a burning
desire to truly understand the universe around us, we can never be
content with faith alone, and I believe this website is proof of that.
There are many, however, who simply do not care - The 'god' drug makes
them feel good, the biblical apologists provide the illusion of
rationality through fallacy, but the fallacies simply do not bother
them. For those people, no amount of rationality will be able to combat
their simple faith. The drive to expand your mind beyond animalistic
faith in the supernatural is something that an individual either
possesses or they do not, and for those who do not possess it, there is
nothing we can say or do to change their mind.

Hey Blair,You are missing the point. Monk says nothing of despair about
life in general, but only about the issue of living in a world free
from the irrationality that is religion in general and christianity in
particular.You have made a logical leap that is not supported by the
evidence at hand. And you are mean about it too. WTF?

Monk I believe you are correct in saying that faith is “nothing more
than an aberrant and misguided combination of otherwise healthy
emotions” but I have reservations about the “healthy” part of your
statement. I have known since I was a teenager that faith has a far
greater appeal to our emotional side than our reasoning side.
Christians know this whether they will admit to it or not.A commonly
asked question of christians who are doubting their faith or uncertain
about a life situation is “what does your heart tell you?”. This is
just another way of asking about the christian’s emotional state, as
christians claim that god does not talk to them in their brains rather
their hearts, or “heart of hearts” whatever that means. They believe
that because they are happy, sad, angry, etc, that it is god “speaking”
to them. (I guess that their all-powerful and all-knowing deity can’t
speak English!) They are taught from an early age to distrust reason,
beware the skeptic, listen to what you heart tells you, etc. The
emotional response is everything to the religiously pious.Reason does
not play a part in religion and never has, regardless of the numerous
and inane attempts at their making christianity sound scientific. I
have almost never seen a christian, who when presented with evidence
contrary to their belief, start to doubt (not to say it doesn’t happen,
obviously it does). Their most common response is to get angry. After
all, any proof against their position is an attack on their god. I live
with my best friends parents, who are elderly and need occasional help
around the house and they are very good friends of mine. However, if a
visitor should start asking me about my beliefs, the husband will jump
to his feet and start screaming obscenities at me. I do mean scream and
this is just the result of someone making an inquiry. In my life, this
is the usual response of members of the laity. Ministers, pastors and
the like have always been more level headed, genuinely interested in my
“side” and perfectly willing to compare my views with theirs in a
rational manner.I tend to agree with the other posters that a nuclear
armageddon would not solve anything. A large part of inciting the
populace to war is to assure them that their god is on their side. I
offer G. W. Bush as an example. So whoever came out the winner, if such
a thing were possible in a full scale atomic conflict, would simply
claim that theirs was the righteous cause and that their god led them
to victory. However, it is more likely the survivors would desperately
need the emotional comfort that religion provides and thus religion
would flourish even stronger, with the now dead secularists taking all
the blame. Blair we seek truth that is demonstratable and provable.
Your WTF comment is typical of the religious in that they assume that
they know the truth and the rest of us are profane. In fact, when
presented with contrary evidence we (generalizing this group) will
reevaluate our beliefs as part of our goal of seeking truth. When the
religious are presented with evidence contrary to their beliefs, they
will either deny the evidence or make up a new belief to refute the
evidence, immediately incorporate it into their belief system and then
claim that it is what they believed all along, that they know in their
hearts that it is true, god revealed it to them, etc. That is just one
of the many ways that the religious deceive themselves.Yes I also
despair, but not because I won’t spend eternity listening to the
agonized screams of my dammed family and friends as I grovel with love
and fear at the feet of loving and just, yet vengenful, maniacal power
freak. I despair because I see the possible end to what I hold dear, an
end brought about because a lot of people have decided that their god
is the true god and they are willing to go to war to prove it.

thinking we can only be effective when doubt has already been planted,

to cause the doubt.Aspentroll, ironically enough, I am from the South,
so we are not ALL insane, though I can tell you that if you think

I haven't see anyone comment on the most powerful tool in our arsenals,
our own stories. People will not listen when you tell them what you
think, but when you tell them your story of what you believe suddenly
it's as interesting as gossip. So make first person statements. I grew
up in a home with a devout Mom and Dad. Maybe I was a rebel or maybe
I'm a doubting Thomas, but I started really looking into Christianity
because I couldn't find anything outside the Bible that corroborated
anything in the Bible. Then go from there telling it as a story rather
than a debate.When you argue with people they'll dig their heels in
because they don't want you to prove them wrong. When you tell about
your personal search, why you started searching and what you've found
then it becomes interesting as human drama.

To a christian, persecution is the label they use for when they are not

No Monk, I have never tried that one. I am still trying to come to
grips with being told that they &quot;changed&quot; the study results and it is
now proven that prayer works, though she can't tell me where she read
that one.Still that is an interesting question and I will try that and
