&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Suppose you worked for the kind of organization that
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occasionally made you go to classes where you had to do
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; exercises like Creating Your Personal Vision Statement.  Like
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; so: [horseshitectomy]
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; What would you put?  If you're me, and I think some of you are,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your first pass would be to put &quot;Lead a life centered around my
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; values of not working for an organization that thinks this
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bullshit is useful&quot; and you'd list your strengths and talents as
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; including &quot;immediately recognizing bullshit when it is presented
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to me&quot; and &quot;ability to remain in upright position even when urge
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to run away screaming becomes overwhelming.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; See, you're just making fun of them now. That's not an exercise
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in creating a vision statement, that's a meta-exercise creating a
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vision statement that mocks vision statements. You need to take
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; this seriously if you hope to get anything useful out out if.

&gt;&gt; &gt; If Dover is actually looking inside herself for honest answers to
&gt;&gt; &gt; these questions, I'd advise her not to share these with her
&gt;&gt; &gt; employer.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The best bet with these exercises is to look for the socially
&gt;&gt; &gt; acceptable response. This will get the exercise over with the least
&gt;&gt; &gt; pain and the least harm. The socially acceptable response has to
&gt;&gt; &gt; resemble her a bit [probably everybody knows she doesn't suffer
&gt;&gt; &gt; fools gladly already], but beyond that it's not a good idea to
&gt;&gt; &gt; share your innermost thoughts with a soul-less corporation.

&gt;&gt; What he said.  Absolutely no good can come of honesty.  If you are
&gt;&gt; confident of your job security then smartass could be fun, but I
&gt;&gt; don't even really recommend that.  Collect smartass answers to share
&gt;&gt; with a carefully selected set of co-workers in the bar after hours.
&gt;&gt; While on the clock, stick to vague banalities.

&gt;&gt; I don't get this sort of thing any more, since I now work in the
&gt;&gt; legal industry.  There are many downsides to this business, not the
&gt;&gt; least of which is being surrounded by lawyers all day, but not being
&gt;&gt; asked to create Personal Vision Statements is a definite bonus.

&gt; So reading through this thread, it seems like Vague Banalities stands
&gt; out as the optimal answer on work-time.

&gt; Any managers here see a problem with this exercise?
">

As a currently unemployed manager, I will say that I see no significant
problem with it. Except that you (and Dover) have missed the point of the
exercise entirely. You've looked at the exercise, and failed to see the
meta-exercise.

The whole &quot;Building a Personal Vision Statement&quot; is a ruse. Management's
goal was to foster a stronger sense of unity and teamwork for the group,
and to ferret out the best people in the organization. How does one do
that?, you might ask. Easy: Introduce a common enemy. In this case, the
workshop leader. Who gives the group a task which has the thin veneer of
usefulness, but is teeming underneath with the maggots of stupidity.

The typical response to this sort of thing is that the staff segregates
into three groups. First, the Clueless/Asskisser group. They either think
that the activity is sincerely worthwhile, or will act as if they do
because they think that is what is wanted by management. Second, the
Apathetic group. They really don't care one way or the other, they just
want to go home so they can have a drink and watch Sportscenter or the
Daily Show. Third, the Bright group. They realize that the activity is
stupid, but also that they probably can't openly rebel against it too
much because some of their management just might be in the first group.

In an optimal situation, the Brights get together during lunch or after
hours and gripe about what a ball of shit this activity is, and what a
bunch of retards the first group are, and how useless the second group
is. They bond, and become a more effective group for having gone through
the experience together. They've built trust, and lived through a
miserable experience as a team. Plus they've all learned who the brown-
nosers and worthless people are (if they didn't already know), hence can
avoid them in the future, or at least make sure they get all the crap
jobs and the blame when things go wrong.

In a suboptimal situation, the Brights catch the workshop leader in an
alley after hours and eviscerate him (literally) and are arrested for
justifiable homicide. This is bad only because of the time off from work
it will lead to.

In a best case situation, they don't get caught. THOSE are the ones you
want to promote.
