South Africa warned on World Cup child sex tourism

August 15, 2007 - 10:36AM

South Africa risks becoming a magnet for paedophiles when it hosts the
2010 soccer World Cup as rising child sex tourism blights Africa's top
travel spots, activists said on Tuesday.

Every year thousands of children in mostly poor countries fall prey to
sex tourists. In Africa, a tourism boom coupled with high levels of
poverty, unemployment and illiteracy provide fertile ground for child
sex tourism to flourish.

Activists say South Africa in particular must take steps to guard
against child sex tourism ahead of the 2010 World Cup, when millions
of people are expected to visit the continent's richest country.

&quot;Africa could become the new Thailand, there is a big risk, a big
threat,&quot; said Jennifer Seif, the executive director of Fair Trade in
Tourism SA, during a media briefing in Cape Town.

Seif said western men away from home who sleep with 14 or 15 year old
girls made up the bulk of sex tourists, although younger children were
also at risk.

The South African police said they had not identified child sex
tourism as a particular threat related to the World Cup.

&quot;However, crimes against women and children are a national police
priority and we will continue to give attention to this as a
priority,&quot; said national police spokesman Vishnu Naidoo.

Seif urged South Africa and other countries to sign a code of conduct,
under which countries agree to train staff working in the tourism
industry on how to spot potential dangers and how to help halt the
exploitation of children.

The code is being funded by United Nations children's agency UNICEF
and supported by the World Tourism Organisation.

&quot;Within Africa there are five or six countries seen as on a-kind-of-
hotspot list, and South Africa is definitely one of them,&quot; said Seif,
listing Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal and Gambia as other countries
struggling with the phenomenon.

Kenya is so far the only African country which has endorsed and signed
the code, said Seif. South Africa is among countries worst affected by
the AIDS pandemic, with around 12 percent of its people infected by
the HIV virus.

By making such a statement Seif shows that she is an ignorant fool,
there are many countries with a far worse record for paedophilia than
Thailand.

IMO Thailand has been very successful in largely stamping out this
evil, anyone involved in such bastardry in LoS these days is taking a
huge risk, as several Australian pedos have discovered to their cost
as they rot away their worthless lives in jail.

Uh huh--while day in and day out, HIV positive local men have their way with
wives and others.

In other words, more hypocritical crap from one of the more pig-ignorant
victimizers of women and children, i.e., the South African government and
their compliant 'other blamers.'
JOHANNESBURG, Aug. 9 - The South African president, Thabo Mbeki, has fired
his deputy health minister, who was widely credited with waging an
aggressive assault on the nation's devastating AIDS epidemic this year.

South African anti-AIDS advocates called the firing of the deputy, Nozizwe
Madlala-Routledge, a setback to efforts to curb the spread of AIDS. South
Africa has one of the largest H.I.V.-positive populations in the world, but
until recently its programs to provide drugs and counseling to people with
AIDS have lagged behind those of some poorer nations.

&quot;This is a dreadful error of judgment that will harm public health care and
especially the response to the H.I.V. epidemic,&quot; said the Treatment Action
Campaign, South Africa's main anti-AIDS lobby group, in a statement. &quot;It
indicates that the president still remains opposed to the science of H.I.V.
and to appropriately responding to the epidemic.&quot;

``` yah, it is upon women and children that South Africa's AIDS 'intentional
ignorance' has most unwillfully (by them) fallen upon--or would Mbeki like
to figure that rape in and out of marriage is other than common or that MANY
South African men simply refuse to use condoms?

Correct, but it is after all, just what she is paid to do, while powerful

The risk is non-existent: south african pikkanins are ugly and the RSA has
such a high incidence of AIDS that no-one in his right mind would take the
risk of sexual contacts with a native.

I may find this unfail as well.

Besides the problem of abusing children it's an irresponsible
statement made by Mrs. Jennifer Seif to denounce Thailand this way.
That easy and simple spoken statement of Mrs. Seif is not helpful here
but IMHO rather counterproductive.

And I wonder how many remain *under* the age of 12.

This report from 1999 but a friend in Zimbabwe tells me that the
situation is far worse now.
Perhaps Ms Seif needs to look closer to home for her moral campaigning

You'd know better than I in this comparative respect, while what I referred
to by 'more can be' was that continuing marginalization (ethnic,
educational, and economic) of tribes people, and of others seeing scant hope
for their kids growing to be well-employed adults, underlies a willingness
to sell children into 'the trade.'
This was not to imply that criminal enforcement efforts have not become more
robust in LOS.
