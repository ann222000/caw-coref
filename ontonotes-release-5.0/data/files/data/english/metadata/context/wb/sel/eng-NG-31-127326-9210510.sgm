I would appreciate any comment on the U.S. Navy Mark III mod I made by
Scientific Instruments of Wisconsin.
Since I graduated to this instrument from a Davis plastic model this is
the only &quot;real&quot; sextant I have ever used.
I am quite pleased with it but have no bas9s for comparison.
Any comments?

The Navy Mark III made by Scientific Instruments in Milwaukee is an a
Plath Navistar.  As far as I know there were only two suppliers to the
Navy; the other was M. Low of New York city.  Scientific Instruments
made their sextants; Low bought theirs from Plath - so I've been
told.  I've made careful measurement comparisons between the Low Mark
III and the Navistar and have found them identical (except for the
Mark III's pistol-grip handle).

The Plath sextants have been a big disappointment to me.  After
hearing about them for almost 50 yrs, I looked through one for the
first time at the &quot;Celestial Celebration Weekend&quot; at the Mystic
Maritime Museum.  I was shocked -- I thought I was looking through a
darn toy.  The field of view was a mere fraction of the Navy Mark II
I'd been using for years; the shades obstructed the FOV; there was
annoying extraneous internal light; and the horizon only showed on the
left side!  I considered it a piece of junk.

After collecting seven popular sextant makes and models, I've
discovered that the Mark II has a rare design that I was blissfully
unaware of for decades.  It has a very wide VOF terrestrial scope with
an internal focal plane.  Just like a prism scope, even with a
traditional split-horizon mirror, they show a complete image across
the VOF using only half the objective, essentially just like a whole-
horizon mirror.  (You can see this in any binocs by placing a opaque
card over half of the objective.)  Most sextants have cheap Galilean
scopes that don't behave this way.

The Scientific Instruments Mark III has a stated arc accuracy of 9&quot;,
effectively the same as the Tamaya Spica 10&quot;, and, for common uses,
not practically better than the Astra IIIB's 20&quot;.  I've not seen any
stated accuracy claims for the Plath sextants.

I don't consider an arc-error correction table an accuracy claim.
After all, when the correction is made, what's the instrument's
accuracy??  And what's the correction between the 10d tabulated
values? ?  Incidentally, the Low Mark III arc-correction table that
I've seen has a max arc correction of 6&quot; between 0 and 105d.

Exactly. My SNO has a similar scope.
I was even puzzled first: why people need
the stupid full-view mirror which absorbs 1/2
of the light?

I tried to convince Ken (of Astra/Celestaire)
to make a similar scope for Astra; he does not listen.

Yes. And most people just don't know what a good sextant
scope is, because they had no opportunity to try.

I was somewhat intrigued to read this, about the field of view that remained
unobstructed even though half the objective was obscured, that applied to a
terrestrial scope and not to a Galilean. John Karl has had some interesting
things to say about sextant scopes, in his book &quot;Celestial Navigation in the
GPS age&quot;, that I haven't read elsewhere, and they provide fuel for thought.
[I hope to report back more on that book when I have had time to study it a
bit further, unless someone else jumps in first.]

In his book, John writes on page 105  &quot;Sextants use three types of
telescopes; the prism, the terrestrial, and the Galilean telescope&quot;. He
omits a fourth category, that of the inverting telescope. In my own Vernier
sextant, from the early 20th century, the higher-gain telescope, with x6 and
x12 eyepieces, is in that category; the other is x3, Galilean.. But it's not
only &quot;historical&quot; sextants that have such inverting scopes: I think Alex may
confirm that his modern Russian SNO is fitted similarly. An inverting scope
certainly takes a bit of getting used to, but once upon a time all high-gain
sextant scopes were made that way, and navigators managed to adapt to their
star-groups being upside down, and the sea being above the sky. So that
category deserves a mention.

I have compared 5 different scopes that I happen to have at home, from the
viewpoint of how they behave when a card is drawn across to obscure an
increasing part of the view, a few inches in front of the objective, to test
John's contention above, about which he gives more detail in his book.

The inverting scope from my old Vernier sextant, used with the higher-gain
(x12) eyepiece, behaves just as John describes. As you move a card across
the view, the brightness progessively dims, becoming dimmer from one side to
a slight extent, but you can't really see an image of the edge of the card.

I have compared that with two Galilean scopes with a gain of x3, one from a
plastic sextant, the other from my old Vernier sextant, and the two behave
similarly, and very differently from the x12. Just as John describes, the
card cuts off the image from one side, and you see a slightly fuzzy image of
the edge of the card, across the field of view.

And I have compared also two x6 telescopes, the inverting one from my
Vernier sextant with its x6 eyepiece, and a prismatic monocular, not from a
sextant at all. These two behave similarly, and in a way that is
intermediate between the x12 and the x3, with the card-edge apparent, but
much less sharp than with the x3.

What do I conclude from that evidence? It seems to me that this
field-of-view shadowing effect may not be related to the TYPE of scope, as
John implies, but simply to its magnification. John attributes it, instead,
to the presence or absence of an intermediate focal plane, between different
telescope types; being absent in the Galilean case. My observations don't
actually disprove that contention, but leave me unconvinced by it. I would
like some more evidence, or closer reasoning than John has provided, please.

John ends with the somewhat pejorative comment- &quot;Most sextants have cheap
Galilean scopes that don't behave this way.&quot; Maybe a Galilean scope is
cheaper than others, but in many circumstances it's the appropriate one to
use in low-gain applications, in a small craft at sea, when anything
stronger than x3 is just an embarrassment.

Hi All,

I really do not think you can compare apples and
oranges. Without some idea of the sextant model and
vintage it would be most difficult to comment.

I have used many makes and models of sextants,
octants, and quintants, including many by Plath, My
opinion is that no maker has a complete corner on the
market across the board.

Regards,

Henry

You have referenced both the MK II and MK III sextants in your post.  I have never
examined or used a MK II but vaguely recall years ago discussions regarding the
improvements the USN demanded in the MK III version.  One significant difference
was the MK III mirrors are much larger making measurements at sea significantly
easier.  Sometime after WWII, the MK II was widely available in the surplus market
at very low prices.  The same cannot be said for the MK III since very few MK III
legally made it to the market place.  There was a commercial version of the MK III
but I've not seen one and understand very few were sold.  Someone from Scientific
Instruments posted earlier this summer that they were selling the old inventory and I
assume the collimator used to certify the MK III sextant.

It seems unlikely to the me that anyone would choose the MK II if a MK III was
available.  I legally own a MK III and it has proven itself to be accurate and reliable.  I
usually use a ring sight and leave the telescope in the case.

FIELD OF VIEW
It's quite understandable that the small mirrors on the Navy Mark II
might lead to assuming it has a narrow field of view.  But this is not
the case.  The Mark II has a 9d FOV compared to most other sextants
that have something like a 4d FOV.  And the shades on many sextants
reduce their FOV even further.

The FOV has nothing to do with the objective lens diameter.  Rather
it's a question of practical optical engineering, which I know nothing
about.  The Mark II scope itself has a 9d FOV which is not obstructed
at all by the small mirrors.  So the sextant as a whole has the same
9d FOV.  The explanation for this is the &quot;apex&quot; of the FOV cone lies
near the objective lens, which is very close to the mirrors because
the scope is so long.  So its FOV is unobstructed by the mirrors.

Thus it's not true that other sextants, such as the Mark III or the
Plath Navistar, are easier to use at sea.  The exact opposite is true,
with the Mark II having more than twice the FOV of any sextant I have
seen. (Some prism scopes do have a FOV approaching 6d.)  For those
that haven't experienced the whole-horizon wide-FOV using a
traditional horizon mirror, it makes taking a sight so much more
enjoyable and esthetically beautiful.

Nonetheless, I'm not necessarily recommending the Mark II over other
sextants.  Its small aperture is a disadvantage,  making stars and the
twilight horizons noticeably dimmer than sextants with much larger
apertures.

WHOLE-HORIZON VIEWS with TRADITIONAL MIRRORS
Simple ray tracing (as I discuss in my book) shows why a lens using a
focal plane can image the entire field even though half of the
objective is blocked off.  This analysis is confirmed with all scopes
that I have seen that use an internal focal plane.

But using the same simple ray tracing, I can't exactly see why the
Galilean scope (no eternal focal plane) doesn't display the whole
field also.  I think it's related to vignetting, depth of field, and
practical optical engineering, not something explained by simple ray
tracing.  Nonetheless, experimentally, every Galilean scope I've seen
shows only half the FOV when the other half is blocked off at the
objective.

So I understand why prism scopes show the entire field, but not why
Galilean scopes don't.  In my book I explain the former and ignore the
latter -- you don't expect an author to confess his ignorance, do you?

John words- &quot;I think it's related to vignetting, depth of field, and
practical optical engineering, not something explained by simple ray
tracing.&quot; seem somewhat obscurantist to me. I have suggested, just as a
result of observation, and without any serious technical argument to back
it, that it could simply be a function of the magnification, but he appears
to ignore that notion. Why?

To make some sort of test we need two differently-contrived scopes; a
prismatic and a Galilean, with about the same level of magnification, to
compare. Unfortunately, there's no overlap between those that I have here.
The Galileans are only x3, the others x6 or more. Perhaps that's the general
case.

George,

I didn't mean my list (vignetting, depth of field, and practical
optical engineering) to be exhaustive.  Yes, the whole-horizon effect
could depend other factors, such as the entendue (the exit-pupil area
times the solid angle).  But I was simply saying I can't understand
the Galilean scope's behavior from elementary ray tracing, which is
the limit of my geometrical optical knowledge.

I have compared all combinations of a 3x15 terrestrial scope, and
6x30, 7x18, and 8x42 prism scopes (all with internal focal planes) and
2.5x24, 3x25, 3.5x40, and 4x40 Galilean scopes.  All of the four focal-
plane scopes show the same whole-horizon effect with trad-horizon
mirrors.  While all of the four Galilean scopes, having no focal
plane, show the half horizon.  Given the range of the various powers
and objective sizes, my tentative thought is that these different
views are not due to the magnification.

BTW, I much prefer the split horizon mirror with the prism scope,
giving me the wide FOV and the whole-horizon view.  It's true that the
6x30 scope is a bit too high powered, but in my experience, coupled
with its both its wider FOV and the whole-horizon view, the 6x power
is usually tolerable, and the combination quite desirable.

Free Plath sextants?

Gee Frank, where was I when they were handing them out?

Seriously, as a Plath enthusiast, I believe that Plath's reputation is
well-deserved. I cannot say I have used every brand of sextant but I have
used a lot and in my humble opinion, Plath is the best of the lot. When I
say &quot;Plath&quot; I am referring to both Cassens and Plath and C.Plath. The only
edge I give to C.Plath is the bronze (as opposed to brass) frame. My own
C.Plath has been modified to include the best of both Plaths. For example,
the Cassens and Plath handle can be completely disassembled for repair and
inspection, whereas the C.Plath handle cannot. Additionally, the upper
pillar on the C.Plath handle is glued into place (puzzling). Cassens and
Plath is firmly bolted. Anyhow, I replaced the C.Plath handle with a Cassens
and Plath handle to make the sextant as a whole, easier to repair. I've
replaced a few other C.Plath components with Cassens and Plath components
for the same reason. I like to think I have the best of both worlds.

And for anyone who has doubts about the superb engineering that went behind
C.Plath sextants, I invite people to examine one of their older model bubble
attachments (the version where the size of the bubble can be increased or
decreased).

I cannot, however, say the same for the post 1993 C.Plaths; ditto for their
later model of bubble attachment. I don't know what came over them when they
decided to deviate from the original designs. I understand that the
rationale was to cut down on the number of component parts, which from the
point of view of the repair man was a step backwards.

I rather admire John Karl for daring to say that he felt that the C.Plath he
examined was junk. I like a man who isn't afraid to take a shot at a sacred
cow. Nevertheless, I disagree with his assertion. I wonder if was John
examining one of the older Plath models with a much older telescope? I
believe that the design of the scope improved considerably in the 1960s.

I still want to take up John's advice and have a look at the Navy Mk II.

Robert

P.S. Frank, do give me advance notice when one of the big guns has a sextant
give away promotion drive?  I'll be happy to write up a review.

One of my Plaths is a Navistar &quot;look alike&quot;.  I say &quot;look alike&quot;
because it doesn't say Navistar on it, but only C. Plath, Hamburg,
Germany, S/N 49066.  But someone, who should know, says it is an early
Navistar, and is identical to later ones that do say Navistar.  I
wonder if any List members can date it from its S/N?  I put it at
about 1968.

It came from a sailing cat wrecked on a reef, without a certificate
or box; it had a cracked horizon shade, corroded mirror frames, broken
lighting system, and scrappy paint.  I fixed it all up - now it's in
like-new condition.  I've not bothered to calibrate the arc (I'd use
star-star distances) because (1) my eyes aren't good enough to be
effective, and (2) I just wanted it in my collection for the kind of
comparisons we've been talking about.  My other &quot;Navistar Plath&quot; is a
M. Low Navy Mark III, in excellent condition.  I've been told that it
is a Navistar made by Plath.

When I said that the Plath looked like junk, I was basing it on the
view through its scope.  I believe Plath is no different than all the
other manufacturers in this regard.  They make a fine mechanical
instrument, then put a cheap and poor performing Galilean scope on it
- the kind you find on a kid's toy.  These Galilean scopes don't
compare to a prism scope in terms of FOV, whole-horizon effect, and
extraneous light.  I don't know why manufacturers don't offer low-
power prism scopes - tradition?

I have no reason to think that the craftsmanship of the Plath is
anything but excellent,  However, as I've said before, I've never
heard of a guaranteed accuracy, even when using the published arc
corrections.  And what about a design that has troublesome one-wire
lighting, grounded via lubricated surfaces; has ineffective lighting
of the micrometer drum; and has the shades blocking the view?

So my heresy, blasphemy, and Anti-Christian thoughts are not against
Plath craftsmanship, but against some easily-corrected design flaws,
and use of Galilean scopes (both common to most all modern sextants).
If ye thinkest this still maketh me the blackest of sinners, I confess

carry-overs to degrees; being off one column or row in sight reduction

Absolution can be yours for a reasonable price.

I guess I have never noticed the problems you described because I mostly use
a 6 x 30 prismatic scope. I don't much care for the 4 X 40.

I agree that there are easily corrected flaws associated with Plath and
other sextants. The sad part is, those flaws may never be remedied because
GPS has pretty much rendered sextants obsolete. With such a small and
possibly shrinking market, those firms still producing them, may not have
the resources nor the desire to make the perfect sextant.

On that note, perhaps I should start another thread with the heading: &quot;If
you could design the perfect sextant&quot;.

Greg is correct. Perhaps I need to re-visit my comments. As a strong proponent of astro-nav, my hope is that it does not fade into oblivion and end up as a quirky hobby for backyard navigators and mathematicians. At best, it will serve as a back up system. At worst, well...for the most part, people want the easy way out and short cuts. Time will tell if the sextant will survive.

Even at that, I wonder can we realistically expect  that any further advances and design improvements will be made to the sextant when the market may not be large enough to support such R&amp;D?  I think not. And that is a pity. I often wonder what sextants would look like today if GPS had not come along and more or less rendered it to a back up position fixing system?

I would like to state from my perspective that celestial navigation
is surprising healthy today, and not as a hobby, and not as a back-
up, but as a &quot;cool&quot; thing to do.  For the same reason people want to
sail (it's not quick, and it's not cheap), they seem eager to adopt
celestial into their list of things they want to do and understand.
Perhaps it is self-reliance.  I honestly expect (but am by no means
sure) that celestial will survive for a long time.

There have been no advances because there has been no real
competition in the last 20 years except on price.  Some advances have
increased efficiency or in other ways have lowered the cost of
manufacturing. But those that haven't are destined to be tabled for a
while.  The price competition extends not only among metal sextants
but also between metal and plastic sextants.  Astra prices will
increase 12% in 2 months due to Chinese economics.  And that will be
a boon for Davis Instruments.

I do not believe in &quot;back up&quot; value of celestial
navigation. But I agree with what Ken says.
Consider the watch industry.
After the invention of quartz watch, many people thought
that it will become extinct.
Indeed, if your goal is to measure time precisely,
and have many features at low cost, nothing can beat
a $25 Casio watch. Still people pay big bucks for
advanced mechanical watches, (and even for
chronometers!). Because it is &quot;cool&quot;.
Of course, some minimum number of enthusiasts is necessary
to support production...

If I do something because it's &quot;cool&quot;, isn't that a hobby? I suppose the
problem is that the word &quot;hobby&quot; is a little down-market and trivializing.
So what's a better word? Intellectual sport, maybe?

By the way, I've known more than a few people who've taken up an interest in
celestial navigation because they think sextants are cool. But when they
discover that the sextant part is over in five minutes and the rest is
boring math, they quickly realize that it's quite the opposite of &quot;cool&quot;.

Nah. After playing with the sextant and doing the sums the magical part is
deriving a position, quite literally out of the sky above. And that is just

You will find the Navy Mark 3 far better than a Davis Plastic . The
mirrors are bigger, the frame is more stable when exposed to heat, the
extra weight will stablize the image in wind, better optics, easier to
maintain, shares parts with a Plath, great grip, and collectable. The
6x30 scope will give the best sight picture for Sun observations and
the 4x40 will give the brightest picture for star observations.

According to BOWDITCH telescopes with a wider objective have a greater
field of view. Inverting telescopes have one less lense and absorb
less light.

Extraneous reflected light on the Navy Mark 3 can be knocked out by a
3/8 inch piece of electrical tape placed at the base of the horizon
mirror. Field of view issues can be reduced if a sextant is preset to
the approximate altitude. Any navigation calculator will make short
work of the presetting task.

And if you use the flight navigation technique of precalculating your
sights you will  have the altitude available for preseetting your
sextant and be plotting your fix much sooner after the last shot.
