VIGIL FOR NYC CARRIAGE HORSES...Mark your calendars  for 9/20 at 5:30PM

Article Below On Yesterday's Death Of a Carriage  Horse

PLEASE FORWARD  /  CROSS POST

Please join  singer/actress  Nellie  McKay and the Coalition to Ban
Horse-Drawn Carriages at a  vigil for the carriage horses:

WHEN: Thursday - September 20, 2007 at 5:30  PM

WHERE: 59th St. (Central Park South) and  Central Park West - at the statue
(Columbus Circle) - it is the south/west  corner of Central Park

Candles and posters will be  provided.

A recent  audit by the NYC Comptroller's office, which was widely reported in
the press,  revealed the mistreatment and  horrendous conditions endured by
the carriage horses - something we  have pointed out for years.   Among its
findings, it called  attention to the failure of the  Department of Health to do
any inspections in the last year;   horses having no access to water or  shade
on the hack line on  Central Park South, and being forced to stand in pools
of water mixed  with urine because of lack of proper drainage.

Despite  the revelations of this report, the HORSES CONTINUE TO SUFFER!
NOTHING  HAS CHANGED EXCEPT EMPTY,  VAGUE  PROMISES.  More oversight  and/or
regulations will not make a difference in the lives of these dispirited  animals.

THE ONLY HUMANE SOLUTION IS A  BAN!

PLEASE JOIN US AS WE  CALL ON THE CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR TO PASS LEGISLATION
BANNING THIS CRUEL  INDUSTRY ONCE AND FOR ALL - AND TO PAY OUR RESPECTS TO THE
MANY HORSES WHO  HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS INDUSTRY AND ARE NO LONGER WITH US.

Carriage horse dies after tree crash near Central Park
BY KERRY BURKE and MICHAEL WHITE
DAILY NEWS STAFF  WRITERS
Saturday, September 15th 2007, 4:00  AM
A carriage  horse spooked by the beat of a drum made a deadly dash near
Central Park  yesterday, crashing into a tree and breaking a hind leg before
collapsing on the  street.

The 13-year-old mare, named Smoothie, went wild after a member of a
break-dancing troupe cracked a snare drum behind her on Central Park South, the
horse's owner and witnesses said.
Smoothie broke free of her carriage and charged a tree and another carriage,
sending a second horse plowing into a Mercedes-Benz about 4:30 p.m.
&quot;The horse ran against traffic and smashed into me,&quot; said the Mercedes'
driver, Layquan Rakin, a 22-year-old male model from Queens.
Rakin and his girlfriend, Lakesha Heidelberg, 20, were driving on Central
Park South when the galloping steed raced toward their luxury sedan.
&quot;It ran straight toward my car, it came face-first,&quot; Rakin said. &quot;I thought
it was going to run right up my car.&quot;
&quot;I thought it was over,&quot; Heidelerg added.
The second horse was not injured and no pedestrians were hurt during the
chaos.
Smoothie died on the pavement near Center Drive as concerned tourists and New
Yorkers attempted to comfort her.
&quot;This was a nice, gentle horse,&quot; said Smoothie's shattered owner, Cornelius
Byrne of Manhattan.
Byrne said the drum was sounded too close to Smoothie.
&quot;It was a terrible mistake around a mare,&quot; he said. &quot;She was a nice horse.
She would nuzzle. She was playful. She was special.&quot;
Smoothie belonged to an Amish woman before being sold to Byrne. The mare had
been working the circuit around Central Park for about a year, the owner
said.
The driver of Smoothie's carriage was standing alongside the cab with a
passenger when the drum sounded, he said.
&quot;He walked up and was beating it behind the horse,&quot; said witness Roger
Watkins, 59, of Connecticut. &quot;It spooked the horse. The horse reared up and  turned
the carriage over. It was trying to get around the light pole on the
sidewalk.&quot;
The drummer could not be located last night.
Byrne said Smoothie's driver took her death hard.
&quot;He's all broken up. He's hurting,&quot; Byrne said. &quot;He's crying.&quot;
Watkins said he helped guide the second horse away from the smashed Mercedes
and tied it to a street pole so it wouldn't be hurt more.
&quot;I grabbed him by the bridle,&quot; he said. &quot;I just calmed her down. Horses just
want to know someone's in charge.&quot;
Carolyn Daly, a spokeswoman for the Horse &amp; Carriage Association of New
York, called Smoothie's death &quot;devastating.&quot;
&quot;These aren't just horses, these are their family,&quot; she said.
