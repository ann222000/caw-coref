I don't know much about the situation, but I hope the writters get
what they ask for. From what I do understand they aren't getting their
fair share of the profits. When other are making money off of the
DVD's and the internet shows. How come the writter making the money
from those deals.

I support them.

I wonder what Dave is doing during the strike. I see so many other,
actors, producers, and even talk show host(the chin) Jay Leno, out
there showing their support. Dave probably try to have another baby
with Regina or whom ever he is with in his strange world.

Wow.  Wonder if the guy who cooks fries at McDonald's is pissed off he
isn't getting a share of every fry he cooks.  Let the writer buy
shares of the company, THEN he deserves a piece of the action.

so......
the shareholders are more important than the people doing the work??
Don't get me wrong, I've got nothin' against a capitalist system, as long as
it's run fairly. Let the shareholders do the writing, and see how fast
people will tune out, and that, Mr. Economist, translates to NO profit.

Ah, but that's the problem with the capitalist society is those with
the money have the power. The writers in the writers guild are trying
to equalise that power and keep it from being perverse and ripping
them off.

That being said, unions also have a nasty way of being corrupt, just
as bad as those with the money and power.

In my probably very unpopular opinion but I will say it anyway because
I am not a suck up. The LS writers *appear* to have an old boy cronism
going that staves out those who might be more creative, thus
protecting their jobs (understandably with a 13 week contract! Yikes).
This protectionism is creating an inbred humour because there is no
fresh or innovative ideas coming in. I see the interns adding a bit of
freshness but hence their ideas are probably pinched and they of
course do not receive the coveted royalties.

Show me a socialist system that has ever worked. The capitalist system has
its flaws. There are things happening today that should be dealt with. At
the top of my list would be credit cards with 24% APR interest, but that's a
whole other can-o-worms. NO wealth comes from government. We have the
standard of living that we have because of free enterprise.

scary that a billion dollar economy is based on debt, it pulls the rug
right out from under the true &quot;standard of living&quot; doesn't it?

Anyway serious wealth is created by many working for the benefit of
one.

Many governments *have* created wealth by being in the business of
collecting tax, again creating serious wealth by having many working
for one.

Communism, capitalism and socialism are all intertwined in modern
economies, I don't see any countries modeling pure forms.

I am refering to US, Australia, Britain, Germany and most other first
world countries. China, Russia and Yugoslavia have recently adopted,
in-part, capitalism in the later part of the 20th century.They are not
the many countries I am talking about.

However, you correctly assert China deals in slave labour and *this*
is a perfect example of what I am talking about as serious
concentrated wealth is created by many working for the benefit of one.
Unfortunately it is through forced slavery.

The British Monarchy is another really good example serious
concentrated wealth is created by many working for the benefit of one.
Thru the past milleniuum the Bristish Monarchy has accrued their
wealth through slavery and established caste system of conquered
lands.

Anyway Bill I am going to finished, please have the last word on the
subject.

Yes, the shareholders ARE more important than the people doing the
work.  They create, invest, and maintain the company and take the
risk.  All the worker does is sell the company their time by the hour
or by the year.  PERIOD.  And when the contract is up, they are free
to go somewhere else.

What value is a contract if the worker isn't going to live up to it.

The worker is a god damn liar.

If GM got &quot;tired&quot; of making cars, think they could just sell the works
on Friday and be in a new business on Monday?  If GM decided it didn't
want to work with these writers, think they could just shut the doors
and hire new people and tell the old to go home.  Or just go on strike
themselves?

Strikes are pure Socialist blackmail.  Reagan had the right idea with
the air traffic controllers.

You negotiate your best deal, sign the contract, cash your paychecks.
These writers must be pretty fucking stupid to box themselves into a
bad situation, then whine about it.

They should just demand all this shit before they sign their contract.
Pretend they have some honor.

These deadbeat writers could write their name to their contracts and
then break their word and walk away from that contract.

But since the union organizers are still getting paid during the
strike and the sheeple strikers only get a lot more money for the
richest in their unions, strike on, idiots.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong, I've got nothin' against a capitalist system,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; people will tune out, and that, Mr. Economist, translates to NO
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; profit.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ah, but that's the problem with the capitalist society is those with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the money have the power. The writers in the writers guild are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; trying
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to equalise that power and keep it from being perverse and ripping
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; them off.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Show me a socialist system that has ever worked. The capitalist system
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; its flaws. There are things happening today that should be dealt with.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; At
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the top of my list would be credit cards with 24% APR interest, but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that's a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; whole other can-o-worms. NO wealth comes from government. We have the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; standard of living that we have because of free enterprise.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Ah yes the &quot;Buisness of Debt&quot; is another whole can-o-worms. Sort of
&gt;&gt; &gt; scary that a billion dollar economy is based on debt, it pulls the rug
&gt;&gt; &gt; right out from under the true &quot;standard of living&quot; doesn't it?

&gt;&gt; no

&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway serious wealth is created by many working for the benefit of
&gt;&gt; &gt; one.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Many governments *have* created wealth by being in the business of
&gt;&gt; &gt; collecting tax, again creating serious wealth by having many working
&gt;&gt; &gt; for one.

&gt;&gt; that's a lie.
&gt;&gt; or perhaps you do know something I don't. Cuba does have a standard of
&gt;&gt; living equal to ours? Russia? Yugoslavia? China, where they deal in slave
&gt;&gt; labor, endorsed by Willie Clinton's trade deal with them, which has, due
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; the trade imbalance, set our dollar plunging???

&gt; I am refering to US, Australia, Britain, Germany and most other first
&gt; world countries. China, Russia and Yugoslavia have recently adopted,
&gt; in-part, capitalism in the later part of the 20th century.They are not
&gt; the many countries I am talking about.

yes? Australia, Britain and Germany all have systems where work is
rewarded...

&gt; However, you correctly assert China deals in slave labour and *this*

WGA holds rally on Fifth Avenue
400 participants took part in the session

Loud chants rang out and hundreds of picketers spilled onto Fifth
Avenue on Wednesday as Gotham's WGA strikers held the most energetic
rally of the 10-day-old strike.

A large, inflatable, cigar-chomping pig stood at the corner of Fifth
and 55th Street outside the World of Disney store. Spanning the full
block between 55th and 56th were barricades that edged out into Fifth
once it was clear that the picketers would not be contained to the
sidewalk.

The Writers Guild of America East estimated a total of 400
participants took part in the four-hour session, though the crowd
peaked well below that level. While some notables, including David
Hyde Piece, &quot;Law and Order: SVU&quot; exec producer Warren Leight and &quot;Late
Show with David Letterman&quot; straight man Rupert of the Hello Deli
stopped by, the takeaway was about the loud and mobilized group rather
than boldface names.

&quot;Hi-ho! Hi-ho! No work 'till we get dough!&quot; went one of the chants.
Drivers in passing taxis and trucks honked and waved. Passersby,
especially the tourists who flock to the stores along Fifth Avenue,
stopped and snapped photos, though many of them continued inside the
Disney store, which continued to see decent foot traffic for a
Wednesday.

&quot;I've had a lot of pedestrians telling me, 'Hey, good luck with
this,'&quot; said &quot;Letterman&quot; scribe Steve Young, a 17-year show vet who
wasn't yet a pro during the 1988 strike. &quot;I don't know if the approval
of tourists is going to bring Les Moonves to his knees, but it makes
us feel good.&quot;

The East and West branches of the WGA are much more unified than in
the past, Young said. &quot;Had this strike happened two years ago, we
would have been in much worse shape, but looking at how today turned
out, it's a pretty united front.&quot;

IATSE's Short takes aim at WGA
Union head calls guild leaders 'strike happy'

Thomas Short, president of the Intl. Alliance of Theatrical Stage
Employees, is blasting the Writers Guild of America and accusing its
leaders of being determined to go on strike.

&quot;It's time to put egos aside and recognize how crucial it is to get
everyone back to work, before there is irreversible damage from which
this industry can never recover,&quot; Short said in a letter to WGA West
president Patric Verrone. (Click here to read Short's letter to
Verrone on Variety's strike blog.)

IATSE, which reps most below-the-line employees, released the letter
Wednesday, the 10th day of the WGA strike. No new talks are scheduled
even though the guild and the companies have not met since
negotiations collapsed Nov. 4.

Verrone was in D.C. on Wednesday along with SAG topper Alan Rosenberg
meeting with members of Congress and other policymakers. In a
statement issued in response to Short's letter, Verrone said: &quot;Our
fight should be your fight,&quot; and noted that &quot;for every four cents
writers receive in theaterical residuals, directors receive four
cents, actors receive 12 cents and the members of your union receive
20 cents in contributions to their health fund.&quot; (Click here to see
Verrone's letter.)

WGA has continued to picket more than a dozen locations in Los Angeles
and staged a protest outside the World of Disney store on Fifth Avenue
in New York on Wednesday, drawing more than 400 supporters.

A large, inflatable, cigar-chomping pig stood at Fifth and 55th Street
outside the World of Disney store. Barricades ran the length of the
block between 55th and 56th when it became clear that the picketers
would not be contained to the sidewalk.

&quot;I've had a lot of pedestrians telling me, 'Hey, good luck with
this,'&quot; said &quot;Late Show With David Letterman&quot; scribe Steve Young. &quot;I
don't know if the approval of tourists is going to bring Les Moonves
to his knees, but it makes us feel good.&quot;

More than 50 TV series have been shut down by the strike, Short wrote
in his letter to the WGA West.

&quot;More will come,&quot; he added. &quot;Thousands are losing their jobs every
day. The IATSE alone has over 50,000 members working in motion
picture, television and broadcasting and tens of thousands more are
losing jobs in related fields.&quot;

The IATSE topper noted that he took issue late last year with Verrone
over the WGA's defense of its strategy in delaying contract talks with
studios and nets until the summer.

&quot;When I phoned you on Nov. 28, 2006, to ask you to reconsider the
timing of negotiations, you refused,&quot; Short said. &quot;It now seems that
you were intending that there be a strike no matter what you were
offered, or what conditions the industry faced when your contract
expired at the end of October.&quot;

Short also took aim at recent comments by WGA West exec director David
Young, in which the exec said he would not apologize for the strike's
economic impact.

&quot;This is hardly the point of view of a responsible labor leader,
someone dedicated to the preservation of an industry that has
supported the economies of several major cities for decades,&quot; he
added.

Verrone's response emphasized the WGA's view that it was the AMPTP
that broke off talks on Nov. 4. &quot;Please help us by doing everything
you can to get the AMPTP to come back to the table and settle this
strike,&quot; the statement said.

The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers is demanding
that the WGA put the strike on hold for a few days as a condition of
resuming negotiations. But WGA leaders are insisting they can't return
to the table until the AMPTP responds more adequately to the guild's
last proposal.

Short's salvo is the latest outburst in a long line of hostilities
between the unions, which have differed over which union should have
jurisdiction over writers on reality shows and animation. For its
part, WGA West exec Young accused Short last year of being a shill for
the companies and using strikebreaking tactics to prevent the WGA from
organizing staffers on the CW reality show &quot;America's Next Top Model.&quot;

Short and the WGA tangled last month over the guild's plan to bar WGA
members from penning animated features under its strike rules. Short
referred to the writers union as &quot;the house of hate commonly known as
the Writers Guild of America West&quot; and pledged he'd take the WGA to
court since feature animation writing is IATSE's turf through its
Animation Guild, which operates as Local 839.

When the WGA struck three weeks later, it had quietly altered the
strike rules so that WGA members would allowed to write animated
features under IATSE contracts.

At the Disney protest Wednesday, leaflets noted that the WGA is
seeking 2.5% of revenues from work for the Internet or work that's
delivered digitally.

&quot;But the studios are refusing to discuss a fair deal,&quot; the missive
said. &quot;So we've been forced to take our case to you.&quot;

One of the chants - &quot;Hey, hey, ho, ho, Disney needs to share the
dough.&quot;

The war of words continued with Young sending a message to members
late Tuesday night, in which he accused the AMPTP of making misleading
statements such as the assertion that writers are already paid
residuals for digital downloads.

&quot;What they don't say is that we are paid one third of one cent per
dollar received by studios for digital downloads,&quot; Young said. &quot;One
third of a cent. This is a paltry amount for work that we created. We
currently earn two cents per dollar on ad-supported TV programming.&quot;

Young noted that the AMPTP said writers received $260 million in
residuals in 2006. &quot;What they don't say is that this was our
contractual share of over $20 billion the studios made from work that
we created,&quot; he added. &quot;The companies' rollbacks would more than cut
our residuals in half.&quot;

Both sides remain at odds over how negotiations ended on Nov. 4 with
each accusing the other of causing the talks to collapse. Young noted
in the message that the AMPTP has asserted when negotiations collapsed
an offer was on the table to pay writers for Internet streaming.

&quot;This is misleading,&quot; he added. &quot;What they don't say is that it was
merely a partial offer, and there was nothing else but rollbacks on
the table when they left. They have yet to deliver an economic
proposal after three and a half months of our requesting one. We have
presented them with ours, but they still refuse to negotiate.&quot;

The AMPTP has insisted that it had an economic package on the table
when talks ended.
