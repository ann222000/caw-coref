I tripped upon this in my Ebay wanderings. The opening bid is totally absurd, but it
is really nice. I wouldn't be ashamed to have it on display in my house if it was
functional. Zenith radio, TV, record changer combo (Cobra Matic changer)from the 50's.
I'm not into TVs or post WW-II radios or electric phonographs, but this one really
spoke to me for some reason. Maybe because it looked to be in nice condition.(Or was
it those da*n voices from my Cheerios again....) Personally I'd go a couple of hundred
if it was local.

Oh yeah, an item number might help #170067758641  My Cheerios forgot to remind me of
that.

It looks nice anyway. A shekel shy of a grand is a bit much, even if it
is working, but I see you've already written to him. So he wants to
clear it out rather than move it yet if it doesn't sell he won't mind
keeping it?

That's not a really good bluff.

Bluff? I just wrote to him and explained why that set may not be worth $995. He was
really receptive and said if it didn't sell he would keep it, as he should. It's great
looking, but only worth the Cobra Matic changer at this point. He had it on display
and will keep it there if it doesn't sell for his absurd price. It sounds like he's
into it deeper than a couple of hundred.
