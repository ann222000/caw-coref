Cara will be starting this stuff tomorrow. Has anyone else had
this?  What were the side effects?

Kelli took Cellcept for a couple of years and it did wonders for her.
It did much better for her and actually decreased her lesions,
according to her neuro.  (This was about 6 - 9 years ago before it was
more widely used than it is now, although I think MS is still an off-
label use for it now.)

She quit taking it because she got MRSI, (so-called &quot;drug resistant
staph&quot;,) and had a huge chunk of her leg flesh surgically removed as
they tried to get rid of the infection.  Fortunately they got it
before it got in the muscle fascia.  She quit the Cellcept after that,
as the premise behind it is that it pretty much immobilizes your
immune system, and they told her that it might have had something to
do with her body not being able to fight off the infection as well as
if she hadn't been taking it.  Her neuro thought it would be OK, but
she was too uneasy with it after having been through it.

That is NOT to say that everyone who takes it is going to have that
problem.  She worked in a big city hospital and was far more likely,
especially at that time, to have picked up MRSI than the average
person.

The man side-effect one has with it is that if you take too high a
dose, it causes diarrhea.

She praised it when she was taking it.  She said it made her feel
better, to bounce back between exacerbations, and to avoid
exacerbations than before she took it.  I wish she would try it again
as she is having severe speech problems right now.  But I also
understand her uneasiness about it.

FYI, for those who don't know what Cellcept is, it's a drug used to
prevent rejection of new organs in transplant patients, hence the
effect on the immune system.

I hope this helps some.  I would encourage her to do it as it does
help, at least in some people.

I tried this stuff, but it didn't work for me.  As for the side
effects, I remember it decreasing my appetite.  It could be because
you have to wait an hour or so (if I remember correctly) to eat after
you take the pill, or is it before?  All I know is that you had to
plan out when you were going to have your meals :(  Good luck with it!
