Are there no new ideas to be invented? Are today's ideas really just
borrowed from previous times? Postmodernism says this is so, and it's
one of the hottest philosophies of today. The book provides an
indispensable guide to this often-demanding terrain for readers
encountering theories of postmodernism for the first time and places
the subject in a broad context. It introduces a wide range of ideas,
thinkers, and views yet maintains the readers' focus by linking theory
with concrete examples from both &quot;high&quot; and &quot;popular&quot; culture. After
completing Teach Yourself Postmodernism, readers will never look at
their world the same way again.

now, may the unfinished modernity fetish boys stand up and make
criticism of postmodernism that doesnt whine about its unreadability...

Steven Pinker reviews conflicting theories about what art is for, he
does find problems. Although one of these stems from the desire for
status, in the artist as a striving for novelty, and in the audience
as an instance of conspicuous consumption, his main culprits are
modernism and postmodernism. He corrects Virginia Woolf's jocular
remark that human nature (actually, she wrote &quot;human character&quot;)
changed in 1910 by explaining that &quot;Modernism certainly proceeded as
if human nature had changed.

All the tricks that artists had used for millennia to please the human
palate were cast aside.&quot; Taking cues from Frederick Turner regarding
preferences built into our natures over millions of years, Pinker
accuses modernism and postmodernism of being &quot;based on a false theory
of human psychology, the Blank Slate.&quot;

They &quot;cling to a theory of perception that was rejected long ago: that
the sense organs present the brain with a tableau of raw colors and
sounds and that everything else in perceptual experience is a learned
social construction,&quot; which, needless to say, modernism and
postmodernism have tried to shake up and disorient.

But the visual system of the brain is hardly so passive: it
irresistibly organizes sense data &quot;into surfaces, colors, motions, and
three-dimensional objects. We can no more turn the system off and get
immediate access to pure sensory experience than we can override our
stomachs and tell them when to release their digestive enzymes.&quot;

Beyond this, the visual system &quot;colors our visual experience with
universal emotions and aesthetic pleasures,&quot; so that people prefer
savannah landscapes, beautiful faces, consonant sounds, narrative
fiction, and so on.

The attempts by modernist writers and artists to &quot;make it new,&quot; to cut
the connections between biologically sanctioned forms and aesthetic
response, have been only a partial success, as the failure of serial
music has demonstrated.

Piss Christ and Tilted Arc, to name two against-the-grain visual
artifacts that come to mind, did not enchant their viewers, however
self-satisfied their creators seem to have been. Although Pinker
enthusiastically commends a wide range of modernism's products, he is
not happy with its disdain of &quot;beauty&quot; and its desire to frustrate our
in-built nostalgia for the mud from which we spring.

Moreover, the need to succeed in a market-driven society has
encouraged artists to push things very far for their shock, media, and
commercial values. Pinker has a warm spot for the primal directness of
&quot;middlebrow realistic fiction&quot; because, as he believes, there is no
necessary connection between the pretensions of elite high art and
moral enlightenment.
Quoting George Steiner to the effect that the Nazis could listen to
Schubert in the morning and gas Jews in the afternoon, he is less
impressed with the ethical claims of radical artists than with the
unconscious psychobiological nourishment provided by more or less
archetypical art forms.

&quot;The dominant theories of elite art and criticism in the twentieth
century grew out of a militant denial of human nature. One legacy is
ugly, baffling, and insulting art. The other is pretentious and
unintelligible scholarship.&quot;

I have spent a lot of my life working on questions such as these,
using the only methods I know of; those condemned here as &quot;science&quot;,
&quot;rationality&quot;, &quot;logic&quot; and so on. I therefore read the papers with
some hope that they would help me &quot;transcend&quot; these limitations, or
perhaps suggest an entirely different course. I'm afraid I was
disappointed. Admittedly, that may be my own limitation. Quite
regularly, &quot;my eyes glaze over&quot; when I read polysyllabic discourse on
the themes of poststructuralism and postmodernism; what I understand
is largely truism or error, but that is only a fraction of the total
word count. True, there are lots of other things I don't understand:
the articles in the current issues of math and physics journals, for
example. But there is a difference. In the latter case, I know how to
get to understand them, and have done so, in cases of particular
interest to me; and I also know that people in these fields can
explain the contents to me at my level, so that I can gain what
(partial) understanding I may want. In contrast, no one seems to be
able to explain to me why the latest post-this-and-that is (for the
most part) other than truism, error, or gibberish, and I do not know
how to proceed.

Isn't it the catch that postmodernism is a critique,
whereas modernism was/is a movement ?

I think the work of those guys I mentioned to be of
profound relevance to film. And the postmodern tag
to be merely a convenient McGuffin.

and its bedfellow, Art music, perhaps with literature
and several of the other arts.

&quot;Yea, I have something to say&quot;....&quot;Uh.....WHAT!!?&quot;  [visa vie Geico caveman
commercial]

As I was reading, though interesting, it dawned on me what a load of horse
manure this all was...intellectualism gone mad and the very thing I
personally find so foul in the 'modern' world.  I also see how it is loaded
with arrogant egotism...and how this kind of intellectualism could very well
lead someone to create Piss Christ or write the Fountainhead in some screwed
up twisted rationalized attempt to sever ties with the 'nostaligic aesthetic
mud' the masses pine for.  Why do I get this image of a bunch lesbians
lounging around in squalid backroom parlours getting loaded on cocaine while
sipping absynth???  Every damn thing we ever utter, do, or create has a
spiritual connotation to it; an underlying realization of self one way or
another.

Well, the metasystem transition guarantees that new ideas are formed
from old, in fact, ideas are formed at the meta level to the
substrate, forming a whole new organism via paradigm shift.
So.......surprise, surprise, surprise, Gomer, there are new ideas!

&quot;All you are is just another system forming a metasystem transition.&quot;

That's been posted a few times.  I kinda wonder why, since
Chomsky firmly refuses to support the criticism he's
directing at Derrida and others.  &quot;...sorry to make unsupported
comments,&quot; he says, &quot;but I was asked, and therefore am
answering.&quot;  All we've got here is Chomsky giving his two cents.

Maybe less.  Chomsky says he hasn't read very far into the
material he's attacking and grants he understood only some
part of that little.  So while he says it wouldn't be worth his
time to offer evidence, it's less than clear that he could
back up his criticism even if he felt like going to the trouble.

In one place, tho, Chomsky accidently hits the nail on the
head, thumping himself with his own hammer:

The whole debate, then, is an odd one. On one
side, angry charges and denunciations, on the
other, the request for some evidence and
argument to support them, to which the response
is more angry charges but, strikingly, no
evidence or argument. Again, one is led to ask
why.

Bingo.  Chomsky offers charges and denunciations, refusing
in advance any request to support them.  Thus &quot;a striking
absence of evidence or argument,&quot; explainable in his case by an
admitted lack of reading.
