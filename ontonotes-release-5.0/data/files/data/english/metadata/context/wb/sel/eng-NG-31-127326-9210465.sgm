Ted sent me a copy of his book, in trade for a copy of my historical atlas
software. I've been reading through it for a few days now. It's fascinating.
I find something intriguing on almost every page. I would not say that I
agree with ALL of his conclusions, but that does not detract from the book's
value in any way. The prose is breezy and clear, and there are plenty of
useful diagrams, including one that is intriguingly labeled &quot;A drawing of
the author's working model of Newton's brass marine octant.&quot; Got a photo for
us, Ted?? :-) The only real flaw I have found so far is that the references
are a little sparse. For one example, he mentions that one Mary Mumford,
resident of the Scillies, confessed on her deathbed to possessing Sir
Cloudesley Shovell's large emerald ring. How do we know it was &quot;Mary
Mumford&quot; and what was the source for that? I also noticed a certain parallel
to Sobel's story when approaching the &quot;bad guy&quot; problem. Dava Sobel, in her
book, wrote, &quot;A story that hails a hero must also hiss at a villain --in
this case, the Reverend Nevil Maskelyne.&quot; While Ted Gerrard, in his book,
writes, &quot;If this story must have a villain to balance the heroic qualities
of Halley, Cloudesley Shovell is the man who best fits the part.&quot; Just so
we're clear here, I'm not suggesting any sort of direct influence, just a
parallel approach to history, an approach that may get one into trouble.
Heroes and villains? All of us mortals are flawed, imperfect beings.

As a teaser, I'll quote a paragraph from the back cover of the book:
&quot;Sir Isaac Newton never mentioned his only invention again and Captain
Edmond Halley, RN, never published any details of how he determined either
latitude or longitude on any of his voyages of discovery aboard Paramore. He
did however publish a warning to mariners over the incorrect location of the
Scilly Isles - a warning his commander-in-chief Admiral Sir Cloudesley
Shovell foolishly ignored.&quot;

For general inerest, I'm attaching a copy of the actual pages which include
the warning about the latitude of the Scillies as published in the
Transactions of the Royal Society in 1701/02.

Ted's theory, that Shovell &quot;foolishly ignored&quot; this refined latitude, makes
sense only if Shovell did NOT believe his vessels were in a different
longitude. That is, if he had NO firm idea of his vessels' longitude, or if
he believed his longitude might be rather close to the longitude of the
Scillies, then of course he would have avoided ANY reported latitude for the
Scillies. But if he believed his longitude placed him a day's sail or more
to the west of the Scillies, then it's a different matter altogether. A
commander orders his ships to sail into stormy darkness only if he believes
he's nowhere near land --unless he's an idiot, which, I admit, is always a
possibility.

Frank,
I only read a 10 pages advertizing booklet of
this book, but the thing that surprised me most
at one was the mentioning of Capitan Edmund Halley, RN.
It is amazing that this captain's name
is exactly the same as of the
great astronomer (and Newton's friend) Edmund Halley.
I was so surprised that I even checked the biography
of Edmund Halley (the astronomer). And of course it
is very unloikely that this is the same person:-)

=========================

Response from George-

Alex's scepticism is misplaced. They are indeed one and the same. What was
the &quot;biography&quot; that  Alex claims to have checked? It must have been a VERY
incomplete one. I recommend he reads Ted's &quot;Astronomical Minds&quot;, as an
antidote.

Halley had quite a lot of experience at sea, as Ted Gerrard's book would
tell him, and even better, a full Halley biography, of which the best is by
Alan Cook (1998).

At the age of 21 he spent a year in the South Atlantic island of St. Helena,
surveying the Southern skies. Presumably, his travel was as a passenger, in
a ship going to / from Cape Town.

At the age of 32, he had surveyed the Thames estuary , and presented his
results to the Royal Society. According to Gerrard, this went as far as the
Dutch coast, at the behest of the King, William III. At 35, he was running
salvage operations in the English Channel, of a treasure-laden vessel,
involving the first use of a diving bell.

But his main seagoing achievements were in those three voyages, from 1698 to
1701, in the Royal Navy vessel Paramore, a tiny pink of 89 tons, newly
constructed for the job with a complement of 20, for which he was appointed
Captain by the Navy. The first two, into the Atlantic, were to survey the
magnetic variation, mainly in a fruitless attempt to determine longitude by
that means (it was possible, but only in special circumstances, such as the
approach to the Cape of Good Hope). The third, a survey of the English
Channel, was to plot the tides and tidal streams, and the magnetic variation
too, in view of the many losses of vessels that were occurring in those
waters.

In those Atlantic surveys, Halley's main difficulty was not in measuring the
variation out in the ocean, but to know what his longitude was where he did
so. It didn't call for high precision, and Halley devised his own technique
for doing the job, a near-relation of the lunar distance method. He found
the position of the Moon with respect to the star background, in a way that
called for an intimate acquaintance with the stars near the ecliptic, that
only an astronomer would have. For navigational purposed, a longitude result
would be needed there and than, but Halley's need could be met by later
comparison with observed Moon positions, measured back in England, at the
same date. No method could work accurately on-the-spot without precise
prediction of just where the Moon would be. Halley spent most of his later
years working toward that goal.

In my own view, Halley's Atlantic voyages, made so early in the history of
longitude navigation, were in the first rank of navigational achievement,
and have never been properly appreciated. A full account from his journals
didn't appear until Thrower's Hakluyt edition of 1981. Halley is
frustratingly vague (or secretive) about his navigational techniques, and
Thrower's analysis of those is somewhat limited. Ted Gerrard's
investigations are the fullest that I'm aware of, but there is more detailed
work that ought to be done.

Google Earth

Those of you who have access to Google Earth might care to try out their navigation skills. On 25th April, 1700 Edmond Halley's ship anchored in the bay to the southwest of the Atlantic Island of Trinidade before Halley landed and claimed the island for King William III.

The place close to where Paramore dropped anchor is (co-incidentally) marked with a blue spot on the Google map. Halley placed the island as being at 29.50W and between 20.25 and 20.29S by measuring the moon's position amongst the Hyades cluster 4 days earlier (longitude + DR) and a noon sun fix on arrival, the sun being at an altitude of 56 degrees.

Zooming in on the island one can even identify exactly where Halley landed and the rocky gully where his crew replenished their water supplies. Try as I might I could not locate the descendants of the goats and pigs he left behind.

This positional fix (some 30 minutes of longitude in error and more or less spot on latitudinally) must surely rate as one of the most remarkable navigational achievements of all time.

One wonders what Halley (or Newton) would have made of Google Earth?

Warning. If you type Trinidade in the Google search you will finish up in the middle of Brazil.

I've been asked for my opinions about Ted Gerrard's new book, &quot;Astronomical
Minds&quot;. With a slight involvement, having been invited to scan an early
draft for technical mistakes as part of the error-checking process, it's not
possible to offer a completely independent review. But I'll be as
independent as I can, and you can take that for what it's worth.

It covers that fertile century of scientific development from roughly 1650
to 1750, concentrating exclusively on English work, with the Royal Society
at its centre. Many well-known names are drawn in, Wren, Hooke, Newton,
Flamsteed, Halley, Shovell, Hadley, Harrison, and the book ends about the
time when Maskelyne and Cook would appear on scene. The story told by
Gerrard deals mainly with the quest for a way to find longitude at sea. It
acts as a useful counter to the one-sided picture that's been built up
before by Sobel, who concentrated on Harrison's watch-work. Here, the
timekeepers gets shorter shrift, and the emphasis is on astronomical
solutions. If there's a hero, it's Edmond Halley (and deservedly so). If a
villain, that's Shovell.

The book is a riveting read. It's written in a racy style, and if you're an
academic historian, that may set your teeth on edge. It has the great
advantage of having been written by an experienced navigator, not by a
historian confined to a library. So Ted shows his great insight into the
practical problems that beset a navigator in finding his position at sea. He
allows himself much more freedom to speculate than a historian would, which
is fine by me. The weakness, in my view, is the way that plots and intrigues
are discovered under every bush. My own view of history is that cockups play
a larger part than conspiracies; but everyone to his own taste.

Ted enjoys relating the interactions between these larger-than-life
characters, their feuds and their follies. But also, he has delved deeply
into the records, so this is far more than a rehash of the standard texts,
and becomes a real quest into the way that scientific knowledge unfolded. He
has used modern tools, such as sky simulation programs, which have allowed
him (and now allow us) to follow events such as Halley's star appulses with
the Moon. All this has enabled him to draw conclusions, such as Halley's use
of Newton's quadrant, which are new or unrecognised. His sources are well
referenced, but with occasional gaps.

Any dislikes? Yes, two. He devotes space to discovering coded hidden
meanings in inscriptions and epitaphs. No doubt, a lot of that sort of thing
went on in the era, but it leaves me a bit cold. If you're a crossword
enthusiast, it may be for you. Or you can skip those bits, like I did. And
the other? I couldn't get on with his indexing scheme.

The book costs £13.95 (about US$29), surface shipping worldwide included,

I had no idea what the word appulse meant.   I found a definition
the approach of one body to another, so I  assume?  that the phrase
Halleys star appulses - it something like occultations?

Thanks for adding to my vocabulary, although I may never use
the word again.

I see in other messages on this list that occultations were used
as a sort of almanac, a way to mark a point in time,  when
clocks were still not accurate enough to for surveying or
navigation.  Here is where I will shamelessy speculate that
almanacs of that time may have stated something like there
will be an occultation of a specific ecliptic star by the moon at
approx midnight?

Think of a lunar occultation as a special case of a lunar distance -
where the distance is precisely 0.00 degrees.  Otherwise, the method is
essentially the same and requires the same level of precision in an
almanac table that specifies the location of the moon relative to the
stars.  Appulses are similar but there is more room for error - the star
will not &quot;turn off&quot; and provide a well-defined point in time.

Halley's method can only be as accurate as his lunar position knowledge.
No one published tables at that time (as Maskelyne did after 1767).
There was the raw data that was coming out of Flamsteed's observations
and other observers that may have been accumulating data.  Newton and
Halley published Flamsteed's data without his permission in 1712 but
what Halley used in the 1699 timeframe I don't know offhand.

Yes. An occultation happens when the Moon passes in front of a star, so it
appears to extinguish it. It's an instant event, so it can be timed very
precisely. Halley would use occultations in determining the orbit of the
Moon That required a known fixed location, such as from his home observatory
in Islington, a London suburb, or later from Greenwich..

An appulse is a near miss, when it comes close but doesn't cover the star.
You can use the line between the horns, and extend it, to give guidance to
the moment when the Moon has the same ecliptic longitude as the tabulated
value for that star. But that ignores certain correction factors, which
Halley may have been clever enough to allow for, but he never tells us about
that.

Yes and no. Even in modern almanacs, you will find such predictions, as well
as those for eclipses of Sun and Moon.  But it's a bit more complicated than
that. Because the Moon is so close, the timing of such occultations depends
significantly on where on Earth it is observed from (due to parallax).
