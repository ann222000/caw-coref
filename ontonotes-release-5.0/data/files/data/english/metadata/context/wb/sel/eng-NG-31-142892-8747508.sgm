In the Bible he is Lucifer, Beelzebub, Satan.  Others believe that
there is no Satan only evil Gods and Goddesses.  What constitutes a
good God?

Is death a good thing or bad thing?
If a hurricane smashes a city, is that good or bad- Most insurance
companies classify this as an act of God.
What about sex?  Humans like sex, right?  That makes it good, right?

The problem with Gods and Goddesses is simple.  They do not know what
is good and what is evil.  What is evil to one person, is good to
another.  Wars, natural disasters, disease, starvation, genocide are
just a few human population controls.  Is it good to control human's
population or is it bad?

You are now responsible for climate changes that will cause the
extinction of many animals.  Polar bears, coral reefs, penguins, harp
seals, arctic fox- kiss them goodbye in a few years.  Who is their
advocate?

One noted idea is &quot;to be fruitful and multiply&quot;  well, that has been
achieved up to the point where the earth is covered with people.

If Christians want to change God's rules and let homosexuals in their
churches then why not change the be fruitful and multiply into be wise
and conservative.  The earth can only support so many and Heaven can
only support so many.  And, you are now destroying Purgatory.  Do you
know where your souls go when Purgatory exists no longer?  I do.

Lucifer in Isaiah refers to a fallen Babylonian king, whose name, BTW, was
not &quot;Lucifer&quot; but who had a kingly title &quot;Son of the Morning&quot;.  The
&quot;Lucifer&quot; name got tacked on by Christian translators working in Latin.
&quot;Lucifer&quot; means &quot;Light-bearer&quot; in Latin.  It don't mean shit in Hebrew.

Beelzebub was mocking distortion of the name of a god of several Philistine
cities, Baal.  In Canaanite, &quot;Baal-Zebul&quot; meant &quot;Prince Baal&quot;.  In Hebrew,
&quot;Baal Zevuv&quot; meant &quot;Lord of Flies&quot;.  Haw, haw.  Good one.

The biblical term &quot;satan&quot; is a title, not the name of a person.  The title
gets applied to any number of individuals in the bible, even old Yahweh
himself (Numbers 22).  The word itself means &quot;adversary&quot; or &quot;accuser&quot;.

So, as you might now see, the reason for all those names is that they refer
to a lot of different individuals.  It's only naive and largely uneducated
Christians who lump them all together as the same guy.

Wiccans don't care about the Bible. But some of us do care about the
history of names.

Lucifer means light bringer and is related to an Italian god who
remained long after the Roman pantheon was banished by the Christian
god.

Beelzebub is a combination of the word Beel which means Lord and
Master and zebub which means lies. This refers to the god that the
Hebrew god competed with.

Satan comes from the Aramaic and means opposer. Some believed this
being was an angel of god working as his prosecutor.

The death of a cell is a good thing. It allows healthy cells to occupy
its place. Now apply that to human beings. But try to stay alive as
long as you can. That is also the job of the cell.

When people die, that is a bad thing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That depends. If you have sex with a lot of people then nature may
select you for a disease. There are some sexually transmitted diseases
that will kill you. This discourages having sex with many people.
Nature will also punish your children if you have sex with your
relatives. Homosexuality may be nature's way of convincing you not to
breed.

You do not know the gods so you can no presume they don't know what is
good or bad. Look for the word nature above. You will find that the

Try &quot;Genesis of the Grail Kings&quot; by Laurence Gardner. In my opinion this

It WAS made up.  And by three entirely different entities.  The Old
Testament was a (rather brilliantly) made up tribal history.  Carbon
dating of pottery shows that the Hebrews never were enslaved nor
transported to Egypt and then freed from bondage much later.  It's a
great story but it's strictly a story.  They never got much further than
the hills they were always in around Palestine.   The New Testament was
made up by one group of people using two distinct sources.  The first
was a delayed aftershock reaction in the Second Century to the
destruction of the Temple in 70 A.D.  The same chaos and soul searching
in the wake of the near complete destruction of Judaism that gave rise
to the modern Rabbinical system also gave rise to the early Christians.
In reaching back to create a plausible (!) and meaningful past, those
early Christians picked up the work of Saul (later Paul), a Roman tent
maker and citizen who was a Jew by birth and who much earlier had tried
to make up a religion based on &quot;Christ&quot; the messiah that could be used
to unite Jews and Romans (really!).  It didn't go anywhere when he wrote
it but a couple of hundred years later it got folded into the emerging
Christian religion.   It's like someone digging up a copy of &quot;The Truman
Show&quot; two hundred years from now, assuming it's a documentary, and using
it to write a history of what the 20th century was like while starting a
religion based on the worship of Jim Carey.  It sounds silly but that's
what we've had for the better part of two millennia for &quot;the most
important book ever written.&quot;

Nevermore  (personally I would have started with Lord of the Rings)

I couldn't name you any single volume that would address all the tidbits you

&gt;&gt;&gt; In Hebrew, &quot;Baal Zevuv&quot; meant &quot;Lord of Flies&quot;.  Haw, haw.  Good one.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;accuser&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So, as you might now see, the reason for all those names is that they
&gt;&gt;&gt; refer to a lot of different individuals.  It's only naive and largely
&gt;&gt;&gt; uneducated Christians who lump them all together as the same guy.
&gt;&gt; That's interesting. Can you recommend a good book introducing bible
&gt;&gt; studies or that presents similar interesting tidbits? I've got a new
&gt;&gt; international version of it which has been shown to be inadequate on a few
&gt;&gt; occasions now, but I am not bothered enough to begin studying the
&gt;&gt; original.

&gt; I couldn't name you any single volume that would address all the tidbits you
&gt; might find interesting.  However, for a good overview of historical and
&gt; biographical contexts for the bible, Asimov's two-volume Guide to the Bible
&gt; is one I'd recommend.

Thanks. That might explain why a Christian friend has lent me the

&gt;&gt;&gt; the  original.

&gt;&gt; how do you know the Bible isnt just made up? Why base your life around
&gt;&gt; the  uncertanty that maybe the Bible was made up?

&gt; It WAS made up.  And by three entirely different entities.  The Old
&gt; Testament was a (rather brilliantly) made up tribal history.  Carbon
&gt; dating of pottery shows that the Hebrews never were enslaved nor
&gt; transported to Egypt and then freed from bondage much later.  It's a
&gt; great story but it's strictly a story.  They never got much further than
&gt; the hills they were always in around Palestine.   The New Testament was
&gt; made up by one group of people using two distinct sources.  The first
&gt; was a delayed aftershock reaction in the Second Century to the
&gt; destruction of the Temple in 70 A.D.  The same chaos and soul searching
&gt; in the wake of the near complete destruction of Judaism that gave rise
&gt; to the modern Rabbinical system also gave rise to the early Christians.
&gt; In reaching back to create a plausible (!) and meaningful past, those
&gt; early Christians picked up the work of Saul (later Paul), a Roman tent
&gt; maker and citizen who was a Jew by birth and who much earlier had tried
&gt; to make up a religion based on &quot;Christ&quot; the messiah that could be used
&gt; to unite Jews and Romans (really!).  It didn't go anywhere when he wrote
&gt; it but a couple of hundred years later it got folded into the emerging
&gt; Christian religion.   It's like someone digging up a copy of &quot;The Truman
&gt; Show&quot; two hundred years from now, assuming it's a documentary, and using
&gt; it to write a history of what the 20th century was like while starting a
&gt; religion based on the worship of Jim Carey.  It sounds silly but that's
&gt; what we've had for the better part of two millennia for &quot;the most
&gt; important book ever written.&quot;

&gt; Nevermore  (personally I would have started with Lord of the Rings)
">

Well based on the lack of evidence to support any of the events of the bible
or torah I'm going to have to lean towards your line of thinking.
I always wondered who really wrote the new testament. I find your
explination logical. modern Judisim came out of the destruction of the
temple, why couldnt christianity?

It's one thing to say that we should just live life and not worry
needlessly, and another to actually do it.

As for hell, demons, and satan, I don't believe in that cobblers. Tom
has just stated above that the word satan is used as a title in the
bible. It's just like those who confuse Dr. Frankenstein with his creation.

I get the impression that in the bible becoming a Christian is something
that is earned, not just a label that you can slap on yourself after
sincerely announcing that you'll &quot;love God from your heart&quot; and &quot;anoint
yourself with oils&quot;, like many professed Christians believe.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Bible he is Lucifer, Beelzebub, Satan.

&gt;&gt; Lucifer in Isaiah refers to a fallen Babylonian king, whose name, BTW,
&gt;&gt; was not &quot;Lucifer&quot; but who had a kingly title &quot;Son of the Morning&quot;.
&gt;&gt; The &quot;Lucifer&quot; name got tacked on by Christian translators working in
&gt;&gt; Latin. &quot;Lucifer&quot; means &quot;Light-bearer&quot; in Latin.  It don't mean shit in
&gt;&gt; Hebrew.

&gt;&gt; Beelzebub was mocking distortion of the name of a god of several
&gt;&gt; Philistine cities, Baal.  In Canaanite, &quot;Baal-Zebul&quot; meant &quot;Prince
&gt;&gt; Baal&quot;.  In Hebrew, &quot;Baal Zevuv&quot; meant &quot;Lord of Flies&quot;.  Haw, haw.
&gt;&gt; Good one.

&gt;&gt; The biblical term &quot;satan&quot; is a title, not the name of a person.  The
&gt;&gt; title gets applied to any number of individuals in the bible, even old
&gt;&gt; Yahweh himself (Numbers 22).  The word itself means &quot;adversary&quot; or
&gt;&gt; &quot;accuser&quot;.

&gt;&gt; So, as you might now see, the reason for all those names is that they
&gt;&gt; refer to a lot of different individuals.  It's only naive and largely
&gt;&gt; uneducated Christians who lump them all together as the same guy.

&gt; That's interesting. Can you recommend a good book introducing bible
&gt; studies or that presents similar interesting tidbits? I've got a new
&gt; international version of it which has been shown to be inadequate on a
&gt; few occasions now, but I am not bothered enough to begin studying the
&gt; original.

I would recommend &quot;Independent Bible Study&quot; by Irving Jenson.

As for Bibles, AMG Publishers produce the best. However, they only
have the NIV in the &quot;key word&quot; study version for now, with the editor's
choice of which words are flagged by Strong's numbers so you can see the
word from the original language. I had a copy of the &quot;key word&quot; study
KJV Bible, but I needed, and purchased, the &quot;complete word&quot; study KJV
New Testament, where *all* the words are flagged with Strong's numbers.
I had kept my &quot;key word&quot; genuine leather copy in the box on the shelf;
until I ran across (heh) an acquaintance who wanted to study the Bible,
but felt overwhelmed because he wanted Hebrew and Greek dictionaries as
well. So *BAM*!!! I gave him my &quot;key word&quot; KJV copy with those
dictionaries already included, still in mint condition, complete with a
box and personalized label. Boy, was he *never* expecting that! Heh.

Today I like to use Bible software that have original language
dictionaries. I use AMG's Bible Essentials, and SwordSearcher.

Contrariness is the nature of satan.  Hence the meaning of the term satan,
which is &quot;adversary&quot;.  Any real satanist is opposed to everything.  So, a
real satanist is opposed to both religion and the trashing of religion.  Not
to mention that a real satanist would also oppose the notion that a real
satanist is opposed to both religion and the trashing of religion. It is
unsatanic to agree with anything.

however, the fact that the mainstream Essenes rejected various
(all?) Old Testament books as man-made should give us pause in
accepting everything as divinely inspired merely because it claims
to be... at the minimum the issue should be investigated.

if Jesus was an Essene, then it follows that there is probably
more value in Gnostic writings which make up the Essene literary
arsenal, than in corrupted romanized volumes which were put
together with a political agenda in mind, and not out of a sincere
desire to find spiritual Truth...

For those of you who might like a taste of Laurence Gardner's moonbat
theories;

&quot;In Genesis of the Grail Kings, Gardner claims evidence that the royal
bloodline descends ultimately from the Biblical Cain, whose sons were
of extraterrestrial persuasion. Gardner spoke about them in a speech:

&quot;They were the true Sons of the Gods, who were fed firstly on Anunnaki
Star Fire from about 3800 BC and, subsequently, on 'high-spin' metal
supplements from about 2000 BC. In short, they were bred to be leaders
of humankind, and they were both mentally and physically maintained in
the 'highward' state: the ultimate dimension of the missing 44 per
cent -- the dimension of the Orbit of Light, or the Plane of Sharon.&quot;

Convincing stuff.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Bible he is Lucifer, Beelzebub, Satan.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lucifer in Isaiah refers to a fallen Babylonian king, whose name, BTW, was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not &quot;Lucifer&quot; but who had a kingly title &quot;Son of the Morning&quot;.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Lucifer&quot; name got tacked on by Christian translators working in Latin.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Lucifer&quot; means &quot;Light-bearer&quot; in Latin.  It don't mean shit in Hebrew.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beelzebub was mocking distortion of the name of a god of several Philistine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cities, Baal.  In Canaanite, &quot;Baal-Zebul&quot; meant &quot;Prince Baal&quot;.  In Hebrew,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Baal Zevuv&quot; meant &quot;Lord of Flies&quot;.  Haw, haw.  Good one.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The biblical term &quot;satan&quot; is a title, not the name of a person.  The title
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gets applied to any number of individuals in the bible, even old Yahweh
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; himself (Numbers 22).  The word itself means &quot;adversary&quot; or &quot;accuser&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, as you might now see, the reason for all those names is that they refer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to a lot of different individuals.  It's only naive and largely uneducated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Christians who lump them all together as the same guy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Every known religion is defined by preceding and contemporous
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; religions.   These other religions are either syncretized (Ex: Osiris
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cults absorbing Horus), one-upped(Ex: Amon-Ra being credited as being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the hidden prime mover behind all of the gods), or reviled (Osirian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cults rebuking Setekh).
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, a religion can pretty much just ignore another.  Or the
&gt;&gt;&gt; religions can just get along without need for encroaching on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; other, which is more common when there isn't someone trying to set
&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves up as the prime authority for religion.
&gt;&gt; You are seriously hung up on a need to trash people. Somehow, as you
&gt;&gt; type of &quot;religion&quot; you are not actually typing *about* religion per se,
&gt;&gt; but just the people involved, most of whom you delight in trashing.
&gt;&gt; I hope you know that is quite amusing, I hope you are attempting to be
&gt;&gt; amusing 'cause you're pretty good at it.

&gt; You are hung up on me and your recent thrashing.

&gt;&gt; something is wrong with you...

&gt; Yes, and I thank him for voting against Bush. But face it, most people
&gt; want him to be President so that he will legalize pot. Who cares. Just
&gt; move to New Mexico where pot is legal if that is what they want.

Considering how unpopular the war in Iraq is I would have thought most
people would want to vote for him because he says he will withdraw all
American troops.
Thats why I support him.

Mainstream fucking Essenes? They were outcasts living in the desert,

But yeah, the only things in the Old Testament that were written by
God were the ten commandments, and Mene, mene, tekel, pursin. And
we've only got Moses' say-so on the first ten. The last thing was
