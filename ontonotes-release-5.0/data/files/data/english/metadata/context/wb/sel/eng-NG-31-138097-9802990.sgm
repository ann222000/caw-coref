COVER STORY

All-out war

B. MURALIDHAR REDDY
in Colombo

It is a fight to the finish in Sri Lanka, and a bloodbath is inevitable before the government can possibly vanquish the LTTE.

SRIYANTHA WALPOLA

On the brink of war in 2006. An undeclared war in 2007. And now an all-out war. Sri Lanka's plunge into disaster became complete in 2008.

The New Year dawned with the assassination of United National Party (UNP) Member of Parliament T. Maheshwaran in broad daylight inside a temple in Colombo,
the capital. The next day, an explosion in the heart of the city, targeting a military vehicle, killed four people, including a soldier.

The Mahinda Rajapaksa government blamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for both the incidents and lobbed a political grenade by pulling out
of the Norwegian-brokered 2002 Cease Fire Agreement (CFA) with the Tigers. For all practical purposes, the CFA was a dead article, observed more in the
breach than in practice by both parties, particularly since the escalation of hostilities in mid-2006. Yet, the government's decision to remove the fig
leaf triggered strong disapproval from the international community.

The expressions of concern within and outside the island nation over the repercussions of a declared war were expected, given the trail of death, destruction
and displacement of people left by the undeclared war in the last 18 months. The country had slipped into such chaos that the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission
(SLMM), an offshoot of the CFA, decided in April 2007 to suspend rulings on ceasefire violation. By last count, in April 2007, the CFA had been violated
nearly 4,000 times. The SLMM was simply not equipped to keep a count of the numerous instances. After all, it was a mission meant to monitor a ceasefire
and not its violation.

However, the decision of the government to announce a unilateral withdrawal from the CFA has nothing to do with these violations. It is based on the assessment
that the Tigers have been cornered like never before. In the words of Army chief Sarath Fonseka, the &quot;end&quot; of the LTTE is certain by June 2008. Of course,
the Sri Lanka military has made spectacular gains in recent months against the Tigers. But Sri Lanka-watchers are sceptical of the assertions made by the
military leadership, given the three-decade-old bloody history of the island nation.

The Tigers are not expected to crumble without causing maximum possible bloodshed. For all the losses it has suffered, the LTTE continues to have the capability
to wage a conventional war in the north, fight unconventional battles in the east, and carry out hit-and-run and suicide missions in the south. In other
words, a bloodbath is inevitable before the Sri Lanka military can possibly barge into LTTE-held territory in Kilinochchi and Mullaithivu districts. The
failure of the government so far to come out with a credible political package to address the legitimate grievances of the minorities makes the task of
isolating (or Colombo's ambitious goal of annihilating) the Tigers tougher.

A glimpse of what could follow in the coming days and weeks was available on January 8. The Nation Building Minister, D.M. Dissanayake, became the target
of a roadside blast triggered by suspected LTTE cadre 18 km from Colombo. Panic and gloom have gripped the citizens of Colombo. The feeling of the average
person in the street is that war has arrived at their doorstep.

Apparently, the Rajapaksa government resolved to put a formal end to a moribund CFA after taking into consideration all the relevant factors. Foreign Minister
Rohitha Bogollagama, who shared the news with the diplomatic corps and the media, was at pains to emphasise that the government was fully conscious of
the dangers ahead in the post-CFA era and was capable of tackling the challenges it held.

blame game

LTTE HANDOUT/AFP

The decision of the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa (above) to announce a unilateral withdrawal from the ceasefire agreement is based on the assessment
that the LTTE has been cornered like never before. The Tigers, led by V. Prabakaran, however, have the capability to fight a war.

Unfortunately, the Minister and the government could not avoid the temptation of a blame game with the Ranil Wickremesinghe government, which they accused
of compromising the vital interests of the country by forging a flawed CFA. &quot;It was entered into without proper consultation by the government of the day,
with even the Cabinet of Ministers not being privy to its contents. Legitimate concerns of the security forces had not even been taken into account. It
had the effect of alienating the democratic Tamil political forces and focussed solely on the LTTE,&quot; the Minister argued.

Bogollagama was being economical with truth, to say the least. Rajapaksa was elected to the office of President in November 2005 on the plank of abrogation
of the CFA but chose to continue with it for the next two years and two months. For all its shortcomings, the CFA was seen by several sections within Sri
Lanka and the entire international community as giving some relief to the beleaguered citizens of Sri Lanka even if it failed to change the stripes of
the Tigers.

The Foreign Minister claimed the termination of the CFA did not in anyway hamper the process of a negotiated political settlement and Norway would continue
to play the role of a peace negotiator. The assertions of Bogollagama, however, do not tally with the attitude of the Rajapaksa regime towards Norway.
Replacement of Norway as the peace negotiator was the other main election pledge of Rajapaksa. Norway has had an uneasy relationship with the Rajapaksa
government in the past two years as it was suspected of being soft towards the LTTE. It is certainly not a coincidence that the representative of the Government
of Japan, Yasushi Akashi, was due to visit Sri Lanka from January 13 to 15 &quot;to discuss with the government the current situation of the peace process and
its future&quot;. Though it has not made it explicit, Japan is ready to take over the role of Norway but does not have the same support that Norway had from
the international community.

Predictably, the architect of the CFA, the UNP led by former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, was livid with the government for the abrogation of the
CFA and the finger-pointing. It issued a detailed and hard-hitting statement refuting the contentions of the Rajapaksa regime. The party pointed out that
it had entered into a memorandum of understanding with the ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in October 2006 to cooperate on a negotiated political
settlement referred to in the CFA. It further said that the CFA had been upheld by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka.

According to the UNP, the abrogation of the CFA was a politically expedient decision taken at the behest of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) in return for their support to the government in Parliament. Withdrawal from the CFA was the main demand of the JVP on the eve
of the crucial third reading of the budget in Parliament in December if the government wanted its MPs' votes in favour of the budget. The JVP, which voted
against the budget at the stage of the second reading, abstained from voting at the final stage and enabled the Rajapaksa regime to win the budget vote
by a big margin.

GEMUNU AMARASINGHE/AP

At Kabithigollewa hospital on December 6, 2007, bodies of bus passengers killed by a roadside bomb explosion kept for identification.

&quot;The UNP government entered into the ceasefire agreement with the LTTE in 2002 at a critical time when we had suffered severe military setbacks and the
economy was in a shambles. The LTTE had captured key military bases in the north and attacked vital economic targets such as the Katunayake airport. The
Colombo port was not operational and the economy had recorded a negative growth. Under these circumstances, the main objective of the ceasefire was to
find a negotiated settlement to the ongoing conflict and to safeguard the territorial integrity of the country,&quot; the UNP said.

Concurring with the UNP's view, the Foreign Ministers of the Nordic countries noted in a statement: &quot;The Cease Fire Agreement had a number of positive consequences.
During the first three years, conflict-related casualties dropped to almost zero, which means that as many as 10,000 lives may have been spared. The agreement
allowed for greater freedom of movement for all people in Sri Lanka, and opened for economic development. It also improved the human rights situation and
the protection of civilians. However, violations of the agreement have been particularly numerous and increasingly serious during the past two years.&quot;

The LTTE chose to wait for a whole week before formally responding to the government's decision to terminate the CFA. In a lengthy statement, essentially
for the consumption of the international community, the LTTE said even now it wanted 100 per cent implementation of the CFA and continuation of Norway
as the official facilitator of peace talks. &quot;We are shocked and disappointed that the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) has unilaterally abrogated the Cease
Fire Agreement (CFA).... The GoSL was forced to sign the CFA in 2002 after the LTTE brought about a military balance of power through a series of large-scale
military victories,&quot; it said.

The statement maintained that the LTTE was &quot;forced to temporarily withdraw&quot; from the peace talks in April 2003 as a result of the failure of the government
to implement the CFA 100 per cent. There was no explanation as to how the temporary withdrawal in early 2003 remained temporary for the next four years
and on what basis the LTTE is seeking continuation of the CFA.

&quot;History is replete with examples of the GoSL abrogation of pacts that were made to bring permanent peace for the Tamil people. The abrogation by the GoSL
of the unprecedented nearly six-year-long CFA has clearly demonstrated that the GoSL will never permit the Tamil people to live with freedom in their homeland,&quot;
it said. &quot;Therefore, the international community must understand this, and immediately remove the bans it has placed on the LTTE believing the false propaganda
of the GoSL, accept the just aspirations of the Tamil people, and recognise the right of the Tamil people to live with self-determination in their homeland,&quot;
the Tigers pleaded.

With the government forces and the Tigers hell-bent on a &quot;fight to finish&quot;, there is no prospect of peace in the immediate future.

American action

On January 10, the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) posted a report on its official website (htpp://
www.fbi.gov/
) under the title &quot;Taming the Tigers - From here in the U.S.&quot; What caught global attention was the agency's description of the LTTE as one of the &quot;most
dangerous and deadly extremists in the world&quot;, which has inspired worldwide networks, including Al Qaeda in Iraq, and the U.S. government's determination
&quot;to stop them, using the full range of our investigative and intelligence capabilities&quot;.

The introduction reads:

&quot;As terrorist groups go, it has quite a resume: Perfected the use of suicide bombers; Invented the suicide belt; Pioneered the use of women in suicide attacks;
Murdered some 4,000 people in the past two years alone; and Assassinated two world leaders - the only terrorist organisation to do so.

&quot;No, it's not Al Qaeda or Hezbollah or even HAMAS. The group is called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) or the Tamil Tigers for short. Needless
to say, the Tamil Tigers are among the most dangerous and deadly extremists in the world. For more than three decades, the group has launched a campaign
of violence and bloodshed in Sri Lanka, the island republic off the southern coast of India.&quot;

Under the sub-head &quot;Its ultimate goal&quot;, the FBI says the Tigers want to seize control of the country from the Sinhalese ethnic majority and create an independent
Tamil state. &quot;Along the way, it has launched suicide attacks, assassinated politicians (including a government Minister this week and even the Sri Lankan
President), taken hostages, and committed all of kinds of crimes to finance its operations. The resulting civil war has taken the lives of nearly 70,000
Sri Lankans on both sides of the conflict since 1983 alone,&quot; it says.

Posing a question, &quot;Why should you care?&quot;, the report goes on to say that it is because of the &quot;suffering and bloodshed&quot; that the Tamil Tigers have caused.
&quot;And because its ruthless tactics have inspired terrorist networks worldwide, including Al Qaeda in Iraq. But also because the group has placed operatives
right here in our own backyard, discreetly raising money to fund its bloody terrorist campaign overseas, including purchases of weapons and explosives.&quot;

It adds that the U.S. government has designated the Tigers a foreign terrorist organisation and is determined to stop them, using the full range of its
investigative and intelligence capabilities. In April, the report says, the U.S. government struck an important blow when its Joint Terrorism Task Force
in New York arrested the alleged U.S. director of the Tigers. The man supposedly had held several fundraising events at a church and various public schools
in Queens and in northern New Jersey in 2004. He is accused of arranging high-level meetings between the group's leaders and U.S. supporters.

&quot;We've also arrested another 11 Tamil Tiger-related suspects in the New York City region. And in Baltimore, following a multi-agency investigation, a pair
of Indonesian men pleaded guilty and were sentenced recently for working with others to export surface to air missiles, state-of-the-art firearms, machine
guns, and night vision goggles to the Tigers in Sri Lanka,&quot; it says.

The dispossessed

B. MURALIDHAR REDDY

According to a U.N. report, the majority of a million people displaced in hostilities and natural disasters since 1990 languish in transit camps.

GEMUNU AMARASINGHE/AP

Newly arrived internally displaced Tamils preparing themselves to be registered at a camp in Kiran, on January 21, 2007. According to the U.N., 220,000
people have fled their homes between April 2006 and March 2007.

On January 1, the United Nations released a report on the eight-day field visit of the Representative of the Secretary-General on the Human Rights of Internally
Displaced Persons (IDPs), Walter Kalin, to Sri Lanka from December 14 to 21. The report on the plight of the displaced due to the strife in the island
nation and the devastating tsunami of December 26, 2004, makes Chilling reading.

According to U.N. estimates, over a million people have been displaced in Sri Lanka in different phases of hostilities and owing to natural disasters since

1990. The majority of them are still languishing in transit camps with little prospect of returning to their homes. As the Kalin report notes, in the Eastern
Province alone the majority of the 220,000-odd persons who fled their homes between April 2006 and March 2007 continue to be in transitional shelters.

Despite spending eight days in the island nation, the U.N. representative could not visit areas under the control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) in the north. The representative regretted that he was unable to visit Kilinochchi to discuss humanitarian and protection concerns with the LTTE.
He stressed the primary responsibility of the Government of Sri Lanka in protecting and assisting the IDPs, a responsibility that includes facilitating
the conditions that enable durable solutions for the displaced.

The report notes the complexity of the problem of internal displacement in Sri Lanka. It says: &quot;In addition to recent conflict-induced displacement of the
past 24 months, in Puttalam for example, northern Muslims have remained in displacement for 17 years. Situations of protracted displacement also exist
in Vavuniya and Jaffna, and smaller numbers of tsunami IDPs remain in the Eastern Province. In addition, fresh displacement is occurring in Mannar and
other parts of the north.&quot;

The report also notes that the predominant concern among the IDPs is physical security. It says: &quot;The representative was struck by a pervasive sense of
fear and uncertainty among those he spoke to. Sources of insecurity are varied, but include the following: continued incursions and attacks by the LTTE;
disappearances, abductions and looting; threats and attacks upon individuals by irregular and armed groups such as the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Puligal,
including infiltration of camps at night; incomplete or delayed mine-clearance; approaches used by security forces in response to security incidents, including
round-ups, methods to identify suspects, and detention of individuals without proper notification to family members of the reasons for and location of
the individual's detention; challenges of civilian police to respond adequately and in a timely manner to security incidents and threats against IDPs and
limitations on IDPs' and returnees' freedom of movement based on screening and documentation of their place of origin.&quot;

Acknowledging legitimate security concerns and the responsibility of the state to address these concerns, the representative observes that whole communities
felt they were under suspicion and at risk, often owing to identification of their places of origin as being in formerly LTTE-controlled areas. &quot;At times
there is a tension between the security imperative and the humanitarian imperative, and the key is in finding the optimal balance which allows people to
live in both dignity and safety,&quot; he observes.

Kalin says he found that significant restrictions remained and he encourages authorities to continue their efforts to restore full access to livelihoods.
Some restrictions are imposed by the authorities, such as limitations on access to fields or fishing grounds. Others are related to insecurity, such as
the risk of attack in or abduction from paddyfields and harassment at checkpoints.

He also notes that targeted programmes to enhance livelihood opportunities, such as the provision of seeds and tools, are not consistently coordinated at
the time of return of the IDPs. Nor are livelihood opportunities provided to IDPs remaining in camps in the east. Particularly precarious is the situation
of households headed by widows and other women.

Kalin feels that increased information sharing and consultation by the government with the IDPs themselves and with the international community and agencies
would substantially contribute to reducing the sense of insecurity and facilitate the IDPs' reintegration into the areas of return. For instance, complete
and timely communication on arrests and detention, as required by international human rights standards, can reduce the fear and helplessness among the
IDPs and returnees. Clear communication about options, entitlements and the process of return would allow the IDPs to make voluntary and informed choices.

At present, there is no information about housing and land in high-security zones and areas under the exclusive control of the security forces, as well
as compensation for their loss or limitation. Yet relevant information is essential to enable the IDPs to exercise control of their future. Increased transparency
- in the form of better communication and coordination among the government and international agencies and humanitarian non-governmental groups - would
significantly improve the timeliness and adequacy of the humanitarian response to displacement.

Concerned about the over-300,000 persons estimated to be living in internal displacement since the 1980s, the representative stresses that allowing the
displaced to lead normal lives, with decent housing and full access to livelihoods and services, on the one hand, and preservation of their right to opt
for eventual return and their property rights, on the other, are not mutually exclusive. He says many government officials recognise that finding durable
solutions for those in protracted situations, in particular the northern Muslims, must now be a priority for the government and the international community.

The report, however, does not make any reference to some of the knee-jerk responses of the government to the violence perpetrated by suspected cadre of
the LTTE. The manner in which the government evicted 250-odd persons from the north and the east staying in various lodges of Colombo in June, and arrested
2,500 Tamils in an unprecedented overnight swoop without any reason following a parcel bomb explosion in an apparel shop on the outskirts of Colombo on
November 28, best illustrates the vulnerability of an ordinary person from a minority community in the island nation.

Nor does the report take into account the 21 per cent inflation and the non-availability of essential commodities and medicines in the battle zones in the
east and the north. An estimated 600,000 citizens of Jaffna peninsula continue to be cut off from the rest of the world since the government shut down
A 9 highway, their only link to the rest of the island, in August 2006, citing security reasons. Prices of goods and services in Jaffna town, under the
control of the military, are 100 to 300 per cent higher than elsewhere. Things could only be expected to get worse with the north becoming the theatre
of war in 2008.

Political battles

B. MURALIDHAR REDDY

Will Rajapaksa demonstrate the leadership and statesmanship to carry everyone on board once he unveils the political package?

ANURUDDHA LOKUHAPUARACHCHI/REUTERS

Ranil wickremesinghe, united National Party leader and former Prime Minister.

Not a day has passed since September 2006 when the headline &quot;APRC proposals soon&quot; did not appear in one or the other section of the print or electronic
media in Sri Lanka. The APRC, or All Party Representative Committee, was constituted in mid-2006 by President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a bid to evolve a political
consensus on power-sharing between the majority and minority communities in the conflict-ridden island nation.

But as has been the bane of every peace initiative in Sri Lanka, these headlines started to sound hollow with every passing month. The headlines on January
10, saying that the APRC, on a directive from the President, has conceded to submit a set of proposals on January 23, simply draw a derisive comment or
a smirk. A number of factors have contributed to the scepticism among Lanka-watchers on the ability of the APRC to put on the table a credible package
to resolve the ethnic conflict. The blind rivalry between the two main political parties of the country is the chief reason for the erosion of the APRC's
credibility. Sri Lankan political parties just refuse to learn from history.

The unrest that surfaced among the minorities with the enactment of the controversial 1956 Sinhala Only Act grew into a full-fledged movement for a separate
Tamil state in the mid-1970s thanks to the failure of the two major parties - the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) -
to arrive at an understanding on addressing the genuine grievances of minority groups. Over the decades, the two parties have achieved the dubious distinction
of having constantly opposed later what they had proposed when in power.

It is the politics of one-upmanship practised by the UNP and the SLFP that gave birth to Tamil militancy. Indian intervention in 1987, following the Indo-Sri
Lanka Accord, to meet the legitimate aspirations of all minorities did succeed in bringing most of the militant groups except the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) into the democratic mainstream.

In ideal circumstances, the 13th Amendment to the 1978 Constitution, incorporating the provisions of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord on devolution of powers,
should have ushered in an era of peace in the strife-torn island. But that was not to be, largely because of the lack of political will on the part of
the J.R. Jayewardene government to translate the 13th Amendment into action and the obduracy of the LTTE.

The tunnel vision of political parties in the country was best exemplified when political and other groups of all hues came together for the first time
in the history of Sri Lanka in 1989-90 to oust the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). That, too, at a juncture when the IPKF had largely succeeded in cornering
the LTTE and New Delhi was doing its best to cajole Colombo to give the minorities their due. Exploiting the situation to the hilt, the Tigers grew in
strength militarily and politically; they captured the north-east and hounded out all other forces from these areas.

Post-Rajiv Gandhi assassination, India adopted a hands-off policy on Sri Lanka and the 13th Amendment was reduced to a piece of paper. In the 17 years since
the IPKF departed from the shores of Sri Lanka, there have been numerous efforts, by President Chandrika Kumaratunga and then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe,
to present a political package acceptable to all but in vain. The &quot;southern consensus&quot;, a phrase to connote understanding among the major political parties
on devolution of powers, has proved elusive.

The situation was back to square one when Rajapaksa took over the reins of power in November 2005. He won the presidential election with a narrow margin
against Wickremesinghe with the pledge to make a new beginning in seeking a political solution to the ethnic conflict. The APRC was born a few months later.
To underline his sincerity in his quest for a political solution, Rajapaksa further appointed a group of multi-ethnic experts to help him evolve a political
package acceptable to all sections.

In October 2006, Rajapaksa pulled off an incredible feat. Much to the delight of the island and the world, the SLFP and the UNP signed a memorandum of understanding
(MoU) to cooperate in all spheres of national interest. The pact, hailed as historic, brightened the chances of a possible resolution of the ethnic conflict
like never before.

But narrow political interests soon took their toll. The pact was torn to pieces by the UNP after the President chose to induct 19 UNP dissidents into the
government in January 2007. Incensed with the blatant poaching of MPs, the party also walked out of the APRC. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the
ultra-nationalist party, had left the APRC in October in protest against the report of the majority members of the multi-ethnic group.

In addition, in October 2006, the Sri Lanka Supreme Court, acting on a petition by the JVP, declared the merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, as
a follow-up to the Indo-Lanka Accord, null and void. The court pronounced the merger unconstitutional on the grounds that it was effected through a presidential
decree and not through the parliamentary route. The UNP announced its readiness to cooperate for a re-merger of the north and the east if the government
was to introduce the necessary Bill in Parliament. However, the Rajapaksa regime chose not to respond.

With the UNP and the JVP out of the APRC and the pro-LTTE Tamil National Alliance (TNA) not invited to be a part of it, the committee has been reduced to
a body of the ruling SLFP combine, its electoral partners and the rump group of the UNP. So it is a misnomer to refer to it as the APRC.

However, Prof. Tissa Vitharana, the committee's Chairman and a Minister, is hopeful of getting the recommendations of the APRC endorsed by the UNP. &quot;I have
already initiated discussions with the UNP leadership and I have been given to understand that the party would give its views after we present the proposals.
I have also appealed to the JVP to return to the committee though so far there has been no positive response,&quot; Prof. Vitharana, who has been struggling
to put together proposals acceptable to the broadest possible political spectrum, told Frontline.

After the government decided to withdraw from the Cease Fire Agreement (CFA), there is tremendous pressure on the Rajapaksa regime to announce a political
package. It was against this backdrop that the President summoned a meeting of &quot;party leaders&quot; along with Prof. Vitharana on the night of January 9. There
it was agreed that the APRC would submit its report to the President on January 23 and the government would make public its contents on January 25.

ZAINAL ABD HALIM/REUTERS

The tunnel vision of political parties in Sri Lanka was best exemplified when groups of all hues came together in 1989-90 to oust the Indian Peace Keeping
Force. Above, a 2003 picture of Parliament.

Prof. Vitharana said there was consensus within the APRC on most sections of the draft he had circulated among the members in January 2007. &quot;The draft itself
is based on proposals made by various parties and the reports given by the multi-ethnic experts group. There is agreement on most sections of the draft
I had circulated. Only two or three controversial issues need to be sorted out,&quot; he said.

Pending unveiling of a political package by the President, the committee is in favour of immediate setting up of the north and east Provincial Councils.
Favouring full implementation of the Amendment, the committee would recommend to the President to grant more powers to provinces to overcome any existing
deficiencies in the 13th Amendment after its approval by Parliament. The government would need a two-thirds majority to get the endorsement of Parliament
and this would be possible only if Rajapaksa succeeds in getting every important party, particularly the UNP, on board.

The Vitharana draft has been in public domain for over a year now and the crux of the report appeared in The Hindu in January 2007. It has proposed that
Sri Lanka remain a unitary state according Buddhism the primary place but go in for greater devolution of powers to provinces in a bid to end the prolonged
ethnic conflict. The following are some of the proposals in the report:

Sri Lanka shall be a unitary state &quot;in the sense ... it shall be deemed to be an undivided, integrated and inter-dependent state structure&quot; with power shared
between Colombo and the provinces and among the provinces.

The Sri Lankan state shall &quot;protect and foster the Buddha Sasana&quot; while respecting other religions. Sri Lanka shall adopt a parliamentary form of government,
with the executive powers exercised through the President who shall act on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.

The transfer of executive powers to Parliament shall take place at the end of the current term of office of President Rajapaksa. Until then, the President
shall be deemed an MP, responsible and answerable to Parliament.

All Sri Lankans eligible to vote can be registered as voters even if the war has displaced them within the country or forced them to go abroad. In line
with the suggestions made by a group of experts, a bicameral legislature shall be formed. This shall include a House of Representatives, to be elected
by the people, and a Senate, to be elected by the Provincial Assemblies. Each of the nine provinces shall elect eight Senators, making it a 72-member body.

There shall be a Vice-President who shall belong to a community other than the President's and he or she shall hold office for two years. The number of
Cabinet Ministers and Deputy Ministers shall not exceed 30 each. The Cabinet should reflect the pluralistic character of the country and be genuinely representative
of the provinces.

Every province in Sri Lanka can have its own flag and emblem. There shall be equitable representation for different ethnic groups in the public services
and suitable &quot;affirmative action&quot; so that Sri Lankan Tamils, Indian Tamils and Moors are suitably represented in these services. But such affirmative action
shall be for an interim period &quot;to restore the ethnic balance in the public services&quot;.

The APRC has drawn up detailed lists for the distribution of powers between the Central and the provincial administrations. There will be a National List,
whose subjects would be governed by Colombo, and a Provincial List, that would be the mandate of the provincial legislatures. Provincial legislatures can
impose taxes, levies, cess and duties other than income tax, value added tax, general sales tax and customs duties.

There would also be a National Police Service (NPS) and a Provincial Police Service (PPS), working in close coordination. Special units of the NPS made
up of members of all ethnic communities would be deployed in the provinces in emergencies.

The proposals have detailed safeguards against secession, going into minute details of how the Central government can react if it fears secession in any
province. The APRC has decided to leave to the larger peace talks, if and when they take place, the emotive Tamil demand for a merger of the Northern and
the Eastern provinces where Tamils dominate, though the East is home to a large number of Sinhalese and Muslims as well. The latter communities feel they
will lose out if the provinces become a single administrative unit since Tamils will then dominate.

An Indian Tamil Cultural and Development Council (ITCDC) is proposed to be set up to serve &quot;Indian Tamils&quot;, who primarily live in the tea-growing areas,
in education, culture, health and rural development. The APRC has suggested that local authorities such as Pradeshiya Sabhas and Municipal or Urban Councils
be recognised and granted more powers. In the demarcation of Pradeshiya Sabhas, due weight be given to geographical factors as well as minority community
interests, it says.

On the face of it, the proposals are good and should be acceptable to all moderates. But then, it is not because of a lack of proposals that the Sri Lankan
ethnic conflict has dragged on for decades. The key to a sound beginning towards a resolution of the ethnic strife lies in consensus among all major parties
and the political will of the leadership to implement agreed proposals. Will Rajapaksa demonstrate the political leadership and statesmanship to carry
everyone on board once he unveils the much-awaited political package?

Global isolation

D.B.S. JEYARAJ

Pressure from the international community weakens the LTTE, and the government in Colombo decides to seize the opportunity.

LAKRUWAN WANNIARACHCHI/AFP

Sri Lankan newspapers went to town on the E.U. ban on the Tigers in May 2006.

A SIGNIFICANT development in the new year in Sri Lanka was President Mahinda Rajapaksa's decision to abrogate unilaterally the Cease Fire Agreement (CFA)
entered into by the previous government, that of United National Party (UNP) Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Oslo-brokered CFA with the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was in force from February 23, 2002.

Chief among the reasons for Colombo's decision is the confidence that a decisive military victory over the LTTE is within sight. After decades of protracted
conflict, there has emerged a dominant line of thought that a concerted military effort can deprive the Tigers of territorial control in the northern mainland
known as Wanni.

It is a moot question as to whether there is a valid basis for this optimism, but the prevailing reality is that Colombo has scented blood. Therefore, it
wants to pursue the military option without having to worry about any fetters such as a ceasefire. In recent times the CFA had turned into a worthless
document as both sides were flagrantly flouting its provisions.

Even though there has been no de facto ceasefire for quite some time, the Sri Lankan government does not want the CFA to exist even on paper. Thus, two
weeks' notice was given to Norway on January 2, and from January 14 there will be neither a de jure nor a de facto ceasefire.

Among the reasons buoying up government hopes of a victory over the LTTE is the impression that the international community is firmly behind Colombo in
the war against the LTTE. With the backing of the international community, Colombo is sure that the LTTE can be greatly weakened even if not totally destroyed.

Apart from India and Malaysia, several Western nations, too, have proscribed the LTTE as a foreign terrorist organisation. The United States, Canada and
25 member-states (including the United Kingdom and France) of the European Union have all formally included the LTTE on their terrorist lists. Australia
has listed the LTTE in special legislation to check terrorist fund-raising. More importantly, these countries have, through a series of crackdowns, exerted
pressure on the LTTE's various overseas branches. Earlier, the grouse was that Western countries were not taking enough action against the Tigers amidst
the Tamil diaspora. LTTE operatives were, in the eyes of Colombo, having a field day garnering revenue and engaging in propaganda abroad.

It was opined that a worldwide clampdown on the LTTE would virtually de-fang and de-claw the Tigers in north-eastern Sri Lanka. Recent events have instilled
hope in the Sri Lankan government that meaningful action is being taken. Thus, Colombo wants to utilise the favourable international mood and step up its
own war against the LTTE.

The following is a brief rundown of the recent action taken against overseas LTTE operatives worldwide:

? In August 2007, U.S. security officials conducted a series of arrests and detained a dozen persons from Seattle, Washington, and the States of New York
and New Jersey. This was the result of a sting operation in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials posed as arms dealers.

The arrests related to alleged offences such as trying to purchase surface-to-air missiles and AK 47 rifles and also attempting to bribe U.S. officials
to get the LTTE de-proscribed. The U.S. designated the LTTE a foreign terrorist organisation in 1997. Some of those arrests were of Tamils with Canadian
citizenship. One person arrested in the U.S. was a British passport holder of Sri Lankan Tamil origin. Another was a Tamil hailing from Tamil Nadu.

Eleven defendants were indicted in the eastern district of New York on charges relating to providing material support to the LTTE. One indictment, United
States vs Sathajhan Sarachandran, et al., charges five individuals with attempting to purchase several dozen surface-to-air missiles and other military
arms and equipment from an undercover FBI agent in Queens, New York. The second indictment, United States vs Thavarajah Pratheepan et al., charges six
defendants with participating in a wide-ranging conspiracy to provide material support to the LTTE through the procurement of military arms and technology;
attempting to bribe purported U.S. State Department officials to remove the LTTE from the foreign terrorist organisation list and to sell classified intelligence
concerning the LTTE, fund-raising; and the LTTE's covert payment for a U.S. Congressman's trip to LTTE-controlled territory.

? In a separate sting operation, U.S. officials arrested six Asians for allegedly trying to smuggle weapons from the U.S. for the LTTE. Undercover agents
tracked the suspects from the eastern port of Baltimore to the U.S. South Pacific territory of Guam. Four of those arrested were Indonesians, one was a
Singaporean and the sixth was a Sri Lankan Tamil, Thirunavukkarasu Varatharajah. Varatharajah was charged with conspiracy, attempting to export arms, money
laundering and illegal possession of weapons. He has been sentenced to five years' imprisonment.

? In a more significant act, U.S. officials arrested Karunakaran Kandasamy aka Karuna, a New York resident, in April last year. It was alleged that Karuna
was the chief of the LTTE's U.S. operations. He is the director of the American branch of the LTTE, which is located in Queens, and operates through a
front organisation called the World Tamil Coordinating Committee. According to the U.S. indictment, Karuna oversees and directs the LTTE's activities in
the U.S., including fund-raising.

? The LTTE in France, too, is under strain. Fourteen Tamils of Sri Lankan origin, suspected of being linked to the LTTE, were placed in judicial custody
under a preventive detention order in France on April 5, 2006, after being produced at a special counter-terrorism tribunal in Paris.

They were arraigned on multiple charges including extorsion, violences physiques et sequestration contre des Tamouls installes en France (extortion, physical
violence and illegal confinement against Tamils settled in France). They were also charged with financing terrorism and with criminal association with
a terrorist enterprise. The LTTE was cited as the terrorist organisation in question.

Among those remanded was the LTTE branch chief in Paris, Nadaraja Matheenthiran alias Parithi alias Regan. Also arrested was the politics/propaganda chief
for Europe, Duraisamy Aravindhan alias Metha. While Parithi has a French passport, Metha holds an Italian one. As investigations continue, the two remain
under detention, having been denied bail.

? In Victoria, Australia, two persons were charged with providing material support and funding to the LTTE. Aaruran Vinayagamoorthy, 32, of Mount Waverley
(a suburb in Melbourne), and Sivarajah Yathavan, 36, of Vermont South (another suburb in the city), were produced in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on
May 1, 2006. They were each charged with intentionally being members of a terrorist organisation and providing support and making funds available to a
terrorist organisation. The offences are alleged to have occurred between July 6, 2002, and May 1, 2007. Subsequently, a third person, Arumugam Rajeevan,
42, was also charged.

The arrests followed security operations in Melbourne and Sydney, where a number of residences of Sri Lankan Tamils were searched. The men were initially
denied bail, but it was granted subsequently and the trial is going on. It was only recently that the acknowledged Tiger chief in Australia, Thillai Jeyakumar,
passed away. Had he been living, chances are that he too would have been arrested.

? On June 21, 2006, in the United Kingdom, Arunachalam Chrishanthakumar alias Shanthan and Goldan Lambert were arrested by the police in London and charged
with supporting the LTTE. They were produced before the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court on June 28.

Chrishanthakumar is charged with assisting in arranging a meeting in Hyde Park on July 25, 2006, to canvass support for the Tamil Tigers; speaking at the
Hyde Park event; receiving £1,500 in January 2005, intending that it be used, or having reasonable cause to suspect that it may be used, for the purposes
of terrorism; receiving manuals entitled Underwater Warfare Systems, Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Naval Weapons Systems, as well as possessing six trenching
spades, 39 compasses and a piece of ballistic body armour, which may have been received for the purposes of terrorism; and for being a member of the LTTE
between January 2005 and June 2007.

Lambert is charged with assisting in the management of the Hyde Park event even while knowing it was for supporting a proscribed organisation. Chrishanthakumar
is the head of the LTTE's British branch. Lambert was allegedly responsible for Tamil youth activities. The bank accounts of Chrishanthakumar and his wife
have been frozen. Lambert and Chrishanthakumar were released on bail but their trials continue.

A pattern is visible in the series of arrests of LTTE activists. Many of those arrested are the heads of LTTE branches in their respective countries. Some
are responsible for fund-raising, others are prominent youth activists. In what appears to be an orchestrated action, the LTTE is being penalised globally.

Reinforcing this impression has been the action taken against the Tamils Rehabilitation Organization (TRO), an alleged LTTE front organisation. The TRO
has long been suspected of being a &quot;conduit&quot; for channelling and laundering LTTE finances. The U.S., the U.K. and Denmark have frozen TRO bank accounts.
An intensive probe is under way.

The LTTE, through its actions, has incurred the wrath of the international community. The Tigers were given a &quot;golden&quot; opportunity when the West relaxed
its tough stance towards &quot;terrorism&quot; in the case of the LTTE and encouraged Colombo to negotiate.

SENA VIDANAGAMA/AFP

Christina Rocca, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Palaly airbase in Jaffna on March 15, 2002. Rocca visited
the war-ravaged Jaffna peninsula four days after the U.S. Embassy in Colombo warned the LTTE not to jeopardise the Norwegian-backed peace process.

The U.S., Japan, Norway and the E.U. became the four co-chairs of the Sri Lankan peace process. The West hardened its attitude towards so-called Islamist
terrorists and justified its stance on the basis that &quot;terrorism is terrorism&quot; and that there is no difference between &quot;good or bad terrorism&quot;. Yet a notable
exception was made in the case of the LTTE, with the international community promoting dialogue between Colombo and Kilinochchi as &quot;strategic partners&quot;.

But the LTTE, true to form, failed to utilise this opening. Overtly and covertly, the LTTE began going against the spirit and letter of the CFA. In monitored
ceasefire violations up to November 30, 2006, the LTTE outscored the Sri Lankan government nine to one (3,086 to 345).

The CFA became practically &quot;defunct&quot; as hostilities increased. The Nordic Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) found itself forced to &quot;monitor&quot; an undeclared
war rather than a declared ceasefire. Day-to-day monitoring was suspended and a scheme of weekly report submissions was introduced.

The international community was unhappy and regularly conveyed its displeasure to the LTTE through meetings at an official level. The LTTE ignored these
warnings, which were couched in diplomatic jargon, and continued on its self-destructive course. The LTTE also pulled out of all talks with Colombo despite
pleas by the international community that the Tigers &quot;stay the course&quot; at the negotiating table.

A powerful signal was conveyed by the E.U. when it suspended all LTTE travel to Europe. Still, there was no positive response from the LTTE. Finally, the

E.U. proscribed the LTTE as a terrorist movement. The LTTE response was to demand and obtain a withdrawal of the ceasefire monitors in the SLMM who were
from the E.U. - that is, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Thereafter, the SLMM was virtually crippled.

Slowly, yet steadily, the international community began turning against the LTTE. Incidents such as the assassination of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar,
the enforced boycott of the presidential election in Tamil areas, the commencement without any provocation of attacks against security forces, and the
closure of the sluice gates at Maavilaaru dam added to its displeasure.

Thus, the international community maintained a deafening silence when the Rajapaksa regime stepped up the war against the LTTE. Initially, the government
was wary of international reaction and rationalised its actions by describing them as &quot;defensive&quot;. Gradually, it shed such niceties and pursued the war
intensely and relentlessly.

The CFA demarcates certain areas as LTTE-controlled and government-controlled. Both sides were forbidden to make &quot;offensive&quot; incursions into each other's
territory. The government observed these restrictions in the breach as it took back LTTE territory in the east and Mannar South. Now, Colombo plans to
go into the heartland of Tiger territory in the north. Confident that the international community will not intervene, the government has dispensed with
even the CFA.

Negative responses

This has evoked negative responses from the international community. The United Nations, the E.U. and countries such as the U.S., France, Australia, Canada
and Japan have expressed dissatisfaction at what seems an all-out effort by the Sri Lankan state to pursue war. India has once again emphasised that there
can be no military solution. The question that arises is whether the Rajapaksa regime has misread the situation and irked the international community by
pursuing the military option. It must be remembered that the regime earlier intensified its military drive on the basis that military pressure had to be
exerted on the LTTE to make it come to the negotiating table. The international community was requested to exert pressure on the LTTE to compel the Tigers
to opt for a negotiated settlement.

Despite the flaws in implementation, the government's adherence to the CFA had given credence to the belief that its pursuit of war was only a device to
foster a negotiated peace. The unilateral decision to do away with the CFA has upset such a perception. The international community is caught in the unenviable
position of being charged with adopting double standards. If pressure had to be exerted on the LTTE for flouting the CFA, then should not Colombo be penalised
for abrogating it?

The international community is also miffed about Colombo not proceeding on a parallel track towards a political solution. Much is expected of the All Party
Representative Committee (APRC) that is yet to deliver a comprehensive power-sharing package based on a southern consensus. The government has not displayed
as much keenness on the political front as it has on the military front. Nevertheless, a sovereign nation is entitled to take whatever steps it thinks
necessary to counter terrorism or threats to its territorial integrity, and no nation can openly rap the Sri Lankan state for that. It can, however, be
given cautionary advice on how that &quot;war&quot; should be conducted.

Adequate arrangements for accommodating displaced persons, measures to reduce civilian suffering, scaling down of human rights violations, non-curtailment
of democratic practices, and so on are some issues that Colombo urgently needs to address if it wants the international community to give it unconditional
support. More importantly, the government needs to expedite matters on the political front and evolve a substantial power-sharing formula acceptable to
all sections of the people within the overall framework of a united Sri Lanka. Pursuing war against the LTTE without addressing the legitimate grievances
and aspirations of the country's minority communities will not endear the Sri Lankan government to the world at large.

Defaulting on these matters will not lead to the international community withdrawing support for Colombo and aiding Kilinochchi. Such options are ruled
out firmly as the &quot;LTTE option&quot; is no longer a credible choice from a global perspective. But the international community can indicate its displeasure
in other ways. Restrictions on arms supplies to Colombo is one. Another is the adoption of a &quot;go slow&quot; approach in cracking down on the LTTE abroad. If
the LTTE is let off the hook temporarily, the government is likely to be deprived of a major factor boosting its war against the LTTE.

Requiem for truce

SHARMINI SERASINGHE

However flawed, the Cease Fire Agreement of 2002 had benefits that were not visible to many.

BUDDHIKA WEERASINGHE/REUTERS

Nordic ceasefire officers outside the head office of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission in Colombo, on January 4. The ceasefire monitors began wrapping up
their six-year mission to Sri Lanka after the government scrapped the truce with the Tamil Tigers.

Sri Lanka is notorious for its failed peace talks and ceasefire agreements. There have been many since the Tamil national liberation struggle became militarised
in 1983. The first one was signed prior to the talks in Thimphu in 1985. Then came the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord in July 1987. Thereafter came the rather
carelessly worked out ceasefire agreement in February 1990, and yet another one in January 1995. The latest, the Cease Fire Agreement (CFA) of February
2002, is now unilaterally done away with to suit the &quot;convenience&quot; of the powers that are. The abrogation of the CFA will also automatically terminate
the functioning of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) tasked to monitor violations of the CFA by its signatories.

The CFA of February 2002 has been the most elaborately drawn up so far and lasted (however imperfectly) for the longest period of time - almost six years.
During this period of ceasefire there were six rounds of talks between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). There
were also four sub-committees set up (of varying life-spans) on military, economic, political and gender issues.

There are many people in Sri Lanka who regard the CFA, born to the incompatible parentage of the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka and &quot;mid-wifed&quot; by
the peace facilitator, Norway, as much-maligned, abused, and totally retarded. Some political parties see it as the most damaging of all ceasefire agreements
foisted upon the country.

In the nearly six years of its existence, the CFA has gone through varying operating political climates. The period between February 2002 and December 2003
was its most productive - six rounds of talks, four sub-committees, and a much-reduced level of violence under a United National Front (UNF) government.
April 2004 to November 2005 was a period of the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) government under President Chandrika Kumaratunga. While the signing
of P-TOMS (Post-Tsunami Operational Management Structure) after the tsunami in December 2004 was a substantive achievement, on the peace front the results
were minimal.

Post-November 2005 presidential election saw a sharp escalation in violence, with both signatories to the CFA violating it at will. Some of the more extremist
coalition partners of the ruling government started demanding the abrogation of the CFA and the dismissal of the Norwegian facilitator.

The CFA, which was intended to be a platform for &quot;a negotiated political solution to the ongoing ethnic conflict&quot;, did not achieve its goal, but seemed
to have suited the LTTE objectives to a tee. The government at the time was caught between the devil and the deep blue sea with the country having suffered
enormous military setbacks and the economy being in the doldrums.

The CFA was seen by many as the last straw for an ever elusive negotiated settlement to the ongoing conflict. However flawed, it had benefits that were
not visible to many. The euphoria was short-lived and the rest is history.

With the signing of the CFA, there was a need to &quot;institutionalise&quot; the peace process, and, therefore, the Secretariat for Coordinating the Peace Process
(SCOPP) was established on February 6, 2002, with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Government of Sri Lanka.

As an &quot;insider&quot; in the form of the Director, Communications, of SCOPP, which came directly under the purview of the Executive President of Sri Lanka, I
gained my share of insights, between July 2004 and December 2006, into how a peace process is coordinated in Sri Lanka.

Many were the frustrations and drawbacks we had to live with in trying to tame the incorrigible LTTE, which violated the spirit of the CFA with impunity,
while all we could do was change the adverbs in the &quot;condemnation template&quot;, that is, &quot;The Government condemns/ strongly condemns/unreservedly condemns/vehemently
condemns/condemns in the strongest possible terms the killing of.&quot; and dish out media releases which the LTTE could not care two hoots for.

There were many out there among the general public who regarded SCOPP as some sort of an institution mandated to mollycoddle the LTTE. One can hardly blame
them given the fact that we were most of the time bending over backwards while trying not to appear to be doing so, to appease the cold-blooded LTTE.

The Operations Division of SCOPP, manned by the three armed forces and the police, was tasked with coordinating the &quot;safe passage of LTTE cadre&quot; be it on
land, sea or air, while their own men out there were being brutally gunned down by the LTTE. In keeping with the true spirit of the CFA, which was sine
qua non to the peace process, they ensured &quot;safe&quot; transportation of LTTE terrorists for medical treatment in Colombo without getting any of them killed.
They were also &quot;safely&quot; flown to the Colombo International Airport whenever they decided to talk and sometimes not talk. They were also &quot;safely&quot; flown
back from the Colombo International Airport to Tiger territory, whether they talked or not.

Soon after the devastating tsunami in December 2004, we at SCOPP yet again tried to extend our hand of goodwill to the LTTE. We collectively gathered food,
clothing and medicine and sent them to the LTTE Peace Secretariat in Kilinochchi via the SLMM. They returned our goodwill by brutally gunning down Foreign
Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar and then SCOPP Deputy Secretary-General Kethesh Loganathan, among many others.

Then there was P-TOMS, a joint mechanism to attend to post-tsunami reconstruction and rehabilitation, negotiated and signed by the Government of Sri Lanka
and the LTTE. This was the first time an agreement of its kind was signed on a functional subject. The Supreme Court put paid to it.

Many were the times we accompanied the Secretary-General of SCOPP each time he visited Jaffna, Vavuniya, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Mannar and Ampara where
the district offices of the SLMM are located. As we interacted with civil society, religious heads, the armed forces and people in the resettlement camps,
we could not help but notice the expressions of hope and relief on the faces of people as they regarded us as the ultimate bearers of a long-lost peace.

The peace process also proved to be a very lucrative source of income for some. With the signing of the CFA, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) mushroomed
and some even tried their best to legitimise their overloaded wallets through SCOPP. They came up with such ludicrous ideas in the name of peace. The workshops
on peace that these NGOs conducted in five-star hotels attracted a fair number of people, most of whom left or fell asleep after a sumptuous lunch.

Eminent personalities from the international and local arena, specialising in &quot;Peace Making/Peace Building&quot;, were frequent visitors to SCOPP. A few spoke
on matters with substance and the rest spoke a lot but said nothing.

A case in point was a gentleman who gave us a long and arduous lecture on the LTTE's secularism. He took great pains to explain to us the significance of
garlands carried by LTTE suicide cadre, with special reference to Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. We were told that garlands made of sandalwood signifies
one thing (painless and swift death), while garlands of flowers implied something else. From this I gathered that one must be extremely cautious of garlands,
because if you accept one, especially the sandalwood kind, you will end up dead and kill most of those around you as well.

At the end of this long and painful session, the Secretary-General very aptly summed up our sentiments with just one question/statement: &quot;So what about
it&quot;.

Yet another gimmick in the name of peace was a workshop on peace making/building for all staff at SCOPP, including the Secretary-General, who made a short
appearance and disappeared. One had to be present to believe what we went through, and for the life of me I could not comprehend what its objective was.

With the CFA practically sacrificed at the altar of short-term political gain, those of us who suffered much for the sake of a permanent peace in Sri Lanka
can only sit back and wonder, if it was all for nothing?

Sharmini Serasinghe was Director, Communications, of SCOPP from July 2004 to December 2006 and is currently a freelance writer.

Point of no return

JAYADEVA UYANGODA

The abrogation of the ceasefire agreement re-inaugurates in no uncertain terms a period of intense war escalation.

LAKRUWAN WANNIARACHCHI/AFP

The body of T. Maheswaran, Tamil Member of Parliament of the Opposition United National Party who was shot dead inside a temple in Colombo on January 1,
being taken for cremation in Colombo on January 3.

THE announcement made by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government on January 2 to abrogate the Cease Fire Agreement (CFA) with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) was hardly a good New Year gift presented to the people of Sri Lanka.

In fact, the New Year began literally with a bang. An assassin shot and killed T. Maheswaran, a Tamil Member of Parliament belonging to the United National
Party (UNP), the main Opposition party, inside a Hindu temple in Colombo when he was performing religious rituals. The next day came the news of the government
walking out of its international commitment to the CFA.

While many political and ideological actors in Sri Lanka cheered the government's decision, the UNP, peace constituencies and some governments abroad expressed
dismay over the decision, considering its possible consequences.

The way in which Sinhalese nationalist groups and the pro-government media welcomed the government's move to annul the CFA, which has been in operation
for five years and 10 months, indicated a sense of relief they seem to have experienced at the prospect of life without the CFA.

It was like the removal at last of a great burden, or a millstone around the neck, that the Sri Lankan state carried for years against its own will. In
a dissenting reaction, the UNP, which signed the CFA on February 22, 2002, while in power, warned that the CFA's abrogation would only strengthen the LTTE's
secessionist thrust.

Why did the Rajapaksa administration take this decision knowing quite well that it would generate serious international concerns while damaging irreparably
the regime's credibility abroad? There are two explanations, one military and the other political. The military explanation posits that since the government
has been planning a major military offensive against the LTTE, it did not want any constraint to be in force inhibiting the actions of the armed forces.

Even though the CFA has not prevented the escalation of hostilities during the past two years, under its terms the government as well as the LTTE had to
maintain some sense of responsibility towards the international community. The presence of the Nordic ceasefire monitors, the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission
(SLMM), in conflict areas has been a key mechanism through which the international community could observe directly and comment on the actions of the parties
to the conflict. Now there are no such external constraints. As the Sinhalese nationalist groups would put it in great joy, the Sri Lankan state has at
last reclaimed its lost &quot;sovereignty&quot; in the conduct of war, the great patriotic war against the Tamil &quot;terrorists&quot;.

The political reason is linked to the agenda of survival of the regime. The Rajapaksa regime, a coalition of several parties, does not have a majority in
Parliament.

At the voting for the budget in December, President Rajapaksa needed the support of the Sinhalese nationalist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which has
39 seats in Parliament. The JVP extended its support to the government's budget not by voting for it but by abstaining, thereby thwarting the Opposition
plan to defeat the government.

When some key ethnic minority allies of the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) regime threatened to leave the coalition at the time of the voting on
the budget, the JVP seems to have obtained a valuable quid pro quo. That was a guarantee from Rajapaksa to implement two of its key demands, the abrogation
of the CFA and the proscription of the LTTE.

The JVP has made these two demands for the past two years, but Rajapaksa has managed to resist them. Now, of course, full-scale war and JVP support are
crucial for the survival of the regime. The ban on the LTTE is most likely to be the next in line, before long. It will please the JVP and further ensure
the survival of the regime.

History of the CFA

The much-maligned, and now-abandoned, CFA has a colourful history. It was signed on February 21 and 22, 2002, as a part of the political engagement between
the LTTE and the United National Front (UNF) government led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The UNF won the parliamentary elections in December 2001 at a time when President Chandrika Kumaratunga's strategy of &quot;war for peace&quot; had produced serious
setbacks on the military and economic fronts.

A negative growth in the economy, a costly stalemate on the war front and instability within the People's Alliance (P.A.) regime had also created conditions
for a new approach to the ethnic conflict. The UNF won the election on a peace platform. Soon, the unofficial, unilateral and ad hoc ceasefires observed
by the new government and the LTTE for several weeks were formalised through Norwegian assistance. It appeared that the Norwegians had done the drafting
of the text of the February 2002 CFA.

There were some unusual dimensions to the political context in which the CFA came into being. First, when Wickremesinghe signed it, he did not have the
constitutional authority as such on matters of war or peace. That authority rested with his political rival, President Kumaratunga. Since the President
and the Prime Minister came from rival political camps, there emerged a new situation of fractured governmental authority. Wickremesinghe's constitutional
transgression occurred in this context and its justification lay in the parliamentary electoral victory of the UNF.

Second, in the backdrop of this fractured political authority, in which President Kumaratunga continued as the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces with
direct control over them, the heads of the armed forces were not adequately consulted in drafting the CFA, which was actually about cessation of the war.
They were shown the draft at the last moment but their views were not solicited.

Third, the Ranil Wickremesinghe administration was not much worried about the clauses of the CFA that reflected and indeed formalised the military balance
as it existed on the ground at the time. Moreover, the CFA was a sort of formal recognition of a particular power equilibrium on the grounds that in a
way served the LTTE's claim for parity of status.

All the three aspects noted above provided the context for sharp polarisation of political opinion about the CFA of February 2002. Critics of the CFA saw
it as an act of treachery by the UNF government. As a milder version of the same reaction put it, Wickremesinghe bent over backwards &quot;to please and appease
the LTTE&quot;.

One reason why the CFA enraged its critics in Sri Lanka and across the Palk Strait is the assessment that while institutionalising a military balance in
favour of the LTTE it also accorded the rebels a degree of legitimacy they did not deserve on any account.

Direct negotiations

SRIYANTHA WALPOLA

Monks belonging to the National Bhikku Front at a protest in Colombo on February 22, 2007, demanding the scrapping of the ceasefire agreement. In the eyes
of Sinhala nationalist groups, the Sri Lankan state, by abrogating the agreement, has at last reclaimed its lost &quot;sovereignty&quot; in the conduct of the war
against the Tamil &quot;terrorists&quot;.

These debates and controversies apart, the CFA was to provide a concrete starting point for direct negotiations between the UNF government and the LTTE.
On that score, the CFA achieved a favourable record. After much haggling and with patient facilitation by Norwegian diplomats, direct talks began in September

2002. After five rounds, negotiations reached a deadlock in April 2003, just eight months since talks began in Sattahip in Thailand.

It is surprising that the 2002-03 peace process did not produce a settlement agreement. It produced only the Cease Fire Agreement, which prevented the Sri
Lankan state and the LTTE from returning to large-scale hostilities at least for five years. That is the most simple, yet fundamentally positive, story
of the CFA.

Meanwhile, despite the CFA, the Mahinda Rajapaksa government and the LTTE resumed the war in 2006 and escalated hostilities in 2007. Until January 2008,
the two sides have been waging an undeclared war. Both the LTTE and the government have violated at will the terms of the CFA. Those who reify numbers
have reported that the LTTE violated the CFA many times more than the armed forces.

There is absolutely no point in blaming the CFA for those violations, which the parties committed with a sure sense of impunity. After all, ceasefires are
about the political will and commitment of the direct parties to de-escalate hostilities, refrain from military engagement and stay, in a process of political
engagement.

Violation of the CFA began slowly in 2002 and picked up pace after the replacement of the UNF regime by the UPFA in April 2004. The LTTE's violation of
the CFA began early, when it assassinated some intelligence operatives of the Sri Lankan military.

Interestingly, despite the CFA and the absence of open war, the covert war between the intelligence wings of the two sides continued even during direct
negotiations between the UNF government and the LTTE. Confrontations between the Sri Lanka Navy and the LTTE's sea wing also continued.

But in 2002 and 2003, these clashes did not lead to major setbacks, primarily because of the prevailing political atmosphere of engagement backed by the
CFA, the SLMM and the international support for peace.

The SLMM's role in defusing tension and resolving and managing conflicts between the government and the LTTE during these years is hardly recognised in
Sri Lanka. The SLMM got a rough deal from the LTTE as well as its counterparts in the Sinhalese polity.

It is the breakdown of negotiations in 2003 and the change in the political atmosphere in 2004 that really led to a process that eventually resulted in
the demise of the CFA. The Opposition parties led by Chandrika Kumaratunga's Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) used the negotiations with the LTTE and the
CFA as their primary targets of attack in the bid to topple Ranil Wickremesinghe's UNF administration.

The LTTE's intransigence in boycotting negotiations and the shortcomings of the ceasefire process were thus cleverly exploited by the newly emerged UPFA,
a coalition jointly led by the SLFP and the JVP. Their constant appeal to the fear and insecurities of Sinhalese voters, combined with the subtle Sinhalese
racism and xenophobia, was a powerful force to undermine and de-legitimise the basic norms and policy values on which the negotiations and the CFA were
based - ethnic accommodation, inter-ethnic tolerance, peace by peaceful means, reconciliation among adversaries, and external assistance.

Desire for war

Ironically, what appeared quite disturbing in Sri Lanka is that after two to three years of the ceasefire, some influential political forces, particularly
in the Sinhalese polity, wanted the war back, as if the relative absence of war had robbed them of something really valuable and un-retrievable. In the
LTTE, too, an argument seems to have developed that re-sharpening of contradictions between the Sri Lankan state and the Tamil polity by military means
was necessary to take the self-determination project forward.

Against such a backdrop of re-militarisation of the state-LTTE engagement, the very notion of peace became a dirty proposition in Sri Lanka, even among
influential sections of the Buddhist clergy. One most disquieting thing to note, though, is that politicians and the media have succeeded in turning the
war and violence into a popular desire. Thus, the abrogation of the CFA has taken place against the backdrop of a specific mass psychology of war.

Where will Sri Lanka go from here without the CFA?

In political terms, the abrogation of the CFA is a triumph for militarist forces in both Sinhalese and Tamil political formations. It re-inaugurates in
no certain terms a period of intense war escalation between the Sri Lankan state and the LTTE. Hereafter, it would be the logic of war that will propel
the island's politics forward.

What is scary in this post-CFA scenario is that both adversaries are preparing for what each of them may see in its own terms as the &quot;final&quot; war. If the
language of extreme belligerence being used of late is an indication, the government seems to think that this war can send the Tigers into &quot;extinction&quot;.
The LTTE in turn has given hints of its ability to carry out hugely destructive pre-emptive strikes. No one can guess what these would entail. But one
thing is clear, when the two sides are fighting to resolve the fundamental question and dispute about state power, the war this time around has sharpened
all the contradictions between them to a point of no return.

The sheer logic of the present context in which the hostilities are escalating indicates that the government will aim at destroying the military capabilities,
men and women combatants, and the entire military infrastructure of the LTTE. The armed forces seem to be determined, more than ever, to destroy the LTTE,
all its material and its leadership and fighters.

The other side of the logic is that the LTTE might also be preparing to deliver a crippling blow to the Sri Lankan state. In this logic, the LTTE will also
try to intensify the war on its own terms and through its own methods. Thus, one does not have to be a soothsayer to predict that the coming war is not
likely to be an ordinary war.

Alarmingly, Sri Lanka's war is not likely to generate much international attention unless it produces a massive humanitarian emergency. At a time when the
world is pretty much preoccupied with West Asia and Africa, Sri Lanka's conflicting parties will continue to enjoy a great deal of autonomy from international
pressure to take their war forward. There are no regional actors seriously committed to preventing Sri Lanka from moving fast on the path to the abyss.
Any new political initiative to grapple with Sri Lanka's conflict will have to wait until the outcome of the present phase of the ethnic war becomes clear.

Unease in Delhi

JOHN CHERIAN

The strong statement by India can be construed as being critical of the Sri Lankan government's decision to end the ceasefire formally.

V. SUDERSHAN

Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and National Security Adviser M.K. Narayanan in New Delhi on October 13, 2007.

The January 2 decision by the Sri Lankan government to officially pull out of the 2002 Cease Fire Agreement (CFA) with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) officially has not come as a surprise to New Delhi. After all, the country has been in a state of undeclared civil war for the last two years.

Ever since assuming office in November 2005, the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa has been looking forward to a military solution to end the 25-year-old
conflict. Indian officials point out that on the campaign trail Rajapaksa had promised to abrogate the Norwegian-facilitated peace deal and defeat the
Tigers militarily. His election manifesto, titled &quot;Mahinda Chinthanaya&quot; (Mahinda Thought), had called for the review of the CFA and the bolstering of the
military.

It is no secret that New Delhi would have preferred a victory for Ranil Wickremesinghe and the United National Party (UNP) in the last elections. Wickremesinghe
was for a negotiated settlement of the long-running ethnic conflict, which was having an adverse impact on the country's economy.

New Delhi had seemingly given up on efforts to persuade the Rajapaksa government to give peace efforts another chance. Indian officials said that there
was very little they could do to persuade a President who, buoyed by recent successes, was convinced that he was on the verge of scoring a decisive military
victory over the LTTE.

The External Affairs Ministry issued a strong statement, which could be construed as being critical of the Sri Lankan government's decision to end the ceasefire
formally. &quot;India strongly believes that there is no military solution to the issue,&quot; the Foreign Ministry spokesman said. &quot;At the same time, we are acutely
conscious that what is required in Sri Lanka is a settlement of political, constitutional and other issues within the framework of a united Sri Lanka with
which all the communities of Sri Lanka are comfortable.&quot; The statement went on to stress that it &quot;was only through such a settlement that a lasting peace
can return to that troubled country&quot;.

The Indian government has expressed the hope that &quot;any step that leads to a reduction in levels of violence and human suffering in Sri Lanka is welcome&quot;.
External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee strongly reiterated this during an interaction with an Indian news agency. He said that India favoured a political,
not a military, solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka. Despite some initial misgivings, India had also supported the Norwegian facilitation in the peace
process. New Delhi welcomed the Geneva talks of February 2006 and the commitments made by both sides to uphold the ceasefire agreement.

After his victory in the November 2005 elections, the first foreign visit Rajapaksa made was to India, at the end of the year. Later, he met Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit in Havana in September 2006. Rajapaksa came again on an official visit to India
in December 2006. The last visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Sri Lanka was by Atal Bihari Vajpayee during the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) summit in Colombo in 1998.

Bilateral relations between India and Sri Lanka remain strong. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) and the Bilateral
Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement (BIPPA) between the two countries are illustrations of the close ties.

There was talk about the two countries signing a wide-ranging defence agreement during the presidency of Chandrika Kumaratunga. A draft agreement was on
the anvil but New Delhi seems to have had a change of mind on the issue. India continues to train Sri Lankan soldiers, and the two countries cooperate
in surveillance activities around the waters surrounding the Jaffna peninsula. And on May 2006, India extended the ban on the LTTE by another two years.

Recent developments are unlikely to impact adversely the close ties between India and Sri Lanka. At the same time, the Indian government has been urging
Colombo to put forward a credible devolution package at the earliest. India has expressed its readiness to share its constitutional experience on the subject.

Internationally, some of the donor countries may have a rethink. According to the statement issued by the five Scandinavian and Nordic countries that have
provided truce monitors to the island, the ceasefire had saved as many as 10,000 lives in the first three years when there were relatively few violations.
After 2005, when violence escalated, the casualty rate increased dramatically. Most of those affected have been minority Tamils and Muslims. As many as
250,000 people have been displaced from their homes since July 2006. The dismantling of the international monitoring mission following the abrogation of
the ceasefire could lead to an escalation in the already high level of violence. The government as well as the LTTE have kept other independent observers
and the media out of the conflict zones.

An indication of New Delhi's apparent unhappiness with the turn of events will be the absence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the 60th anniversary celebrations
of the island- nation's independence on February 4. There has been a lot of criticism from political parties in Tamil Nadu, which are allies of the Congress
party at the Centre, about the Sri Lankan military's prosecution of war crimes and the treatment being meted out to the Tamil minority in that country.

They are especially upset by the military onslaught on their linguistic compatriots on the island. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
president M. Karunanidhi had written a poem in the memory of the slain chief negotiator of the LTTE, S.P. Tamilselvan. Political parties such as Marumalarchi
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam demanded that the Indian Prime Minister should not visit Sri Lanka at this juncture as it could be interpreted as a tacit support
to the hawkish line being pursued by the Rajapaksa government.

Indian officials, however, say that the Prime Minister's office never gave any firm dates for an official visit to the country. Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Rohitha Bogollagama who had earlier announced to the media about the Indian Prime Minister's impending visit, later clarified that Sri Lanka was not looking
at a fixed schedule for Manmohan Singh's visit.

&quot;We want the Indian Prime Minister to pay a bilateral visit since no Indian Prime Minister has paid a bilateral visit in the last 20 years,&quot; he told the
media in Colombo. The last &quot;bilateral&quot; visit by an Indian Prime Minister was made in 1987, when Rajiv Gandhi was in Colombo to sign the India-Sri Lanka
Accord.

PAKISTAN

Creeping fear

NIRUPAMA SUBRAMANIAN
in Islamabad

Terror announces its arrival in Lahore, a city that has remained insulated so far from jehadi shootings and bombings.

PAKISTAN PRESS INFORMATION DEPARTMENT/AP

President Pervez Musharraf at a news conference in Islamabad on January 3.

THERE is a dark cloud of gloom over Pakistan as its multiple crises converge and escalate relentlessly. Barely had the country grasped the enormity of the
December 27 assassination of one of its biggest political leaders in a gun-and-suicide attack when terror struck again, this time in Lahore, the capital
of Punjab province, the country's political nerve centre and a vibrant city that had seemed an island of peace in the midst of the waves of terror that
had gripped the rest of the country.

The January 10 attack in Lahore showed the deep roots of militancy, once watered and nurtured by the state, and the hydra-headed monster that it has grown
into, its spread extending over all of Pakistan. Add to this a resurgent Sindhi militancy in the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's killing, the ham-handed
manner in which the government has been investigating the assassination, the uncertainty about the general elections which were postponed from January
8 to February 18, talk of unilateral American action in the north-western tribal areas, and you get a nation full of people asking: &quot;Where is Pakistan
heading?&quot;

The misgivings had been around for some time, but the credibility of the Musharraf regime has suddenly sunk to a new low. There is a widespread impression,
even among those who did not particularly care about Benazir Bhutto, that the government failed to provide the two-time Prime Minister adequate security
and is somehow complicit in her killing. The contradictory versions put out by the government, including the controversial theory that she died of a skull
fracture after hitting her head on the lever of the sunroof of her armoured vehicle when she ducked the suicide attack on her, have only strengthened the
belief that the government has something to hide.

&quot;Henceforth there should be no ambiguity that [Benazir Bhutto] died of a bullet, pellet or splinters,&quot; said Brigadier (retd) Javed Iqbal Cheema, spokesman
of the Interior Ministry, as he set out the car lever theory. Famous last words. Within 24 hours, new evidence surfaced from the site of the blast that
exposed the government as being clueless at best. At worst, it was lying.

Most people in Pakistan instinctively believe the second, especially after Dawn News television showed amateur video footage from the scene of the killing,
exposing the government badly. The footage showed Benazir slumping back into the car - seconds before the explosion - after a short-haired man in the crowd
around her car wearing a light brown sports jacket and dark glasses fires at her with a pistol from a distance of about two metres.

The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) came out of mourning for its leader to slam the government, and those in the party who had seen Benazir's body, including
Sherry Rehman, who heads the party's &quot;information secretariat&quot; and helped prepare the body for burial, said they had seen more than one bullet wound in
the head and the neck area. The PPP demanded an international inquiry into the killing along the lines of the United Nations-sponsored investigation into
the assassination of Rafik Hariri, former Prime Minister of Lebanon.

In an attempt at damage control, President Pervez Musharraf called in Scotland Yard, but it did little to increase the confidence of either the PPP or the
man in the street that the government is interested in getting to the bottom of a killing that shook the country to its very core and sent shock waves
around the world.

SIMON DAWSON/BLOOMBERG NEWS

Bilawal Bhutto Zardari (left), Benazir's son and chairman of the Pakistan People's Party, leaving a press conference in London on January 8.

The PPP wants an investigation into the &quot;conspiracy&quot; behind the killing. Benazir's husband, Asif Zardari, who has taken effective charge of the party, demanded
that her letter to CNN (Cable News Network) anchor Wolf Blitzer, through an American friend Mark Siegel, be treated as her &quot;dying declaration&quot;. In the
letter, Benazir wrote about the inadequacy of the security provided to her and said that if anything happened to her, Musharraf should be held responsible.

Zardari and the PPP want this letter to be read with an earlier letter, from Benazir to Musharraf before she returned to Pakistan in October 2007, pointing
to four people in his regime as conspirators in a plot to kill her. Pervaiz Elahi, the former Chief Minister of Punjab and a cousin of Shujat Hussain,
president of the Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid), or PML(Q), a Musharraf ally, is one of the persons she named. The serving Director-General of the Intelligence
Bureau is another.

Although Musharraf felt enough pressure to invite British detectives, he made it clear that they would not be going on a &quot;wild goose chase&quot;, and described
Benazir's allegations as &quot;wild&quot; and &quot;baseless&quot;. The detectives, he said, would only offer their expertise in analysing forensic evidence.

But that left everyone asking what the Scotland Yard team, which arrived within eight days of the killing, would investigate. Fire engines of the Rawalpindi
Municipality washed the scene of the blast within hours, an act that Musharraf was forced to criticise as a &quot;mistake&quot; but one that he also blithely explained
away as a result of &quot;inefficiency&quot; rather than a deliberate design by the government to hide something.

The doctors at Rawalpindi General Hospital did not carry out a post-mortem on Benazir. The very nature of her wounds are in doubt, and there are suspicions
that the doctors' reports were themselves &quot;doctored&quot;. But Zardari, who did not consent to the post-mortem to begin with, is unlikely to permit an exhumation
of Benazir's body for a proper examination. Under the circumstances, Scotland Yard's assistance is mainly confined to examining the available video footage.

Despite the government's insistence that it had given Benazir top-grade security, questions persist about its adequacy. The government's response, and that
of Musharraf, has been to shift the responsibility to Benazir. &quot;Who is to blame&quot; for her coming out of the sunroof of her car when she could have ridden
safely from the scene of the attack unhurt, like the others in the vehicle, Musharraf asked at a press conference. It is a valid question. Benazir took
a risk by succumbing to the temptation of putting her head through the sunroof. But why did the police not stop people from collecting around the VIP exit
gate of Liaquat Bagh as Benazir was leaving after addressing a rally at the venue? And how did a sharpshooter and a suicide bomber - if they were two separate
people - get so close to her?

An important consequence of the Benazir killing was the postponement of the January 8 elections. The Election Commission of Pakistan, hardly seen as an
independently functioning authority, announced a 40-day postponement to February 18. As reasons for the deferment, it cited the outbreak of violence in
the Sindh province, which it claimed had destroyed election material, including ballot boxes in as many as nine areas, and disrupted the printing of ballot
papers. But political pundits saw the postponement as a reaction to a possible sympathy wave for the PPP to the detriment of the PML(Q) and the Muttahida
Qaumi Movement, another Musharraf ally, and the hope that this would abate by the second half of February.

There are also concerns that the regime may resort to unfair means in order to check the PPP and the Nawaz Sharif-headed Pakistan Muslim League (N). Sharif
has held out the prospect of &quot;cooperation&quot; between the two parties in a post-election scenario, which holds a range of possibilities, from formation of
a coalition government to acting together against Musharraf, and if the required numbers are available in Parliament, even coming together to move for
an impeachment. But rigging would break the last straw on the camel's back and could bring the people out on the streets in large numbers, especially in
Sindh, which is seething with anger against Punjab at the killing of Benazir.

SAEED KHAN/AFP

Asif Ali Zardari, Benazir's husband, during a press interview at Naudero in Sindh province on January 7.

Political circles are abuzz with speculation that given the circumstances, the elections may not be held at all and that the government may find one pretext
or another to postpone them. The levels of sectarian violence during the Moharram month, which began on January 11, and which usually sees an escalation
in Sunni-Shia tensions, should be one indicator.

Fears for the election were strengthened with the Lahore bombing that killed 20 policemen and three others, exactly two weeks after Benazir's assassination.
The shock in Pakistan was palpable. The city, which is regarded as the cultural and political capital of the country, has thus far remained insulated from
the terror wave sweeping across other parts of the country.

It is well known, however, that banned Islamist militant outfits that once provided the fodder for the jehadi cause in Afghanistan and Kashmir with active
assistance from the state are still active in many parts of Punjab. For instance, a retired major with reported links with Al Qaeda was arrested in Lahore
in December 2007 for planning the suicide attack on a Pakistan Air Force bus in Sargodha the previous month that killed eight airmen and left 40 wounded.
His arrest led to the arrest of seven others, suspected to be members of the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi or the Jaish-e-Mohammed, both banned groups, and offshoots
of what Daily Times called the &quot;mother jihadi outfit&quot;, the banned Sipah-e-Sahaba. The bombing in Lahore once again raised difficult questions about the
effectiveness of Pakistan's role in the &quot;war on terror&quot;.

Such is the mood in the country that even commentators who rooted for Musharraf's continuance as the best bet for Pakistan a few months ago now say that
it would be better if he made a dignified exit before the situation gets any worse. But coming face to face with Musharraf, one would hardly guess that
he is burdened by his unpopularity. At an interaction with foreign correspondents, he appeared relaxed, confident and even jovial, in the mood to take
as many tough questions as the equally battle-hardened journalists could serve up.

He flinched only when he was asked whether he had &quot;the blood of Benazir Bhutto&quot; on his hands but recovered quickly to come back with the strong retort that
he came from &quot;a civilised and educated family&quot;, which did not believe in killings and assassinations as tribal or feudal families might.

He spoke about how carefully he had planned his three-stage transition to democracy but winged over a question on why he thinks it necessary to keep the
ousted Chief Justice, Iftikhar Chaudhary, and his lawyer, Aitzaz Ahsan, under detention. He told the journalists that they knew nothing about Pakistan
and that all their reportage was &quot;wrong&quot; and based on their interaction with &quot;30 per cent&quot; of the people, who led modern lives in the cities.

In the villages, where 70 per cent of Pakistan lived, Musharraf said, he was still popular. From a leader who has touted education and &quot;moderate enlightenment&quot;
as the answer to the country's manifold problems, it sounded breathtakingly self-serving to put down Pakistan's educated class in one go. It also showed
the extent to which he is in denial.

POLITICS

Mayawati's turn

VENKITESH RAMAKRISHNAN

The Congress-BSP bonhomie to fight Mulayam Singh Yadav has ended and new games that can influence national politics have begun.

VIJAY JOSHI/PTI

Mayawati at the press conference in New Delhi on January 7 where she accused some Congress leaders of conspiring to eliminate her. At left is her close
aide Satish Chandra Mishra.

THE new year promises to be one of exciting new turns in Uttar Pradesh politics. The Mayawati-led ruling Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the principal opposition
party, the Samajwadi Party (S.P.), are at the centre of developments that have raised this promise, but the course of events and the impact they will have
are bound to affect the two major forces in national politics, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The developments that unravelled in the
first ten days of 2008 were significant and at times dramatic.

Central to these developments is the redefining of the relationship between the BSP and the Congress, the leader of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA)
ruling at the Centre. For the past four years - broadly the period since the inception of the UPA government - the BSP and the Congress have had a symbiotic
political relationship, which placed the S.P. as the principal adversary of both the parties in Uttar Pradesh.

Until the BSP came to power in Uttar Pradesh in May 2007, the Congress and BSP campaigns against the then Mulayam Singh Yadav-led S.P. government in the
State displayed a level of convergence, although technically both parties advanced independent initiatives. The initial days after the BSP's rise to power
in Uttar Pradesh were marked by a sense of bonhomie between the State and Central governments. Leaders of the Union government, including Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh, and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi expressed a readiness to respond positively to the demands of the Uttar Pradesh government. In turn, Chief
Minister Mayawati vouched lasting support to the UPA.

All that changed in the first few days of 2008. The clearest indicator of this came at a press conference that Mayawati addressed in New Delhi on January

7. Making a dramatic presentation, Mayawati accused some Congress leaders of conspiring to eliminate her. She stated that State intelligence agencies had
reported an enhanced threat to her life and, consequently, the Uttar Pradesh government sought Special Protection Group (SPG) cover for her but the Union
government refused to grant it. &quot;In such a situation, the Congress leadership would be entirely responsible if something untoward happened to her,&quot; she
said. Mayawati also said that all this had made the BSP consider withdrawal of support to the UPA government and added that a decision would be taken after
her birthday on January 15.

Mayawati argued that the refusal to deploy SPG protection for her was only one of the many inimical moves by the Congress against the BSP. &quot;The Congress-led
coalition at the Centre is following the same path as the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government before it and is harassing me by trying
to involve me in fake cases,&quot; she said. She cited as a case in point the &quot;deliberate delay&quot; by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to close the disproportionate
assets case against her.

Another indication of the conspiracy against her, she said, was the patronage provided by some Congress leaders to Atiq Ahmed, Lok Sabha member from Phulpur,
who is an accused in the case relating to the murder of Raju Pal, a former BSP Member of the Legislative Assembly. Ahmed won the Lok Sabha election as
an S.P. candidate and was expelled recently from the party. He is apparently moving closer to the Congress along with Beni Prasad Verma, another expelled

S.P. leader.

Politicians and political observers in Uttar Pradesh give a number of reasons for the fast-changing equations between the Congress and the BSP. Qualitatively,
these fall into categories such as political, financial and administrative. A widely held perception is that Mayawati has not taken lightly to the Union
Home Ministry's criticism of the security lapses of the State forces, which apparently led to the terrorist attack at Rampur on January 1. The second reason
apparently relates to the disproportionate assets case against her. According to many BSP activists, the Central government is dilly-dallying on this case.

&quot;In June 2007, when the Congress needed the BSP's votes in the presidential election, the State's Governor, T.V. Rajeshwar, even refused to sanction prosecution
against Behenji in the Taj Corridor case. Now, they are slowing down, obviously with an aim to use the disproportionate assets case as a political weapon,&quot;
a senior BSP leader told Frontline. The leader also pointed out that all this was happening on account of the growing political clout of Mayawati in other
parts of the country, including South India. In the leader's perception, this political reason was the prime motivation for the Congress' anti-BSP manoeuvres.

This political factor had come into play even before the advent of the new year. The results of the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections, which were announced
in the last week of December 2007, showed that the BSP had secured approximately
