I know this topic has been discussed quite a bit, but I guess to
refinish or not depends on the present state and potential value of an
antique item, and I'd like an opinion on what to do with a couple of
items I have. 1. An oak, Wernicke 3 cabinet Stratford made barrister's
bookcase with ogee base which has been much abused and really needs a
good refinishing. Not paint abuse, but so many scratches and tiny
gouges. It's structually sound, but also missing 2 of the glass doors
to the bottom cabinets (D 12 1/2), but the top cabinet has the nice
leaded glass lattice on it. If sold at auction, I am told it could
only get 200 Canadian. Would it then be worth more for me to try to
restore it (also try to buy 2 doors), or would all this lower the
value even more, even if a good job was done?

2. I also have a weird looking little sewing cabinet/box that is
shaped a little bit like a barn, with the roof opening up and sliding
back from the edges in 2 pieces. It also has many brass thread spool
holders/brackets on the lid and a carrying handle in the middle.
However, though also structually sound, it also is in terrible looking
condition with varnish missing and ugly water stains all over the
reddish wood (cherry?). I'd really like to make this little item
better looking (though it hasn't been appraised), since it would be
much easier to do than the bookcase, being so small and portable. I've
had experience refinishing various kinds of furniture, but none as old
as these 2 items, and I wouldn't want to devalue them in the effort.
Thanks for any advice.

"/>  The &quot;shouldn't have refinished, it ruined the value&quot; caveat
is given when the item is a fine antique that would have been
in great condition before it was &quot;fixed&quot;. You see this on
the US version of Antiques Roadshow, when someone
brings in a refinished piece of 1700s Philadelphia furniture.

Antiques Roadshow has had so many comments on the
issue, they've even put up a webpage here:
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/roadshow/series/behind/cook/2000/11.06....

An interesting comment on that page (yes, it's from
a &quot;professional refinisher&quot;) states:

&quot;&quot;But the ROADSHOW reaches millions of people who
almost never see this type of furniture other than in
museums. These people are misled because the
appraisers don't establish that they're only talking about
rare pieces when they claim that value is lost by
repairing or refinishing.&quot; Further, when the experts are
dealing with a piece that has been repaired or refinished,
the writer continues, &quot;they don't point out that the
[piece] was most likely in poor or unpresentable
condition to begin with, or it wouldn't have been
repaired or refinished.&quot;

As for your bookcase: repair away, and make it
something that you'd want to have in your home,
rather than something relegated to the garage.

"/> Usually these are hard to answer without seeing the piece. It must be in
terrible shape if it would only fetch 200 CDN. Barrister bookcases from the
30's and 40's bring more than that round these parts, as they are snapped
up for their decorator value. If its missing the glass, I would go ahead and
conserve it.Find a good fellow that will spend some time on it for you.
Conservation does not mean dumping goop all over it, stripping it off, power
sanding it, and then re-staining with Flecto....that is re-finishing, and
that is just fine for your modern dining room table that your kids tap
danced on. The conservator will look at your piece and see what has to be
worked on, what can be left alone, and harmonize the work to make it appear
whole. A deeply gouged surface is bad on anything....UNLESS the reason the
gouge is there is because Ben Franklin got drunk one night after the
Revolution and danced on it. Other places gouges might be OK are on kitchen
sideboards, particularly Quebec or Ontario pine, around the cutting / food
prep area. On a bookcase the pattern of wear books make on the shelves, and
the touch wear and the front of the shelves where hands and fingers rest
when drawing a book out is desirable.

Read Mr. McKinleys piece above on his clock. Note how he talks about the
normal handling by human hands, the deep glow of the finish, etc. These are
the things many re-finishers destroy. After reading that, and looking at the
pictures of his wonderful clock, look at your piece. Is this the type of
surface you have?

"/> Water stains are not hard to take out. However, on this piece I am going to
tell you to be careful, and get some good advice, or post a picture. The
reason being is it sounds like it might be folk art, or of itinerate origin.
In that case the advice would be very different.

"/> You know, if you find some nice conservator, and pay for the service,
sometimes they let you watch as your piece is done...The other thing some do
is tell you how to proceed, then sell you a little pot of some suitable
thing to use.

That is, unless, they are too &quot;wizened&quot;
