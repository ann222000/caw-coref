Christopher Marlowe   Doctor Faustus.
Scene III   [A Grove.]

Faust.  What, is great Mephistophilis so passionate
For being depriv'd of the joys of Heaven?
Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude,
And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess.
Go bear these tidings to great Lucifer:
Seeing Faustus hath incurr'd eternal death
By desperate thoughts against Jove's deity,
Say he surrenders up to him his soul,
So he will spare him *four and twenty years*
Letting him live in all voluptuousness;
Having thee ever to attend on me;
To give me whatsoever I shall ask,
To tell me whatsoever I demand,
To slay mine enemies, and aid my friends,
And always be obedient to my will.
Go and return to mighty Lucifer,
And meet me in my study at midnight,
And then resolve me of thy master's mind.
.
Meph.  I will, Faustus.  Exit.

[GENEVA] 2 Samuel 21:18 And after this also there was a battle
with the Philistines at *GOB* , then Sibbechai the Hushathite
slew Saph, which was one of ye sons of Haraphah. And there
was yet another battle in *GOB* with the Philistines,
where Elhanah the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite
.
*slew Goliath the Gittite*
*the staff of whose spear was like a _WEAVER's BEAM_ *
.
Afterward there was also a battle in Gath,
where was a man of a great stature,
and had on *EVERY* hand six fingers,
and on *EVERY* foot six toes,
*four and twenty in number* :
who was also the son of Haraphah.

.                CHAPTER III Part II
OF THE LAUGHABLE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE,
SANCHO PANZA, AND THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO
.
&lt;&lt;"I promise thee, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "the author of our
history will be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that
they choose to write about is hidden."
.
"What!" said Sancho, "a sage and an enchanter! Why, the bachelor
SAMSON Carrasco (that is the name of him I spoke of) says
the author of the history is called Cide Hamete Berengena."&gt;&gt;
.
&lt;&lt;The bachelor, though he was called SAMSON, was of no great bodily
size, but he was a very great wag; he was of a sallow complexion,
but very sharp-witted, somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age,
with a round face, a flat nose, and a large mouth, all indications
of a mischievous disposition and a love of fun and jokes; and of
this he gave a sample as soon as he saw Don Quixote, by falling on his
knees before him and saying, "Let me kiss your mightiness's hand,
Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, for, by the habit of St. Peter that
I wear, though I have no more than the first four orders, your worship
is one of the most famous knights-errant that have ever been, or
will be, all the world over. A blessing on Cide Hamete Benengeli,
who has written the history of your great deeds, and a double
blessing on that connoisseur who took the trouble of having it
translated out of the Arabic into our Castilian vulgar tongue
for the universal entertainment of the people!"&gt;&gt;
.
&lt;&lt;Don Quixote made him rise, and said,
"So, then, it is true that there is a history of me,
and that it was a Moor and a sage who wrote it?"
.
"So true is it, senor," said SAMSON, "that my belief is there are
more than twelve thousand volumes of the said history in print this
very day. Only ask Portugal, Barcelona, and Valencia, where they
have been printed, and moreover there is a report that it is being
printed at Antwerp, and I am persuaded there will not be a country
or language in which there will not be a translation of it."&gt;&gt;
.
&lt;&lt;"The sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle," replied SAMSON;
"he tells all and sets down everything, even to the capers
that worthy Sancho cut in the blanket."&gt;&gt;
.
&lt;&lt;"At the same time they might fairly have passed them over in
silence," observed Don Quixote; "for there is no need of recording
events which do not change or affect the truth of a history, if
they tend to bring the hero of it into contempt. AEneas was not
in truth and earnest so pious as Virgil represents him,
nor Ulysses so wise as Homer describes him."
.
"That is true," said SAMSON; "but it is one thing to write as a
poet, another to write as a historian; the poet may describe or
sing things, not as they were, but as they ought to have been;
but the historian has to write them down, not as they ought
to have been, but as they were, without adding anything to
the truth or taking anything from it."&gt;&gt;
.
&lt;&lt;TOM CECIL, seeing how ill they had succeeded, and what a sorry
end their expedition had come to, said to the bachelor, "Sure
enough, Senor SAMSON Carrasco, we are served right; it is easy
enough to plan and set about an enterprise, but it is often a
difficult matter to come well out of it. Don Quixote a madman, and
we sane; he goes off laughing, safe, and sound, and you are left
sore and sorry! I'd like to know now which is the madder, he who
is so because he cannot help it, or he who is so of his own choice?"
To which SAMSON replied, "The difference between the two sorts of
madmen is, that he who is so will he nil he, will be one always,
while he who is so of his own accord can leave off being one
whenever he likes."&gt;&gt;
.
&lt;&lt;"And about me," said Sancho, "for they say, too,
that I am one of the principal presonages in it."
.
"Personages, not presonages, friend Sancho," said SAMSON.&gt;&gt;
.
&lt;&lt;"I have seen governors in these parts," said Sancho,
"that are not to be compared to my shoe-sole; and for all
that they are called 'your lordship' and served on silver."
.
"Those are not governors of islands," observed SAMSON,
"but of other governments of an easier kind:
those that govern islands must at least know gRAM-MAR."
.
"I could manage the gRAM well enough," said Sancho; "but for the
MAR I have neither leaning nor liking, for I don't know what it is;&gt;&gt;
.
&lt;&lt;"Thou art in the right of it, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "and
the bachelor SAMSON Carrasco, if he enters the pastoral fraternity,
as no doubt he will, may call himself the shepherd SAMSONino, or
perhaps the shepherd Carrascon; Nicholas the barber may call himself
Niculoso, as old Boscan formerly was called Nemoroso; as for the
curate I don't know what name we can fit to him unless it be something
derived from his title, and we call him the shepherd Curiambro.&gt;&gt;
.
&lt;&lt;"Call in to me my good friends the curate, the bachelor SAMSON
Carrasco, and Master Nicholas the barber, for I wish to confess and
MAKE MY WILL ... The curate and the bachelor SAMSON Carrasco,
now present, I appoint my executors."&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;'MR. BLUNDERUM delighted the section with a most interesting and
valuable paper "on the last moments of the learned pig," which
produced a very strong impression on the assembly, the account
being compiled from the personal recollections of his favourite
attendant. The account stated in the most emphatic terms that the
animal's name was not Toby, but Solomon; and distinctly proved that
he could have no near relatives in the profession, as many
designing persons had falsely stated, inasmuch as his father,
mother, brothers and sisters, had all fallen victims to the butcher
at different times. An uncle of his indeed, had with very great
labour been traced to a sty in Somers Town; but as he was in a very
infirm state at the time, being afflicted with measles, and shortly
afterwards disappeared, there appeared too much reason to
conjecture that he had been converted into sausages. The disorder
of the learned pig was originally a seVERE cold, which, being
aggravated by excessive trough indulgence, finally settled upon the
lungs, and terminated in a general decay of the constitution. A
melancholy instance of a presentiment entertained by the animal of
his approaching dissolution, was recorded. After gratifying a
numerous and fashionable company with his performances, in which no
falling off whatever was visible, he fixed his eyes on the
biographer, and, turning to the watch which lay on the floor, and
on which he

Marlowe, speaking through Faustus, says he has eschewed the Devil's

MM:
If we reject the Master, Satan might offer all this to us.  He will
give us what we want.  He doesn't tell us, however, that we create
many bad karmas by living in this world.  If we are in a swimming
pool, we will make waves (karmas), and they will reverberate around
the universe.  We should be wary of falling into Satan's trap.  It's
like chasing a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.  It's all
illusion, not real, at all.  In this way, Satan keeps us tied down in
mind and maya, far from the Eternal True Home.

MM:
So, Marlowe is pointing out to us our alternatives, either follow
Satan, or God, through the Master.  This is antithetical, by the way,
to charges of atheism, regarding Marlowe.  Once again, he has
mentioned JOVE.
