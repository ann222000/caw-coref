After viewing this newsgroup for the first time, I saw several items listed
here for sale. I posted a couple of things that I wanted to sell, and
immediately received alot of unwanted email from people telling me not to
post for sale items here. If there are rules to this newsgroup, they
should be made known ahead of time. One letter I received was downright
RUDE!

"/> Dear Kimee,
Please excuse the rude folks who take it upon themselves to speak for the
group. They are just on a power trip &amp; like to jump on newbies for their daily
power fix. Yes the group does have rules and they are listed at the web site in
my sig file as noted. Please take the time to glance through them &amp; join us in
our daily battle to keep our sanity. Regards, David

Kimberly,
IMO, let the penalty fit the crime. You get no sympathy from me (I did
NOT send Kimee ANY e-mail,rude or otherwise,so once again it was NOT
ME).
As for David's daily battle for sanity goes,I think that he lost that
battle long ago...... IMO

"/> On my ISP, when I open rec.antiques it tells me that rec.antiques
is a discussion newsgroup, but I know on others that info isn't
always given.

The conventional thing to do, on *all* Usenet newsgroups, is to
read them for a few days or so, to get a feel for what their
purpose is. I know that in the past week, Colin Douthwaite's
post, &quot;New to rec.antiques?&quot; has appeared here, and it explains
that the purpose of this group is discussion, not FS and WTB
ads.

Take heart, Kimee. Just as in life, there are pleasant people
and there are rude people on the Internet. But it really is
considered polite to see what a conversation is about before
jumping in. :) So welcome to rec.antiques. Most of us don't
bite, though some bark a lot. Don't be afraid to join the
discussion.

Linda

Smoething really should be done about him or her, IMO. I mean, can't
you sue for copyright violations or something; I thought you had an
exclusive franchise. ;-)

Golly----
&amp; here i thought it was more polite to send a private e-mail (&amp;
courteous, I might add) than post to the newsgroup! My screen
clearly says &quot;discussing antiques &amp; vintage items&quot;, but maybe
all the servers don't have that information available?

"/> There are rules, and they are posted. It's called FAQ - Frequently Asked
Questions. FAQ's exist for almost all newgroups on the internet. Do a
search in
your web browser, and you'll find thousands.

Besides being the rules, they are excellent resources for information!
They'll
answer almost all your questions on the basics of a given topic. That
way you
can be an informed participant in the discussion group, rather than
asking
redundant questions.

Hope my info helps.

By the way, the sales news group is rec.antiques.marketplace

"/> My server doesn't but it does have a huge box you can't miss on the right when
you get into the newsgroup labeled &quot;About Newsgroups&quot;. If people would take
the time to look here they would see everything needed to know about
netiquette. Of importance is the paragraph, &quot;Just like any community, Usenet
Newsgroups have a well-established culture. When you subscribe to a newsgroup,
take some time to read the newsgroup traffic before posting.....&quot; And, &quot;Most
newsgroups contain a FAQ list that answers common questions about the group.
Reading this document before posting is essential to your understanding of the
topics the group may have already discussed in depth, what they choose not to
discuss at all, or what the group has decided is not relevant to current
topics.&quot; Alas, I think Ronnie was absolutely correct when he says certain
people won't care enough to read this.

"/> Dear Leota,
The main thought of my post was to convey a message to some of the quick
fingered foul mouthed people who claim to represent this group to be a bit more
patient with new posters. OBTW in the future please send all your responses to
the group without cc ing to the poster. That's a personal request when dealing
with me anyway. You'll mellow out after you've been here a year or so. C YA,
David
