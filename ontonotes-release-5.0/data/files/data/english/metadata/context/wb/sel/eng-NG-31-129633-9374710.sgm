Dear Ranjit,

I wish to respond to the issue you have raised (and much of the ongoing
debate) in three, different, ways:

1) I don't think there has been any discussion here about open space norms
and what kinds of issues are significant to this. If at least this debate
can initiate that, I would be happy.

2 a) Regarding Modi: I think he is an outright criminal and that there is
ample evidence from Gujarat in the past many years (and certainly post the
carnage) to associate him directly with what happened there, as indeed the
continuing ways in which the atmosphere is vitiated, and the bizarre extent
of communalising of every day life in that state. To my mind, it is for him
to prove that he is not a criminal than for any of the victims (or any of us
who believe him to be a criminal) to prove otherwise.

2 b) I also think there is a simple difference between Sugathakumari and
Narendra Modi - that is the extent of power and control possible in the
hands of a poet/'personality' as opposed to a politician. Therefore, even
though cult figures can be culpable my own guess is that the extent of
damage might be far less (but then I speak without any knowledge of some of
the issues raised by you and Geedha, particularly the rape case in Abhaya).
Dileep Raj argues quite convincingly to the contrary, so it might really be
worthwhile to know the basis for such an allegation, which is quite strong
and damning, to say the least.

2 c) Having said this, I agree with you that double standards in discussions
can be quite fruitless. Often, many of us voice our opinions without
providing &quot;proof&quot;. Besides, as can be seen in the discussions over the past
few days (unless I am totally missing something and these are all internal
battles amongst people who know each other), unless people agree with each
other no amount of &quot;proof&quot; seems to convince the other. So either 'proof'
needs to be defined or maybe proof ought to be discarded as the grounds for
locating one's beliefs! However, the alacrity with which the moderator
chooses to muzzle a difference of opinion is a little worrying.

3)On a different note: regarding the tone of &quot;romanticization&quot; regarding
&quot;the people&quot; and &quot;their struggles&quot; - and despite Dileep's strenuous
arguments to the contrary there is a strong whiff of that in all these
exchanges - I just wished to share an anecdote from 1993 when some of us, as
part of the Sampradayikta Virodhi Andolan organised a national convention
post Babri masjid demolition in Delhi. One of the groups that participated
was the NBA, and at least some of the people who came from there were very
distressed as large numbers of the kar sewaks at the Babri demolition and
the subsequent violence in Ayodhya/Faizabad were people from the Narmada
valley, and those whose lives were threatened by the dam, and displacement,
and were actively involved in the NBA. So which &quot;people&quot; and &quot;people's
struggle&quot; must one support then? Those killed by the dam and
displacement/poverty or those killed by those who were uprooted by the dam?

All I want to say is that while it assuages our bourgeois guilt by
homogenizing and valorising the subaltern, it is important to both
understand that there are many fractures within &quot;people' and &quot;their
struggles&quot;, as much as take seriously one's own - be they in the form of the
right to the freedom of speech and expression or claiming the space to
articulate one's political ideas/opinions.

dear arunima,
In the same token (as u belive MOdi is an outright criminal. i dont question
it) one who has enough knowledge and Proof (like Geedha) can comment on
sugata as well. It should be remember here that i never questioned her right
to visit Athirappally. Given the context of green politics in KErala, i
raised de question of a possiblity (in several question marks) of its hijack
by this green mafia (who pretend to raise the issues). we have seen witnesed
it in many occasions. Â as a i use to follow these issues, it s become
evident that the kind of PR game greenyouth start to play may also lead to
the same fate of many of these movements.

MOreover, the moderator has the responsibility to mention it clearly wht are
the criteria used for moderation. Perosnal whims and fancies cant be the
scale. On the same token used to moderate me, murali, salim, dilleep raj,
who used &quot;hate&quot; in theri emails should have been 'moderated'. Instead of
addressing my objection, the moderator resort to un-democratic green politcs
(what more one expect from these people?)

and regarding MOdi and Sugata: A criminal is a criminal, even if s/he be CM
or Poet?
sugata is not just accused of being &quot;romantic&quot;,
as someone argued in this list, free investigations will put criminals of
all sorts in prison.
though, in personal discussion or in these kinds of lists people &quot;taken for
grantedly' blaim MOdi ( i also do it) is there proof to prove his involvment
in any crime? Allegations against his govt. dont make MOdi a criminal, if we
apply same sugata-dilip logic.(thoguh i dont subscribe to this arguemnt)

so, if people like dilip raj think that killings of Dalits in Khailranji and
tsunduru (AP) was POSITIVE just bz it invited lots of debate, I must say
that such ALLIANCE-INFECTED PEOPLE are the curse of any movement in
india.(kerla being the worst)

Ranjith!
You are again trivializing my standpoint . [ in 'polemics' is it the rule
than exception?]
Well, I accept the curse. Let me be not the blessing of any movement.

The question is, how do you go about resisting those atrocities?[ not
whether that will
trigger discussions] Â Will you try to bring as many people coming against it
together and do the maximum possible or sit on making judgments on each and
every person?
This is a practical problem faced by any such movement [ Kerala being not an
exception]

I personally see the present campaign in Chithralekha issue following the
same dynamics. I
appreciate the action committee which brought even Ajitha under its
umbrella. Who is
ALLIANCE - INFLECTED PEOPLE in that instance? Do you mmeant this experience
while cursing Kerala as the worst case? Will it be purged of evil forces if
'people like me' are
kept at a distance?

hi dileep,
see i ve my own reservations regarding the kind of efforts such alliances
bring. (hope it may be different in the reffered case)..
frankly, i dont belive in such &quot;civil&quot; society initiatives any more. Â but
dont discourage any such attempt.
My politics is different. Perhaps, I dont want to make our moderator worry
more by talking abt it here. After all, Kerla the space where all this
happens has an inherent tendency to brand, moderate and block the politcs, I
position myself.

regarding polemics: Anivar was talking abt RSS using it. Arundhati and Medha
Patkar also use it quite well.
any one involved in public action has to resort to some kind of
polemics ( for good or bad)
and i belief that effective use of polemics is importnt
one d master it, even to counter one....
people hesitate to admit it, but use only polemics (their so calld
sophistcation itself is a polemic)

i ve used ur own logic of moralism to argue here which u r countering by
calling it polemics
so in effect it points towards u dear
keep thinking

&gt; &gt; &gt; strenuous arguments to the contrary there is a strong whiff of that in all
&gt; &gt; &gt; these exchanges - I just wished to share an anecdote from 1993 when some of
&gt; &gt; &gt; us, as part of the Sampradayikta Virodhi Andolan organised a national
&gt; &gt; &gt; convention post Babri masjid demolition in Delhi. One of the groups that
&gt; &gt; &gt; participated was the NBA, and at least some of the people who came from
&gt; &gt; &gt; there were very distressed as large numbers of the kar sewaks at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Babri demolition and the subsequent violence in Ayodhya/Faizabad were people
&gt; &gt; &gt; from the Narmada valley, and those whose lives were threatened by the dam,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and displacement, and were actively involved in the NBA. So which &quot;people&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; and &quot;people's struggle&quot; must one support then? Those killed by the dam and
&gt; &gt; &gt; displacement/poverty or those killed by those who were uprooted by the dam?

&gt; &gt; &gt; All I want to say is that while it assuages our bourgeois guilt by
&gt; &gt; &gt; homogenizing and valorising the subaltern, it is important to both
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand that there are many fractures within &quot;people' and &quot;their
&gt; &gt; &gt; struggles&quot;, as much as take seriously one's own - be they in the form of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; right to the freedom of speech and expression or claiming the space to
&gt; &gt; &gt; articulate one's political ideas/opinions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these self proclaimd activists can call anyone a &quot;criminal&quot; without
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any proof;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and they r not moderated.....
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if this is the kind of trnsparncy and democracy practised how can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these people lead people's movements?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this whole fracas has exposed greenyouth and its self -proclaimed
