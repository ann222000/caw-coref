Are eggs a political issue?

Eggs cause animal agony, human disease, harm to mother earth, energy
waste

They involve lack of safety for workers, child labor,
human disease, energy waste, environmental destruction,
low food yield.

. Each egg represents 32 hours of chicken
jail,
. 300 mg of heart attack and stroke engenderingcholesterol,
Eggs cause a hefty percentage
of the fatal food poisonings annually, 97% of which are caused by
meat fish eggs or dairy.Their presence in vaccine
development has killed many.
Each is
. 120 hours of production water,
. a system of agriculture less than 1/100th
as productive per acre as nut trees
or sunflower fields.

Around the world there are untold
tens of thousands of factory farms.
In the US, From Utah,
Arkansas and Missouri to Maine, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia
factory farms have killed hundreds of millions of birds through
power outages which caused the captives to freeze to death in the
winter or bake in metal sheds reaching 140 degrees or more in the
summer.

Chickens have been crammed in to cages 1 ft by 3 ft, sometimes
9 birds to a cage. They are debeaked so that they will not peck each
other from the overcrowding.

An Ohio EPA worker nearly died sinking up to her neck in
the chicken waste of Ohio &quot;Fresh Egg&quot;
which has also been sued for selling
old eggs, for hiring children workers,
for filling the streams of Ohio with
salmonella and insecticides.

Fertilized eggs have caused skillets
to be full of blood, beak, and claws.

A German factory farm owner banned
there for having nearly killed
a worker with nicotinic insecticides
and for animal cruelty was invited
to Ohio by George Voinovich.

A tornado caused 1 million birds to
be killed at the Voinovich egg farm
which was called Buckeye and then
Agrigeneral and now Ohio &quot;Fresh Egg&quot;.
Some birds were still alive after
9 days without food or water, the
half of them with no feathers in
the 30 degree temperature. The
company finally bulldozed the remaining
live chickens alive into graves.
(During Desert Storm's
Highway of Death, the 250,000 victims
were dead before being bulldozed.)

Senators Feingold Grassley and Harkin introduced
a bill to classify baby chick males
as unprotected commercial mail.

One can see the flimsy bird cartons on USPS
docks, cardboard which can be easily smashed,
the little ones frequently dying of thirst, hunger,
heat or cold, abandoned often.

Because there is so much chicken waste in factory farms,
there are billions of flies generated. Flies are nature's
waste removers.
