The robbins returned to Central Pennsylvania yesterday, and I'm so glad!
Seeing the first robins of spring really lifts my spirits and makes me feel
like the worst of winter is over.

Does anyone have a special harbinger of spring that they really look forward
to?

ACK!!!  Can't believe I spelled "robins" wrong!

Although I wouldn't mind seeing Tim Robbins outside my window!  LOL

Now I take generic Claritin all year long anyway, so the spring allergy
thing doesn't bother me anymore like it used to.

Down here it's orange/lemon/lime blossoms.  They smell wonderful.

The scrub jays yelling at each other in my backyard.  I thought I heard
one a few days ago, but that seems to have been an isolated incident.  I
haven't heard any since, but once I do I'll hear them every day until
it's time to fly the coop once again.

Dogwood trees in full bloom :)

Because it is so hot in the south, they grow best in the shadow of taller
trees, so when you look out your window and see low-lying white flowers
throughout the woods behind your house, what you see is "southern spring
snow"  :)

Yes. We live for Easter, when the snowbirds pack up their crap and head
back north (about 30 mph below the speed limit in the fast lane, and
with a turn signal going the whole way).

Since Margie's made it all about expectations, I figured I shouldn't
disappoint, either. &lt;G&gt;

I went to take my walk today and had to come back in and change out my
sweater for a T-shirt it was so warm. Then I took my little mare for a
ride for first time in some time. It could snow again any minute, and I
won't expect to see leaves for another two months, though.

I miss the change of seasons - living on The Big Island it's always
same, same, same.  We have birds all year round - which is great - and
flowers all year round - which is wonderful and aromatic - but I used
to enjoy walking all over during autumn and then love to cuddle up in
front of the fires at night during winter...and then start the slow
thaw to spring....

In steps, every year:

1.  We start seeing robins (TONS of them this year, just flocks).
2.  The phoebes come back to nest under the porch.
3.  The redbuds bloom.
4.  The ornamental pears bloom.
5.  The daffodils bloom - only they were #2 this year.

Every year. I love the springtime where I live.

hair from the winter. They sweated like mad.

I brushed and brushed and brushed and brushed.  I probably had enough horse

looking at a smaller horse for him.  He starts lessons Friday.  He must do
that and stick with it before I buy him his own horse.  I've waited 35

Oh, Jeannie! Way to go! I never saw your post, just what BambiC put in
hers. Girl, girl. You can get some good advice right here on smt.

Forget the brush. Get one of those nipple gloves. They are wonderful.
And get a shedding blade, the kind that is a sweat scraper on one side
and has little teeth on the other.

Always wash and cool him when you finish riding, but not too much cold
water yet. It still gets cool outside at night and they never need to
go to bed wet. Are you going to take lessons too?

How many of us horsey folk are here? Several, I think.

I'd be jealous but I'm glad I don't have a horse!

I want pictures!

Well, it's a dream that might come true.  LOL.  I am doing my darndest to
make sure we save enough building this new house and make enough with the
sale of the house we are in to pay off ALL BILLS (including husband's 1yo
truck), buy me a new car outright and still have enough to buy me a horse.
The horse cost isn't exactly what I am worried about, but the cost to board
every month.  If we can get enough to pay the facility in advance for at
least a year and still not have any payment other than house payment I wont
be too worried.  I just don't want a lot of monthly obligations going into
a new house (even though the payment will be cheaper or lower than it is in
this one with different interest rates).  I am just getting closer and
closer to having nothing but a house payment and school tuition and regular
costs of living and I am worrying about adding something else into the mix
- boarding two horses could add up quickly!  I am still figuring we will be
able to swing it and I used to NEVER worry like I am now about monthly
obligations.  Considering what we used to have, the house payment should be
easy as pie to swing with two horses and even a car payment in the mix but
the closer we get to being monthly-obligation free the more I am liking it.

I used to ride every day and then rode all the time until I was about 20.
Now in the past 15 years I've probably only ridden a handful of times.  I
am going to take lessons just to refresh myself and to get my strength and
courage back.  I used to be fearless on a horse and really wanted to get
into barrel racing.  The owner of the stable said she would work with me on
lessons and put me on different horses to get a feel for what I should buy.
She said she'd even go to look at horses with me and would trailer one I
bought to their stable for me.  I am really excited about it.  I am more
excited that my little one has his first lesson tomorrow.  He is so excited
he can hardly wait.  He couldn't sleep at all last night - I wonder how bad
tonight will be?!?!?

That's what they say, the purchase price of your horse is the least of your
expenses!  I'm thinking about adopting a retired standardbred.  There are so
many good ones out there that need homes.

I'll probably keep my future horse at home.  I have the acreage, but need to
put up fences.

I don't know what horse board is like down there, but I'd bet you can
get decent price for pasture board with runins. Don't likely need full
barn/stall in that climate. Up here many of the barns are getting 500 a
month or more and that's with very little decent turnout. Horses do much
better when they are allowed to come and go as they wish, and it is much
better for them to be able to graze ad lib. I know down in VA I see very
reasonable prices.

The place I found is incredibly reasonalbe and I honestly don't know how
she does it.  I believe it is 175/mo for pasture and 205 for stall.  They
do let the horses in and out of the stalls into pasture and they do allow
you to stall your horse if it becomes sick or injured for 5 bucks a day or
something like that.  It is incredibly reasonable considering the place I
had previously looked was 375 for pasture and 4 something for stall.
Still, when I double that or even consider tripling if DH wants a horse
that is still 600 per month. We are just getting so close to having no
monthly obligation other than house payment.  LOL.

Of course, I brainstormed a few minutes ago.  I do have a LOT of Jim Booth
signed and numbered prints that are sold out and worht a good bit of money.
I could sell three of them, buy the horse I want and the one I want for my
son and still pay for board for a year.

That's pretty much true! A free horse could be very expensive if it is
being given away because it has a lot of problems. Anyone is well
advised to get a vet check prepurchase, though that probably isn't as
important for a horse that isn't being used for competition, jumping,
etc. Vets can be expensive. Hoof care can be very expensive. If you
can, find a horse that is barefoot with healthy feet. That alone will
save a small fortune. Shoes on all fours have to be reset every 6 or so
weeks, and that cost varies widely depending on where you are. My horses
are both barefoot and need trims about every 8 weeks during most of the
year (winter they can go longer as feet do not grow out as fast), which
costs me 60 bucks for both horses. Shoes on both of them would probably
be a couple of hundred total each time.

I know the farrier comes to the stables about every 4-6 weeks (IIRC) and it
runs 30 bucks per horse. I didn't see that any of the horses out had shoes.

I don't suppose they sell citrus trees at the local nurseries if you're

Yep, I had to run the A/C.  It is 67 now, which for March is a little warm.
LOL  Just a little over a week ago, it was not above 30.

Very strange weather, but I don't think it will be but another day of it.  I

My sister has two horses - maybe three now - that she boards at a place
that gives her a big break for feeding everybody when she goes to feed
hers. Now that the kids are older she gets an even bigger break (may be
free now) because they can muck out where needed and/or exercise other
horses while she feeds...and talks story. My BIL has also done a lot of
electrical work work and handyman work for them. Barter is a GOOD

That's what I was thinking!  I could feed in certain days, let the stall
horses out to pasture, put them back in stall, etc.  My husband is a

You guys would never believe the sheer number of dollars that have gone
from my pocketbook into the horse business. I often wonder why I'm poor
after making good money for all these years and it's horses, believe me.

When Robin was in her heyday, there were several - or MANY - times that
my bill at the end of the month was well over $1000. It was brutal, I
tell you.

I wouldn't ask for a dime of it back, either. It was money well spent.

Hell, if I get really poor I can always go groom for somebody. Lord
knows I know how to keep a horse, or a barn FULL of them!
