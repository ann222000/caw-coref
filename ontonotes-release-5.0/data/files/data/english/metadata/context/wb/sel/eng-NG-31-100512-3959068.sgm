I just had an oil change at 67,500 miles on my 2000 Odyssey and the
dealership used Castrol Syntec Blend oil which claims it is part synthetic.
Has anyone had any experience with this oil and is it ok to use after using
regular oil for 6 years?

Shouldn't be a problem at all.   I am running Syntec blend 5w-20 in my 04
Accord, although this has low miles yet.   I wouldn't worry about it, Syntec
blend is a good compromise between synthetic and standard oils.  I also
switched a vehicle over to full synthetic with high miles without a problem.

I recently changed two of our 200K+ mile cars (one is an '85) over to full
synthetic and had no leaks or other problems.

I've been using Mobil 1 5w30 in my 2000 Civic SiR for 50,000km now.  It
doesn't leak a single drop.

you also get a higher milage per oil change.
Syntec or syntec blend oil retains its lubricating and protective
chracteristics 3-4 times longer than regular one.
I've been using semi-syntec Castrol  for the last 5 years with with 15-20 k
changing period. Never had any problems.

Thank you for all your replies. I was wondering why the windshield sticker
said "next oil change 15,000 miles."

2 things, going longer then normal between oil changes just cause your using
synthetic is NOT a good idea

To qualify as "synthetic blend" all you need to do is put SOME synthetic oil
in it.  So technically it could be plain oil with 1 drop of synthetic oil
added.

If you want synthetic, then get 100% synthetic oil

Yes, I plan on changing the oil at regular intervals. This car cost $26,400
new, is paid off and hopefully will last quite a few more years. I don't
know what the record for miles on an Odyssey is, but I hope to break it.

I don't know about an odyssey, but my neighbour has a 86 accord with over
500, 000KM on it, and still going strong

WHAT?!  They put a sticker on a windshield suggesting an oil change
interval of 15,000 miles?!  That is stupid and I don't care what kind of
oil it is.  Generally speaking, under normal driving conditions, you can
expect dino oil to go 5,000, maybe a little longer.

Semi-synthetics start to deplete their pack (TBN) around 7500 miles and
although some synthetics say they can go higher, I have seen used oil
analysis reports suggesting synthetics should be changed at no more than
10,000 miles.  With severe driving conditions (heavy towing, cold
start/short trip driving, dusty conditions, etc.), these figures would
be much less.

Going 15,000 miles on this oil is a recipe for disaster.  I don't doubt
it can be done since you will rejuvenate the oil by several top-offs
during this period but at what cost to the engine?  If it were me, I
would change this oil after 5,000 miles, send in for an oil analysis
report (about $40) to Amsoil, Blackstone or some other well established
lab, and look at the results.  I bet you will never see a professional
lab analysis recommending this oil to 15,000 mile intervals.

It is an excellent quality oil and can mix and match with conventional
oils without fear.
