I'm planning on finishing DD's Christmas WUH. It's about 3' X 5'. I'd like
to put some shiny 'beads, baubles, stones' on it. I need advice on HOW TO. I
know there is a 'heat gun' that you put sparklies on with but I don't know
what I'm talking about. Do any of you have one? How does it work? is it
WORTH IT for ONE project?
If not, how would you put them on? I have a few baubles that I can 'sew' on
but I'd prefer to glue on as it's easier for me.
Would you quilt it first? What is the BEST batting to use for this? IF I
start now I should be able to finish by Christmas.

No experience with this, but definitely quilt it before you start attaching
hard lumpy objects that will obstruct your presser foot! I've put together a
lot of friendship quilts, some of them with free-style blocks, and some of
them simply could not be quilted.

I have the &quot;Glitzer&quot; and have used it many times--on quilts, WUHs, T-shirts,
etc. It is easy to use and I just got an e-mail from OESD (Machine

Definitely  quilt first.  I've done a lot with the heat set crystals.  I
have the tool for setting them. but if you're very careful, they can be set
with the tip of an iron.  What colors do you plan to use?

Okay- I'm a newbie at this- it says:

Marie Signature Edition Glitzer Wand (Glitzer only)  XXEZG-M   Each glitzer
comes with a 4 mm wand tip Make great second glitzers or classroom tools!

Do you need additional tips?  The pic shows several tips- I *think* that's
what those are???  They don't seem to come with that glitzer???  Help!

There is a special adhesive made specifically for attaching beads,
baubles and other treasures to fabric.  You should be able to find it at
Joanns or Michael's, etc.  I'm sure it would be a lot less $$ than
buying some sort of tool.  OH -- the stuff is washable &amp; dry cleanable,
too :-).  CiaoMeow &gt;^;;^&lt;

Found on the www.homesew.com website-

Unique Stitch
$2.95
GU87
Old Sku: N87
The perfect glue for today's wearable crafts  it's sewing with a tube! Fast
drying glue bonds fabric to fabric, as well as rhinestones, beads, sequins,
etc. Dries transparent and is washable. Great for bridal. 1-1/4 fl. oz.
tube.

Gem-Tac
$6.15
GU539
Old Sku: N539
Sewers, crafters and quilters will love this glue, because it is washable
and flexible, and dries fast and clear. It permanently bonds smooth to
porous surfaces, so it will glue rhinestones, crystals, gems, glitter, wire,
trims, plastics to fabric, quilts, clothing, wood vinyl or glass projects.
Easy clean-up and non-toxic. 2 fl. oz.

HTH

Here I am.  Had to go enter the downtown hardware store's beauty contest.
Won again.
The heat-set stone setter I have is called:  BeJeweler Stone Styler.  It
came from just plain old Michael's or Hobby Lobby.  It has 8 tips.  I have
no idea why.  Never got them out to play with.  It also came with a support
stand that is just as rinky-dink as the support stand that comes with the
cute little Clover iron.
You'll want a safe place to put the stone setter down.  I wasn't feeling
creative so I just put my cast iron skillet close by.  Not cute but it
worked great; those setters get HOT.
The most important thing you need to know.  You can really mess up and
buy the wrong jewels.  You want the kind that are clearly marked 'Heat Set'.
If you get the wrong ones, you'll have to use super-glue, wind up with your
fingers glued Lord knows where and have to go to the Emergency Room.
Playing with the BeJeweler is big fun, adds heaps of bling and can get a
little bit pricey if you get going in a big way.  When that happens you can
buy jewels online at much better prices than at a local store.  Have fun.

Hi there Butterfly. &lt;G&gt;  Adding glitz can be done a number of ways. I
have a tool to set hot-fix rhinestones, but they can also be done,
carefully, with an iron. Sewing does work, but usually has to be done by
hand. Glue is another option.. some are designed just for setting
'jewels' onto fabric, or you can use some coordinating dimensional
fabric paint as a glue + accent type of thing.  I have set fake stones
into the fabric paint, which leaves a bit of a &quot;bezel&quot; of the fabric
paint around the stone, if done in a nice metallic or sparkly paint it
can look quite nice. &lt;G&gt;
Let me know if you need some help here.  I could manage to get over and
let you use/help you use my setting tool if you would like.

I would quilt first, then embellish, that way you don't have to worry
about the embellishments getting hit by the needle, or causing problems
with rolling the quilt on a frame, etc. &lt;BG&gt; That is what I did with the
crystals on my Denim and Diamonds quilt.

Seeing as how I don't know anything about this item, I have no idea what all
it entails other than its suppose to 'set' glitzes (rhinestones? ) onto
fabric without having to sew it.
Now that I have a name from Donna, I'll search it out and find out what its
all about

Now THIS sounds 'safer' for me all around. I was a bit worried about the
'hot tip' on the other--I don't even have one of those lil patchwork seam
irons cause I drop stuff often...not as often as I use to...but I still do.
Thanks, I KNEW this place would give me the right answers and steer me in
the right direction..

Read the 'ad' on the site..it just sounds a bit too dangerous for my hands
and my safety. About the only thing I dare handle is the hot Glue gun--and
that only when someone is home..and no not on beads.

For just one project I would just use glue.  Much cheaper than buying
a fancy tool that will only apply special baubles made for use with
the tool.  It does hold up over time too.  Twenty odd years ago
Grandma made a stiffened wall hanging of a Christmas tree made of
jewelry stones, beads, and findings glued onto a velvet background.
She used plain Elmer's white glue to glue on the baubles and it is
still intact.  BTW, she used cardboard to stiffen the WH.

You could also use hot glue, but it would be a messy process and the
glue might melt if the project is stored in an attic or other hot
area, leaving you with an ugly blob when you found it next year.

Debra, the ends are shaped/sized to &quot;hold&quot; different crystals/studs that
have a hot melt glue on them. They are used to apply these crystals to
fabric, to add glitz.  Lots of fun for wall hangings and artsy type
quilts, but not too cuddly. &lt;VBG&gt;
And yes, they are very much like a soldering iron/woodburning tool.

I was in WalMart this afternoon and bought some &quot;iron-on&quot; rhinestones.  You
set them in place and use a hot iron to set them.  Okay for a wallhanging,
but not very washable according to the package.  Another thought for your

Will email you once I get this quilted:)
I won't be buying the glitzer with your offer as it would only have been for
this one project.

Looks like I have a bit more homework to do before I put anything on the
front. Have tried the 'puffy' glue and another type of glue on a  vest years
ago. Every year I find a few more 'vacant' spots where things have fallen
off.

&gt; Hi there Butterfly. &lt;G&gt;  Adding glitz can be done a number of ways. I have
&gt; a tool to set hot-fix rhinestones, but they can also be done, carefully,
&gt; with an iron. Sewing does work, but usually has to be done by hand. Glue
&gt; is another option.. some are designed just for setting 'jewels' onto
&gt; fabric, or you can use some coordinating dimensional fabric paint as a
&gt; glue + accent type of thing.  I have set fake stones into the fabric
&gt; paint, which leaves a bit of a &quot;bezel&quot; of the fabric paint around the
&gt; stone, if done in a nice metallic or sparkly paint it can look quite nice.
&gt; &lt;G&gt;
&gt; Let me know if you need some help here.  I could manage to get over and
&gt; let you use/help you use my setting tool if you would like.

&gt; I would quilt first, then embellish, that way you don't have to worry
&gt; about the embellishments getting hit by the needle, or causing problems
&gt; with rolling the quilt on a frame, etc. &lt;BG&gt; That is what I did with the
&gt; crystals on my Denim and Diamonds quilt.

&gt;&gt; I'm planning on finishing DD's Christmas WUH. It's about 3' X 5'. I'd

&gt;&gt; HOW TO. I know there is a 'heat gun' that you put sparklies on with but I
&gt;&gt; don't know what I'm talking about. Do any of you have one? How does it
&gt;&gt; work? is it WORTH IT for ONE project?
&gt;&gt; If not, how would you put them on? I have a few baubles that I can 'sew'
&gt;&gt; on but I'd prefer to glue on as it's easier for me.
&gt;&gt; Would you quilt it first? What is the BEST batting to use for this? IF I
&gt;&gt; start now I should be able to finish by Christmas.

&gt; Unique Stitch
&gt; $2.95
&gt; GU87
&gt; Old Sku: N87
&gt; The perfect glue for today's wearable crafts  it's sewing with a tube! Fast
&gt; drying glue bonds fabric to fabric, as well as rhinestones, beads, sequins,
&gt; etc. Dries transparent and is washable. Great for bridal. 1-1/4 fl. oz.
&gt; tube.

&gt; Gem-Tac
&gt; $6.15
&gt; GU539
&gt; Old Sku: N539
&gt; Sewers, crafters and quilters will love this glue, because it is washable
&gt; and flexible, and dries fast and clear. It permanently bonds smooth to
&gt; porous surfaces, so it will glue rhinestones, crystals, gems, glitter, wire,
&gt; trims, plastics to fabric, quilts, clothing, wood vinyl or glass projects.
&gt; Easy clean-up and non-toxic. 2 fl. oz.

I have both of these and have used them both.  I prefer the Gem-Tac
for setting larger things like rhinestones, metallic studs, etc.  The
Unique Stitch is good for smaller things like seed beads, sequins, bugle
beads, etc. but just didn't seem to do quite as good a job with the
chunkier stuff.  Of course that's just IMHO so YMMV.
Butterflywings -- whatever you decide on, keep us posted.  Since you
are doing a WUH *and* this is basically a one shot deal for you, the
less expensive Unique Stitch might work just fine on the chunkier stuff.
I was working with clothing that would be worn &amp; laundered much more
often than a Christmas WUH!   Also, if you haven't ordered from Home
Sew, they are a great company.  I order &quot;gorpy&quot; stuff (mostly
fancy-schmancy trims, lace, buttons, etc.) from them all the time and
get great service.
OH YES -- for sure you MUST quilt before adding the &quot;good stuff&quot;.
Most of the HUG Quilts I have done have had either 3D blocks or ones
with buttons and other treasures on them and it's certainly a challenge
to quilt around this stuff :-).  CiaoMeow &gt;^;;^&lt;

Polly, I wonder if the silver backed 'jewels' were applied with that rubbery
glue would the glue protect them from humidity?  It's very humid here in MO

Actually, I was thinking about the ones that are wee little tubes, not the
ones that are silver backed.  The backed ones have stayed pretty very well.
The ones that have silvery innards are the ones you have to avoid.  Polly

Wow! We have a 'tree' like that too. It was made by
DH's lovely GM, (or maybe a friend of her) about 35-40
years ago. The background is red felt, and the frame is
white and gold. A pearly necklace swirls through the
triangular tree shape, so it represents a garland.
There are small holes in the 'tree' so we can insert
mini lights if we put it on a table top easel. Usually
we omit the lights and hang this flat on the wall. Some
of the odd bits of costume jewelry is really cool, but
it is a tad gaudy. It is soooo 60s ... and we love it!

This one is a 3' X 5' panel. Old fashioned tree with 'candles' where I'll
put the diodes, has one 'strand of beads that I'll put large round beads on
to cover them, then I'll just decorate. Went to our LQS today and was the
ONLY customer....really nice....it's their annual Sale this weekend. It's a
small store so she didn't have any billing.

My Grandma's jewelry tree shape is a little more fancy than a
triangle, but yes it is very 60ish.  Hers doesn't have holes for
lights, but what it lacks in lights it surely makes up for in
gaudiness.  The background is red velvet, the outline of the tree is
metallic gold rick rack (Grandma loved rick rack.  Mom and I hate the
stuff.) , a &quot;pearl&quot; necklace (probably from the 5 &amp; Dime) is the
garland, and the star at the top was a rhinestone brooch with a broken
clasp.   Every possible &quot;jewel&quot; was used on it; old earrings, charms
from bracelets, semi-precious stones, necklace pendants, Scarabs, and
Moonstones. As a child I looked at it for hours, delighting in all
that shiny stuff, especially the faceted crystal beads with that fancy
opalescent finish.  I haven't seen it used in quite some time, but it
is still in her attic.  Nice memory.
