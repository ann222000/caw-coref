So, why not give Nancy Pelosi a SMALLER AIR FORCE JET that can fly coast to
coast WITHOUT REFUELING.

After all, this San Francisco Democrat needs to be far more conscious of the
Environmental Impact.  &lt;g&gt;

She doesn't need a 42-seat Air-Force jet in order to carry her family, large
entourage and political supporters -- in this "Flying Lincoln's Bedroom".

The previous Speaker did just fine with a a 12-SEAT JET.

Stand by for more Fun &amp; Games.

Madam Nancy Pelosi -- The Imperial Speaker?

Hilarious!

Pelosi defends request for jet
By Rowan Scarborough and Charles Hurt

THE WASHINGTON TIMES
Published February 8, 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi yesterday defended her bid for a large U.S. Air
Force jet to take her home and back to Washington nonstop -- and the White
House backed her up.

Mrs. Pelosi suggested that former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
may be involved in leaking information about her request.

Interesting.  -- DSH

"It still raises the question, why would the Department of Defense not
be denying this information that has been conveyed?" the California Democrat
told reporters. "Why are they feeding the flames? Of course I have been a
constant critic -- for nearly three years, I've called for the resignation
of Donald Rumsfeld, who still has a desk at the Department of Defense, and I
guess any chance they have "

Larry Di Rita, Mr. Rumsfeld's spokesman while defense secretary,
responded, "Secretary Rumsfeld's priorities while in office did not allow
for time to get too involved in member travel issues, and I doubt that has
changed since he left."

As her office pressed the Pentagon for a large plane, and a staunch
ally, Rep. John P. Murtha, Pennsylvania Democrat, called defense officials
on her behalf, Mrs. Pelosi said she does not particularly want a military
jet and would be happy to fly commercially.

"I don't even like having the security," Mrs. Pelosi said. "I would
rather travel on the plane with my friends to get some work done. I like my
freedom, but there are certain sacrifices you have to make when you are
speaker of the House."

The Pentagon told Mrs. Pelosi in a letter on Wednesday that it cannot
guarantee her a plane capable of flying to California nonstop -- as she
requested.

White House press secretary Tony Snow defended Mrs. Pelosi against
Republican criticism and labeled as "silly" press coverage of her request
for a plane and the flexibility of transporting aides, lawmakers and family
members. President Bush has reached out to Mrs. Pelosi in a bid to reach
agreement on major legislation, such as immigration reform.

The Washington Times first reported last week on Mrs. Pelosi's request,
saying she wanted a larger plane and more passengers than afforded her
predecessor, Rep. J. Dennis Hastert, Illinois Republican. The Air Force
allotted Mr. Hastert a small, 12-seat commuter jet to ferry him to his
Illinois district.

Mrs. Pelosi said, "I'm not saying that I am being discriminated against
because I am a woman, I'm just saying as the first woman speaker, I have no
intention of having less respect for the office I hold than all of the other
speakers that have come before me."

At the White House, Mr. Snow said, "This is a silly story, and I think
it's been unfair to the speaker."

Mr. Snow's defense put him at odds with the Republican Party, and also
Republicans on Capitol Hill who have blasted Mrs. Pelosi for demanding a
perk reserved for the president and vice president and a few Cabinet
members.

Mrs. Pelosi also asked the Air Force to fly her and her colleagues to a
Democratic Party retreat in Williamsburg, where Mr. Bush appeared. The Air
Force declined the request, saying it was not allowed under Defense
Department directives.

Hmmmmmmmm... -- DSH

Mrs. Pelosi stayed quiet after The Times first reported the story. But
by Tuesday, the criticism grew intense and she began making TV appearances
to defend her request.

Asked later in the day if the White House differed with its own party,
Mr. Snow said:

"And I'll just repeat our position, which is as speaker of the House,
she is entitled to military transport and that the proper arrangements
are being made between the sergeant of arms office in the House of
Representatives and the U.S. Department of Defense. We think it's
appropriate, and so I -- again, I think this is much ado about not a whole
lot. It is important for the speaker to have this kind of protection and
travel. It was certainly appropriate for Speaker Hastert. And so we trust
that all sides will get this worked out."

Republicans did not see it that way.

Members quickly drafted an amendment to an environmental bill on the
House floor, forcing Democrats to debate Mrs. Pelosi and military planes for
two hours.

"The Congress also finds that in order to lessen United States
dependence on foreign sources of petroleum, and decrease demand for
petroleum in aircraft, such as passenger planes with 42 business-class seats
capable of transcontinental flights, the nation must diversify its fuel
supply for aircraft to include domestically produced alternative fuels,"
says the amendment, a clear reference to the large jet requested by Mrs.
Pelosi's office.

The Washington Times reported yesterday that the Defense Department sent
a letter to Mrs. Pelosi that limits her choice of aircraft to commuter-sized
planes that would have to be refueled. The letter said the Pentagon could
not guarantee access to larger jets, and it stated rules for carrying family
members and lawmakers.

The 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force base operates three jets that
can make the nonstop flight year-round: the C-32 (Boeing 757); a C-40
(Boeing 737) and the C-20, a Gulfstream jet.

Mr. Murtha is playing hardball.

"I don't need to pressure them," he told reporters, when asked about his
calls to the Pentagon. "I just tell them what they need to do."

Mr. Murtha warned the Pentagon against leaking information that makes
Mrs. Pelosi look bad.

"They're making a mistake when they leak it because she decides on
allocations for them," he said, referring to the Pentagon budget.  ******

Hmmmmmm... An OUTRIGHT THREAT FROM JOHN MURTHA -- THE CUT &amp; RUNNER. -- DSH

Rep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, responded:

"It is irresponsible and reckless for Congressman Murtha to use funding
needed for the protection of our country and for our men and women in
uniform as leverage in order for Nancy Pelosi to travel from coast to coast
like a movie star. We are a country at war, and I think it is time for the
Democrat majority to get their priorities straight."

BINGO! -- DSH

In a statement yesterday, House Sergeant at Arms Wilson Livingood
assumed responsibility for the decision to request a larger plane for Mrs.
Pelosi.

"The fact that Speaker Pelosi lives in California compelled me to
request an aircraft that is capable of making nonstop flights for security
reasons, unless such an aircraft is unavailable," he said. "Such an aircraft
will ensure communications capabilities and also enhance security."

He also said he regrets "that an issue that is exclusively considered
and decided in a security context has evolved into a political issue."

More likely her staff doesn't recognize the difference between a C-20
(a Gulfstream III or IV, which is what Hastert used) and a C-37 (a
Gulfstream V).

You know, it would be fantastic if this was really the only thing that
mattered in this country.  The sad thing is, it's nothing.  Who gives a f#$%
what plane she flies in?  She's the speaker of the House!  I don't agree
with her on any political issue, but, the American Public voted her party
into power........we've (America) got more important things to deal
with.........

Do you have any comprehension of what you're talking about, other than the
fact that you didn't even read the article you quoted?

Nancy Pelosi is #2 in line of succession to the US presidency after the
Veep. That makes her important. Also - and this point escaped you, she lives
on the opposite coast, unlike the former speaker, and may therefore require
a different ac that can accommodate the different requirements

For the record, I don't much like Democrats, and I don't like Pelosi - but
you are simply an imbecile.

No, the issue is she wants a large jet to transport her entourage at
government expense. What she is entitled to is transportation for
herself and maybe some of her staff. Anybody else travelling with her
is required to pay for the trip.
And what trips she is allowed to take are limited as well. A flight from
DC to Williamsburg for a Dhimmicreep retreat would not a permitted usage
for instance.
The military has a number of Grumman Gulstream V aircraft capable
of making a non-stop flight Andrews to SFO. They do not have the 42
luxury seats the 757 variant has though and that seems to be the issue.

I'm quite familiar with DSH, unfortunately, as he - for some inexplicable
reason - has chosen also to infest sci.military.naval. Most of the time I
have ignored his posts entirely; occasionally I read them and then dismiss
them. But this one was the straw...I can't even put my finger exactly on
why, since pogue Hines' post was no more nor no less inane than many he has
written before.

The aircraft allotted to the US Speaker of the House is a serious enough
issue, and on the right NG's is worthy of a thread or two. I think it was
something about the more than over-the-top smarminess and cozy rectitude of
DSH's inline comments in his post that finally cranked my irritation up.

"Pogue" is US military slang used by Infantry or other combat troops to
refer to support or service personnel who seemingly have an easier and
safer job.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogue

pogue

noun
Definition:

1. an offensive term for somebody regarded as a coward or sissy
2. an offensive term for a member of the armed forces employed in a rear
echelon support capacity

I am sure that Mr. Hines is expressing the feeling a real combat veteran
had for those in support roles.  I am sure that your military service
time spent "shoveling shit in Alabama" or other rear echelon jobs  pales
in comparison to his brilliant combat record and he is simply putting
you in your place.  I am therefore delighted to be "classed" with you,
and not in his class.

However I ignore the insults and comments of Mr. Hines. I neither
understand or accept his need to be abusive to other posters. Perhaps he
has a chest full of combat medals and a shelf full of his learned
publications. Im sure his athletic trophies fill a cabinet.  Why a
person of  accomplishment would stoop to the kind of personal insults
he uses amazes me. He seems to admire the Queen, who would never ever
use such language.

Normally such insults come only from those who have accomplished
nothing with their lives  and stand with nose pressed to the window
stamping their feet in rage.  People of accomplishment and culture
should be above such things.

BTW did you see that the Osprey is grounded again?  I keep hoping Cheney
uses it exclusively as his executive transport.  after all it flies
twice as fast and twice as far etc.

Disgustingly Hilarious!

Pogue Brannigan seemingly believes that if Dick Cheney were killed in a
helicopter crash, which Pogue Brannigan invites in his DEATH WISH against
the Vice President supra, that Nancy Pelosi would be next in line for the
Presidency and the Democrats could then safely impeach and try to convict
George Bush and remove him from office -- allegedly thereby making Speaker
of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, the San Francisco Democrat,
whose Left-Wing, Pacifist, Appeasement-Oriented, Defeatist, Statist and
Pogueish Values, Pogue Brannigan dearly shares.

DEAD WRONG.

It Doesn't WORK That Way....

Pogue Brannigan needs to REREAD the Constitution of the United States and
particularly the 25th Amendment, in addition to other relevant clauses.

He should, in fact, reread and STUDY the entire Constitution -- several
times -- without his usual crutch and distraction of simultaneously
drinking, inhaling, shooting and/or smoking intoxicants.

I realize that will be VERY difficult for him to do -- without those
artificial crutches and intoxicating agents -- but he simply must apply
himself to it -- lest he continue to wallow _ad infinitum_, like a pig, in
his own feces, ignorance and sloth.

'Nuff Said.

I knew the military usage, although quite frankly in the Marines we never
used it.  Most of us were actually intelligent enough to recognize that the
rear-echelon support types were the people that supplied you with your
stuff, and in the case of getting hurt, you'd eventually be dealing with
rear-echelon support types. Not to mention, the rear-echelon support types
did your paperwork, so they were gods.

Come to think of it, I don't recall anyone ever seriously using the term
REMF either, or armchair warrior, or pencil pilot. We just recognized that
as combat MOS people we were _elevated_ above the others, and we actually
felt sorry for the others - we didn't scorn them. We naturally assumed that
any Marine unfortunate enough to have been assigned to MCLB Albany, GA was
thirsting for a chance to re-enlist as an 0311.

In that context I am delighted to be classed with you too, even though I
frequently disagree with you. At least I am not an idiot, and you don't seem
to be, and you even follow the scientific method, and understand debate. I
wasn't aware that Hines had developed the "pogue" classification based on

&gt; Disgustingly Hilarious!

&gt; Pogue Brannigan seemingly believes that if Dick Cheney were killed in a
&gt; helicopter crash, which Pogue Brannigan invites in his DEATH WISH against
&gt; the Vice President supra, that Nancy Pelosi would be next in line for the
&gt; Presidency and the Democrats could then safely impeach and try to convict
&gt; George Bush and remove him from office -- allegedly thereby making Speaker
&gt; of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, the San Francisco Democrat,
&gt; whose Left-Wing, Pacifist, Appeasement-Oriented, Defeatist, Statist and
&gt; Pogueish Values, Pogue Brannigan dearly shares.

I don't think this at all.

I would just like to have the secret service do an independent safety
review of the Osprey.  If they say its not safe enough for the VP fine.
But I certainly would not expect marines to adopt a vehicle that is not
safe.

&gt; It Doesn't WORK That Way....

&gt; Pogue Brannigan needs to REREAD the Constitution of the United States and
&gt; particularly the 25th Amendment, in addition to other relevant clauses.

&gt; He should, in fact, reread and STUDY the entire Constitution -- several
&gt; times -- without his usual crutch and distraction of simultaneously
&gt; drinking, inhaling, shooting and/or smoking intoxicants.

&gt; I realize that will be VERY difficult for him to do -- without those

&gt; himself to it -- lest he continue to wallow _ad infinitum_, like a pig, in
&gt; his own feces, ignorance and sloth.

I was brought up to be gentleman and to treat everyone politely.  I was
always taught  use the same language to people at all levels in an
organization.  I was always taught that only idiots insult those with a
gun in their hand  and only poltroons  insult those who cannot hurt them
Obviously you were brought up in a different climate.
But rest assured your insults are neither creative nor effective

&gt; noun

&gt; 1. an offensive term for somebody regarded as a coward or sissy

&gt; echelon support capacity

&gt; I am sure that Mr. Hines is expressing the feeling a real combat veteran
&gt; had for those in support roles.  I am sure that your military service time
&gt; spent &quot;shoveling shit in Alabama&quot; or other rear echelon jobs  pales in
&gt; comparison to his brilliant combat record and he is simply putting you in
&gt; your place.  I am therefore delighted to be &quot;classed&quot; with you, and not in
&gt; his class.

&gt;  However I ignore the insults and comments of Mr. Hines. I neither
&gt; understand or accept his need to be abusive to other posters. Perhaps he
&gt; has a chest full of combat medals and a shelf full of his learned
&gt; publications. Im sure his athletic trophies fill a cabinet.  Why a person
&gt; of  accomplishment would stoop to the kind of personal insults he uses
&gt; amazes me. He seems to admire the Queen, who would never ever use such
&gt; language.

&gt;  Normally such insults come only from those who have accomplished nothing
&gt; with their lives  and stand with nose pressed to the window stamping their

&gt; things.

Then she said Don Rumsfeld still has a desk at the Pentagon and implied HE
was behind this -- as a Revenge Move against her -- by leaking to the Media.

As if all that were not bad enough, she then had John Murtha, her ENFORCER,
call the Pentagon and THREATEN them by saying Nancy controls their BUDGET --
and they had better give her what she wanted or else.

She Comes Off As A Queen Bee -- Who Will NOT be Denied.

Pretty much. Consider that the Estonians have husbanded their current turf
for about 5,000 years (actual Estonian speakers, although what the language
was even 2 millennia ago, who knows), in a pretty turbulent neck of the
world. So we have gotten pretty accomplished at dealing with neighbours.
That doesn't mean that really big neighbours don't eventually get their way,
but they know they had a hard time before they succeed.

Not an Ur-Latvian, though. Simply an Ur-Estonian. Estonians and Balts
(Latvians/Lithuanians) are not linguistically, ethnically, or in any other

She also played the FEMALE CARD and implied she was being discriminated
against because she is a woman.

Then she said Don Rumsfeld still has a desk at the Pentagon and implied HE
was behind this -- as a Revenge Move against her -- by leaking to the Media.

Really, Really Stupid on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's part.

As if all that were not bad enough, she then had John Murtha, her ENFORCER,
call the Pentagon and THREATEN them by saying Nancy controls their BUDGET --
and they had better give her what she wanted or else.

She Comes Off As A Queen Bee -- Who Will NOT be Denied.

Yet she says she wants:

1.  Openness in Government.

2.  Very High Ethics For Members Of The House.

3.  Far Less Fraud, Waste &amp; Abuse In Government.

4.  Mandatory Controls On Emissions -- In Order To Deal With Global AGW.

Considerably better. Estonia is now one of the success stories of Eastern
Europe, since the population is inherently enterpreneurial. If anything the
country is doing better than the entrenched socialist economies of western
Europe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Does Estonia have much of an Army and Navy?
">

There isn't much of an argument for a navy, nor for an airforce. Let's bear
in mind that the country is roughly the size of Nova Scotia (or Belgium or
Denmark). Navy wise you need fisheries patrol, sovereignty patrol, drug
interdiction, and minesweeping. The minesweeping comes in because the Baltic
waters could be heavily mined in future, and currently they still are -
there are a lot of WW2 mines still around. Ultimately though the Estonian
Navy doesn't have to be huge.

Refer to http://www.mil.ee/index_eng.php?s=merevagi

Estonian air defence is a NATO responsibility.

As for the Army, it's highly professional. You may be aware that it is a
conscript military - national service. As such, Estonia could currently
mobilize more trained soldiers than Canada could. The training itself is
rather efficient - the Estonian contribution to Iraq, albeit tiny, has
received many praises and mentions:

http://defendamerica.mil/articles/feb2005/a020405td4.html

http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Feb2006/20060201_4066.html

http://131.84.1.90/articles/Dec2005/a121905ms1.html

Although all of the articles are worth reading, the last is especially
relevant. Although some of the verbiage is a bit overblown, the fact remains
that Estonian regulars are very well-trained, and are probably better than
the average US soldier or Marine. The reservists are competent.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; coast WITHOUT REFUELING.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; because they haven't offered  her one.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it is typical wingnut pettiness.

&gt;&gt; &gt;The aircraft used by the previous speaker can make the trip unrefuled.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Seems to be anon issue unless she insists on having the big aircraft..

&gt;&gt; Please start telling the truth.

&gt; When have I not in this discussion ?
&gt; The aircraft used by the previous speaker of the house can make the trip

&gt; Note this bit that JackL posted for us,
&gt; &quot;Pelosi flew nonstop from the nation's capital to San Francisco to
&gt; attend the funeral services of the late Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy aboard a
&gt; C-37A, the military's version of a Gulfstream V that can travel 6,300
&gt; miles. It is one of the planes used regularly by Hastert, Pelosi's
&gt; office and the Pentagon said.&quot;

I hear VERY Good Things about Estonia.

Full Members of NATO now -- since 2004.

The Estonians played a Key Role in The Cold War, in all sorts of very useful
ways.

Good Show All 'Round.

The Red Army is completely out of Estonia now?

And the former KGB -- now FSB -- and GRU -- now completely out, or still
lurking?

'Nuff Said.

&gt;&gt; How did the Estonians fare overall with the Soviets and how much better
&gt;&gt; is it now that the USSR has been dissolved?

&gt; Considerably better. Estonia is now one of the success stories of Eastern
&gt; Europe, since the population is inherently entrepreneurial. If anything
&gt; the country is doing better than the entrenched socialist economies of
&gt; western Europe.

&gt;&gt; Does Estonia have much of an Army and Navy?

&gt; There isn't much of an argument for a navy, nor for an airforce. Let's
&gt; bear in mind that the country is roughly the size of Nova Scotia (or
&gt; Belgium or Denmark). Navy wise you need fisheries patrol, sovereignty
&gt; patrol, drug interdiction, and minesweeping. The minesweeping comes in
&gt; because the Baltic waters could be heavily mined in future, and currently
&gt; they still are - there are a lot of WW2 mines still around. Ultimately
&gt; though the Estonian Navy doesn't have to be huge.

&gt; Refer to http://www.mil.ee/index_eng.php?s=merevagi

&gt; Estonian air defence is a NATO responsibility.

&gt; As for the Army, it's highly professional. You may be aware that it is a
&gt; conscript military - national service. As such, Estonia could currently
&gt; mobilize more trained soldiers than Canada could. The training itself is
&gt; rather efficient - the Estonian contribution to Iraq, albeit tiny, has
&gt; received many praises and mentions:

&gt; http://defendamerica.mil/articles/feb2005/a020405td4.html

&gt; http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Feb2006/20060201_4066.html

&gt; http://131.84.1.90/articles/Dec2005/a121905ms1.html

&gt; Although all of the articles are worth reading, the last is especially
&gt; relevant. Although some of the verbiage is a bit overblown, the fact
&gt; remains that Estonian regulars are very well-trained, and are probably
&gt; better than the average US soldier or Marine. The reservists are
&gt; competent.

The previous speaker generally used a C20, occasionally a C37.
The C20 is not generally capable of the flight.

I'm not calling you a liar, I know damn well you aren't but you
are not telling the truth here.
