Queen's doctor warns of homoeopathy crisis
By Nina Lakhani

A leaked memo reveals that there is 'a co-ordinated campaign' to derail
alternative therapies on the NHS

Published: 02 September 2007

The Queen's personal physician and Britain's leading homoeopath
yesterday warned of a &quot;co-ordinated campaign to derail complementary
therapies in the NHS&quot;.

A leaked memo seen by The Independent on Sunday identifies several
influential groups working together for the removal of homoeopathy from
the NHS.

According to Dr Peter Fisher, clinical director of the Royal London
Homoeopathic Hospital, there has been a 20 per cent reduction in
referrals to the hospital in the past year, as new patients are refused
funding by a growing number of primary care trusts.

The hospital - an NHS centre of excellence - could be forced drastically
to cut services if other PCTs introduce the same system and if funding
for patients currently undergoing treatment is withdrawn.

Dr Fisher, whose patients include the supermodel Claudia Schiffer,
pointed to the fact that some six million people in the UK use
complementary therapies each year. Advocates include David Beckham and
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

Dr Fisher said: &quot;There are some patients with conditions that
prescription drugs alone do not help. There is a huge potential to help
these patients and those who experience adverse side-effects from
conventional medicines with complementary therapies.&quot;

The four NHS homoeopathic hospitals combine therapies to treat chronic
conditions, such as depression, irritable bowel syndrome and
osteoarthritis that conventional medicines alone can fail. But this
relatively new
integrated approach offends the beliefs and aims of certain groups.

&quot;The campaign dates back two years starting with several eminent and
mostly retired scientists and doctors who have a way of seeing the world
and medicine which complementary therapies do not sit within,&quot; Dr Fisher
said. &quot;The pharmaceutical industry is worried for its future, as public
opinion is shifting towards complementary therapies.&quot;

The memo, sent out by the president of the Association of the Directors
of Public Health, Dr Tim Crayford, referred only to homoeopathy, but all
complementary therapies are affected. Dr Crayford said: &quot;The email...
was certainly not about all complementary therapies. This paper was
written to help PCTs focus on the delivery of essential services.&quot;

Excellent news. As there should be. A better from alternative therapies
is &quot;unproven therapies&quot; or &quot;conjecture-based therapies.&quot;

If you can prove it works, you should expect the public to pay for it.

My personal belief is that Health Care is a &quot;turf&quot; war, going on
between traditional, conventional, alternative, and homeopathetic
fields.

Unfortunately, in this country the FDA is failing the American people,
by allowing far too much influence from &quot;organized&quot; medicine and
pharmaseudical giants.

But on the other hand, sadly, the alternative fields, are a riddled
mine field of no regulation, little scientific proof of their often
outrageous claims.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From a health consumer point of view, I would like to see the FDA do

the job it was set up to do, which is protect the public.

I would like to see the alternative field, come under the same
guidelines and regulation that the FDA mandates for most other
medicines.  And, I'd like to see the alternative folks do more on
their own to ferret out the charlatans among them.  Unfortunately,
they don't seem to demonstrate the fortitude to do that, so they all
hang together, and those that would be otherwise credible, become not
credible instead.

I will be the first to admit, there have been certain alterntive
fields, that I believe have significant merit.  One of them is
chiropractic, which I personally used in my early 20s, with some
success.  I have not used accupuncture, but have had close friends,
and family members, who have, and swear by it.

In an idylic medical environment, one would have the knowledge and the
information, for making the very wisest choices regarding their health
care, available at their disposal.  But what we have today, isn't
anywhere near that kind of scenario.

To a degree I can agree with that, Peter.  My thinking is however,
that &quot;evidence&quot; emanating from  universities, and colleges, which are
also in the business of creating the conventional medicine practioners
have a conflict of interest.  They are also snagging significant
amounts of money for studies, to foist the drug agendas of
pharmaseudical companies.  Therefore it's possibly unlikely, these
institutions will come up with reliable findings and evidence.

Who will be funding the studies, that will provide any evidence of
validity for the alternative fields?  And WHO will provide us with
unbiased evidence???

My bet is, you would need to find a reliable scientific realm, outside
the United States, to come anywhere near that outcome.  Perhaps, the
Netherlands, possibly India, maybe China.

Conventional medicine has a stranglehold on the scientific process in
the US.  And the quacks among the alternative field are having a field
day, by simply throwing up &quot;conspiracy&quot; theories, rather than self-
police, or clean up their act.

It's all quite a nightmare for the health consummer.  I am very
interested in knowing what alternative remedies will work, and to toss
out the probably 80% or so, which are worthless.  So how do we set up
a process for that.

I know for certain, if I broke a bone, I would not go to an altie
practitioner to fix that. . .I'm going to run to the conventional doc
instead.

However, I am one of those women, who periodically has symptoms of
Restless Leg Syndrome.  Do I really want to pop a pill, which provides
disclosure for such side effects as obsessions of gambling and sexual
activity?  At my age - not necessarily;-)

But, one thing I found out, is with a little yoga exercise, or simply
laying on my back in the middle of the floor, drawing my knees up to
my chest with my arms, and rolling from side to side, and back and
forth, I can immediately relieve most tension in the small of my back,
and have the RLS symptoms all but disappear.

Granted, it's very fast, it's free, and it's without side-
effects. . .I can understand why ALL practioners, wouldn't want me to
do that!  And most certainly, they wouldn't want me to tell anybody!

Thanks, John ... link is working.

Definitely ... with crusading Barrett in the driver's seat for quite a
while,the Quackbuster Brigade have been on this same rampage. The
British team have made many headroads into media and the NIH.

In one of the cases Barrett's NCAHF lost to Botanical Labs, the Judges
knew exactly what was going on. They wrote that Barrett, the losing
appellant:
http://www.humanticsfoundation.com/ncahf-vs-botanical.htm

&quot;... believes that no one should be allowed to market homeopathic
remedies.&quot;

Full closing quote of NCAHF vs Botanical Labs.
After this stunning loss, the NCAHF was suspended by the State of
California for over 4 years.

&quot;Appellant believes that no one should be allowed to market
homeopathic remedies. Congress has decided otherwise, and officially
recognizes the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. Appellant's broad-brush
approach of sweeping all homeopathic remedies into a single bag marked
&quot;undesirable&quot; simply does not work in the courts, where each claimed
instance of unfair advertising and unfair business practice must be
closely scrutinized. Appellant failed to present any admissible
evidence in this case that respondents are guilty of false advertising
and unfair business practices with respect to any of their products.&quot;

Although, I am not in agreement with all Quackbuster and Barrett

I am also very GRATEFUL, there are people out there, who will in part

Do you have faith in conventional medicine?

www.BreastImplantAwareness.org/quackwatchwatch.htm
Con Med Media Central

Note from Ilena Rosenthal:  Bravo To Mercola for this excellent, fact
filled expose on Con Med. After working for 12 years with women harmed
by breast implants, I know too well the damage done once someone gets
hooked into the Con Med Game.

As both Dr. Mercola and I know, Steve &quot;The Media&quot; Barrett fills
various medium with the Con Med point of view. Barrett SLAPP sued Dr.
Mercola TWICE in his unbridled hatred of his viewpoints.

If someone dies that has even remotely been associated with
&quot;alternative medicine&quot; ... Barrett's Parrots let out a wail and
attempt to villianize and promote hatred for the doctor and/or clinic.
When Coretta Scott King chose to go to an alterntive clinic in Mexico
and passed away there before any treatments were even attempted ...
Barrett's guerrillas swept in with Barrett filling the internet with
hate messages about the clinic where she went to die.

Another beloved doctor who believes in homeopathy has had his practice
villianized by Barrett and Team ... and with only the tiniest of
infractions after 40 years of practice was torn apart and scrutinized
... this doctor is trounced on by people without so much as a college
education but who promote Barrett's hatred on Usenet.

What this does, is attempt to cover up these facts:

Sampling below

I highly recommend any with ears to hear and eyes to see to watch
this.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPI7zdGdqo4#

Every year, 7.5 million unnecessary medical and surgical procedures
are peformed.

At least 106,000 people die every year from adverse drug reactions.

A mere 6% of all adverse drug reactions are properly identified.

Most side effects are instead mistaken for new disease symptoms,
leading to further drugging and unnecessary medical procedures,
increasing the risk of death even further.

The mortality rate for people between the ages of 45-64 who took their
prescription drugs correctly, rose 90% in just five years.

More than half of the United States population have received
unnecessary medical treatment.

That's about 50,000 people per day.

42% have been directly affected by a medical mistake, from a procedure
or drug, and 84% of our population personally know someone who's been
a victim of a medical error.

These medical errors and deaths equate to six jumbo jets falling out
of the sky each and every day.

The only difference is the media coverage - there's no public displays
of grief for those who die of faulty medicine.

The deaths caused by Con Med, in just one decade, equate to
approximately 8 million.

The University of Exeter has a Department of Complementary Medicine,
and a Centre for Complementary Health Studies.  It is headed by
Professor Edzard Ernst the holder of the only UK Chair in
Complementary Medicine. Professor Ernst qualified as a physician in
Germany in 1978 where he also completed his MD and PhD theses. He has
received training in acupuncture, autogenic training, herbalism,
homoeopathy, massage therapy and spinal manipulation. He was
Professor in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) at Hannover
Medical School and Head of the PMR Department at the University of
Vienna.

">

The Exeter Department was initially funded by the Maurice Laing
Foundation a private grant-making trust one of the aims of which is
&quot;the scientific research into efficacy of complementary health
treatments and their integration into general medicine&quot;.  It
continues to be funded by the Rufford Maurice Laing Foundation which
shares the same aims.  To date it has not received funds, directly or
indirectly, from drug companies.

The establishment of the Department to scientifically study
Complimentary Medicine was vigorously opposed not by pharmaceutical
companies but by the proponents of homeopathy and similar
&quot;alternative&quot; treatments who were, quite rightly, terrified of being
exposed as charlatans.

At the core of Ernsts approach is rigorous science. It was this
objective rigour which caused dismay to many &quot;practitioners&quot;.

As he said:-

&quot;It sounded to me so inoffensive that it was a huge surprise that
people were up in arms. Some claimed that their individualised and
holistic methods defy testing by randomised clinical trial. When I'm
being polite I say this is based on a misunderstanding of what
science is about. When I'm being less polite I say these people are
mad.&quot;

&quot;Virtually from the word go I've had problems with the complementary
camp. Sometimes it subsides. But then as soon as we publish a
negative result it flares up. We are champions so long as we produce
positive results, but enemies when we produce negative ones.&quot;

Most of the departments studies, specifically those for Homeopathy,
have produced negative results.  What they have shown is that
therapies with the most promising evidence for efficacy are those
with a psychological component.

http://www.pms.ac.uk/compmed/

They publish the &quot;The Desktop Guide to Complementary and Alternative
Medicine: an Evidence-based Approach&quot; ISBN 0-7234-3207-4

Some of it is available at
&lt; http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K_KEguo5BL4C&amp;dq;=&amp;pg;=PP1&amp;ots;=2RjrgK... &gt;

They are also involved with the Focus on Alternative and
Complimentary Therapies
&lt; http://www.medicinescomplete.com/journals/fact/current/ &gt;

Time and time again homeopathy has proven to be ineffective, if
people are daft enough to pay for it that is their choice.  What they
can't expect is for the state to pander to their irrationality by
funding useless treatments.

So you don't like chiropractic and naturopathy, John? They're both
allopathy according to the person who invented the word.

If that is true - then that is frightening!  And a total loss of

Again Ilena - THEN WHO???  You seem content to bash just about
everyone that tries to create some regulation and oversight for
alternative medicine regimes.  But at the same time you are bashing
the FDA for it's failures to regulate.

You demand oversight for pharmaseudical companies, but apparently want
NO oversight of your friends in QUACK medicine land.

So, until things possibly change, I am GRATEFUL there are people, who
attempt to protect the consummer form medical fraud, and outrageous
QUACK medicine and remedies, which are either ineffective, worthless,
and/or downright dangerous.

By the way where did you say the PROOF was, that Dr. Haimes' remedy
pushed at your Humantics tea party, was a &quot;PROVEN CURE FOR SILICONE
VICTIMS&quot;?  Where are the studies, where is the proof?

In addition, I recall being told when Patrick Hughes was traveling
about, and meeting with some of our women in various regions speaking
about how we should vote on the Dow plan, there was at least one
meeting in one region, where there was and accompanying or adjacent
meeting for the women, with an alternative medicine doctor, believed
to be possibly Dr. Weston.  The info I received, was that statements
were being made the doctor had a health regimine which &quot;cured silicone
women.&quot;

What is amazing, is that Ilena throws around the terms, &quot;Disbarred,&quot;
&quot;Unlicensed,&quot; &quot;Failed,&quot; a great deal when she discribes her enemies.

But, when it comes to her own associates, she turns a blind eye, to
NEVER LICENSED, PRACTICING WITHOUT A LICENSE, AND REPREMANDED.

If it walks like a duck, and especially QUACKS like a duck. . .then it
must be a QUACK, QUACK, QUACK!

&gt; Works perfectly, there goes another conspiracy theory.

&gt;&gt; According to Dr Peter Fisher, clinical director of the Royal London
&gt;&gt; Homoeopathic Hospital, there has been a 20 per cent reduction in
&gt;&gt; referrals to the hospital in the past year, as new patients are refused
&gt;&gt; funding by a growing number of primary care trusts.

&gt; That's because homeopathy is ineffective.

&gt;&gt; Dr Fisher, whose patients include the supermodel Claudia Schiffer,
&gt;&gt; pointed to the fact that some six million people in the UK use
&gt;&gt; complementary therapies each year. Advocates include David Beckham and
&gt;&gt; Catherine Zeta-Jones.

&gt; Three advocates with the brain of an Avocado between them?  Is that
&gt; the best you can come up with? How about some objective proof rather
&gt; than brainless &quot;celebs&quot;?

&gt;&gt; Dr Fisher said: &quot;There are some patients with conditions that
&gt;&gt; prescription drugs alone do not help.

&gt; Indeed, and Homeopathy is a moderately useful form of psychotherapy,
&gt; but it doesn't cure any physical illness.

Sure it does: dihydrogen monoxide deficiency syndrome. Just a few
glasses and you are cured.
