Frank Zappa is widely regarded as one of the most influential and &quot;out
there&quot; musicians to have ever pervaded the world airwaves.

From his days inspiring the American &quot;freak scene&quot; with his Mothers Of
Invention to his conducting symphony orchestras up to his death in
1993, Zappa's stretch was far-reaching.

It's little wonder his musical legacy has inspired a tribute show.

And what a tribute show it is.

Conceived by and featuring none other than Frank's son Dweezil, Zappa
Plays Zappa, has been playing to rave reviews since it was first
staged last year.

Having toured most of the world, the show will make its way to
Australia in late November/early December for shows in Brisbane,
Melbourne, Adelaide and of course Sydney.

In fact two shows have been booked for Sydney's Enmore Theatre -
December 3 and 4, with tickets still available for the second.

Joining Dweezil on stage will be a crew of fresh-faced Zappa students
and a couple of special guests from Frank's touring bands.

Guitarist/vocalist Ray White will be one such performer from wayback.

White featured in over 20 of Zappa's recorded works and is known to
many fans for his outstanding vocals on such songs as The Legend Of
The Illinois Enema Bandit and Doreen.

He took time out of his schedule today to speak with the Sun about the
tour.

Sun: You're next show is in New York. How significant is this to you
considering your first recording with Frank was on Zappa In New York?

Ray White: &quot;It will be twice as special .. it's like to the second
power because I'm playing with Dweezil. It was like going home when I
went up to the house [Frank's studio] to practice. Going to New York,
being with Dweezil, is like home, it's like to the second power. So
cool ... you can't describe the feeling of doing that music.&quot;

Sun: Will performing The Legend Of The Illinois Enema Bandit as you
did on the album be a high point of the show for you?

Ray White: &quot;I don't know, it's just one of things I have to deliver.
At those points of the show you go 'okay, here we go, pull the bridges
up, take no prisoners, give them no quarter'.&quot;

Sun: How has the crowd reaction been to Zappa Plays Zappa.

Ray White: &quot;It's been outrageous. It's like I can't believe it, but
then I believe it, but then I know I can't buy it because as a dad and
as a grandfather I know that I owe it to myself to keep the honesty
there and keep my head inside my hat. Because that's the name of the
game out here. Take it for what it is and thank them, but don't start
believing everything you think they're saying.&quot;

Sun: You were involved with Zappa both live and with recordings on and
off from late 1976 to the end of 1984, how significant was that period
of your life?

Ray White: &quot;It was a watershed. It was one of those things that
happens to you ... you don't really realise it until you're passed it.
You don't see it while you're in it, you're just doing it. I look back
on it now and I go, you know what, I got more from that than I
thought. I got more from that than I could see then, but I'm glad I
did the work because if I hadn't done the work, there'd be nothing to
look back on. So I'm glad the work ethic was there and now I get to do
it again with Dweezil and it's intense. It's really, really good. And
I still get that nervousness in my stomach when I go on and that tells
me its not time to stop.

Sun: Frank's music is widely acknowledged for its complexities. How
did this affect your playing style?

Ray White: &quot;I had experimented with compound times but in a very
simplistic way ... very basic African-type rhythms against each other.
But when I heard what Frank was doing, it was like, 'oh this is
absolutely strange'. But then you look at it and you go, 'this is
cool'. You move the layers away and look at it and you see the songs
he puts on top of it and inside of it ... man, I'm in there, you can't
resist it. If you're an inquisitive mind you've got to be there.
You're not a musician unless you're inquisitive. If you're not
inquisitive you're driving a bus. There's some really good guys out
there driving buses, but they don't play Frank's music.&quot;

Sun: Some have described Frank as a hard task master when it came to
what he asked of his bands. Was that the case and how does Dweezil
match up to his father?

Ray White: &quot;If it's your music, and you want your music played the way
you hear it, then if it's a task master they call you ... then call me
anything you want to. How I figure is this ... it's your music, you
want me to do this, I've got to do that. If I reel against that then I
shouldn't have taken the gig. Dweezil has a different approach to it,
but it's the same outcome. He's not a softy, he's a great guy. but he
knows what he wants to hear. He knows what the music is. He and Joe
Travers [drummer and Zappa Family Trust vaultmeister since 1995]] have
listened to that music forever, they know that music. I know Pete
[Griffin, bass] knows the music, he's been listening to it for a long
time too and they know that music. They have a concensus mind when it
comes to it. There's no contention. If they approach a point that may
have a question, they approach it with respect to each other and it
always smooths out. And I love to see that dynamic. They have this
beautiful dynamic and the music is the better for it.&quot;

Sun: How do the current musicians rate, considering the greats you
have shared the stage with: like Terry Bozzio, Chad Wackerman, Bobby
Martin ...?

Ray White: &quot;I think they're as good or better. I can't really grade
musicians. When I play with you, if I feel your being generous, then I
say you're a great person. You could play a thousand licks, you could
be the best technical drummer on earth but if you're not a good human
being, I don't want to be around you.&quot;

Sun: Looking back at old footage, Frank's bands always seemed to have
a great chemistry. Is the current band similar?

Ray White: &quot;It is so refreshing. All these guys in this band - and
young lady - have these wicked, beautiful senses of humour ... wacky
all of them. It comes from these different angles and it finds its way
into the music at the soundcheck, and it makes everything so relaxed,
but it keeps the intensity there, right underneath, and that's what I
really love, that they manage to pull it off ... you can be a kid in
your head, and on your instrument you can be a virtuoso, you can be a
grown up over here - they switch the roles up so you don't get stiff
and stay there like, 'I've got to play this orchestral piece like this
and it must look like this and I've must purse my lips and never
smile, never look at the audience - they're beyond that and they take
this music to another level and Dweezil is the leader of the pack.&quot;

Sun: Steve Vai will be joining you in Australia? How will it be
playing together again?

Ray White: &quot;It's going to be so cool. I saw him at his open rehearsal
and he was just blazing. He reminds me of one of my little brothers.
He's a superior guitarist, but beyond guitarist, he's a better human
being than most people I've met. That's what I tell my kids in
Michigan. I use Steve as an example because they look at Steve, they
revere him ... I say well look, that's a great human being, and then
he's a great guitarist. He's a great father, husband, and then slash
guitarist, because guitars does not raise children, guitars does not
do the things in science that some of our great scientists do, but a
human being does all those things. I try to keep them in perspective
there. And in this band right now the perspective is: the spotlight is
not on me. When I go up and I sing my heart out it's not because I'm
trying to be a star, it's because Frank's music deserves the best, so
you put the best you have into it. If they applaud me, they're not
applauding me, they're applauding Frank. You'll see me always pointing
towards Dweezil ... through him to his father, that's the way it's
supposed to be.&quot;

Sun: Frank joins the band at several points during the current show
via overdubs and on screen. How did this feel the first time?

Ray White: &quot;I was overcome. I had to turn my back on the audience. I
looked back and Frank is on the screen, Dweezil's looking at the
screen, and I walk up behind Frank on the screen, and I look at
Dweezil and then back at the screen and I couldn't contain it. I was
in a Dali painting ... in two places at the one time and it was
unreal.&quot;

Sun: And how have the audience reacted?

Ray White: &quot;It's like a quiet awe at first. There are different
degrees of perception. Some people just went off immediately like he
was actually on the stage. And when that happens you know they have
suspended disbelief. You cannot enjoy those moments unless you are a
kid, in your head, you have to suspend your disbelief. I think Frank's
music helps you do that, and you help it along by doing it yourself,
so its like this 360 thing that happens. That's how people get
involved.&quot;

Sun: What is it about Frank's music that keeps crowds wanting more?

Ray White: &quot;Without a pun - the frankness. The honesty. It's
absolutely up front, unpretentious, without any masks, without any
robes, without any slight of hand. I think a lot of people don't get a
lot of things when they start looking behind it. No, look, it's right
here in front of you I promise you, this is what I said. There's no
hidden agenda here. Here it is. They're so used to hearing it from
their politicians, then they've got to decipher what is said. What did
he really say. But Frank goes: this is BS, that is BS, how about this.
And you go, that makes sense. And I think people gravitate to that,
and I did. I think people love the frankness and the honesty.&quot;
