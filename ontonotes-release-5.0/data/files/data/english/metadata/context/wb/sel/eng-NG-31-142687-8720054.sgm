'The Nine'

According to Jeffrey Toobin's new book on the Supreme Court, Justice
David Souter nearly resigned in the
Getty Images
wake of Bush v. Gore, so distraught was he over the decision that
effectively ended the Florida recount and installed George W. Bush as
president.

In &quot;The Nine,&quot; which goes on sale Sept. 18, Toobin writes that while
the other justices tried to put the case behind them, &quot;David Souter
alone was shattered,&quot; at times weeping when he thought of the case.
&quot;For many months, it was not at all clear whether he would remain as a
justice,&quot; Toobin continues. &quot;That the Court met in a city he loathed
made the decision even harder. At the urging of a handful of close
friends, he decided to stay on, but his attitude toward the Court was
never the same.&quot;

Souter isn't all despair in Toobin's book, however. The author relates
a story in which Souter played along with a stranger who mistook him
for Justice Stephen Breyer. After the person asked him what the best
thing about being on the court was, he replied: &quot;Well, I'd have to say
it's the privilege of serving with David Souter.&quot;

A court spokeswoman could not be reached over the weekend.

Ronnie: These ignorant lib comments makes me wish Bush would nominate
Karl Rove?

Libs are a pest like a gnat. They have soooo much power yet. When Bush
wants wiretaps who authorizes them...Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid.and
Bush gets wiretaps. When Bush wants more troops who authorizes them
Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. and Bush gets troops. They have no power,
plus they are cowards they are just doing the same thing they did
before they took power in 06 gripe and complain (to satisfy their
base, like the libs in here) then they just go along with Bush. they
know the rest of the nation don't think like that and they and their
party must be re-elected. So it's tow the party line in words but do
what Bush says in action. That is you libs democrat party.
This is also the reason they should never be elected to high office
and put in a position where they can nominate high court judges.
Soutor also believes we should take foreign treaties into
consideration when making U.S. law. Don't use the constitution, well
except for toilet paper.

Tony: If he had any standards at all, he would have stood up for his
principles and resign his position in protest of what has since been
proven to have been one of the biggest eff ups in American history.
The blood of every pertson who has died since George W. Bush was given
the Presidency, is on his hands as well as many other peoples,
including all of those who voted for him.

September 4, 1:59 PM
Steve: Jamie, if you can please move on with your life it would be
best for all of us. Again, Bush won the Florida vote count not once,
but twice. The Supreme Court stopped something that would have been
unprecedented - the arbitrary examination of ballots. Bush therefore
was elected, not selected; won an election, not overthrew a
government. See, notice how my post and all those of conservatives
sound calm &amp; logical, unlike the schoolkid rantings of yours &amp; your
side: &quot; He stole it&quot; &quot;treats it like crap&quot; &quot;The law has been ignored
for 8 years&quot;. &quot; Clarence Thomas is a sex pervert&quot; et.
Dennis Miller has said that he has been confronted by both liberals &amp;
conservatives on his views and says libs are uglier, more hateful &amp;
vengeful. GROW UP, LIBS! Its a free country. Your government &amp; your
courts are not your savior!

dicebucket: Scroll to Mike Deupree's message posted at September 4,
10:54 AM.

These adolescent Bush-haters remind me of the story of a small-town
high-school football team that lost in the state playoffs because of a
judgement call in the final seconds of the game.

The losing team players started screaming that the call was wrong.
Enraged adults left the stands and and mobbed the field. The next day
people around the town square were congratulating each other: &quot;We KNOW
we won. To hell with the ref ! We won and &quot;everybody knows&quot; it.

It is irrefutable that the phrase &quot;everybody knows it&quot; is sufficient
proof for any cockamamie accusation, and, by God, everybody knows it!!
&lt;g&gt;

The next week the coach called a team meeting, and the public was
invited. All who came expected an announcement that the coach had
looked at film, had proof of the wrong call, and the home team would
continue in the playoffs.

When the coach managed to quite a rowdy crowd, he stood there seemed
to look every person straight in the eye.

Then he started his message: His football players and everybody else
in the town were humiliating themselves, and acting like small
children. He pointed out that football includes the participation of
rererees, who are human, and it is just a part of the game if they
make a mistake.

Then he started a 20-second movie clip showing the last play shot from
the end zone. He set the clip to play and repeat every 20 seconds as
the continued to talk, pointing out that the clip proved the ref's
call was correct!

Then came the ass-chewing, and he wasn't kind. He explained how all
the complainers had humiliated themselves, shown their childishness
were an embarrasement all over the state.

You've seen that human failing in all the anti-bush statements here.
Finish the day by going to dailykos.com and reading every thread, as
long as you can stand it.

I think very few of the left ever played high-school football...

Subvet: Due to the Bush junta election steal, there are millions of
Americans that weep right along with Justice Souter.

I'm sure that, with a President Gore, there would be 3000 more
Americans alive today as well as 14 highly frustrated terrorists. A
President Gore would have listened to the &quot;bin Laden to attack in the
US&quot; report, rather than ignoring it like Dubya did.
September 4, 1:53 PM
Richard L.A. Schaefer: The emotionalism displayed by Souter, and his
effectively pouting for not getting his way, underline his resemblance
to Justice O'Connor: neither has any real rational principles they
uphold consistently.
September 4, 1:51 PM
Kim Savage: Hey....get over it. The fact is, if we had done 10 Florida
re-counts, there would have been 10 different totals. What would you
do then, count again. Besides, the re-count shed the lunacy of &quot;voter
intent&quot; by our election officials worried about &quot;pregnant chads&quot; and
&quot;dimpled chads.&quot; If you can't puch the card thoroughly, then I guess
you don't get to vote. Just be happy you live in the USA, and if you
don't like it, then leave.
September 4, 1:47 PM
matt: Equal Protection. The Florida Supreme Court (all 7 appointed by
a democrat btw) ruled 4-3 that a recount could occur in some counties
but not in others - as requested by Gore. Bush requested all counties.
That was a violation of the rights of those in other counties (which
included mine).

Secondly, as pointed out below, the letter of the law in Florida
allowed one recount and required the Sec of State to certify the
election or the legislature would decide. The Florida Supreme Court
opted to change that law without legislature approval - a violation in
of itselft.

Finally, 6 months after the thing was over, the NY Times and USA Today
printed a small article (why would it ever get front page on a liberal
newspaper) saying that under no scenerio of recounting would Gore had
won. The recount originally approved by the Florida Sup Court would
have netted bush additional votes, not Gore. Look it up.
September 4, 1:47 PM
Jim: Thanks to liberal judges like Judge Souter, there are over 70
million dead babies who will never even get the chance to weep.
September 4, 1:47 PM

decision. Either way you look at it I have been very happy for the

because all americans aspire to greater wealth (except those who have
been defeated by modern liberalism). You realize that Ann Coulter
graduated from Cornell Law School and clerked for the supreme court
right?

Dave: He is soooo sensitive...... just another example of the
wussification of America. Man up and move on, the guy is a disgrace to
the position he holds.
September 4, 1:31 PM
Jim: Whoa. I'm sorry that I even visited this liberal peet-bog of a
site where little minded hipa-crats, still bitter over the courts
upholding the law, have nothing better to do that wallow in anger and
self-pity. You people make me sick. Needless to say, this will be my
one and only post. I'm sorry that I ever found this site.
September 4, 1:31 PM
Jamie: Reality has no meaning anymore, as evidenced by the support for
the Bush v Gore decision. Gore won the election hands down, no matter
how you cut it. Bush et al stole said election and have proceeded to
treat this country exactly the way you would expect someone to treat
something they've stolen: like crap.
September 4, 1:30 PM

Crybabey Souter cried because he had an agenda he wanted to accomplish.  As
he saw
it, all his hard work, his patience, his waiting had prepared him for this
moment in life. He was a plant for the left, a &quot;sleeper terrorist&quot;.  He had
a
moment when he could swing US history toward the left. He could change the
system from within, its what all good communists are taught. He failed, so
he cried.  Try as he might he could not twist the law towards his leftist

At least one Supreme Court justice recognized a judicial coup when he
saw one.

Why do you suppose that the majority stated that their decision wasn't
to be considered as precedent?

Rightards, like you, don't think about things like that.

Hell...

You don't think at all.

Because Gore couldn't steal the election?

Gore only contested the counties in Florida which voted the most heavily
democrat. By squeezing 5000 more votes out of counties where 4 out of 5
votes are for Gore, he would get a net gain of 3000 votes to push
himself over the top. It was an underhanded way to steal a close
election.

The US Supreme Court said they'd either have to recount the entire state
or not at all, and not just counties that vote heavily democrat.

The law that allows a time extension to the counting is intended to deal
with a hurricane, not to let someone keep counting and recounting until
he gets the result he wants.

If Gore was trying to cheat it would make more sense to recount

Anyone who concedes twice, both times w/o an accurate vote count, just

Bush was ALREADY the winner of Florida BEFORE the USSC took Bush v.

No, because those counties were more likely to have Republican
election officials. Those officials would not allow for the laws to be
violated just to help Gore steal an election.

On the other hand, Democrats violated the Uniformed and Overseas
Citizens Voting Rights Act to throw out legal overseas ballots (see
Bush v. Hillsborough). This act was passed by a Democrat controlled
Congress, but when it gets in the way, the Democrats were more than
willing to violate it.

Further, Gore went to Democrat controlled counties, where they changed
the counting standards to help him &quot;win&quot;. Even Souter could not let
them get away with this.

Justice Souter writing:

&quot;.....But evidence in the record here suggests that a different order
of disparity obtains under rules for determining a voter's intent that
have been applied (and could continue to be applied) to identical
types of ballots used in identical brands of machines and exhibiting
identical physical characteristics (such as &quot;hanging&quot; or &quot;dimpled&quot;
chads). See, e.g., Tr., at 238-242 (Dec. 2-3, 2000) (testimony of Palm
Beach County Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton describing
varying standards applied to imperfectly punched ballots in Palm Beach
County during precertification manual recount); id., at 497-500
(similarly describing varying standards applied in Miami-Dade County);
Tr. of Hearing 8-10 (Dec. 8, 2000) (soliciting from county canvassing
boards proposed protocols for determining voters' intent but declining
to provide a precise, uniform standard). I can conceive of no
legitimate state interest served by these differing treatments of the
expressions of voters' fundamental rights. The differences appear
wholly arbitrary.&quot;

You and people like you who defend what the Court did have never worked
an election. I've worked many elections and I can tell you with absolute
certainty that there's no way there can be a written standard which
addresses every possible situation.

Instead, you count the votes, and then count them again and count them
again and again. You count until you can't come up with the number
recorded by the machine and then another group comes in and recounts
until the numbers all match. IF they can't get the numbers to match they
go to a final group who count again. In each of these groups are equal
numbers of Democrats and Republicans.

The US Supreme Court (mostly Republicans) ruled that all counting should
be stopped and they did that twice. They shamed our constitutional system.

While you're correct that only the Congress can count electors, those
electors are determined by the number of votes cast so your argument is
specious.

Finally, during later counts by the media Gore won every possible way
the votes could have been counted.

There is only one standard, all votes must be counted. The Supreme Court
said otherwise.

I have worked 2 elections.

The court's decision is correct. Florida says that ballots must be
counted in with a uniformed standard and that no dispute will go past
the safe harbor date. If there is still a dispute on that date, then
it is up to Congress to settle the issue.

The US Constitution makes Congress the final arbiter in the matter,
not the unelected courts. In 2000, Congress did their job as
prescribed by the Constitution.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

In the case of Florida 2000, we don't need a &quot;written standard which
addresses every possible situation.&quot; All we need is to have the
ballots counted in a fair manner. As Judge Sauls noted, changing the
standards over and over and over again is not fair. The USSC, as they
should, found that the FSC endorsed an unconstitutional standard.

If you have worked elections, you should understand their argument.
Identically marked ballots mean the same thing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Your argument is not based in fact. There were 3 counts of the ballots
BEFORE the USSC entered into the fray. The election night count, the
automatic recount, and the recount as ordered by the FSC in Palm Beach
v. Harris.

As per the order in Harris, Bush won that recount and was certified
the winner on 11/26/2000. Under the US Constitution, that is the end
of the state's involvement in Bush's Florida Electors.

After this date, for Gore to win, he must get Bush's electors removed
by both the House and Senate, and then get the US House to elect him
as President. With all of the dirty tricks pulled by Gore and the
Democrats, Gore didn't stand a change.

Further, the USSC did not stop two recounts. They stopped a post-
certification, standardless, non-binding, partial recount of disputed
ballots. So what?? Anyone who has worked an election would know that
if you have disputed ballots, only recounting a few of them will not
determine a winner.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; While you're correct that only the Congress can count electors, those
&gt; electors are determined by the number of votes cast so your argument is

You are ignoring the facts and the US Constitution. Bush was already
certified the winner of the state BEFORE the USSC took Bush v. Gore.
Not only does Congres count the electors, but under the 12th Amendment
of the US Constitution, they are the only body who can determine LEGAL
electors. The UNELECTED courts do not have a role in this matter.

Gore could win all the recounts that he wished, the FSC could say that
Gore won the election all they wanted, but until Congress removes
Bush's Florida Electors, Gore loses.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Finally, during later counts by the media Gore won every possible way
&gt; the votes could have been counted.
">

Please don't resort to making up fact, we all know that this is false.
The NORC who conducted a PARTIAL recount of the disputed ballots found
that they could not determine a winner.

The Orlando Sentinel found that there were 179,855 spoiled ballots.
The NORC said that they checked 175,010 of those ballots. IF you have
really worked an election as you claim, then you know that this
recount is meaningless.

http://www.failureisimpossible.com/floridafollies/FL_articles/spoiled...

&quot;But even if you assume that all ballots cast were legal and nobody
was unjustly turned away from the polls and that the 6 million plus
Florida ballots that weren't contested were cast accurately, the
Florida winner is still unknowable. This wisdom comes from Kirk Wolter
of the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago,
the point person in assembling the data for the project, who is quoted
by the Tribune and the AP (and also, only deeper, in stories by the
Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times). The
consortium diligently collected 175,010 overvotes and undervotes, but
it concedes that it can't be sure if it collected every overvote and
undervote. If the margin of victory is just a couple of hundred votes,
as it was in nearly all the media recounts, the contest as &quot;too close
to call,&quot; Wolter says, because the variability of the vote counts-the
possible error-would be larger than the margin of victory.&quot;

All the ballots were counted, some as many as 3 time. It is not good

Florida law calls for a recount in case of close elections, and the
manufacturer of the voting machines call for a manual recount when the
vote is as close as it was in Florida.

Republicans didn't want a manual recount and went to court to prevent
it.

They lost, with the Florida Supreme court telling the Florida election
committee that they not only had the power to order a manual recount,
they also had the authority to set standards for how ballots were to
be counted.

That's when the U.S. Supreme court stepped in and put rules in place
that made the manual recount impossible.

Neither did they explain why they didn't want their decision to be
used as future precedent.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what transpired.

It does, however, take someone smarter than a rightard.

Those men hold the Constitution dear, something you don't understand,
that document now destroying Bush, Cheney and the right wing,
treasonous, as was intended by the writers, in the event of treason.
They were quite familiar with the unitary executive.

But you can't see it, because you're either drunk, again, or just too
stupid.

But nice try.

You're being trolled, btw.

We love the Constitution, too.

Hang on Justice Souter...

( He's in control again, &quot;rush&quot; is in control again. Stupid tuna, if
YOU knew how easy it is to troll your 110 IQ and your boy genius,
loser of wars, fucker up of game theory, you'd be astounded. It's like
a game of hopscotch...tuna balls...)

Doesnt matter what you do, you've lost. You cannot win it, not with
this plan, and not with this group.

I feel a libs! libs! libs! moment, coming. Oh, another addington
cheney dirty trick on the way?

Arent' we all a little tired of being bullied by Dick Cheney and David

And that was a violation of Florida Code. The state legislature

&quot;(c) Any manual recount must be completed in accord with standards for

standards for the ... Scoring of ballots.&quot;FLA STAT. §101.5609(8)

shall &quot;Obtain and maintain uniformity in the application, operation,
and interpretation of the election laws.&quot;)

http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/election/floridahouse.pdf

Further, the Florida Supreme Court found that there were spoiled
ballots because the machines had erred. Since there were spoiled
ballots in every county in the state, the law required ALL BALLOTS to
be recount. Instead of following the law, they decided to only recount
approx 1% of the vote. Again, that is a violation of Florida Code.

&quot;(a) The manual recount must include all ballots affected by the
relevant defect. If a manual recount is done, the Legislature directed
that it must count &quot;all ballots&quot; in the county having machine
problems, FLA. STAT. §102.166(5)(c), or if the problem is defective or

and fair recount of the state.

&gt; &gt; Instead of following the law, Gore fought to only recount ballots in a
&gt; &gt; few Democrat majority counties.

&gt; &gt; Further, Bush argued before the Florida Supreme Court that Florida
&gt; &gt; code required that all ballots to be recounted. He was overruled by
&gt; &gt; the Democrat majority on the court.

&gt; The Florida supreme court said that it was up to the election comittee

And they were wrong.

&gt; &gt; &gt; They lost, with the Florida Supreme court telling the Florida election
&gt; &gt; &gt; committee that they not only had the power to order a manual recount,
&gt; &gt; &gt; they also had the authority to set standards for how ballots were to
&gt; &gt; &gt; be counted.

&gt; &gt; And that was a violation of Florida Code. The state legislature
&gt; &gt; dictates that the Secretary of State to set the counting standards.

&gt; The Florida Supreme Court decides what Florida law says.

Article II of the US Constitution forbids the courts from rewriting

Chief Justice Wells, Florida Supreme Court, Gore v. Harris, 12/8/2000:

&quot;My succinct conclusion is that the majority's decision to return this
case to
the circuit court for a count of the under-votes from either Miami-
Dade County or
all counties has no foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on
November 7,
2000, or at any time until the issuance of this opinion. The majority
returns the
case to the circuit court for this partial recount of under-votes on
the basis of
unknown or, at best, ambiguous standards with authority to obtain help
from
others, the credentials, qualifications, and objectivity of whom are
totally
unknown. That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems the
majority
creates.

&gt; &gt; &quot;(c) Any manual recount must be completed in accord with standards for
&gt; &gt; counting chads that are uniform across the counties. The Legislature
&gt; &gt; has directed: &quot;The Department of State shall adopt rules prescribing
&gt; &gt; standards for ballots used in electronic or electromechanical voting
&gt; &gt; systems. Such standards shall ensure that ballots are counted in a
&gt; &gt; uniform and consistent manner and shall include, without limitation,
&gt; &gt; standards for the ... Scoring of ballots.&quot;FLA STAT. §101.5609(8)
&gt; &gt; (emphasis added). See also FLA. STAT. §97.012 (the Secretary of State
&gt; &gt; shall &quot;Obtain and maintain uniformity in the application, operation,
&gt; &gt; and interpretation of the election laws.&quot;)

&gt; &gt; http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/election/floridahouse.pdf

&gt; &gt; Further, the Florida Supreme Court found that there were spoiled
&gt; &gt; ballots because the machines had erred. Since there were spoiled
&gt; &gt; ballots in every county in the state, the law required ALL BALLOTS to
&gt; &gt; be recount. Instead of following the law, they decided to only recount
&gt; &gt; approx 1% of the vote. Again, that is a violation of Florida Code.

&gt; &gt; &quot;(a) The manual recount must include all ballots affected by the
&gt; &gt; relevant defect. If a manual recount is done, the Legislature directed
&gt; &gt; that it must count &quot;all ballots&quot; in the county having machine
&gt; &gt; problems, FLA. STAT. §102.166(5)(c), or if the problem is defective or
&gt; &gt; damaged ballots, then &quot;all such ballots&quot; must be manually recounted,
&gt; &gt; FLA. STAT. §101.5614(5). Partial manual recounts were nowhere
&gt; &gt; authorized by the Legislature.&quot;

&gt; &gt; http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/election/floridahouse.pdf

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's when the U.S. Supreme court stepped in and put rules in place
&gt; &gt; &gt; that made the manual recount impossible.

&gt; &gt; It was the Florida Supreme Court (and Al Gore agreed) that said that
&gt; &gt; Florida Code required any disputed to be cleared up by the safe harbor
&gt; &gt; date. The US Supreme Court didn't make this rule up, they UPHELD the
&gt; &gt; law as written.

&gt; It's not the place of the U.S. Supreme court to interpet Florida law.

Bull. If the state of Florida imposed a poll tax, you are tell us that
the USSC could not rule on the law. You should know better.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Neither did they explain why they didn't want their decision to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; used as future precedent.

&gt; &gt; Read Article II of the US Constitution.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what transpired.

&gt; &gt; Gore tried to steal an election with a standardless partial recount of
&gt; &gt; the ballots. Bush won that recount, thus state certification.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It does, however, take someone smarter than a rightard.
&gt; &gt; &gt;From this post, that leaves you out.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you suppose that the majority stated that their decision wasn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be considered as precedent?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because Article II of the US Constitution. Just because Hawaii allows
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for recounts to  go past the safe harbor date, does not mean the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Florida has to allow the same.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If that's the case, the logical inference is that it was up to Florida
&gt; &gt; &gt; to decide how to conduct the recount.

&gt; &gt; IF we left it up to the laws on the books, Gore wouldn't get another
&gt; &gt; recount. IF we let the Democrats on the Florida Supreme Court violate
&gt; &gt; the US Constitution, then it was up for grabs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The Supreme Court should have stayed out of it all together.

&gt; &gt; It doesn't matter one way or the other. The Democrats on the Florida
&gt; &gt; Supreme Court had already allowed Bush to become the state certified
&gt; &gt; winner of the state. Since the Republicans held the US House, Gore
&gt; &gt; could not win the election until he convinced them that he really. For
&gt; &gt; some reason, he was stupid enough to think that a standardless partial
&gt; &gt; recount would do the trick. Pure stupidity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But, they didn't, did they?

&gt; &gt; No, they didn't. They decided to uphold the rights of the people.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The reverse is also true. Just because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Florida wants the protections of the safe harbor provisions of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Electoral Count Act of 1887, does not mean that a court can force
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other state to accept those protections.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rightards, like you, don't think about things like that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Before you make another silly statement such as this, I suggest that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you read the US Constitution.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have read it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's how I know a judicial coup took place.

&gt; &gt; In other words, you ignored the 12th Amendment of the US Constitution.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You don't think at all.- Hide quoted text -
