Hi I play in a rock band and use a 1200 watt pa which is fine for most
pub gigs. recently we decided  to commercialise our set and try to
start play weddings to bring in the dosh. (i always said this day
would'nt come!!) anyway im on the lookout for a new PA that would give
out enough juice to cover halls with a max of around 400 people.

Hire out your sound and take it off the list of things you'll need to
worry about.  You'll be busy enuf trying to keep the
mother-of-the-bride happy to appreciate not having to worry about
feedback and sound levels.  ;-)

I'm in a classic rock band that now plays more weddings than any other
kind of gig.  We have our own PA, and we've used it for most of our
gigs over the last 4+ years, running sound from the stage, struggling
with mix, monitor feedback, etc.  In the end, it always worked out,
the clients were happy, we got paid, AND we got more gigs.  BUT...

It was a royal pain in the ass.  I couldn't really enjoy playing
because I was always worried about the sound.  And I was always tired
by the time the gig even started because I had already spent several
hours hauling and setting up our gear.  And when we were done with
four hours of playing at 12:30am or so, we had to spend another hour
packing everything up.

We finally started checking into smaller sound companies, and we found
several in our town that would provide and run a PA suitable for a
wedding for around $300.  Since our gig fee for wedding was in the
$1500 range, it seemed well worthwhile  to try hiring sound for a
change.

What a world of difference.  Far less time, effort, and stress for the
band; better sound and better performance for the client.   Sure, we
each take home $60 less per gig ($240 each vs. $300), but we actually
enjoy gigging again, and we can take on a few more gigs than we would
otherwise commit to, because it's less strenous.

I don't think we'll ever go back to trying to do our own sound for
better-paying gigs, and I recommend you check around and consider
doing the same.  Though it's worthwhile to keep your old PA around for
emergencies (trust me on this).

thanks for your advice makes sense, do the hire guys set up the gear
and everything for you.
what all gear do you usually hire? we currently use 2 EV sx 300
speakers and a 1200 wattstudiomaster powered mixer.
but for bigger venues we use another 1200 watt poweramp for two old
subs, ith a martin crossover.

the setup is ok but it doesn't really give out a nice enough range for
a nice compact mix. we plan on keeping the sound low on stage and
putting the whole band through the PA for a really professional sound.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Yes.  In fact, we've offered to help, but they usually seem to prefer
to do it themselves.  Sometimes they'll ask for help tipping some
large cabs.  So they usually show up 2-3 hours before showtime, and
they ask us to show up an hour beforehand.  And we just have to pack
our own instruments and amplifiers when the show is over.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; what all gear do you usually hire?
">

I don't usually dig too deeply into what they'll provide.  If they're
pros, and they know what kind of gig and venue it is, they'll
hopefully provide something that works.  We've never been disappointed
with the PA rig .. it's almost always about ten times more capable
than what we could manage on our own.  And it's sure nice not to have
to worry about the sound when you're playing .. assuming of course
that you trust the guy running the mix.

My recollection is that the hired sound companies we've worked with
have usually provided *at least* a pair of 2x12 two-ways on top and a
pair of 1x18 or 2x18 subs, all driven by a pretty capable rack.  It's
always been plenty for any indoor gig, especially a wedding, where
they want people dancing in front of the stage but able to talk and
socialize in the back of the room.  And they usually provide between 2
and 4 monitor mixes.  Some provide their own mics and stands; others
want you to bring your own  (not sure why).  Some provide lights (esp.
the pricier ones); most don't.

The hard part, in my experience, has been finding the ones that are
(1) good, (2) affordable, and (3) not already booked up.  Often these
are guys that are doing it on the side and have a lot of experience
but don't feel like pushing real hard to get gigs .. you have to find
them pretty much by word of mouth, because sound companies (at least
in our area) are nearly invisible on the web, in the phone book, etc.
You have to find someone who knows someone who knows someone, and
often you can find someone pretty good that way, once you get lucky
with your initial contacts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; a nice compact mix. we plan on keeping the sound low on stage and

">

In my experience, the key to keeping the sound low on the stage is to
have a drummer who can drum with light sticks and still make it sound
good.  Everything on our stage, from guitars to monitors, has to come
up to match our drummer. When the stage is small, the crash cymbals
might be three feet from my right ear.

Hi spud.  We are an 8 piece band that plays mostly weddings and
private parties.
The one thing I found is that you have to make some compromises.  The
ideal situation for the sound system is to have a nice PA, lots of
stage area, and the soundman out front centered in front of the band.
But these are weddings and you don't always have the luxury.
Sometimes you can bring a full rig.  Lots of times there is not
adequate power for lighting.  And the soundman may not get his ideal
spot in front of the band because there is a wedding cake or an ice
sculpture in the way.  The other thing is that the staff typically
does not like snakes because they have to carry their trays over the
cabling.  My point is that weddings are not rock concerts where 100%
of the logistics are devoted to the band.

I suggest getting these logistics handled prior to booking the wedding
so that there are no surprises.  Let the bride/groom know that you
need x amount of power and x amount of space.  Let them know that you
need about 6 feet of space allocated for the sound guy.
Mixing from stage takes the burdon of you but you may sacrifice
sound quality.
Having a sound guy mxing from the front adds more logistics that
you need to clear up with the bride/groom and reception hall manager.

Anyway, we ALWAYS hire the same sound guy who is loyal to us.
The small sytem is:
2 yorkville NX55P powered speakers
1 (yes only 1) qsc HPR118 powered sub.
6 wedges on 4 channels (since we are a big band)
2  chauvet 3 color washes (1500w per wash) if power permits -
otherwise there are 1 or 2 gelled par 56 on the floor
Sometimes there is some dance floor lighting too (some crappy
american dj stuff and star ball that has a disco ball effect)

The bigger system (used at bigger receptions with a stage and a power
tie in)
4 eaw kf650z
4 eaw LA400 typically centered clustered
6 wedges on 4 mixes
2 chauvet washes
back truss with 8 trackscans
haze machine

A Yamaha LS9 is hopefully coming soon.  This would simplify things
alot because of the smaller foh real estate.
People at weddings tend to freak out when you wheel in 18u racks.

One thing I forgot to add...

When playing at weddings, you are pretty much now responsible for MC-
ing and announcemnts.  So point your speakers towards the guests when
the announcing and toasts go on.  Get a wireless mic if you don't have
one.  It is a must at weddings.

I second virtually all of what infinitisound has said.  In essence
you're not the main attraction but a necessary accessory, take your
place and carry your spear, so to speak.

One thing I've found works much better (at least for doing sound at a
wedding and reception) is not to go through the bride and groom but to
find out early on who their contact and logistics person at the
reception hall is and deal directly with them, keeping in mind that
you're an accessory, so to speak, and tailoring your setup to that end.
The bride and groom will have plenty to do getting ready for the
wedding, if you can take some of the burden off them they'll be much
happier and you might make a good contact for future gigs at the
reception hall.  Some details will need to be worked out with the
couple, confer with the contact person as to who will talk with them
about it and make sure everyone understands what's been decided and
what's going to happen.

Happy gigs!
