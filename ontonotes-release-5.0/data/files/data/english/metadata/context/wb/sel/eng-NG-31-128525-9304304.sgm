Just wanted to let you know about yesterday's doctor report.

Well, labs were done, but those aren't back yet. I don't expect those back until about the first of next week or so. They are usually fine, though, so I'm not too worried.

I also talked to him about my thumb. He did give me another cortizone shot, but he also wants to talk surgery now. Nothing about this is set in stone yet. I haven't even met with a surgeon. I really don't want to do that until after the first of the year unless things get worse. The area where the shot was given is still pretty tender. That should go away soon, though. If I do have the surgery, I might get it done at a hospital close by. We'll just have to wait and see. That's really all I know for now. I won't know anything more until I talk to the doctor about whether or not I'll have surgery. I'll update everyone again when I know more. I thank you all for your prayers. I love you all.

If you want to get in touch with me privately, you can. All your e-mails are important to me. I don't open forwards, or e-mails that are titled with No Subject. I hope everyone has a really great day. My favorite verses are Matthew 11:28-30. Have a great day everyone. I love you all.

Smile Because Jesus Loves You And So Do I

FLEE THESE THINGS

“Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.” – Luke 21:36

The Greek word for ‘escape’ is ‘ek-pheygo,’ meaning TO FLEE OUT OF. It is the same word that is used in 1 Timothy 6:11, “But thou, O man of God, flee (escape) these things…” Flee what things? The context gives quite a listing: strife of words, whereof cometh envy; strife, railings, evil surmising, perverse disputing of men, supposing that gain is godliness, the love of money, etc. Then it says, “FLEE THESE THINGS,” escape out of the snare of these things.

2 Tim. 2:22, “Flee also youthful lusts,” All of the over-desires of the flesh so prevalent in youth, for they must have this, and that, seeking to satisfy self. The driving passions of the flesh of youth which can seemingly only be subdued with the passing of time and many disciplines of life, until we realize how empty it all is, and our sense of values change. Is it possible to pass through the midst of all this, not touching that which would defile? YES! It is by the help of the grace of God, as our prayer rises to Him continually. He can keep us from lingering in the midst of temptation, and from being sidetracked into involvement with these things. Jesus, “In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety.” – Heb. 5:7 NAS

The Biblical thought of escape, or, to flee out of, does not hold within it the thought of ‘escapism’ in the sense of not having to face up to the test, but rather, to pass through it uncorrupted, and thus OVERCOMING IT. The Word of God does not teach ‘escapism’ whereby one avoids facing the testing, but that we pass through it without being corrupted by its negativity. We flee out of the corrupting influence, to follow after that which is pure and holy. God will enable His worthies to pass right through the midst of trouble and not be harmed.

Subject: Contentment

Phil. 4:11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. Note that Paul said I have learned to be content. He never said it came natural. In fact he said quite a bit to the contrary. He described the life of an apostle quite clearly;
1Cor. 4:11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place; That's what he had to say about the life of an apostle. I'm saying that because of a warning he gave us about false teachers in the last days.
1Tim. 6:3 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness.
1Tim. 6:4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings.
1Tim. 6:5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
1Tim. 6:6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1Tim. 6:7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out .
1Tim. 6:8 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
1Tim. 6:9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
1Tim. 6:10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
We're in the midst of a generation of teachers who say just that. In fact they go so far as to say if you aren't prospering, you aren't where you should be with God. They go on further saying that if you aren't walking in divine health your faith is weak &amp; you aren't where you should be with God; in spite of Paul's statement to the contrary. people The Bible talks about new testament ministers who were so sick they almost died for the gospel's sake. If we were guaranteed divine prosperity &amp; divine health, that would have been the experience of these great men of God; but it wasn't. I know this kind of teachings won't make me a lot of friends &amp; win a lot of people to my school of ministry; but I won't be guilty of teaching lies. I've seen my share of miracles in 27 years in the ministry; &amp; were I still holding revivals now they would still happen in every meeting; but they would happen because God ordained those miracles; not because I'm something special. I make a [point of never starting a service with a preconceived idea of what God would have me to do. I simply go to the building where I'm going to preach &amp; shut myself in for a few areas &amp; pray over that sanctuary &amp; seek God's will for that service. I've done this for over 27 years in the ministry now; &amp; God has honored that commitment. Please, never accept any man's word for something as important as your salvation &amp; eternal well being without getting into the word of God &amp; studying it for yourself.

3 The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch upon the
evil and the good.(B)

Have you as a believer asked someone to repeat something they have
said to you, because you didn't quite catch it, and they said ' oh It
was nothing important'.

Well God never misses anything, he sees and hears everything, he does
not miss a trick.

To me as a believer, this is really comforting, because I know that
sometimes things are said and done behind my back, but God sees and
hears everything.

He sees all the times you have been talked about, every bad word that
has been spoken about you and every trick that has been planned and
played on you.

Our Father sees absolutely everything and so we can rest in this
truth, we do not have to worry about what people say about us, or do
to us, because God sees it and he weighs these things, he is our
avenger.

So we have to let God be God. Do Not act as God, seeking revenge,
because you have the fearful judge of the universe in your corner.

He sees the injustice done to you and he and he alone, will deal with
that. One thing that you have to remember is that in the end, you
will come through all of the trials stronger and sweeter, because you
stand on the promises of God and look to Him and do not seek to
deal with things in your own way.

I hope this blesses someone

God Bless you

Messages in this topic (1) 6. WHY DO YOU CALL ON JESUS WHEN YOU PRAY? Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Wed Nov 14, 2007 8:30 am (PST)

Why Do You Call On Jesus When You Pray?

&quot;For there is that in God which is suited to all the exigencies and occasions of His people that trust in Him.&quot; - Matthew Henry

If someone were to ask you why you pray to the Lord Jesus, how would you answer that question?
Or, if they were to ask you why they should place their confidence in your God in these troublesome and perilous times, what would you say?

In Psalm 18:3, David boldly stated his resolution to always call upon the Lord. This is what he said - &quot; I will call upon the LORD, Who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.&quot; He purposed to constantly - in all times of trouble...when facing dangerous situations...or just simply for fresh mercies - be found fleeing to the God of the Bible or placing His confidence in Him in prayer.

Jehovah God had proven Himself to be faithful in the past. For past favors, He had proven Himself to be worthy of David's confidence. He was indeed the One and Only Being every way worthy of praise.

David had enemies. There was no way that he could save himself from their &quot;hands.&quot; He needed someone bigger than himself. The &quot;LORD&quot; was the Able One Who always came to his rescue.

Do you have enemies? Are you facing giants? In whose strength are you facing them? Who do you run to when you find yourself in trouble or in danger?

Like David, the Born Again Christian has a refuge in his God. Hence, in every situation in life, do-or-die, he will call upon Him for help.

&quot;I will call upon the LORD...&quot;

If someone were to ask you why, what reason would you give?

In Psalm 18:2, David offered nine reasons why every one should call upon Jesus at all times and in every place. He alone should be their object of implicit and reliable trust. The nine reasons are as follows -

&quot;I will call upon the LORD&quot; because He is my &quot;rock.&quot; He is my cleft rock to which I run for refuge. He is my place of concealment and security. He is my place in God from the &quot;strife of tongues&quot; and the fury of the storms of trouble. He is my elevated place of safety - my lofty rock - to which I fly in order to escape from my enemies.

&quot;I will call upon the LORD&quot; because He is my &quot;fortress.&quot; He is my stronghold - my place of defense - the place so strong that no enemy can approach it. He is my garrison which is kept by the power of God. He is my place of strength and safety.

&quot;I will call upon the LORD&quot; because He is my &quot;deliverer.&quot; Whenever I am surrounded and almost taken by the enemy, He is my way of escape from afflictions, temptations, the hands of all enemies, the body of sin, death itself, or the wrath to come. He steps in for me in the hour of peril. He rescues me from the hands of those who are mightier than me. He causes me to persevere in straits and difficulties.

&quot;I will call upon the LORD&quot; because He is my &quot;God.&quot; He alone is my heaven, my all. He is all good things in One. He is my perpetual, unchanging, infinite, and eternal good. He is my Protector, Helper, Friend, Father, and Savior. He Who puts strength in my soul is the strong and mighty One Who alone is able to save.

&quot;I will call upon the LORD&quot; because He is my &quot;strength.&quot; He is my firm and unmovable rock. He is my sure, unchanging, eternal confidence and support. He is my refuge or protection.

&quot;I will call upon the LORD&quot; because He is the One &quot;in Whom I will to trust.&quot; He is the object of my faith. I can trust in Him and confide in Him at all times because He is the eternal and inexhaustible fountain of goodness.

&quot;I will call upon the LORD&quot; because He is my &quot;buckler.&quot; He is my shield or defender Who covers my head and heart from any blows of the enemy. He preserves me from the fiery darts of Satan.

&quot;I will call upon the LORD&quot; because He is the &quot;horn of my salvation.&quot; There are certain beasts who derive their strength from their horns. Their horns are their means of attack or defense. Hence, they have become the emblem of power and strength efficiently exercised. Jesus is the One Who pushes, scatters, and destroys my enemies. He is my source of excellency and might from Whence deliverance or salvation comes.

&quot;I will call upon the LORD&quot; because He is my &quot;high tower.&quot; He is my high place which is beyond the reach of danger. He is my safe and inaccessible place of safety.

These were nine reasons why David found strength, safety, security, and salvation in his God...why He considered the Lord to be the One and Only Object of his most implicit and reliable trust and confidence...and why he owed his safety entirely to God.

After reading about these nine characteristics of the Lord God, who wouldn't come away saying of Him - &quot;Who is worthy to be praised&quot; ?

And who would ever have a problem with fear or doubt of coming out victoriously in any situation after placing their total confidence in Him - &quot;so shall I be saved from mine enemies&quot;?

Please don't allow the familiarity of these verses to cause you to quickly overlook the message which the Holy Spirit is trying to convey.

Some Christians &quot;know&quot; the Word inside and out. But when caught in peril or in some sort of trouble, they &quot;cave in&quot; to their circumstances or the storm that is raging around them.

God wants this message to &quot;sink in.&quot;

The God of the Bible is everything that you will ever need Him to be. He is not like the false &quot;gods&quot; of the nations.

You need not fear what the devil will bring your way.

Resolve like David that whenever &quot;bad times&quot; come, you will immediately &quot;call upon the LORD.&quot; He will come to your rescue.

But even before that, why not determine in your heart that you are never going to stop praising Him for being the God that He is?

He will be there for you whenever you need Him. When the time comes, like David, you, too, &quot;will be saved from your enemies.&quot; You can count on that.

He is &quot;so worthy to be praised.&quot;

Why don't you let Him know just how worthy He is by offering Him the best &quot;Praise Offering&quot; you can give Him - even right now?

May God Bless His Word.

Messages in this topic (1) 7. *~*Growing In Patience~*~* Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Wed Nov 14, 2007 9:03 am (PST)

J. P.'s Inspirations
~GROWING IN PATIENCE~

&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness,gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.&quot;
.....Gal. 5: 23 (NKJV)
********

Have you ever seen Christians who seem to have everything all together in their
lives in the good times, yet when things do not go their way; they seem to have no temperance
or self control? If one does not have self-control in times of opposition or trials, they need to
get a firm grip on God and let Him be Lord of their life. If we are in God's grip of grace, we can
be temperate in all things and are to show forth a Christ like Spirit at all times. We must &quot;know
Christ&quot; to &quot;show Christ&quot; to others, and be fruit bearing Christians, as commanded. To have fruit
in our lives, we must be abiding in the Vine, Christ Jesus, who makes us fruitful for His glory.

We are told that self-control is part of the 'fruit of the Spirit' or attributes of our Lord. As we grow in
the knowledge of Jesus Christ, we will exercise temperance or self-control, even in the midst of life's
earthly trials. We cannot produce self-control through our own actions, but as Christ lives in and
through us, this is the fruit which He will produce in our lives. The Greek word for self-control comes
from the word &quot;kratos,&quot; which means &quot;strength.&quot; As we grow in the knowledge of Jesus Christ, we
will exercise self-control and have more power with God. Self-control is seeking to please God
first....not self or others, in all we do. It is putting Jesus first, others second, and self last, which
will produce a real and lasting joy in our lives.

Without self-control in a person's life, they will yield to the lusts of the flesh and seek to please self, or
others first; instead of God. We have one greater who lives within, and must let Him be Lord over every
part of our life. We must give Him access to every area of our heart and life to be assured victory over
sin, in this Christian walk.

After we are born again, we must add to our new faith virtues of God's divine nature: goodness,
knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly kindness and love. We see that Peter gives
us a progressive list of virtues which we add to our faith, once we accept the Lord as our Savior. These virtues
produce maturity and Christian growth in our lives. The more about God we know, the more our growth in
Christ will show His attritutes to a lost and dying world. The first virtue we see in the fruit of the spirit
is &quot;faith&quot; and without faith; it is impossible to please God or be saved. He that comes to the Lord must
believe that &quot;He is&quot; the &quot;I Am&quot; and is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. He is a faith
God and gives us faith. Each day, we must add to our faith the virtues which Christ will produce in our lives
by fellowship with Him. As we decrease, He will increase in our lives that we might be fruitful branches
of the one &quot;True Vine&quot;.... Christ Jesus our Lord.

&quot;Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free&quot; (John 8:32). What sets us free? Knowing
the truth does. Not simply hearing the truth, but knowing the truth liberates us. Knowledge is not just
hearing about God, but personally knowing God and His truths, and then acting upon them.
Knowledge is essential if we are to have self-control in our lives. If the truth sets us free, we see that
believing lies is the opposite, and keeps one bound. To grow as Christ desires, we must reject all lies of the
enemy, false doctrines, or theories. We must seek out the truths of the Lord by studying to show ourselves
approved as a workman that needeth not be ashamed, rightfully dividing the Word of Truth.

Self-Control in the midst of trials works together with the other fruit of the Spirit to make us what we
should be for the Lord. Self-Denial is something which the world does not practice but Christians
must exercise to be victorious. Jesus says, &quot;If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself
and take up his cross and follow me&quot; (Matthew 16:24). Our Lord believes we can deny ourselves and
tells us we must do so each day. He has provided all we need to be victorious in Him.

Self-denial is not always easy, and there will be sufferings along the way. We are to have the
attitude of those in God's Word when we go through sufferings, by seeing the end result. &quot;We also
rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance produces
character; and character, hope.&quot; (Romans 5:3). &quot;Hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed
abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.&quot; The Lord's instructions for success will
show us the pathway to victory we can walk in and be blessed. May He be given all praise and glory
as King of Kings and Lord of Lords!

~STANDING FOR JESUS~

We must stand for Jesus and be true to him each day
If we don't stand for truth.......we will fall along the way.
His ways are right and lead to our eternal home,
We shall one day meet the Savior, and never more shall roam.

The Lord who walks beside us, will guide us in paths of right,
We have a God who cares each day, and watches us in the night.
We can be secure, if we stand on the solid Rock, in Him,
He is our Loving Savior, and our dearest Friend.

We must stand strong for Jesus, and have faith in our Lord
One day we shall receive our eternal heavenly reward,
We must press on each day, as His Spirit leads the way,
We will be secure in the grip of grace, if in his will we stay.

Blessings In Christ,

QUOTES AND ONE-LINERS

Why is it that there is never enough time to do a job right,
but always time enough to do it over?

Great thoughts reduced to practice become great acts.

Those who do not plan for the future will have to live through it anyway.

It is better to give than lend, and it costs about the same.

We are never defeated unless we give up on God.

Messages in this topic (112) 9a. BE WELL BALANCED Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Wed Nov 14, 2007 9:24 am (PST)

Be well balanced (temperate, sober of mind)....rooted, established, strong, immovable, and determined....
-1 Peter 5:8,9

An emotional person is someone who is easily affected with or stirred by emotions. Their conduct is ruled by emotion rather than reason. A person who lives by emotion lives without principle.

We all have emotions, and they are not going away, but we cannot trust them. We should seek God to learn to manage our emotions and not allow them to manage us.

We are created to operate in the fruit of self-control. Self-control is a freedom-not a bondage. We are free to use wisdom, free to obey God, free to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. We are free not to be pushed around by our feelings. We don't have to do what we feel like doing; we are free to do what we know is wise.

Be honest with yourself in this area. If you believe you are not managing your emotions, begin to pray and seek God about emotional maturity. Remember:

1. He who lives by emotions lives without principle.
2. We all have emotions, but we cannot trust them.
3. We cannot be spiritual (walk in the Spirit) and be led by emotions.
4. Emotions won't go away, but we can learn to manage them.

Make emotional maturity a priority goal in your life.

Say This:

&quot;I am well-balanced, temperate, and sober of mind. I am rooted, established, strong, immovable, and determined. I am emotionally mature.&quot;

TODAYS INSPIRATION &amp; PRAYERS
Reigning in Life through Christ
For if by the one man's offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ. (Romans 5:17)
The Lord wants us to grow in the magnificent blessing of living victoriously through Him. Having a triumphant Christian walk can only be realized from a developing acquaintanceship with the Lord, because we are only able to &quot;reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.
Significant spiritual issues are set against a victorious life: &quot;By the one man's offense death reigned through the one.&quot; Because of Adam's sin, spiritual deadness ruled over the family of man. The enemy of men's souls uses this deadness to dominate and destroy lives. Elsewhere, Jesus likened him to a thief. &quot;The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy&quot; (John 10:10). This is why lives, households, and nations experience such deadly defeats and crushing failure. A tyrant dictator, &quot;death,&quot; dominates all lives that are only born once in Adam. They can only draw upon Adam's fallen, sinful, inadequate life source.
A new and greater resource is needed and is found in Christ. &quot;Much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&quot; These heavenly provisions are &quot;much more&quot;than is needed to replace the defeats of Adam with the victories of Christ. The resources are two-fold: &quot;abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness.&quot;
One of these two is possessed by every believer in Christ: &quot;the gift of righteousness.&quot; This is the righteousness of the Lord Jesus, given to us by faith. That allows us to stand accepted before a holy God: &quot;found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith&quot; (Philippians 3:9). Every believer has this gift, but not every believer is victorious.
Thus, the key variable is to be receiving &quot;abundance of grace.&quot; Every Christian has been the recipient of grace. Yet, many of God's people do not live day by day by grace. They walk according to the flesh, thereby drawing upon Adam's natural bankrupt resources. Remember, living by grace involves humility and faith. God &quot;gives grace to the humble&quot; (James 4:6). Likewise, through Jesus,&quot; we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand&quot; (Romans 5:2).
Lord God of grace, the reign of death has certainly assailed my life, bringing defeat and failure. Teach me to draw upon the abundant measures of Your grace, that I might reign in life, living victoriously, through Your Son, Christ Jesus, Amen.

********************
In Christ, a New Creation
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation. (Galatians 6:15 )
In the relationship we have with the Lord through the new covenant of grace, there is intimacy, fullness of life, spiritual victory, and so much more. These blessings (that are not available to those who are related to Adam) are aspects of the new life that comes to new creatures &quot;in Christ.&quot;
&quot;In Christ,&quot; everything is so different from how it was &quot;in Adam.&quot; The family of man, having only natural life from Adam, puts great significance in human heritage or personal inclinations. Whether a person is a Jew or a Gentile can be of enormous consequence to many among the unredeemed community. Whether a person is religiously inclined or secularly motivated avails much with many unsaved people. On the other hand, those who have been brought into union with Christ can learn that God's perspective on such matters is vastly different. &quot;For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything.&quot;
In the kingdom of heaven, these distinctives among the sons of Adam mean nothing. Human differences do not cause the work of God or the will of God to be advanced or prevented. They avail nothing. What matters for all who are &quot;in Christ Jesus&quot; is not a &quot;human category,&quot; &quot;but a new creation.&quot;
When we come to know Christ by grace through faith, He gives us new birth. &quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again&quot; (1 Peter 1:3). We are created anew. We become a new spiritual being before the Lord. We have &quot;put on the new man&quot;(Collisions 3:10). In this heavenly kingdom of new men and women, &quot;there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all&quot; (Colossians 3:11). All that ultimately matters is that the Lord Jesus Christ dwells in all of His people, and He is wants to be all that they will ever need. All that matters is the Spirit of Christ is the living water that we have begun to partake of and that He makes us one. &quot;For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body - whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free - and have all been made to drink into one Spirit&quot; (1 Corinthians 12:13). Any person in any human category who will cry out to the Lord in faith can experience this richness. &quot;For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him&quot; (Romans 10:12).
Dear Lord, giver of new life, my heart celebrates the wondrous fact that I am a new creation in Christ. I am delighted that my old human categories could not prevent Your work of grace from being offered to me. I praise You for Your glorious grace, Amen.

*************************************************************************

Romans 8: 29 - 30
For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.

Reflection
God chose those who would believe from the foundations of the world to be justified and glorified according to His purpose. Because God foreknew all things, there is nothing that can separate His children from His excellent love and grace. Even as evil powers come against us, we are made conquerors by the justification and glorification through the blood of Christ!

Isaiah 9: 6 - 7
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.
****************************************************************************
Reflection
By the miraculous coming of Christ, the kingdom of God was brought to man bestowing all His incredible peace and joy. His dominion shall never fade but continue to increase in all its glory and magnificence. Simply the establishment of His kingdom will proclaim righteousness and justice forevermore! Indeed, He is great and greatly to be praised!
*****************************************************************************

My Utmost For His Highest

My Utmost For His Highest, by Oswald Chambers is the most used Christian devotional reading other than the Bible itself. The source for these devotionals were from various lectures given by Oswald Chambers during his life (1874-1917). After he went to be with the Lord, his wife arranged selected works of his and arranged for the publishing of this devotional. For more information, read the Foreword to the devotional.

HOLINESS V. HARDNESS Towards GOD
&quot;And He . . . wondered that there was no intercessor.&quot; Isaiah 59:16
The reason many of us leave off praying and become hard towards God is because we have only a sentimental interest in prayer. It sounds right to say that we pray; we read books on prayer which tell us that prayer is beneficial, that our minds are quieted and our souls uplifted when we pray; but Isaiah implies that God is amazed at such thoughts of prayer.
Worship and intercession must go together, the one is impossible without the other. Intercession means that we rouse ourselves up to get the mind of Christ about the one for whom we pray. Too often instead of worshipping God, we construct statements as to how prayer works. Are we worshipping or are we in dispute with God - &quot;I don't see how You are going to do it.&quot; This is a sure sign that we are not worshipping. When we lose sight of God we become hard and dogmatic. We hurl our own petitions at God's throne and dictate to Him as to what we wish Him to do. We do not worship God, nor do we seek to form the mind of Christ. If we are hard towards God, we will become hard towards other people.
Are we so worshipping God that we rouse our selves up to lay hold on Him so that we may be brought into contact with His mind about the ones for whom we pray? Are we living in a holy relationship to God, or are we hard and dogmatic?
&quot;But there is no one interceding properly&quot; - then be that one yourself, be the one who worships God and who lives in holy relationship to Him. Get into the real work of intercession, and remember it is a work, a work that taxes every power; but a work which has no snare. Preaching the gospel has a snare; intercessory prayer has none.
************

Meditation for This Evening

&quot;Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.&quot; --Lamentations 3:40
The spouse who fondly loves her absent husband longs for his return; a long protracted separation from her lord is a semi-death to her spirit: and so with souls who love the Saviour much, they must see His face, they cannot bear that He should be away upon the mountains of Bether, and no more hold communion with them. A reproaching glance, an uplifted finger will be grievous to loving children, who fear to offend their tender father, and are only happy in his smile. Beloved, it was so once with you. A text of Scripture, a threatening, a touch of the rod of affliction, and you went to your Father's feet, crying, &quot;Show me wherefore Thou contendest with me?&quot; Is it so now? Are you content to follow Jesus afar off? Can you contemplate suspended communion with Christ without alarm? Can you bear to have your Beloved walking contrary to you, because you walk contrary to Him? Have your sins separated between you and your God, and is your heart at rest? O let me affectionately warn you, for it is a grievous thing when we can live contentedly without the present enjoyment of the Saviour's face. Let us labour to feel what an evil thing this is--little love to our own dying Saviour, little joy in our precious Jesus, little fellowship with the Beloved! Hold a true Lent in your souls, while you sorrow over your hardness of heart. Do not stop at sorrow! Remember where you first received salvation. Go at once to the cross. There, and there only, can you get your spirit quickened. No matter how hard, how insensible, how dead we may have become, let us go again in all the rags and poverty, and defilement of our natural condition. Let us clasp that cross, let us look into those languid eyes, let us bathe in that fountain filled with blood--this will bring back to us our first love; this will restore the simplicity of our faith, and the tenderness of our heart.

A PERSONAL PRAYER REQUEST

I have a personal prayer request. Before we went to church today, our TV went out on us &amp; we couldn't watch InTouch by Charles Stanley, our washer &amp; dryer is about to go out, our hot water heater is leaking &amp; tomorrow we are suppose to have 45 mph. or more winds &amp; I'm afraid of high winds for they come off of the ocean. I'm not worried about the hot water heater for we rent &amp; the maintanence man will fix it but he can't come out until sometime this week.

My sister, Maxine Bentley

I'm asking for prayer for my sister, Maxine Bentley. She became very sick in a Dollar Tree Store last Friday and started vomiting up blood from an ulcer that burst. After the doctors did some tests, they discovered that two ulcers were wrapped around a tumor. She will be operated on tomorrow at Scared Heart Hospital in Pensacola, FL. Please pray that the tumor will not be cancer. My sister, Margaret, Mark, and I will be going tomorrow if the Good Lord is willing. Thank ya'll for reading all my requests. Love, Brenda

Prayer request for Judy, Tammy, Summer &amp; Frances

I would like to request prayer for Judy who is still recovering from pneumonia. She needs God's strength to help her completely get over all of this junk and illnesses that she has been going through for the last few months.

Her daughter, Tammy, missed three days of work last week taking care of Summer. Summer has been ill and now Tammy has it. It is so much harder on Tammy with her being pregnant.

She and her husband aren't together any more so it is really hard on her taking care of Summer and working full time. She needs a touch from God.

Also, please continue to pray for Frances. The liver doctors told her that her kidneys were quitting and that the kidneys were dehydrated which was why she swelled up so bad. They are suppose to do a sonogram of her leg tomorrow to see if she has any blood clots since one of them is so much larger than the other. Please continue to pray for her. She says that the staff at St Luke's isn't as good as it was at Methodist Hospital.

Thank You and God bless---Gwen

Rejoice and be glad in this day; for it is the day that the Lord has made.

I need your prayers

I trust you have had a great weekend and ready to face another week. I know
many of you are having overwhelming problems. It seems that there is an all
out attack on the body of Christ. That is why it so important to pray one
for another. At least twice a day I ask the Lord to bless each of my email
friends, and to answer each prayer request.

I have one more week of school and then the State Exam Monday the 19th. The
devil is trying to take me out, but by the grace of Jesus and your prayers I
shall prevail. Yesterday morning I felt like I may have had a light stroke
or ear infection. But for hours I kept trying to pass out, my head felt like
it had air(no not hot air, ha, ha) and today I have felt light headed, and
nausea. I have a slight head ache, and my ears are ringing real bad. I
can't go to he doctor because I have to finish this school. Tomorrow I have
physical assessment so I need your prayers. And know that I am praying for
you.
Have a blessed week in Jesus name.
Charles.

He has some health problems and needs to go to the VA hospital the end of the month. But his faith is as strong as ever. His mother will take him to the hospital. He is the young man so many of you prayed for and he was delivered from alcohol several years ago. Please pray for him once again so he can have a way to keep going church.

Rachael is pregnant and has shingles needs prayer~ Schuljean

kathleen.poor@att.net

I wanted to ask if some of your friends could say a prayer for Richards girlfriend Rachael. Rachael is now about 6 weeks pregnant and very sick. Yesterdays update was that she has shingles which is very dangerous for the fetus and they had done a spinal tap on her and it didn' close so she is leaking spinal fluid and now has to remain flat on her back. She is suffering from vertigo and morning sickness along with everything else. The doctors are afraid that the shingles are going to go into her spine and may cause menengitis and they are not sure what damage has already been done to the baby.

I spoke to her mother yesterday and she is afraid she might lose her daughter, Richard has been asked to stay away for the time being, so he is very upset also. It isn't helping that I am in Hawaii again so I felt the best thing we could do for them all is pray.

If you could include them in your prayers I would really appreciate it.

I will talk to you soon.

Love

Prayer Request--Sharon's mother--from Pearlie

brothermiller1@charter.net

My Brothers and Sisters In Christ,

Sharon is a dear Christian lady and friend. Her husband Harrison is a pastor and they are just good folks.

Please remember Sharon's mother in prayer and also ask the Lord to comfort and strengthen Sharon and all family members during this very difficult time. Her mother is a Christian and the family realizes that this may be God's timing to take her home to heaven, but they don't want her to suffer and naturally, they'd like to she her health restored and get to enjoy her presence for a good while to come, but not if she is going to have to live in misery.

If you have time and a desire to do so, share with Sharon: Revsteege@cs.com a few brief words of encouragement. Please don't be offended if she doesn't have time to reply since she works a full time job, is a busy wife of a pastor, and she is spending as much time as possible with her mother. Please share this request (just forward it) with others who will pray.

Thank you,

Brother Jerry H. Miller / brothermiller1@charter.net

When my life was ebbing away, I remembered You, Lord, and my prayer rose to You, to Your holy temple. Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs. But I, with a song of thanksgiving will sacrifice to You. What I have vowed I will make good. Salvation comes from the Lord. Jonah 2:7-9
