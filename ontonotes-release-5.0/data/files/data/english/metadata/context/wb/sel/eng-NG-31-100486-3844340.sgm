Last night I went to put my car in and it just would’nt start, it made
like a clicking noise and then like it was about to start and it would
shut off. After trying about 15 minutes and checking the battery ( it
was fine and all the lights in the car were on normally)a whirrrrr
like noise was coming from the car. I got tired and  left the car
alone for about 10 minutes tried it again and after the 3rd or 4th
time it started. My car just had a major tune up about 2 weeks ago.
WHY is it doing this ???????? It happened before about a year ago, the
same thing and the lights would flicker on and off. That time the
battery was leaking fluid, this time the battery does’nt seem to be
dirty or anything, HELP PLEASE

Check your battery terminals for corrosion, GM side posts are famous
for this little trick.  The positive cable is the most likely culprit.
User a small wire brush to clean the surface of the cable that
contacts the battery.  a 5/16" inch battery tool will come in handy.
Be sure to wear eye protection.
