Hi,

Our cat is seriously ill. A week ago we noticed that he started limping and
we took him to the vet.
There they x-rayed his front right leg and found that he has a tumor by the
joint. Then our vet refered us to a specilist who would proceed further with
our cat.

The diagnosis: Bone lysis in radius that may be secondary to cancer,
infection, or cyst. Low platelet numbers. Our cat went through surgery, the
bone was fixed with a bone plate and the area packed with bone graft. The
bone marrow biopsy was taken to delineate the cause of the low platelet
numbers.

It's been a week after that surgery, and now we know the result of the
biopsy. Our cat has bone cancer. The doctor's recommendation is leg
amputation, with following chemotherapy.

We know it is all too much for a little creature we love so much. He's only
3 years old. We haven't yet decided what to do. Whether our cat should have
his leg amputated is a difficult decision. We know that it is necessary for
our cat's survival that the amputation be done. But how will life be for a
three-legged cat?

We are not aware of any cases similar to what we are facing with our dear
cat. Please let us know if you have experienced any similar situations. We
need to decide soon. Thank you for your time.

Hi,

I'm sorry to hear about your beloved cat. I have not had experience with
this type of cancer in cats but I have lost several pets to cancer and I
understand your confusion.

I recently saw a TV show that had a piece about a cat whose leg was
amputated due to cancer. The cat seemed to be doing well and the owners
thought they had made the right decision.

You might also ask your vet if he could give you the numbers of a couple of
clients who have animals who have gone through this procedure. They will be
the greatest source of help.

I wish you and your cat luck.
Christina

"/> 3-legged cats do just fine, though especially when it's a front leg
that's missing you have to take care to keep their weight down, as their
jumping kit (back legs) are intact but the landing gear (front legs) is
not.

So long as the vets are confident that the cancer isn't a secondary from
elsewhere (as far as they can be - nothing is 100%) I would have the leg
amputated, and hope that cleared the cancer and I could look forward to
many more happy years with my cat.

"/> my grey cat had injection site-induced fibrosarcoma, the kind that spreads
everywhere. it fixed onto her left front leg. the doc said that this kind
of cancer is very aggressive, and that even amputation might not stop the
cancer.

i'm a big believer in quality of life. my cat had all four legs up until
she died. the tumor between her shoulderblades was as big as a grapefruit,
and she could barely move when we had the vet come to the house and put her
to sleep. but she had two operations, and when she was first diagnosed, our
vet said she probably wouldn't live more than a few months. she lived for
two years after being diagnosed. so my advice to you is to do the
operations and be agressive with treatment, but always ALWAYS keep quality
of life in mind. there is doing everything you can for your friend, and
then there is doing everything you can that just drags out the suffering.

in my case, i chose what at the time i thought was four months of being able
to use all four legs over maybe eight months of having to get used to three
legs at the end of a twelve year life. and i got 24 months of all four
legs. pick a time when your cat is resting, and turn off the TV and the
radio, and just sit there and look at your cat without crying for five or
ten minutes. try to understand what your cat would ask you to do. just try
to get a feel for what is right. if you end up doing chemo and the cat is
miserable on chemo, it might be time to sit down with the cat again and
think about if it's the right thing. you have to follow your heart. just
do what you honestly feel is right, keeping quality of life in mind, and
then when all is said and done don't second guess yourself and beat yourself
up. so long as you do what you feel is right, that's all anybody can ask
for.

man... i sure miss my grey cat. she was a really cool cat. she used to
follow me from room to room. if i was watching TV, there she would be right
next to me. then if i got up to go to the bathroom, even if she was asleep,
she'd just get right up and follow me into the bathroom, even when she was
12 years old. she wouldn't watch me or anything, it wasn't like the kittens
are, &quot;Whaddya doin now? Whatddya doin now? What about now? Now whaddya
doin?&quot;, she'd just be like, &quot;were are we goin'? the bathroom? ok, now
we're chillin in the bathroom&quot; like it was *her idea* to begin with to go
into the bathroom. and 30 seconds later, when i went back to watch more TV,
she'd follow me right back in there and plop right back down where she had
been, and go right back to sleep. &quot;OK, kickin' it by the TV again.
whatever dood, i'm witchoo.&quot; she was a kickass cat.

man i miss that stupid cat. hey god, i'll make you a deal. you give me
that cat back for a year, and i'll cut off my left hand. that's a bargain
right there. i'd fuckin do it too. just try me god.

i sure miss that cat.
