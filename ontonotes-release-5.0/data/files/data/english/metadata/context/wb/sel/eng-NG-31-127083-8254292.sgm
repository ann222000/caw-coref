Day 7 on patch - Revenge of the Stressies - Part One

I verbally ripped off a coworkers head about an hour ago. Was it
called for? No. Did it feel good doing it? No. Did it express my
frustrations with an assigned task? Yes. Had I expressed these
frustrations before? Yes, on multiple occasions. Is this related to my
recovery? Probably, maybe, maybe not. Almost came down with a migraine
last night, caught it in time though, in-laws sniping didn't help the
situation either.

And as this is day 7, first week done of patch, I should be
celebrating... but my current mood is this...

I could cheerfully grab the next person who criticizes my actions,
apply ten thousand shallow cuts with a rusty razors, apply a liberal
bath of salt and jalapeno juice. Then for fun, set their genitals on
fire, and force them into a cage with gorillas and rabid badgers who
have been hopped up on steroids, crystal meth, and spanish fly. All
the while listening to Michael Bolton moaning on an infinite loop
audio feed.

That would be a good start.

As from the immortal words of Joss Whedon, 'This is my Gandhi
impersonation.' Splat. 'Gandhi?' 'Yeah, he was pissed off too'. (You
get a geek point if you know exactly what series that was from)

The habit kept me from dealing with these things, I could use it to
escape the stress. The crutch kept me from actually dealing with these
situations. Work stress, money stress, traffic stress, general life
stress. It was a reactive response to stress to smoke, and now I
realize that recovery is an ongoing proactive action. Until my
reactions for dealing with these stresses become manageable, I will
still be in recovery. And that does not matter if I have a nicotine
patch on or not. There is no plausible escape from these any of the
stressful situations, only my reactions to them.

However... the next person who tells me what I should do, (unless I've
directly asked them) will get their hair parted by my lecture on the
difference between what Should and Could is!  And will I apologize for
verbally ranting at them? Possibly. At the top of my lungs while a
group of people hold me down.

This is my last quit.

I'm still here,
Pike

Holy Jeebus Pike!

Great rant! You've still got your sense of humour and that is worth a
great deal.

All I can say is, you've got it nailed down -- you know where you are
and where you're heading.

It WILL get better!! Trust me!

You're doing great and BIG CONGRATS ON FIRST WEEK DONE! Superb!

Keep posting too!

Cheers and High-Fives,
Marvin

Dispose of the body? I've got other plans, I prefer to think of them
as 'living tissue and organ donors', I'm sure I could get a good price
for the corneas alone, (providing they survive the papercuts) on the
black market.

GAH! Random thought... and question. This may sound utterly stupid,
but better to ask the stupid question than not and be stupid
alltogether...
I have liquid smoke to add to my cooking for that hickory flavor,
anyone with before/after taste differences with that product? It's
quite potent stuff, one drop in a big crockpot full of chili, or two
batches of chicken fajitas and it has this nice hint of smoked
flavor.  And smoked salmon... GAH!!

that.  You probably can negotiate a deal with the BDU about saving the
organs for $$$ and split it with them.  Contact Becky for the next
available slot.  &lt;G&gt;  I do hope the Yodeling Gnomes will be helpful
too.  They are great at kicking shins and other body parts that hang

Yes, this has been an evil overlord kind of day, sorry for scaring
people, and I will still need thwacks upside the head if I start
spouting junkie behaviour. You have my full permission, just get in
behind it, use your hips, angle that clue bat for full impact.

All will be well when I get home put my feet up, and geek out. As well
as consuming some mass amounts of protein. Feeling the viking genes
kicking in, craving roast pork, or souvlaki... greek vikings? Pillage
the village! OPA!

Who knows what other strange cravings can I expect? Only the hunger
knows.

By the way, SilkQuit has the timer feature, but it's not that
accurate, as it goes over a 24 hour cycle, not the waking hour time.
Know what I mean? It counts off the cigarettes if I was smoking during
my sleeping hours... and I'm quite sure my wife would say something if
I was sleep-smoking. Anything with a little more precision? Or am I
just wanting that Quit meter to go a little faster?

Oh yeah, one last thing, when pillaging a village it's always, always,
always, loot before burn.

Pike! THis fine rant gets a 9.9 from the Croata judge. All that raw
feelings, and (almost) no use of profanity, very eloquent. Maybe a
tiny dash less processing and less artsy camera work will get it a 10.

But for the conclucion, here is a 11!!!!!! Last quit. It's all that
matters. COngratulations on that decision and on weathering the storm
of the first week. Calm seas are ahead, and behind them, The Island Of
Smobriety, where beer ..... nah, you fill the picture yourself :-)

I really need to get the whole series in the omnibus collection.  Maybe that
will be my 11M reward.  I still haven't got Steve to read them yet, but at
least I got him reading.  He only reads and re reads and re re reads all the
David Eddings books and R A Salvatore books.  But with his memory, he can't
remember them when he's done anyway.  lol

We were smart and let Gramma take the kid to the ex and pay for it too.
Couldn't afford it after the trip to Chicago.  Was sad to see it all torn
down on my way to work this morning.  sigh.  Maybe next year.

&gt;And as this is day 7, first week done of patch, I should be
&gt;celebrating... but my current mood is this...

&gt;I could cheerfully grab the next person who criticizes my actions,
&gt;apply ten thousand shallow cuts with a rusty razors, apply a liberal
&gt;bath of salt and jalapeno juice. Then for fun, set their genitals on
&gt;fire, and force them into a cage with gorillas and rabid badgers who
&gt;have been hopped up on steroids, crystal meth, and spanish fly. All
&gt;the while listening to Michael Bolton moaning on an infinite loop
&gt;audio feed.

&gt;That would be a good start.

&gt;As from the immortal words of Joss Whedon, 'This is my Gandhi
&gt;impersonation.' Splat. 'Gandhi?' 'Yeah, he was pissed off too'. (You
&gt;get a geek point if you know exactly what series that was from)

&gt;The habit kept me from dealing with these things, I could use it to
&gt;escape the stress. The crutch kept me from actually dealing with these
&gt;situations. Work stress, money stress, traffic stress, general life
&gt;stress. It was a reactive response to stress to smoke, and now I
&gt;realize that recovery is an ongoing proactive action. Until my
&gt;reactions for dealing with these stresses become manageable, I will
&gt;still be in recovery. And that does not matter if I have a nicotine
&gt;patch on or not. There is no plausible escape from these any of the
&gt;stressful situations, only my reactions to them.

&gt;However... the next person who tells me what I should do, (unless I've
&gt;directly asked them) will get their hair parted by my lecture on the
&gt;difference between what Should and Could is!  And will I apologize for
&gt;verbally ranting at them? Possibly. At the top of my lungs while a
&gt;group of people hold me down.

&gt;This is my last quit.

&gt;I'm still here,

&gt; I really need to get the whole series in the omnibus collection.  Maybe that
&gt; will be my 11M reward.  I still haven't got Steve to read them yet, but at
&gt; least I got him reading.  He only reads and re reads and re re reads all the
&gt; David Eddings books and R A Salvatore books.  But with his memory, he can't
&gt; remember them when he's done anyway.  lol

Start him off on Heinlein, then he can get the taste of Robinson, then
you'll have him hooked. And if he's not remembering what the story
was... it's definitely not for him. A good book should be like an old
friend, you come back several years later and you go over it with a
new perspective, enjoying every minute.

Yeppers the first week can be a real roller coaster experience
regardless what what NRT you are using to some degree or the other and
if you are doing CT then you ARE a Viking!
