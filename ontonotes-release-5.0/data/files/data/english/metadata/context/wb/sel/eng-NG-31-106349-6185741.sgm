Easier then under "Bantu Education"?!

Read what he said.  It certainly does speak about *matric pass
rates* and then he speaks about a school with 672 pupils.  In that
context.  But then he does seem to have comprehension problems.

I didn't, fortunately, have any experience of "Bantu Education".
But I do have experience of the current low standards for so-called
matriculants.

As I said, doubtless many questions.  Which one were you thinking
about?

But don't let that stop you living up to what you demand of others. If
it's the case that I live in some kind of moral or logical cesspit
there's nothing to force you to plumb my depths.
