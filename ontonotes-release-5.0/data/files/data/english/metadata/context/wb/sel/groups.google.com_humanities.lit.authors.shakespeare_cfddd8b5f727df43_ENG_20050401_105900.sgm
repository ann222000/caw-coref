NO KIDDING! CASTLE TO SUFFER FOOLS GLADLY
Published in News &amp; Star on Friday, April 1st 2005

Fools rush in: Jonathan the Jester, top, will host the Fool Factor
contest at Muncaster Castle, above, in June. He said Muncaster had an
important place in the history of court jesters
By Anna Burdett

JESTERS will return to Muncaster Castle after more than a 300-year
absence as part of a national contest.

The Pennington family, which owns the castle near Ravenglass, wants to
bring some medieval mockery back to the castle grounds and today
launched a competition to find a modern-day Tom Fool.

The family have placed an advert in The Stage magazine to launch the
search.

Peter Frost Pennington said: &quot;Muncaster's jester, Tom Fool, was the
inspiration for the Fool in Shakespeare's King Lear, giving the word
'tomfoolery' to the English language. So it seems appropriate that we
should once again have an official Fool.

'This may be April Fools' Day but we're certainly not joking. This is
a genuine competition for a very important position.&quot;

The contest, dubbed Fool Factor, will take place on Friday, June 3 at
Muncaster Castle when 'wannabe' jesters will be asked to show off
their skills, including comedy, magic, juggling and acrobatics during
a 10-minute act.

The event will be hosted by Jonathan the Jester, a spokesman for the
British Guild of Jesters.

He said: &quot;Muncaster Castle has an important place in the history of
jesters. We don't currently have any members in the north.

&quot;So we hope this contest will not only find someone to follow in Tom
Fool's footsteps, but also prove that there are as many fools in the
north of England as in the south.&quot;

The winner will hold the 'Fool of Muncaster' crown for a year, win
£350 in cash and receive part-payment in ale.

Mr Frost Pennington added: &quot;Politicians are barred. We feel they would
have an unfair advantage in a competition to find the best Fool, but
anyone else who spends lots of time fooling around should put their
skills to good use and compete for this prestigious title.&quot;

Contestants must be over 18.

Tom Fool Knot

&lt;&lt;This is sometimes considered as a Handcuff Knot but is somewhat inferior
for this purpose to the knot which usually bears that name. It is a good
knot with which to commence a slightly fancy Sheepshank. It is also used as
a trick knot (it can be tied in a flash in almost a single movement) and is
sometimes called the Conjurer's Knot.&gt;&gt;

Tom Fool: 1953 Horse of the Year

&lt;&lt;Tom Fool's name stems from his dam's, Gaga, which is a slang term for
foolish, or crazy. A daughter of top sire *Bull Dog, Gaga had produced the
Champion Juvenile Filly Aunt Jinny a year before Tom Fool was foaled at the
Manchester Farm on March 31, 1949. The bay colt known as Tom Fool was bred
by Duval A. Headley, who as a trainer had saddled his sire, Menow, to upset
War Admiral in the 1938 Massachusetts Handicap. As a yearling, Tom Fool was
sold privately for the sum of $20,000. His future trainer, John Gaver,
didn't even think his client would want the colt when he tangled with a
fence and cut his leg. He was wrong, and the sale was completed. The buyer,
John Hay Whitney, better known as Jock, was the co-owner of Greentree
Stable. Jockey Ted Atkinson, whose mounts included the classic winners
Capot, Nashua, and Hill Gail, as well as Horse of the Year Coaltown and the
hot tempered Man o' War colt War Relic, also ranked Tom Fool as the best
horse he was ever associated with, saying:

&quot;Tom Fool, though, you could always depend on, and he could run like hell.
On his best day, none of the other horses I ever rode, on their best days,
could measure with him.&quot;

Early in 1951, Tom Fool suffered from cracked heels, therefore trainer John
Gaver wasn't able to send him out to make his racing debut until after
Saratoga opened in August of 1951. The colt then broke his maiden at first
asking, cantering to a four length win. Tom Fool's final start came in the
[1953] Pimlico Special. Even without a serious challenge, he broke Capot's
track record, going a mile and three sixteenths in 1:55 4/5 while Navy Page
nosed out Alerted in his wake. Ted Atkinson described his mount's
professional performance:

&quot;He just wanted to run. I wasn't worried about any challengers. When Alerted
closed in on us at the far turn, Tom Fool just responded the way I knew he
would and pulled ahead.&quot;

The brilliant Tom Fool had remained unbeaten in ten starts that year,
earning $256,355. The season's leading money winner was Native Dancer, who
had earned $513,425. The Dancer, however, had the benefit of earning large
purses in the classics, taking home $82,500 in the Belmont Stakes alone. Tom
Fool, on the other hand, was limited to the Handicap division, where even
the most important races couldn't rival the purses offered to
three-year-olds. Tom Fool's sweep of the Handicap Triple Crown paid
$104,100, while Native Dancer earned $157,700 with two firsts and a second
in the three-year-old series. For his accomplishments in his final season,
Tom Fool was named Horse of the Year, Champion Handicap Horse, and Champion
Sprinter.

Standing at Greentree Stud outside of Lexington, Tom Fool at first showed no
interest in the mares sent to him. The frustrated stud grooms turned him out
with a farm mare, who attempted to teach the naive colt the facts of life.
It didn't work. Therefore, it was announced that the champion would not
cover any mares that year, for &quot;undisclosed reasons.&quot; But once Tom Fool
began his stud career in earnest, he was a top sire. His offspring included
Ogden Phipps' 1966 Horse of the Year Buckpasser, Calumet Farm's dual classic
winner Tim Tam, and thirty-four other stakes winners, including Jester,
Tompion, and Weatherwise. He is also the broodmare sire of 1975 Kentucky
Derby winner Foolish Pleasure, the champion mare Late Bloomer, Irish Derby
winner Meadow Court, and eighty six additional stakes winners.

Tom Fool passed away on August 20, 1976, and is buried at Greentree Stud. He
was honored by induction into the Hall of Fame in 1960. The NTWA named him
&quot;Horse of the Decade,&quot; and The Blood-Horse ranked Tom Fool eleventh on their
list of 100 top horses of the twentieth century, three spots above his great
son Buckpasser.&gt;&gt;

TOM FOOL AND THE LOVERS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -
----
Abridged from &quot;The Ill-fated Lovers&quot; in &quot;Tales of the English Lakes&quot; by
William Armistead (1891)

&lt;&lt;According to custom Sir Allan Pennington had a jester, whose name was
Thomas Skelton, but whose common appellation was Tom Fool of Muncaster. But
I shall have occasion to mention him in the course of my story; as he
performed a tragical part in it- rather too much so, to be enumerated among
the drolleries of a common jester. I will, however, give you the tale as I
have often heard the parson repeat it to an old maiden aunt of mine, with
whom I was brought up; and who never heard it without a copious flow of
tears.

The morning was most delightful (this was the parson's uniform way of
introducing the story), when the level beams of the sun first gleamed on the
smooth surface of Devoke Water, and informed the joyous villagers that it
was the First of May. The wooden clogs were stripped from the feet of the
blooming damsels, and the leathern shoes, which had been carefully preserved
from the preceding year, and many of which had adorned the feet of their
mothers and grandmothers, were taken out of the paper which enveloped them.
The oil with which they had been rubbed twelve months before was polished by
the warm hand to a fine gloss. Every garden was robbed of its bloom to form
garlands and chaplets in order to beautify what could not be beautified; for
what- the parson would say, looking languishingly at my aunt- could add
beauty to a Cumberland maiden ?

The Maypole was reared in a delightful meadow on the banks of Devoke Water;
and the maidens blooming in beauty, and the youths bounding in health,
repaired thither from the surrounding cottages. As the festive dance
com­menced, the soul of innocent gaiety began to expand. The festoons of
flowers waving from the Maypole, and the garlands of the damsels, all gently
agitated by a slight breeze, gave a gracefulness to the scene which no
language can describe. It seemed as if the exhilarating breath of spring
gave elasticity to the youthful limb, and a higher zest to the spirits, as
the lively music gave emotion to the nimble feet of the light-footed
dancers.

At the first pause in the dance every eye was attracted towards a most
heavenly maiden, attired in the simple garb of a Cumberland shepherdess. She
came tripping along the meadow in the full glow of her beauty, and, with a
smile, joined the maiden circle. Every tongue was inquiring, &quot;Wha is she ?&quot;-
and every eye was eager to obtain a glance of her charms. Several of the
most respectable shepherds offered to lead her to the dance, but she
modestly refused. Among the rest Wild Will of Whitbeck, as he was generally
called, urged her to favour him with her hand.

&quot;I only came,&quot; said she, &quot;to be a spectator of these innocent gaities; and,
should I share in them, I should wish to procure a more modest partner.&quot;
&quot;A modest partner !&quot; exclaimed Will, &quot; yan et darn't luik at ya; yan etle
stand eating his thooms, and just whisperen la doon, 'will ya dance?' A poor
feckless thing et darn't lait [seek out] a sweetheart withoot its minny ga
wi' it.&quot;
&quot;You will please to leave me, shepherd,&quot; replied the maid, &quot;and carry your
raillery to other ears where it may be more agreeable.&quot;
&quot;I'll hev a kiss furst,&quot; said Will, &quot;for that canny feace and filed tongue
hez quite laid ma ith brears.&quot;
&quot;Forbear your rudeness, for God's sake,&quot; cried the damsel; &quot;or you may
repent it.'&quot;
&quot;By all the powers of love and beauty,&quot; exclaimed the carpenter's son,
stepping up at that moment, &quot;unless he stands off he shall repent it. Will
you take a dance with me, fair maiden?&quot;
She willingly complied. But the elder and more ex­perienced part of the
company said they observed a glance pass between them, which said they had
met before. This renewed the inquiry who the damsel might be, but in vain.
Will retired in a gloomy rage, swearing that he would dis­cover who the girl
was, and have revenge on the carpenter, if it cost him his life. The lovers
heard not his threats, but repaired to the May­pole; and, as they danced
around it, sang the following roundelay :-

&quot;What are monarchs' courts, my dear?
Can their splendour yield them bliss?
Can the thrones and crowns of kings
Yield a joy as sweet as this?
Dancing round the Maypole!&quot;...

Various were the conjectures respecting the unknown shepherdess; though all
the country maids agreed that she was not what she seemed.
&quot;Be wha she will,&quot; said Wild Will of Whitbeck, &quot;I'll hunt it oot.&quot;
&quot;She's niver worth it,&quot; observed a girl, who probably thought Will might
employ his time better. But Will was not to be driven from his purpose. And
some of those who had been refused by the fair unknown urged Will to make
his promise good. Therefore, when the evening drew on, and the young people
began to pair off towards home, Will, and two of his companions who were not
more agreeably occupied, followed Richard, the carpenter's son, and his
lovely partner, towards home. But little did they expect to see her
sheltered in Muncaster Hall. As the lovers stood exchanging vows of eternal
constancy at the garden gate, their pursuers heard enough to inform them
that the maid was Helwise, daughter of Sir Allan Pennington; and to convince
them that their faith was mutually plighted.
&quot;Now,&quot; said Will, &quot;I hev him o' the hip. For Sir ...
