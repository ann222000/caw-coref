Motor Question... Who Makes Grainger's Motors?

Anyone know who manufactures the &quot;42C&quot; style motors for Grainger?  They
appear to be pump motors and only come in 1725 or 3450 RPM flavors...  I'd
love to talk to someone about what else might be available...  But
Grainger's list is very limited in both HP and RPM offerings.

A good example of one I'm looking at is Grainger's part #3N842

They appear to be GE motors with the Dayton name but... Knowing this group,
somebody knows the answer for certain.

If they're induction machines your choices are limited.  Basically you
get (line frequency in RPM) / ((motor poles)/2) - slip.  So you have
3600/(2/2) - slip = 3450, 3600/(4/2) - slip = 1725.  There are some six
pole motors out there, giving you a tad less than 1200 RPM, but they'd
be hard to find.

Of course, you could move to France and choose between 3000, 1500 or
1000 RPM, but I don't think that's what you meant...

If you want more flexibility you need a VFD with (probably) a
three-phase induction motor, a DC motor with controller, or a _really
big_ brushless motor (i.e. synchronous motor) with the correct drive.  I
know the theory; someone who knows practice will soon chime in with part
numbers, I hope.

Why limit it to France, AFAIK all of Europe is 50Hz and would give those
speeds. Must be some historical thing but when I moved back to the UK in
1982, many people seemd to be of the opinion that the US still ran on DC.

Back in the late 70's Japan was 50Hz in part of the country and 60Hz in the
rest.  Don't know if they harmonized it by now.

We use the 56C face motor line almost exclusively now and find 3450, 1725,
and 1140 RPM motors readily available from 1/3 HP up to around 2 HP.  Above
2 HP, they are a bit harder to get a hold of...  But what I really want to
find is a motor that isn't 6&quot; or larger in diameter and the Grainger motors
I've held in my hand and used from time to time are exactly that...  But
with a 42C face...

So...  Basically, I'm on a quest for a 42C face motor suppler that offers up
to 2 HP models and 6&quot; or less in diameter...  Slim chance, I know, but ya
never know!  I can always special order them, but keeping a fast delivery
timeframe is crucial for most of my customer's orders...

My needs are in the size arena rather than the speed arena for the most
part...  But the info you provide is very good and appreciated.

Sounds like us with the 208V issue in some older cities, etc...  Most of us
have true 230/460...  But some are stuck with 208...  And if you go north,
some of Canada has this funny 550/600V issue.  &lt;grin&gt;

Graingers changes suppliers of their Dayton branded
motors from time to time.  There is no guarantee the
motor you buy today will be the motor you buy to-
morrow.  They simply change the descriptor (which
is the single letter at the end of the part number)
which is the same thing they do when changing a
material, color, or some other minor &quot;improvement.&quot;

Unfortunately sometimes the changes they make
should actually require a different part number
because the newly &quot;upgraded&quot; part will not
function properly, in the required application,
as we &quot;found out the hard way&quot; on multiple
occasions.

The lure of Graingers low prices and availability
is great but for an OEM to depend on them is a
stretch, IMHO.

Good point and thus my search for the motor manufacturer that supplies
Grainer with the specific motors I seek...

Might as well hijack my own thread now...  Suppliers sometimes work hard to
be &quot;backward compatible&quot; and sometimes they don't work at it at all...

We have improvided our design on our basic product 3-4 times in 10 years...
And machine #1 will receive 99.9% of my new parts without modification.  We
try very hard at it...    ....Mostly because *I* don't want to have to
figure out how to fit a new part on an old machine in order to keep a
customer happy when their line is down and they are loosing lots of money a
day...

It would really suck if a motor manufacturer we use went out of business and
they are the only people making a certain frame / size motor.  We've only
had one motor manufacturer mess us up in this way and it was Baldor...  Hard
to imagine considering we use much less famous motor manufacturers on other
jobs, but they moved the junction box of a small single phase motor to the
side of the motor from the back of the motor...  So much for the clearance
issue I thought didn't exist...
