I now have all of my eight point star blocks completed and started to
sew the rows of blocks together.  Oops, I am having a very hard time
stitching over the "bumps".  As I completed sewing each block I
carefully pressed the seams of the block in whichever way would lay
the flattest.  It would have been great to think this thing all the
way through and have seams pressed in opposite directions where they
join the next block.  It may be too late for that now.  So, what can I
do to get the blocks together?

Howdy!

Put the tip of your finger in the middle of those
multi-seam intersections and spin it around; the seams should splay out
and lie down flatter.
If this doesn't work, I was never here. &lt;g&gt;

Good luck, Jerry.

Ragmop/Sandy --  handpieced and handquilted a DoubleWeddingRing quilt
before anyone told me "piecing curves is hard!"  &lt;g&gt;

p.s. Another tip: those long rows of blocks can stretch and seem to
go on forever as you're putting them together; instead of long rows
I like to divide the quilt blocks into 4 sections; sew all of section 1
together, then section 2, then sew section 1 to section 2; complete w/
3 &amp; 4; there's less tugging in one direction and the quilt is more
balanced w/ long seams running in both directions, left/right, up/down;
just a little something else I learned from Mary Ellen Hopkins:

That's such a great lesson I'm grateful to have learned here.  I'm putting
together a king-size waterbed quilt (groan) and know that the volume of this
beauty is more than I can handle.  I was just so tickled to remember to do
this circus tent size quilt in sections.  By only dealing with 4 blocks by 4
blocks, that gets it down  to something that won't kill my assorted wobbly
old shoulders and other body parts.
So often, instructions direct assembly 'row by row'.  Sure.  If nothing
else will work.
Thank you,  Ragmop and Mary Ellen for showing us another way. By doing
the top in sections, I'll only have to heave the whole thing through the SM
one trip.  I'll get help.  High-level bribery will be involved.  Chocolate
cake ought to do it.   Polly

You might like to think about pressing the seams open, instead of to one
side, Jerry.  No pre-planning required then &gt;g&lt;
Pressing planning is great in theory.  I am a great planner, but I have
never managed to do this!

Nothing bad will happen if you just flip a seam here and there as you sew!
And if it won't press neatly into place, you can snip the seam allowance
very carefully to let it go in both directions.

Your best bet might be to sew sashing to
the blocks. If you want them real close
together, just use very narrow sashing
in the same color (or value) as the
background of the blocks. Of course that
would mean you have to unstitch what
you've already joined! So, grab a beer
or a tea and just do it. Grins,

You can buy another seam ripper.  There are at least 5 or 6 worn out ones
here.  I wonder why I keep them?  Polly

Hmmm... Weeding between paving stones?
Saw a magazine article on decorating with "found" objects, such as a
collection of rusty old cheese graters on your kitchen wall. The rippers
would be so appropriate for the sewing room. You could do a little wall
hanging and embellish it with old rippers and hole-y thimbles and dull
safety pins. Some people's rust is other people's patina.

Howdy!

I love this woman!

Polly, the suggestion of chocolate cake is perfect.  I'm thinking
chocolate (Tx) sheet cake, the Tx. version of the recipe calling for strong
coffee in the batter; homemade frosting, yummmmm!  On a chilly..okay, for
*some* people this is cold!-- snowy, sleeting, rainy day in n.Tx.
some new fabric fresh from the dryer and a homemade cake in the oven
is just The Thing.

The technique we're talking about, sewing the top together in sections,
has saved more than a couple of quilt tops for me.  And a bit of sanity.
This type of piecing means only one long seam thru' the center of the
quilt; cuts down the distortion, the pulling of the blocks side-to-side,
and having to schlep that top back and forth so many times.

King-size waterbed?!!? Yikes!   Are you nutz?!!?  &lt;G&gt;
Of course we don't expect an (honest) answer to that.  And of course
one of the things I enjoyed about the waterbed (ours was queen-size)
was that the quilt/bedspread/coverlet didn't have to drape down the
sides of the bed, just had to go from edge to edge.
...sometimes I miss the waterbed, just flat sheets that stuffed into
the sides of the mattress, drawers underneath the bed were so convenient
and lifted the bed to a perfect height; but OH! how cold that bed would
get when the heater died or when we moved and set up the bed and it took
a day or two to warm up the water.

Happy Quilting!

Ragmop/Sandy- w/ apologies to Jerry for the rambling--but that's RCTQ ;-D

Thanks to all the help you ladies gave me in this forum, I completed
sewing all of my blocks together today without any major disasters.  I
noticed that some of edge pieces on several of the blocks were
stretched quite a bit and I was really nervous about how the next step
would go.  I sewed the twenty five blocks into five rows and with a
little tugging my block points matched up pretty nice.  Most of the
misses are small enough that courteous views will not mention them.  I
even got my five rows sewn together and am ready to start working on
attaching the three borders.  One of the borders is pieced flying
geese and I'm holding my breath until I find out that my flying geese
units will match the length and height of my quilt center.

This sure is fun.  It is probably more fun for me because I do not
have a clue about what I am doing.  I have discovered that an eight
point star patter with flying geese border is a much tougher project
than Tumbling Blocks that I did for my first project..
