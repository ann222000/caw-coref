Heal the Planet, Heal Ourselves
*********************************
by Katherine Stapp / NEW YORK

Ten years ago, Costa Rica received a modest 25,000-dollar United
Nations grant to expand the use of biomass technology, which transforms
the energy from organic matter into fuel.

Today, the Biomass Users Network of Central America operates in seven
countries and administers multi-million-dollar projects, with the
ambitious goals of spurring rural development, preserving natural
resources and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to
global warming.

It is this kind of success story -- merging sustainable development
with environmental protection -- that must be replicated around the
world if humanity hopes to ease the shocking poverty afflicting
billions of people around the world, experts say.

&quot;It is becoming clearer every day that the degradation of ecosystems
and the spectre of abrupt, unpredictable, and possibly irreversible
global environmental change threaten decades of development effort,&quot;
says Olav Kjørven, director of the Energy and Environment Practice of
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

&quot;Dramatic rises in consumption of ecosystem services -- including fresh
water, capture fisheries, air and water purification, and
climate-regulating services -- have brought greater prosperity to many
people around the world,&quot; he notes in the foreword to a new report,
&quot;The Sustainable Difference: Energy and Environment to Achieve the
MDGs&quot;.

&quot;But they have also brought about greater poverty and marginalisation
as a result of depletion and even destruction of such key services,&quot;
Kjørven adds.

Released Wednesday, the publication details the UNDP's efforts in 140
countries to incorporate energy and environmental issues into national
development plans, and spells out the agency's strategic vision of what
remains be done in these sectors in order to meet the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).

The eight MDGs include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger;
universal primary education; reduction of child mortality by
two-thirds; cutbacks in maternal mortality by three-quarters; the
promotion of gender equality; the reversal of the spread of HIV/AIDS,
malaria and other diseases; environmental sustainability, including
access to safe drinking water; and a North-South global partnership for
development.

A summit meeting of 189 world leaders in September 2000 pledged to meet
all of these goals by the year 2015. In a few weeks, heads of state
will again gather at the United Nations headquarters in New York to
assess progress toward the goals thus far.

&quot;Everybody is still thinking of energy and environment as not related
to sustainable development,&quot; Iyad Abumoghli, a manager in the Energy
and Environment Practice and a lead author of the report, told IPS.

&quot;What we're trying to demonstrate in this book is that the protection
and management of environmental resources is essential to achieving all
of the MDGs,&quot; he said. &quot;We must engage local communities in managing
their own natural resources, which also provide them with sustainable
livelihoods.&quot;

Some two billion people lack electricity, while another one billion
have no access to safe, clean drinking water, Abumoghli noted.

&quot;In terms of the MDG progress reports, the most important message is
that most of the countries have not yet integrated energy and
environment into their development plans and poverty reduction
strategies,&quot; he said, &quot;and the cost of environmental protection
measures is a very important factor.&quot;

In South America, the Rio de la Plata, home to globally significant
biodiversity and an engine for commercial fisheries, tourism and
transportation, is struggling with growing pollution from hydrocarbons,
heavy metals and other industrial waste, as well as sedimentation and
habitat degradation.

Although Argentina and Uruguay, the two countries through which the
river flows, had separately taken steps to address these problems, they
had failed to target the causes of cross-border pollution because there
was only limited understanding of how the whole ecosystem functioned.

With funding from the UNDP unit of the Global Environment Facility
(GEF), the two countries are now conducting a &quot;transboundary diagnostic
analysis&quot; that will lay the basis for an action plan to improve water
quality and cut pollution.

East Africa is another area of high global priority for biodiversity
conservation, the report notes. Despite well-intentioned efforts to set
aside lands for parks and protected areas, the region is still losing
much of its natural biodiversity as a result of population pressures
and over-exploitation of land resources.

Because governments simply do not have the economic or institutional
capacity to reach all remote villages, engaging a wide range of civil
society groups is viewed as critical in solving the problem.

Three countries -- Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania -- have been
collaborating on an initiative called the East African Cross-Border
Biodiversity Project, which seeks to reconcile the socioeconomic
interests of local stakeholders with the sustainable use of
biodiversity.

The World Conservation Union also developed a project that empowers
East African community-based organisations to participate in forest
planning and natural resource management processes.

One such group, VI-Uganda, focused on training people in the skills
needed to improve banana cultivation, make compost manure, protect the
soil, adopt the practices of zero grazing and agroforestry, and produce
crafts. It also helped set up tree nurseries and teach schoolchildren
to plant trees in the Sango Bay Forest reserve.

And in Asia, the UNDP continues to focus on conservation of the Western
Pacific marine ecosystem, which covers 38.5 million square kilometres
and is home to 14 &quot;small island developing states.&quot;

The region hosts the most extensive and biologically diverse reefs in
the world, the world's largest tuna fishery, and an array of globally
threatened species.

A two-part project involving oceanic fisheries management and
integrated coastal and watershed management saw a major success in June
2004, with the ratification of the Convention on the Conservation and
Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central
Pacific, the first regional treaty based on the 1994 U.N. Fish Stocks
Agreement.

The second component of the project, set to conclude in December 2006,
is addressing the root causes underlying the unsustainable use of
coastal resources, the ongoing degradation of freshwater resources and
poor waste management.

While UNDP has dedicated some seven billion dollars to these and a wide
variety of other national programmes, Abumoghli says that there is
still a huge funding shortfall. &quot;It's time to scale up our operations.
Environment must be included seriously in the anti-poverty equation.&quot;

He also noted that investments in environment and energy promote gender
equality at a number of levels.

&quot;More than 70 percent of our projects involving small grants of up to
50,000 dollars -- to rehabilitate grazing land, drill wells, etc -- are
with women,&quot; Abumoghli said.

&quot;In most countries, women are the managers of environmental resources,
whether it is taking care of a farm or collecting energy sources like
firewood. So gender issues are very important.&quot;

&quot;If we provide better energy and water resources, we provide women with
other opportunities, saving time for them to enhance their own
capacities in terms of health and education,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a holistic
approach that we want the world to listen to.&quot;
