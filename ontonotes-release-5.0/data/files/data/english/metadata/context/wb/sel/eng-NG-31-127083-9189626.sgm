Well, Ladies &amp; Gents, Leslie has just picked up her last thing from my house
and gone from my life forever.  I got tired of waiting for her decision so I
told her she has to tell me by yesterday (Friday) of her intentions.  She
called me yesterday and told me she still loves me, she is still in love
with me, but she needs more time.

I told her I ran out of time.  The bell has sounded.  The Whistle blew.  And
no decision means nothing to me.  I told her I will pack everything she owns
in my house and she is to pick it up this morning.  I am not going to make
it a long story, but she came with the couple that we know mutually, and
helped her get everything.  The funny thing is the couple, separately, told
me I am so much better this way.  That's how Leslie is, whatever the hell
that means.  Both of them asked me &quot;Why do you think she has been divorced 4
times&quot;?  FOUR times!  I did not know that.  These people actually are her
cousin and her husband, so they've known her much longer than I have.  They
both told me she is making a big mistake.  I am the best guy she ever had in
her life.  I don't mean to blow my own horn, but I am one of the few nice
guys left.  Well, that doesn't matter, and only an opinion, mine mainly.

On any rate, I am very sad right now.  Sad &amp; Lonely.  It's too early to call
my very few friends, but I know I can ALWAYS count on your support.  I am
going to delete her email address form all my accounts.  Delete her from my
cell phone, so I am not tempted to send a text or a phone call.  I really,
REALLY, don't want to have any contact with her, and made sure to her that
to her face.

Thank you all for listening to me and watching me pour salt on open wounds
and try to lick them.  You are the only ones I know that will support me.
And this will be the last of mentioning her name or posting about her.

Today I will make a new beginning in life. The second half anyway.

BTW, still Smober and Sober and very proud.

Thanks for ALL the advice, opinions, and messages you guys sent.  Uh-Oh,
some liquid is coming out of my eyes.  Gotta go.

Love ya all

AZ

AZ, what a tough time to go through, but the good news is, you get to move
on and allow yourself to still be a nice guy with a person who deserves
you. My husband and I were married for 22 years, divorced for 5, and now
have been remarried for 5 years. You know what? He's a nice guy too. There
aren't many of you left :)

Let those watery things fall from your eyes and allow yourself some time to
grieve... then move on to the new and wonderful life you have ahead.

AZ - Just count yourself lucky, lucky, lucky that all she stole from
you was a piece of your heart. You can, and will, recover and find a
better person to share your life with. I know it isn't easy right now,
but deception would eventually have corroded the relationship anyway.
You are dealing with this in a very realistic way. I'm proud of you.

AZ said : &quot;......And this will be the last of mentioning her name or

AZ, its ok to talk about her here or not - We're hear to listen...I
know those timies when you need to express those emotions - better you
spill them here to those who care about you, then to bottle em up, and
be tempted to 'calm' them in other ways i.e. smoking.
Good job in NOT smoking - that SURE ISNT EASY.......But YOU DID
IT....AND   A R E   DOING IT.
Its perfectly normal to feel sad and grieve and cry - its ok.
In time, it will be better............but right now.......it SUCKS ..i
know.

We  loved smoking.
But it was based on lies.

The lies were:
1)we loved it.
2) We enjoyed it.
3) We looked cool.
4) It was harmless.

We enjoyed it, but it really was not good for us.
So we got rid of it, despite being addicted to it.
There were not many things we could replace smoking with, and we felt
some emptiness and resentment.

However, there are..how many now..7 Billion people?
The half that is our preferred sex is 3.5 billion.
Let's reject 99.9% of them.
That leaves 3,500,000 candidates.
Let's reject 90% of that, just for distance issues.
There are 350,000 applicants for the position.
Let's reject 90% of that Just Because...
35,000 waiting to hear from you.

You did the hard thing, you quit one self-destructive habit already.
This one only FEELS like it is killing you.

GREAT post!!!!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We  loved smoking.
&gt; But it was based on lies.

&gt; The lies were:
&gt; 1)we loved it.
&gt; 2) We enjoyed it.
&gt; 3) We looked cool.
&gt; 4) It was harmless.

&gt; We enjoyed it, but it really was not good for us.
&gt; So we got rid of it, despite being addicted to it.
&gt; There were not many things we could replace smoking with, and we felt
&gt; some emptiness and resentment.

&gt; However, there are..how many now..7 Billion people?
&gt; The half that is our preferred sex is 3.5 billion.
&gt; Let's reject 99.9% of them.
&gt; That leaves 3,500,000 candidates.
&gt; Let's reject 90% of that, just for distance issues.
&gt; There are 350,000 applicants for the position.
&gt; Let's reject 90% of that Just Because...
&gt; 35,000 waiting to hear from you.

&gt; You did the hard thing, you quit one self-destructive habit already.
&gt; This one only FEELS like it is killing you.

Wow Lynn,
I wondered when you were going to speak up!  &lt;grin&gt;

Sorry AZ, I wouldn't have put it quite the way she did but I'm thinking your
thinking is a bit distorted here.  I can't remember if you are a friend of
Bill's or not, but we have this awesome thing about &quot;taking inventory&quot; and
getting to &quot;my part&quot; and - well, *I* found it to be very invaluable when I
was looking at a split.  For some reason I thought I got the rough end of
the deal, but after doing my homework I realized that I had gotten exactly
what I asked for because I was stuck in selfish thinking.

However, the majority of people don't understand that, or want to...  and I
guess it doesn't work for them.  Pointing fingers and blaming and telling
others all about how wronged I have been (or finding others to agree with
me) never made me feel better, and still doesn't.

With hope and heart,
Kathleen

Congrats and stay this way!^^^^^^^

Just a bit of advice I have to offer to you about Usenet...
Offering up your personal life on Usenet can bring out some pretty harsh
and cold judgments at times - probably best to head to chat with a few
of your buddies from this group to discuss in a more private setting or
via email.

Cheerios,
and good on you for not smoking.
Keep posting those quotes too!

OMG You just had too eh Lynn? When AZ thanked us all for
watching him lick his open wounds I don't think he meant: 'go
grab the salt' hun. But I see your point.

I was just thinking a lot of the same things. What if this story was
turned around? What if Leslie quit smoking and posted here she
met this great guy she loves very much, but she felt she was being
pressured into marriage number five and needed some time to
figure things out, wouldn't we all tell her she was smart in doing so?

And what if this guy Leslie fell for dated other women while she
needed more time to make up her mind? Wouldn't most of us tell
Leslie to run faster than Forrest fuckin Gump on speed? And yet
most posts I read here all say AZ handled things so good. Guess
there is more than one way to read a story.

Well,  we prolly can assume AZ already knew not everyone here
thinks the same and there are enough posts to counter balance this
one. And if not, it's still not worth drinking or smoking over.

I agree with Robbb (give or take a b &lt;grin&gt;) This is UseNet
for fuck sake. Don't post things like this on Usenet if you can't take
stress, coz some people *will* tell you what they think. If you drop
trou here, bend over and spread yer cheeks, you have to assume
sooner or later someone will get along that can't resist temptation
and poke ya in the butt.

You're here to quit smoking AZ. We tell people here to stay away
from stress. You might want to take Robbb's advice. What ever
you do, stay sober and smober!

I think it may be our duty to each other to point out when we're
hurting ourselves.
I know I've had to have my feelings hurt more than once to get a
message.
Call it &quot;tough love&quot; or what ever.
I appreciate when someone takes me off to the side to set me straight,
rather than embarrass me in front of the whole group.
But if in front of the group is the only way I'll get it, please give
it.
When I first got here I did a bunch of bitching about my wife.
One of these woman should have straightened me out.
I was being selfish and selfcentered and it took several weeks for me
to see it.

Tell me your not saying that it was up to us to have to police what you say?
Once you or any man/or woman for that matter, says negative things about
your spouse it show us all what kind of a person you really are.
Yes granted we all have bad days and fights with our SO and even bitch about
it here,and it will get swept under the rug, but it is not my job to tell
you to wisen up. In fact I don't even remember what you might of said but
apparently it played on you and hence the third line of your post.
We do give slack to new quitters. we were all there at one point and know
the emotions that we go through. Yes I could of been more diplomatic... but
that isn't me. I try honestly but I have a quick flash point.

&gt;&gt; Well, Ladies &amp; Gents, Leslie has just picked up her last thing from my

&gt;&gt; she is still in love with me, but she needs more time.

&gt;&gt; I told her I ran out of time.  The bell has sounded.  The Whistle
&gt;&gt; blew.  And no decision means nothing to me.  I told her I will pack
&gt;&gt; everything she owns in my house and she is to pick it up this morning.
&gt;&gt;  I am not going to make it a long story, but she came with the couple
&gt;&gt; that we know mutually, and helped her get everything.  The funny thing
&gt;&gt; is the couple, separately, told me I am so much better this way.
&gt;&gt; That's how Leslie is, whatever the hell that means.  Both of them
&gt;&gt; asked me &quot;Why do you think she has been divorced 4 times&quot;?  FOUR
&gt;&gt; times!  I did not know that.  These people actually are her cousin and
&gt;&gt; her husband, so they've known her much longer than I have.  They both
&gt;&gt; told me she is making a big mistake.  I am the best guy she ever had
&gt;&gt; in her life.  I don't mean to blow my own horn, but I am one of the
&gt;&gt; few nice guys left.  Well, that doesn't matter, and only an opinion,
&gt;&gt; mine mainly.

&gt;&gt; On any rate, I am very sad right now.  Sad &amp; Lonely.  It's too early
&gt;&gt; to call my very few friends, but I know I can ALWAYS count on your

&gt;&gt; Thank you all for listening to me and watching me pour salt on open
&gt;&gt; wounds and try to lick them.  You are the only ones I know that will
&gt;&gt; support me. And this will be the last of mentioning her name or
&gt;&gt; posting about her.

&gt;&gt; Today I will make a new beginning in life. The second half anyway.

&gt;&gt; BTW, still Smober and Sober and very proud.

&gt;&gt; Thanks for ALL the advice, opinions, and messages you guys sent.
