I f you are looking for glass in the Austin, TX area DO NOT USE Ace glass
!( Ace Discount Glass)
After ordering 7 pcs of glass and 2 windshields and being quoted $ for
windshields
and being avoided on the price of the flat glass . I had to call , they had
forgot ! Finally after
several hours glass installer get here and finds 1 windshield is wrong one
so now another
2 hours wasted . Find out from installer bosses son had quoted me prices and
has been fired ?
Have to leave for a while come back to find glass guy gone and bill almost
double of what it should have been . Call owner (Ray ) he seemed to figure
that it cost him a days labor so I can pay . The glass had also not been
edge ground (sharp edges ) and had many chips on edges (substandard in my
opinion ).
I highly recommend NOT using Ace Glass there are many other reputable glass
places in town
as Binswanger quoted me less than 1/2 for the flat glass ,, unfortunately
after the fact .
I guess their customer are suppose to pay for their errors ? Or maybe he
feels we should just pass it on to our customers!!!

In article &lt;7mqcm5$ ... @journal.concentric.net&gt;, &quot;CLASSIC AUTO WORKS&quot;&lt;class ... @concentric.net&gt; babbled on and on:

Thanks for the heads-up. It sounds like they gave you a windshield out of a
wrecked car, where they pried it out of the channel with a screwdriver and
nicked it all over.
If you paid more than $175.00 installed for a used windshield, you were ripped
off.
You do not have to pay a bill that is double what was quoted. That is called
&quot;bait and switch&quot; and should be reported to the A.G.'s office.
Also, I think the law is that quotes can not be charged more than 10% over the
price quoted for repairs. You might want to check on that as I could be wrong.
If you stop payment on your check, immediately file with the police dept. a
complaint, because if they get to them first, you will be charged with &quot;theft of
service&quot;. Its who gets to the police first and files first that wins, no matter
who is right. I know. :-(
