Success at last. It's been a long while since I have had a win.
Actually, it's been a long while since I have gotten as far as the
Minotaur. Silly me... I keep dying in stupid ways. Anyway, I've been
attempting to get a win as a rogue for many games now (far too many to
count), and was finally able to complete this goal.

Bob began the game with moderately useful equipment, but not enough to
give me any real confidence in his ability to survive. He started with
a cursed floppy hat, cursed leather armor, a torch, a book of blades,
and a tome of utility. I like the tome of utility... preserve is a very
useful spell, but I hadn't had a chance to try any other spells beyond
dig and force bolt. Also in the room was a shield and... oh ho... a rock.
The rock turned out to be a holy +1 rock, and I kept it quivered
through the entirety of the game. I considered it to be my lucky rock
(I should have named it), as it actually took down quite a few enemies
throughout the game.

I was able to complete the ranger dress kit pretty early in the game
(around level 4 or 5, I think), so Quizar took very good care of me.
The added bonus of the kit (auto detect/evade traps / auto search,
keep most arrows) was a great boon to me early on, although I didn't
find any arrows that were not cursed until I was already deep within
the labyrinth. I also found a named short sword around the same time
that was my primary weapon through the entire game.

I was well prepared for the detested cockatrice before I reached their
depth (having preserved a couple of slugs and collected some acid
potions). As they are one of my primary character killers, I always
get a bit nervous facing them without an item of unchanging or resist
stoning. Â Ironically, I was only hardened twice in the game... both
times came after I had already found an amulet of unchanging. Klaskov
saved me both times before I could do anything about it (I prefer to
save the piety for something else, if I can).

I got the opportunity to play with spells I had never used before.
Force wall was by far my spell of choice. It decimated the Minotaur,
and kept me alive in a lot of mob fights in the lower levels. Blizzard
was also a lot of fun, and I enjoyed Sunfire as well.

As I spent a majority of the game invisible and silent, I was able to
observe the path finding of the AI a bit. Just so you know, a water
elemental will quite happily wander around on lava until it dies.
I was never able to complete Belweir's puzzle, as I was unprepared in
the scroll department.

Quizar's level was quite a bit more difficult than I had anticipated.
I was accosted by a gang of named earth elementals as soon as I had
gotten off the stairs. They tore the hallway apart, letting in great
rivers of lava. I was able to kill them off, but not before I was set
aflame. As I had no fire resistance, I was in a bad spot. I opted to
equip a mirror shield of life saving in case I could not put myself
out in time (was down to 9 hp at the time). I put myself out by
throwing a bottle of holy water against the wall. However, I got the
message &quot;your shield sears you,&quot; died, and was brought back by the
life save. I found it a bit ironic that I was saved by the thing that
killed me.

Big B decided to face me on land this time. I nailed him with a
blizzard and a force wall. After that, he went down with only 2 whacks
of my sword.

As I said before, I followed Quizar through the entirety of the game.
I was well loved by him and Klaskov. I was able to stay on the good
side of Belweir and Tlosh through most of the game (Belweir even
granted me a spell). I was hated by H'ruth and Pax, so my weapon /
armor enchantments never stayed in place for long. Onto the data of
interest!

I had the opportunity to get 2 more pieces of artifact armor on
Quizar's level, but they were guarded by 2 named Water Elementals in a
dead end hallway. I opted out of that fight. Now it's time to see if I
can make a working cleric!

Some other observations:

Creature path finding and AI need some work yet. It's still too easy
to create mob fights by making sure that a spell caster is behind the
enemy. Creatures are also quite eager to commit suicide by walking in
places where they should not.

If you are blind, you probably should not be able to &quot;look&quot; at other
things around you (like your opponent).

After the horrors of Quizar's level, H'ruth and Klaskov's levels seem
far too easy. Maybe Quizar's should be right before the lair of Big B?
Anyway, loved the rivers of lava and acid, as well as the surplus of
named elementals and acid dragons. Maybe something like this is the
trick for making the Big B fight more challenging.

Once you have the dress code, it would be nice to know what it grants.
Suppose that takes a bit of the fun out of it.

I like the 2 force spells... pity there isn't an entire spell branch
devoted to them (like there is for fire/ice/lightning). Reminds me of
the Force Mages from the old RoleMaster games. Yeesh... just dated
myself again...

One more thing, before I forget:

I've noticed that the last 2 iterations of Powder have been a bit hard
on my GBA SP. Once I would get into the labyrinth, my system would
start to &quot;hang&quot; at odd intervals. Normally it was when I was trying to
move... the system would appear to freeze for a couple of seconds.
During this time, it would ignore key presses (i.e. if I press left
twice when it had &quot;hung,&quot; these actions were not queue after the
system came back). I don't recall if it happened at any other points
(like in the sub-menus or in the inventory). I was never able to
determine if it became more prevelant due to dungeon depth, or if it
was more related to number of items in inventory.

It might be my equipment as well. I have an old 256mb flash cart that
has already gone nuclear on me once. My GBA SP is one of the origional
revs (with the button that turns the lcd backlight either on or off,
as opposed to bright or blinding), and is beginning to get a bit
twitchy. Sometimes I'll go to move one step in a direction, and it
decided to move 2 or 3. This, obviously, has resulted in a few
accidentaly fights with things I really didn't want to attack (like my
good friend Mr. Kiwi).

I've recently lost my 256mb flash cart, an EFA Linker, so now i'm
playing the DS version, but i noticed the same problem while i was
playing 087 in my GBA SP, or in my NDS in GBA mode.
I suppose Powder is getting a little too complex for our little friend
GB.

If this happens once per dungeon level, I believe I know the culprit.

Unlike Nethack that tracks a list of &quot;in-transit&quot; monsters, monsters
in POWDER are always on some map. Â This means when they fall down a
hole the next level would be generated. Â Generating a level can take
some time on the GBA, so the whole system will freeze. Â (Actually, for
a while it also would go black to add a bit of heart-stopping action
to the event :&gt;) Â On my to do list is to put up a message during
dungeon building so it is less surprising.

On earlier levels it seems to generate faster and there are less
holes, so you likely only generate new levels when you explicitly
climb the stairs (and when this delay is less noticeable) Â However, as
you delve deeper, it starts happening while still exploring.
