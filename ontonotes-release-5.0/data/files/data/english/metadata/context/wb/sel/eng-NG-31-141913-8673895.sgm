Dear Friends and Colleagues,
It seems to me that Bill McKibben is too mild-mannered here, yet
maybe this is the most that a twerpy-hustler publication like National
Geographic will tolerate.
In any case, it's important to point out that quite a few
relatively well-qualified people think that it is already too late to
save the Greenland and West Antarctic ice-caps.  Some of them say
general solar-system heating is a major exacerbation of human-caused
effects on this planet.
So we're putting together a panel of astronomy/physics amphibians
to get an assessment of this.  For if it's indeed too late now for
those ice-caps, we'll have to start compiling a long list of current
activist causes which thus have become too-little-too-late.
From earlier McKibben writings it's clear he has no conception of
the promise of such solution energies as Zero Point and Cold Fusion.
In this critically important regard he is as quaint as, say, someone
who still thinks 9/11-as-an-Inside-Job is a conspiracy theory rather
than a conspiracy fact.
Nevertheless, I think he would respond openly to a persuasive
presentation on behalf of these (and perhaps other) solution
energies--and I hope that one can be arranged for him relatively soon.
After all, he has quite a following these days.
Also I feel a personal link to him: the most recent of my sixteen
arrests was with Bill and thirty others seven years ago in DC on
behalf of campaign finance reform.  I found him quite genial.

Yours for solution energies,

Keith Lampe, Ro-Non-So-Te,

PS:  To say &quot;The past couple of years have seen a series of reports
indicating that 450 parts per million CO2 is a threshold we'd be wise
to respect&quot; is a breathtaking understatement!!!  I can hardly believe
it!!!  It's even worse than the sort of understatement David Brower
used during the '70s and '80s as part of his Faustian Bargain with
corporate media.

The Carbon Crisis. By Bill McKibben, The National Geographic Magazine,
October, 2007 issue. &quot;It's impossible to precisely predict the
consequences of any further increase in CO2 in the atmosphere. But the
warming we've seen so far has started almost everything frozen on
Earth to melting; it has changed seasons and rainfall patterns; it's
set the sea to rising. No matter what we do now, that warming will
increase some -- there's a lag time before the heat fully plays out in
the atmosphere. That is, we can't stop global warming. Our task is
less inspiring: to contain the damage, to keep  things from getting
[further] out of control... The past couple of years have seen a
series of reports indicating that 450 parts per million CO2 is a
threshold we'd be wise to respect. Beyond that point, scientists
believe future centuries will likely face the melting of the Greenland
and West Antarctic ice  sheets and a subsequent rise in sea level of
giant proportion... If concentrations [of atmospheric CO2] keep
increasing by two parts per million per year, we're only three and a
half decades away...  As precedents for [massive] collective effort
[that will be required of us],  people sometimes point to the
Manhattan Project to build a nuclear weapon or the Apollo Program to
put a man on the moon. But those analogies don't really work. They
demanded the intense concentration of money and intelligence on a
single small niche in our technosphere. Now we need almost the
opposite: a commitment to take what we already know how to do and
somehow spread it into  every corner of our economies, and indeed our
most basic activities... We need  to figure out how to change [our
energy intensive] habits. Probably the only way that will happen is if
fossil fuel costs us considerably more... The most straightforward way
to raise the price would be a tax on carbon... switching away from
taxes on things we like (employment) to taxes on things we hate
(global warming). That may be too much to ask for -- but if it is,
then what chance is there we'll be able to take on the even more
difficult task of persuading the Chinese, the Indians, and all who are
lined up behind them to forgo a coal-powered future in favor of
something more manageable?... In the end, global warming presents the
greatest test we humans have yet faced. Are we ready to change, in
dramatic and prolonged ways, in order to offer a workable future to
subsequent generations and diverse forms of life? If we are, new
technologies and new habits offer some promise. But only if we move
quickly and decisively--and with a maturity we've rarely shown as a
society or a species. It's our coming-of-age moment, and there are no
certainties or guarantees. Only  a window of possibility, closing fast
but still ajar enough to let in some hope.&quot;

Outrageous
Treatment to Students Exercising Free Speech

by Debbie Lewis

Global Research, September 18, 2007

The actions of the University of Florida campus police, the
professors, and John Kerry are utterly appalling!

This video, http://youtube.com/watch?v=6bVa6jn4rpE , clearly shows a
blatant abuse by campus police powers and their ignorance of our
Founding Documents.

This article, http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,297197,00.html , by
FoxNews, and this site, http://www.theandrewmeyer.com/ , explain what
is going on. I will not try to explain, as what is going on is clear.

The University of Florida, including the students and teachers at this
forum should be put on notice for the abuse of Andrew Meyer. As far as
can be told by this video, all this young journalism student did was
ask a question, the answer of which is common knowledge. The students
and professors here obviously need to be versed in freedom of speech.
The actions of the campus police officials are tantamount to police
state actions.

John Kerry, on the other hand, should have had the decency to stop the
abuse of this young man, as Mr. Kerry knows, by virtue of his service
to our government, including his oath of office, everyone's rights
under our Constitution and Bill of Rights.

While John Kerry wants (or wanted) to be President of the United
States, he clearly cannot handle the job, as he doesn't understand
basic freedom of speech. Yes, he did say he would answer the question
posed by this young man, but he did nothing to stop his abuse and
ultimate tasing. If he ever wanted my vote, he should have done the
right thing and stood up for the rights of Mr. Meyer. In choosing to
ignore the plight of Mr. Meyer, he showed us that he has no regard for
our most basic of rights.

My first reaction to this horrifying video was &quot;this can not be
happening!&quot; My next reaction, as I continued to watch, was utter shock
that no one offered Mr. Meyer any assistance what so ever. This is a
twenty-one year old student exercising his Constitutional Right of
Freedom of Speech. What is it that this college campus does not
understand about this? Why did this college campus allow their
student, Mr. Meyer, rights to be abused? Why did this college campus
allow its campus police to taser this young man? Who should answer or
be held responsible for such horrible behavior of Mr. Meyer?

Everyone that holds our rights dear should be utterly outraged by the
actions of the University of Florida and its campus police. It is our
duty to call this University out and hold them accountable for the
actions against this student. I challenge everyone to do his or her
duty and make this despicable action known around the country. Defend
Mr. Meyer and his rights. It could be one of us, next!

The Power of Laughter
by Paul Krassner

I spent this past weekend at the 11th annual Earthdance celebration, a
global festival for peace held in northern California, uniting with
over 250 locations in 50 countries, providing a wide variety of live
music, workshops, speakers, inspiration and a worldwide sense of
community.

On Saturday, I was among a large group of men and women participating
in the International Elders Forum.  Each one had six minutes to share
their wisdom with an overflowing crowd in the huge Electronica Dome.
A native American, David of the Blackfoot tribe, would play the flute
after five minutes of talk as a signal that there was one minute left.

When my turn came, I began, &quot;Whatever wisdom I have to share is in the
form of comic relief, but just remember, if you don't laugh you're
only helping the terrorists.&quot;  After seven minutes, I still didn't
hear any notes from the flute, so I decided to pass the microphone on
to the next person.

On Sunday afternoon, David told me that he had been laughing so hard
he simply couldn't play his flute.  He tried again and again, yet the
best he could do was spit into it.  Of course, this was gratifying
feedback to a stand-up satirist, but over lunch our conversation
became deadly serious.

Last November, he wanted to sell a piece of equipment, and a man who
saw the ad invited him to his apartment.  There, David was told to
help himself to a soda from the refrigerator, which he did.  When he
turned around, four guys--biker/skinhead/Aryan-Nation types--burst
through the door and attacked him with 2-1/2 inch metal pipes, first
striking him on the forehead, then beating and kicking him while
calling him a &quot;dog&quot; and a &quot;prairie nigger.&quot;

He tried unsuccessfully to defend himself and finally dove out the
first-floor window, landing in a carport.  He pounded on somebody's
door--yelling &quot;9-1-1!&quot;--and collapsed in a puddle of blood.  He
regained consciousness in a hospital where he got 40 stitches for a
cracked cranium and a head brace for his broken neck.  His shoulder
and hand were also injured.  He was rescued by a friend and stayed at
her home to heal.  He could no longer do physical work, but she has
since helped him open a small business.

Two weeks after the incident (the night before Thanksgiving), police
arrested David for missing a court date on a traffic violation.  He
had missed the date because he was unconscious in the hospital.  At
the Sonoma County jail, the guards kicked him, removed his head brace,
refused him all medical attation, placed him in solitary confinement,
forced him to sleep on a concrete bed without a mattress, and did not
allow him to shower for six days.  They eventually brought him to
court, chained to a wheelchair.

After he was released on probation, the district attorney demanded
that David testify against the skinheads.  Knowing the nature of the
Aryan gang, he immediately expressed concerns about his safety,
regardless of what his testimony might be.  A couple of months later,
the DA agreed to place him in a witness protection program.  It turned
out to be at the Pink Flamingo, a hotel in Santa Rosa, the same city
in which he was attacked.

On the third day, he walked out of the hotel and saw a bunch of bikers
and skinheads outside.  Not knowing they were there for a tattoo
convention, he panicked and smoked a cigarette in his no-smoking room.
For that offense, he was taken out of the witness protection program
and left homeless, afraid to put anyone he knew in danger.  The DA
made it very clear to him that &quot;We have ways to make you testify.&quot;

The day before the trial, David was arrested again, on the way to the
Indian Health Center, for driving with a suspended license.  Again, he
was denied medical attention, his head brace was removed, and he was
thrown into solitary confinement.  A week later, he was again brought
into court chained to a wheelchair--unbathed and looking like a wild
Indian--and threatened with three years in jail.  The DA was in the
courtroom at his sentencing, pow-wowing directly with the judge.

Immediately before the sentencing, David's friend stood up and asked
to speak out on his behalf, since his court-appointed lawyer had done
so little to defend him.  With the bailiff bearing down on her and
contempt of court looming, the judge surprisingly agreed to let her
talk.  She stated how jailing David was cruel and unusual punishment,
because he would have to be placed in solitary confinement throughout
his incarceration in order to avoid any contact with Aryan gang
members, due to his status as a hate-crime victim.

Moreover, he was in violation of driving with a suspended license only
because he couldn't afford to pay the fines; his injuries prevented
him from being able to work in his chosen field to earn the money to
pay those fines.  Was driving with a suspended license actually worth
three years of anyone's life, or was there another agenda lurking in
the courtroom that needed such leverage to pressure David into
testifying against the assailants?  Was it justice to, in effect,
condemn him for the heinous crime of poverty?

The judge weighed the case and the next day released David on
probation, warning him not to drive.  Almost a year later, the DA is
still hounding David by phone and subpoena, putting his life in danger
by coercing him to testify.  And where was Victims Assistance during
all this horror?  A Victim Witness Advocate told David, &quot;I can't help
you.  You're on probation.  Our hands are tied.&quot;

Since David was a victim, he does not have the right to an attorney.
He was due to appear in court on September 18, but the case has been
postponed for a month.  He plans to say in court that he will not
testify because, &quot;If concern for my safety is not addressed, I could
die.&quot;  He expects to be charged with contempt and, once again, to be
put in solitary confinement.

Whatever you can do to help extricate him from this profane injustice
would be most appreciated.  His tormenters, DA Anne Masterson and her
investigator Denise Urton, can be reached at (707) 565-2311.  You can
contact David at iamhollowr ... @yahoo.com.  I'm grateful to be in a
position to communicate the details of this nightmare, none of which I
would have known had David been able to play his flute after five
minutes of laughing.

11th Day
for Global Warming Fasting

By Kitta MacPherson
The Star-Ledger
Saturday 15 September 2007

A teaspoon of salt. Six vitamins. Ten glasses of water.

That's been Ted Glick's daily regimen since Sept. 4.

The Bloomfield activist hasn't weighed himself since he stopped
eating, but the muscular, 6-foot-1 career rabble-rouser says he has
lost 15 pounds, judging from changes in his face, upper body and gut
since he started the fast as a call for action on global warming.

Eleven days ago, about 1,100 people across the country started a
fast, timed to coincide with the first full day that Congress opened
for its fall session. Glick organized the national protest for the
U.S. Climate Emergency Council, an environmental advocacy group, to
protest what they view as the lack of action by the American
government to address the perils of climate change.

Now there are seven.

Besides Glick, there's Diane Wilson of Seadrift, Texas; Jan
Lundberg of San Francisco; Diane Thomas of Berkeley, Calif.; Chris
Freimuth of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; Esperanza Martell of New York, N.Y.,
and Toni Zeidan of Lewisburg, Pa. Some have become nauseated at points
but all are well.

Glick, 57, who weighed 210 pounds when he started, says he feels
OK and very focused.

&quot;It's a way to walk the talk, it's showing that a person who is
willing to do this is for real,&quot; said Glick, reached yesterday by
telephone at the offices of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network,
located in a three-story house in Tacoma Park, Md. &quot;It's important to
be real on this stuff.&quot;

Glick said he is still able to do light office work, write e-mails
and take phone calls.

When he tells people what he is doing, he said, people either &quot;get
it&quot; or think he's crazy. His wife of 28 years, Jane Califf , supports
him in principle, he said, but is growing worried. &quot;When I talked to
her today, I heard a lot of concern in her voice,&quot; he conceded. But,
he added, &quot;she knows who I am.&quot;

Glick said he hopes to be able to continue his protest through the
end of the month.

Humans can generally last about 60 days on a hunger strike,
provided they are drinking water, according to Leo Pritsiolas, an
emergency room physician at Clara Maas Medical Center in Belleville.
Fasting ultimately is dangerous because it robs the body of its energy
source so the body must cannibalize itself. Sugar stores are used up
in about a day, then fat, then at about Day 14, the body starts
attacking its own tissue and organs, he said. &quot;It's bad for the body,&quot;
Pritsiolas said.

For Glick, the idea is to catch the attention of Congress, and,
more important, to motivate voters to pressure their leaders to take
action.

&quot;We can't keep on waiting - our national government has to act,&quot;
he said. &quot;It's incredibly urgent.&quot;

Leaders in both the Senate and House of Representatives have
proposed legislation that would curb the emissions of greenhouse gases
and fund energy conservation measures. Some had promised that the laws
would be passed by the summer but that has not happened yet, Glick said.

U.S. Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), perhaps Congress' leading global
warming skeptic, could not be reached for comment yesterday. A
spokesman, however, pointed to scientific studies detailed in an
August report to Congress by Inhofe that the &quot;scientific underpinnings
for alarm may be falling apart.&quot;

A report by a panel of scientists convened by the United Nations
earlier this year concluded that global warming is real, caused by
mankind and must be acted upon to thwart adverse consequences,
especially to people living in some of the world's poorest regions.

Glick is expecting to return to New Jersey today to visit with his
family. He said he will return to the Washington, D.C. area next week
to lobby members of Congress.

Greenspan on 60
Minutes: It Was All Bush's Fault

By Mike Whitney
09/17/07
www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18411.htm

Alan Greenspan's appearance on 60 Minutes was preceded with all the
pomp and ceremony of a royal wedding. The public relations blitz
dragged out for a whole week.

What profound truisms would the elusive former-fed master divulge to
the News Magazine's withered-coquette, Leslie Stahl? Would he produce
his crystal ball and forecast America's blurry economic future in
mangled Fed-speak? Or would he focus on the startling gyrations in the
stock market and the &quot;frothy&quot; conditions in the slumping housing
market? The suspense was nearly unbearable.

&quot;Why didn't you stop the illegal or shady practices you knew were
taking place in subprime lending?&quot; Stahl inquired.

&quot;Err, I had no notion of how significant these practices had become
until very late. I didn't really get it until late 2005 and 2006&quot;,
Greenspan replied nervously adjusting his tie.

Hmmmmm. That's not exactly true, Maestro. In fact, here's what
Greenspan said as chairman at the Federal Reserve System's Fourth
Annual Community Affairs Research Conference, Washington, D.C. April
8, 2005.

&quot;Innovation has brought about a multitude of new products, such as
subprime loans and niche credit programs for immigrants. Such
developments are representative of the market responses that have
driven the financial services industry throughout the history of our
country. With these advance in technology, lenders have taken
advantage of credit-scoring models and other techniques for
efficiently extending credit to a broader spectrum of consumers.&quot;

Sounds like a ringing endorsement of subprime lending to me.

Greenspan also brushed aside Stahl's claim that the Fed chief was
warned by other members of the Central Bank (Edward Gramlich) about
the dangers of subprime lending.

&quot;We were not capable&quot; of doing (regulating) that.&quot; Greenspan protested
while emitting a slight-gurgling sound.

Greenspan doesn't accept any blame for keeping interest rates at
historic lows and inflating the credit and housing bubbles which are
now crashing to earth. He was simply &quot;doing his job&quot; according to
sound economic principles.

Baloney. What a grim performance by the world's greatest serial
bubble-maker.

&quot;It was our job to unfreeze the American banking system if we wanted
the economy to function. This required keeping interest rates modestly
low,&quot; Greenspan opined.

&quot;Modestly low&quot;?!?

1% interest rates are modestly low? It's a cash giveaway designed to
boost speculation.

Greenspan did nothing while mortgage lenders were doling out trillions
of low-interest candy to subprime applicants with bad credit, no
documentation of earnings, no collateral and, sometimes, no job!

Is that prudent lending?

Greenspan put this economy-busting juggernaut in motion and then
dumped the whole mess in Bernanke's lap.

What-a guy!

Listen to Greenspan on the subject of toxic CDOs (Collateralized Debt
Obligations) which have infected the stock market, triggered bank
closings, and frozen the commercial paper market.

Greenspan:

&quot;The development of a broad-based secondary market for mortgage loans
also greatly expanded consumer access to credit. By reducing the risk
of making long-term, fixed-rate loans and ensuring liquidity for
mortgage lenders, the secondary market helped stimulate widespread
competition in the mortgage business. The mortgage-backed security
helped create a national and even an international market for
mortgages, and market support for a wider variety of home mortgage
loan products became commonplace. This led to securitization of a
variety of other consumer loan products, such as auto and credit card
loans.&quot;

Another ringing endorsement, right?

The best summary of Greenspan's tenure at the Fed was written by
economist and author Henry C K Liu in his article &quot;Why the Subprime
Bust will Spread&quot;. Liu says:

&quot;Greenspan presided over the greatest expansion of speculative finance
in history, including a trillion-dollar hedge-fund industry, bloated
Wall Street-firm balance sheets approaching $2 trillion, a $3.3
trillion repo (repurchase agreement) market, and a global derivatives
market with notional values surpassing an unfathomable $220 trillion.

On Greenspan's 18-year watch, assets of US government-sponsored
enterprises (GSEs) ballooned 830%, from $346 billion to $2.872
trillion. GSEs are financing entities created by the US Congress to
fund subsidized loans to certain groups of borrowers such as middle-
and low-income homeowners, farmers and students. Agency
mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) surged 670% to $3.55 trillion.
Outstanding asset-backed securities (ABSs) exploded from $75 billion
to more than $2.7 trillion.&quot;( Henry Liu, &quot;Why the Subprime Bust will
Spread&quot;, Asia Times)

&quot;The greatest expansion of speculative finance in history&quot;. That says
it all.

Of course, the housing bubble isn't ALL Greenspan's responsibility. He
had a lot of help from greedy speculators who thought they could get
rich on someone else's money. Jim Kunstler's latest blog-entry,
&quot;SHOCKED, SHOCKED&quot; puts it like this:

&quot;But the really funny part of all this is that the media columnists
are acting as though the American public got hoodwinked by Al. Which
raises the question: just what the fuck was the public thinking when
they bought half-million dollar houses on salaries under 60-K, taking
out no-money-down, interest-optional balloon mortgages and other
tricked-up contracts? The answer is: they walked into these
arrangements with their eyes open because they thought they could get
something for nothing. They thought the trend of steeply rising house
prices would continue indefinitely and enable them to wiggle free of
any hazard by flipping their houses to an endless supply of greater
fools who would be there waiting to turn the very same trick. And the
smoothies downstream in the mortgage and banking rackets were no less
guided by avarice when they cooked up their formulas for bundling
half-baked mortgages into tranches of tradeable securities. Easy Al
may have failed to notice what was going on here, but then so did
everybody else from The Wall Street Journal to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.&quot;

This, of course, represents an insidious psychology. It could only
happen in a culture that has come off the rails mentally, so to speak,
as ours has in the sense that nobody has any sense of consequence,
neither the leaders nor those who affect to follow the leaders&quot;. (Jim
Kunstler, &quot;SHOCKED, SHOCKED&quot;)

Kunstler's right. Everyone was only-too-happy to play along as long as
there was easy money to be made. No one pondered the ethical questions
or the long-term effects on America's economic future.

Then the music stopped, housing plummeted and the stock market began
its downward death-spiral.

No one is laughing now.

Still---even though there's blame enough for everyone---it still irks
us that the wizened former Fed-chief is using his ill-deserved fame to
traipse around the country plugging his new book, &quot;The Age of
Turbulence&quot;, while blasting Bush for the policies he authored.

Here's another risible quote from Maestro on the wisdom of loaning to
people with bad credit:

&quot;Where once more-marginal applicants would simply have been denied
credit, lenders are now able to quite efficiently judge the risk posed
by individual applicants and to price that risk appropriately. These
improvements have led to the rapid growth in subprime mortgage
lendingfostering constructive innovation that is both responsive to
market demand and beneficial to consumers.&quot;

Improved access to credit for consumers, and especially these
more-recent developments, has had significant benefits&quot;.

Oh, yeah----&quot;subprime mortgage lending&quot; has &quot;had significant benefits&quot;
all right. It's nearly bankrupt the country and driven millions of
people out of their homes and into the streets. Any more &quot;benefits&quot;
and we'll all be lining up for handouts at the halfway house.

Probably the most damning indictment of Greenspan appeared today in
the Wall Street Journal in an editorial &quot;The Fed's Alibi&quot;. It states:

&quot;The Fed's easy money policies helped cause the housing bubble and
subprime crisis, and now it's being asked to solve them with more of
the same. (rate cuts)

&quot;The &quot;Maestro&quot; is far less persuasive in his explanation for why the
Fed kept money so easy for so long. He says it was to &quot;shut down the
possibility of corrosive deflation.&quot; But fear of deflation was long
gone by the third quarter of 2003, after the second round of Bush tax
cuts had passed and GDP growth clocked in at 7.2% on an annual basis.
The Fed nonetheless maintained negative real interest rates for many
more months to come. This has proven to be the great policy blunder of
Mr. Greenspan's tenure, with ramifications that are making life
difficult for Mr. Bernanke today.&quot;

Ahh, yes; now even the far-right Wall Street Journal has fingered
Greenspan as the guy who manufactured the biggest equity bubble in
history and left the nation hobbling towards disaster.

Thanks, Alan. I hope book sales are brisk.

Mortgage Laundering

The Triumph
of Structured Finance:
Failing Banks, Toxic Bonds
and Mortgage Laundering

By Mike Whitney

09/17/07 &quot;&lt; http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/ &gt;ICH&quot;

&quot;The entire global financial structure is becoming uncontrollable in
crucial ways that its nominal leaders never expected, and instability
is its hallmark. The scope and operation of international financial
markets, their &quot;architecture&quot;, as establishment experts describe it,
has evolved haphazardly and its regulation is inefficient  indeed,
almost nonexistent. Banks do not understand the chain of exposure and
who owns what: senior financial regulators and bankers now admit
this.&quot; Gabriel Kolko &quot;An Economy of Buccaneers and Fantacists&quot;

&quot;Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, is like a man who, after
spending a lifetime playing with train sets, finally gets to drive the
real thing - only to find it hurtling towards the edge of a cliff.&quot;
U.K. Observer

By now, you've probably seen the photos of the angry customers queued
up outside of Northern Rock Bank waiting to withdraw their money.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6998507.stm The pictures are
headline news in the UK but have been stuck on the back pages of US
newspapers. The reason for this is obvious---the same Force 5
economic-hurricane that just touched ground in Great Britain is headed
for America and gaining strength on the way.

This is what a good old fashioned bank run looks like---the likes of
which we haven't seen since the Great Depression. And, just like 1929,
the bank owners are frantically trying to calm down their customers by
reassuring them that their money is safe. Buthuman nature being what
it is---people are not so easily pacified when they think their
hard-earned savings are at risk. The bottom line is this: The people
want their money---not excuses.

But Northern Rock doesn't have their money and, surprisingly, it is
not because the bank was dabbling in risky subprime loans. Rather, NR
had unwisely adopted the model of &quot;borrowing short to go long&quot; in
financing their mortgages just like many of the major banks in the US.
In other words, they depended on wholesale financing of their
mortgages from eager investors in the market, instead of the
traditional method of maintaining sufficient capital to back up the
loans on their books.

It seemed like a nifty idea at the time and most of the big banks in
the US were doing the same thing. It was a great way to avoid
bothersome reserve requirements and the loan origination fees were
profitable as well. Northern Rock's business soared. Now they carry a
mortgage book totaling $200 billion dollars.

$200 billion! So why can't they pay out a paltry $4 or $5 billion to
their customers without a government bailout?

It's because they don't have the reserves---and, because the bank's
business model is hopelessly flawed and no longer viable. Their assets
are illiquid and (presumably) &quot;marked to model&quot;---which means they
have no discernible market value. They might as well have been &quot;marked
to fantasy&quot;---it amounts to the same thing. Investors don't want them.
So Northern Rock is stuck with a $200 billion albatross that's
dragging them under.

A more powerful fiscal-tsunami is about to descend on the United
States where many of the banks have been engaged in the same practices
and are using the same business-model as Northern Rock. Investors are
no longer buying CDOs, MBSs, or anything else related to real estate.
No one wants them whether they're subprime or not. That means that US
banks will soon undergo the same type of economic gale that is
battering the UK right now. The only difference is that the US economy
is already listing from the downturn in housing and an
increasingly-jittery stock market.

That's why Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson rushed off to England
yesterday to see if he could figure out a way to keep the contagion
from spreading.

Good luck, Hank.

It would interesting to know if Paulson still believes that &quot;This is
far and away the strongest global economy I've seen in my business
lifetime&quot;, or if he has adjusted his thinking as troubles in subprime,
commercial paper, private equity, and credit continue to mount?

SECURITIZATION: Is it really just Mortgage laundering?

For weeks we've been saying that the banks are in trouble and do not
have the reserves to cover their losses. This notion was originally
pooh-poohed by nearly everyone. But it's becoming more and more
apparent that it is true. We expect to see many bank failures in the
months to come. Prepare yourself. The banking system is mired in fraud
and chicanery. Now the schemes and swindles are unwinding and the
bodies will soon be floating to the surface.

&quot;Structured finance&quot; is touted as the &quot;new architecture of financial
markets&quot;. It is designed to distribute capital more efficiently by
allowing other market participants to fill a role which used to be
left exclusively to the banks. In practice, however, structured
finance is a hoax; and undoubtedly the most expensive hoax of all
time. The transformation of liabilities (dodgy mortgage loans) into
assets (securities) through the magic of securitization is the biggest
boondoggle of all time. It is the moral equivalent of mortgage
laundering. The system relies on the variable support of investors to
provide the funding for pools of mortgage loans that are chopped-up
into tranches and duct-taped together as CDOs (collateralized debt
obligations). Its madness; but no one seemed to realize how crazy it
was until Bear Stearns blew up and they couldn't find bidders for
their remaining CDOs. It's been downhill ever since.

Structured Finance: The new market plumbing springs a leak

The problems with structured finance are not simply the result of
shabby lending and low interest rates. The model itself is defective.

John R. Ing provides a great synopsis of structured finance in his
article, &quot;Gold: The Collapse of the Vanities&quot;:

&quot;The origin of the debt crisis lies with the evolution of America's
financial markets using financial engineering and leverage to finance
the credit expansion. Financial institutions created a Frankenstein
with the change from simply lending money and taking fees to
securitizing and selling trillions of loans in every market from Iowa
to Germany. Credit risk was replaced by the &quot;slicing and dicing&quot; of
risk, enabling the banks to act as principals, spreading that risk
among various financial institutions.. Securitization allowed a vast
array of long term liabilities once parked away with collateral to be
resold along side more traditional forms of short term assets. Wall
Street created an illusion that risk was somehow disseminated among
the masses. Private equity too used piles of this debt to launch ever
bigger buyouts. And, awash in liquidity and very sophisticated
algorithms, investment bankers found willing hedge funds around the
world seeking higher yielding assets. Risk was piled upon risk. We
believe that the subprime crisis is not a &quot;one off&quot; event but the
beginning of a significant sea change in the modern-day financial
markets.&quot; (John R. Ing &quot;Gold: The Collapse of the Vanities&quot;)

The investment sharks who conjured up &quot;structured finance&quot; knew
exactly what they were doing. They were hyping dog-pelts as fine mink
and selling off them to anyone foolish enough to buy them. They were
in bed with the ratings agencies----off-loading trillions of dollars
of garbage-bonds to pension funds, hedge funds, insurance companies
and foreign financial giants. It's a swindle of epic proportions and
it never would have taken place in a sufficiently regulated market.

MAKING THE CASE FOR ECONOMIC PREEMPTION

The Bush administration needs to come to grips with the &quot;systemic&quot;
problems of the current market-model and act fast. When crowds of
angry people are huddled outside the banks to get their money; the
system is in real peril. Credibility must be restored quickly. This is
no time for Bush's &quot;free market&quot; nostrums or Paulson's soothing
bromides (We think the problem is &quot;contained&quot;) or Bernanke's feeble
rate cuts. This requires real leadership.

The first thing to do is take charge----alert the public to what is
going on and get Congress to work on substantive changes to the
system. Concrete steps must be taken to build public confidence in the
markets. And there must be a presidential announcement that all bank
deposits will be fully covered by government insurance.

The lights should be blinking red at all the related government
agencies including the Fed, the SEC, and the Treasury Dept. They need
to get ahead of the curve and stop thinking they can minimize a
potential catastrophe with their usual public relations mumbo jumbo.

U.S. BANKS: Waiting for the storm-surge

Last week, an article appeared in the Wall Street Journal, &quot;Banks
Flock to Discount Window&quot;. (9-14-07) The article chronicled the sudden
up-tick in borrowing by the struggling banks via the Fed's emergency
bailout program, the &quot;Discount Window&quot;.

WSJ:

&quot;Discount borrowing under the Fed's primary credit program for banks
surged to more than $7.1 billion outstanding as of Wednesday, up from
$1 billion a week before.&quot;

Again we see the same pattern developing; the banks borrowing money
from the Fed because they cannot meet their minimum reserve requirements.

WSJ: &quot;The Fed in its weekly release said average daily borrowing
through Wednesday rose to $2.93 billion.&quot;

$3 billion.

Traditionally, the &quot;Discount Window&quot; has only been used by banks in
distress, but the Fed is trying to convince people that it's really
not a sign of distress at all. It's &quot;a sign of strength&quot;.

Baloney. Banks don't borrow $3 billion unless they need it. They don't
have the reserves. Period.

The real condition of the banks will be revealed sometime in the next
few weeks when they report earnings and account for their massive
losses in &quot;down-graded&quot; CDOs and MBSs.

Market analyst, Jon Markman offered these words of advice to the
financial giants:

&quot;Before they (the financial industry) take down the entire market this
fall by shocking Wall Street with unexpected losses, I suggest that
they brush aside their attorneys and media handlers and come clean.
They need to tell the world about the reality of their home lending
and loan securitization teams' failures of the past four years -- and
the truth about the toxic paper that they've flushed into the world
economic system, or stuffed into Enron-like off-balance sheet entities
-- before the markets make them walk the plank.&quot;.&quot; Since government
regulators and Congress have flinched from their responsibility to
administer &quot;tough love&quot; with rules forcing financial institutions to
detail the creation, securitization and disposition of every
ill-conceived subprime loan, off-balance sheet &quot;structured investment
vehicle,&quot; secretive money-market &quot;conduit&quot; and
commercial-paper-financing vehicle, the market will do it with a
vengeance&quot; (Jon Markman, &quot;What the big banks aren't telling you  yet&quot;)

Good advice. We'll have to wait and see if anyone is listening. The
investment banks may be waiting until Tuesday hoping that Fed-chief
Ben Bernanke announces a cut to the Fed's fund rate that could send
the stock market roaring back into positive territory.

But interest rate cuts do not address the underlying problems of
insolvency among homeowners, mortgage lenders, hedge funds and
(potentially) banks. As market-analyst John R. Ing said, &quot;A cut in
rates will not solve the problem. This crisis was caused by excess
liquidity and a deterioration of credit standards.A cut in the Fed
Fund rate is simply heroin for credit junkies.&quot;

Well put.

The cuts merely add more cheap credit to a market that that is already
over-inflated from the ocean of liquidity produced by former-Fed chief
Alan Greenspan. The housing bubble and the massive credit bubble are
largely the result of Greenspan's misguided monetary policies. (For
which he now blames Bush!) The Fed's job is to ensure price stability
and the smooth operation of the marketsnot to reflate equity bubbles
and reward over-exposed market participants.

It's better to let cash-strapped borrowers default than slash interest
rates and trigger a global run on the dollar. Financial analyst
Richard Bove says that lower interest rates will do nothing to bring
money back into the markets. Instead, lower interest rates will send
the dollar into a tailspin and wreak havoc on the job market.

&quot;There is no liquidity problem, but a serious crisis of confidence,&quot;
Bove said. &quot;In a financial system where there is ample liquidity and a
desire for higher rates to compensate for risk, the solution is not to
create more liquidity and lower the rates that are available to
compensate for risk. ... (The Fed) cannot reduce fear by stimulating
inflation.&quot;

&quot;It is illogical to assume that holders of cash will have a strong
desire to lend money at low rates in a currency that is declining in
value when they can take these same funds and lend them at high rates
in a currency that is gaining in value,&quot; he said. &quot;By lowering
interest rates the Federal Reserve will not stimulate economic growth
or create jobs. It will crash the currency, stimulate inflation, and
weaken the economy and the job markets.&quot; CNN Money)

Bove is right. The people and businesses that cannot repay their debts
should be allowed to fail. Further weakening the dollar only adds to
our collective risk by feeding inflation and increasing the likelihood
of capital flight from American markets. If that happens; we're toast.

SPIRALLING INFLATION

Consider this: In 2000, when Bush took office, gold was $273 per
ounce, oil was $22 per barrel and the euro was worth $.87 per dollar.
Currently, gold is over $700 per ounce, oil is over $80 per barrel,
and the euro is nearly $1.40 per dollar. If Bernanke cuts rates, we're
likely to see oil at $125 per barrel by next spring.

Inflation is soaring. The government statistics are thoroughly bogus.
Gold, oil and the euro don't lie. According to economist Martin
Feldstein, &quot;The falling dollar and rising food prices caused
market-based consumer prices to rise by 4.6% in the most recent
quarter.&quot; (WSJ)

That's 18.4% per year---and yet, Bernanke is still considering cutting
interest rates and further fueling inflation?!?

It's crazy!

What about the American worker whose wages have stagnated for the last
6 years? Inflation is the same as a pay-cut for him. And how about the
pensioner on a fixed income? Same thing. Inflation is just a hidden
tax progressively eroding his standard of living.

Bernanke's rate cut may be boon to the &quot;cheap credit&quot; addicts on Wall
Street, but it's the death-knell for the average worker who is already
struggling just to make ends meet.

No bailouts. No rate cuts. Let the banks and hedge funds sink or swim
like everyone else. The message to Bernanke is simple: &quot;It's time to
take away the punch bowl&quot;.

The inflation in the stock market is just as evident as it is in the
price of gold, oil or real estate. Economist and author Henry Liu
demonstrates this in his article &quot;Liquidity Boom and the Looming Crisis&quot;:

&quot;The conventional value paradigm is unable to explain why the market
capitalization of all US stocks grew from $5.3 trillion at the end of
1994 to $17.7 trillion at the end of 1999 to $35 trillion at the end
of 2006, generating a geometric increase in price earnings ratios and
the like. Liquidity analysis provides a ready answer.&quot; (Asia Times)

&quot;Market capitalization zoomed from $5.3 trillion to $35 trillion in 12
years?!?

Why?

Was it due to growth in market-share, business expansion or productivity?

No. It was because there were more dollars chasing the same number of
securities; hence, inflation.

If that is the case, then we can expect the stock market to fall
sharply before it reaches a sustainable level. As Liu says, &quot;It is not
possible to preserve the abnormal market prices of assets driven up by
a liquidity boom if normal liquidity is to be restored.&quot; Eventually,
stock prices will return to a normal range.

Bernanke should not even be contemplating a rate cut. The market needs
more discipline not less. And workers need a stable dollar so they can
live within their means. Besides, another rate cut would further
jeopardize the greenback's position as the world's &quot;reserve currency&quot;.
That could destabilize the global economy by rapidly unwinding the US
massive current account deficit.
The International Herald Tribune summed up the dollar's problems in a
recent article,&quot; Dollar's Retreat Raises Fear of Collapse&quot;:

&quot;Finance ministers and central bankers have long fretted that at some
point, the rest of the world would lose its willingness to finance the
United States' proclivity to consume far more than it produces - and
that a potentially disastrous free-fall in the dollar's value would
result.

The latest turmoil in mortgage markets has, in a single stroke, shaken
faith in the resilience of American finance to a greater degree than
even the bursting of the technology bubble in 2000 or the terror
attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, analysts said. It has also raised prospect
of a recession in the wider economy.

This is all pointing to a greatly increased risk of a fast unwinding
of the U.S. current account deficit and a serious decline of the dollar.&quot;

Other experts and currency traders have expressed similar sentiments.
The dollar is at historic lows in relation to the basket of currencies
against which it is weighted. Bernanke can't take a chance that his
effort to rescue the markets will cause a sudden sell-off of the dollar.

The Fed chief's hands are tied. Bernanke simply doesn't have the tools
to fix the problems before him. Insolvency cannot be fixed with
liquidity injections nor can the deeply-rooted &quot;systemic&quot; problems in
&quot;structured finance&quot; be corrected by slashing interest rates. These
require fiscal solutions, congressional involvement, and fundamental
economic policy changes.

Rate cuts won't help to rekindle the spending spree in the housing
market either. That charade is over. The banks have already tightened
lending standards and inventory is larger than anytime since they
began keeping records. The slowdown in housing is irreversible as is
the steady decline in real estate prices. Trillions in market
capitalization will be wiped out. (thanks to Greenspan) Home equity is
already shrinking as is consumer spending connected to home-equity
withdrawals.

The bubble has popped regardless of what Bernanke does. The same is
true in the clogged Commercial Paper market where hundreds of billions
of dollars in short-term debt is due to expire in the next few weeks.
The banks and corporate borrowers are expected to struggle to
refinance their debts but, of course, much of the debt will not roll
over. There will be substantial losses and, very likely, more defaults.

BERNANKE'S LEGACY: Was he a man or a mouse?

Bernanke can either be a statesman---and tell the country the truth
about our dysfunctional financial system which is breaking down from
years of corruption, deregulation and manipulation---or he can take
the cowards-route and &quot;buy some time&quot; by flooding the system with
liquidity, stimulating more destructive consumerism, and condemning
the nation to an avoidable cycle of double-digit inflation.

We'll know his decision on Tuesday.

(4) Bush Nominates 9-11 Zionist Judge as Attorney General, by
Christopher Bollyn

BUSH NOMINATES ZIONIST JUDGE TO SERVE
AS U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL

It is widely reported that President George W. Bush will nominate
former Manhattan federal Judge Michael [Bernard] Mukasey to replace
Alberto Gonzales as attorney general.

With the fraudulent &quot;War on Terror&quot; in full swing and with 9-11 cases
in legal limbo, this is a critical appointment at a crucial time.

As I had expected, Bush has appointed a radical Zionist with close
ties to the State of Israel. Mukasey, if confirmed as U.S. Attorney
General, will protect the Zionist state and its agents who are
suspected of involvement in the false-flag terror attacks of 9-11.

Mukasey already has a long record of doing this as the presiding judge
of other cases closely connected with 9-11, such as the Larry
Silverstein insurance claims against the insurers, the Jose Padilla
&quot;dirty bomber&quot; case, and the first WTC bombing case.

Mukasey is clearly a man who is already deeply engaged in the cover-up
of 9-11.

As the Associated Press wrote, &quot;Mukasey Has Long Terror Resume.&quot;

&quot;Retired judge Michael Mukasey is intimately familiar with the
nation's legal battles over terrorism. He played a central role in
such cases for over a decade,&quot; Devlin Barrett wrote for the AP, &quot;much
of that time getting around-the-clock protection from armed guards.&quot;

Mukasey has also been involved in cases involving Holocaust-era claims
against European insurance companies and a case about ownership of
gold mines.

As I wrote in &quot;THE 9-11 CONUNDRUM - Who will replace Alberto Gonzales
- and why?&quot; posted on March 20, 2007:

Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is currently being described as
&quot;embattled&quot; and may be forced to resign over his handling of the
prosecutors' firings. It looks like there is a well orchestrated plan
to replace him. Who will replace Gonzales?

With terrorist confessions coming out from Guantanamo from people like
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, claiming to be the mastermind of 9-11, how
will the next Attorney General respond?

How can the Dept. of Justice allow the &quot;mastermind&quot; of 9/11 to avoid
being tried in a U.S. court for the murder of 3,000 people on 9/11?

Who will be the first relative to sue the detainee known as KSM for
the murder of their loved one? Only by bringing KSM into a court will
the necessary discovery and evidence be presented. This is the only
way we can hope to learn who was really behind the terror attacks of 9-11.

This is the 9-11 conundrum facing the Dept. of Justice and the
American nation. Who will be the Attorney General when these issues
come to the fore?

Why?&quot; March 20, 2007

WHO IS MUKASEY?

Michael Bernard Mukasey is described as &quot;a 66-year-old native New
Yorker,&quot; for example in the New York Post, who reported that he will
face little resistance from Senate Democrats. With Mukasey's Zionist
credentials he is most certainly bound to be approved by the
Zionist-controlled Senate.

None of the articles, however, describe Mukasey as an orthodox Jew who
is closely connected with the Kehilath Jeshurun Synagogue of New York,
an orthodox and Zionist synagogue that is affiliated with the Ramaz
yeshiva schools.

The Ramaz schools (lower, middle, and upper) take their name from the
initial (RMZ) of the Russian-born Zionist leader Rabbi Moses Zevulun
Margolies, (1851-1936).

In 1994, when Mukasey was a federal judge in the Southern District of
New York and was hearing the case of the first &quot;false flag&quot; bombing of
the WTC, his wife, the former Susan Bernstock Saroff, was the
headmistress of the Ramaz Lower School.

Michael B. Mukasey married Susan Bernstock Saroff in July 1974. They
were married by Rabbi Judah Nadich, the first adviser on Jewish
Affairs to General Dwight Eisenhower, the commander of the U.S. forces
in Europe. Nadich involved in the displaced person (DP) camps and
requested that the Jewish DPs have their own camps and receive
preferable treatment in such things as food and emmigration to the
United States.

See: Judah Nadich (1912  2007)

http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Nadich.html

Susan is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William Bernstock. Her marriage
with Mr. Saroff had ended in divorce.

According to obits in the New York Times, Michael Bernard Mukasey was
born in, or about 1941 to Albert Mukasey and his wife, the former Mae
Fischer. He has a sister named Rhoda Eckstein, who evidently married a
Norbert Eckstein.

Albert Mukasey died in September 1972 and Mae Fischer Mukasey died in
February 1975.

Mukasey and his [adopted] lawyer son, Marc, are closely connected with
GOP presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani - both serving on his judicial
advisory committee. Marc Saroff Mukasey was a 26-year-old enforcement
lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission in New York in March
1994 when he married Nancy Eve Rothenberg.

Marc is a partner with Bracewell &amp; Giuliani LLP. In 2005, former New
York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani joined the firm as a senior partner.

Both Michael and Marc are generous donors to the Giuliani campaign,
having contributed more than $10,000 since December 2006. Michael, the
nominee for attorney general, is also a generous donor to Joseph
Lieberman, a fellow orthodox Jew.

Source: Open Secrets

http://www.opensecrets.org/

Michael Mukasey swore in Mayor-elect Giuliani in 1994 and again in 1998.

Sen. Charles Schumer has long supported Mukasey for the nation's top
law-enforcement spot.

Mukasey spent 19 years as a judge after he was appointed by President
Reagan. He was chief judge in Manhattan federal court for his final
six years on the bench. He retired from public service in 2006 to
become a partner at the law firm of Patterson Belknap Webb &amp; Tyler.

As a judge, Mukasey presided over the trial of Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, who was convicted of bombing the World Trade Center in
1993 and plotting to hit other city landmarks. In the same way that
Judge Hyman I. Riebman, another Zionist judge, barred my expert
witness from testifying, Judge Mukasey did the same during the 1995
trial of Rahman, which the New York Times described as a &quot;critical
blow&quot; to the defense.

During the trial, Judge Mukasey barred defense lawyers from calling
several major witnesses who were experts on Islamic law. The defense
had hoped to call the expert witnesses to counter what it called the
&quot;prosecution's distortion of Muslim concepts&quot; to incriminate Mr. Abdel
Rahman and his 10 co-defendants.

In my case, Judge Riebman refused to allow Gregory Johnson, an expert
on police procedures, to testify on how a three-man undercover
tactical unit of the Hoffman Estates Police Dept. had responded to my
911 call.

Mukasey sentenced the blind sheik to life in prison and lashed out him
for attempting to spill American blood &quot;in a scale unseen in this
country since the Civil War.&quot;

President Bush has reportedly settled on Mukasey and is expected to
announce his selection today, Monday, September 17.

As such, he played a key role in the nation's response to the Sept. 11
attacks, which brought down the World Trade Center towers just blocks
from Mukasey's courthouse.

In the days after the attacks, Mukasey and other New York judges
worked behind closed doors, seeing some of the first material
witnesses detained by federal authorities. This must have included a
large number of Israelis, particularly the &quot;five dancing Israelis,&quot;
who were seen celebrating as they videotaped the destruction of the
World Trade Center.

These five Israelis, two of whom were known Mossad agents to U.S. law
enforcement, were returned to Israel after having failed lie-detector
tests.

The jubilant Israeli intelligence agents caught photographing the
attacks on the World Trade Center were allowed to return to Israel
where they divulged the purpose of their mission on a television
program: &quot;Our purpose was to document the event,&quot; one of them said in
Hebrew.

&quot;They seemed to be taking a movie,&quot; the resident who noticed them
said. The men were taking video or photos of themselves with the World
Trade Center burning in the background, she said. What struck her were
the expressions on the men's faces. &quot;They were like happy, you know
They didn't look shocked to me. I thought it was very strange,&quot; she said.

She found the behavior so suspicious that she wrote down the license
plate number of the van and called the police. The FBI was soon on the
scene and a statewide bulletin was issued on the van.

The van belonged to a Mossad front company called Urban Moving
Systems. Around 4 p.m. on Sept. 11, the van was pulled over, and five
Israelis: Sivan and Paul Kurzberg, Yaron Shmuel, Oded Ellner and Omer
Marmari, all between 22 and 27 years old, were arrested at gunpoint.
One had $4,700 in cash hidden in his sock while another carried two
foreign passports. Box cutters were found in the van.

Yaron Shmuel, Oded Ellner and Omer Marmari, three of the &quot;Five Dancing
Israelis&quot; on Israeli television. Oded Ellner (center) said: &quot;Our
purpose was to document the event.&quot;

The five men, disguised as moving men, had posed for their video
camera with the burning towers in the background, smiling and
celebrating by clicking their lighters. Hundreds of innocent Americans
trapped in the burning towers were being roasted alive as these
Israeli agents celebrated.

The round-up also included many innocent Muslims. An inspector
general's report later found, many of the witnesses were subjected to
physical and verbal abuse while held in a Brooklyn jail.

Pipes Lidice

Pipes Lidice.  After the Nazis killed the `murderers' in the Czech
town of Lidice, and seized many others, the rest of the population of
Lidice dispersed.  This is Pipes' solution for the Palestinian
villages from which  allegedly  Palestinian insurgents are firing
rockets in the general direction of Israel.  Pipes is now a foreign
policy advisor to Giuliani.  Do you think Rudy will drop Pipes for
advocating Nazi-style collective punishment?

Curiously, Lidice is often listed in Holocaust commemorative websites,
although the victims were not Jewish and the people hosting the
websites take the position that only Jews died in the Holocaust.  It
is such a good story they just can't resist deceiving people.

From Occupied
Afghanistan: Accounts of a Fact-Finding Mission

Interview by Kabir Joshi-Vijayan

by Mike Skinner and Hamayon Rag

Global Research, September 18, 2007

Mike Skinner and Hamayon Ragstar spent one and three months,
respectively, in Afghanistan in the late spring/summer of 2007 on a
fact-finding trip investigating how the Canadian and International
mission is affecting Afghan civilian life.

Below is the edited transcript of an hour-long interview conducted in
Toronto by Kabir Joshi-Vijayan about their reflections and conclusions
coming out of the fact-finding mission.

Q: To begin, what was the objective of this trip you undertook to
Afghanistan, what were you hoping to investigate?

Mike Skinner: The principal objective was to do an activist
documentary film that asks Afghans what they think of the
international intervention. We really wanted to listen to Afghans who
don't get heard in the West- workers we listened to people on the
street, and we listened to students in the university and in teachers
college, shopkeepers, and teachers. That was really the intent, to
hear Afghans who don't get heard.

And what parts of Afghanistan were you able to visit?

Hamayon Ragstar: We spent lots of time in Kabul city and walked around
the neighbourhoods. We went to Kabul University a few times. Mike and
I went to Bamiyan  we spent about a week in Bamiyan. From Bamiyan, we
also went to Yakaolang (which is a few hours away from the Bamiyan
valley)  and we went back to Kabul from there. We spent one day in
Ghazni, and before Mike's arrival I went to Ghazni and Jaghori. Later
I also went to Mazar and Kundus and I spent about 4-5 hours in Khandahar

What did you see of the international occupation force? Did you have
any direct interaction with any of the foreign forces present (ISAF,
NATO, the US-coalition)-and were you able to speak particularly with
any Canadian soldiers or commanders?

MS: Our most direct personal experience is when we almost got killed
at one point.

We were in a taxicab in downtown Kabul and our cabdriver wasn't
looking as he pulled out into an intersection and almost ran into an
ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) convoy. As he said,
fortunately they were Turks. If they had been Canadians or Americans,
they would have shot us if we had gotten as close to a convoy as we
did. My door was literally a few inches from this military vehicle
that almost hit us, so that was our closest experience with ISAF.

In Kabul itself ISAF is always visible, but it's not an overpowering
presence either. The Afghan Army and National police are far more
evident in most places. We were staying on a main highway from Kabul
to Khandahar and we'd certainly see Afghan army and ISAF convoys
regularly coming back and forth on that highway. Just a few days after
I arrived, we actually saw in the distance, a couple of kilometres
away, one of the ISAF convoys hit by a remote control explosive device
that blew up a vehicle. So as we were having breakfast we saw the
smoke cloud from the explosion, and few seconds later we felt the
concussion shake the building that we were in. The reports that came
from that were that an American was killed in the convoy and that
other soldiers in the convoy opened fire on innocent civilians who
were just passing by the residential area where the convoy was hit.

We would have actually liked to meet some of the Canadians there. I
tried to arrange something  to try and meet with some of the Canadian
soldiers, but it was a difficult situation. Also it is hard to cross
the line from talking to Afghan people and than going over to talking
to soldiers too, so it wouldn't have been a good situation either. So
we really didn't have any direct contact with Canadian troops or any
other western forces. In a number of informal situations, we were able
to talk with military contractors who were quite informative, but
talking off record.

What did you see/hear of civilian deaths while there?

MS: I think on a daily, or almost daily basis during the time that I
was there, there were news reports of civilian causalities and by far
the greater number of those casualties were caused by western forces
in a number of different ways. I already mentioned the hit convoy
where by retaliation or fear or reaction in the moment  the soldiers
blindly fired into a crowd, cases like that. There have also been many
cases of deliberate targeting from the air or air attacks  this is
often when there's a ground battle going on and the ground troops call
in for air support; air support comes in and they are not necessarily
firing at the right targets. There was one case when I was there where
a mosque was targeted in Paktia. It was one of the two eastern
provinces where there were several young girls that were killed in a
mosque. So we were hearing these reports on a regular, probably a
daily basis.

We also need to keep in mind that our military is causing far more
damage than just civilian deaths. Many people are injured to die later
or suffer miserably. Many people are forced to become refugees when
their homes and livelihoods are destroyed. Large areas of the
countryside have become uninhabitable because of the war. We were told
that the Canadian military is forcing evacuations of villages. Many
people also suffer human rights abuses such as home invasions,
arbitrary arrest and detention.

We occasionally hear about some of the worst cases of civilian deaths
in the Canadian media, but most of the damage our military is doing
remains undocumented.

Through the interviews and discussions you were able to have with
regular Afghans - what were their perceptions of the international
mission? How did they view the initial invasion, and how do they see
the current military occupation?

MS: There were mixed reactions. There were people, when we were doing
the actual interviews  some people who wholly supported the invasion
and occupation  there were people that didn't. There were some people
that were fully against it from the beginning and they had a really
good analysis for that. There were also a large group of people now I
haven't gone through the tapes and added up the numbers- but I think
that probably the largest number of people actually had some really
mixed feelings; a lot of people said initially they'd hoped there
would be some progressive change. The Taliban were a repressive
regime, certainly an incredibly anti-woman regime- so people held out
hope for some progressive change- but that hope has dissipated in the
past 6 years because those changes have not occurred.

Conflicts between various colonial and imperial powers have been key
in shaping Afghanistan's history- whether this was colonial Britain
and Russia, or the social imperialist Soviet Union against the US in
the 70's and 80's. Do inter-imperial rivalries have a role in the
current conflict?

MS: There are certainly many indications that they do, and there are a
number of players in the mix now  certainly Russia is still very
important in the region, China is aggressively moving beyond its
borders- and Afghanistan is a neighbour of China, Pakistan and India
which are all regional players in this. Iran is very important, there
is also Saudi Arabia, which has been a big player in Afghanistan for a
long time. The United Arab Emirates are very influential as well,
along with all the western states aligned with the United States that
are playing a big part. And certainly Canada has some real interest,
and I expect particularly economically in mining in Afghanistan
because there are some very rich mining resources that are largely
unexploited. I'm sure Canadian mining companies would love to get in
there and get their hands on it. However, that is not what was driving
the invasion. But it's one of those side benefits that, while we're
there, lets make some money by developing those mines.

A number of `progressive' forces in Canada and elsewhere, such as the
Senlis Council and the NDP, often draw a distinction between the
`developmental' and military role Canada plays in Afghanistan-
claiming that the re-construction and developmental aid we are lending
is playing a positive role. What evidence did you see of Canadian
developmental projects while you were there- and do you agree with
this distinction?

MS: There's a new developmental concept, a 3-D approach. It's supposed
to balance defence, diplomacy, development- and actually this concept
of provincial reconstruction teams that is being applied in both Iraq
and Afghanistan is supposed to do this- where you have the military
and development agencies actually working hand in hand in the same
base going out and working together.

We asked for a list of CIDA projects from the Canadian embassy in
Afghanistan and they said they would contact us and we never heard
back from them. We stumbled across one CIDA project that was an
artificial insemination project  with a sign on an office  it was
closed and the windows were broken. That was the only CIDA project we
actually found on our own, but we didn't go looking very hard, we kind
of stumbled across it. (There was) an interesting situation in
Bamiyan, a New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team- a PRT base, a
typical military base- a well-fortified military base. It had a large
airstrip so that planes could come in and out and it was on a high
point of land, a plateau above the town of Bamiyan, about 8 km out of
the town. And they did build a development project; they built a high
school for girls. But they didn't build it in the town of Bamiyan;
they built it immediately below the base so that the workers at the
base would be protected by the military. Bamiyan has been one of the
most stable regions since the invasion.

This is the town where the Taliban destroyed the giant statues of the
Buddha. But since 2001, the Taliban has been gone. It's a Hazara
ethnic area - and the Hazara have really acquiesced to the occupation,
and there's been to my knowledge no attacks on coalition forces or
ISAF in this area, so there's not a big security problem - it's as
stable as its going to get. The school was built immediately beside
the base below this plateau so as to provide security. It's a clear
shot from the base down to this area, with a clear view of the
surrounding valley and a good secure place to build this
thing. However, it is a 16 km round-trip walk for the girls from
Bamiyan to get to the school and back, and you get pretty severe
winters in this area as well. It's not the ideal place to put the
school; it should have been in town. The university student who
pointed it out to me said that this is just typical of the way these
projects are  it was obviously considering the interests of the
people who built this and not considering the interest of the Afghans
who actually have to use it  and it was done without the consultation
of the people who live in the area.

Along with development, the Afghan government is also constantly used
as a justification for maintaining the occupation. We are told that
the current government represents a vast improvement from the time of
the Taliban- and that international troops are needed to support and
help it. What changes in the government have we actually seen since
the Taliban?

HR: I don't think anything substantially has changed since the time of
the Taliban  the Taliban was representing the feudal comprador ruling
class of Afghanistan  especially the Pashtun ruling classes. This
current government is again representing the ruling classes of
Afghanistan and is directly at the service of an imperialist
occupation. There have been some very minor cosmetic changes. Lets say
in relation that this government is giving some positions of power to
the non-Pashtun nationalities - the Taliban didn't  this government
is giving some symbolic positions to women  the Taliban didn't bother
with those kind of things. But I would say all these changes are
cosmetic changes, there is nothing substantial.

For example, the imperialists during the invasion talked a lot about
the issue of women and in that regard have given to some women
individuals and groups some positions in the ranks of the puppet
regime; this has nothing to do with rights of women of Afghanistan,
rather it is purely for the purpose of turning the question of women a
political tool at the service of imperialist occupation. It's still a
chauvinist government - a male chauvinist government, an ethnic
chauvinist government. It's a theocratic government. Taliban was a
single party theocracy; this government is a multi-party
theocracy. This government also states in its constitution that no law
shall be put into place in Afghanistan that is in contradiction to
Sharia law  and Sharia law is obviously not very friendly towards
women or religious minorities. I would say there is no change
substantially from the time Taliban. On so many levels this government
is worse than the Taliban. For example, this government is more
corrupt. There was no bribery during the Taliban's time- it was much
cleaner on those issues. However, in this government, from the
President to the very low ranking officials of the government,
everyone is taking bribes  so it is much, much more corrupt than the
Taliban ever was.

There is a position put forward, by RAWA (Revolutionary Association of
Afghan Women), Malaia Joya (former Afghan parliamentarian), and
sections of the international `left' who recognize the presence of
warlords and drug barons in the Afghan government, but who say the
regime as a whole cannot be dismissed. That is, they claim that people
like Karzai are different from these warlords, and can still be worked
with. Do you agree with this assertion?

HR: I don't agree with this position at all because it does not
reflect the reality on the ground  Hamid Karzai's government is
corrupt from A to Z  if anyone would be complaining about the
warlords stealing and drug dealings, Hamid Karzai's brother himself,
Ahmad Wali Karzai, is the largest drug lord in the southern provinces.
Hamid Karzai himself had links with the Taliban; he was working with
the Taliban government. There is no substantial difference between
Hamid Karzai and the people who would be regarded as warlords. I think
Hamid Karzai is as much a warlord as the others around him; and we
must never forget that in the context of Afghanistan that the biggest
warlords are the coalition forces of the NATO troops who are killing
the people with much more sophisticated and modern weapons than the
warlords could ever have done. I don't buy that kind of argument that
is also put forward by the mainstream western media, the mainstream
politics - that they have put in place a democratic government led by
Hamid Karzai that is surrounded by bad warlords. This is buying into
this imperialist discourse of the issue.

The reality is that Hamid Karzai is the head of this puppet government
and this puppet government is a multi-party puppet government that has
different people within it: previous warlords, Mujahideen commanders,
some remnants of the Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan, remnants
of the bureaucrats from the time of the king  they are all coming
together and they are all in the body of this puppet government which
is supported by the American imperialists. So to distinguish between a
good section of the government and the bad section of the government,
I think is playing into the politics of the western imperialists. They
all are equally taking part in the national treason.

So to distinguish between a good section of the government and the bad
section of the government, I think is playing into the politics of the
western imperialists. Above all it shows a kind of capitulationism
towards the imperialist occupation and thinking if they would put a
lot of resources in hands of the Karzai led &quot;national government&quot;
(which I would call the puppet government) things would change for the
better. The people who are with Karzai are also with his imperialist
masters. Thus, they should be considered pro-imperialists, and they
are not forces of the left to me. In these kinds of situations we
should have no illusions about who our friends are and who our enemies
are?

The people in Afghanistan loathe the puppet regime. That is why
resistance to the puppet regime and the occupation are on the rise.
People there very frequently hit to the streets with radical slogans
like &quot;Down with America&quot; and &quot;Down with the puppet regime&quot;.

Can you talk about these various factions within the Afghan
government, and what relation they have with the inter-imperial issues
and rivalries Mike described earlier.

HR: The principal agents of American imperialists in Afghanistan are
Karzai and his cronies in the government. For example, the minister of
finance Anwar-ul-Haq Ahadi, who is the leader of the Afghanistan's
Social Democratic party, the minister of defence General Wardak, the
ex-minister of the interior Ali Ahmad Jalali  they are usually the
Pashtun ruling classes, and they are the principal agents of American
imperialism. The Russians and Iran has another base of support with
the puppet government, which are famous in the west as the warlords;
they are usually the ruling classes of the non-Pashtun nationalities,
though some Hazara reactionaries are with Karzai  they are divided.

So we should remember that the puppet regime in Afghanistan, which is
a result of the Bonn conference in December 2001, was a compromise
between different imperialist players: the US, the Russians, the EU
and also the regional players like Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, India
and China  they all compromised over what the future settlement in
Afghanistan should be. But gradually the US wing of the regime gained
strength and is kicking out and cleaning the puppet government of the
Russian backed players (the Northern Alliance for example), so Russia
is not happy with the whole situation. All the imperialist powers have
their representatives in this government; even Germany has its
representative in this government. For example, the German
representative in the government is the foreign minister, Rangin
Dadfar Spanta. The parliament doesn't like him very much, the
parliament wants to kick him out, but because of the German pressure,
he is still in the cabinet. In the larger inter- imperial rivalry
between the US and the Russians, of course the Germans side with the
US in this case, so the US is also standing behind a person like
Spanta, who is in the Karzai cabinet. So this is the composition of
the different factions  some are representing US interest, some are
representing Russian interests, and definitely no one is representing
the interests of the people of Afghanistan in this puppet government.

One regional issue directly tied to the government and situation in
Afghanistan is in Pakistan. We constantly hear of the charges against
Musharraf (Pakistani President), that he is not doing enough to fight
`terror' in Afghanistan etc., and of the ongoing tensions between him
and Karzai. Can you talk about this conflict between the Afghani and
Pakistani governments, and its historical origins?

HR: The conflict between Afghanistan and Pakistan has a long
history. When Pakistan was created in 1947, Afghanistan was one of the
countries that opposed the creation of Pakistan as a country. It has
its roots and effect that in the late 19th century, Afghanistan and
Britain signed an agreement that handed over territories of
Afghanistan to British India at the time. Those territories are
Balochistan province and North West Frontier Province (NWFP) in
Pakistan. That agreement was for 100 years- 100 years passed in 1993,
these territories should have been handed back to Afghanistan. So it
had its roots in there. The Afghanistani ruling classes have always
had its ties to these territories- emotional, historical and
nationalist attachments to the lost provinces of Afghanistan, which is
now under Pakistani control. It goes to that.

The other aspect of this whole thing is that American Imperialism has
always played Afghanistani politics through Pakistan - in 1970s, when
President Daoud led a coup against his cousin and declared Afghanistan
to be a republic, Afghanistan became very close to the Soviet Union.
America supported Islamic fundamentalists against the Daoud government
from 1973 onward. This whole thing happened through Pakistan
Pakistan was supporting the Islamists in Afghanistan against Daoud's
government. In 1978, when the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan
led another coup against Daoud, the Soviet Union became much more
involved in Afghanistan, and then America pumped up all the support
for the Islamists in Afghanistan  again through Pakistan. Since 1970,
until the time of the government of the Taliban, all the governments
of Afghanistan had sour relationship with Pakistan  Pakistan was
supporting the Islamists against the Daoud's government, and later
against the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan's government -and
all these governments' again, were claiming these two provinces. For
the first time in the history of Afghanistan, the only pro-Pakistani
government was the government of the Taliban. Taliban was the only
pro-Pakistani government in the history of Afghanistan. Now that the
Taliban is gone, there are talks about the re-mapping of the Middle
East. America put out another map of how to re-map and re-shape the
Middle East, and according to that map, America is planning to make
Balochistan an independent country - but to give North Western Front
province and that of Pashtun population  to Afghanistan. And this is
very much what the Pashtun ruling classes in Afghanistan want. So
maybe this is why they have stepped up criticism of the Musharraf
government  &quot;Musharraf is not doing very much to curb terrorism in
Afghanistan&quot; etc.  this has to do with these international politics
and the immediate politics of the region - the re-mapping of the
Middle East.

How to solve the problem of Balochistan and NWF province? The
progressive forces in Afghanistan have always had the position that it
is not the business of politicians in Islamabad or the politicians in
Kabul to determine the future of millions of people living in
Balochistan and NWF province of Pakistan  it is their own business.
They should have the right of self determination  they are the
oppressed nationalities within Pakistan  so its up to them to decide
if they want to go to Pakistan in a voluntary unity  if they want to
have their own independent state or if they want to join Afghanistan
but this has to happen from a bottom up resistance in a fight of the
oppressed nationalities and oppressed peoples, in the process of the
new democratic revolution. This problem (of oppressed nationalities)
also exists in Afghanistan.

On the armed resistance actively fighting the occupation troops in
Afghanistan-which forces are involved in this insurgency, who is
funding/arming them, and how should we in the anti-war/
anti-imperialist movement be viewing them?

HR: Right now two political forces are actively engaging in armed
resistance to the occupation. The most important is the Taliban, after
the Taliban is the Islamic Party of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is also
somewhat active but it is a very minor player. The Taliban is much,
much more active, especially in the south - Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is
somehow active in the northern province of Kunduz. Who is supporting
the resistance in Afghanistan? There are some indications that
elements in the Pakistani establishment are supporting the Taliban
-giving them arms. There are also some accusations against Iran, that
Iran is supplying arms and resources to the Taliban and to the
resistance against the American occupation, but these accusations
cannot be proven. One thing that is very clear is that the Taliban is
buying most of its arms from within Afghanistan  they are buying them
either they had them from before, or they are buying them. The price
of a kalashnikov in Afghanistan right now is around 1000 dollars
which is very expensive according to Afghanistani standards. Why is it
expensive? Because the Taliban are buying all the kalashnikovs; the
demand is very high. They are buying them from the underground
markets- so that as guns get smaller and smaller they are more
expensive. A Mekarov pistol, for example, would be much more expensive
than a kalashnikov the bigger guns are significantly cheaper
because no one is buying them - they are not good for guerrilla
warfare, which is the type of war the Taliban are leading.

The anti-war movement should be putting all its energies against the
occupation  because this occupation is the root of all the
problems. As long as the imperialist occupation continues in
Afghanistan, it means the war will continue. It means many, many
innocent people will die. So the antiwar movement should be focusing
on defeating this imperialist occupation- forcing the Canadian
government, or in the case of America, forcing the American
government, to withdraw from Afghanistan. Currently the Taliban are
not the principal enemy  the principal enemy is the imperialist
occupation and all the resources should be focused on that.

MS: I think something Hamayon has pointed out that is important is
that we can't allow the Taliban and the Islamic party to maintain the
monopoly on resistance. That there has to be an alternative to those
radical Islamic organizations as far as resisting imperialism, and
that as long as our military is in place we're creating the
environment to encourage more recruits for the Taliban for sure. I
mean for every person we injure, every person we kill, every person we
make a refugee, we are angering so many people that we are making
recruits. As an example of some of the things that are happening; I
talked about the air attacks that are called in and the indiscriminate
retaliatory attacks when convoys are attacked, but one of the tactics
that the Canadian military is doing which a number of people told us
about, in their search and destroy missions - in the counter
insurgency tactics  we are in a counter insurgency war, this is what
is being undertaken, the same as in Vietnam, same as in Central
America  this is counterinsurgency. This is what we condemned the
Americans for in the past and what we are now partners in. The
Canadian military will give 24 hours warning to a village  they'll
tell the people we are coming to your village  evacuate  and if you
don't evacuate you risk being killed. So of course people evacuate,
the forces come in, they are looking for weapons, explosives, but
because it is considered unsafe to go into a building because it might
be booby-trapped they just destroy every building, they destroy the
homes, they destroy the farm buildings, they destroy the wells because
there might be weapons hidden in the well and than they leave and tell
the people they can go back. Then for some reason the Canadian
military is shocked when these people become refugees instead of going
back and starting all over again to rebuild their homes and their
farms. This is considered to be the more humanitarian tactic that the
Canadians are doing as opposed to what the Americans have often been
doing - which is outright bombing of homes and farms without any warning.

In terms of eliminating that monopoly of Islamic forces over
resistance to imperialism- what leftist/progressive forces are there
in Afghanistan sincerely opposing the occupation? And were you and
Mike able to meet with any of them?

HR: Mike and I had an informal chat with one of the members of the
Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan and he was talking about the
importance of an international support for the leftists in
Afghanistan. He gave an interesting example - when the Americans
invaded Afghanistan in 2001, the invasion and occupation happened with
this huge international coalition of countries- all the imperialist
powers are either there directly supporting the Americans in the
occupation or indirectly supporting it through political and economic
means. Either their soldiers are there or they are sending money or
doing different things. The political Islamists in the form of the
Taliban who are resisting the imperialist occupation also have a huge
international coalition; Islamists across the Arab world, from South
Asia through East Asia are supporting Taliban in their resistance.

The Taliban alone cannot do the kind of resistance that they are
doing, the Americans cannot alone occupy this country, and the left in
Afghanistan, since it is an international struggle, cannot play their
role alone. So the left in Afghanistan need the support of the left
internationally to have a foothold in Afghanistan in the resistance
against the imperialist occupation. The left has a long history in
Afghanistan  they have resisted the Soviet social imperialist
occupation in Afghanistan, they have resisted the Islamists, now they
are engaging in an ideological and political struggle against the
American imperialist occupation and they say they are in a stage of
preparing for a national people's war of resistance to the imperialist
occupation. They have a base in there people are looking up to
them. They have much respect across Afghan society  especially the
Maoist variant of the left. People consider that they, unlike all
other political forces, have not engaged in human rights violations,
and in selling out the country. They have been the people who have
always asked for the independence of the country, for the pride of the
people of Afghanistan for self- determination, and have always been
there with the people kind of thing. So the people are looking up to
them.

Sometimes the people are even joking and saying that all the political
forces in the history of this country have ruled Afghanistan for a
while  the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, - they ruled
Afghanistan - the Islamists ruled Afghanistan for a long time through
the Mujahideen, then the Taliban variety, the chauvinist,
pseudo-fascist version of Afghanistan's social democratic party are in
power with Hamid Karzai right now. So the only movement in Afghanistan
that have not been in power are the Maoists- the people are saying now
it is your turn. So for that kind of thing to materialize, I think the
left should understand its international duty  that it is not only
enough to condemn the American imperialism, the imperialist
occupation to get to the streets when denouncing the imperialist
occupation - it is not enough to complain about the reactionary nature
of the Taliban. What the left should do  the left have always been
internationalists  they should extend their support and solidarity to
the revolutionary and progressive forces in Afghanistan. I think
Mike's thing to go to Afghanistan and talk to the people is an
excellent example of that kind of internationalist solidarity; this is
what internationalist solidarity should be all about and in the future
they (the left) should be doing those types of things. If they cannot
send their Che Guevara's to go and pick up guns  then do it by having
reporting of the situation on the ground and to do support by other
means. They should coordinate and cooperate with the left in
Afghanistan on joint-projects. I think these things can definitely
change things on the ground in Afghanistan.

To finish off Mike- from your time in Afghanistan, is there a message
you have? Something you think the left internationally, but in Canada
in particular, isn't getting or is not doing?

MS: One thing the left can do, and particularly considering a Canadian
election is imminent, is taking a stand against our military presence
in Afghanistan. I think we need to really do some much deeper analysis
of what it is we're doing there. I don't think there is a politician
in Canada that could stand at a podium and speak to an audience here
and say we should send our military into a place like Afghanistan to a
fight for the capitalist empire. We need to force politicians to be in
that position where they have to be honest about that statement,
because that is exactly what we are doing in Afghanistan right now.
Yet we are not forcing our politicians to be honest about that. The
only politician that I've ever heard honestly make that statement is
Michael Ignatieff in his book &quot;Empire Lite&quot; where he says exactly that
in those explicit terms and he's never been brought to account by the
media to actually have to own up to that since becoming a politician.
Yet I think most Canadians and those in positions of leadership
understand that that is what they're doing  we are fighting a war to
expand a capitalist empire throughout the world. But there is not a
politician that has the guts to say that and bring that out for
discussion.

So that is certainly a role of the left to put that on the table
before an election. We need to ask our politicians: &quot;Are you
supporting fighting a war for capitalist empire - is that what we are
going to send soldiers to do? And if Canadians are unwilling to
support that, which I highly doubt they are,
