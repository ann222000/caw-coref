By a stroke of luck I just happened on C-SPAN broadcasting a one-hour speech given by Hugo Chavez at the opening of the latest OPEC meeting in Venezuela on Thursday. Alas, a search of C-SPAN doesn't indicate it will be rebroadcast (actually, it doesn't even show up on the schedule at all), and there doesn't appear to be a video archive, nor can I find a transcript of the speech anywhere online. Too bad, because it was a very interesting speech.

The American media, virtually without exception, headlined one obscure sentence in the speech in which Chavez discussed "Carlos the Jackal" and referred to him as "my friend," and provided the reader with virtually no other details about the speech. Only in the Gulf Times , out of Qatar, could I find any meaningful press coverage of the speech. Some excerpts: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez yesterday declared OPEC an "anti-imperialist" organisation that can help liberate people in the developing world and told its members the US "empire" would collapse.

Addressing the opening of a ministerial meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the leftist leader said the 11 oil-producing countries were a force to fight poverty.

"OPEC is an anti-colonial, anti-imperialist organisation, a liberating organisation for the development of our peoples of Latin America, Africa and Asia," he told the energy ministers.

With an OPEC expansion, under consideration, that would include countries from those regions, "the tomb of US imperialism is opened," he said. "The empire is going to collapse in this century."

The fiery US critic repeated his demand of a US troop withdrawal from Iraq and defended Iran, which the United States and others accuse of covertly seeking nuclear weapons, as a "brother people".

"Stop the oppression of the Iraqi people, stop the threat against the Iranian people," he said.

In the past century "we have offered our oil to quench the thirst of the developed countries, while our peoples in Asia, Africa and Latin America stagnate in under-development, misery and backwardness," he added.

"That is colonialism, that is called imperialism," he said. If anyone finds a transcript or video, post it in the comments and I'll update this post.

I just read your diary on this over at Daily Kos. I share what I assume to be your respect for Chavez. I see him as a true leader. He not only speaks out against injustice, but he takes action as well. I thought what he did with Citgo last winter in offering discounted heating oil to 75 low income apart buildings in New York was a great thing. I mean these weren't "his" people but he wanted to help. Of course, this is the kind of thing that just infuriates Bush &amp; Co. So, he continues to be painted as a despot in the mainstream media.

Venezuela's Chavez calls oil prices fair

http://thestar.com.my/news/story...131&amp;sec=apworld

A day after urging OPEC leaders to cut oil production, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez defended soaring world oil prices as fair and lambasted the United States for excessive energy consumption.

"The big consumers say that oil is very expensive," Chavez said Friday. "No, oil is not expensive. It's only that oil is a nonrenewable natural resource and they have to learn to conserve."

Analysts say the leftist Chavez's political ideals may not be shared by fellow OPEC members, but Thursday's meeting gave him a chance to raise his profile internationally while offering some economic suggestions that appeared to resonate.

Speaking to supporters, Chavez scolded wealthy countries for what he called blatant wastefulness and said capitalism is the root of the problem. The United States, he said, amassed fortunes by taking millions of barrels of low-priced oil out of Venezuela the same way Spanish conquerers once made off with gold.

"There have been 500 years of looting, and here's the result: countries in the North are developed and we are poor here," he said. "Misery, death, infant mortality, sickness and illiteracy pervades the countries of the South.

"They call oil 'black gold.' Of course, they first looted our gold, silver, precious stones and so many other things, then the oil. Venezuela is saying 'Enough!'"

Chavez, blasting weak dollar, wants euro-denominated crude

id=14102

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, an "anti-imperialist" antagonist of the United States, suggested as host of the OPEC ministerial meeting here Thursday that the cartel forsake the weak dollar and switch to the euro for pricing crude.

"The dollar is weakening, due above all to the irresponsibility of the government of the United States," he said in his speech opening the conclave of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

Chavez blamed the greenback's slide on the U.S. budget deficit - "the biggest in history" - and on what he called "an artificial economy, a veritable bubble on the point of bursting, that threatens the world."

He predicted the "end of the dictatorship of the dollar, currency of an empire that will fall in this century." Venezuela is already studying the idea of selling its oil in euros, Chavez said, while adding that he hopes to see the advent of a Latin American single currency analogous to the euro.

the people in Venezuela are worse off for the actions of the president for life. hospitals are closing, promised housing is not being built. a middle class that once was growing is now falling into poverty. jews are being persecuted as well as political "disidents." mobs of Chavez loyalists beat and kill anyone who voices disfavor of Chavez.

You are worshiping a madman who's policies really do resemble Hitler's.

You are sick, sad, useful idiots. Get a clue.

yes theman, if only venezuelans would've gotten behind the honorable, dignified pedro carmona, pedro the brief, who tried to un-do the constitution and dissolve congress in his fabulous 12 hour reign.

if only venezuela had a leader of such commitment to democracy, eh?

maybe you should work on pedro's campaign when he decides to come back from his holiday in colombia? he needs some useful idiots.

steve heeren:

The quote is indeed from J.S. Mill: it is from a speech in Parliament in which he was responding to a question about a footnote in his book on representative government, wherein he said that the conservative party is by the law of its nature the stupidest party. Here is the quote in context:

What I stated was, that the Conservative party was, by the law of its constitution, necessarily the stupidest party. (Laughter.) Now, I do not retract this assertion; but I did not mean that Conservatives are generally stupid;I meant, that stupid persons are generally Conservative. (Laughter and cheers.) I believe that to be so obvious and undeniable a fact that I hardly think any honourable Gentleman will question it. Now, if any party, in addition to whatever share it may possess of the ability of the community, has nearly the whole of its stupidity, that party, I apprehend, must by the law of its constitution be the stupidest party. And I do not see why honourable Gentlemen should feel that position at all offensive to them; for it ensures their being always an extremely powerful party. (Hear, hear.)
