&gt;&gt; If I say it myself, my exegesis of this sonnet was
&gt;&gt; particularly good. Does anyone want me to post it
&gt;&gt; again?

&gt; I think you should, if for no other reason than as a warning to
&gt; readers about what eating shit does to your brain.

Thank you for your kind words, Tom. I expect
you to follow up on them by pointing out, on a
line-by-line basis, how I have gone completely
wrong in this exegesis -- how the meanings I find
clash hopelessly with the sense and tone of its
words. I expect you to demonstrate how the
meanings found by Stratfordian commentators
are manifestly superior in each case.

1. O thou my lovely Boy who in thy power,
2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;
3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein showest,
4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest.
5. If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)
6. As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
7. She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
8. May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.
9. Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,
10. She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!
11. Her *Audit* (though delayed) answered must be,
12. And her *Quietus* is to render thee.

This sonnet has given rise to much puzzlement
-- much of which is unexpressed. Commentators
silently let lines and phrases slip by, not attempting
to elucidate their meanings. They may discuss
particular words -- but they avoid looking at possible
meaning of lines as a whole. This, of course, is a
common pattern in all 'exegeses' of Shakespeare
sonnets but is more blatant than usual here.

Commentators suggest that it is addressed to the
'fair youth', but that leads to much that is mystifying.
How does the 'fair youth' hold &quot;Time's fickle glass&quot;?
How can he have this strange relationship with
Nature? What does he have to fear from her (in
line 9)? And what does the 'Audit' have to with him?
Or how can 'Nature' render him?

Nothing in the tone of the words fits any scenario
conceivable within the Stratfordian framework --
nor the Baconian, nor Marlite nor any other --
except for that which you are about to see.

I have argued before that the addressee is the
Cupid-like figure of figure of Time -- the infant boy
who holds the hour-glass of Time, and who
commonly represents the start of a period, usually
a year. (Such a figure is one of the two shown on
the top of the Stratman's memorial.) However, that
can only be a part of an explanation -- a superficial
tone, or an excuse of a theme. This poet did not
address banal sonnets to abstract figures. He
always had things to say, and it was invariably
pointed.

Bookburn's commentator remarks on the opening
phrase: &quot;Some commentators have objected to this
phrase and found it too mawkish&quot;. And, indeed it is.
It is almost explicitly sarcastic.

The sonnet is unusual in not being addressed to
his love -- but to 'my lovely Boy'. Possibly it is a
misreading of this sonnet, more than any other,
that has given rise to the fantastic notion of the
'Fair Youth'. Absurd misreadings of that nature
were probably inevitable, given the extent of
Stratfordian misconceptions. Unlike all other
sonnets, the tone here is one of shameless
disparagement of its addressee.

It probably originated in the competition between
Oxford and Ralegh, as each submitted verses to
their 'adored' as part of the courtly exchange in
seeking her love -- a game that she enjoyed
beyond measure.

Most of Ralegh's poems have been lost, but one:
&quot;Nature, that washed her hands in milk&quot; has
echoes of Sonnet 126. In these verses, 'Nature'
is the Queen, despising Time.

But Time, which Nature doth despise,
And rudely gives her love the lie,
Makes hope a fool and sorrow wise,
His hands do neither wash, nor dry,
But being made of steel and rust,
Turns snow and silk and milk to dust.

The light, the belly, lips, and breath
He dims, discovers, and destroys;
With those he feeds, but fills not, Death,
Which sometimes were the food of joys;
Yea, Time doth dull each lively wit,
And dries all wantonness with it.

The tone of Sonnet 126 is sarcastic, with the
poet's target being Ralegh sometime after mid-
1581 when he became the new favourite.

1. O thou my lovely Boy who in thy power,

'Boy' had a strongly derogatory sense (shown as
obsolete in the OED -- sense 4):
CORIOLANUS (v.v.101 see also 104 and 117)
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!

'Boy' was also the standard spelling for 'buoy'.
'Boy' and 'buoy' are (and were ) pronounced
identically in the U.K. and in all navies. Oxford
regarded Ralegh as a lower-class servant or
knave, and little better than flotsam.

The 'lovely' part of the description is a sarcastic
reference to his good looks -- and possibly to
the Queen's regard or description of him.

2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hower;

This line is ostensibly addressed to the Cupid-
like figure of time, holding the hour-glass, which
over the year (or other period) turns into a sickle.
That should strictly be a scythe; the poet
substitutes 'sickle' as a play on 'fickle' ('s' and 'f'
were almost identical in Elizabethan script) and
as a hint at the moon (with its waning and
growing).

Note the correct punctuation of the Quarto, with a
comma before 'hower' (an old spelling of 'whore').
(Modern editors routinely change the punctuation
here, pretending to have some better insight into
the poet's meaning.) The poet calls Ralegh 'a
whore', picturing him as holding a 'fickle' mirror for
the Queen. When she looks at him, she sees a
reflection of herself as a young girl in her twenties.
This, the poet suggests, is sick. The 'fickleness'
is primarily in the Queen -- she may drop her
favourite at any moment, as she has recently
dropped the poet.

3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein showest,

Again this is nicely contrived to be apparently
about the figure of Time, and his hour-glass,
whereas the sharpness of its point is directed
at Ralegh. 'Wane' as a noun (OED sb1) had
several meanings now obsolete: 1 = 'want, lack
shortage'; b = 'lack, fault, defect'; c = 'omission,
shortening'; 2 = 'need, want, poverty' . . .

Ralegh, by constantly begging to his mistress,
and by pointing out his poverty had grown in
wealth.

&quot;While his ships were away, Ralegh continued to rise in the
Queen's favour. He was a persistent petitioner, for himself
and for his friends and clients. 'When, Sir Walter,' the Queen
asked, 'will you cease to be a beggar?' 'When your gracious
Majesty ceases to be a benefactor,' he replied. . . &quot;
(*Ralegh*, by John Winton, page 54)

4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest.

As Ralegh grew in favour and wealth, he became
extremely unpopular ('thy lovers withering').

&quot;Few others shared Elizabeth's high opinion of Ralegh, for
most people had a violent aversion to him. He was &quot;commonly
noted for using of bitter scoffs and reproachful taunts&quot; in
everyday social intercourse, and his biting and sarcastic tongue
&quot;bred him much dislike&quot; . . Far from being disturbed by his
unpopularity Ralegh positively exulted in it, but though Elizabeth
did not mind that he showed no interest in courting the public,
she was less happy about the fact that he sometimes seemed
to go out of his way to cause gratuitous offence. He was the sort
of man who would &quot;lose a friend to coin a jest&quot; . . &quot;
(*Elizabeth*, Anne Somerset, page 337)

As a further sense, Ralegh was noted for his
capacity for a 'withering' comment.

4. . . . . as thy sweet self growest.

A bitterly sarcastic comment.

5. If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)

Superficially, the poet is speaking of a god-like
figure of 'Nature' which seeks to hold back the
progress of Time. In reality he is talking about their
joint 'sovereign mistress'. The 'wrack' here was
the wreck of the state, as she disdained marriage,
refusing to breed an heir, virtually guaranteeing (in
the poet's view) civil war on, or before, her death.
'Wrack' is a also a marine reference -- to the wrecks
and to the worthless seaweed littering the shore --
with the clear implications, firstly, that Ralegh is
largely responsible for that 'wreck' and, secondly,
is no better than the worthless sea-weed.

6. As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,

Whenever her close favourites wanted to take
charge of some enterprise which involved leaving
the court, the Queen usually forbade their departure.
Ralegh would have loved to go to Virginia to see
that his colonies started on the right basis, but the
Queen would not allow it. Occasionally they left
court, but were then usually ordered to return.

The poet is also referring to Ralegh's wider political
prospects. Walter was intensely ambitious, and had
much ability, but the poet could see that he would
never achieve high office. The Queen would always
'hold him back'.

7. She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill

While still apparently writing within the framework
of the gods of Nature and Time, the poet becomes
almost blunt in stating his views on the manner in
which the court is run. He detests the way in which
the Queen is now behaving. She should be seizing
the last possible opportunity to marry and have an
heir. She refuses to do that, instead wasting her
time on this worthless knave. The poet tells him
that she keeps him solely to pass the time in
frivolity.

8. May Time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.

She will disgrace her time, both by remaining
barren, and by carrying on with this unpopular
scoundrel. He is kept to help her kill time.

The quarto shows 'mynuit' which was also a ...

Ah, well. No response from Tom, nor any

To give y'all some encouragement, here is

lines and phrases you think he gets closer

"/>

Actually his editing is remarkably good (for this
sonnet). He sticks fairly closely to the Quarto
text. You might not think that's hard to do.
But few Stratfordian editors can manage it.

---------------- Here follows his commentary:-------------------
Sonnet 126
Usually taken as an envoy to the young man series
(1-125), 126, as Kerrigan notes, treats a number of
the dominant themes in the series (love, mortal
beauty, treasure, finance and its growth, Time and
its inexorable destruction, death). The tone is
valedictory: the 'boy' may be 'lovely', but,
despite Nature's attempt to preserve him as the
paragon and pattern of her creative power, Time
will demand a final accounting in death. One
theme is notably absent - there is no hint of the
immortality that the poet has earlier (e.g. in 63,
65) promised to bestow on the 'boy' as 'great
bases for eternity' (see 125.3 n.). Formally, like
99 and 145, 126, though in a different way, is an
anomaly; instead of the usual fourteen-line sonnet
in three alternately rhymed pentameter quatrains
and final couplet, it is a twelve-line poem in six
pentameter couplets. But 'sonnet' was loosely
used at this time for any short lyric poem, and
several examples of twelve-line 'sonnets' occur in
other sonnet series in which the fourteen-line form
is the norm, only one of them, however, in
rhyming couplets (William Smith, Chloris (1596),
27; see Rollins, 1, 319), and none of them as an
envoy. Despite its couplet rhyme-scheme,
however, 126 retains its feeling for the three-
quatrain-plus-couplet structure of the regular
Shakespearean sonnet -the first and second four
lines forming clearly integrated units and the last
four lines being broken by a heavy stop after the
first couplet, thus giving the last two lines much
of the summary effect of the usual final couplet.
Editors and critics, since Malone, generally accept
126 as a complete twelve-line poem, even though
Q indicates that two final lines are lacking (see
collation), Q's device being explained as an
attempt by Thomas Thorpe or one of George
Eld's compositors to accommodate 126 to fit into
Shakespeare's usual fourteen-line form. This is a
reasonable hypothesis, but the possibility remains
that Thorpe intentionally omitted a final couplet,
perhaps, because it gave too obvious a clue to the
identity of the 'lovely boy'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1. O thou my lovely boy, who in thy power

"/>

1 lovely boy . . . (1) beautiful, (2) lovable,
(3) loving boy or youth. Compare 'lovely youth'
(54.13). Benson omits the poem, perhaps because
of this phrase; see 108.5 n. Wrong-headed, if
well-intentioned, attempts have been made to
identify 'thou, my lovely boy' as Cupid, the little
god of Love, an identification which, though it
could conceivably fit with lines 1-4 obviously
cannot be applied to the same 'thou', who, in lines
5-12, is declared to be subject to Times 'sickle':
Cupid, as a god, was immune to Time.

1 power . . . . . control, command.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;

"/>

2 Dost hold... hour . . . . A much discussed and
variously emended line (see collation). I have
retained the Q reading because there is con-
siderable disagreement about what needs to be
emended and because the Q reading, though
elliptical and ambiguous, may, nevertheless, bear
two different, but possible, interpretations: (1)
'Holds time's ever-changing (&quot;fickle&quot;) mirror (a
&quot;glass&quot; in which ordinary mortals are forced to
view Time's depredations), his sickle or scythe
(which cuts them down), (and his) hourglass
(which measures out their life-spans)'; (2) 'Holds
Time's ever-running (&quot;fickle&quot;) hourglass, his
sickle or scythe, (and his) hour (i.e. the moment
when he summons his accomplice Death to take
ordinary mortals)'. As (1) and (2) illustrate, one
principal difficulty lies in the different meanings
that may be attached to 'glass' and 'hour'.
Kerrigan has noted that 'glass' for 'hourglass'
may be paralleled in WT 4.1.16, where Time,
acting as the Chorus, says 'I turn my glass.' 'hour'
for 'hourglass', though hitherto unrecorded in that
sense, occurs in George Peele's (?) Histrio-Mastix
(1610; revised by John Marston c. 1599), 3.1.19-
20: 'Then thus, (as soveraigne Empresse of all
sinnes) / Pryde turnes her houre, and heere her
Sceane beginnes.' While the Q pointing
apparently gives Time three characteristic
attributes (though a mirror, unlike the hourglass
and scythe/sickle (compare 116.10), is not
conventionally associated with pictorial
representations of Father Time), most recent
editors reduce these to two and read Q's 'sickle,
hower' as either 'sickle hour' or 'sickle-hour' (see
collation), both of which may be interpreted to
mean 'the moment when Time cuts us down in
death'. On Shakespeare's use of noun-
compounds, see Abbott 430. If emendation is
considered necessary, these readings, among the
various others proposed, seem most acceptable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,

"/>

3 Who hast. . . grown . . . . i.e. who, experiencing
Time's decaying action ('waning', which ordin-
arily results in the loss of beauty, strength, etc.),
has only grown more 'lovely' (1). The 'waning/
growing' paradox may have been suggested by
the shape and action of an 'hourglass', in which as
the sand 'wanes' in the upper part it 'grows' in the
lower and is ready to be reused, unchanged by the
passage of 'time', when the 'glass' is turned
(Tobin). The influence of Ovid, Metamorphoses
xv, 178-83 (Golding, 198-203), has been
suggested: 'Things eb and flow, . . . / Even so the
tymes by kynd / Doo fly and follow bothe at once,
and evermore renew.' Kerrigan compares lines 3-
6 in George Peele's (?) 'sonnet' attached to
Polyhymnia (1590): 'His youth 'gainst
time and age bath ever spurn'd, / But spurn'd in
vain; youth waneth by increasing: / Beauty,
strength, youth are flowers, but fading seen; /
Duty, faith, love are roots, and ever green', and
notes how the poem, generally, resonates with A
Lover's C'omplaint, 59-60, and many of the
underlying themes in the Sonnets.

3 show'st . . . . shows up, reveals (by contrast).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.

"/>

4 lovers withering . . . . (1) friends, (2) lovers (with
sexual implications) suffering from the decaying
effects of Time ('withering'). 'lovers' is doubly
ambiguous, in meaning (see 31.10 n. and 32.4 n.)
and form. It is possible to interpret Q 'louers' as
simply plural, or as 'lover's' or 'lovers'', since the
use of an apostrophe to indicate the possessive
form was almost never used at this time. Without
exception, however, editors have retained 'lovers'
as a simple plural, even though 'lover's' as
referring specifically to the poet may be, as Dover
Wilson admits, attractive.

4 as . . . . . even as, while.

4 grow'st . . . . increases (in beauty, strength, etc.).
Picks up 'grown' (s).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 5. If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)

"/>

5 If Nature (sovereign... wrack) . . . . If Nature,
who is the supreme ruler over ruin. Compare
'great creating Nature' (WT. 4.4.88). The seeming
paradox by which Nature is declared to rule over
Time's 'wrack' but is finally subject to Time (see
lines 9-12) may be resolved by viewing Nature as
Ovid does in Metamorphoses XV, 252-5
(Golding, 276-9): 'No kind of thing keepes ay his
shape and hew. / For nature loving ever chaunge
repayres one shape a new / Uppon another,
neyther dooth there perrish aught (trust mee) / In
all the world, but altring takes new shape.' Nature,
then, is endlessly creating new forms out of the
old, thus renewing Time's 'wrack'; in this sense
she is preeminent; but Time inexorably produces
the very 'wrack' she renews, and, though for a
while she may seemingly delay Time's action (or
even reverse it), she, like her creations, is sooner
or later subject to Time. Note the conditional
construction ('If'): if ...

In order to maintain the abstract level of reading, I think
it's logical to capitalize the personifications of Boy,
Time, Nature, but not &quot;quietus.&quot; Death is represented in
the &quot;quietus,&quot; but not named as antagonist to Love? This
would emphasize Boy as Cupid, suggesting &quot;thy lovers&quot; as all
people in love, but alluding to addressee, as well. In this
we can see the image of the moon &quot;waning&quot; (becoming pale and
sickly) as love grows (groans), being pale and groaning
characteristic of the convention; and perhaps a buried image
of planting by night. I agree that &quot;minion of her pleasure&quot;
would not refer to Cupid, though.

On the whole, my impression is that S follows the derivative
convention of using classical personifications of abstract
ideas yet shows greater insight involving subtle nuances of
their interactions. I see some suggestion that Nature, who
&quot;may detain, but not still keep, her treasure,&quot; also
represents something of Love and perhaps a distracting SO.

Well, no one else has taken up the challenge.
(Why should that be? I wonder. Hmm . . . )

Anyway, I'll go through GBE's exegesis and score
it against mine (in an entirely objective manner, of
course). I award points where the interpretations
fit the sense of the words and their tone. I deduct
them where there is an obvious error or omission.
(GBE often omits; and I often score in the same
place.) If you think that I have gone wrong, please
point out where and how. (Note that I have not
repeated all the points I made in my first post.)

The purpose of the exercise is to bring out (in a
roughly quantifiable manner) just how bad Strat
exegeses are, set against mine -- when we focus
closely on each line and each phrase. However
I am not particularly picking on GBE -- any other
Strat would be at least as bad.

My principal aim here is to challenge Strats (and
anyone else). How could I possibly get so much
apparently sounding right _IF_it_was_wrong_?

Btw, I don't expect a response. It's much more
comfortable to keep your head buried deep in
the sand.

GBE goes quite wrong here. Time is not a 'she'.
It is Nature (the Boy's 'sovereign mistress') who
demands that final accounting. Other Strats do

It must impress someone. Like all Strat
commentators he misses 'sovereign mistress'.

GBE also cannot point to any significance of
'wrack' (i.e. ruin). How does Nature preside
over ruin? {Crowley 12, GBE -8}.
Of course, he misses all the marine puns on
'wrack' and their relevance to the 'Buoy'. {Crowley 13, GBE -8}
The poet was making another point about
their mistress -- one that he made almost
routinely in these years -- that she wrecking
the state with her irresponsible behaviour
-- in not marrying Alencon, or someone
else by whom she could have an heir. {Crowley 14, GBE -8} 999

This poem was clearly not intended to be a 14-liner. There was no final

There is no sarcasm because there is nothing to suggest sarcasm. &quot;Lovely boy&quot;
is a very standard phrase meaning beautiful youth. How could the poet have

&gt; he misses the pun on 'whore' in 'hower'.
&gt; Since that's a major function of the line,
&gt; it's quite a howler.
{Crowley 4, GBE -4}

&gt; However, it is not possible to get near the
&gt; meaning without some sense of the context,
&gt; whereby the 'Boy' is holding up a 'fickle mirror' {Crowley 5, GBE -4}
&gt; to 'Nature' (his fickle mistress) {Crowley
6,GBE -4}
&gt; obscuring Time's sickle, as well as being 'sick'
&gt; (anyone ever seen Daniel 'O'Donnell, or Liberace
&gt; -- that's the kind of 'sick' the poet means) {Crowley 7,
GBE -4}

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,

&gt;&gt; 3 Who hast. . . grown . . . . i.e. who, experiencing
&gt;&gt; Time's decaying action ('waning', which ordin-
&gt;&gt; arily results in the loss of beauty, strength, etc.),
&gt;&gt; has only grown more 'lovely'

&gt; Here GBE descends into the usual Stratfordian
&gt; waffle. Again, without context, the line is fairly
&gt; meaningless. Ralegh's whining about his
&gt; poverty had enabled him to grow extremely rich
&gt; -- leading to the problems indicated in the next line. {Crowley 8,
GBE -4}

&gt; Further Ralegh's degeneracy into a flattering
&gt; courtier was a waning from manhood. Yet
&gt; he had grown rich by it.
{Crowley 9, GBE -4}

&gt;&gt; 3 show'st . . . . shows up, reveals (by contrast).

&gt; There is nothing about 'by contrast' in this line.
&gt; GBE is desperate grasping for imaginary straws. {Crowley 9, GBE -5}

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.

&gt;&gt; 4 lovers withering . . . . (1) friends, (2) lovers (with
&gt;&gt; sexual implications) suffering from the decaying
&gt;&gt; effects of Time ('withering').

&gt; Ralegh's &quot;withering&quot; comments about his friends
&gt; were well-known and are nicely set against 'thy
&gt; sweet self&quot;
{Crowley 10,
&gt; GBE -5}

&gt;&gt; 'lovers' is doubly
&gt;&gt; ambiguous, in meaning (see 31.10 n. and 32.4 n.)
&gt;&gt; and form. It is possible to interpret Q 'louers' as
&gt;&gt; simply plural, or as 'lover's' or 'lovers'', since the
&gt;&gt; use of an apostrophe to indicate the possessive
&gt;&gt; form was almost never used at this time. Without
&gt;&gt; exception, however, editors have retained 'lovers'
&gt;&gt; as a simple plural, even though 'lover's' as
&gt;&gt; referring specifically to the poet may be, as Dover
&gt;&gt; Wilson admits, attractive.

&gt; I had overlooked the ambiguity here, taking
&gt; 'lovers' solely as a plural; it is undoubtedly
&gt; meant in that sense -- an ironic reference to
&gt; how Ralegh was regarded by fellow courtiers.
&gt; GBE, naturally, must miss anything slightly
&gt; subtle, such as the manifest irony of 'thy
&gt; sweet self' {Crowley 10,
GBE -6}

&gt; However, taking &quot;lovers&quot; as possessive
&gt; (i.e. &quot;lover's&quot;) the poet is suggesting that
&gt; Ralegh's growing (in wealth) is showing up
&gt; the 'withering of the Queen' . . her ageing,
&gt; and rapidly vanishing fertility. {Crowley 10, GBE -6}

&gt;&gt; 4 grow'st . . . . increases (in beauty, strength, etc.).
&gt;&gt; Picks up 'grown' (s).

&gt; There is, in the poet's view, only one person
&gt; around here who should be 'growing' -- and
&gt; that the Boy's lover -- the Queen. Yet it is
&gt; only this low knave who is growing --
&gt; if only in wealth. {Crowley 11,
GBE -6}

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)

&gt;&gt; 5 If Nature (sovereign... wrack) . . . . If Nature,
&gt;&gt; who is the supreme ruler over ruin. Compare
&gt;&gt; 'great creating Nature' (WT. 4.4.88). The seeming
&gt;&gt; paradox by which Nature is declared to rule [..]

&gt; GBE descends into usual Stratfordian waffle.
&gt; It must impress someone. Like all Strat
&gt; commentators he misses 'sovereign mistress'.
&gt; Who on earth could an Elizabethan poet be
&gt; pointing at with such a phrase? (Silly question
&gt; for a Strat, of course) {Crowley 12, GBE -7}

&gt; GBE also cannot point to any significance of
&gt; 'wrack' (i.e. ruin). How does Nature preside
&gt; over ruin? {Crowley 12, GBE -8}.
&gt; Of course, he misses all the marine puns on
&gt; 'wrack' and their relevance to the 'Buoy'. {Crowley 13, GBE -8}
&gt; The poet was making another point about
&gt; their mistress -- one that he made almost
&gt; routinely in these years -- that she wrecking
&gt; the state with her irresponsible behaviour
&gt; -- in not marrying Alencon, or someone
&gt; else by whom she could have an heir. {Crowley 14, GBE -8} 999

&gt;&gt;Note the conditional
&gt;&gt; construction ('If'): if Nature acts as she appears to
&gt;&gt; do in lines 6-8 she does so only from self-interest,
&gt;&gt; not

&gt;&gt;&gt; bases for eternity' (see 125.3 n.).

&gt;&gt;This is something I missed. But it fits my
&gt;&gt;interpretation perfectly -- and not the Stratfordian
&gt;&gt;Why is there no mention of 'immortality here? --
&gt;&gt;Because it is addressed to a 'base knave' who,
&gt;&gt;in the poet's view, deserves ignominy. (Crowley 1, GBE -1)

He is the 'lovely Boy' -- and comes up in most

&gt;&gt;GBE misses the 'mawkishness' of 'lovely Boy'

&gt; There is no sarcasm because there is nothing to suggest sarcasm. &quot;Lovely boy&quot;
&gt; is a very standard phrase meaning beautiful youth.

I quoted Bookburn's commentator for you:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. my lovely boy - Some commentators have objected to

Get real. It is put into direct speech. &quot;O thou my

another person in such a way? Almost every
instance in common speech, in TV soaps, or in
literature, of such a form of address indicates
sarcasm -- or a similar edge.

Here, I think, we have another illustration of the
American (and academic) unfamiliarity with the
more subtle tones of speech. Americans dislike
them. Brits tend to have sharper tongues, and
speak with more indirection.

Of course it's there. My reading fits the Quarto
punctuation. Are you saying that 'hower' was
NOT an Elizabethan spelling of 'whore'? Most
Strat editors remove the comma before 'hower',
(and all 'modernise' the spelling) destroying any
possibility of it being read in that way. But nearly
all admit to puzzlement, including GBE:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; siderable disagreement about what needs to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; emended and because the Q reading, though
&gt;&gt;&gt; elliptical and ambiguous . . .

"/>

Stratfordian editors, with their middle-class
puritan (and often Victorian) inheritance, simply
do not expect their 'gentle Shake-speare' to use
coarse, vulgar terms of abuse. They do not see
him calling his 'lovely Boy', a &quot;whore&quot;. The
blinders they wear hide the most obvious facts.

As GBE indicates, most Strats spend a lot of
time on this line, speculating what a 'sickle-hour'
could be (having changed the comma into a
hyphen -- hey, whatsa problem? Isn't a comma
more-or-less the same as a hyphen?)

This is Katherine Duncan-Jones in a typically
Stratfordian-Alzheimers state:

&quot; his sickle hour -- It seems initially tempting to follow Bernard
Lintott and others (Rollins, 1.319-21) in emending Q's sickle
to 'fickle', especially since the 'fi' and 'si' ligatures in Q are
almost identical (see for instance the second sins in 35.8), and
a compositor might readily pick up one in error for the other: the
sense would be 'his fickle hour (-glass)'. However on the 'difficilior
lectio' principle it is preferable to retain sickle, construed as an
adjectival noun: 'the hour when Time's (=death's) sickle cuts off
life'. In 116.10 the speaker had proclaimed love's ability to stand
out of reach of Time's bending sickle's compass; and the unique
phrase sickle hour - time of harvest, when ripe corn is cut -
matches the field of imagery of waning, withering and 'growing'
in the next two lines. The youth, though growing, has the ability to
hold back or defer the moment of harvest when what is fully ripe
is reaped with a sickle. . . . &quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;obscuring Time's sickle, as well as being 'sick'

&gt; sick isn't there.

Having a tin ear is one thing. Being proud of it
is another. The consistent Stratfordian strategy
is to reduce meaning. The less meaning that
you claim is present, then the less you fail to
explain.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,

"/>

These discussions may seem pointless. But
they are not. Somehow, up to now, I have missed
a vital point. The quarto line is NOT as above. It's

&quot;Who hast by wayning growne,and therein shou'st, &quot;

And &quot;shou'st&quot; is NOT a misprint for 'showest'. '
Show' is _never_ (as far as I can see) printed
like that in the canon. The word is 'shove' --
Elizabethans had 'u' here rather than a 'v'. An
instance in Ant.&amp; Cleo (Act I, Sc 2) also brings
in 'pluck back':
&quot;The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.&quot;

3. Who hast by wayning growne,and therein shovest,
4. Thy lovers withering,as thy sweet selfe growest.

The poet was saying that Ralegh SHOVED his
way into the court -- an exalted circle where one
of his kind had no place. He also implies
'showest' (to rhyme with 'growest') -- leaving the
reader to consider both.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 lovers withering . . . . (1) friends, (2) lovers (with

&gt;&gt;&gt; effects of Time ('withering').

&gt;&gt;Ralegh's &quot;withering&quot; comments about his friends
&gt;&gt;were well-known and are nicely set against 'thy

&gt;&quot;in comparison&quot; is a &quot;desperate grasping,&quot; but you can slip &quot;comments&quot; in
&gt; without fear of being seen as straining.

'Withering' is automatically associated with words,
looks or 'comments'. How come you don't know
that? Is the expression 'withering comment' not
current in America -- since it's not an American
thing to do?

The poem is as clear as can be, and serves as a nice envoi to
the ideas expressed in the previous sonnets, especially the
first 17. Sonnet 4 reads
4
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,
Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
And being frank she lends to those are free:
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
Profitless usurer why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?
For having traffic with thy self alone,
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
Which used lives th' executor to be. (see also sonnets 67,68)

Here is 126:

O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle hour:
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,
She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!
Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
And her quietus is to render thee.

Notice the similar theme of &quot;nature&quot; (and its similar
function) and &quot;audit&quot;. The &quot;lovely boy&quot; is the young man
of this part of the sonnet sequence, not Cupid, as there
is nothing to indicate in 126 that Cupid has anything to do with
Nature, the passage of time or its effect on beauty.

&gt;Stratfordian-Alzheimers state:

&gt;&quot; his sickle hour -- It seems initially tempting to follow Bernard
&gt;Lintott and others (Rollins, 1.319-21) in emending Q's sickle
&gt;to 'fickle', especially since the 'fi' and 'si' ligatures in Q are
&gt;almost identical (see for instance the second sins in 35.8), and
&gt;a compositor might readily pick up one in error for the other: the
&gt;sense would be 'his fickle hour (-glass)'. However on the 'difficilior
&gt;lectio' principle it is preferable to retain sickle, construed as an
&gt;adjectival noun: 'the hour when Time's (=death's) sickle cuts off
&gt;life'. In 116.10 the speaker had proclaimed love's ability to stand
&gt;out of reach of Time's bending sickle's compass; and the unique
&gt;phrase sickle hour - time of harvest, when ripe corn is cut -
&gt;matches the field of imagery of waning, withering and 'growing'
&gt;in the next two lines. The youth, though growing, has the ability to
&gt;hold back or defer the moment of harvest when what is fully ripe
&gt;is reaped with a sickle. . . . &quot;

That certainly makes sense to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,

&gt;These discussions may seem pointless. But
&gt;they are not. Somehow, up to now, I have missed
&gt;a vital point. The quarto line is NOT as above. It's

&gt;&quot;Who hast by wayning growne,and therein shou'st, &quot;

&gt;And &quot;shou'st&quot; is NOT a misprint for 'showest'. '
&gt;Show' is _never_ (as far as I can see) printed
&gt;like that in the canon. The word is 'shove' --
&gt;Elizabethans had 'u' here rather than a 'v'. An
&gt;instance in Ant.&amp; Cleo (Act I, Sc 2) also brings
&gt;in 'pluck back':
&gt;&quot;The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.&quot;

&gt; 3. Who hast by wayning growne,and therein shovest,
&gt; 4. Thy lovers withering,as thy sweet selfe growest.

&gt;The poet was saying that Ralegh SHOVED his
&gt;way into the court -- an exalted circle where one
&gt;of his kind had no place. He also implies
&gt;'showest' (to rhyme with 'growest') -- leaving the
&gt;reader to consider both.

He's shoved his lovers withering? Makes lots of sense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 lovers withering . . . . (1) friends, (2) lovers (with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sexual implications) suffering from the decaying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effects of Time ('withering').

&gt;&gt;&gt;Ralegh's &quot;withering&quot; comments about his friends
&gt;&gt;&gt;were well-known and are nicely set against 'thy
&gt;&gt;&gt;sweet self&quot; (Crowley 10,GBE -5}

&gt;&gt;&quot;in comparison&quot; is a &quot;desperate grasping,&quot; but you can slip &quot;comments&quot; in
&gt;&gt; without fear of being seen as straining.

&gt;'Withering' is automatically associated with words,
&gt;looks or 'comments'. How come you don't know
&gt;that? Is the expression 'withering comment' not
&gt;current in America -- since it's not an American
&gt;thing to do?

"/>

As a non-rigidnik, I know that &quot;withering&quot; can be associated with a hot summer
sun and other things besides words, looks or comments. No chance it could mean
&quot;shrivel,&quot; in keeping with the images of waning, here, though--despite the fact
that it can mean that without having a clarifying word stuck in as you've stuck
in &quot;comments.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Aside from that, it is not the boy but the lovers who are withering.

Not too clearly, but I now see what you meant. I can't see that growth has
anything to do with comments.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'lovers' is doubly

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simply plural, or as 'lover's' or 'lovers'', since the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use of an apostrophe to indicate the possessive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; form was almost never used at this time. Without

I know you expect strictly literal statements in

mirror that Ralegh holds up to the Queen.

fifty, in a position of enormous importance,

in the minds of the people who read my book. I don't mean you will literally
live forever because of my book. Same case here. I have answered your
question.

&gt;&gt;&gt;in that manner?

&gt;&gt;Here we go again. I did it all the time IN POETRY, when that kind of language

&gt;&gt;&gt;sarcasm -- or a similar edge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you miss the sarcasm, you'll miss this.
&gt;&gt;&gt;The words were pronounced and spelt the
&gt;&gt;&gt;same. Its presence is confirmed by the two
&gt;&gt;&gt;'still's including 6. &quot;As thou goest onwards

&gt;&gt;&quot;confirmed.&quot; Right, Paul. That it is not there is confirmed by the fact that
&gt;&gt; it makes no poetic sense, at all.

&gt;A drifting buoy could be said to 'goest onwards
&gt;still'. Good poetry is based on ideas and images.
&gt;Our poet did not lack them -- even if no Strat
&gt;would recognise one if it hit him in the face

"/>

Quite a vivid apt image, this buoy going onwards.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course it's there. My reading fits the Quarto
&gt;&gt;&gt;punctuation. Are you saying that 'hower' was
&gt;&gt;&gt;NOT an Elizabethan spelling of 'whore'? Most
&gt;&gt;&gt;Strat editors remove the comma before 'hower',
&gt;&gt;&gt;(and all 'modernise' the spelling) destroying any
&gt;&gt;&gt;possibility of it being read in that way. But nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;all admit to puzzlement, including GBE:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 Dost hold... hour . . . . A much discussed and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; variously emended line (see collation). I have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; retained the Q reading because there is con-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; siderable disagreement about what needs to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; emended and because the Q reading, though
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elliptical and ambiguous . . .

&gt;&gt; As &quot;hour,&quot; it makes sense. As &quot;whore,&quot; it does not.

&gt;Even when you alter the spelling AND
&gt;the punctuation from ' . . . sickle, hower'
&gt;to ' . . . sickle-hour', it still makes no sense.
&gt;What's a 'sickle-hour' ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;obscuring Time's sickle, as well as being 'sick'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(anyone ever seen Daniel 'O'Donnell, or Liberace
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-- that's the kind of 'sick' the poet means) {Crowley 7, GBE -4}

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sick isn't there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Having a tin ear is one thing. Being proud of it
&gt;&gt;&gt;is another. The consistent Stratfordian strategy
&gt;&gt;&gt;is to reduce meaning. The less meaning that
&gt;&gt;&gt;you claim is present, then the less you fail to
&gt;&gt;&gt;explain.

&gt;&gt; So you are saying time's glass holds his sick whore? Sorry, I no follow.

&gt;&gt;Later note: I see you consider &quot;sick whore&quot; an appositive for the boy, not Time,
&gt;&gt; which it is closer to.

&gt;I know you expect strictly literal statements in
&gt;your 'poetry' (e.g. 'the cat sat on the mat')

"/>

Ah, I see you've carefully read my unitextual (all textual) poetry, which is
nothing but literal statements, of course. (I posted one at HLAS, by the way.)
I say that poetry should make sense, yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;but here our poet is expressing a whole range
&gt;of complex ideas and meanings. The primary
&gt;meaning IMHO of &quot;Time's fickle glass&quot; is the
&gt;mirror that Ralegh holds up to the Queen.

Who is nowhere in the poem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;This is sick -- we have a woman approaching

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Who hast by wayning growne,and therein shovest,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Thy lovers withering,as thy sweet selfe growest.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The poet was saying that Ralegh SHOVED his
&gt;&gt;&gt;way into the court -- an exalted circle where one
&gt;&gt;&gt;of his kind had no place. He also implies
&gt;&gt;&gt;'showest' (to rhyme with 'growest') -- leaving the
&gt;&gt;&gt;reader to consider both.

&gt;&gt; He's shoved his lovers withering? Makes lots of sense.

&gt;Read the lines again. Notice the comma

&gt;invariably remove it. (Well, what else is

One thing is that they would assume the final word of line 3 to rhyme with the

&gt;&gt;&gt;'Withering' is automatically associated with words,

&gt;&gt;&gt;thing to do?

&gt;&gt;As a non-rigidnik, I know that &quot;withering&quot; can be associated with a hot summer
&gt;&gt;sun and other things besides words, looks or comments. No chance it could mean
&gt;&gt;&quot;shrivel,&quot; in keeping with the images of waning, here, though--despite the fact
&gt;&gt;that it can mean that without having a clarifying word stuck in as you've stuck
&gt;&gt; in &quot;comments.&quot;

&gt;'Withering' here means both.
&gt;Although I accept
&gt;that you, as a rigidnik, will insist that it can mean
&gt;only one thing.

"/>

A word by a good poet in a good poem will always PRIMARILY mean one thing.
Secondary meanings will apply only if appropriate. &quot;Withering&quot; could mean also
what you say here if your other interpretations made sense, which they do not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'lovers' is doubly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ambiguous, in meaning (see 31.10 n. and 32.4 n.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and form. It is possible to interpret Q 'louers' as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simply plural, or as 'lover's' or 'lovers'', since the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use of an apostrophe to indicate the possessive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; form was almost never used at this time. Without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exception, however, editors have retained 'lovers'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as a simple plural, even though 'lover's' as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; referring specifically to the poet may be, as Dover
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wilson admits, attractive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I had overlooked the ambiguity here, taking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'lovers' solely as a plural; it is undoubtedly

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; baloney

&gt;&gt;&gt;What are you talking about? All commentators
&gt;&gt;&gt;take it as being plural.

&gt;Oops -- I see that Katherine Duncan-Jones
&gt;opts for the singular possessive. (She
&gt;considers the plural but, on balance,
&gt;rejects it.)

&gt;&gt; Your &quot;undoubtedly&quot; is baloney/

&gt;What's baloney about it? No one (including
&gt;you) has expressed any doubt here AFAIK
&gt;-- as to the plural being reasonable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is nothing in the poem about the rendering of Nature.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The poet cleverly allows a reading of &quot;Time will
&gt;&gt;&gt;disgrace Nature&quot; (the 'sovereign mistress over
&gt;&gt;&gt;wrack'). Of course, the single-track minds of
&gt;&gt;&gt;Strats never see that possibility.

&gt;&gt; Because it's not there. If it is, explain how.

&gt;7. She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
&gt;8. May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.

&gt;We can read this as (a) her skill will disgrace
&gt;time (the usual meaning to be taken), or as
&gt;(b) time will disgrace her skill -- a meaning that
&gt;the poet particularly wants us to see; he believes
&gt;that in time the Queen's current behaviour will
&gt;be seen as utterly disgraceful. There will, he
&gt;believes, be a civil war on (or before) her death,
&gt;over the succession, probably based on the
&gt;religious divide.

1. O thou my lovely Boy who in thy power,
2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hower;
3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein showest,
4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest.
5. If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)
6. As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
7. She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
8. May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.
9. Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,
10. She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!
11. Her *Audit* (though delayed) answered must be,
12. And her *Quietus* is to render thee.

To you, my lovely Boy, who [seemingly] have the power,
to stop Time's hourglass, and make his sickle HOVER
[hover = be suspended in air, not descending]

[&quot;sickle&quot; is the correct word here, by the way. A sickle is a
one-hand tool: Time carries the glass in one hand, the sickle in the
other. If it were a scythe, which is a two-hand tool, Time could not
also carry the glass.]

Who has by aging grown [in beauty], and thereby show,
Thy lover's withering [in beauty by comparison], as they sweet self
growest. [more beautiful]

If Nature (sovereign mistress over destruction)
As you go onward [toward decay] still will pull you back,

She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.

[The disgracing of time means the dethroning of time: time is not
royal here, but having been dethroned becomes common, thus &quot;time&quot; gets
no capitalization. Nature is using the lovely boy for her own
purpose, to show her sovereignty over common time and his wretched
minutes.]

Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,
She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!

[A warning to the boy, since the seeming power he has, that was first
mentioned, is not truly his own. He is Nature's favorite, for now,
but she will not hold him forever.]

Her _Audit_ (though delayed) answered must be,
And her _Quietus_ is to render thee.

[An audit is a hearing. The quietus, then, is when speech is
finished. After all has been said, the boy will be rendered, handed
over, to common time.]

There are no lines missing, probably. First, it is not a sonnet.
Second, &quot;quietus&quot; means an end to speech, an end of the &quot;hearing.&quot;
Third, to render is to hand over.

The closing lines are a reminder of the whole exercise. The sonnets
to the lovely boy have been an audit, a hearing, in which the poet has
pled his case. Now we have reached the quietus, following the
hearing, speech is finished, and the boy is handed over to common
time. As it stands the poem is, and has, a proper end to the sequence
of sonnets to the boy.

======================================

John Donne in a letter to Sir Henry Wotton:

&quot;Sir, more than kisses, letters mingle souls.&quot;

Or this one to Mr. Rowland Woodward:

&quot;...And with vaine outward things be no more moved,
But to know, that I loved thee and would be loved.&quot;

or these poems written also to his friends Rowland Woodward
and Thomas Woodward:

If, as mine is, thy life a slumber be,
Seem, when thou read'st these lines, to dream of me,
Never did Morpheus nor his brother wear
Shapes so like those shapes, whom they would appear,
As this my letter is like me, for it
Hath my name, words, hand, feet, heart, mind and wit;
It is my deed of gift of me to thee,
It is my will, my self the legacy.
So thy retirings I love, yea envy,
Bred in thee by a wise melancholy,
That I rejoice, that unto where thou art,
Though I stay here, I can thus send my heart,
As kindly as any enamored patient,
His picture to his absent love has sent.

Pregnant again with th'old twins hope, and fear,
Oft have I asked for thee, both how and where
Thou wert, and what my hopes of letters were;
As in the streets sly beggars narrowly
Watch motions of the givers hand and eye,
And evermore conceive some hope thereby.
And now thy almes is given, thy letter's read,
The body risen again, the which was dead,
And thy poor starveling bountifully fed.
After this banquet my soul doth say grace,
And praise thee for it, and zealously embrace
Thy love, though I think thy love in this case
To be as gluttons, which say midst their meat,
They love the best of which the most do eat.

Haste thee harsh verse as fast as thy lame measure
Will give thee leave, to him; my pain and pleasure.
I have given thee, and yet thou art too weak,
Feet, and a reasoning soule and tongue to speak.
Plead for me, and so by thine and my labor
I am thy Creator, thou my Saviour.
Tell him, all questions, which men have defended
Both of the place and paines of hell, are ended;
And tis decreed our hell is but privation
Of him, at least in earth's habitation:
And tis where I am, where in every street
Infections follow, overtake and meet.
Live I or die, by you my love is sent,
And you are my pawns, or else my testament.
==================================

Or how about Ben Jonson's dedication of Poetaster:

&quot;To My Worthy Friend,
Mr. Richard Martin:
...Enjoy now the delight of your goodness, which is to
see that prosper, you preserved; and posterity to owe
the reading of that, without offence, to your name,
which so much ignorance and malice of the times then
conspired to have suppressed.
Your true lover,
Ben Jonson&quot;

This example is from Jonson's EMIHH:
(This was the original version that Jonson wrote, set in Florence.
The names and some of the text were re-written to give the more
familiar version. This is the scene where in the revised version
Old Knowell reads the letter his son wrote to his friend Wellbred
(Lorenzo in this version)):

Every Man in His Humour:
Act 1 sc 2:

&quot;Sirrah, sweet villain, come and see me; but spend one
minute in my company, and it is enough: I think I have a world of
good jests for thee: o sirrah, I can shew thee two of the most
perfect, rare, and absolute true Gulls, that ever
thou saw'st, if thou wilt come. S'blood, invent some famous
memorable lie, or other, to flap thy father in the mouth withal:
thou hast been father of a thousand, in thy days,
thou could'st be no Poet else: any scurvy roguish excuse will serve;
say thou com'st but to fetch wool for thine Ink-horn. And then
too, thy Father will say thy wits are a wool-gathering. But it is
no matter; the worse, the better. Anything is good enough for
the old man. Sirrah, how if thy Father should see this now? what
would he think of me? Well, (however I write to thee) I reverence
him in my soul, for the general good all Florence delivers of him.
Lorenzo, I conjure thee (by what, let me see) by the depth of
our love, by all the strange sights we have seen in our dayes,
(aye or nights either) to come to me to Florence this day.&quot;
============================================

And then there are the homosexual sonnets of Richard
Barnfield (1595). Note carefully Shakespeare's and Donne's
use of terms of love with regard to their male friendships,
and see the difference between them and Barnfield's
physical desire:

Barnfield Sonnet 8:

Sometimes I wish that I his pillow were,
So might I steal a kiss, and yet not seen,
So might I gaze upon his sleeping eine,
Although I did it with a panting fear.
But when I well consider how vaine my wish is,
Ah foolish bees (think I) that do not suck
His lips for honey, but poor flowers do pluck
Which have no sweet in them, when his sole kisses
Are able to revive a dying soul.
Kiss him, but sting him not, for if you do,
His angry voice your flying will pursue.
But when they hear his tongue, what can control
Their back return? For then they plain may see,
How honeycombs from his lips dropping be.

Barnfield sonnet 17

Cherry-lipped Adonis in his snowy shape,
Might not compare with his pure ivory white,
On whose fair front a poet's pen may write,
Whose rosiate red excels the crimson grape,
His love-enticing delicate soft limbs,
And rarely framed t'intrap poor gazing eyes.
His cheeks, the lily and carnation dies,
With lovely tincture which Apollo dims.
His lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet,
His mouth a hive, his tongue a honeycomb,
Where Muses (like Bees) make their mansion.
His teeth pure pearl in blushing coral set.
Oh how can such a body sin-procuring,
Be slow to love, and quick to hate, enduring?

sense of &quot;audit&quot; also consistent with Shakespeare's use of the word
in his sonnet 4.

For all the usual reasons -- to show how clever

You've missed the point here. Elizabethan

situations where we would say 'a friend'.
That is not a problem. The question here

'Glass' means 'mirror' in the canon FAR more
frequently than it means 'hour-glass'. The poet
was, of course, punning on both senses. But a
'fickle glass' makes much more sense as a
mirror than as an hour-glass. And with Ralegh
-- presenting a false 'mirror' to the Queen (as was
his role), we have a real context for all the word-

No, you mutt. Her skill (which time will reveal as
disgraceful) kills wretched minutes (i.e. distracts
her from her duty to the nation -- and will also kill
wretched minor officials, such as Ralegh). She
may not intend that to be so, but that is what will

Agreed. However, audit also has what one might call the more basic
meaning of a hearing, of speech, and quietus the meaning of quiet,
when speech has ended. Those elemental meanings are brought forth
rather strongly here, to my reading of the poem.

Not that the higher meanings of the terms are absent. Shakespeare had
a rare talent to call forth a range of meaning, not ordinary ambiguity
but a variety of pertinent and compatible meanings. The range, or
depth, of meaning he could achieve is one of the features that makes
his poetry great. In my view.

&gt;&gt; Quite wrong. The manner in which males addressed each other
&gt;&gt; was quite different in Shakespeare's time.

&gt;You've missed the point here. Elizabethan
&gt;men readily called themselves 'a lover' in
&gt;situations where we would say 'a friend'.
&gt;That is not a problem. The question here
&gt;is what would it mean to say to someone
&gt;&quot;O thou my lovely Boy . &quot; or &quot;O thou minion
&gt;of her pleasure . &quot; ? What does such a form

The first indicates that the poet thought the boy beautiful. That some consider
this mawkish, as I do not although I find a lot of Shakespeare's language
elsewhere mawkish, is irrelevant. None but you find it sarcastic. The second
indicates that he considered the boy a &quot;darling&quot; of Nature, &quot;darling&quot; being the
main meaning of the word, &quot;minion,&quot; here, according to my Folger collection of
the sonnets. The second meaning--yes, there is a valid second meaning here,
Paul--as slave of Time, as are we all, also fits.

Tell, me, if the boy is despised, where comes this power of his to hold time in
abeyance? Or is that a sarcasm, too?

Good point there, Tom. An excessive use of &quot;thou&quot;
and &quot;thy&quot; was indeed indicative of aggression:

SIR TOBY BELCH . . . if thou thou'st him some
thrice, it shall not be amiss . . .

Do a search in the canon (or in any other Elizabethan
text) on &quot;O thou&quot; (42 occurrences in the canon).
The uses are mostly derogatory; occasionally (as
when addressed to God) they are prayerful. Only
once (I think) in the canon is affection indicated.
But when the 'O thou' occurs twice in 12 lines and
precedes over-the-top phrases like &quot; . . my lovely
Boy&quot; and &quot; . . minion of her pleasure&quot; then (unless
we are idiotic purblind Strats) we can have no doubt
as to the presence of sarcasm.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Anther good point, Tom. 'Goest' was an old-

as it is for us, (occurring only 12 times in the canon.)
Its purpose was to reinforce the comic or derogatory
force of 'thou'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and &quot;treasure&quot;

Hey, Tom, you are getting into this. To quote from
&quot;Naughty Shakespeare&quot; by Michael Macrone

&quot; Treasure:
&quot;A woman's sexual zone-especially a virgin's-is sometimes poetically
depicted as a hidden box or chest full of sensual riches. The evil Iachimo
plots to make Posthumus believe that he has &quot;pick'd the bock and ta'en!
The treasure of [Imogen's] honour&quot; (Cymbeline, 11.11.41-42). Consider
the &quot;loss your honour may sustain&quot;, Polonius advises his daughter, before
you &quot;lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open&quot; to Hamlet (Hamlet,
I.iii.29-32). In the first case, &quot;honour&quot; means &quot;virginity&quot;; in the second,
&quot;(sexual) reputation&quot; or &quot;market value&quot;. The rudest example is in Titus
Andronicus &quot;There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;!
There serve your lust, shadowed from heaven's eye,! and revel in
Lavinia's treasury (11.1.129-31).&quot;

This was wrong -- I was not thinking. The poet
exploits a &quot;Cupid-like&quot; theme thoroughly and
consistently. In fact, he is referring to the Cupid-
like infant figure of Time, shown with an hour-
glass (an example is seen perched on the top
of the Stratman's memorial. Obviously, Time
has an effect on beauty -- and on female
beauty above all -- fertility dies. (Male 'beauty'
is, in effect, a non-existent phenomenon. Even
if it might be said to exist, it has no relevance.)

Nature is brought in as another god-like being,
but her significance here is mainly to represent
the Queen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;disgraceful) kills wretched minutes (i.e. distracts
&gt;&gt;&gt;her from her duty to the nation -- and will also kill
&gt;&gt;&gt;wretched minor officials, such as Ralegh).

&gt;&gt; Ah, we are to see that wretched minutes equal duty to the nation?

&gt;What are you on about? The poet is bitterly
&gt;complaining that the Queen is NOT doing her
&gt;duty by the nation and is wasting her precious
&gt;minutes on this idle, worthless knave.

&gt;&gt;And somehow understand that that &quot;and&quot; is to be ignored--that is, skill, which
&gt;&gt; time may disgrace, will kill, even though the text says, &quot;may disgrace AND.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;7. She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;8. May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.

&gt;You are (I think) arguing that if this were a legal
&gt;document, the 'and' should be replaced with
&gt;something like 'while' -- to avoid any risk of
&gt;ambiguity or uncertainty. Maybe you have a tiny
&gt;sliver of a 'logical' or 'grammatical' point here;
&gt;it's a soundly rigidnikal one -- and one that
&gt;reveals a deep chasm of poetical insensibility.

What is the &quot;and&quot; doing there except telling us that whatever disgraces also
kills?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;She may not intend that to be so, but that is what will

&gt;&gt; Right, the banal aims of all other poets, which is to write mere poems, being

&gt;All poems stand on their own grounds.
&gt;Shakespeare had a particular method --

First it's a 'thou-ing'. Secondly, it's repeated.

Of course it's sarcasm. But it is also (in the
poet's view) the truth. The low scoundrel did
have power -- to stop the Queen from getting
on with her duty -- of marrying Alencon and
having an heir by him. If he had done what
he should have -- and gone off to America,
or some other godforsaken place, then the
Queen might have married and done the
right thing by her country. His 'power' was to
hold a mirror to the Queen -- in such as way
as to prevent her from seeing the truth.
Perhaps he also presented some illusion
about the sands of time not running as well.

This initial image may well be based on an
actual event witnessed by the poet. It is now
thought that telescopes were secretly in use by
some navies long before they became public

Regarding &quot;shovest,&quot; while I do not agree with your overall scheme of
interpretation, I think you may be on to something there.

&quot;Shovest&quot; certainly follows the pattern of -u- appearing where we
would print -v-. Additionally, the word has meaning and makes sense
in context, given a certain imagery.

Take the imagery of fruit growing on a plant: as the new fruit grows
the old fruit withers and is shoved aside.

3. Who hast by wayning growne,and therein shovest,
4. Thy lovers withering,as thy sweet selfe growest.

A rearrangement, to put the last clause first--

As thy sweet self growest [like a ripening new fruit],
... therein shovest, thy lovers withering [the older fruit is shoved
aside and withers]

So I believe &quot;shovest&quot; could easily be correct. At least, it works
for the idea of sweet, new ripening fruit shoving aside the older
withering fruit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'Glass' means 'mirror' in the canon FAR more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;frequently than it means 'hour-glass'. The poet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;was, of course, punning on both senses. But a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'fickle glass' makes much more sense as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mirror than as an hour-glass. And with Ralegh
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-- presenting a false 'mirror' to the Queen

&gt; I didn't notice this before but &quot;false&quot; can't be right since the mirror is
&gt; showing the lovers withering, which they ideed were, and the queen, in your
&gt; interpretation was.

"/>

My _principal_ interpretation here is to take 'lovers'
as an ironic reference to Ralegh's fellow courtiers,
who all hated him -- for his low origins, his rapid
rise and, above all, for his withering comments.

1. O thou my lovely Boy who in thy power,
2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hower;
3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein shov'st,
4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.

That fits in with 'shovest' -- where, in effect, we
read a semi-colon at the end of line 3.

As I quoted from *Elizabeth* by Anne Somerset, page 337:
&quot;Few others shared Elizabeth's high opinion of Ralegh, for
most people had a violent aversion to him. He was &quot;commonly
noted for using of bitter scoffs and reproachful taunts&quot; in
everyday social intercourse, and his biting and sarcastic tongue
&quot;bred him much dislike&quot; . . Far from being disturbed by his
unpopularity Ralegh positively exulted in it, but though Elizabeth
did not mind that he showed no interest in courting the public,
she was less happy about the fact that he sometimes seemed
to go out of his way to cause gratuitous offence. He was the sort
of man who would &quot;lose a friend to coin a jest&quot; . . &quot;

In any event, the word is 'fickle' so the mirror
can be false in one light and true in another.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Although I agree that the mirror is also there, but as a connotation, not more,

&gt;&gt;How can an hour-glass be 'fickle'?

&gt; inconstant--in this case, flowing faster for the boy's lovers than for the boy

That's ridiculous. A hour-glass can't run at
two speeds at the same time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Are you really saying that there was an actual
&gt;&gt;'boy' -- a fair youth, who was holding an hour-

&gt; The boy held the hourglass in his power. You have the boy, Raleigh, using it to

Not really. I say that there is a superficial theme

sense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I say that the text says the boy's growth is what does the

&gt; did not name him. It was also the fashion of poets not to name real people in
&gt; their lyric poetry, or even much of their satirical poetry.

&gt;&gt;1. O thou my lovely Tom who in thy power,
&gt;&gt;2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hower;

&gt;&gt;Does that sound ok to you?

It is amazing how long it can take to get to the
heart of a problem -- or to see the most crucial
issues. And here we have one. I say that this
sonnet works on two main levels (a) a faux-
classical one, involving the 'gods' of Nature and
of Time, and (b) the real political one of the
Queen and Ralegh. The poet jokingly plays one
against the other.

But Strats can't say anything like that. You say
the poem is a dead straight one, with no edge
of irony or humour. For you the poem must
EITHER be about the 'gods' OR be about a real
person. In parts it is clearly about a real person,
but it is ALSO about the gods of Time and Nature.
You implicitly admit that, yet you can present no
way in which the two levels of meaning can be
linked. So you are stumped. You have to resort
to abuse about 'dealing with cranks'.

&gt;&gt;The text shows 'lovers'; that can and SHOULD

In many ways, this is a mystery. Booth is quite
good on it. We don't have to know exactly what the

We can sense that the words are _right_ even if we

comes through. When I tell you what they mean, you
will say &quot;Is that all&quot; -- feeling quite disappointed
because you expected much more. But the fault lies
at your door (and to some extent, mine) because
neither of us can know, nor fully appreciate the context.
The poet did mean much more, and my account can

You still haven't countered Bob Grumman's point about the rhyme scheme, in
which &quot;shou'st&quot; must rhyme with &quot;grow'st&quot;. This seems to me to rule out your
reading &quot;shovest&quot;. We might argue about the old pronunciation of -ou-
nd -ow-, but the -v- sound you introduce is surely impossible here.

It's not surprising that &quot;shou&quot;, as a complete word, doesn't appear
elsewhere. Even a hurried or careless compositor would hesitate at such an
unEnglish-looking word. One can rather easily accept that, not reading the
sense but glancing at the copy, he would see &quot;sho--&quot; and imagine perhaps
&quot;should'st&quot; was coming up.

Your statistic presumably relies chiefly on the Folio (literatim and in old
spelling, I hope?) but that is surprisingly well done, considering the bulk
of the volume and the problems of editing play texts. The sonnets are, by
contrast, elsewhere hardly free from printer's errors or oddities, are they?
Any unorthodox argument based on details of punctuation or spelling seems
prima facie suspect, especially where (as here) the evidence from the rhyme
enforces one interpretation over the other, and where the obvious reading
makes perfect sense.

Oh yeah? 'Slave of Nature' really runs off the
tongue. We all know exactly what it means
-- I don't think. Actually the poet has come up

slave of the Queen -- who, being female, was
often poetically associated with 'Nature'.

Don't be too quick to scoff. Ralegh was in
charge of the development of that technology.
Hariot worked for him . . living in Durham
House, where he had an observatory on the
roof. So he had the fashionable 'glass' of
those fickle times in his power. He held it
in his hand. Further, his 'perspective glass'
would show people 'waning' and 'growing'.
It could be said to show people 'withering'.
In manipulating the apparatus, there would
have been a fair amount of 'shoving'.

I don't think Paul has yet replied to my observation about this, or else he
snipped it. My observation is that the poem consists of heroic couplets and
&quot;show'st,&quot; besides making perfect sense, rhymes with &quot;grow'st,&quot; while &quot;shov'st&quot;
does not rhyme with &quot;grow'st&quot; (according to my tin ear), and makes little sense
in the context--one plant does not shove others withering, and the poem is about
appearances, not the taking over of territory. Therefore, the poet meant
&quot;show'st,&quot; not &quot;shov'st.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'Glass' means 'mirror' in the canon FAR more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;frequently than it means 'hour-glass'. The poet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;was, of course, punning on both senses. But a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'fickle glass' makes much more sense as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mirror than as an hour-glass. And with Ralegh
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-- presenting a false 'mirror' to the Queen

&gt;&gt; I didn't notice this before but &quot;false&quot; can't be right since the mirror is
&gt;&gt; showing the lovers withering, which they ideed were, and the queen, in your
&gt;&gt; interpretation was.

&gt;My _principal_ interpretation here is to take 'lovers'
&gt;as an ironic reference to Ralegh's fellow courtiers,
&gt;who all hated him -- for his low origins, his rapid
&gt;rise and, above all, for his withering comments.

"/>

Sure. If a word doesn't say what you want it to, use its opposite. In any
case, you haven't answered my argument, which was that if the glass is false,
why is it correctly showing anyone withering? But I forgot that you think
&quot;shou'st&quot; is &quot;shov'st.&quot; But it definitely is not, since &quot;sov'st&quot; does not rhyme
with &quot;grow'st.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;1. O thou my lovely Boy who in thy power,
&gt;2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hower;
&gt;3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein shov'st,

&gt;That fits in with 'shovest' -- where, in effect, we
&gt;read a semi-colon at the end of line 3.

"/>

You don't let others change punctuation. Even sneakily, as you do here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As I quoted from *Elizabeth* by Anne Somerset, page 337:
&gt;&quot;Few others shared Elizabeth's high opinion of Ralegh, for
&gt;most people had a violent aversion to him. He was &quot;commonly
&gt;noted for using of bitter scoffs and reproachful taunts&quot; in
&gt;everyday social intercourse, and his biting and sarcastic tongue
&gt;&quot;bred him much dislike&quot; . . Far from being disturbed by his
&gt;unpopularity Ralegh positively exulted in it, but though Elizabeth
&gt;did not mind that he showed no interest in courting the public,
&gt;she was less happy about the fact that he sometimes seemed
&gt;to go out of his way to cause gratuitous offence. He was the sort
&gt;of man who would &quot;lose a friend to coin a jest&quot; . . &quot;

&gt;In any event, the word is 'fickle' so the mirror
&gt;can be false in one light and true in another.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Although I agree that the mirror is also there, but as a connotation, not
&gt;&gt;more,

&gt;&gt;&gt;How can an hour-glass be 'fickle'?

&gt;&gt;inconstant--in this case, flowing faster for the boy's lovers than for the boy

&gt;That's ridiculous. A hour-glass can't run at
&gt;two speeds at the same time.

"/>

Good grief. Okay, SEEMING to be flowing faster for the boy's lovers than for
the boy--or acting as though it were flowing faster for one than for the other.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you really saying that there was an actual

&gt;&gt;The boy held the hourglass in his power. You have the boy, Raleigh, using it to
&gt;&gt; show something.

&gt;Not really. I say that there is a superficial theme
&gt;addressed to a Cupid-like figure of Time -- which
&gt;is ALSO Ralegh -- in a joking and derogatory

Paul, you've lost me, and I'm getting tired of this argument. So I'm not going
to try to figure out what you mean.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I say that the text says the boy's growth is what does the
&gt;&gt;showing, not the mirror. If the boy were based on a real person, the poet could
&gt;&gt;easily have named him. But I have always said that he went for universality, so
&gt;&gt;did not name him. It was also the fashion of poets not to name real people in
&gt;&gt; their lyric poetry, or even much of their satirical poetry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;1. O thou my lovely Tom who in thy power,
&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hower;

Oh, right, I'm a liar. &quot;boy&quot; is a description placed in a sentence where any

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;against the other.

&gt;But Strats can't say anything like that. You say

&gt;of irony or humour. For you the poem must
&gt;EITHER be about the 'gods' OR be about a real

The two meanings, if there, are linked by the poem's being about the boy, the
real boy, addressed, who is sixty-years-old but looks 22. The poet warns him
that he'll someday look old, too. That's all that's there from any real life.
You don't like that because you are dead to poetry, so need some kind of
political meaning for anything you read to be able to enjoy it (if you really
enjoy anything--except that which you believe confirms your delusional system).

I think you could really learn something if you took the time carefully to
analyze the thought processes of someone you consider a crank, like Paul
Streitz, and determine just how you differ from him--besides by being right

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You just read the queen in the one lover you think &quot;lovers&quot; indicates,

&gt;&gt;&gt;The text shows 'lovers'; that can and SHOULD
&gt;&gt;&gt;be read in three ways: (a) lover's (b) lovers' and
&gt;&gt;&gt;(c) lovers.

&gt;&gt; There is no way to be sure how it SHOULD be read.

&gt;Sure. In many instances all three senses of
&gt;'louers' would not work, or not work equally as well.
&gt;But -- with Shakespeare -- each must be considered.

&gt;&gt; Except that it would not make
&gt;&gt; sense for it to mean both a single lover and many lovers.

&gt;In this case the three senses do work.. It's
&gt;called 'ambiguity'.
&gt;&gt;&gt;When we read &quot;shou'st&quot; (correctly) as &quot;shovest&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;then 'lovers' is necessarily plural.

&gt;&gt; Why?

&gt;OK, I take that back. Line 4 then has to stand
&gt;more-or-less on its own, but I see now that
&gt;&quot;lover's&quot; still works.

It contradicts your interpretation, which--frankly--I can't remember right now.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;All poems stand on their own grounds.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Shakespeare had a particular method --
&gt;&gt;&gt;very well known in poetry -- of the intense
&gt;&gt;&gt;exploitation of ambiguity. Obviously, when
&gt;&gt;&gt;you don't know who he was, or when or
&gt;&gt;&gt;why he was writing, you are going to miss
&gt;&gt;&gt;out on many (and usually most) of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;levels of meaning.

&gt;&gt; But you have argued that he could not write a banal poem--like the Wordsworth
&gt;&gt; one I just mentioned, and like all other great poets I know of did. Why not?

&gt;I would not accept that they are banal. Although
&gt;maybe some are. We'd have to consider them
&gt;one by one.

&gt;&gt;Why had he alone need to write poems that worked as banalities for people like
&gt;&gt;me and also worked as deeply philosophical tracts on world politics for geniuses
&gt;&gt; like you and Baker and Weir?

&gt;In many ways, this is a mystery. Booth is quite
&gt;good on it. We don't have to know exactly what the
&gt;poet meant to appreciate that he meant _something_.
&gt;We can sense that the words are _right_ even if we
&gt;cannot say what they mean. Their power somehow
&gt;comes through. When I tell you what they mean, you
&gt;will say &quot;Is that all&quot; -- feeling quite disappointed
&gt;because you expected much more.

Not me, Paul. I don't much care what a poem means; I care what it does. I
don't expect any good poem to mean very much. I expect it to do special things
with the language.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

1. O thou my lovely Boy who in thy power,
2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hover;
3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein shovest,
4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest.

To you, my lovely Boy, who [seemingly] have the power,
To stop Time's inconstant hourglass, and make his sickle hover
[without descending];
Who have by waning [becoming less of a boy] grown, and therein
shovest,
[shove others aside, as new fruit shoves aside older withering fruit]
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest.

The use of &quot;hover&quot; and &quot;shovest&quot; in lines 2 and 3 respectively gives a
reading that has meaning.

It also gives a sort of abba rhyme, which is interesting. &quot;Rhyme&quot; is
not correct, the proper word escapes me. It gives a visual pattern of
abba for the -w- and -v-. Of course the -er- and -est- endings go
aabb.

In the use of &quot;shovest&quot; there is no implication whatever of the boy
being &quot;pushy&quot; as a defect of character. It's a natural process that
the new growing fruit pushes forward into the sun, as the old fruit
withers, recedes, and soon drops.

I find that &quot;hover&quot; and &quot;shovest&quot; give an interesting, sensible
reading. Millions may disagree.

The poem has remarkable depth. For whom does the boy have power to
stop the hourglass? The poet, for one. As the poet's thoughts turn
to the boy, while he writes, he does not feel the passing of common
minutes. The poet &quot;hands over&quot; the boy with considerable regret. The
poem speaks of the boy, nature, and the poet himself. It's very fine.

Similarly, we have to assume an amazing degree

A clear mistake in one couplet stands right out.
The presumption has to be that &quot;shou'st&quot; is

The sonnets are superior to the Folio texts. The
great bulk of the supposed &quot;printer's errors&quot; are
Stratfordian misreadings -- rather like this one.
The other routine howlers in this sonnet are
(a) the amendment of &quot; . . sickle, hower&quot; into
something like &quot; . . . sickle-hour&quot;,
(b) the conversion of ' . . mynuit' into a plural
' . . . minuits',

such as the removal of the comma after &quot;shou'st&quot;

'Boy' becomes 'boy, 'Nature' becomes 'nature'.

Any argument (orthodox or otherwise) based on

No, it does not make sense. It clashes with the
punctuation -- which Stratfordian editors also
routinely 'improve'. Whereas the reading found
in the source text makes perfect sense, and
(as in line 2) perfectly matches the punctuation.
The only apparent clash is in the rhyme, and the
extent of that clash in Elizabethan pronunciation
is hard to estimate.

Stratfordian editors are appalling. They disregard
the most basic of editorial principles. They have
no respect for the source text. Here the principle
of 'difficilior lectio' applies: we have a logical and
meaningful text which, at first sight, seems wrong.
But on further study we can see that it makes
sense.

It isn't rhyme at all, and even the visual pattern (&quot;eye-rhyme&quot;) is
imperfect. The word you were seeking might be &quot;assonance&quot;, which is created
by matching vowel sounds alone, or &quot;half-rhyme&quot; where the consonants alone
match. Neither applies here.

Can you find any similar non-rhymes elsewhere in the Sonnets? Sometimes
there appear to be such, but AFAIK that's always because of either a known
change of pronunciation since 1600 or a traditional eye-rhyme.

On a related point, Crowley's interpretation of &quot;houer&quot; as &quot;whore&quot; depends
on rhyming &quot;whore&quot; and &quot;power&quot;. Is there evidence that they did in fact
rhyme e.g. with the &quot;cower&quot; vowel or either one of &quot;poor&quot;/ &quot;pore&quot;. &quot;Whore&quot;
is, and was, often said as &quot;hoor&quot;, but was &quot;power&quot; ever &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;pore&quot;?

Agreed that &quot;shov'st&quot; does not give a good rhyme, unless one takes the
rhyme as confined to the &quot;-'st&quot; ending. Agreed further that a rhyme
usually goes back at least to the syllable preceding a word ending,
although not always. Not knowing the poet's intent in regard to form
here, I do not know how closely he wrote to the pattern. Obviously he
generally followed the pattern well. Perhaps he followed the pattern
well throughout, perhaps not.

I disagree that &quot;show'st&quot; makes _perfect_ sense, although it can be
read to make good sense. I gladly try it--

3. Who hast by wayning [becoming less of a boy] growne, and therein
showest [clearly reveal or illustrate],
4. Thy lover's withering, as thy sweet selfe growest.

The new growth / old growth metaphor continues to work for line 4.
&quot;Showest&quot; certainly goes along with the poet comparing himself to the
boy: the boy's growth toward his prime clearly illustrates to the poet
his own aging beyond his prime.

I find no major objection to &quot;show'st.&quot; It'll work.

&quot;Shov'st&quot; however, invokes the force of nature. There is a natural
&quot;push&quot; from one generation to the next. Be that as it may.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ... one plant does not shove others withering, and the poem is about
&gt; appearances, not the taking over of territory.

"/>

The poem is not merely about appearances. For one thing, the effects
of time are real - growth, withering - and are stated as such. The
poem speaks of reality, loud and clear. The poem is about the reality
behind the appearance, and it is couched in terms of educating a naive
recipient to the facts of life. &quot;Dear Boy, this is thy fate&quot; the poem
says.

I do observe, you did not say the poem was _only_ about appearances.
My remarks here are probably not an argument with you.

New generations do take over the territory of the old. And if -
musing here - this series of poems to the boy were an attempt to
persuade the boy to marry the poet's daughter, the inheritance of
territory would be manifest. Again, be that as it may.

Plants are unquestionably very competitive, and one will shove another
powerfully, as any gardener has seen. The &quot;shoving&quot; of plants will
break concrete. This &quot;shoving&quot; is one reason weeds are a problem in a
garden, also why gardeners thin seedlings. Weeds will not only shade
desired plants, but crowd (shove) them, deprive them of water and
nourishment so they wither, and even kill them, all quite naturally.

More to the point, &quot;sweet self&quot; indicates fruit; many vegetables are
sweet, but the term is more often applied to fruit. For fruit on an
everbearing plant, such as some strawberries, the phenomenon can be
observed directly, of new fruit growing and pushing aside older,
withering fruit in the same cluster.

But the botanical metaphor I invoke could be confined to line 4 with
no difficulty. It's easy to read too much into a poem, as you are
undoubtedly aware.

Do you find &quot;sickle hour&quot; acceptable? I ask because &quot;hover&quot; and
&quot;shov'st&quot; would match in the letter -v-, although admittedly disrupt
the strict rhyme pattern.

I'll try it, myself--

1. O thou my lovely Boy who in thy power,
[To you, my lovely Boy, who have the power]

2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hower;
[To restrain Time's hourglass (which is fickle in favoring first one,
then another), and likewise restrain Time's sickle, delaying the hour
when it descends.]

&quot;Hour&quot; will work. I could accept it. I don't particularly like it,
but that's beside the point. The verse is so abbreviated it allows
the reader a lot, or demands a lot.

The passage of time, represented by Time's glass, is fickle, in that
where earlier it had favored the poet, as he grew into his prime, the
passing of time now disfavors the poet and favors the boy instead. As
I read it.

&gt;&gt; It's not surprising that &quot;shou&quot;, as a complete word, doesn't appear

&gt; That is not what I said. The verb 'shove' occurs
&gt; four times in the canon (and 'shovel' appears
&gt; another four times).

&gt;&gt; Even a hurried or careless compositor would hesitate at such an
&gt;&gt; unEnglish-looking word.

&gt; Agreed. And he could hardly miss the rhyme
&gt; -- from the final word of the next line.

You're assuming that he was thinking and back-checking, rather than
mechanically reaching for the next lump of lead in the box. I do wonder
whether there was any effective system of proof-reading, considering what
nonsense was sometimes left in place (&quot;a table of green fields&quot;) which
would - one hopes - be questioned by a modern proof-reader.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; One can rather easily accept that, not reading the
&gt;&gt; sense but glancing at the copy, he would see &quot;sho--&quot; and imagine
&gt;&gt; perhaps &quot;should'st&quot; was coming up.

&gt; If he had thought that, then he'd have put in
&gt;&quot;should'st&quot;. But that makes no sense. Nor

No - he stopped himself just in time but still didn't get it right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Similarly, we have to assume an amazing degree
&gt; of negligence by all those who proof-read the
&gt; poem. Nothing is easier to check, in a poem
&gt; made up of six couplets, than the rhyming.
&gt; A clear mistake in one couplet stands right out.
&gt; The presumption has to be that &quot;shou'st&quot; is

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; ... My observation is that the poem consists of heroic couplets and
&gt;&gt;&quot;show'st,&quot; besides making perfect sense, rhymes with &quot;grow'st,&quot; while &quot;shov'st&quot;
&gt;&gt; does not rhyme with &quot;grow'st&quot;

&gt;Agreed that &quot;shov'st&quot; does not give a good rhyme, unless one takes the
&gt;rhyme as confined to the &quot;-'st&quot; ending. Agreed further that a rhyme
&gt;usually goes back at least to the syllable preceding a word ending,
&gt;although not always. Not knowing the poet's intent in regard to form
&gt;here, I do not know how closely he wrote to the pattern.

"/>

I don't think he ever used consonance in place of rhyme.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Obviously he
&gt;generally followed the pattern well. Perhaps he followed the pattern
&gt;well throughout, perhaps not.

&gt;I disagree that &quot;show'st&quot; makes _perfect_ sense, although it can be
&gt;read to make good sense. I gladly try it--

&gt;3. Who hast by wayning [becoming less of a boy] growne, and therein
&gt;showest [clearly reveal or illustrate],
&gt;4. Thy lover's withering, as thy sweet selfe growest.

&gt;The new growth / old growth metaphor continues to work for line 4.
&gt;&quot;Showest&quot; certainly goes along with the poet comparing himself to the
&gt;boy: the boy's growth toward his prime clearly illustrates to the poet
&gt;his own aging beyond his prime.

&gt;I find no major objection to &quot;show'st.&quot; It'll work.

&gt;&quot;Shov'st&quot; however, invokes the force of nature. There is a natural
&gt;&quot;push&quot; from one generation to the next. Be that as it may.

&gt;&gt; ... one plant does not shove others withering, and the poem is about
&gt;&gt; appearances, not the taking over of territory.

&gt;The poem is not merely about appearances. For one thing, the effects
&gt;of time are real - growth, withering - and are stated as such.

"/>

For me, the growth, withering, are of the lovely boy's appearance (primarily)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The
&gt;poem speaks of reality, loud and clear. The poem is about the reality
&gt;behind the appearance, and it is couched in terms of educating a naive
&gt;recipient to the facts of life. &quot;Dear Boy, this is thy fate&quot; the poem
&gt;says.

"/>

Well, appearance IS reality.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I do observe, you did not say the poem was _only_ about appearances.
&gt;My remarks here are probably not an argument with you.

"/>

No, I'd just say that the empasis is more on appearance than you do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;New generations do take over the territory of the old. And if -
&gt;musing here - this series of poems to the boy were an attempt to
&gt;persuade the boy to marry the poet's daughter, the inheritance of
&gt;territory would be manifest. Again, be that as it may.

&gt;Plants are unquestionably very competitive, and one will shove another
&gt;powerfully, as any gardener has seen. The &quot;shoving&quot; of plants will
&gt;break concrete. This &quot;shoving&quot; is one reason weeds are a problem in a
&gt;garden, also why gardeners thin seedlings. Weeds will not only shade
&gt;desired plants, but crowd (shove) them, deprive them of water and
&gt;nourishment so they wither, and even kill them, all quite naturally.

&gt;More to the point, &quot;sweet self&quot; indicates fruit; many vegetables are
&gt;sweet, but the term is more often applied to fruit.

"/>

I think &quot;sweet&quot; is too often used in poetry for &quot;nice&quot; to work for what it
specifically, literally means.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;For fruit on an
&gt;everbearing plant, such as some strawberries, the phenomenon can be
&gt;observed directly, of new fruit growing and pushing aside older,
&gt;withering fruit in the same cluster.

&gt;But the botanical metaphor I invoke could be confined to line 4 with
&gt;no difficulty. It's easy to read too much into a poem, as you are
&gt;undoubtedly aware.

&gt;Do you find &quot;sickle hour&quot; acceptable? I ask because &quot;hover&quot; and
&gt;&quot;shov'st&quot; would match in the letter -v-, although admittedly disrupt
&gt;the strict rhyme pattern.

"/>

Actually, there is a full rhyme there--huv with shuv--but it's not a end rhyme,
and if accepted, would kill two heroic couplets--i.e., would leave lines 1 and 4
unrhymed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I'll try it, myself--

&gt;[To restrain Time's hourglass (which is fickle in favoring first one,
&gt;then another), and likewise restrain Time's sickle, delaying the hour

&gt;&quot;Hour&quot; will work. I could accept it. I don't particularly like it,
&gt;but that's beside the point. The verse is so abbreviated it allows
&gt;the reader a lot, or demands a lot.

"/>

I don't like it, either, but it's the only interpretation that makes sense. I
believe Shakespeare was forced to use &quot;hower&quot; because of his need to rhyme.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I read it tomean the glass now favors the boy but, being fickle, will stop

But &quot;hover&quot; doesn't work, because it's ungrammatical and it
doesn't rhyme nearly as well with &quot;power&quot;.

O thou my lovely boy, who in thy power
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle hour:

The lovely boy can &quot;hold&quot;&quot;Time's fickle glass&quot; and &quot;hold&quot;
&quot;his sickle hour&quot;, where &quot;sickle&quot; is used as an adjective,
but he can't &quot;hold&quot;&quot;his sickle hover&quot;. He could hold
&quot;his hovering sickle&quot;.

Here are Shakespeare's other rhymes in the sonnets using
words with an &quot;-er&quot; ending. You can see that he never rhymes
only the &quot;-er&quot; part alone, always at least one other sound
from the words is rhymed as well:

o'er/before
cover/lover
her/her
other/smother
power/flower
flatter/matter
character/register
power/bower
longer/stronger
cover/lover
dearer/clearer
never/fever

In addition, &quot;hour&quot; is also rhymed with another &quot;-ower&quot; word:
hour/sour

Not only this, but more specifically &quot;power&quot; is rhymed with
&quot;hour&quot; in other works by Shakespeare:

'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold
The injury of many a blasting hour,
Let it not tell your judgement I am old:
Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power. (A Lover's Complaint 71-74)

But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer,
Having solicited th' eternal power
That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,
And they would stand auspicious to the hour,
Even there he starts; quoth he 'I must deflower: (Lucrece, 344-48)

Which my lord paid for be of any power
To expel sickness, but prolong his hour! (Timon, 3.1.62-63)

If you change &quot;show'st&quot; to &quot;shov'st&quot;, not only does this
bring in a word never used by Shakespeare elsewhere,
(the closest is &quot;shove&quot; in Hamlet 3.3.58, which is the F1
version, where Q2-4 have &quot;showe&quot;), but it also does not
work grammatically. How can the boy &quot;shove&quot; his &quot;lovers
withering&quot;? You would have to reverse the word order,
to &quot;thy withering lovers&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>

O thou my lovely boy, who in thy power
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle hour.
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,

In your version:

O thou my lovely boy, who in thy power
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hover.
Who has by waning grown, and therein shov'st
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grows't.

Not only does this sound worse, it's impossible
to understand using the normal rules of grammar.
Since the original *does* make perfect sense
without emendation, your version is not acceptable.

The standard rhyme shown here is &quot;hour / power&quot;.
&quot;Hower / power&quot; is likely to be an improvement

Ah, but here, we could have a very healthy knock-down argument.

The poem itself says otherwise. The poem first speaks of the boy's
power to restrain the sands of time, but goes on to explain that
power, of the boy, is only an appearance, and the reality is in the
purpose of Nature. The poem warns the boy that the appearance is NOT
the reality, they are two different things.

The appearance, line 1: &quot;who in thy power.&quot; Thy power = the boy's
power. The boy has power to restrain the passage of time.
Apparently.

However, the reality, lines 5 and 6: &quot;Nature ... will plucke thee
back.&quot; Nature pulls back, restrains, the boy.

The appearance is that time is in the boy's hands, but the reality is
that the boy is in nature's hands.

The poet disagrees with you about appearance and reality, and I side
with the poet.

There are other readings, of course. The first two lines can be taken
as a description of the boy's power over him, the poet, as the poet
experiences it. As the poet's thoughts turn to the boy, time is
suspended, for him. The poet mentions that pleasant effect, which he
experiences, as a compliment to the boy. Perhaps.

The fickleness of the glass covers both things described above. The

Uh, yeah. There are limits to the interpretations suggested by Mr.

of the image of the sickle being suspended in air, and then Mr.
Crowley's &quot;shov'st&quot; with the -v- followed from that, as something I
took a look at.

I will add that I approached &quot;shov'st&quot; with some anxiety. The way Mr.
Crowley has been going, I was a little apprehensive that he might
somehow end up with Raleigh telling the Queen to &quot;shove it.&quot;

Immortalized in poetry by Shakespeare.

So you can understand my concern. I would want the greatest possible
distance between myself and any such interpretation. Thus I gladly
cast &quot;shov'st&quot; aside, and firmly dissociate myself from any further
use, or misuse, of it that might be made.

&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretation was.

&gt;&gt;My _principal_ interpretation here is to take 'lovers'
&gt;&gt;as an ironic reference to Ralegh's fellow courtiers,
&gt;&gt;who all hated him -- for his low origins, his rapid
&gt;&gt;rise and, above all, for his withering comments.

&gt; Sure. If a word doesn't say what you want it to, use its opposite. In any
&gt; case, you haven't answered my argument, which was that if the glass is false,
&gt; why is it correctly showing anyone withering?

I answered it a bit further on, if you could have

&gt;&gt;4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.

&gt;&gt;That fits in with 'shovest' -- where, in effect, we
&gt;&gt;read a semi-colon at the end of line 3.

&gt; You don't let others change punctuation. Even sneakily, as you do here.

"/>

The semi-colon was rare in Elizabethan printing.
There IS a comma in that place (routinely removed
by Strat editors); that indicates a pause. It should
not be removed -- because that changes the
entire meaning of the sentence.

An editorial replacement of a comma by a semi-
colon is often done, and is usually justified. I don't
think that it would be entirely unreasonable here --
but I certainly would not do it, as it would almost
certainly obstruct a meaning that the poet wanted
us to take. However, it is perfectly reasonable IN
DISCUSSION to say 'in this particular sense, think
of it as a semi-colon'.

You are exceedingly thick at times.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;In any event, the word is 'fickle' so the mirror
&gt;&gt;can be false in one light and true in another.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you really saying that there was an actual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'boy' -- a fair youth, who was holding an hour-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;glass at this point? So, the poet could readily
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have substituted his name?

&gt;&gt;&gt;The boy held the hourglass in his power. You have the boy, Raleigh, using it to
&gt;&gt;&gt; show something.

&gt;&gt;Not really. I say that there is a superficial theme
&gt;&gt;addressed to a Cupid-like figure of Time -- which
&gt;&gt;is ALSO Ralegh -- in a joking and derogatory
&gt;&gt;sense.

&gt; Paul, you've lost me, and I'm getting tired of this argument. So I'm not going
&gt; to try to figure out what you mean.

"/>

Hey, just as it's getting interesting -- and we are
getting somewhere! If you are going to do literary
research -- of any kind -- you need stamina.
That's probably unknown in the Stratfordian world.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It sounds as ok as O thou my lovely Walt who in thy power. I don't know what
&gt;&gt;&gt; your point is.

&gt;&gt;Yes, you do. And you don't like it.

&gt; Oh, right, I'm a liar. &quot;boy&quot; is a description placed in a sentence where any
&gt; name whatever would be out of place. If I say, &quot;My opponent in this debate is
&gt; an idiot,&quot; would you ask me if I would say, &quot;My Paul in the debate is an idiot?&quot;
&gt; to try to make some loony point?

"/>

You have switched to the third person form of
speech. If you stayed with the second -- as the
poet does -- then there should be no problem.
&quot;O Paul, my foolish opponent&quot; is no different in
_form_ from &quot;O Idiot, my foolish opponent&quot;.
'Boy' in the sonnet is NOT really a description;
it is more a form of address . . a kind of name
. . as 'Idiot' or 'Paul' are in my example. So you
can address a waiter as &quot;Garcon . .&quot; or
&quot;Boy . . &quot; or &quot;John . . &quot; or &quot;Bud . . &quot; or whatever
you think appropriate. You SHOULD be able
to use a personal name in that context . . when
you are addressing someone.

Yet you know perfectly well that a name would
be right out of place in this sonnet:

1. O thou my lovely Bob who in thy power,
2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hower;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;But Strats can't say anything like that. You say
&gt;&gt;the poem is a dead straight one, with no edge

It is agreed by the Strat commentators.

This is Booth:
&quot;1. lovely (1) loveable; (2) beautiful (as in 54.13 and 95.1). lovely boy
Compare sweet boy in 108.5. (The conjunction of 'lovely', 'boy', and
'pow'r' can make the poem at first seem to be in the tradition of lovers'
apostrophes to Cupid; 'my' suggests an alternative possibility, that the
poem is addressed to the beloved: that possibility quickly becomes
the only one as the poem progresses and is more and more evidently
addressed to a mortal.)

This is Blakemore-Evans:
1 lovely boy (1) beautiful, (2) lovable, (3) loving boy or youth. Compare
'lovely youth' (54.13). Benson omits the poem, perhaps because of this
phrase; see 108.5 n. Wrong-headed, if well-intentioned, attempts have
been made to identify 'thou, my lovely boy' as Cupid, the little god of Love,
an identification which, though it could conceivably fit with lines 1-4
obviously cannot be applied to the same 'thou', who, in lines 5-12, is
declared to be subject to Times 'sickle': Cupid, as a god, was immune
to Time.

This is Katherine Duncan-Jones
1. my lovely Boy Though some commentators have identified the lovely
Boy with Cupid, the context makes it clear that the addressee is the
speaker's beloved, and a mortal, not a deity.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;but it is ALSO about the gods of Time and Nature.
&gt;&gt;You implicitly admit that, yet you can present no
&gt;&gt;way in which the two levels of meaning can be
&gt;&gt;linked. So you are stumped. You have to resort
&gt;&gt;to abuse about 'dealing with cranks'.

&gt; The two meanings, if there, are linked by the poem's being about the boy, the
&gt; real boy, addressed, who is sixty-years-old but looks 22.

When you've lost an argument you invariably
degenerate into a kind of baby-talk. It's a 100%
reliable give-away.

&gt; Okay, I'm done with non-sonnet #1. I've spent a lot of time with it, and even

Bad interpretations (and arguments) get weaker
under close examination. More and more faults
become exposed. You can see your position is
falling, so you are taking to the hills. The final
straw for you is the realisation of the nonsense
of addressing the 'Boy' as a god and not -- at
the same time.

Good interpretations (and arguments) get stronger
under pressure. I feel that we are just about starting
to make real progress. It is only in the course of this
discussion that I saw &quot;shov'st&quot; and the Stratfordian
removal of the comma after it. I've just seen the
exclamation mark after 'treasure' in line 10,
commonly removed by editors, and not discussed
by any. I had not realised the likelihood of Heriot's
'perspective glass' having a relevance -- as I am
now almost certain that it does.

He doesn't you clown. There is a comma after

shoved his way into the court.

The 'lovers withering' belongs to a new topic --
an observation by the poet that other courtiers

with the Queen.

He doesn't use &quot;shov'st&quot; anywhere. On the other hand,
he does use &quot;showest&quot; and &quot;show'st&quot; in King Lear,
R2 and Coriolanus. It is also rare for Shakespeare to use
any word other than &quot;lov'st&quot; which has the &quot;-ov'st&quot; or &quot;-ovest&quot;
ending. The exceptions are &quot;mov'st&quot;, &quot;disprov'st&quot; and
&quot;clovest&quot;.

He also doesn't rhyme any &quot;-ow'st&quot; words with any &quot;-ov'st&quot;
words. For example, in sonnet 11 he rhymes &quot;grow'st&quot;
with &quot;bestow'st&quot;:

As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,
In one of thine, from that which thou departest,
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,

and in 18 &quot;grow'st&quot; with &quot;ow'st&quot;:

Sorry, Paul, I feel I've made my case. I don't feel the sonnets are important
enough for me to spend any more time on, either as literature or as authorship
data. But do tell me whether you'll continue to claim no one will debate your
interpretation of this sonnet.

--Bob G.

In article &lt;sg5Ga.18099$pK2.25 ... @news.indigo.ie&gt;, &quot;Paul says...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&quot;Bob Grumman&quot;&lt;Bob_mem ... @newsguy.com&gt; wrote in message
&gt;news:bc7h8s0kum@drn.newsguy.com ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't notice this before but &quot;false&quot; can't be right since the mirror is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; showing the lovers withering, which they ideed were, and the queen, in your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretation was.

&gt;&gt;&gt;My _principal_ interpretation here is to take 'lovers'
&gt;&gt;&gt;as an ironic reference to Ralegh's fellow courtiers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;who all hated him -- for his low origins, his rapid
&gt;&gt;&gt;rise and, above all, for his withering comments.

&gt;&gt; Sure. If a word doesn't say what you want it to, use its opposite. In any
&gt;&gt; case, you haven't answered my argument, which was that if the glass is false,
&gt;&gt; why is it correctly showing anyone withering?

&gt;I answered it a bit further on, if you could have
&gt;been a little more patient.

&gt;&gt;&gt;1. O thou my lovely Boy who in thy power,
&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hower;
&gt;&gt;&gt;3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein shov'st,
&gt;&gt;&gt;4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That fits in with 'shovest' -- where, in effect, we
&gt;&gt;&gt;read a semi-colon at the end of line 3.

&gt;&gt; You don't let others change punctuation. Even sneakily, as you do here.

&gt;The semi-colon was rare in Elizabethan printing.
&gt;There IS a comma in that place (routinely removed
&gt;by Strat editors); that indicates a pause. It should
&gt;not be removed -- because that changes the
&gt;entire meaning of the sentence.

&gt;An editorial replacement of a comma by a semi-
&gt;colon is often done, and is usually justified. I don't
&gt;think that it would be entirely unreasonable here --
&gt;but I certainly would not do it, as it would almost
&gt;certainly obstruct a meaning that the poet wanted
&gt;us to take. However, it is perfectly reasonable IN
&gt;DISCUSSION to say 'in this particular sense, think
&gt;of it as a semi-colon'.

&gt;You are exceedingly thick at times.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In any event, the word is 'fickle' so the mirror
&gt;&gt;&gt;can be false in one light and true in another.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you really saying that there was an actual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'boy' -- a fair youth, who was holding an hour-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;glass at this point? So, the poet could readily
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have substituted his name?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The boy held the hourglass in his power. You have the boy, Raleigh, using it
&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show something.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Not really. I say that there is a superficial theme
&gt;&gt;&gt;addressed to a Cupid-like figure of Time -- which
&gt;&gt;&gt;is ALSO Ralegh -- in a joking and derogatory
&gt;&gt;&gt;sense.

&gt;&gt;Paul, you've lost me, and I'm getting tired of this argument. So I'm not going
&gt;&gt; to try to figure out what you mean.

&gt;Hey, just as it's getting interesting -- and we are
&gt;getting somewhere! If you are going to do literary
&gt;research -- of any kind -- you need stamina.
&gt;That's probably unknown in the Stratfordian world.
&gt;The concept of research certainly is, at any rate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. O thou my lovely Tom who in thy power,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hower;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Does that sound ok to you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It sounds as ok as O thou my lovely Walt who in thy power. I don't know what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your point is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, you do. And you don't like it.

&gt;&gt; Oh, right, I'm a liar. &quot;boy&quot; is a description placed in a sentence where any
&gt;&gt;name whatever would be out of place. If I say, &quot;My opponent in this debate is
&gt;&gt;an idiot,&quot; would you ask me if I would say, &quot;My Paul in the debate is an idiot?&quot;
&gt;&gt; to try to make some loony point?

&gt;You have switched to the third person form of
&gt;speech. If you stayed with the second -- as the
&gt;poet does -- then there should be no problem.
&gt;&quot;O Paul, my foolish opponent&quot; is no different in
&gt;_form_ from &quot;O Idiot, my foolish opponent&quot;.
&gt;'Boy' in the sonnet is NOT really a description;
&gt;it is more a form of address . . a kind of name
&gt;. . as 'Idiot' or 'Paul' are in my example. So you
&gt;can address a waiter as &quot;Garcon . .&quot; or
&gt;&quot;Boy . . &quot; or &quot;John . . &quot; or &quot;Bud . . &quot; or whatever
&gt;you think appropriate. You SHOULD be able
&gt;to use a personal name in that context . . when
&gt;you are addressing someone.

&gt;Yet you know perfectly well that a name would
&gt;be right out of place in this sonnet:

&gt;1. O thou my lovely Bob who in thy power,
&gt;2. Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hower;

&gt;&gt;&gt;But Strats can't say anything like that. You say
&gt;&gt;&gt;the poem is a dead straight one, with no edge
&gt;&gt;&gt;of irony or humour. For you the poem must
&gt;&gt;&gt;EITHER be about the 'gods' OR be about a real
&gt;&gt;&gt;person.

&gt;&gt;wrongwrongwrongwrong. Many poems have two or more &quot;narratives&quot; going on. I am
&gt;&gt; saying THIS one does not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In parts it is clearly about a real person,

&gt;&gt; What evidence is there for this?

&gt;It is agreed by the Strat commentators.

&gt;This is Booth:
&gt;&quot;1. lovely (1) loveable; (2) beautiful (as in 54.13 and 95.1). lovely boy
&gt;Compare sweet boy in 108.5. (The conjunction of 'lovely', 'boy', and
&gt;'pow'r' can make the poem at first seem to be in the tradition of lovers'
&gt;apostrophes to Cupid; 'my' suggests an alternative possibility, that the
&gt;poem is addressed to the beloved: that possibility quickly becomes
&gt;the only one as the poem progresses and is more and more evidently
&gt;addressed to a mortal.)

&gt;This is Blakemore-Evans:
&gt;1 lovely boy (1) beautiful, (2) lovable, (3) loving boy or youth. Compare
&gt;'lovely youth' (54.13). Benson omits the poem, perhaps because of this
&gt;phrase; see 108.5 n. Wrong-headed, if well-intentioned, attempts have
&gt;been made to identify 'thou, my lovely boy' as Cupid, the little god of Love,
&gt;an identification which, though it could conceivably fit with lines 1-4
&gt;obviously cannot be applied to the same 'thou', who, in lines 5-12, is
&gt;declared to be subject to Times 'sickle': Cupid, as a god, was immune
&gt;to Time.

&gt;This is Katherine Duncan-Jones
&gt;1. my lovely Boy Though some commentators have identified the lovely
&gt;Boy with Cupid, the context makes it clear that the addressee is the
&gt;speaker's beloved, and a mortal, not a deity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;but it is ALSO about the gods of Time and Nature.
&gt;&gt;&gt;You implicitly admit that, yet you can present no
&gt;&gt;&gt;way in which the two levels of meaning can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;linked. So you are stumped. You have to resort
&gt;&gt;&gt;to abuse about 'dealing with cranks'.

&gt;&gt; The two meanings, if there, are linked by the poem's being about the boy, the
&gt;&gt; real boy, addressed, who is sixty-years-old but looks 22.

&gt;When you've lost an argument you invariably
&gt;degenerate into a kind of baby-talk. It's a 100%
&gt;reliable give-away.

&gt;&gt;Okay, I'm done with non-sonnet #1. I've spent a lot of time with it, and even
&gt;&gt; gotten you to correct yourself more than twice. Nonetheless, I'm sure you'll
&gt;&gt; claim that no one has challenged your reading--or even tried to.

&gt;Bad interpretations (and arguments) get weaker
&gt;under close examination. More and more faults
&gt;become exposed. You can see your position is
&gt;falling, so you are taking to the hills. The final
&gt;straw for you is the realisation of the nonsense
&gt;of addressing the 'Boy' as a god and not -- at
&gt;the same time.

&gt;Good interpretations (and arguments) get stronger
&gt;under pressure. I feel that we are just about starting
&gt;to make real progress. It is only in the course of this
&gt;discussion that I saw &quot;shov'st&quot; and the Stratfordian
&gt;removal of the comma after it. I've just seen the
&gt;exclamation mark after 'treasure' in line 10,
&gt;commonly removed by editors, and not discussed
&gt;by any. I had not realised the likelihood of Heriot's

First I will say that in regard to &quot;shov'st&quot; the rhyme difficulty
appears insurmountable, to me. The poem is nicely rhymed throughout.
While the poem can be read so that &quot;shov'st&quot; has meaning, the same is
true for &quot;show'st,&quot; and &quot;show'st&quot; rhymes.

Then, I do not see that the use of a proper name is any disaster. It
is not manifest to me.

Now, I will grant you, the use of a proper name breaks down in the 3rd
line. Wayning = waning = becoming less.

Becoming less of a Jim does not make much sense, unless it might be
stretched to mean the fellow is becoming more of a &quot;James,&quot; perhaps.

But becoming less of a boy, i.e. more of a man, makes, as they say,
&quot;perfect&quot; sense, especially where the boy's growth is being emphasized
by repetition.

Where do you see the problem with the substitution of a proper name?

By the way, I have also been forced to give up on &quot;whore.&quot; And it's a
shame, she was a lusty wench. But I realized that if the second
&quot;fickle&quot; is correct, and not &quot;sickle,&quot; then the repetition serves as a
simple connective. &quot;His fickle glass, his fickle hour,&quot; means his
fickle hourglass. The repeated adjective connects the two parts of
the compound noun. It's the phrase &quot;fickle hourglass&quot; stretched to
fit the meter.

They languages are closely related. If we

If it were nonsense, then there would be no
problem. But here we have something that
works grammatically -- especially with the final
comma. 'Showest' does not work grammatically
with the final comma. What is the chance of
having TWO distinct random typos producing a
grammatical sentence? About 10,000 to one?

How can you (and other Strats) justify an editorial
'improvement' against such odds? It is also in
flagrant breach of the 'difficilior lectio' rule.

He links the ' . . . . est' here to the crude, manual,

'Shovest' is a monstrosity -- deliberately attached

I don't dispute that the rhyme here is probably
'forced' (although less than it sounds to our ears)
-- and we are ALSO meant to read 'showest'. The
forcing of the rhyme emphasises the crudeness
of the 'shoving' and the crudity (in the poet's view)
of everything about that knave, including his verse.

What you 'paraphrase' might be acceptable (for
sense) but that's not what the poet says. He is
(according to Strats) talking about an ordinary
person (a 'Jim') who is holding metaphysical objects
-- not real ones. It's a nonsense. You will find no
other poet and no other poem mixing images in this
manner. A physical person cannot physically hold
a metaphysical object.

Try starting a letter or a poem to someone you
know personally, picturing them holding something
like 'the Sword of Destiny'. It's nuts.

This is one reason few bother arguing with you--you just deny even that you've
been argued with. It's ridiculous. I presented several arguments for my
interpretation and against yours. One is that yours assumes that the poet
ignored his rhyme scheme. You can assert that sense in this case was more
important than rhyme but you CAN'T reasonably claim that I have not made an
argument. Another I didn't make but thought of a few times, then forgot, is why
the poet is suddenly addressing a poem to Raleigh. Or do you think he did
before.

I, by the way, would never claim you didn't present arguments for your case. I
don't think much of them, but you have made them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the same is

&quot;Show'st&quot; is not there. It is bad policy to put in
what you think are 'improvements' -- just because
you prefer them. The rhyming in Elizabethan times
may well have been much closer. IMO &quot;shou'st&quot;
was entirely deliberate, with the poet realising that
&quot;show'st&quot; was a better rhyme (and expecting it to
be read -- to some extent) but preferring &quot;shou'st&quot;
just because it was a bad rhyme. His view of the
rival poet was that he was a very bad one, who
shoved in bad rhymes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then, I do not see that the use of a proper name is any disaster. It

You are not thinking. Imagine writing to someone
you know personally, say, your girlfriend: &quot;O thou,
my lovely Jill, who hold's Cupid's bow . . . &quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now, I will grant you, the use of a proper name breaks down in the 3rd
&gt; line. Wayning = waning = becoming less.

&gt; Becoming less of a Jim does not make much sense, unless it might be
&gt; stretched to mean the fellow is becoming more of a &quot;James,&quot; perhaps.

&gt; But becoming less of a boy, i.e. more of a man, makes, as they say,
&gt;&quot;perfect&quot; sense, especially where the boy's growth is being emphasized
&gt; by repetition.

&gt; Where do you see the problem with the substitution of a proper name?

&gt; By the way, I have also been forced to give up on &quot;whore.&quot; And it's a
&gt; shame, she was a lusty wench. But I realized that if the second
&gt;&quot;fickle&quot; is correct, and not &quot;sickle,&quot; then the repetition serves as a
&gt; simple connective. &quot;His fickle glass, his fickle hour,&quot; means his
&gt; fickle hourglass. The repeated adjective connects the two parts of
&gt; the compound noun. It's the phrase &quot;fickle hourglass&quot; stretched to
&gt; fit the meter.

"/>

There is a comma after 'sickle'. You have to
respect the source text -- especially when it
makes the reading more complicated and
even more especially when the 'obvious reading'
makes none. What's a 'sickle-hour'? or even
a 'fickle-hour'?

Good point there, Tom. An excessive use of &quot;thou&quot;
and &quot;thy&quot; was indeed indicative of aggression:

SIR TOBY BELCH . . . if thou thou'st him some
thrice, it shall not be amiss . . .

Do a search in the canon (or in any other Elizabethan
text) on &quot;O thou&quot; (42 occurrences in the canon).
The uses are mostly derogatory; occasionally (as
when addressed to God) they are prayerful. Only
once (I think) in the canon is affection indicated.
But when the 'O thou' occurs twice in 12 lines and
precedes over-the-top phrases like &quot; . . my lovely
Boy&quot; and &quot; . . minion of her pleasure&quot; then (unless
we are idiotic purblind Strats) we can have no doubt
as to the presence of sarcasm.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and &quot;goest&quot;

"/>

Anther good point, Tom. 'Goest' was an old-
fashioned usage.for Elizabethans -- almost as much
as it is for us, (occurring only 12 times in the canon.)
Its purpose was to reinforce the comic or derogatory
force of 'thou'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and &quot;treasure&quot;

"/>

Hey, Tom, you are getting into this. To quote from
&quot;Naughty Shakespeare&quot; by Michael Macrone

&quot; Treasure:
&quot;A woman's sexual zone-especially a virgin's-is sometimes poetically
depicted as a hidden box or chest full of sensual riches. The evil Iachimo
plots to make Posthumus believe that he has &quot;pick'd the bock and ta'en!
The treasure of [Imogen's] honour&quot; (Cymbeline, 11.11.41-42). Consider
the &quot;loss your honour may sustain&quot;, Polonius advises his daughter, before
you &quot;lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open&quot; to Hamlet (Hamlet,
I.iii.29-32). In the first case, &quot;honour&quot; means &quot;virginity&quot;; in the second,
&quot;(sexual) reputation&quot; or &quot;market value&quot;. The rudest example is in Titus
Andronicus &quot;There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;!
There serve your lust, shadowed from heaven's eye,! and revel in
Lavinia's treasury (11.1.129-31).&quot;

Typos do not occur because of meaning. They occur for other reasons.

&quot;Time's fickle glass, his fickle, hour&quot; means Time's fickle hourglass.

the listener will not be confused by hearing &quot;ficklehour&quot; run

one of those who wrote the most sonnets at the

were addressed to the person to whom most of
the sonnets of day were addressed -- the Queen.

The reasons for that were (a) she liked having
sonnets written to her (or about her), and

There is a conspicuous one in Sonnet 69, where
the poet expects the reader to see the obvious
rhyme, while he plays upon it for his own 'ends':

Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view,
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:
All toungs (the voice of soules) give thee that end,
Uttering bare truth euen so as foes Commend.

The reasons here are obvious, even if missed by all
the idiot Stratfordian commentators, who put it down
to careless compositors.

Rhyming is a difficult topic because we do not know
how words were pronounced at the time. We can
only guess at 'bad rhymes' -- as in the &quot; . . shov'st /
grow'st &quot; one of this sonnet, where the general opinion
is that it is bad. However, the poet seems to go into
distinctly bad verse when he's having a special go at
Ralegh's versifying. See Sonnet 56, for example, 3rd
quatrain. 'Ocean' was Walter's posy, adopted by him
in his own poetry to the Queen.

9. Let this sad *Intrim* like the Ocean be
10. Which parts the shore,where two contracted new,
11. Come daily to the banks,that when they see
12. Return of love,more blest may be the view.

There are other instances where I am sure the
poet is imitating Ralegh's 'bad verse'. Ralegh
was addicted to staccato-like monosyllabic verse,
and our poet parodies it on occasion.

Btw, I've just realised what 'sad Intrim' (above) means
-- or two meanings of it, at any rate -- it is, of course,
Ralegh, and 'in-trim' is, firstly, a reference to his
nautical background, and secondly, to his extremely
expensive and elaborate dress, coiffure, etc. 'Sad'
means 'pathetic' here. I had been looking at the
historical 'Interims' or treaties of the time -- which
may still have some relevance.

I should have seen all this before. It is essential to
stick to the Quarto spellings, and ignore completely
the crap produced by Stratfordian editors.

There are numerous indications that this poem
is addressed to another person. The tone
throughout is derogatory (very obvious if you can
manage to overcome the 'Shakespeare was never

seen that the addressee is not granted immortality
-- as per usual. Also who is 'Nature' meant to

And what is her 'treasure'? In no other sonnet
addressed to the 'fair youth' is s/he made
dependent upon, or subordinate to, another being
(an impossible condition for all Elizabethans --
except one). In no other sonnets are threats
issued against her / him.

1. O thou my lovely Boy who in thy power,

3. Who hast by waning grown, and therein shov'st,
4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest.

6. As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
7. She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
8. May time disgrace, and wretched mynuit kill.
9. Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,

considering anything whatever that anyone who disagrees with you says an
argument. It would seem that you are not. For some reason, you need to think
no one can offer any real argument against your ideas rather than weakly grant

There are probably other obvious ones I missing.
The source texts have to be examined. We all

&gt;&gt;Btw, I've just realised what 'sad Intrim' (above) means

&gt;&gt;nautical background, and secondly, to his extremely
&gt;&gt;expensive and elaborate dress, coiffure, etc. 'Sad'
&gt;&gt;means 'pathetic' here. I had been looking at the

&gt;&gt;may still have some relevance.

&gt; Paul, you grab any meaning from the text you can find that even remotely fits

Remotely??? 'Intrim' is capitalised and italicised
(both removed by Strat editors, of course) indicating
a name of a person. The term 'sad' is attached to
it. It's compared to 'Ocean'. It parts the 'shore' . .

You think that the poet could not combine such

as sensitive as that of a nursing mother hippo.

do with it -- not helped, course, by the fact that
you don't believe such problems even exist.

&gt;&gt;4. Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest.
&gt;&gt;5. If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)

The sonnet has to work at two main levels --
as addressed to the Cupid-like figure of Time,
and with an underlying sneering thread directed
against Ralegh.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If so, the sarcasm of &quot;lovely boy&quot; conflicts in tone

'Hower' has to work (to some extent, anyway) as
'hour'. It's main burden though is to swear at
Ralegh (as 'whore') in a kind of aside. I see
no real conflict between the sarcasm and a
word of direct abuse. The insult is hidden -- if
only superficially.

If the 'wack' word was sufficiently ambiguous,

What on earth is Crowley talking about now? Sonnet 69 reads

Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view,
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:
All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend.

The Quarto has &quot;end&quot; in place of &quot;due&quot;. The emendation
is made because according to Booth, in Elizabethan
secretary hand, &quot;d&quot; looks like &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; looks like &quot;u&quot;.
The &quot;soil&quot; of the last line is also misprinted as &quot;solye&quot;.

I'm not saying it's there, Bob. What I'm saying is that I can see what
Crowley is getting at. It's garbled and it doesn't make perfect sense, but
it has an impressionistic sexual meaning if you're not that meticulous about
making perfect sense (a good description of Crowley).

And who knows, maybe there was some subliminal sexual meaning in the
author's mind? Of course, the only way to find out would be to ask Crowley.

That is an okay counter-argument, but no better than my rhyme one. I might fo
further and say that just as you say we don't know how words were pronounced
then, we don't know for sure how people punctuated. I've recently decided to
punctuate all adverbs and adverbial phrases at the beginning of sentences, as an
old rule once, I believe, said you should. I think it makes some sentences
clearer, and doesn't hurt ones that don't need it, and that consistency is good.
I'm not sure I'm right, but have gone ahead and followed the rule, anyway. It's
an arbitrary rule, but how do we know similar rules didn't exist for at least
some people, authors or compositors, back then? For instance, a similar rule
could require even adverbs introducing a clause to have commas after them: &quot;Who
hast by waning grown, and therein&quot;--comma because adverb at beginning of clause.
Could be a parenthetical expression, too, with no comma after &quot;and&quot; because an
&quot;and following a comma doesn't have one after it, which seems to be an unwritten
rule now. Or as Willedever suggested (I think), the poet may have wanted a
pause there for whatever reason, and a pause works nicely to emphasize
&quot;therein,&quot; and therefore, the boy's growth by waning.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So present your 'more than scarcely' argument.
&gt;&gt;&gt;(Of course, you have not got one.)

&gt;&gt; I gave you the one against &quot;shou'st&quot; as &quot;shov'st&quot; because &quot;shov'st&quot; does
&gt;not
&gt;&gt; rhyme with &quot;grow'st.&quot; And others. Good lord, now you not only won't
&gt;credit me
&gt;&gt; with giving you real arguments, you won't even give me credit for giving
&gt;you
&gt;&gt; arguments that I say are real arguments.

&gt;&gt; SNIP

&gt;&gt;&gt;The problem here, of course, is that the verse, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;it stands in the Quarto, does make grammatical
&gt;&gt;&gt;sense, with the existing punctuation. Whereas,
&gt;&gt;&gt;the 'correction' doesn't.

&gt;&gt; That is an okay counter-argument, but no better than my rhyme one. I
&gt;might Go
&gt;&gt; further and say that just as you say we don't know how words were
&gt;pronounced
&gt;&gt; then, we don't know for sure how people punctuated.

&gt;Erm, pardon a first-time poster jumping into the middle of this
&gt;disagreement, but wouldn't some vestige of the original punctuation still be
&gt;found in actual writings of the time? (Whereas perhaps their sound-recording
&gt;equipment made use of biodegradable 8-track tapes? ;-)

"/>

Some vestige, sure, but my point is that we wouldn't be aware of all the rules
they might have semi-randomly been following.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That does not seem to be the case. Most scholars have figured out how
&gt;the words
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were pronounced.

&gt;&gt;&gt;They have GUESSED at how the words were
&gt;&gt;&gt;pronounced. Can you imagine an academic
&gt;&gt;&gt;in 400 years time guessing at a Birmingham
&gt;&gt;&gt;(England) or Geordie (Newcastle England) or
&gt;&gt;&gt;Dublin (Ireland) any other local accent?

&gt;&gt; As I understand it, they cross-matched rhymed pairs from many authors. So
&gt;if
&gt;&gt; poet A had &quot;corn&quot; rhymed with &quot;fern&quot; and &quot;corn,&quot; and other authors agreed
&gt;with
&gt;&gt; him, the assumption would be that &quot;fern&quot; was pronounced like &quot;corn.&quot; I
&gt;know
&gt;&gt; little about it but it seems to me that suck kind of logic could determine
&gt;a lot
&gt;&gt; of pronunciation.

&gt;Perhaps, but would it not be merely relative? &quot;fern&quot; and &quot;corn&quot; might have
&gt;indeed been pronounced similarly, but would the sound be more like how we
&gt;say &quot;corn&quot;, how we say &quot;fern&quot;, or perhaps, how we say &quot;barn&quot;?

"/>

Right. But I'm sure there was SOME hard evidence--like some author's having a
character tell another character how to pronounce a word? I wonder when the
first book in English on elocution came out. Also, if one learned that &quot;fern&quot;
was pronounced like &quot;corn&quot; and just about all other &quot;orn&quot; words, but not like
&quot;barn&quot; and all other &quot;arn&quot; words, and that &quot;earn&quot; words like &quot;learn&quot; were
another category with &quot;urn&quot; words, I think one could assume that the members of
each set were pronounced pretty much as they are now since 400 years isn't that
long ago, and you wouldn't expect some kind of wholesale switch from, say, &quot;arn&quot;
words going from the way we pronounce &quot;orn&quot; words now and vice versa. Accents
would continue to be a problem, but are even now.

By the way, I for one don't &quot; _know_ what the poet really meant to say&quot;; I
do know when a reading such as 'end' or 'solye' is meaningless, and when a
purported explication is too far-fetched to credit, and when a simple
emendation is plausible in terms of manuscript and printing process, and
rhymes, and makes unarguable sense.

What in your view is the sense made by &quot;end&quot;? You say it makes &quot;perfect

reasonably adept at disentangling complex verse. Again, please explain.

Very likely 'end' was meant to be 'due', a compositer's mistake (they
drank), look at 'due' upside down, looks like 'end', probably bad
casing and a quick glance. As they say, watch your 'p' and 'q', same
with 'n' and 'u'.

There might well be such evidence, but if we do not have it in front of us,
theorizing that it might exist in support of an argument is not quite the
same thing.

But even in such a case, would we not need some known reference point? Given
a text such as:

&quot;No, no, lad, the correct pronunciation of fern
be such that it sounds more like barn than corn.&quot;

I am hard put to be sure that none of the words listed sounded in the
original like &quot;frond&quot;. In fact, the only thing I would deduce is that, even
back then there were differences of opinion on how things were pronounced
then. Given that fact, what chance have we to know better at this remove?

As an aside, have you ever tried to describe the colour green to someone
without making some reference to things that we generally think of as being
green-coloured?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I wonder when the
&gt; first book in English on elocution came out.

"/>

Would be an interesting read, would it not? But would they have used the
same phonetic techniques we see in print now to describe the sounds of
words? And has that notational system changed as much as common
pronunciation has in the last 50 years? Listen to an old radio broadcast
from the 50's and tell me you can't tell the difference between then and
now.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, if one learned that &quot;fern&quot;

This argument seems somewhat along the lines of believing one thing because
we have difficulty believing the other. Before that line of reasoning can be
taken as valid, I think we will need some corroboration from a different
source.

It might just be that the pronunciation of individual words does not mutate
so much as classes of similar sounding words and syllables do. All the &quot;arn&quot;
words could have mutated to the more stable &quot;ern&quot; sound, for example. Or
possibly not.

&gt;&gt; I wonder when the
&gt;&gt; first book in English on elocution came out.

&gt;Would be an interesting read, would it not? But would they have used the
&gt;same phonetic techniques we see in print now to describe the sounds of
&gt;words? And has that notational system changed as much as common
&gt;pronunciation has in the last 50 years? Listen to an old radio broadcast
&gt;from the 50's and tell me you can't tell the difference between then and
&gt;now.

"/>

The first book on English pronunciation came out in the 1620s,
I believe it was, and though it did not use the same phonetic
symbols we use today, it was surprisingly sophisticated about
articulatory phonetics, and it allows us to reconstruct with
a pretty good degree of confidence the sounds they were talking
about. Fausto Cercignani's *Shakespeare's Works and Elizabethan
Pronunciation* (1981) discusses this book as well as all the
other evidence we have as to how words were pronounced back then.

Proto-West-Germanic was more like 2000 years ago, but it doesn't really
matter, because no West Germanic was written them.

The &quot;W&quot; sound as we know it goes back to the earliest records of Old
English. A special letter was invented for it, wynn (locations 01BF and
01F7 in Unicode), but modern texts of Old English usually substitute
&quot;W&quot;, because wynn looks very much like another Old English added letter,
thorn.

On the other hand, the modern pronunciation of &quot;W&quot; in German (like
English &quot;V&quot;) is quite recent; indeed, there are people still alive who
were born before it was considered standard, and even today some
dialects pronounce &quot;W&quot; as in English.

"/>

There are various general sources on linguistics that go into the sound
laws. Or, for a taste of it, look at any Old English textbook.

Remember that before the invention of printing, people generally spelled
as they spoke, and regularized, fixed spelling in English didn't settle
down until the late 17th-early 18th century. Furthermore, a great many
general trends can be tracked by comparing related languages. In
particular, the evolution of Latin into Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan,
French, Langue d'Oc, Sardinian, Italian, Sicilian, Romansh, Romanian,
etc., has been _very_ thoroughly studied, as has been (but usually from
a more bird's-eye view) the evolution of other languages of the
Indo-European family. (Languages of other families generally don't have
a long written history, or are not written phonetically, or, in the
cases of Hebrew and Arabic, have atypical histories due to religious
considerations.) And, of course, where we have evidence from the period
when a language was first being written, and we know where the alphabet
came from (usually Latin), we can bet that the letters were being used
for the old sound, as much as possible. (Old English had the sounds
&quot;th&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, and &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;cat&quot;, which Latin lacked; special letters were
invented for them, though they were later dropped.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Meaning that they accurately predict what can be measured in the present and
&gt; remembered past. How solid would they be in a time machine scenario?

"/>

Probably pretty solid. The evidence all fits together into an
interlocking frame with thousands of parts supporting each other. There
is always the possibility that modern linguists _could_ be wrong, but it
would be quite surprising if they were _very_ wrong.

It was not the rhyme, as such, that I meant.
It's the words he used: 'be' and 'see' . . .

'baby' words, and IMO a parody on Ralegh's
own versifying habits.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Btw, I've just realised what 'sad Intrim' (above) means
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-- or two meanings of it, at any rate -- it is, of course,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ralegh, and 'in-trim' is, firstly, a reference to his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nautical background, and secondly, to his extremely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;expensive and elaborate dress, coiffure, etc. 'Sad'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;means 'pathetic' here. I had been looking at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;historical 'Interims' or treaties of the time -- which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;may still have some relevance.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Paul, you grab any meaning from the text you can find that even remotely fits
&gt;&gt;&gt; your idee fixe.

&gt;&gt;Remotely??? 'Intrim' is capitalised and italicised
&gt;&gt;(both removed by Strat editors, of course) indicating
&gt;&gt;a name of a person.

&gt; Caps were used for many more kinds of words than persons' names.

"/>

Capitalisation (and italicisation) generally
indicated _something_. You have no idea
what it was -- anymore than any of the idiot
Strat editors who routinely remove it.

Apart from that, my meaning exactly fits the tone
and context -- like a complex key in an unusual lock.
So, of course, you say nothing about that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;The term 'sad' is attached to
&gt;&gt;it. It's compared to 'Ocean'. It parts the 'shore' . .
&gt;&gt; . . . and so on and on.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Here the tone goes against frivolous satirical references--it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is melancholy and lyrical,

This is Booth on this quatrain -- and he does
not see the half of it. But he has no problems
about 'frivolity' fitting in.

&quot; 9-12. These imprecise lines, which are not obviously pertinent
either to what precedes them or to what follows, effect a transition
and connection between two trains of thought that are never
logically related to one another. Although lines 10 and 11 vaguely
suggest the story of Hero and Leander, who were separated by
the Hellespont, the situation metaphorically echoed here seems
to be one in which each lover comes to the shore every day (like
sailors' wives) and stares out to sea in order to catch the first
sight of a ship on which the other may return. As the reader
comes from 'Tomorrow see again', these lines on seeing and the
sea seem designed either to recommend physical lovemaking as
a cure for relationships that have lost 'The spirit of love' (mutual
affection and respect) or to recommend that physically satiated
lovers-those who have lost 'The spirit of love' (see 129.1, note-
on the physical senses of spirit)-test their powers early and often
so as to be immediately aware when desire returns. The couplet,
which-like the language of lines 2 and 4-recalls sonnet 52,
activates another potential for lines 9-12: they are an exemplum
for the proposition that temporary pain and privation enhance
pleasure when at last it comes. (These lines are generally
suggestive sexually: contracted, &quot;betrothed,&quot;&quot;drawn together,&quot;
can specify the nature of the union by means of its potential for
suggesting &quot;vulva&quot;- a potential that Shakespeare was ready to
hear in any word containing con, or cun, or a similar sound
[see 20.12, note, 26.1-14, note, 53.5, 58.3, etc.]; . . . &quot;

Booth seems not to see anything in the least
peculiar about having hundreds of covert
allusions to 'cunts', to female vulva, and all
that sort of thing, in sonnets addressed to a
'Fair Youth'. Weird. What was that you were
saying about not seeing the obvious?

The Stratfordian misreadings come from the
assumption that the author was publishing a
book of verse designed to be sold to a buying
public -- which it must have been expected to
read and understand without much trouble.
So therefore it was in relatively straightforward
English, and said relatively straightforward things.

The 'solye' example is not one for the 'difficilior
lectio' rule since we do not know what the poet
meant. The rule applies when there are two (or
more) possible readings, but one is more
obscure, unusual or peculiar.

In this case, we do not know what 'soyle' means.
We should leave it at that, and not replace it
with an over-simplistic 'soil' -- which does not,
in fact, make a lot of sense in that context.

Sonnet 69

3. All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that end,
4. Uttering bare truth even so as foes Commend.

It is _extremely_ easy to see where authors imply

I'd call the first ones identities, too. Anyway, thanks for the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, to the _vowel_. A rhyme that starts on a consonant is an &quot;impure

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;isn't a rhyme at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you mean by a rhyme that starts on a consonant? I believe in
&gt;&gt;&gt; rhymes that do--rhyme/ride, for instance--but understand that these
&gt;&gt;&gt; are not accepted by others as rhymes.

So is it your personal belief that gives words meaning?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; They aren't rhymes.

&gt; Sorry, but terms can be revised, John--or, in this case, enlarged, to
&gt; cover items not known of when the terms were given their official
&gt; definition. &quot;Poetry,&quot; for instance, took a long time to cover free
&gt; verse--and still doesn't for a lot of people.

Terms aren't &quot;revised,&quot; they evolve. And not at the whim of a single
user.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You can use them in poetry if you like -- there are
&gt;&gt; plenty of ways to organize poetry -- but don't call 'em rhymes, 'cause
&gt;&gt; they ain't. (That is, &quot;correct&quot; poetry is one issue, and correct use of
&gt;&gt; technical terms is another.)

&gt; I try to use terms as others use them, or indicate that my use is
&gt; idiosyncratic.

Idiosyncratic uses of words is not allowed except in private
languages. Of course, I may be misunderstanding your use of the word.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But you mean something else, I

You know, Bob, the English language, while still evolving, has pretty
much been worked out. If communication is your goal, then you might
want to learn the definitions of the words relevant to whatever it is
you want to talk about, whether it be poetry, psychology or literary
history. If words mean whatever you want them to mean, then they have
no meaning at all.
