The opportunity to go to college means a lot for black students'
future economic well-being. But in that ''other world,'' the report
also notes that ''there is a white/black wage gap among educated
individuals that is not explained by differences in degree, major or
age.'' Racism and discrimination are the culprits.

Not much reason to go to it.
Since women, and every other ethnic group, religous group,
journalist associations, and legal and banking group
in the entire world has the same portney's complaint.
And the people who used to make the most money,
family doctors and engineers have gotten so fed
up with hearing about their idiot pharmaceutical
companies, that we sold the moron thing to Botswanna.

Wow. How do you fix this?

&quot;The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop
discriminating on the basis of race,&quot; -- Chief Justice John Roberts

--
The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority but to
escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane. -- Marcus Aurelius

Wherever I go it will be well with me, for it was well with me here, not
on account of the place, but of my judgments which I shall carry away
with me, for no one can deprive me of these; on the contrary, they alone
are my property, and cannot be taken away, and to possess them suffices
me wherever I am or whatever I do. -- EPICTETUS
