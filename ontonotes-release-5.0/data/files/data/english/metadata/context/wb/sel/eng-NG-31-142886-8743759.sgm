So they can strangle the children when they're older in the asinine
pretense that it's an exorcism?

it open a few inches and saw Marquez choking his bloodied [three year
old] granddaughter, who was crying in pain and gasping, Tranter said.
&quot;A bloody, naked 19-year-old woman who police later determined to

Not Catholics, but atheists.  Kill then in the womb or kill them later.  To an
atheist, there is no difference.

Duck &amp; Run, the most monumental coward on Usenet carefully avoids the
topic of the thread once again and makes a jackass of himself as
usual.

In another abortion thread, he outright admitted he's one of the
&quot;...complete and utter dickheads and morons...&quot;:
http://tinyurl.com/yup842

And in both threads, he proves himself a liar.  He repeatedly claims
he wants a discussion, yet in both of these threads, the one URL'd
above and this one, there is room galore to make his case, to support
his case, to actually embark upon a discussion, yet all he does is
make a complete knee-jerk dickhead of himself and run away!

Yet more indisputable proof of what a lying hypocritical coward Duck &amp;
Run truly is.

It's clear from your postings that you have no intention of engaging
in an actual conversation about Catholicism but are only interested in
trying to provoke responses to your posts by making them as insulting

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Right, atheists do a lot of exorcisms.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Duck &amp; Run, the most monumental coward on Usenet carefully avoids
&gt;&gt; &gt; the topic of the thread once again and makes a jackass of himself
&gt;&gt; &gt; as usual.

&gt;&gt; &gt; In another abortion thread, he outright admitted he's one of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;...complete and utter dickheads and morons...&quot;:
&gt;&gt; &gt; http://tinyurl.com/yup842

&gt;&gt; &gt; And in both threads, he proves himself a liar.  He repeatedly
&gt;&gt; &gt; claims he wants a discussion, yet in both of these threads, the one
&gt;&gt; &gt; URL'd above and this one, there is room galore to make his case, to
&gt;&gt; &gt; support his case, to actually embark upon a discussion, yet all he
&gt;&gt; &gt; does is make a complete knee-jerk dickhead of himself and run away!

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yet more indisputable proof of what a lying hypocritical coward
&gt;&gt; &gt; Duck &amp; Run truly is.

&gt;&gt; What you say is all true and no big surprise to ng readers who have
&gt;&gt; read any of puke's insane ravings.

&gt; LoL!  I know him only too well.  But I won't exchange any more

I think puke spends a lot of time down on his knees but it's not for
begging forgiveness.  :o))

Mr. Risdon has point blank lied about having such evidence over many

•  Maybe it's because the aging RC God has lost the power to give
miscarried and aborted souls a second chance for a life on this planet ?
Another possibility is that the one true church needs a plenitudinous

Good move.  She won't discuss with you anyway.  The very moment she is thrown
into a debate mode with you, she'll put you in her kill file so she can hide
from your comments.

If she can't see how you challenged her, she can save face by not answering.  Of
course, we all know she reads our comments as part of those with the chinas to
enter the debate, but she can save face that way by pretending she doesn't know.

A poor example to set for the women of UW.

Yes it does.  The fetus is the human person in the first few months of life.  It
will never become a dog.

Idiot. How convenient, right Puke? If you don't like what someone is
doing, then he/she cannot be catholic...
Do you even know the meaning of the word &quot;hypocrite&quot;?
Since Abraham was about to kill his son Isaac, I guess that makes him
an atheist, right?

À propos &quot;kill them later&quot; how's the war initiated by Christian Bush

&gt; It's clear from your postings that you have no intention of engaging
&gt; in an actual conversation about Catholicism but are only interested in
&gt; trying to provoke responses to your posts by making them as insulting
&gt; and misrepresentative of the Catholic faith as possible.

&gt; For this reason, I'm done with you.

It is an exageration and misleading to say the reason Catholic oppose
abortion is just to kill kids later in exorcisms. You are correct.

So why do they oppose abortion? One could use scriptural references,
but one can find scriptural reference to support or dent obbortion.
Just like all things the book of fable known as the bible is obtuse
enough to justify any sort of behavior.

So why do they oppose abortion? It simple undermines their program to
breed ever other viepiont out of the competition.  It realizes an
impoverished family having lots of children is the best way for its
meme survival.
