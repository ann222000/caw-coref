I want to get a bluetooth mouse for my MacBook Pro ( a real one - not
a crappy mighty mouse ).

I hate it when sometimes a button click isn't registered or there is a
very slight delay.

Maybe I should stick with wired mice?

N E 1 got any tips?

I'm sorry but I don't seem to have that problem with the three
wireless Mighty Mouses (Mice?) running on my BlackBook, Mac Pro and
iMac.  There is no &quot;lag&quot; when a button is clicked.  I do have all
three machines maxed out or loaded with additional RAM along with the
fastest CPUs offered by Apple but not sure that would make the
difference.  Maybe I just have good BlueTooth?

BTW, I don't find the Might Mouse to be crappy at all.  I tried others
but came back to the Mighty Mouse.

Oh I based my assumption of a USB wireless mouse I use on a PC. It
sucks so I assumed that bluetooth would also suck

What I don't like about the mighty-mouse (even though I have never
tried it) is that to right click i have to lift both fingers off the
mouse. At the moment I rest both fingers on the buttons &amp; only apply
enough pressure on one of them.

Also, the PC I use has not got much RAM. I might give it a try. thanx
for the tip dude

Anything on a PC sucks. That's why we use Macs.

You don't have to &quot;lift both fingers off&quot;. You can leave both fingers
on the mouse at all times. Push down on the left side of the mouse and
it's a left-click. Push down on the right side of the mouse and it's a
right-click.

The real annoyance is the &quot;squeeze&quot; click since it's far too easy to do
by accident when simply moving the mouse around.

Batteries low on power will also cause a problem.

low batteries can cause skipping and random shutdowns requiring the
constant pushing of the connect button on the mouse and/or reciever*

*= applies to normal cordless mice and keyboards.

Like not working at all.  I've named mine Greedy because it uses them up
so fast I quit using expendable ones and now make it take turns with the
rechargeables I use in the camera.

Since my last post I have been watching both my new wireless keyboard
(I LOVE it!) and my wireless Mighty Mouse closely for lags or problems
and I can detect none.  When I click on an item it stands to attention
instantly, there is no lag time to speak of.  And the keyboard is
fantastic.  I have a BlackBook and the keyboard is exactly the same.
I've never been one for the far right keypad having learned to type my
numbers from the numbers row.  My only complaint concerning the
keyboard is the on/off guidance provided by the handbook.  To turn it
on you push the side on button and to turn it off you should push the
same button.  But the keyboard doesn't go &quot;off&quot; - you can continue to
type using it and that means, to me, that the off button is not
working.  Either that or there is some kind of trick to it.  I may
have to go away for several days on business and would like to shut it
off - and that would be a nifty little security option because a
stranger couldn't turn it on unless he/she knew how.  But that's
minor.  Everything works so beautifully I can't complain at all.  The
keyboard is small, flat and has a wonderful key touch - even with my Z-
cover to protect it from spills and food.  I'm notorious for eating
lunch at my desk while catching a TV Show or movie - and perusing the
web at the same time or reviewing reports (I have a 30&quot; Cinema Display
and can fill the screen with a great many projects, files, folders,
etc..).  When co-workers or visitors come to the office I can sit on
the sofa and do things from there using the wireless keyboard.  It is
amazing.  So I have nothing but good things to say about the quickness
and reliability of the new wireless keyboard and the fine wireless
Mighty Mouse.  Great products.
