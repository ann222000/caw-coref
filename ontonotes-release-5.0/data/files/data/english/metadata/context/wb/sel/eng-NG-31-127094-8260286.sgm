Me too! But there's always a new DUMB-ASS to come along and continue
the traditions of the old DUMB- ASSES... I wish someone would invent
an anti DUMB-ASS soda from Nutri- DUMB-ASS dietary supliments... I saw
the video of your place. OK... Obviously, you're not dating right now.
I like the 'lived in' look! When someone's house looks anticeptic, I
believe they've been up to no good! Elsewise, they'd be living in a
dump like the rest of us. So Microsoft is walking distance from you.
Wow! Could you please tell them I'd like a T-shirt? And a possible
rebate? How long have they been working for you? Gosh... Someone from
Microsoft! Do they still like me?

I'd have been here more but I've been work like crazy and finally
finished formating all my dingbats for use! Lordie! It took me almost
a week there's so many! Haven't you guys got anything better to do?
LOL! Probably sit around all day and shoot paper clips; is that the
picture? &lt;sigh&gt; Thinks advance so quickly, I anin't never gonna finish
my book! I may just as well sell it as an updating service instead. At
least that would sound half way credible...

You never mentioned if you've been to my blog and got the picture I
made for your desktop? There's other new ones there as well... I'm
always adding new ones... New articles too... Next, I need to pdf some
sample chapters  and get some newer larger stationeries done and up on
my site; giving birth as I speak, so I can start chapter six, make
some more banner and button sets etc. I'm getting upgraded shortly to
CS3 so I've been reading through the 'new sh*t' help files so I'll be
ready for that, take some more picttures... And it's all your fault
too!  If it wasn't for Microsoft, I'd be in bed now, with some little

You, I don't wonder about... Instead I just stare in awe and leave out
the wonder. It's the picture of the cat with the words: 'Meow11D' on
the wall behind him. Scrole down the picture list on the first page on
your right, where all the pictures are (sarcastic remark). Just
teasing you Meow... It's in the: 'Graphics and Illustrations'
Catagory. Use the buttons on the picture thumb nails and choose photos
on the left side to see a wider virgin of it. Sorry 'bout that.
There's some new stuff and new articles there though. Someone called:
'No Name' left a nice comment there. When I clicked on the link, it
lead me to a T.V. commercial. Was that you? (If not, take the credit
anyway and you won't have to say anything there. Please excuse my
ignorance. I didn't take into account that you're just a simple,
Microsoft Employee and probably sick of computers by now. I have a
pertinent question but I'm afraid to ask.

Here goes: Do you know of a program that's a freebee and can save it
into a friendly mp3 format or something any windows media player can
tap too?  It's the only way I can use the formatting at Queeges to
open the files for play over The Internet. I tried to do that with an
XP choice to open it and ended up in mp4 format and a gunky looking
video player. These are just songs... No vedios with them. Does Media
Player reformat mp4s? If you're not sure, blink... &lt;wierd music&gt; BTW,
do you have a web cam? I'm thinking of getting one... I want a newer
model though; better video transmission.

Some other odd-numbered DingBats would be cooler.

3, skip 5, 7, skip 9, 11, 13, etc. pointed DingBats
would be cool enough for me to buy in a few months.

Once I get out from under this tremendous debt thing here.

Fractal-based DingBats would be AWESOME!

Especially 11D rotational Quaternion DingBats!

Oh! The sweet and inoccent type eh? I loved your comment Holly! Thanx!
At this stage, acknowlegements are important to me. If people want to
share things to do with blogs, we have to know what they are and how
to access them don't we? So it was in fact, just the 'right' question:

A 'blog' is a make shift, simple web site ofered for free from:
Windows Live, Google and via Oprah's browser that I know of...  It
simply provides dialog boxes for and instructions to upload material
you make for distribution and freely access it from your drive via
check boxes listed on a per file bases. You can also post there on
topic specific subjects, receive comments, transfer RSS feeds, play
videos, music, list fave. web sites etc. To read articles on a blog,
look to the list on the left side of your screen and double click
blog; or any of the catagories listed in the middle of your screen, on
the main page. To download pictures, look to the pictures displaying
on the right side of your screen. They're listed by catagories as well
via a scrolling box below. You may right click any picture in any
catagory and choose: 'save picture as' from the context menu that
appears (or something comparable if you're not running XP, and the
pictures will download in compressed jpg format, the size I made them:
usually 1024x768 or 1280x960, and you may them download them onto your
machine (from the 'save as' dialog box that appears) for however you
can utilize them.

I ought save this so I don't find I'm repeating myself! Please be sure
and let me know if you experience any further problem so I can trouble
shoot it for my own benifit as well; For me, blogs are a great way to
advertise that a web site is in the making, and offering freebee
samples is one way to get people to start downloading stuff and rely
on checking back for new stuff: 'The human animal must costantly be
fead, to soothe his desire to destroy you...'  Not only this, when
you're ready to bring out your big guns and launch your site, you'll
already have an established clientel so the competition can't blow you
away before you get started! So blogs are a great idea! The rich
protest exclaiming: 'What do the poor have to offer that could be of
possible benifit to anyone?' Well I'm here to along with millions of
others now, to show them: 'The Family Jewels!' of corpse ;O)

I AM SPARTACUS!

Please disregard the 'Hun' part Meow... I started thinking of
Christmas! LOL! I wasn't refering to you, but convincing my self
sexually (according to Freud) cuz I can explain things to women
better... Men on the other hand, are usually credible witnesses! How
much swamp land would you like? LOL! I dunno... Sometimes I get so
involved in what I'm doing, I forget to whom I'm speaking! My life is
confusing, frought with interuptions on a constant basis from the
woman thing that lives here, the other: 'Bald guy' who always goes off
his nut over pretzels or something, liars for friends! Ya know what
Man? I don't think there's a way out of this mess... Why does everyone
around me look so stupid all the time? It's the new &amp;$%!!! pills!
That's what it is! And those &amp;%$! suckers call themselves Doctors:
Just Boneheads with a licence and a phater butt each passing week! I
just feel like giving up again I'm wound up in so much appointment
keeping red tape bullsh*t I can't think or see straight anyway! My
eyes feel like two hot peppers but I gotta press on! Phuckin' Fag Team
Shrinks! Medical cowboys! Bone buddies! I hate the lot of them! And I

&gt;&gt; &gt; Some other odd-numbered DingBats would be cooler.

&gt;&gt; &gt; 3, skip 5, 7, skip 9, 11, 13, etc. pointed DingBats
&gt;&gt; &gt; would be cool enough for me to buy in a few months.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Once I get out from under this tremendous debt thing here.

&gt;&gt; Partial payment keep the wolves at bay and it gives you room to
&gt;&gt; breathe Hun! Only pay what you can afford to at the time...

&gt;&gt; You're refering to an: 'incrimental save' to show progressive steps
&gt;&gt; via layer comps. If you could indicate to me what you'd be using them
&gt;&gt; for, I'd be able to fill your order on a use specific bases... I hate
&gt;&gt; wasting time... You may reach me to discuss this further, when you
&gt;&gt; need to, and download by purchased key folder: a folder on my machine
&gt;&gt; that belongs to you. Then you mail me a cheque or money order or cash
&gt;&gt; between a birthday card: to my P.O. box. When it clears, I place your
&gt;&gt; oder in your folder and activate the key for you to download the goods
&gt;&gt; and that's all there is to it. Please vist me at:

&gt;&gt; &gt; Fractal-based DingBats would be AWESOME!

&gt;&gt; I've made thousands. I just havent presented any samples of those
&gt;&gt; yet... I have to pace myself too...

&gt;&gt; &gt; Especially 11D rotational Quaternion DingBats!

&gt;&gt; I have som giant ones based on asymetric spirals I made in Illustrator
&gt;&gt; and some I've painted in that look very life like, reflected from
&gt;&gt; liquid surfaces etc. Anything you may require... I'm your guy! Don't
&gt;&gt; get another guy... I'm your guy now!  We must bond...

&gt; Please disregard the 'Hun' part Meow... I started thinking of
&gt; Christmas! LOL! I wasn't refering to you, but convincing my self
&gt; sexually (according to Freud) cuz I can explain things to women
&gt; better... Men on the other hand, are usually credible witnesses! How
&gt; much swamp land would you like? LOL! I dunno... Sometimes I get so
&gt; involved in what I'm doing, I forget to whom I'm speaking! My life is
&gt; confusing, frought with interuptions on a constant basis from the
&gt; woman thing that lives here, the other: 'Bald guy' who always goes off
&gt; his nut over pretzels or something, liars for friends! Ya know what
&gt; Man? I don't think there's a way out of this mess... Why does everyone
&gt; around me look so stupid all the time? It's the new &amp;$%!!! pills!
&gt; That's what it is! And those &amp;%$! suckers call themselves Doctors:
&gt; Just Boneheads with a licence and a phater butt each passing week! I
&gt; just feel like giving up again I'm wound up in so much appointment
&gt; keeping red tape bullsh*t I can't think or see straight anyway! My
&gt; eyes feel like two hot peppers but I gotta press on! Phuckin' Fag Team
&gt; Shrinks! Medical cowboys! Bone buddies! I hate the lot of them! And I
&gt; feel like giving up again...
