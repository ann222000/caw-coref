A Single-Player Gamer's Take on Unreal Tournament 3
</HEADLINE>

When Epic was touting UT3 prior to its release, one thing they were
keen to mention was a study they had done on their customers. Said
Epic, something like 60% of all the people who bought the UT games
never went online; they played the game for the single-player aspect
only. Therefore, said Epic, Unreal Tournament 3, would be more
single-player friendly.

I mention all this because -despite these claims- the first thing you
see when you start the game is a log-in screen for multiplayer gaming.
Want to play offline? It's a tiny link at the bottom of the page. If
you start an offline campaign (which takes far more steps than with
most other games), you get a nasty error message telling you that
offline games are missing some features (what features were never
quite clear). And the coup de resistance: as shipped, if you don't
make an online profile, the game will not save your progress through
the offline campaign (this will be fixed in the first patch). *THIS*
is making things more comfortable for offline gamers?

Well, it's not like they totally reamed single-player gamers. They did
add a campaign with a story to Unreal Tournament. Honestly, were there
really a lot of people saying to themselves, &quot;You know, this running
around capping people in the head and stealing flags is neat and all,
but I really wish there was a compelling narrative to all this&quot;. Jeez!
It's a game about a tournament; does the series really need a
structure more complex than &quot;kill everyone and get to the top of the
ladder&quot;?

Apparently Epic thinks so, because they saddled us with a cliche tale
of revenge and corporate warfare. The characters -many of them
blantantly stolen from Gears of War- fall flat, the story has a
predictible non-ending (what is it with designers nowadays that every
every damn game has to end with a cliffhanger? Learn to wrap it up! If
the game's good, I'll buy the sequel even if the previous game ended
neatly), and the explanations for why things like power-ups and
respawns litter the battlefield are so laughable I'd rather they'd not
mentioned them at all.

I'm all for motivation and backstory where appropriate, but -argh-
next time, Epic, keep it out of Unreal Tournament.

Meanwhile, the bot AI -once the crown jewels of the UT series- is no
longer impressive; they can't defend worth a darn, and aren't much
better on the attack. With the original Unreal Tournament, I sometimes
had a hard time telling my AI teammates from real players (except they
weren't calling me &quot;fag&quot; all the time); with UT3, they are
indistinguishable from the brain-dead AIs in other games.

The levels are underwhelming; they either feel to small or too big for
the number of teammates you are given. The gameplay modes aren't
particularly impressive (the new &quot;warfare&quot; mode bores me to tears;
give me back old fashioned &quot;Dominion&quot;; there was a game with some
passion. Or at least bring back old fashioned Assault! And as for the
vehicles; why give me a tank and then make the level nothing but
narrow canyons? I for the most part ignored the vehicles and
hoverboarded across the levels (not that the hoverboard was so great,
since you can't shoot, or grab powerups/flags/weapons while 'boarding,
and can get bounced off the board with the slightest of hits... but it
beat walking).

As to graphics, I can't say I was overwhelmed. I know that deathmatch
games are optimized for gameplay over visuals -you aren't supposed to
have any time to stop and take in the scenery- but after the vivid
realism of Crysis, the Unreal 3 engine looks second-rate. In part it's
because of art direction - there was never any part of the game where
my jaw dropped and I went &quot;wow&quot;- but it's also technical; UT3 relies
far too much on post-processing, which makes everything look too much
like a cartoon. The lack of any real interaction didn't help things
eithe; the maps all felt static and dead.

Arguably, I'm not the real market for these sort of games; the Unreal
Tournament is, after all, primarily a multiplayer game. Quite
possibly, as a multiplayer experience, UT3 is an exceptional game. But
by Epic's own words, UT3 was supposed to be geared as much towards the
single-player gamer -like myself -as the more vocal multiplayer
community. But in my opinion, they failed. UT3 isn't an awful game,
but it's far less satisfying -even to a self-avowed single-player
gamer like myself- than their previous offerings.

It's great how the original UT still holds up so well.  One of the
daughters has a PC that won't play anything better than Doom (and that
in low graphics mode).  She has a new boyfriend who'd never played on a
LAN.  We dragged him to a chair, loaded up UT and played solidly for
around 3hrs on the 4 PC's here.  The wife, (who hates PC's), couldn't
get over the fact how much laughing and shouting was going on between
the rooms.  I think if they ever fall out he'll still want to come round
to play UT.

It's still a great game that plays on any PC and that total newbs can
get into and learn in a very short time.  I'd argue they should never
have moved so far away from this.

I'm trying to figure out how a PC that can barely play Doom can play UT.

Hmmm...remember the talk of including Doom as one of the default games
with Windows 95?  I wonder if Raymond Chen's blog has any notes about
that?

Ooops... I meant Doom 3 (which actually has a half-decent MP side to it)

I think UT2k3 and UT3 are just glorified tech demos. Play them if you
must have the latest engine technology, but otherwise wait for the
proper release with Assault mode.

And is it just me or does UT3's logo look suspiciously similar to Q3A?
I mean, where did 3 red lines suddenly come into the Unreal font?

UT was amazingly ahead of its time, with the high res textures it
still looks good, has great offline and online gameplay and a great
GUI that even its sequels lost. I wish most games today had its server
browser, let alone advanced features like the remote web admin.

I was all set to buy this game, until you said &quot;Hoverboard&quot; and I had a
quick flashback to screaming kiddies fragging me to oblivion from their
hoverboards in Quake III.. no thank you :)

They ever fix the &quot;red/blue&quot; bug in BF2/2142?

Yes. They haven't fixed all the bugs, but its unlikely we will see
another patch.

I am still playing BF2. The graphics aren't state of the art now, but
the play is good, we have vehicles and just enough to keep me
interested.
