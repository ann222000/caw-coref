COUNTERFEITS AND REFLECTORS
by Ray C. Stedman

We are considering John's great analysis, in his first letter, of the way to
maintain unbroken fellowship with the Son of God. Such fellowship is
described to us by Jesus himself as the flowing of rivers of living water
out of the center of life. It is something that cannot be hindered by
anything outward because it comes from within. Jesus said, &quot;If anyone
thirst, let him come to me and drink. ... 'Out of his heart shall flow
rivers of living water,'&quot; {John 7:37-38 RSV}. John adds, &quot;this he said about
the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive,&quot; {John 7:39a
RSV}.

Now in this first letter of John we have examined the three conditions
which, John indicates, interrupt the flow of these rivers. Or, to use the
figure that John himself employs, that block the light that shines to us
from the person of God. &quot;God is light and in him is no darkness at all,&quot; {1
Jn 1:5b RSV}. We can block the light from shining into our life, and thus
revealing reality in three ways:

First, by ignoring the light, i.e., refusing to examine ourselves, never
stopping to look at what the light reveals, going on with our life without
ever stopping to ask ourselves questions about where we are and what we are
doing and why we are what we are. Then we can close our eyes to the light by
denying the possibility of sin. John indicates that it is possible to come
to the place where we think that, for one reason or another, we are no
longer able to sin. And finally, we can obscure the light by rationalizing
the sin which is revealed in our life, by excusing it because of
circumstances, or calling it another name that does not sound as bad. We
looked at that together last week. Now John pauses in the flow of his
discourse to deal with an inevitable human reaction to this kind of a
searching examination of our spiritual life. In Chapter 2, beginning with
Verse 3, we shall look at that reaction and what he says about it.

When I was a boy we had on the shelf of our library at home a big, thick
book called, The Journal of Home Medicine. It had a lot of fascinating
pictures in it -- fascinating to me because I was hoping at that time to
become a surgeon -- and it gave a brief description of all the sicknesses
that afflict the human race, their symptoms, and their cures, or, at least,
certain suggestions as to the cures. I remember reading through that book
many, many times, and feeling a kind of macabre fascination at descriptions
of such horrendous things as cancer, diabetes, heart failure, perforated
ulcers, and other equally horrible diseases. Inevitably, after each reading
of that book, I became aware of certain symptoms which I had just read about
that were apparent in my own body, and I spent some hours of intense anxiety
over the suspicion that I was developing one of these terrible diseases.

Is that not what often happens when we start reading about sickness? We all
have a bit of hypochondria in us, and perhaps it is true on the spiritual
level as well. So when John is examining our spiritual lives, as a doctor
would examine our physical lives, and points out the sicknesses of the soul,
it is only natural that he would expect a reaction of spiritual
hypochondria, in which some of us might feel we had some of these diseases,
or even worse. He evidently feels there may be many who are saying to
themselves, &quot;Am I really a Christian at all? Can I even claim a saving
relationship with Christ?&quot; If the Spirit has convicted us and we sense a
lack, the question that is at the back of our mind may be, &quot;Perhaps my
trouble is not merely a break in fellowship; perhaps I am experiencing a
complete breakdown of faith.&quot; Of course, as we saw in our series on
spiritual warfare, the Tempter is very quick to suggest this very thing. He
is alert to push us into such feelings, to arouse such fears within us,
whenever we examine ourselves. So John stops to handle that very question.

And by this we may be sure that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He
who says &quot;I know him&quot; but disobeys his commandments is a liar, and the truth
is not in him; but whoever keeps his word, in him truly love for God is
perfected. By this we may be sure that we are in him: he who says he abides
in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked. {1 Jn 2:3-6 RSV}

He is making here a very careful distinction between two things,
relationship and fellowship. We have seen something of this in earlier
messages, but he wants us to be very clear that there is a distinction
between union with Christ and communion with Christ. The division here is
marked by the phrase, twice repeated, &quot;by this we may be sure.&quot; The first
part is in Verses 3-4:

And by this we may be sure that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He
who says &quot;I know him&quot; but disobeys his commandments is a liar, and the truth
is not in him; {1 Jn 2:3-4 RSV}

John is talking here about an experience in the past for any believer in
Christ. The original Greek makes that even clearer than our Revised
{Standard} Version or King James Version. In the original what is said here
is, &quot;by this we may know that we have known him [perfect tense -- something
done in the past], because we are now keeping his commandments [present
tense].&quot; The present willingness to keep his commandments, John is saying,
is a sign of a valid relationship. It is proof that an act of union with
Christ has already occurred, you have been born again. Your actions have
changed, and because they have changed and you do not behave as you once did
but you now have a desire to obey him, you can be sure you have indeed been
born again.

Now please do not reverse this! Do not change it around. You cannot know God
by attempting to keep his commandments. That is impossible. Let us be clear
on that. You never come to know God by trying to keep his commandments, for
the knowledge of God comes by faith in Jesus Christ. That must be first.

Martin Luther made the mistake of trying, as an Augustinian monk, to find
God by keeping his commandments. He made a desperate and sincere effort to
do anything that he felt God required of him, in order that he might
discover and know God. This is always the hunger of the human heart, to know
God. He would beat himself, spend days in protracted fasts, lay for long,
weary, agonizing hours on the cold floor of his cell in the monastery, and
try in every way he could to discover God by keeping his commandments, but
it only drove him to despair. As you know, it was only when those words from
Paul's letter to the Romans, &quot;the just shall live by faith&quot; {Rom 1:17b KJV}
came alive to him, that he found God and then spent the rest of his life
actually keeping God's commandments.

Now it must always come in that order. We receive Christ by faith, by
believing his invitation and accepting him. When we do, he comes quietly and
invisibly into our life and begins his delivering work. The sign of that
delivering work is a change in our attitude about obeying him. John says
there is a desire to obey God. Notice that Jesus himself declared this to us
in the great message called the Upper Room Discourse when he said to his
disciples (John 14:15), &quot;If you love me, you will keep my commandments.&quot; And
(in Verse 21), &quot;He who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who
loves me;&quot; {John 14:15, 14:21a RSV}.

Many of you have heard the testimony of Bill Jones, the Los Angeles business
man who, each year, picks up the check for the Presidential Prayer Breakfast
in Washington, DC. He makes a ministry of holding breakfasts and banquets
across the nation and around the world as opportunities for Christian
witness. Bill Jones became a Christian by faith in Jesus Christ. Years ago I
recall hearing him say that in a short while after he became a Christian he
had listened several times to Christians giving their testimonies and he was
struck by the number of times he had heard Christians express a love for
Christ -- how much they had fallen in love with the person of Christ. He
said, at a private gathering at which I was present, &quot;You know, I don't
think I can say that. I've been a Christian about a year, but I don't think
I've ever had any deep sense of love for Christ. This bothered me for a
while. I didn't seem to have what others had, but I ran across a verse that
has comforted me a great deal.&quot; And he quoted the verse I have just quoted
to you, the words of our Lord in John 14:21, &quot;He who has my commandments and
keeps them, he it is who loves me.&quot; Bill Jones said, &quot;I don't know that I
have the feeling, but I do have a great desire to obey the Lord, and
therefore I must love him.&quot;
Now that is exactly what John is saying here. Are you willing to obey him?
Whatever he makes clear is his will, are you already pre-committed in your
own heart to do? Well, you may have a lot of problems as a Christian, you
may have a sense of weakness or lack in your life, but one thing is clear:
If you are keeping his commandments, if you desire to obey him, then you
know him. You can be sure that you know him; that is what John declares. He
puts this also in the negative in order that we may be doubly sure:

He who says &quot;I know him&quot; but disobeys his commandments is a liar, and the
truth is not in him; {1 Jn 2:4 RSV}

Have you ever seen a counterfeit bill? I do not know that I have ever had
one handed to me. I may have, and, if so, I passed it along without knowing.
But I know one thing about counterfeit bills. Contrary to popular expression
they never come in $3.00 or $7.00 denominations. You hear the phrase, &quot;as
phony as a $3.00 bill,&quot; but I have never seen a $3.00 bill and I never hope
to see one. Counterfeiters are smarter than that. At a superficial glance, a
counterfeit bill appears to be perfectly normal and in a common
denomination. But there is always something bogus about it, there is always
something phony. There is a lack of exact correspondence. There is a blur
somewhere, or something is omitted from it which marks it as a counterfeit
bill. It is the same with a phony Christian, and there are phony Christians,
many of them.

As John indicates, they say the right things. If you were to judge them by
what they say, you would never know they were phonies. They go to the right
places, they mingle with the right crowds, and they say the right things.
They say &quot;I love him,&quot; but, as John indicates, there is something wrong with
their lives: They disobey his commandments. They have no apparent desire to
do what he says, to keep his word. Their lives are unchanged. Their actions
are no different than they were before.

As a dairyman once said to me, &quot;They preach cream, but live skim milk.&quot; Paul
also warns about this in his letter to Titus. He speaks of some who, he
says, &quot;profess to know God, but they deny him by their deeds; they are
detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good deed,&quot; {Tit 1:16a RSV}. It was
Charles Spurgeon, the prince of English preachers, who once said, &quot;An
unchanged life is the sign of an uncleansed heart.&quot; The Scripture is very
clear about this: If the thief has not stopped his stealing, if the liar has
not quit lying, if the alcoholic has not stopped drinking, there is no good
in his claiming that he is a Christian. If there has been no basic change in
his life, there is nothing that indicates to him or to anyone else, that he
has been delivered from bondage to Satan and the power of evil into the
kingdom of God. Now let me make something clear. You can stop all these
things without being born again. There are many reasons why men quit
something evil, if for no other reason than that it is bad for their health.
You can stop these things without being born again, but you cannot be born
again without stopping them. That is the claim John makes. He goes still
further in Verse 5:

...but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God [this is a
preferable translation to 'love for God'] is perfected. {1 Jn 2:5a RSV}

He declares that if we are willing to obey, then something else is also
happening to us. If we keep his word, if there is a willingness to do what
he says regardless of whether we see the reasons for it, then something else
is also happening to us: The love of God is gradually taking over our lives
and changing us, it is being perfected within us. In Romans 5, the apostle
says, &quot;the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who
is given unto us,&quot; {cf, Rom 5:5b KJV}. If we have been born again, if we
have received Christ and we are willing to obey him, then the love of God is
doing something to us. It is being shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
Spirit and it is leading us on, step by step, toward the goal the Lord
desires in our lives -- the experience of continuous, unbroken fellowship
with him.

Do you see how relationship leads on into fellowship? The act by which we
began the Christian life is intended to precipitate a process that leads us
into the experience of the fullness of Christ. It will, and it is, for God
is at work in your life to do this very thing, for this is the goal of love.
The love of God is being perfected, it is being completed, but it may take
awhile. For some of us who are particularly resistant, it takes long years,
and I speak from full experience here.

That brings us to the next section. What is the sign of fellowship? If an
obedient will is the sign of relationship, what is the sign that we are
beginning to move into the experience of fellowship? Well, that is in the
latter part of Verse 5 and in Verse 6:

By this we may be sure that we are in him: he who says he abides in him
ought to walk in the same way in which he walked. {1 Jn 2:5b-6 RSV}
This phrase, &quot;abides in him&quot; means exactly the same thing as &quot;fellowship
with him.&quot; They are one and the same experience. The Lord Jesus made that
clear when he said, as is recorded in the 15th chapter of John's Gospel, &quot;As
the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine,
neither can you, unless you abide in me,&quot; {John 15:4b RSV}. You can be in
Christ, as a member of the vine, and only bear leaves. That is mere
relationship. But if you want fruit in your life, there must be that further
attitude of abiding in him, resting in him. That, he says, is what produces
significant results in life. Without that, &quot;you can do nothing,&quot; {cf, John
5:5b}.

The sign of abiding, as John says here, is to walk in the same way in which
Christ walked: &quot;he who says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way
in which he walked.&quot; That does not mean to do the same things that Jesus
did; that means to act from the same principle upon which he acted, to
reflect the same kind of relationship to the Father that he had. That is the
sign of fellowship. Now, you who are familiar with the record of our Lord's
life, how did he walk? How did he do the things that he did? How did he
manage to speak such matchless words, convey such challenging ideas, do such
remarkable things among men, and change lives so consistently? What was the
secret of his power? You can be sure that, while he was ministering, this
was the question everyone was asking. &quot;Wherein lies this man's power?&quot;

That is what brought Nicodemus to him by night, to try to ferret out the
secret, if he could. Many others came wondering what the secret of his power
was. The amazing thing was that he kept telling people what it was, as he
keeps telling us. But we skip over it with easy disregard. He said, &quot;the Son
of Man does not do these things of himself.&quot; That is, &quot;I'm not doing this;
it's the Father who dwells in me; he's doing it. I don't speak these words
of myself, but I speak only that which I hear the Father say. It's the
Father who speaks the words; it's the Father who does the work. I am a man,
available to him, but he is in me and his working in me is the secret of the
things that I do. I am simply counting on him every minute to be at work and
to do these things, and he does them,&quot; {cf, John 14: 10-11}.

That is the great secret, and that is one of the hardest things for
Christians to learn. How did he walk? Well, he walked in total, unrelenting,
unbroken fellowship and dependence upon the activity of the Father who
indwelt him. But that seems so hard for us to learn. With us, it is the Son
of God who lives within us, and he has come to reproduce the effect of his
death and the power of his resurrection -- to live again his life in us. But
we have such difficulty with this. Our attitude is,
&quot;Please, Father, I'd rather do it myself!&quot;

We are brought up with this idea that we have in ourselves an ability to act
significantly, that God is looking to us to act on his behalf and if we fail
him the whole program will fall apart, but if we do it God should be
eternally grateful to us for our faithfulness. Does this not represent our
attitude?

But this is not Christianity. This is not what a Christian is called to do.
If we ever learn the great secret that John is trying desperately to impart
to us it will revolutionize our lives. We will never again be the same
persons. When we begin to see it, and act on it, our lives are immediately
changed, and five years from that day we will be more different than we were
when it first hit us, and 50 years later we will be still different, so
revolutionary, so transforming is this principle of action. A quiet,
unrelenting dependence upon an indwelling God to be always at work in us,
reproducing the value of his death and the power of his resurrection -- That
is what Christianity is, that is what fellowship is, that is what abiding in
him means.We are continually to expect him to do this and we are to consent
to its being done.

But this is where the rub comes! We want him to do it despite us. We do not
always want to consent to it, for his death means that we must absolutely
renounce all the self life, all the self-centeredness around which our lives
have for so long been built. His death cuts off the old man, with its
egocentric ways. We do not like that. If we were arranging the Christian
plan for living, we would devise a different process. In fact, we try to do
just that most of the time. We want to make it some of us, and some of him.
A little bit of glory, fame, power, and favoritism for us, and quite a bit
for him. We are glad to let him have the lion's share, but we hang on so
desperately to something for us!

That is the problem, do you see? But his death absolutely eliminated the
natural man. When he became man and died in our place, he cut off, he ended,
not merely part of the old life, but all of it. Therefore his death,
reproduced in us, means that all of it has to go. But that is tough, that is
hard for us to take. But, of course, what draws us on is the rest of the
transaction. His life in us means the reproducing in us of the power of his
resurrection, and that is wonderful because his resurrection power is the
kind of power that works in the midst of death. When everything else has
ceased to work, when nothing that man can do can be performed any longer,
when all hope is gone, when all possible avenues of human endeavor have been
blocked off, resurrection power begins to work. That is wonderful. That is a
different kind of power than the world has ever seen, a kind that works when
everyone else is discouraged. It keeps on blossoming, growing green and
bright, full and productive. When everyone else's life seems dead and dull,
and for them life is monotonous and boring, this power keeps one alert and
alive and interesting and fascinating. Resurrection life!

How we long for it. But, you see, the two go together. It is a package deal.
As Paul puts it, &quot;that I might know him, and the fellowship of his
sufferings and the power of his resurrection [both of them], being made
conformable unto his death,&quot; {cf, Phil 3:10}. That is fellowship. That is
what the love of God will lead us into, step by step, little by little, as
we grow along with him. And the sign of it? We learn to be dependent upon
the Father. We learn to walk as Jesus walked, in a complete and unbroken
dependence upon another to work within us. That is the sign of fellowship.

Well, then, where does this leave us? Let us not be counterfeits, denying
the faith by an unchanged life. Let us rather be reflectors, reflecting the
character, the quality, and the principle by which the Lord himself lived
his life. Let me read you this description of that from Paul's second letter
to the Corinthians:
And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord [seeing the
secret of Jesus and of his life], are being changed into his likeness from
one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord who is the
Spirit. {2 Cor 3:18 RSV}

That is what John is talking about, that is what he is trying to lead us
into, and what the Spirit of God is working at in our lives. That is the
goal toward which God is leading. May we see that goal, may our eyes be
opened, as Paul prays for us, &quot;the eyes of our understanding enlightened&quot;
{cf, Eph 1:18 KJV}, that we may begin to see the direction in which God is
driving, and walk with him in it.

Prayer:
Thank you, Father, for tearing away from our eyes something of the veil of
unreality that has hidden these things from us in the past, so that we begin
to see this is not something 'religious,' this is life itself, this is why
we are here, this is what gives significance, fullness, and meaning to our
daily experience. From this relationship with the Son of God comes joy and
peace and righteousness, and all those qualities that make life worth
living, despite the outside pressures and the adverse circumstances. Thank
you, Lord, that you are making provision for us, and it is all the activity
of the love of God being perfected in us. We pray that we may grasp this
more and more, and cooperate with you in it. In Jesus' name, Amen.
