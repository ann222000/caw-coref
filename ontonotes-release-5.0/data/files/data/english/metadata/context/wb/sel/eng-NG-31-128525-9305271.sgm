My DD#2 struggled with reading. They put her in special classes for a
few years in grade school. Then one day - bam! - something just
clicked with her. Now you cannot get her nose out of a book. She
absorbs books like they're oxygen.

I ran into her special reading teacher just the other day (the second
time I've run into her in the past few years), and told her how great
she was doing - how she is not only reading all the time, but also
writing poems and stories and says she may want to be a writer when
she grows up. The teacher wasn't surprised at all....and she said
she's left the profession because it occurred to her that kids can't
be forced to learn to read. They learn when they are good-and-ready,
and it was nothing magical she was doing.

I don't know if math is the same, but maybe it is. Handwriting, on the
other hand, I think is different. I think it's more akin to being able
to do sit-ups or push-ups or run a mile: it's partly a physcial/fine
motor coordination skill, which is something you have to work on and
develop and improve.

Heck, I bet if I gave up my computer keyboard for a few months and
forced myself to write everything out by long hand, my writing would
improve.... or at least not degenerate further!

I doubt that.  My handwriting does not improve unless I actually focus
on trying to.  I did change the way I wrote my capital Ts and Fs as an
adult because some friends made fun of the way I wrote them.  :-)  But
generally, the more I write, the faster I write.  It might feel a bit
less laborious, but I don't think that your legibility would improve
unless you made that a specific goal.

I think it is to a certain extent.  It seems like kids do need to be
developmentally ready to understand certain concepts.  They can memorize
and regurgitate enugh to pass the class, but they don't really *get* it
before that.  I don't think most of the kids taking calculus in high
school get much out of it, for example.

But it is different, in that very few kids are capable of teaching
themselves math to any great extent.  They need a good teacher available
when they are ready.

&gt; Warning:  My response to your post is just a random collection of thoughts
&gt; prompted by your comments, and it should not be inferred that I
&gt; necessarily believe that you said anything which is either consistent or
&gt; inconsistent with those thoughts.

&gt;&gt; I think folks get confused sometimes about *why* things may be getting
&gt;&gt; done in school. I have a teacher friend with whom I disagree. She tells
&gt;&gt; me all the stuff I am doing wrong in homeschooling. (Nicely. We have a
&gt;&gt; decent abilitly to disagree in a civil manner.)

&gt;&gt; Handwriting. My son is way behind in his ability to write. My attitude is
&gt;&gt; that if I were to try to *push* him to catch up to grade level, I would
&gt;&gt; make the experience even more miserable than it currently is and cause
&gt;&gt; him to not be willing to put himself into it. Instead I look for progress
&gt;&gt; from where he is. Now as a teacher, she needs people to write at grade
&gt;&gt; level so that she can see their work in other areas. But as the teacher
&gt;&gt; of 2 children, I can get my son's science, LA, math answers orally. Or I
&gt;&gt; can SEE the work he is doing with manipulatives. But my teacher friend
&gt;&gt; thinks that there is some reason for him to be writing at grade level
&gt;&gt; that is for *him* not for the benefit of interacting within a large
&gt;&gt; classroom.

&gt;&gt; Same with boring things. Why the particular boring thing is done is
&gt;&gt; likely to accomidate other people who do not find it boring. And in a
&gt;&gt; large classroom, different children are not going to find the same things
&gt;&gt; interesting. So some kids have to muscle through the boring stuff. It is
&gt;&gt; not for the sake of practicing doing crap stuff. It is for the sake of
&gt;&gt; managing a classroom.

&gt; I have serious reservations about the extent to which we should avoid
&gt; trying to teach kids that which *they* might find boring for any
&gt; particular reason, or that which they may not find interesting.  While I
&gt; think it's true that people tend to learn better about those things which
&gt; do interest them, there are certain things that people would be well
&gt; served to know whether or not it interests them, or things they have to
&gt; know in order to learn the things that interest them.

Yes I agree.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As an example which may not be a very good one, a kid may not have much of
&gt; an interest in math, but they may have a great interest in some other
&gt; field (e.g., computer programming, business administration, etc..), and
&gt; that interest may only surface years later.  Whereas math is one of those
&gt; vertically linear subjects where much of what's learned today is built
&gt; upon what was learned yesterday, it think it would be impractical to begin
&gt; teaching a kid any serious amount of math at age 16 so that he could then
&gt; delve into one of those other fields.  It may very well be that he's not
&gt; interested in math at age 6, 7, 8, 9, etc..  but that he's simply not
&gt; sophisticated enough to know that he will be interested in it later, but
&gt; possibly too late.

&gt; Even with your example of handwriting, it may be (although I don't know if
&gt; this is true) that kids learn to write more legibly or faster or both if
&gt; they learn to write sooner rather then later.  It also may be that
&gt; learning to write reasonable quickly at an early age means that it will be
&gt; easier to take copious notes, and I think it's been proven that writing
&gt; things down, even if we never read them again, is a huge benefit in
&gt; retaining what we've been taught.  If this is true, then it would seem
&gt; that the better the writing skill, the better a student is likely to do.

&gt; Or maybe not.

&gt;&gt; &gt; But it was when he was coming *off* the ADs that he got worse.  All I
&gt;&gt; &gt; know is that we need medical help, but I can't force it.

&gt;&gt; In my case, a few months of Prozac sent my mood through the roof. When
&gt;&gt; I stopped taking it, it was because I knew - deep down - that it was
&gt;&gt; the cause of my mood swing.  At first it was a pleasant switch from
&gt;&gt; depression, but then I got too &quot;high&quot; and was roller-coastering
&gt;&gt; between euphoric and dysphoric mania. I stopped abruptly, and spent a
&gt;&gt; whole day puking my guts out (from stopping too suddenly). Shortly
&gt;&gt; after, my mood went even higher. The AD was the initial trigger, but
&gt;&gt; stopping it did NOT stop the mania.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; How is he sleeping these days? Ask him if he thinks the ADs make him
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sleep poorly, feel like he's jumping out of his skin, and irritable
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and quick to anger. I would hate to see your dealbreaker be
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; continuing
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the ADs, if they are actually the worse thing he could be taking,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; KWIM?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yeah, I know.  But I had a hard enough time getting him to agree to
&gt;&gt; &gt; reading up on the alcohol + AD combination.

&gt;&gt; He drinks a lot?

&gt;&gt; Tell him that lithium is being used to treat alcoholism. It somehow
&gt;&gt; takes the craving to drink away completely. It doesn't work for
&gt;&gt; everyone - I think the theory is that it works best for those people
&gt;&gt; who drink to self-treat their manic-depression. All I know is, when I
&gt;&gt; was taking it, I had absolutely zero interest in alcohol, not even the
&gt;&gt; occasional glass of wine with a meal. I just completely lost my taste
&gt;&gt; for it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  He still hasn't talked to
&gt;&gt; &gt; his counselor about the *possibility* that he has BPD, even though
&gt;&gt; &gt; YD's been dx'd.  He's even mentioned that he thinks maybe the p-doc
&gt;&gt; &gt; who dx'd her was wrong.

&gt;&gt; The counselor isn't a shrink, is he?

&gt;&gt; &gt; It's that thing of not being able to accept less than perfection.
&gt;&gt; &gt; KWIM?  If he could just accept that there's *something* that needs to
&gt;&gt; &gt; be looked at, that the root cause needs to be found and dealt with,
&gt;&gt; &gt; then maybe we could move on from there.  But he's still not hit bottom
&gt;&gt; &gt; hard enough to get there.

&gt;&gt; Well, he has accepted that something needs to be looked at, if he's
&gt;&gt; bothered to try the AD's. Maybe he's just getting frustrated because
&gt;&gt; they weren't working. Sure, I know what you saw - you saw what
&gt;&gt; appeared to be an improvement while he was taking them, but then he
&gt;&gt; reverted to aggression when he stopped. But what you saw on the
&gt;&gt; surface, might not be what he was actually feeling internally.

&gt;&gt; I may be wrong about this but I don't think AD's wear off that
&gt;&gt; quickly. I don't think one would expect to see such a dramatic change
&gt;&gt; after only 3 days of missed doses. Maybe someone else can correct me,
&gt;&gt; if I'm wrong about that.

&gt;&gt; So it is possible that while taking the ADs he went from depression to
&gt;&gt; hypomania - which is pleasant and he may have indeed perceived this as
&gt;&gt; a big improvement. You would've seen someone more positive, upbeat,
&gt;&gt; energetic, pleasant, talkative and more focused. Not to downplay his
&gt;&gt; religion, but you may have even seen someone who became more spiritual
&gt;&gt; and who talked about having a connection to God or even messages from
&gt;&gt; God.... sound familiar?

&gt;&gt; As hypomania moved into full-blow mania, the mood may have become much
&gt;&gt; less pleasant and more intolerable. He may have been sleeping less and
&gt;&gt; less, felt irritable and snappish, been quicker to anger, started
&gt;&gt; being less and less focussed (because there's too much whirling around
&gt;&gt; in his head). It sounds like you're seeing some of this now - the
&gt;&gt; question is - what was he feeling when he went off the ADs? Whether
&gt;&gt; you saw any outward signs or not, did the feelings start before he
&gt;&gt; went off, or after?

&gt; I seriously don't know.  He won't talk about it.

&gt; Kitten
">

Kitten, maybe he *can't* talk about it.  I've known bipolars who literally
lost their words.  Unless asked, they weren't really thinking in words, and
when asked, they exhibited what psychiatric workers call &quot;negative
symptoms&quot;:

an inability to have &quot;inner consultations&quot; with one's own mind to retrieve
thoughts about feelings or attitudes

a reluctance to talk about anything that isn't concrete or material

a preference for repeating/talking about things already known and discussed

a preference for physical activity (including pacing) over talking

when not active, can be said to be mute and apparently dulled out (what used
to be called catatonia).

doesn't spontaneously understand or speak about own state of mind.

Mind blindness has been suggested as a term for it, loss of insight is the
mental status exam rubric.

Will Chewy talk about why he thinks he was prescribed AD's and what the
effect seemed to be?

Can he?  I guess he's not keen on having you go to his therapist with
him...even just one time.  But if you get to, you need to discuss this
possibility (that he's improperly medicated).

If his daughter is bipolar, she got the gene somewhere.  Is she on lithium?

&gt;&gt; Damn!  I wish he hadn't missed those 3 days of his ADs!

He should be able to tell something after a mere 2-3 weeks - and he should
*not* take them religiously if he's having serious side effects.  Thought
disorder
is one of the most common and most serious side effects of the SSRI's.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I am not sure about the job thing.  Is he going to constantly bring up

&gt; that means finding him a job yourself, maybe that is the right thing

I think Chewy is far too ill to go off by himself, but this story is exactly
how people
end up homeless and crazy in Wyoming or Montana, that's for sure (and
somehow,
they end up moving to the coast, where it's warmer - Oregon really has its
hands
full).

If Chewy can't do his chores at his own house, in circumstances well known
to him,
he's not going to be able to do chores for some ranch in Montana.  If he
can't
budget his gas and keep his truck regulated in Texas, moving to Montana
isn't going
to make him higher functioning.

This man has been diagnosed with a mental illness - we're not talking about
a simple or mere separation here.

Ah but when you &quot;repent&quot; that is an emotional event is it not?

You still have faith based on the testimony of the authors of the gospels
whose authorship is in question (at least to sceptics like me)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I understand the Bible should count as evidence but only when
&gt;&gt; I can be sure of its authorship.

&gt; It's author is none other than God, Himself.  The biggest support for
&gt; this
&gt; is Christ's own reference to and quoting of the Jewish testament.

How is that evidence a supernatural being wrote the Bible again? It could be
taken as evidence Jesus was from god because he quoted the Old testament
however if the gospels were arcuate then they were written by humans to
describe the events that allegedly took place in 1-33 AD

But

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; even
&gt; beyond that, is one's own verification from personal relations.  We
&gt; are
&gt; personal because God is personal.  We communicate our thoughts mostly
&gt; via verbage and like here in a NG, we write them out.  Why?  Because
&gt; that is design of the universe.  It is wrong to remove the personal
&gt; aspect
&gt; in all of this.  After all, isn't that was we are all really seeking -
&gt; a personal
&gt; relationship with that which can, beyond all variableness, tell me the
&gt; Why
&gt; of the universe and How of how I fit into all of it.

Yeah but if God communicated his thoughts to whoever wrote the Bible then he
didn't literally write it, it was just inspired by God.

That's the one thing we do agree on. I'm not even sure if I truly know

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; There is very little &quot;religion&quot; when it comes to being
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Christian.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If your Church is claming Christianity and they are of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Human
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; origin
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of the Roman gender then  yes you are all bogged down in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; religion
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Faith in Jesus Christ the true head of the Church.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is if you believe the bible is the word of God and believe
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; everything
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it says.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The Bible holds the true secrets to the real Church choozen by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jesus
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Christ
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Himself.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There is a whole lot more to the Bible then just words on paper.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sounds like Religion to me. We can't even know for sure who really
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wrote
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Bible. I find it amazing people would develop such faith in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; something

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Read up on the annual Holy Days.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The first passover was in Egypt when death passed-over the homes
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; marked with the blood of the lamb.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; About 1,500 years later Jesus Christ the Lamb of G-D died on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Passover to save us from death.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you worship a lamb?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mental note do not eat the lamb of God.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He was resurrected on the wave sheaf and ascended to G-D.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The Holy Spirit was sent to the church on Pentecost (Feast of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Weeks).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There are 4 more Holy Days to be fulfilled on their days.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How this could be 'faked' I do not know.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Each Holy Day and the events of them given in the time of Moses fit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the chronology and the prophecised events that have yet to come in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; exact order and required fulfillment.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Evidence?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Proof.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That's proof? Anyone could make up a story that &quot;fit&quot; the &quot;Prophecies&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the chronology.-

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes anyone single person could make up a single story.

&gt;&gt; &gt; How a group could change vast events in different lands concerning
&gt;&gt; &gt; countless people and powers over millenia of time to create 'a single
&gt;&gt; &gt; story' that covers thousands of years - I dont know.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You are not worthy to know because you dismiss anything that you do
&gt;&gt; &gt; not already believe.

&gt;&gt; Nope I dismiss anything that lacks evidence. Does that mean that the
&gt;&gt; various
&gt;&gt; myths of the ancient world (like ones involving the God's) are real to?-

&gt; That is not true. Again you have dismissed what I have said; not
&gt; because it is illogical - in truth it is an amazing series of events
&gt; more than worthy of investigation - but because it is not what you
&gt; believe. Your response, 'Does that mean that the various myths of the
&gt; ancient world are real to?' has no bearing whatsoever on what I said.
&gt; Not only were we not discussing them no one has given any evidence
&gt; that can be investigated concerning them. Which I have done about the
&gt; Holy Days and you have ignored out of hand. No attempt to consider, or
&gt; even to refute what I have stated - you simply changed the subject.

&gt; Why? is not that question. 'How' is the real question.

&gt; There is certainly something worthy of investigation here. Why is it

I sleep lightly, too... my husband claims that I never sleep well,
although really it mostly seems ok to me.  He claims to sleep worse
with me, and that's probably true, and it's probably also true that I
slept better without him, but I also think that this is one of those
ex ante/ex post things for both of us... if he didn't exist, I would
get better sleep, but given that he does, I can't stand sleeping
without him because I just fret about whether he's ok and so forth.

&gt; Hey guys,

&gt; I read an article today that stated that men sleep better next to
&gt; their partner instead of apart, but women sleep more fretfully next to
&gt; their mate than alone.

&gt; Just wondering what the consensus was here, if you don't mind.

&gt; The article also said that in the US, around 23% of couples sleep
&gt; apart (this according to a survey by the National Sleep Foundation).
&gt; A Canadian study reported 34%.

&gt; I had no idea!

&gt; For the record, I sleep beside my husband and my sleep seems ok.  Do I
&gt; feel like I get a really good rest?  No, but I am not sure that is
&gt; because I lie beside my mate.   My husband seems like he gets a good
&gt; sound sleep, and I *would* say better than I.
">

I'm a fairly sound sleeper so unless my husband rolls over and sticks his
elbow in my face or snores so loudly I wake and can't get back to sleep it
doesn't make very much difference either way. I think I do sleep marginally
better the rare times we're apart but I notice that I feel odd and miss him
in the bed next to me when he's away or out and it takes me longer to relax
into sleep. However, if it's just that he's somewhere else in the house and
not going to bed at the same time as me then it doesn't affect my ability to
fall asleep at all!

Ha!

Because my husband is a light sleeper he's usually been the one to react
first to sounds in the house and so I've stumbled out of bed a slow second
behind him for most of our time as parents except when I was nursing an
infant. I suspect knowing he's more responsive made me less so, now that I
think about it, and I certainly only feel like the family's sentry when he's
absent.

I read somewhere once that falling asleep in moving vehicles is just

My husband had a GX-something-or-other and there was no sleeping on
that.  I did feel awfully sexy on it, lol.
He took me out on it one eve and the temp dropped down.  When I got
off, I thought my knee-caps were going to burst from how cold they
were.

Good times, lol.

As far as sleeping in any moving vehicle?  No go.  I purposely keep
myself awake.  I think that the one time I drift off might be the time
the driver has a burst aneurysm or something and I need to take
over.
Hmm. I might need to relax more.

also was a journal by that name, but it was in Japanese - is that the
one you are referring to? Or maybe you have the name wrong?

Very interested in this research (so DH can interpret for me!).

As for the diabetes &amp; heart disease correlation - is it lifestyle or
genetic - I can say that I am prediabetic - despite being at normal
weight and having no lifestyle risk factors to speak of - I have long
been VERY careful of this because late-onset diabetes runs very
strongly in my family.

Did any of the articles say anything at all about correlation between
autoimmune disorders and bipolar? That is what I really wonder about.
I have not been able to find any statistics on the number of people
with both autoimmune disorders AND bipolar. I have this hunch however
that there is a correlation, especially after reading that there is a
high correlation between people who have bipolar, having siblings with
autoimmune thyroiditis (hoshimoto's syndrome).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As hypomania moved into full-blow mania, the mood may have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; become much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; less pleasant and more intolerable. He may have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sleeping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; less and less, felt irritable and snappish, been quicker to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anger,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; started being less and less focussed (because there's too
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whirling around in his head). It sounds like you're seeing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this now - the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; question is - what was he feeling when he went off the ADs?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whether you saw any outward signs or not, did the feelings
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; start
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before he went off, or after?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I seriously don't know.  He won't talk about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kitten

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kitten, maybe he *can't* talk about it.  I've known bipolars
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who literally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lost their words.  Unless asked, they weren't really thinking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; words, and when asked, they exhibited what psychiatric
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; workers call
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;negative symptoms&quot;:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an inability to have &quot;inner consultations&quot; with one's own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mind to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; retrieve thoughts about feelings or attitudes

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snipped&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Had to go back and find this.  It's been a busy week.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He, OS, and YD all have times where they say that they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *nothing* - absolutely, totally - nothing.  That boggles my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mind.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't conceive of having absolutely zero thoughts going in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; head.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, that's not possible, but I can recall many times
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; X when I would say that I was thinking absolutely nothing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were the times when I knew that I could not share what I was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinking for fear of an enormous downside, not only to me, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the relationship.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 99 times out of 100 if asked DH will answer &quot;I have no idea&quot; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;sex.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Asking for a person to share their thoughts is a lot like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; asking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them to share their dreams.  In many ways, they're all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; involuntary,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and so the person hearing them has to be very open minded, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; receptive to hearing virtually anything, no matter how painful,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to remember that what they were told was in the context of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; asked.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For instance, I can remember many times early in our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relationship
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when I would answer that question with something like &quot;well, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wondering how much longer this party would last because I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bored&quot;, only to have my X repeat what I said to someone else in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terms of a complaint.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OUCH!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  IOW, without volunteering that she had asked what I was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinking,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she'd say something like &quot;You know what he told me last night
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company banquet?  He told me he was bored and couldn't wait for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be over. After all the boring parties I've been to for him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without any complaints, he has the nerve to complain that he's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bored&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As you can see, all of that was absolutely factual, but it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; true. It was portrayed as though I was volunteering that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information, instead of being asked.  Sure, I could've lied
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what I was thinking, or I could've said I was thinking nothing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But that only leads to being accused of lying, either way.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see the *particular* relevance of it being voluntary or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; asked. It was rude and catty in any event!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I'm bored, then I'm bored, and there's nothing I can do about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it.  How is that catty?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or is it catty that I said I was bored?   If that's what's catty,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can that be so if I'm asked what I'm thinking, and that's what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinking?  Are you suggesting I should lie?  Are you suggesting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that I should've told my X that it was none of her business?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The difference being saying it voluntarily, and being asked, is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the former case, I can reasonably be held responsible for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attempting to pressure her for us to leave, or possibly to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she knows she owes me one, or some other selfish motivation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if I'm sucking it up, and I'm doing my best to have a good time,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm doing my best to make sure that she feels relaxed and free to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stay
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as long as she wants, but she asks me, then I can't be held
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; responsible if my answer spoils her evening.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That seems like a huge difference to me.  If the shoe is on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; foot, and I ask a question, I can't possibly hold my SO
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; responsible
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for *the fact that she told me something*, although I can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hold her responsible for the content of whatever it is she tells
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me.- Hide quoted

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dunno 'bout Stephanie, but it's your ex's behavior that I find to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be
&gt; catty.

&gt;&gt; Maybe I misunderstood her.

&gt; Maybe.

As usual, the sum total of what you've got to offer is to be the NG
