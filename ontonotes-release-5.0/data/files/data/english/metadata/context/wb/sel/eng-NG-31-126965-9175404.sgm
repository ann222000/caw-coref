Hi,

I have some html that relies on a stylesheet and although the styles
are recognised in FireFox 2, in IE7 the page displays without any
colour or font styles being applied.

My stylesheet.css contains several sections like the following :

my_section_head {
color: Red;
font-size: large;
position: absolute;
left: 0px;
visibility: visible;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
}
">

These are referred to in the page.html file in a similar way to this :

&lt;div id=&quot;Chroma_Sub_Sample&quot;&gt;
&lt;my_section_head&gt;Chroma Sub Sample&lt;/my_section_head

I don't believe the problem is down to IE not being able to see the
stylesheet because if I change eg &quot;rsm_head&quot; to &quot;h3&quot; as follows in the
stylesheet and html file then the formatting is picked up :

h3 {
color: Red;
font-size: large;
position: absolute;
left: 0px;
visibility: visible;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
}
">

&lt;div id=&quot;Chroma_Sub_Sample&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chroma Sub Sample&lt;/h3&gt;

Is there something wrong with the names I've picked ?  I mean, must
they be specified in a certain way or start with a special
character ?  I tried prefixing my_section_head  with &quot;.&quot; and with &quot;#&quot;
but that made no difference.

Any halp greatly appreciated,

Thanks,

Mike

Oops, there's your problem: it doesn't work that way. You can't just
invent a new element the way you have here. You've tried to invent the
my_section_head element, which HTML doesn't (and won't) include or
recognize. (Even ignoring the missing &gt; on the closing tag. ;-)  )

Right, because HTML knows about h3; it's in the DTD. Maybe Jukka or
someone will come along and expound on DTDs and their extensibility, but
you should simply move to standard HTML.

Try a CSS tutorial and pay attention to how elements and their rules are
used/referredd to. http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/ is one I

You don't get to invent tags like &lt;my_section_head&gt;.

You could use something like
&lt;span class=&quot;my_section_head&quot;&gt;

.my_selection_head {...........

Or, you could use something like

Correct so far.

That would be foolish for several reasons. One of them is that when CSS is
off, &lt;span&gt; markup has no effect and its content is treated as text level
stuff with no special rendering. And the class name is not clever and
informative; just an example, yes, but a _bad_ example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or, you could use something like
&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;my_section_head&quot;&gt;

Wrong too. It's not a paragraph. It's a heading. You want it to appear as a
heading (whatever that means in each browser) even when CSS is not used.

And there's little reason to use an id attribute for styling when the
style_could_ well be something that you might use for other elements (other
headings) on the page as well.

The sensible approach is (assuming this is a 3rd level heading for
particularly sexy headings, among the different 3rd level headings on the
page)

&lt;h3 class=&quot;sexy&quot;&gt;...&lt;/h3&gt;

with CSS like

h3.sexy { ... }

It's a good idea to add an id=&quot;...&quot; attribute to the heading element, but
that's for linkability rather than styling. It _does_ allow a particular
element to be styled in a particular way, too, of course.

That goes without saying.  Obviously an &lt;h...
heading is better for headings.

The op's question, however, was not about that, but with why his
CSS was not working.  To go beyond that in excruciating detail

The suggestions were addressed to the mechanics of why the colors did not

Yes, _my_ comments have a meaning. (Semantics is the study of meaning.) You
are whining about having been corrected in an essential point. The choice of
markup affects the styling as well (in addition to affecting non-CSS
rendering), since different elements have different default rendering.
Therefore, getting the markup right from the beginning is essential and
helps to avoid wasting time.

When corrected, you could just stand corrected.

You may sit down now.

Realistically, css is about as optional as the paint on a car.  You don't
need it, the car will work, but...  Anybody who turns css off is a nitwit.

Semantics, on the other hand, are particularly valuable to non-visual html
applications but not especially critical to visual rendering.  Yeah, I know
all about &quot;tag soup&quot;, but going overboard in the other direction is at
least as annoying and only dubiously productive.  That other newsgroup
about html, ciwah, invariably puts me to sleep whenever I amble 'round
there looking for some, uh,  &quot;excitement&quot;.

In any formal system, there is the syntax, which is amenable to absolute
and decidable questions of correctness or incorrectness.  Onto this syntax
there might or might not be tacked on a semantics which interprets it.

Certainly, the various organizations and such can give a clear picture
of HTML's syntax, including what is definitely correct and incorrect.
But given the nature of web pages, it is impossible for the organizations to
give a complete picture of the semantics.  Suggestions of what constitutes
good style certainly have value, but
questions of semantics such as you brought up were, at best,
pedantic, given that the op was really interested in the mechanics of what
was making his markup fail to show a color.

(And this is especially true since we do not have the
complete webpage and some very good pictures of the inside of the
op's head so that we can somehow devine his or her complete intentions)

So you are saying - though you probably didn't mean to say - that a visually

web.

You are also saying that I am a nitwit when I turn CSS off to test how a

be able to read a page at all because it has a mass of broken CSS that does

Well, yeah, okay, but how often?  The point is that without using
deprecated markup, css is just about the only styling option left.  (I
suppose &lt;h1&gt;, etc., and things like &lt;acronym&gt; could be considered styling,
but they are germane in but few cases.)

Furthermore, css actually goes beyond styling into layout with options like
positioning, :before - content:, and even overflow.  Today's Web is css
dependent, and only the most bare-bones and undesirable sites could exist
without it (... _or_, as I said, deprecated markup.)

I rather agree although I'd say the distinction between styling and layout
is the issue.  Layout is required; styling technically isn't, but paint on
a car...

Naturally there are exceptions.  Water is required to survive, but not
too many people are going to drink from a lake with green slime on it.
My comment was directed at the prevailing habit of the overall majority
whether or not to enable css, and I think it is evident they would be
foolish not to.  Testing, compensating for inept web pages, and
instituting provisions for personal physical challenges hardly invalidate
the principle.

I understand current wisdom _suggests_ that css is optional, but
pragmatically, it just isn't.  We are within the medieval ages of html
evolution.  Eventually the renaissance will come when persons analogous
to Galileo, Copernicus, and others with a brain will lift us all out of
the great Darkness and whoosh us into the light of a simpler html where
most of the average, general public might learn how to make a webpage
without the illogicalities and inconsistencies that plague mankind today.

Btw, I'm Swedish so learning Finnish might be heretical to my heritage.

&gt; &gt; did the css in the first place.

&gt; Well, yeah, okay, but how often?  The point is that without using
&gt; deprecated markup, css is just about the only styling option left.  (I
&gt; suppose &lt;h1&gt;, etc., and things like &lt;acronym&gt; could be considered styling,
&gt; but they are germane in but few cases.)

&gt; Furthermore, css actually goes beyond styling into layout with options like
&gt; positioning, :before - content:,

&gt; &gt; Actually, a white reflective paint job on a car keeps the inside
&gt; &gt; cooler. There is a moral here about meaning. The distinction
&gt; &gt; between style and content is not quite Sound of Music, it is
&gt; &gt; dirtier.

&gt; I rather agree although I'd say the distinction between styling and layout
&gt; is the issue.  Layout is required; styling technically isn't, but paint on
&gt; a car...
">

The distinction between styling and layout is not quite &quot;the'
issue when it comes to the question about style and meaning
generally. When style is spoken of in the context of these
matters, it is almost always meant to include both colouring,
sizing, and yes, positioning and layout too. And quite rightly
for most purposes.

An example of where layout is *obviously* crucial to meaning is a
tabular table. A table is a good example of where how something
is laid out determines its meaning. Once the basic
meaning-related layout is achieved (greatly assisted by built in
HTML table magic), there comes a time for the *stylistic*
enhancements like colours, types of fonts, border types,
background colours and so on. But it is not a clear cut thing. If
you look at a table of atomic elements, you will see that some of
the styling, especially background colours, play a more than mere
optional role. These more than optional roles are where the
blurring occurs. It is often quite difficult to think up ways to
communicate things without the help of style.

Another way to look at it is this. There is a built in styling
(and I am not talking about default values, paras indented just
so so) to writing html itself. The order of the paras are
important to meaning. You can't be messing too much with classes
and positioning here otherwise you will change the meaning of the
whole, or confuse it. A list, visually, naturally, goes down the
page in the order it is written. It does not change the meaning
much if it is put inline. But there are constraints, you can't do
just anything in css without affecting the meaning communicated.

There is sometimes more than a marriage of convenience between
HTML and CSS, sometimes it is a holy union. Its sanctity is only
obscured by the triviality of so much that passes by on the
internet.

The best thing that any author can do is create create html that
can stand on its own as much as possible. That means it will mean
as much as what the author wants to convey as possible on its
very own. Then it is time to hitch up. The marriage will be all
the more successful, the more independent the html is in the
first place. But that does not mean that the marriage *merely*
enhances the meaning.

&lt;Yawn&gt;  Reading all that made me really sleepy.  Anyway, I think we're
generally in accord here and I particularly agree with you about html
standing on its own as much as possible.  That's like the skeleton of the
proverbial animal.  &quot;There's no pheremones without dem dere bones.&quot;
However, semantics and separation and all that can be overstated as to
importance because the really important thing is how the page works and
looks, not how well it follows some hypothetically-optimal formulae.
Even validation can take second-seat if real world experience bears out
that a method or procedure is recognized overall and functional despite
what the w3c mopes have to say.

I have always suspected that there is only one really good and

yawning so: to send Officer White around to have a little word.
Actually, I have asked him to come and beat me up afterwards
after he has dealt with you - after I discovered myself yawning
at the above. Or maybe it is just the boozy afternoon that i have
had with Bush and Putin. Bush is a bit prissy (his wife was
watching us), but my god, that Putin can drink! I will tell you

&quot;Bush and Putin&quot; - sounds like a vaudeville team.  Btw, &quot;Putin&quot;
dyslexically in &quot;Input&quot;.

When I refered to being sleepy, I didn't mean to suggest that your
overlong, rambling message was boring or anything like that.  (If you're
confused by the lack of an included referral, that's because you snipped it
whilst retaining said to wit overlong and rambling missive.)  But don't
worry, I have taken the liberty of exorcising the morphoditic morsel and we
all can rest easier knowing that we won't be put to sleep at our keyboards.

Negatives can actually be summary as opposed to antipodal.  I had an
acquaintance once who sucked.  He told me about this acquaintance of his
whom he said sucked.  Naturally, I thought that this acquaintance of my
acquaintance and I might share some common ground, -you know, like
opposites of opposites are the same or the enemy of your enemy is your

removed acquaintance suck at least three times as much as my original

But I do know a joke about sucking. I was visiting an elderly
relation once in a nursing home and as I was walking past one of
the rooms, I heard an old feller from the other side of the door
say: &quot;Suck, Mildred, suck! &quot;Blow&quot; is just an expression!&quot;.
