Janet Fullwood: It seems that everyone at the airport is searching for
a plug

Walk up and down any airport concourse these days and you'll see
legions of people -- business and leisure travelers alike -- scanning
walls and structural support posts for electrical outlets where they
can hook up their laptops and kill some time.

Folks in need of plug-ins will plop themselves on the floor in the
most unlikely of places -- underneath a bank of pay phones, say, or on
the cold linoleum floor outside a restroom, just to use the juice.
It's common to see three or four perfect strangers sharing a power
strip that some foresightful traveler has packed along just for the
occasion. (&quot;Hi, can I share your plug?&quot; might just be the new travel
mantra.)

I'm especially aware of this trend because I'm often one of the people
looking for an outlet. Popping open the computer and watching a movie
or working on something -- notes, a story, whatever -- makes the time
pass faster and helps me block out crowds and annoyances like people
talking loudly on cell phones.

The Internet is nice to have in such circumstances, but the charge for
connecting via Wi-Fi is sometimes prohibitive. I mean, who but a
business traveler on a fat expense account is going to pony up $7 to
$10 to check their e-mail during a half-hour wait at the gate?

I long ago gave up even clicking on the dialogue box that appears when
my computer receives a wireless signal, asking if I want to be
connected to the such-and-such network.

But a funny thing happened on the way to Dallas/Fort Worth a couple of
weeks ago. During a five-hour flight delay at Phoenix Sky Harbor
International Airport, after I'd finished my newspaper and gotten
bored with my book, I popped open my laptop and, just out of
curiosity, checked &quot;yes&quot; on the dialogue box. Much to my surprise, I
immediately was connected to the Internet -- for free.

When I brought this discovery to my husband's attention, he shrugged
and told me the service had been free in Sacramento, too.

What? Last time I'd opened my laptop there, they wanted $6.95 to
connect.

Well, live and learn. Turns out free Wi-Fi has been available in
public areas at Sacramento International for -- get this -- more than
a year, ever since the facility's contract with a previous service
provider ran out. That's right, more than a year. And we never told
you about it in the Travel section. Sorry about that.

Maybe I was out of town (or out to lunch) when the news release came,
because the airport issued one, back in April 2006. Airport
spokeswoman Gina Swankie just sent me a copy, explaining the whole
deal. &quot;It's important to note,&quot; she added by phone, &quot;that the service
is free in all public indoor areas, so you don't have to find a hot
spot, you can log in wherever you are.&quot;

But why no marketing, no trumpets and banners proclaiming the advent
of this great public service?

It's coming, it's coming, says Swankie. Seems the airport is entering
into a promotional agreement with the new local magazine, Prosper,
which will help spread the word with gate-area signage and such.

Meanwhile (did they read my mind?), the airport is experimenting with
pod-style seating in the Southwest Airlines section of Terminal A,
where laptop users can plug in and take comfortable advantage of the
free Wi-Fi.

&quot;We're closely looking at solutions for what's going to serve our
customers best,&quot; Swankie said.

Turns out, many airports around the country are going to free Wi-Fi.
Most are small- to medium-size facilities like Sacramento and Phoenix
Sky Harbor, but a few major players have gotten on the bandwagon, too.
Among them: Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Colorado Springs, Portland,
Pittsburgh, Columbus, Las Vegas, Long Beach, Orange County,
Philadelphia, Richmond, Roanoke, Milwaukee, Cheyenne, Seattle and JFK.

For laptop-toting travelers who find themselves in the all-too-common
position of waiting out a delay, this is a bright spot in the nation's
otherwise chaotic travel picture.

To find out in advance if the airport you're transiting has free Wi-
Fi, go to www.wififreespot.com/airport.html or www.jiwire.com .

And if it doesn't, have a look at iPass.  My university has a group
subscription, currently made available free to traveling staff and
faculty, and it's provided wi-fi access for me in a variety of odd
locations around the world.

Some of us are kind enough to bring along splitters too -- So I'm not
the only one that gets to use the plug if I happen to get there first.

You're the ones she is mentioning in this part:

strip that some foresightful traveler has packed along just for the
occasion. (&quot;Hi, can I share your plug?&quot; might just be the new travel
mantra.)&quot;

I do wish that these various power cords for laptops and cell
phones
had secondary sockets built right into the back of the plug, a
bit like many Christmas light strings.  Even at home that would
allow for plugging in secondary devices.  Most of these devices
don't pull anywhere near the 15 amps most sockets can handle
(20 for commercial grade circuits).

That's actually *exactly* what mine looks like.
