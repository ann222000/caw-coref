This isn't necesarily a bass fishing question but I figure a few
of you guys have probably tried Berkley Fireline at some point.

When tying a leader to toss big wind resistant flies you want
the butt section, the piece tied directly to the fly line, to
be stiff so it will more easily turn over the big flies. The
standard butt section material is a product called Mason Hard
Nylon. It works as advertised and transfers the power of the
fly line evenly to the rest of the leader and helps to turn
over even very large flies. The problem is, it's hard to tie.
It's like trying to tie a knot in a steel pipe.

I'm looking to put about a three foot butt section of leader
between a 9wt fly line on one end and a piece of titanium wire
on the other, the titanium wire being attached to the fly, for
Muskie fishing. So I get a Cabela's catalog in the mail today
and paging through it I find Berkley Fireline and it's described
as easy to knot.

My question (after all that ;-), how stiff is Berkley Fireline
in the 30lb test and is it really easy to knot ?

Ken I don't know if it will work, but I can send you a EZknot tool, and
try tying it with that. If not, that tool is a great little nail knot
tool you can use it for that

It's not stiff enough for what you want, I don't believe, but it is easy
to knot

None of the braids as far as I know are stiff.  Most are really limp.

Being a fused line rather than a braid, right off the spool, Fireline is
pretty stiff. But the outer 'coating' breaks down pretty quickly, and
the line becomes VERY limp.

Ken,

Likeothers have said, the braids are limp. Super strong, and easy to tie,
but they don't turn over anything bigger than about a size 10, maybe size 8
fly.

On the advice of the now-closed local fly shop, I use this stuff for the
butt section when going for pike:

Then for the actual "tippet" to the fly, I use this stuff:

(Bought elsewhere, just the first shop I found online that carried both.)

Thanks Dan, and thanks too to all who replied and to Rodney for the
offer of the knot tool.

I used Mason Hard Nylon on my 7wt bass rig and it works well enough
turning over the big deer hair I use, but I sure wasn't looking
forward to tying it on again to the 9wt Muskie line. That salt water
butt section looks nice but isn't 60lb test overkill ? I may buy a
small spool of Maxima clear in 30lb and see how that works before I
expand my vocabulary again trying to tie on Mason. As for the tippet
I've been advised that titanium is the way to go because it won't
kink even after repeated trips dragging a big fly through the weeds.

This stuff is fairly expensive:

And Cabela's sells this version:

But for as little of it as you use it's not gonna break the bank.

Sitting here watching it snow and planning and plotting for spring.

The places I've fished for pike (Pelican Lake in Orr, MN and various lakes
on Isle Royale) are *very* weedy, so while the 60 pound certainly is
overkill for the fish, it really lowers the odds of a break-off in the
cabbage. I rarely have to tie the butt section more than once a day, so
while not the easiest, it's "knot" a huge deal for me.

I may buy a

That's true. A buck a foot (plus or minus) certainly ain't cheap, but
considering that I use about 3 feet at a time and unless I change flies like
a madman (sometimes,) the thing will last a couple days at least. While
quite a bit unorthodox, in order to use even less of the wire, I use a
figure-8 knot to connect fly to wire. Very strong, and untie-able (usually.)
Being that I have good eyesight and I'm a cheeep bastid, it's the right knot
for me.

Yessiree on that. I'm sitting in my liberry carrel, staring out at the
blizzard currently engulfing the near west side of Chicago, day dreaming of
warmth and trout. Or bass. Or pike. Or salmon. I 'll be picky when it's
warm.

Ken,

Have you tried any Tyger Leader?  It's a braided stainless product that you
can tie knots with, just like any stiff mono.

I've not tried Tyger Wyre but I asked about it specifically when
I talked to Bill Sherer, a Muskie guide from Boulder Junction.
Bill claims Tyger Wyre kinks too easily during heavy use in the
weeds and steered me toward spending a little more on the titanium.
