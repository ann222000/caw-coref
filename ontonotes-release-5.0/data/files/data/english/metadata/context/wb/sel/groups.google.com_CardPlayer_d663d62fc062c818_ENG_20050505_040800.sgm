Editor's note: Part I of this story, excerpted as is (unedited by
Card Player) from the recently published Aces And Kings (Wenner
Books), chronicled Stu Ungar's rise as a master gin player in New
York, his growth into a great no-limit poker star, and his love for
the 24-hour action of Las Vegas. That initial installment can be
viewed at  . Much of the information in this
article comes from interviews that one of the authors conducted with
Stu Ungar during the summer of 1998.

One auspicious afternoon in 1975, back when he was still living in
New York and reigning as the city's most fearsome gin player, Stu
Ungar found himself at the home of a friend named Bernie. Set down
in the middle of Bernie's kitchen table was a small, amber colored,
glass vial. It contained a gram or so of white powder. Amazingly, 22-
year-old Ungar needed to ask what it was. &quot;Cocaine,&quot; replied
Bernie. &quot;It lifts your spirits and makes you feel good.&quot;

Attached to the vial's cap was a small spoon. Bernie scooped a bit
of cocaine onto the spoon and held it out for his friend. Ungar
leaned forward and snorted a hit of coke into each nostril. Almost
immediately he turned giddy. It was a 180-degree reversal from how
he had been feeling since early that morning. &quot;This was the day I
put my mother in a nursing home,&quot; Ungar remembered during the course
of a lengthy interview at Arizona Charlie's, an off-strip casino in
Las Vegas. &quot;She was crying like a baby and she broke me up, but I
couldn't handle it no more - to be playing cards, trying to scratch
out a living, and my mother calls me to bring her a bedpan.&quot; Unable
to shake that first snort of coke from his memory, Ungar added, &quot;I
started very moderately, like a gram a week.&quot;

Before moving to Las Vegas, Ungar said, drugs played a very small
role in his life. Prior to the age of 22, he hadn't even smoked a
joint. He didn't drink. He didn't party. His vices at that point
were gambling and chasing girls. &quot;If there were 58 massage parlors
in New York, [Stuey] knew all 58,&quot; card player Teddy Price told a
reporter. &quot;And he was a big tipper. He'd walk in the door and the
girls would yell, `Stuey's here!'&quot;

By the time he won his second World Series championship, in 1981,
his drug consumption had spiked precipitously. But Ungar insisted
that it was rooted in practicality. &quot;I did the coke to keep up,&quot; he
said. &quot;You use it as an excuse to stay awake and play poker. But
then you take it home with you.&quot; Ultimately, of course, the cocaine
went beyond recreation and practicality. &quot;When you have access to it
and the money don't mean nothing and people keep calling you with it
...&quot; His voice trailed off, implying that there's nothing you can do
to fight the temptation. &quot;It's a sickness. I don't even like to
think about it. I guarantee you, it's taken 10, 15 years off my
life. I don't look like it, but I feel beat up.&quot; Actually, whether
he wanted to admit it or not, he looked plenty beaten up. It was as
if the pain that he felt inside had leaked out, erasing what once
seemed like indelible youthfulness from his poker face.

The coke-fueled '80s stands as the decade when Ungar's sports
betting spun completely out of control - right along with his drug
intake. &quot;The figures were exorbitant,&quot; Ungar acknowledged. &quot;A
regular person wouldn't even be able to relate to it. Winning a
couple hundred thousand playing poker was nothing compared to what I
would lose in sports.&quot;

Vegas's golf courses served as another sinkhole for Ungar's card
room millions. &quot;Stuey's a big sucker at a lot of things,&quot; Puggy
Pearson said in the late '90s. &quot;Because he's so good at certain
things, he thinks he should be good at everything. This is his
downfall.&quot; Puggy recalled that, as a golf handicap, Ungar was
allowed to tee up all of his shots. &quot;That's a huge advantage, and he
had all kinds of tees - big long ones, itty-bitty short ones. Hell,
I seen him tee the ball up in a lake one time at the old Sahara golf
course. But he still lost every damned thing he had. He'd lose his
shoestrings if he needed a couple dollars. That boy can't be still.
He's got to have action.&quot;

During one memorable two-week period, Ungar went on a massive
winning streak at the card tables and then laid it all down on a
long Thanksgiving weekend of football games - Thursday through
Monday. &quot;I had a million in cash going into that weekend,&quot; Ungar
said, &quot;and at the end of Monday Night Football, I owed $800,000.&quot; He
lost $1.8 million in a weekend? Ungar nodded. &quot;I was betting
$100,000, $150,000 a game. That was nothing to me. I had no sense of
the value of money.&quot;

He hesitated a moment. &quot;Sometimes I think that I wanted to lose, so
that I could get mad and go back to the poker table.&quot;

Drugs and sports betting combined to leave Ungar financially and
spiritually destitute. The dual demons created a vicious cycle that
wreaked havoc with the one thing he could have done brilliantly:
play poker. &quot;He was always under pressure because he went through so
much cash,&quot; remembers Billy Baxter, a professional gambler and
frequent backer for the often destitute Ungar. &quot;Stuey's money
management was a joke, and he kept himself against the blade all the
time. He never got into a comfortable financial position. He had to
win every day just to support his lousy habits. Then he'd run bad a
couple days in poker and be busted again.&quot; Indeed, when Ungar was
losing and strung out, says high-stakes poker player Barry
Greenstein, he became so scared and so desperate &quot;that you were able
to push him around like a little girl.&quot;

In the mid-1980s, Madelaine left Stuey and took his beloved
Stephanie with her. Several years later, a poker-playing friend
carted a dining-room set out of Ungar's home to settle a gambling
debt. In 1992, he sold his beautiful Tudor home for approximately
$270,000. &quot;I needed money,&quot; Ungar remembered. &quot;I borrowed $150,000
against the house. It was one of those hard-loan shit things, you
know, and I had to pay the guy back.&quot; Ungar considered the
circumstances for a moment. &quot;I had a nice house.&quot;

Things didn't get better. Throughout the '90s, Ungar slept where he
could and occasionally surfaced when he needed to win or borrow
money. There were fl ashes of the old brilliance, but he spent most
of his time away from poker, caught up in a world dominated by drug
dealers, hookers, con men, and petty thieves. He scraped by with
occasional low-profile le action, through financial support from
benevolent friends, and by calling in the many loans he had made to
other players back when he was flying high. But for the most part,
nobody wanted to get involved with an unrepentant, unreliable drug
addict. Even Phil &quot;Brush&quot; Tartaglia, Ungar's minder from New York,
began to distance himself.

By all appearances and opinions, Stu Ungar was completely finished
as a competitor in the heady world of no-limit. He seemed like the
Brian Wilson of poker - a brilliant guy done in by drugs and his own
strange, unmanageable form of genius. Then, during the early months
of 1997, Ungar hit some kind of emotional nadir, and it compelled
him to resurface, initially through occasional appearances at $20
buy-in tournaments around town. &quot;People were saying how I'm a has-
been and washed-up and all that,&quot; Ungar explained. &quot;Finally, it got
to me real bad. My pride was hurt. So I tried to eat right, got some
sleep, put myself into shape to play.&quot;

Some of it, however, was involuntary. Following a couple of busts,
one for possession of drug paraphernalia, another for trespassing,
Ungar was legally compelled to remain clean. Whatever the impetus,
though, his changes slowly became evident during the 1997 World
Series. If his presence initially seemed like a sick joke, by day
two nobody was laughing. On the third afternoon of play, local
newspaper reporters, contemplating their leads for Thursday's paper,
had already rechristened Stu &quot;The Kid&quot; Ungar as &quot;The Comeback
Kid.&quot;&quot;If they wanted to do a clinic on no-limit Hold 'Em, they
would have filmed me from day one to the final hand,&quot; Ungar said in
1998. &quot;You can't play more perfect than I played. It was just a
thing of beauty, what I did in '97. I was reborn.&quot;

At the start of the fourth and final day of the Series, Ungar had
almost $1.1 million stacked in front of him, dwarfing his nearest
competitor by more than $300,000. He was confident dent and cool,
diminutive and fl ashy, with blue-lensed granny glasses and a
densely patterned shirt. He played with such confidence that it was
as if he could see through the backs of his opponents' cards. &quot;It
might have been the greatest performance ever in a World Series of
Poker,&quot; says Mike Sexton, now a commentator on World Poker Tour,
then a respected high-stakes player. &quot;He just dominated the tables.&quot;

ESPN cameras stalked Ungar as if he were a movie star, and he
reveled in the attention. When it finally came down to Ungar and
John Strzemp, then president of Treasure Island Hotel and Casino,
for the championship, it was clear that Ungar was the superior
player by a wide margin. &quot;But,&quot; says Sexton, &quot;John was smart enough
to recognize that he couldn't play with Stu Ungar. You can't sit
there and play with the guy and let him take your money slowly but
surely as you go along. John realized that the only chance he had of
beating Stuey was to get all his chips in the pot as quickly as
possible and gamble with them.&quot;

The miraculous resurrection culminated with Ungar pulling a
tournament-winning straight on the final card of the last hand.
Smiling broadly for the cameras, telling reporters how vindicating
the victory had been, holding up a photo of his daughter that he had
kept close to him throughout the contest, Ungar seemed to be his old
self. &quot;He was in his element again,&quot; says Sexton. &quot;He was put back
in that throne of destiny, where he would have a new chance to start
fresh. I really thought he would do it.&quot;

Ungar, posing before a fortress of banded $100 bills, a freshly
minted World Series of Poker bracelet in front of him, became the
first player to win three championships. He promised to keep himself
in shape for the next year's Series. &quot;I was sleeping for 15 years,&quot;
he announced. &quot;I've decided to wake up.&quot;

But just a couple of months after netting $500,000 (the million-
dollar first prize, minus a 50-percent cut for Billy Baxter, who put
up the $10,000 entry fee), Ungar was broke. He apparently blew the
money on all his old vices: sports betting, drugs, and hookers. A
poker-playing friend who popped by the apartment where Ungar was
staying in late '97 remembers a refrigerator with nothing in it but
Tang. Propped against one wall was a beautifully framed collage,
filled with laudatory press clippings from Ungar's glory days. &quot;I'm
reading the collage, and there's something in there that
says, `Talent will get you to the top, but you need character and
discipline to stay there,'&quot; recounts the friend, one of Stu's old
coke buddies. &quot;I said, `Stuey, we ain't got that fucking shit. We
have character and talent, but we don't have discipline.' He heard
me, but he didn't say nothing.&quot;

Whatever Ungar's problems, it seemed to be a given that he'd put in
a good effort to defend his World Series crown. He checked into
Binion's Horseshoe on April 17, intending to rest up and get
acclimated for the championship event three and a half weeks later.
Billy Baxter, who once again funded Ungar's $10,000 entry fee,
suggested he get himself warmed up with a couple preliminary
tournaments. But Ungar waved him away and said, &quot;I don't need that
shit.&quot;

On the morning of May 11, the day the Series was slated to begin,
Ungar's cocaine addiction was in full fl are, leaving him
emotionally depressed, strung out, and physically wrecked. His right
nostril was practically flush against his face. The tips of his
fingers had been burned black from handling the hot end of a glass
crack pipe. Bob Stupak, casino entrepreneur and occasional backer of
Ungar's, had offered to provide a hairdresser and makeup artist to
ensure that the drug addled star would look presentable, but Ungar
never green-lighted them to come upstairs.

Just minutes before the tournament's starting time, Ungar
remembered, &quot;I got showered and dressed. I put my clothes on. And
then I looked at myself in the mirror. I looked terrible. I looked
like I came from Auschwitz. That's when I knew I couldn't sit there
and play for four days, for 10 hours a day, and put in a good
performance. I wasn't geared up. I was physically out of it. The
year took a toll on me.&quot; As the opening hand was being dealt, Ungar
remained sequestered in his 12th floor room at the Horseshoe. Baxter
managed to get back his $10,000 and the game went on without its
defending champion.

Ungar stopped speaking for a moment, maybe to replay the World
Series nightmare in his mind. &quot;Listen, not coming down to play in
that tournament was criminal. I honestly think I could have won back-
to-back if I was in decent shape. But I thought it would have been
more embarrassing to have shown up looking the way I did than for me
to stay in my room and not play. In the end, though, I disappointed
everyone and, what's worse, I made everybody who's jealous of me
happy.&quot;

But maybe the horrible experience had given him perspective. If he
walked away from the Horseshoe with a realization that some things
are more important than the primitive act of winning money - like
not letting down the very people who care about you - then it all
could be worth it in the long run, couldn't it? Ungar considered the
theory for a split second. &quot;If there is more to life than gambling,&quot;
he said, &quot;I don't know that I'm able to enjoy it. And what I'm
afraid of is that gambling ain't stimulating me lately. That's a bad
sign.&quot;

Several days after opening up at Arizona Charlie's, Ungar was having
dinner with his ex-wife, Madelaine, and daughter Stephanie at the
Sahara Casino and Hotel, a mid-level place on the Strip with a low-
stakes poker room. Stephanie, 16 at the time, was a lovely,
intelligent girl who had endured a lot of disappointment and
heartache from her father. At that moment, though, she was thrilled
to be with him. &quot;We've spent a whole week together,&quot; she gushed.
Most importantly, he appeared to be completely straight. &quot;People
introduce themselves to my dad and say that it's a pleasure to meet
him. We walk around holding hands, and everybody is so happy to see
my dad with me.&quot;

When they strolled into the Sahara's poker room, Ungar's dentist was
there, messing around in a low-stakes, 30-person freeze-out with a
$22 buy-in and a first prize of a few hundred dollars. Just for
kicks, maybe showing off his star patient, the dentist requested
that Ungar pull up a chair and enter the event. Considering that
Ungar's more obvious poker milieu would have been the Horseshoe or
the Mirage, where, at the time, games ranked among the highest in
town, this was a bit of a comedown. But, as a favor to the man who
had built a bridge for the front of his mouth, Ungar dispatched his
ex-wife to the blackjack pit and accepted the invitation.

He wound up signing 40 autographs, and a crowd of some 200 railbirds
formed around a tournament that would ordinarily have generated no
interest whatsoever.

Goosed by the crowd and glad to be back in action, Ungar played
aggressively and hard, as if psychologically making up for the World
Series he had missed. &quot;It came down to me and this old man,&quot; Ungar
recalled. &quot;I had $12,000 in tournament chips in front of me. He had
$400. Then he outdrew me for seven pots in a row and won the thing.&quot;

Ungar was initially upset about losing. Then the man told him, &quot;You
made my life, Mr. Ungar. I can tell my children, my grandchildren,
and everybody else that I beat you.&quot;

After shaking the man's hand, Ungar said to him, &quot;If I can make your
life, I'm tickled that I lost.&quot;

This encounter provided a rare glimpse at Ungar's sentimental side,
but, sadly, it didn't augur long-term change. A couple of weeks
later, he convinced a doctor to prescribe narcotic painkillers and
found himself backsliding into drug dependency. Following a
disagreement with his girlfriend, he bashed her in the face with a
telephone. She kicked him out of her house and called the police. He
went to stay with a friend, someone said, but nobody seemed able to
find nd him.

Mike Sexton hinted that Puggy Pearson might have a lead. Puggy had
met Ungar two days before at Sam's Town Hotel and Casino, and had
lent him $500. &quot;He didn't look too damned good,&quot; Puggy said. &quot;Stuey
was sitting there on the bench, next to a guy who claimed to be his
plumber. Stu gave me his word, on his daughter's life, that he would
pay me back $500 in two days, which is today. I lay 100-to-1 that I
don't hear from him until he needs me again. But that's okay.&quot; Puggy
sighed. Then he added, &quot;Stuey's all right.&quot;

A day later, Ungar was back at Binion's Horseshoe, registered on
someone else's credit card. Speaking over the phone and sounding
lucid, he said, &quot;I'm gonna start playing. I'm waiting to see a
friend of mine who's got money for me. Then I go to the Mirage.&quot;

Despite vows to resume his once brilliant career, Ungar maintained a
ghostly poker-room presence during the summer and into the fall of
1998. Billy Baxter lent him 25 grand and he used it to play $30/$60
Hold 'Em. But his heart was no longer in it. Inferior players beat
him in headsup matches, and cocaine retook its place at the center
of Ungar's life. He continually phoned the Mirage poker room, trying
to scare up money from old friends, but nobody would take his calls.

Then, in November 1998, things seemed ready to turn around yet
again. Ungar signed a contract with hotelier Bob Stupak, agreeing
that Stupak would pay off Ungar's debts and finance tournament-play
in exchange for a piece of Ungar's future winnings. Stupak even
assigned a bodyguard named Dave to look after Ungar and make sure he
stayed away from drugs. However, on November 20th, Ungar convinced
Dave that he had to take his daughter to a birthday dinner.

Dave cut him loose on that Friday afternoon, and Ungar checked into
the Oasis Motel, a notorious short time sex joint on the northern
end of Las Vegas Boulevard. He paid cash for a single night and
claimed the Mirage as his permanent residence on the check-in form.
Earlier in the day Stupak had given him a $10,000 advance,
as &quot;walking-around money.&quot;

The next morning, after Ungar failed to check out of his room on
time, an Oasis employee knocked on the door, entered the room, and
found him lying face down in bed, shaking. Apparently in no
condition to leave, Ungar asked to see the hotel manager, then
slipped the manager a $100 bill for a second night. &quot;Can you close
the window?&quot; Ungar asked. &quot;I'm cold.&quot; The manager looked up and
noticed that the window was tightly shut.

Twenty-four hours later, on November 22nd, Stu &quot;The Kid&quot; Ungar was
found lying in the same faced own position on the mattress - but
this time he was dead. Eight hundred eighty-two dollars, all that
Ungar had to his name, was in his pants pockets. Police found the
room to be clean of drugs and paraphernalia.

According to a Clark County spokesman, the official cause of Ungar's
death was coronary arterial sclerosis brought on by his lifestyle.
Essentially, the arteries around his heart hardened and would not
allow blood to circulate. Ungar's passing was ruled accidental, even
though cocaine, Percodan, and methadone were found in his blood.

Maybe the dope in Ungar's system reflected a final binge before he
checked into the motel with the intention of kicking his habit for
good. Maybe he sensed that the end was near and wanted to die alone,
in peace. Or maybe something more nefarious transpired.

A longtime friend of Ungar's claims to know what happened. &quot;Stuey
bought a bunch of crack and picked up two hookers who like to troll
near the Oasis,&quot; says the friend. &quot;Once they found out how much
money Stuey had on him&quot; - presumably a good chunk of Stupak's
$10,000 - &quot;he was as good as dead. They pushed him to smoke enough
so that he went into convulsions - which Stuey was prone to do. The
convulsions came, they took most of the money, and left Stuey for
dead.&quot;

Ungar's funeral was presided over by a rabbi and financed by Bob
Stupak. The ceremony was a who's who of no-limit players, and Stupak
reportedly hit them up for donations to help cover the burial costs.

Days later, at the big-money tables around town, cards were dealt,
millions were won and lost, and the games rolled on unabated by the
passing of poker's ultimate supernova.
