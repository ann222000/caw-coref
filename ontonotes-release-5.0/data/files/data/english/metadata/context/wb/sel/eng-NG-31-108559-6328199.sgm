Passed along to me by my daughter-in-law...

From: "Renee Thompson" &lt;obscu ... @aol.com&gt;

The door was open....

Let's say I break into your house

A lady wrote the best letter in the Editorials in ages!!!
It explains things better than all the baloney you hear on TV.

Her point:

Recently large demonstrations have taken place across the country
protesting the fact that Congress is finally addressing the issue of
illegal immigration.

Certain people are angry that the US might protect its own borders,
might make it harder to sneak into this country and, once here, to
stay indefinitely.

Let me see if I correctly understand the thinking behind these
protests.

Let's say I break into your house.

Let's say that when you discover me in your house, you insist that I
leave.

But I say, "I've made all the beds and washed the dishes and did the
laundry and swept the floors.

I've done all the things you don't like to do.

I'm hard-working and honest (except for when I broke into your house).

According to the protesters:

*       You are Required to let me stay in your house

*       You are Required to add me to your family's insurance plan

*       You are Required to Educate my kids

*       You are Required to Provide other benefits to me and to my
family

*       (my husband will do all of your yard work because he is also
hard-working and honest, except for that breaking in part).

*       If you try to call the police or force me out, I will call my
friends who will picket your house carrying signs that proclaim my
RIGHT to be there.

*       It's only fair, after all, because you have a nicer house than
I do, and I'm just trying to better myself.

*       I'm a hard-working and honest, person, except for well, you
know, I did break into your house.

*       And what a deal it is for me!!!

*       I live in your house, contributing only a fraction of the cost
of my keep, and there is nothing you can do about it without being
accused of cold, uncaring, selfish, prejudiced, and bigoted behavior.

*       Oh yeah,

*       I DEMAND that you learn MY LANGUAGE!!!

*       so you can communicate with me.

Why can't people see how ridiculous this is?! Only in America ...if
you agree, pass it on (in English). Share it if you see the value of
it.

If not blow it off......... along with your future Social Security
funds, and a lot of other things.

Not only in America.
Social unrest among the UK's impotent 'lower' social orders is now akin to
that of Germany in 1925.
The government  must listen very hard. History is repeating itself.

Well, all things mentioned seem right to me. But what about the things *not*
mentioned?

Closing the borders is a big problem on its own and not only in the States.

Throwing burglers out of your house is relatively easy. They only hit the
street. But how do you throw that people out of a country? Which other
country will gladly let them in? Want to sweep them all in the ocean? (Do I
really need to say that last sentence is not meant seriously?)

Biggest problem however are the houseowners that, once that illegals have
sneaked in, keep them inside to do a lot of work for only a fraction of the
costs of real honest workers. Were I live penalties for having illegal
workers on a job are high. Nevertheless too many people still take the
risks. (So IMHO the penalties are not high enough.)

As it's all about money - it almost always is - a partial solution can only
be found by rising the cost of illegal workers. So send them back to where
they belong at the cost of their employers. The latter should pay a
considerable penalty for the damage done to the society as a whole.

Some say that too large a part of of the economy has been build on illegal
workers. I can't judge. If it's true however the influence of that illegals
may be to high already to neclect them. I can't even dream of a solution.

Most of our illegals can be easily sent back to their home country,
Mexico.

Perhaps too large part of our economies has been built on foreign workers,
most of them still resident in their home countries... perhaps... or just
maybe these workers will eventually benefit from our exploitation and rise
closer to our standard of living, thereby effectively torpedoing the
excessive waste in our lifestyle by raising the costs of the cheap
chuckaway crap they currently spend their lives making.

I, for one, would welcome a more rational economy that knows how to value
things more sensibly, even though it will degrade the relative value of
(Western) labour.

It's seems to me you need to take an honest look at whether you actually need
these 'housekeepers' then.

If you do need them , is it acceptable to say the law doesn't apply to them ?

The "Jewish conspiracy" never really existed.  The Muslim conspiracy

There are some good points, but to make the analogy more valid one might add:

-- You might have initially invited the person into your house -- paying them
as a maid --, but then they overstayed their welcome and now you want them out
-- The person who broke into your house *may* have also paid your taxes, the
premiums for the health insurance they desire, for the schools for their kids,
etc.
-- In some cases your home was broken into only so that a child could be born,
who automatically has rights to live in your house (that's the law, sorry if
you don't like it)
-- You do have the right to kick them out, but it wouldn't be surprising if
your neighbors thought a little less of you if you chose to do so in a
rainstorm.

---

From a legal perspective, the fact that there's been such a huge lack of
enforcement of existing immigration laws gives illegal immigrants some
standing.  Very much like adverse possession... if I build a shed on your
property, and 20 years passes while you do nothing about it besides curse me
under your breath, a judge is very likely to decide that I now own that chunk
of your yard.

The way Renee's message is written quietly ignores this history.  I think
*almost* everyone is for having border security, actively turning away anyone
who cannot legally enter the country, and spending tax dollars on border
patrols (although, of course, people will quibble about just how much).  The
reality, though, is that we have decades of history now, with millions of
illegal immigrants already in this country, and like the adverse possession
case, the fact that little has been done about it for so long makes the
situation far more complicated than Renee's Pollyannaish model suggests.

Even Bush wanted a guest worker program, right?  Seems that he's willing to
put financial gain ahead of any reservations he has about tacitly encouraging
illegal immigration.

Her, "If you agree with me, please proselytize, if not, go to Hell" ending is
a nice touch. :-)

Interesting!

Lot's of this type of "info" going around.

I spent 6 months on a Project in L.A. a few years ago, and had many
occasions to mix with Mexican/Americans in their cultural environment, and
other environments.

For what it's worth, I found them more friendly and welcoming than most
white Americans.   Y'all could learn a lot from these people you want to
dislike.

I'd like any of them as a neighbor instead of you, Jim.

Neeerp!  Just an ability to hire a good caterer ;-)

Actually my daughter-in-law is learning to gourmet cook from my wife
(primarily Dutch ancestry, with a little French thrown in)... who, as
Spehro will attest, is quite skilled in the art.

As most here are well aware... I am areligious.  But if I had to
choose, I'd be a Jew... their family oriented lifestyle fits right
with mine.

every illegal who does pay taxes is alleviating a legal
citizen of paying his own taxes. Perhaps you have a part
of the solution - make every illegal pay double taxes, one
for himself, and one for a legal.

the small percentage who get speeding tickets gives a speeder
legal standing in court?  Or consider rape, arson, murder,

Let's see what he actually said regarding illegal
immigration:
"We're matching all visa applicants against an expanded
screening list to identify terrorists and criminals and
immigration violators. This month, we have begun using
advanced technology to better record and track aliens
who enter our country -- and to make sure they leave as
scheduled. We have deployed new gamma and x-ray systems
to scan cargo and containers and shipments at ports of
entry to America. We have significantly expanded the
Border Patrol -- with more than a thousand new agents
on the borders, and 40 percent greater funding over the
last two years. We're working closely with the Canadian
and Mexican governments to increase border security. "

Not at all.  The point was that, with illegals in this country for decades
now, and millions of them, many of them have had children -- who are full,
legal U.S. citizens -- and there's a case to be made that just deporting the
parents and somehow leaving the kids here in the U.S. is more of a disservice
to society as a whole than letting the immigrants stay... at least for awhile?
It's just a very messy issue, largely brought about by the U.S. not "nipping
it in the bud."

Personally it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to claim that, "children born in
the U.S. of parents who are *not* themselves legal do *not* _automatically_
become U.S. citizens."  Why don't we see any politicians suggesting this?

In a court I suspect a lawyer could make a very persuasive case that, until

See my shed example.  Building a shed on your property is clearly
tresspassing, but if you do nothing about it for 20 years, not only is the
tresspassing no longer a crime (at the very least there's a statute of
limitations!) but I now have claim to the property.  Pretty nice, eh?

are just as "creative" in their defenses as those trying to make illegal

It sounds like a pretty weak argument to suggest that a million low-income
illegal immigrants paying into social security is going to somehow weaken it
in a manner worse than a million low-income legal residents, doesn't it?

I don't think anyone under 50 who pays seroius attention to their own
retirement planning is expecting one penny from social security when they
retire anyway -- they figure anything they'll get is just a bonus.

My main point was that, yes, I'm all for immediately booting out people caught
trying to cross the border illegal whether it's at the border or a few days or
weeks or months later when they try to apply for a job, etc... but I think
it's very naive to think that somehow we could take all the illegal immigrants
who've been here for *years*, rounds them all up over the course of a few
months, and dump'em back in Mexico City without a *huge* socio-economical
impact that would have a lot of knee-jerk reactionists regretting the action.

No. -All- immigrants, (disregarding all religious aspects or countries
of origin), as the "new jews".
My comment meant to indicate the difference in perception between the
current government and it's wealthy opinion formers, who will happily
sanction immigration as a means to control wages and  provide their
long missing servant class and that of the common working man, who
after struggling for generations to  achieve basic rights such as
education, health care, social security etc, now finds himself in open
competition for basic resources with a large group of incomers, who
considering their own sufferings and shit backgrounds, can easily see
that the UK streets are truly paved with Gold.
Being able to work 18 paid hours a day, live in a real house with 6
other  families, the kids being educated and health care for free is
infinitely preferable to starving to death, watching out for the death
squads or working the salt mines.
The problem is that to compete,  the indigenous working people must
completely  discard what they've spent hundreds of years fighting for.
It ain't going to happen.
Through sheer hard work, economy and group support, the new class of
workers will start to take over the professions, businesses ... A few
history books provide the rest of the story .

There's a two-part solution to the wetback "problem". Maybe three.
One, think up some kind of wetback license, like a day pass. Set

To solve the problem of the "cost" of "social services", we need

&gt;Let's say I break into your house

&gt;A lady wrote the best letter in the Editorials in ages!!!
&gt;It explains things better than all the baloney you hear on TV.

&gt;Her point:

&gt;Recently large demonstrations have taken place across the country
&gt;protesting the fact that Congress is finally addressing the issue of
&gt;illegal immigration.

&gt;Certain people are angry that the US might protect its own borders,
&gt;might make it harder to sneak into this country and, once here, to
&gt;stay indefinitely.

&gt;Let me see if I correctly understand the thinking behind these
&gt;protests.

&gt;Let's say I break into your house.

&gt;Let's say that when you discover me in your house, you insist that I
&gt;leave.

&gt;But I say, &quot;I've made all the beds and washed the dishes and did the
&gt;laundry and swept the floors.

&gt;I've done all the things you don't like to do.

&gt;I'm hard-working and honest (except for when I broke into your house).

&gt;According to the protesters:

&gt;*       You are Required to let me stay in your house

&gt;*       You are Required to add me to your family's insurance plan

&gt;*       You are Required to Educate my kids

&gt;*       You are Required to Provide other benefits to me and to my
&gt;family

&gt;*       (my husband will do all of your yard work because he is also
&gt;hard-working and honest, except for that breaking in part).

&gt;*       If you try to call the police or force me out, I will call my
&gt;friends who will picket your house carrying signs that proclaim my
&gt;RIGHT to be there.

&gt;*       It's only fair, after all, because you have a nicer house than
&gt;I do, and I'm just trying to better myself.

&gt;*       I'm a hard-working and honest, person, except for well, you
&gt;know, I did break into your house.

&gt;*       And what a deal it is for me!!!

&gt;*       I live in your house, contributing only a fraction of the cost
&gt;of my keep, and there is nothing you can do about it without being
&gt;accused of cold, uncaring, selfish, prejudiced, and bigoted behavior.

&gt;*       Oh yeah,

&gt;*       I DEMAND that you learn MY LANGUAGE!!!

&gt;*       so you can communicate with me.

&gt;Why can't people see how ridiculous this is?! Only in America ...if
&gt;you agree, pass it on (in English). Share it if you see the value of
&gt;it.

&gt;If not blow it off......... along with your future Social Security
