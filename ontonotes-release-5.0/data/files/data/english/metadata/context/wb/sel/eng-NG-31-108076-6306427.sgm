TV news this morning is filled with the whiners. First CNN features some
lady that wants a new Airline Passengers Bill of Rights from congress
because of the people that got stuck on the runways in the bad weather. Ok
that was an unpleasant experience; but give me a break.
Then on C Span some lady that wrote a book entitled " Why the 20 to 30s
Cannnot Get Ahead" wants congress to foot the bill for a college education
for everyone.
Meanwhile congress is busy spending its time debating a non binding
resolution like it is doing something. More whining.
Lead, follow, or get out of the way.
Give it a break whiners.

It was more than unpleasant.  The airlines outright screwed their
customers.  There's no reason on earth why passengers should have to sit
in a plane on the tarmac for 12 hours without being disembarked (or fed)
because the flight was canceled. There's no reason in the world why
passengers who's flight was canceled (usually at a layover) should have to
*buy new tickets* to complete their flights.  Several of those type things
happened.  Now whether or not the government should get involved as part
of Consumer Protection is a different argument, but it's plain that the
airline companies royally reamed their customers.  What really makes it a
pip is that this thing has happened before and there was a big push for
government regulation.  But the airlines promised,
cross-our-hearts-and-hope-to-die, that they'd self-police, create their
own "Passenger Bill of Rights" and *stick with it*.  Well, they obviously
didn't.  Should the appropriate punishment be customer backlash,
regulation, or something else is what's up for debate, not that the
aggrieved passengers don't have a right to be upset.  They do.

I think they were offered lodging and free first class tickets, no??
Sure it was a fuck up and the airlines ought to be made to work it out
so that 12 hours ain't in the works- but it out to be by discussion for
the benefit of airline and passengers- not another judicial backlog.
The airlines has to schedule around weather emergencies better than they
did.

According to the airline, they screwed up by putting the planes on the

Cannot just jump off. So it was a cluster fuck caused by bad weather and bad
decisions. Life aint perfect - people make mistakes. This is not ever going

No shit-
people *died* on the Interstates-
nobody can deal with the weather, and maybe airlines least of all.
You can run a train when there's bad weather- but not a plane.
You can run an automobile or bus- but not a plane.
They got stuck because they were trying to provide good service- to get off
the runway as soon as the weather broke from 'ice-pellets' to 'rain'.
That didn't happen.
The stairways were iced up and they didn't want damned fools breaking their
legs going down them. Just think what fodder the whiners would have had
then-
it was a minor, yes- *minor*, inconvenience.
I can't understand the whining- had the planes taken off, and crashed,
they'd really feel misused.

Mostly because decisions were being made moment-to-moment (hoping for the
weather to change from ice-pellets [as forecasted continuously during the
event], and considering that the stairways were iced up and dangerous, and

No, they don't.
They want special consideration from Mother Nature; special consideration
from the weather forecasters, special consideration from the plane
provinders, special consideration to debark and then re-board,......
Duh; that's why they call it Winter and want to get down to Cancun.

The first few hours were taken up by the weather forecasters' predicting a
change in the weather- from 'ice-pellets' to 'rain'. Jet Blue was trying to
keep from having to cancel the flight- looking for a window in which to take
off.
It was way out on a runway- not next to the terminal. Just getting things to
the plane, or off of it, during an ice-storm, is difficult enough. Trying to
provide shelter, overcoats, umbrellas or anything else to over a hundred
people is more of an effort than you think.
Salt only works when the temp is high enough to cause melting- and not when
the ice is being replenished constantly. Allowing the passengers to debark
on a dangerous stairway (a story and a half in the air), in the middle of an
ice-storm, would have been irresponsible.
The plane wasn't provendered for a long flight, so there weren't meals on
board- and they don't make them at the airport. It isn't like you can snap
your fingers and have food for a hundred people appear.
Whining about the effects of a storm that's killing people, stranding
thousands, inconveniencing millions, is pitiful.

Actually, airlines have a lot better deicing chemicals than salt if they

Hell, they couldn't move one of those other planes away from the space
it was occupying long enough to bring this one up and let the passengers

I rather doubt that. But if you think a passenger bill of rights will solve
the problem it does not bother me at all. Next you can have a passenger bill
of rights for getting stuck on the interstate. The government can inspect
your vehicle to make sure you have the proper survival kit on it that you
will now be required to purchase with the  vehicle.  We can have a whole new
bureacracy of inspectors.
Or you can stay home when the weather gets bad. Otherwise you can take your
chances.

The question no one has answered yet is how bad was the ice storm? How
violent was the wind? How feasible was the stair solution? Simply proposing
the solution without giving the particulars is unimpressive. No one has
answered this question for me. Everyone has acted like it was a sunny day on
the tarmac.
As far as herded like cattle - well  that occurred when the congressional
Democrats decided to protect you from terrorism. Personally, I would rather
dismantle that bullshit bureacracy of inspectors and get on the plane with
my pistol like I used to. But no the wussies cannnot think or protect
themselves. Now think how much cheaper my solution would be for all. No one

They were forecasting a 'quick' change from ice-pellets to rain, and it

Ice-pellets are particularly hazardous at take-off speeds. The FAA shuts

They were caught by weather- same thing that's been grounding airlines since
the plane was invented.
Are the people who were on buses stuck by the side of the road entitled to

And next thing you know they might actually start holding doctors

Actually, they were waiting for that long for the imminent break in the
weather as forecasted by their meteorologists. The Pres of JetBlue referred
to that quite often.
After that period, when the airport was deep in little ice ball-bearings,
his problems changed from waiting to take off to dealing with a hundred
people getting restless for Cancun.

At the very least, it was three or four hours of 'ice-pellets' accumulating
on the runway.
That was while they were waiting for it to change to rain/snow, in which
conditions they would fly.
The storm lasted for a day or more, didn't it? The ice-pellet condition was
the only weather that they couldn't fly in because of the ball-bearing
effect on a plane trying to take off, much less getting hit with ice-pellets
at a hundred miles an hour.

There really _is_ no level of weather which would have been both too
dangerous to require them to leave them on the plane, and safe enough to
actually leave them on the plane.  If the weather is so dangerous that they
cannot move a, now empty, plane away from a terminal long enough to move
this one up and get the people out, then the weather is too dangerous to
leave them on the plane in the first place because that situation is
tantamount to saying that weather is dangerous to planes_on_ _the_ _ground_,
at least if they're not securely tied down or sheltered.  In that situation,
you've got a bona fide emergency and it should be treated as such.

Dr's are human and make mistakes.  They're also professionals and

Sorry, but your posts don't read as "trying to determine" if they did
their bests.  Your posts read as trying to make any excuse for them.

How long does it take to empty a plane, move it away from the gate, and
move up another.  Divide that number into 12 hours and then multiply the
results by the number of gates.  That's how many planes they could have
emptied in that twelve hours if they'd wanted to.

Yeah, you take a chance since not everyone is competent or gives
consideration.  That does not mean you don't have a legitimate complaint
when you don't receive that.  When I go to a restaurant I always take the
chance of receiving poor food and service.  And when I do, I have a
legitimate complaint which I express in various ways from reducing the size
of the tip up to complaints to the manager or to the health department
(depending on severity and nature of the infraction).

Same thing here in magnified form.

Not at all.  If they cannot get those people off that plane in less then

&gt;&gt; I do know something about aircraft and weather conditions too

&gt;&gt; out on the tarmac either.

&gt; OK I am no expert. But that does not make a lot sense to me.

The only reason you could not move a plane away from the gate and move
another one up is if the winds and pavement conditions are so bad that they
are a danger to an unsecured plane.  If they are a danger to an unsecured
plane, then they are a danger to that plane full of people sitting out there
on the tarmac, more so since the way airports are laid out there's just
about always one or more gates that will be on the lee side of the building
where it is sheltered at least partially from the weather.  In such
circumstances, you have a full-blown emergency and need to treat it as one.

If you had said "yes, they have a legitimate complaint, but...." then
there would have been no argument.  However, when Kirk pointed out that the
folk in question have a legitimate complaint you jumped in immediately
denying that.

IMO, the folk who were stuck on that plane have a legitimate complaint.
We have seen that the airlines are, well, reluctant at best to redress the
issue. (I am willing to take Kirk at his word that this is not an isolated
incident and I have certainly seen evidence of the same kind of attitude
that I characterzed as "not giving a shit" myself.) If they won't take
responsibility than it is up to us as consumers to hold their feet to the
fire, as it were.  Congress, and lawmaking, IMO, is probably too blunt an
object to use.  However, this is exactly the kind of thing that the Class
Action Suit was invented for.

Except for ice-pellet storms; a particular weather condition that is the
exception to many weather related regulations.
Ice-pellets act like little ball-bearings; they don't crush easily, and make
the landing gear unstable. They also are destructive at high speeds, like
taking off.

The condition is dangerous to moving planes- in fact, to ground vehicles
period. They might have debarked them in tracked vehicles- perhaps a
bulldozer.

In an ice-pellet storm; driving them on ball-bearings?
a while.
And, if you fuck up, they're million-dollar vehicles and the hazards to
life&amp;limb are sufficient not to engage them unless lives are at stake.
As opposed to 'stinky bathrooms' and a few moments of hunger.

As with the runway being covered with hours of ice-pellet fall. The hazard
was not just taking-off, it was moving the planes *at all* with the pavement
conditions. The added hazard of increasing the speed of contact with the
pellets, by take-off speeds or other, was additional to the ball-bearing
aspect.
The same would be for tired vehicles- and that's in addition to the hazards
inherent in any other ice-storm.

because they *don't* have a legitimate complaint- no more than a bus
passenger stranded by the side of the road with fewer bathrooms and no
expectation of food provided. There were *hundreds* of people stranded that
way- in both public and private transportation. I saw some newscast where
they were talking about *50 miles* of stranded vehicles on an interstate;
hundreds of thousands affected by power outages- people *dying* from these
storms.
The passengers should be thankful they were warm and protected, quit
whining, be appreciative that it went so easily, and enjoy their
complementary tickets. It's far more than they deserve.
