You know at the end of Civil War when Captain America just went up and
surrendered it left a bad taste in my mouth.

Seconds from victory he ups and quits leaving the Irondick the victor
and us having to spend the next year with him trying to register
people left right and centre cause he knows best and he Won the war
apparently while semi-concious.

Gee..thanks Steve.

I thought that there was nothing in comics that could come close to
making me feel such digust.

Then came Black Adam.

Then came the slaughter of millions of citizens in Bialya cause Black
Adam was really pissed off.  After that he heads off to China and does
some damage there.  Civilians perish, heroes buy it finally he is
captured and now is time to be punished.

Now he gets stripped of his powers and the 'heroes' leave it at that.
They dont try to hunt him down or anything cause there is no frackin
way he will learn the magic word that will restore his power.

Less then a year later hes up and running again.

This made took the vile taste out of my mouth and replaced it
something worse.

Couldnt Marvel call on the mojo power to kill the tosser ?

Maybe, maybe not.

But what if he did it in the Marvelverse.  Which got me on how the god
like beings would have handled it if they had captured Black Adam or
dealt with Black Adam after his temper tantrum.

Im pretty sure heroic gods would have actively hunted him down.

Now Hercules would have kicked his head in, maybe take a second or two
later to spit on him.

But that got me thinking about Thor, would the blonde power house of
Asguard have hunted down and executed Black Adam for his crime whereas
his DC counterpart merely stripped him of his power.

The fact of the matter is the bastard commited genocide ( a cynical
part of me says that he did it in a ' middle eastern ' country which
may have lessened the blow.  I mean after all a couple of million rag
heads aint no loss right.)

Now if Black Adam had single handedly wiped out a small town called
Sandsford in his quest for vengence the US goverment would have
demended the hereos take neccessary action to end him.

Cynical math.

Bialya - middle eastern - couple million middle eastern folk-
unfortunate statistic
Standsford USA - Midwest america - couple hundred americans-
unbeliviable tragedy.

Hell that would have set off a sort of Civil War for DC where the
worlds Goverments issued global Execution Warrents on mass murdering
supers and the like ( Deathstroke, Black Adam etc) and we have a whole
scenerio where if a super doesnt kill Metas or the like who commit
multiple murders then said Super is accountable for any further
innocent people killed when Deathstroke and pals escape prison.

Sorry..back to subject.

Now after Thor#3 was pretty bad ass, kind of Old School.  But could
Thor kill an unpowered or helpless enemy?  I kind of think of yes
cause he a warrior.  But then again...

--see I thought he did the best thing possible.  I *still* find myself
wondering what exactly Cap was going to do.  Tony had a plan
throughout Civil War.  Cap's was nothing more than &quot;continue doing
what I've always done&quot;.  Cap would never have won the war that way. He
certainly wouldn't have turned public opinion around just by
continuing to fight the bad guys the old school way. I was really
hoping that Millar would have given us a scene where Cap and his
allies are deciding--long term--what their ultimate goals were.  Never
got it.  That's why, despite the fact that I sided with Cap, I also
realized he was going to lose.

kill if it's a kill or be killed situation though.

--actually, now that you mention Odin, seeing as he's been dead for a
while now--and we don't know if he'll be back during JMS' run--perhaps
Thor *would* cast judgement upon Black Adam.  After all, you're right,
he has in the past brought ne'erdowells to Odin, since he was the
AllFather and ruler of Asgard.  Now, however, Thor is the ruler of
Asgard. Such duties his father once had are now his.

I agree with you that the True Gods would have intervened, but they aren't
who you think they are.

In a universe ruled by Stan Lee, a genocidal murderer would be executed (see
Dark Phoenix).

In a universe under Mort Weisinger, a genocidal murderer would either be
sentenced to eternal prison with no chance of parole (Jax-Ur) or turned to a
stone statue and then shattered by Jax-Ur (Black Zero).

In Julie Schwart's creation, a would-be genocidal murderer would be stopped
before succeeding.

In those days, heroes were heroes, and gods strode the earth.

But in a universe ruled by &quot;just a guy named Joe&quot;, civil war is forgiven and
genocide forgotten.

True.  Nonetheless, she committed suicide because Stan dictated that she
must die, and his word ruled.

If you go back and look at my post, you'll see that the word &quot;editor&quot; is

The reason for Cap's actions is because Cap never has a plan. He makes
it up as he goes along, instead of planning for contingencies, because
when you are in the middle of a warzone, there is little time to plan
ahead. This is the difference between war veterans and actual
politicians. The reason Cap surrendered is because he knew that, in
the long run, his way of doing things was not going to work. There
needed to be a fundamental sea change in the mentality of the
leadership. Cap could have changed his mind and come to terms with
long term political thinking, but he is a soldier, not the general.
His job is to do and die. He did and died. Now it's time for a solid
realist to take over where airy fairy idealism has failed, regardless
of how harsh that seems, because sometimes people can be too
idealistic for their own good. People might naturally like to believe
the best, but when your hero is essentially the superheroic equivalent
of Barry Bonds, what can one expect?

&gt; The reason for Cap's actions is because Cap never has a plan. He makes

&gt; ahead. This is the difference between war veterans and actual
&gt; politicians. The reason Cap surrendered is because he knew that, in
&gt; the long run, his way of doing things was not going to work. There
&gt; needed to be a fundamental sea change in the mentality of the
&gt; leadership. Cap could have changed his mind and come to terms with
&gt; long term political thinking, but he is a soldier, not the general.
&gt; His job is to do and die. He did and died. Now it's time for a solid
&gt; realist to take over where airy fairy idealism has failed, regardless
&gt; of how harsh that seems, because sometimes people can be too
&gt; idealistic for their own good. People might naturally like to believe
&gt; the best, but when your hero is essentially the superheroic equivalent
&gt; of Barry Bonds, what can one expect?

To me Cap surrendered because that was the only way the writers could
think of making Tony win without having Tony actually beating Cap in a
fight.

That and it was another Screwjob on his character starting with the
whole Sally Floyd mess in Frontline.  They take a decent guy, a guy
who is fighting for the rights of men and women who chose to risk all
in the good fight.  Then they have Sally Floyd slander him and make
him sound like some old fart not in touch with the real world.

This is the guy who has sacrificed himself for his country and justice
and they have this lady who is not fit to lick his boots critisize
him.

If not for heroes who whould stop the Baron Zemos or Masters of Evil.
Floyd made it sound like the heroes where a burdan to the everyman and
was held accountable to them.

Next to sweeten Tonys image they next made Sally floyd pretty much
simper over his plans.

The whole ending sounded false because there was nothing leading up to
the oh what have I done moment.  Caps been a soldier and in a fight
you fight to win.  Also WTF was up with those guys pulling him off
Tony.  Mighty convient that in the hundreds of superhuman fights these
three decide to jump in.

Of course I felt the subtext of the common man deciding to pass
judgement on the relic which really got me pissed off.

They where just lucky it wasnt the Ultimate Cap, he would have just
crippled them and gone back to beating the shit out of Tony.

Hmmmm..but on subject I still think Thor whould have executed Black
Adam.
