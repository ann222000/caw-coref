The WSJ has a story about mentally ill criminals who, because of budget constraints, are confined in penitentiaries rather than mental institutions. The story is obviously intended to elicit sympathy for these prisoners, but I'm not sure it is successful in that regard.

Jesse James--that's apparently his real name-- "squinted into the gleaming sunlight* toward the six-story guard station towering over Joseph Harp Correctional Center.

"Kojack is up there in that tower right now, listening," said Mr. James, looking up. "He's got a rifle too. He wants me dead."

Kojack isn't "Kojak" of the famous TV series. Mr. James, 59 years old, who is bipolar, paranoid and schizophrenic, believes that a medical aide called Kojack -- spelled with a "c," he insists -- has been stalking him for decades and has implanted a listening device in his prostate.

The most unstable inmates "are housed in "Fantasy Island," the nickname for the acute-care unit. Surrounded by a 12-foot fence, it's a prison within a prison for 108. The walls, made of unbreakable glass, allow staff to see most of the unit at a glance. There is a four-point restraint table where uncontrollable inmates can be tied down until they're calm.

With temperatures in the teens one day earlier this year, few inmates ventured outside. Many milled around a recreation area in the zombie-like gait of the heavily medicated. Others, visibly agitated, paced back and forth and stared through the glass.

Those considered too unpredictable and uncontrollable ever to be free are locked behind thick doors with small windows. Screams, moans and chanting are normal. The noise level rises as the sun goes down and before the medication kicks in. One inmate believes he is in a prisoner of war camp in Vietnam while another screams that communists are taking over the facility. He believes two of the officers on the unit are Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel Castro.

A couple of years ago, one resident of the acute-care unit sculpted figurines out of his feces. Another feigned a catatonic episode and nearly bit off the tip of an officer's nose. Earlier this year, officers had to forcibly remove and shower an inmate who refused to clean himself.

A prisoner named Michael Bruton imagines he is a gunfighter. "With knees bent and hands hovering over a make-believe holster on his hips, Mr. Bruton stares at his adversary, usually one of the guards. Then, as prison officials describe it, he laughs hysterically before sobbing uncontrollably."

Maurice Smith refuses to take his medication because a genie in his rectum told him he doesn't need it. Having served his time--killed his number, as they say-- Mr. Smith refuses be under court supervision. "I won't have to take any drug tests," he says. Asked why that's important, he answers bluntly: "Because I want to do drugs. I like crack and marijuana and drinking."

The inimitable Samuel Johnson once observed: "If a man were sitting at this table, and chopping off his fingers, the magistrate, as guardian of the community, has no authority to restrain him, however he might do it from kindness as a parent.--Though, indeed, upon more consideration, I think he may: as it is probable, that he who is chopping off his own fingers, may soon proceed to chop off those of other people."

I would bring that thought up to date:

If a man were sitting at this table, and [said he had a genie in his rectum] [said he had a listening device implanted in his prostate] [was sculpting figurines out of feces], the magistrate, as guardian of the community, has no authority to restrain him, however he might do it from kindness as a parent.--Though, indeed, upon more consideration, I think he may: as it is probable, that he who believes he has a genie implanted in his rectum, may soon proceed to try to implant genies in other people's rectums."

*Eerie Dylan lyric coincidence alert: "Hear ya got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names/Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed/He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine"
