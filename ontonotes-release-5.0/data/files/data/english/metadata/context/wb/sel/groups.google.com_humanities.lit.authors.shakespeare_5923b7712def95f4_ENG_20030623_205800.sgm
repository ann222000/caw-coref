Bate on Wood

After finally getting a copy of the review of Wood's Stratford man
biography that appeared in the Telegraph (June 8th), it was intriguing to learn
that the reviewer was Jonathan Bate. I still have not seen the book review
that appeared the same in the Sunday Times.

The first of the four part film that Wood produced airs on BBC2 on
June 28 and the following three Saturdays. His book is due out in America in
October, a strong sign that the film will air on PBS at the same time.

Um, Buckeye Pete? I posted both of those reviews on this newsgroup
a few hours after you posted your request for them. I was
wondering why you didn't post to say &quot;thanks&quot; or anything, and
I guess it's because you didn't see them, for whatever reason.
Did my post not appear on your server, or did you just not pay attention?
I don't feel like posting a Google link to my post, but I'm sure
somebody else will do it if you ask nice.

I plonked Art seems like years ago. At this rate, it'll be another decade or
so before he comes up with anything else worth reading, so I feel vindicated
in my good judgment.

Based upon the acumen he has exhibited here, I'm not persuaded that
PWDBard will have any better luck clicking upon a Google link than he
has had in locating the review himself (and no doubt the Stratford Trust
will block my post from PWDBard's computer in any case). However, in a
spirit of charity, here is the Google link to Dave Kathman's post of the
reviews:

&lt;&gt;

Hint to Buckeye Pete: the reviews do not appear upon the first screen in
Dave's post; you'll need to get someone to show you how to use the
scroll bar.

You don't know what you're missing, Tom. Admittedly, much of Art's
trolling is repetitive lunatic logorrhea, but every now and then Art
comes up with some real gems. Did you see the one in which he opined
that Virgil predated Herodotus? Did you know that Art thinks that Anne
Hathaway was Shakespeare's mother?

Granted, Art cannot compete with Elizabeth Weird for pure invention,
nor with &quot;Dr.&quot; Faker for manic exhibitionism and all-raound crankery,
but his impersonation of a clueless cretin is very deftly executed and
often quite convincing.
