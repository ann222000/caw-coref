It is the death of history
Special investigation by Robert Fisk

The Independent
Published: 17 September 2007

2,000-year-old Sumerian cities torn apart and plundered by robbers. The very
walls of the mighty Ur of the Chaldees cracking under the strain of massive
troop movements, the privatisation of looting as landlords buy up the
remaining sites of ancient Mesopotamia to strip them of their artefacts and
wealth. The near total destruction of Iraq's historic past ­ the very cradle
of human civilisation ­ has emerged as one of the most shameful symbols of
our disastrous occupation.

Evidence amassed by archaeologists shows that even those Iraqis who trained
as archaeological workers in Saddam Hussein's regime are now using their
knowledge to join the looters in digging through the ancient cities,
destroying thousands of priceless jars, bottles and other artefacts in their
search for gold and other treasures.

In the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, armies of looters moved in on the
desert cities of southern Iraq and at least 13 Iraqi museums were plundered.
Today, almost every archaeological site in southern Iraq is under the
control of looters.

In a long and devastating appraisal to be published in December, Lebanese
archaeologist Joanne Farchakh says that armies of looters have not spared
&quot;one metre of these Sumerian capitals that have been buried under the sand
for thousands of years.

&quot;They systematically destroyed the remains of this civilisation in their
tireless search for sellable artefacts: ancient cities, covering an
estimated surface area of 20 square kilometres, which ­ if properly
excavated ­ could have provided extensive new information concerning the
development of the human race.

&quot;Humankind is losing its past for a cuneiform tablet or a sculpture or piece
of jewellery that the dealer buys and pays for in cash in a country
devastated by war. Humankind is losing its history for the pleasure of
private collectors living safely in their luxurious houses and ordering
specific objects for their collection.&quot;

Ms Farchakh, who helped with the original investigation into stolen
treasures from the Baghdad Archaeological Museum in the immediate aftermath
of the invasion of Iraq, says Iraq may soon end up with no history.

&quot;There are 10,000 archaeological sites in the country. In the Nassariyah
area alone, there are about 840 Sumerian sites; they have all been
systematically looted. Even when Alexander the Great destroyed a city, he
would always build another. But now the robbers are destroying everything
because they are going down to bedrock. What's new is that the looters are
becoming more and more organised with, apparently, lots of money.

&quot;Quite apart from this, military operations are damaging these sites
forever. There's been a US base in Ur for five years and the walls are
cracking because of the weight of military vehicles. It's like putting an
archaeological site under a continuous earthquake.&quot;

Of all the ancient cities of present-day Iraq, Ur is regarded as the most
important in the history of man-kind. Mentioned in the Old Testament ­ and
believed by many to be the home of the Prophet Abraham ­ it also features in
the works of Arab historians and geographers where its name is Qamirnah, The
City of the Moon.

Founded in about 4,000 BC, its Sumerian people established the principles of
irrigation, developed agriculture and metal-working. Fifteen hundred years
later ­ in what has become known as &quot;the age of the deluge&quot; ­ Ur produced
some of the first examples of writing, seal inscriptions and construction.
In neighbouring Larsa, baked clay bricks were used as money orders ­ the
world's first cheques ­ the depth of finger indentations in the clay marking
the amount of money to be transferred. The royal tombs of Ur contained
jewellery, daggers, gold, azurite cylindrical seals and sometimes the
remains of slaves.

US officers have repeatedly said a large American base built at Babylon was
to protect the site but Iraqi archaeologist Zainab Bah-rani, a professor of
art history and archaeology at Columbia University, says this &quot;beggars
belief&quot;. In an analysis of the city, she says: &quot;The damage done to Babylon
is both extensive and irreparable, and even if US forces had wanted to
protect it, placing guards round the site would have been far more sensible
than bulldozing it and setting up the largest coalition military
headquarters in the region.&quot;

Air strikes in 2003 left historical monuments undamaged, but Professor
Bahrani, says: &quot;The occupation has resulted in a tremendous destruction of
history well beyond the museums and libraries looted and destroyed at the
fall of Baghdad. At least seven historical sites have been used in this way
by US and coalition forces since April 2003, one of them being the
historical heart of Samarra, where the Askari shrine built by Nasr al Din
Shah was bombed in 2006.&quot;

The use of heritage sites as military bases is a breach of the Hague
Convention and Protocol of 1954 (chapter 1, article 5) which covers periods
of occupation; although the US did not ratify the Convention, Italy, Poland,
Australia and Holland, all of whom sent forces to Iraq, are contracting
parties.

Ms Farchakh notes that as religious parties gain influence in all the Iraqi
pro-vinces, archaeological sites are also falling under their control. She
tells of Abdulamir Hamdani, the director of antiquities for Di Qar province
in the south who desperately ­ but vainly ­ tried to prevent the destruction
of the buried cities during the occupation. Dr Hamdani himself wrote that he
can do little to prevent &quot;the disaster we are all witnessing and observing&quot;.

In 2006, he says: &quot;We recruited 200 police officers because we were trying
to stop the looting by patrolling the sites as often as possible. Our
equipment was not enough for this mission because we only had eight cars,
some guns and other weapons and a few radio transmitters for the entire
province where 800 archaeological sites have been inventoried.

&quot;Of course, this is not enough but we were trying to establish some order
until money restrictions within the government meant that we could no longer
pay for the fuel to patrol the sites. So we ended up in our offices trying
to fight the looting, but that was also before the religious parties took
over southern Iraq.&quot;

Last year, Dr Hamdani's antiquities department received notice from the
local authorities, approving the creation of mud-brick factories in areas
surrounding Sumerian archaeological sites. But it quickly became apparent
that the factory owners intended to buy the land from the Iraqi government
because it covered several Sumerian capitals and other archaeological sites.
The new landlord would &quot;dig&quot; the archaeological site, dissolve the &quot;old mud
brick&quot; to form the new one for the market and sell the unearthed finds to
antiquity traders.

Dr Hamdani bravely refused to sign the dossier. Ms Farchakh says: &quot;His
rejection had rapid consequences. The religious parties controlling
Nassariyah sent the police to see him with orders to jail him on corruption
charges. He was imprisoned for three months, awaiting trial. The State Board
of Antiquities and Heritage defended him during his trial, as did his
powerful tribe. He was released and regained his position. The mud-brick
factories are 'frozen projects', but reports have surfaced of a similar
strategy being employed in other cities and in nearby archaeological sites
such as the Aqarakouf Ziggarat near Baghdad. For how long can Iraqi
archaeologists maintain order? This is a question only Iraqi politicians
affiliated to the different religious parties can answer, since they approve
these projects.&quot;

Police efforts to break the power of the looters, now with a well-organised
support structure helped by tribal leaders, have proved lethal. In 2005, the
Iraqi customs arrested ­ with the help of Western troops ­ several
antiquities dealers in the town of Al Fajr, near Nasseriyah. They seized
hundreds of artefacts and decided to take them to the museum in Baghdad. It
was a fatal mistake.

The convoy was stopped a few miles from Baghdad, eight of the customs agents
were murdered, and their bodies burnt and left to rot in the desert. The
artefacts disappeared. &quot;It was a clear message from the antiquities dealers
to the world,&quot; Ms Farchakh says.

The legions of antiquities looters work within a smooth mass-smuggling
organisation. Trucks, cars, planes and boats take Iraq's historical plunder
to Europe, the US, to the United Arab Emirates and to Japan. The
archaeologists say an ever-growing number of internet websites offer
Mesopotamian artefacts, objects anywhere up to 7,000 years old.

The farmers of southern Iraq are now professional looters, knowing how to
outline the walls of buried buildings and able to break directly into rooms
and tombs. The archaeologists' report says: &quot;They have been trained in how
to rob the world of its past and they have been making significant profit
from it. They know the value of each object and it is difficult to see why
they would stop looting.&quot;

After the 1991 Gulf War, archaeologists hired the previous looters as
workers and promised them government salaries. This system worked as long as
the archaeologists remained on the sites, but it was one of the main reasons
for the later destruction; people now knew how to excavate and what they
could find.

Ms Farchakh adds: &quot;The longer Iraq finds itself in a state of war, the more
the cradle of civilisation is threatened. It may not even last for our
grandchildren to learn from.&quot;

A land with fields of ancient pottery

By Joanne Farchakh, archaeologist

Iraq's rural societies are very different to our own. Their concept of
ancient civilisations and heritage does not match the standards set by our
own scholars. History is limited to the stories and glories of your direct
ancestors and your tribe. So for them, the &quot;cradle of civilisation&quot; is
nothing more than desert land with &quot;fields&quot; of pottery that they have the
right to take advantage of because, after all, they are the lords of the
land and, as a result, the owners of its possessions. In the same way, if
they had been able, these people would not have hesitated to take control of
the oil fields, because this is &quot;their land&quot;. Because life in the desert is
hard and because they have been &quot;forgotten&quot; by all the governments, their
&quot;revenge&quot; for this reality is to monitor, and take, every single
money-making opportunity. A cylinder seal, a sculpture or a cuneiform tablet
earns $50 (£25) and that's half the monthly salary of an average government
employee in Iraq. The looters have been told by the traders that if an
object is worth anything at all, it must have an inscription on it. In Iraq,
the farmers consider their &quot;looting&quot; activities to be part of a normal
working day.
