It's funny how the Xbots tried to compare it to Gears of War... COD4..
then Crysis.. then they gave up and are now trying to compare it with
CG.

Come on guys, you got pwned BIG TIME!!! So much so that only a handful
of internet retards are even trying to downplay this thing.

LOL, have fun living another generation as a blind fanboy.

I think it's funny how you continually talk up games that aren't out
then when they do come out and inevitably suck and you get your ass
handed to you, you just move on to the next game that's not out yet.

Remember Black? How about Soul Calibur III? Then Resistance Fall of
Man and now Killzone 2.

Your slavish devotion to non-existent product is almost sad. Meantime
the rest of us are playing games that are out now.

To be completely honest, KillZone 2 looked fairly standard to me. I don't

It's par for you to answer non-sequitur when Jordan made the comment on the
history of your loved game claims. You avoided what he pointed out; maybe
you can try to redeem yourself with an answer in kind, somehow I doubt
anything other than diatribes from you.

Except that you're forgetting one thing. Killzone on the PS2 was just
another generic shooter and far from anything special.  I saw nothing in
that trailer that changes that.  COD4, although it will eventually show up
on the PS3 and it probably won't be near as good considering Infinity Ward
has been working on the 360 for nearly 3 years now, crushes Killzone 2, GOW,
Halo 3, most likely Crysis and nearly any other shooter on the consoles
today.

Bottom line is I don't know what your insecure troll ass what looking at but
Killzone, in it's current form, isn't &quot;anything&quot; special.  There will be far
better shooters on the PS3. Killzone is going to suffer from what so many
other hyped games do, it more then likely will fall way short and not live
up to expectations.  BTW although the press was &quot;inpressed&quot; with Killzone 2,
I didn't see it.  COD4, Bioshock and GOW, IMHO still look better.

Than again Killzone 2 is still a in it's pre-pre alpha stage.

If from the in game video of COD4 that I saw is an indicator, it should look
better GOW, I don't know if &quot;crushes&quot; can be applied though. I cannot say
about Halo3 since it isn't out yet, and no one has seen the actual gameplay
of the campaign mode (not the MP). I seriously doubt that it would look
better than Crysis since it isn't out yet and that is a PC game right, or is
there a 360 version coming around?

If you go on youtube, you can see some fairly good quality videos of Crysis
in game action, it is simply amazing. I am seriously thinking of getting a
new high PC just for that game, my current PC, though still powerful is well
over 3 years old.

When I say crushes I don't mean the graphics alone. I am referring to the
total package.
Halo 3 is pretty, and I love the vibrant colors, but there isn't a whole lot
new about the game that will make it that much different then the one before
it. Crysis was spawned from a generic shooter that was nothing special other
then it's graphic engine. Crysis doesn't look to disappoint the graphics
whore in us all but I can almost guarantee it won't be setting the gaming
world a blaze with a all new gameplay engine.  Crysis is one of those games
that people will use to test the power of the specs in their PC and most
likely it won't be good for anything else.

COD4 has the best graphics (all overall) with the most amazing lighting
effects I have ever seen in a video game.  Infinity Ward has created  a
brand new lighting engine just for this game.  Not to mention they have
practically revamped the gameplay engine from the ground up. This is going
to be one of the deepest most innovative FPS engine to come along in years.
So when I use the term &quot;crushes&quot; it's because it's the most complete game
coming out this year (graphics, sound, gameplay, single player and
multiplayer- DEPTH).

If I was to build a PC it wouldn't be for Crysis.  I would probably do it
for COD4, BattleField, Gears of War, UT3, Quake Wars, etc...  Games that are

Ok now that I have just read up on Crysis, and actually saw it in action,
all I can say is wow.  I already knew it was going to be the new level,
others will only hope to achieve for as far as graphics go, but I didn't
think it was going to play as well as what I witnessed.  It's a very fast
action intense game with &quot;decent&quot; AI.  I love the speed of the game.  The
jumping is a bit exaggerated, Halo is worse, but I can over look that to
give this game I try. I am this &gt;&lt; to building a high end PC myself to play
the newer games coming out this year.

Although I still didn't see anything that would want me make COD4 any less
or change my opinion of what I said previously. I think COD4 will set the
new standard of what people will want out of their FPS games. I don't see a
shooter out or upcoming that is the total package like COD4 looks to be.
Everyone that played it at E3 was simply blown away. I can only imagine how
the next COD will look and run on a PC if Infinity Ward is behind it.

The jumping in Crysis (as well as punching/hitting) is intentionally
exaggerated, it is part of the power of the suit the player has in the game,
kinda like what Snake uses in MGS. I don't see anything else, other than
better graphics, coming to Halo 3 also. But, I love the game for its story,
which IMO, is the best of any game I have ever played form its inception.
That is something GOW failed on big time. I am almost NOT interested in
getting the next GOW, unless the MP allows more players, the game has a
better array of weapons, and the enemy AI  better with the enemy appearance
points changing to being random.

I haven't seen anything about COD4 that makes it more immersive, or what
makes it set apart from its previous predecessors in gameplay, it is a FPS.
Do you know what it actually offers other than before? I will get the game,
because admittedly, I am a graphics whore, but I can be let down greatly (as
I was with GOW), if the story, gameplay, and AI suck. I think the most
immersive game that was a FPS and stealthy was the first Ghost Recon (though
the AI was not that great), in that you could control separate squads, and
change player views to the areas from another perspective. It would be cool
if the COD4 does some stealth stuff, and allows coop play.

Did anyone claim that Killzone 2 wasn't going to come out? What people
actually predicted did come true... the game is out and it's nowhere
near as good as the target video Sony released way back when.

Hell, it doesn't even look as good as Gears of War, let alone Call of
Duty 4.

">

I haven't been able to read anything regarding what the game entails as far
as gameplay in COD4, but I am sure it will be pretty damn good. After
watching the actual in game video a few times, I noticed, though the
graphics are sweet, there isn't much color. The HD scene called the
&quot;Microsoft Conference Walkthough&quot; here
http://media.xbox360.ign.com/media/902/902590/vids_1.html
looks real cooll, and there is another short HD video showing actual gamplay
in the single player mode.

Now while COD4 looks great in the newer vids, I noticed that there aren't
many colors which will help with sharper graphics, as it is easier to shade
everyhting in the enviroment, making it less taxing on the system. If you
look at both videos, the colors are in the blue/green spectrums, and the one
(Microsoft Conference Walkthough) looks mostly all gray, though the scene
(with the snipers) there clearly looks like the late fall as far as the time
of the season goes.

That being said, GOW, though really good on graphics, had that greenish gray
look on everything in the game, and not many colors. Now I am not a color
whore, but most know that you can make great graphics on a console by being
less colorful. In the real world, even in the late fall, you're going to see
colors. If the gameplay in COD4 is really good, I can tolerate this,
something I didn't in GOW (worst AI in a AAA game I ever saw). Even the pine
trees in the COD4 vid, barely has any green to them (are they evergray
trees?).

Read what Jordan said- he said referred to Resistance as one of the
games that &quot;inevitably suck&quot;.  Groundbreaking it may not be, but the
reviews don't indicate it &quot;sucks&quot;.  For that matter, the average score
for Soul Calibur 3 was 86- hardly a below average score.  (Oddly
enough, one of Jordan's favorite games, Enclave, had an average
Metacritic score of 66.)

The point is that using the same general brand of &quot;your system/games

exactly helpful- in fact, it's exactly what that troll wants and lives

There is nothing to fuss about.... The game looks very good, but not
revolutionary. We'll still be waiting for the magical PS3 game that
truely sits it apart from the 360. The thing PS3 loyalist won't like
to hear is that that game will most likely never come. Technically if
the PS3 is capable more it's not in the current iteration of
development API's. Sony could change that in the future, but until
they do such a game is probably 12-24 moths away (typically dev time

I admit, &quot;inevitably suck&quot; may have been unwarranted hyperbole on my
part, but those games are certainly nothing what Mr. Impressive made
them out to be. Particularly when he outright lied about Soul Calibur
III having 7.1 audio in game.

As for Enclave, I still maintain it was unfairly slagged by reviewers.
You can see that with the stellar reviews given to Chronicles of
Riddick. Another FPS game by the same developer using the same engine.
People who actually played Enclave rate it very highly. Here's hoping
it pops up on the BCL some day.

Actually, it had to have been a different engine.  Riddick uses normal
