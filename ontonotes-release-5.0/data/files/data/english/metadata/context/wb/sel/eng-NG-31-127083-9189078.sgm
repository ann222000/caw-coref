Rosie, perhaps the best tip I can offer to pay back all the great
inspiration you gave me is, and get ready for this.... ginger snaps!
Yes, the little round cookies. For that matter, anything with ginger,
either fresh, dried, in candy or soft drinks (ginger ale)  will stop
motion sickness even after it begins, which Dramamine, dyphenhydromine,
or Scopalemine will not do. Take along a box of ginger snaps... just
in case. My mother is now eating them by the boxful to counter the
nausea from Chemotherapy. Her doctor is gob-smacked! He'd never heard of
this before, but it's common among scuba divers. I can't suggest where
to go or what lines to ride, but I can make the trip a smooth one if
problems arise. A box of ginger snaps can save the trip!

Probably not at all what you have in mind but I thoroughly enjoyed a
10 day cruise on the Delta Queen steamboat down the Ohio and up the
Mississippi.  This was something I did with my mother in the late 60s.
There are now two modern boats owned by the same company - The
Mississippi Queen and, um, I can't remember the name of the other one.

There are many different routes that the boats take.  Some of the
trips are to New Orleans, some to Tennessee.  Also, the number of days
varies.
It was great.  I'd love to do it again.

Is your point of departure a major concern? You're going to have to travel
somewhere in order to board the ship, yes? If you want a truly memorable,
romantic, first-class time-- and that includes NOT being up to your ass in
frenzied tourists at every moment, aboard some garish, floating city where
they feed you industrial-type buffet chow-- I'd heartily recommend the
WINDSTAR line. They go... everywhere. Asia, Europe, the South Pacific, the
Caribbean....

I hate flying. Every time we try to plan a vacation, it's a trade-off
between the amount of time available to actually have fun and the amount of
time spent merely traveling to wherever we think the fun *is*. Friends
recommended a cruise, and we looked into it by going to Cruise Directors, a
travel outfit in our city that specializes only in ocean cruises. You may
have something similar where you are.

They asked us a lot of questions about what we enjoyed and what we didn't
enjoy; what was important to us in a vacation and what we just didn't care
about. High on our list were: Being left alone, unless we *wanted* to do
something; being extremely well-fed; seeing new and interesting locales; a
lack of structure; not being herded about in huge crowds, and so forth and
so on. As we rattled off these ideas, 2 travel agents at adjacent desks each
said--in unison-- &quot;You want WINDSTAR!&quot;

Windstar uses computer-assisted, power sailing yachts. There are powerful
engines, and full sails that are unfurled to take advantage of the winds.
Their size is very small, compared to the mega-liners used by Carnival or
other cruise lines. Capacity is only 148 passengers on their smaller ship to
300 some-odd, on the largest of their vessels-- versus the couple of
thousand you'll find on the other ships. This enables them to use the more
shallow-draft harbors, so they don't have to dock where all the other ships
do.

We opted for a week-long Leeward Islands cruise (the Caribbean, from
Barbados to St. Bart's, St. John, Isle de Saint, St. Lucia, St. Martin and
back to Barbados. We flew to Miami, and from Miami to Barbados to board the
ship. They had a welcoming party for the guests, and our ship, the Wind
Spirit, was docked at right angles to the sister ship, the Wind Surf. As
they sounded the signal to get underway, everyone on both ships rushed to
the railings, waving and whistling and cheering. I heard this loud voice
across the way bellow out: &quot;PARDON ME! DO YOU HAVE ANY GREY POUPON?&quot; It
inspired gales of laughter...

The benefits we found were these: EVERYTHING was included in the price.
Transportation, food, and lodging. The only extra fee was charged for any
liquor you wanted, or for any optional shore excursion. Helicopter ride
above a volcano,  tour of the Governor's mansion, etc. etc... was an extra
charge, payable upon signing up for it.

There was no pressure on us to do a damned thing. We could sit in our cabin
all week if we wanted. They offered a series of very interesting shore
excursions-- day trips-- if you wanted to participate in any of them. We
opted to go on the Rain Forest Hike, which was great fun. There was no
rigidly structured time or assigned seating for dinner. We sat by ourselves,
next to a port-side window, and watched the sunset as we ate. Very romantic
and private.The food was absolutely superb-- and I know good food, lemme
tellya...

Every day, we'd see the chef and his assistants motoring ashore in one of
the little Zodiac launches. They'd return a few hours later loaded down with
all sorts of fresh, locally-procured fruits and vegetables and freshly
caught fish.
We ate like royalty-- and were NOT subjected to institutional cooking:
bland, tourist-palate geared, steam-table crap and ho-hum shrimp cocktail
arranged to resemble the Empire State building. Breakfast was an event, with
all sorts of *fresh* baked goods-- muffins, scones, croissants (not crap
from a box)-- fresh fruits and juices, Normandy Butter, British fruit
preserves, kippers for the British crew, a host of egg dishes and pancakes,
French Toast, waffles, etc., etc... and always a daily breakfast special of
some kind. Eat as little or as much as you want.

Lunchtime we always spent ashore, trying out local cuisine at the most
out-of-the-way places we could find. We saw our (live) red snapper being
gutted and filleted, dockside, one afternoon, prior to being grilled for
us...

The ship was small enough so we never got lost or disoriented making our way
around-- and big enough that you could almost always find a quiet spot.
There was a library; they loaned videotapes for you to watch; there was a
small lounge with music and dancing in the evenings. Even a mini casino, if
you were so inclined.You were free to visit the Bridge-- and we did, making
friends with the young British officer who was on duty every evening after
dinner.

Every day the ship would dock at a new port. The night before, they'd slip a
sheet of paper under your door listing significant facts, history,
attractions etc... about the new locale. They'd tell you when we'd be
putting into port and when we'd be leaving, and offer a few ideas for your
ashore time-- as well as some events they planned, themselves.

We had one riotous, gigantic, king-hell of a barbecue on St. Bart's, after
we'd finished our rain forest hike. We were driven out of the foothills and
right down to the beach in Land Rovers, where the chef and his boys had
pitched these enormous tents and were grilling fish, sausages, chicken-- and
more lobster than I'd ever seen in one place in my entire life. I lay in the
sand, butter dribbling down my chin, wondering if it was  possible to O.D.
on lobster tails...

Well, the point is, it was absolutely incredible. A truly memorable
experience. We were relaxed, pampered, fawned over, coddled and treated like
celebrities all week long-- and never in any smarmy, intrusive way. Like any
cruise line, tipping is optional-- but generally expected. You tip your
waiter and your room steward (who have busted their asses to ensure you've
had a smooth and pleasant time) 4 or 5 bucks per person per day-- and slip
it to them in an envelope just before disembarking.

A few years later, we had some time off and decided to do it again. Windstar
didn't have anything going where we wanted to go during the week available
to us, and we booked a Carnival cruise. Big fucking mistake!!! Crapola of
the highest sort. Lowest-common-denominator cruising, with frenzied,
mandatory &quot;FUN&quot; hurled at you every waking moment. This is cruising for Mr.
and Mrs. Middle America whose standards aren't too high and whose palates
are accustomed to Hungry Man dinners,Twinkies and Hot Pockets. Or for
college kids whose world view isn't yet very wide. It was garish and crowded
and lackluster and cheesy and pretty much the exact opposite of the fabulous
experience we'd had with WINDSTAR. Read about it here:
http://www.quitbuddies.org/Cruise.html
(The description is only *slightly* exaggerated for comic effect, I assure
you...)

Check out WINDSTAR at: http://www.windstarcruises.com/cruises-home.asp Once
you've sailed with them, you're a member of their Foremast Club, and your
next cruises are at half price...!

If this trip is something you really want to be special, don't succumb to
CARNIVAL or the cheesy, cattle-drive style cruise lines. You'll regret not
opting for the best possible time you could hope to have, afloat.

Good luck. Bring me back a seashell, will ya?

Rosie, Patty and I have only taken one cruise, two years ago we sailed on
the Jewel Of The Seas, owned by Royal Caribbean ( www.royalcaribbean.com )  We
did an eight-night Eastern Caribbean cruise out of Fort Lauderdale, with
ports of call in Nassau, Bahamas, San Juan, St Maarten and St Thomas.  We
had a blast!  Patty is susceptible to sea sickness but she was fine even
without taking any medication.  We sailed in April when the Caribbean seas
are quieter (I don't recommend sailing in that area between August and
October).

For another site where you can check out what people say about various
cruise companies, check out. www.cruisecritic.com .  We found a ton of
valuable information about our ship, cruise line and destinations before we
left.

Being on a ship the size we were on (the Jewel of the Sea is a 90,000 ton
ship with a capacity of 2,500 passengers) was *weird*. It was like a
floating town.  Much to do on-board to occupy our time and tons of
activities wherever we landed.  Again, we had a great time.  (But, it's not
Hawaii...heh heh)

We were only slightly bothered at times by second-hand smoke; the people in
the room below us were smokers.  Not sure what ships or cruise lines are
available which are 100% smokefree.  Overall, it wasn't a big deal to us.
RCI's smoking policy effective the start of next year is fairly restrictive.
No smoking in the rooms, corridors, dining areas, theaters, etc. Outside,
smoking is allowed only on the Starboard side of the ship.

Oh, one more thing; get a room with a balcony!  True, they're more expensive
than those with only a window or inner rooms, but it was wonderful to have
our own private outside area to sit during the day or at night and watch the
ocean, sunrise, sunset, etc.

What a lovely idea Rosie :-)
Wish I could give you some tips (never been on a cruise-definitely on my
to-do list)
But had to share, with you, this email I had the other day:

About 2 years ago my wife and I were on a cruise through the western
Mediterranean aboard a Princess liner. At dinner we noticed an elderly lady
sitting alone along the rail of the grand stairway in the main dining room.
I also noticed that all the staff, ships officers, waiters, busboys, etc.,
all seemed very familiar with this lady.  I asked our waiter who the lady
was, expecting to be told that she owned the line, but he said he only knew
that she had been on board for the last four cruises, back-to-back.

As we left the dining room one evening I caught her eye and stopped
to say hello. We chatted and I said, &quot;I understand you've been on this ship
for the last four cruises&quot;. She replied, &quot;Yes, that's true.&quot; I stated, &quot;I
don't understand&quot; and she replied, without a pause, &quot;It's cheaper than a
nursing home&quot;.

So, there will be no nursing home in my future. When I get old and
feeble, I am going to get on a Princess Cruise Ship. The average cost for a
nursing home is $200 per day. I have checked on reservations on a Princess
and I can get a long term discount and senior discount price of $135 per
day. That leaves $65 a day for:

1. Gratuities which will only be $10 per day.

2. I will have as many as 10 meals a day if I can waddle to the
restaurant, or I can have room service (which means I can have
breakfast-in-bed every day of the week).

3. Princess has as many as three swimming pools, a workout room,
free washers and dryers, and shows every night.

4. They have free toothpaste and razors, and free soap and shampoo.

5. They will even treat you like a customer, not a patient. An extra
$5 worth of tips will have the entire staff scrambling to help you.

6. I will get to meet new people every 7 or 14 days.

7. T.V. broken? Light bulb need changing? Need to have the mattress
replaced? No Problem! They will fix everything and apologize for your
inconvenience.

8. Clean sheets and towels every day, and you don't even have to ask
for them.

9. If you fall in the nursing home and break a hip you are on
Medicare; if you fall and break a hip on the Princess ship they will upgrade
you to a suite for the rest of your life.

Now hold on for the best! Do you want to see South America, the
Panama Canal, Tahiti, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, or name where you want
to go?

Princess will have a ship ready to go. So don't look for me in a
nursing home, just call shore to ship.

PS: And don't forget, when you die, they just dump you over the
side -- at no charge

Quite like this thought;&gt;)

Enjoy your break

I've been on only one cruise and that was many years ago.  I was young
and single and cruised with two girlfriends.  It was one of the best
vacations I've ever had, we spent our days and nights.... well, let's
leave it at having fun.  :-)

What I enjoyed the most about the trip (7 days in the Caribbean) was
being completely cut off from the &quot;real world.&quot;  This was LONG before
the internet and cell phones.  I don't know if that kind of isolation
is possible anymore, but it was absolute heaven to me then.  And it
was certainly &quot;what happens on this ship stays on this ship.&quot;

After reading about Jef.'s Windstar experience I can't imagine any
other kind of cruise.

Whatever you choose I hope it's everything you want it to be, and I
will be looking forward to hearing about your plans and experiences!

Rosie - I've only taken one cruise, Norwegian Wind about 6 years ago.
We left from Miami and sailed the Carribean with 4 or 5 stops for 7
days. It was terrific. Food abounds, but drinks were pretty expensive
then. If you could get an &quot;all inclusive&quot;, it would be worth it. I've
heard that now the cruises offer that, but if you don't drink you
probably don't care.

Ah, the food!  That was one of my favorite parts of the cruise.  You could
go to the buffet and pig out as much as you wanted...no extra charge.  They
also had a late-night diner, sort of like a 50's-style burger place which
had all kinds of munchies in case you got hungry at 10 p.m.

Dunno what the alcoholic drinks cost because we don't drink, but we bought a
&quot;soda stamp&quot; which they put on our Sea Pass and let us have all the soft
drinks and water we wanted.  I think it was around $6/day.  So that was
nice.

Man, the food :)

&gt; inspiration you gave me is, and get ready for this.... ginger snaps! Yes,
&gt; the little round cookies. For that matter, anything with ginger, either
&gt; fresh, dried, in candy or soft drinks (ginger ale)  will stop motion
&gt; sickness even after it begins, which Dramamine, dyphenhydromine, or
&gt; Scopalemine will not do. Take along a box of ginger snaps... just in case.
&gt; My mother is now eating them by the boxful to counter the nausea from
&gt; Chemotherapy. Her doctor is gob-smacked! He'd never heard of this before,
&gt; but it's common among scuba divers. I can't suggest where to go or what
&gt; lines to ride, but I can make the trip a smooth one if problems arise. A
&gt; box of ginger snaps can save the trip!

&gt;&gt; tom and i are thinking about taking a cruise (7-10 days), which  we have
&gt;&gt; never done.
&gt;&gt; how about starting a list of recommendations and tips?
&gt;&gt; where did you go? what ship did you use? etc etc etc

&gt; Is your point of departure a major concern? You're going to have to travel
&gt; somewhere in order to board the ship, yes? If you want a truly memorable,
&gt; romantic, first-class time-- and that includes NOT being up to your ass in
&gt; frenzied tourists at every moment, aboard some garish, floating city where
&gt; they feed you industrial-type buffet chow-- I'd heartily recommend the
&gt; WINDSTAR line. They go... everywhere. Asia, Europe, the South Pacific, the
&gt; Caribbean....

&gt; I hate flying. Every time we try to plan a vacation, it's a trade-off
&gt; between the amount of time available to actually have fun and the amount
&gt; of time spent merely traveling to wherever we think the fun *is*. Friends
&gt; recommended a cruise, and we looked into it by going to Cruise Directors,
&gt; a travel outfit in our city that specializes only in ocean cruises. You
&gt; may have something similar where you are.

&gt; They asked us a lot of questions about what we enjoyed and what we didn't
&gt; enjoy; what was important to us in a vacation and what we just didn't care
&gt; about. High on our list were: Being left alone, unless we *wanted* to do
&gt; something; being extremely well-fed; seeing new and interesting locales; a
&gt; lack of structure; not being herded about in huge crowds, and so forth and
&gt; so on. As we rattled off these ideas, 2 travel agents at adjacent desks
&gt; each said--in unison-- &quot;You want WINDSTAR!&quot;

&gt; Windstar uses computer-assisted, power sailing yachts. There are powerful
&gt; engines, and full sails that are unfurled to take advantage of the winds.
&gt; Their size is very small, compared to the mega-liners used by Carnival or
&gt; other cruise lines. Capacity is only 148 passengers on their smaller ship
&gt; to 300 some-odd, on the largest of their vessels-- versus the couple of
&gt; thousand you'll find on the other ships. This enables them to use the more
&gt; shallow-draft harbors, so they don't have to dock where all the other
&gt; ships do.

&gt; We opted for a week-long Leeward Islands cruise (the Caribbean, from
&gt; Barbados to St. Bart's, St. John, Isle de Saint, St. Lucia, St. Martin and
&gt; back to Barbados. We flew to Miami, and from Miami to Barbados to board
&gt; the ship. They had a welcoming party for the guests, and our ship, the
&gt; Wind Spirit, was docked at right angles to the sister ship, the Wind Surf.
&gt; As they sounded the signal to get underway, everyone on both ships rushed
&gt; to the railings, waving and whistling and cheering. I heard this loud
&gt; voice across the way bellow out: &quot;PARDON ME! DO YOU HAVE ANY GREY POUPON?&quot;
&gt; It inspired gales of laughter...

&gt; The benefits we found were these: EVERYTHING was included in the price.
&gt; Transportation, food, and lodging. The only extra fee was charged for any
&gt; liquor you wanted, or for any optional shore excursion. Helicopter ride
&gt; above a volcano,  tour of the Governor's mansion, etc. etc... was an extra
&gt; charge, payable upon signing up for it.

&gt; There was no pressure on us to do a damned thing. We could sit in our
&gt; cabin all week if we wanted. They offered a series of very interesting
&gt; shore excursions-- day trips-- if you wanted to participate in any of
&gt; them. We opted to go on the Rain Forest Hike, which was great fun. There
&gt; was no rigidly structured time or assigned seating for dinner. We sat by
&gt; ourselves, next to a port-side window, and watched the sunset as we ate.
&gt; Very romantic and private.The food was absolutely superb-- and I know good
&gt; food, lemme tellya...

&gt; Every day, we'd see the chef and his assistants motoring ashore in one of
&gt; the little Zodiac launches. They'd return a few hours later loaded down
&gt; with all sorts of fresh, locally-procured fruits and vegetables and
&gt; freshly caught fish.
&gt; We ate like royalty-- and were NOT subjected to institutional cooking:
&gt; bland, tourist-palate geared, steam-table crap and ho-hum shrimp cocktail
&gt; arranged to resemble the Empire State building. Breakfast was an event,
&gt; with all sorts of *fresh* baked goods-- muffins, scones, croissants (not
&gt; crap from a box)-- fresh fruits and juices, Normandy Butter, British fruit
&gt; preserves, kippers for the British crew, a host of egg dishes and
&gt; pancakes, French Toast, waffles, etc., etc... and always a daily breakfast
&gt; special of some kind. Eat as little or as much as you want.

&gt; Lunchtime we always spent ashore, trying out local cuisine at the most
&gt; out-of-the-way places we could find. We saw our (live) red snapper being
&gt; gutted and filleted, dockside, one afternoon, prior to being grilled for
&gt; us...

&gt; The ship was small enough so we never got lost or disoriented making our
&gt; way around-- and big enough that you could almost always find a quiet
&gt; spot. There was a library; they loaned videotapes for you to watch; there
&gt; was a small lounge with music and dancing in the evenings. Even a mini
&gt; casino, if you were so inclined.You were free to visit the Bridge-- and we
&gt; did, making friends with the young British officer who was on duty every
&gt; evening after dinner.

&gt; Every day the ship would dock at a new port. The night before, they'd slip
&gt; a sheet of paper under your door listing significant facts, history,
&gt; attractions etc... about the new locale. They'd tell you when we'd be
&gt; putting into port and when we'd be leaving, and offer a few ideas for your
&gt; ashore time-- as well as some events they planned, themselves.

&gt; We had one riotous, gigantic, king-hell of a barbecue on St. Bart's, after
&gt; we'd finished our rain forest hike. We were driven out of the foothills
&gt; and right down to the beach in Land Rovers, where the chef and his boys
&gt; had pitched these enormous tents and were grilling fish, sausages,
&gt; chicken-- and more lobster than I'd ever seen in one place in my entire
&gt; life. I lay in the sand, butter dribbling down my chin, wondering if it
&gt; was  possible to O.D. on lobster tails...

&gt; Well, the point is, it was absolutely incredible. A truly memorable
&gt; experience. We were relaxed, pampered, fawned over, coddled and treated
&gt; like celebrities all week long-- and never in any smarmy, intrusive way.
&gt; Like any cruise line, tipping is optional-- but generally expected. You
&gt; tip your waiter and your room steward (who have busted their asses to
&gt; ensure you've had a smooth and pleasant time) 4 or 5 bucks per person per
&gt; day-- and slip it to them in an envelope just before disembarking.

&gt; A few years later, we had some time off and decided to do it again.
&gt; Windstar didn't have anything going where we wanted to go during the week
&gt; available to us, and we booked a Carnival cruise. Big fucking mistake!!!
&gt; Crapola of the highest sort. Lowest-common-denominator cruising, with
&gt; frenzied, mandatory &quot;FUN&quot; hurled at you every waking moment. This is
&gt; cruising for Mr. and Mrs. Middle America whose standards aren't too high
&gt; and whose palates are accustomed to Hungry Man dinners,Twinkies and Hot
&gt; Pockets. Or for college kids whose world view isn't yet very wide. It was
&gt; garish and crowded and lackluster and cheesy and pretty much the exact
&gt; opposite of the fabulous experience we'd had with WINDSTAR. Read about it
&gt; here: http://www.quitbuddies.org/Cruise.html
&gt; (The description is only *slightly* exaggerated for comic effect, I assure
&gt; you...)

&gt; Check out WINDSTAR at: http://www.windstarcruises.com/cruises-home.asp
&gt; Once you've sailed with them, you're a member of their Foremast Club, and
&gt; your next cruises are at half price...!

&gt; If this trip is something you really want to be special, don't succumb to
&gt; CARNIVAL or the cheesy, cattle-drive style cruise lines. You'll regret not
&gt; opting for the best possible time you could hope to have, afloat.

&gt; Good luck. Bring me back a seashell, will ya?

&gt; Rosie, Patty and I have only taken one cruise, two years ago we sailed on
&gt; the Jewel Of The Seas, owned by Royal Caribbean ( www.royalcaribbean.com )
&gt; We did an eight-night Eastern Caribbean cruise out of Fort Lauderdale,
&gt; with ports of call in Nassau, Bahamas, San Juan, St Maarten and St Thomas.
&gt; We had a blast!  Patty is susceptible to sea sickness but she was fine
&gt; even without taking any medication.  We sailed in April when the Caribbean
&gt; seas are quieter (I don't recommend sailing in that area between August
&gt; and October).

&gt; For another site where you can check out what people say about various
&gt; cruise companies, check out. www.cruisecritic.com .  We found a ton of
&gt; valuable information about our ship, cruise line and destinations before
&gt; we left.

&gt; Being on a ship the size we were on (the Jewel of the Sea is a 90,000 ton
&gt; ship with a capacity of 2,500 passengers) was *weird*. It was like a
&gt; floating town.  Much to do on-board to occupy our time and tons of
&gt; activities wherever we landed.  Again, we had a great time.  (But, it's
&gt; not Hawaii...heh heh)

&gt; We were only slightly bothered at times by second-hand smoke; the people
&gt; in the room below us were smokers.  Not sure what ships or cruise lines
&gt; are available which are 100% smokefree.  Overall, it wasn't a big deal to
&gt; us. RCI's smoking policy effective the start of next year is fairly
&gt; restrictive. No smoking in the rooms, corridors, dining areas, theaters,
&gt; etc. Outside, smoking is allowed only on the Starboard side of the ship.

&gt; Oh, one more thing; get a room with a balcony!  True, they're more
&gt; expensive than those with only a window or inner rooms, but it was
&gt; wonderful to have our own private outside area to sit during the day or at
&gt; night and watch the ocean, sunrise, sunset, etc.

&gt; Rosie - I've only taken one cruise, Norwegian Wind about 6 years ago.
&gt; We left from Miami and sailed the Carribean with 4 or 5 stops for 7
&gt; days. It was terrific. Food abounds, but drinks were pretty expensive
&gt; then. If you could get an &quot;all inclusive&quot;, it would be worth it. I've
&gt; heard that now the cruises offer that, but if you don't drink you
&gt; probably don't care.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;        About 2 years ago my wife and I were on a cruise through the
&gt; western Mediterranean aboard a Princess liner. At dinner we noticed an
&gt; elderly lady sitting alone along the rail of the grand stairway in the
&gt; main dining room. I also noticed that all the staff, ships officers,
&gt; waiters, busboys, etc., all seemed very familiar with this lady.  I asked
&gt; our waiter who the lady was, expecting to be told that she owned the line,
&gt; but he said he only knew that she had been on board for the last four
&gt; cruises, back-to-back.

&gt;        As we left the dining room one evening I caught her eye and stopped
&gt; to say hello. We chatted and I said, &quot;I understand you've been on this
&gt; ship for the last four cruises&quot;. She replied, &quot;Yes, that's true.&quot; I
&gt; stated, &quot;I don't understand&quot; and she replied, without a pause, &quot;It's
&gt; cheaper than a nursing home&quot;.

&gt;        So, there will be no nursing home in my future. When I get old and
&gt; feeble, I am going to get on a Princess Cruise Ship. The average cost for
&gt; a nursing home is $200 per day. I have checked on reservations on a
&gt; Princess and I can get a long term discount and senior discount price of
&gt; $135 per day. That leaves $65 a day for:

&gt;        1. Gratuities which will only be $10 per day.

&gt;        2. I will have as many as 10 meals a day if I can waddle to the
&gt; restaurant, or I can have room service (which means I can have
&gt; breakfast-in-bed every day of the week).

&gt;        3. Princess has as many as three swimming pools, a workout room,
&gt; free washers and dryers, and shows every night.

&gt;        4. They have free toothpaste and razors, and free soap and shampoo.

&gt;        5. They will even treat you like a customer, not a patient. An
&gt; extra $5 worth of tips will have the entire staff scrambling to help you.

&gt;        6. I will get to meet new people every 7 or 14 days.

&gt;        7. T.V. broken? Light bulb need changing? Need to have the mattress
&gt; replaced? No Problem! They will fix everything and apologize for your
&gt; inconvenience.

&gt;        8. Clean sheets and towels every day, and you don't even have to
&gt; ask for them.

&gt;        9. If you fall in the nursing home and break a hip you are on
&gt; Medicare; if you fall and break a hip on the Princess ship they will
&gt; upgrade you to a suite for the rest of your life.

&gt;        Now hold on for the best! Do you want to see South America, the
&gt; Panama Canal, Tahiti, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, or name where you want
&gt; to go?

&gt;        Princess will have a ship ready to go. So don't look for me in a
&gt; nursing home, just call shore to ship.

&gt;        PS: And don't forget, when you die, they just dump you over the
&gt; side -- at no charge

&gt;        Quite like this thought;&gt;)

&gt;        Enjoy your break
&gt;      Hugs

Steve's right.  Ginger is an well-known remedy for nausea.  My sister's
doctor recommended it to her many, many years ago.  The ginger snaps
work great, and ginger-ale does, too.

As for me, I had absolutely NO PROBLEM with sea sickness.  I found the
gentle motion of the ship to be quite relaxing.  It rocked me to sleep
every night.  However, we were in a &quot;forward&quot; cabin.  I did notice that
the &quot;aft&quot; of the ship moved a LOT more than the &quot;forward&quot; half.  Simple
physics, I suppose.

We cruised on the Carnival Ecstasy to the ports of Cozumel and
Progresso, Mexico.  5-day cruise.  Loved every minute of it.  Ready to
go again RIGHT NOW!  LOL  I highly recommend this cruise.  We did
snorkeling at Cozumel and at Progresso we took a bus ride to the Mayan
ruins at Chichen Itza.  It was AWESOME!
