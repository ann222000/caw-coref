From MSNBC:

Woman stabs dog that attacked her cat
Cat dies from wounds; canine stabbed in rear, survives with minor
injuries

ERHARD, Minn. - Authorities said a woman stabbed a pit bull that got
into her house and attacked her cat.
The Otter Tail County sheriff's office said the woman's daughter and a
friend were walking into the house on Wednesday evening when the
neighborhood dog made it past them and got into the home.

The dog went into a back room and found the cat. While the pit bull was
attacking the cat, authorities said the woman started stabbing the dog
with a knife to get it to stop.

The dog ran out of the house. The cat later died.

Sheriff Brian Schlueter said the dog was stabbed in the hindquarters and
its owner said it did not require medical attention.
The sheriff's office was investigating the incident, Schlueter said.

I'd probably have done the same thing, and I also would have demanded
that !@#%^&amp;*!  dog be put down....I can't stand  Pit Bulls (sorry if
there are any owners on the NG!) and think they should be outlawed
everywhere! No one will ever convince me it's the way they are
raised...bull crap! This happens far too many times...they even will
attack their owners with no provocation!  Just think this could have
been a small child!

The breed, per se, is not the problem. (No, I do not own an American
Staffordshire Terrier.) The breed has two defects: 1) a breeding
community which includes too many idiots who breed for size and
aggressiveness; 2) the dogs attract an inordinately large number of
stupid owners. A well bred Am-staff, with an owner who understand the
breed, is not particularly dangerous. It might surprise you that the
most likely biter, until fairly recently, was the American Cocker Spaniel.

I've heard the same about the pit bull - and don't know if I agree or
disagree as I have no personal evidence having never owned one or know
someone who does that has raised it properly. I do, however, think
that breed may have a propensity towards nastiness and is probably why
so many whackjobs choose them to terrorize people/animals or keep
themselves safe from their fellow crack dealers.
Along with those dogs being put down (in cases like this) I truly wish
their irresponsible owners would be put down as well.

I disagree with what you said about the Pit Bull, Mickey...I have read
way too much, and heard on the news time and time again, how this breed
will attack people and other animals, and I don't see how they can all
possibly be  because of BAD owners. I think this is an aggressive breed,
that can not be trusted, and will attack just out of the blue, for no
reason! I'm not talking about *just* biting (your reference to a Cocker
Spaniel) as a Pit Bull doesn't just take a little nip....it goes in for
the kill, and when there is more than one they can be downright vicious.
No one will convince me otherwise.

I am a dog lover, but I would never own a Pit Bull, or a Rottweiler, as
they have much the same unpredictable disposition! There are too many
other GREAT breeds of dogs out there to chose from. I wouldn't trade my
Golden Retriever for any of them. A person knows whenever they see a
Golden...they can walk right up to it and pet it without being
apprehensive, but most other breeds (even toy breeds) can  not be
trusted, if they don't *know* you.

I have, fille, and I can attest to the fact that if they are raised
properly (like any other pet), they are extremely loyal and friendly.
The reason Pits have such a bad reputation is because of the people who
used them strictly for fighting. They train them to be nasty and then,
when the owner gets busted, the dog's breed gets the blame.

Rottweilers have a reputation of their own as well, because they are
often used as guard dogs. It's not that Rotts are inherently better at
guarding than any other breed or that they are nasty - Doberman's are
also often used - it's that they have an intimidating look and the
physical ability to do the job, so they are trained to do the job.

In all honesty, some of the most naturally aggressive and noisy dogs I
have ever seen are Chihuahuas. They bark at everything and don't
hesitate to bite. Where Pit Bulls and Rotts need to be trained to
attack, a Chihuahua needs to be trained not to.

Cock fighting is also a rather large underground &quot;sport&quot;, but you don't
fear roosters, do you? Why?... because when cock fighting rings are
broken up, the media doesn't harp about how nasty the &quot;Rhode Island Red&quot; is.

I attribute that to the (undeserved) reputation the breed has attained
over the years, that they are physically strong animals, and that they
look mean. Those people get Pit Bulls to increase their status among
their peers. The owners all sit around, tell stories, and laugh about
whoever has the meanest dog or whose dog has done the vicious thing, so
like the idiots they are, they train their dogs to be vicious.

I agree.

All that said, I am not a fan of Pit Bulls in any way. I just think they
get a very bad rap.

Very true.

I would just like to add the American Staffordshire is not the only
breed considered a &quot;pit bull&quot;. There is also the American Pit Bull
Terrier, the Bull Terrier, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, among a
few others.

I think your #1 above is the problem, Micky.

For example, Border Collies have been bred for generations to herd animals.
I've seen untrained Border Collies, who have never seen a sheep in their
lives, try to herd their people, their toys, small children, dust bunnies -
whatever!  That trait has become a part of the breed that is there at birth.

Unfortunately, that's the case with pit bulls - they have been bred for so
many generations to attack, fight, and &quot;worry&quot; their opponent/prey/victim,
that they don't need to be trained, they will naturally try to kill, not
just bite, any living creature of a certain size.  Yes, cocker spaniels may
bite more than any other breed, but a single bite from a small dog is seldom
fatal.  Being mauled by a 60 - 70 pound animal whose natural instinct is to
latch on to something, &quot;worry&quot; it, and *never* let go until its prey is
dead... well that's just a whole 'nother ball game.

I can't tell you how often, here in Houston, we hear of a child being mauled
to death or permanently disfigured by a pit bull - a story like that is on
the news at least every 4 - 5 months.  I have never in my entire life heard
of a child being mauled to death by a cocker spaniel.

Really!? Dogs are one of the best animals on the planet. If a scraggly,

The &quot;smelly gross&quot; part comes off with soap and water. The reward for
getting smelly hands for a few minutes is a friend for life.

The bite of the pit bull is very dangerous.  They clamp down
with those powerful jaws and won't let go.  Lucky me, I have
a pit bull right next door to me.  The owners insist that he
is very sweet but they leave him alone in the back yard all day.
You don't socialize an animal that way.

Have you ever watched &quot;The Dog Whisperer'?  The guy has many
pit bulls but knows how to keep them under control very well.
He uses them to 'help' rehabilitate other dogs.

Being an ailurophile, I prefer cats myself, but I'm a push over for pretty
much any animal (the human variety too, especially when they're young).  The
only reason I don't have a dog as well as my five cats is because I don't
think I could give him the attention and training dogs need to be happy.  DH
and I work all day long and at our age we're pretty much exhausted when we
get home - walking, playing with, or training a dog would not be something
we'd look forward to!  ;&gt;

One of the nicest animals I've ever known is my daughter's golden retriever,
Gypsy.  My daughter was a stay at home mom until her youngest started
school, so she had lots of time (and unlike *her* mom, has infinite
patience).  When the family is eating, Gypsy will sit at the threshhold and
not set a paw into the dining room - she does this without being told or
reminded every time.  My daughter will put leftover steak down for her and
she will sit and watch my daughter until she is given the go-ahead before
she so much as sniffs it.  The gate to their yard can be wide open, and my
daughter will even at times let her go out into the front yard, but she
never sets a paw outside of their property line.  She comes immediately when
called, heels instantly when commanded, never tugs on the leash when being
walked, never jumps up on people, will cross her legs and do the peepee
dance for hours before even thinking about soiling anything in the house,
and goes and lies down or in her kennel with only a single word spoken.  I
always welcome her when my daughter comes to visit - she is a very pleasant
house guest.

And the most charming thing about her is that my daughter taught her grin at
you! http://www.possibleplaces.com/DoggyGrin/

&gt;I can't tell you how often, here in

Yes, you have made a very good point here, CN!  That was my point
also...I'm always hearing on the news about the mayhem that Pit Pulls
can cause, and will even attack their own owners, or someone in the
family, that they are very familiar with, and they don't seem to need a
reason. I've never yet heard about a cocker Spaniel (or a Chihuahua, as
Vandar mentioned) mauling anyone to death??? I'm not saying they
wouldn't bite, but I'm quite sure they are not going to savagely maul a
child!

I'm sure you would have had the same reaction, as I would have, if a dog
came into your house and attacked one of your cats bad enough, that it
later died?! I'd probably picked up a baseball bat (had one been near)
and whacked the dog HARD on the top of it's head, so I can see why she
stabbed it..too bad she only got it's butt!  I love dogs, but I'm not
about to forgive one that hurt/killed one of my cats, and especially in
my own house!

It is absolutely untrue that pits or rotts need to be trained to
attack.  On command maybe, but that's more training them NOT to attack
until released.  Story after story about pits especially getting loose
and attacking anyone in sight.  Come on now.  And it's not just a nip,
you know that, too.

Which is not to defend little yapping rat dogs, but at least they're
mostly harmless.  Not every chihuahua is nasty, either, most are
chronically terrified to paralysis, tho my cousin has had some
long-haired chi's that were actually quite doggy and pleasant.

I summary, I'm with Judy on this, and then some.

Give me a mid-sized hound, or a somewhat-trained terrier, or a good
old fashioned mongrel, or a working-dog from a good background,
something that will chase a frisbee.  Some of my (other) cousin's
poodles were very nice, but mostly in their later years.

&gt; &gt;&gt;The breed, per se, is not the problem. (No, I do not own an American
&gt; &gt;&gt;Staffordshire Terrier.) The breed has two defects: 1) a breeding
&gt; &gt;&gt;community which includes too many idiots who breed for size and
&gt; &gt;&gt;aggressiveness; 2) the dogs attract an inordinately large number of
&gt; &gt;&gt;stupid owners. A well bred Am-staff, with an owner who understand the
&gt; &gt;&gt;breed, is not particularly dangerous. It might surprise you that the
&gt; &gt;&gt;most likely biter, until fairly recently, was the American Cocker Spaniel.

&gt; &gt;&gt;The Other Mickey

&gt; &gt; I've heard the same about the pit bull - and don't know if I agree or
&gt; &gt; disagree as I have no personal evidence having never owned one or know
&gt; &gt; someone who does that has raised it properly.

&gt; I have, fille, and I can attest to the fact that if they are raised
&gt; properly (like any other pet), they are extremely loyal and friendly.
&gt; The reason Pits have such a bad reputation is because of the people who
&gt; used them strictly for fighting. They train them to be nasty and then,
&gt; when the owner gets busted, the dog's breed gets the blame.

&gt; Rottweilers have a reputation of their own as well, because they are
&gt; often used as guard dogs. It's not that Rotts are inherently better at
&gt; guarding than any other breed or that they are nasty - Doberman's are
&gt; also often used - it's that they have an intimidating look and the
&gt; physical ability to do the job, so they are trained to do the job.

&gt; In all honesty, some of the most naturally aggressive and noisy dogs I
&gt; have ever seen are Chihuahuas. They bark at everything and don't
&gt; hesitate to bite. Where Pit Bulls and Rotts need to be trained to
&gt; attack, a Chihuahua needs to be trained not to.

&gt; Cock fighting is also a rather large underground &quot;sport&quot;, but you don't
&gt; fear roosters, do you? Why?... because when cock fighting rings are
&gt; broken up, the media doesn't harp about how nasty the &quot;Rhode Island Red&quot; is.

&gt; &gt; I do, however, think
&gt; &gt; that breed may have a propensity towards nastiness and is probably why
&gt; &gt; so many whackjobs choose them to terrorize people/animals or keep
&gt; &gt; themselves safe from their fellow crack dealers.

&gt; I attribute that to the (undeserved) reputation the breed has attained
&gt; over the years, that they are physically strong animals, and that they
&gt; look mean. Those people get Pit Bulls to increase their status among
&gt; their peers. The owners all sit around, tell stories, and laugh about
&gt; whoever has the meanest dog or whose dog has done the vicious thing, so
&gt; like the idiots they are, they train their dogs to be vicious.

&gt; &gt; Along with those dogs being put down (in cases like this) I truly wish
&gt; &gt; their irresponsible owners would be put down as well.

&gt; I agree.

&gt; All that said, I am not a fan of Pit Bulls in any way. I just think they
&gt; get a very bad rap.-
">

That could very well be, Vandar - as I said, I have no personal
reference point but I have certainly heard many times that, if raised
properly, pits are no more vicious than any other dog. I just don't
know. It's probably true that a lot of the smaller dogs are more to be
feared - some can have nasty dispositions for sure. My in-laws have a
history with chihuahuas - I know many people wouldn't touch one of
those dogs. Of the three I've known of theirs since I've been around
the family - only one was a mean little cuss. The last one they
recently had to put down, due to illness, was a sweetie pie and very
smart. The only time I saw her get &quot;vicious&quot; was one Christmas -
someone had gotten some chocolate as a gift and set it down in their
pile of unwrapped gifts. &quot;Ginger&quot; thought she would sneak over and
steal a piece. When she was &quot;caught&quot; by my father-in-law (who she
adored) and he went to take the candy away from her - YOWZER - Ginger
flipped out and bit his hand. Of course, I can relate - you touch MY
chocolate and I'll bite you too.  :-)

We had a beautiful German Shepherd back in the 80's, when we lived on a
farm in Oregon.  She was a gentle, smart, obedient dog and always a
pleasure.  She never nipped at the five kids or even at strangers.  The
only problem we had with her was once when a stray dog decided to camp
on our doorstep, and we were seriously considering keeping it, our dog,
Autumn, and the stray started killing the chickens, which she had never
done before.  Somehow the presence of the second dog brought out a
killer instinct in her.  We quickly found a new home for the stray, and
Autumn went back to being her sweet self.

especially. When anyone comes to the house, she has to shut the dog

My oldest daughter had a pit bull.  Never had any trouble with him,
whatsoever.  Yes, we were worried because we had heard all the horror
stories, but he was a sweetheart.  He was proctective of the children
and yet they could climb all over him and he just loved them.  Sadly,
she had to put him down about a year and a half ago due to some very
obscure disease he developed while in Italy.  She found him running on
a tarmac in Naples, where she was stationed.  He looked like he had
been abandoned and she, always a softie for dogs, adopted him.

Now, would I ever want one?  No, but I do realize that the owners are
quite responsible for a great deal of the bad reputation.  However,
those dogs have incredibly powerful jaws: no other dog has quite the
same jaws these dogs do.  Unless I know the dog and owner very well,
those dogs make me very nervous.  Honestly, you really never know.  My
daughter may have been lucky.  We'll never know.

A pit bull can be registered with the AKC as an American Staffordshire
Terrier. AKC claims that &quot;American Pit Bull Terrier&quot; is not a valid
breed. Such dogs can be classified under other headings. The
Staffordshire is the &quot;show&quot; version of the pit bull.

Sorry Judy, my experience in dog parks with other people's Goldens is
worse than it has been with pits. (BTW, I've had two Goldens.) Proper
socialization is crucial with any breed and rule one is that in any
normal situation all humans are alpha (even Al Gore). In guard bred and
trained animals, the situation is slightly different, but that should be
pretty obvious. Even protective breeds, like the Kuvasz, can be
socialized to be gentle with all humans and even play well with other
dogs. (BTW, the Kuvasz breeders I've met are quite firm on the need for
proper socialization.)

Finding a responsible breeder is important with any breed and crucial
for all protective breeds (Kuvasz, Dobies, GDS, etc.) and for pits and
other dogs with too many iffy breeders (Rotties, Bull Mastiff,
Ridgebacks, etc.). If I were to buy a pit, it would only be from a
breeder with a successful record competing in the show ring, obedience
trials, and who can point to a bunch of good doggy citizenship
certificates for animals he or she has bred.

One way to tell if you've found a good breeder is the purchase ocntract.
If the breeder retains some breeding control of your dog or bitch (i.e.,
no breeding without your breeder's consent), you will have probably
found a responsible breeder. That plus membership in the breeder
organization recognized by AKC will usually be enough to insure a good
pet, though meeting dogs and bitches from previous litters is a good
idea, too. If your breeder can't prove four generations of registered
ancestors for your dog, you're probably better off adopting a mixed
breed mut. The mut may not have the fine tuned features of a pure breed,
but neither will it be likely to have the potential negatives.

I also know HOW to choose a puppy from a reputable breeder, as I have
had many purebred dogs over the years, my first one was back in '53 and
was a black Lab, and before then, I had been buying dog breeder
magazines for a long time, since I was about 9 years old (back then I
wanted a rough coated Collie) and through the years, I have bought
several Beagles and then the 4 Goldens, and with each I researched the
family history, and reputation of the breeder (the same as when we
bought our Seal Point Siamese cats) so I am not some &quot;green horn&quot;.

Dogs have been a big part of my life, and I've never been without one
for long. My folk got me a cute little black dog when I was 9 months
old, who lived to be 9 years, until  he got gangrene in his one leg,
after a fight with the neighbor's dog, and there was no vets here back
in those days, so my dad had to put him out of his misery.

That may be true up in the Great North, but down here in the 48
contiguous, they're just dogs. That they are generally an &quot;easy&quot; breed
doesn't mean one can't ruin one or for one to come from the &quot;factory&quot;
with a built in crappy disposition. As they say, one's mileage can vary,
but my dog was attacked as a pup by a Golden. He has also gotten along
perfectly well with other Goldens, though he is wary until he knows the
particular dog.

Sure they do. I've seen them pick fights (though probably no more than
any other sporting dog), as has anyone else who has been to a dog park.
They are generally well managed, but a dominant male or bitch is a
dominant male or bitch, and they are going to protect their pack position.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Woman stabs dog that attacked her cat

&gt;&gt;&gt; ERHARD, Minn. - Authorities said a woman stabbed a pit bull that got
&gt;&gt;&gt; into her house and attacked her cat. The Otter Tail County sheriff's
&gt;&gt;&gt; office said the woman's daughter and a
&gt;&gt;&gt; friend were walking into the house on Wednesday evening when the
&gt;&gt;&gt; neighborhood dog made it past them and got into the home.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The dog went into a back room and found the cat. While the pit bull was
&gt;&gt;&gt; attacking the cat, authorities said the woman started stabbing the dog
&gt;&gt;&gt; with a knife to get it to stop.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The dog ran out of the house. The cat later died.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sheriff Brian Schlueter said the dog was stabbed in the hindquarters and
&gt;&gt;&gt; its owner said it did not require medical attention.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The sheriff's office was investigating the incident, Schlueter said.

&gt;&gt;&gt; everywhere! No one will ever convince me it's the way they are
&gt;&gt;&gt; raised...bull crap!
&gt;&gt; The breed, per se, is not the problem. (No, I do not own an American
&gt;&gt; Staffordshire Terrier.) The breed has two defects: 1) a breeding community
&gt;&gt; which includes too many idiots who breed for size and aggressiveness; 2)
&gt;&gt; the dogs attract an inordinately large number of stupid owners. A well
&gt;&gt; bred Am-staff, with an owner who understand the breed, is not particularly
&gt;&gt; dangerous. It might surprise you that the most likely biter, until fairly
&gt;&gt; recently, was the American Cocker Spaniel.

&gt;&gt; The Other Mickey

&gt; I think your #1 above is the problem, Micky.

&gt; For example, Border Collies have been bred for generations to herd animals.
&gt; I've seen untrained Border Collies, who have never seen a sheep in their
&gt; lives, try to herd their people, their toys, small children, dust bunnies -
&gt; whatever!  That trait has become a part of the breed that is there at birth.

&gt; Unfortunately, that's the case with pit bulls - they have been bred for so
&gt; many generations to attack, fight, and &quot;worry&quot; their opponent/prey/victim,
&gt; that they don't need to be trained, they will naturally try to kill, not
&gt; just bite, any living creature of a certain size.
">

That is actually true of virtually all terriers. They were bred to kill
vermin. Note that they worst of that originally useful trait has been
bred out of the type. Unfortunately, some bozos with short dicks have
bred the trait back into part of the gene pool. It wouldn't take that
many generations to breed it back into the main line or almost entirely
out of the gene pool, entirely.

The dog I own is a Spinone, an ancient hunting breed from Northern
Italy. The dog has an 800 year (or longer) history of being sweet
tempered. The legend is that no one ever been bitten by one. This is
obviously hyperbole, but true in general. They have a very soft mouth
and are absolute slobs for attention, even from kiddies who pull on
their ears. A several decades ago, some breeders tried to breed the dog
smaller and lighter boned so they would be more competitive in field
trials with the lighter boned competition (kurzhaar and drathaar,
particularly). While the smaller Spinoni were peppier, they were no
longer as easy to live with. Quite sensibly, they allowed (or helped)
the breed to return to it's more generous proportions and the lovable
personality returned, as well.

I fear the Am-Staff and its kin will have a bad rep until the short
dicks in this country find something else to own to compensate for their
deficits. Then people who appreciate the good qualities of the beasties
might have a chance to temper the breed.

&gt; bite more than any other breed, but a single bite from a small dog is seldom

&gt; dead... well that's just a whole 'nother ball game.

&gt; I can't tell you how often, here in Houston, we hear of a child being mauled
&gt; to death or permanently disfigured by a pit bull - a story like that is on

...not to death, but two children seriously. It's a little harder to
make a search for more examples of cockers mauling, because most get
lost in the noise of other breeds' maulings, plus cockers seem to mauled
a lot, themselves, maybe from picking fights outside the breed's present
weight class.

My dad's pure bred Golden was a mean biter, and had to be kept in
the bedroom when the family came to visit.

There's a big difference between biting and killing.  We always
hear about the killing on the news.  But dogs bite, bite, bite people every
single day, every hour of every day, but they aren't as physically capable
of killing like a big muscular Rottie or Pit.  Also, since it's usually
un-neutered, stray male dogs who do most of the serious, nasty biting, you
have to look at the owners.  If they don't bother to neuter their dogs, and
worse, don't bother to keep them safe at home, they may not be showing them
all the affection and caring that _any_ dog needs in order to be safe to be
around.  My experience of working at an animal shelter is that the people
who dump their Pits are young males who wouldn't know how to take care of a
stuffed animal much less a living, breathing dog.  We're just lucky that
some of them do dump their dogs at the shelter, rather then just abandon
them, because most of the irresponsible people just open the back door and
tell the dog to get lost when they don't want it anymore.  People get a Pit
puppy, RUIN it, (make it mean) they can't handle it anymore, then they kick
it out the door.  Also, don't forget, it doesn't make news if a Cocker
Spaniel bites a kid's face half off, it only makes news if a Pit does it.
Why, I don't know.  But trust me, we get Cockers, Labs, Goldens, Chows, you
name it,  dumped at the shelter every month because they bit a family
member.  They are just not all built to kill, whether they want to or not is
another story, they just can't do it.  Did you know a Pomeranian killed a
baby a couple of years ago?  It was a family dog.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Woman stabs dog that attacked her cat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cat dies from wounds; canine stabbed in rear, survives with minor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; injuries

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ERHARD, Minn. - Authorities said a woman stabbed a pit bull that got
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into her house and attacked her cat. The Otter Tail County sheriff's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; office said the woman's daughter and a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; friend were walking into the house on Wednesday evening when the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neighborhood dog made it past them and got into the home.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The dog went into a back room and found the cat. While the pit bull was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attacking the cat, authorities said the woman started stabbing the dog
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with a knife to get it to stop.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The dog ran out of the house. The cat later died.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sheriff Brian Schlueter said the dog was stabbed in the hindquarters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; its owner said it did not require medical attention.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The sheriff's office was investigating the incident, Schlueter said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I'd probably have done the same thing, and I also would have demanded
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that !@#%^&amp;*!  dog be put down....I can't stand  Pit Bulls (sorry if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are any owners on the NG!) and think they should be outlawed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everywhere! No one will ever convince me it's the way they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; raised...bull crap!
&gt;&gt;&gt; The breed, per se, is not the problem. (No, I do not own an American
&gt;&gt;&gt; Staffordshire Terrier.) The breed has two defects: 1) a breeding
&gt;&gt;&gt; community which includes too many idiots who breed for size and
&gt;&gt;&gt; aggressiveness; 2) the dogs attract an inordinately large number of
&gt;&gt;&gt; stupid owners. A well bred Am-staff, with an owner who understand the
&gt;&gt;&gt; breed, is not particularly dangerous. It might surprise you that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; most likely biter, until fairly recently, was the American Cocker
&gt;&gt;&gt; Spaniel.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Other Mickey

&gt;&gt; I think your #1 above is the problem, Micky.

&gt;&gt; For example, Border Collies have been bred for generations to herd
&gt;&gt; animals. I've seen untrained Border Collies, who have never seen a sheep
&gt;&gt; in their lives, try to herd their people, their toys, small children,
&gt;&gt; dust bunnies - whatever!  That trait has become a part of the breed that
&gt;&gt; is there at birth.

&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, that's the case with pit bulls - they have been bred for
&gt;&gt; so many generations to attack, fight, and &quot;worry&quot; their
&gt;&gt; opponent/prey/victim, that they don't need to be trained, they will
&gt;&gt; naturally try to kill, not just bite, any living creature of a certain
&gt;&gt; size.

&gt; That is actually true of virtually all terriers. They were bred to kill
&gt; vermin. Note that they worst of that originally useful trait has been bred
&gt; out of the type. Unfortunately, some bozos with short dicks have bred the
&gt; trait back into part of the gene pool. It wouldn't take that many
&gt; generations to breed it back into the main line or almost entirely out of
&gt; the gene pool, entirely.

&gt; The dog I own is a Spinone, an ancient hunting breed from Northern Italy.
&gt; The dog has an 800 year (or longer) history of being sweet tempered. The
&gt; legend is that no one ever been bitten by one. This is obviously
&gt; hyperbole, but true in general. They have a very soft mouth and are
&gt; absolute slobs for attention, even from kiddies who pull on their ears. A
&gt; several decades ago, some breeders tried to breed the dog smaller and
&gt; lighter boned so they would be more competitive in field trials with the
&gt; lighter boned competition (kurzhaar and drathaar, particularly). While the
&gt; smaller Spinoni were peppier, they were no longer as easy to live with.
&gt; Quite sensibly, they allowed (or helped) the breed to return to it's more
&gt; generous proportions and the lovable personality returned, as well.

&gt; I fear the Am-Staff and its kin will have a bad rep until the short dicks
&gt; in this country find something else to own to compensate for their
&gt; deficits. Then people who appreciate the good qualities of the beasties
&gt; might have a chance to temper the breed.

&gt;   Yes, cocker spaniels may
&gt;&gt; bite more than any other breed, but a single bite from a small dog is
&gt;&gt; seldom fatal.  Being mauled by a 60 - 70 pound animal whose natural
&gt;&gt; instinct is to latch on to something, &quot;worry&quot; it, and *never* let go
&gt;&gt; until its prey is dead... well that's just a whole 'nother ball game.

&gt;&gt; I can't tell you how often, here in Houston, we hear of a child being
&gt;&gt; mauled to death or permanently disfigured by a pit bull - a story like
&gt;&gt; that is on the news at least every 4 - 5 months.  I have never in my
&gt;&gt; entire life heard of a child being mauled to death by a cocker spaniel.

&gt; http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950919/09190...

&gt; ...not to death, but two children seriously. It's a little harder to make
&gt; a search for more examples of cockers mauling, because most get lost in
&gt; the noise of other breeds' maulings, plus cockers seem to mauled a lot,
&gt; themselves, maybe from picking fights outside the breed's present weight
&gt; class.
">

Of course.  The one thing everyone must remember in a discussion like this
is that there are never any absolutes.  There are so many factors that play
into bad outcomes that it would be impossible to point a finger at just one.
Bad (neglectful of training) and/or abusive owners could make even a small,
even-tmepered breed of dog into a biter.  Breeders who peddle dogs to owners
who use their dogs as compensation for their own, erm, &quot;short comings&quot; are
also part of the problem (naturally with the short maturation time and
gestation period, dogs can &quot;evolve&quot; in very little time).

On the flip side of that are responsible breeders and owners who create good
dogs.  I would trust a pit bull raised by my daughter a heck of a lot more
than a chichuaua raised by a drug dealer.  But, *any* dog will attack
someone who is (perceived to be) attacking his owner, that's one trait that
transcends breed and has been a part of canine  behavior ever since we bred
domestic dogs from wolves.  Pack mentality is, I believe, something that
would take millennia to remove.

I *have* heard that cocker spaniels are the most frequent biters and I don't
dispute that.  I also understand that any dog can cause pretty serious
damage (I have cats who can!!).  But, logically, when a large, powerful dog
attacks, it is reasonable to assume that the damage is going to be worse
than that of a small dog attack.  Add to that the natural tendencies of the
breed (indeed, of any terrier) to &quot;latch onto&quot; and &quot;worry&quot; prey, and the
damage can become even worse.

And to those who are essentially saying, &quot;Well, I had a dog who...&quot; - this
isn't an argument that can be won by presenting anecdotal evidence, there is
always an exception to the rule that could argue for either side.

Peace out!

Hugs,

I have yet to have one of my Goldens get into a dog fight...even if a
stray dog shows up our in our yard when Nugget is outside, they end up
romping around like a couple of kids...he loves having someone to play
with. Maybe because our two male Golden Retrievers were neutered might
make a difference?! The most aggressive dog we have ever had was a
German Shepard (mother was purebred) and Husky combination, and he'd
fight anything on four feet, and after he killed a adult female Beagle I
was taking care of, we had him put down, as he'd nipped a couple of
people too, that got too close to our kids. We loved him, but he was
OVERLY protective, which isn't always a good thing!

Okay, I stand corrected (Vandar also sent me the link for the child
mauling) but after looking at the sites, I have some comments to make,
and points to ponder (now I will sound like one of OJ's lawyers!) but I
will defend the reputation of a purebred Golden Retriever till I'm blue
in the face, and I feel I am a good example, since I've owned 4, and
interacted with many over the course of my lifetime, and haven't met a
&quot;bad&quot; one yet.

The case of the neighbor's dog mauling the 3 year old girl in March is
perplexing to me, and even the writer of the article mentioned the
wonderful temperament of this breed, and wondered if it was old and
perhaps grouchy, which still does not excuse it's behavior. Also was it
a purebred dog from a reputable breeder, or a cull, or mixed breed from
a puppy mill?! My one son bought a supposed purebred Golden from a lady
that owned the sire and the bitch, but it seemed strange that she was
only asking $50 (I paid $600 for mine locally) and come to find out
later, the two purebred dogs DID indeed breed, but a neighbor told us
later, the bitch had bred with a Blood Hound down the street too, so
though it LOOKS mostly like a Golden, it has huge feet, long ears and a
very long body! However, I will say, he turned out to be a great dog,
and typically mellow like a Golden.

Now....in the case of the owner being mauled to death by the 3 dogs, the
one being her own G. Retriever, a Australian Shepard (apparently owned
by the lady's husband) AND a American BULL DOG/Catahoula (whatever in
the heck that is?!) mix, and it had to be shot by a sheriff, as tried to
attack him too! So they KNOW this is the dog the did the killing, but
they found one set of the G. Retriever's  teeth marks in her....okay,
this is what I think happened, from experiences I've had with dog
fights...the bite marks came about when she intervened, and the bull dog
was killing her, so her dog was extremely excited and wanting to protect
her from this Bull Dog and was attacking THAT dog, and one of the bites,
meant for that dog, went into the woman's skin, because of the close
contact of the Bull Dog on the woman.....unless there was a witness at
the time...showing the Golden actually attacking HER, I will never be
convinced that it did.  I just don't buy that at all!

Is there such a thing as a &quot;mean&quot; biter...like compared to a &quot;friendly

Let me ask you this......has your dad been the only owner of this dog,
and has he had him since he was a small puppy? Has your dad always
treated him good? is he a old dog now? Has he always bitten? This is
extremely unusual. We bought our first Golden Retriever in 1983, after
our first grandchild was born. I researched many breeds to find one that
was &quot;kid friendly&quot; and a gentle disposition, and because of what I
learned, we bought Shawna. One by one the grandchildren came along and
she loved them dearly (she loved everybody, AAMOF!) and they'd crawl on
her, pull her ears, and her tail, etc., as babies will do, and she'd
just wag her tail and lap them in the face with her tongue.  I have yet
to meet a MEAN Golden Retriever.

I also put our dog away when company comes, so he doesn't pester them to
death..he loves everybody and expects them to love him back, but not all
people are dog crazy, so I don't like him to be overbearing and make a
pest out of himself.

Our dog will stand there and let the cats eat beside him, out of his
food bowl, and even when he has a knuckle bone to chew on, and they come
around him, he doesn't so much as let out a warning growl...he just wags
his tail. He and the 5 cats are all buddies and they curl up together on
his bed to sleep.

I wonder with the popularity of Goldens if there's too much
over-breeding going on.  That can happen to very popular
breeds (such as the Cocker Spaniel).

My sister's dog is a really huge Golden but he's such a wuss.
He doesn't seem to know how big he is.  We joke
that he has lace on his panties.  He's just a real sweetie.

&gt; &gt; My brother &amp; his wife rescue Rottweilers... I am SOOOOO not a dog lover,
&gt; &gt; on the contrary, I avoid them whenever possible.. .. I won't touch them,
&gt; &gt; won't pet them.. will hide my hands up in my armpits if necessary to avoid
&gt; &gt; having a dog touch my hands... the idea of a smelly gross dog touching me
&gt; &gt; makes me feel queasy.

&gt; &gt; That said, the rottweilers I've had contact with via my brother's rescues
&gt; &gt; have been some of the sweetest dogs I've ever come in contact with...  One
&gt; &gt; thought he was a lapdog and would stretch his entire body across mine, on
&gt; &gt; the couch- what my family thought amazing is that I let him!

&gt; &gt; My mother's former dog, a collie OTOH.. UGH...  annoying freakin' dog if
&gt; &gt; there ever was one.  And her current dog, a corgi mix.. a real PITA-
&gt; &gt; growls and snarls if anyone goes near my mother.. which would be good, but
&gt; &gt; she growls and snarls at even my dad and other family members as well.

&gt; &gt; Me, I'll stick with my cat, thankyouverymuch.

&gt; Being an ailurophile, I prefer cats myself, but I'm a push over for pretty
&gt; much any animal (the human variety too, especially when they're young).  The
&gt; only reason I don't have a dog as well as my five cats is because I don't
&gt; think I could give him the attention and training dogs need to be happy.  DH
&gt; and I work all day long and at our age we're pretty much exhausted when we
&gt; get home - walking, playing with, or training a dog would not be something
&gt; we'd look forward to!  ;&gt;

&gt; One of the nicest animals I've ever known is my daughter's golden retriever,
&gt; Gypsy.  My daughter was a stay at home mom until her youngest started
&gt; school, so she had lots of time (and unlike *her* mom, has infinite
&gt; patience).  When the family is eating, Gypsy will sit at the threshhold and
&gt; not set a paw into the dining room - she does this without being told or
&gt; reminded every time.  My daughter will put leftover steak down for her and
&gt; she will sit and watch my daughter until she is given the go-ahead before
&gt; she so much as sniffs it.  The gate to their yard can be wide open, and my
&gt; daughter will even at times let her go out into the front yard, but she
&gt; never sets a paw outside of their property line.  She comes immediately when
&gt; called, heels instantly when commanded, never tugs on the leash when being
&gt; walked, never jumps up on people, will cross her legs and do the peepee
&gt; dance for hours before even thinking about soiling anything in the house,
&gt; and goes and lies down or in her kennel with only a single word spoken.  I
&gt; always welcome her when my daughter comes to visit - she is a very pleasant
&gt; house guest.

&gt; And the most charming thing about her is that my daughter taught her grin at
&gt; you! http://www.possibleplaces.com/DoggyGrin/

Ready for this?

About 3 years ago, one of my neighbors was walking her Pit.  (sweet dog btw)
When she was directly in front of our yard, another neighbor's dog was loose
and starting attacking my neighbor and her Pit.   I was outside with a
worker, and the two of us couldn't get that nasty ass dog to stop attacking
this woman and her pit.

Luckily the worker had some sort of stick with him and he was able to pry
the vicious dog off this poor woman and her dog.    By that time, the owner
of the loose dog ran over and pulled him away.   This dog was out of
control.  The woman ended up getting stitches in two different places, and
her Pit got part of his ear bitten off.   He not only didn't fight back, he
was on a leash and he couldn't get away from the other dog.   It was
pitiful.  (no pun intended)

The other dog?   A golden retriever.

I will defend this breed of dog until the &quot;cows come home&quot;, and it's not
just because of the 4 Goldens we've had, but the ones I've been around,
belonging to friends and other family members, AND talking to our
veterinarian and dog groomer.  She  always enjoys grooming the Goldens
(and Nugget loves going there!) as she said it's the smaller breeds that
give her trouble. I've been there many times, when she has a &quot;foo-foo
dog&quot; (such as a toy Poodle) on the table with a muzzle on it, cause she
said she's been bitten several times.

Also.....many people confuse the actual Golden Retriever with a Yellow
Labrador, and often refer to them as a &quot;Golden&quot; as well. I love Labs,
but they have more of a tendency to be aggressive and some can have a
bad &quot;rap&quot;. The Golden Retrievers we have has the long, flowing
hair..their tails is &quot;feathered&quot; and have long hair on their chests,
legs and stomach....beautiful dogs. The YELLOW Lab has short hair.

You didn't answer my questions....has your dad had this dog since it was
a young pup? Has he always bitten? Has your dad always treated him well?
I'm just asking, as I am adamant about this NOT being the &quot;normal&quot;
character of a purebred Golden Retriever.

But you don't have to defend Goldens until the cows come home.
Nobody was attacking your favorite breed of dog.  *You*  attacked an entire
breed of dog, (Pits), and at the same time made statements proclaiming that
Goldens never bite, Goldens are all even tempered, etc... so I and a few
other people simply pointed out (with examples) that not all Goldens are so
wonderful after all.  I don't consider that an attack. We also suggested
that the Pits who have attacked people or other animals were likely poorly
bred or worse, poorly treated, and you repeated that Goldens are so
wonderful and that all Pits should be banned everywhere.  Then you asked me
how my dad treated his (mean, biting) dog and if he was the original owner.
I pointed out that according to your own argument, it shouldn't even matter
if my dad kicked it up one side of the street and down the other, just the
fact that he was a Golden should have ensured that he would be wonderful and
sweet and never bite, etc...

No my dad was not the original owner, he got it from an elderly
neighbor.  He was mean when he got him and stayed mean.  My dad treated him
like a king.  He treated him better than he ever treated any of his
children.  My dad lived and breathed to lavish love and attention on that
dog. We have no way of knowing how his original owner treated him, and my
point in not answering the questions the first time was that according to
you, there is no such thing as a Golden who has ever even been in a bad
mood, and when other people said that maybe these Pits who attack may have
been treated like crap, it didn't move you one bit, so why is it important
how a Golden is treated and not important how a Pit Bull is treated?  *Any*
dog may attack and bite a person or another animal.  Other breeds of dogs
have bitten and even killed human beings and other animals, and it gets
noted in one or two local papers if at all.  If a Pit attacks someone,
literally thousands of papers pick up the story.  That's why you only hear
about Pit attacks.  For some reason, it's not newsworthy unless it's a Pit
Bull.

I'm clearly not a &quot;dog person&quot;, but I've had dogs in the past - the best
dogs I've had were Labradors (one black, one yellow).  They were *great*
with kids!  I've also heard that Labradors are the only &quot;hunting&quot; dog that
can also be a &quot;family&quot; dog (e.g. letting them in the house as a pet doesn't
interfere with their training or natural hunting abilities).  Since I
haven't ever hunted much less used a dog for hunting, I can't attest to the
validity of this observation.  And since I haven't owned every Lab ever
born, I can't say that every Lab is a sweetie.  But if I were to get a dog -
one that I would feel is safe with my cats - I'd probably choose a Lab, get
him/her as a puppy, and get my daughter to teach me how to train him/her.

Hugs,
