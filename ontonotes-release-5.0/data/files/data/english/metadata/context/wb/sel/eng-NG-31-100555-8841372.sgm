I helped a friend change one of the corner lights on her 2000 Camry,
putting in a #194 for a #91. However, her bad light indicator stays on.
She says it does flicker some, and I suspect that the t-connector for
the trailer lights may be a culprit, but didn't have time to check
tonight. Also, I have read that you have to watch changing the bulb #'s,
but have also seen the 194 for 921 swap elsewhere as ok. Another thing I
noticed, is that when she puts on the brakes, the tail lights go out
(including the ones in the trunk light) and only the two brake lights on
the side and in the window come on.

I would like to get some opinions?

The &quot;brake lamp out&quot; indicator is for brake lamps, right? So I
thought.

You did mention &quot;corner light&quot;.
