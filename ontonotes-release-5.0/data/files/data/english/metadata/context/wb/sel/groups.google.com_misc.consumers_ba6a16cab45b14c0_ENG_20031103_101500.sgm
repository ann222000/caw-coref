I looked at their web site and found no such exclusions but I was
wondering about real life experiences or hassles anyone may have gotten
trying to returnd a recorder.

I'm willing to pay more at walmart than an online retailer solely for
the possibility of me not liking the thing and wanting to return it.
Most online places exclude such returns or charge 10% so even with tax I
pay in person, I'm going to come out ahead with piece of mind.

"/> If &quot;not liking it&quot; is your reason for return, that would imply
you've tried it out and it worked but you've changed your mind. Why
should a retailer accept it for a full refund under those

I don't know Wal-mart's national policy, but I feel safe in saying
that whatever the national policy there will be local variations,
out of ignorance if for no other reason. If you really want to do
this, ask at your local Wal-mart, and make sure you get it IN
WRITING that you can return it if you don't like it.

Are you saying you never returned anything that was not defective?
What's wrong with changing my mind? I'm not intending to start a flame
war but I did have to take you to task regarding your inference that I
was doing something underhanded.

Well to put your mind at ease:

http://www.walmart.com/cservice/ca_sh_returns.gsp?NavMode=2

Your complete shopping satisfaction is our number one priority. If an
item you order from Walmart.com does not meet your expectations, simply
return it by one of the methods below.

I think Sam wants me to be satisfied, and as long as I follow their
official policy I don't think they care. Aren't returns built into their
profit base? Yes, the bean counters have this thing called returns and
allowances. I'm not arguing the morality of returning a fully
functioning product because, in my short time here on earth, I've
returned a few things simply because I didn't like the color yet the tie
was fully functional LOL and no one ever gave me the least bit of hassle.

Also sometimes things don't fit etc but they are not defective, just not
to your liking. But by your statement, one would have to keep the
horrible piece of clothing. I'd think a retailer would be happy to get
everything back in one piece in new condition rather than if I was one
of those people that bought something expensive to use it one night then
return it or break something and try to get away with it. That is
definitely wrong.

Back to the real reason for my post: they only take computer items 15
days and while I know the dvd recorder isn't a computer, I was curious
what people's experiences were if they ever tried returning it after 15
days for example.

PS don't forget, the retailers make the rules and if they wanted returns
to be more difficult, they wouldn't have made it so easy to return
virtually anything. I forget which one, but I know one clothing catalog
takes back stuff even after you've worn it for months! You must be
fuming over that policy.

ATTENTION NIKE users:in case you didn't know it, Nike will give you a
new pair of sneakers if you send your old smelly ones back and just say
they didn't last as long as you expected. I found that our during an
audit of them a few years ago so I know it to be true. They don't make
policies without thinking of them first, so this is what they want and
allow. They wouldn't be making millions/billions if they did things
willy nilly.

Ain't American Great!

IF I buy a SVHS vcr and it recorded crappy quality tapes, Im not satisfied.
So I am able to return it.

Nothing underhanded or deceitful. I rightfully tell the clerk that &quot;The item
doesn't meet my expectations. It works, but it doesn't do what I
thought/want it would do&quot;.
Some items like electronics cannot be fully understood or &quot;seen&quot; how it
works until its home with the customer.

"/> Nothing's wrong with changing your mind, but why should I pay for it

If you have buyer's remorse before you've opened the item, that's
fine. But if you change your mind after using it, NOT because it
doesn't work but just because you changed your mind, why should you
think you're entitled to return it?

A few retailers do accept returns of even used merchandise for any
reason. That's their prerogative, and they build that flexibility
into the prices they charge.

before purchase.

I believe that many retailers choose to offer returns &quot;for any reason&quot;
specifically because if they did not, then people would hold off buying
things that they are not certain about, and might not be back to buy it
later.

I know that I often buy things that I am not sure I will keep,
specifically because I know that I can return it later (after taking it
over with others or doing additional research.) Sometimes I end up
keeping the item; sometimes I end up returning it. However, if I am
dealing with a retailer who does NOT accept returns, then I will not buy
it there until I am sure.

Often, I will buy a product from a retailer who charges more,
specifically because I know that I can return it for whatever reason.
Obviously, the retailers who have this policy believe they will make
more money by accepting returns than by NOT doing so. The retailers
have the final say in their policy, and I don't see any problem with
that.

I just wish someone could answer my question instead of getting into all
this other crap. If the thing burns inferior dvds, then I'm not
interested and it's going back. Also I'm worried about the 'chroma' bug
I've read about in the review on soundandvision mag. I've done weeks of
research but there still is the chance it's a bad thing.

Also Stan, if you don't want to pay for my returns, I suggest you don't
shop at places with wonderful return policies. I choose to pay more for
that privledge. Also I don't shop at those places that don't accept
returns so you are free to save your $ there if you like. That's called
freedom of choice. I'm not forcing you to shop at walmart. I thank God I
live in a world where most of the time, the consumer is king.

As far as my posting etiquette, well it's simply not possible that I
could be as perfect as you must be, sorry. I think I'd worry more about
the spam and other things that find their way in here than the order in
which I answer something. After all, I paid for the right to post as I
please and it's every individual's choice to read my thread 'as is.' If
you don't want to read what I have to say, you don't have to. That's
what killfiles are for.

"/> Seems that people think that items that we dont end up liking can't be
returned for that reason.
I've changed my mind about items that I've bought and returned because it
either didn't meet my expectations or just ended up being not really what I
wanted.

I dotn do this with clothes, but material goods like electronics; NO ONE has
a 100% sure way of knowing that they will end up liking the product, since
electronic items must be used to be determined if I am gonna like the
product or not. You can do all the research on all the sites and magazines
you want, I could be that 1% that find the product not worth the money
spent.

As for a DVD wrtier. Im on my second one. My first was a Sony DVD+RW (no +R
since i bought it prior to +R being finalized ) and have a used Pioneer A07
DVD-R since the discs are cheaper.

I've used every brand of DVD+RW there are and have tried everything from
cheap CompUSA DVD-R discs. I found Sony DVD+RW the best and for DVD-R , TDK
and Maxells worked the best for me for makign &quot;movie&quot; discs . For data
storage, the cheap DVD-r's from CompUSA worked fine. Its nice knowing I can
back up my computer on only 4 discs.

AS for the chroma bug? I haven't run into it on the 150+ dvd's i've used so
far but I definitely know about it.

"/> Thank you. I agree. If a store isn't going to cater as much to the customer
by making their decision making and their return / refund policy as friendly
as possible, I wont shop there. Luckily, I've never ran into a store that
had a policy of &quot;if its used, dont return it&quot;.

In fact I just returned a DVD player to CompUSA for a friend because the
player itself was &quot;not adequate&quot; for his stereo system he had ( conflict of
hardware ). They took it back, no questions asked, refunded the money, which
he went and spent on computer supplies later that week at that same store.

"/> Be aware that some retailers have different return policies for their
online stores and their brick &amp; mortar stores. If you are uncertain
about Wal-Mart's policy for returning an item (any item), just ask
someone there to give you a copy of the return policy. Some stores also
charge a restocking fee for electronic goods, but I don't know if
Wal-Mart is one of them. Read the return policy and ask a manager any
questions if the policy is not clear.

nope, not at all...the panasonic standalone I'm looking at won't even
let me do that. I'm just tired of the hundreds of vhs tapes laying
around and also I want to save stuff off my tivo because it's hogging
space. So sorry to spoil your theory Larry. :)

I'm sure you meant your statement tongue in cheek because, as I've
demonstrated already, I just want to play by the rules the retailers and
big hollywood producers have set for me. I can't even tell you the last
time I rented a movie. So you are off base there. Besides, the PPV at
home are cheaper anyways and I CAN make copies of them right off my tivo.

&gt; online stores and their brick &amp; mortar stores. If you are uncertain
&gt; about Wal-Mart's policy for returning an item (any item), just ask
&gt; someone there to give you a copy of the return policy. Some stores also
&gt; charge a restocking fee for electronic goods, but I don't know if
&gt; Wal-Mart is one of them. Read the return policy and ask a manager any
&gt; questions if the policy is not clear.

(lighthearted response...honest)

yes it's always the abusers that mess things up for me...it's that way
at work too, one person does something wrong, next thing you know it, we
aren't allowed to breath our own air.

Oh how I WISH I could rent this recorder, but until the corporate world
rents what I need, I have to just rely on walmart because they are so
understanding. I'll say it again, the corporate world makes the rules,
we just live by them. I am at their mercy so I just study the rules and
obey.

So if they didn't want to accept certain things (like they DO spell out
Sony products are not returnable), they would have a policy saying so.
I'm a firm believer that there are hundreds of high level, high paid
managers that think of these policies to maximize the profits of the
company. (and someone thought of the sony exclusion) And if a policy
turns out to be not profitable, they will change it. Also don't forget,
for the x times someone returns something, I'm willing to bet the amount
of things that flow out of walmart greatly exceeds the amount that is
returned. I haven't checked out walmart's stock, but I bet it's not
doing too badly. plus what's wrong with a discounted returned item? It
gives another person the chance to own something they may not have had
the chance to own when it was full price. Aren't I actually doing this
person a favor ;)

I agree in your case you should have gotten the restocking fee. And
actually I think you will find it better now that you have a written
policy just in case she comes back. It's safer for everyone to just
point to the sign and say &quot;see, that's the policy!&quot; They do that at
work all the time. (or at least when it suits their needs)

PS Stan would not approve of your inaccurate email address...but I'm
sure you care just as much as I do. :)

This sure has been fun but I guess no one can really answer my question.

before a sale is legally complete. The only way to &quot;inspect&quot;
electronics is to try it. That's usually impractical to impossible

In other words, under the UCC the default is that if you try the
thing out promptly, and it doesn't work out of the box, and you
return it promptly, they have to take it back, at least as an even
exchange.

That's the default, but if you were aware at the time of sale that

right to return defective goods.

&gt;Nonsense. You have 0 opportunity to test out the device in the store.
&gt;You have no objective assessment of its merits. Why, in the absence
&gt;of a total-satisfaction guarantee, would you risk taking it home and
&gt;finding that you disliked the way it worked? Sure, it might record,
&gt;but suppose, by design, it only uses 70% of the capacity of the disk,

&gt;be &quot;normal&quot;, but all make the product unsuitable for you. Why is that
&gt;not a legitimate reason for return?

&gt;Retailers have liberal return policies for a reason. If there's too
&gt;much risk on the customers' part in making a purchase, they won't buy
&gt;anything. Get the product in their hands, with the assurance that
&gt;they can take it back of they don't like it, and most likely they'll
&gt;keep it. And in those cases where the product is a real turd, it
&gt;SHOULD be returned as a lesson to the manufacturer.

&gt; Why do you think that car magazines do not give bad reviews on many

"/> Locally, someone was selling a 2001 Jetta Vr6 on Usenet. I read their
ad and then searched on Google for &quot;2001 jetta vr6&quot; because I'm sort of
idly in the market for a new (used) ride.

Man, I thought VWs were good cars. I couldn't BELIEVE the stuff that
Jetta owners say they have suffered. When you pay ~$30K for a car,
you'd expect it to work right for longer than a few months. Out of the
two dozen-or-so owner reviews I read, only two, maybe three, actually
liked their car. Everyone else was either enraged, digusted or
despairing. Many were treated like criminals at the very dealership who
sold them their defective scrap metal.

Pretty much everyone agreed that it was a real nice-looking lemon,
though.

Tie this information in with a next-door neighbor who had months of
similar horrifying experience with his Brand Spanking New Passat
(except that the dealership was apparently much friendlier to him than
it was to those Jetta owners) two years ago, and I can tell you what
kind of car I WON'T be considering when I'm ready to buy.

Still, the point is, all those people lost a LOT of money; in some
cases it sounds like they almost literally threw it away. Without a
return/exchange privilege, sellers need not be accountable for the
stuff they peddle and buyers can be victimized.

I worked in the camera department at our local Walmart, (the Devil),

asked. Replies were varied. &quot;Too complicated&quot;, &quot;Too simple&quot;, &quot;Too

What cracked me up were the 'customers' who would buy an expensive
digital camera, go on vacation, come back a few weeks later and return
the camera for a full refund. Full refund offset by the cost of double
prints of their pictures from the memory media. LOL

My advice is always, if your not sure buy it at Wal Mart, (the
Devil), you can always return it and buy it from good people later.

You know, I'm sorta disappointed my question never got answered after
all this time :( . I love lively discussion but this thread got nuts.
Now that I have my machine and it appears to be working as per the
literature and the 100000 reviews I've read (yes I'm not so stupid as to
not read reviews), I'm going to keep the thing. I was going to maybe
try to return it just to irritate you dissenting people but decided it
wasn't worth another week of my time. So I hope the people that were so
against me ensuring the machine did what it said can sleep better at
night knowing I'm keeping this thing unless it breaks down in the near
future.

And make sure you practice what you preach. If you think it's not right
to return things such as I described, I better not catch you in a store
with such a liberal return policy! It is a free country after all.

Now back to my wonderful new recorder.

Say, anyone know how to crack the macrovision so I can use Walmart's DVD
rental service to pirate DVDs and sell them on my street corner for 1/2
the price? And will walmart take back dvds that have been pirated? heck
maybe I can just use the machine 90 days, record everything in the world
then take it back &lt;sorry but I couldn't resist razzing you fun people
out there&gt; ;)

You can't be serious. The question AND title of the thread was &quot;anyone
ever return a DVD recorder to Walmart?&quot; Your 'answer' didn't address
the specific question because you never did return one to walmart
(remember, you refused to shop there and pay for my return privledges?)
By default I'm assuming the answer was no because no one said they
ever had. I didn't want to get into the theoretical policies. I wanted
actual real life experience and no one ever said they had returned one,
therefore no one answered the question in the affirmative but by the
lack of a positive response, I will assume the negative and that no one
has returned it to walmart.

Now I have to get going and unhook all these cables to go return this
wonderful machine. Gosh I already ripped off the UPC so I wonder if it's
in their policy to accept the return. I sense a new thread: &quot;anyone ever
return anything without a upc code to walmart?&quot;

Happy Monday and thanks for livening up my day :)

I know that I want to work there after hearing what great return
policies they have!!!! Darn, I could have gotten an employee discount if
I worked there couldn't have I? If I become an employee now, do you
think their policy would allow me to take the discount on something I

nope, here's the original post:

&quot;I looked at their web site and found no such exclusions but I was
wondering about real life experiences or hassles anyone may have gotten
trying to returnd a recorder.

I'm willing to pay more at walmart than an online retailer solely for
the possibility of me not liking the thing and wanting to return it.
Most online places exclude such returns or charge 10% so even with tax I
pay in person, I'm going to come out ahead with piece of mind.&quot;

I don't see that I asked what the policy was, I just asked if anyone had
any real life experiences. You don't seem to get that. Real life
experience with returning a specific piece of equipment is what I wanted.

Regarding your 2nd comment you said &quot;Nothing's wrong with changing your
mind, but why should I pay for it
(in the form of higher prices)?&quot; So I agree with you, you need not
pay for my returns in the form of higher prices. We both agree here,
can't you see that? Just don't shop at places where they have great
return policies.

As far as the posting not the way you want, the reason is I just want
you to be able to read what I have to say without having to go through
all the other stuff first. It's less effort expended on the reader's
part and I'm trying to save mouse wear for people. Every little bit helps!

_Car And Driver_) pull their punches. Nor are they reticent
about pointing out the shortcomings of otherwise-good cars.

issues that only become apparent over time, not necessarily in
the short period during which a car is under test by a magazine.
For example, _Car And Driver named the Focus the winner of its
annual 10Best Cars competition primarily because it was fun to
drive and had good interior fit and finish, not because it held
up under an extended, real-world test:

flogged pretty hard, but then, they get mechanical attention from
the manufacturers between tests.)

That sure was a pain to have to scoll down and read that message,
whatever it means. It wasn't even on topic, geez. I still can't perceive
how posting at the bottom and having to scroll is quicker than right at
the top. I had to scroll thru my old stuff to get to your posting and if
you had posted at the top, it wouldn't have taken so much effort to
scroll down :)

And thank you for continuing posting here. It's something for me to look
forward to everyday and gives me a smile!

Hope it's not too windy where you are and YES the dvd recorder is going
just fine, a beautiful thing indeed. No returns to walmart necessary.
Also I just found out circuit city price matches the walmart internet
price but because I feel so guilty about returning something, I won't go
that avenue.

I guess no one has yet returned a recorder to walmart &lt;sigh&gt;

Apparently there is a plonking epidemic here. I still don't know what
the term means and it sounds pretty stupid to me. Perhaps it is what
people who don't know the proper words use to express themselves?

Upon research I found one possibility: Why would you be saying something
about inferior wine in a DVD thread? This is a specific question so you
need not try to read between the lines. I am very curious as I seek to
expand my horizons which are obviously very limited since I don't know
such wonderful terms.

plonk ( P ) Pronunciation Key (plngk)
n. Chiefly British Slang

Cheap or inferior wine.

trimmed all this bottom stuff so you don't get confused.

As an aside, I don't see how rockets can have surgery performed on them.
Again, I did research  http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=surgery
and found that surgery appears to deal with humans and not machines but
I do want to thank you for stimulating my brain yet again with all these
new ideas and terms. And thanks for reading this whole posting, that is
quite considerate of you. I do appreciate your attention.

Mind you, I think it's childish. If you're going to killfile
someone, do it. Telling the person you're going to stop listening to
him doesn't seem very mature. Yet I admit I have sometimes succumbed
to the temptation.

Darnit Stan, now how can't I like you with a reply like that? I'm a free
speech person myself and you just confirmed you are too. I'll listen and
reply till the death of time herself! That's why I love talking back and
forth to you. I know I'll get an intelligent witty reply that can be
backed up by fact...most of the time :) I can't stand stupid people and
you have proven you aren't stupid so you got my respect with the tit 4
tat the past week.

Sorry about the lack of me knowing terms. I don't hang out here unless I
have a specific problem. When this thread started heading off kilter, I
just knew it would be one that would be fun and intriguing.

Now excuse me while I head back to sanity.
Your favorite top poster

"/> Agreed, and it's kind of pointless. Usenet filters, including killfiles
are fun, actually. Expecting anyone to care whether you use them is
well, pointless. Seems to me, anyway.

&gt;&gt;I looked at their web site and found no such exclusions but I was
&gt;&gt;wondering about real life experiences or hassles anyone may have gotten
&gt;&gt;trying to returnd a recorder.

&gt;&gt;I'm willing to pay more at walmart than an online retailer solely for
&gt;&gt;the possibility of me not liking the thing and wanting to return it.
&gt;&gt;Most online places exclude such returns or charge 10% so even with tax I
&gt;&gt;pay in person, I'm going to come out ahead with piece of mind.

"/>  I don't really like WalMart but.....
I bought a TV with a built-in VCR. Perhaps 6 weeks later I wanted
to see 2 programs at the same time, and was surprised to find the TV
would not display ONE problem and TAPE the other. Can watch only
channel you are taping.
Next time I was at WalMart, I decided to complain to the person in
charge
of that department. He said bring it back and we'll sell you a
cheaper
TV and separate recorder at about the same price.
I said I was not sure I even still had the receipt; he said,
doesn't
matter, bring it back anyway if you like.
[I didn't, because I have 3 TVs in the house and can tape on one,
watch on another, but was surprised at their willingness to accept the
return after 6 weeks, w no receipt.]
