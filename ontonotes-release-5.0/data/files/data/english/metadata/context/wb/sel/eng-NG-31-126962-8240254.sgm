If you block the aisle in the grocery store because you're blabbing with
someone you haven't seen in ages and you use said aisle as your gathering
place thereby blocking me from getting past the cake mixes and onto the
marinara sauce, I will ask you to move nicely the first time and if you
don't pay attention, I will ram you with my cart and smile sweetly as I'm
doing so.

If you are standing behind me in the bookstore and you are loudly cracking
your Juicy Fruit gum, I will give you a knowing look and if you don't stop
said cracking immediately, I will tell you that you're a cow.

If you go to the pool the same day I go to the pool and you are wearing a
bathing suit over which your dimpled gut tumbles like a bulbous mass of
bulging blubber, I will politely refrain from saying anything to you but I
will silently wish you would realize how disgusting you look in a bikini.

If I am driving in the right lane and want to pass in the left lane, and you
are driving in the left lane without any intention of passing anyone because
you are embroiled in an oh-so-important cell phone conversation, I will pass
you on the right and give you a glare that could melt solid iron.

If you take me on a date and in the course of our conversation you say &quot;I
thought I seen you other day&quot; or &quot;I don't know nobody in here&quot; or your jeans
have a permanent Skoal ring on the pocket, I will excuse myself to go to the
ladies' room and sneak out to hail a cab.

If you intentionally cut me off in traffic, thereby causing me to slam on my
brakes in order to avoid your rear bumper that's dangerously close to my
front bumper, I will flip you off and if you have a gun and you shoot me, I
will die happy.

This hereby ends my declarations of the day.

Well, I've never actually snuck away in a cab, and I don't see that many
Skoal rings, but I have run into the language issue on occasion. I figure
it's because I'm a country music fan, and redneck slang just seems to go
with the territory.

&quot;I'm a redneck woman, I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin', I say 'hey y'all' and 'ye haw!'
I keep my Christmas lights on, on my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters out there keepin' in country
Let me get a big 'Hell yeah!' from the redneck girls like me.
Hell yeah! Hell yeah!&quot;

Okay, I'm going now.

Y'all.
