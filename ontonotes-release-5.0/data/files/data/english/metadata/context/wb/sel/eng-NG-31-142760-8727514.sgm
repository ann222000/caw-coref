Fearful Courthouse Workers Wonder if Mold Infestation Led to Judge's
Death
Two studies performed at the historic David W. Dyer courthouse in
downtown Miami show there are significant mold and air safety issues at
one of Miami-Dade County's oldest courthouses and suggest that some
parts of the building are beyond repair.
The studies, which were obtained by the Daily Business Review, were
commissioned by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of
Florida after former Magistrate Judge Ted Klein became ill and died
last year of a mysterious respiratory illness, and his fellow
magistrate judges raised concerns about the building's environment.
The David W. Dyer building is part of the Miami federal courthouse
complex and hosts magistrate court. Formerly the site of the city's
main U.S. post office, the building was constructed in 1933 of local
limestone and was once home to the U.S. Attorney's office and most of
the district court's judicial offices. It was added to the U.S.
National Register of Historic Places in October 1983.
The building is renowned for its Spanish style architecture and ornate
ceremonial courtroom featuring crystal chandeliers and an enormous
mural. Its basement once contained office space and living quarters for
deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega during his drug trial in the
early 1990s.
Several magistrate clerks, courtroom deputies and interpreters who work
in the building have complained of such respiratory problems as double
pneumonia, nasal bleeding and severe allergies. The situation is so
serious that some clerks have been given permission to work at home.
In an Aug. 27 memo, Chief Judge Federico A. Moreno, said a new study is
being commissioned by a company that performed mold remediation at the
West Palm Beach courthouse. That courthouse, damaged by Hurricanes
Jeanne and Frances, was closed for a year-and-a-half while mold was
removed.
&quot;Our intention is to have the consultant review prior testing results,
conduct additional on-site testing and then render conclusions about
whether occupancy in limited areas of the building is likely to cause
adverse health effects in occupants to a more serious degree than
exposure to fungal levels,&quot; Moreno said. &quot;Please understand that I, who
began his federal judicial service in the East Courtroom of the Old
Courthouse, share your concern about your work environment in the Dyer
Building.&quot;
Through a clerk, Moreno declined comment and said he preferred to let
his memo speak for itself. In the memo, he encouraged any employees who
have been in the &quot;sealed document vault&quot; -- a basement area heavy with
mold -- to consult their doctors. Additionally, he mandated that no new
sealed documents be taken to the basement, which is
being &quot;air-scrubbed,&quot; and that anyone handling records coated with what
appears to be mold use masks and gloves.
A copy of the 100-page composite report called &quot;David W. Dyer Building
Indoor Air Quality Testing Results&quot; was provided to all employees at a
meeting Aug. 9. They were encouraged to take it to their physicians.
According to employees who work in the building and did not want to be
identified, the building has not been adequately maintained for years
and was heavily damaged by Hurricane Wilma.
Indeed, a tour of the courthouse Tuesday revealed areas of ceiling
tiles falling in, furniture falling apart, old, musty-smelling carpets,
rusted water pipes and peeling wallpaper.
After Hurricane Wilma hit the area in 2005, buckets catching water
leaking from the roof were a staple in areas of the courthouse. A musty
smell permeates most of the building's upper floors. Some employees had
complained of burning eyes and respiratory problems for years. But they
became truly alarmed when Klein fell ill.
KLEIN'S ILLNESS
A healthy man who skied and jogged, Klein contracted a mysterious
respiratory infection and died in September 2006. At the time, his
family worried that something in the courthouse caused his illness.
Shortly after Klein became ill, the court commissioned the first fungal
contamination assessment, which was never made public. According to the
report dated July 2006, &quot;Magistrate Judge Theodore Klein has recently
developed adverse health effects that could be attributed to exposure
to molds. The assessment was performed to determine if fungal
contamination was present in areas that he frequently occupies
including his courtroom and his office areas.&quot;
The study showed fungal spores were present &quot;in significant numbers&quot; in
samples taken. However, the study concluded that these spores were not
likely to cause health problems unless someone was in an
immuno-compromised state.
Still, the study recommended that fungus on the plaster walls and
courtroom wallpaper be removed.
After Klein's death, his courtroom was closed off and remains unused.
His chambers are occupied by Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres, who
recently transferred from Fort Lauderdale.
&quot;Why would they close off his courtroom if it's not dangerous?&quot; asked
one employee who did not want to be identified.
It is still not known what caused Klein's illness because, in keeping
with Jewish law, his body was not autopsied.
NUMEROUS AILMENTS
Klein is not the only federal employee in the building to fall sick and
worry that the air quality was the cause. According to several
courthouse sources, the law clerk for Magistrate Judge Barry L. Garber
is very ill and has received permission to work at home. Garber
declined to discuss the issue until the new study is completed.
Another courtroom deputy who recently retired said she is very ill and
recently had double pneumonia. &quot;I'm scared to even go to my doctor to
see what the heck is wrong,&quot; she said. &quot;They are keeping everything
hush-hush,&quot; said a judicial assistant who did not want to be
identified. &quot;Everyone is scared. You don't know how much your immune
system can handle.&quot;
Another judicial assistant said she had no idea her chair was
mold-infested until she saw a photo of it in the report, which labeled
it &quot;mold-infested.&quot; She quickly found another chair in the office to
use.
Magistrate Judge Peter R. Palermo, who has worked in the Dyer Building
for 37 years, is not sick, but is concerned about his employees.
&quot;Who knows if there are health problems because of the mold,&quot; he
said. &quot;We just want to know if it's safe.&quot;
Palermo attended the Aug. 9 meeting held by representatives from Clerk
of the Courts Clarence Maddox's office to discuss the report. Neither
Maddox nor Moreno or any other federal judge was present. However,
Moreno has met with every employee to discuss the situation and is
getting high marks for his concern.
&quot;He's here in Miami and seems to care about us, whereas the previous
chief judge was in Fort Lauderdale,&quot; said one clerk.
An employee who has worked in the building for 32 years accuses the
courts of &quot;trying to cure the problem with Band-Aids.
&quot;They have not maintained this building at all,&quot; said the employee, who
said he has undergone surgery for nasal bleeding.
He said the problem escalated sharply after Hurricane Wilma, when the
roof became severely compromised and panels began opening, allowing
water to seep into the building.
Copies of the mold reports are available for viewing by the public in
the clerk's office.
The studies were done by CIH Environmental Solutions of Miami.
