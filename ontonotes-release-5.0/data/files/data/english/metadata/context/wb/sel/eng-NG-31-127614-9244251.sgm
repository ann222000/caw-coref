To:

*Dear Friend and investors, I attached an good article of property market
review for your refereence.
*

*
*

*Introduction*

As though they had planned this for a long time, in October 2007 the
Singapore government, not once but twice, 'flexed its muscle' against
property purchasers purportedly to keep property prices in check against a
backdrop of a comprehensive inflation, global financial market
uncertainties, dwindling supply of office space and prime residential homes,
and a large inflow of foreign companies into Singapore along with their huge
war chest.

In two swift and surprising moves, the government made into law the proposed
new *en bloc* sale rules which aimed to make *en bloc* sales tougher; and
later in the same month, it withdrew Deferred Payment Scheme for uncompleted
properties – a move seen as preventing a property bubble and a prelude to
more things to come.

Below describes the 'nerves of the market' after the respective government
initiatives had been announced.

* *

*(A) Uncertainties reigns in October market*

§        *(A.1.) 2208 may not be as good – projected 4-6% growth*

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said that for the first time in
four years, Singapore faces a very uncertain outlook for 2008 due to high
oil prices and the chances of further turmoil in the global financial
market.

The economic sectors that powered Singapore ahead this year – property,
wealth advisory and capital markets – are likely to be subdued due to the
above-mentioned negative factors.

Among the domestic asset market-related activities, financial services are
expected to continue to perform well in the last quarter of the year. But
equity trading activities may slow down in 2008. Domestic debt market could
also be dragged down by a more tentative mood amid lingering concerns over
the credit market. Demand for wealth management services may be affected as
a result.

Prospects for the construction sector are very promising, as many projects
will reach completion stages and payments will be forthcoming.

However, the Asian region will continued to be spooked by the uncertainties
in the US. Exports and growth will be affected by the situation in the US.

§        *(A.2.) Oil spike threaten to shave off Singapore's GDP growth*

Crude oil surpassed US$90 a barrel in late October. This will push up
business costs in Singapore, noticeably in wages, rents and daily
essentials.

One of the vital counter measures taken by Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) was to gradually strengthen Sing dollar to avoid importing inflation
from outside. However, if oil prices continue to increase unabated, MAS will
have to tighten the measure further.

Every US$10 increase in oil prices from the current levels would shave
Singapore's GDP growth by about 0.5 to 1 percentage point. Singapore's GDP
growth this year is estimated to be between 7% and 8%. (22 Oct)

§        *(A.3.) US may go into recession next year*

Although sub-prime mortgage assets account for only 14% of all securitised
assets in the US, the crisis has become the largest economic problem in
three decades. If it drags on, Asian economies will be similarly hard hit
like in 2001.

In the first half of 2007 and before the sub-prime mortgage crisis reared
its head, US consumption accounted for a record 72% of GDP, or about US$9.5
trillion.

Now that the economy is hit by the mortgage crisis, consumer spending may
drop drastically. If the US consumers start to save, nobody on the demand
side can fill the big shoe.

The root of the problem is that the high consumption in the past few years
were not supported by rising income but by a wealth effect which was caused
by a property bubble that has now burst.

The ballooning effect has all but disappeared and it is now unlikely for US
consumers to extract equity from their home with prices still going through
a free fall.  (18 Oct)

§        *(A.4.) With s strong Sing dollar more liquidity is expected*

However, the mixed signal comes from a strong Sing dollar. Interest rates in
Singapore are going to stay cheap for some time. This is because the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has announced that it will raise the
pace of Singapore dollar appreciation to counter imported inflation. The
move will lead to higher money inflows and will benefit home buyers,
consumers and corporate borrowers.

Instead of a higher interest rate to combat volatility of the financial
markets and the increased chance of a recession in the United States,
borrowers will now enjoy lower interest rate as foreign funds began to flow
back to take advantage of a strong Singapore dollar.

There will be higher liquidity in the local market which will continue to
keep interest rates and cost of borrowing low.

A stronger Sing dollar will make people want to invest in local equity
markets as they will get both capital and asset returns. (12 Oct)

*(B) Government passed new en bloc rules to dampen collective sales*

§        *(B.1.) New collective sale rules took effect on 4 October*

* *

The Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Act, enacted by Parliament on 20
September 2007, took effect from 4 October 2007.

The new rules aimed at making the sale process more regulated and
transparent. More stringent conditions would have to be met, such as setting
up of a Sale Committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EOGM) and be
endorsed by at least 50% of the residents. A new five-day cooling-off period
after signing the collective sale agreement was also introduced.

The changes will apply to all developments that have not obtained the
mandatory majority consent from at least 80% of owners by share value, or
90% for estates less than 10 years old.

Full details in attachment – *Annex A*

§        *(B.2.) En bloc sale volume dwarfed in third quarter*

Having been primed, *en bloc* sale volume had already nosedived in the third
quarter even before the new *en bloc* laws were made official. From July to
September of 2007, only 24 sites worth a total of $1.96 billion were sold
compared with 51 sites worth $6.92 billion in the second quarter.

The cautious mood in the collective sales market was due to the global
credit tightening, the higher price tags and the two hikes in DC rates in
July and September 2007. (The July revision was *ad hoc* and aimed to douse
the *en bloc* sale fever)

For the first time since 2006, the residential investment sales only
accounted for $2.9 billion or 21.4% of the total investment sales in the
third quarter.

The cautious mood in the third quarter had caused the residential investment
sales to nosedive 68.3% from the previous quarter. (16 Oct)

§        *(B.3.) Mad rush to meet new collective sale rules *

As there was earlier no mention of the actual start date for the new *en
bloc* rules, the sudden announcement caught many real estate agents by
surprise. And what ensued was a mad rush for signatures. They had to knock
on doors and cajole owners right up to the last minute.

Some of the projects got their go-ahead at the eleventh hours, such as the
Newton Lodge when the last signature was faxed from Shanghai a few minutes
before midnight. Chestnut Ville in Upper Bukit Timah had the last signature
appended at 10pm.

Three prospective *en bloc* projects which barely made it were Amber Park,
Thomson View and Villa delle Rose.

For those who have missed out the deadline, such as Clementi Park, Pine
Grove and Botanic Gardens View, they would have to restart the process all
over again under the new rules. (7 Oct)

§        *(B.4.) Only one collective sale site sold – District 19 Toho
Garden*

District 19 Toho Garden, a condominium on Yio Chu Kang Road near the
junction of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 and Hougang Avenue 2, has been sold *en bloc
* to GuocoLand for $62.5 million or $594 psf ppr, inclusive of a development
charge of $9.8 million.

The site has an area of 86,900 sq ft and a plot ratio of 1.4, which gives a
maximum height of five storeys.

However, the other 17 collective sale projects in other parts of Singapore
are not as fortunate. See details of other *en bloc* project in Annex B. (22
Oct)

Details of other *en bloc *projects – *Annex B*

*(C) URA launched more land to meet increasing demand*

* *

In fact, more individual plots of vacant land were officially launched for
tender in October than any other months this year. Below outlines the
information:

§        *(C.1.) Simon Road plot near Kovan Melody attracted fierce bidding*

The URA land sale of Simon Road was awarded to Duke Development, a new
property development company set up by former UOB Kay Hian brokers, amidst a
fierce tender which included property bigwigs such as Far East Organization,
Hong Leong Holdings, Frasers Centrepoint and Allgreen Properties.

The 190,000 sq ft site near Kovan Melody went to the top bid of $290 million
or $437 psf per plot ratio. The breakeven point will be about $800 psf. To
be profitable, the developer must sell above $900 psf. (3 Oct)

§        *(C.2.) Jurong East land parcel for tender*

URA has launched the tender for a 2.2-hectare site flanked by Lakeside MRT
Station and LakeHolmz condo. The site can be developed into around 680
apartments averaging 1,200 sq ft.

The site is estimated to be worth about $300 psf ppr. The breakeven cost for
a new condo should be about $650 psf and the average selling price should be
around $700-750 psf.

A vacant plot of land near to Lakeshore has been earmarked for an
International School. That may prompt more developers to bid for the land.
(18 Oct)

§        *(C.3.) State resumed sale of in-fill sites to meet rising demands*

For the second time in history, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) released
in-fill
