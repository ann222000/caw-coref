Who says that Rylance is golden?
Hannah Betts

LAST WEEK saw a return to that most hoary of Shakespearean chestnuts,
the &quot;Whodunnit&quot; controversy. Couldn't be the Bard himself, oh no, that
would be too obvious. Besides, he was just some Midlands scumbag. No,
it had to be someone really fancy - Francis Bacon, the Earl of Oxford,
Elizabeth I, or some sort of jobbing sub-committee featuring all
three. Ignore the fact that Shakespeare's modest background marked him
out as precisely the sort of young buck who made it big on the
Elizabethan literary scene. Ignore the fact, as evidenced in James
Shapiro's fascinating new study, 1599: A Year in the Life of William
Shakespeare, that evidence for his authorship is all about. Better
rather to drum up some spooky, class-based mojo that takes our nation'
s most distinguished literary figure and puts him back in his tawdry
provincial box.

It is ironic that these most imaginative of critics cannot for a
moment credit imagination on the part of the man who gave the world
Hamlet, Falstaff and Lear. On the face of it, it is also ironic that
this latest debunking should come from the Globe, that kitsch barnacle
of Shakespeariana tucked under Blackfriars Bridge. Mark Rylance, the
theatre's outgoing artistic director, shows no compunction about
biting the hand that has fed him and his company for the best part of
a decade. For, in so gnawing, he can drum up a bit of publicity and
plug the theatre's forthcoming conference on these conspiracy theories
(its second in as many years).

Rylance may enjoy taking a pop at Shakespeare, but he has done
extremely well out of him during his stint at the Globe. Despite the
theatre's vaunting of its freelance casting director, Rylance has
succeeded in securing many of the venue's plum roles. Nor, indeed, is
he above taking on the Shakespearean mantle where it can be used to
gesture towards his own artistic status. This season, to mark his
standing down as director, he plays Prospero, the part in which
audiences have long understood the playwright's own valediction to the
stage to be expressed. It is an indulgence that other directors have
allowed themselves (Peter Hall in his 1988 departure from the
National, not least), but none who has left such a lamentable legacy.

For, as audiences at this season's late plays will be able to judge,
the house style that has evolved under Rylance's aegis is as distinct
as it is idiosyncratic. With a few notable exceptions, the policy
appears to be to play unremittingly for gimmickry and laughs. The goal
of accessibility has become confused with some sort of crass pantomime
in which knowing winks and self-parody are substituted for poetry and
pathos. Slapstick rules, in addition to buttock-clenching bits of
business with the audience and a hearty hoofing it up at the play's
close.

This summer's ghastly Pericles exemplifies this (non) aesthetic
perfectly. The production is a relentless mishmash of accents and
gross ethnic stereotypes; a self-indulgent shambles in which
cartoon-style hamming is favoured over anything approaching more
rounded performances. Thus Boult, the whoremonger's servant,
brandishes a bolt (phallic pun intended) every time his name is
called. Thus an incestuous tyrant demonstrates his credentials as an
incestuous tyrant by rhythmically grinding a grotesquely padded
crotch.

The result is a (loosely) Shakespearean My Big Fat Greek Wedding, only
considerably less tasteful. Indeed, so unremittingly does the
production fall back upon a principle of larking about that, when
presented with the prospect of a virgin being about to be raped by a
blunt instrument, the audience falls about laughing - not edgy,
uncomfortable laughter, but great guffaws of hilarity as the
child-like victim cowers centre stage. Nowhere is there the redemptive
quality that generations of readers and spectators have discovered in
the late plays, merely irredeemable tomfoolery.

Indeed, the production, and the venue at large, wear their crassness
on their sleeve. At one point, Patrice Naiambana, as Gower, takes one
of several time-outs from the text to assert: &quot;We don't do art here.
This is the Globe. We do life. If you want art go to a museum.&quot; Later,
the same actor apologises, leeringly unapologetically, for the play
being &quot;low-brow&quot;. One does not have to be any sort of elitist to feel
that the term fails to do justice to the performance's depth of
vulgarity.

And that's another irony about the Globe: not only do its masters not
believe in Shakespeare the man, they do not seem much interested in
what he wrote. Whether in its gabbled mini Tempest or the direful
Pericles, the text is disregarded for (admittedly impressive)
acrobatics, or effusive, mid-action declarations that: &quot;We want to
make poverty history - yeah?&quot; This leads us to the theatre's utmost
irony - that, by appearing to champion inclusivity, the Globe has
become the ultimate exclusive venue: excluding Shakespeare as author,
genuine Shakespeare enthusiasts, even the script, where it can. In
striving to &quot;bring people to Shakespeare&quot;, the Globe is succeeding in
pushing ever more of us away. Not that it ever has a problem with bums
on (or off) seats. But, then, harnessing tourist traffic does not a
compelling aesthetic vision make.

Next season brings a new artistic director, Dominic Dromgoole of the
Oxford Stage Company, who has dismissed his predecessor's claims about
the authorship issue with an emphatic &quot;Baloney&quot;. Perhaps we can take
this as an indication that he will follow a more discerning path -
think outside the chocolate box, as it were. Rylance, though clearly a
man of terrific energy and charisma, will, for all the wrong reasons,
prove a difficult act to follow.

Shakespeare is more of a scared white doe
------------------------------­------------------------------­-------
1850 Melville: &quot;In Shakespeare's tomb lies infinitely more than
Shakepeare EVER wrote. And if I magnify Shakepeare it is not so much
for what he did do but for what he did not do, or refrained from doing.
For in this world of lies, Truth is forced to fly like a scared
white doe in the woodlands; and only by cunning glimspes
will she reveal herself, as in Shakespeare..&quot;

By all means, put him back in his tawdry provincial box:

&lt;&lt;Of the time of The Tempest's composition, Karl Elze states:

&quot;all external arguments &amp; indications are in favor of the year 1604.&quot;

One of his points is that Jonson paraphrases &amp; satirizes
the play in _Volpone_ of 1605.&gt;&gt;. p. 741 CO2

Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens

And when old Fezziwig and Mrs Fezziwig
had gone all through the dance; advance and retire,
both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey, CORKSCREW,
thread-the-needle, and back again to your place;
Fezziwig cut -- cut so deftly, that he appeared to WINK
with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.

Mr. Jingle's face gradually relaxed; and something distantly

While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the QUEER, painted face of

none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever WINK; but presently
the figure NODded its head to her in a friendly way.

JOYCE: Ulysses, Cyclops

Terry came down and tipped him the WINK to keep quiet, that they didn't
want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.

So of course the citizen was only waiting for the WINK of the word and
he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and
the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with
him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for
the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that
and the other.

Frank (that was his name), 'tis all about Kerry cows that
are to be butchered along of the plague. But they can go HANG,
says he with a WINK, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.
There's as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it

Uncle Toms Cabin - Harriet Beecher Stowe

We men of the world must WINK pretty hard at various things,
and get used to a deal that isn't the exact thing.

&quot;A little piece ahead,&quot; said Sam, giving a WINK to Andy with
the eye which was on Andy's side of the head; and he added,
gravely, &quot;but I've studded on de matter, and I'm quite clar
we ought not to go dat ar way. I nebber been over it no way.
It's despit lonesome, and we might lose our way,
--whar we'd come to, de Lord only knows.&quot;
