I would like to deploy django on a hosting package that only includes
python (and php, perl). So it doesn't have django installed. I think i
already read this:
http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/fastcgi/#running-django-on...
about 10 times, but i still can't figure it out.

I only have access to my hosting account via ftp. I can't install
anything, but i know that python is already installed. So i don't know
the full path to my directory and i can't write it in mysite.fcgi (as
required in the above howto).

I believe i have to copy the django directory onto the ftp and then
specify this into the .fcgi, but i don't know how.

Any help appreciated!

wrong, you can install somethings like django and many other python
libraries

it's in the doc
you put the django directory in /home/user/pythonlib/ and then add
this directory to the pythonpath
for the fastcgi method:

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, &quot;/home/user/pythonlib&quot;)

You should give more data, how the server run python: cgi/mod_python ?
if your hosting package provides python it should &quot;support&quot; at least
some frameworks and give some help about setting up them...

alwaysdata.com offers a free 10Mo account, django is supported (0.96,
but trunk works too) with fastcgi (among other frameworks), It's fine,
easy, give it a look.

the problem with putting django in /home/user/pythonlib/ is that i
don't have ssh access. I only have ftp, and that ftp points to the web
root so i don't know the absolute path.

I don't know whether the server uses mod_python or not, but I'm
assuming it uses fastcgi.

This is the hosting plan: http://www.edomenii.ro/static,gazduire-linux-economic-romania,1.htm
(there's a UK flag at the top for English)
It doesn't mention anything about python in the faq/howtos, only in
the package details. Also it doesn't say anything about any frameworks
anywhere.

I tried putting django and a .htaccess and .fcgi in many different
ways(I specified the django path like you told me) , but i only get a
blank page where my application should be. The server loads for about
2 seconds the first time (i'm assuming this is when it spawns the
process) and after that, when i refresh the page it loads instantly.
Should I assume that fcgi is working.
Then which is the part that's not working?
