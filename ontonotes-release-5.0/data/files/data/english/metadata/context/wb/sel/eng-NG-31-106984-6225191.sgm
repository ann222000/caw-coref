Are people who declare themselves as self employed transferred from
ODSP income support to OW employment support program?
I'm quite frankly terrified of Ontario Works workers after having
been persistently harrassed by their CVP unit.

When self employed people file their taxes they are allowed to claim
1/3 of their "shelter" costs as a business expense.  Does ODSP then
reduce the shelter allowance by 1/3?

If a self employed musician spent 6 months at home writing music,
practicing and preparing for public performance and therefor did not
have any income to report would they be shuffled back and forth
between ODSP and OW?

Both OW and ODSP say you have to pursue income from all other sources.
Does that mean that Grants from the Performing Arts council would have
to be applied for if one declared themself to be a musician or artist,
and if they actually got a grant would that be deducted from their
ODSP/OW?  That would be a catch 22, as it's next to impossible to be
creatively productive when the fear of being homeless or starving is
immenant.

I'm so sad.  I had so much hope and faith when on FBA/Voc.Reh and
O.D.BENEFIT SUPPORTS funded music lessons, but that's changed to
ODSupportProgram and now there are no Benefits....all my efforts and
the support I received seem to be for naught...what a waste.
I wanted to be a self supportive contributing member of society to
the best of my ability but it seems that the commonsence
revolutionists didn't want a folkharpist in their midst.

Your being 'substantially disabled' is determined by the Disability
Adjudication Unit on medical grounds and they (and they alone) can
change it only upon review (if a review date was set).

Your 'earnings', be they from employment, self-employment, liquidation
of assets, winnings, or whatever may FINANCIALLY DISQUALIFY you from
receiving ODSP benefits for some period of time, but that in no way
alters your status of being 'substantially disabled'.

If your earnings / assets financially disqualify you from ODSP, they
will be far more than the earnings / assets required to financially
disqualify you from OW.

Cross-Eyed,
No, a self-employed person who is receiving income supports from
O.D.S.P. as a person with a disability does NOT get referred to
Ontario Works.  If you are on O.D.S.P. and want to be eligible for
business benefits, which include extra deductions for business
expenses and so forth, you need to work with the O.D.S.P. Income
Support Specialist in your region that deals exclusively with
Business Income.  There are two such specialist in Niagara and
they are both capable, competent human beings.  You will be
given a self-employment kit and given guidelines, such as keeping
your self-employment earnings separate from your personal income,
and reporting on a regular basis all income and expenses related
to your business.  A musician, for example, may need to rent
studio time, pay for CD production, purchase advertisements and
publicity for any appearances they may plan, as well as upkeep
of any musical and recording equipment you have ... earnings
can come from the sale of CDs, personal appearances, cover
charges at bars, as well as any souvenir items, such as T-shirts
and other memorabilia related to your work.

If you use your home for business-related, it has nothing to do
with O.D.S.P.  You still declare your total rent you pay to O.D.S.P.
(but check your home-business by-laws where you live and if
you live in subsidized housing, in-home businesses are still not
permitted the last time I had to deal with the issue).  But if you
DO and are ABLE TO run a business out of your home, you can
declare up to 25% of the total rent, utilities and other occupancy
charges on your home on your business income tax return.

Thank you Angela;
I fell through the cracks on this self-employment issue.
I was on FBA (mothers allowance) and referred to the vocational
rehabilitation assistance program for help to recooperate from a
nervous breakdown.
They had me assessed by a psychomotrist who confirmed that due to
severe non-verbal learning disabilities I was medically disabled and
therefor unable to be trained for the workforce in the normal
education system.
I scored high in creativity but low in logic and they approved
private music lessons and commissioned a harp (a celtic harp, not a
peddle harp used in orchestra's) paying the harp marker directly.
My lessons lasted for two years at which point Voc.Rehab. said I had
used up all my eligible hours for funding and my case was closed.
The harp that was made for me was useless...it continuously broke
strings and fell apart...the harpmaker said that epoxy glue he'd used
was a bad batch...it was in for repairs more often then in my home to
practiced on...I did not have any promotional material or the money to
purchase any.
By the time I convinced the harp maker that the tool of the trade
he'd made for me was impossible to use I'd forgotten much of what I'd
learned and he said he didn't think I was committed enough and didn't
want to spend all his time making a harp that wasn't going to be used.
In retrospect I think he took advantage of me. I've talked to other
students of his who confirm they think he deliberately halts the
progress of his students so he can keep them paying, once they've
committing to purchasing a harp.
He made me help him out in his work shop, sweeping and sanding to
prove I was dedicated before he would replace my harp. I asked him if
he'd take me on as an apprentice but he wasn't interested.
When FBA was changed over to OW/ODSP rather than grandfathering me to
ODSP my file was given to OW and I was accused of committing welfare
fraud for failing to report income from earnings....they had estimated
that I should be a self supportive musician and estimated my potential
earnings based on the earnings of other self employed harpists.
They say I am not entitled to anymore employment supports,
I cannot earn a damn penny playing the harp unless I can spend some
money on promotion, buying replacement strings, maintaining a vehicle,
and a telephone, business cards, posters, a demo c.d.....what's the
point of the past support if they pull the plug before I can actually
break into the market?
I'm so confused by all of this and I feel quite abondoned.

Someone told me that the rehab was theraputic and not related to
employability, so I should just enjoy myself, but I can't when
everytime I look at my harp I think I'm gonna be charged with
committing welfare fraud for failing to report it as an asset to OW
because it wasn't being used to generate income.
I feel like I've been set up by these system changes, not just for
failure, but also fraud charges, cause there's just no way I can use
it as a tool of the trade unless I have other employment supports
too.
I'm like a chef with a stove and no food.

If I didn't have children I care about who need me, I'd just kill
myself and save everyone from the burden of sustaining me.

(IF this post shows up from Cleverwit, it's not because I'm playing
tricks.
I finally figured out how to use this loggin, sign-in, password
protected computer....now it'll get upgraded, and I'll be redundant
again, story of my life!)

Employment supports isn't the best choice, as many people have applied
and waited up to two years for a response and were denied, which is the
subject of both a legal and ombudsman investigation for some regions.
Some regions may do better than others, but that is not the point ...

One does NOT have to go through employment supports to start a
business on O.D.S.P.  Employment Supports is for people who may
need assistance in getting their business started ... not everybody does.
Many people just come up with an idea and go for it and will not wait
the two years it takes around here to get any help.

I've been told I am not eligible for anymore employment supports.
I had an interview with my income support manager and she said she
wanted yet another assessment before she would committ to any more
support for me. She referred me to the March of Dimes. They do
mobility assessments. I don't need a scooter.
I really don't think I need anymore assessments. I've already had two
done with their chosen psychomotrists, one with Voc. Rehab/FBA and one
with the OW Workhope Project, as well in the hospital prior to
following medical advice and applying for Voc.Rehab. They all had the
same results...though showed some digression, probably due to age,
stress and poverty.   Those assessments cost the system a lot of
money...the assessors are making a upper-middle-class living.

The catch 22 is that if I do any busking or playing at open stages, in
order to promote myself, but do not earn any money, then they classify
my harp as an asset, not a tool.
I want to do something with my life...not just "lay around on the
couch eating bon-bons and watching T.V." to quote the asshole that
made these legislative changes....
The previous administration invested in me and now I'm like the
proverbial baby tossed out with the bath water.
My harp is a tool that I need to learn how to use and then use to
promote myself with prior to actually earning money with it...and
during the switch over from FBA to ODSP I was run through the wringer
and suffered a 23% loss in my monthly income support, because ... as
they said ...I was under investigation for welfare-fraud because they
had information from a reliable source that I failed to report income
from earnings and assets.

They even wrote something into these new guidlines saying that a
person with a tool must report the market value of any service they
barter or trade using that tool....How do you put a price tag on
making a beautiful contribution to the world in general in exchange
for a welfare cheque?
