* October 2007 Monthly Update - http://feedblitz.com/r.asp?l=25583750&amp;f;=84&amp;u;=3032142

What did FeedBlitz do in October?

Well, in October, FeedBlitz became the first ad-funded email newsletter service to to enable targeted ads to subscribers, the first email service to democratize email ad creation so anyone could create an ad, the first email service to share revenues with its publishers, the first email service to introduce auction-based CPM ad pricing, and the first ad service (I think anywhere - please correct me of I'm wrong) to make the current market bid prices visible to advertisers.

Plus we moved the database server around to make things faster.

Other than that, not much. How about you?

Seriously, though, since the ad network debuted earlier this week we have seen ad impressions double, the rate of blogger signups is increasing, plus we've simplified the signup and ad generation processes for both publishers and advertisers to make it easier to get started. It's still early days - don't expect to retire on your ad earnings just yet! - but watch this space. We have some innovative programs coming down the pike to really get things going.

One use of the ad network is to grow your circulation by advertising your own blog. Go to the Newsletter Center and follow the links to the sign up form code. There you'll find a URL that is your online signup form. Copy it to the clipboard, go to www.feedblitz.com/f?Ads and create an ad for your blog. Paste in your subscription page URL as the destination link for the ad, target it and voila! Done. Go on, give it a try. It's only $25 to start, and that will probably buy you 25,000 impressions if you start now before prices bid up too far. That's a fabulous deal to get your message in front of other subscribers in relevant locations reading relevant content. If you want to join the others who are monetizing their lists, there's a very simple 1 step process (pick your blog's category) to starting.

Meanwhile, October's metrics showed what can only be described as very robust growth over September:

- Circulation: 3,299,499 (up 14% on September)
- feedblitz.com page views: 1,999,745 (up 12%)
- feedblitz.com unique visitors: 786,221 (up 14%)
- Total messages sent: 31,957,801 (up 28% - see, I told you September was just a blip)
- Average messages / day: 1,030,897
- Peak daily messages: 1,624,010 (October 31)

If ever there was any doubt about the market acceptability for an ad-funded email service, these numbers pretty much blow that doubt away.

... yesterday at 6:33pm eastern the database was corrupted (that's not meant to happen with this software, of course, but there you are. Happen it did). We went through a complete backup / restore cycle and got it back running around 10:22 pm last night.

That turns out not to be the end of the story, unfortunately. Because of the data corruption, the restore only went as far as 10/26. The good news is that we have a backup from 3pm yesterday from which we can plug the gaps (for database types, it was double-write buffer and transaction log damage, so no: we can't just roll forward like you're meant to).

So we've taken the system down while we complete this last task. There will be some minor inconvenience for folks who created newsletters after 10:22 last night as your subscription signup forms will need to be updated afer the change. Everyone potentially affected has an email from me.
