What't the best way to get rust out of a '71 Blazer?

With a Broom.

I just took up the carpet in the back of my Blazer
(that I'm re-comissioning)
Ooooooo, what rust.

Back to the body shop
(I already did this once, trying to get a sticker...)

"/> I get my truck sprayed with oil every fall (just had it done last Friday).
I know it's not environmentally friendly, but my truck probably leaks more
oil from the crankcase than from the oil treatment, anyway.
I'm happy to day that I've got *NO* rust anywhere, and I attribute
that fact to the oil. Around these parts, the highways dept. uses a lot of
salt on the roads in winter, and this accelerates premature rust.
To your problem, I've got 2 cheaper solutions:

1) Best solution: get some sheet metal (galvanized) about 20 ga
(heavier if you've got *big* tin snips) and some (100) 1/8&quot; pop rivets. Also,
you'll need a rivet gun (of course) and about 10 1/8&quot; drill bits. The metal
is pretty cheap if you get it at a plumbing/heating supplier.

2) Get-your-sticker solution: Get some fibreglass cloth and resin, grind
the rust off with a wire wheel and lay the fibreglass.

Do you do that yourself?

What's the techniques for doing it right?

Do you do it each time you change the oil :)

I got my sticker today.
I'm SOOOO HAPPY :) :)

Does that mean ya wanna go play now Monta?

We are still considering trip on Thanksgiving weekend. I think Uhwarrie
Nat'l Forest here in NC is the targeted site. I have heard the trails
aren't too bad and it is central to the drivers.(So far 2 or 3 from SC
interested and you)

For everyone else: I am planning on doing some offroad stuff ;) on the
friday and/or saturday after thanksgiving. As I said above the proposed
site is the Uhw natl forest and the trails should be moderatly diff at
most. If you are interested please reply to me directly at
Tass ... @aol.com The people going so far are driving the following:
Stock S-10 Blazer, Stock S-10 King Cab, and maybe a mid 80's K-5 Blazer.
My ride is a 1972 GMC Jimmy with a 8000lb Ramsey winch so we should be
able to get ourselves unstuck. Anyhoo...let me know...I plan on giving a
trail report when I get back...

Ok, you guys have just about the right idea with the oil-spraying thing,
but what you are doing isn't really all that necessary.
Up here in Maine, some of us know all the tricks to preventing rust.
Our roads are constantly covered with road salt, which destroys our
cars completely in very few years, unless you get smart.
Can you believe I have a 10 year old car with no rust? Not even on the
exaust or underbody? No, of course you can't. It is commonplace
among the older folks up here though to have a rust-free car.

The technology to prevent rust is simple, costs little, and works. Period.
Just let a little chemistry do the work for you.
If you have an old car or truck, or better yet, a new one, do yourself
a favor and do what I do: install a sacrificial cathode.
A sacrificial cathode is a device that completely stops any rusting
action in its tracks, forever.

A cacrificial cathode is nothing more than a block of aluminum! All I do
is go down to the local metal shop and ask them to cut me off a slice
of aluminium off some solid stock that they have, usually a four inch
diameter solid cylinder of aluminum. You drill a hole in the center,
and install a steel bolt that is shiny to allow electrical current to
flow. I bolted this under my hood, in some place that was unoccupied
and allowed direct connection with the chassis. I had to sand down the
chassis area where I mounted it though, just to allow good electrical
contact. Sand down the aluminium block, though, on the side that will contact.
Bolt it to the chassis, and that is it.

In a week or so, you will open your hood and be amazed to see that the
block has gotten smaller. Actually, you will see that it will be
amazingly well-corroded. You see, the block acts like a cathode, drawing
the energy away from the materials that corrode your car (water and salt)
that are normally the cause of your car rusting. The rusting cannot
happen without some chemical energy, the aluminum block is attracting
all the ionic energy, so the rust can only occur in the aluminum block!
Isn't that neat? No, I'm not lying. No, I'm not trying to sell anything.
The only motive I have it to keep all the rustbuckets out of the
junkyards. There are some nice old cars out there that would still
be on the road if their bodies hadn't rusted out.
You will have to replace the aluminum block and clean off the contact
point every so often, but your car or truck will never rust. What the
hell do you have to lose? No, it won't drain your battery or electrical
system either. In thirty years you will have a rust-free car or truck
to show off in a museum. Just try my trick, it works.

"/> Wrong! What you're talking about deters electrolysis, which is a form of
corrosion caused by ions.

Theres only three ways to prevent steel from rusting:
1. alloy it with soething like chromium/nickel (stainless)
2. coat it with a sacrificial metal (galvanized)
3. seal it from the air and water (paint, oil, tar...)

Up here in New Brunswick (I'm about 50 miles from Maine), we weren't
born yesterday.

yup, but aluminum oxidizes rapidly and the thin coat of aluminum oxide is
very impermeable (if I remember my chemistry) a hunk of zinc works, too though.

"/> Gee, thanks for the invite.

I think I'm gonna be tied up with family business though :)

I'll let you know.

If I don't make it I want a full report when Ya'll get back.

I've done a couple of short shake out runs.
The only thang shook out so far is my battery.

I've been writing up my adventures in re-arming
my truck. I'll post some of it if anyone is interested.

Later,

Monta...Let us know what all you have done so far. I know we would all be
interested. BTW a mssg or two back you wondered if they were making fun
of your truck.....Nope.....he has a blazer which sounds alot like yours.
Maybe we should form the Blazer/Jimmy Club!! ;)

I hate that ya can't make it for the Thanksgiving trip. I need to contact
the other guys to make sure they are still going. Take a look at your
calender sometime, maybe we can get together later.

Hmm...maybe ya should bolt that battery down! ;D
