You Don't Have To Pay Taxes in the U.S.

Ever heard of &quot;No Taxation Without Representation&quot;? It applies to
everyone who did not vote for George Bush in 2000 and in 2004 and
here's why. Thousands of voters were denied the right to vote in these
elections and that has already been proven. If their votes were not
counted, then none of our votes had the impact they would have had in
a fair election. Therefore, none of us have representation and none of
us are bound by taxation.

This expert opinion was written after the Center for Constitutional
Rights tried to take Don Rumsfeld to court in Germany for war crimes.
It proves that we are paying taxes to a government that has made
themselves immune from breaking the law.
http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/september_11th/docs/ScottHortonGermany...

How can you continue to support a criminal administration that has
made law to immunize themselves from criminal activity? You have every
right to cease paying criminals to spend your tax dollars for criminal
behavior that they can never be accountable for committing. The only
answer is to proceed without them and in spite of them.

We are starting a new government at the PCO and we will never use your
tax money to fund a corporate war. Pay your taxes to an organization
of social justice professionals that will use tax money only for
peaceful and environmental purposes. If you want to join the tax
protest movement, the PCO wants to help you. Send an email to us at
taxprotest at politicalcooperative dot org and we will make sure that
your tax protest is defended. We have to face the facts - the neocons
will use any lie they can come up with to steal elections, steal land,
and deny justice. The war in Iraq is a corporate war for corporate
profit - is that what you want your tax money to pay for? It is time
to stop pretending that democracy is alive in America - it has been
bought and there is nothing left to do but start a new government with
people who have already proven what they stand for. Join us. Click
here to read about the history of tax protesters in response to war.
While war is one reason to refuse to pay taxes, this administration
has committed many additional crimes that demand our action to stop
them in any way possible.

Try again. No taxation without representation was a rally cry during
the rebellion in 1776. It is
not part of any law in the U.S. And what it meant was that the people
living in the colonies had
no say in who, or how, the colonies were administered by the King of
England. This in no way
applies to our situation today.

Well, it could be argued that while the Constitution doesn't
specifically address &quot;taxation without representation&quot; its
whole purpose was to define a government in which as many
individuals and populations as possible *were* represented
(with checks and balances to prevent, among other ills, the
sort of mob rule later seen after the French Revolution), so
I'd have to argue that representation for the taxed *is*
Constitutionally enshrined, by its overall content if not by
specific wording.

Excellent points, all of which support my statement that the
content of the Constitution, while not specifically stating
that there would be &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;,
was written so as to provide for representation of those
taxed to the extent feasible, by providing for both
representation and direct taxes of the same population.
There's a fairly good entry regarding the Constitutional
meaning of &quot;direct tax&quot;, which supports your post, here:
