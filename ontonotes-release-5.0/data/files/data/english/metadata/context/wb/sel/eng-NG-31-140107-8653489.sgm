I think it is because we are looking to punt Lovell if we can before
Friday.

Kenny - can you comment on the introduction of Young? Why not move Mackie
back into midfield and put Lovell on?

If we're going to punt anybody, it should be Lee Miller.

How many chances will this guy get ? First thing he did after coming
on was to fall down and appeal for a free-kick. At that point I
thought 'oh oh. I know what's going to happen here'.

And it did, we hardly won another 50/50 ball in their half.

Partly Calderwood's fault though. Just when we needed to up the
momentum and take the game back to Hibs, he puts on the laziest player
in the SPL. We should have brought on young Maguire to take the ball
and run at them, beacuse their defence was utterly useless.

Nope, we insist on playing a long ball and 20 seconds later Hibs are
back at the edge of our box.

In a way, I'm glad Brewster has left because Calderwood has done
nothing other than talk about 'target men' since the start of the
season. He seems obsessed by getting the ball up quickly to a big
forward (either Brewster/Miller), and laying it off to Mackie.

What about the option of playing it on the ground through the midfield
Jimmy ? we seem to have forgotten about that one, and because of that
our best natural finisher (Lovell) is being overlooked in place of
workhorses like Mackie and Brewster.

I'm still waiting to see if De Visscher is going to be used in any
form once he's fit. I doubt it, because the guy doesn't seem to be
defensively minded so he'll be no use in our midfield.

I'm rapidly losing patience with Calderwood and his baffling selection
and tactical policy.

I reckon he's still on a 'honeymoon' period because of the excitement
of Europe coming up. However, if/when we get turfed out of that, and
if there's no significant improvement in results, the natives will be
getting restless pretty quickly I'd reckon.

Jimmy's crunch games will be the easier run we have after Killie, coupled with the UEFA ties. If we get humbled (aka totally embarrassed) in that, and fail to win the majority of points against the so-called diddy teams, then Jimmy's job will be teatering on the edge I feel.

The time has come for him to prove his worth as a manager - not based on the ability to scrape and fight for wins. We need to see some sort of progression being made in our style, formation, tactics. I've seen little of note in the last 3 years to show me Jimmy has any sort of master plan in these areas, and even a full 3 seasons into the job, he still looks like a little boy lost at times with tactics and formations. That to me is a worrying trend. Does Jimmy have some wonderful style of football hidden up his sleeves, but just afraid to use it in the SPL as it's mainly results driven? I'd rather we struggled for a season and developed into a passing team, than get in the top 6 each season, watching absolute guff each week (which is what it mainly is I'm sorry to say).

Had to pay at gate and sit in hibs side of the away end on Saturday
unable to celebrate any of the 6 goals on show.

Great value for money. The dons looked very good for quite sizeable
spells of the game.

If anything I felt we lost goals from them getting behind the back line.
If we'd sat even deeper that would not have happened.

I would have been happy to see the team re-organised into a 5-5
formation after going 3-1 up but we seemed to leave positive players on
the park in Smith, who can't tackle, Foster, not really a defender and
got swapped for J-Mac instantly, Dung, utter cack, Miller, hides up
front...

The back seemded not as tight as it could have been and would have been
happier to see 5 put there with someone sweeping given we got about 1
offside all day.

Seve was average. Too many misplaced passes, landing on his ass and
moaning, no chat to our players or visible encouragement.

Nicholson was superb. Clark decent. Mackie a nuisance and should maybe
have scored (if he'd been slower he would have) Souter? Hard to tell
without seeing the replays. You would expect to score 3 and win the
game.

I'm encouraged and far from thinking Jimmy is on the way out. If he can
settle with team selections and realise he doesn't have to use every sub
we'll settle into a good run.

I was there too, can only echo the sentiments of others that it was cracking entertainment.  Only wish the last 20 minutes hadn't been.

There was a point in the match where we were almost taking the pi$$.  Hibs looked to have gone and we were cutting them open at will.
The calamity keeper actually saved well to deny Brewster a hat-trick and I'd need to see the Mackie chance again to determine whether it was a shocking effort or he was just unlucky when Clark played it in beautifully.

As happens so often though when you're two goals ahead, the dandies let the other team back into the game with a goal that was riddled with errors on our part, despite a good finish by the impressive Fletcher.

After that, the equaliser had a certain death and taxes inevitability - in fact the guy walked through without any of our defenders anywhere near him.

Not sure if the collapse was down to fitness, attitude, injuries (Diamond/Seve), tinkering or just Hibs having lots of very good attacking players on the park............but what would have been a good result before the match feels a bit like a defeat.

I think Miller is rapidly becoming a boo boy target, and I think that is unwarranted as the tide had turned and our whole team had dropped off by the time he came on.
I recall him being very good before Brewster arrived, and hope he can get back to that.  I would give him a run of games, but get decent service from wide areas rather than just lumping it to him.

Darren Mackie.... well over 360 mins of football action so far this season and no goals to show for it. By all accounts, pretty shocking display on Saturday. Time for a spot on the bench or is he really Calderwood's illegitimate son?

Brewster away - what now for our front line? Lovell hardly kicked a ball after a great end to last season - are we to expect him to be snapped up and let go before Friday night? From a position of looking like we had the strikers dept all sussed out, we now look pretty effin lame if you ask me.

Discuss.

Lovell must wonder what he has to do to get a game, Mackie plumbed new
depths of uselessness on Saturday! We were three one up and coasting when a  chance
to finish off the match presented itself and Mackie decided to tackle
himself from point blank range and appeared to me to actually sit on the ball,
perhaps it was the ball that knocked him over, either way, the guy next to me
said that's the turning point of the game and he was right! From what should
have been four one up we ended up struggling to get a draw!

A spell in the reserves for Mackie a run in the team for Lovell and the  last
20 minutes for Maguire!

Sorted!

I didn't think Mackie had a bad game on Saturday.

He was right in the faces of a fairly nervous Hibs defence the whole game and worked very hard, alongside a classy but immobile Brewster.

I'd have to see the Clark cross again to decide whether it was an awful finish or he was just unlucky that in actually gambling at the back post (for once), he got too far in front of the ball.
But Mackie is what he is, and probably wouldn't be near the first team in a more 'technical' league.

To me it's horses for courses with our strikers. On Saturday, we needed Mackie to run the legs off the Hibs defence and it worked to an extent, with Nicholson and Smith getting a lot of space.
In the winnable home games, we surely have to play Miller and Lovell - as well as maybe De Visscher when he's fit.  We need more finesse and have to start creating more.

I'm not that bothered Brewster's leaving. Despite being very impressed in the last couple of games, I don't think he did that much last season and probably hampered the progress of one or two others.

Mackie didn't have a bad game IMHO anyway. If anything its good he is
leaving on a high and the others can see what is possible. Miller should
be looking at his touch and presence and trying to learn from that but
add pace.

Mackie was a pain in the neck and won the ball from nothing a few times
on Saturday. The hibs fans around me were hating him.  Their left back
was put off on numerous occasions by his presence.

Had Brewster and Lovell/Miller played up front their defence could have
taken ages to line up passes forward

I would like to think if Lovell would chase lost causes a bit more he
would be the real deal for us.

Mackie would struglle to get a game for Inverurie Loco's, his first touch

It's just the way football is going Trev.

Why do Scotland go with Kenny Miller up front in a lot of games, especially away from home?   Why is Walter Smith reluctant to start with Kris Boyd, who can score goals with his eyes closed, but offers little else.

Steve Lovell is a our best finisher (but also capable of shocking misses - see Love Street/ Parkheid last season), but is a waste of a jersey in tough away games like Saturday.

Like Mr McDonald said - Mackie ensured the Hibs defence had a fairly torrid match...........and he's been a major part of the reason for our fairly decent record at Easter Road over the years.

Why is it that when a striker comes on as a sub for Aberdeen they:

A - Don't run about very much
B - Look like they would rather still be warming up
C - Have one good chance to score but never take it

If soemone would show the nuts to prove they are a greater asset than
Mackie I'd be all for replacing the little Miss Controller.

Tin helmet on here...

In Mackie's defence, he's the player who's suffered most from
Calderwood's bizarre tactical tinkering this season.

I missed the Yunited game, but in the other 3 I've seen Calderwood has
played him wide on the right almost every game. He kind of starts off
as a forward but either drifts or is deliberately pushed deeper and
wider as the games go on...ending up playing as a right midfielder.

Maybe things will change if de Visscher comes in, but I'm not sure.
For some reason Calderwood thinks the best thing to do is play with a
atrget man up front and Mackie wide for the knock-downs.
The more I think about it, the more I think that tactically we're
fecked....there's no intention of playing fast, on the ground,
football here...it seems all we're doing is swamping the midfield and
lumping the ball forward.

I'm confused, and I've no doubt Mackie and the rest of the players are
as well.

Mackie certainly seems to divide opinions - he gets my support.....and he's
local, so I'll cut him even more slack as I WANT him to succeed.  The
treatment of the guy by fellow dandies makes me cringe at times.

Much will be told from Calderwood's next Chess move in the transfer market. If he goes for yet another big, target man type player, his plan will be as transparent as George Bush's less than honourable invasion of Iraq.

Mackie was played up front with Miller for Utd and was utterly useless. Against Hearts, Jimmy decided 1 up front (at home) was the stuff that champions are made of. Against Celtic, he was supposed to be playing up front with Brewster, although he did cause a nuisance in the 1st half, he missed a couple of sitters and was generally p*sh in the 2nd. I think it was the Hearts game where he looked at his most appalling to me. He couldn't control the ball, pass it to a red shirt and gave off this lax attitude and general pishyness.

Last season, he bought many fans due to his tenacity but more importantly, his goals. This season, there's a distinct lack of either attribute and I, amongst thousands of others, cannot understand why this merits a starting place each week, other than what we've alluded to - he fits Jimmy's poor tactical game to a tee.

Let's take the locality and boo boy issues out of the debate though Paul for one moment.... he's proved absolutely nothing so far this season to suggest he is worthy of a place. Now, I thought we were supposed to have strength in depth this season and competition for places. If Mackie can roll up every Saturday or Sunday and get a 1st team place on the back of his previous weeks performance, what signal does that send out to Lovell, Miller and Maguire? Is it any wonder they look down in the mouth when they come on for the last 20 mins of matches where we're in the middle of throwing the baby out with the bathwater?

The worst performance I've seen from any Aberdeen player this season was
Lovell against Hearts.   He was the worst of a very bad lot that day.

I think Lovell will play in the coming weeks when we're hopefully dominating
the Motherwells, Gretnas, ICTs and St Mirrens, hopefully alongside Lee
Miller.......but it's clear why we play Mackie in games like Celtic and at
Easter Road.

Lovell can probably finish better than Mackie, but generally offers
absolutely f**k all else.   If he had played ahead of Mackie on Saturday, I
doubt the likes of Nicholson and Smith would have been anything like as
prominent.   The Hibs back line were constantly giving us back possession
due to the excellent way were closing them down.  The Kemnay loon was a huge
part of that and that attribute was perhaps more important in that type of
game than having the first touch of the gods.

As for Maguire........still don't think he looks ready for anything other
than the odd fleeting appearance.  If De Visscher gets fit, maybe Smith
could be better deployed as a striker in certain games.

As for the spare wage - hopefully we do use it - maybe on something just
that bit different.  Benjellouin and Zemmama for Hibs are both inconsistent,
but cracking players to watch.  Would be great if we could pick up someone
like that (remember how popular our last Moroccan enigma was) - even if it's
mainly for use as a subbie for turning dour struggles into three points.

Leave Mackie alone. He's fast, he's alert, he chases everything, defences don't like him, he gives 100%.

Goals will come. Not only do I like him, he's currently my favourite afc player and i'm disappointed if i go to a game and he doesn't start. If you want to blame something so far this season, blame Calderwood's ridiculous tactics. There's a real irony in his (very large) opinion of his own (non existant) tactical prowess. Blame the entirely ineffective Chris Clark or 'fall around' Miller, just stop making a scapegoat of Darren, he doesn't deserve it.

How many overpaid oil workers have you met who turn down another £500 a week to jump ship? Now just leave it, it's starting to eat at me.

Let's take the locality and boo boy issues out of the debate though Paul for one moment.... he's proved absolutely nothing so far this season to suggest he is worthy of a place.

So in essence, Jimmy is very much at fault for having a worker of a striker who unfortunately cannae hit the proverbial barn door with the coos erse, and a couple of strikers who can, but whose work ethics are questionable? Therefore, we do not have the complete striker who will work hard, close down players and score goals?

The issue that I have is that playing Mackie every week means you basically take one goal scorer off the team sheet. If his role is to close down players, then why can't we get the midfield to do this? Is it because most of them are deployed in holding or defensive roles? If his role is to harass keepers and defenders, get them to kick the ball away early, is this because the team lack the ability to close down the midfield and win the ball back under their own steam? If he's there to pick the scraps off of long balls over the top, is this because we have no real command to our play and we resort to &quot;route 1&quot; tactics more often than not?

Mackie for me is honest enough, and mostly hard working. But he's built a rod for his own back in that he fits Jimmy's role perfectly. In essence, we are venting our spleen on poor Darren when it's not his fault he gets picked every single week. He has been moulded into the type of player Calderwood wants up front and most of us don't seem to see the attraction in that. The vast majority of us want to see good build up play, good ball retention, intuitive attacking tactics that centre around the ball on the deck, getting it wide, supplying quality crosses and feeding a plentiful quota of chances to two able strikers (which we have). We probably don't want to see the ball played up to a target man to knock on, hold up and wait for support, or a headless chicken to chase lost causes.

What I'm effectively saying is that Calderwood's managerial style has pretty much bored us all to death and we can see that there's no progression to it. We're not utilising the creative players we have and we're not using quality, proven goal scorers in the way they have been used to at previous teams.

In many ways, it's like when you're young and growing up... you're learning to drive, pass your test and decide that a Citreon Saxo is the beez knees. After a few years though, you realise it's just a suped up puddle jumper and you could do with something a bit more refined, like an Evo or a Impreza.
We had our Corsa's, Saxo's and Foostie's in Miller, Ebbe and Paterson and we all thought that Calderwood would be our Evo or our Scooby Doo. It turns out all we really got was a K&amp;N filter, a big bore exhaust and a set of bigger alloys. Underneath the surface, it's still the basic model we're having to make do with. The question is, does Jimmy have the ability to go from Economy to Mid Class, or do we need someone else in to do the job for him?

&gt;Last season, he bought many fans due to his tenacity but more importantly,
&gt;his goals. This season, there's a distinct lack of either attribute and I,
&gt;amongst thousands of others, cannot understand why this merits a starting
&gt;place each week, other than what we've alluded to - he fits Jimmy's poor
&gt;tactical game to a tee.

Got this far and stopped laughing.  Clearly Mackie being top scorer and Lee
Miller managing 4 goals in 36 games (a goal every 9 matches) isn't basis for
Mackie playing before Miller and if that is the case then no point in even
discussing things!!

Miller and Lovell, played in a team where they are stikers, not holding players, and given chances, will win us games. Mackie is played in a formation and team that huffs and puffs and for sure, when we get in a position to capitalise on errors, Darren is not bad at mopping them up. But this is all dependant on the former tactic working. If we're going to continue this season with the same rubbish tactics and play, then we'd be as well sell Miller and Lovell before Friday and buy another Brewster and another heedless chicken type player.

In my opinion, your place in the team should be determined by your previous results. Mackie has failed to score in all starts this season and if I'm not mistaken, never scored in pre-season either. His form does not mirror Jimmy's obvious love affair with him. It seems pointless playing anyone else in any event as we're not set up to play with natural strikers. Is it any wonder Mackie seems to be the only one under Jimmy that seems to adapt to his style of play? We turn good fruit bad... serious problem indeed. Mackie in a Hibs team would be feckin lost. Mackie in a hun top or Celtic top would be run out of town. But yet he's an ever present in an AFC team..... go figure.

I really just want us to play decent football - and Miller with Lovell is by far the obvious choice for me in terms of playing guys that know how to put the ball in the back of the net, or I'm I forgetting what the objective of football is here?

Mackie was 5th top scorer in SPL last season and we finished third on the
back of these goals.  What more do you want?

To suggest 5th top scorer in the league with many assists, should be
replaced with 4 goals in 36 games striker to me borders on lunacy!!

I'm not getting into an argument about this, but I think you're being slightly blinkered about things. My main points are twofold:

1. Mackie has been tripe so far this season and doesn't deserve to start every game. Forget what he did last season or the season before - we have 2 points from 12. We need to score more goals (that much is evident)
2. Miller (nor Lovell) isn't played in the manner in which we get the best out of him. Miller looked good before Brewster arrived and ever since then, is played in a position where he's asked to hold the ball up for Mackie. Folk go on about him falling over all the time.... did he come here with a CV that stated &quot;is really good at holding the ball up, winning headers, just like big Crouchy does&quot;?? No, I doubt he did. But it probably says something more like &quot;give me chances and I'll score&quot;, as does Lovell's.

Are we set up to supply Mackie with chances or is his main job to set up others? Either way, it's not very effective and means that this target man issue sees us wasting possession more often than not.

So, before I retire for the night - ask yourself this. If Seve/Nicholson or Smith were going through a run of half a dozen stinkers... would you want them to retain their place or see it given to someone else who may prove they are more worthy?

Lovell and Miller... not Lovell and Mackie or Miller and Mackie. Two effin strikers played together for a few games - give it a go... who knows - we may start to win a few games more than we have been (nothing much to lose have we??)

Laugh all you want Stephen - plenty folk out there not laughing one little bit at the moment.

Come one - how many did Mackie score and how many were tap ins? Not really interested in the stat about 5th best striker. Nor am I bother about Miller's stat as I know from seeing him at Falkirk and on loan to Hearts that the lad has ability. Jimmy does not play him with someone to feed off of, make runs for someone else to read and play him in with. He seems to get lumped with Mackie, who couldn't see a decent run if it was emailed to him!

Like for like, in the tactics shown and with Mackie playing all the time, we're peeing in the wind playing Miller or Lovell as neither are holding strikers. That is what they are being asked to do. That is why some don't take to either or both players. Give Mackie a spell where he comes on for the last 15 but let's give Miller and Lovell a chance to work. Every time I've seen them together (which is like seeing an eclipse of the sun may I add) they have looked promising. But cultured football is not Jimmy's style I reckon - how dare we play the ball on the ground when the sky is a far better option!!
