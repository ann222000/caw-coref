***I was told that *The Long-Term Gay Marriage Guide*, by Montaigne and
La Boetie, foreword by Andrew Bacon, would be available this year from
the HLAS gift shop as a companion volume to the Sonnets. Has there
been a delay in publication? The Social Affairs desk of the City of
West Hollywood would like to order a gross.

***Similarly, the hoped-for DVD of last year's Thomas Crapper Memorial
Drama Festival (featuring the award-winning Crowley version of
*Hamlet*, Ibsen's *Pee-er Gynt*, and Etheredge's constipation comedy
*She Would If She Could*), which I hoped to give to my plumber as a
drain-, um, stocking-stuffer, seems not be be on the list. Will it be
ready for the 2006 list?

***I can, however, report that the travel book *A Visit to the 2006
Masonic Summer Conclave, with Revelations Proceeding Therefrom, and a
Guide to Beachside Fashion*, by one A.N., will be published once the
missing manuscript is recovered.

***Finally, the publisher tells me, with a heart-felt &quot;blimey!,&quot; that
the anticipated *My Life as a Buffalo*, promised as a &quot;thrilling tale
of an alternative existence,&quot; had to be cancelled because the author
lost interest.

Best Wishes,

26. Atlanta Nights, by Travis Tea

Rumor has it that Crowley, Innes, and Gangleri had something to do with
the work. I wonder which one of them helped write this beautiful moment
from Chapter 7?

Margaret and Irene sat in silence for thirty-two minutes, each
gathering their thoughts together, each afraid to say the first word,
knowing that the first word could lead anywhere, including the truth.
Irene signaled for a latte with one hand and fingered her long
blonde hair with the other twisting it again and again until it
spiraled like a golden staircase leading to the top of her head. When
the pain started, she wept, expostulating &quot;I don't know what I'll do
without Henry. He was the center of the world.&quot;
&quot;Even the center of the world has to die sometime.&quot; Margaret sat
sideways in her chair, her breasts a pair of protruding Alps.
&quot;He didn't seem like the kind of man who died,&quot; Irene said.
&quot;Sometimes, when were in bed, making love, at the very edge of the surf
where the waves washed over us again and again, I looked at his face
and saw something there that not even all the forces of erosion could
ever wash away. He was a determined man, and in his position he had to
be: and I knew that, too, looking up at him wanting only for him to be
there forever. He was old, you know: he was around in the seventies and
everything. But there was an agelessness to him, a beautiful eternal
foreverness that shone from him like the light from a lighthouse, or
like the sunlight from the sun. He made me feel like a child again, and
I wanted to stay in bed with him, feeling him warm my world, cooled by
the waves that washed over us, until the stars went out. That what I
expected anyway. That's what he promised. And now he's dead. His
heart's stopped.&quot;
Margaret's eyes darted toward Irene in expressive regard. &quot;Yes.&quot;

Lynne - Here's a little gift just for you - THE KOSITSKY-STRITMATTER
GUIDE FOR THE PARANOID complete with research assistance by their
little lapdog Marky Anderson. Mousie and Bassanio wrote each chapter
together, but each wrote a chapter alone that focuses on their special
talent. Mousie's chapter is called &quot;How To Skip Through Life Dropping
Little Posion Bombs and Keep Your Party Dress and New Shoes Clean.&quot;
Bassanio's chapter is called &quot;How To Fool Your Dissetation Committee
into Thinking that Underlined Passages in a Bible Are Important.&quot;

I know all writers take a day off from writing, but really Lynne, in
the amount of time you spent today posting here, William Shakespeare
could have written at least one act in any of this plays and have
written a rough draft of a second.

I hate to break it to you Lynne, honey, but I have never ever posted
anything under any name at The Fellowship site. I've been tempeted, but
have always stopped when I remember that the regular gang there have
their heads so far up their ass they can look out their bellybuttons.

OTOH, he could have decided on just a few words. Some people think that's
it! The quality of what's written is the important thing, rather than
dashing off a brilliancy like a cartoon genius marathon writer out of Monty
Python and Hemingway - a sort of manic Hank Jesus-Speare.

Of course, opinions vary. Perhaps anyone who could write the following:-

I worked pretty hard all week as well as most of last week in

several readings from tomorrow on. What does seaker do with his time, I
wonder. He seems to spend at least part of it trying to organize the
time and activities of other people.

I don't find hlas a waste of time usually. I've learned a lot and

How cheerful fit we take us all to our merriment this Christenmas! Strike up
a galliard and see here this good attempt which not quite reminds me of
Chaucer in his cups:-

Messengere, y prey the do me ensewre
That thous wylt never me dyskever.

And Gower spoke:-

For I wol knowe be thy tale
That thjou hast dronken of the dwale.

[Dwale [v.], a Devonshire word connected with the nightshade and delirium -
medical applications, a narcotic]

Soon we schalle have maselin and maser,
as Cotgrave said of MAZEs,
&quot;Jadeau, a bowle or mazer&quot;,
which our troupe has ignorèd in search of the miraculous Spanish cure

though the Author surely knew of the English:-

&quot;Trula, a great cuppe, brode and deepe,
suche as great masers were wont to bee,&quot;

/Cooper, ed. 1559

A mazer, or broad piece to drink in&quot;

/Baret, 1580

But back to Chaucer:-

Off lanycolle thou shall prove,
That is a cuppe to my behove,
Off maser it is ful clene.

/MS Cantab, Ff. v. 48 f. 50.

What japes eh, comrade? A jakes of japes. Best place to leave them, Ha ha!
And for them to find.

Exeunt.
