Dear Member,

Are you doing online business but find it hard to get quality traffic to
your site? Traffic to your site plays the most vital and important role in
keeping you sustain and succeed in online business.

What does anybody primarily need to succeed in his business.

1. A good product or service that can be sold by itself (means a
product that has demand online)
2. And the advertisement about his offering such product or service.

In online business in addition to the above two a third important aspect
which is equally necessary is Reliability .

It is not sufficient if you think that you are reliable and transactions
with you are reliable. What is need most is your site must look reliable.
Ok, how do you make your site look reliable.  Since online business
oftentimes amount to selling intangible services and products it is often an
arduous task to make  your site reliable in others eyes. Well, anything can
be purchased these days. Even reliability can be purchased. Don't be awed!
It's true. In fact the famous Veysign and e-Trust are incorporated to sell
the reliability online for online. Of course You need to pay them monthly a
fees for using their reliability seal. But they are  costly and could not be
affordable by a middle class business.

Then what is the cost effective way? You must so design your site  that it
look reliable and you must so associate your site with other reliable sites
that enhance the over all look of your site in the eyes of visitors. Your
visitors must get a feeling, staying at your site, that its safe and secured
to do transactions through your site.

How do you do this? Can you do this simply by putting a line on top of your
site reading "We are reliable" or "We are trustworthy". And if you do that,
is it sufficient to cut an impression in your visitors' mind that your site
is reliable?

No. Its not. The simple declaration by you will never be suffice to make
yourself reliable in other's minds. You must have a third party's testimony
or certification having some universal approval and acceptance about your
trustworthiness. In the absence of such third party certification you have
to follow some indirect methods and precautions that render your site
reliable. Those are ...

1. Quality design of site.
2. Simple and plain navigation.
3. Linking to sites having greater reliability.
4. Promoting quality products and services.
5. Publishing quality information and value added information on your
site.
6. Associating your site with some other sites having reliability and
longstanding.

And above all you must advertise your website through reliable means? And
again how do you do this? Advertising through Google and Yahoo are often
considered as smart ways to get some quality traffic. But its costly and
many a time proved unprofitable. The best alternative to advertise your site
through Google and Yahoo is  free classifieds and submission of your site to
search engines.

1. Link your site to other sites
2. Submit your site to search engines ==&gt;
