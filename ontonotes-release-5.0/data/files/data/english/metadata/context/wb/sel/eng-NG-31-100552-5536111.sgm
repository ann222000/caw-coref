About as interesting as our find this weekend on my truck
( http://laanderud.com/texastruck/110506/image_17.html ).  The heater hoses
aren't going to the heater core... they're going to the air conditioning.

Can't have too many ground wires... and make sure they're red so they're
easy to find. &lt;G&gt;

The best thing we can do with this truck is... "start over".  We've found
some interesting things in this truck... best so far is the fiberglass
saddle tanks that sat on top of and were partially supported by the exhaust
pipes... one burned/melted through.

Fuel tanks??? That doesn't sound like a good idea.

Good idea? Handled a total loss motorhome fire at a Shell station in
Canmore, Alberta. California family rolled up to the pumps in a large Dodge
chassis'd motorhome. The 12yr old son wanted to fill the tanks up so dad
said ok and departed for the store/checkout. Son started to holler, mother
came running out of the motorhome. Here was junior holding the pump hose to
the filler pipe with a blue flame around his hands. Mother smartly tells him
to stop pumping and get away from the hose.

Motorhome catches fire and is destroyed right down to the pavement. Pump
island destroyed too but luckily the FD got there to prevent the spread of
fire to other pumps or the building. The tank was a fibreglass saddle tank
unit.

In the course of my investigation found out that the FTSA in the US
specified only that gas tanks had to survive a rollover accident that would
preclude rupture of the tank. I checked a number of motorhome manufacturers
and that's all they had to adhere to for regulations.

The cause of the fire was a spark. The spark came from static electricity
that built up as the fuel was pumped into the f/g tank. The static rose to
the filler pipe entry and jumped to the nearest ground - the pump handle.
That ignited the fumes and bye-bye motorhome. There was no requirement by
the FTSA to ground fibreglass tanks. Most saddle tanks in p/u trucks are f/g
and you should make sure they are grounded!!

I think that I might repaint the T-Cab yellow...  I have some paint left
from the old International project.

Yeah...  That's the ticket!

You don't - you ground a metal filler pipe so static can be controlled and
not travel up to the filler neck where the gas fumes will ignite. My point
was that fibreglass tanks should not be used at all but the FTSA said it
only had to survive a rollover and not rupture. Since you can't ground the
tank, the static travels to the nearest ground which is the metal nozzle on
the pump hose. Mixed with a little air and the fumes - POOF!! a fire.

HHMMMMMM

Walt came down to Tucson and wants to buy the 100,000th Lark from me.
No money has changed hands. Even though I have to get rid of everything
because of having to make arrangements for the care of a family member
that is moving into our home, I think I will find a storage spot for
the 100,000th and keep it after all. I sure would be sad to lose all
the historical value that car has and have it end up like that Lark.

Plastic &amp;/or fiberglass are used for saddle tanks (auxiliary) but most tanks
are still metal AFAIR but I haven't been under a new car in years. The last
time was trying to find out why the transmission in our 97 Sebring was
spread all over the parking lot. Pinion shaft right through the case.
Chrysler denied there was any problem with those units but then they're the
same outfit that told me they'd cancel my warranty if I didn't allow the
dealership to "dust" my disc brakes. Yeah, right.

I guess plastic/fiberglass eliminates some of the ignition risks but
