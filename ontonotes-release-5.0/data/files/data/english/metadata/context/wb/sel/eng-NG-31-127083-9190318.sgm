Dear Friends,

As of July 2006, a scientific study led by researchers at Johns
Hopkins found that 650,000 Iraqis had died as a result of the U.S.-led
invasion. Unfortunately, the death toll has continued to mount since
then.

It is likely that about ONE MILLION IRAQIS HAVE BEEN KILLED, according
to an updated estimate from the organization Just Foreign Policy.
That's more than were killed in the Rwandan genocide and far more than
were killed under Saddam.

And 4 million Iraqis are now refugees.

You can find more information, a frequently updated counter of Iraqi
deaths, and a petition to Congress urging them to end this war here:

SIGN PETITION TO US CONGRESS NOW!
Then PASS It ON!!!

I have a much better idea: send 100 smokers &amp; &quot;forget&quot; to pack the cigs.
Give 'em three days. A week tops. Air-drop their smokes, round 'em up in ten
minutes.

That's it.
