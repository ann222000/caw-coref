Today was another flight by Mom's Airline.
The plans were laid two-weeks ago a the annual family Easter gathering.
The return trip from Ohio to Alabama with my sister's family lasted an
extra week this year due to the low pressure system that crossed the
northern Unites states last weekend.

So, today, following my daughter's soccer game, I ventured south to
bring my mother back to Ohio. The weather could not have been better! A
huge high pressure system in dominating the eastern US throughout the
weekend. Winds at altitude are light or calm.

I departed KOSU/Don Scott Field at 12 Noon and arrived at
KGAD/Gadsden-NE Alabama Regional at 3 PM. Cruising altitude was 8,500
MSL. There was a rough patch between Crossville and Chattanooga TN.
Moderate turbulence from up- and down-drafts. This coincided with the
top of the haze and a widely scattered layer. And then, just as quickly
as it began, it stopped just west of Chattanooga, just north of the
ridge line.

I waited an hour on the ground at KGAD, walking around to give my butt a
rest before the return. A check of the weather showed no change. I
departed with my mother on board at 4:30 PM. I climbed to 9,500 MSL to
give her a smooth ride. Time to climb to cruise was 20 minutes.

Approaching Cincinnat, I inquired of her if she was going to call one of
my sisters to pick her up at the airport. Her response had me laughing.
"No, my car is at the airport."
"How did it get there?", I asked.
"Your sister dropped it off," she replied.
"So all you have to do is show up and your airplane is waiting for your,
your car is waiting for you?", I asked.
"That's about it," she replied with a smile.

And that's the way it is at Mom's Airline.

We flew home from SNF roughly through that area, and it was quite
interesting.  The winds aloft charts on the 496 were predicting a
strong southerly flow at the surface, but with winds above 6000 feet
-- out of the NORTH.  Quite a wind shear was happening right at the
haze layer.

We hoped to take advantage of that southerly flow, but it wasn't to
be.  Down low the winds *were* out of the south, but it was bumpy as
hell, so we climbed above the haze layer into the smooth, cool air at
8500 feet.

Unfortunately we had a 15 knot headwind up there, but -- when you're
flying all day -- "smooth" is more important than "fast".
