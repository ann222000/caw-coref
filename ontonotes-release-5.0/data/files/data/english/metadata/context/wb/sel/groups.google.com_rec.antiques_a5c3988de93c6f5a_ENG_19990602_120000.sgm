Hi, I've never posted before and I need help! I have a cast iron
christmas tree stand made by Harras in Germany (both marked on it). I
can't find any info on who or what that is or how much it might be
worth. Can anybody help me? Or do any of you wish to bid on it?

Your group is listed with yahoo for help on antiques. All I really
wanted was some info. Not one of you deemed me worthy of a response. I
have looked high and low for info on this piece. You guys must really
be great snobs. I've never known anyone who puts out a list and then
doesn't bother to answer half the inquires.

Assuming that we all know the answer to your question and have withheld

Tammy,

Are we great snobs because nobody knew any information about your Christmas
Tree stand, the company who made it, or because no one offered you any money
for it?

Some of us are snobs, others aren't and most people are willing to provide
information on items they have knowledge of. This newsgroup isn't a for
sale forum and people don't usually respond to thinly disguised for sale
postings (which your Christmas Tree stand posting was - whether intentional
or not). I have learned a wealth of information here and the entertainment
value is sometimes quite high.

I AM APPALLED! We voted [secret ballot] to list our services with Yahoo and
other worthy charities seeking our sage advice. As a group we share a
common vision - nay, a common destiny - to serve the great unwashed out
there. As a matter of fact, we specifically included Christmas tree stands
as an area of expertise where we all felt we could help thereby advancing
the general understanding of this oft neglected and rarely appreciated gem
of antiquity.

Of course your comment on snobbery is well taken. Membership is by consent
invitation only and we strive to keep the bloodlines pure by encouraging
inter-marriage amongst members.

I will ensure, as the popularly elected Exalted Wazir, that heads will roll
over this - have no fear.

Anyway, to your questions...
Q. &quot;...how much it might be worth.&quot; A. Your POS is worth ~$75 [hard sell].
Q. &quot;Can anybody help me?&quot; A. We would like to help you out, but do not know
which way you came in.
Q. &quot;Or do any of you wish to bid on it?&quot; A. We are, collectively, not
worthy.

If we can be of further service, please do not hesitate to ask. Like the
LAPD, we are here &quot;to protect and serve.&quot;

GW Rich

"/> I'm so sorry, Tammy, that my colleagues here have given you a hard time
about our inexcusable oversight in not either 1) appraising your tree stand
or 2) offering a huge wad of cash for it.

You see, we generally don't want it known...but we are in fact lavishly
compensated not only by Yahoo, but RedNeck, DimWit, HeyRube and other
internet search sites. (Psst...don't tell, but around these parts Rich
Maxson is secretly known as &quot;Filthy Rich&quot;.) In fact, my pay this month
alone has enabled us to add another stable on our estate to house our
prized miniature Percherons. Recently we were in negotiations with British
Airways to buy up their fleet of Concordes, with some help from that
famously soft-hearted slob Tony Blair, who took time out from bombing the
Kosovars into oblivion to give us an assist.

So you see, it's not that we don't care, oh we do, we do. And when you
write that check, it's spelled c-h-a-r-l-e-e-n, not e-n-e. Thanks!

Why would you object to someone asking for information about the value of a

information to yourself, but that does not really give you grounds for
criticizing someone for asking. Wouldn't it be better for someone to
understand they have a basis for the value of something before they put it up
for auction or plunked it in a box in the basement . . . never to be seen
again? How else would they know what a reasonable price is? My understanding
of usenet is the free exchange of information, free from censorship and free
from cost.

In my earlier post (made before reading the FAQ) I asked for replies by
e-mail. I can understand the objection that that deprives the group of
information that may have been of interest, and so I apologize.

Actually, I had no intention of becoming a regular participant. I just had a
piece which is very old and of which I have no understanding of value. I am
also a single-parent and quite poor. The piece has value to me because of its
previous ownership, which, I'm sure, is of no interest to anyone else. On the
other hand, if it has considerable value, I might think about selling it to
obtain things my son needs.

When I made my post, I thought:

1) Someone might know a little about it and be willing to share that knowledge
with me.

2) Someone might find this object of interest and contact me about it. A move
to a sale or pricing could follow.

Sorry if I was wrong.

Good grief. These people who know antiques have a lot of questions to answer.

Maybe here &amp; certainly some other newsgroups like rec.military.collecting
Be smart if you can start off with country &amp; rank. Also there are some
books available that illustrate most of the paraphernalia for some of the
soldiers. If you have one of the recently opened giant bookstores with a
coffee shop inside you will have a good chance of seeing one on the shelf.
Also there are WW1 web pages available through the search engines. Try
&quot;Great War&quot; if other names don't work very well. I doubt a library will
have much but it sure would'nt hurt to look.

"/> If British try the War Museum (formerly The Imperial War Museum sited
ironically in an old mental asylum).
Or try the appropriate regimental museum.
Best to stay away from collectors of uniforms or insignia as they tend,
in our experience at least, to be inventive and without the proper
historians rigidity as regards the truth. Better to consult model makers
who are always 'trainspotters' as regards accuracy.
