Japanese attack on Panama Canal

I have just been reading about the Japanese plans to attack the Panama
Canal FROM THE EAST in late WW2.  This seems very ambitious even
though they did have those super subs.  They planned to attack the
locks so to drain the lake behind them crippling the canal for several
years.  They also planned to attack SF and NYC with germ warfare.
So, how would people here assess their chances of success in attacking
the canal?
The plans were ended when the Japanese learned of US plans to invade
the home islands.

The plan was for aircraft-carrying submarines to launch their planes
somewhat south of the west entrance of the canal and for them to fly
over Colombia - it isn't that far - and then turn north and attack the
eastern locks, because they seemed like better targets.

Had they attempted to stage the attack, the chance of aircraft making an
attack run is probably about 50:50, given the long voyage across the
pacific, the chance of things going wrong, getting lost in night flight
over unfamiliar territory and so on. The aircraft weapons load didn't
look big enough to give a significant chance of doing crippling damage
to the locks. They might have delayed things by a few days, but that
wouldn't really have done any good.

that would be FROM the West,attacking from the Pacific.

Y'all are correct, the attack would come from the Atlantic side, ie,
west. They planned to send their subs across the Indian Ocean, around
Africa and across the Atlantic.

To breech the concrete, as thick as any Nazi subpen, needs
Wallis style Earthquake bombs, which floatplanes can't lift.

That leaves the Lock doors, which are built like a ships hull, mostly
hollow between the frames and stringers.

Ok, a torpedo punched a hole in one.(and each lock has many doors)

CZ Engineers place timber and canvas over the hole, as had been done
sine the 1860s when metal hulls needed a temp repair. Leak stops.

None. Since the Germans had already planned to that.
And that's why there's so many German U boats on the
bottom of the Atlantic. Since the only thing either the Japanese,
German, or even the Americans knew about submarine warfare
was what we thought them AFTER the WWII. Do it with helicopters
and
Low Frequency Active or  Stay home MORONS.

I tend to agree.  My dad was asigned to Fleet Air Wing 3 at Coco Solo
CZ, and I think their main effort was on the Atlantic side.  He was
deployed for a while to Galapagos with a PBM squqadron, but most of the
time on the east.  VP squadrons also operated out of Brazil (FAW-16),
so I'm not too sure how likely a surprise attack was to succeed.  For
example, U-199 was sunk off of Brazil in 1943 by a PBY. In Sep 1944
U-863 was sunk by a PB4Y off of Recife Brazil.  As the war in Europe
ran down, though, the ASW presence slacked off, so maybe there would be
a window of opportunity.

Think for a moment....

The Japanese would have had no antibiotics to use to test in choosing
resistant strains of bubonic.  The only production antibiotic was
Penicillin, of which the only potentially supplies would have been very
small amounts in USArmy hospitals in KMT-controlled China.  It might have
been possible to acquire a few doses on the Chinese Black Market, but the
drug was in such tight supply that US doctors in China had amounts entirely
inadequate to treat the needs of US forces (and the stuff was as close to a
&quot;lock &amp; Key&quot; pharmaceutical as possible, far tougher access than Morphine).
I'd defer to reports that Penicillin had been provided to US military
facilities in the Philippines prior to the Japanese invasion/occupation and
then captured and shipped to Manchuria, but without some authoritarian cite,
such a claim seems doubtful.

Enter Occam's Razor.  What antibiotics existed when Japan was
developing their biological warfare capabilities pre/during WWII?

Atabrine (for malaria), Sulfa &amp; Penicillin are all that occur to
me, and widespread use of Penicillin was a WWII development
according to what I've read, although it's discovery predated
WWII by quite a bit.

To the best of my knowledge, the Golden Age of antibiotics, and
the ensuing rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of nasty germs,
etc., has been since WWII.

Immaterial.  Doesn't mean selection was taking place in Japanese labs,
however.

I was personally thinking selection for particularly virulent strains,
tho.

A large endemic source would have made resistance almost a foregone
conclusion, given the povertous nature of much of China during and after
WWII, when the development of broad spectrum antibiotics was a worldwide
phenomenon, and resistance was not well-known, especially at the local
level.  Given the costs involved, I'm sure a lot of corners were cut,
and doses lowered or regimens curtailed early.

There was a reunion of Unit 731 survivors where I live.  They talked
about being injected with huge needles and getting very sick.

Probably more so.  I don't think the SS dissected people without
anesthetics.  They escaped punishment after the war because of who was in
charge of that occupation, I guess.  Even so, it's odd, because we never
needed the Japanese to stand against communism the same way we needed
former Nazis.

What makes you believe that Sulfa drugs were antibiotics?  The &quot;strain&quot; of
bubonic would have made no difference in treatment resistance to sulfa
(primarily applied in topical form anyway).  Injectable sulfa compounds were
effective in an extremely limited circumstances and  applications.  Was
bubonic one of them?  I don't know, but sulfa drugs weren't used in that
part of the US where bubonic is endemic and occurs regularly.  Certainly,
topically applied sulfa powders (or even pure sulphur itself) would have
likely modestly controlled/limited the rat/marmot/other rodent borne fleas
as the principal  vector for Bubonic, but the &quot;hardiness&quot;/treatment
resistance of the strain would have been meaningless.  The two sulfa drugs I
recall, Sulfadiazine and Sulfathiazole, seemed to deliver pretty modest
accomplishment.

Penicillin was the only antibiotic available outside lab environments.
Streptomycin came along soon after the war (lab development during WWII?)
and provided a cure for Hansen's (and the closing of Lepers' Hospitals and
colonies in the US and Hawaii pretty quickly).  IIRC, there was a
&quot;Leprosarium&quot; in Galveston in my childhood.

That's before armadillo were discovered to be carriers (and folks slowed
down dining on &quot;Hoover Hogs&quot;), although I've heard no tales as to the
communicability from the critters to humans.
