With an inhuman scream of steel on steel, Engine 666 -- a hissing
infernal beast imprisoned in a sheath of iron -- parts a cloud of steam
and squeals to a halt in the station. In the cab, blacker even than the
engine or the coal heaped in the tender, a shadowy shape of terrible
aspect can be perceived only on the edge of sanity. Behind the tender,
eight glossy maroon coaches labeled in foot-high gold letters follow
docilely: R.E.A., Baggage, R.P.O., Sleeping,  Dining, Coach and
Observation. Hanging on the glittering brass railing of the last car's
observation platform is a round lighted placard in blue and silver,
proclaiming the train's name: "Moonlight Limited."

A slight man with silver hair and an immaculately pressed blue uniform
alights from the coach. Time sits heavily on his gaunt face, and the
station's lights glint coldly off the silver label on the crown of his
hat: CONDUCTOR.

"Booooooooaaard!" he bellows, in a voice too big for his chest.

Entering the observation car, you encounter a door labeled "Moonlight
Lounge." Beyond the door, softly hissing gas lamps illuminate a plush
maroon, royal blue, ivory and gold lounge. Comfortable overstuffed
chairs, loveseats and couches are arranged around small round pedestal
tables in intimate gathering groups. Velvet curtains with gold tasseled
tiebacks
bracket brass-framed windows. At one end of the car, a mahogany
semicircle encloses a tall, slender young woman in a crisply elegant
navy and white uniform, her perfectly coiffed black hair only one shade
darker than her ebon skin.

"Welcome aboard the Moonlight Limited. The dining car serves in an
hour. Would you like something from the bar?" she asks.

Faint music wafts from a wind-up victrola behind the bar. It's
Thelonious Monk's "'Round Midnight." Presently, the song scratches to
an end, and another begins: "Straight, No Chaser."

There is the piercing blast of a steam whistle, the enraged howl of the
imprisoned beast. With a series of approaching bangs, the slack is
pulled out of the couplers between the cars, and the car begins to
glide -- surprisingly noiselessly -- away from the passenger platform.

Before long, all that is visible outside the windows is the
impenetrable night.

________________________________

The Moonlight Limited is a new IC thread. The train consists of the
steam locomotive (an Art Deco-streamlined New York Central-style 4-8-4
Hudson, for anyone who cares) and eight cars. The first three cars are
inaccessible to the passengers. Most play should take place in the
Moonlight Lounge in the observation car at the end of the train. The
two sleeping cars are for people who want their characters to take some
time out without leaving the train or characters who want to have a
private rendezvous. The dining car and coach (sitting car) also may
come into play later in the thread.

The train travels mysteriously through the eternal night, appearing at
stations worldwide whenever and wherever someone needs to be picked up
-- on different continents, in different times, even in the Deadlands.
People boarding other trains, subways and maglevs anywhere (and
anywhen) may find themselves on the Moonlight Limited, if they are
destined to be there.

That is the one requirement on the players: All characters should have
a reason to be on board -- an issue to be confronted, a history to be
discovered, a problem to be solved, or a mystery to be unraveled.
People boarding the train do not always do so willingly, and they are
stuck on board until their particular problem is solved, at which point
the Fates allow them to depart if they wish. (People on board are
subject to a coincidental Mind/Entropy effect that makes sure they
never notice the train stopping to bring on other passengers; for those
whose time hasn't come, the train seems to never stop, hurtling
endlessly through the dark.)

The atmosphere is one of mystery, suspense and romance. Characters may
be of any WoD game, including historical ones. (It's up to the Dark
Ages
characters to figure out how they get on board through.) Normals with
interesting stories are encouraged too.

Have your tickets ready.
