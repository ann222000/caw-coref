Dear FD Reader,

It's been a very long time since we last spoke, but just like the
Pheonix (not the city, you dumbfuck!) i was reborn from my own ash. We, the
PHC, been for too long in the underground (gathering informations, snooping
whitehat tty's, backdooring various boxes, etc.) to be able to keep up with
the amount of bullshit that goes to this list on a daily basis. But NOW, the
Phrack High Council is once more into the lights! We've been in the
underground gathering informations about *YOU* and your fellow 'ethical
hackers'.

You should expect to find your mail spool and porn collection on our web
page soon enough. Don't assume you are safe because you are NOT! No, we
don't like you and no, we won't stop. But, for now, we proudly present the
inside of the Star Hackademy ( www.thehackademy.net ) and an early _final_ PDF
version of their lame zine (thanks core, you are a real pal). We couldn't
get our hands on the hardcover; it's scheduled to be released sometime in
december. Sorry!

PHC is not a hacking group, it's a state of mind. PHC is not a group of
people, it's a movement of people. We do not exist!

Please enjoy visiting  http://phrack.efnet.ru  as the next home of your
mailspool *g* and remember ....

.... &quot;keep pr0j3kt m4yh3m alive!&quot;

1. who is PHC? (all I get is anti-whitehat propoganda)

anonymity. If PHC is half as 'leet' as they make themselves out to be, I
don't think they'de resort to anonymity this way.

PHC = Phrack High Councle

Back in the day... wow that makes me look old.. they owned a few
whitehat faggots and made them look stupid.

FD is not a whitehat list.. FD is a list for assholes... seriously it
is.. if you want a whitehat list you go to bugtraq or vulnwatch..
those are true whitehat lists... this is a list for idiots and
trolls... yes including me.

you are right hat you cannot verify the identity of PHC... but thats
the entire point now isnt it. I mean come on... Big Fix wouldnt have
Blue Boar working for them if it wasnt for PHC..

Actually its the time to celebrate the killing of native Indians and
the stealing of their land. I know it makes me happy to live on
stolen land taken from a race that was reduced to alcoholism and
suicide by a foreign power who now rules their land.

&quot;Keep pr0j3kt m4yh3m alive!&quot;

Dear FD Reader,

We are so happy to see that the whole community was anxiously waiting for
PHC return (more than 100k hits in less than 12 hours). But we are full of
sorrow. So full of hatred and rage. So sad to see that many of you still
have no clue. Everybody seems to disagree with the current state of the IT
security industry, yet, just a handful of people have the balls to say it
loud and clear. We've got so many love emails in just 12 hours... We've got
so many hate emails in just 12 hours... If you hate us, we don't care,
you're already a victim. If you love us, we're looking forward to your
contributions. As always, we accept your contributions on this mail address,
or relaying it through one of the #phrack@efnet channel operators (it will
eventually get to us). We protect our sources annonimity.

Soon enough, PHC will release the new and improved missions list. Any of you
should read that and do whatever he can to fulfill our missions list. You
can be an active fighter against infosec industry aswell; aren't you tired
of waiting?

Also, soon PHC will re-start the book shelf. Buying security books is simply
dumb! We will give them out for free (fuck you so1o!). If you have a
security book and you'd like to share it with the community (as you should),
contact the #phrack@efnet operators.

Cheers,
Phrack High Council

&gt; so many hate emails in just 12 hours... If you hate us, we don't care,
&gt; you're already a victim. If you love us, we're looking forward to your
&gt; contributions. As always, we accept your contributions on this mail address,
&gt; or relaying it through one of the #phrack@efnet channel operators (it will
&gt; eventually get to us). We protect our sources annonimity.

&gt; Soon enough, PHC will release the new and improved missions list. Any of
&gt; you should read that and do whatever he can to fulfill our missions list.
&gt; You can be an active fighter against infosec industry aswell; aren't you
&gt; tired of waiting?

&gt; Also, soon PHC will re-start the book shelf. Buying security books is
&gt; simply dumb! We will give them out for free (fuck you so1o!). If you have a
&gt; security book and you'd like to share it with the community (as you should),
&gt; contact the #phrack@efnet operators.

&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Phrack High Council

Phrack is greatly outdated and should be laid to rest. 21st century
groups are far more advanced than Phrack can ever be any more. Time
for people to stop riding on the Phrack name and move on. Maybe you
should form a new group with a new name. Milking Phrack for all its
worth won't benefit anyone. There are alternative groups already
setup deep within the under world who don't come forward and advertise
their presence. Keep the dream alive...

Why does posts from n3td3v, phc and InfosecBOFH appear very similar? Google
Mail not putting something similar to X-Originating-IP has given some
kiddies an even easier way to create differerent personas and go around
promoting their fantasy role-playing without even having to hide their IP
addresses.

Youre playing with fire. Fire that cannot be put out with words but
only inflame the situation of which you are misinformed.

Your opinion is noted, yet you dont have a right to gag my opinion
just because you don't agree with it.

I have more right to be on a security list than random people like you
who have never contributed security related information to the
international security community, or have a mailing list of your own,
and helped vendors behind the scenes to protect their security from
script kids who wish to destroy it.

I have done all above listed and continue to do so. If anyone is
trolling, its individuals such as yourself and infosecbofh who have
expressed their hatred for me and my underground security group in
public. Finally, is your web site very secure? Best go check

N3td3v,

I have several groups on Yahoo Groups...does that make a expert? Nope.
Same goes for you..you setup a free Google group and then just pour
feeds into it. People might as well get a RSS Reader and go it on their
own.

You hate blackhats, you have whitehats and you hate people that don't
pay you your &quot;respect&quot;...if you are so big..then why are you hiding your
ID? People that have nothing to hide...normally don't.

As for your planned &quot;death&quot;..it isn't working so well is it? I saw
around 20 comments on CNET Tallback yesterday from your name alone...

I don't really want to feed the trolls any more than we as a list
already have, but for your benefit, n3td3v, and in the hope that either
the list will have some of their concerns allayed or you'll realise
where you're going wrong...

"/> Last first, making threats doesn't help either - again, you say two
things in one breath - you proclaim yourself as a fantastic, righteous
member of the community and also make veiled threats about other peoples
computer systems.

I think the majority of people on this list who have an unfavourable
reaction to you have it for the following reasons:

* You've never provided any concrete indication that you have any
technical knowhow (I've never read a post of yours on a technical topic)

* You (unlike most people who work in &quot;corporate&quot; security) are falling
for the trao of hiding behind an alias rather than using your real name.

* Your spelling, punctuation, and grammar (for someone who claims to
work in &quot;corporate&quot; security and have years of experience) is terrible.

* Your understanding of how &quot;corporate security&quot; actually works and how
the security community structured are both fundamentally flawed.

* You make grandiose allusions to things you know and
conversations/relationships/organisations you're privy to, almost all of
which are entirely unsubstantiated.

* You have a website hosted on geocities which has content which is, at
best, utterly laughable.

* You are inconsistent and hypocritical (one example being the fact that
you did indeed announce to the list that you were &quot;dead&quot; and going to
change alias, and have since - as far as we can see - dropped that).

The overwhelming impression that I get from you, coming from someone who
has seen both sides of the security world, and as someone who does work,
professionally, in information security with large organisations, is
that you're pretentious, fake, and contrived. Frankly, based on your
posts and your website, I get the distinct impression that you're about
15.

I'm not trying to attack you in any way, but as someone who I feel is at
least reasonably representative of a substantial proportion of the list,
I think this is probably a fairly un-unique perspective. If you
genuinely want to be taken seriously and really do want to participate,
I'd suggest that you either amend your ways, answer some of our
questions, or stop biting the trollfood.

Chances are that if you are 'just some kid' someday, you may want to
work in IT. It'd probably be in your interest in this case to distance
yourself from 'n3td3v', find an alias (completely disassociated) to use
(or, if you're brave enough, start using your real name), and heed some
of the advice you've been (with varying degrees of kindness) given.

Even if you don't have the inclination (or ability) to reply sensible,
you might want to at least try and take some of this in! You're welcome
to message me offlist if you're so inclined and have questions.

&gt; Since the 'phrack' email wasn't coming from phrack.org as the real phrack

us
&gt; he's 12 or 13, I don't see why you bother guys defending phrack here, it

&gt; Youre playing with fire. Fire that cannot be put out with words but only
&gt; inflame the situation of which you are misinformed.

&gt; Your opinion is noted, yet you dont have a right to gag my opinion just
&gt; because you don't agree with it.

&gt; I have more right to be on a security list than random people like you who
&gt; have never contributed security related information to the international
&gt; security community, or have a mailing list of your own, and helped vendors
&gt; behind the scenes to protect their security from script kids who wish to
&gt; destroy it.

&gt; I have done all above listed and continue to do so. If anyone is trolling,
&gt; its individuals such as yourself and infosecbofh who have expressed their
&gt; hatred for me and my underground security group in public. Finally, is
your
&gt; web site very secure? Best go check

I dislike n3td3v as much as most subscribers of this list, but the
ammount of noise generated by people complaining about him is much
worst than n3td3v himself.

Yes, I tend to agree with most comments about n3td3v, but I really think
all this spitting game is much more childish than any comment he
ever made.

If you don't like what he has to say (I know I don't), simply
filter his e-mails (I did). But all this noise generated by
people complaining whenever he posts something is not helping.

For crying out loud, this is a security related list. If you want
to complain about someone's knowledge, skills or maturity, take
it off the list.

The best way to prove he is wrong is not to make the same
mistakes, or even worst mistakes than he is doing.

Best Regards,
PS: I won't reply to this e-mail on list. If you have anything to
say to me regarding this message, e-mail me personaly. This is as
much noise as I'm willing to add to the list

left of werk... then to the pub! yay!

n3td3v

u are 24. your first language is Spanish. (small possibility
Italian). You were not educated in the UK. I doubt you were
educated in Europe. I would gamble that you are Brazilian. ( you
*might* have done some studding here - uni, or comprehensive ...
dunno... personally i doubt it)

I dont even think you are in the UK, I think you are in Brazil.

Cheers mate

Jonny of the Disco

Also PHC != Phrack (as many people have stated) - is PHC kaizersauze?
we shall see i suppose.

yes yes n3td3v i know i sent the last mail to you directly - I cant
help it I only have one finger and have to use a stick attached to my
forehead to type, cutting and pasting is a little difficult.

someone's webserver after having what amounts to an argument with them
and ending it with an imperative that they ensure it ('Best go check')
certainly comes across as a veiled threat to me.

The best mental check in situations like this is to ask whether or not
if the conversation in question came up in court, a jury would conclude
that the remark was indicative of a threat (or motive) or not, and I
think here the clear answer is yes.

You're free to disagree - as I pointed out, the intention of my message
was either to ensure that &quot;the list [would] have some of their concerns
allayed&quot; (through the answers to the questions I posed you) or to help
you in &quot;[realising] where you're going wrong&quot;.

you did, you don't &quot;have&quot; to do &quot;anything&quot;. Again, my point in e-mailing
you (and the list) was to try to bring some element of resolution to all
of this.

One recurring theme of virtually every e-mail that's been sent about you
on this list is the complete lack of respect that (as far as I can see)
everyone who's expressed an opinion has for you - given that I'm sure in
some respect you'd rather have respect at least from those you had
respect for onlist, I can't see how this is a bad thing for you.

I'm sure you can counter with some remark about the respect you have
from people who don't post to the list - but such a remark doesn't do
anything other than save (well, actually, maintain) face for you, and as
the point here is about *ameliorating* the opinion people have of you,
maintaining the existing situation isn't much help if it's all you do.

For my own selfish aims, I like life much better when everyone gets
along (it makes me happy), so I'd rather we were all friends. Or at the
least, kept our bitching to ourselves / conducted it in private
channels.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; * You (unlike most people who work in &quot;corporate&quot; security) are falling
&gt;&gt; for the trao of hiding behind an alias rather than using your real name.

&gt; Theres common sense reasons for using an alias, it doesnt mean youre malicious.

"/> I never said it did - my basic point was that there tends to be a
pattern amongst people who work in Information Security and have more
contact with corporations of not hiding about silly aliases, because (in
general) the impression that anyone working 'professionally' has is that
it's unprofessional.

Again, this is all about impression and I'm trying here to help you
improve the impression others have of you, and I think this is a key
point.

Speaking personally, I have an alias (which you appear to have found
already - unsurprising since it's in my signature and appears if you
google for my name) which I've used for quite some time (and still use,
as a nickname), but I make no attempt to hide my real name and haven't
for quite some time.

One important point about this is that aliases are to some extent
disposable, and those who use them don't have a lot to risk in that they
can wipe the alias afresh and start anew. Aside from those amongst us
who just don't care what others think, a name is permanent, and any
remarks you make (and impressions you form) under your real name have a
long shelf life, especially on a mailing list like this.

I know for a fact that this post (along with every other I've made to
this and similar lists) will be kicked up when any employer I go to work
for does an obligatory google of my name. This permanence factor (in my
opinion) tends to make people listen to you more, since there's an
unspoken assumption that anyone posting something under their real name
is doing so understanding what I've just explained, rather than knowing
that their comments don't really matter, aren't representative of them,
etc.

There is also the general correlation between idiocy in certain
communities and not-real-names. ;)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Using corporate services allows you to detect bugs when they occur.

"/> This would be a good point if we were talking about the diversity of
firewalls which you used, or what operating system your computers ran.
Using geocities to host your website really doesn't &quot;allow you to detect
bugs when they occur&quot;, and even if your goal in life is to be the guy
who spots errors with geocities massively tested (since they have so
many clients) free webhosting accounts, doesn't really help you with
anything.

Far more usefully, if you wanted to really probe any vendor's webhosting
offerings (or anything else, for that matter), you'd be signing up for
accounts, prying, seeing how they worked, and learning about the
standards those services worked upon by running (breaking/modifying/etc)
them yourself, on test systems or in production.

Again, this is why I suggested that you demonstrate your technical
knowhow, because if you actually had some technical ability which had
been demonstrated in public you'd have a far more constructive time
talking to a list like this.

Running your personal homepage on geocities just doesn't help here, and
again, it comes down to that 'impression' thing. How many people do you
see on full disclosure who link to a geocities homepage in their
signature?

Hi - it's me, another non poster.

I dislike what netdev is doing (e.g. &quot;i have ircop friends&quot;, geocities page,
threattening, superiority complex, and so on).
HOWEVER I too would rather prefer to see him trying to pick fights
like this and nobody giving a damn, rather than everybody flaming him,
like it is now. Now I feel kind of bad that i added to this noise. sorry.

Thanks for all your 20 seconds:
php0t.

You can validate my claims by asking &quot;Bryno&quot; as he is known on the

I am no longer an active user of your channel, but I am in great
contact with people from your network nearly everyday over IM.

I am nothing like InfoSecBOFH, you can be sure of that. People have
tried to spoof me in the past but failed in their mission.

We're talking about years of work behind the scenes with hackers,
script kids and employees of vendors.

I must go and change my web host from GeoCities, because i'm told its
uncool to be using GeoCities, because people assume it means you don't
have much technical knowledge of web server and domain name
configuration.

I was going to tell them about other big security web sites I have
been involved in admin'ing in years gone by, but i'm in too much of a
rush to move my site off of GeoCities, because the experts said it
will give me more credibility to do so or something misinformed like
that.

I am now exiting this thread, good bye.

Let the n3td3v flames continue without me...

I'm sure i'll get round to reading them next week or something.

But jason, we have learned a lot in the last three days. PHC is not a group
as many thought but a concept. A state of MIND. N33td3v is not liked by many
of the regulars. This list was a blackhat in the early days but now has been
washed clean and now operated and used by whitehats. Now, all that from just
the PHC posts. During that time we saw an interesting debate about certs,
the value of hacking boot camps, windows path for notepad.exe revealed, etc.

It appears that a great deal of this list doesn't remember
PHC/Project Mayhem and is dismissing them as trolls like n3td3v, or
other script kiddies that seem to populate this list nowaday. Let
me refresh the memories of those who don't remember:

-=-
They were allegedly responsible for several high profile
compromises of &quot;respected&quot; security profiteers Ryan Russel, Theo De
Raddt (OpenBSD), Christopher Abad and others.
http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,54400,00.html?tw=wn_story_r
elated
-=-
There is a deep-seeded underground movement that agrees
wholeheartedly with the sentiment echoed by PHC and other anti-sec
groups worldwide.

With far too many companies making far too much money off of
independant non-profit research and the blood, sweat and tears of
real &quot;hackers&quot;, it is only rational that the security market be
flooded with clueless drones waiving GIAC and CISSP certifications
while some of the best minds in the world are alienated from an
industry that rewards mediocrity and outright thievery.

If you think the reason we haven't been seeing near the level of
remote root exploit code on the lists is because secure coding
practices as a whole have improved exponentially over the last few
years, you are badly mistaken. People are sitting on their code and
targeting those who just don't get _it_.

Before you go discounting Project Mayhem as list dribble just
remember;

&quot;.. the people you are after are the people you depend on. We
configure your MOM servers, run your cat-6, we set up your IDS
sensor nodes. We test and design your perimeters, we guard you
while you sleep. Do not... fuck with us&quot;.

I am a researcher of security in that context. I know a lot of people
call themselves security researchers who are actually hackers, but i'm
a security researcher, as in I read security news and keep up with
what hackers are up to and report stuff to employees of vendors.

And yet you quoted netdev's entire email for no good reason
whatsoever...another breach of supposed netiquette.

Top vs. bottom posting is a bunch of crap. With 20 years experience in
computing I have yet to see consensus on this issue....regardless of
wikipedia definition.

I subscribe to numerous mail lists/etc. and far prefer top posts...less
scrolling to bottom too see what is being said. If people snipped orig
post than bottom posting would &lt;possibly&gt; be preferrable...but quite
often this isn't the case...and very often extremely verbose crap like
images/etc. (dammit' mom get with the program) is often left in as well.

him since I didn't hit reply-all, and didn't fully edit the second one. :/

I would only add that if EVERYBODY bottom-posted on a particular forum
and ALWAYS snipped unnecessary prior posts...then I would do the
same...just out of courtesy for established protocol.

Just as I have my own coding conventions which I use for my own code,
yet if I'm editing another owner's source I will follow their
established conventions...just to not break continuity...and of course
not to be a jerk.

&gt;&gt; I subscribe to numerous mail lists/etc. and far prefer top

&gt;&gt; people snipped orig post than bottom posting would &lt;possibly&gt; be

Or perhaps you should learn a thing or two about how Gmail works and
what the IP addresses you are seeing in the header are. Jesus...
perhaps the PHC coming back is going to be a bit like killing a fly
with a shotgun. Are you really that stupid?

&gt;&gt; I was going to tell them about other big security web sites I have

&gt;&gt; will give me more credibility to do so or something misinformed like
&gt;&gt; that.

I thought the whole Abad thing was a scam and he was a part of Project
Mayhem along with is co-worker (at the time) Jim Jones over at Qualys.

Hey there is a concept. Lets trust a vendor that hires known hackers
who are known to participate in illegal activity and stores your vuln
assessment information on their computers in their datacenters.

Yup, I am signing up right now... ummm no...

I don't feel the urgency to explain the complexed reasoning behind my
postings...Go back to your unimportant job in the industry and keep
away from my operations.

Feel free to pass your judgements, they will be noted, but are
unlikely to be listened to. You havent contributed to the scene,
unless you can show us all a web site (even if its a geocities site)
of what your position is within the scene.

Even if its the most low level of script kiddie hood or weather youre
a security professional, at least give us all something to go on, or
don't expect people such as myself to give you a second thought to
reply to you with the answer you're fishing to get.

If you take my remarks out of context, thats upto you.

Further attempts to noise me up will be ignored... have a good weekend
mr InfoSecBOFH... we'll be in touch.

shut up kid, noone ever cares about your posts n3td0rk and your website is
all crap.
no code at all and no interesting info. your just a pathetic wannabie who's
ego
seems a little too high compared to his skill level. since you got no skill
at all.
funny thing is you complain that others just bash you and have nothing
constructive
to add, well sofar you didnt provide this list with any valuable information
either.
so if you wouldnt waste your time with posting bullshit, then the people
wouldnt
bash you. after many postings about your idiotic behaviour you should
finally realize
that noone wants you here.

Please respect those that are smarter than you and put netdev in the
subject or body so that my filters can put these kinds of emails where
they belong.. with netdevs in /dev/null

-JP
&quot;I am going to start a massive campaign with a dedicated email addy
and SQL-Injection Server in order to get people to stop paying
attention to a Troll&quot;

&gt; Your opinion is noted, yet you dont have a right to gag my opinion
&gt; just because you don't agree with it.

&gt; I have more right to be on a security list than random people like you
&gt; who have never contributed security related information to the
&gt; international security community, or have a mailing list of your own,
&gt; and helped vendors behind the scenes to protect their security from
&gt; script kids who wish to destroy it.

&gt; I have done all above listed and continue to do so. If anyone is
&gt; trolling, its individuals such as yourself and infosecbofh who have
&gt; expressed their hatred for me and my underground security group in
&gt; public. Finally, is your web site very secure? Best go check

&gt;&gt; OK, OK, I ignored the troll earlier about Schneier, but please
&gt;&gt; *don't* now start having a go at Phrack ffs.

&gt;&gt; I thought that you had killed off the n3td3v 'personality'?

&gt;&gt; I realise I am writing a personal opinion email with no new security
&gt;&gt; info,
&gt;&gt; But there was no point in you adding your 0.02p to this discussion.

&gt;&gt; 'outdated'??? Have you read 'smashing the stack'?

&gt;&gt; No?

&gt;&gt; Thanks for playing.

As we're getting childish, and yes this is feeding the troll, but
when it comes to n3tdr3g, it's so much fun watching how irritated he
gets ;-)
