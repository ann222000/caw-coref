I'm at my wit's end. I've downloaded video that is in RAR format. I've
downloaded WinRar, but I can't figure out how to work it.

Winrar takes all those files and combines it into something I can
actually watch, right? How? Do I extract the files? Do I archive them?
Do I extract or archive all the files in the folder or only the rar files?

I am hopelessly lost. I've been avoiding RAR files for 11 years for just
this reason.

Anyone who can help will have my eternal gratitude.

RAR isn't a video format.  It's a compression format, like zip.  I use pkzip
with unrar.exe to decompress RAR files.  I don't know what you've got, but
the first step would be to unrar the file (using winrar or something
similar).  Once you've done that, post the names of the file extensions and
I can tell you what to use to view them.

Once you download and install WinRar, the RAR file extension should be
associated with those files.  It has been a while since I have messed with
these things, but I think it is as simple as double clicking on one of the
RAR files.  WinRAR should start up then, and I think it will find the other
files in the RAR archive (if they are all in the same directory).

One other thing to try, I think this works, is to select all of the RAR
files for the archive (video whatever) then while they are highlighted,
right click on them.  In the menu that pops up there should be an option to
combine and extract the files....

Hope this helps, like I said it has been a while since I messed with RARs...

Good Luck
John

That's just it. I can't get them to extract. I keep getting an error
message, yet other people who have downloaded the same file are able to
extract it. I'm using WinRAR and it tells me that it either doesn't
recognize the file or that the file is corrupt. I had the exact same
problem with a different file I downloaded last week. I feel like I'm
missing a step or something.

Try a different unrar program than WinRAR.  It's possible the files are
archived in a later format of RAR that either WinRAR (or your version of
WinRAR) can't read.

Large files (like video files) are often broken up into multiple RAR
files. Each RAR will have just a portion of the video. Attempting to
uncompress the RAR results in a failure because the RAR has
instructions to "link" or "join" with its fellow RAR files that make
up the entirety of the video file. This scheme of multiple RARs is
particularly common on Usenet and among the file sharing community.

You need to make sure you have downloaded ALL the RAR archives needed
to put together that video file. Once you have all the associated RAR
files, select them as a group, right-click on them and select
"Extract". Then select a folder for the target file you are
extracting. WinRAR will uncompress them as a big group and assemble
the video file for you. If you get a warning saying "You are about to
overwrite file filename.xxx. Would like to overwrite?", just click Yes
to All and let the magic finish.

Things get even hairier (and even more comprehensive) with PAR files.
Sometimes, you might download a set of RAR files, but one or more RARs
is missing. Oh noes! Let's say you downloaded MOVIE.RAR.001,
MOVIE.RAR.003, MOVIE.RAR.004 and MOVIE.RAR.005. You try to extract all
these RAR's, but RAR.002 is missing. BUMMER! But with the proper (much
smaller) PAR files, you can re-construct that missing RAR file.
Sometimes, an archive with multiple missing RAR files can be saved by
PAR files.

There's some good websites about RAR and PAR. Check 'em out. I much
prefer RAR to ZIP. RAR is more comprehensive, more flexible and more
powerful. ZIP is teh ghey, but ZIP is so common in business, I still
use it at work even though RAR is readily available to all. You can
get a recent version at oldversion.com.

Worth noting: I don't get Sci-Fi channel at my house, due to a form of
media Nazism I won't go into. But I like the new Battlestar Galactica.
After a 3 week ghiatus, the latest episode aired. I missed it, of
course. So I visited the BG binary NG and I spent a few hours grabbing
the correct 44 RAR files from an NG. Then I just right-clicked the RAR
group and extracted to a folder. Now I can watch the thrilling
conclusion. Tomorrow. For now, it's bedtime.

Keep on RARin'!

I am assuming your file has .rar extension.

Download and install 7zip

http://www.7-zip.org/

Once installed, right click on your .rar (.zip, .xpi or any other
compressed file for that matter, including .exe installers if you want
to see what's inside), select "7zip", select "Extract files" to
extract into directory of your choice or "extract here". You can also
select Open archive to see what's inside without extracting the files
(comes handy for Firefox extensions editing, etc)

Tried 7zip. I got an error message saying the file isn't supported. I
tried another .rar file I downloaded last week and the same thing
happened. This doesn't make sense.

Ugh. I'm not used to being this much at sea when it comes to computer
programs.

Thanks everyone. Apparently there was a problem with the file itself. I
was able to get a non-rar version of the file I wanted and all is well.

Thanks for the explanation! I'm not a BSG fan, but I had downloaded the
current Stargate episode from England since Sci-Fi can't be bothered to
show it until April. I saw the rar files on the SG-1 newsgroup but there
seemed to be 5 or 6 copies of each file, so I wasn't inclined to try it
out. I really want to get this rar thing figured out.

I am guessing now that something is wrong on your end. Fo some reason
you are not downloading it correctly/in full/etc.
Any chance I can have a look at your downloaded file?

Be sure to download all the RAR files associated with the episode you
want to watch. They should be numbered. Be sure you get all the RAR
files. (It's possible your Usenet provider has incomplete binaries -
make sure each numbered RAR file is complete and not partial). Once
you have downloaded them all, select them all (CTRL - click) then
right-click on them. If you have WinRAR installed, one of the
right-click menu items will be Extract. Select Extract. In the File
Save dialog, select a folder for your about-to-be-extracted file. Then
Click OK or whatever.

If it prompts you about overwriting existing file, click Yes to All.
It will finish. In the end, you'll have your video file in the folder
you specified, ready for viewing.
