I had mentioned recently that I'd completed new Bach (BWV 1042) and
Vivaldi (op. 3. #3) arrangements.  I just received the published
versions from Berben and they are now in the catalogue at:

http://www.berben.it/doc/htm/eng/default.asp

They are arranged for solo guitar but also work well played with
string quartet or string orchestra.

Just in time for Xmas!

BWV 1043, one of my favorite pieces to listen to and to play.  I
arranged it for my quintet, for Violin and Mandolin and Strings; we
have performed it many times.  I play the continuo part, what a
pleasure to sit and play in the middle of this sound.

The first movement in particular of this arrangement for two lutes on
YouTube was very strange, starting with the violins as solisti and
lutes as ripieni, and then switching.  I also felt the 2nd movement
was too fast.  The bowed violin can sustain the long notes as can a
mandolin with tremolo.  The tempo they played out of necessity took
away a lot of the beauty.  And the 3rd movement IMO was too slow, it
should really move.

Thanks Steve!

Would have been quicker, but after I approved the final proofs I
noticed some text missing, tempo markings, so that slowed things a
little.  Fortunately, they used my Sibelius files (it's cool being the
engraver of your own stuff) to print from so it went faster correcting
that then it otherwise would have been.

Trovosky, rest assured, I wouldn't take his critique of Bach too
seriously, the man is a poser, alot like you actually.  Anyone who
doesn't know Gallant from baroque should be seriously investigated,
and their critique there of should be suspect, not to mention editions
made public.

Hej, Michael,
Trovosky has been apparently posed as a performed composer in Turin,
it seems he has been transcribed for guitar!

With the proliferation of copy machines, such a marketing ploy for
sheet music is simply not feasible. No publisher I know offers a money
back guarantee and you'd better be careful before you order anything
from publishers and their dealers. It is not returnable.

What would be the point of that? over drawn on your credit card? why
would you return something which you would not even know what it is
is?

Seems to me like a patent waste of time, which is why no one is
offering this option.

That's really not true.  Roman posts hundreds of messages to the
various lists, many making note of some pieces or arrangements he has
made available to players. And only once or twice have I ever
commented on his dozens of postings to rmcg.  Don't you think you have
an obligation to be truthful in posting messages here, Michael?

I would expect that you would be proud of Roman's work, and that a
guitarist of Angelo Barricelli's stature would play his music. I do
not understand why Roman's success makes you and a few others on
this list squirm.

Here is Barricelli playing Dowland's &quot;Frog Galliard,&quot; which is
discussed on another thread.

Well Arthur then once or twice when you commented it was is response

Why on earth would I be proud?

I have to admit, it's a little hard to see his name next to those
other composers.  Especially when RT has expressed sooooo much hostile
contempt for the guitar in all it's noble guises.
Perhaps, RT could benefit from a course in modren 20th century
economics, and thus begin to locate some butter for his bread. Or at
the very least, write an essay on &quot;Why I love the guitar&quot;, and post it
to our noble RMCG.
As far as Angelo Barricelli goes, he sounds like a good player.  I
enjoyed his playing.  Perhaps he can post to the RMCG him playing
Trovoskys new piece for the guitar ( lute, or whatever it was he wrote
it for).  We can then judge the merits collectively.
