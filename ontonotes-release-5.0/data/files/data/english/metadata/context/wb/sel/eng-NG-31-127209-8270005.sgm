Then why is his lifetime batting average only 303?

That's one thing that has always stuck out to me when Rose is talked
about in terms of the
all-time greats.

Not only that, but Rose's highest ever average in a season is 348.

He never even broke 350.

Am I the only one who looks at it like this?

I'm not saying Pete wasn't a great player (because he was).

But when you look at how many hits he got, and all the other things he
did, it's amazing that he only batted 303 lifetime. It seems like this
should have been higher.

Pete's greatness, while sometimes over-rated around here, was not
based on his numbers, not even his record for Hits, nor by his record
for Outs, which his fanboys tend to gloss over.

He was an excellent early-in-the-lineup player. He got on base a lot,
ran the bases efficiently and aggressively, scored a lot of Runs for
his team, drove some in and was a solidly useful offensive performer
for a long, long time.

On the other side of the game, he was a poor Second Baseman when he
came up but he hustled and might have developed into a good one but
they moved him to easier defensive positions. He played Left Field
well and always hustled. When his team needed him to move to Third
Base so they could fit a great power hitter into the lineup, Pete, a
local favorite, took the risk of playing a new position and did it
with enthusiasm. He made himself into a good Third Baseman.

His hustle and aggressiveness was always an inspiration to his
teammates and many of them have made it a point to mention it. He was
on many contenders, pennant-winning teams and World-Series champions.

It would be ludicrous to propose him as the greatest player who ever
lived and you wouldn't put him on an all-time allstar team but he was
a great player.

We've never heard anyone propose that he was the greatest player,
only that he was the greatest hitter.  And he was, by definition and
without qualification.  It's a fact.  You can look it up.

And you can also look up the fact that Pete Rose, despite the
scandal, recorded the 21st largest number of votes for the All
Century All Star team.  That puts him squarely on the greatest
All-Star team in history.  If he hadn't suffered the scandal, he
would have been a starter.

You are truly comical.  We have been posting to this newsgroup for
15+ years.  To resurrect an old cliche, we have forgotten more about
Pete Rose in particular, and MLB in general, than you will ever
know.  We served with Pete Rose.  We remember Pete Rose.  Pete Rose
was a friend of ours.  The 20 years of 200 hits and 100 runs was
_hyperbole_, moron.

Now please, please, stop bugging us with your WebTV postings.  Look
at the other postings.  Do you see how yours are different?  Do you
see that yours are much harder to read?  If you want to be a
participant in this ng, and we hope that you do, you are going to
have to get your act together.  You are going to have to learn when
you have been trolled.

Now, bugger off.

&gt; He never even broke 350.

&gt; Am I the only one who looks at it like this?

&gt; I'm not saying Pete wasn't a great player (because he was).

It would have been, except that Rose is also the all-time leader in AB's

Well, I was just about to respond, but you beat me to it. It obviously
wasn't a real &quot;forgery&quot; as I purposely did not include your characteristic
'cordially' signature. If I really wanted to forge the message I would have
used an anonymizer. I know that the X-Posting-Host is there for all to read

Here's the background for you, and anyone else unclear on the story: He/she

He/she is willing to make inconsistent points hoping someone will point out
the inconsistencies.  He/she is just looking for a response.  Any response.

There are two possible reactions: ignore, or try to enjoy the ravings as a
carnival geek show.  But to seriously take him/her on in debate is quixotic
at best.  And to try to score points against him/her (with &quot;logic and

The tragedy is that he/she probably once really loved baseball.  But that
