Hi:

I've read many posts which perpetuate the myth that &quot;nociassociation&quot;
and &quot;intra-operative awareness&quot; are the same thing. No offense but
please don't confuse the two. They are two totally different things.

Nociassociation = neurogenic shock caused by the fear resulting from A-
delta nociception.

Info on nociassociation can be found right here

http://groups.google.com/group/sci.med.cardiology/msg/893f26a4b4f1011...

Intra-operative awareness, OTOH, is when an anesthetized patient
regains consciousness and consciously feels the pain and graphic
injuries that occur during the surgery.

Intra-operative awareness only occurs in a conscious patient.
Nociassociation can occur whether or not the patient is conscious.

Once again, please don't make the two seem the same. They are totally
different entities.

Thank a whole lot,

Radium

&gt; My first question is that do we know enough about memory to
&gt; say much about it?

&gt; Firstly, some anesthetics have other actions than anesthesia,
&gt; e.g. amnesia.  Does a patient given ketamine &quot;feel&quot; pain and
&gt; simply not remember it?
">

Possibly. An unconscious patient will not have conscious memories of
event that occurred during unconsciousness.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One would think that they would have adequate reason to
&gt; subconsciously repress the memory.
">

Yes. The memory remains in the subconscious psyche.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If want to speculate further, what about surgical patients who
&gt; &quot;die&quot; during surgery.  There are reports that some, when
&gt; resuscitated, had an &quot;out of the body&quot; experience where they
&gt; watched their body being resusciated, and even remembered
&gt; fragments of conversation, how many people were present, what was
&gt; done, and so on.
">

Ketamine and other dissociatives are known to cause hallucinations --
such as OBEs.

As for remembering conversations and such, it's a fact that hearing is
the last sense to go during anesthesia. So things that were discussed
verbally maybe remembered.

I have what may be a very dumb question, I was under the impression
that unconsciousness meant neither the conscious or subconscious mind
were really doing a whole lot, is this incorrect? Im not going to dare
step into the realm of out of body experiences, i will leave that up
to Leonard Nimoy. I do know that under twilight sedation, the 2 times
Ive had it, I  was given a hypnotic, since they could give me
instructions, and I recall none of it at all.

No.

The unconsciousness I was describing was more like a medically-induced

used to depress the CNS to a comatose state before surgery.

You can be woken from sleep with sounds, light, pain, and other
stimuli.

In a coma, OTOH, such stimuli would not wake you up.

&gt; Let us postulate a fictional patient, &quot;George&quot;.  He is undergoing
&gt; an operation, and there are six others in the theatre.  He
&gt; suffers a cardiac arrest, for some reason, then has an &quot;obe&quot;.

&gt; Someone starts CPR, someone summons a cardiac crew.  Within
&gt; a short time, ideally at least, there are more people in the
&gt; room.

&gt; Perhaps as many as 10 or 11, with a defibrillator.  The paddles
&gt; are applied in an attempt to restore normal heartbeat.

&gt; For purposes of illustration, say that this doesn't restore
&gt; cardiac rhythm.  In that case, perhaps someone tries an
&gt; intracardiac injection of a stimulant, and this works.

&gt; Meanwhile, someone checks on a bed in the intensive care
&gt; ward, and bed 5 is available.  The patient is transferred.

&gt; When he finally awakens, he relates an &quot;OBE&quot;, in which he
&gt; &quot;died&quot;, watched the cardiac crew arrive, says that room
&gt; now has 10 or 11 people, watches the defibrillation attempt, sees
&gt; it fail, hears someone call &quot;1:1000 adrenaline stat&quot;,  describes
&gt; the syringe with the long needle being plunged into his heart

&gt; is in bed #5 of the I.C.U.

When the brain is deprived of blood supply, its neurons temporarily
become hyperexcitable, causing all sorts of hallucinations. The
patient will often see and hear things that aren't there. There may
also be tactile/balance hallucinations. OBEs are probably due in part
to distortions in visual and other senses making the patient feel as
if he/she is leaving his/her body.

As for knowing the bed number, syringe, amount of bystanders [and the
words they used], it's possible that he had level of consciousness
enough to remember them.

">

Yes. It's best not to say around an unconscious patient what you
wouldn't say around a conscious patient.

What needs to be understood is that just because painful experiences
are not consciously perceived does not mean they don't damage the
brain. A victim of psychological suffering will suffer an equal amount
of emotional trauma whether conscious or unconscious during the event
that injured the victim's psyche.  Patients who are molested or raped
by their doctors during the medically-induced coma tend to behave
*very* differently after the event whether they find out about the
abuse or not. The patient's subconscious psyche &quot;knows&quot; that something
is wrong, even though he/she does not consciously realize what
happened during the anesthesia. When these abuse victims look at their
doctors during the next appointments, there are visceral signs of
stress on them. These victims' limbic systems are able to receive info
from unconscious memories of horrible events that took place during
the coma. Hence the limbic system signals an unusual amount of
autonomic stress reactions [such sweating, quivering, increased tear
production, bradycardia, hypotension, and muscular weakness] and no
one -- other than the guilty doctors -- know why the patients are
exhibiting signs of distress. Even the victims themselves don't
understand their reactions to the doctors' faces -- that is unless and
until they find out what really happened to them while they were
unconscious.

The psyche is active whether or not you're conscious. Even during the
deepest coma, emotions can occur and be just as intense.

The injuries caused by the surgical instruments stimulate A-delta
nociceptors in the area of injury. The A-delta excitation is intense
and causes extreme fear in the totally-unconscious, completely-
comatose patient. This extreme fear causes the patient's heart-rate to
plunge significantly. This extremely slow heart rate causes a severe
drop in blood pressure. Due to the extreme hypotension, vital organs
are starved of blood supply and shut down. The patient then passes
away.

Another significant difference -- which I forgot to mention -- between
&quot;intraoperative awareness&quot; and &quot;nociassociation&quot; is that the former
causes and increase in heart-rate while the latter -- being a form of
neurogenic shock -- causes a decrease in heart-rate.

No. Brain-dead = psyche-dead = soul-dead.

No anesthesia needed here. The mind is in the brain, hence a brain-

&gt; is wrong, even though he/she does not consciously realize what
&gt; happened during the anesthesia. When these abuse victims look at their
&gt; doctors during the next appointments, there are visceral signs of
&gt; stress on them. These victims' limbic systems are able to receive info
&gt; from unconscious memories of horrible events that took place during
&gt; the coma. Hence the limbic system signals an unusual amount of
&gt; autonomic stress reactions [such sweating, quivering, increased tear
&gt; production, bradycardia, hypotension, and muscular weakness] and no
&gt; one -- other than the guilty doctors -- know why the patients are
&gt; exhibiting signs of distress. Even the victims themselves don't
&gt; understand their reactions to the doctors' faces -- that is unless and
&gt; until they find out what really happened to them while they were
&gt; unconscious.

Science at some level does have answers to pretty much everything,
however, its going to take lots and lots of time and energy for
scientists to find out those answers.

While science may have most answers, very few of these answers can be
retrieved. We simply don't have the means of seeing those answers. The
answers are there somewhere, but far out there.

Gravity is currently defined as one of the 'weak' forces, as opposed
to the 'strong' force that allows fusion of protons to occur.

What even the most educated scientist knows is still a speck in the
vast universe. Science is so wide. There are so many parts of science
that we don't understand. Most likely, there will always -- at some
level -- be sciences we don't fully understand.

&gt; |&gt;Yes. It's best not to say around an unconscious patient what you
&gt; |&gt;wouldn't say around a conscious patient.
&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;What needs to be understood is that just because painful experiences
&gt; |&gt;are not consciously perceived does not mean they don't damage the
&gt; |&gt;brain. A victim of psychological suffering will suffer an equal amount
&gt; |&gt;of emotional trauma whether conscious or unconscious during the event
&gt; |&gt;that injured the victim's psyche.  Patients who are molested or raped
&gt; |&gt;by their doctors during the medically-induced coma tend to behave
&gt; |&gt;*very* differently after the event whether they find out about the

&gt; Would broadly agree with all  this, in fact it is pretty common

&gt; The same applies to various traumatic emotional events

The OBE is simply a perception resulting from certain parts of the
brain becoming hyperexcitable due to lack of energy.

Patients of classic migraine might experience OBEs and other
perceptual distortions. This is again due to the fact that the brain
does not have enough energy to control its excitability.

In the initial phase of a classic migraine, arteries supplying the
brain go into spasm and become narrow -- thereby starving the brain of
the energy it needs. Exhausted neurons become overstimulated causing

&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt; My first question is that do we know enough about memory to
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt; say much about it?
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt; Firstly, some anesthetics have other actions than anesthesia,
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt; e.g. amnesia.  Does a patient given ketamine &quot;feel&quot; pain and
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt; simply not remember it?
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;Possibly. An unconscious patient will not have conscious memories
&gt; of
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;event that occurred during unconsciousness.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; That would depend on how we define &quot;unconsciousness&quot; wouldn't it?
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; Is a sleeping person really &quot;unconscious&quot;?
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt; No.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt; The unconsciousness I was describing was more like a medically-induced
&gt; |&gt;&gt; coma done to patients prior to surgery. Certain barbiturates are often
&gt; |&gt;&gt; used to depress the CNS to a comatose state before surgery.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt; You can be woken from sleep with sounds, light, pain, and other
&gt; |&gt;&gt; stimuli.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt; In a coma, OTOH, such stimuli would not wake you up.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt; If want to speculate further, what about surgical patients who
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt; &quot;die&quot; during surgery.  There are reports that some, when
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt; resuscitated, had an &quot;out of the body&quot; experience where they
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt; watched their body being resusciated, and even remembered
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt; fragments of conversation, how many people were present, what was
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;&gt; done, and so on.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;Ketamine and other dissociatives are known to cause
&gt; hallucinations --
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;such as OBEs.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; True, but how can we be sure that an &quot;OBE&quot; is actually a
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;hallucination&quot;?
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt; It is. Despite the myths perpetuated by Hollywood and the media, OBEs
&gt; |&gt;&gt; are nothing more than just hallucinations. Nothing paranormal about
&gt; |&gt;&gt; OBEs.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; Let us postulate a fictional patient, &quot;George&quot;.  He is undergoing
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; an operation, and there are six others in the theatre.  He
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; suffers a cardiac arrest, for some reason, then has an &quot;obe&quot;.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; Someone starts CPR, someone summons a cardiac crew.  Within
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; a short time, ideally at least, there are more people in the
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; room.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps as many as 10 or 11, with a defibrillator.  The paddles
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; are applied in an attempt to restore normal heartbeat.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; For purposes of illustration, say that this doesn't restore
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; cardiac rhythm.  In that case, perhaps someone tries an
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; intracardiac injection of a stimulant, and this works.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, someone checks on a bed in the intensive care
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; ward, and bed 5 is available.  The patient is transferred.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; When he finally awakens, he relates an &quot;OBE&quot;, in which he
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;died&quot;, watched the cardiac crew arrive, says that room
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; now has 10 or 11 people, watches the defibrillation attempt, sees
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; it fail, hears someone call &quot;1:1000 adrenaline stat&quot;,  describes
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; the syringe with the long needle being plunged into his heart
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; (which he is likely to remember, if nothing else) then states he
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; is in bed #5 of the I.C.U.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; I would think all this might be pretty difficult to explain
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; unless &quot;George&quot; was pretty medically sophisticated, and even
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; then this doesn't explain how he knows the bed number. :-)
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt; When the brain is deprived of blood supply, its neurons temporarily
&gt; |&gt;&gt; become hyperexcitable, causing all sorts of hallucinations. The
&gt; |&gt;&gt; patient will often see and hear things that aren't there. There may
&gt; |&gt;&gt; also be tactile/balance hallucinations. OBEs are probably due in part
&gt; |&gt;&gt; to distortions in visual and other senses making the patient feel as
&gt; |&gt;&gt; if he/she is leaving his/her body.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt; As for knowing the bed number, syringe, amount of bystanders [and the
&gt; |&gt;&gt; words they used], it's possible that he had level of consciousness
&gt; |&gt;&gt; enough to remember them.
&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;uhhh....doubt it...if he was in cardiac arrest...he had NO level of
&gt; |&gt;consciousness

&gt; Again, depends on how you would define &quot;consciousness&quot;, doesn't
&gt; it?  Many who have had a &quot;near death&quot; have accurately reported
&gt; what happened as the result of the arrest.

&gt; Of course, there are alternative explanations.  Perhaps when
&gt; conscious he or she &quot;picks the brains&quot; of attending doctors
&gt; and/or nurses for the information?

&gt; ... Or perhaps the patient has watched a lot of medical TV shows?

&gt; After all, there is much we don't know and cannot explain.:-)
&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;As for remembering conversations and such, it's a fact that hearing
&gt; is
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;the last sense to go during anesthesia. So things that were
&gt; discussed
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; |&gt;verbally maybe remembered.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; In most people the sense of sight seems to be dominant, but I am
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; willing to assume that his eyes are closed. :-)
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps even more important, the crew in an operating theatre
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; don't usually discuss what they will do if the patient has a
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; cardiac arrest during surgery, and certainly not in detail.
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; Or at least one hopes they don't, as that could act as a
&gt; |&gt;&gt;&gt; suggestion to the patient.
&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;you have obviously never been in a &quot;code&quot; situation...&quot;we&quot; do certainly
&gt; |&gt;discuss what is done..there is a person &quot;recording&quot; all the meds
&gt; |&gt;given..defibs etc

&gt; I think that perhaps you are jumping to a conclusion here.  I
&gt; didn't state that such &quot;discussion&quot; doesn't take place, just that
&gt; it probably isn't a good idea.

&gt; After all, if you were the patient who had just had a cardiac
&gt; arrest during an operation, would you rather that someone on the
&gt; team said &quot;We can save this one&quot; as opposed to &quot;Hopeless case,
&gt; truly dead.&quot;
">

again...you have never been there....it is not a discussion of whether or
not to do CPR....all patients who suffer cardiac arrest in a hospital are
given cpr UNLESS they are terminal AND have an advanced directive

and they work damn hard ...often up to an hour before &quot;giving up&quot;////

&gt; Effects: Placebos, although often considered inert and harmless,

&gt; fatigue, depression, numbness, hallucinations, itching, vomiting,
&gt; tremor, tachycardia, diarrhea, pallor, rashes, hives, ataxia, and
&gt; edema.

&gt; Some people have characteristics of drug addiction to a placebo:

&gt; |&gt;as far as acting as a &quot;suggestion&quot; to the patient...
&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;you do not understand that a person in cardiac arrest is essentially
&gt; &quot;not
&gt; |&gt;alive&quot;

&gt; This depends on your definition of &quot;clinically dead&quot;.  AFIK, the
&gt; current definition of &quot;clinical death&quot; is a flat line on an EEG
&gt; scope indicating zero brain activity.

&gt; After all, if the patient with cardiac arrest is essentially
&gt; &quot;not alive&quot;, then it isn't worthwhile to try to resuscitate them.

&gt; Of course, this depends on the readers definition of
&gt; &quot;clinically dead&quot; :-)

&gt; If they are, and are transplant donors, they can be kept
&gt; &quot;alive&quot;, in a sense, for a considerable period of time even with
&gt; a flat line EEG.

&gt; If act quickly enough, some organs are still useful for
&gt; transplant.

&gt; What amazes me is the low percentage of organ donors in
&gt; relation to religious belief.

&gt; From my point of view, when I leave my body permanently
&gt; at death, I will have no further use for it. So it might as well
&gt; be used for transplants and/or dissection.

&gt; This seems better than the buried body being eaten by rats,
&gt; insects, molds and fungi.

&gt; If I didn't believe in life after death, I would be even more
&gt; willing to donate my body.

&gt; It would be interesting to know just what percentage
&gt; of believers and non-believers are organ donors.  A

Suspended animation is a state where the body is alive and working but
at such small levels that they are not noticeable to bystanders or
even to medical equipment. EEG, EKG, breath-measurements, and pulse
are so weak that they cannot be detected -- but nonetheless are still
present.

This is one way the body adapts to extreme lack of energy -- such as
during cardiac arrest.

Nope. Consciousness is far more mechanical and chemical than we give
it credit for. Sci-fi movies tend to depict brain signals as
electromagnetic and therefore state the possibility of storing
consciousness in an HDD. Nope, not gonna happen.

The brain is too poor of a conductor to process any electromagnetic
signals. Mostly the brain uses proteins to transmit, receive, record,
playback, store, and process signals. There is a long list of what
determines those signals. This includes - but is clearly not limited
to -- the types of proteins, the amounts of proteins, the rate at
which the proteins move, whether they move at all, rate at which
proteins are produced, which amino acids make up a protein, how many
structures the protein has, whether the protein is denatured [and to
what extent] and many other variables regarding proteins. Most CNS
signals are based on proteins, though many sci-fi thrillers tend to
spread the myth that the brain is purely-electric.

The brain -- being a biological entity -- is a lot more chemical than
electric. The electric part is what can be seen most easily. However,
the chemical reactions are a lot more significant to the brain, than
the electricity.

Many neurotransmitters are proteins.

&gt; |&gt;The OBE is simply a perception resulting from certain parts of the
&gt; |&gt;brain becoming hyperexcitable due to lack of energy.
&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;Patients of classic migraine might experience OBEs and other
&gt; |&gt;perceptual distortions. This is again due to the fact that the brain
&gt; |&gt;does not have enough energy to control its excitability.
&gt; |&gt;
&gt; |&gt;In the initial phase of a classic migraine, arteries supplying the
&gt; |&gt;brain go into spasm and become narrow -- thereby starving the brain of
&gt; |&gt;the energy it needs. Exhausted neurons become overstimulated causing
&gt; |&gt;symptoms associated with &quot;migraine aura&quot;.
&gt; I could be wrong, but I always associated &quot;migraine aura&quot; as
&gt; being
&gt; a precursor of an attack of migraine, involving pain, but not
&gt; associated with an &quot;OBE&quot; or any other paranormal phenomena.

The migraine aura is a warning sign of the headache. Cerebral
vasoconstriction causes the aura, while subsequent vasodilatation
causes the headache.

Migraine aura can involve all sorts of hallucinations and weird
sensations -- including OBEs.

Usually yes, a flat EEG means the patient is dead. However, there are
extremely rare cases where this isn't the case.

&gt; Since the body doesn't die all at once, being able to sharply
&gt; draw a line between life and death is presumably considered
&gt; to  be more convenient for their doctor and the bereaved
&gt; relatives.

&gt; If the body actually did die all at once, we couldn't use it as a
&gt; source of transplants, could we? :-)

&gt; If the &quot;deceased&quot; isn't really dead, and isn't an organ donor,
&gt; they are often embalmed so the body can be displayed at
&gt; the funeral.

&gt; A rather barbaric custom, IMHO, but it does provide a
&gt; good living for the funeral directors and their staff.  At
&gt; least the embalming process ensures that they won't be buried
&gt; alive.  Draining the blood and replacing it with a formalin
&gt; based embalming fluid ensures that. :-)

&gt; This doesn't seem to bother the scavengers, though.  There
&gt; usually isn't a lot left of the body after a few weeks or months,
&gt; though.  If the reader has trouble believing this, they should
&gt; feel free to consult a forensic pathologist. :-)

&gt; The ancient Egyptians did rather better on preserving the
&gt; outward appearance of the body, but it might be difficult
&gt; to find an funeral director who has mastered this ancient
&gt; art.

&gt; However, if could find one,  the process is time consuming and
&gt; would be no doubt very expensive.  These days, storage in liquid
&gt; nitrogen would  probably be cheaper.

&gt; Some people choose this now, in the hope of being revived at some
&gt; future date.  If the practice became popular, there could be
&gt; legal complications, of course.

&gt; For if the corpse could possibly be revived in the future, then
&gt; we would have to change the definition of &quot;death&quot;, the
&gt; laws of inheritance, and even criminal law.

&gt; In any case, the old medical axiom that the only sure sign of
&gt; death is decomposition is probably no longer true.

&gt; If the victim of a murder were to be immediately immersed in
&gt; liquid nitrogen, could we even convict the murderer?  Any
&gt; lawyers on this group?

&gt; If this is true, and even an EEG cannot detect the absence of
&gt; brain activity, many doctors will be disappointed to find they
&gt; need new criteria to determine actual death.:-)

In this state of 'revivable death', there are brain-waves but their
voltages are too low for the EEG monitor to read. Hence, the EEG
displays a flat-line.

The soul is present in the brain. Detecting whether it's active or not

The chemicals generated by the receptors do not enter the
bloodstreams. The pain receptor generates chemicals, these chemicals
stimulated sensory neurons they are attached to. These stimulated
sensory neurons release proteins that stimulate more sensory neurons
along the pathway to the CNS. It's both chemical and electrical. But
mostly chemical. This is how the signals get from the source [in this
case, a pain receptor] to the destination [the CNS].

The signals reach the brain via nerve branches, not the bloodstream.

Not every migraine patient has an aura. Only 20% percent of migraine
patients experience auras. The remaining 80% just feel the pain and
annoyance of the headache phase and after phase [dull head and neck
pains -- tension headache].

Also, the auras can vary significantly from person to person. Not all
involve OBEs. The usual descriptions are flashes of light, blind
spots, zig-zag lines, dizziness, tinnitus, as well as numbness and
weakness in certain areas of the body.

Well, as I said before, the migraine aura [including any resulting
OBEs] result from the brain not getting the blood supply it needs.

To take a drug that would cause this is more dangerous than LSD or
other hallucinogens. So why take the risk?

Prolonged intense vasoconstriction can become a stroke. This is called
&quot;migrainous infarction&quot;.

Now if this hypothetical cerebral vasoconstrictor is taken in small
amount and only for short periods of time, then yes, migraine aura
symptoms most likely will result. However, as with any drug, overuse
is a potential hazard. Side effects may also be disabling.
