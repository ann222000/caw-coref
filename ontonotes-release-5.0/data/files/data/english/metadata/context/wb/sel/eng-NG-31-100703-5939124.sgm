I am looking to replace my recently broken V15-S shredder. Looking at Argos
they have a Fellowes PS-62C for £49.99 and at Staples they have a PS-65C for
£79.

Anyone care to comment on either the prices or durability of these products,
I tend to batch shred once a week or so, but I do have quite a bit each week
to do. I would like the ability to shred paper with staples or paperclips. I
would also prefer to buy on the high street (as I have a load of paperwork
to shred) but am not adverse to buying online.

thanks

Vernon

The 62c doesn't have a very big bin (a problem with all compact shredders).
You can't just keep stuffing stuff in as it makes it hard to extract the
bin.

It will trip after about 15mins of continuous use and you will need to let
it cool for about 45 mins.

It works fine here.

Probably not the one you need but the info might be of use, I bought a
Challenge
Cross cut from Argos £17.49, which the Argos catalogue states does not do
credit cards,
staples etc, but manual says it does the lot, which it does, I tried it.
Fine for light use 5 pages
at a time.

My last shredder claimed 4-5 pages at a time, and it was painfully slow, if
paper was any thicker than normal it was 1 at a time, hence the reason why I
am looking at something with a larger capacity.

Bought the Fellowes PS-65C today, a vast improvement on my old one.

It isn't so much print less, but I get so much bumf sent to me, I just feel
it is safer to shred the lot.

The Fellowes brochure is here and has a full feature comparison
chart.
www.fellowesinternational.com/download/ex/shredder_brochure.pdf

In a test of 21 shredders (including the fellowes P-45C, PS-60 and P-
5M) the November 2005 Which? report really liked the super-cheap
Woolworths PS-024/B at £15 with a score of 85%.  Durability:
excellent.

"The Woolworths PS-024/B destroys credit cards, copes with staples
and can shred five sheets per batch. Only gripe is the bin window is
obscured by a flap that hangs down".

---

Plus it liked the Ryman MS-1001 at £50 with a score of 89%.
Durability: good.

"Little to fault in the Ryman shredder. Simple to use, with handy
extra features. Automatically reverses when the bin is full and
sounds an alarm. Bin slides out from the casing for convenient
emptying".

---

Also liked was the HSM X5 at £40 from the Shredder Warehouse.

"The HSM is basic and durable, able to handle staples and to shred
five sheets at one time."

---

If it is still around the Woolies one looks unbeatable.

Sure is - better than my two previous broken (plastic cogs seem designed to
fail) Fellowes - and cheap.
