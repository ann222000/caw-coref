Ronnie, while trying to figure out who some of the folks on the
postcards were, I dug out hubby's family history... it seems the Kinder
family DID come from Ireland in early 1800's (first banns published in
1838)... actually they went to Toronto and moved to Illinois in the mid
1850's... they changed their name to Fox for some reason (something to
do with the Civil War and him not being old enough to join, so he used a
fake name and lied), and Fox is the name on the Oireland postcard!

The card was sent from daughter whose father had been the one to change
the name to Fox, and she sent it to her mother, so I guess it was a
family in-joke regarding the name change!

Ain't history fun? Michele

"/> Good show, Ronnie... quoting an AMERICAN song written by Chauncy Olcott.

Per ASCAP:
Olcott, Chauncey (Chancellor John Olcott), composer, author, singer,
actor; b. Buffalo, NY, July 21, 1858, d. Monte Carlo, March 18, 1932.
Educ: public scools, Buffalo, and Christian Brothers. A singer with
minstrel shows and in 1888 singer in quartet with Denman Thompson's
original production &quot;The Old Homestead.&quot; 1890 to London to study foice
and for stage appearances, returning to U.s. 1893 for three decades of
starring in Irish romantic plays. Songs: &quot;My Wild Irish Rose,&quot;&quot;Mother
Machree,&quot;&quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling&quot; ...

So, tell me, when did this most Irish of writers of Irish music ever set
foot on the soil of the motherland?

Oh, and by the way, Sophie Tucker's pianist was Ted Shapiro. There's an
interesting story there, too.

RAGards,

&gt;Which brings to mind Phil the Fluter's Ball. Check out this
&gt;nice Irish postcard:

"/> Hi, Bill, cute postcard. :) You will of course know that 'Phil the
Fluter's Ball' was composed by, Percy French, 1854-1920. Born
Cloonyquin, County Roccommon, died in Formby, Lancashire after taking
ill whilst on tour in, Glasgow.

As well as his remarkable talents for songwriting, dramatics and banjo
playing he was a prolific watercolourist painter. His paintings are
highly collected in my neck of the woods, and always in great demand
within the trade, most of his watercolours being simple sketches, of
various locations around Ireland which he made during his many travels
and whilst he was the 'Inspector Of Drains' for the Irish government.
As it happens, the song, 'Phil the Fluter's Ball' was inspired during
his time in County Cavan as 'Inspector Of Drains' around c1883-88 as
well as the song 'Slattery's Mounted Fut'.

Here's a small example of one of his simple watercolour drawings,
this one is my own, I've had it for maybe the last 10 years, it
probably came originally from a studio sketch pad, many of his sketch
pads have been broken up over the years and eventually the small
watercolours find their way onto the art/antiques market. Believe it
or not, but one would be hard pressed these days to find a Percy
French watercolour under Â£800 even a small simple sketch will make
that sort of money.

"/> Ronnie: Great info on Percy French! A man of many talents, not least
Drain-Inspecting apparently. Phil the Fluter's Ball was played
incessantly on BBC radio while I was growing up in Manchester in the 50s
and is engraved into the deepest recesses of my brain. I had no
background on the composer; very interesting to see your watercolor and
to learn the other details of his life.

The Private Ass postcard is from the Tacky Postcard Archive, a
compendium of postcards old and new with unintentional humor. They had
no idea what a private ass might be, so I illuminated them with a note
on Phil. The Archive (&quot;Preserving the bad taste of our era for future
generations&quot;) is worth further study, and they're always appreciative of
tacky postcard suggestions:

Is there a web site for ASCAP? I buy a lot of sheet music and many times would
like to learn something about the composer.

"/> Yep. In case you didn't see Michele's note, it is
&lt;http://www.ascap.com&gt;.

However, you won't find very much information about composers there. The
definitive guide to ASCAP composers is a book, &quot;The ASCAP Biographical
Dictionary of composers, Authors &amp; Publishers,&quot; edited by Daniel I.
McNamara, copyright 1948. It can be found rather regularly on
Bibliofind, Alibris and the other used book sites. Great reference with
some interesting stories. Meanwhile, lemme know if you have any
questions. As music researchers, my s.o. and I often have info that the
book doesn't.

RAGards,

Tracy

Thanks to both Michele and Tracy. I went to both sites and see what you mean,
Tracy. I have lots of older music by composers like James Bland and Maddena
Morse. These are the types I would like to learn about.

Have another question for you, Tracy. And never would have even thought about
it if you were not on this newsgroup. Exactly what makes rag music rag? And
if it doesn't have the word &quot;Rag&quot; in the title, how does one recognize old rag
music? That probably seems a pretty basic question but I started wondering
about this last night.

"/> Okay, here's my best shot (you know you're sending me into our archives now).

James Bland - Predates ASCAP, which was formed in 1914. There is an
excellent chapter on him (8 pages) in a new book, &quot;Spreadin' Rhythm
Around,&quot; by David Jasen and Gene Jones, Schirmer, 1998. I'll summarize.
Born in Flushing, Long Island on Oct. 22 1854, a descendant of freemen
on both sides of the family. His father, Allen, was one of the first
blacks in America to receive a college education. When James was in high
school, Allen was appointed as an examiner in the US Patent Office and
the family moved to Washington, D.C. There, James heard the songs of
ex-slaves and begant trying to write in that style. He attended Howard
University, but left in 1873 to join a minstrel show as a blackface
entertainer (much to the horror of his family).He managed to place one
of his first written songs, &quot;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny,&quot; with George
Primrose's Minstrels in 1878. Bland made his first trip to England in
1881, where he became an instant hit. He would return periodically to
the US, do a short tour, then return to England for several years, where
he gave command performances for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales.
He also toured Ireland and Germany. During this time, he stopped
performing in blackface. At the same time, vaudeville was emerging as
the preferred entertainment venue and minstrelsy began to decline.
Throughout the 1890s, Bland managed to maintain a high lifestyle. But
after the turn of the century, he declined into poverty. Eubie Blake
told a story of meeting him in Atlantic City. Bland excused him self to
go to the bathroom and ducked out on his tab. Bland died in Philadelphia
on May 5, 1911.

Get the book. I highly recommend it, and the authors are friends of
mine. Despite that ;) it's a wonderful book.

Sorry, can't help you on Maddena Morse... I found no references in my
books. I'm curious though - what did she write? English or USian? What
years was she active?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; music? That probably seems a pretty basic question but I started wondering
&gt; about this last night.

"/> First, let me parse some terms for you, being the &quot;purist&quot; that I am.
&quot;Rag&quot; can be a noun or a verb, but shouldn't be used as an adjective.
You can &quot;rag&quot; a piece of classical music, i.e., play it in ragtime
style, or you can play a &quot;rag,&quot; which is a specific type of ragtime
music, usually instrumental. Rags, as a rule, are a sub-set of the genre
&quot;ragtime,&quot; which carries a broader definition.

That said, I now have to answer the tough question - what IS ragtime?
The simplest definition is attributed to David Jasen: &quot;Ragtime is a
musical composition for the piano comprising three or four sections
containing sixteen measures each which combines a syncopated melody
accompanied by an even, steady duple rhythm.&quot;

Actually, he has described a &quot;piano rag,&quot; not ragtime in general.
Ragtime is characteristically a syncopated (or &quot;off the beat&quot;) melody
over a march-type (oom-pah) bass. Actually, ragtime has been written in
other forms, like waltzes and 5/4 time. Two other forms of ragtime are
the &quot;cakewalk,&quot; which was originally a dance that later became
associated with a particular type of syncopation; and the ragtime song,
which has two themes (verse and chorus), the rhythmic characteristics of
a rag, and of course, words.

The common characteristic is, however, a steady, impulsive bass beat
with a syncopated melody. There are ways to tell if a piece is ragtime,
whether or not you read music. I have put up a little web page for those
who might be interested, with some pics of music and some midi files:
&lt;http://www.rag-time.com/mlc/whatis/index.htm&gt;.

Gee, whiz, Ashely... You don't ask much, do ya? ;)

RAGards,

Tracy

Hiya, Marshall..

If your sig. is a question rather than a statement, I would say Marshall
Schuon. If I'm right, you're coming to Woodstock. If I'm not, I pay half
your way.

RAGards,

Tracy

What a shame music wasn't taught like that in school when I went. A lot
more people would probably have developed an interest in it.

Great lesson number one. When is lesson two?

Thanks

&gt;&gt; Thanks to both Michele and Tracy. I went to both sites and see what you mean,
&gt;&gt; Tracy. I have lots of older music by composers like James Bland and Maddena
&gt;&gt; Morse. These are the types I would like to learn about.

&gt; Okay, here's my best shot (you know you're sending me into our archives now).

&gt; James Bland - Predates ASCAP, which was formed in 1914. There is an
&gt; excellent chapter on him (8 pages) in a new book, &quot;Spreadin' Rhythm
&gt; Around,&quot; by David Jasen and Gene Jones, Schirmer, 1998. I'll summarize.
&gt; Born in Flushing, Long Island on Oct. 22 1854, a descendant of freemen
&gt; on both sides of the family. His father, Allen, was one of the first
&gt; blacks in America to receive a college education. When James was in high
&gt; school, Allen was appointed as an examiner in the US Patent Office and
&gt; the family moved to Washington, D.C. There, James heard the songs of
&gt; ex-slaves and begant trying to write in that style. He attended Howard
&gt; University, but left in 1873 to join a minstrel show as a blackface
&gt; entertainer (much to the horror of his family).He managed to place one
&gt; of his first written songs, &quot;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny,&quot; with George
&gt; Primrose's Minstrels in 1878. Bland made his first trip to England in
&gt; 1881, where he became an instant hit. He would return periodically to
&gt; the US, do a short tour, then return to England for several years, where
&gt; he gave command performances for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales.
&gt; He also toured Ireland and Germany. During this time, he stopped
&gt; performing in blackface. At the same time, vaudeville was emerging as
&gt; the preferred entertainment venue and minstrelsy began to decline.
&gt; Throughout the 1890s, Bland managed to maintain a high lifestyle. But
&gt; after the turn of the century, he declined into poverty. Eubie Blake
&gt; told a story of meeting him in Atlantic City. Bland excused him self to
&gt; go to the bathroom and ducked out on his tab. Bland died in Philadelphia
&gt; on May 5, 1911.

&gt; Get the book. I highly recommend it, and the authors are friends of
&gt; mine. Despite that ;) it's a wonderful book.

&gt; Sorry, can't help you on Maddena Morse... I found no references in my
&gt; books. I'm curious though - what did she write? English or USian? What
&gt; years was she active?

&gt;&gt; Have another question for you, Tracy. And never would have even thought about
&gt;&gt; it if you were not on this newsgroup. Exactly what makes rag music rag? And
&gt;&gt; if it doesn't have the word &quot;Rag&quot; in the title, how does one recognize old rag
&gt;&gt; music? That probably seems a pretty basic question but I started wondering
&gt;&gt; about this last night.

&gt; First, let me parse some terms for you, being the &quot;purist&quot; that I am.
&gt;&quot;Rag&quot; can be a noun or a verb, but shouldn't be used as an adjective.
&gt; You can &quot;rag&quot; a piece of classical music, i.e., play it in ragtime
&gt; style, or you can play a &quot;rag,&quot; which is a specific type of ragtime
&gt; music, usually instrumental. Rags, as a rule, are a sub-set of the genre
&gt;&quot;ragtime,&quot; which carries a broader definition.

&gt; That said, I now have to answer the tough question - what IS ragtime?
&gt; The simplest definition is attributed to David Jasen: &quot;Ragtime is a
&gt; musical composition for the piano comprising three or four sections
&gt; containing sixteen measures each which combines a syncopated melody
&gt; accompanied by an even, steady duple rhythm.&quot;

&gt; Actually, he has described a &quot;piano rag,&quot; not ragtime in general.
&gt; Ragtime is characteristically a syncopated (or &quot;off the beat&quot;) melody
&gt; over a march-type (oom-pah) bass. Actually, ragtime has been written in
&gt; other forms, like waltzes and 5/4 time. Two other forms of ragtime are
&gt; the &quot;cakewalk,&quot; which was originally a dance that later became
&gt; associated with a particular type of syncopation; and the ragtime song,
&gt; which has two themes (verse and chorus), the rhythmic characteristics of
&gt; a rag, and of course, words.

&gt; The common characteristic is, however, a steady, impulsive bass beat
&gt; with a syncopated melody. There are ways to tell if a piece is ragtime,
&gt; whether or not you read music. I have put up a little web page for those
&gt; who might be interested, with some pics of music and some midi files:
&gt;&lt;http://www.rag-time.com/mlc/whatis/index.htm&gt;.

&gt; Gee, whiz, Ashely... You don't ask much, do ya? ;)

Oh, Carol...

You're hitting me in a rather sensitive area now. I quit my piano
lessons at age 7. My teacher didn't like that I played by ear rather
than reading, so he didn't want me to listen to music. The literature he
gave me was all super-lame teaching material written in
1870-and-frozen-to-death. &quot;Rolling the Hoop?&quot; What the hell was that? I
wanted to learn to play &quot;Margie,&quot;&quot;Smiles&quot; and &quot;Charley, My Boy.&quot; My mom
was playing from lead sheets and chord charts. I wanted to know how she
did that. But... Nooooooooo! Grrr.

Actually, most teachers don't teach this stuff this way for a number of reasons:

1.) They don't know it. Most of what I know I have gleaned from original
research and deduction, or from reading obscure books written by others
doing original research. Teachers don't do that. They read the music
MAYBE, and if the student is lucky, the teacher reads the 1-paragraph
blurb that precedes it in the book.

2.) Teachers are, for the most part, instrument players. They know some
of the fundamentals of music theory, but they really are not musicians.
They are slaves to the printed score. Most could never hold their own
against performing musicians - that's why they teach.

3.) Music teachers, especially piano teachers, are totally distracted
with the idea that their little students will grow up to be brilliant
concert pianists. Huh? I can tell you, there ain't nearly the number of
opportunities for concert pianists as there are for band, studio and
lounge pianists, although the latter category is drying up these days.
But I can say this with authority, as a concert/festival producer and as
the s.o. of a prominent ragtime performer, to ensure a piano student's
ability to make a living playing the piano that student must know how to
read chord charts, how to transpose on sight, how to learn a piece by
ear if no music is available, and how to sight read a score like a lead
sheet. Knowing jazz chord substitutions doesn't hurt any, either.

I'm really going off here. I'll stop after this last thought: Teachers
care more about the notes on the page than they do about the people who
wrote them and the times in which they were written. History means
nothing - just hit the right notes. What little &quot;history&quot; they do pass
along is mostly myth, perpetuated like a spreading disease from one
academic to another. They manage to suck all the life and enjoyment out
of the student's musical experience, in most cases. How very, very sad.
It is such an amazing and joyous discovery to unearth and pass along the
real history of these musicians and performers of yore... they become
just as real as your next door neighbors.

Lesson Two? Hmmm.. I think I just wrote it!

And Ashley, after you hear Scott Joplin's &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; check out Jelly
Roll Morton's version of it. Jelly Roll is considered by some to be the
first real jazz composer and pianist because he improvised (which is a
prereq for it to be jazz) and because he was the first to &quot;swing&quot; (that
is, he stopped playing what are called &quot;straight&quot; eighth notes, even and
steady, and began playing them in short-long and long-short patterns).
You can find them both on the Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz.

"/> Hi, Carolyn...

Great comparison to make. However, I must state that the &quot;swing&quot; you
hear in jazz, a sort of dotted rhythm, began many, many years before in
the schottiche music. However, it tended to be very &quot;clipped&quot; and almost
as choppy sounding as ragtime. In 1914 the Fox Trot dance became
popular, and along with it a corresponding swinging music with dotted
eighth notes followed by sixteenth notes, but having a &quot;looser&quot; feel,
closer to 6/8 rhythm.

Huh? 6/8 rhythm is what you hear in Sousa's &quot;Liberty Bell&quot; march - you
can count to it (very rapidly) 1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-5-6. Instead of the
bass being an oom-pah rhythm, it's more of an &quot;oom-ah-pa, oom-ah-pah&quot;
feel. That feel, in the melody, juxtaposed against a strict march bass,
is one of the characteristics of jazz.

Few people, however, understand that improvisation, or at least
embellishment, is very characteristic of ragtime. I'm just beginning to
get into interpretation of some of the great early jazz artists so I can't
speak with a great deal of authority yet on this subject, but I will say
this: I'm a great fan of Johnny Dodds (clarinettist). I am fortunate to
have some stock issues of earlier orchestrations of some of the tunes he
played, and he follows, almost NOTE-FOR-NOTE the piccolo or flute
obbligati published so many years before in some numbers.

For many years, Dodd's solo in King Oliver's recording of &quot;High Society
Rag&quot; has been considered a copy of Sidney Bechet's solo in the same
piece. I have recently been working with a German scholar on the origin
of this solo. I provided him with the original 1910 orchestration,
including the piccolo part, which Bechet was believed to have borrowed
for his clarinet solo. Guess what? Dodd's solo, which he supposedly
copied from Bechet, is actually NEARLY IDENTICAL to the 1910 piccolo
part. Bechet does use the basic idea, but deviates far more from the
original that Dodds. I believe Dodds either read the piccolo part or he
heard a piccolo playing it and replicated the piccolo's role in the ensemble.

Another hint that Dodds was a reading musician is his teacher, Lorenzo
Tio. Tio was well known in New Orleans. I recently read a story (and for
the life of me I can't remember where), about an aspiring clarinettist
in N.O. who was about to choose a teacher. At a band concert in which
this teacher appeared, the prospective student realized the teacher was &quot;faking,&quot;
- not reading the notes of his part. He chose go to Tio, because Tio
read the notes. If Tio was a reader, the first thing he would have
taught Dodds, Noone and the others was how to read music.

Also, Lil Hardin-Armstrong led a number of recording sessions with
Dodds, including the incredible &quot;Perdido St. Blues.&quot;

(To hear Perdido St. Blues, go to &lt;http://www.redhotjazz.com/now.html&gt;
and click on the link. It's just incredible! It's also done in that
&quot;swing&quot; time I referred to above. But then, listen to &quot;Gate Mouth.&quot; The
time is straight, like ragtime. The difference being ???? )

Lil claimed to have written out every single note of every solo played
in those sessions. I do believe that Dodds was a reading musician. Solos
can be pre-planned and the idea that an &quot;improvisation&quot; must be
&quot;impromptu&quot; as well is as absurd as the notion that improvisation didn't
happen until 1917. Unfortunately, that happens to be the conventional
wisdom, despite evidence to the contrary.

Eubie Blake, who could both read and write music with a very high degree
of proficiency, readily admitted that many black musicians pleaded
ignorance to the written note, despite their education. Jelly Roll
Morton was brilliant in that capacity, and is known to have had temper
tantrums when his musicians wouldn't just &quot;play the notes&quot; he'd written!

Granted, the jazz &quot;feel&quot; is quite different from ragtime. It's looser,
more &quot;swinging,&quot; and the use of instruments was non-standard, according
to past practice. However, these ideas were all brewing in the ragtime
era, and so many myths have been perpetuated about the early jazz
players that we may never be able to separate fact from fiction.

I guess my point is, read as much as you can, but listen to the music
and apply common sense. Dig into the history. Read about the Original
Dixieland Jazz Band - the white boys that started it all. (Ooh, boy, I'm
really getting in deep now. But jazz may be as much Italian as it is
African. Hmmm.. Intriguing, isn't it?)

Thanks for all the good info, Tracy. I do agree with most everything you
stated. I did want to point out, though, that even jazz historians differ
on where to put ragtime. Should it be considered the first real jazz form
or only a popular music form that emerging &quot;jazz&quot; musucians were
influenced by? Ragtime was the most syncopated form of popular music, and
yes, it did have limited improvised solos. But jazz is PRIMARILY
improvised and by strictest definition this would leave most rags out.

When I mentioned about the eighth note feels I didn't want to make it too
complicated in case anyone might be interested but might not have a music
education. You probably already know about jazz swing feel since you are
really getting into early jazz, but what I meant about the 8th notes was
the particular pattern that is characteristic of jazz. I meant the
long-short pattern that is represented by the tied triplet figure. The
first note in the pair was shorter than the first note of a tied-triplet
pattern and the second was a bit longer than a triplet eighth. But neither
member of the pair is equal in duration to &quot;straight eighths&quot;.

In written arrangements of jazz up till about the 60's, the arranger
generally wrote the swing eighths as dotted-eighth sixteenth figures but
didn't want players to play it that way;they just expected them to play it
with the swing feel.

Everyone who reads these posts should listen to your recommendations if
they want some good examples, and, of course, the Smithsonian Collection
of Cassic Jazz is also a great place to start.

OK now, which is it for you? Ragtime as a jazz style? Or as a major
influence on what came next?

Talk to you soon,
Carolyn

Hi, Carolyn...

"/> Of course they do. Most jazz historians know little to nothing about
ragtime. Very few have ever consulted with people who have made the
study of ragtime their life's work, or at least their life's passion.

"/> I would say neither. On the popular music family tree, ragtime was the
ancestor of jazz. A number of musical styles arose from ragtime,
including blues, novelty piano and stride. There is an indisputable
paper trail to support this statement, yet the jazz historians as a
rule, seem to ignore this, or to prefer their own brand of mythology and
revisionist history.

"/> I prefer to think of it as &quot;arranged.&quot; David, since we're getting a
little off-topic here and you obviously have much to contribute, I'm
going to suggest that you hop over to another newsgroup,
rec.music.ragtime. It's a small but nice group and you could gather many
more opinions than mine. Some interesting discussion there...

"/> Right. That has been done since about 1914. There is some evidence that
the swing feel was a characteristic of music of the south, particularly
Texas (!). You might want to listen to a couple of the RealAudio clips
I put on my SO's commercial site. His Texas ragtime and early blues
recording projects are on this page:
&lt;http://www.rag-time.com/arc/musts.htm&gt;. And don't sweat it too much if
some of the links are broke. One of these days I'll get around to fixing them.

"/> Right! However, I believe there is much &quot;transitional&quot; literature in
ragtime which has been overlooked by the jazz researchers. That's one of
the exciting things about researching such subjects ... there is so much
yet to be discovered!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> I would say ragtime is the parent of jazz, and early jazz was a style of
ragtime. My SO was very close with Eubie Blake in the later years of
Eubie's life. Dick was with Eubie when he was asked what he thought of
stride piano. &quot;Man,&quot; Eubie said, &quot;When are they going to stop comin' up
with new names for ragtime?&quot; To him, it was all the same. Hey, he was
there. Who am I to argue?

RAGards,

Tracy

Well, we have another contender in the &quot;Posts that go way over Tinas
head&quot; contest.
The nominees are;
1. The long involved clock explanations
2. Deep thick computer jargon
3. Placements of obscure eighth notes

This is an open-ended list. Everyone should feel free to add to it, and
I'm sure you all will! :-)

Tina - who hopes that getting humble translates into getting
wise.
