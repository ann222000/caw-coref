Below are a series of &quot;messages&quot; that I exchanged with a poster who
called himself Zack27e on the Yahoo MessageBoards... agnosticism,
sebsection. I direct this as a possible matter of interest regarding
the recent Race and Culture postings on this site. I guess my
&quot;observation&quot; directed to Georges, in particular, and perhaps others,
too who have aspoken to this issue is..... Whatever your own personal
&quot;definitions&quot; of &quot;race&quot; may  be either &quot;genetic&quot; or &quot;social&quot;.... One

Hello einseele,
regarding your comment.... &quot;Lot of trash here&quot;.... I agree, but I have
to assert in my &quot;defense&quot; that I only reply in kind to what I get from
others.... As I said to Georges on another post.... really.... my
stance is &quot;If you spit in my face.... soooner or later I will spit
right back at you&quot;. As you saw.... in those Yahoo postings.... Zack
27e spit in my face by calling me a &quot;mongrel&quot;.... The Racist
overtones  in that insult are more than obvious....a mongrel being a
dog of mixed or uncertain breed, but also referring to people of mixed
race or of uncertain or somehow &quot;illegitimate&quot; (Bastard) lineage.
Considering the gravity and the outright bigotry of the said insult
directed at me, I thought I was being rather &quot;lenient&quot; in just poking
fun at Zack27e by pointing out the &quot;analogous&quot;.... &quot;pure-bred&quot;....
alternative of a &quot;Holstein Cow&quot;, also taken from the animal world and
asking if he.... Zack 27e..... (and maybe others who think likewise)
consider themselves as such..... like pure-bred cows, that is. Anyway,
my point is not just.... trivial.... and a matter of  &quot;name-calling&quot;.
There are many others.... Jewish people, I mean... who hold these
&quot;racial superiority&quot; views  as a matter of genetic or cultural
certainty.... look at the interchange that I had on another message
board, Compuserve Books and Writers Forum with a certain David
Chiefetz that I reproduce, below....

really consider just what the &quot;parallels&quot; to the Nazi &quot;uber-Mensch&quot;

Jews &amp; IQ-An Exchange
The CIA Follies (Cont'd.)
The Case for Bombing Iran
World War IV: How It Started, What It Means, and Why We Have to Win
Since its first issue in 1945, COMMENTARY has published hundreds of
articles about Jews and Judaism. As one would expect, they cover just
about every important aspect of the topic. But there is a lacuna, and
not one involving some obscure bit of Judaica. COMMENTARY has never
published a systematic discussion of one of the most obvious topics of
all: the extravagant overrepresentation of Jews, relative to their
numbers, in the top ranks of the arts, sciences, law, medicine,
finance, entrepreneurship, and the media.

I have personal experience with the reluctance of Jews to talk about
Jewish accomplishment-my co-author, the late Richard Herrnstein,
gently resisted the paragraphs on Jewish IQ that I insisted on putting
in The Bell Curve (1994). Both history and the contemporary revival of
anti-Semitism in Europe make it easy to understand the reasons for
that reluctance. But Jewish accomplishment constitutes a fascinating
and important story. Recent scholarship is expanding our understanding
of its origins.

And so this Scots-Irish Gentile from Iowa hereby undertakes to tell
the story. I cover three topics: the timing and nature of Jewish
accomplishment, focusing on the arts and sciences; elevated Jewish IQ
as an explanation for that accomplishment; and current theories about
how the Jews acquired their elevated IQ.

_____________

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From 800 B.C.E. through the first millennium of the Common Era, we
">

have just two examples of great Jewish accomplishment, and neither
falls strictly within the realms of the arts or sciences. But what a
pair they are. The first is the fully realized conceptualization of
monotheism, expressed through one of the literary treasures of the
world, the Hebrew Bible. It not only laid the foundation for three
great religions but, as Thomas Cahill describes in The Gifts of the
Jews (1998), introduced a way of looking at the meaning of human life
and the nature of history that defines core elements of the modern
sensibility. The second achievement is not often treated as a Jewish
one but clearly is: Christian theology expressed through the New
Testament, an accomplishment that has spilled into every aspect of
Western civilization.

But religious literature is the exception. The Jews do not appear in
the annals of philosophy, drama, visual art, mathematics, or the
natural sciences during the eighteen centuries from the time of Homer
through the first millennium C.E., when so much was happening in
Greece, China, and South Asia. It is unclear to what extent this
reflects a lack of activity or the lack of a readily available record.
For example, only a handful of the scientists of the Middle Ages are
mentioned in most histories of science, and none was a Jew. But when
George Sarton put a high-powered lens to the Middle Ages in his
monumental Introduction to the History of Science (1927-48), he found
that 95 of the 626 known scientists working everywhere in the world
from 1150 to 1300 were Jews-15 percent of the total, far out of
proportion to the Jewish population.

As it happens, that same period overlaps with the life of the most
famous Jewish philosopher of medieval times, Maimonides (1135-1204),
and of others less well known, not to mention the Jewish poets,
grammarians, religious thinkers, scholars, physicians, and courtiers
of Spain in the &quot;Golden Age,&quot; or the brilliant exegetes and rabbinical
legislators of northern France and Germany. But this only exemplifies
the difficulty of assessing Jewish intellectual activity in that
period. Aside from Maimonides and a few others, these thinkers and
artists did not perceptibly influence history or culture outside the
confines of the Jewish world.

Generally speaking, this remained the case well into the Renaissance
and beyond. When writing a book called Human Accomplishment (2003), I
compiled inventories of &quot;significant figures&quot; in the arts and
sciences, defined as people who are mentioned in at least half of the
major histories of their respective fields. From 1200 to 1800, only
seven Jews are among those significant figures, and only two were
important enough to have names that are still widely recognized:
Spinoza and Montaigne (whose mother was Jewish).

_____________

The sparse representation of Jews during the flowering of the European
arts and sciences is not hard to explain. They were systematically
excluded, both by legal restrictions on the occupations they could
enter and by savage social discrimination. Then came legal
emancipation, beginning in the late 1700's in a few countries and
completed in Western Europe by the 1870's, and with it one of the most
extraordinary stories of any ethnic group at any point in human
history.

As soon as Jewish children born under legal emancipation had time to
grow to adulthood, they started appearing in the first ranks of the
arts and sciences. During the four decades from 1830 to 1870, when the
first Jews to live under emancipation reached their forties, 16
significant Jewish figures appear. In the next four decades, from 1870
to 1910, the number jumps to 40. During the next four decades, 1910-
1950, despite the contemporaneous devastation of European Jewry, the
number of significant figures almost triples, to 114.

To get a sense of the density of accomplishment these numbers
represent, I will focus on 1870 onward, after legal emancipation had
been achieved throughout Central and Western Europe. How does the
actual number of significant figures compare to what would be expected
given the Jewish proportion of the European and North American
population? From 1870 to 1950, Jewish representation in literature was
four times the number one would expect. In music, five times. In the
visual arts, five times. In biology, eight times. In chemistry, six
times. In physics, nine times. In mathematics, twelve times. In
philosophy, fourteen times.

Disproportionate Jewish accomplishment in the arts and sciences
continues to this day. My inventories end with 1950, but many other
measures are available, of which the best known is the Nobel Prize. In
the first half of the 20th

I am somewhat surprised and a bit.... disappointed.... that no one has
commented on this specific topic of &quot;Jewish Genius&quot;.... with so many
of them hereabouts.... I wwas sure that my &quot;bait&quot; would get at least a
&quot;nibble&quot;. Anyway, above is the Wikipedia link to the author &lt; Charles
Murray &gt; of the &quot;Commentary &quot;  published article that I pasted in the
preceding post. This whole line of thinking.... all sort of stems from
a socio-political phenomenon that here in the U.S. has been
called ..... Social Darwinism.
Notice that the author in question, Charles Murray, is a relatively
&quot;educated&quot; [Harvard and MIT] and even &quot;respected&quot; academic figure....
sort of makes ME wonder how such IVY LEAGUE, TOP SHELF institutions of
higher learning can allow such.... RACIST BUNK.... to come forth
either from or through their academic aegises.
What the heck kind of Statistical Methods was this guy using, when he
states that his statitical data either was not or cannot be adequately
&quot;differentiated&quot;? And how the devil did he come up with his &quot;core data
samples&quot; regarding &quot;significant figures&quot;, for example.... significant
according to whom????  I mean, I am not a scientist or a statistician,
myself, but even I can see through the holes in these &quot;statistical
analyses&quot;....

I read the article that attempts to explain the relative success in
Western civilisation by individuals of Jewish ancestry. I makes a good
story and possibly has some merit. My lineage is non-Jewish (Celtic/
Anglo) but I have no problem with the possibility that different
selected groups exhibit different talents including superior
performance in  &quot;IQ&quot; tests&quot; that favor literacy or some other
attribute. Indeed, I fully accept that nurture and nature subjected to
different selection pressures can  temporarily isolate a small group
but I maintain that it only takes a few generations for the general
gene pool to dilute  differences that emerge.
I would be really surprised if it could not be shown that the majority
of ruling classes did not exhibit at least a short period in which
their average IQ is significantly higher than that of the ruled.

&gt; Jews &amp; IQ-An Exchange
&gt; The CIA Follies (Cont'd.)
&gt; The Case for Bombing Iran
&gt; World War IV: How It Started, What It Means, and Why We Have to Win
&gt; Since its first issue in 1945, COMMENTARY has published hundreds of
&gt; articles about Jews and Judaism. As one would expect, they cover just
&gt; about every important aspect of the topic. But there is a lacuna, and
&gt; not one involving some obscure bit of Judaica. COMMENTARY has never
&gt; published a systematic discussion of one of the most obvious topics of
&gt; all: the extravagant overrepresentation of Jews, relative to their
&gt; numbers, in the top ranks of the arts, sciences, law, medicine,
&gt; finance, entrepreneurship, and the media.

&gt; I have personal experience with the reluctance of Jews to talk about
&gt; Jewish accomplishment-my co-author, the late Richard Herrnstein,
&gt; gently resisted the paragraphs on Jewish IQ that I insisted on putting
&gt; in The Bell Curve (1994). Both history and the contemporary revival of
&gt; anti-Semitism in Europe make it easy to understand the reasons for
&gt; that reluctance. But Jewish accomplishment constitutes a fascinating
&gt; and important story. Recent scholarship is expanding our understanding
&gt; of its origins.

&gt; And so this Scots-Irish Gentile from Iowa hereby undertakes to tell
&gt; the story. I cover three topics: the timing and nature of Jewish
&gt; accomplishment, focusing on the arts and sciences; elevated Jewish IQ
&gt; as an explanation for that accomplishment; and current theories about
&gt; how the Jews acquired their elevated IQ.

&gt; _____________

&gt; &gt;From 800 B.C.E. through the first millennium of the Common Era, we

&gt; have just two examples of great Jewish accomplishment, and neither
&gt; falls strictly within the realms of the arts or sciences. But what a
&gt; pair they are. The first is the fully realized conceptualization of
&gt; monotheism, expressed through one of the literary treasures of the
&gt; world, the Hebrew Bible. It not only laid the foundation for three
&gt; great religions but, as Thomas Cahill describes in The Gifts of the
&gt; Jews (1998), introduced a way of looking at the meaning of human life
&gt; and the nature of history that defines core elements of the modern
&gt; sensibility. The second achievement is not often treated as a Jewish
&gt; one but clearly is: Christian theology expressed through the New
&gt; Testament, an accomplishment that has spilled into every aspect of
&gt; Western civilization.

&gt; But religious literature is the exception. The Jews do not appear in
&gt; the annals of philosophy, drama, visual art, mathematics, or the
&gt; natural sciences during the eighteen centuries from the time of Homer
&gt; through the first millennium C.E., when so much was happening in
&gt; Greece, China, and South Asia. It is unclear to what extent this
&gt; reflects a lack of activity or the lack of a readily available record.
&gt; For example, only a handful of the scientists of the Middle Ages are
&gt; mentioned in most histories of science, and none was a Jew. But when
&gt; George Sarton put a high-powered lens to the Middle Ages in his
&gt; monumental Introduction to the History of Science (1927-48), he found
&gt; that 95 of the 626 known scientists working everywhere in the world
&gt; from 1150 to 1300 were Jews-15 percent of the total, far out of
&gt; proportion to the Jewish population.

&gt; As it happens, that same period overlaps with the life of the most
&gt; famous Jewish philosopher of medieval times, Maimonides (1135-1204),
&gt; and of others less well known, not to mention the Jewish poets,
&gt; grammarians, religious thinkers, scholars, physicians, and courtiers
&gt; of Spain in the &quot;Golden Age,&quot; or the brilliant exegetes and rabbinical
&gt; legislators of northern France and Germany. But this only exemplifies
&gt; the difficulty of assessing Jewish intellectual activity in that
&gt; period. Aside from Maimonides and a few others, these thinkers and
&gt; artists did not perceptibly influence history or culture outside the
&gt; confines of the Jewish world.

&gt; Generally speaking, this remained the case well into the Renaissance
&gt; and beyond. When writing a book called Human Accomplishment (2003), I
&gt; compiled inventories of &quot;significant figures&quot; in the arts and
&gt; sciences, defined as people who are mentioned in at least half of the
&gt; major histories of their respective fields. From 1200 to 1800, only
&gt; seven Jews are among those significant figures, and only two were
&gt; important enough to have names that are still widely recognized:
&gt; Spinoza and Montaigne (whose mother was Jewish).

&gt; _____________

&gt; The sparse representation of Jews during the flowering of the European
&gt; arts and sciences is not hard to explain. They were systematically
&gt; excluded, both by legal restrictions on the occupations they could
&gt; enter and by savage social discrimination. Then came legal
&gt; emancipation, beginning in the late 1700's in a few countries and
&gt; completed in Western Europe by the 1870's, and with it one of the most
&gt; extraordinary stories of any ethnic group at any point in human
&gt; history.

&gt; As soon as Jewish children born under legal emancipation had time to
&gt; grow to adulthood, they started appearing in the first ranks of the
&gt; arts and

Hello Jan Braeken.....
I like your comment regarding &quot;universal truth&quot;.... I have long held
the view that so-called &quot;Universals&quot; really do not exist in and of
themselves.... Actually, in saying this I only agree with the view
held by my &quot;buddy&quot; and mentor.... William of Ockham ( I affectionately
call him &quot;Billy-O&quot;).... who's whole theory regarding the distinction
between &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot;... VOX... is all
about this issue of the distinction between the actual
&quot;intuited&quot; (i.e., empirical) individual example [First Intention] and
the process of grouping or association of many such &quot;similar&quot; thought
examples, &quot;abstractly&quot;, within the mind and their communication
through memory and language, etc.[Second Intention]. Ockham thought
that there were only &quot;individual things&quot; and that the &quot;universals&quot;
were only thoughts or words that regarded the understanding of the
said individual things within the mind.... Universals, therefore, do
not exist in and of themselves within the &quot;things&quot; but are the product
of the thinking mind in its own particular and peculiar (in some
cases) process of understanding the said &quot;things&quot;.... All  sort of
&quot;subjective&quot;.... the mind's understanding, that is.... of the
&quot;objective&quot; reality presented by the &quot;thing-in itself&quot;....
Your friend, Jan Braeken, sounds like a &quot;nominalist&quot;..... whether he

&gt; &gt; The CIA Follies (Cont'd.)
&gt; &gt; The Case for Bombing Iran
&gt; &gt; World War IV: How It Started, What It Means, and Why We Have to Win
&gt; &gt; Since its first issue in 1945, COMMENTARY has published hundreds of
&gt; &gt; articles about Jews and Judaism. As one would expect, they cover just
&gt; &gt; about every important aspect of the topic. But there is a lacuna, and
&gt; &gt; not one involving some obscure bit of Judaica. COMMENTARY has never
&gt; &gt; published a systematic discussion of one of the most obvious topics of
&gt; &gt; all: the extravagant overrepresentation of Jews, relative to their
&gt; &gt; numbers, in the top ranks of the arts, sciences, law, medicine,
&gt; &gt; finance, entrepreneurship, and the media.

&gt; &gt; I have personal experience with the reluctance of Jews to talk about
&gt; &gt; Jewish accomplishment-my co-author, the late Richard Herrnstein,
&gt; &gt; gently resisted the paragraphs on Jewish IQ that I insisted on putting
&gt; &gt; in The Bell Curve (1994). Both history and the contemporary revival of
&gt; &gt; anti-Semitism in Europe make it easy to understand the reasons for
&gt; &gt; that reluctance. But Jewish accomplishment constitutes a fascinating
&gt; &gt; and important story. Recent scholarship is expanding our understanding
&gt; &gt; of its origins.

&gt; &gt; And so this Scots-Irish Gentile from Iowa hereby undertakes to tell
&gt; &gt; the story. I cover three topics: the timing and nature of Jewish
&gt; &gt; accomplishment, focusing on the arts and sciences; elevated Jewish IQ
&gt; &gt; as an explanation for that accomplishment; and current theories about
&gt; &gt; how the Jews acquired their elevated IQ.

&gt; &gt; _____________

&gt; &gt; &gt;From 800 B.C.E. through the first millennium of the Common Era, we

&gt; &gt; have just two examples of great Jewish accomplishment, and neither
&gt; &gt; falls strictly within the realms of the arts or sciences. But what a
&gt; &gt; pair they are. The first is the fully realized conceptualization of
&gt; &gt; monotheism, expressed through one of the literary treasures of the
&gt; &gt; world, the Hebrew Bible. It not only laid the foundation for three
&gt; &gt; great religions but, as Thomas Cahill describes in The Gifts of the
&gt; &gt; Jews (1998), introduced a way of looking at the meaning of human life
&gt; &gt; and the nature of history that defines core elements of the modern
&gt; &gt; sensibility. The second achievement is not often treated as a Jewish
&gt; &gt; one but clearly is: Christian theology expressed through the New
&gt; &gt; Testament, an accomplishment that has spilled into every aspect of

Hello Zinnic,
Nice to hear from you again. Your post, above, is in a &quot;practical
sense&quot; probably accurate enough.... but I always tend to look at
things from more of a &quot;thematic&quot; angle.... So, my question to you is,
regarding some of your comments, .... is that  GOOD or is that
BAD?.... But I do't want to appear to be picking on you personally so
I would rather treat the &quot;thematic&quot; issues, themselves.... I was sort
of struck and interested by your last comment, above,

&quot;I would be really surprised if it could not be shown that the
majority
of ruling classes did not exhibit at least a short period in which
their average IQ is significantly higher than that of the ruled.
Zinnic&quot;

So.... what do you think about this notion of &quot;class&quot; in general,
Zinnic?.... Are social &quot;classes&quot; GOOD or BAD, in an &quot;ethical&quot;
sense?..... And if they &quot;really&quot; do exist, as an &quot;ontological&quot; (read
&quot;factual&quot;) issue.... what are they (class distinctions) &quot;based&quot; on? Is
the distinction one of &quot;wealth&quot;, or &quot;government power&quot;, or
&quot;demonstrated intelligence&quot;, or &quot;military or brute force&quot;, or &quot;racial,
religious, sexual or ethnic difference&quot;?.... some combination of
these or something other that I haven't covered?

But I would also like to ask you.... &quot;thematically&quot; .... what do you
think of this &quot;winnowing&quot; arguement that was used by the &quot;Jewish
Genius&quot; author Charles Murray as a &quot;posited&quot; explanation for Jewish
higher IQ. I suppose that, according to Murray and from the standpoint
of &quot;adding&quot; to the betterment in IQ of the Jewish Race.... the
Babylonian Exile was a GOOD thing? Sure, ol' Nebuchadnezzar actually
did the Jews a favor by conquering the ancient Israeli kingdom and by
enslaving the Jews. Of course, according to this winnowing
&quot;rationale&quot;, it also follows that all historic &quot;presecution&quot; directed
at the Jews was also.... IQ beneficial. The historic &quot;occupartional
restrictions&quot; and the &quot;pogroms&quot; were all to the GOOD.... fine people
those Cossacks.... right? And of course, let's not forget the ultimate
in the &quot;winnowing&quot; experiance.... the WWII &quot;holocaust&quot;..... boy that
sure did get rid of a lot of the Jewish flotsam, didn't it? NOW THIS
IS THE EXTENT OF IDIOCY THAT THIS WHOLE SORT OF SOCIAL DARWINIAN
RACIST BUNK CAN LEAD TO... People start to &quot;assign&quot; morally &quot;GOOD&quot;
predicated values to completely &quot;BAD&quot; ideas and practices.....
What really gets to me is how the devil can some Jewish people....
such as the &quot;Jewish Genius&quot; David Chiefetz (and Alex Krislov?)....
fall for such racist bunk that actually &quot;extols the virtues&quot; of their
own persecution and genocide....
So, if you see this and want to answer, Zinnic, I would be glad to
hear it. Next time, maybe I will take a &quot;thematic&quot; look at the
&quot;Marrying for brains&quot; rationale posited by author Charles Murray....

&gt; I read the article that attempts to explain the relative success in
&gt; Western civilisation by individuals of Jewish ancestry. I makes a good
&gt; story and possibly has some merit. My lineage is non-Jewish (Celtic/
&gt; Anglo) but I have no problem with the possibility that different
&gt; selected groups exhibit different talents including superior
&gt; performance in  &quot;IQ&quot; tests&quot; that favor literacy or some other
&gt; attribute. Indeed, I fully accept that nurture and nature subjected to
&gt; different selection pressures can  temporarily isolate a small group
&gt; but I maintain that it only takes a few generations for the general
&gt; gene pool to dilute  differences that emerge.
&gt; I would be really surprised if it could not be shown that the majority
&gt; of ruling classes did not exhibit at least a short period in which

Thank you very much Nomi for your comment.

What my friend is concerned, I am sorry to say that I no longer consider him
as a friend from today on. He certainly is not a nominalist - he despises
philosophy -, and he is a non-emotional infant I have to decide, now that it
seems to please him projecting any kind of his own frustrations that he can
come up with upon me. I'm sure that if he would take part in this forum he
would realise that, but that's up to him. I will no longer waste my time
with this man. We won't see him here either I'm afraid, ever.

What our &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot; is concerned, I believe
those ideas cannot be separated from the context of language. The meaning of
those conceptions (or inventions) cannot be separated from the whole of our
language, and everybody that uses it (meaning humanity as a whole from it's
first origins, including all cultures, up till now).

Thanks again Nomi,
and cheers to you.

X Jan

Hello Jan Braeken.....
I like your comment regarding &quot;universal truth&quot;.... I have long held
the view that so-called &quot;Universals&quot; really do not exist in and of
themselves.... Actually, in saying this I only agree with the view
held by my &quot;buddy&quot; and mentor.... William of Ockham ( I affectionately
call him &quot;Billy-O&quot;).... who's whole theory regarding the distinction
between &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot;... VOX... is all
about this issue of the distinction between the actual
&quot;intuited&quot; (i.e., empirical) individual example [First Intention] and
the process of grouping or association of many such &quot;similar&quot; thought
examples, &quot;abstractly&quot;, within the mind and their communication
through memory and language, etc.[Second Intention]. Ockham thought
that there were only &quot;individual things&quot; and that the &quot;universals&quot;
were only thoughts or words that regarded the understanding of the
said individual things within the mind.... Universals, therefore, do
not exist in and of themselves within the &quot;things&quot; but are the product
of the thinking mind in its own particular and peculiar (in some
cases) process of understanding the said &quot;things&quot;.... All  sort of
&quot;subjective&quot;.... the mind's understanding, that is.... of the
&quot;objective&quot; reality presented by the &quot;thing-in itself&quot;....
Your friend, Jan Braeken, sounds like a &quot;nominalist&quot;..... whether he
or she knows it or not.

&gt; Notice that the author in question, Charles Murray, is a relatively

&gt; sort of makes ME wonder how such IVY LEAGUE, TOP SHELF institutions of

&gt; &gt; Since its first issue in 1945, COMMENTARY has published hundreds of
&gt; &gt; articles about Jews and Judaism. As one would expect, they cover just
&gt; &gt; about every important aspect of the topic. But there is a lacuna, and
&gt; &gt; not one involving some obscure bit of Judaica. COMMENTARY has never
&gt; &gt; published a systematic discussion of one of the most obvious topics of
&gt; &gt; all: the extravagant overrepresentation of Jews, relative to their
&gt; &gt; numbers, in the top ranks of the arts, sciences, law, medicine,
&gt; &gt; finance, entrepreneurship, and the media.

&gt; &gt; I have personal experience with the reluctance of Jews to talk about
&gt; &gt; Jewish accomplishment-my co-author, the late Richard Herrnstein,
&gt; &gt; gently resisted the paragraphs on Jewish IQ that I insisted on putting
&gt; &gt; in The Bell Curve (1994). Both history and the contemporary revival of
&gt; &gt; anti-Semitism in Europe make it easy to understand the reasons for
&gt; &gt; that reluctance. But Jewish accomplishment constitutes a fascinating
&gt; &gt; and important story. Recent scholarship is expanding our understanding
&gt; &gt; of its origins.

&gt; Hello Jan Braeken.....
&gt; I like your comment regarding &quot;universal truth&quot;.... I have long held
&gt; the view that so-called &quot;Universals&quot; really do not exist in and of
&gt; themselves.... Actually, in saying this I only agree with the view
&gt; held by my &quot;buddy&quot; and mentor.... William of Ockham ( I affectionately
&gt; call him &quot;Billy-O&quot;).... who's whole theory regarding the distinction
&gt; between &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot;... VOX... is all
&gt; about this issue of the distinction between the actual
&gt; &quot;intuited&quot; (i.e., empirical) individual example [First Intention] and
&gt; the process of grouping or association of many such &quot;similar&quot; thought
&gt; examples, &quot;abstractly&quot;, within the mind and their communication
&gt; through memory and language, etc.[Second Intention]. Ockham thought
&gt; that there were only &quot;individual things&quot; and that the &quot;universals&quot;
&gt; were only thoughts or words that regarded the understanding of the
&gt; said individual things within the mind.... Universals, therefore, do
&gt; not exist in and of themselves within the &quot;things&quot; but are the product
&gt; of the thinking mind in its own particular and peculiar (in some
&gt; cases) process of understanding the said &quot;things&quot;.... All  sort of
&gt; &quot;subjective&quot;.... the mind's understanding, that is.... of the
&gt; &quot;objective&quot; reality presented by the &quot;thing-in itself&quot;....
&gt; Your friend, Jan Braeken, sounds like a &quot;nominalist&quot;..... whether he

&gt; Hello Zinnic,
&gt; Nice to hear from you again. Your post, above, is in a &quot;practical
&gt; sense&quot; probably accurate enough.... but I always tend to look at
&gt; things from more of a &quot;thematic&quot; angle.... So, my question to you is,
&gt; regarding some of your comments, .... is that  GOOD or is that
&gt; BAD?.... But I do't want to appear to be picking on you personally so
&gt; I would rather treat the &quot;thematic&quot; issues, themselves.... I was sort
&gt; of struck and interested by your last comment, above,

&gt; &quot;I would be really surprised if it could not be shown that the
&gt; majority
&gt; of ruling classes did not exhibit at least a short period in which
&gt; their average IQ is significantly higher than that of the ruled.
&gt; Zinnic&quot;
&gt; So.... what do you think about this notion of &quot;class&quot; in general,
&gt; Zinnic?.... Are social &quot;classes&quot; GOOD or BAD, in an &quot;ethical&quot;
&gt; sense?..... And if they &quot;really&quot; do exist, as an &quot;ontological&quot; (read
&gt; &quot;factual&quot;) issue.... what are they (class distinctions) &quot;based&quot; on? Is
&gt; the distinction one of &quot;wealth&quot;, or &quot;government power&quot;, or
&gt; &quot;demonstrated intelligence&quot;, or &quot;military or brute force&quot;, or &quot;racial,
&gt; religious, sexual or ethnic difference&quot;?.... some combination of
&gt; these or something other that I haven't covered?

Neither good nor bad. Just the nature of things. Is it good that the
fleet win the race or bad that the slow lose? I was just expressing an
opinion that governing classes arise because they are the more
successful competitors in the  arena in which they happen to exist. .
This is not to say that there are not  innumerable other groups of
greater overall talent that could have taken control if the
circumstances had differed even by a single flap of a gnat's wing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I would also like to ask you.... &quot;thematically&quot; .... what do you
&gt; think of this &quot;winnowing&quot; arguement that was used by the &quot;Jewish
&gt; Genius&quot; author Charles Murray as a &quot;posited&quot; explanation for Jewish
&gt; higher IQ. I suppose that, according to Murray and from the standpoint
&gt; of &quot;adding&quot; to the betterment in IQ of the Jewish Race.... the
&gt; Babylonian Exile was a GOOD thing? Sure, ol' Nebuchadnezzar actually
&gt; did the Jews a favor by conquering the ancient Israeli kingdom and by
&gt; enslaving the Jews. Of course, according to this winnowing
&gt; &quot;rationale&quot;, it also follows that all historic &quot;presecution&quot; directed
&gt; at the Jews was also.... IQ beneficial. The historic &quot;occupartional
&gt; restrictions&quot; and the &quot;pogroms&quot; were all to the GOOD.... fine people
&gt; those Cossacks.... right? And of course, let's not forget the ultimate
&gt; in the &quot;winnowing&quot; experiance.... the WWII &quot;holocaust&quot;..... boy that
&gt; sure did get rid of a lot of the Jewish flotsam, didn't it? NOW THIS
&gt; IS THE EXTENT OF IDIOCY THAT THIS WHOLE SORT OF SOCIAL DARWINIAN
&gt; RACIST BUNK CAN LEAD TO... People start to &quot;assign&quot; morally &quot;GOOD&quot;
&gt; predicated values to completely &quot;BAD&quot; ideas and practices.....
&gt; What really gets to me is how the devil can some Jewish people....
&gt; such as the &quot;Jewish Genius&quot; David Chiefetz (and Alex Krislov?)....
&gt; fall for such racist bunk that actually &quot;extols the virtues&quot; of their
&gt; own persecution and genocide....

Don't take it so personally. The evolution of life forms is full of
circumstances in which initial suppressions and disadvantages have
turned out to be &quot;blessings in disguise &quot; (pardon the expression)  for
the future advantage of a species. An example could be the restriction
of mammals to a nocturnal existence in the complex forest milieu
during the dinosaur dominated era. This led to development of complex
sensitivities and behaviour patterns that favored the subsequent
expansion of mammals after the demise of the dinosaurs.
I see no logical reason as to why this cannot occur in the jungle of
developing civilisations.

&gt; So, if you see this and want to answer, Zinnic, I would be glad to
&gt; hear it. Next time, maybe I will take a &quot;thematic&quot; look at the
&gt; &quot;Marrying for brains&quot; rationale posited by author Charles Murray....

This is not to say that the proposed Jewish story is not active

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello einseele,
&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding your comment.... &quot;Lot of trash here&quot;.... I agree, but I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; to assert in my &quot;defense&quot; that I only reply in kind to what I get from
&gt; &gt; &gt; others.... As I said to Georges on another post.... really.... my
&gt; &gt; &gt; stance is &quot;If you spit in my face.... soooner or later I will spit
&gt; &gt; &gt; right back at you&quot;. As you saw.... in those Yahoo postings.... Zack
&gt; &gt; &gt; 27e spit in my face by calling me a &quot;mongrel&quot;.... The Racist
&gt; &gt; &gt; overtones  in that insult are more than obvious....a mongrel being a
&gt; &gt; &gt; dog of mixed or uncertain breed, but also referring to people of mixed
&gt; &gt; &gt; race or of uncertain or somehow &quot;illegitimate&quot; (Bastard) lineage.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Considering the gravity and the outright bigotry of the said insult
&gt; &gt; &gt; directed at me, I thought I was being rather &quot;lenient&quot; in just poking
&gt; &gt; &gt; fun at Zack27e by pointing out the &quot;analogous&quot;.... &quot;pure-bred&quot;....
&gt; &gt; &gt; alternative of a &quot;Holstein Cow&quot;, also taken from the animal world and
&gt; &gt; &gt; asking if he.... Zack 27e..... (and maybe others who think likewise)
&gt; &gt; &gt; consider themselves as such..... like pure-bred cows, that is. Anyway,
&gt; &gt; &gt; my point is not just.... trivial.... and a matter of  &quot;name-calling&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are many others.... Jewish people, I mean... who hold these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;racial superiority&quot; views  as a matter of genetic or cultural
&gt; &gt; &gt; certainty.... look at the interchange that I had on another message
&gt; &gt; &gt; board, Compuserve Books and Writers Forum with a certain David
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chiefetz that I reproduce, below....

&gt; &gt; I read the article that attempts to explain the relative success in
&gt; &gt; Western civilisation by individuals of Jewish ancestry. I makes a good
&gt; &gt; story and possibly has some merit. My lineage is non-Jewish (Celtic/
&gt; &gt; Anglo) but I have no problem with the possibility that different
&gt; &gt; selected groups exhibit different talents including superior
&gt; &gt; performance in  &quot;IQ&quot; tests&quot; that favor literacy or some other
&gt; &gt; attribute. Indeed, I fully accept that nurture and nature subjected to
&gt; &gt; different selection pressures can  temporarily isolate a small group
&gt; &gt; but I maintain that it only takes a few generations for the general
&gt; &gt; gene pool to dilute  differences that emerge.
&gt; &gt; I would be really surprised if it could not be shown that the majority

&gt; &gt; as a friend from today on. He certainly is not a nominalist - he
&gt; despises

&gt; that
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; seems to please him projecting any kind of his own frustrations that he

&gt; he
&gt; &gt; would realise that, but that's up to him. I will no longer waste my time
&gt; &gt; with this man. We won't see him here either I'm afraid, ever.

&gt; &gt; What our &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot; is concerned, I
&gt; believe
&gt; &gt; those ideas cannot be separated from the context of language. The
&gt; meaning
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; those conceptions (or inventions) cannot be separated from the whole of
&gt; our
&gt; &gt; language, and everybody that uses it (meaning humanity as a whole from

&gt; &gt; Thanks again Nomi,

&gt; &gt; Hello Jan Braeken.....
&gt; &gt; I like your comment regarding &quot;universal truth&quot;.... I have long held
&gt; &gt; the view that so-called &quot;Universals&quot; really do not exist in and of
&gt; &gt; themselves.... Actually, in saying this I only agree with the view
&gt; &gt; held by my &quot;buddy&quot; and mentor.... William of Ockham ( I affectionately
&gt; &gt; call him &quot;Billy-O&quot;).... who's whole theory regarding the distinction
&gt; &gt; between &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot;... VOX... is all
&gt; &gt; about this issue of the distinction between the actual
&gt; &gt; &quot;intuited&quot; (i.e., empirical) individual example [First Intention] and
&gt; &gt; the process of grouping or association of many such &quot;similar&quot; thought
&gt; &gt; examples, &quot;abstractly&quot;, within the mind and their communication
&gt; &gt; through memory and language, etc.[Second Intention]. Ockham thought
&gt; &gt; that there were only &quot;individual things&quot; and that the &quot;universals&quot;
&gt; &gt; were only thoughts or words that regarded the understanding of the
&gt; &gt; said individual things within the mind.... Universals, therefore, do
&gt; &gt; not exist in and of themselves within the &quot;things&quot; but are the product
&gt; &gt; of the thinking mind in its own particular and peculiar (in some
&gt; &gt; cases) process of understanding the said &quot;things&quot;.... All  sort of
&gt; &gt; &quot;subjective&quot;.... the mind's understanding, that is.... of the
&gt; &gt; &quot;objective&quot; reality presented by the &quot;thing-in itself&quot;....
&gt; &gt; Your friend, Jan Braeken, sounds like a &quot;nominalist&quot;..... whether he
&gt; &gt; or she knows it or not.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am somewhat surprised and a bit.... disappointed.... that no one has

&gt; &gt; &gt; a socio-political phenomenon that here in the U.S. has been

&gt; &gt; &gt; Notice that the author in question, Charles Murray, is a relatively

&gt; &gt; &gt; samples&quot; regarding &quot;significant figures&quot;, for example.... significant

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another advantage of having an unbroken lineage of Jewish mothers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _____
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know if the &quot;link&quot; located at the &quot;here&quot; word will  come
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through or not so below is a &quot;paste&quot; of the article in question... I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hope this one works.... If it is too lengthy, perhaps the
&gt; &quot;moderator&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can condense  or render it as a &quot;show hidden text&quot; entry.  Anyway...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as you can see from David Chiefetz  quip above.... &quot;Another
&gt; advantage
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of having an unbroken lineage of Jewish mothers.&quot;.....Chiefetz,l at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least, along wirth Zack 27e also holds such (I call them) Zionist
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Racist &quot; Jewsish biological intellectual superiority&quot; views. As, of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course does the author of the cited article,below, Charles
&gt; Murray....
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which article is titled &quot;Jewish Genius&quot; and appears in a fairly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mainstream.... albeit &quot;Right of Center&quot; .... publication.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, maybe we can now &quot;discuss&quot; this issue of so-callled,
&gt; self-assumed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Jewish Genius&quot;  on its merits.... without falling into the
&gt; fallacious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; canard of aseerting that anyone who would &quot;question&quot; the claim of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jewish Genius must be an &quot;anti-Semite&quot; I hold that the exact
&gt; opposite
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; holds.... I say any self-respecting Jewish person who maintains such
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; view of Jewish intellectual superiority, on whatever grounds, should
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really consider just what the &quot;parallels&quot; to the Nazi &quot;uber-Mensch&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myth and a &quot;presumed&quot; Master Race, may be....

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, I was eventually &quot;censored out&quot; from Yahoo for  raising
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this issue, although I must give Yahoo credit for, at least,
&gt; publishig
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those posts which they did.... As for CompuServe and the Books and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Writer's Forum those Buffoons and Zionist Racist Censoring Sysops
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there did not even have the &quot;courage&quot; to  post my &quot;Rush Limbaugh
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pledge of Allegiance&quot; not to mention my Rush Limbough nick-name....
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; although it is quite clear that David Chiefetz.... sysop.... had
&gt; read
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and &quot;reacted&quot; to the said postings from Yahoo.....

Don't take it so personally. The evolution of life forms is full of
circumstances in which initial suppressions and disadvantages have
turned out to be &quot;blessings in disguise &quot; (pardon the expression)
for
the future advantage of a species. An example could be the
restriction
of mammals to a nocturnal existence in the complex forest milieu
during the dinosaur dominated era. This led to development of complex
sensitivities and behaviour patterns that favored the subsequent
expansion of mammals after the demise of the dinosaurs.
I see no logical reason as to why this cannot occur in the jungle of
developing civilisations. / Zinnic

Here's my problem with this whole Social Darwinism.... &quot;survival of
the fittest&quot;....&quot; life is a jungle&quot;.... thing. I propose to you and
others like you, Zinnic, that there is quite a difference between
&quot;Mankind&quot; and the rest of the &quot;Living Kingdom&quot; be they plant or
animal..... That difference is that &quot;Mankind&quot; has a &quot;functionally
developed&quot; intelligence and social system. Sure, there are ant
colonies and baboon troops that act somewhat intelligently, but
overall they are still not developed enough to appreciably alter their
&quot;real&quot; environment in order to consistently bend the natural world to
their own intellect and will. Mankind can and does do that.... bend
the natural world to its own intellect and will. All of which means,
to me, that Mankind works under somewhat different &quot;rules of the road&quot;
than do the &quot;lower plant and animal lifeforms&quot;.... Well, at least most
of the time. There are &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; and catastrophic
occasions when &quot;nature&quot; prevails, certainly.
So, where in the lower animal kingdom brute physical force may always
prevail.... in the &quot;mankind kingdom&quot;, an equalizing tool... rock,club,
knife, spear, sword, arrow, gun, cannon, missile, nuclear bomb....
always  trumps the said brute physical force. I think you get the
idea. Survival of the fittest, in the &quot;Mankind Kingdom&quot; favors other
definitions of &quot;fittest&quot;. And that does not just hold true in the area
of &quot;warfare&quot;.... but in the other areas, as well.  For example,
medicine can fix physical ailments so that someone who may be hampered
by somewhat weak eyesight can read and learn, nevertheless, due to
sight lenses or eye procedures as well as or even better that a
perfectly sighted other person, depending on the aptitude and training
of the two involved. And on and on. As to &quot;social&quot; matters, this means
that some People who may appear to be &quot;unfit&quot; in one area indeed prove
to be superior in other areas. http://www.hawking.org.uk/home/hindex.html
If the link works.... there is a  prime example of what I mean. But
don't get the wrong impression that I mean to say that &quot;fittest&quot; in
the &quot;Mankind Kingdom&quot; is to be equated ONLY with IQ or intelligence
either.... Human Fitness extends to all sorts of areas.... including
(what do you think?) the capacity for compassion and kindness to
others. Some people in the Christian area try to emulate and even in
some cases attain.... sainthood. Now what do you think that is all
about? But anyway, Zinnic.... I think you get the general idea..... My
question to you  (maybe, if you actually believe what you seem to say)
but more specifically to these MISGUIDED Social Darwinian sorts would
be..... why the heck do you IDIOTS want to EVOLVE BACKWARDS????
Zinnic, I have done a bit of prior reading into some of these socially
and politically backward sorts of individuals....  Among the most
&quot;influential&quot; ones in the U.S. sphere was a guy named Mencken..... I
really do not want to re-do my series of postings that de-bunked that
whole fraudulent line of thinking {of course, many others have de-
bunked Mencken, also}... but if you do follow or adhere to such views
and want to discuss them in particular, let me know and I will try to
do what I can to.... perhaps.... open your eyes to the truth (in my
own opinion, of course).

&gt; &gt; Hello Zinnic,
&gt; &gt; Nice to hear from you again. Your post, above, is in a &quot;practical
&gt; &gt; sense&quot; probably accurate enough.... but I always tend to look at
&gt; &gt; things from more of a &quot;thematic&quot; angle.... So, my question to you is,
&gt; &gt; regarding some of your comments, .... is that  GOOD or is that
&gt; &gt; BAD?.... But I do't want to appear to be picking on you personally so
&gt; &gt; I would rather treat the &quot;thematic&quot; issues, themselves.... I was sort
&gt; &gt; of struck and interested by your last comment, above,

&gt; &gt; &quot;I would be really surprised if it could not be shown that the
&gt; &gt; majority
&gt; &gt; of ruling classes did not exhibit at least a short period in which
&gt; &gt; their average IQ is significantly higher than that of the ruled.
&gt; &gt; Zinnic&quot;
&gt; &gt; So.... what do you think about this notion of &quot;class&quot; in general,
&gt; &gt; Zinnic?.... Are social &quot;classes&quot; GOOD or BAD, in an &quot;ethical&quot;
&gt; &gt; sense?..... And if they &quot;really&quot; do exist, as an &quot;ontological&quot; (read
&gt; &gt; &quot;factual&quot;) issue.... what are they (class distinctions) &quot;based&quot; on? Is
&gt; &gt; the distinction one of &quot;wealth&quot;, or &quot;government power&quot;, or
&gt; &gt; &quot;demonstrated intelligence&quot;, or &quot;military or brute force&quot;, or &quot;racial,
&gt; &gt; religious, sexual or ethnic difference&quot;?.... some combination of
&gt; &gt; these or something other that I haven't covered?

&gt; Neither good nor bad. Just the nature of things. Is it good that the
&gt; fleet win the race or bad that the slow lose? I was just expressing an
&gt; opinion that governing classes arise because they are the more
&gt; successful competitors in the  arena in which they happen to exist. .
&gt; This is not to say that there are not  innumerable other groups of
&gt; greater overall talent that could have taken control if the
&gt; circumstances had differed even by a single flap of a gnat's wing.

&gt; &gt; But I would also like to ask you.... &quot;thematically&quot; .... what do you
&gt; &gt; think of this &quot;winnowing&quot; arguement that was used by the &quot;Jewish
&gt; &gt; Genius&quot; author Charles Murray as a &quot;posited&quot; explanation for Jewish
&gt; &gt; higher IQ. I suppose that, according to Murray and from the standpoint
&gt; &gt; of &quot;adding&quot; to the betterment in IQ of the Jewish Race.... the
&gt; &gt; Babylonian Exile was a GOOD thing? Sure, ol' Nebuchadnezzar actually
&gt; &gt; did the Jews a favor by conquering the ancient Israeli kingdom and by
&gt; &gt; enslaving the Jews. Of course, according to this winnowing
&gt; &gt; &quot;rationale&quot;, it also follows that all historic &quot;presecution&quot; directed
&gt; &gt; at the Jews was also.... IQ beneficial. The historic &quot;occupartional
&gt; &gt; restrictions&quot; and the &quot;pogroms&quot; were all to the GOOD.... fine people
&gt; &gt; those Cossacks.... right? And of course, let's not forget the ultimate
&gt; &gt; in the &quot;winnowing&quot; experiance.... the WWII &quot;holocaust&quot;..... boy that
&gt; &gt; sure did get rid of a lot of the Jewish flotsam, didn't it? NOW THIS
&gt; &gt; IS THE EXTENT OF IDIOCY THAT THIS WHOLE SORT OF SOCIAL DARWINIAN
&gt; &gt; RACIST BUNK CAN LEAD TO... People start to &quot;assign&quot; morally &quot;GOOD&quot;
&gt; &gt; predicated values to completely &quot;BAD&quot; ideas and practices.....
&gt; &gt; What really gets to me is how the devil can some Jewish people....
&gt; &gt; such as the &quot;Jewish Genius&quot; David Chiefetz (and Alex Krislov?)....
&gt; &gt; fall for such racist bunk that actually &quot;extols the virtues&quot; of their
&gt; &gt; own persecution and genocide....

&gt; Don't take it so personally. The evolution of life forms is full of
&gt; circumstances in which initial suppressions and disadvantages have
&gt; turned out to be &quot;blessings in disguise &quot; (pardon the expression)  for
&gt; the future advantage of a species. An example could be the restriction
&gt; of mammals to a nocturnal existence in the complex forest milieu

&gt; sensitivities and behaviour patterns that favored the subsequent
&gt; expansion of mammals after the demise of the dinosaurs.
&gt; I see no logical reason as to why this cannot occur in the jungle of
&gt; developing civilisations.

&gt; &gt; So, if you see this and want to answer, Zinnic, I would be glad to
&gt; &gt; hear it. Next time, maybe I will take a &quot;thematic&quot; look at the
&gt; &gt; &quot;Marrying for brains&quot; rationale posited by author Charles Murray....

&gt; This is not to say that the proposed Jewish story is not active
&gt; speculation, but one cannot forswear that it is a story. Lighten up
&gt; and enjoy. I am a plain man, but I am not a serious homo sapiens
&gt; sapiens
&gt; Zinnic&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello einseele,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding your comment.... &quot;Lot of trash here&quot;.... I agree, but I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to assert in my &quot;defense&quot; that I only reply in kind to what I get from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others.... As I said to Georges on another post.... really.... my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stance is &quot;If you spit in my face.... soooner or later I will spit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right back at you&quot;. As you saw.... in those Yahoo postings.... Zack
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 27e spit in my face by calling me a &quot;mongrel&quot;.... The Racist
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overtones  in that insult are more than obvious....a mongrel being a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dog of mixed or uncertain breed, but also referring to people of mixed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; race or of uncertain or somehow &quot;illegitimate&quot; (Bastard) lineage.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Considering the gravity and the outright bigotry of the said insult
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directed at me, I thought I was being rather &quot;lenient&quot; in just poking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fun at Zack27e by pointing out the &quot;analogous&quot;.... &quot;pure-bred&quot;....
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alternative of a &quot;Holstein Cow&quot;, also taken from the animal world and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asking if he.... Zack 27e..... (and maybe others who think likewise)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consider themselves as such..... like pure-bred cows, that is. Anyway,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my point is not just.... trivial.... and a matter of  &quot;name-calling&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are many others.... Jewish people, I mean... who hold these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;racial superiority&quot; views  as a matter of genetic or cultural
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certainty.... look at the interchange that I had on another message

Hello nominal

I wanted to pick up this comment of you

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I think this is true, there is somehow something new in this &quot;Mankind
Kingdom&quot; as you said
To me this is the appearance of language
Before mankind, information is passed out to the next generation
through DNA only, and we have here something new.
Language also can pass the information, giving and extra bonus and
something original.
That information does not consist in something physical, is matter
independent
Seems that next step in evolution not necessarily is in the field of
&quot;life&quot;. Or may be we have to change life definitions.

Please see below something extracted from &quot;Life in the Universe&quot; by
Stephen Hawking:

...&quot;But with the human race, evolution reached a critical stage,
comparable in importance with the development of DNA. This was the
development of language, and particularly written language. It meant
that information can be passed on, from generation to generation,
other than genetically, through DNA. There has been no detectable
change in human DNA, brought about by biological evolution, in the ten
thousand years of recorded history. But the amount of knowledge handed
on from generation to generation has grown enormously. The DNA in
human beings contains about three billion nucleic acids. However, much
of the information coded in this sequence, is redundant, or is
inactive. So the total amount of useful information in our genes, is
probably something like a hundred million bits. One bit of information
is the answer to a yes no question. By contrast, a paper back novel
might contain two million bits of information. So a human is
equivalent to 50 Mills and Boon romances. A major national library can
contain about five million books, or about ten trillion bits. So the
amount of information handed down in books, is a hundred thousand
times as much as in DNA.&quot;

I could not agree more, specially to the comparison of DNA and
Language. Language is some kind of DNA on its own, and as Hawking
said, specially when you look to written language.

Hello Pete,

I am very glad you wrote this. It is the best lesson in good manners. Since
you cannot delete my post, the best you can do is accept it. Good manners
have always been part of epistemology, and they will remain so for ever.
Nobody can erase them. I hope you will have the luck to find somebody to
give you compassion as well when you need it. For that keeps us alive.

Cheers.

Jan

I have been in similar circumstances and the situation did not work

&gt; What my friend is concerned, I am sorry to say that I no longer consider
him
&gt; as a friend from today on. He certainly is not a nominalist - he despises
&gt; philosophy -, and he is a non-emotional infant I have to decide, now that
it
&gt; seems to please him projecting any kind of his own frustrations that he
can
&gt; come up with upon me. I'm sure that if he would take part in this forum he
&gt; would realise that, but that's up to him. I will no longer waste my time
&gt; with this man. We won't see him here either I'm afraid, ever.

&gt; What our &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot; is concerned, I believe
&gt; those ideas cannot be separated from the context of language. The meaning
of
&gt; those conceptions (or inventions) cannot be separated from the whole of
our

it's
&gt; first origins, including all cultures, up till now).

&gt; Thanks again Nomi,

&gt; Hello Jan Braeken.....
&gt; I like your comment regarding &quot;universal truth&quot;.... I have long held
&gt; the view that so-called &quot;Universals&quot; really do not exist in and of
&gt; themselves.... Actually, in saying this I only agree with the view
&gt; held by my &quot;buddy&quot; and mentor.... William of Ockham ( I affectionately
&gt; call him &quot;Billy-O&quot;).... who's whole theory regarding the distinction
&gt; between &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot;... VOX... is all
&gt; about this issue of the distinction between the actual
&gt; &quot;intuited&quot; (i.e., empirical) individual example [First Intention] and
&gt; the process of grouping or association of many such &quot;similar&quot; thought
&gt; examples, &quot;abstractly&quot;, within the mind and their communication
&gt; through memory and language, etc.[Second Intention]. Ockham thought
&gt; that there were only &quot;individual things&quot; and that the &quot;universals&quot;
&gt; were only thoughts or words that regarded the understanding of the
&gt; said individual things within the mind.... Universals, therefore, do
&gt; not exist in and of themselves within the &quot;things&quot; but are the product
&gt; of the thinking mind in its own particular and peculiar (in some
&gt; cases) process of understanding the said &quot;things&quot;.... All  sort of
&gt; &quot;subjective&quot;.... the mind's understanding, that is.... of the
&gt; &quot;objective&quot; reality presented by the &quot;thing-in itself&quot;....
&gt; Your friend, Jan Braeken, sounds like a &quot;nominalist&quot;..... whether he
&gt; or she knows it or not.

&gt; &gt; &gt; asking if he.... Zack 27e..... (and maybe others who think likewise)
&gt; &gt; &gt; consider themselves as such..... like pure-bred cows, that is. Anyway,
&gt; &gt; &gt; my point is not just.... trivial.... and a matter of  &quot;name-calling&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are many others.... Jewish people, I mean... who hold these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;racial superiority&quot; views  as a matter of genetic or cultural
&gt; &gt; &gt; certainty.... look at the interchange that I had on another message
&gt; &gt; &gt; board, Compuserve Books and Writers Forum with a certain David
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chiefetz that I reproduce, below....
&gt; &gt; &gt; #400 of 408     Posted Apr-6 9:29 PM

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From  David Cheifetz  Posts 523  Last 2:06 AM

&gt; &gt; &gt; Another advantage of having an unbroken lineage of Jewish mothers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know if the &quot;link&quot; located at the &quot;here&quot; word will  come
&gt; &gt; &gt; through or not so below is a &quot;paste&quot; of the article in question... I
&gt; &gt; &gt; hope this one works.... If it is too lengthy, perhaps the &quot;moderator&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; can condense  or render it as a &quot;show hidden text&quot; entry.  Anyway...
&gt; &gt; &gt; as you can see from David Chiefetz  quip above.... &quot;Another advantage
&gt; &gt; &gt; of having an unbroken lineage of Jewish mothers.&quot;.....Chiefetz,l at
&gt; &gt; &gt; least, along wirth Zack 27e also holds such (I call them) Zionist
&gt; &gt; &gt; Racist &quot; Jewsish biological intellectual superiority&quot; views. As, of
&gt; &gt; &gt; course does the author of the cited article,below, Charles Murray....
&gt; &gt; &gt; which article is titled &quot;Jewish Genius&quot; and appears in a fairly
&gt; &gt; &gt; mainstream.... albeit &quot;Right of Center&quot; .... publication.
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, maybe we can now &quot;discuss&quot; this issue of so-callled, self-assumed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Jewish Genius&quot;  on its merits.... without falling into the fallacious
&gt; &gt; &gt; canard of aseerting that anyone who would &quot;question&quot; the claim of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jewish Genius must be an &quot;anti-Semite&quot; I hold that the exact opposite
&gt; &gt; &gt; holds.... I say any self-respecting Jewish person who maintains such a
&gt; &gt; &gt; view of Jewish intellectual superiority, on whatever grounds, should
&gt; &gt; &gt; really consider just what the &quot;parallels&quot; to the Nazi &quot;uber-Mensch&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; myth and a &quot;presumed&quot; Master Race, may be....

&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, I was eventually &quot;censored out&quot; from Yahoo for  raising
&gt; &gt; &gt; this issue, although I must give Yahoo credit for, at least, publishig
&gt; &gt; &gt; those posts which they did.... As for CompuServe and the Books and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Writer's Forum those Buffoons and Zionist Racist Censoring Sysops
&gt; &gt; &gt; there did not even have the &quot;courage&quot; to  post my &quot;Rush

Dear Jan,

I am ever so sorry being rude.

But science is not an entertainment centre

No idiot would go to a doctor for an appendix operation, who is
pussyfooting.
If you dont cut you are dead. D E A D.

You cannot take out a car from a repairshop if the ignition does not work.
No idiot pay for that.

If your TV/PC is running on 10 Hertz refreshment, you will have no real
picture.

If your space shuttle is not perfect, it blows up. You end up DEAD.

Science is precision. If you do not know the difference between Jews,
politics and science,
you have no business and credibility to be serious in science.

You cannot call physics and roof guttering epistemology. Pleeeease!!!!

You want an intellectual chatterbox, cool, I subscribe to that.

But do some homework too. Dont start talking about infinity, if you know
nothing about it.

Hey friend,

Thank you for your fine post.

I have to take a short break. Too much for me for the moment.

Take care. Do not forget to have a rest as well.

Cheers friend.

&gt; &gt; &quot;educated&quot; [Harvard and MIT] and even &quot;respected&quot; academic figure....
&gt; &gt; sort of makes ME wonder how such IVY LEAGUE, TOP SHELF institutions of
&gt; &gt; higher learning can allow such.... RACIST BUNK.... to come forth
&gt; &gt; either from or through their academic aegises.
&gt; &gt; What the heck kind of Statistical Methods was this guy using, when he
&gt; &gt; states that his statitical data either was not or cannot be adequately
&gt; &gt; &quot;differentiated&quot;? And how the devil did he come up with his &quot;core data
&gt; &gt; samples&quot; regarding &quot;significant figures&quot;, for example.... significant

I was sort of... peeved... by Peter's self-assuming &quot;arrogance and
presumption&quot; in asserting that &quot;epistemology&quot; is  the &quot;exclusive&quot;
concern and  and area of interest scientific inquiry. Now, I always
throught that &quot;epistemology was more  within the domain of
Philosophical inquiry, so I did a Google search...
Here is the first (and foremost?) entry that I found there... a sort
of compendium of definitions of &quot;epistemology&quot; as understood from  or
by variaous disciplines.
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;defl;=en&amp;q;=define:Epistemology&amp;sa;=X...

Definitions of Epistemology on the Web:

The study of what is meant by &quot;knowledge&quot;. What does it mean to &quot;know&quot;
something as opposed to merely having an opinion. This issue has been
at the core of Western philosophy since before Socrates, since, until
it has been answered, all other questions become unsolvable.

An area of philosophical study that focuses on our understanding of
knowledge. Epistemology asks questions about what is true and false,

origin and scope of knowledge.
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology

Find definitions of Epistemology in:   English  Russian  all languages

......
Sorry, Peter... but the majority of these definitions and sources,
above, associate &quot;epistemology&quot; with  Philosophy and with knowledge in
general.... I really don't see where you get off being so......
parrochial and boorish.... about so-called scientific knowledge, in
particular. Besides....  so-called  &quot;pure&quot;scientific (i.e., Physics)
knowledge, is so..... self-limiting..... it rarely if ever considers
any sort of &quot;human&quot; issues that are not consistently repeatable, as
unchanging results of experiment..... all so &quot;deterministic&quot; in it's
approach.... unlike people, there's no &quot;Free Will&quot; in &quot;inanimate&quot;
things. So, Peter, even if you and I disagree, I hope you will
recognize that &quot;epistemology&quot; has other &quot;senses&quot; or &quot;denotations&quot; or
&quot;connotations&quot; other that the &quot;scientific&quot;.... But hey, if you want to
discuss a &quot;purely&quot; Physics/ Mathematics definition or sense of
&quot;epistemology&quot;..... let me hear you say something &quot;epistemological&quot; in
your &quot;scientific&quot; argot.... Who know's maybe I can discuss
&quot;epistemology&quot; on your terms, as well. Heck. I am still trying to get
Georges to explain what he means  when says that Mass cannot be
observed.... I don't think he really knows what he means, himself.

Half of the url references did not work, half of them are list of
definitions, nothing to do with epistemology.

I sincerely apologize.

I do not want to hurt.

I want to learn.

Religion and priests caused me lot of pain.

My only escape is knowledge. My mother was in german concentration camp. my
father spent 4 years in Odessa.

I grew up in Hungary, our street was a chock of block of Russian thanks.

I feel no sorry for myself, no poor me. I am arrogant, disillusioned. Not
necessarily my fault.

But nothing is negotiable when it comes to truth.

I just received books by Smolin, Edelmann, Greene, Hofstadter, Penrose,
Richard Dawkins.

These guys are merciless when it comes to truth.

Why dont you join them? There is so much shit in the vatican and muslim
world?

Is there a point dying stupid??

Anyway. forgive me. There is nothing wrong with you. Blame me. I am happy to
be an asshole.
I just dont want to die stupider as I was born. It is not a sin, isn't it?

&gt; &gt; What my friend is concerned, I am sorry to say that I no longer consider

&gt; him
&gt; &gt; as a friend from today on. He certainly is not a nominalist - he
&gt; despises
&gt; &gt; philosophy -, and he is a non-emotional infant I have to decide, now
&gt; that
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; seems to please him projecting any kind of his own frustrations that he
&gt; can
&gt; &gt; come up with upon me. I'm sure that if he would take part in this forum
&gt; he
&gt; &gt; would realise that, but that's up to him. I will no longer waste my time
&gt; &gt; with this man. We won't see him here either I'm afraid, ever.

&gt; &gt; What our &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot; is concerned, I
&gt; believe
&gt; &gt; those ideas cannot be separated from the context of language. The
&gt; meaning
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; those conceptions (or inventions) cannot be separated from the whole of
&gt; our
&gt; &gt; language, and everybody that uses it (meaning humanity as a whole from
&gt; it's
&gt; &gt; first origins, including all cultures, up till now).

&gt; &gt; Hello Jan Braeken.....
&gt; &gt; I like your comment regarding &quot;universal truth&quot;.... I have long held
&gt; &gt; the view that so-called &quot;Universals&quot; really do not exist in and of
&gt; &gt; themselves.... Actually, in saying this I only agree with the view
&gt; &gt; held by my &quot;buddy&quot; and mentor.... William of Ockham ( I affectionately
&gt; &gt; call him &quot;Billy-O&quot;).... who's whole theory regarding the distinction
&gt; &gt; between &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot;... VOX... is all
&gt; &gt; about this issue of the distinction between the actual
&gt; &gt; &quot;intuited&quot; (i.e., empirical) individual example [First Intention] and
&gt; &gt; the process of grouping or association of many such &quot;similar&quot; thought
&gt; &gt; examples, &quot;abstractly&quot;, within the mind and their communication
&gt; &gt; through memory and language, etc.[Second Intention]. Ockham thought
&gt; &gt; that there were only &quot;individual things&quot; and that the &quot;universals&quot;
&gt; &gt; were only thoughts or words that regarded the understanding of the
&gt; &gt; said individual things within the mind.... Universals, therefore, do
&gt; &gt; not exist in and of themselves within the &quot;things&quot; but are the product
&gt; &gt; of the thinking mind in its own particular and peculiar (in some
&gt; &gt; cases) process of understanding the said &quot;things&quot;.... All  sort of
&gt; &gt; &quot;subjective&quot;.... the mind's understanding, that is.... of the
&gt; &gt; &quot;objective&quot; reality presented by the &quot;thing-in itself&quot;....
&gt; &gt; Your friend, Jan Braeken, sounds like a &quot;nominalist&quot;..... whether he
&gt; &gt; or she knows it or not.

&gt; the recent Race and Culture postings on this site. I guess my
&gt; &quot;observation&quot; directed to Georges, in particular, and perhaps others,
&gt; too who have aspoken to this issue is..... Whatever your own personal
&gt; &quot;definitions&quot; of &quot;race&quot; may  be either &quot;genetic&quot; or &quot;social&quot;.... One
&gt; still must deal with the &quot;Racist&quot; personalities out there.... of

&gt; they may be.... They.... the Racists... exist in  every ... group.

&gt; &quot;I&quot; Zack.... I asked you on another post, which I don't know if you
&gt; saw, if I had run into you before, as well.... Are you that Italian
&gt; (Jewish, really) Travelin' fella that I had other runins with on AOL
&gt; message boards?
&gt; If so.... have you met Alice, yet? you two have a lot in common...
&gt; That's my&quot;originally authored&quot; Rush Limbaugh Pledge of Allegiance that
&gt; you quoted there...
&gt; ****
&gt; I pledge allegiance to the Star of David of the Zionist State of
&gt; Israel, and to the racist oligarchy for which it stands. One Kingdom,
&gt; under the ineffable Yahweh, exclusive, with criminal license and
&gt; prejudgment in favor just of Jews.

&gt; I though that up myself....
&gt; ****
&gt; If you are who I think you are... &quot;I&quot; Zack... do you remember my &quot;nick-
&gt; name&quot; for Rush, too????
&gt; It was....
&gt; &quot;El Kosher Pork-Off.... the circumcised Prick and Fount of Zionist
&gt; Gizm&quot;

&gt; Say hello to Alice... you two Zionist Racist Jews have a lot in
&gt; common.... both evident bigoted &quot;stalkers&quot;. Boy.... this is like a
&gt; &quot;reunion&quot;....
&gt; nominal9
&gt; ______

&gt; Of course, mongrels such as yourself / Zack27e

&gt; Another &quot;Rabid&quot; Zionist Racist Jew????
&gt; Now, who could you be????
&gt; I am a &quot;mongrel&quot;.... hey? As opposed to a &quot;pure bred&quot;? That would be
&gt; you right, Zack? A &quot;pure bred&quot;.... Jewish through and through, are
&gt; you? Born of a Jewish mother (the father isn't as important)....and
&gt; proud of it?.... Can you trace your &quot;lineage&quot; back for
&gt; generations?....
&gt; Zack, you must be on a par with... say, a Holstein cow.... Zack, sired
&gt; of Jesse. Daughter of Molly. Daughter of Bessy, Daughter of Patches.
&gt; Daughter of Rebecca. Daughter of Alice.... etc. etc. etc.
&gt; nominal9
&gt; Zack....remember when I told you to stick your thumb up your ass?
&gt; Ya didn't listen, did Ya?.... I can tell because I still hear ya
&gt; talkin'.....
&gt; Think about it....
&gt; Right over his head.... I just know it...
&gt; That's easy to understand, though.... considerin' where his head IS
&gt; situated.... kinda low in relation to his body....

&gt; I&quot; Zack..... at least contienda for all her...er ...his flaws had the
&gt; &quot;integrity&quot; to be honest....(let's see if Alice shows up

&gt; &gt; despises
&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy -, and he is a non-emotional infant I have to decide, now
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems to please him projecting any kind of his own frustrations that he
&gt; &gt; can

&gt; &gt; he
&gt; &gt; &gt; would realise that, but that's up to him. I will no longer waste my time

&gt; &gt; &gt; What our &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot; is concerned, I
&gt; &gt; believe
&gt; &gt; &gt; those ideas cannot be separated from the context of language. The
&gt; &gt; meaning
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; those conceptions (or inventions) cannot be separated from the whole of

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am very glad you wrote this. It is the best lesson in good manners.

&gt; Good
&gt; &gt; &gt; manners have always been part of epistemology, and they will remain so

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry to hear about your &quot;differences&quot; with your friend, Jan Braeken.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been in similar circumstances and the situation did not work
&gt; &gt; &gt; out well for me.... ever.
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, I cannot and will not presume to give any &quot;encouraging&quot; words of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What my friend is concerned, I am sorry to say that I no longer
&gt; consider

&gt; &gt; &gt; him
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a friend from today on. He certainly is not a nominalist - he
&gt; &gt; &gt; despises
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy -, and he is a non-emotional infant I have to decide, now
&gt; &gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to please him projecting any kind of his own frustrations that
&gt; he
&gt; &gt; &gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come up with upon me. I'm sure that if he would take part in this
&gt; forum
&gt; &gt; &gt; he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would realise that, but that's up to him. I will no longer waste my
&gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with this man. We won't see him here either I'm afraid, ever.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What our &quot;First Intention&quot; and &quot;Second Intention&quot; is concerned, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those ideas cannot be separated from the context of language. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; meaning
&gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those conceptions (or inventions) cannot be separated from the whole
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; language, and everybody that uses it (meaning humanity as a whole
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first origins, including all cultures, up till now).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again Nomi,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Jan,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am ever so sorry being rude.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But science is not an entertainment centre

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No idiot would go to a doctor for an appendix operation, who is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pussyfooting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you dont cut you are dead. D E A D.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot take out a car from a repairshop if the ignition does not
&gt; &gt; work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No idiot pay for that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If your TV/PC is running on 10 Hertz refreshment, you will have no
&gt; &gt; real
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picture.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If your space shuttle is not perfect, it blows up. You end up DEAD.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Science is precision. If you do not know the difference between
&gt; &gt; Jews,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; politics and science,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you have no business and credibility to be serious in science.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot call physics and roof guttering epistemology.
&gt; &gt; Pleeeease!!!!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You want an intellectual chatterbox, cool, I subscribe to that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But do some homework too. Dont start talking about infinity, if you
&gt; &gt; know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nothing about it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; var fs_time=(new Date()).getTime();
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; function wfs() {
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try {
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if (parent!=window &amp;&amp; parent.wfs) {
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return false;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if (top.location.href.indexOf('nocheckbrowser')!=-1) {

&gt; &gt; &gt; Pleeeease!!!!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You want an intellectual chatterbox, cool, I subscribe to that.

Hey Peter,

Take a break. You read too much. It causes your brain to short circuit. Have
a rest.

You are a good man, don't you forget that. You are very important on this
forum.

But don't stress yourself so much. You do not have to prove here that you
are somebody, because you already are. Believe me.

Cheers to you.

Please accept my apologies. I am not a genius like you.

Forgive me being an average software engineer.

I am devastated being a nobody.

I consider to shoot myself now for my nothingness.

Cool. Edelmann is only a noble laurate.

Smolin is just a string theory professor.
Greene is a genious

these guys are leading experts.

Of course, it is sin and the heaviest. It's for
picking
an apple from the tree of knowledge that we were
expelled from the paradise of stupidity. I'm glad to
be
out and, apparently, you too, but most people don't
accept the expulsion verdict and stick to the dream
of never having left the Eden of idiots.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Jan,

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am ever so sorry being rude.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But science is not an entertainment centre

&gt; &gt; &gt; No idiot would go to a doctor for an appendix operation, who is

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you dont cut you are dead. D E A D.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot take out a car from a repairshop if the ignition does not

&gt; &gt; &gt; No idiot pay for that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If your TV/PC is running on 10 Hertz refreshment, you will have no
&gt; real
&gt; &gt; &gt; picture.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If your space shuttle is not perfect, it blows up. You end up DEAD.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Science is precision. If you do not know the difference between Jews,
&gt; &gt; &gt; politics and science,
&gt; &gt; &gt; you have no business and credibility to be serious in science.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot call physics and roof guttering epistemology. Pleeeease!!!!

&gt; &gt; &gt; You want an intellectual chatterbox, cool, I subscribe to that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But do some homework too. Dont start talking about infinity, if you

Alright already..... Peter and, yes, you too Georges.... Enough with
the hiding behind women's skirts and the whining like spoiled little
boys before their overly indulgent mothers..... Let's get to the real
issues.... Do you two actually &quot;believe&quot; that at least some Jewish
people, like the Ashkenazi, are &quot;genetically&quot; predisposed for greater
biological intelligence than other non-Jewish people..... I mean from
a very hard-nosed, scientifically provable standpoint..... what is
your theory and data for your answers?

Here is a possibility. Jews have been hounded across the globe for
thousands of years. To survive they have had to employ cunning and
care to escape detection, envoke disguise, and seek concealment. The
survivors have sought usury and other means of collection of cash as
this has enabled them to keep on the move and survive in hostile
social and political environments. Jews with less guile and
intelligence have not made it. They have either lost their sense of
Jewishness by fading into the local cultures or have been persecuted
and failed to promote any progeny. Thus the modern Western Jew is far
more likely to be equipped with intelligence and a strong family ethic
than many around him, he is likely to have ancestors who were
achievers.
Indeed we might reasonably consider that other groups who have
suffered prejudice for many generation could also have improvements in
thier survivability.
So to all those straw chewin', red-necked, hood wearing bigots out
there who consider the &quot;white man&quot; superior, think agin!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Jan,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am ever so sorry being rude.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But science is not an entertainment centre

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No idiot would go to a doctor for an appendix operation, who is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pussyfooting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you dont cut you are dead. D E A D.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot take out a car from a repairshop if the ignition does not
&gt; &gt; &gt; work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No idiot pay for that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If your TV/PC is running on 10 Hertz refreshment, you will have no
&gt; &gt; &gt; real
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picture.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If your space shuttle is not perfect, it blows up. You end up DEAD.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Science is precision. If you do not know the difference between Jews,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; politics and science,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you have no business and credibility to be serious in science.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot call physics and roof guttering epistemology. Pleeeease!!!!

So.... Chazwin....
Are you saying (I ask in a very purposeful.... &quot;instigating&quot; ....
manner) that the Ashke-NAZI are the TRUE NAZI.... the master race?
Winnowed out (through persecution and genocide) and intermarried
racially for..... brains???? So, I take it that you agree almost

No they are no Nazis but they might be better equipped to survive in
the Western world due to their persecution. I think the evidence is
clear enough. Jews are in control of key positions in politics,
science and businesses throughout the Western world.
I would be cautious of any scientific study of the genetics of this
situation as there is no such thing as a &quot;jewish gene&quot;, nor are jews a
&quot;race&quot;. But any study which would canvas those calling themselves
Jewish or from Jewish origins I think would demonstrate that Jews are
a highly successful sub-group. It is so blindingly obvious. Get over
it!

&gt; &gt; &gt; nominal9

&gt; &gt; Here is a possibility. Jews have been hounded across the globe for
&gt; &gt; thousands of years. To survive they have had to employ cunning and
&gt; &gt; care to escape detection, envoke disguise, and seek concealment. The
&gt; &gt; survivors have sought usury and other means of collection of cash as
&gt; &gt; this has enabled them to keep on the move and survive in hostile
&gt; &gt; social and political environments. Jews with less guile and
&gt; &gt; intelligence have not made it. They have either lost their sense of
&gt; &gt; Jewishness by fading into the local cultures or have been persecuted
&gt; &gt; and failed to promote any progeny. Thus the modern Western Jew is far
&gt; &gt; more likely to be equipped with intelligence and a strong family ethic
&gt; &gt; than many around him, he is likely to have ancestors who were
&gt; &gt; achievers.
&gt; &gt; Indeed we might reasonably consider that other groups who have
&gt; &gt; suffered prejudice for many generation could also have improvements in
&gt; &gt; thier survivability.
&gt; &gt; So to all those straw chewin', red-necked, hood wearing bigots out
&gt; &gt; there who consider the &quot;white man&quot; superior, think agin!

&quot;genetically&quot; predisposed for greater biological intelligence than other
non-Jewish people

I am not sure what do you ask? is genetic predispositions for intelligence a
fact?

The DNA human gene mapping current position is that 95-98% is junk coding.
Genetic code, molecules, atoms have no foresights to information processing.
Genes, DNA build tissues.

There is simply no genetic predisposition. Much more can be/was written
about it, but the answer is short.

There is no genetic predisposition. That is what you ask?

German/ Jewish  -whatever Uebermensch superiority is man made.Non-scientific

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Jan,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am ever so sorry being rude.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But science is not an entertainment centre

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No idiot would go to a doctor for an appendix operation, who is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pussyfooting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you dont cut you are dead. D E A D.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot take out a car from a repairshop if the ignition does
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No idiot pay for that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If your TV/PC is running on 10 Hertz refreshment, you will have no
&gt; &gt; &gt; real
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picture.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If your space shuttle is not perfect, it blows up. You end up
&gt; DEAD.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Science is precision. If you do not know the difference between
&gt; Jews,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; politics and science,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you have no business and credibility to be serious in science.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot call physics and roof guttering epistemology.
&gt; Pleeeease!!!!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You want an intellectual chatterbox, cool, I subscribe to that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But do some homework too. Dont start talking about infinity, if
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nothing about it.

No they are no Nazis but they might be better equipped to survive in
the Western world due to their persecution. I think the evidence is
clear enough. Jews are in control of key positions in politics,
science and businesses throughout the Western world.
I would be cautious of any scientific study of the genetics of this
situation as there is no such thing as a &quot;jewish gene&quot;, nor are jews
a
&quot;race&quot;. But any study which would canvas those calling themselves
Jewish or from Jewish origins I think would demonstrate that Jews are
a highly successful sub-group. It is so blindingly obvious. Get over
it!

I don't know, Chaz.... if I were to assert, for instance, that the
&quot;elites&quot; in the U.S. are controlled by the Jews..... I would likely be
&quot;labelled&quot; a Racist or an anti-Semite..... and yet, you (as, I
presume, a Jew) say the same thing.... pretty much.... and vaunt it as
&quot;proof&quot; of (your own?) &quot;Jewish&quot; worth. Which way do you and the Jews
(ethnicity or religion or race) want it? Are you &quot;discriminated
against&quot; as a group or are you just &quot;naturally&quot; worthy of being...
&quot;discriminated for&quot;?
But anyway.... here's another possibility. Let's suppose, as a
hypothesis, that the &quot;reason&quot; for this &quot;apparent&quot; Jewish dominance in
many areas is not any greater aptitude but may be due to some sort of
&quot;clannishness&quot; or &quot;old-boy network&quot; (i.e., Racism), at play.
Let's take you, for instance, Chazwin. (Even if you are not Jewish,
let us &quot;posit&quot; you as the &quot;exemplar&quot; for your own &quot;Stereotypical&quot; Jew,
Chazwin) .... I assume that you are relatively &quot;successful&quot; in
whatever area of endeavour you are engaged in..... So, how did you get
where you are today?.... Did you get there because of &quot;family&quot;....
inherit a business, money or property? Did you get there because of
&quot;training&quot;? Who were your teachers or mentors.... other &quot;Jews&quot;, maybe,
and did they give you &quot;preference&quot; in tutelage over non-Jews? If you
went into the employ of someone else.... other than &quot;family&quot;.... are
or were these others Jews, too? And how do you advance within your
area.... is it through some sort of testing or qualification
examinations...... detective or civil service exams..... or is it
through.... well, cozying up to the boss?....
I think that this alternative.... theory.... of  Zionist Racism.... is
at least as &quot;plausible&quot; as yours, Chazwin, and much more.....
empirically provable as a factual matter.... given the facts and
history of (some) Jewish traditions and  customs.... as well as the
recent &quot;political' (?) history surrounding the founding of Israel.....

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nominal9

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is a possibility. Jews have been hounded across the globe for
&gt; &gt; &gt; thousands of years. To survive they have had to employ cunning and
&gt; &gt; &gt; care to escape detection, envoke disguise, and seek concealment. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; survivors have sought usury and other means of collection of cash as
&gt; &gt; &gt; this has enabled them to keep on the move and survive in hostile
&gt; &gt; &gt; social and political environments. Jews with less guile and
&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligence have not made it. They have either lost their sense of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jewishness by fading into the local cultures or have been persecuted
&gt; &gt; &gt; and failed to promote any progeny. Thus the modern Western Jew is far
&gt; &gt; &gt; more likely to be equipped with intelligence and a strong family ethic
&gt; &gt; &gt; than many around him, he is likely to have ancestors who were
&gt; &gt; &gt; achievers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed we might reasonably consider that other groups who have
&gt; &gt; &gt; suffered prejudice for many generation could also have improvements in
&gt; &gt; &gt; thier survivability.
&gt; &gt; &gt; So to all those straw chewin', red-necked, hood wearing bigots out
&gt; &gt; &gt; there who consider the &quot;white man&quot; superior, think agin!

I am not sure what do you ask? is genetic predispositions for
intelligence a
fact?

The DNA human gene mapping current position is that 95-98% is junk
coding.
Genetic code, molecules, atoms have no foresights to information
processing.
Genes, DNA build tissues.

There is simply no genetic predisposition. Much more can be/was
written
about it, but the answer is short.

There is no genetic predisposition. That is what you ask?

Hello, Peter
Personally, I like your answer and &quot;want&quot; to believe it. However, I
must also ask if it is &quot;provable&quot; as a matter of &quot;fact&quot;. As you
probably know... there are &quot;others&quot; who say otherwise.... Let me re-
direct your attention to some &quot;ostensible&quot; fact-based research that
asserts otherwise, as referenced in the Murray article, above, Cochran
and Hardy.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_intelligence

&quot;Cochran et al.
The 2005 study Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence[2] by Gregory
Cochran, Jason Hardy, and Henry Harpending at the University of Utah
noted that European Jews were forbidden to work in many of the common
jobs of the middle-ages from C.E. 800 to 1700, such as agriculture,
and subsequently worked in high proportion in meritocratic jobs
requiring higher intelligence, such as finance and trade, some of
which were forbidden to non-Jews by the church. Those who performed
better are known to have raised more children to adulthood, according
to Cochran et al., passing on their genes in greater proportion than
those who performed less successfully.[3]

Cochran et al. hypothesized that the eugenic pressure was strong
enough that mutations creating higher intelligence when inherited from
one parent but creating disease when inherited from both parents would
still be selected for, which could explain the unusual pattern of
genetic diseases found in the Ashkenazi population, such as Tay-Sachs,
Gaucher's disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Mucolipidosis type IV, and
other lipid storage disorders and sphingolipid diseases.[4] Some of
these diseases (especially torsion dystonia) have been shown to
correlate with high intelligence, and others are known to cause
neurons to grow an increased number of connections to neighboring
neurons.[5]

Reviews of the controversial paper have been both positive and
negative, with critics claiming the argument to be far-fetched and
unsupported by direct evidence.[4] Many genetically-isolated human
groups have faced multifarious adaptive pressures one could cherry
pick to justify presently exhibited group traits.[6]&quot;

Now, the wikipedia entry does give both sides of the &quot;academic&quot;
dispute (and I can read it well enough, myself) but  I would like to
ask your opinion, Peter..... What is it that makes you &quot;doubt&quot; the
truth or the factual validity of these so-called &quot;Psychometric
Findings&quot;?

'must also ask if it is &quot;provable&quot; as a matter of &quot;fact&quot;

So is the Ashkenazi survey. There are lies, bigger lies and statistics. If
you have a look at gallop survey, any stats sampling, there is a huge
vulnerability to errors, fallacies, which is well studied and documented by
statisticians, mathematicians.

1. who has done the control check on that?
2. was any counter check an unintelligent 'ashkenazis'?
3. IQ check has been psychologically long time ago criticized as a
nonreliable test.
4. I would like to see an IQ test worldwide on the intelligence of Indians,
Chinese, Germans, Anglo-saxons, Russians etc. You would be surprised, how
ashkenazis would be minorities.
5. Many cultures had tremendous intellectual contributions - Inkas,
Egyptians, Arabs, Greek, Italian.
6. Knowledge migrated from Babylonia (Persians, today Iraq) Abyssinia,
Phoenicia ... to the Egyptians. Moses was found in the basket and educated
in the Egyptian Pharao's court in maths, medical, architectural, political
sciences, religion etc. He took the knowledge with him to the Jews.

Minorities, oppressed people tried to survive on their resources.
Have a look at asian faces in Australia, US unis, how they excel in
comparison to the locals.
Check out Indian cosmologists, mathematicians, etc in the world scientific
literature.
I doubt there is any match of ashkenazis.

There are zillions of statistics trying to prove their point. You wanna
compile one, you can.

&gt; Hello, Peter
&gt; Personally, I like your answer and &quot;want&quot; to believe it. However, I
&gt; must also ask if it is &quot;provable&quot; as a matter of &quot;fact&quot;. As you
&gt; probably know... there are &quot;others&quot; who say otherwise.... Let me re-
&gt; direct your attention to some &quot;ostensible&quot; fact-based research that
&gt; asserts otherwise, as referenced in the Murray article, above, Cochran
&gt; and Hardy.
&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_intelligence

&gt; &quot;Cochran et al.
&gt; The 2005 study Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence[2] by Gregory
&gt; Cochran, Jason Hardy, and Henry Harpending at the University of Utah
&gt; noted that European Jews were forbidden to work in many of the common
&gt; jobs of the middle-ages from C.E. 800 to 1700, such as agriculture,
&gt; and subsequently worked in high proportion in meritocratic jobs
&gt; requiring higher intelligence, such as finance and trade, some of
&gt; which were forbidden to non-Jews by the church. Those who performed
&gt; better are known to have raised more children to adulthood, according
&gt; to Cochran et al., passing on their genes in greater proportion than
&gt; those who performed less successfully.[3]

&gt; Cochran et al. hypothesized that the eugenic pressure was strong
&gt; enough that mutations creating higher intelligence when inherited from
&gt; one parent but creating disease when inherited from both parents would
&gt; still be selected for, which could explain the unusual pattern of
&gt; genetic diseases found in the Ashkenazi population, such as Tay-Sachs,
&gt; Gaucher's disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Mucolipidosis type IV, and
&gt; other lipid storage disorders and sphingolipid diseases.[4] Some of
&gt; these diseases (especially torsion dystonia) have been shown to
&gt; correlate with high intelligence, and others are known to cause
&gt; neurons to grow an increased number of connections to neighboring
&gt; neurons.[5]

&gt; Reviews of the controversial paper have been both positive and
&gt; negative, with critics claiming the argument to be far-fetched and
&gt; unsupported by direct evidence.[4] Many genetically-isolated human
&gt; groups have faced multifarious adaptive pressures one could cherry
&gt; pick to justify presently exhibited group traits.[6]&quot;

&gt; Now, the wikipedia entry does give both sides of the &quot;academic&quot;
&gt; dispute (and I can read it well enough, myself) but  I would like to
&gt; ask your opinion, Peter..... What is it that makes you &quot;doubt&quot; the
&gt; truth or the factual validity of these so-called &quot;Psychometric
&gt; Findings&quot;?
