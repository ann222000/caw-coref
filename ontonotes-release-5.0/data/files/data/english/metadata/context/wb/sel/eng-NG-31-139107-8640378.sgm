Blood pressure on rise in kids in U.S.
Growing obesity problem among young blamed for other health ills
Reuters
Updated: 6:58 p.m. MT Sept 10, 2007

DALLAS - Blood pressure levels among American children are on the rise, an
alarming trend linked to climbing obesity rates that reverses decades of
decline, researchers reported on Monday.

The study, published this week in the American Heart Association journal
Circulation, adds to a growing body of evidence linking swelling juvenile
waistlines with rising blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems.

The researchers looked at data from seven U.S. government surveys conducted
from 1963 to 2002 on youngsters aged 8 to 17.

They looked at trends in blood pressure and &quot;pre-high&quot; blood pressure
adjusted for age as well as variations among ethnic and racial groups and
the impact of increasing obesity on these trends.

They found that each 0.4 inch increase in waist circumference raised the
likelihood of high blood pressure by 10 percent and the likelihood of
pre-high blood pressure by 5 percent.

Pre-high blood pressure was defined as either the systolic or diastolic
blood pressure falling between the 90th percentile and the 95th percentile.
High blood pressure was for readings above that.

&quot;The prevalence of high blood pressure and pre-high blood pressure in
children and adolescents showed a downward trend between 1963 and the
1988-94 survey. But the trend began to reverse through 2002,&quot; the Heart
Association said in a statement.

Just over 11 percent of children and teens had high blood pressure in 1980,
the Heart Association said. That fell to 2.7 percent in the 1988-94 survey,
but rose to 3.7 percent in the latest survey done in 1999-2002.

The trend was most pronounced among Mexican-American males, who were
included in the surveys for the first time from 1982. The survey found that
5.3 percent of these young men had high blood pressure in 1999-2002, the
Heart Association said.

&quot;Unless this upward trend in high blood pressure is reversed, we could be
facing an explosion of new cardiovascular disease cases in young adults and
adults. To reverse the upward trend at the beginning is good, and that's
why we need to act now,&quot; said Dr. Rebecca Din-Dzietham, associate professor
of community health and preventive medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine
in Atlanta, Georgia.

OK, I'm game. I would like to hear your side of this story. Your contention
is that being way &quot;overweight&quot; is OK, natural, etc. I took a look at the
SFFA newsgroup. So much crap there I can't even weed through it. Is there a
FAQ somewhere? Any links to valid studies and so forth that back your point?
Whatcha got?

I'm not falling prey to the corporations, Jeff.  I was just generalising and
sort of attacking the advertising industry,  You can't deny that even
so-called healthy foods are being pumped up with things we know are
dangerous.  I read all food labels, and it's come to the point that I've
adopted a Asian-style diet.  Stir-fry veggies, free-range meats, and brown
rice is about safe as one can get, and my family loves them, too.  I do my
reps in the mornings, even if I don't visit a gym.   I'm sure not everyone
here is trying to fit into the mold that the corporations are trying to put
us in, but far too many people are already there, and they don't even know
it.  Many of them don't even read newsgroups, let alone this one.

This is happening because of all the highly processed foods.  Processed
foods in boxes and cans are loaded with salt, sugar and empty calories.  The
sugar and execessive carbs send insulin levels through the roof and bodies
begin to store fat.  Add salt to the mess and the body begins to retain
water and bloat...especially if one doesn't exercise.  Blood pressure begins
to rise.  The process is incremental and blood pressure rises more and more
over the years if such self abuse continues.  Look at the garbage they serve
our children in school.  Look at the ridiculously sized portions we are
served in restaurants.  Look at the king-sized candy bars and the large
boxes and bags of candy in the stores.  Ridiculous.  No wonder Type 2
diabetes is on the rise.  On top of all this, kids don't go out and play
like they did many years ago.  They stay in the house and watch tv, play
video games, play on the computer and lay around.  They don't get much
physical activity - a bare minimum.  &quot;Go out and play!  Run, skip, play
ball!&quot;  People also eat out more now.  And if both parents work, junior is
most likely going to eat processed convenience foods which are the culprit.
Time to put the frozen, salt-laden meal into the microwave and collapse in
the easy chair!  Dinner will be ready in 4 minutes.  And it's all too easy
to just tell the kids to get in the car cause wer're going to McDonalds.
&quot;Yay!&quot;  I'm sure this is not the case with all families.  However, many
families eat this way all the time.  I ate this way out of ignorance for
many years after I got out of the military.  When I got out of the Air Force
in 1988, I weighed about 175.  I began to eat garbage regularly, as much as
I wanted, and my weight ballooned up to 252 lbs. in the following years.  My
blood pressure is now high and my blood sugar is high-normal.  I will become
a Type 2 diabetic if I don't change my ways.  That's whay my doctor told me.
It's my own fault.  Don't feel sorry for me.  Time to do something about it.
Time to accept personal responsibility.  No one forces us to buy that
processed garbage for ourselves and our families.  No one forced a fork or
spoon in my mouth.  I did it with my own free will.  Now I'm paying the
price.  That's why I'm on a diet.  Well, I've got to get off here.  I rode
my bike 14.5 miles yesterday.  I'm going to go on a 15 mile ride right now.
Biking is awesome exercise!

Not it isn't. It is happening in part because people choose to eat too
much processed foods or feed the foods their family. There are other
reasons, like not enough exercise.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Blood pressure on rise in kids in U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Growing obesity problem among young blamed for other health ills
&gt;&gt;&gt; Reuters
&gt;&gt;&gt; Updated: 6:58 p.m. MT Sept 10, 2007

&gt;&gt;&gt; DALLAS - Blood pressure levels among American children are on the rise,
&gt;&gt;&gt; an
&gt;&gt;&gt; alarming trend linked to climbing obesity rates that reverses decades of
&gt;&gt;&gt; decline, researchers reported on Monday.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The study, published this week in the American Heart Association journal
&gt;&gt;&gt; Circulation, adds to a growing body of evidence linking swelling
&gt;&gt;&gt; juvenile
&gt;&gt;&gt; waistlines with rising blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The researchers looked at data from seven U.S. government surveys
&gt;&gt;&gt; conducted
&gt;&gt;&gt; from 1963 to 2002 on youngsters aged 8 to 17.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They looked at trends in blood pressure and &quot;pre-high&quot; blood pressure
&gt;&gt;&gt; adjusted for age as well as variations among ethnic and racial groups
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the impact of increasing obesity on these trends.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They found that each 0.4 inch increase in waist circumference raised the
&gt;&gt;&gt; likelihood of high blood pressure by 10 percent and the likelihood of
&gt;&gt;&gt; pre-high blood pressure by 5 percent.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Pre-high blood pressure was defined as either the systolic or diastolic
&gt;&gt;&gt; blood pressure falling between the 90th percentile and the 95th
&gt;&gt;&gt; percentile.
&gt;&gt;&gt; High blood pressure was for readings above that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The prevalence of high blood pressure and pre-high blood pressure in
&gt;&gt;&gt; children and adolescents showed a downward trend between 1963 and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1988-94 survey. But the trend began to reverse through 2002,&quot; the Heart
&gt;&gt;&gt; Association said in a statement.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just over 11 percent of children and teens had high blood pressure in
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1980,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Heart Association said. That fell to 2.7 percent in the 1988-94
&gt;&gt;&gt; survey,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but rose to 3.7 percent in the latest survey done in 1999-2002.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The trend was most pronounced among Mexican-American males, who were
&gt;&gt;&gt; included in the surveys for the first time from 1982. The survey found
&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5.3 percent of these young men had high blood pressure in 1999-2002, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Heart Association said.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Unless this upward trend in high blood pressure is reversed, we could
&gt;&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt; facing an explosion of new cardiovascular disease cases in young adults
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; adults. To reverse the upward trend at the beginning is good, and that's
&gt;&gt;&gt; why we need to act now,&quot; said Dr. Rebecca Din-Dzietham, associate
&gt;&gt;&gt; professor
&gt;&gt;&gt; of community health and preventive medicine at Morehouse School of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Medicine
&gt;&gt;&gt; in Atlanta, Georgia.

&gt;&gt; This is happening because of all the highly processed foods.

&gt; Not it isn't. It is happening in part because people choose to eat too
&gt; much processed foods or feed the foods their family. There are other
&gt; reasons, like not enough exercise.

&gt;&gt; Processed foods in boxes and cans are loaded with salt, sugar and empty
&gt;&gt; calories.

&gt; So are processed foods outside of cans. And cakes and cookies backed in
&gt; our own oven.

&gt;&gt; The sugar and execessive carbs send insulin levels through the roof and
&gt;&gt; bodies begin to store fat.  Add salt to the mess and the body begins to

Can you recommend a good bike to take on sandy country roads?  I live in
Florida, about a mile from a State Park.  Some of the trip is on a clay and
sand road, but sometimes mountain bikes don't hold much traction in sand.
You need it when trying to get away from the dogs these people let run loose
around here.  (I'm a cat person.  Cats wait till the car or bike stops to
catch it.)  Anyway, any suggestions?  I don't want to go over $300, because
I'm trying to bugdet for a purchase of a new washing machine, too.

I would have recommended a mountain bike!  So I really don't know what to
recommend.  You may want to talk to other cyclists in your area or call or
visit your local bicycle shop.  I ride a 21-speed Trek 7200.  It's a
road/off-road bike.  I think the 21 gears would definitely help you keep the
bike moving through the soft stuff.

Look on the newsgroups for a bike group. I nearly positive there is one.
They should be able to give you good advice.

Of course, ask you bike dealer, too. I don't think you're going to do
better than a mountain. You might benefit from a new set of tires or
just the rear one.

I had a cheapo- shimano, and that thing rusted over the rainy summers and
winters here.  My son's Mongoose faired much better, but it needs a new
tire.  I really don't want a bike from Wal-Mart again.  The park is only
about a mile or so up the hill from me, but they have a deep spring perfect
for swimming, so long as the little pirahnas that look like tiny carps don't
bite you.  You should see what those things do to a cheeto!  Scary!
So the on/off road bike is what I need.

I don't think the issue is the type of bike you need, but the type of tires.

You can get a different type of tires for your bike. Any way, ask on the
bike group. They do that all the time.

My bike is 12 years old and has original tires (but the rear one needs
replacing soon).

Tires can make a big difference, but before you get that far, consider a
hybrid bike. No, it's not a hybrid like the car. A hybrid has the tires and
rim you would normally find on a mountain bike, but the frame is more like a
road bike. It does not have the suspension pieces that you find on a
mountain bike. It does tend to have a straight or upright handlebar, which
is what many people want. Those suspension pieces add weight and are
needless complications for the bike rider who isn't going up and down steep
hills or mountains. I am pretty sure you have neither of those in Florida.
There are also beach cruiser bikes, but those tend to be heavy.

Once you sort out the right kind of bike, then look at the tires. Sounds
like you need an aggressive tread to get through the sand, but the advice to
see a bike dealer is good advice. They can help with the bike and tire
choices.

Good luck and make sure you read up on how to ride a bike on the road. So
many people are completely clueless on what is expected of them when they
ride a bike in traffic. Visit www.bikeleague.org for lots of helpful advice
on that topic.
