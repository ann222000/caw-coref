Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? by Rusty Rockets
7 September 2007

Our hairy primate relatives have highly developed intelligence and
social skills, as evidenced by their tool usage and hierarchical
social order. But what about social intelligence? Could an opposable-
thumb challenged chimp pass muster at a human social gathering?

So far, nobody seems to have noticed the chimp (let's call him Lance)
that you've brought along - in the name of science - to the family get-
together. The other guests think Lance is a particularly ugly child,
but how long can this charade last? While both a young child and a
chimp can deliver a lot of noise and wanton destruction, sooner or
later they will have to exhibit their socio-cognitive skills. How a
primate would fair in such a situation, compared to a human, has been
a central issue for researchers for years. So, could Lance pass
muster?

First of all, it should be explained that humans are believed to have
many social-cognitive skills that other closely related primates do
not, as predicted by the &quot;cultural intelligence hypothesis.&quot; This
hypothesis posits that during early development a species is equipped
with a species-specific set of social-cognitive skills (interacting
with beings and their intentional actions, perceptions, and
knowledge), which basically helps us to avoid becoming embarrassing
social pariahs among our own species.

The hypothesis also states that there should be a point in early
development - before a child's exposure to writing, symbolic
mathematics, and formal learning - at which a child's physical
cognition (interacting with inanimate objects) is comparable to our
nearest primate relative.

So researchers recently set about testing the cultural intelligence
hypothesis, which involved pitting over 100 chimps and 30 orangutans
(ranging in age from 3 to 21) against an equal number of toddlers in a
battle of cognitive wits. &quot;We compared three species to determine
which abilities and skills are distinctly human,&quot; explains Esther
Herrmann of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in
Leipzig, Germany. The researchers claim that such a cognitive
comparison has never before been undertaken. The comparison involves
subjecting the three groups to the Primate Cognition Test Battery
(PCTB), which is designed to identify the division between social and
physical cognition.

After listening to Herrmann's team you'd expect the non-human primates
to perform quite well against the toddlers, as they need both highly
developed intelligence and social cognitive ability to survive in
their natural habitat. &quot;To locate food, primates need cognitive skills
for dealing with 'space,' to choose wisely among multiple food
sources, they need social skills for dealing with &quot;quantities&quot;; and
for extracting food from difficult places,&quot; the team writes in a
subsequent study paper, published in Science.

Such cognitive traits have been observed in another study, published
in the journal Animal Cognition, where non-human primates seek out
distant, but bountiful food sources, despite the closer proximity of
less generous ones.

As far as social cognition goes, this ability evolved as a result of
an array of competing cooperative and competitive behaviors. &quot;To
manipulate the behavior of others, primates need skills of
'communication', to learn things vicariously from observing others,
they need skills of 'social learning'; and to predict the behavior of
others in competition, they need cognitive skills for understanding
psychological states such as goals and perceptions.&quot;

Additionally, the Animal Cognition study reveals a certain degree of
social cognitive sophistication. The researchers found that food
source decisions could &quot;be based on value judgments of resource sites
that take into consideration social as well as dietary needs and
preferences,&quot; says Elena Cunningham, from the State University of New
York. &quot;The monkeys' foraging decisions may help to keep the group
together.&quot; In their totality, these non-human primate physical and
social cognitive skills seem very close, if not identical, to human
abilities. But let's take a look at one of the PCTB tests and see what
resulted.

One of the social learning tasks involved a researcher demonstrating
how to flip open a plastic canister in order to access some food or a
toy housed inside. The task was designed to show whether a subject was
capable of learning and then performing a series of goal-oriented
actions. With their highly developed social cognitive abilities
kicking into action, the toddlers watched and successfully copied the
researcher. &quot;Social cognition skills are critical for learning,&quot; says
Herrmann. But the chimps and orangutans, on the other hand, ignored
the researcher's method and instead tried to retrieve their reward by
breaking the canister, or pulling at it with their teeth. &quot;The
children were much better than the apes in understanding nonverbal
communications; imitating another's solution to a problem and
understanding the intentions of others,&quot; says Herrmann.

On the issue of physical cognition, however, there was little
difference between the toddlers and the non-human primates, which goes
a long way in supporting the hypothesis that humans have developed
some special aptitude for social cognition; the cultural intelligence
hypothesis. But just because our primate relatives didn't do so well
on comparative social cognitive tests doesn't mean that they are
socially inept. In fact, another article published in the same edition
of Science points to how non-human primates seek out rationality, and
can predict the intentions and behaviors of others (including
humans).

In that study, led by Justin Wood from the Department of Psychology in
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard, primates were presented
with two possible food containers. A researcher would then either
deliberately grasp a container, or &quot;accidentally&quot; come into contact
with it. Of the three species of primate being tested (old and new
world monkeys, and apes), all of them showed preference for the
container that had been decisively grabbed. Wood deduced that the
primates distinguished between the goal-oriented action of the
experimenter, and an accidental action. A second experiment was also
conducted, using the same two food containers, where an experimenter,
with both his hands full, would touch one of the containers with his
elbow. Then with his hands empty, the same experimenter would again
touch a container with his elbow. The primates showed that they could
see the rationality behind touching a container with an elbow while a
person's hands were full, but could not when they were empty.

&quot;A dominant view has been that non-human primates attend only to what
actions 'look like' when trying to understand what others are
thinking,&quot; says Wood. &quot;In contrast, our research shows that non-human
primates infer others' intentions in a much more sophisticated way.
They expect other individuals to perform the most rational action that
they can, given the environmental obstacles that they face.&quot;

Respectively, the two major studies show, fairly conclusively, that
humans really are the social sophisticates of the primate world, and
that our ability to infer others' intentions dates back millions of
years. But what does this mean as far as trying to pass off Lance at a
social gathering? Well, he probably wouldn't win any social etiquette
awards. But then, I think we all have relatives like that.

Alpha males are impulsively aggressive. The betas and females need to
pick up on this in order to brace themselves for the blow, or move out
of range before the alpha strikes out. We see this in the primate
field studies.

Read up on the primate field studies. Or get a copy of &quot;Demonic Males&quot;
by Wrangham &amp; Peterson, who compare the various studies which find
this kind of impulsive aggression in the alpha males of several
species besides your own. The problem you have now, is that your
dismissive attitude and snide remarks no longer intimidate. I can
still post in a rational civil manner.

I have.  Apparently, however, I did so with much different goals in
mind.  When I read it I did so to get a better understanding of the
starting point (the assumption being that chimps are relatively
similar to the LCA) at which hominid evolution began.  You yourself,
on the otherhand, seemed to think that these observations were in and
of themselves indicative of how humans evolved from the LCA, which
seems plainly nonsensical to me.

Your comment was inane.  It's as if somebody asked you why Jack and
Jill went up the hill and you responded that Jack walks faster than
Jill.

Suggestion: reread that post that initiated this thread and you'll see
that the author is saying something that contradicts some of the more
popular notions of how humans/hominids evolved from chimps.
