&gt; _The problem:_

&gt; VTMB is CTDing constantly. I'm pretty sure it's my Nforce2 on-board sound,
&gt; because it's mentioned in the readme, and it CTD's at weird places, like
&gt; dialogues and walking into any club (dancing) area. If there's music playing,
&gt; it'll crash just before you would hear the door close, for instance. Sounds
&gt; like a mixer problem. I've already turned off the environment and hardware
&gt; modes in VTMB, and it crashes a *lot* less, but it still crashes. I don't want
&gt; to go to the trouble of lowering the acceleration slider everytime I play, so
&gt; I'm looking for a new card.

&gt; The reason I'm even using AC97 is that I had my SBLive! Platinum die on me a
&gt; few months ago, and went to the on-board AC97 sound. It's been a poor stop gap.
&gt; Win98SE drivers do not work. Several hardware accelerated modes come up as
&gt; damaged in DXDiag. It's probably been broken all the time and I didn't notice
&gt; because I used my Platinum. I tried to replace it with a Value version of the
&gt; card, but due to the way it enumerates in PCI, it doesn't work with 98 and it
&gt; causes finicky behavior and crashing in XP. It's not up to the same standard,
&gt; even though the cards basically look the same. I don't understand why, but the
&gt; current SBLive! 5.1 cards are not as good as the original Platinum.

&gt; _I'm looking for a card that allows me to:_

&gt; 1. Bank SF2 (soundfont) files,
&gt; 2. Rock solid drivers in *both* XP and 98SE, as it would be nice to boot into
&gt; 98 again for legacy gaming.
&gt; 3. Has a PC game port, because I have some legacy input hardware that I'd like
&gt; to use. (The gameport isn't as important, because I can just get a USB--&gt;PC
&gt; gameport converter.)

&gt; Any recommendations? Is an Audigy 1 a good bet?

&gt; Thanks.

FWIW Zag, VTMB never even hiccuped as far as sound goes with my AC97 on
board sound, but it's an ASUS K8V-SE Deluxe mobo, not an nForce chipset
of any kind, so perhaps Intel are the culprits...? I've been using it
for 2.5yrs now, predominately with headphones, but compared to my
previous rig the sound is fantastic (even has decent 5.1 with my
Logitech speakers though I haven't plugged in the rear speakers since
the move). I don't need to ask you if all your mobo &amp; sounds card
drivers are up to date, do I? ;-p Also, mine is running on WinXP Pro SP2
&amp; has since I installed VTMB - frankly, I'm surprised you're still
bothering with Win98 - is this mainly what you're running VTMB on? If
so, try it on XP &amp; tick Win98 compatibility mode to get around some
other early engine bugs (not sure if it still applies to v1.2). Luck!

I'm using on-board for VTMB as well without much crashing. Did you listen
to some sounds with the WMP per chance? This could cause these crashes...

I think an Audigy 1 or a SoundBlaster Live! may be your only options,
that is if you can still find them.  WDM drivers aren't reliable under
Windows 98SE, so you'll need a card with VxD drivers.

I used to have HUGE problems with my nforce2 sound drivers. In the end I got
them sorted and everything went from crap to very sweet indeed (Abit mobo).
It boiled down in the end to very thoroughly removing all (unified) drivers and
installig one set of separate sound drivers that I finally located on NVidia's
site some place.
I just put in a Gigabyte mobo with Nvidia 650sli chipset and the sound is very
good indeed.

I found the problem. I'm using the Nvidia sound drivers you're talking about,
but there's a bug regarding a feature called &quot;CineSurround&quot; and &quot;NvMixer.&quot; It
won't turn off properly after you turn it on. I think I used it for a DVD once,
and then it got stuck on. I forgot about it.

It hadn't caused a problem with my other games, so I hadn't noticed it was
stuck on. Effectively, I think it's a 5.1 surround virtualizer, and that was
apparently crashing VTMB.

Luckily, it's easy enough to turn off with a workaround: you have to rerun the
&quot;Speaker Wizard&quot; in &quot;NvMixer.&quot; Setting the speakers back to plain &quot;2 speakers&quot;
in the dropdown does nothing, and the &quot;2 speakers (CineSurround)&quot; setting will
persist. However, full redetection sets your speakers back to regular stereo
instead of &quot;CineSurround.&quot;

Also, if you turn on *headphones* &quot;CineSurround,&quot; you'll lose the ability to
return to regular &quot;2 speaker&quot; sound. Once it's on, it's on, and you have to
rerun the wizard to get normal sound back.

But I haven't had any crashes since. :^)

Werner, you might want to stick this in a readme for the next patch, if you are
so inclined.

My symptoms were CTD's every 5-10 minutes, usually before some ambient sound
kicks in (like a door closing behind your character), and more frequently in
any place with club music playing, using Nforce on-board sound with Nvidia's
full sound drivers.

And, like a bullet, you never hear the sound that kills your game. ;^)
