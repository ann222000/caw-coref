Americans say sincerity is a virtue. (Some even say sincerity is a
Christian virue.) Americans want other Americans to be sincere, and
they want other nationalities to be sincere.

But how about Hitler or Stalin ? They also were sincere in what they
were doing... destroying millions of people. Is sincereity a virtue
after all ?

Do you know, or not know, if other religions have something to say about

It is a fairly common hypocrasy to want OTHERS to be nice at the same time
ONE feels he/she doesn't have to be obligated to be nice.

But were they doing something nice (or good [and for whom?])?

That was exactly my point. Sincerity alone is not a virtue. The
American society made it virtue, because it is easy to exploit the
sincere person who is also a plain naive person. It is easier for the
government to herd such individuals. It is easy to make them to do
what the government (or other authority) wants them to do. I would say
it was a cornerstone of the economical development of America. Until
the recent time.

But it is also easy to coerce the &quot;sincere&quot; person in doing evil
things. The person also have to have his own critical thinking. If the
person did something bad, then the person should be able to assess it
critically, repent, and vow to never do it again. But sincere
person... he just consumes whatever the cultural idea is hand down to
him by the authorities without critical thinking about it. In fact,
critical thinking about the orders given to you is considered an
anathema for a sincere person.

Hm... I guess I just came close to reasoning that the US state is an
evil formation  :-)   :-(

Point taken and acknowledged.

But, this is all good philosophy. However, I would not give that much
credit to the USA since we are, arrogantly, still in a high point of our
cycle of &quot;empire.&quot; There were many empires over the past 4,000+ years; all
of them looked in the mirror and praised themselves. None has lasted more
than some 200-300 years (with caveats and individual interpretations of
historians), plus or minus. And, if you go by the polls (which come from
non-experts), even in the USA the opinion is that we are in decline. Now.

I have read much history in the last 7 or so years. I can tell you that
the recurrent thought is that history repeats itself (big surprise?). For
example, Iraq is a big repeat of the mistake of Viet Nam. Which was a big
repeat mistake of Korea. We have too many idiots with small brains get
into high places with power. And, we have  too many people in low places
who sit around and do nothing. We don't even have war protests any more
like during the Viet Nam era; too many keyboard potatoes living in Second
Life and blathering on blogs.

Big bad news for you: All of the empires were, also, in &quot;evil formations.&quot;
It did not matter if there was a nice king or a nice emperor in your land.
There were always other lands nearby where there was an evil emperor or
king who got the idea to bump off _your_ king or emperor and take all your
gold and make a slave out of you (at best) or just kill you (at worst),
and if you had a wife, then she either became a slave (if she was not
pretty) or became the wife (if she was pretty) of the soldier who killed
you.

So, besides watching my birds and squirrels (for peace, tranquility, and
other entertainment) I have also noticed that butterflies are nice to
watch. Maybe in the future I will get an aquarium and watch the fish swim
around, peacefully and effortlessly, in a low stress environment where I
as benefactor, will provide food for them in return for their &quot;favors.&quot;

For all else, there is SRC, and all of you regulars, who, together with
me, are trying to figure out why and how the world works.

Oh, yes, don't forget.....CYA.
