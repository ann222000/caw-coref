Theater
Royal Shakespeare's Happy Coupling

By Peter Marks
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, December 19, 2003; Page C01

John Fletcher (1579-1625) is looking down from some celestial
balcony and, like those of us in the higher-priced seats, he's
grinning. How could he not be pleased? His neglected comedy &quot;The
Tamer Tamed&quot; has been revived by the Royal Shakespeare Company,
which is lavishing on the play the kind of loving attention
usually accorded, well, Shakespeare.

Gregory Doran's spot-on production gives Fletcher's sendup of the
chasm between the sexes the respect it deserves. In other words,
it's a rip-roaring zoo, down to the spectacle of the leading man
drunkenly (and very, uh, realistically) relieving himself on a
door. Later, in an episode that can only be described as
phlegmatic, the actor indulges in an operatic coughing jag that
tests the stain resistance of spectators' suits and dresses in
the first three rows of the Eisenhower Theater.

That these moments are genuinely funny is a tribute to the acumen
of both Doran and Jasper Britton, the actor who is freely
expressing his inner John Belushi onstage at the Kennedy Center.
Britton is Petruchio in &quot;The Tamer Tamed,&quot; Fletcher's reply to
Shakespeare's earlier &quot;The Taming of the Shrew.&quot; And if
Fletcher's work does not display the intuitive depth and exalted
command of language that is evident in Shakespeare's, it is, as
Britton demonstrates over and over, good enough for a laugh.

The RSC has brought both plays to Washington, the first such
pairing by a major company, apparently, in centuries. Apart from
sterling contributions by the plays' stars, Britton and Alexandra
Gilbreath (she plays the wife to Britton's Petruchio in both),
what seems most memorable about this twinning are the ways in
which the productions speak to each other. It's fascinating, for
instance, to see how Fletcher inverts the plot of &quot;Shrew&quot; --
indeed, how he completely inverts the traditional social roles of
men and women -- and still manages to draw on the same
humanitarian themes as Shakespeare.

Doran's attempt here is to place &quot;The Tamer Tamed,&quot; composed 20
years after Shakespeare's play, on equal footing. Fletcher wasn't
doctrinaire about the parallels; he changed the setting from
Padua to London and didn't bother to retain the names of many of
the secondary characters. The director here has eliminated the
geographical dissonance -- both productions share a minimalist
set, a sooty Medieval Anycity -- and changed characters' names in
&quot;The Tamer Tamed&quot; to match those in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew.&quot; As
a matter of fact, Stephen Brimson Lewis's flexible, utilitarian
scenery seems a better fit in this production; there's a lot less
busy moving around of door frames.

The story reunites us with Petruchio some time after the death of
Kate. He's just married Maria (the play begins briskly, with
their nuptials) and he is about to enjoy his wedding night when
she, in league with her sister Livia (Naomi Frederick) and Kate's
sister Bianca (Eve Myles), sets off on a course of rebellion and
humiliation, denying him sex. Barricading herself with the others
in Petruchio's house, Maria warns him that though he's renowned
as &quot;a wife-breaker,&quot;&quot;a woman now shall take those honors off,
and tame you.&quot;

While the battle royal between Kate and Petruchio in &quot;The Taming
of the Shrew&quot; was an opportunity for Shakespeare to enlarge upon
a variety of issues in male-female relations -- from the role of
money in the arranging of marriages to the question of mature
love versus mere appetite -- Fletcher is essentially interested
only in farcical complications. Doran capitalizes on the broadly
comic possibilities in Fletcher's more mechanical play, showing
us again and again the amusing consequences of a topsy-turvy
world in which women are the sexual aggressors.

The notion is put to a vivid test in the plot involving Livia's
on-and-off romance with the mealy-mouthed Rowland (Daniel
Brocklebank). It is without doubt the more assertive Livia who
calls the shots; she enforces a masculine dominance over the
daintily feminine Rowland. Underlining the role reversal, it's
Rowland's leg that kicks back in a spasm of bliss whenever Livia
plants a kiss on his lips.

Yet the evening's most entertaining instance of triumphal
feminism comes not in an intimate moment but in a crowd scene. As
word of Maria's revolt spreads through the countryside, aggrieved
women take to the streets. The instruments of their rebellion are
not daggers and swords; they're pots and pans, which they beat to
the lilting rhythms of Paul Englishby's terrific compositions.
(The seven-piece band, under the direction of Michael Tubbs, adds
immeasurably to the period atmosphere.) An infectious dance fever
spreads over the women, as if they were members of a Jacobean
road company of &quot;Stomp!&quot;

Gilbreath and Britton have very different challenges in &quot;The
Tamer Tamed.&quot; While she must create a character wholly separate
from her needy wildcat of a Kate, he must find a way to
synthesize the conceptions of Petruchio by two playwrights.
Gilbreath's cocksure Maria, in fact, seems as if she might have
been modeled on aspects of Britton's Petruchio in &quot;The Taming of
the Shrew.&quot; It's a commanding performance, further evidence that
she's a classical actress of the first rank and a great partner
for Britton.

You find yourself wondering what feelings the Petruchio of &quot;The
Tamer Tamed&quot; has carried over from the &quot;The Taming of the Shrew.&quot;
As in the earlier play, the first glimpse of Britton here is in a
state of inebriation: Is he drunk because he's trying to
obliterate the memory of Kate? Such notions percolate when a
sublime actor inhabits a character so vibrantly that you have to
remind yourself that the character does not really have a life of
his own.

The ensemble is uniformly satisfying, too good to try to single
anyone out. As &quot;Shrew&quot; demonstrates and &quot;Tamer&quot; reaffirms, the
RSC at its best is still a potent, imaginative dramatic force, a
company with a dynamic future as well as a past.
