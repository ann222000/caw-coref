Hi Jay,

Congratulations on two weeks smoke free!!!!

You are no longer breathing in all those chemicals that you did while
you were smoking, and I will also bet that you might be currently
breathing a bit on the shallow end?

When you start to feel really foggy try these breathing exercises:
http://deepsloweasy.com/html/intro.htm

I would also suggest getting rid of anything white and refined from your
diet such as:
white sugar
white flour
white rice
and get more whole grains, veggies, and protein going.

Also believe it or not- try cutting a regular drinking straw to the size
of a cigarette and stuff it with cotton.  Anytime you feel a bit of
brain fog just use the straw to calm your breathing, anxiety, and you
might find yourself breathing better.

Two weeks is wonderful - keep up the great work, drink plenty of h20,
and get plenty of rest too.

hugs,
robbster

My brain fog was defeated by upping my multi-vitamins and gingko
biloba, found with every step down I took on the patch... more to rant
on that... the fog increased a little then faded after a couple of
weeks.

I'm still here,

Jay!  The brain fog is often a part of the quit and you basically just
have to ride it out.  It does lift a bit each day as you are right in
the midst of it right now.  Certainly you can look into some of the
supplements mentioned but it's mostly just time.  Your body is
adjusting to being rid of this poison and that is why you feel you are
in a fog.  Do allow yourself to take as many naps as you can as it
both makes the fog better as well as makes the healing go faster.  You
are doing great and just keep on keeping on and you will make it!

I have really gotta start giving more attention to some of Robbb's
suggestions.
I wander how much my breathing and my diet are contributing to my lack
of energy.
My Mom (just over 9 weeks now!!!!!) is headed to some sort of
breathing classes next week.
I wish I could go with her.
I find myself getting nervous everytime my lungs work hard.
I should prolly start really testing them.

I have a bit of brain fog, too, but mine is related to my ADHD.  I used
nicotine and caffeine for more than 25 years to medicate myself.  Now
that I'm not using nicotine any more, I'm having to learn to deal with
the disorder the RIGHT way.....  It takes some work. But it's worth it!

Not Cindy, but I was officially diagnosed with ADD after I quit, and the
neurologist said I absolutely was self-medicating with nicotine and caffeine
all my life.  Now I'm doing it the right way - prescription speed... ;)

I'm not taking prescription meds (yet), but that is my next step. But
I've found that eating right, getting a good night's sleep, and some
regular exercise go a long way towards keeping me clear and level
headed.  The more tired I am, the more likely I am to drift mentally.
And I really think that applies to just about everyone.

Right now I'm concentrating on rebuilding my schedules, getting
organized and developing routines.  That was actually one of my coping
mechanisms BEFORE I quit, but in quitting, I had to disrupt all that.  I
had to change all my schedules and habits because they were all
associated with smoking!  Messing with the routines of an ADHDer can be
disastrous! LOL

So now I'm having to rebuild all that.  I make a lot of lists and
written schedules.  It worked for both my kids (also ADHD)and it works
very well for me.  Even if I don't write them down, I keep mental lists
of my ordinary daily routines:  Get up, check my email, take my son to
school, come home, eat breakfast, take my walk, etc....)  I try to stick
to my schedule as much as possible.  It really does help because I
always know WHAT I should be doing.

I try to keep my house completely clutter free (a place for everything,
and everything in its place).  Especially my desk.  When I'm done with
things, I immediately put them back in their respective drawer, shelf,
stack, whatever.  And again I use lists:  pay bills, send email to
teacher, go to bank, buy printer cartridges....

The lists and the routines apply to EVERYTHING I do.  Yard work,
bathing, bedtime, bill paying, laundry, housework.  I develop a ritual
that works for me, and I do it that way EVERY SINGLE TIME. For instance,
cleaning house:  I always start with laundry, bathrooms, bedrooms,
livingroom, dens, then the kitchen last.  And within routines I have
other routines:  dust the bathroom, empty trash, sweep, bathtub, toilet,
sink, mirrors, mop, replace towels.

It's something like living on the edge of obsessive compulsive disorder,
without the neurosis.

When I find myself unable to concentrate or work on what I need to be
doing (which usually involves working at my computer), I get up and do
something else for 5 minutes:  read a magazine, work on one of my
long-term projects, reorganize something, play a brain game like trivia
or crosswords, etc.  The break replaces the break I used to take in
order to smoke, plus I'm still being productive.  And even when I watch
TV, I am multi-tasking.  Right now I'm working on crocheting baby
booties for 3 different new parents we know....

Is it perfect?  No, but it's getting me by and it's NOT KILLING ME,
which is what the cigarettes were doing.  In a perfect world, I wouldn't
have ADHD and I would never have smoked.  Right now, I do the best I can
do.  I cope with it and try to find better ways to cope.  Next step:
real meds.  But that has to wait until after Christmas (what the heck
happened to all that money I'm supposed to be saving by not smoking?!).

Cindy....  I've been wanting to thank you for this.
Seems you've put in words things I've only been able to think about.
My kid was diagnosed with ADHD which woke the wife and I up to the
fact that we suffer from it some too.
Both of us are recovering alcoholics, ex-smokers and caffeine junkies.
In working with my kid, I realize he needs to use techniques that I've
developed for myself over the years.
Like you describe, the things I do to keep myself straight have been
labled by others (wife) as obsessive.
Now that I've quit smoking, I've been struggling more.
I'm getting a better glimpse of hard it is for my kid when he has no
control over his environment (routine and organization).
The wife and I are gonna have to provide him with the things you
describe below.
We are gonna have to provide ourselves with those things.

David, THANK YOU! for sharing.  It's good to know I'm not the only
person out there who feels like I do.  That's why AS3 has been such a
life saver for me. :)  There is also another great newsgroup that you
might be interested in for the ADHD related stuff:
alt.support.attn-deficit  I haven't subscribed to it for a long time,
but it was a big help to me in the early days of my kids' diagnosis.
Also, this is a real addy for me, so you're welcome to email me any time.

PS  Have you tried Welbutrin (Bupropion) for the kids?  We tried several
with my kids, including Ritalin, and switched to the Welbutrin while my
daughter was in jr. high.  She's 24 now, so she survived to adulthood,
which she would not have if we hadn't found the RIGHT med.  LOL
Seriously, though, do consider all the alternatives before giving up on
the meds altogether.  And remember that the meds aren't a magic pill.
You still have to do all the hard stuff.
