Got my dog a ramp to get into the back seat.  He has arthritis.  For a long
time now he has dithered at the jumping in point. He also has a tendency to
hit his knee on the door frame where the wheel well takes up part of the
doorway.

So, you'd think this ramp, which is 6 feet long, would be the answer. You'd
think the dog would be happy, but instead he seems to be afraid of it. He
tends to run along it in a panic when I finally get him to go up it like
he's afraid it's going to turn into an alligator if he stays on too long. (I
read somewhere that dogs are similar to autistics in the way their brains
work. Humans have an outer layer to their brains, the deeply creased stuff.
Dogs don't have that. They have smooth brains. It's this outer layer that
makes us quite distincitve from other mammals. Cows are easily spooked by
glinting metal or hanging chains. They have had an autistic person help
design slaughterhouse so that the cows don't balk at every strange new thing
in the corrals leading up to their doom.)

The ramp is a little tippy since it rests on an upholstered back seat. That
may be part of the problem. All the ramps I've seen have been designed for
SUVs.

If you're wondering what the point of this post is, there really is no
point. I'm just telling you about my ramp and my dog's phobias. He now has
at least two fears, fear of Petsmart (fear of linoleum) and fear of ramps.

Wouldn't that depend on whether the dog considered being lifted a kindness
or a torment?  I don't know nuthin'bout Greens' dog, but Sam hated being
picked up.  On the scale of punishments, picking him up (a gentle, two-
armed lift) was way beyond being squirted with water (he liked that!) and
right up there with momentary banishment.

YUP!  But since he hates the ramp, he needs to get there somehow!

When my first dog became arthritic (somewhere around 14 yo), I had to
carry him up the stairs for bed.  He REALLY wanted to be up with us, but
couldn't do the stairs.  He HATED being lifted.  The trade-off was that
he could be where he wanted to be.  So, he grudgingly stood at the
bottom of the stairs every night, and waited for me to lift him, all the
while with a look on his face like &quot;this is soooooooo humiliating&quot;.  oh
well.

=============
I had to do that for my Chow Chow when he was also old and arthritic.  I
got a board and nailed an old rubber bathmat onto it, and he always used
that to get in and out of the car.
I think maybe your problem might be, as you said, the ramp is sitting on the
cushion of your seat and so not sturdy.  We would let the dog lie on the
floor on a blanket because he was unable to get up to the seat.

I've tried lifting him. He doesn't like it, but also he's a hundred pounds
and I'd have to lift and lean a squirming mass. Leaning makes it harder on
the human back. I thought about building a lifting device which would have a
board and a couple of straps, but even then I'd have to lean and also workt
the thing around him.

He'll do the ramp. Right now his legs are a little better. When they get bad
I'm sure at least I'll appreciate the ramp. It's painful to watch him
struggle and then bash himself against the door frame. Maybe I should get an
autistic person to tell me what's so spooky about the ramp or the car.

You're such a sensitive person (not!).  Get a nice low station wagon and
you've got it made.  In  the future, never get a dog you can't lift.  I
lift 100#+ dogs on a regular basis (overweight rescue dogs) - front legs
first, then back, but whole body if necessary.

I do it on a very regular basis.  A lot of the dogs the rescue I work
with gets in are grossly overweight and over 100#.  I manage to lift
them into the back of my not-so-short SUV.  Surely Greens can manage a
back seat.

Have you ever tried to hoist a dog into a back seat?  It's much

When our murphy was having problems jumping up on to our bed as she aged,
I'd get her to put her front paws on the side of the bed, and simply lift up
her rear end to assist her.  She was too heavy for me to lift her up
completely, but with a bit of cooperation, we could manage any sort of
lifting assistance necessary.

I did murphy the same way as for the bed, front paws up onto the back seat
or the floor in the back seat of the car, then I'd lift her rear end up and

Yup.  I have hoisted many different dogs (and most that I don't even
know, and often in yucky condition) into cargo areas, crates, onto back
seats, you name it.  Uncooperative dogs, scared dogs, bonkers dogs.
Pretty much - name the condition and state of dog and I've done it.  How
about a seizing 140# IW onto the back seat of a Volvo?

Surely, you don't expect everyone to be in such extraordinary physical
condition as you.
Some of us are a little older and a little arthritic ourselves.  I would
think it foolish to try to lift a 100 lb dog in and out of the car and up
and down the stairs all the time.
Sometimes, one has to think about one's own health as well, or there won't
be anyone around to take care of the old dog.  I am surprised you would
assume it would be an act of unkindness to not do so.

Did you do anything to accustom the dog to the ramp, or did you
just put it into place and expect your dog to use it?

When we got a ramp for Dylan, our arthritic GSD, she didn't like
the idea of using it.  So we backed up a couple of steps and did
a couple of things to make it easier for her:

1. glued some carpet scraps to the surface, so that she wouldn't
slip on the plastic

2.  laid it out flat in the yard, to allow her to examine it.
Then put a biscuit on it.  Then enticed her onto it with a
biscuit.  (Repeat a few times, until she showed no hesitation)
Then propped it on a brick and enticed her onto it.  Then propped
it on a bench.  Then on a sturdy chair.  Then, and only then,
when she showed no hesitation about getting onto the ramp,
propped it onto the back of the minivan, at which point she
readily climbed into the back of the van.  Then enticed her with
a biscuit to walk down - she quickly got the idea.  You have to
have patience when dealing with fear.

Sorry - this is pretty amusing.  I'm an almost 49 year old with
arthritic knees and feet.  I have good upper body strength, but nothing

I don't think you need to be in extraordinary physical
condition.  You do need to understand a little physics (at
the intuitive level) - leverage, basically.  You really
don't need to be able to dead lift 100lbs to lift a 100lb
dog into the car.

But generally I'm with Janet and whoever else believes that
as a rule of thumb it's a good idea to only own dogs that
you can lift.  I think most of us have dealt with aging,
ailing dogs and being able to carry a badly compromised dog
up a flight of stairs can make a big difference in his
quality of life by allowing him to continue to participate
in family life.  And then there are emergencies ...

Never been in a Volvo.  Trying to get Elliott in and out of the back
of my Festiva was a nightmare I'd rather not repeat.  It was far
harder than simply lifting him up.  Who knows what Greens' problem is
(ha!), but I don't understand why you're giving him shit for buying
and using a ramp.

Well, yes.  But even a dog you can lift as dead weight (um,
literally) can be tricky to maneuver in and out of a car, depending
on the dog, the circumstances, and the car.

It takes a while for them to get used to it.  It's more likely he's just
afraid of it and even more so if it's unsteady when he walks on it.  We
built Buddy a ramp for the back porch about 3 months ago and he wasn't happy
with it and I had to leash him and walk him up and down it numerous time
before he was ok with it.

Now he uses it on his own later in the day when his arthritis is bothering
him.

I like large dogs, but since I choose not to live with other people,

This thread has me thinking.  Cubbe doesn't like being picked up, but
we're capable of lifting her when we need to.  She's only 50 pounds;
most of that is squirm.  She readily hops in her crate for car rides.
There's no other time she has to get up on something.

As the temperature drops, she climbs on the couch, but that's an easy
climb, and she likes sunny spots on the floor just as well.  I'm sure a
nice cushion on the floor would suit her as well as the couch if it came
to that.

She doesn't sleep on the bed; she sleeps under it.  That's both of our
preference.  To get under the bed (futon pull-out couch), she has to
scrunch down and turn around while scrunched.  I don't know how she does
it, but always has and has never minded.  If Cubbe got arthritic and
elderly, we wouldn't be building her ramps on to the bed; we'd be
inventing methods to get her under the bed, and I'm not sure how that
would work.  Curl her up and slide her under using a mechanism with wheels?

That's not what you objected to, though.  You implied that using a

Sheppe was so agreeable that she allowed herself to be lifted, but you
knew she didn't like it.  When we moved up here, we rented a truck.  The
plan was for her to ride in the cab beneath my feet while Jim drove.
The first time in, I lifted Sheppe into it.  After that, she had to
communicate that she could do it herself.  She pulled away from me ever
so slightly, very unusual for her.  Then she gave herself a little
running room, ran, and jumped in.  On her first time out, she faltered
and fell a little, bumping her head into the cement.  After that,
flawless.  The command was Sheppe, JUMP, and she'd head into whatever we
were indicating.

We weren't sure how it would go, but she was an angel in the cab.  We
stopped often so we could all stretch our legs.  I was surprised by how
dog friendly the rest stops along the highway were.  Dogs were expected
to be on leash, but they all had potty areas, and many had clever dog
watering stations with taps and plugs.  Then she'd hop back in to the
floor of the cab; I'd put my feet on the dash, and away we'd go.

I don't remember the specifics.  I know it was huge.  We had my car on a
trailer behind.  I was too scared to drive the truck.  We only drove in
the daytime.

I remember the oddest things from the trip.

At one stop in Georgia, I fed Sheppe a scoop of dog chow into her dish
on the grass.  The ants came up out of nowhere, started devouring the
chow before Sheppe could.  I had to throw away the chow and keep the
ants off me while doing so.  It's not like I screamed or anything, but a
man in the parking lot said something to the effect of my learning about
Georgia ants.  He didn't have to see what was going on to know what was
going on.

We did alright with hotels until we got to Connecticut.  Night fell as
we were in New York.  We didn't mean to drive at night, but it was
night, and there were no hotels.  We finally found one and asked if a
clean friendly dog was allowed.  The answer was no.  When Jim told me
that (I was waiting in the truck with Sheppe), I wasn't going to argue
it.  I figured I could sleep in the car with Sheppe.  (I really could.
I left my comforter unpacked.  As long as I'm warm, and it isn't loud or
lights flashing, I can sleep anywhere.)  But no, that wasn't necessary.
Jim bribed the desk clerk, and we all were allowed in the room.  Let's
call it an extra security deposit.

I remember the way the food changed from one side of DC to the other.
It's not like I require gourmet food, and it's not like we were going
far off the highway in search of it.  I don't prefer fried food, but I'm
healthy enough to eat it now and then when that's all that's available,
and that's all that was available from mid-Florida straight up 95 clear
to the other side of DC.  We stopped at one restaurant that boasted a
salad bar, and they had it:  a big bowl of ice berg lettuce, and you
could help yourself to shredded carrots in mayonnaise, beans in
mayonnaise, cabbage in mayonnaise, chopped vegetables in mayonnaise,
fruit salad in mayonnaise, corn off the cob in mayonnaise.  I swear
there were 10 little bowls all filled with mayonnaise.  I ate the
lettuce without dressing.  They had dressing, but it was all mayonnaise.
The vending machines at rest stops had potato chips, and the church
fundraisers were all selling doughnuts.  Then we got to Maryland, and,
hallelujah, I saw an apple.  I felt singing praises.  Oh joy!  An apple!

I haven't romanticized that move yet.  We're here; I like it.  We're
staying.
