2 weeks ago I racked 5 gallons and after 5 days a white skin appeared on the top.
I asked the local brew store and was told it was caused by a benign yeast. It wouldn't affect the taste, but was near impossible to get rid of.
I cleaned the carboy, racking cane and tube as well as I could BUT!!
The last batch I racked on saturday has just developed the same white scum on top.
Do I have to throw the carboy or does anyone know how I can stop the rot?

Any answers greatfull received

That depends on what the white skin is. I have 2 carboys behind me that
have a good 3/4" oof that in them. It's a krausen and highly valued. :)

Are you sure it's rot and not a krausen forming?

A carboy should be easy to clean completely. I'd suspect the racking
cane or tubing. Both are cheap, you might consider replacing them.

Your brewing area might also have become home to this wild yeast (if
it really is a yeast). Maybe it's getting into your wort while it's
cooling, before you pitch the yeast. How are you doing that part?

Sounds like it may be a Brett infection. Google that and you should find a
lot of articles (and pictures to compare it too also). Do white strings form
going down into the beer at some point?

Your LHBS knows what they are talking about.  My guess is a Brett infection.
In any case, give the equipment a few days of soaking in a bleach solution
but don't be surprised to see it again.

Sounds like a Brett infection to me.  The homebrew store is right, it's
tough to get rid of them.  They won't effect flavor unless you do long
term aging.  Eventually it'll start to have an impact, but as long as you're
not going to be sitting the bottles aside for several months you should
be fine.

I've gotten a couple Brett breakouts in the past.  What I did was to give
everything a good long soak in a bleach solution (IMO, make it stronger
than usual and let them soak for at least a day).  As far as the cheap stuff
like tubing, IMO it's best to throw it away and get new ones.  It's really
difficult to thoroughly clean tubing anyway.  Carboys, buckets, hydrometers,
etc should be fine with just a thorough bleaching.

John.

Thanks for the feedback.

I racked a batch last sunday in the same sterilized carboy I had the
problem with, and wednesday the white skin was back on top.

I will be sterilising all my equipment for the next few days and hope
that will be the last I see of the white scum.
BTW even though it's only a week in the keg the beer doesn't seem to
taste bad. It can only get better with age

thanks again
