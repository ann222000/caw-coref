Dear Mr. Williams,

I would like you to state for the record the following if you don't
mind, please.

1.  Are you aware of anything I've done to you personally that you felt
harmful?

2.  Is there a reason you find it necessary to respond to all matters I
post my comments upon?

3.  Do have a particular reason you dislike me personally?

4.  Is it your current plan to continue to respond to all of my posts
with unpleasant remarks?

5.  Do you work for any scientific organizations?

6.  Have you ever made a contribution in regard to earthquakes which
you would wish for us to acknowledge?

7.  Is there a humanitarian effort or community effort which you
received an award for or an acknowledgement from someone in a high
capacity which we should be aware of?

Give it thought, I'll check back in a week or so.

Thanks,

Petra

Petra,

Since when do you get to determine the parameters by which each of us is to
be judged? I'm sure most adults reading this could come up with their own
list, which would leave you a distant second. But, notably, they don't . . .

As long as you continue to make nonsensical statements in a sci. newsgroup,
and to so shamelessly give your ego such free rein, I, or others, will
challenge you.

Thank You Mr. Williams (if that's your real name),

Did you ever see that movie, "The List of Adrian Messenger?"

I have a list too and you're on it.  I'm taking all of your posts
directed at me to a local police profiler to determine the cause of
your animosity toward me which seems unfounded.  I need to understand
more about you and he'll be able to sort it out quite well as they are
trained to do just that kind of thing.

Not unlike science, if I don't understand something, I ask the
professionals.  Obviously, you don't or you'd know more than you do.
But the truth is the truth and not you nor I can change it.  But
understand it better, yes indeed we can.

You've been stalking me on the Internet for seven years and I have to
know why.  During those years you've never accomplished anything.  You
haven't finished your education, you haven't created an Internet site
to expand upon your idealist point of view, you've never offered an
opinion based upon research or anything you've learned.  IE:  You life
has been on hold during that time, but why?

As to you note regarding nonsensical posts, do you not recall that on
this very newsgroup I taught John Vidale the difference between a
natural geyser and a geothermal field in regard to their use in
earthquake prediction?

Was it not apparent that not all evaulation programs are experimental?
You haven't got any idea about the truth about this issue do you?

You who say you are an expert on the Parkfield Earthquake Prediction
Experiment did not know what occurred there in 1993.  You don't know
any of the scientists personally who participated in the program, so
you're view on it is rather limited at best.  I've never heard you say
you've been to Parkfield and I've been there so often that I am know to
the locals who like me very much.  Enough to feed me when I worked
there for free and enough to invite me to pray with them.

You've never had a law adopted from an idea of yours.  Nor a program
adopted by a state office.  You haven't been published or had air time
on a global scale either that I am aware of nor any idea of your own to
which you could say advanced public safety.  I am unaware of you
belonging to any scientific organizations which means your reading in
that regard is limited as well.  And lastly, I am unaware of you having
any contacts in government either in Washington, DC or Sacramento, CA
either.  Forming public policy requires both.

The next time you give one thought to saying I am nonsensical I think
you had better think twice about that because all of the above makes
perfect sense.

Now as to what the police profiler thinks about your behavior should be
most fasincating.

Good Day,

Petra

Just out of curiosity - I don't read every single post on this newsgroup and
read the group sporadically, but checking back a couple months and reading
your replies to Petra, I can't find anything remotely out of the ordinary -
unless being insufficiently worshipful of someone that seemingly perceives
themselves as the owner and operator of this newsgroup (and who attempted to
proclaim me a misogynist because I failed to congratulate Susan Hough on
something I was unaware of in the first place, after I questioned the
claimed qualifications of a quake predictor on her website) - is there
anything I missed or that is on another newsgroup?  I'm guessing not, and we
simply have a case of someone who really needs to get over herself.

John,

You'd make a very poor investigator and it's good that's not your
occupation or you wouldn't last very long.  There are only two
predictors on my web site, myself and Don Eck from Hollister.  No
others.

Secondly, Williams posts on several newsgroups and you failed to find
them.

And lastly, you don't have an e-mail from him that is the most
revealing piece of evidence.

In all my years on the Internet no one else has worked so hard to
interrupt my posting and tried to make me look foolish.  Seven years of
stalking me is enough and if I want to understand why, I'm entitled to
know.  I'm also entitled to know if it is in him to go to the next step
and come off of the Internet and attempt to silence me in another way.
I don't think so, but I've terribly wrong about a lot of people I used
to know.  So I'll leave it to the people who know about such things and
find out if that's possible too.

There is one recurrent theme on this board.  Anytime a woman posts that
she had made an accomplishment the men don't congratuate them.  Susan
Hough is perfect example.  Take a look at how many people have posted
after she mentioned something she's done.  She got a valued promotion
and you guys never said a word.  She has a new book out and few said
anything positive to her.  Why?

Everything I've done in regard to earthquake safety has been on my own
time, funded exclusively by me.  I do it because I want people to know
they can survive and in the midst of it I've survived cancer twice in
the last year.  I've endured every painful thing they can do to a human
being and haven't missed hardly a beat in the process and yet for every
accomplishment I've made I too am treated like Susan.  Why?

Petra Nova Challus
By and for earthquake survivors, let there be many more in 2007 and
beyond.

&gt; Don't bother you local police. Don't bother anyone.

Bob,

Your name is not Michael Williams, so it's none of your business, let's
keep it that way.

I don't bother the police, I work with them.  Believe me, there is
nothing more fascinating than working with a police profiler.  All the
things you miss, they get them instantly and it's nothing short of
amazing.   If you think geosciences is interesting, you haven't seen
anything yet compared to police work.

So let's turn Williams upside down and see what falls out.  I'm sorry I
can't share the results with you as it will be confidential.  Darn.

I'm guessing that most folks (like some of my colleagues!) A) have no
idea about the "promotion," and B) if they do, realize that they
should, if anything, offer condolences rather than congratulations &lt;g&gt;.
As for the new book, I am really eager for "Charlie" to make his way
out into the world and am hopeful that people will find the life story
as compelling as I do.  But right this second the book  isn't out yet.
It's been read by a modest handful of reviewers, the 20-odd people who
bought the copies that Princeton brought to AGU, and the dozen people
to whom I gave my advance copies.  At least, these are the people who
have had an opportunity to read the book -- I hope some of them
actually have, or will, read it.  So its not that I'm unappreciative of
congratulations, but at this point I haven't done much of anything to
deserve, let alone expect, it.

&gt;as compelling as I do.  But right this second the book  isn't out yet.
&gt;It's been read by a modest handful of reviewers, the 20-odd people who
&gt;bought the copies that Princeton brought to AGU, and the dozen people
&gt;to whom I gave my advance copies.  At least, these are the people who
&gt;have had an opportunity to read the book -- I hope some of them
&gt;actually have, or will, read it.  So its not that I'm unappreciative of
&gt;congratulations, but at this point I haven't done much of anything to
&gt;deserve, let alone expect, it.

Well, I like your Earthshaking Science book (though some of it is
complicated)!

In school I should have studied seismology instead of the 18th century
epistolary novel.

Petra,

Re Susan Hough, I'd have to call myself a "fan" of hers. I have
two of her books. I met her at her lecture and booksigning for
"Earthshaking Science". When she's posted about articles of
hers in the newspaper, I actually run out and buy a copy.

So, In my case at least, I'm hardly unappreciative of her. In
fact, I am VERY appreciative that a scientist of her caliber
would take the time to mingle with us rank amateurs and put up
with our pet theories. Susan is an example of what the science
of seismology needs more of, outreach to the common folk to
help them understand a complex science that affects hundreds of
millions of people on a daily basis.

I put her books on the same shelf as Hawking and Feynman. These
scientists as authors make science for the layperson enjoyable
and fun to read.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Your Honor, the prosecution rests. The People request a directed
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; verdict.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Michael Williams
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Arroyo Grande, CA USA

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just out of curiosity - I don't read every single post on this newsgroup
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; read the group sporadically, but checking back a couple months and
&gt;&gt;&gt; reading
&gt;&gt;&gt; your replies to Petra, I can't find anything remotely out of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; ordinary -
&gt;&gt;&gt; unless being insufficiently worshipful of someone that seemingly
&gt;&gt;&gt; perceives
&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves as the owner and operator of this newsgroup (and who
&gt;&gt;&gt; attempted to
&gt;&gt;&gt; proclaim me a misogynist because I failed to congratulate Susan Hough on
&gt;&gt;&gt; something I was unaware of in the first place, after I questioned the
&gt;&gt;&gt; claimed qualifications of a quake predictor on her website) - is there
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything I missed or that is on another newsgroup?  I'm guessing not,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and we
&gt;&gt;&gt; simply have a case of someone who really needs to get over herself.

&gt;&gt;John,

&gt;&gt;You'd make a very poor investigator and it's good that's not your
&gt;&gt;occupation or you wouldn't last very long.  There are only two
&gt;&gt;predictors on my web site, myself and Don Eck from Hollister.  No
&gt;&gt;others.

&gt;&gt;Secondly, Williams posts on several newsgroups and you failed to find
&gt;&gt;them.

&gt;&gt;And lastly, you don't have an e-mail from him that is the most
&gt;&gt;revealing piece of evidence.

&gt;&gt;In all my years on the Internet no one else has worked so hard to
&gt;&gt;interrupt my posting and tried to make me look foolish.

&gt; Yes one person has worked very hard to make you look foolish, petra,
&gt; that person is you.

&gt; &lt;snip of much foolisness&gt;

I'm going to have to side with Bob. She's starting to sound a lot like
someone else we knew who tried to take over another newsgroup.... " I AM A
MAN! I AM AN INDIVIDUAL!"

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Mr. Williams,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I would like you to state for the record the following if you don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mind, please.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.  Are you aware of anything I've done to you personally that you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; felt
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; harmful?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2.  Is there a reason you find it necessary to respond to all
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; matters I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; post my comments upon?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3.  Do have a particular reason you dislike me personally?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 4.  Is it your current plan to continue to respond to all of my
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; posts
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with unpleasant remarks?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 5.  Do you work for any scientific organizations?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 6.  Have you ever made a contribution in regard to earthquakes which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you would wish for us to acknowledge?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 7.  Is there a humanitarian effort or community effort which you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; received an award for or an acknowledgement from someone in a high
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; capacity which we should be aware of?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Give it thought, I'll check back in a week or so.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Petra

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Note: cross-post deleted

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Petra,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Since when do you get to determine the parameters by which each of us
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be judged? I'm sure most adults reading this could come up with their
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; own
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; list, which would leave you a distant second. But, notably, they don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; . . .

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As long as you continue to make nonsensical statements in a sci.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; newsgroup,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and to so shamelessly give your ego such free rein, I, or others, will
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; challenge you.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Michael F. Williams
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Arroyo Grande, CA USA

&gt;&gt; &gt;Thank You Mr. Williams (if that's your real name),

&gt;&gt; &gt;Did you ever see that movie, &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger?&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;I have a list too and you're on it.  I'm taking all of your posts
&gt;&gt; &gt;directed at me to a local police profiler to determine the cause of
&gt;&gt; &gt;your animosity toward me which seems unfounded.  I need to understand
&gt;&gt; &gt;more about you and he'll be able to sort it out quite well as they are
&gt;&gt; &gt;trained to do just that kind of thing.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Not unlike science, if I don't understand something, I ask the
&gt;&gt; &gt;professionals.  Obviously, you don't or you'd know more than you do.
&gt;&gt; &gt;But the truth is the truth and not you nor I can change it.  But
&gt;&gt; &gt;understand it better, yes indeed we can.

&gt;&gt; &gt;You've been stalking me on the Internet for seven years and I have to
&gt;&gt; &gt;know why.  During those years you've never accomplished anything.  You
&gt;&gt; &gt;haven't finished your education, you haven't created an Internet site
&gt;&gt; &gt;to expand upon your idealist point of view, you've never offered an
&gt;&gt; &gt;opinion based upon research or anything you've learned.  IE:  You life
&gt;&gt; &gt;has been on hold during that time, but why?

&gt;&gt; &gt;As to you note regarding nonsensical posts, do you not recall that on
&gt;&gt; &gt;this very newsgroup I taught John Vidale the difference between a
&gt;&gt; &gt;natural geyser and a geothermal field in regard to their use in
&gt;&gt; &gt;earthquake prediction?

&gt;&gt; &gt;Was it not apparent that not all evaulation programs are experimental?
&gt;&gt; &gt; You haven't got any idea about the truth about this issue do you?

&gt;&gt; &gt;You who say you are an expert on the Parkfield Earthquake Prediction
&gt;&gt; &gt;Experiment did not know what occurred there in 1993.  You don't know
&gt;&gt; &gt;any of the scientists personally who participated in the program, so
&gt;&gt; &gt;you're view on it is rather limited at best.  I've never heard you say
&gt;&gt; &gt;you've been to Parkfield and I've been there so often that I am know to
&gt;&gt; &gt;the locals who like me very much.  Enough to feed me when I worked
&gt;&gt; &gt;there for free and enough to invite me to pray with them.

&gt;&gt; &gt;You've never had a law adopted from an idea of yours.  Nor a program
&gt;&gt; &gt;adopted by a state office.  You haven't been published or had air time
&gt;&gt; &gt;on a global scale either that I am aware of nor any idea of your own to
&gt;&gt; &gt;which you could say advanced public safety.  I am unaware of you
&gt;&gt; &gt;belonging to any scientific organizations which means your reading in
&gt;&gt; &gt;that regard is limited as well.  And lastly, I am unaware of you having
&gt;&gt; &gt;any contacts in government either in Washington, DC or Sacramento, CA
&gt;&gt; &gt;either.  Forming public policy requires both.

&gt;&gt; &gt;The next time you give one thought to saying I am nonsensical I think
&gt;&gt; &gt;you had better think twice about that because all of the above makes
&gt;&gt; &gt;perfect sense.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Now as to what the police profiler thinks about your behavior should be
&gt;&gt; &gt;most fasincating.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Good Day,

&gt;&gt; &gt;Petra

&gt;&gt; Include this post Petra. You seem to be slipping a cog, big time.

&gt;&gt; Don't bother you local police. Don't bother anyone.

Welcome to the term: PUBLIC FORUM.
Which is why you should never post your real, let alone, full name on
usenet. One would think after being on usenet for "7 years" you would have
figured that out. Not everyone on the web is a happy-go-lucky, pot smoking
hippy from Pt. Reyes Station my dear.
BTW, my family was securing our water heater in the 1070's... We figured if
you didn't you were an idiot that got what you deserved. It's a good idea,
but it wasn't "yours"..

David,

You know, you might have ESP.

Williams wrote me once and said if we were in a social setting he
thought we would get along just fine, but on the Internet he was going
to treat me the way he does, with zero respect.

Does that mean he has a split personality.  One for the world to see
and another what he really is?  He said here in this thread that as
long as I kept making nonsensical posts he was going to attack me.  I
present a list of perfectly logical statements and then he acquiesses.
The truth of the matter is that he doesn't know much about geophysics.
He spends all of his time on the Internet demeaning other people
because it makes him feel superior.  I've seen this more than once
before and I know exactly what's wrong with him; he's an abusive
personality.

Abusive personalities are like Jekyl and Hyde.  In public everyone
thinks they're really nice people, fun to be around.  But what goes on
outside of their public eye is another person.  They are verbally and
sometimes physically abusive to their significant others and their
children.  It's really very classic.

80% of abusive personalities are non-violent.  20% are and of those 20%
- 8% will commit murder.  It is the ultimate act of someone who wants
to control another person and that's what abusive is all about,
control.  The horrid stories you read in the papers about men killing
their wives and sometimes their children too are those types.  They
come from every socio-economic group in America.

Those are the facts.  And here's another fact.  In 2000 the amount of
unpaid child support in America was $77 Trillion dollars.  Is there a
solution to this problem?  Yes.  But it's still a man's world and since
this affects mostly men, no one wants to solve it.  Congresswoman Lynn
Woolsey was a victim of abuse and became a welfare mom because her
ex-husband didn't pay his support.  Clinton gave her great praise for
overcoming and despite all of her obstacles became a congresswoman.
Today she sits on the Science Committee.  I know her, I've worked on
many community projects with her and I'm proud of her too.  And she's
proud of me for my proactice stance on earthquake safety issues in
California.

Williams can't control me.  I'm going to keep working on earthquake
safety until the end of my time despite every curve he tries to throw
at me.  His irritations just make me work a little harder.  For every
milestone I make I know it irritates him.  Oh Joy!

Ellis is right.

Susan, you write in a way that makes what is normally a complex
subject an easy read. You work with concepts and skip all the
tedious math and other hard stuff.

Steven Hawking does this in his "A Brief History of Time" which
made the best sellers lists becasue of it's readability.

I have several books by Richard Feynman, and a notable example
of this is his book "QED" (Quantum Electrodynamics) wherein he
describes the quantum mechanical nature of how light interacts
with matter and does it in only about 150 pages with no math.

Carl Sagan was another one to make science easy for everyone.
In fact, you can blame his series "Cosmos" on my path down the
scientific road. Looking back, I should have pursued my childhood
dream of being an astrophysicist.

All in all, making science accessible to the masses is what
we much need more of.

OK, I can't let this go any longer without saying something.

Petra, you better be prepared to back up your statements.
You have accused Michael of being a stalker, having a split
personality, of being abusive to his family and children,
of potentially being a murderer.

I don't know how Michael feels about this, but if it were
me, I'd be talking to an attorney about a defamation of
character lawsuit.

Petra, if he bothers you so much just ignore him. Block his
email address. Filter out is posts on usenet. Ignore his
posts elsewhere.

All you are doing now is embarrasing yourself, and possibly
leading towards legal trouble.

In court, as in science, the burden of proof is upon the
one making the claim.

In science, failure to support a wild claim just gets you
labeled as a nutjob.

In court, failure to support a wild claim can get you in
big trouble.

Just some friendly advice from someone who has no beef in
this argument.

&gt; OK, I can't let this go any longer without saying something.

&gt; Petra, you better be prepared to back up your statements.
&gt; You have accused Michael of being a stalker, having a split
&gt; personality, of being abusive to his family and children,
&gt; of potentially being a murderer.

&gt; I don't know how Michael feels about this, but if it were
&gt; me, I'd be talking to an attorney about a defamation of
&gt; character lawsuit.

&gt; Petra, if he bothers you so much just ignore him. Block his
&gt; email address. Filter out is posts on usenet. Ignore his
&gt; posts elsewhere.

Don't you know how it works Brian? I spent 3 decades living in Marin, I know
how these people think.
Petra is a perpetual victim.
Marin County Leftists are a special breed.
Nothing is their fault. Example...
Price of gas goes up; Your fault for driving a truck, and "evil oil company"
fault. Rather than buy some oil co. stock, they complain to their political
pals who try to pass idiotic laws like winfall profits taxes..... Which is
ok to do to oil companies but not to Microsoft, intel, or biotech companies.
She spouts off topic drivel, and gets slammed by a "stalker".... This is
probably just a guy that finds her whinning particularly annoying, and makes
it a point to slap her down when she behaves like a fool. Fault? Oh his of
course. If not his then it's the internet itself. Look for more legislation
comming out of the state legislature to protect the stupid from themselves.

So many people in Marin have never grown up. It's like living in an enormous
junior high school campus where the students are allowed to smoke as much
weed as they want. Always looking out for the poor, by driving in volvos and
sipping $5 coffees.... It's easy to be a Marin County Leftist, just marry
someone with lots of money, and smoke pot all day long..... dude........
Then drown everyone you meet with tales of how hard you have it because some
mean man is being mean to you and hurting your feelings...

Everyone is so worried about their "feelings". They've made it illegal to
tell an idiot, " dude, you're an idiot"...
This is why we have aircraft sticking out of skyscrapers...... Most people
on earth don't care about anyones "feelings". But in Marin they will cry
foul and protect those who will no sooner cut their throats.

JERRY GARCIA IS DEAD.

Get on with your damn lives.
