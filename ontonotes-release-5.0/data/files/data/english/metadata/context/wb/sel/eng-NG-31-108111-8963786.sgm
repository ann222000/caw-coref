Diddy,
I am in.  Will you please re-print the address for the tricky dog
video/Elkhound rescue?  I did scan all of the posts, but I can't find it
after two go rounds.

Be Free.....Judy

Scroll down to paypal.
They send the complimentary copy of the tricky dog show to people who
donate $25 or more.

I hope you enjoy it as much as we had fun making it.

Did you see Tuck's latest video?
