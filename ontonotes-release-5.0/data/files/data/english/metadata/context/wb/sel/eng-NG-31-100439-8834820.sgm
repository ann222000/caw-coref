HOWEDY People,

Interesting stuff. From the article:
THE MEDICINAL USE OF PLANTS BY
CHIMPANZEES IN THE WILD

Michael A. Huffman, Primate Research Institute,
Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi 484 JAPAN

Chemo-ethology of the Hominoid Inteteractions
of Medicinal Plants and Parasites.

An assay of the plant samples collected in November
1991 after use by an ill female chimpanzee confirmed
that the two most bioactive constituents in this plant,
vernodalin, and vernonioside B1 were present. The
highly toxic compound, vernodalin, was found only in
the leaves, not in the pith of the plant she used, which
instead contained significant amounts of vernonioside B1.

This same pattern was latter verified in analyses made
on other V. amygdalina specimens collected at various
locations in Mahale during different seasons.

We believe that because chimpanzees rarely use
anything but the pith, and discard the bark and l
eaves in the process, they have learned to differentiate
between the plant parts that contain compounds
harmful to them from those parts that contain
compounds of benefit.

Observations have shown that young chimpanzees
will closely copy the processing techniques of both
bitter pith-chewing and leaf-swallowing performed
by their sick mothers or those nearby.

In general chimpanzees tend to be very conservative
in their feeding habits. As part of growing up, they
have to learn what and how to eat by watching the
behavior of their elders.

In this way, knowledge and experience of the group
is passed down in the form of behavioral tradition,
a process which allows many individuals to benefit
from the experience of a few.

In doing so, as in the case of medicinal plant use,
the dangers of individual experimentation with
poisonous plants is limited to a few.

This resembles somewhat the way in which Mohamedi's
grandfather learned from trial and error about mulengelele
and the experience was passed on to his grandson. However,
there is one big difference. Chimpanzees do not teach each
other or encourage a sick individual to take medicine.

This new discipline has grown out of the scientific
endeavor to understand more about the ways in
which animals may be treating themselves with
the use of plants.

Due to the constraints and difficulties of systematic
research of this kind on wild animal populations, our
knowledge is still limited. Regardless, there truly
seems to be something to the age-old idea that
animals have potentially important lessons to teach
about medicinal plants.

---------------

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Some of the monkeys learned over a thousand words
&gt; and started teaching the language to other monkeys,
">

Yeah? Even MONKEYS can learn basic arithmetic:

&quot;Whelan illustrates the simple nature or the
learning process by referring to Ferster's
engaging study of two three year old
chimpanzees taught mathematics through
simple procedures. Whelan carries this
EVIDENCE a step futher by pointing HOWET
it's applicability to disturbed children.
If chimpanzees CAN LEARN mathematics
through step by step learning AT THEIR OWN
PACE, reinforced primarily by CORRECT
ANSWERS rather than with &quot;fruit loops and
rasins&quot;, we can assume that even developmentally
RETARDED or CONfHOWENDED children
CAN LEARN as well. Moreover, Whelan
makes the EXXXTREMELY important point
that while most teachers assume that learning
takes place verbally, primarily it is a non verbal
process..

Unfortunately Whelan limits himself to the problem
that &quot;teachers must not only modify or remove specific
deviant behaviors, but must also develop socially
acceptable behavior patterns in the classroom and
classroom conditioned goals, NOT LEARNING.

Other researchers have emphasized the importance
of adult behaviors in conditioning classroom behavior.
An EXXXCELLENT review of this research showd that
tantrum behavior, excessive crawling and dependency,
isolated play, passivity, spelling failure, and other problem
behaviorscan be managed by altering habitual adult
responses to children (Harris, Wolf and Baer, 1964) .

Such RESEARCH holds GREATER PROMISE in that
alteration of the conditioning social environment seems
to provide more STABLE and LASTING CHANGES
than &quot;M and M's&quot;.

Moreover, a great deal of work has been done developing
EFFECTIVE techniques of behavior modificaton through
the conditioning social environment of peers (Hartup, 1964).
These directions would seem more PRODUCTIVE than a
simple minded trainslation of the Skinner cage to the classroom.&quot;

But do you think your fellHOWE DOG LOVERS CAN LEARN
HOWE to handle raise an train their dogs an kats withHOWET
HURTIN INTIMIDATIN MUTILATIN an MURDERIN THEM?

Of curse they CAN. HOWEver, THEY WON'T.

They WON'T on accHOWENTA THEY DON'T WANT TO
on accHOWENTA to DO SO would diminish their G-D like
AUTHORITY.

So, it's back to givin their dogs &quot;THE KINDEST GIFT&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  but when they were observed talking to each other
&gt; they never went beyond wanting something. &quot;Me
&gt; want toy.&quot;

Of curse. What would you EXXXPECT from a child like mind?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; At least so far  none of them has asked the more profound
&gt; questions like, &quot;Where do I come  from? Why you teach me
&gt; to talk?&quot;
">

Even a feral kat KNOWS where baby kats come from. And
as for TALKIN, they CAN, so, teachin them to talk is
IRRELEVENT IMMATERIAL and INCONSEQUENTIAL
insofar as the CRITTER is concerned.

PERHAPS the question shoulda been 'HOWE COME
are you humans interested in LEARNIN HOWE to
TALK TO US? Whassa matter, your pronged spiked

Another American who feels he has to do other people's thinking for them.
Where do you come of calling me a psychopath? A lot of people on this
newsgroup label anyone with a opinion, especially a differing opinion, a
psychopath or troll on this forum.

Here's the definition...
A mentally unbalanced person who is inclined toward antisocial and criminal
behavior.

It doesn't say anything about expressing opinion.

Look at this...
http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_2_scared_of_pit.html

&quot;Pit bulls have been bred specifically to be aggressive. They're descended
from the now- extinct old English &quot;bulldogge,&quot; a big, tenacious breed used
in the brutal early- nineteenth-century sport of bull baiting, in which
rowdy spectators watched dogs tear apart an enraged bull. Victorian
reformers, concerned about the coarsening effect bull baiting had on its
devotees, banned it by the early 1830s, but enterprising bull baiters merely
migrated to an equally bloody sport: organized dog fighting.

As Carl Semencic, author of several informative books on guard dogs, and a
big pit-bull fan, describes it, the bulldogge owners made a striking
discovery: &quot;a cross between the bulldogge and any of the game [i.e., brave
and tenacious] and relatively powerful terriers of the day produced a game,
powerful, agile, and smaller, more capable opponent in the dog pits.&quot; These
bull-and-terrier crosses became renowned for fighting prowess and soon were
the only dogs used in organized dog fighting in England and later in the
United States. To preserve the bull-and-terrier's pugnacious traits, the
dogs were bred only to dogs of the same cross. Thus was born the pit-bull
terrier, &quot;the most capable fighting dog known to modern man,&quot; Semencic
enthuses.&quot;

It's a dog breed that's perfect for the type of person who loves anarchy and
intimidation. Maybe you can civilize a few of them with enough love, but the
fact remains they're very easily turned into nasty, aggressive dogs that can
make neighborhoods unliveable. It's so obvious I've really got to wonder
about the sincerity of the above poster who claims to raise them out of
love. Sounds more like there's a strong, hidden desire to churn up
uneccessary trouble.

yecchh!  Now, why was he demanding
that YOU clean it up?

Once I had a housemate who acquired a
stray cat while I was on vacation.  Before
I knew about the cat, when I walked into the
bedroom that we shared, I thought, &quot;Damn,
Sarah must not have done laundry for WEEKS!&quot;

Shortly after that, I spotted the cat.

Further investigation revealed that the damned
cat had been sh*tting in my SHOES.  Not Sarah's
shoes.  MINE.

Not too smart of that cat, particularly since I'm
allergic and he was treading on thin ice in that
domain already.  He clinched it a couple of days
later when I was carrying him out of the bedroom
(now forbidden territory), and the dog (big white
Shepherd mix) came trotting around the corner.
Cat freaked, clawed and bit me.

Sorry, but that kitty had to go to the animal shelter
the next day.  (I would have had the same reaction
if the dog had bit me.)

&gt;&gt; not want to hear a word about me being depressed.
&gt;&gt; They just want to hear what I am doing to make it better.  I have
&gt;&gt; never been very good at pretending that everything is fine when it is
&gt;&gt; not.  To me that only makes the actually problem even worse.   Does
&gt;&gt; anyone have any suggestions how they have gotten through depressed
&gt;&gt; periods with very few, if any one to talk to?
">

I've been dysthymic for much of my adult life,

dys·thy·mi·a      /d s  a mi /

-noun                  depression; despondency or
a tendency to be despondent.

though it wasn't diagnosed until I got depressed enough during
perimenopause to decide that I needed to drag myself to a shrink.

Counseling helped, antidepressants Paxil (though I don't really
recommend it because it's so darned difficult to get off of) and
Celexa helped.  And I highly recommend a book that is written
to help people who are going through depression:  Feeling Good,
by David Burns.  It's a cognitive-therapy approach towards changing
depression-inducing thought patterns, and it contains a lot of useful
suggestions.  The approach is also backed by a lot of research.

I also found this book and some of the amino acids to be very
helpful, and I take tryptophan daily (for some reason it seems
to work better for me than 5-HTP, but that could be illusory),
with occasional L-tyrosine and DL-phenylalanine.

I stopped taking Celexa about a year and a half ago. As the
dysthymic symptoms crept back, I felt that I needed something,
but didn't want to go back on Celexa, so I tried this approach.  It -
plus using cognitive-therapy techniques on myself - has worked
pretty well for me.

I find myself feeling much better if I get in a daily walk.  Several
studies have found that regular aerobic exercise is about as effective
as antidepressant meds for lifting mild-to-moderate depression.

Another thing you can do (and I don't always take my own
advice on this) is avoid simple carbohydrates (sugar, refined
flour, rice stripped of bran), eat what carbs you consume in
unprocessed form, and eat more protein.  And try to get more
omega-3 oils in the form of oily fish (but avoid the farmed
ones) or vegetable oils like flax oil.

If your depression is related to stress (or even if it is not)
meditation can help.  A book on this that I really like is
&quot;Minding the Body, Mending the Mind&quot; by Joan Borysenko.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I wish you the best of luck with this - it's very hard to be depressed

Yes and yes!  I hope some of this helps.

&quot;Paul E. Schoen&quot; &lt;pst ... @smart.net&gt; wrote

Hello everyone:

If you have followed some of my posts, you know
something about the ongoing story of Muttley, the
large GSD/Chow dog I have been trying to adopt
or place in a better home.

I will add a bit more history later in this post.

Last Tuesday, toward the end of Janet's obedience
class, Muttley and I had just finished fairly successfully
performing a sit/stay/come routine, and then he was
sitting by my side.

The final routine was to be a &quot;down&quot;, which Muttley
has had some difficulty with, and frankly I have not
had the time to work with him much on that.

I was kneeling at his side, trying to hold his collar
while pushing his front legs down to the position,
while he resisted. Suddenly he lunged, knocking
me over onto the parking lot, and I lost grip of the
leash as I reflexively broke my fall.

Muttley took the opportunity to attack a young black
male Lab to my left, and it was a very brutal attack.
Janet and the instructors tried to gain control, and as
soon as I could get to my feet I grabbed the leash and
pulled him off.

That was  the end of the class, and the other dog,
Bernie, was taken to an animal hospital for treatment.

When everyone had left, Janet counseled me about
what should be done about Muttley.

She said this was more than ordinary aggression,
and only intensive (and expensive) one on one
training would have any chance at working, and
in any case, he was not suited to group training.

She advised me that Muttley could be dangerous,
and she recommended that he be euthanized.

&quot;They can't all be saved&quot;.

&lt;snip&gt;

Subject:       Muttley: Now a question of Life or Death
&quot;Paul E. Schoen&quot; &lt;pst ... @smart.net&gt; wrote

&lt;snip&gt;

If I did not have to worry about my cat, I would
probably keep him, and I am certain I could avoid
any more dangerous episodes. I probably would
not have taken him to obedience classes at this time
if that was not such a difficult issue, and if people
here had not essentially shamed me into doing so.

Then he would only be a bratty dog with a mind of
his own, but he would not have been identified as
dangerous.

It seems I have been dealing with this a bit lately.
Dog to dog and dog to person,, with dogs who are
obviously overstimulated by what's in front of them.

What's in front of them varies from people at the door
to dogs in their path or directly in their face.  The dogs
in question all have very poor self control.

I have dog(s) with not-so-great-natural self control,
so it's something we constantly work on.  We don't
have redirected stuff going on, because we have enough
obedience to avoid it.

While I know that's the big answer for the dogs in
question as well, I'm curious what things people have
found useful to redirect/focus/gain attention from
drivey dogs or just very distracted of over-the-top dogs.

We're having success with my recommendations, but I'm
always open to something novel that may be the hot ticket.

&gt; Sorry, Paul, but the gloves are now off, because if I HAD

&gt; What the FUCKING HELL is **WRONG** with you???

&gt; Your dog, which you have repeatedly admitted you can't
&gt; control, just made a near-lethal unprovoked attack on
&gt; another dog in obedience class, and you TOOK HIM
&gt; OUT ON THE TRAILS WHERE THERE ARE OTHER
&gt; DOGS?????

&gt; You do that again, when my dogs are around, and he attacks
&gt; one of them, you won't have to worry about having him put

&gt;  Um, may I suggest a re-wording that might make
&gt;  it  clearer- given that &quot;scruff shake&quot; is too easily
&gt;  misinterpreted as &quot;pick the puppy up by the scruff
&gt;  of the neck and shake the puppy in the air&quot;?

&gt;  I think I'd phrase it something like &quot;if the puppy
&gt;  is very persistant, it  can be appropriate to take
&gt;  hold of the loose skin at the back of the neck and
&gt;  give a slight shake to the *skin*&quot;.

&gt;  Janet's not talking about actually shaking

&gt; &quot;Paul E. Schoen&quot; &lt;pst ... @smart.net&gt; wrote

&gt; Hello everyone:

&gt; If you have followed some of my posts, you know
&gt; something about the ongoing story of Muttley, the
&gt; large GSD/Chow dog I have been trying to adopt
&gt; or place in a better home.

&gt; I will add a bit more history later in this post.

&gt; Last Tuesday, toward the end of Janet's obedience
&gt; class, Muttley and I had just finished fairly successfully
&gt; performing a sit/stay/come routine, and then he was
&gt; sitting by my side.

&gt; The final routine was to be a &quot;down&quot;, which Muttley
&gt; has had some difficulty with, and frankly I have not
&gt; had the time to work with him much on that.

&gt; I was kneeling at his side, trying to hold his collar
&gt; while pushing his front legs down to the position,
&gt; while he resisted. Suddenly he lunged, knocking
&gt; me over onto the parking lot, and I lost grip of the
&gt; leash as I reflexively broke my fall.

&gt; Muttley took the opportunity to attack a young black
&gt; male Lab to my left, and it was a very brutal attack.
&gt; Janet and the instructors tried to gain control, and as
&gt; soon as I could get to my feet I grabbed the leash and
&gt; pulled him off.

&gt; That was  the end of the class, and the other dog,
&gt; Bernie, was taken to an animal hospital for treatment.

&gt; When everyone had left, Janet counseled me about
&gt; what should be done about Muttley.

&gt; She said this was more than ordinary aggression,
&gt; and only intensive (and expensive) one on one
&gt; training would have any chance at working, and
&gt; in any case, he was not suited to group training.

&gt; She advised me that Muttley could be dangerous,
&gt; and she recommended that he be euthanized.

&gt; &quot;They can't all be saved&quot;.

&gt; If I did not have to worry about my cat, I would
&gt; probably keep him, and I am certain I could avoid
&gt; any more dangerous episodes. I probably would
&gt; not have taken him to obedience classes at this time
&gt; if that was not such a difficult issue, and if people
&gt; here had not essentially shamed me into doing so.

&gt; Then he would only be a bratty dog with a mind of
&gt; his own, but he would not have been identified as
&gt; dangerous.

&gt; Dog to dog and dog to person,, with dogs who are

&gt; What's in front of them varies from people at the door

&gt; I have dog(s) with not-so-great-natural self control,

One of the problems with bark collars, especially with dogs that have
wiry
or wooly coats is contact with the dog's neck.  These collars have to
be
snug so that both the microphone pickup and the stimulus prongs are
in
direct contact with the neck.  If a collar is loose it may respond to
a bark
at one time and not at another... the dog learns nothing.  Loose
collars
seem humane but completely eliminate any chance that the dog will
learn to
stop barking.  When the collar is fitted properly the dog will learn
to stop
barking in a very few seconds.

It is important to keep the collar on the dog for a long time (weeks)
after
it has learned not to bark.  If the dog associates the collar with
the
stimulus it will not bark when wearing the collar and will bark when
the
collar isn't on the dog.

I have found that dogs learn so rapidly with a bark collar that there
isn't
much discomfort... they figure it out by the second bark.  Note that
modern
bark collars are discriminating, the barking of another dog won't set
them
off.

Until i read the Jerry method of Bark reductioon,
it went something like this with our 11 month old
puppy &quot;Yoshi&quot;

Yoshi: Bark, bark,

us: HUSH Youshi

Yoshi Bark, bark...........

us: Hush Youshi

Yoshi BARK, BARK, BARK, .......

it stopped when Yoshi got tired barking

We decided to try the Jerry method:

Yoshi:  BARK, BARK

US: GOOD Yoshi, Good Boy, who is it?

Yoshi Bark, Bark

US: It's ok, good boy Yoshi, We know them

Yosh without fail, now stops after we say that

I must say, it is so much more fun, when we
can praise him, to deal with things like this

Hello everyone! We have a 2 1/2 year old male

Well I just printed out the Amazing Puppy
Wizard info, so I haven't actually started
to train yet.

Today a salesman knocked on the door, and Pokey
was going balisstic. I calmly go to the window
to see who it is, and off-handly say Good Boy,
It's a stranger, Good Boy.

Pokey shut right up, gave me a quizical look,
and came and sat beside my feet!

OMG, I could not believe it!

I was totally floored, as this has been his
behavior since a pup. Just wanted to update,

Hello.

I never posted here (or anywhere) before.
I never trained or owned a dog before this
year.

I downloaded the Wit's End, read it, corresponded
with Mr. Howe and trained my dog to come and to
stop barking in a weekend.

Our dog, Jake, had been treated with kindness the
whole time we had him, about 10 months, but his
earlier life is unknown.

I worked on the hot-cold exercise for about 30
minutes when he suddenly &quot;got it&quot;. After that
he came to me every time with no hesitation.

I used the cans filled with pennies to teach him
not to bark. If he now starts to bark, I go to the
door or window, say &quot;Good Boy, its' alright&quot; and
he usually calms down right away.

A couple of times I had to get the cans
out again to reinforce the behavior.

We feel a strong bond with this animal
and he is very eager to accept our  love.

So with all the vitriolic spewing going on,
I have to believe Mr. Howe is right.

His method worked for us.

I don't know if it would have been quite
as effective if we had tried another method first.

It's called positive thigmotaxis, the opposition reflex.
Like if we're walking our dog and want to prevent him
from interacting with another dog, and we pull back
on the collar, that often triggers the dog to go out of
control.

As long as there's contact on the collar, the dog will
continue his original thoughts about interacting with
the passerby. Then because the dog is out of control,
the handler needs to further force restraint, making
communication with the dog's MIND, impossible.

One of the problems with bark collars, especially with dogs that have
wiry
or wooly coats is contact with the dog's neck.  These collars have to
be
snug so that both the microphone pickup and the stimulus prongs are
in
direct contact with the neck.  If a collar is loose it may respond to
a bark
at one time and not at another... the dog learns nothing.  Loose
collars
seem humane but completely eliminate any chance that the dog will
learn to
stop barking.  When the collar is fitted properly the dog will learn
to stop
barking in a very few seconds.

It is important to keep the collar on the dog for a long time (weeks)
after
it has learned not to bark.  If the dog associates the collar with
the
stimulus it will not bark when wearing the collar and will bark when
the
collar isn't on the dog.

I have found that dogs learn so rapidly with a bark collar that there
isn't
much discomfort... they figure it out by the second bark.  Note that
modern
bark collars are discriminating, the barking of another dog won't set
them
off.

Until i read the Jerry method of Bark reductioon,
it went something like this with our 11 month old
puppy &quot;Yoshi&quot;

Yoshi: Bark, bark,

us: HUSH Youshi

Yoshi Bark, bark...........

us: Hush Youshi

Yoshi BARK, BARK, BARK, .......

it stopped when Yoshi got tired barking

We decided to try the Jerry method:

Yoshi:  BARK, BARK

US: GOOD Yoshi, Good Boy, who is it?

Yoshi Bark, Bark

US: It's ok, good boy Yoshi, We know them

Yosh without fail, now stops after we say that

I must say, it is so much more fun, when we
can praise him, to deal with things like this

Thanks Jerry

ps: We are just starting to go thru the Jerry
Papers, and learn how to live with our son
&quot;Yoshi&quot;, whom we love very much.

Hello everyone! We have a 2 1/2 year old male

Well I just printed out the Amazing Puppy
Wizard info, so I haven't actually started
to train yet.

Today a salesman knocked on the door, and Pokey
was going balisstic. I calmly go to the window
to see who it is, and off-handly say Good Boy,
It's a stranger, Good Boy.

Pokey shut right up, gave me a quizical look,
and came and sat beside my feet!

OMG, I could not believe it!

I was totally floored, as this has been his
behavior since a pup. Just wanted to update,
and Pokey and I are hitting the sack...;)

Hello.

I never posted here (or anywhere) before.
I never trained or owned a dog before this
year.

I downloaded the Wit's End, read it, corresponded
with Mr. Howe and trained my dog to come and to
stop barking in a weekend.

Our dog, Jake, had been treated with kindness the
whole time we had him, about 10 months, but his
earlier life is unknown.

I worked on the hot-cold exercise for about 30
minutes when he suddenly &quot;got it&quot;. After that
he came to me every time with no hesitation.

I used the cans filled with pennies to teach him
not to bark. If he now starts to bark, I go to the
door or window, say &quot;Good Boy, its' alright&quot; and
he usually calms down right away.

A couple of times I had to get the cans
out again to reinforce the behavior.

We feel a strong bond with this animal
and he is very eager to accept our  love.

So with all the vitriolic spewing going on,
I have to believe Mr. Howe is right.

His method worked for us.

I don't know if it would have been quite
as effective if we had tried another method first.

and make them HAPPY is to PRAISE THEM.

It's moore than a chapter, it's a comprehensive,

Excellent.

Yes, one of my students Paul B wrote an excellent post

Why? That should be spontaneous and in association

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's so hard not to pet and stroke the dog
&gt; (especially our seven month old).
">

Oh. Patting is O.K., only not in conjunction with a
thought or command, as it will interrupt the thought
process and may lock the dog's thoughts on an
inappropriate idea.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Can you give me the rationale behind that?
">

It's called positive thigmotaxis, the opposition reflex.
Like if we're walking our dog and want to prevent him
from interacting with another dog, and we pull back
on the collar, that often triggers the dog to go out of
control.

As long as there's contact on the collar, the dog will
continue his original thoughts about interacting with
the passerby. Then because the dog is out of control,
the handler needs to further force restraint, making
communication with the dog's MIND, impossible.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It will help me modify my own behavior.

Any time your dog is close enough to be patted is
fine to pat him, as long as we're not
