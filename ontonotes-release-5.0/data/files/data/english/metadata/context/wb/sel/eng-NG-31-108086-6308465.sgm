Recently there were two quotes one of Herman Goring and the other by Dwight
Eisenhower poster to this newsgroup. They were  diametrically opposed in
philosophy and I would like to put them in a saved folder. Would it be
possible for the original posters to post them again or send me an email of
their contents. Thanks for your indulgence. Pete

Hmm.. haven't you ever heard of searching the Usenet archives?

You already have couple of  good keywords to search for: Goring and
Eisenhower, or Herman and Dwight. Just make sure to spell Goring
correctly.

I'm sure that there aren't many r.m.s. posts containing those words in
them. Especially recent posts...

Go fish... :-)
