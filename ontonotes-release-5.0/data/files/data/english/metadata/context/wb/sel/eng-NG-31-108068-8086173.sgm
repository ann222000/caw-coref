With the election right around the corner, looks like our ability to
buy autofeeding rifles is going to dry up real quick.

Have any of you guys looked into buying one before the future powers
that be get in?

I've been looking at both the M1a from Springfield (I like the Socom
16), and the Mini 14 from Ruger. (I live in CA... AR15s, etc are out
of the question...) But I can still buy an identically functioning
rifle as long as it doesnt look &quot;big and black.&quot; (God I love the
Peoples Republic of Kalifornia)

What are your guys opinions?

I live in California too.  I thought they would outlaw semi auto pistols
before rifles.  Where'd you get your info.

Thanks

Sounds to me like you have a pessimistic attitude. We can make a difference
by our actions, (or inaction), with the upcoming elections. I plan on
working hard for the candidates who share my beliefs.

The rifle's operating system doesn't matter as much as the skill of
the shooter.  Maybe the new Minis are different but the several I've
shot were bullet hoses whose primary virtues were reliability with
factory magazines and not being on the CA ban list.  As for the M1A
the Socom 16, followed closely by the Scout Squad, is a handier than
the full length job and has fewer sharp edges than the Socom II.  All
that said, most anything a fella can do with the Mini or the M1A he
can do more efficiently with a 308 Savage Sierra, Remington Seven, or
Ruger 77 Ultralight and a low powered scope.

In the name of caution regarding our government I've been itching that
scratch for at least 30yrs so that base should be covered. In my case
the emphasis is on more ammunition, if not ready rolls, reloading
equipment even if that's not your thing at the moment for I feel that
is where their iron is going to strike first relentlessly if not for
any reason but revenge. I've been saying it for years, those bastards
don't forget and the bunch running on the republican ticket shouldn't
be trusted farther than one can throw a midget. Either way we're

Cheap surplus .308 is long gone, .30-06 is actually cheaper.  I see no
reason to bugger up a perfectly good .30-06 Garand to shoot a lesser
round.

As far as politics, get out of that liberal sump CA has become and see
how the rest of the country lives. Best day of my life was the one
where I saw that border receding in the rear-view mirror.

Gosh, I feel so sorry for you having such a tough decision
to make; I wish it was me. ;)

All kidding aside, have you seen the ads for Ruger's new
Ranch Rifle with the TA! DA! Heavy Barrel?  I think this
will re-invent the Mini series for Ruger.  I mean, after all,
the major complaint has always been accuracy, especially
when the skinny, original barrel warmed-up.

It sure would be nice if anyone has this new rifle already
and wouldn't mind giving us their impressions.

I have seven SKSs.  Three that had trigger work.  One Russian
paratrooper modified to take magazines.  30 round prongs only.
All three in use with muzzle brakes.  The long range Russian had some
barrel work done, chamber rebored, sniper stock, good scope, muzzle
brake is welded on.  It's the little things.  Four of the SKS's are
still in cosmoleen like the day I bought them In that safe that
doesn't usually get opened unless grand kids are her and they want to
drool for awhile, or stake a claim one something in particular..  I
only buy Russian and Chinese..
You see, I stared out as a child.  When I got off the plane at Da Nang
I got handed an SKS, and a US Army Manual for it, and was told there
would be three of us in the company using these to &quot;Confuse the
enemy.&quot;  Unlike the other grunts, we never had jams, never had trouble
finding more ammo, and in the jungle I never had a chance at a 300
yard shot.    Here in Arizona I can keep all ten inside an eight inch
pie plate which to me means I hit the torso.  It is also the easiest
weapon to convert to full auto I know of, but you can't go back and
forth.  If we came to a SHTF situation I figure it would take me four
minutes to properly use the file and make it rock and roll.  So you
complaint is what?  With a little work you can messily hit targets at
300 rounds.  Also assuming you are using the right ammo, something
often overlooked in this group.  I can have a short full auto lead
sprayer.  Or I can have fun at the range with ammo that is still
cheaper than$180/1000 if you look around a little.  Don't me wrong,
there were times In Country I used an M16.  Since I an sort of anal
about cleaning I never had a problem.  My wife dearly loves here
bushmaster and has putt over 10,000 rounds through it.  But it is one
of only three rifles she shoots.
For all the guns and the work done to them I spent less than $2000 and
haven't even unwrapped four of them except for the trip to the
gunsmith for a general checkout.I have eight grandchildren who shoot
and I am not going to all their projects for them.  I hear guys at the
range bitchin about these $5,000 shotguns they have to send back to
the factory twice to get it right.. They are all just our toys unless
something really bad happens.  We all like different ones.  AIN'T IT
FUN?

ps .I can do head shots at 500 yards with one of my Rugers.  But the
shots are only for deer and elk and it seems like I haven't been drawn

Roy, I know exactly how you feel!! Wish those Californians would quit
moving here and hogging up all the deer and elk tags and driving up
the price of real estate. Maybe if they learned how to drive I could
tolerate them but why do they have to bring their liberal politics
with. Wait till the next earthquake and we will likely have to be
drawn for jack rabbits. I haven't got a javy, deer or elk tag in over
3 years.

Anyone who thinks the gun-hating Dems won't control the WH and both
houses of Congress is deluded.  The vast majority of gun owners simply
will not vote for the 2nd Amendment - hell, the vast majority will not
even join a gun-rights organization!

Personally, I am pretty well set in terms of semi-auto hardware and
magazines. In the politically incorrect deptment, I've got a stnless/
syn 'new model' Mini-14GB, an Arsenal AK, and a Benelli M4 in my
collection. If gas-piston AR-15s became reasonably priced, (it's worth
about a $25 premium, not hundreds!), I would replace the Bushmaster I
sold a few yrs back, but I don't see that happening in enough time. I
would like a SIG-556 though...

Since you live in the PRK, I'd suggest:
1) a good SKS - The only one I'd buy is a mid-50s Russian.  Don't mess
it up by trying to convert it to a detachable mag, the internal 10
rounder has some advantages.  Easy to keep tons of ammo on strippers -
it's a very fast load.  If you want to make it 'pretty', a good
quality synthetic stock can be had.
2) a Mini-14, preferably stainless with a synthetic stock.  Nowhere
near the equal of an AR-15 at a range, but probably more dependable in
the muck.  If you buy used, I'd suggest one made on the last several
years with a 9&quot; twist, not a 7&quot;.  Yeah, factory 20 rounders can be
pricy, but aftermarket are so cheap, they're worth trying, just be
sure to cull, (and return for replacement), the mis-feeders.  Or bite
the bullet for one factory 20 and use a pocket full of the std 5
rounders for a still fast re-load.  I have (4) factory 20s and (4) 5
rounders for mine.
3) a 10/22.  Even though semi-auto .22s don't appear to be threatened,
with full dem. control, they might well be.  Cheap, and easy to stock
up on tons of ammo at a moment's notice.

Very well said!

Additionally, the OP mentioned a Mini-14 is his post.  An SKS and a
Mini-14 are pretty similar in accuracy IMO.  So, for less money, you
get the same accuracy and same reliability (I'd rate my Mini as having
high reliability - just as I'd rate my SKS's as high).

Sadly, I must agree, and a large part of the blame must fall on us.  We
gun owners are often our own worse enemies.  I haven't decided who is
worse:
. the idiots who show up at town meetings in camo spouting off such
tasteful comments as &quot;I can kill you just as easily with a bolt
action as with a semi-auto&quot;.
. the old farts who are all for gun bans, since the bans are for &quot;bad
guns&quot; and nobody will ever ban their deer rifles and duck guns.  [And
if you believe that I have a bridge in the Twin Cities I'd like to
sell you...]
. the zealots who badmouth other gun owners for &quot;not doing enough for
RKBA&quot;, and so infuriate people that they don't vote (or are driven to
vote for an anti-gun candidate).

Here are some principles and ground rules that I would like to ask people
to consider:
. Gun owners are Good People, and law-abiding responsible citizens, by
definition.  Let's stop badmouthing other gun owners.
. There is no such thing as a &quot;bad&quot; shooting sport.  It may not be your
cup of tea, but any shooting sport that is played safely and
responsibly (including appropriate clean-up afterwards) is Good By
Definition.  Let's stop badmouthing other people's shooting sports.
. A criminal may possess a gun illegally, but he is not a gun owner by
definition in law.  As the law says that criminals are not counted in
our ranks, we should not be tarred by the acts of criminals.
. There is no such thing as a &quot;bad gun&quot;.  A gun is an inanimate object.
Some guns have more pleasing cosmetics than others; but beauty is in
the eye of the beholder.  Some guns have better technical aspects
than others; but that is &quot;quality vs. crap&quot; rather than &quot;good vs bad.&quot;
. Every contribution by every gun owner to the cause of RKBA is valuable.
Some people will do more than others; but that does not make those
people &quot;better&quot;.  The arrogance of looking down at others as being
&quot;free riders&quot; on your good work will destroy the value of all your
work.
. Last but not least: far more flies are caught with honey than with
vinegar.  Every nervous first-timer who comes away from the range a
smiling convert is *far* more valuable to the cause of RKBA than
someone you have browbeaten into submission.

# Since you live in the PRK, I'd suggest:

Why not an M1 Garand?  Even Canada's harsh gun laws exempt it by name
(along with Lee Enfield rifles) from the 5 round magazine limit on
semi-automatic centerfire rifles.  This is the one and only rifle that I
would choose if the fit should ever hit the shan.

An SKS is a fun and inexpensive plinker; and generally has not been caught
up in &quot;assault weapon&quot; bans.  I agree that the Russian ones are of better
quality than the more common Chinese.

If you don't have an &quot;assault weapon&quot; ban in your state yet, and neither
cost nor practicality is an issue, then consider a Thompson with a 100
round drum.  It is utterly ridiculous (loaded it weighs in at about
20lbs), but it has all the cosmetic naughtiness you can ask for.

An AK is the primary target of bans, but it's all cosmetics.  In that
caliber, an SKS is easier to handle and more accurate.  On the other hand,
there is something to be said for the argument that everybody should own
an AK with some 30rd mags just as a big &quot;f**k you&quot; to the gun banners.

I rest my case!  You have a lot of work to do with an SKS just to get to
something less than ordinary....even though I have as many as you do!  But,
it's still just a bullet-hose, not a rifle.....even though sometimes even a
bullet hose can be fun.  But it will NEVER perform to what I consider to be
basic rifle standards, and you can put all the lipstick and perfume on a pig
you want; the basic facts don't change.  If it's good enough to meet your
&quot;rifle&quot; standards, go for it.....but that doesn't alter the fact that it
doesn't meet mine, or a lot of other peoples (neither does a Mini-14).

BTW, $450 will buy you an M1 Garand from the CMP that IS a real rifle!

I would not say that the .308 is a lesser round.  In terms of energy,
the .30-'06 is better as it has a larger case capacity, but in terms
of accuracy, the .308 has the .30-'06 beat hands down.  So much more
accurate is the .308 that the DCM had to redraw the scoring rings to
cut down the number of perfect scores when the M14/M1As started to be
widely used.  The Navy would not have bothered to experiment with
various methods of converting M1 Garands to .308 if there was nothing
to be gained from it.

The Mini is not a bad rifle for it's intended use. It is a plinker NOT a
target rifle. We are talking 3 - 4 MOA accuracy. The big thing I have
found great with the Mini-14 is that it is reliable. I tinker with a lot
of different guns and the Mini-14 is a well made gun that is loose
enough to not jam but tight enough to shoot reasonably accurate. If you
ever do jam one (My 14 has not jammed but I jammed a newer one with
some garbage ammo) you just pound the bolt back with a block of wood and
voila! problem solved. Much like an SKS or AK47. I have jammed up
several AR15 variants and a couple M1 Garands and the M1 is not bad to
clear but the AR had me saying things I try to avoid in mixed company.
The Mini is reliable, relatively cheap if bought used, and from what I
have read, legal in all 50 states. It is also small and unassuming
looking with it's wood stock so it does not draw much attention. The
..223 round is also good enough to take deer sized game. My old (182
series) Mini will handle the heavier 69 gr bullets without issue. I'm
sure the newer ones can shoot the same heavier bullets.

And it's a &quot;Plinker&quot; that Ruger doesn't consider &quot;deficient in accuracy&quot;
until it's shooting worse than 6 MOA (which is worse than the pattern on my
shotgun!) that costs damn-near $600!  If that ain't &quot;bad&quot;, I'd hate to see
what your definition of bad actually looks like!  If all you wanna do is
make noise....buy firecrackers!
