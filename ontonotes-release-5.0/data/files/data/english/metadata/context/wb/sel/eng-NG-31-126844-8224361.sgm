If tyranny and oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise
of fighting a foreign enemy.
Of all the enemies to public liberty, war is perhaps the most to
be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other.
War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and
armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing
the many under the domination of the few.
The loss of liberty at home is to be charged to the provisions
against danger, real or imagined, from abroad.

Your/He's right...

We all just &quot;imagined&quot; Jet Airliners flying into Buildings on 9/11...

We also just &quot;imagined&quot; that SH invaded Kuwait in the early 1990's.

We just inagined that he has ignored 17 UN Resolutions regarding WMD's
in over a decade.

Our pilots were just &quot;imagining&quot; that they were being shot at while
patrolling a UN mandated no-fly zone that the Iraqi Government AGREED
to...

So I guess we all just have very acrtive imaginations is all?!?!?!?

Either that, or we are not all a bunch of Loonies who stick our head
in the sand and ignore all of the above mentioned REAL WORLD EVENTS
that REALLY HAPPENED!

Gaar

Gaar,

Mr. Madison said REAL or imagined. What are you complaining about? In
other words, our liberty is too precious to risk even in the face of
real danger. What don't you understand?

I put up a quote from James Madison who died in 1836.  A troll assumes
he was foreseeing Bush and Iraq and goes off on a rant.  Are you

That I'm not buying it, as far as the &quot;Real&quot; aspect goes...

I choose not to let others Declare War on my Country and just sit back

Fortunatley for me, we didn't have a Liberal President when such
actions were taken against us, so we did in fact REACT to such an
attack as an Act of War, rather than just a &quot;Bad Guy&quot; breaking the

You know better here.  There are plenty of other Boards where you can
just insult your opponent for making points, but that isn't here, and
you know it.

So if you are going to respond to a post in this Forum, you had better
make a POINT if you are also going to insult.

Gaar,

You doubt tha accuracy of the Madison quote? Or you simply don't
understand what it means?  Does anything in that quote suggest an lack
of desire to defend our country from foreign attack? You honestly
think that the one and only possible threat to our liberty is foreign
invasion? Please expand and clarify

So who do we &quot;attack&quot; when Terrorists attack us?

We have made the arguments for the War Ad Nauseum.

Quoting Madison is not going to change those arguments.

Do you really need to go over them again?

Do you think Madison ever imagined Terrorists attacking us in the
manner they did?

Do you even think he ever imagined Jet Airliners?

Kind of a silly thing to bring up if the man can't be brought to
defend such statements in light of current events.

You can't say he wouldn't have done exactly as Bush has, just as I
cannot say he would have.

What about the Events of 9/11 changing everything don't you

Gaar,

You really seem to have a hard time with concepts, ideas.

1) Apparantly you forget my main criticism of Bush's attack on Iraq.
Your right HOW DOES one pick out a COUNTRY to attack
massively in a conventional way when fighting terrorists? Shame
George Bush didn't think of that.

2)   And the arguements will continue, no time limit I know off. Deal.

3)  Not what i asked you.

4)  War and terror was not a new thing in Madison's time. Using
jetliners
was simply the delivery method, the goal of the attack was a old
as
war itself.

5)  The quote is there for all to see, no one is asking Madison to
defend it. I was asking if you understood it's meaning. The men
who wrote the Bible are no longer here to &quot;defend&quot; it. That
means
you cannot discuss it?

6)  You are actually going to sit there and parrot conservative
talking
points and slogans as a means of debate. &quot;What about 9/11
changing everything don't I understand&quot;. Are you joking, trying
to
be funny?

Merely a delivery system for biological warfare agents. That's what i

No we should discuss it, but neither side should take it to mean
anything it does not directly say...

I agree that not all threats need to be delt with by War, but that is
not to say that there are not times when such things are not
neccessary.

That you try to suggest that Madison was saying there are NO instances
where a Foreign threat should be delt with by War, is you making your
own assertions about such a thing.

You are going to need to show me where he ever said such a thing
outright.

You realize the quote offered does not say that, right?

By the way...  We Judge the Bible in a similar way.  It says certain
things, and often people, much like yourself, attempt to tell us that
those things &quot;mean&quot; something they do not directly assert.

Gaar

Gaar,

Damn Gaar, you twist and squirm like a worm on a hot sidewalk.

1. I gave you the quote precisely as written. YOU were the one that
conviently &quot;forgot&quot; to inclide the word &quot;real&quot;, but not &quot;imagined&quot;.

2. Where, in the name of God, did i say or imply there were never
times when war was necessary?

3.Again, where the did I say, or imply, there were NO situations where
foreign invasion should be answered with war?
SHOW me where I said or implied such foolishness.

&gt; That you try to suggest that Madison was saying there are NO instances

&gt; You are going to need to show me where he ever said such a thing

&gt; You realize the quote offered does not say that, right?

&gt; By the way...  We Judge the Bible in a similar way.  It says certain

&gt; those things &quot;mean&quot; something they do not directly assert.

Duck,

One question. If this &quot;war&quot; is so very vital to the security of our
country, it's very survival even, why is it being fought in such an
ineffective, corrupt and ineffecient manner? It's so vital that, at
least to some people here, criticizing or dissent is tantamount to
treason. And yet, while fighting it so stupidly, our political
&quot;leaders' publically announce that the most important item on their
political agenda is getting the Iraqi govt. to sign the new oil
treaty?
Regarding Mr. madison and the founding fathers complete inability to
even imagine such combatants as the Moslem terrorists. Nonesense,
these were well read, educated men. They were not innocents, unaware
of man's capacity for barbarism.

Well, Duck, you certainly seem to have a capacity for jumping to
conclusion without a trace of fact to back them up.  You have
absolutely no way of knowing how much I know about Madison.  I know I
have little admiration for him or any of those who tried to saddle us
with a virtually unlimited central government from the beginning.  I
do admire those who wrote the &quot;Anti-Federalist&quot; Papers because their
efforts got us the Bill of Rights which preserved a degree of freedom
for a time.

The battle of liberty vs. tyranny raged back and forth until the great
American dictator, Lincoln, started the ball rolling downhill for
good.  It took the Wilson administration to bring a final end to
liberty.

I'm not as certain as you are that Madison knew nothing of the
Assassins and the Old Man of the Mountain.  While their main power
base had been destroyed before the birth of the U.S., there are
historians that believe their cult continued to exists, possibly even
till today.

People often make the mistake of thinking that the Constitution was
meant to govern times.  These are the &quot;living Constitution&quot; people who
want the Constitution reinterpreted to suit themselves on any given
occasion.  You'll often hear them and their servile followers quoting
SCOTUS as if its pronouncements were the word of God.  The
Constitution was not meant to govern times it was meant to govern
people.  I don't think these are the exact words but, &quot;Let nothing
more be said of faith in man, but bind the rascals down by the chains
of the Constitution.&quot;

As far as such brutal factions not existing in his day, they have
probably existed as long as mankind.  Again, the Assassins and, of
course, the &quot;Vampire&quot; Dracula.  Have you concentrated so much on
Madison that you've neglected much of the world's history?

I don't know by what means you are able to enter the mind of a man
long dead and make the pronouncement that he could not have
anticipated the rise to power of the murderous madman Bush and his
&quot;Neo-Cons&quot; (The old McGovern liberals who flocked to the Republican
party and drove it so far to the left that the &quot;liberal&quot; Democrats are
America's &quot;Neo&quot;- Right Wing).  I have no idea what he might have
anticipated.

Caplis again misled about purported pre-war link between Iraq and Al
Qaeda
Summary: On his July 12 show, Dan Caplis of 630 KHOW-AM reiterated
misleading comments he had made days earlier about the 9-11 Commission
report's conclusions regarding the supposed link between Al Qaeda and
Iraq prior to the 2003 U.S. invasion. Caplis claimed the report found
that &quot;prior to 9-11 apparently Saddam Hussein was trying to lure Osama
bin Laden to Iraq to run his operations from Iraq,&quot; but Colorado Media
Matters found no such conclusion in the report and a 2006 Senate
Intelligence Committee report contradicts Caplis' claim.

For the second time in three days, 630 KHOW-AM co-host Dan Caplis
misled on a supposed pre-war link between Iraq and Al Qaeda, claiming
on July 12 that &quot;according to the 9-11 Commission report, and maybe
they're wrong -- prior to 9-11 apparently Saddam Hussein was trying to
lure Osama bin Laden to Iraq to run his operations from Iraq.&quot; Caplis
later referred to his assertion as a &quot;critical fact[] that you can't
rebut and contradict.&quot; Caplis made a similar claim on the July 10
broadcast of The Caplis &amp; Silverman Show when he said it was a
&quot;specific, absolute fact[] from the 9-11 report&quot; that &quot;Iraq was
inviting Al Qaeda, inviting bin Laden to set up operations in Iraq.&quot;

While the 2004 9-11 Commission report does state that &quot;meetings
between Iraqi officials and Bin Ladin or his aides may have occurred
in 1999&quot; and that &quot;[a]ccording to the reporting, Iraqi officials
offered Bin Ladin a safe haven in Iraq,&quot; Colorado Media Matters found
nothing in the report about Saddam Hussein trying to &quot;lure&quot; bin Laden
&quot;to Iraq to run his operations from Iraq.&quot; Furthermore, a 2006 Senate
Intelligence Committee report contradicted Caplis' assertion regarding
a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq, concluding that Saddam was
&quot;distrustful&quot; of Al Qaeda and repeatedly rebuffed Al Qaeda's requests
for support.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the July 12 broadcast of 630 KHOW-AM's The Caplis &amp; Silverman
">

Show:

CAPLIS: When you promise that you will not abandon a people after
you've entered their country and deposed their government, and you
then abandon them and you leave them to slaughter and you leave their
country to be run by terrorist warlords, guess what? Then you've lost
all credibility and all ability to deter governments from supporting
terrorists. But hey, let's squeeze some sense in.

SILVERMAN: Sounds like what we did in Vietnam.

CAPLIS: Yeah -- well, OK, let's go back to that. &quot;Sounds like what we
did in Vietnam.&quot; OK. First of all, did the Vietnamese strike us here
in America before we entered Vietnam?

SILVERMAN: No.

CAPLIS: Did, did the Viet --

SILVERMAN: But neither did the Iraqis.

CAPLIS: OK. Did, did the Viet Cong, did the Viet Cong -- well first of
all, Craig, prior to 9-11, prior -- according to the 9-11 Commission
report, and maybe they're wrong -- prior to 9-11 apparently Saddam
Hussein was trying to lure Osama bin Laden to Iraq to run his
operations from Iraq.

SILVERMAN: I'm --

CAPLIS: That's significant.

SILVERMAN: I'm just basing it on what George W. Bush has said and
acknowledged. That Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9-11.

CAPLIS: OK. So you don't want to address my facts; I respect it.

SILVERMAN: You don't want to address George W. Bush's obvious
statement. You know, Vietnam is more similar 'cause it was a civil
war. It's hard to step into the middle of a civil war. And we made
some bad decisions in Vietnam and, and it hurt the country. But it's
not going to destroy the country forever; we have to live to fight
another day. And Lord knows there will be further battles to fight.

CAPLIS: Listen, if you want to avoid my questions, just say so. I'm
asking you a logical, chronological series of questions and then you
try to blow smoke by diverting to something else. First of all, prior
to 9-11, according to the 9-11 Commission, Saddam Hussein was trying
to lure bin Laden to Iraq to set up operations. Prior to 9-11,
according to the 9-11 Commission report, Iraqi agents were working
with Al Qaeda outside of the airport in Kandahar to develop nerve gas
to be used to attack the United States of America. You cannot come up
with comparisons to the Viet Cong that match that. In addition,
obviously on 9-11 we were hit here in the United States by Al Qaeda.
We are now fighting Al Qaeda in Iraq. If we lose in Iraq, Al Qaeda is
gonna have Iraq as a base.

[...]

CAPLIS: These are critical facts that you can't rebut and contradict
your opinion on this. So, you can try to make light of it any way you
want to, but, but the facts are the facts.

It is not clear what Caplis was referring to, but the 9-11 Commission
report states that &quot;meetings between Iraqi officials and Bin Ladin or
his aides may have occurred in 1999&quot; and that &quot;[a]ccording to the
reporting, Iraqi officials offered Bin Ladin a safe haven in Iraq&quot;:

There is also evidence that around this time [1997] Bin Ladin sent out
a number of feelers to the Iraqi regime, offering some cooperation.
None are reported to have received a significant response. According
to one report, Saddam Hussein's efforts at this time to rebuild
relations with the Saudis and other Middle Eastern regimes led him to
stay clear of Bin Ladin.

In mid-1998, the situation reversed; it was Iraq that reportedly took
the initiative. In March 1998, after Bin Ladin's public fatwa against
the United States, two al Qaeda members reportedly went to Iraq to
meet with Iraqi intelligence. In July, an Iraqi delegation traveled to
Afghanistan to meet first with the Taliban and then with Bin Ladin.
Sources reported that one, or perhaps both, of these meetings was
apparently arranged through Bin Ladin's Egyptian deputy, Zawahiri, who
had ties of his own to the Iraqis. In 1998, Iraq was under
intensifying U.S. pressure, which culminated in a series of large air
attacks in December.

Similar meetings between Iraqi officials and Bin Ladin or his aides
may have occurred in 1999 during a period of some reported strains
with the Taliban. According to the reporting, Iraqi officials offered
Bin Ladin a safe haven in Iraq. Bin Ladin declined, apparently judging
that his circumstances in Afghanistan remained more favorable than the
Iraqi alternative. The reports describe friendly contacts and indicate
some common themes in both sides' hatred of the United States. But to
date we have seen no evidence that these or the earlier contacts ever
developed into a collaborative operational relationship. Nor have we
seen evidence indicating that Iraq cooperated with al Qaeda in
developing or carrying out any attacks against the United States.
[emphasis added]

Caplis did not inform his listeners that according to the September 8,
2006, Senate Intelligence Committee report, &quot;Postwar findings indicate
that Saddam Hussein was distrustful of al-Qa'ida and viewed Islamic
extremists as a threat to his regime, refusing all requests from al-
Qa'ida to provide material or operational support.&quot;

Similar to the 9-11 Commission, the Senate committee concluded that
there were instances &quot;in which al-Qa'ida communicated with
representatives of Saddam's regime,&quot; including a meeting between an
Iraqi intelligence officer and bin Laden in 1995, in which the officer
reportedly rebuffed the Al Qaeda leader's request for support.
Moreover, the committee also noted intelligence indicating that an Al
Qaeda operative traveled to Iraq in 1998 and 2002 to request a meeting
with Saddam, but was refused in both cases. The Senate committee
concluded:

Postwar findings have identified only one meeting between
representatives of al-Qa'ida and Saddam Hussein's regime reported in
prewar intelligence assessments. Postwar findings have identified two
occasions, not reported prior to the war, in which Saddam Hussein
rebuffed meeting requests from an al-Qa'ida operative. The
Intelligence Community has not found any other evidence of meetings
between al-Qa'ida and Iraq. Postwar information indicates there were
three instances in which al-Qa'ida communicated with representatives
of Saddam's regime, one of which had been identified by the
Intelligence Community prior to the war. All of the contacts were
initiated by al-Qa'ida. [emphasis in original]

As The Washington Post reported in a September 9, 2006, article about
the Senate report, &quot;Far from aligning himself with al-Qaeda and
Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Hussein repeatedly rebuffed
al-Qaeda's overtures and tried to capture Zarqawi, the report said.
Tariq Aziz, the detained former deputy prime minister, has told the
FBI that Hussein 'only expressed negative sentiments about [Osama] bin
Laden.' &quot;

Caplis misled on 9-11 Commission report
Summary: On his July 10 broadcast, Dan Caplis of 630 KHOW-AM made
numerous dubious and misleading statements about the report released
by the 9-11 Commission in 2004. Caplis described the report as
&quot;Democrat-leaning,&quot; despite the fact that the commission comprised an
equal number of Democrats and Republicans. He further claimed the
report showed that &quot;Iraq was inviting Al Qaeda ... to set up
operations in Iraq&quot;; Colorado Media Matters found no such conclusion,
and a Senate Intelligence Committee report contradicts Caplis'
assertion.

Discussing the 2004 9-11 Commission report on his July 10 broadcast,
Dan Caplis of 630 KHOW-AM misled about its findings, claiming the
