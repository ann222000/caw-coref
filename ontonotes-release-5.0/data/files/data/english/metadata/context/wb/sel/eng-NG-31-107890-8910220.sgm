Television: From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Television (often abbreviated to TV, T.V., or more recently, tv;
sometimes called telly, the tube, boob tube, or idiot box in British
English) is a widely used telecommunication system for broadcasting
and receiving moving pictures and sound over a distance. The term may
also be used to refer specifically to a television set, programming
or
television transmission. The word is derived from mixed Latin and
Greek roots, meaning &quot;far sight&quot;: Greek tele (τῆλε), far, and Latin
vision, sight (from video, vis- to see, or to view in the first
person).

Since it first became commercially available from the late 1930s, the
television set has become a common household communications device in
homes and institutions, particularly in the first world, as a source
of entertainment and news. Since the 1970s, video recordings on VCR
tapes and later, digital playback systems such as DVDs, have enabled
the television to be used to view recorded movies and other programs.

A television system may be made up of multiple components, so a
screen
which lacks an internal tuner to receive the broadcast signals is
called a monitor rather than a television. A television may be built
to receive different broadcast or video formats, such as high-
definition television, or preferably referred to as (HDTV). HDTV
costs
more that normal TV but is becoming more available.

The end of analog television broadcasting

NTSC
In North America, the basic signal standards since 1941 have been
compatible enough that even the oldest monochrome televisions can
still receive color broadcasts in 2007. However, the United States
Congress has passed a law which requires the cessation of all
conventional television broadcast signals by February 2009. If the
law
is not changed again, then after that date all NTSC standard
televisions, with analog-only tuners, will go dark unless fitted with
digital ATSC tuners, and the spectrum previously occupied by those
analog channels will be auctioned off by the United States' Federal
Communications Commission for other uses. The analog cut-off date has
been changed by Congress in the past.

PAL and SECAM
PAL and SECAM are expected not to be broadcast in Europe and Eurasia
by the mid-2020s. PAL-M may have a similar decommissioning timeline.

The European Union has recommended its members to have closed down
analogue terrestrial television by 2012. Luxembourg and the
Netherlands had already completed their closedowns in 2006, and
Finland and Sweden will have closed down their analogue broadcasts in
2007. Meanwhile, some countries may have difficulties making the 2012
deadline.

Britain started its programme of switching off analogue transmitters
in October 2007. At 2am on Wednesday 17 October 2007 the BBC2
transmitter covering the Whitehaven and Copeland areas (NW England)
was turned off. The remaining four analogue channels cease
broadcasting in the region on Wednesday 14 November. The original
five
channels will then only be available in digital form, alongside some
15 additional free to air channels.

televisions, with analog-only tuners, will go dark unless fitted with
digital ATSC tuners&quot;

Unless you are a cable or satellite subscriber (the vast majority of the US
population).

Sounds like Chicken Little is at it again.  Only those sets that rely solely on
antenna reception will go dark.   And not all of those will end up unusable.  Most
people in this group are smart enough to know how to use easily available cheap
modulators to get their NTSC sets working around the house, even their handheld
portables.

Sadly, I am in the minority that do not know how to do it; however, I am
willing to learn.  Perhaps someone will share their design so that those of
us without the design knowledge can use our assembly skills to build a unit.

I am betting that when the switchover to digital happens I will be
spending huge amounts of time with my in-laws TV. They refuse to get
cable and are among the very few folks I know who get TV off the air.

I bet it will be a complete surprise to them too. I have seen nothing
about this in any newspapers.

Oh, just you wait. Right after Christmas I bet you'll be seeing saturation
coverage of this event on TV and the newspapers. Watch for multiple feature
stories in your local paper.

What I'll be interested to see is the people who have the popular hookup of
the antenna going into a VCR and the VCR's RF-out into a TV. Straightforward
hookup, just put the converter between the antenna and the VCR. Until you
want to watch one show while taping another. Then you need another converter
and probably a switch box. That will be lots of fun to try to connect. These
people should just go digital.

What good is a modulator without an ATSC tuner? You still have to be able to
receive the digital signal.

Even easier, I just picked up a combination VCR and upscaling DVD
player with a built-in ATSC tuner.  Ran an amplified HDTV antenna into
its RF input and connected an HDMI cable from the VCR/DVD to the HDTV
(no built-in tuner).  I now have all local Washington and Baltimore
channels, both analog and digital HDTV.  It won't replace my DirecTV
DVR receiver with Tivo setup, but will at least let me receive
sporting events broadcast locally in HD.

Yes, see, you went digital. :) That's the smart way; I think those ATSC
VCR-DVDs are probably going to be a must-have accessory for those who get
their signals OTA and are stil reliant on videotape rather than moving to an
ATSC DVD-R or digital video recorder (Tivo). Those what think they're going
to pull this off with their older equipment and $20 converters are in for
some unpleasantness unless they don't mind not being able to tape one show
while watching a different one.

Since, I saw this in alt.culture.us.1970s also and it's spam for a

Do these units have RCA NTSC analog as well as HDMI outputs? If so, that
would be perfect for those who feel the need to meld the new with the old.
