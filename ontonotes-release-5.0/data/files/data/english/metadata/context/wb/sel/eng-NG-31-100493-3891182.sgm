Have a 92 Dodge W250. The throw out bearing is starting to go bad. Has
anyone here pulled the transmission and transfer case as a unit? How bad was
it? Would it be better to separate them?

Any hints would be appreciated.

Al, Dreading this. I may start going out for quotes.

I have never changed a cluctch on a Dodge, but I have on a Ford. If you
leave the transfer case bolted to the transmission, the transmission
becomes very hard to handle.  This is especially true when trying to
line up the input shaft of the tranny throgh the throw out and pilot
bearings. The weight of the transfer case make it hard to keep the
coupled pair hard to keep level and horizontal. It was very easy to R&amp;R
the transfer case.

Have you ever replaced a clutch before?

On my last transmission R&amp;R, I thought about it... for about 10 seconds
before realizing I was making more work for myself.  The driveshafts have to
come off anyway, so you're only talking 6 nuts to remove in order to yank
the transfer case.

Have a 92 Dodge W250. The throw out bearing is starting to go bad.

(Questions)

1)
Has anyone here pulled the transmission and transfer case as a unit?

2)
How bad was it?

3)
Would it be better to separate them?

Any hints would be appreciated.

Al, Dreading this. I may start going out for quotes.

=========
=========

Al,
answers to yer questions......

1)
I have pulled a hundred or so Mopop standards
4x4s.

2)
The first one caused a couple skint knuckles.......
the last one was a breeze....(2 days ago)

3)
as already stated by others in the thread......
YES....seperate the t-case from the tranny.

hints......???

pay somebody to do it.

You should be able to get the clutch set with
pilot, release bearing, and flywheel done for
around $600 at a tranny shop.  It'll be done
usually in one day.....and.......
WITH A WARRANTY.......and having the rear
seal and topcover resealed at the same time.

Nutt'ns quite a frustrate'n as get'n that big arse
assembly all back togeather.....
firing it up......
and ....."S C R E E E E E C H"......
someptins not rite...damn......gotta take it
back out.
(unless you payed someone to do it)

You can likely pick up the complete clutch set
for around $125 (give or take) for a high quality
set.  You need to figure in t-case fluid and tranny lube....bout another
$20.   Add for
rear seal and t-case gasket...bout another
$13.  Add on for a can of brake cleaner....
don't wanna stick an oilly flywheel back on
with a new clutch disk......bout $2.   Add for
having the flywheel machined.....don't wanna
have no clutch shudders.....bout $35.
Add for an engine oil filter and a quart of
motor oil......bout another $8.

so....not including "Go-Jo", and if you don't
use more than one can of brake cleaner,
and if you don't use silicone sealand on the
top cover, an if you don't drop it on yer chest
and have to run on down to the emergency
room for an x-ray........and you already got
grease for lubing everything back up.....
and you don't spend too much on beer fer
that buddy that's GOING TO HAVE TO
help you......

if figure if you do it yerself.........
AND DO IT RITE......
you should get out for around...$215 after
tax.....

unless of course.....something went wrong
and you have to pull it back out......
on yer back..........
with a tippsy floor jack....
(you do got a floor jack....don't yuh?)
(how bout yer buddy...he got one?)

Worst Case Scenerios....
(1)
The case halves could leak fluid after you bolt
the t-case back on....(because you listened
to a good buddy and used silicone sealer
instead of a gasket...like i told you to).

(2)
You end up with a gag-awfull shudder because
the flywheel looked good "To You"....so you
you scrimped and didn't have it machined.

3)
You get a growl or swak sound when letting
of the clutch when the trannies in gear.....
bcause you boogered up the pilot bushing
when you installed it.

4)
The pedal goes to the floor.....and no amount
of pumping it gets the tranny to shift without
grinding.....
(do a repost if this happens...we're in to deep
to quit now)

5)
You crack the bellhousing putting the tranny
back in when you tighten down on the bolts
because you tried to "pull" it up that last 1/2
inch or so.

6)
No ones around........
when the tranny falls off the jack on yer arm.

7)
You get it out..........
but screw that........
you're gonna eat crow and call somebody to
put it back in .......
cuz you show ain't gonna even try to do it
on yer back.....whe www....that tangs heavy.
($300 with the tow bill)

Suggestion.....
if you do decide to do the job, it's not rocket
science....it's common sense.  Jest set aside
one full day for the job...tell yourself your not
stopping till your finished and don't mess
around with it....."git'r done".
On the ground, with a floor jack, with a buddy,
you should be able to do the entire job in less
than 4 hours if you buy everything ahead of
time....that includes letting yer buddy run down
to the machine shop and waiting on the flywheel, while you're changing
the rear t-case seal, pilot bushing, sanding the input shaft,
putting a light coat of grease on the pilot shaft,
the inner collar of the release bearing, and putting a VERY light coat
on the inner collar
of the clutch disc and on the release prongs
on the preasure plate.
Sand the rust off the "dowl pins" that are sticking out the back of
the engine block,
they're for lining up the bellhousing.  Thick
arse coat of grease on these...and their mating holes in the
bellhousing. Not doing this "may"
cause probs sliding the unit back in.
Use a bronze pilot bushing....NOT a pilot
bearing...unless the bearing type is all you
can find.  Bronze bushings hold up better
than the bearing type.....and are less likely
to get boogered up when you pound them
in.
When using that plastic "line-up" tool that
comes in the clutch kit, hold up on it SLIGHTLY
while you tighten down the preasure plate.
Those things ain't precision and this will
save you bout 30 minutes of cussing when
you go to stab the tranny back in.
MAKE SURE......the bellhousing is FLUSH
with the engine when you tighten up the bell-housing bolts....DO NOT try
to pull
the tranny forward with the bolts.......EVER...
NEVER....EVER........unless you have to,
then be dang show you inch it forward and if
it ain't moving...stop trying and figure out whats
up. (maybe yer fergits to grease the dowl pins)

Taking it Out....

take the shifter out of the transmission....
remove the trim on the floorboard, inside the
cab, to get at it.

drain the t-case

drain the tranny

remove the engine oil filter

remove the bellhousing bolt that wouldn't
come out with the oil filter on.

remove the starter, and the threaded stud
that the bottom starter nut goes on.

remove the bellhousing bolt that was hidden
above the starter

remove the two tranny mount bolts and jack
the tranny up so that the tranny isn't sitting
it's weight down on the crossmember.

Take the crossmember bolts out .....beat,
pry, bang, and take the crossmember out.

It's pretty much common sense from there....

if you get a bolt that won't turn...whack it with
hammer and a punch. whack it...not tap it...
not bump it....whack it.
(keep this in mind on the driveshaft bolts
if they give you a prob)

and.....if you don't have access to a floor
jack (which is tricky as she-ite)...then do
a repost and I'll walk you through the
milk crate method....

one more thing.....
if you do it this saturday......
drag yer PC out under the truck with you.....

and if that tranny falls on yer arm.....

and yer buddy didn't show up like he promised.......

and no one comes when you start scream'n.....

do a repost and i'll quickly explain how to
an emergency amputation using a flat head
screwdriver and a pair of wire cutters....

Many times. I have a 4 post lift and a lot of time. Was just trying to get
some idea what I was looking at. May rent a transmission jack and just have
a go at it:)

Thanks to everyone that responded. The bearing first showed signs of a
problem around two years ago. Was noisy when I first started the truck, then
it shut up. Now it's really loud. I'm afraid it will lock up and really
start damaging things. The clutch is fine but I'll at least change the disk
while I'm in there. Can't help thinking the hydraulic clutch mechanism has
something to do with this.

Reminds me of something that happened many years ago. My friend had a Hemi
Coronet and the clutch disk split. So I was under the car removing the
transmission. Had everything loose but it would not budge, so I was under
the transmission pulling on the tail shaft and rocking it up and down. The
transmission jumped off the bell housing and fell right on my chest. The car
was not up very high and I could not get out from under the transmission and
I could not roll it off me. While I was suffocating somehow I got free. My
chest was sore for a month. That was my first MOPAR 4 speed extraction.
Before that most of what I worked on were Chevy's and they had toy 4 speeds.
Much later I pulled the transmission out of a 76 Volare, super six with the
overdrive transmission. One look at that thing reminded me of the Hemi.
Drilled four holes in the swivel plate on my floor jack and made an angle
iron frame to hold the transmission. It was no problem at all.

It's probably not, Al. All the "hydraulic clutch" does is replace the old,
bind-prone mechanical linkage between pedal and bellhousing.

However, an improperly bled hydraulic clutch can, when the system gets warm
from under the hood heat, hold pressure on a throwout bearing . . .just like
it would be if you rode the pedal.

None.

By design there is supposed to be a small fraction of a inch clearance. This
was seen in the mechanical systems as your pedal's "freeplay". When air is
left in the system the air can warm up and expand causing the fingers to
ride the bearing.

Ok, by what design? The master cylinder is above the slave cylinder. Gravity
would put some pressure on the slave cylinder. I don't see any way for the
slave to back off the throw out arm. On an old truck with mechanical
linkage, there are two springs to keep the throw out bearing off the
pressure plate fingers. And, when adjusted correctly, it works.

Had one that did that, in an old Chevy LUV...it's problem was an improperly
installed cup gasket...try being a tiny little twenty year old female and
getting *that* diagnosed...every mechanic in town just *knew* I was riding
the clutch...

After two clutches, I finally tore the hydraulics apart, figured it out,
fixed it, and got another 50,000 out of the last clutch and still going
strong when I sold it...;&gt;)

That was a '76...I bought a '78 years later, and it had a cable
linkage...hmmm, maybe I wasn't the only one that had fun with the things?

Al,

I can only speak in generalities of the design since I don't have exact
knowledge of your truck's design.

Some designs have springs, some don't. The same is true of the mechanical
linkages.

Now, if your truck has been apart before, then maybe someone left off the
springs. I don't know exactly.

Budd is correct, many times in a hydraulic clutch design, the throwout
bearing continues to ride lightly on the clutch fingers. It is assumed that
as long as the pressure is light (gravity feed of fluid is very light) it
will have little effect on th clutch.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; bind-prone mechanical linkage between pedal and bellhousing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, an improperly bled hydraulic clutch can, when the system gets

The slave does not back off the "throw out"

Why..??....because if it didn't .....
it would fall out the ball seat on the release
arm and when you stomped down on the
clutch pedal the rod would shoot out into
the bellhousing.....and the slave cylinder piston
would come blowing out.
Which would be a nasty thing and quite the
inconvenience to repair all the time.

A spring placed BEHIND the apply piston inside
the slave keeps the piston forward, pushing forward the apply rod,
against the release arm,
moving the release bearing forward on the
bearing retainer, which rides in contact with
the pressure plate......AT ALL TIMES, unless
the systems fubar'ed.

The spring tension of the Pressure Plate
works against the spring tension of the
Slave Cylinder apply piston.........

and....wah..lah......
no hydraulic pressure.....
Jest an ole timey mechanical spring and arm
set up........in a fancy package.

Can you figure out why the piston can move in and out at over 1500 rpms
without creating
hydr. pres. that would actually cause the clutch to apply?

&gt;transmission. Had everything loose but it would not budge, so I was under
&gt;the transmission pulling on the tail shaft and rocking it up and down. The
&gt;transmission jumped off the bell housing and fell right on my chest. The car
&gt;was not up very high and I could not get out from under the transmission and
&gt;I could not roll it off me. While I was suffocating somehow I got free. My
&gt;chest was sore for a month. That was my first MOPAR 4 speed extraction.
&gt;Before that most of what I worked on were Chevy's and they had toy 4 speeds.
&gt;Much later I pulled the transmission out of a 76 Volare, super six with the
&gt;overdrive transmission. One look at that thing reminded me of the Hemi.
&gt;Drilled four holes in the swivel plate on my floor jack and made an angle
&gt;iron frame to hold the transmission. It was no problem at all.

Al,
answers to yer questions......

1)
I have pulled a hundred or so Mopop standards
4x4s.

2)
The first one caused a couple skint knuckles.......
the last one was a breeze....(2 days ago)

3)
as already stated by others in the thread......
YES....seperate the t-case from the tranny.

(2)
You end up with a gag-awfull shudder because
the flywheel looked good "To You"....so you
you scrimped and didn't have it machined.

Very good description of all the work required, Marshy.  I am just a bit
curious about the need to have the flywheel resurfaced each time.  My reason
for this is that I used to have a '74 Ford 3/4 ton with an NP435? 4 speed in
it.  The first time I had to change the clutch, which was shortly after I
bought it with 115k on it, I found the flywheel had deep grooves in it from
the previous owner wearing the clutch down to the rivets.  I didn't bother
having the flywheel resurfaced. (young, no money, didn't care.)   I had no
shudder from the clutch due to the worn flywheel surface.  Over the years, I
did experience a couple of occasions when the clutch would shudder, but each
time on disassembly I found it was because a couple of springs on the clutch
plate itself had broken.  I beat the hell out of that truck, too.  I would
put a choker around a log in a log deck, hook it to the ball on the hitch,
put the truck in granny and give 'er the gas.  Sometimes the back end of the
truck would get jerked 3 feet to the side trying to get that log out.  I
have no doubt that this is what would damage the clutch plate.  In each
instance of shudder, I found the clutch plate itself had a couple of broken
springs, but the plate itself had very little wear on it.  I put another
135,000 hard miles in 16 years on that truck before I bought my '03 Dodge.
And the last time I changed the clutch on it, the grooves on the flywheel
had smoothed out to just light waves on the surface, and there was no
shudder.  Have things changed so much that a new surface on the flywheel is
critical to smooth operation of the clutch?  I can understand how a glazed
surface would contribute to clutch slippage, although that old flywheel had
almost a mirror sheen and was still just fine.  :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Budd was correct: Air in the line has an adverse effect on bearing release.
Air in itself can act as a spring, as it compresses nicely, and decompresses
just as well. Expansion and contraction due to heat is debatable, in that
the effects could vary from none to more than enough to cause the bearing to
wear more quickly than normal, depending on a circus full of variables.

Budd was correct: There should be a fraction of an inch of freeplay in a
mechanical system. In a hydraulic system, not so likely.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That means I'm entirely correct, since you agree completely with that
statement.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Assuming there is one, thats true. But there is not always a spring behind
the slave cylinder piston. Secondly, the sole purpose of that spring is to
be sure that the piston is fully extended to the clutch fingers at rest, so
only a single stroke of the clutch pedal is needed to release the clutch.
Its effects on wearing the throwout bearing are almost as negligible as that
of gravity on the throwout bearing.

As such, if you are saying it has any negative effect on the throwout
bearing, you are incorrect.

continues to ride lightly on the clutch fingers.

It is assumed that as long as the pressure is light (gravity feed of
fluid is very light) it will have little effect on th clutch.

You on the other hand...are only partially wrong.  The effects of

Ok, by what design?

The master cylinder is above the slave cylinder. Gravity would put some
pressure on the slave cylinder.

I don't see any way for the slave to back off the throw out arm.

On an old truck with mechanical linkage, there are two springs to keep
the throw out bearing off the pressure plate fingers. And, when adjusted
correctly, it works.

The slave does not back off the "throw out"
arm.  It stays in contact with it.
(Release Arm)

Why..??....because if it didn't .....
it would fall out the ball seat on the release
arm and when you stomped down on the
clutch pedal the rod would shoot out into
the bellhousing.....and the slave cylinder piston
would come blowing out.
Which would be a nasty thing and quite the
inconvenience to repair all the time.

ROTFLMBO!!! Got news for you, friend. There are many hydraulic pushrod /
socket arrangements that have slack in them . . .Ya just need a socket made
a little deeper or a soft rubber retainer to hold them together . . .look at
the brake pedal push rod if you need proof. And before you cackle again, the
hydraulic pressure on this rod is from the return springs on your braking
system pushing it back up after a brake application..

A spring placed BEHIND the apply piston inside
the slave keeps the piston forward, pushing forward the apply rod,
against the release arm,
moving the release bearing forward on the
bearing retainer, which rides in contact with
the pressure plate......AT ALL TIMES, unless
the systems fubar'ed.

That setup is wrong. The spring has to return the piston.

The spring tension of the Pressure Plate
works against the spring tension of the
Slave Cylinder apply piston.........

And your throwout bearing gets the bejesus worn out of it in short order.

and....wah..lah......

It's "voila!" (Fr) [Phonetic: v-wa-la], genius. oh, btw Miss Piggy doesn't
say it right.

no hydraulic pressure.....
Jest an ole timey mechanical spring and arm
set up........in a fancy package.

Bwah-ha-ha-ha!!!!!

Can you figure out why the piston can move in and out at over 1500 rpms
without creating
hydr. pres. that would actually cause the clutch to apply?

Uh, strokes, which are what a piston does are not measured in RPMs, but
strokes per (minute, second, day, year, millennium; pick one)

I am not sure that this is exactly what Budd either said or meant but if YOU
actually believe this Max, prove it because in reality, you are dead wrong.
There is no way in hell that an improperly bled system could cause excessive
wear to the bearing but it is highly probable to cause excessive wear to the
clutch.  I don't claim to be a hydraulics expert but there are some simple
facts that seem to be completely distorted.

First of all, gas, liquid and solids ALL expand to some degree when heated
with the difference being that liquids and solids apply EXTREME pressure
when any expansion occurs and gasses do not unless the expansion is
significant.  The reason why there is a slight gap required in a mechanical
clutch linkage is due to the possible expansion of the mechanical parts
partially engaging the clutch and causing excessive wear and slippage to the
clutch, not the bearing.  The return spring serves to stop the linkage from
rattling when in full release due to the required gap as much as anything
else.

As for gravity, the weight of the fluid is so insignificant in a 3/16 line
that I doubt that it could supply enough force to even move the clutch slave
cylinder at all, never mind move it with enough force to cause excessive
wear on the bearing.

Air in the system will also not cause the slave cylinder to move because if
it expands, all it will do is push the fluid back into the master cylinder
reservoir as at full release, the ports between the master cylinder and the
reservoir are open, pretty much just like the brake master cylinder.  It
does however, have the ability to cause excessive clutch wear because it
could prevent the clutch slave cylinder from moving enough to fully
disengage the clutch when required due to its compressibility.

As for the bearing wear, I would think that it goes through as much wear
sitting at a single traffic light while holding the clutch in as it does
with a year of wear with the light to non-existent pressure being placed on
it during normal driving when the clutch is fully engaged.  It sounds like
the OP simply has a bad bearing, possibly contaminated with dirt during
assembly causing excessive wear and premature failure.

Bearing design, metallurgy, even the lubricants used today are much

But if the rod is retained with a simple synthetic rubber ring in the socket

An improperly bled system has air in it. Air (any gas, be it air, or fluid
vapor) can expand and contract due to temperature, and thus can allpy a
small amount of pressure over designed pressure to the throwout bearing. In
addition, vapor will cause inadequate release of the clutch, and thus the
bearing will see much more use as the operator pumps up the system. Over
time, this will cause a higher wear rate. Thats a fact, and its all common
sense. If it wasn't true, there would be no reason to properly bleed the
clutch hydraulics.

Clutch wear can only be caused by the TO bearing being shoved against the
fingewrs of hte pressure plate. If you are going to claim that the clutch
will wear faster (and it will, no doubt) then the TO bearing will ALSO wear
faster. You seem to forget that for the clutch to slip, it needs something

&gt;&gt; throwout bearing wear. That is not only possible, its probable.

&gt; I am not sure that this is exactly what Budd either said or meant but if
&gt; YOU
&gt; actually believe this Max, prove it because in reality, you are dead
&gt; wrong.
&gt; There is no way in hell that an improperly bled system could cause
&gt; excessive
&gt; wear to the bearing but it is highly probable to cause excessive wear to
&gt; the
&gt; clutch.  I don't claim to be a hydraulics expert but there are some simple
&gt; facts that seem to be completely distorted.

&gt; First of all, gas, liquid and solids ALL expand to some degree when heated
&gt; with the difference being that liquids and solids apply EXTREME pressure
&gt; when any expansion occurs and gasses do not unless the expansion is
&gt; significant.  The reason why there is a slight gap required in a
&gt; mechanical
&gt; clutch linkage is due to the possible expansion of the mechanical parts
&gt; partially engaging the clutch and causing excessive wear and slippage to
&gt; the
&gt; clutch, not the bearing.  The return spring serves to stop the linkage
&gt; from
&gt; rattling when in full release due to the required gap as much as anything
&gt; else.

&gt; As for gravity, the weight of the fluid is so insignificant in a 3/16 line
&gt; that I doubt that it could supply enough force to even move the clutch
&gt; slave
&gt; cylinder at all, never mind move it with enough force to cause excessive
&gt; wear on the bearing.

&gt; Air in the system will also not cause the slave cylinder to move because
&gt; if
&gt; it expands, all it will do is push the fluid back into the master cylinder
&gt; reservoir as at full release, the ports between the master cylinder and
&gt; the
&gt; reservoir are open, pretty much just like the brake master cylinder.  It
&gt; does however, have the ability to cause excessive clutch wear because it
&gt; could prevent the clutch slave cylinder from moving enough to fully
&gt; disengage the clutch when required due to its compressibility.

&gt; As for the bearing wear, I would think that it goes through as much wear
&gt; sitting at a single traffic light while holding the clutch in as it does
&gt; with a year of wear with the light to non-existent pressure being placed
&gt; on
&gt; it during normal driving when the clutch is fully engaged.  It sounds like
&gt; the OP simply has a bad bearing, possibly contaminated with dirt during
&gt; assembly causing excessive wear and premature failure.

Very good description of all the work required, Marshy.

I am just a bit curious about the need to have the flywheel resurfaced
each time.

My reason for this is that I used to have a '74 Ford 3/4............

&lt;snip&gt;

...... the flywheel had deep grooves in it from the previous owner
wearing the clutch down to the rivets. I didn't bother having the
flywheel resurfaced. (young, no money, didn't care.)

I had no shudder from the clutch due to the worn flywheel surface.

Over the years, I did experience a couple of occasions when the clutch
would shudder, but each time on disassembly I found it was because a
couple of springs on the clutch plate itself had broken.

&lt;snip&gt;

Have things changed so much that a new surface on the flywheel is
critical to smooth operation of the clutch?

I can understand how a glazed surface would contribute to clutch
slippage, although that old flywheel had almost a mirror sheen and was
still just fine. :)

He's jest better off doing it......don't want

I can roundtrip that unit in an hour!!

He ain't gonna wanna touch again after fighting

so......

if......

HE.....thinks it's ok not to machine it, and HE
believes the time it takes HIM to get it back
out and back in again.......which i figure is
going to be a day and a half....lol.....then by
all means...save the $35 and take the risk.

I do all the time.
But.....like i said.....i'm a weeeee bit quicker

because, like I stated, you're NOT supposed

charge a customer for a flywheel if he don't

of HAVING to buy one.  Especially if they're
going through a lot of clutch's..for whatever
reason. (kids...overloading...yanki'n buddies

1)
No....clutch's ain't changed so much over the years.

2)
No...it's not an absolute that the flywheel has
to be machined on a clutch job.

3)
Normal proceedure calls for NOT refinishing

You on the other hand...are only partially wrong. The effects of gravity

Budd was correct: Air in the line has an adverse effect on bearing
release.

Air in itself can act as a spring, as it compresses nicely, and
decompresses just as well.

Expansion and contraction due to heat is debatable, in that the effects
could vary from none to more than enough to cause the bearing to wear
more quickly than normal, depending on a circus full of variables.

Budd was correct: There should be a fraction of an inch of freeplay in a
mechanical system. In a hydraulic system, not so likely.

That means I'm entirely correct, since you agree completely with that
statement.

(considering springs in slave cyl's.)
Assuming there is one, thats true.
But there is not always a spring behind the slave cylinder piston.

Secondly, the sole purpose of that spring is to be sure that the piston
is fully extended to the clutch fingers at rest, so only a single stroke
of the clutch pedal is needed to release the clutch. Its effects on
wearing the throwout bearing are almost as negligible as that of gravity
on the throwout bearing.

As such, if you are saying it has any negative effect on the throwout
bearing, you are incorrect.

Max,
you idiot........
you can add words, delete words, or even
rearrange the words in this thread....but,
the facts are the facts, perhaps you should
go back to the start of the thread and read
what you're commenting on.....

BECAUSE........

(#1)
master Budd...did not use the words "adverse
effect"!!!
What he DID say was that hot air could apply
the damn bearing.....WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE.
And....it's evident that you don't know that...
and also that you when yer reading...yer read'n
whut you want to...not what's written.

(#2)
I NEVER stated air did not, could not, or even
would not.....act as a spring....I would even
go far as to say that if it had been me...
I would have preffered the phrase.....
"Has a cushioning effect".....but that's jest me.
I don't liketo compare unlikes...air is not a spring after all........as
much as you may want it to be.

(#3)
As far as your little rant on expansion and
contraction.......there's nothing debatable
about the fact that hot air will NEVER apply
a release bearing in the vehical that is under consideration in this
thread..........unless yer willing to debate with idiots that think it
can.

(#4)
Budd DID NOT STATE......
"there should be a fraction of an inch freeplay
in a mechanical system"..............
Read the statement he made as many times
as you want ......but it still comes down to
this........what YOU are reading is not being
shown in this thread, and you are defending
statements that WERE NOT made and that
I did not argue against.  Though I am more than
willing to argue with you over the statements
that are posted that I find to be incorrect.
Budd posted that by design there should be
a fraction of an inch .......you took
the word "mechanical" and placed it in that statement.
Again...read the thread.
I thunk you'll see the conversation had turned
to one concerning HYDRAULIC systems, Budd
used the term mechanical in a following paragraph.

#5)
I did not say that the spring in the slave cylinder
had a negative effect on the release bearing.
I did not even infer that it did.
I did not even consider that it would.
I did not even imagine that some idiot would
read my post and somehow find a secret code
that my words appear to say that.

#6)
I know what I'm talking about....
You don't......
That's clear to me.....
But you don't believe me.....
That's okay by me.....
But do yerself a favor......retreat now...while
i'm still being kind and only calling you an
idiot instead of proving that yer one.

(MARSH replied)

The slave does not back off the "throw out" arm. It stays in contact
with it.
(Release Arm)

Why..??....because if it didn't .....
it would fall out the ball seat on the release arm and when you stomped
down on the
clutch pedal the rod would shoot out into the bellhousing.....and the
slave cylinder piston would come blowing out.
Which would be a nasty thing and quite the inconvenience to repair all
the time.

&lt;BUDD said)

ROTFLMBO!!! Got news for you, friend. There are many hydraulic pushrod /
socket arrangements that have slack in them . . .Ya just need a socket
made a little deeper or a soft rubber retainer to hold them together . .
look at the brake pedal push rod if you need proof .

And before you cackle again, the hydraulic pressure on this rod is from
the return springs on your braking system pushing it back up after a
brake application..

(MARSH said)

A spring placed BEHIND the apply piston inside the slave keeps the
piston forward, pushing forward the apply rod, against the release arm,
moving the release bearing forward on the bearing retainer, which rides
in contact with the pressure plate......AT ALL TIMES, unless the systems
fubar'ed.

&lt;BUDD says&gt;

That setup is wrong. The spring has to return the piston.

(MARSH stated))

The spring tension of the Pressure Plate works against the spring
tension of the
Slave Cylinder apply piston.........

&lt;BUDD said&gt;

And your throwout bearing gets the bejesus worn out of it in short
order.
and....wah..lah......
It's "voila!" (Fr) [Phonetic: v-wa-la], genius. oh, btw Miss Piggy

package.

&lt;BUDD cackled&gt;
Bwah-ha-ha-ha!!!!!

(MARSH asked)

Can you figure out why the piston can move in and out at over 1500 rpms
without creating
hydr. pres. that would actually cause the clutch to apply?

(BUDD said)

Uh, strokes, which are what a piston does are not measured in RPMs, but
strokes per (minute, second, day, year, millennium; pick one)

&lt;snip&gt;

Budd,

#1)
if you need to be adding sockets and rubber
to hold yer pushrods in.....then you shouldn't
be giving the OP advice on how to do a good
job...

#2)
we're are not discussing brakes...and if we
were.....could you please tell me where I
could find the return springs in my brake system that's causing
hydraulic pressure
to push the pedal back up...rotflmfao at
yer total ignorance of brake hydraulics
too.

#3)
now this ones tricky....cuz yer correct.....

The spring does return the piston....
jest as I STATED..........
but the for the life of me I can't figure out

Budd,
you have not ceased to amaze me at your
ability to prove yourself wrong without even
suspecting you're doing it.

(quoting you)
"Air expands when heated, most fluids do not"

lmao

1)
i did not say air would not expand when heated.

i DID say it compress's

i also DID say that brake fluid would not compress.
(please take note...there will be a quiz)

2)
i see you stated in open forum that...
(and i do quote)
"most fluids do not" expand.

could YOU......
maybe.....
possibly....
hopefully...

pull out of yer arse.....

jest one fluid that DOES expand when heated,

maybe one that applies to this thread.....??

go ahead...jest one..

i dare you....

NO DAMNITT.....not engine coolant!!!

rotflmao @ budd

3)
as previously stated, I AM aware that hot
air expands.....(jest look what you've done
to this thread with all yers)...and I am aware
of it's effects on balloons, though I am not sure
I learned it in third grade.

4)
I feel sure that you have'nt mastered the concept of hydraulic brake and
clutch systems yet......something that is learned in the 1st or
2nd year of apprenticeship as an auto tech......

rotflmao @ the small eng. tech / heav. trk tech.

but there are some simple facts that seem to be completely distorted.

First of all, gas, liquid and solids ALL expand to some degree when
heated with the difference being that liquids and solids apply EXTREME
pressure when any expansion occurs and gasses do not unless the
expansion is significant. The reason why there is a slight gap required
in a mechanical clutch linkage is due to the possible expansion of the
mechanical parts partially engaging the clutch and causing excessive
wear and slippage to the clutch, not the bearing. The return spring
serves to stop the linkage from rattling when in full release due to the
required gap as much as anything else.
As for gravity, the weight of the fluid is so insignificant in a 3/16
line that I doubt that it could supply enough force to even move the
clutch slave cylinder at all, never mind move it with enough force to
cause excessive wear on the bearing.

Air in the system will also not cause the slave cylinder to move because
if it expands, all it will do is push the fluid back into the master
cylinder reservoir as at full release, the ports between the master
cylinder and the reservoir are open, pretty much just like the brake
master cylinder. It does however, have the ability to cause excessive
clutch wear because it could prevent the clutch slave cylinder from
moving enough to fully disengage the clutch when required due to its
compressibility.

As for the bearing wear, I would think that it goes through as much wear
sitting at a single traffic light while holding the clutch in as it does
with a year of wear with the light to non-existent pressure being placed
on it during normal driving when the clutch is fully engaged. It sounds
like the OP simply has a bad bearing, possibly contaminated with dirt
during assembly causing excessive wear and premature failure.

W R O N G ! ! !   In order for the "expanding gas" to build any pressure at
all, it has to be in a CLOSED system and when the clutch pedal is fully
released, the system is WIDE OPEN"  Any expansion in the gas will do nothing
more than push fluid into the reservoir and a contraction will pull a little
out.  Either was, NO measurable change in applied pressure to the bearing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

LOL, as you say, that depends on where the gas is.  If it is in the slave
cylinder or in the line close to it, all the pumping in the world will have
little effect unless you can pump it really fast.  So fast in fact that the
slave never fully returns to its rest position and in that case, the
additional wear is minimal.

&gt; Clutch wear can only be caused by the TO bearing being shoved against the

&gt; will wear faster (and it will, no doubt) then the TO bearing will ALSO
wear
&gt; faster. You seem to forget that for the clutch to slip, it needs something
&gt; trying to disengage it, such as the TO bearing.
">

But is actuality,  if the pressure plate is not being moved far enough to
fully release the clutch disk, then the pressure being exerted by the TO
bearing will actually be LESS than it would if the system were operating
properly which would also cause LESS wear, not more on the TO bearing.  Now
if you think that air in the line will actually cause the clutch to slip
under full engagement and cause excess wear to the bearing, that you really
are an idiot.

&gt; is, as you imply, it'll do nothing to the slave cylinder. You are again
&gt; giving conflicting info and tripping yourself as you go. Typical.

Like I said, PURE RUBBISH.  Once the master cylinder begins to move, It
doesn't matter where the vapor is because it then becomes a closed system
and at that point, the gas will begin to compress and reduce the amount of
travel of the slave cylinder depending on the amount of gas trapped in the
system.  Now if you soemhow think that the effect will be different
depending on where the vapor is, please explain, I could use the laugh.

What's the matter Maxi, did I upset you again?  I don't need proof of this

suggestions are incorrect and many of them would have other symptoms such as
"pumping up the system" that the OP never made any claim to having.

&gt; No, Tom, it depends on the VOLUME of air left in the system. On hydraulic

of
&gt; hot air bend a 3&quot; exhaust pipe with a laminated wall 0.072&quot; thick . . .
.the
&gt; heat coming from an oil based fire below the cylinder.
">

I think that you are comparing two different systems.  The cylinder that you
are talking about was in a closed system which gave the building pressure no
where to go so it pushed the piston out with enough force to bend the pipe.
In a hydraulic clutch, when the pedal is fully released, it is effectively
an open system and any expansion of either gas or fluid will simply dump the
excess into the reservoir without building any pressure by design.

&gt; Yeah, the set-up man

with 30 years small engine expeirience i'm show not gonna argue clutch
BASICS with
you....

&lt;LOL&gt; Then you don't know small engines. Do you realize that a small, single
cylinder engine is harder to maintain than a V-10, proportionally speaking?
Why? Only one cylinder. If the engine isn't right, it won't run. Apply that
level of workmanship to a V-8 and watch it scream.

As for clutch basics . . . .want to talk about 12" dia. clutch / fluid
coupling R/R  as is needed by the Yale-Towne forklifts from the 40's to
60's, since they used a two speed forward / two speed reverse manual
transmission weighing a svelte 450 pounds and a fluid coupling / clutch
assembly that weighed 100 pounds (come on, line up the splines, buddy). Or
how about a 36" air operated multi-plate clutch used on a 300 ton smack
press?

Though i may continue to correct you when
you're wrong....specially as seing as you may
need to know it, being as you'se work'n on
all them heavy trucks and all.

Actually, forklifts were the primary equipment I repaired but that is only
one application of my hydraulics knowledge, and the cylinder that got hot
and bent the exhaust pipe was on a vertical Pines tubing bender (remember,
millwright journeyman?).

Now, if we could also get you to write like someone with the intelligence to

uh Budd,
you should use some of that intelligence, logic,

Uh, sorry, I'm stating that I will use regardless of idiots like yourself.

1)
Big AL was referring to slave cylinders...
as were You in the post he was referring
back to!!

Yep, but many items in the designs are common between master cylinders and
slave cylinders. One of the disadvantages to readily available over the
counter rebuilt parts is that people like yourself have never had the
enjoyment of reaming out a rusty cylinder and installing a rebuild kit then
reinstalling the cylinder.

2)
On hydraulic clutch systems (which is what
the thread has become about) the adjustable
push rod is on the master cylinder.....not on
the slave cylinder, and we have been discussing the slave
cylinder....and so have you.

Not all have the adjustment on the master cylinder end.

Most of the systems DO NOT incorporate an adjustable push rod at all.

MOST??? You still haven't given me, if no one else, any reason to believe
you even know which end your head is on.

so....that jest chunks one more kink in yer

Nope, just different systems than ones I've worked on.

they're easy to me, and it's easy to see,

because  Budd rearanged all the electrons in

the following is in Broadway script form...

Only because we're laughing at your deliberately poor English.

(MARSH replied)

The slave does not back off the "throw out" arm. It stays in contact
with it.
(Release Arm)

&lt;LOL&gt; So, how many ways can a link to a piston be connected?

Why..??....because if it didn't .....
it would fall out the ball seat on the release arm and when you stomped
down on the
clutch pedal the rod would shoot out into the bellhousing.....and the
slave cylinder piston would come blowing out.
Which would be a nasty thing and quite the inconvenience to repair all
the time.

Then you have not the knowledge you think you have.

&lt;BUDD said)

ROTFLMBO!!! Got news for you, friend. There are many hydraulic pushrod /
socket arrangements that have slack in them . . .Ya just need a socket
made a little deeper or a soft rubber retainer to hold them together . .
look at the brake pedal push rod if you need proof .

And before you cackle again, the hydraulic pressure on this rod is from
the return springs on your braking system pushing it back up after a
brake application..

(MARSH said)

A spring placed BEHIND the apply piston inside the slave keeps the
piston forward, pushing forward the apply rod, against the release arm,
moving the release bearing forward on the bearing retainer, which rides
in contact with the pressure plate......AT ALL TIMES, unless the systems
fubar'ed.

&lt;BUDD says&gt;

That setup is wrong. The spring has to return the piston.

(MARSH stated))

The spring tension of the Pressure Plate works against the spring
tension of the
Slave Cylinder apply piston.........

&lt;BUDD said&gt;

And your throwout bearing gets the bejesus worn out of it in short
order.
and....wah..lah......
It's "voila!" (Fr) [Phonetic: v-wa-la], genius. oh, btw Miss Piggy
doesn't say it right.

(MARSH SAID)
no hydraulic pressure.....
Jest an ole timey mechanical spring and arm set up........in a fancy
package.

&lt;BUDD cackled&gt;
Bwah-ha-ha-ha!!!!!

(MARSH asked)

Can you figure out why the piston can move in and out at over 1500 rpms
without creating
hydr. pres. that would actually cause the clutch to apply?

(BUDD said)

Uh, strokes, which are what a piston does are not measured in RPMs, but
strokes per (minute, second, day, year, millennium; pick one)

&lt;snip&gt;

=========
=========
Budd,

#1)
if you need to be adding sockets and rubber
to hold yer pushrods in.....then you shouldn't
be giving the OP advice on how to do a good
job...

Then you've never had a brake master cylinder off a 60's era car.

#2)
we're are not discussing brakes...and if we
were.....could you please tell me where I
could find the return springs in my brake system that's causing
hydraulic pressure
to push the pedal back up...rotflmfao at
yer total ignorance of brake hydraulics
too.

I see you've never had wheel cylinders apart either.

#3)
now this ones tricky....cuz yer correct.....

The spring does return the piston....
jest as I STATED..........
but the for the life of me I can't figure out
why you said the setup was wrong but then
in the next sentence confirmed what I said.
(must've been on the last glass of shroom
juice on that one ....aye?)

A spring can't push and pull at the same time.

#4)
for the last time you ignernt fool......
the release bearing RIDES ON THE FINGERS
of the pressure plate....that's a fact.....
and you rant'n on about a release bearing
get'n the "bejesus worn out of it in short order",
is not gonna change that fact!!!!

And the fingers keep that race turning and turning and . . .

we can debate why the bearing ain't wearing
out all the time if you like....but be advised...
I'm likely to come out ahead in the spitting
match....cuz i'm will'n to bet that i got a hell
of a lot better handle on a clutch system than
you do....

From what I've read, no, you don't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's not possible.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the clutch WILL NOT apply under any scenario
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resulting from an improperly bled system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Try reading what Budd said. He mentioned nothing about the clutch.
&gt; &gt; Simply
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said that an improperly bled system could result in faster than
normal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; throwout bearing wear. That is not only possible, its probable.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure that this is exactly what Budd either said or meant but
if
&gt; &gt; YOU
&gt; &gt; &gt; actually believe this Max, prove it because in reality, you are dead
&gt; &gt; wrong.
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no way in hell that an improperly bled system could cause
&gt; &gt; excessive
&gt; &gt; &gt; wear to the bearing but it is highly probable to cause excessive wear
to
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; clutch.  I don't claim to be a hydraulics expert but there are some
&gt; simple
&gt; &gt; &gt; facts that seem to be completely distorted.

&gt; &gt; No, Tom, it depends on the VOLUME of air left in the system. On
hydraulic
&gt; &gt; machinery in the muffler factory, I've seen a 3&quot; dia by 24&quot; cylinder
full
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; hot air bend a 3&quot; exhaust pipe with a laminated wall 0.072&quot; thick . . .
&gt; .the
&gt; &gt; heat coming from an oil based fire below the cylinder.

&gt; I think that you are comparing two different systems.  The cylinder that
you
&gt; are talking about was in a closed system which gave the building pressure
no
&gt; where to go so it pushed the piston out with enough force to bend the
pipe.
&gt; In a hydraulic clutch, when the pedal is fully released, it is effectively
&gt; an open system and any expansion of either gas or fluid will simply dump
the
&gt; excess into the reservoir without building any pressure by design.
">

On the Pines bender in the example, the pistons have orifices to allow the
wing die to follow the bending action. Pressure from the pump is applied to
both sides of the piston with the extend line having up 30% higher flow to
maintain contact with the pipe. In this example, the cylinder had been just
rebuilt and was being installed. The millwright left the job for lunch and
someone tossed a cigarette butt in the oily mess on the floor below the
cylinder. The cylinder was connected, but no oil had flowed yet in a systems
test.

I was the apprentice millwright on the job that day. When we heard the fire
alarm, we went to help put it out and that's when I saw the bent pipe. The
opposing wing die had not moved even though it is in parallel in the
hydraulic circuit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Yeah, the set-up man
&gt; &gt; lost his position because of poor housekeeping.

&gt; And if the fire was as unintentional as you make it sound, he should have.
">

He had been told repeatedly to clean up the mess of oil absorbent
(Petro-sorb) and dirt that he had tossed under the cylinder to catch the
drips from the worn shaft seals. Another employee walked by and tossed a
butt in the mess.

&gt; &gt; Then don't forget that all the power your engines make comes from coffee

&gt; While true, you are dealing with both combustion and a closed system,
&gt; neither of which exist in a hydraulic clutch at rest.

It can.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; First of all, gas, liquid and solids ALL expand to some degree when
&gt; heated
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the difference being that liquids and solids apply EXTREME
pressure
&gt; &gt; &gt; when any expansion occurs and gasses do not unless the expansion is
&gt; &gt; &gt; significant.  The reason why there is a slight gap required in a
&gt; &gt; mechanical
&gt; &gt; &gt; clutch linkage is due to the possible expansion of the mechanical
parts
&gt; &gt; &gt; partially engaging the clutch and causing excessive wear and slippage
to
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; clutch, not the bearing.  The return spring serves to stop the linkage
&gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; rattling when in full release due to the required gap as much as
&gt; anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; else.

&gt; &gt; And that's why there needs to be a gap on the hydraulic system,

&gt; If the hydraulic clutch master cylinder is functioning properly, no gap
will
&gt; be needed as any change due to expansion or contraction should be dealt
with
&gt; by pushing excess fluid or pulling required fluid from the reservoir in
the

&gt; &gt; &gt; As for gravity, the weight of the fluid is so insignificant in a 3/16
&gt; line
&gt; &gt; &gt; that I doubt that it could supply enough force to even move the clutch
&gt; &gt; slave
&gt; &gt; &gt; cylinder at all, never mind move it with enough force to cause
excessive
&gt; &gt; &gt; wear on the bearing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Air in the system will also not cause the slave cylinder to move
because
&gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; it expands, all it will do is push the fluid back into the master
&gt; cylinder
&gt; &gt; &gt; reservoir as at full release, the ports between the master cylinder
and
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; reservoir are open, pretty much just like the brake master cylinder.
It
&gt; &gt; &gt; does however, have the ability to cause excessive clutch wear because
it
&gt; &gt; &gt; could prevent the clutch slave cylinder from moving enough to fully
&gt; &gt; &gt; disengage the clutch when required due to its compressibility.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As for the bearing wear, I would think that it goes through as much
wear
&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting at a single traffic light while holding the clutch in as it
does
&gt; &gt; &gt; with a year of wear with the light to non-existent pressure being
placed
&gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; it during normal driving when the clutch is fully engaged.  It sounds
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; the OP simply has a bad bearing, possibly contaminated with dirt
during
&gt; &gt; &gt; assembly causing excessive wear and premature failure.

&gt; &gt; Now that could be a possibility.

&gt; I would think the most likely one but then again, not the only one.  The
OP
&gt; also didn't mention if he drives with his foot on the clutch pedal which
&gt; would as you indicated, also cause excessive wear of the TO bearing.

Ah, but would he admit it? I've caught many a forklift driver doing just
that but had them refuse to admit it.

I figured that the cylinder had to be empty or near empty to build up that
much pressure and like I thought, the system was closed allowing the
pressure to build up.

LOL, while the vehicle could catch on fire (the combustion part), no

Not likely since there is no closed end to allow pressure to build.

Once the master cylinder is in the retracted position the entire system is

&gt;&gt; An improperly bled system has air in it.

&gt; Duh, no shit.  Thanks for pointing this out.

&gt;&gt; Air (any gas, be it air, or fluid
&gt;&gt; vapor) can expand and contract due to temperature, and thus can allpy a
&gt;&gt; small amount of pressure over designed pressure to the throwout bearing.

&gt; W R O N G ! ! !   In order for the &quot;expanding gas&quot; to build any pressure

&gt; all, it has to be in a CLOSED system and when the clutch pedal is fully

&gt;&gt; In addition, vapor will cause inadequate release of the clutch, and thus
&gt; the

&gt;&gt; Over time, this will cause a higher wear rate. Thats a fact, and its all
&gt; common
&gt;&gt; sense.

&gt; Maybe in your world but for the rest of us in reality, it is pure BS.

&gt;&gt; If it wasn't true, there would be no reason to properly bleed the
&gt;&gt; clutch hydraulics.

&gt; Hahahaha, you are joking, right?!?!?

&gt;&gt; &gt; There is no way in hell that an improperly bled system could cause
&gt;&gt; &gt; excessive
&gt;&gt; &gt; wear to the bearing but it is highly probable to cause excessive wear
&gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; clutch.  I don't claim to be a hydraulics expert but there are some
&gt; simple
&gt;&gt; &gt; facts that seem to be completely distorted.

&gt;&gt; Clutch wear can only be caused by the TO bearing being shoved against the
&gt;&gt; fingewrs of hte pressure plate. If you are going to claim that the clutch
&gt;&gt; will wear faster (and it will, no doubt) then the TO bearing will ALSO
&gt; wear
&gt;&gt; faster. You seem to forget that for the clutch to slip, it needs
&gt;&gt; something
&gt;&gt; trying to disengage it, such as the TO bearing.

&gt; But is actuality,  if the pressure plate is not being moved far enough to
&gt; fully release the clutch disk, then the pressure being exerted by the TO
&gt; bearing will actually be LESS than it would if the system were operating
&gt; properly which would also cause LESS wear, not more on the TO bearing.
&gt; Now
&gt; if you think that air in the line will actually cause the clutch to slip
&gt; under full engagement and cause excess wear to the bearing, that you
&gt; really
&gt; are an idiot.

&gt;&gt; &gt; As for gravity, the weight of the fluid is so insignificant in a 3/16

&gt;&gt; &gt; that I doubt that it could supply enough force to even move the clutch
&gt;&gt; &gt; slave

&gt;&gt; &gt; excessive

&gt;&gt; Jeez, I think I said that already, try reading.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Air in the system will also not cause the slave cylinder to move
&gt;&gt; &gt; because
&gt;&gt; &gt; if

&gt;&gt; This assumes the air/vapor is in the line, not the slave cylinder.

&gt; LOL, it does no such thing.  It doesn't matter if the air is in the line
&gt; or
&gt; slave cylinder itself, the same thing will happen and if you don't think
&gt; so,
&gt; then you had better crack a few books.

&gt;&gt; &gt; does however, have the ability to cause excessive clutch wear because
&gt;&gt; &gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt; could prevent the clutch slave cylinder from moving enough to fully
&gt;&gt; &gt; disengage the clutch when required due to its compressibility.

&gt;&gt; Rubbish.

&gt; Yes, most of what you are saying is just that, rubbish.

&gt;&gt; If the vapor is in the line and heads up to the master cylinder, it
&gt;&gt; will have nothing to do with the slave cylinder position. Your facts are
&gt;&gt; correct about air/vapor in the line, but if that is the only place
&gt; air/vapor
&gt;&gt; is, as you imply, it'll do nothing to the slave cylinder. You are again
&gt;&gt; giving conflicting info and tripping yourself as you go. Typical.

&gt; Like I said, PURE RUBBISH.  Once the master cylinder begins to move, It
&gt; doesn't matter where the vapor is because it then becomes a closed system
&gt; and at that point, the gas will begin to compress and reduce the amount of
&gt; travel of the slave cylinder depending on the amount of gas trapped in the
&gt; system.  Now if you soemhow think that the effect will be different
&gt; depending on where the vapor is, please explain, I could use the laugh.

&gt;&gt; &gt; As for the bearing wear, I would think that it goes through as much
&gt;&gt; &gt; wear
&gt;&gt; &gt; sitting at a single traffic light while holding the clutch in as it
&gt;&gt; &gt; does
&gt;&gt; &gt; with a year of wear with the light to non-existent pressure being
&gt;&gt; &gt; placed
&gt;&gt; &gt; on
&gt;&gt; &gt; it during normal driving when the clutch is fully engaged.  It sounds
&gt; like
&gt;&gt; &gt; the OP simply has a bad bearing, possibly contaminated with dirt during
&gt;&gt; &gt; assembly causing excessive wear and premature failure.

&gt;&gt; You would think this, but you have no proof. Nor do I have proof
&gt; otherwise.
&gt;&gt; You are speculating, nothing more. We were simply listing reasons why a
&gt;&gt; TO
&gt;&gt; bearing might wear excessively. It could be that the TO bearing was
&gt;&gt; flawed
&gt;&gt; from the factory. Who knows.

&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I bet YOU do..... do tell.

&gt; What's the matter Maxi, did I upset you again?  I don't need proof of this
&gt; as I suggested that was the probable cause.  If it was a failure by design
&gt; as you suggest, it would be happening to most if not all of them and I
&gt; don't
&gt; recall seeing many if any other posts describing this problem and my TO
&gt; bearing has gone over 100,000 miles so far.  The problem is that all of
&gt; your
&gt; suggestions are incorrect and many of them would have other symptoms such
&gt; as
&gt; &quot;pumping up the system&quot; that the OP never made any claim to having.

John has described exactly why there is a problem (and there should be with
air in the system). If for whatever reason (and there are many reasons
between design and real life) the air does NOT travel back the the master
cylinder, it will be trapped when the MC travels past the port. If the air
is trapped, it doesn't matter where it is in the system, it will have a
negative effect on clutch operation.

Given the variation of designs, from automotive to industrial, air in a
hydraulic system can have a negative effect in almost any phase of
operation, depending on the system.

As such, we can now debate what amount of air, if that air has more or less
of an effect than the preload spring, if the preload spring is there or not,
and a myriad of other variables that can occur.

But one irrevocable fact remains: Air isn't supposed to be in the system.

So whether you think you are a clutch expert from the swamp, a wanna be
technician named after a cheap cut of beef, or simply an experienced
technician,  you have to bleed the system.

Well, John, I disagree, but then you weren't the one that bled the system
and restored the freeplay on that rented 20k pound forklift, were you?

The clue for me was that it got progressively worse as the drivetrain warmed
up.

One thing has to be remembered about anything made by human hands; it can do
things it isn't supposed to do.

&gt; &gt; None.

&gt; &gt; By design there is supposed to be a small fraction of a inch clearance.
&gt; &gt; This
&gt; &gt; was seen in the mechanical systems as your pedal's &quot;freeplay&quot;. When air
is
&gt; &gt; left in the system the air can warm up and expand causing the fingers to
&gt; &gt; ride the bearing.

&gt; Not likely since there is no closed end to allow pressure to build.

&gt; Once the master cylinder is in the retracted position the entire system is
&gt; open to the reservoir, any expansion of the fluid or entrapped air will
&gt; merely push that volume of fluid back into the reservoir. When the clutch
&gt; pedal is slightly depressed, the piston covers the MC port to prevent
&gt; pressure from back feeding into the reservoir.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's not possible.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the clutch WILL NOT apply under any scenario
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resulting from an improperly bled system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Try reading what Budd said. He mentioned nothing about the
clutch.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Simply
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said that an improperly bled system could result in faster than
&gt; &gt; normal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; throwout bearing wear. That is not only possible, its probable.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure that this is exactly what Budd either said or meant
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; YOU
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually believe this Max, prove it because in reality, you are
dead
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrong.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is no way in hell that an improperly bled system could cause
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excessive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wear to the bearing but it is highly probable to cause excessive
&gt; wear
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clutch.  I don't claim to be a hydraulics expert but there are
some
&gt; &gt; &gt; simple
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; facts that seem to be completely distorted.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, Tom, it depends on the VOLUME of air left in the system. On
&gt; &gt; hydraulic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; machinery in the muffler factory, I've seen a 3&quot; dia by 24&quot; cylinder
&gt; &gt; full
&gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hot air bend a 3&quot; exhaust pipe with a laminated wall 0.072&quot; thick .
.
&gt; .
&gt; &gt; &gt; .the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heat coming from an oil based fire below the cylinder.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think that you are comparing two different systems.  The cylinder
that
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; are talking about was in a closed system which gave the building
&gt; pressure
&gt; &gt; no
&gt; &gt; &gt; where to go so it pushed the piston out with enough force to bend the
&gt; &gt; pipe.
&gt; &gt; &gt; In a hydraulic clutch, when the pedal is fully released, it is
&gt; effectively
&gt; &gt; &gt; an open system and any expansion of either gas or fluid will simply
dump
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; excess into the reservoir without building any pressure by design.

&gt; &gt; On the Pines bender in the example, the pistons have orifices to allow
the
&gt; &gt; wing die to follow the bending action. Pressure from the pump is applied
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; both sides of the piston with the extend line having up 30% higher flow
to
&gt; &gt; maintain contact with the pipe. In this example, the cylinder had been
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; rebuilt and was being installed. The millwright left the job for lunch
and
&gt; &gt; someone tossed a cigarette butt in the oily mess on the floor below the
&gt; &gt; cylinder. The cylinder was connected, but no oil had flowed yet in a
&gt; systems
&gt; &gt; test.

&gt; I figured that the cylinder had to be empty or near empty to build up that
&gt; much pressure and like I thought, the system was closed allowing the
&gt; pressure to build up.
">

Tom, if equal pressure is applied on both sides of a piston, which way does
it move?

Now, again, there are flow controls in the circuit, the front and rear of
the piston are interconnected and the fire would have heated the retract
side of the piston first.

Come on, why did it do what it did?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I was the apprentice millwright on the job that day. When we heard the
&gt; fire
&gt; &gt; alarm, we went to help put it out and that's when I saw the bent pipe.
The
&gt; &gt; opposing wing die had not moved even though it is in parallel in the
&gt; &gt; hydraulic circuit.

&gt; Not seeing the system, I cannot make any valid comment on why it didn't
&gt; move.
">

But you have anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, the set-up man
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lost his position because of poor housekeeping.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And if the fire was as unintentional as you make it sound, he should
&gt; have.

&gt; &gt; He had been told repeatedly to clean up the mess of oil absorbent
&gt; &gt; (Petro-sorb) and dirt that he had tossed under the cylinder to catch the
&gt; &gt; drips from the worn shaft seals. Another employee walked by and tossed a
&gt; &gt; butt in the mess.

&gt; Well, in all honesty, the idiot that threw the butt should have also been
&gt; canned.
">

In today's environment, probably. That factory is now a non-smoking
establishment, even though the air is cloudy with oil smoke. Back then it
wasn't and the worst he could have been charged with was negligence with the
butt. The real problem was the oily mess.

&gt; &gt; &gt; While true, you are dealing with both combustion and a closed system,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First of all, gas, liquid and solids ALL expand to some degree
when
&gt; &gt; &gt; heated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with the difference being that liquids and solids apply EXTREME
&gt; &gt; pressure
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when any expansion occurs and gasses do not unless the expansion
is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; significant.  The reason why there is a slight gap required in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mechanical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clutch linkage is due to the possible expansion of the mechanical
&gt; &gt; parts
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; partially engaging the clutch and causing excessive wear and
&gt; slippage
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clutch, not the bearing.  The return spring serves to stop the
&gt; linkage
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rattling when in full release due to the required gap as much as
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And that's why there needs to be a gap on the hydraulic system,

&gt; &gt; &gt; If the hydraulic clutch master cylinder is functioning properly, no
gap
&gt; &gt; will
&gt; &gt; &gt; be needed as any change due to expansion or contraction should be
dealt
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; by pushing excess fluid or pulling required fluid from the reservoir
in
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; open at rest system.

&gt; &gt; Not in all systems.

&gt; Possibly not but in automotive systems this will be the case.  If you know
&gt; of a production automotive system that is different, please let me know.

Ok, How about forklift systems ( sorry, but technically, they are still
"automotive " systems), heavy truck, or our old 56 Plymouth wagon that had
an optional hydraulic operated clutch. It adjusted the same as mechanical
linkage, had a freeplay clearance of about 3/4".

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for gravity, the weight of the fluid is so insignificant in a

&gt; &gt; &gt; line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I doubt that it could supply enough force to even move the
&gt; clutch
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slave
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cylinder at all, never mind move it with enough force to cause
&gt; &gt; excessive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wear on the bearing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Air in the system will also not cause the slave cylinder to move
&gt; &gt; because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it expands, all it will do is push the fluid back into the master
&gt; &gt; &gt; cylinder
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reservoir as at full release, the ports between the master
cylinder
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reservoir are open, pretty much just like the brake master
cylinder.
&gt; &gt; It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does however, have the ability to cause excessive clutch wear
&gt; because
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could prevent the clutch slave cylinder from moving enough to
fully
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disengage the clutch when required due to its compressibility.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for the bearing wear, I would think that it goes through as
much
&gt; &gt; wear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting at a single traffic light while holding the clutch in as
it
&gt; &gt; does
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a year of wear with the light to non-existent pressure being
&gt; &gt; placed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it during normal driving when the clutch is fully engaged.  It
&gt; sounds
&gt; &gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the OP simply has a bad bearing, possibly contaminated with dirt
&gt; &gt; during
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assembly causing excessive wear and premature failure.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now that could be a possibility.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I would think the most likely one but then again, not the only one.
The
&gt; &gt; OP
&gt; &gt; &gt; also didn't mention if he drives with his foot on the clutch pedal
which
&gt; &gt; &gt; would as you indicated, also cause excessive wear of the TO bearing.

&gt; &gt; Ah, but would he admit it? I've caught many a forklift driver doing just
&gt; &gt; that but had them refuse to admit it.

&gt; LOL, most people would not and some don't even realize that they are doing

Just an FYI, Max, I HAVE seen a poorly bled system cause clutch slippage.The
forklift mentioned previously had been damaged in a transport accident (
fell off a semi and rolled down embankment near Indianapolis) and the
bellhousing broke along with the engine brackets, severe damages under the
floorboards.

The truck was enroute to the factory where I worked and it was three days
late arriving because of the repairs. It seems they rushed the fixes to keep
from losing a contract.

bearing.

&gt; This assumes a properly working system. If it has an air bubble in it, its
&gt; not working properly. The scenario you suggest implies that the system
will
&gt; bleed itself over time, which is simply not true in all cases.

&gt; &gt; LOL, as you say, that depends on where the gas is.  If it is in the
slave
&gt; &gt; cylinder or in the line close to it, all the pumping in the world will
&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; little effect unless you can pump it really fast.  So fast in fact that
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; slave never fully returns to its rest position and in that case, the
&gt; &gt; additional wear is minimal.

&gt; Except for the extended period of time for clutch release. which would add
&gt; to bearing wear.

&gt; &gt; But is actuality,  if the pressure plate is not being moved far enough
to
&gt; &gt; fully release the clutch disk, then the pressure being exerted by the TO
&gt; &gt; bearing will actually be LESS than it would if the system were operating
&gt; &gt; properly which would also cause LESS wear, not more on the TO bearing.

&gt; Wrong, particularly in the case of a diaphragm pressure plate, where the
&gt; load is higher at the beginning of clutch release than it is after full
&gt; release. BTW, most clutches now days are the diaphragm design.

&gt; &gt; Now
&gt; &gt; if you think that air in the line will actually cause the clutch to slip
&gt; &gt; under full engagement and cause excess wear to the bearing, that you
&gt; &gt; really
&gt; &gt; are an idiot.

&gt; Never said it would cause the clutch to slip under full engagement, and
&gt; specifically noted that it wouldn't.

&gt; &gt;&gt; An improperly bled system has air in it.

&gt; &gt; Duh, no shit.  Thanks for pointing this out.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Air (any gas, be it air, or fluid
&gt; &gt;&gt; vapor) can expand and contract due to temperature, and thus can apply a
&gt; &gt;&gt; small amount of pressure over designed pressure to the throwout
bearing.

&gt; &gt; W R O N G ! ! !   In order for the &quot;expanding gas&quot; to build any pressure
&gt; &gt; at
&gt; &gt; all, it has to be in a CLOSED system and when the clutch pedal is fully

&gt; &gt; little
&gt; &gt; out.  Either was, NO measurable change in applied pressure to the
bearing.

&gt; &gt;&gt; In addition, vapor will cause inadequate release of the clutch, and
thus
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; bearing will see much more use as the operator pumps up the system.

&gt; &gt; LOL, as you say, that depends on where the gas is.  If it is in the
slave
&gt; &gt; cylinder or in the line close to it, all the pumping in the world will
&gt; &gt; have

&gt; &gt;&gt; Over time, this will cause a higher wear rate. Thats a fact, and its
all
&gt; &gt; common
&gt; &gt;&gt; sense.

&gt; &gt; Maybe in your world but for the rest of us in reality, it is pure BS.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If it wasn't true, there would be no reason to properly bleed the
&gt; &gt;&gt; clutch hydraulics.

&gt; &gt; Hahahaha, you are joking, right?!?!?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There is no way in hell that an improperly bled system could cause
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; excessive
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wear to the bearing but it is highly probable to cause excessive wear
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; clutch.  I don't claim to be a hydraulics expert but there are some
&gt; &gt; simple
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; facts that seem to be completely distorted.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Clutch wear can only be caused by the TO bearing being shoved against
the
&gt; &gt;&gt; fingewrs of hte pressure plate. If you are going to claim that the
clutch
&gt; &gt;&gt; will wear faster (and it will, no doubt) then the TO bearing will ALSO
&gt; &gt; wear
&gt; &gt;&gt; faster. You seem to forget that for the clutch to slip, it needs
&gt; &gt;&gt; something
&gt; &gt;&gt; trying to disengage it, such as the TO bearing.

&gt; &gt; But is actuality,  if the pressure plate is not being moved far enough
to
&gt; &gt; fully release the clutch disk, then the pressure being exerted by the TO
&gt; &gt; bearing will actually be LESS than it would if the system were operating
&gt; &gt; properly which would also cause LESS wear, not more on the TO bearing.
&gt; &gt; Now
&gt; &gt; if you think that air in the line will actually cause the clutch to slip
&gt; &gt; under full engagement and cause excess wear to the bearing, that you
&gt; &gt; really
&gt; &gt; are an idiot.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As for gravity, the weight of the fluid is so insignificant in a 3/16
&gt; &gt; line
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that I doubt that it could supply enough force to even move the

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cylinder at all, never mind move it with enough force to cause
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; excessive
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wear on the bearing.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeez, I think I said that already, try reading.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Air in the system will also not cause the slave cylinder to move
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it expands, all it will do is push the fluid back into the master
&gt; &gt; cylinder
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reservoir as at full release, the ports between the master cylinder
and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reservoir are open, pretty much just like the brake master cylinder.

&gt; &gt;&gt; This assumes the air/vapor is in the line, not the slave cylinder.

&gt; &gt; LOL, it does no such thing.  It doesn't matter if the air is in the line
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; slave cylinder itself, the same thing will happen and if you don't think
&gt; &gt; so,
&gt; &gt; then you had better crack a few books.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; does however, have the ability to cause excessive clutch wear because
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; could prevent the clutch slave cylinder from moving enough to fully
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; disengage the clutch when required due to its compressibility.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Rubbish.

&gt; &gt; Yes, most of what you are saying is just that, rubbish.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If the vapor is in the line and heads up to the master cylinder, it
&gt; &gt;&gt; will have nothing to do with the slave cylinder position. Your facts
are
&gt; &gt;&gt; correct about air/vapor in the line, but if that is the only place
&gt; &gt; air/vapor
&gt; &gt;&gt; is, as you imply, it'll do nothing to the slave cylinder. You are again
&gt; &gt;&gt; giving conflicting info and tripping yourself as you go. Typical.

&gt; &gt; Like I said, PURE RUBBISH.  Once the master cylinder begins to move, It
&gt; &gt; doesn't matter where the vapor is because it then becomes a closed
system
&gt; &gt; and at that point, the gas will begin to compress and reduce the amount
of
&gt; &gt; travel of the slave cylinder depending on the amount of gas trapped in
the
&gt; &gt; system.  Now if you soemhow think that the effect will be different
&gt; &gt; depending on where the vapor is, please explain, I could use the laugh.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As for the bearing wear, I would think that it goes through as much
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wear
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sitting at a single traffic light while holding the clutch in as it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; does
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with a year of wear with the light to non-existent pressure being
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; placed
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it during normal driving when the clutch is fully engaged.  It sounds
&gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the OP simply has a bad bearing, possibly contaminated with dirt
during
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; assembly causing excessive wear and premature failure.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You would think this, but you have no proof. Nor do I have proof
&gt; &gt; otherwise.
&gt; &gt;&gt; You are speculating, nothing more. We were simply listing reasons why a
&gt; &gt;&gt; TO
&gt; &gt;&gt; bearing might wear excessively. It could be that the TO bearing was
&gt; &gt;&gt; flawed
&gt; &gt;&gt; from the factory. Who knows.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I bet YOU do..... do tell.

&gt; &gt; What's the matter Maxi, did I upset you again?  I don't need proof of
this
&gt; &gt; as I suggested that was the probable cause.  If it was a failure by
design
&gt; &gt; as you suggest, it would be happening to most if not all of them and I
&gt; &gt; don't
&gt; &gt; recall seeing many if any other posts describing this problem and my TO
&gt; &gt; bearing has gone over 100,000 miles so far.  The problem is that all of
&gt; &gt; your
&gt; &gt; suggestions are incorrect and many of them would have other symptoms
such
&gt; &gt; as
&gt; &gt; &quot;pumping up the system&quot; that the OP never made any claim to having.

&gt; &gt; &gt; On the Pines bender in the example, the pistons have orifices to allow

applied

&gt; &gt; &gt; someone tossed a cigarette butt in the oily mess on the floor below
the

&gt; &gt; I figured that the cylinder had to be empty or near empty to build up
that

It doesn't but who said that the pressure was equal?  The key word here Budd

Nope. The hydraulic pump applied pressure to the wing cylinders equally WHEN
IT WAS RUNNING. The fire happened while it was being changed over to bend a
different size / type of exhaust pipe.

The pump pressure line teed to each wing but the rest of the system from the
tee was still filled with hydraulic oil, just the one cylinder was empty.

Btw, bleeding that system  is a ten minute job . . .ten minutes of bending
cycles without pipe.

Uh, oh, Tom's going to blow.

Tom, before you do, it's been 30 some years since I dove under a forklift
floorboard and I don't remember brand / model / serial numbers for the exact
forklifts I repaired, but the big Yale rental comes to mind because I had to
fix it because the rental company's mechanic couldn't.

How did I learn how to fix it? When the other forklift mechanic, on first
shift, the guy with the wallpaper (diploma), couldn't get one system bled
out right, he still sent the truck back out for use. When I came in a few
hours later, the clutch was smoking on it from trapped air. Now how do I
know it wasn't a driver riding the clutch? That year of forklift could be
started in gear (1962 Yale 4000 cap) and the driver had a cast on his left
foot from having a horse step on it. He would shut the engine off to change
direction or use his right foot to work the clutch for inching. Now why was
he working with a broken foot? You would have had to work for that employer
to understand.

Btw, I used that stomping technique to train National Guard dump truck

Now, as I understand it, most of the trucks are automatics . . . .

Can't speak of forklifts but any automotive hydraulic clutch sysyem is open

So what? My comments were in rebuttal to Budd's claim that trapped air would

It is NOT the same system Budd and saying that it is just makes you look
foolish.  If what you say is true, then the only way that you could compress
a brake caliper piston back into it's bore would be to open up the brake
bleeder and we both know that you do not have to do that, it may be a good
idea, but not a requirement.  Nobody else in the group agrees with you here
on this point including Max so that alone should tell you something.

&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wing die to follow the bending action. Pressure from the pump is
&gt; &gt; applied
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both sides of the piston with the extend line having up 30% higher
&gt; &gt; flow
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maintain contact with the pipe. In this example, the cylinder had
&gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rebuilt and was being installed. The millwright left the job for
&gt; lunch
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone tossed a cigarette butt in the oily mess on the floor
below
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cylinder. The cylinder was connected, but no oil had flowed yet in
a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; systems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I figured that the cylinder had to be empty or near empty to build
up
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much pressure and like I thought, the system was closed allowing the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pressure to build up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Tom, if equal pressure is applied on both sides of a piston, which way
&gt; &gt; does
&gt; &gt; &gt; it move?

&gt; &gt; It doesn't but who said that the pressure was equal?  The key word here
&gt; Budd
&gt; &gt; is PRESSURE, something that WILL NOT happen in an open system.

&gt; But it's not an open system.

&gt;&gt; (sic) a
&gt;&gt; small amount of pressure over designed pressure to the throwout bearing.&quot;

&gt; Do you disagree that an improprerly bled system is working improperly? Do

Yes, I disagree that air in the system, when heated, will "apply more
pressure to the TO bearing". As I stated, the system is open to the
reservoir when the pedal is in the released position, therefore any pressure
buildup would merely push the fluid back into the reservoir rather than
"apply more pressure to the TO bearing".

My proof? A simple observation of the system design. The reservoir MUST be
exposed to the system when the pedal is up in order for the fluid to return;
this is true in both the brake and clutch hydraulic system. Unlike a
hydraulic brake system where the reservoir must replenish fluid as the
friction components wear, clutch disc wear results in the pressure plate
moving closer to the flywheel and the fingers in the pressure plate moving
closer to the TO bearing. If the system wasn't open to the reservoir the TO
bearing would be unable to displace the fluid as it moves away from the
fingers. Service manuals caution against overfilling the reservoir for this
very reason; an overfull reservoir would result in the phenomenom you
describe but overfull is not a normal condition.

It's pretty obvious that you know as little about clutch hydraulic systems
as you do about transmission hydraulics. Those "schools" you claim to have
attended failed to instill basic concepts that any high school auto shop
student learns.

If the phenomenon you describe did occur, there was something wrong in the
system other than the entrapped air.

Use your head, if you push the clutch pedal down part way and hold it there,
any expansion of the fluid (or entrapped air) could cause pressure to build
and alter the position of the TO bearing because the system is sealed as
soon as the MC piston moves far enough to close off  the reservoir port.

Once the pedal is returned to the UP position the fluid must be free to
return to the reservoir and since the return port is open when the pedal is
up, any expansion of the fluid/air will merely push the fluid into the
reservoir.

Anecdotal experiences that describe abnormal operation can only be the
result of abnormal conditions such as reservoir port obstruction.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Not likely since there is no closed end to allow pressure to build.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Once the master cylinder is in the retracted position the entire

Perhaps thats why, when finding such a situation, you check it for further

&gt; &gt;&gt; An improperly bled system has air in it. Air (any gas, be it air, or
&gt; &gt;&gt; fluid
&gt; &gt;&gt; vapor) can expand and contract due to temperature, and thus can allpy
&gt; &gt;&gt; (sic) a
&gt; &gt;&gt; small amount of pressure over designed pressure to the throwout
bearing.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Do you disagree that an improprerly bled system is working improperly?
Do
&gt; &gt; you have proof that an improperly bled system cannot apply more pressure
&gt; &gt; to a (in this case) static TO bearing?

&gt; Yes, I disagree that air in the system, when heated, will &quot;apply more
&gt; pressure to the TO bearing&quot;. As I stated, the system is open to the
&gt; reservoir when the pedal is in the released position, therefore any
pressure
&gt; buildup would merely push the fluid back into the reservoir rather than
&gt; &quot;apply more pressure to the TO bearing&quot;.

&gt; My proof? A simple observation of the system design. The reservoir MUST be
&gt; exposed to the system when the pedal is up in order for the fluid to
return;
&gt; this is true in both the brake and clutch hydraulic system. Unlike a
&gt; hydraulic brake system where the reservoir must replenish fluid as the
&gt; friction components wear, clutch disc wear results in the pressure plate
&gt; moving closer to the flywheel and the fingers in the pressure plate moving
&gt; closer to the TO bearing. If the system wasn't open to the reservoir the
TO
&gt; bearing would be unable to displace the fluid as it moves away from the
&gt; fingers. Service manuals caution against overfilling the reservoir for
this
&gt; very reason; an overfull reservoir would result in the phenomenom you
&gt; describe but overfull is not a normal condition.
">

Uh, John? The OP was concerned about bearing wear in a system that wasn't
"normal" . . . . For such systems, "normal" is a range of specs and
clearances to allow for SOME variations in operations. If the system is
already out of spec, then  . . . . . .

&gt; If the phenomenon you describe did occur, there was something wrong in the
&gt; system other than the entrapped air.
">

Really? What was your first clue? Maybe it was the bearing wear?

In function, they are the same. Heck, the earliest hydraulic brakes were
plagued with contamination probs because of the lack of residual pressure
valves.

A hydraulic clutch or braking system is nothing more than a pedal / master
cylinder / line(s) / slave (wheel cylinder / piston) setup. The only
difference is that lack of a common residual valve in the clutch system in
most applications.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Use your head, if you push the clutch pedal down part way and hold it
there,
&gt; any expansion of the fluid (or entrapped air) could cause pressure to
build
&gt; and alter the position of the TO bearing because the system is sealed as
&gt; soon as the MC piston moves far enough to close off  the reservoir port.
">

Yep, as in a pedal being ridden, a master piston not retracting completely,
a clogged port, a clogged cap vent, a pinched or plugged line, a flap of
rubber inside a flexible line,  . . .shall I go on? The system is defective,
so air can be the problem if not the whole problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Once the pedal is returned to the UP position the fluid must be free to
&gt; return to the reservoir and since the return port is open when the pedal
is
&gt; up, any expansion of the fluid/air will merely push the fluid into the
&gt; reservoir.
">

What if the port's plugged due to neglect, contamination or some other thing
not found in your manual?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anecdotal experiences that describe abnormal operation can only be the
&gt; result of abnormal conditions such as reservoir port obstruction.

AHA!!!!!! But that's only one scenario. How about the system that worked
fine until a hole wore in the metal line between the master and slave
cylinders, but a few days after the A.C.E. certified mechanic repaired it,
the clutch wouldn't engage?

I'll save you the effort . . .he had replaced the steel line with copper
tubing ( hey, it's not a brake system, right?) and chassis flex pinched it
shut while the pedal was down. All I did was replace it with steel line and
tighten a couple of frame to axle bolts and set it back out. In this case,
the steel would have eventually worn thru again, but it wouldn't have
crushed.

Outside your little book, ain't it? Btw, It took me a week to convince him
that the flexing had even existed . . . .I loosened the bolts, stuck a
twenty between the line and frame, jacked up the same side of the vehicle.
If he could pull the bill out without tearing, he would prove I was wrong
and could keep it.

I didn't lose my twenty.

First of all Budd, you DON'T KNOW what in the system is screwed up.  It

It could also be operator error or just excessive usage as we discussed.

If it did happen, then the problem is elsewhere, not the air that may be

Back pedaling again? Your claim was and has been that entrapped air alone

A failure of the pedal to release is an abnormal condition. Budd is claiming

Yet, not being able to see the device that Budd was working on, you're

Hell, I remember doing a clutch on a late 80's F250, 5spd built by Mazda,
had the concentric slave cylinder. Bleed procedure required vigorous pumping
"10-20 times". This step was to be repeated at least five times. After the
second round of pumping, the clutch was operable, but air was still in the
system. In this case, I suppose I could have waited a week for the air to
work its way to the top, if it would. Its an open system and yet, I doubt
after having bled it, that the air would have come out on its own.

I know thats an "open system", but I seriously doubt that the air in the
slave cylinder would have just worked its way out. Why? Well, interesting
that you migh ask that..... see, the BLEED valve is at the top of the
cylinder, so air comes out the bleeder first (wonderful how they think of
such things). The line from the master cylinder went into the lower side of
the slave cylinder, thus making it impossible for any air in the slave
cylinder to get out unless the system were bled.

Oddly enough (haha), I recall a bunch of hydraulic systems with the bleeder
at the top of the slave, and the feed line at the bottom of the slave
cylinder. Probably the same reason they put the bleeder on the top of a
caliper, or the top of a wheel cylinder, and feed it from the bottom. And
yeah, I know you'll say that the expansion should push the fluid back to out
the top. But the likelyhood of that happening while someone keeps operating
the master cylinder is minimal.

Yeah, its so unusual to have air trapped in a slave cylinder. Next time I
see it happen, I'll be sure to document it with all the pics I can get, and
have a notary certify my statements for you two.

I'd tell ya both to go back to school, but the proof is under the truck in
your respective driveways.

John,

Learn to read.

I said in one instance, the rented forklift, trapped air caused a bearing
problem,which indicates it can happen elsewhere.

I also stated that the perfect system only exists in text books.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, I disagree that air in the system, when heated, will &quot;apply more
&gt; &gt;&gt; pressure to the TO bearing&quot;. As I stated, the system is open to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; reservoir when the pedal is in the released position, therefore any
&gt; &gt;&gt; pressure buildup would merely push the fluid back into the reservoir
&gt; &gt;&gt; rather than &quot;apply more pressure to the TO bearing&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Thats terrific in a perfect world. What happens if the pedal doesn't
fully
&gt; &gt; release?

&gt; Back pedaling again? Your claim was and has been that entrapped air alone
&gt; will cause the TO bearing to apply even in an otherwise normal system.
&gt; A failure of the pedal to release is an abnormal condition. Budd is
claiming
&gt; that entrapped air alone caused the TO to apply and that a simple bleeding
&gt; cured the problem. If the pedal wasn't in the full up position and
bleeding
&gt; was used to cure the problem, the problem would recur; Budd claims it
&gt; didn't.

residual

for

&gt; &gt;&gt; If the phenomenon you describe did occur, there was something wrong in
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; system other than the entrapped air.

&gt; &gt; Really? What was your first clue? Maybe it was the bearing wear?

&gt; &gt; In function, they are the same. Heck, the earliest hydraulic brakes were
&gt; &gt; plagued with contamination probs because of the lack of residual
pressure
&gt; &gt; valves.

&gt; And one of the problems wasn't self-applying.
">

Yeah, they did, but since it's info from a man that worked as a mechanic on
them back then, you would question it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; A hydraulic clutch or braking system is nothing more than a pedal /
master
&gt; &gt; cylinder / line(s) / slave (wheel cylinder / piston) setup. The only

in
&gt; &gt; most applications.

&gt; Correct, and that lack of a RPV means ANY pressure buildup in the system
&gt; will be equalized in the reservoir.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is NOT the same system Budd and saying that it is just makes
you
&gt; &gt; look
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foolish.  If what you say is true, then the only way that you
could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compress
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a brake caliper piston back into it's bore would be to open up the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bleeder and we both know that you do not have to do that, it may
be
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; idea, but not a requirement.  Nobody else in the group agrees with
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on this point including Max so that alone should tell you
something.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The principles of operation are the same, Tom, and in basic design
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same.. Did you know that some HD clutch systems use a 2 pound
&gt; &gt; residual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; valve ( like a disk brake) to reduce the possibility of air / water
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contamination? It uses a slightly heavier return spring to
compensate
&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pressure.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And if the pressure exceeds this extra 2 pounds, this system will
STILL
&gt; &gt; vent
&gt; &gt; &gt; it off to the reservoir just like the ones without it so what is your
&gt; &gt; point?

&gt; &gt; The same as before, that the system is not a perfect system, it's
reality.
&gt; &gt; It's made by man not God.

&gt; LOL, you are kidding, right????  We are not talking cutting edge stuff
here
&gt; and it doesn't have to be &quot;perfect&quot; to work properly.

the

&gt; &gt; BTDT.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It could also be operator error or just excessive usage as we
discussed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe there is something else wrong with the system and if so, then
the
&gt; &gt; air
&gt; &gt; &gt; would again, not be the cause of the problem, it would be the
defective
&gt; &gt; &gt; component and the problem would exist whether there was air in it or
&gt; not.

&gt; &gt; Wrong, Tom. If the system is defective, air could be the problem since
AIR
&gt; &gt; IN THE SYSTEM IS A PROBLEM IF IT GETS INTO THE SYSTEM.

&gt; If the system was defective in a way that forced it into a fully closed
&gt; mode, the problem would still happen even if there were no air in the
system

design that replaced them.

It should be no surprise to you that those calipers were discontinued after
several (IIRC, 5) years. If they are working properly, they work fine for
one hard application. After that they have fluid vapor in them and don't
work properly until cooled. Fortunately, they were a less popular option,
and most cars in those years got drums. After 72, a larger single piston
caliper was used, and it worked far better.

Yeah, you have said exactly that, and yeah, I've seen it happen. Thats proof

&gt; Do
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you have proof that an improperly bled system cannot apply more
&gt; pressure
&gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a (in this case) static TO bearing?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you have proof that it can?  As you both know and are counting on,
&gt;&gt; &gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt; impossible to prove a negative but since you seem to be now making the
&gt;&gt; &gt; claim
&gt;&gt; &gt; that it can happen (a positive), how about backing it up.

&gt;&gt; Both Budd and I have seen cases where a hydraulic clutch system has
&gt; applied
&gt;&gt; the TO bearing due to an improperly bled system.

&gt; No, you didn't.  You saw a system that had other problems causing the TO
&gt; bearing to be applied due to expansion of the air in the system.

&gt;&gt; I've seen cases where the
&gt;&gt; master cylinder pushed air into the system, the slave cylinder sucked air
&gt;&gt; int othe system, and where they both leaked.

&gt; So what?  Who said that could not happen and what does it have to do with
&gt; air alone causing the TO bearing to be applied?

&gt;&gt; You deny that these systems
&gt;&gt; undergo reality based events by claiming what we've seen can't possibly
&gt;&gt; happen.

&gt; That is in no way what I said, spinmaster.  I said that air in the system
&gt; ALONE could not cause the TO to be applied.

&gt;&gt; You made the claim that its impossible, back it up.

&gt; Simple physics Maxi such as equal and opposit reactions.  The fluid or air
&gt; in the system cannot apply pressure to slave unless it can apply and
&gt; maintain equal pressure to the master and in an open system, it can't.

&gt;&gt; We've both merely suggested that odd things can happen despite what the
&gt; sytem design
&gt;&gt; may allow or safeguard against.

&gt; Could you possibly backspin any faster?

&gt;&gt; I don't have proof of many things that I've
&gt;&gt; seen, because I didn't sit there and say, &quot;a group of jackasses will ask
&gt; me
&gt;&gt; about this in the future, I better take pics, put arrows and circles on
&gt;&gt; them, document it, have it notorized, and hermetically seal it so it'll
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; fresh when I pull it out of the file cabinet.&quot;

&gt; Oh, LOL, I see, the people that don't agree with you are just a group of

&gt; them?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you know EVERY possible situation, problem, result, solution to a

&gt;&gt; &gt; Resorting to the law of infinite possibilities now, are we?  I must say
&gt;&gt; &gt; Max,
&gt;&gt; &gt; you do make me laugh.

&gt;&gt; Resortign to it? Hell, NATURE does it all the time, as do mechanical

&gt;&gt; I've seen things happen that I cannot figure out why a certain problem
&gt;&gt; caused it. I just know they are broken, so I fix it, and the odd event
&gt; goes
&gt;&gt; away.

&gt; If you don't know what caused it, then how exactly did you fix it?

&gt;&gt; Sadly, you seem to not have anywhere near the experience that a bunch of
&gt; us
&gt;&gt; do, so you don't understand how strange some problems are, and why those
&gt;&gt; problems cause really odd things to happen. Thats sad, because you liek

&gt;&gt; come off like you know all the possible problems, symptoms or solutions
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; any given situation. And like most humans, there is no way you could, you
&gt;&gt; just don't want to admit it.

&gt; Get real Max, the only one here afraid to admit to error or not knowing
&gt; between us is you.  I never claimed to know everything but in this case, I
&gt; do know that air in the system cannot in itself apply pressure to the TO
&gt; bearing.  If there are other problems, then it could be a contributing
&gt; factor to the TO being applied but that is it.

&gt;&gt; In this case, where you think you know all there is to know about
&gt; hydraulic
&gt;&gt; systems on vehicles, I know for sure you've never seen or tried to bleed
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; set of Kelsey-Hayes four piston calipers on an A-body Mopar. If you had,
&gt;&gt; you'd know that trapped air sometimes NEVER finds its way out. And yes,

&gt; Then I guess that these calipers could NEVER be used on an A-body Mopar

&gt; trapped air would expand due to the heat and lock the calipers, LOL.

Are these the same laws of physics that said helium was unaffected by

I never said that it was unaffected, I said that on the surface of this
planet, the force of gravity is negated by the force of the atmosphere
pushing it back up and therefore, it has no weight.  Perhaps I should have
said measurable weight but for that light conversation, it doesn't matter.
And you should be the last one to talk with your theory that an object in
freefall has no weight.  If it had no weight, it would not fall, pretty much
like
helium :-)

LOL, helium always has mass and that point cannot be argued but does it
always have weight?  By the following definition:
1. The quality of being heavy; that property of bodies by which they
tend toward the center of the earth; the effect of gravitative force,
especially when expressed in certain units or standards, as pounds, grams,
etc.

Lets break this down to its components

1. The quality of being heavy;

It is not heavy, actually, it is lighter than air.

that property of bodies by which they tend toward the center of the
earth;

It actually moves (is pushed) away from the earth

the effect of gravitative force,

Which is counteracted and negated by the forces of the atmosphere

especially when expressed in certain units or standards, as pounds,
grams, etc.

Find me a scale that can weight it without resorting to artificial
means such as containment or being in a vacuum.

Sounds like the point of weight can be debated to me but even at that,
the fact that you had to resort to a completely off topic argument just
shows that you are completely out of gas in your failing hydraulic argument
and I'll just claim my victory now.  Have a good day Maxi.

&gt; &gt; It is not what I say can or can't happen, it is the laws of physics, and

&gt; It's really funny, Tom, that you apply the &quot;It's physics&quot; claim yet have
&gt; denied it existed at other times.

Back to the unfounded accusations again?  Care to back this statement up?
This is degrading quickly and this time, it is not me doing it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes they do.  The equal and opposite reaction part.  Unless something is
resisting the system venting pressure to the reservoir, it cannot apply
pressure to the slave cylinder.

The difference here Budd is that this is an obvious attack that you just
admitted to (so much for your word).  I did not do this and I cannot help it
if you seem to still be a bit paranoid and are looking for me to attack you.
The funny thing about that is if you are really looking for it, you will
find it, even if it doesn't really exist and in reality Budd, when I did
attack you in the past, I was far from subtle about it so if I was attacking
you now....

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is NOT the same system Budd and saying that it is just makes
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; look
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foolish.  If what you say is true, then the only way that you
&gt; could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compress
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a brake caliper piston back into it's bore would be to open up
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; brake
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bleeder and we both know that you do not have to do that, it may
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; idea, but not a requirement.  Nobody else in the group agrees
with
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on this point including Max so that alone should tell you
&gt; something.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The principles of operation are the same, Tom, and in basic design
&gt; &gt; they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same.. Did you know that some HD clutch systems use a 2 pound
&gt; &gt; &gt; residual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; valve ( like a disk brake) to reduce the possibility of air /
water
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contamination? It uses a slightly heavier return spring to
&gt; compensate
&gt; &gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pressure.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if the pressure exceeds this extra 2 pounds, this system will
&gt; STILL
&gt; &gt; &gt; vent
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it off to the reservoir just like the ones without it so what is
your
&gt; &gt; &gt; point?

&gt; &gt; &gt; The same as before, that the system is not a perfect system, it's
&gt; reality.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's made by man not God.

&gt; &gt; LOL, you are kidding, right????  We are not talking cutting edge stuff
&gt; here
&gt; &gt; and it doesn't have to be &quot;perfect&quot; to work properly.

&gt; Now who's backpedaling? Not long ago, you weren't allowing for variances,
&gt; every system was exactly the same.

And you formulated this conclusion, how????????

It
&gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a perfect text book scenario, Tom.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First of all Budd, you DON'T KNOW what in the system is screwed up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And neither do you. The OP didn't say.

&gt; &gt; I never claimed to know but I do know that the TO bearing did not fail
due
&gt; &gt; to the design of the system as he suggested.

&gt; Agreed. There was a flaw somewhere between the pedal pad and the flywheel.

Exactly, and air in the system is not it, at least not it alone.  At best,
it could be a contributing factor and there was no claim by the OP that it
was there at all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be and probably is just a bad bearing and nothing more, it

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yep. Had a freshly rebuilt alternator freeze up in the parking lot at
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; parts store right after I had exchanged it for my defective one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; BTDT.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It could also be operator error or just excessive usage as we
&gt; discussed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe there is something else wrong with the system and if so, then
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; air
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would again, not be the cause of the problem, it would be the
&gt; defective
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; component and the problem would exist whether there was air in it or
&gt; &gt; not.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Wrong, Tom. If the system is defective, air could be the problem since
&gt; AIR
&gt; &gt; &gt; IN THE SYSTEM IS A PROBLEM IF IT GETS INTO THE SYSTEM.

&gt; &gt; If the system was defective in a way that forced it into a fully closed
&gt; &gt; mode, the problem would still happen even if there were no air in the
&gt; system
&gt; &gt; so the air itself is not the problem, only a contributing factor.

&gt; Which expands more when heated equal amounts: air or brake fluid?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out-of-hand for the simple reason that person is (older, grayer,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just because you are older does not mean that you know more and to

&gt; &gt; &gt; so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is foolish.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, Tom, being younger sure hasn't stopped you from thinking I'm
less
&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent, trained, experienced, skillful, ad nauseum than you in
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; past.

&gt; &gt; I am not all that much younger than you are Budd and in some things I do
&gt; &gt; know more than you but I never claimed to more about everything because
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; simply isn't true.  If you think that you really know more than I do
about
&gt; &gt; everything, then you are just being both ignorant and arrogant.

&gt; And what is your attitude saying about you? This comment of yours is very
&gt; arrogant in itself in that you presume to dress another person down.

It was not a comment Budd, it was more of a question.  Let me rephrase it
for you, do you really think that you know more about everything or even
everything mechanical  than I do?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; The fact you have admitted, in the past, to not having much experience

&gt; &gt; When did I say this and about what.  Sure, there are things that I don't
&gt; &gt; have a whole lot of experience with and the same goes for you.

&gt; Yep, for one, I've never given birth to a child. The problem is, Tom, that
&gt; you're unwilling to accept that another person could have more experience
/
&gt; knowledge than you. It didn't happen to you, it's not in the manual,
&gt; therefore it can't be true is the way you see things.

It is not just me, it is also John, Marsh Monster and flip flop Max.  There
is also nobody jumping in to say that I am wrong and as made obvious with
the re-introduction of the helium crap by Maxi and Tom, people in here don't
seem to waste the opportunity to try and tell me I'm wrong at the first
possible convenience.

still
&gt; &gt; don't work on vehicles.  Now I do it for myself and to help out a few
&gt; &gt; friends so the experiences still keep comming, just not as often.

&gt; As for your question about when you said how little experience you had,
just
&gt; go back a year or so to the time you screwed up how a differential works.
&gt; IIRC, it was stated by you that you had less than a year experience
working
&gt; as a tech.

LOL, where did you fabricate this from?  I don't recall ever arguing about
the operation of a diff and I knew how they worked since I was about 12
(basics Budd, not every possible design).  I was also in the business for a
few years, not months, and made enough money to put myself through school.
Does that mean that I know everything, of course not but if it makes you
feel better to think that, knock yourself out.  I would be careful with this
course however because if you get into an argument with me and I am right,
that will make you appear to know less than nothing.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a (in this case) static TO bearing?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have proof that it can?  As you both know and are counting
&gt; on,
&gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is

making
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; claim
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that it can happen (a positive), how about backing it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Both Budd and I have seen cases where a hydraulic clutch system has
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; applied
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the TO bearing due to an improperly bled system.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; No, you didn't.  You saw a system that had other problems causing the
&gt; TO
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bearing to be applied due to expansion of the air in the system.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've seen cases where the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; master cylinder pushed air into the system, the slave cylinder
sucked
&gt; &gt; &gt; air
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; int othe system, and where they both leaked.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So what?  Who said that could not happen and what does it have to do
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; air alone causing the TO bearing to be applied?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You deny that these systems
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; undergo reality based events by claiming what we've seen can't
&gt; possibly
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happen.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That is in no way what I said, spinmaster.  I said that air in the
&gt; system
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ALONE could not cause the TO to be applied.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You made the claim that its impossible, back it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Simple physics Maxi such as equal and opposit reactions.  The fluid
or
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; air
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in the system cannot apply pressure to slave unless it can apply and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; maintain equal pressure to the master and in an open system, it
can't.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We've both merely suggested that odd things can happen despite what
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sytem design
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; may allow or safeguard against.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Could you possibly backspin any faster?

&gt; it'll

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fresh when I pull it out of the file cabinet.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Oh, LOL, I see, the people that don't agree with you are just a group
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jackasses.  What vehicles did you see this happen to and how did you
&gt; fix
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; them?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do you know EVERY possible situation, problem, result, solution
to
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hydraulic system?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Resorting to the law of infinite possibilities now, are we?  I
must
&gt; &gt; &gt; say
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Max,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you do make me laugh.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Resortign to it? Hell, NATURE does it all the time, as do
mechanical
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've seen things happen that I cannot figure out why a certain
&gt; problem
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; caused it. I just know they are broken, so I fix it, and the odd
&gt; event
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; goes
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; away.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If you don't know what caused it, then how exactly did you fix it?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sadly, you seem to not have anywhere near the experience that a
bunch
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; us
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do, so you don't understand how strange some problems are, and why
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; those
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problems cause really odd things to happen. Thats sad, because you
&gt; liek
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; come off like you know all the possible problems, symptoms or
&gt; solutions
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; any given situation. And like most humans, there is no way you
could,
&gt; &gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just don't want to admit it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Get real Max, the only one here afraid to admit to error or not
knowing
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; between us is you.  I never claimed to know everything but in this
&gt; case,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; do know that air in the system cannot in itself apply pressure to the
&gt; TO
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bearing.  If there are other problems, then it could be a
contributing
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; factor to the TO being applied but that is it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In this case, where you think you know all there is to know about
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hydraulic
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; systems on vehicles, I know for sure you've never seen or tried to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bleed
&gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; set of Kelsey-Hayes four piston calipers on an A-body Mopar. If you
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you'd know that trapped air sometimes NEVER finds its way out. And
&gt; yes,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there is a reason for it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Then I guess that these calipers could NEVER be used on an A-body
Mopar
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; becuae according to you and Budd, you would not get very far before
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; trapped air would expand due to the heat and lock the calipers, LOL.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But hey, feel free to think that there are no problems beyond what
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; text
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; book and the FSM describe.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I said no such thing, spinmaster.  I simply said that trapped air
alone
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; could not cause a failure of the TO and nothing you have said yet
&gt; proves
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that wrong.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do you disagree that an improprerly bled system is working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; improperly?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you have proof that an improperly bled system cannot apply
more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pressure
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a (in this case) static TO bearing?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have proof that it can?  As you both know and are
counting
&gt; &gt; on,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; impossible to prove a negative but since you seem to be now
&gt; making
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; claim
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that it can happen (a positive), how about backing it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Both Budd and I have seen cases where a hydraulic clutch system
has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; applied
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the TO bearing due to an improperly bled system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; No, you didn't.  You saw a system that had other problems causing
the
&gt; &gt; TO
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bearing to be applied due to expansion of the air in the system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've seen cases where the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; master cylinder pushed air into the system, the slave cylinder
&gt; sucked
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; air
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; int othe system, and where they both leaked.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So what?  Who said that could not happen and what does it have to
do
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; air alone causing the TO bearing to be applied?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You deny that these systems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; undergo reality based events by claiming what we've seen can't
&gt; &gt; possibly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happen.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That is in no way what I said, spinmaster.  I said that air in the
&gt; &gt; system
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ALONE could not cause the TO to be applied.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You made the claim that its impossible, back it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Simple physics Maxi such as equal and opposit reactions.  The fluid
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; air
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in the system cannot apply pressure to slave unless it can apply
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; maintain equal pressure to the master and in an open system, it
&gt; can't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We've both merely suggested that odd things can happen despite
what
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sytem design
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; may allow or safeguard against.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Could you possibly backspin any faster?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't have proof of many things that I've

Once again, the trapped air, by itself, couldn't cause that problem; the
trapped air had to be in an otherwise malfunctioning system. If you are as

Your mistake was and still is claiming that bleeding air from the forklift
system "fixed" the problem. Since a malfunction other than air entrappment
had to exist, merely bleeding the system wouldn't eliminate the root
problem.

Wrong law of physics, Tom. Newton wasn't involved in this one, Bernoulli
was, pressure is exerted equally in all directions.

But here's one for you to explain: Robert Goddard is recognized as a
developer of modern rocketry, especially, liquid fuel rockets. In his early
experiments, the engines blew up, not the tanks, the engines. Now, since

Wrong, it's mass, and in a gravity well such as a planet surface a mass has
weight, is twice that, roughly, of Hydrogen.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do you disagree that an improprerly bled system is working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; improperly?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you have proof that an improperly bled system cannot apply
more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pressure
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a (in this case) static TO bearing?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have proof that it can?  As you both know and are
counting
&gt; &gt; on,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; impossible to prove a negative but since you seem to be now
&gt; making
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; claim
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that it can happen (a positive), how about backing it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Both Budd and I have seen cases where a hydraulic clutch system
has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; applied
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the TO bearing due to an improperly bled system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; No, you didn't.  You saw a system that had other problems causing
the
&gt; &gt; TO
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bearing to be applied due to expansion of the air in the system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've seen cases where the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; master cylinder pushed air into the system, the slave cylinder
&gt; sucked
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; air
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; int othe system, and where they both leaked.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So what?  Who said that could not happen and what does it have to
do
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; air alone causing the TO bearing to be applied?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You deny that these systems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; undergo reality based events by claiming what we've seen can't
&gt; &gt; possibly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happen.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That is in no way what I said, spinmaster.  I said that air in the
&gt; &gt; system
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ALONE could not cause the TO to be applied.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You made the claim that its impossible, back it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Simple physics Maxi such as equal and opposit reactions.  The fluid
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; air
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in the system cannot apply pressure to slave unless it can apply
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; maintain equal pressure to the master and in an open system, it
&gt; can't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We've both merely suggested that odd things can happen despite
what
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sytem design
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; may allow or safeguard against.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Could you possibly backspin any faster?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't have proof of many things that I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; seen, because I didn't sit there and say, &quot;a group of jackasses
&gt; will
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ask
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; me
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about this in the future, I better take pics, put arrows and
&gt; circles
&gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; them, document it, have it notorized, and hermetically seal it so
&gt; &gt; it'll
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fresh when I pull it out of the file cabinet.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Oh, LOL, I see, the people that don't agree with you are just a
group
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jackasses.  What vehicles did you see this happen to and how did
you
&gt; &gt; fix
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; them?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do you know EVERY possible situation, problem, result,
solution
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hydraulic system?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Resorting to the law of infinite possibilities now, are we?  I
&gt; must
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Max,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you do make me laugh.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Resortign to it? Hell, NATURE does it all the time, as do
&gt; mechanical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've seen things happen that I cannot figure out why a certain
&gt; &gt; problem
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; caused it. I just know they are broken, so I fix it, and the odd
&gt; &gt; event
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; goes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; away.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If you don't know what caused it, then how exactly did you fix it?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sadly, you seem to not have anywhere near the experience that a
&gt; bunch
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; us
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do, so you don't understand how strange some problems are, and
why
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; those
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problems cause really odd things to happen. Thats sad, because
you
&gt; &gt; liek
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; come off like you know all the possible problems, symptoms or
&gt; &gt; solutions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; any given situation. And like most humans, there is no way you
&gt; could,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just don't want to admit it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Get real Max, the only one here afraid to admit to error or not
&gt; knowing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; between us is you.  I never claimed to know everything but in this
&gt; &gt; case,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; do know that air in the system cannot in itself apply pressure to
the
&gt; &gt; TO
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bearing.  If there are other problems, then it could be a
&gt; contributing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; factor to the TO being applied but that is it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In this case, where you think you know all there is to know about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hydraulic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; systems on vehicles, I know for sure you've never seen or tried
to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bleed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; set of Kelsey-Hayes four piston calipers on an A-body Mopar. If
you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you'd know that trapped air sometimes NEVER finds its way out.
And
&gt; &gt; yes,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there is a reason for it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Then I guess that these calipers could NEVER be used on an A-body
&gt; Mopar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; becuae according to you and Budd, you would not get very far before
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; trapped air would expand due to the heat and lock the calipers,
LOL.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But hey, feel free to think that there are no problems beyond
what
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; text
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; book and the FSM describe.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I said no such thing, spinmaster.  I simply said that trapped air
&gt; alone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; could not cause a failure of the TO and nothing you have said yet
&gt; &gt; proves
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that wrong.

My brother's 12 foot yacht displaces a mass of water equal to it's weight,
165 pounds, therefore, it has no weight when on the lake?

The boat still masses and weighs 165 pounds on this planet because even out
in the middle of the lake it gravity attracts it.

Helium's mass is higher than that of Hydrogen, so it has weight in a gravity
well. Gravity, although minutely, attracts all masses together..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; LOL, helium always has mass and that point cannot be argued but does it
&gt; always have weight?  By the following definition:
&gt;       1. The quality of being heavy; that property of bodies by which they
&gt; tend toward the center of the earth; the effect of gravitative force,
&gt; especially when expressed in certain units or standards, as pounds, grams,
&gt; etc.

&gt; Lets break this down to its components

&gt;       1. The quality of being heavy;

&gt;       It is not heavy, actually, it is lighter than air.

&gt;        that property of bodies by which they tend toward the center of the
&gt; earth;

&gt;       It actually moves (is pushed) away from the earth

&gt;        the effect of gravitative force,

&gt;       Which is counteracted and negated by the forces of the atmosphere

&gt;        especially when expressed in certain units or standards, as pounds,
&gt; grams, etc.

&gt;       Find me a scale that can weight it without resorting to artificial
&gt; means such as containment or being in a vacuum.

&gt;       Sounds like the point of weight can be debated to me but even at
that,
&gt; the fact that you had to resort to a completely off topic argument just
&gt; shows that you are completely out of gas in your failing hydraulic
argument
&gt; and I'll just claim my victory now.  Have a good day Maxi.

&gt; &gt; John,

&gt; &gt; Learn to read.

&gt; &gt; I said in one instance, the rented forklift, trapped air caused a
bearing
&gt; &gt; problem,which indicates it can happen elsewhere.

&gt; Once again, the trapped air, by itself, couldn't cause that problem; the
&gt; trapped air had to be in an otherwise malfunctioning system. If you are as
&gt; knowledgeful of the system as you claim to be, you would realize entrapped
&gt; air could only cause a problem in a system whose return port was plugged.

And if you had been there you wouldn't be questioning my veracity. The fluid
was as clean as it was from the brake fluid container.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I also stated that the perfect system only exists in text books.

&gt; Bullshit!!! A system that works as advertised is by definition perfect
but,
&gt; if by your definition, a system has to be incapable of malfunctioning then
&gt; there is no perfect system.

Whatever. Your mind is closed tighter than a bear trap.

&gt; &gt; FYI,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that is not as normal an occurrence as many might think.

&gt; &gt;&gt; That's the gist of it, I don't think that anyone here denies that air
&gt; &gt;&gt; entrappment in an already plugged up system might cause the problems
you
&gt; &gt;&gt; claim but your original post and subsequent posts make no mention of
&gt; &gt;&gt; other
&gt; &gt;&gt; problems.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Go back and read the thread.

&gt; &gt; Don't have to. I remember what I said. My mistake was in forgetting that
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; everyone remembers this is life, reality, not some textbook.

&gt; Your mistake was and still is claiming that bleeding air from the forklift
&gt; system &quot;fixed&quot; the problem. Since a malfunction other than air entrappment
&gt; had to exist, merely bleeding the system wouldn't eliminate the root
&gt; problem.

Like I said and Scott has said, you weren't there, unless you were working

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's really funny, Tom, that you apply the &quot;It's physics&quot; claim yet
have
&gt; &gt; &gt; denied it existed at other times.

&gt; &gt; Back to the unfounded accusations again?  Care to back this statement
up?
&gt; &gt; This is degrading quickly and this time, it is not me doing it.

&gt; Tom, any time you put down a person's experiences or knowledge, you
degrade
&gt; them and you did it first.

Sorry, but no.  I didn't put you down in any way, I simply said that you
were wrong in this instance.  Now if you take that as a putdown, then there
is no point discussing anything with you because a childish attitude like
that is incapable of discussion.  But if we use your current definition of
things, I simply said that air alone could not cause the type of failure
that the OP said happened and I wasn't even responding to you, I was
responding to Max.  You then jumped in and made the claim that it could
happen and I was wrong using your forklift example, which by YOUR current
definition, put down my experience and knowlege so again, who did it first?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; And my statements do not violate the laws of physics.

&gt; &gt; Yes they do.  The equal and opposite reaction part.  Unless something is
&gt; &gt; resisting the system venting pressure to the reservoir, it cannot apply
&gt; &gt; pressure to the slave cylinder.

&gt; Wrong law of physics, Tom. Newton wasn't involved in this one, Bernoulli
&gt; was, pressure is exerted equally in all directions.
">

Ok, then if the master cylinder is operating properly, how would the
expanding gas build pressure on the master cylinder side?  Remember, the
pressure must be equal on all sides or it will flow toward the path with the
least resistance which means away from the slave and into the master.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But here's one for you to explain: Robert Goddard is recognized as a
&gt; developer of modern rocketry, especially, liquid fuel rockets. In his
early
&gt; experiments, the engines blew up, not the tanks, the engines. Now, since
&gt; there's this big old hole in the back, why did they blow up?
">

First of all, we are talking about explosive expansion here due to
combustion.  Do you really think that the gas is expanding that quickly or
with anywhere near that much volume in a hydraulic clutch assembly?????  I
hate to say this Budd but now you really are starting to make yourself sound
like an idiot and this is not a lame revenge insult, it is an honest opinion
and if you really think about it, you should see where I am comming from.
As for the rocket, do you not consider these early failures defective
engines and in the successful ones, what happens in the chamber the second
the fuel is cut off.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do you disagree that an improprerly bled system is working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; improperly?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you have proof that an improperly bled system cannot apply
&gt; more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pressure
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a (in this case) static TO bearing?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have proof that it can?  As you both know and are
&gt; counting
&gt; &gt; &gt; on,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; impossible to prove a negative but since you seem to be now
&gt; &gt; making
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; claim
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that it can happen (a positive), how about backing it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Both Budd and I have seen cases where a hydraulic clutch system
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; applied
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the TO bearing due to an improperly bled system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; No, you didn't.  You saw a system that had other problems causing
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; TO
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bearing to be applied due to expansion of the air in the system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've seen cases where the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; master cylinder pushed air into the system, the slave cylinder
&gt; &gt; sucked
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; air
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; int othe system, and where they both leaked.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So what?  Who said that could not happen and what does it have to
&gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; air alone causing the TO bearing to be applied?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You deny that these systems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; undergo reality based events by claiming what we've seen can't
&gt; &gt; &gt; possibly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happen.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That is in no way what I said, spinmaster.  I said that air in
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; system
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ALONE could not cause the TO to be applied.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You made the claim that its impossible, back it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Simple physics Maxi such as equal and opposit reactions.  The
fluid
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; air

&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; maintain equal pressure to the master and in an open system, it
&gt; &gt; can't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We've both merely suggested that odd things can happen despite
&gt; what
&gt; &gt; &gt; the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; may allow or safeguard against.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Could you possibly backspin any faster?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't have proof of many things that I've

&gt; &gt; mechanical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've seen things happen that I cannot figure out why a certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; caused it. I just know they are broken, so I fix it, and the
odd
&gt; &gt; &gt; event
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; goes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; away.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If you don't know what caused it, then how exactly did you fix
it?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sadly, you seem to not have anywhere near the experience that a
&gt; &gt; bunch
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; us
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do, so you don't understand how strange some problems are, and
&gt; why
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; those
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problems cause really odd things to happen. Thats sad, because
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; liek
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; come off like you know all the possible problems, symptoms or
&gt; &gt; &gt; solutions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; any given situation. And like most humans, there is no way you
&gt; &gt; could,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just don't want to admit it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Get real Max, the only one here afraid to admit to error or not
&gt; &gt; knowing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; between us is you.  I never claimed to know everything but in
this
&gt; &gt; &gt; case,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; do know that air in the system cannot in itself apply pressure to
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; TO
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bearing.  If there are other problems, then it could be a
&gt; &gt; contributing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; factor to the TO being applied but that is it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In this case, where you think you know all there is to know
about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hydraulic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; systems on vehicles, I know for sure you've never seen or tried
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bleed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; set of Kelsey-Hayes four piston calipers on an A-body Mopar. If
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you'd know that trapped air sometimes NEVER finds its way out.
&gt; And
&gt; &gt; &gt; yes,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there is a reason for it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Then I guess that these calipers could NEVER be used on an A-body
&gt; &gt; Mopar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; becuae according to you and Budd, you would not get very far
before
&gt; &gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; trapped air would expand due to the heat and lock the calipers,
&gt; LOL.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But hey, feel free to think that there are no problems beyond
&gt; what
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; text
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; book and the FSM describe.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I said no such thing, spinmaster.  I simply said that trapped air
&gt; &gt; alone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; could not cause a failure of the TO and nothing you have said yet
&gt; &gt; &gt; proves
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that wrong.

the boat will still have the same mass no matter where it is and once that

&gt; &gt; LOL, helium always has mass and that point cannot be argued but does it
&gt; &gt; always have weight?  By the following definition:
&gt; &gt;       1. The quality of being heavy; that property of bodies by which
they
&gt; &gt; tend toward the center of the earth; the effect of gravitative force,
&gt; &gt; especially when expressed in certain units or standards, as pounds,
grams,
&gt; &gt; etc.

&gt; &gt; Lets break this down to its components

&gt; &gt;       1. The quality of being heavy;

&gt; &gt;       It is not heavy, actually, it is lighter than air.

&gt; &gt;        that property of bodies by which they tend toward the center of
the
&gt; &gt; earth;

&gt; &gt;       It actually moves (is pushed) away from the earth

&gt; &gt;        the effect of gravitative force,

&gt; &gt;       Which is counteracted and negated by the forces of the atmosphere

&gt; &gt;        especially when expressed in certain units or standards, as
pounds,
&gt; &gt; grams, etc.

&gt; &gt;       Find me a scale that can weight it without resorting to artificial
&gt; &gt; means such as containment or being in a vacuum.

&gt; &gt;       Sounds like the point of weight can be debated to me but even at
&gt; that,
&gt; &gt; the fact that you had to resort to a completely off topic argument just
&gt; &gt; shows that you are completely out of gas in your failing hydraulic
&gt; argument
&gt; &gt; and I'll just claim my victory now.  Have a good day Maxi.

&gt; disengage the clutch. It will cause a slight application, which would wear
&gt; the TO bearing more than normal, and DOES wear these brakes faster than
the
&gt; design that replaced them.
">

But that makes no valid sense there Max.  If what you and Budd are saying is
valid then as they got warmer, they would apply pressure which would get
them warmer still causing them to apply even more pressure which would get
them warmer still which would cause them to apply even more pressure which
would get them warmer still.........   I think that the real problem is that
they could not be properly bled and as they warmed up the vapor would expand
and push more fluid out of them toward the master cylinder making the brakes
even more spongy and significantly reduce braking action which is simply
dangerous and had little to nothing to do with increased pad wear, LOL.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It should be no surprise to you that those calipers were discontinued
after
&gt; several (IIRC, 5) years. If they are working properly, they work fine for
&gt; one hard application. After that they have fluid vapor in them and don't
&gt; work properly until cooled. Fortunately, they were a less popular option,
&gt; and most cars in those years got drums. After 72, a larger single piston
&gt; caliper was used, and it worked far better.

I am sure that it did if they could be properly bled as they would not get
spongy when they warmed up.

&gt; &gt; I said no such thing, spinmaster.  I simply said that trapped air alone
&gt; &gt; could not cause a failure of the TO and nothing you have said yet proves
&gt; &gt; that wrong.

&gt; Yeah, you have said exactly that, and yeah, I've seen it happen. Thats
proof

Actually, you just think that you saw it but if you really did, please

No, Tom....  it falls because gravity acts upon it.  Gravity acts upon it
because it has MASS.  As I explained once before, you can calculate the
weight of an object under acceleration as follows:

Weight is the product of mass times (gravitational acceleration - the
acceleration of the mass).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sorry, we keep forgetting that if T-bone says it can't
happen
&gt; &gt; then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can't happen.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is not what I say can or can't happen, it is the laws of
physics,
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high school physics at that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's really funny, Tom, that you apply the &quot;It's physics&quot; claim yet
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denied it existed at other times.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Back to the unfounded accusations again?  Care to back this statement
&gt; up?
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is degrading quickly and this time, it is not me doing it.

&gt; &gt; Tom, any time you put down a person's experiences or knowledge, you
&gt; degrade
&gt; &gt; them and you did it first.

&gt; Sorry, but no.  I didn't put you down in any way, I simply said that you
&gt; were wrong in this instance.  Now if you take that as a putdown, then
there
&gt; is no point discussing anything with you because a childish attitude like
&gt; that is incapable of discussion.  But if we use your current definition of
&gt; things, I simply said that air alone could not cause the type of failure
&gt; that the OP said happened and I wasn't even responding to you, I was
&gt; responding to Max.  You then jumped in and made the claim that it could
&gt; happen and I was wrong using your forklift example, which by YOUR current

You did.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes they do.  The equal and opposite reaction part.  Unless something
is

apply
&gt; &gt; &gt; pressure to the slave cylinder.

&gt; &gt; Wrong law of physics, Tom. Newton wasn't involved in this one, Bernoulli
&gt; &gt; was, pressure is exerted equally in all directions.

&gt; Ok, then if the master cylinder is operating properly, how would the
&gt; expanding gas build pressure on the master cylinder side?  Remember, the
&gt; pressure must be equal on all sides or it will flow toward the path with
the
&gt; least resistance which means away from the slave and into the master.
">

Now here's what I was trying to show you and John, exactly, but you both
kept up with the arguments that I was wrong, unskilled, inexperienced and a
liar.

The system was a new rebuild; master, slave, line, fluid. The port was
uncovered, I could see it thru the new, crystal clear brake fluid and when
the pedal was pressed fluid escaped from it as indicated by the rippling of
the fluid surface.

And the system was causing slippage until I bled the air out . . .the only
work I did on it. No adjustments, no parts replacement other than a quart of
brake fluid.

Now, you figure it out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; But here's one for you to explain: Robert Goddard is recognized as a
&gt; &gt; developer of modern rocketry, especially, liquid fuel rockets. In his
&gt; early
&gt; &gt; experiments, the engines blew up, not the tanks, the engines. Now, since
&gt; &gt; there's this big old hole in the back, why did they blow up?

&gt; combustion.

And if you could see what I'm saying you wouldn't be insulting me. It's a

Goddard had the throat too small.

The point I'm trying to get thru to you, Tom, is that you claim that there's
no way air could cause clutch trouble, and I say there is. The rocket throws
your claim that as long as there is an exit, pressure cannot build up right
out in the trash.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that it can happen (a positive), how about backing it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Both Budd and I have seen cases where a hydraulic clutch
system
&gt; &gt; has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; applied
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the TO bearing due to an improperly bled system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; No, you didn't.  You saw a system that had other problems
causing
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TO
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bearing to be applied due to expansion of the air in the
system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've seen cases where the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; master cylinder pushed air into the system, the slave
cylinder
&gt; &gt; &gt; sucked
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; air
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; int othe system, and where they both leaked.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So what?  Who said that could not happen and what does it have
to
&gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; air alone causing the TO bearing to be applied?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You deny that these systems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; undergo reality based events by claiming what we've seen
can't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possibly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happen.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That is in no way what I said, spinmaster.  I said that air in
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ALONE could not cause the TO to be applied.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You made the claim that its impossible, back it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Simple physics Maxi such as equal and opposit reactions.  The
&gt; fluid
&gt; &gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; air
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in the system cannot apply pressure to slave unless it can
apply
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; maintain equal pressure to the master and in an open system, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; can't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We've both merely suggested that odd things can happen
despite
&gt; &gt; what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sytem design
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; may allow or safeguard against.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Could you possibly backspin any faster?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't have proof of many things that I've

&gt; &gt; &gt; circles
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; them, document it, have it notorized, and hermetically seal
it
&gt; so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it'll
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fresh when I pull it out of the file cabinet.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Oh, LOL, I see, the people that don't agree with you are just a
&gt; &gt; group
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jackasses.  What vehicles did you see this happen to and how
did
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fix
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; them?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do you know EVERY possible situation, problem, result,
&gt; &gt; solution
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hydraulic system?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Resorting to the law of infinite possibilities now, are we?
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; must
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Max,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you do make me laugh.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Resortign to it? Hell, NATURE does it all the time, as do
&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've seen things happen that I cannot figure out why a
certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; caused it. I just know they are broken, so I fix it, and the
&gt; odd
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; event
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; goes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; away.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If you don't know what caused it, then how exactly did you fix
&gt; it?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sadly, you seem to not have anywhere near the experience that
a
&gt; &gt; &gt; bunch
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; us
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do, so you don't understand how strange some problems are,
and
&gt; &gt; why
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; those
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problems cause really odd things to happen. Thats sad,
because
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liek
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; come off like you know all the possible problems, symptoms or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solutions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; any given situation. And like most humans, there is no way
you
&gt; &gt; &gt; could,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just don't want to admit it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Get real Max, the only one here afraid to admit to error or not
&gt; &gt; &gt; knowing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; between us is you.  I never claimed to know everything but in
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; do know that air in the system cannot in itself apply pressure
to
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TO
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bearing.  If there are other problems, then it could be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; contributing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; factor to the TO being applied but that is it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In this case, where you think you know all there is to know
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hydraulic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; systems on vehicles, I know for sure you've never seen or
tried
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bleed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; set of Kelsey-Hayes four piston calipers on an A-body Mopar.
If
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you'd know that trapped air sometimes NEVER finds its way
out.
&gt; &gt; And
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yes,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there is a reason for it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Then I guess that these calipers could NEVER be used on an
A-body
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mopar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; becuae according to you and Budd, you would not get very far
&gt; before
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; trapped air would expand due to the heat and lock the calipers,
&gt; &gt; LOL.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But hey, feel free to think that there are no problems beyond
&gt; &gt; what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; text
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; book and the FSM describe.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I said no such thing, spinmaster.  I simply said that trapped
air
&gt; &gt; &gt; alone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; could not cause a failure of the TO and nothing you have said
yet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proves
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that wrong.

Really? Don't go together, huh? You've weighed the boat? Tell us when you

And the thread hasn't finished yet, we both replied to it, right?

Now back to "mass" . . .so you do understand that Helium has mass and is

&gt; &gt; My brother's 12 foot yacht displaces a mass of water equal to it's
weight,
&gt; &gt; 165 pounds, therefore, it has no weight when on the lake?

&gt; &gt; The boat still masses and weighs 165 pounds on this planet because even
&gt; out
&gt; &gt; in the middle of the lake it gravity attracts it.

&gt; &gt; Helium's mass is higher than that of Hydrogen, so it has weight in a
&gt; gravity
&gt; &gt; well. Gravity, although minutely, attracts all masses together..

&gt; &gt; &gt; LOL, helium always has mass and that point cannot be argued but does
it
&gt; &gt; &gt; always have weight?  By the following definition:
&gt; &gt; &gt;       1. The quality of being heavy; that property of bodies by which
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; &gt; tend toward the center of the earth; the effect of gravitative force,
&gt; &gt; &gt; especially when expressed in certain units or standards, as pounds,
&gt; grams,
&gt; &gt; &gt; etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Lets break this down to its components

&gt; &gt; &gt;       1. The quality of being heavy;

&gt; &gt; &gt;       It is not heavy, actually, it is lighter than air.

&gt; &gt; &gt;        that property of bodies by which they tend toward the center of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; earth;

&gt; &gt; &gt;       It actually moves (is pushed) away from the earth

&gt; &gt; &gt;        the effect of gravitative force,

&gt; &gt; &gt;       Which is counteracted and negated by the forces of the
atmosphere

&gt; &gt; &gt;        especially when expressed in certain units or standards, as
&gt; pounds,
&gt; &gt; &gt; grams, etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt;       Find me a scale that can weight it without resorting to
artificial
&gt; &gt; &gt; means such as containment or being in a vacuum.

&gt; &gt; &gt;       Sounds like the point of weight can be debated to me but even at
&gt; &gt; that,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fact that you had to resort to a completely off topic argument
just
&gt; &gt; &gt; shows that you are completely out of gas in your failing hydraulic
&gt; &gt; argument
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I'll just claim my victory now.  Have a good day Maxi.

&gt;&gt; &gt; John,

&gt;&gt; &gt; Learn to read.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I said in one instance, the rented forklift, trapped air caused a
&gt; bearing
&gt;&gt; &gt; problem,which indicates it can happen elsewhere.

&gt;&gt; Once again, the trapped air, by itself, couldn't cause that problem; the
&gt;&gt; trapped air had to be in an otherwise malfunctioning system. If you are
&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt; knowledgeful of the system as you claim to be, you would realize
&gt;&gt; entrapped

&gt; And if you had been there you wouldn't be questioning my veracity.

Nope, but if I was I would probably have seen what else you unknowingly did
besides bleeding to "fix" the problem.

Look back on this forum to the gent who experienced late upshifts after a
simple band adjustment. Those of us who understand transmission function
realize that bands don't have anything to do with the road speed at which
upshifts occur. The respondent correctly opined that, in the process of band
adjustment, the TV cable adjustment must have been altered.

Just like in your anecdotal account, it's as easy to suspect the band
adjustment was the culprit as your suspicion that entrapped air was the sole
problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, John, you admitted you weren't there, so you couldn't have seen the
care I took or the time I spent flushing out the air. Yet you presume to
think you know exactly what happened.

Fine. Just call me a liar and kill file me.

Since I don't agree with you politically or religiously, I believe in
fantasies???? . . .I could say the same about you.

Nevertheless, you've implied I'm lying and won't come right out and say it.

John, I know what fantasies are, I know what is fact and what is fiction, I
know what fixed that forklift and you don't because you were not there.

The fantasy is that you claim you know what was wrong with it without seeing
the vehicle.

And the sigline stays because it is not fantasy, it's the good old-fashioned
values that this country was founded on.

It happens sometimes.  Other weird things happen to me too.  When I've

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sorry, we keep forgetting that if T-bone says it can't
&gt; happen
&gt; &gt; &gt; then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can't happen.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is not what I say can or can't happen, it is the laws of
&gt; physics,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high school physics at that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's really funny, Tom, that you apply the &quot;It's physics&quot; claim
yet
&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denied it existed at other times.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Back to the unfounded accusations again?  Care to back this
statement
&gt; &gt; up?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is degrading quickly and this time, it is not me doing it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Tom, any time you put down a person's experiences or knowledge, you
&gt; &gt; degrade
&gt; &gt; &gt; them and you did it first.

&gt; &gt; Sorry, but no.  I didn't put you down in any way, I simply said that you
&gt; &gt; were wrong in this instance.  Now if you take that as a putdown, then
&gt; there
&gt; &gt; is no point discussing anything with you because a childish attitude
like
&gt; &gt; that is incapable of discussion.  But if we use your current definition
of
&gt; &gt; things, I simply said that air alone could not cause the type of failure
&gt; &gt; that the OP said happened and I wasn't even responding to you, I was
&gt; &gt; responding to Max.  You then jumped in and made the claim that it could
&gt; &gt; happen and I was wrong using your forklift example, which by YOUR
current
&gt; &gt; definition, put down my experience and knowlege so again, who did it
&gt; first?

&gt; You did.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And my statements do not violate the laws of physics.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes they do.  The equal and opposite reaction part.  Unless
something
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resisting the system venting pressure to the reservoir, it cannot
&gt; apply
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pressure to the slave cylinder.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Wrong law of physics, Tom. Newton wasn't involved in this one,
Bernoulli
&gt; &gt; &gt; was, pressure is exerted equally in all directions.

&gt; &gt; Ok, then if the master cylinder is operating properly, how would the
&gt; &gt; expanding gas build pressure on the master cylinder side?  Remember, the
&gt; &gt; pressure must be equal on all sides or it will flow toward the path with
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; least resistance which means away from the slave and into the master.

&gt; Now here's what I was trying to show you and John, exactly, but you both
&gt; kept up with the arguments that I was wrong, unskilled, inexperienced and
a
&gt; liar.
">

Complete BULLSHIT on your part.  I said that you were wrong and nothing
more.  All the rest is just part of your imagination or perhaps a defense
mechanism to make far more out of it than really exists.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The system was a new rebuild; master, slave, line, fluid. The port was
&gt; uncovered, I could see it thru the new, crystal clear brake fluid and when
&gt; the pedal was pressed fluid escaped from it as indicated by the rippling
of
&gt; the fluid surface.
">

All that shows was that the valve was still moving in the bore, not that it
was actually opening as required.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And the system was causing slippage until I bled the air out . . .the only
&gt; work I did on it. No adjustments, no parts replacement other than a quart
of
&gt; brake fluid.
">

I didn't say that your repair had no effect.  If there was an exceptional
amount of air in the system (which seems to be the case with your quart of
fluid) AND the master cylinder was not allowing for venting (and your ripple
with pedal movement does not prove that it was), then your bleed of the air
in the system could stop the clutch slippage issue but the problem that
allowed the pressure to build up to begin with still existed.  The thing
Budd, is what got the fluid so damn hot to begin with?  Hell, the operator
may have been resting his broken foot on the pedal causing the problem and
when the clutch began to smoke, lied to you about it.  Unless you were
riding on the lift with him all of the time, you simply cannot say that it
didn't happen that way.  I am not saying that it did, just that it is
another possibility that you cannot absolutely deny.  Another thing to
consider is that if the master was functioning properly to begin with, there
should not be so much air trapped in the system as some of it would have
vented out from gravity alone.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now, you figure it out.
">

I don't have to figure it out Budd, the design of the system says that it
cannot happen that way and if you are positive that it can, EXPLAIN HOW.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; But here's one for you to explain: Robert Goddard is recognized as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; developer of modern rocketry, especially, liquid fuel rockets. In his
&gt; &gt; early
&gt; &gt; &gt; experiments, the engines blew up, not the tanks, the engines. Now,
since
&gt; &gt; &gt; there's this big old hole in the back, why did they blow up?

&gt; &gt; First of all, we are talking about explosive expansion here due to
&gt; &gt; combustion.

&gt; WRONG!!!! even in rocketry, you DO NOT want explosions anywhere. Rapid
&gt; burning, yes, explosions, no.
">

LOL, sorry Budd, but it IS a continous controlled explosion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Do you really think that the gas is expanding that quickly or
&gt; &gt; with anywhere near that much volume in a hydraulic clutch assembly?????

&gt; No.
">

Then your argument holds no water.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; hate to say this Budd but now you really are starting to make yourself
&gt; sound
&gt; &gt; like an idiot and this is not a lame revenge insult, it is an honest
&gt; opinion
&gt; &gt; and if you really think about it, you should see where I am comming
from.

&gt; And if you could see what I'm saying you wouldn't be insulting me. It's a
&gt; parallel, a extreme parallel, but nevertheless, a parallel. In both
&gt; instances, the same laws apply.
">

It is NOT a parallel, hell, it is not even close to being one.  One is
dealing with the violent creation and expansion of gasses and a device at
the output amplifying that force for the purpose of propulsion and the other
is a slow expansion of gas and liquid for that matter due to heat build-up
and a port designed to prevent ANY pressure from building at rest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And the cause was from the gases not being able to get out fast enough.
&gt; Goddard had the throat too small.
">

LOL, you are joking right???  Not about the reason for the failures but how
this in any way compares to a hydraulic clutch.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; As for the rocket, do you not consider these early failures defective
&gt; &gt; engines and in the successful ones, what happens in the chamber the
second
&gt; &gt; the fuel is cut off.

&gt; The point I'm trying to get thru to you, Tom, is that you claim that
there's
&gt; no way air could cause clutch trouble, and I say there is.
">

And you are wrong but if you think different, then explain how.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The rocket throws
&gt; your claim that as long as there is an exit, pressure cannot build up
right
&gt; out in the trash.
">

Hahahahahahahahaha, I must say Budd, you do make me laugh.  A rocket builds
up pressure because that is what it is designed to do and like I said and
you seemed to have ignored, the instant that you cut off the fuel supply and
the combustion stops, the pressure rapidly drops to nothing, just like it
will in a clutch master cylinder.  The vent in a clutch master is designed
to prevent expansion pressure buildup, not amplify it for propulsion like a
rocket.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What were we thinking . . . we must remember that Tom is the

&gt; &gt; &gt; happen
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unless
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he wills it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now who is the one not holding up to there word?  So much for
&gt; having
&gt; &gt; &gt; an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent converstation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;LOL&gt; Gee, a double standard. You can disrespect me but get ticked
&gt; off
&gt; &gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone disrespects you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The difference here Budd is that this is an obvious attack that you
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; admitted to (so much for your word).

&gt; &gt; &gt; As I said, degrade a person's experience or skill and you insult them.

&gt; &gt; I did no such thing and I can't help it if you take it that way.  You
are
&gt; &gt; not always going to be right Budd, no matter how much experience you may
&gt; &gt; have and it takes a real man to admit that they don't know everything
and
&gt; &gt; admit to being wrong every now and then.  I thought that you were that
&gt; kind
&gt; &gt; of man, am I wrong?

&gt; No, I am that kind of man and I have admitted to errors WHEN I AM WRONG.
In
&gt; this case, I am not. The problem is that my experience was outside of what
&gt; you can accept as happening. To you and John, that makes me a liar.
">

Does it make you feel better to accuse people of or believe that people are
attacking you even when that is the last thing on their minds?  Please give
an example where you were wrong on a key point and admitted to it.  I am not
saying that you never did, just that I can't remember any.  Now while I am
not saying that you don't believe what you are saying or are lying about
what happened with the forklift, what I am saying is that if everything was
functioning properly, what you say happened simply could not happen for the
reasons that you gave and if you believe different, explain exactly how
without the whining about being insulted or attacked.

&gt; Budd into the same stupid ass BS you gave out.  Now thats some funny
&gt; stuff right there!

The only thing funny here is your complete lack of understanding.  Where
exactly did he screw up Miles and lets see the details.

&gt; &gt; To me, it's just one of the things that keeps life interesting.

&gt; It happens sometimes.  Other weird things happen to me too.  When I've

&gt; several coffee cans.  Then I reassemble everything and somehow have a
&gt; coffee can of unused stuff left over.  Dang engine runs fine for years
&gt; and nothing falls off....weird!!  lol

Is this a testament to your mechanical ability or the care you take during
