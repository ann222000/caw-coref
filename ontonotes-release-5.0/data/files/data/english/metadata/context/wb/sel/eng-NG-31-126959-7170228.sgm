Every now and then you come across something that you just know is a winning
idea. I think this is one of them.
It is called Build A Niche Store (BANS) and it enables you to build your
very own online store which is made up of eBay's products and targeted to
any niche market you want.
As you probably already know, marketing to a targeted niche can be very
lucrative, depending on the niche. But even if the niche you are in is NOT
that lucrative, using this new script makes it very easy to set up these
niche eBay stores quickly and easily and in as many niches as you want.
You then connect people to eBay products via your affiliate store and eBay
will pay you up to 65% of the revenue they earn.
You don't have to hold a product inventory, you don't have to ship an item
and you don't have to deal with a customer but you do have over 25 million
products that you can promote and in excess of 28,926 different niche stores
that you can build.
Now that I own it, I plan to create many niche eBay stores and capitalize on
this coming trend. Click on the links below to visit

a few of the sites I've built:

http://golfersbiz.com

http://bargaincarstereos.com

You may configure your site any which way you like, adding Google Adsense,
Commission Junction, Amazon Associates to

name just a few. What does this mean for you? It's called affiliate
marketing, a way to cash in on sales made by customers that

purchase items on your site! In a matter of 30 minutes, you can build your
own website just like these. The only limit to the

number of sites you can build is your imagination! In addition, the creators
of this program offer an unmatched level of customer support! The last item
I'd like to mention is the trial period that is offered after you register!
From the day you purchase BANS you have eight weeks to play with it risk
free. Add affiliate stores to your websites or blogs, build new niche
websites, try out ideas in the manual and get involved in the members forum.
If by the end of your eight week trial period you are not happy with BANS
for any reason then send back your copy and your purchase will be refunded.

The official Build A Niche Store website captures everything in much more
detail and includes case studies and a live demo so you can give it a go
yourself.

To A Profitable 2007!
