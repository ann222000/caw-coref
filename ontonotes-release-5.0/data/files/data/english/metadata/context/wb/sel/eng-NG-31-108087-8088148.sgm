I got suprised by some anti-motorcycle hostility the other day.  I
suppose what's surprising is that it caught me off guard at all.

Here's what happened:  I got tagged for a random drug screen.  Let me
just say that I believe there are two types of employees:  Those who
work to fulfill the mission of the company, and those who don't.
Drug-compliance employees don't.  They are leeches.

So this gal meets me as I'm finishing with work, and escorts me to the
little drug compliance office down in the dungeon somewhere.  It's a
five minute walk.  To her credit, she tried to assuage the awkwardness
of the situation by making some polite conversation.. We spoke of the
weather, the busy weekend, etc.  I asked if the drug screens got in
the way of any other work she was doing, and she replied that drug
screens was her full time job.

&quot;Gotcha,&quot; says I.

We go through the rigamarole of peeing into a cup, no flush, check the
temp,  sign the forms and label the little cups with official stamps
and initials.  *Now* flush.  Why thank you.

She asks offhand if I have a long drive home.

&quot;Not too bad,&quot; I say. &quot;I'm riding my motorcycle, so I use the HOV
lanes.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I *hate* that!&quot; she exclaims, temporarily forgetting the
neutrality of her office.

&quot;Eh?  Hate what?&quot;

&quot;I hate that motorcycles can use the carpool lanes!&quot;

I explain the bikes take up less space and use less gas than most
cars.  She still hates the idea.  I mention that &quot;If you can't beat
'em, join 'em!  No reason not to get yourself a motorcycle if you want
to beat that traffic.&quot;  She answers that she'd be too afraid.

I shrug and head for home, shaking my head a bit at the attitude I
find from cage drivers directed towards anyone who isn't similarly
caged.

What is a 'Drug-compliance employee' ?  And how does what
someone does on weekends have to do with what they do at work ?

I could understand BLOOD tests ( or breath tests for alchohol
), because anything in your bloodstream during work, affects your
work, but pee tests that tattle on whether you had a joint with your
old lady last Saturday night - that's an invasion of privacy.

As long as the &quot;tester&quot; is female and reasonably decent-looking I have
never been able to resist offering to let them &quot;operate the tap&quot;
themselves if they are that uptight about knowing it was really my
sample.
Fortunately, my company sends us to an outside doctor's office for
this so it's not like I'm &quot;harrassing&quot; a fellow employee.
I agree that if we had people on our full-time payroll whose job it
was to do this I would be highly pissed (couldn't let that go by&lt;G&gt;).
These people are in the unfortunate position of having to justify why
they have a job, which makes them damn near Machiavellian in their
pursuits.
It's like the wankers in my company who were charged with making sure
we are in compliance with the Sarbannes-Oxley bullshit that came out
of the Enron and WorldCom scandals. That law was passed specifically
to make sure CEOs couldn't sit there when the company folds and act
like they didn't know what was happening, but the enforcement has
trickled down to the lowest levels of employment and severly cripples
our effectiveness due to the people who are in charge of it having to
constantly find something new to meddle in to justify their existence.
We can't buy a fucking paper clip without military style requisition
measures now.

The drug screener doesn't just hate the motorcycle in the lane, she hates you
and your existence, but only slightly.

I can see that you are suffering from existential angst over this exchange,
but you shouldn't be very concerned that she will cause you to cease
existence.

The statement &quot;I hate (insert whatever) came from her rebellious inner child
ego state.

One cannot easily reason with a child ego state on a logical adult to adult
level.

One has to become the critical parent, as there isn't enough time to build up
a
nurturing parent/rebellious child relationship.

The most effective remark in a casual exchange like that might be, &quot;Oh, grow
up!&quot;

That alerts the offending inner child to the possibility that there just
might be something wrong with the negative attitude. It would give her
something to think about.

But, consider the initial situation where the drug screener escorted *you* to
the
urine sample taking room. She was in the critical parent ego state, escorting
you to the bathroom to take the sample. You were like a child to her.

How would such a person rapidly change from the critical parent to being
taught that her attitudes were childish?

She's not going to do it, and posting a message about your dissatisfaction
with the crossed transaction won't help much, but it's the best I can offer.

Why should that bother you? A little walk from the parking lot to the
entrance of the store will do you some good.

But the morbidly obese woman can't walk very well. It doesn't matter that she
did it to herself, she can get a handicapped plate after her doctor certifies
her.

At 400 pounds, her knees are giving out and her smoking has reduced her lung
capacity. She qualifies for a handcapped parking placard on two out of a
possible six criteria.

A lot of people assume that, just because there is a wheelchair symbol on the
handicapped parking sign, only people in wheelchairs can use the spaces.

That just isn't so. A person can have no apparent physical handicap and still
be qualified to get a placard.

I ride a motorcycle, but I have a handicapped placard and I am self
certifying.
I will receive a new placard every two or three years as long as I live,
unless I
decide that I am no longer handicapped and notify the DMV of that decision.

So I parked my car in the handicapped space at the public library and a fat
guy stopped behind me and got out of his car and said, &quot;I am handicapped, and
I really need to park there&quot;, just as I was hanging *my* handicapped placard
on the mirror.

I gave the fat guy hell for his misguided attitude. I told him that having a
handicapped placard did not authorize him to approach *any* other driver and
ask that driver to move. I told him that citizen to citizen confrontations
were illegal.

He waddled back to his car, muttering, &quot;Damned crabby old man, @#$%^&amp;*...&quot;

Well, why don't you write that book?

When I read the first TA popularization,
&quot;Games People Play,&quot; I thought that the game was finished when the author
got paid for writing the self help book.

But then I read later TA popularizations that seemed to better describe how
people interact and saw that there were a lot of archetypal life scripts that
seemed to fit various people I knew.

One woman I went out with seemed to fit the &quot;Creeping Beauty&quot; script
perfectly.

Effective at WHAT, though?  I don't see much benefit to

simply walking away from it.

It isn't &quot;shit&quot;. I was qualified because of my physical condition, certified
by a doctor, and now I am self certifying. It's the only practical way to do
it.

Otherwise, a permanently handicapped person would have to make an appointment,
see the doctor, undergo an examination, and be re-certified every three years.
Then he would have to reapply for a new placard.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In what state ?
">

In California all you have to do is walk into the DMV and throw your
artificial limb on the counter and you can certify yourself as handicapped
without a physician's signature.

You do not have to be in a wheelchair, on crutches, or need to use a walker.

There are five other reasons that qualify somebody for a handicapped placard.
Besides missing a foot or a leg, the person may have general problems with
moving about, or have difficulty breathing and cannot walk very far without
getting out of breath. Once certified as qualifying for a handicapped plate
by a physician, the placard holder is on his honor to notify the DMV if he no
longer needs it.

I will never surrender my handicapped privilege until I am convinced that my
congenital qualifying condition will never cause me any further problems.

&gt;Did he laugh at that bullshit ?  He doesn't need any little

">

Only a police officer or a security guard can tell somebody to move their
vehicle under color of authority. A handicapped parking placard is *not*
authority, but
handicapped persons seem to think that their privilege does include the right
to tell somebody to move if they think they should get the space.

And there will always be busybodies who watch handicapped motorists lawfully
use a handicapped space. They will make remarks about how the person doesn't
appear to be handicapped.

One busybody saw me park at an auto parts store and he came over and tried to
tell me that there was a hefty fine for using the space. He wasn't a security
guard, he had nothing to do with the store.

Then he saw that I had a handicapped plate and said that he was just trying
to save me some money.

I told him that he had a nose problem and that somebody was likely to flatten
his nose for him.

He followed me into the store, insisting that he was just trying to help. He
followed me around the store, and I kept warning him that he was pushing his
luck.

Finally, the store security guard wanted to know what the disturbance was all
about. I told the guard what was going on. The guard told the busybody to
mind his own business.

In an equally weird situation, I stopped my car on the grounds of the
Washington cathedral to get out and take a picture. I did not use a
handicapped
space to park along the curb

But an old lady drove up, and she told me that she was handicapped and she
parked there every day and she said she could get me into &quot;a lot of trouble&quot;.

The real deal was that she couldn't parallel park worth a damn and she wanted
me to move so she didn't have to back into the handicapped space she wanted.

But the handicapped space she wanted wasn't anywhere near the entrance to the
cathedral and there was *nobody* else except me and her in the parking lot!

&gt; No need to shake your head. Most people are annoyed by what they

&gt; Think about it. You just pulled into the parking lot of your local

&gt; they are... Row after row of empty handicapped parking spots and you
&gt; have to park a quarter of a mile from the door.

&gt; As you hike to the door, you see a lone vehicle, probably an ancient

&gt; Why should that bother you? A little walk from the parking lot to the
&gt; entrance of the store will do you some good.

&gt; But the morbidly obese woman can't walk very well. It doesn't matter
&gt; that she did it to herself, she can get a handicapped plate after her
&gt; doctor certifies her.

&gt; At 400 pounds, her knees are giving out and her smoking has reduced
&gt; her lung capacity. She qualifies for a handcapped parking placard on
&gt; two out of a possible six criteria.

&gt; A lot of people assume that, just because there is a wheelchair
&gt; symbol on the handicapped parking sign, only people in wheelchairs
&gt; can use the spaces.

&gt; That just isn't so. A person can have no apparent physical handicap
&gt; and still be qualified to get a placard.

&gt; I ride a motorcycle, but I have a handicapped placard and I am self
&gt; certifying.
&gt; I will receive a new placard every two or three years as long as I
&gt; live, unless I
&gt; decide that I am no longer handicapped and notify the DMV of that
&gt; decision.

&gt; So I parked my car in the handicapped space at the public library and
&gt; a fat guy stopped behind me and got out of his car and said, &quot;I am
&gt; handicapped, and I really need to park there&quot;, just as I was hanging
&gt; *my* handicapped placard on the mirror.

&gt; I gave the fat guy hell for his misguided attitude. I told him that
&gt; having a handicapped placard did not authorize him to approach *any*
&gt; other driver and ask that driver to move. I told him that citizen to
&gt; citizen confrontations were illegal.

&gt; He waddled back to his car, muttering, &quot;Damned crabby old man,
&gt; @#$%^&amp;*...&quot;

Attitudes like that can sometimes get you squashed. That fat dude should get
a clue.

You bet!  They should take the gimp bus!

Aktuly, if they parked in the fire lane behind the store, I wouldn't
mind, either.  The fifty-acre lots are the most stupid because all the
empty gimp spaces need to be located up front, and everybody else has
to walk past them all on every trip.

There should be gimp days (one or two per month) sanctioned by local
ordinance when able-bodied drivers are chased off the handicapped
spots.  The rest of the time it shouldn't matter if you park in an
unoccupied slot.

Sciatica is a symptom of lumbosacral stenosis. Ask your doctor to certify you
for the handicapped placard on that basis. If he won't do it, change doctors.

I went to six different doctors before I was certified. Do you think I'm
going to
give up my placard every time the sciatic nerve swelling goes down?

I know that you're just being reactionary to play to reactive minds.

We do have regularly scheduled &quot;gimp busses&quot; and vans for the senior citizens
of the small town I live in, but handicapped parking spaces help independent
seniors to feel like they can still take care of themselves.

I don't use the handicapped spaces until I almost can't walk from back pain.

Before starting the handicapped parking program in California, legislators
determined that about 2.5 million people suffered from cardio-pulmonary
disease that severely impeded their ability to walk., even though they
weren't in wheelchairs.

I suppose that was something like 10% of the population of the state, but
when you go to a parking lot, you never see 10% of all spaces reserved for
handicapped people, maybe only 1% of all spaces are reserved.

And how can anybody rationally resent there being a few handicapped spaces
that aren't being used, when the 50-acre parking lot is only one-third full?

Personally, I love to walk and I go out and walk for miles when my back isn't
killing me. But I know that the nerve is going to get pinched again and again
and I will need the handicapped placard then.

I'm not sure what difference &quot;self-certifying under Ohio law&quot; makes.

A handicapped permit should be for people who are actually disabled, not
people who can run marathons.

In his particular case he had had a heart attack many years before and
took up running after that.  He typically did ten miles a day on his
afternoon run and was in far better shape than most of his students.
I'm sure he needed the permit right after his heart attack but when he
got up to 3 miles a day I don't see any reason why he should have been
allowed to continue to have it.

Fuck 'em, Scott. Those spots are for you. (Though I can imagine how the
dirty looks would get to you after a while.)

I read a story of a guy who gets tickets on his motorcycle for parking
in those spots despite having a plackard. He goes to City Hall about
once a month to fight them ... in his leathers. When the referee gives
him shit, he removes his prosthesis and plops it on the guy's desk.

I respect those spots, for I hope that if I should ever *need* one, it
will be there for me.

Tou sound so much like a teenager.

Teens often say, &quot;You're so stupid, or I'm so bored.&quot;

Boredom can be a sort of mental fatigue or even an inherent mental disability
in comprehending the harmony of one's surroundings.

Look around you and learn new things and appreciate the possibilities that
endlessly unfold.

Become more like a child, and less like a teenager.

That's absurd. You know perfectly well that the handicapped spaces are close
to the entrance because handicapped people have mobility problems. some
stores even provide electric scooters for disabled people to ride around the
store.

If you can walk a quarter of a mile inside WalMart to find your bargains, you
should be glad that you are able to walk a quarter of a mile across the
parking lot to join the herd of happy shoppers inside.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If there are three spaces in a lot, one has to be handicapped

There are times when the requirement for a handicapped space gets ridiculous.

Like at the Vermont Avenue post office in Hollywood. Drivers have to wait in
one line to get into the parking lot.

All of the handicapped spaces can be empty and all the regular spaces can be
full, and the able-bodied motorists in line are stuck there with frustrated
handicapped drivers until somebody vacates a non-handicapped parking space.

One day, I was a passenger in the 2nd vehicle from the head of the line, and
I saw that a handicapped space was empty, so I asked the guy at the head of
the line if he could let us go by him.

He was furious and started shouting at me. How dare handicapped people ask to
pass him, to use empty spaces reserved for handicapped people.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;... because, if you crowd the 5-7% handicapped slots up around the

The California legislature has stated that being independantly mobile is
beneficial to the physical and mental health of handicapped drivers. I will
continue to drive as long as I can, and, when my back problems temporarily
let
up, I will ride a motorcycle again.

This thread demonstrates that able bodied drivers are irrationally resentful
of handicapped drivers' parking privileges.

There was a picture in the Los Angeles Times of a Harley Davidson with a
placard parked in handicapped space. The picture was in a section called,
&quot;Only In L.A.&quot;, and was uncaptioned.

The columnist meant the picture to be self-explanatory, ignorantly suggesting
that if somebody could ride a motorcycle, they didn't need to use a
handicapped space.

I fired off an angry letter, telling him that a lot of Viet Nam vets and WW2
vets were handicapped, rode Harleys and had every right to use the
handicapped spaces without being censured by the ignorant.

I told him about my Harley riding friend whose leg was blown off by German
mortar fire in Normandy in 1944. I told him about my Harley riding friend who
stepped on a land mine in Korea.

The columnist didn't even try to defend his ignorant picture. He humbly
apologized for offending handicapped motorcycle riders.

I drive my truck when my back hurts and I ride my motorcycles when it doesn't
hurt. I don't use the handicapped spaces when I ride because somebody might
steal my placard.

&gt;&gt; Not long after I lost my leg, my fiancee and I were waiting in line at the
&gt;&gt; grocery store checkout.  I was on crutches, and happened to have worn a pair

&gt;&gt; to her boyfriend about how she would never wear shorts if she lost a leg.  I
&gt;&gt; turned around and told her that I dearly and truly hoped that she would
&gt;&gt; someday have the privilege of making that decision for herself.

&gt; When my leg was healing I had these new fangled external fiaxters? hanging off
&gt; the side of my leg like  TV antenna. Add the half healed skin grafts and the
&gt; chunk missing from my calf and it looked messy. Adults would stare , then look
&gt; away whispering to themselves, while I had kids walk up and say &quot;WOW, what
&gt; happened to your leg&quot; (while their parents looked on uncomfortably). I
&gt; preferred the straight up questions to whispers.........

&gt;&gt; For gimpy parking, and anyone who doesn't understand what it means?  Same

That is very smart of the DMV.   However, they could save everyone

Actually, this just sounds like (as most of your posts have shown) you

immediately see that you are a prick.

And before you start complaining - I *easily* qualify for a handicapped
tag.  However, I chose not to bother getting one because I *can* walk -
despite the pain and the limp.  Neuropathy sucks...

It looks to me like you're the one being a judgemental prick.

It's against California law for anybody to block a handicapped person from
getting to a handicapped space.

The rude driver in  this case was an Armenian immigrant and he got to the
head of the line and could have easily moved to the right to let handicapped
people by.

But he just sat there and was reading a book, when I rolled down the
passenger window and asked him nicely if we could go by him.

Then he started going all immigrant on me and got angry. But he did move over
when I waved the placard.
