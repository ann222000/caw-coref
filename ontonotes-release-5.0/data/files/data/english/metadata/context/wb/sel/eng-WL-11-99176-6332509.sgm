Or not.

I don't intend for this blog to be solely the home of radicals/progressives/socialists. I hope (and think) that I have something to say which should interest anyone. But there are times when I just have to vent at liberals, and this is one of those times.

It's common in the aftermath of demonstrations to criticize the corporate media for their lack of coverage of demonstrations, underestimating the size of the demonstrations, giving equal time to counter-demonstrations of three people, and so on. But those failings are understandable, given the fact that corporate media serve corporate masters (or are corporate masters, if you prefer). But bloggers shouldn't have that kind of built-in bias. You wouldn't think, anyway.

According to ANSWER , who keeps track of these things, there were demonstrations in 500 different cities all across the United States yesterday, from large cities to small, "red states" to "blue," totalling hundreds of thousands of people. There actually was decent, if not spectacular, media coverage. So how did the liberal blogs do? For the most part, they completely ignored those hundreds of thousands of people. Not only didn't they do anything to promote or even mention the demonstrations before they happened, which you might have expected if they really were against the war as many profess to be, they didn't mention them after the fact either. Yes, some people have a problem with ANSWER (and if they do, they ought to get over it. Any "problem" they have with ANSWER should pale in comparison to the problem they should have with imperialism and its murderous wars of aggression). But only a tiny fraction of the 500 demonstrations (albeit the three largest, in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago) were organized by ANSWER, so there was plenty to write about even ignoring ANSWER if they wanted to do so.

Daily KOS had not a word to say about them in a regular post, although they did manage to tell readers to "check out some photos of protests against the war in Iraq being held around the world today." as an aside to an Open Thread (not that the demonstrations actually were the focus of the open thread, unlike "March Madness," which was given a thread all its own).

Atrios? Not a word.

Firedoglake? In a long post about Lieberman, a brief mention at the very end about a demonstration to be held today outside his office. Otherwise, not a word.

Suburban Guerrilla? Not a word.

First Draft? Not a word.

Huffington Post? This morning, their lead headline was "London, Sydney, New York, Toronto, Washington, Stockholm, Istanbul, Copenhagen, Seoul, Boston..." leading to an AP story, but by later in the day that's just become a tiny headline, one among dozens. No blog posts about the subject at all, although Sunday is a day of rest for Huffington Post bloggers, so we'll see what tomorrow brings.

I spent yesterday staffing a table at the demo for the Committee to Free the Cuban Five , and had a very interesting conversation with one man which illustrated the point I've made before on the subject of "liberals vs. radicals." This man claimed to love Fidel Castro, and admire everything that Cuba has done (education, health care, sending doctors to Pakistan earthquake victims, and so on). But he claimed he just couldn't stand the "system" (socialism) that Cuba has. It's hard to have too serious a conversation in the hubbub of a crowd, but I just couldn't get him to understand that what Cuba has accomplished flows out of the system. He was convinced it's all because Fidel is just a good man who cares about his people. He certainly is and does. But a Fidel Castro equivalent elected President of the United States in 2008, aside from being completely unthinkable, just would not be remotely the same.

Is this connected to why liberal blogs don't think hundreds of thousands of people in the streets are even worth mentioning, nevertheless encouraging? I think so, which is why I mentioned it.

Update: Just to clarify: am I castigating people for thinking that demonstrations are not the most important thing in the world, or even for thinking they are completely counterproductive? No. There are many aspects to the antiwar movement, and there are certainly various arguable positions on what needs to be done, or what the priorities are. So if someone thinks these demonstrations were a waste of time and accomplished nothing, they should use this opportunity to say so . Say something . Completely ignoring the actions of hundreds of thousands of people makes them even worse than the corporate media. Which is saying something.

Second update: It's now Monday. Huffington Post has exactly one blog mentioning the demonstrations, written by someone who was in a hotel in San Francisco close to the demo site but couldn't even be bothered to rouse himself to go see it (nevertheless participate in it), refers to it as a "parade" rather than a march suggesting he's never been to one in his life, and has to rely on "accounts" to even know what happened. He wastes a lot of words concluding that the war will only be stopped when the antiwar movement goes to conservative, evangelical churches and offers to debate the war. He seems to miss the point that the overwhelming majority of Americans are already opposed to the war, and that the most important task is not to convert the remaining few who support the war, but to mobilize those who don't (and to convince the latter group that withdrawal "sometime in the future" will always remain "sometime in the future," and that only calling for withdrawal now will actually get the troops out). Anyway, it's a silly essay which has almost nothing to say about the demonstrations themselves other than to dismiss them, and it's the only one at Huffington Post.

Incidentally, for those (like this man) who think that demonstrations don't accomplish anything, here's a thought for you. What would have been the reaction of the administration and the media if there had been no demonstrations this weekend? In my opinion, that would have been a crushing blow to the antiwar movement and to the likelihood of ending the war.

I got the feeling that a lot of liberal bloggers were taking part in the demos, so I think your supposition is correct, we may not read a lot of blogging about them until tomorrow. Blogging right after an exhausting demo isn't the first thing on everybody's mind, you know.

Sometime last summer, when there were demonstrations across the country against the war and in support of Cindy Sheehan, I went over to Eschaton and mildly rebuked Atrios for not covering this event and was reprimanded by about four or five of his supporters for daring to criticize Atrios for his lack of coverage concerning the candellight vigil. When it comes to speaking out, sometimes our so-called progressive leaders can be quite selective about which topics merit their attention.

I am chastened. I have to admit, after three of these things, I didn't make the three-hour trip to Seattle again for this one.

Hearteningly, the Seattle paper had an elegaic front-page story about the costs (highlighting shattered lives of amputees) of this moral crime and immense tragedy.

Now I shall link to your post and that story.

My posts of the demo LA were up by 11 pm, and that included three podcasts.

Mainstream media gave the demos more coverage than liberal blogdom.

The liberals are getting prepared to help Hillary Clinton (or some other zombie) rape. Since she's pro-war, they are silent. Quite simple, really. Par for the liberal course.

When people like the U.S. president require a 11,000-strong personal escort just to appear in another country, it's clear that both the administration hears and understands the cries of the hecklers in the cheap seats -- but that it has enough power not to care.

People can complain all they want, but they still buy gasoline. They can chant and march until they're hoarse and sore, but they still buy electricity and natural gas, still watch cable TV and still buy consumer goods. They're allowed to walk into the Diebold booth once every four years and flip a switch that isn't connected to anything, but they still pay their taxes.

Bush could sail by with 1% confidence, as long as people obey the law and continue to consume. With ~4% of the world's population and just over 25% of the world's inmates, I guess we're not doing too good on #1 but man we're still kickin' ass on #2. So who cares if we blow up some brown people or our poor families' kids come back from the war acting strange. There's money to be made!

Liberals publicly oppose the war ?

It is a little hard for them to get out onto the street when they are still cowering in fear over the NSA wiretapping and the Feingold resolution.

Sing it out, Eli!

Feminists are always having to do battle with the "Straw Feminist" a term I first encountered from Amanda at Pandagon . You know the hairy, stinky dyke on a byke who wants to castrate all men and destroy families?

It's time antiwar marchers took on the "Straw Marcher" that liberals haul out whenever they are asked to get off their butts and actually participate in the antiwar movement.

The Straw Marcher does nothing but participate in one or two marches a year and does it while waving ultra-left red flags that say "smash capitalism" or "free Mumia" or "support the resistance".

I have yet to meet that stereotype the liberals keep relying on. Even the red flag wavers are also active in their unions, their student groups, their neighborhoods. They post on blogs or publish zines. They attend other political events. They volunteer at independent radio, TV and infoshops.

I'll defend those people who do something over the liberals who do nothing and complain about the people who do.

It's slightly off topic (but hey, it's my blog) but I have to say something about Mumia. It's amazing how he keeps coming up when people (not you, clearly) attack demos. I actually haven't been to a demo in several years where his name was mentioned from the stage (although there was a "Free Mumia" booth right across from mine on Saturday). And the last time his name was mentioned, it was because he was delivering (via tape recorder) a rousing speech against the war, having nothing to do with his case whatsoever. He happens to be one of the best writers and speakers on the left today.

But all that aside, if someone did have the "audacity" to mention his case, the question I ask is, "When exactly would it be appropriate to mention Mumia? After he's dead?" This man is on death row . I don't give a damn if there's a demonstration about Iraq or abortion or the PATRIOT act or Palestine or whatever. If someone wants to take up three minutes of stage time to try to educate people about what is almost certainly a gross miscarriage of "justice," to try to save his life, more power to them.

In regard to Mumia: who needs Republicans to play the race card, when there are liberal Democrats already doing it?
