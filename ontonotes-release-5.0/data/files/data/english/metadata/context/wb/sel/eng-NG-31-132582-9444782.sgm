TO TOUCH THE HEART

To touch the heart of someone dear
though it might sometimes cause a tear
to fall or rest upon the cheek
Should be something all should seek.

For often hearts not touched at all
start hardening and shrinking small.
And then the time it takes to grow
A loving heart is very slow.

For hearts expand as those who care
extend their love and let us share
a moment, space or special phrase
that eases pain on dreary days.
Or simply starts our lips to smile
and brightens time for just a while.

The ways and kinds and means of sharing
it seems to me, are based on caring.
And though we're often worlds apart,
You still can touch my very heart.
You make me smile or shed a tear.
And I'll remember year to year
Just how your &quot;touching&quot; helped me grow.
And I just thought I'd tell you so.
