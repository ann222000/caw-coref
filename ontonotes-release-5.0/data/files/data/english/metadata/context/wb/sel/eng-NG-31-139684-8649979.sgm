For an $80 withdrawal, the fee was $3.42.  Note that I withdrew most
of my money there because the new rates make low stakes, long matches
no longer worthwhile, since most of my opponents are rated so much
lower (the rakes were bad before the change, but now they are
&quot;prohibitive&quot;).  Add to that the terrible luck I've had there lately,
for example, losing last night with nearly a 6.000 difference in luck
(I rated &quot;advanced,&quot; over 1900; my opponent rated as &quot;beginner&quot;) in a
9 point match.

Just so that people are made aware, and to remove all ambiguity - the fee of
$3.42 is the cost of the paypal transaction.

Paypal charges for cross border purchases which are clearly laid out in the
Fees portion of the paypal site. For transactions from outside US/Canada to
North American accounts  for amount of minimal value there is a 3.9% charge
+ .30 USD added to the transaction (This is paypal and not BGR).

These type of fees you agree to when using Paypal for such transactions
(including refunds and transfers from merchant accounts).

In this case .039 * 80.00 + .30 = $3.42

I am posting this to make people realize that this is a fee tacked on for
Paypal and not BGR.

I'll also add that I will keep playing there, just out of curiosity,
to see if I will lose the remaining money in the account, despite
outplaying my opponents by a wide margin in most of the games.

Just lost a 9 pointer in which the difference in luck was more than
7.000.  Is anyone else who plays long matches finding that luck
determines the outcome against the clearly better player about a
quarter of the time?

No, absolutely not. I'm certain I speak for everyone here
when I assure you that nobody but you has ever lost a
single game, much less a match, because of bad luck.

But I think some of BGR's competitors are prepared to pay for their
customers to withdraw, and thereby ensure that their customers get
free withdrawal.

When examining rakes, it's probably best to look at a player's
combined costs on a given site -- some of the costs are due to
withdrawal charges (and in some cases the withdrawal charges are 0),
and some of the charges are due to a rake.  Also there are some sites
where there is significant credit risk -- the website may simply
refuse to pay.

to Paypal or going to the website are not really relevant or even
meaningful since both parties must get paid in the end.

So what ? This is hardly exceptional.

It seems (from a sample of a few dozen matches) that the standard
deviation of the luck as defined by gnubg, is about 200 millipoints/move.

A 9 points match is typically 300-400 moves, for a luck standard deviation
of 3500-4000. Your difference of 7000 against you should happen about 3%
of the time (and when it does, you will almost always lose).

You seem to play quite a lot, so you may well get a few of these unlucky
matches each month on average, and more than one in a given week may not
be outrageous.

There are plenty of web pages giving winning changes for given match
length and rating difference. Try this one for instance :
http://guyfisher.com/workshop/bookmarklets/fibs.html

You'll see that if &quot;clearly better&quot; is a 300-350 rating edge, then, yes,
luck overcomes skill about a quarter of the time in a 9 points match.

It's not that one match, it's how many of these horrible luck, long
matches I've had over the last dozen or so, and it's difficult to
resist the temptation to play the safest, but not best move after such
a run of bad luck.  Since GNUBG is an open source and free way to
assess the luck factor, sites should offer a service that refunds your
money if you get bad luck beyond a certain point, for example, the
7.000 difference in a 9 point match.  If everything is truly random,
they could determine a formula that would make money for them and
smooth out the runs of bad luck for serious players.

If these calculations are accurat you can see how ridiculous the rake
commissions are!

For a nine point match you have, according to the calculator on the site
mentioned above, you get about an edge of 5% over your opponent when
your rating difference is less than 100 points... now everybody compare
that figure with the rakes that apply!

So it's impossible to be a long term winner on sites with progressive
rake and base rake thats increased per point of the match!

Don't play online backgamon until the sites run by marketing experts
with no expertise nor any love for the game itself change their policies!
Or play for fun and accept your expectation to lose money in any case!

Choose your poison!

yours,
p.

I can already see it. Possible poster in Monty universe:

&quot; I can't believe it I once again had an unlucky match but just below
the threshold for getting
the refund. It is definitely significant. It's not that one match,
it's how many of those not quite so horrible luck, long matches I've

I was going to comment on the &quot;refunds your money if you get bad luck
beyond a certain point&quot; but Bob certainly beat me to it (ROFL style).

The difference between me and Monty must be that I play drunk online
and post here sober while he does it the other way around.

Sounds like the &quot;eskimo&quot; had better put a large pot of strong coffee
on the stove.  It should be obvious to sober people that if there are
no &quot;rigged&quot; dice, and it's all legitimate, then they could determine a
formula that would make them a profit, so why would they not want to
do this?

After the 7.000 difference match, I then lost one with nearly 6.000
against me.  Then in the next one, the luck was nearly even
(opponent's was slightly better), and I won easily.  If I had the kind
of insurance I'm envisioning, I could actually stay at BGR and not
lose money, which looks quite doubtful under the present arrangements.

This is even more hillarious considering, that Monty has stated

I make more playing sober than drunk but the increase is not worth the
loss of fun. Well, most of the time. Occasionally I get great pleasure
from having a great error rate but I certainly miss the good old TMG
days when you had a friendly chat with many players while playing.

well this one was too good to pass up.  let me rephrase it to see if i
understand it correctly.  if player X loses a match because player Y
had better luck, then X can get a refund from the site because playing
backgammon (a dice game) the better, or should i say, the almost world
class player, should always defeat the weaker player.

LOLLLLLLLL  yea right.  i'd say my odds of winning the lottery AND
getting a blow job from a supermodel are better than that ever
happening.  monty, luck is a part of the game, accept it.  sometimes
you can play flawlessly and lose and sometimes you can play like crap
and win.  thats just the way it is.  if you are having a hard time
with that concept, then you'd be better off taking up chess or go
where there is no luck involved.

by the way, there is still time for you to sign up for the fall FIBS
tournament, $40 entry fee with 9 point starting matches, but alas, we
still use dice, so there will be some luck involved.

Oh, where to begin?

1.  GNUBG represents a standard that is open source, and therefore one
can use the software and decide whether or not to buy the insurance
offered. While I personally have found flaws with its luck analysis,
that was in singe games, not long matches.  In a long match, if GNUBG
assesses luck as 6.000 or more against someone, few would doubt that
that person got very bad luck relative to his/her opponent.  But those
few could simply not purchase the insurance offered.

2.  If insurance was offered, the site would have to determine that it
would turn a profit in the long term, nothing more.  Of course, they
would need to factor in the cost of software development, etc., but
the point is that is not an issue of sites doing things out of the
goodness or their hearts.

3.  The issue in not that in games with luck players can experience
occasional stretches of very bad luck, but rather whether it is in the
best interest of the site and the &quot;serious&quot; players to implement a
policy that would &quot;smooth out&quot; such stretches, if the site could
profit from it and the player could be assured of not losing too much
within a short period of time against weaker opponents.

4.  Obviously, the site would have to offer luck insurance against a
huge luck difference, or else it would make no sense for either
party.  One idea is to take an average of matches lost against players
GNUBG rated as playing at a lower level, and for each increment of
GNUBG luck factor (perhaps .500), you would be given your money back
for one of the lost matches (assuming all matches are of the same
length, and at least 5 games long).  Perhaps the longer the match, the
lower the increment.
