Mr. Hines, if you recollect our discussion of Leac nan Gillean where
the teenagers of two villages murdered each other, all but one girl
and you wanted to know the exact location, after some research I
thought I would be able to pinpoint the very spot for you!

The stone lies on the footpath south of Achintraid, on the way to
Strome Ferry. The exact location was alleged to be

Grid Ref. NG 840378 on Ordnance Survey 1 sheet No.26.

http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/getamap/

In fact, I did some searching through the Ordnance Survey website, but
the Grid Ref. is apparently an old-style reference and is not now
recognized by the OS search engine. There are dozens of landmarks
called "Leac nan..." and "...nan Gillean", but "Leac nan Gillean" is
unknown to the OS.

Almost the only way to actually find it would be to have a
knowledgeable local take you there, assuming anyone still living (or a
local historian) even knows about the incident. The story was recorded
from Dan MacRae (85) Lochcarron, Ross-shire, a native of Kishorn, by
Ian Fraser, on 14th October, 1968. Mr. Macrae would now be 125, so I
doubt that he is still available for comment.

I'm becoming more and more interested in finding Leac nan Gillean, and
as it is currently 5:00 pm in Achintraid, I'm about to call the local
police station there and find out if there is a local historian or
librarian who knows about this incident. I get free phonecalls to
Europe and North America, plus I speak Gaelic, so I would be less
likely to attract suspicion about my motives than you.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, I talked to an elderly lady, a Mrs. Murchison in Achintraid who
was delighted to hear from me and will no doubt be out at the
neighbours this very minute telling them all about her phonecall from
Canada and saying, "You won't believe this - they speak Gaelic in
Vancouver!!"

Mrs. Murchison said the story is well-known locally and she could lead
me to the very spot where Leac nan Gillean sits, which is down a road
- or more of a track, I gathered - to where on the right hand side
there is a field she called "Each an Aiseig" - Horse of the ferry; a
rather odd name for a field. I didn't like to ask her to spell it as
most elderly Gaels cannot read or write Gaelic, thanks to the
pernicious system which punished them for using the language at school
and I had no wish to emnbarrass her.

I assumed that in the old days a horse was used to to haul the ferry
across the sea loch (inlet) using some sort of rope pulley system.
Anyway, that's the precise site of Leac nan Gillean.

I remarked that they must have been a rough lot in Achintraid in those
days and she was amused and said, "Some thing never change" and asked
if I had never been to Glasgow? (the Watts or Harlem of Scotland for
most non-Glaswegians). She asked me if I was a Murchison, a local
sub-tribe among all the Macraes, I guess, and said with an air of
cosmopolitan sophistication, "I had a phonecall just the other day
from a Murchison in the United States, researching his ancestors, so
we're quite used to calls from America here!" Indeed!

A sweet old lady who was clearly itching to sit me down to a cup of
tea and scones with home-made jam and butter for a good "crac" (chat).

I must do this sort of thing more often - Highlanders are very
self-confident people and rarely startled by weird people appearing in
their lives out of the blue - after all, we've had the English and
after them, there can be no unpleasant surprises left...

So there we are Mr. Hines - Leac nan Gillean is now ours - what a bit
of luck that I have a Ph.D in charming elderly ladies!

So if you're ever in Achintraid, stop in to see Mrs. Murchison and
I'll bet you'll get your tea and maybe even a wee dram!

Ah! Highlander -

Your quoted Grid Reference is actually a, "Landranger", reference and it
translates as follows :-

N57:22:47, (57.379694)
W5:35:38, (-5.594024)

or _
OSX 184050
OSY 837850

If you take your Landranger reference to http://www.streetmap.co.uk/
you can feed it into the search engine or you can use the references I
converted above.
((Note: if you feed in a Landranger reference DO NOT leave a space between
the Letters and the Numbers)).

Always pleased to help.

Why, thank you kindly!

That's a Heartwarming Tale.

I'm a little puzzled how the fight started and when it occurred -- or do we
know?

The Weapons?  Claymores &amp; Fists, Staffs, Iron Bars?

Were other girls murdered while only this one survived?

If so, I should think she had something special -- and was either a terrific
fighter, knew where to hide or run to -- OR was the peach of the lot and
desired by all the men after the fight -- so was not killed, but protected
and spared.

Could be, but no reasion was known for the fight apparently.

A shocking story really, for two villages to lose all their children
in one day, but as Mrs. Murchison said, some things never change. I
was thinking of the constant reports one reads of teenage violence and
they occur everywhere in the world...

The other point that caught my attention was that both villages buried
the children in one mass grave. No talk of revenge, no attacks on each
other; just acceptance of a bitter fact. If Akira Kurosawa were alive,
he would have loved this story and made another Roshomon from it!

&gt;Ah! Highlander -

&gt;Your quoted Grid Reference is actually a, &quot;Landranger&quot;, reference and it
&gt;translates as follows :-

&gt;N57:22:47, (57.379694)
&gt;W5:35:38, (-5.594024)

&gt;or _

&gt;If you take your Landranger reference to http://www.streetmap.co.uk/
&gt;you can feed it into the search engine or you can use the references I

&gt; &gt; Mr. Hines, if you recollect our discussion of Leac nan Gillean where
&gt; &gt; the teenagers of two villages murdered each other, all but one girl
&gt; &gt; and you wanted to know the exact location, after some research I
&gt; &gt; thought I would be able to pinpoint the very spot for you!

&gt; &gt; The stone lies on the footpath south of Achintraid, on the way to
&gt; &gt; Strome Ferry. The exact location was alleged to be

&gt; &gt; Grid Ref. NG 840378 on Ordnance Survey 1 sheet No.26.

&gt; &gt; http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/getamap/

&gt; &gt; In fact, I did some searching through the Ordnance Survey website, but
&gt; &gt; the Grid Ref. is apparently an old-style reference and is not now
&gt; &gt; recognized by the OS search engine. There are dozens of landmarks
&gt; &gt; called &quot;Leac nan...&quot; and &quot;...nan Gillean&quot;, but &quot;Leac nan Gillean&quot; is
&gt; &gt; unknown to the OS.

&gt; &gt; Almost the only way to actually find it would be to have a
&gt; &gt; knowledgeable local take you there, assuming anyone still living (or a
&gt; &gt; local historian) even knows about the incident. The story was recorded
&gt; &gt; from Dan MacRae (85) Lochcarron, Ross-shire, a native of Kishorn, by
&gt; &gt; Ian Fraser, on 14th October, 1968. Mr. Macrae would now be 125, so I
&gt; &gt; doubt that he is still available for comment.

&gt; &gt; I'm becoming more and more interested in finding Leac nan Gillean, and
&gt; &gt; as it is currently 5:00 pm in Achintraid, I'm about to call the local
&gt; &gt; police station there and find out if there is a local historian or
&gt; &gt; librarian who knows about this incident. I get free phonecalls to
&gt; &gt; Europe and North America, plus I speak Gaelic, so I would be less
&gt; &gt; likely to attract suspicion about my motives than you.
&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; Okay, I talked to an elderly lady, a Mrs. Murchison in Achintraid who
&gt; &gt; was delighted to hear from me and will no doubt be out at the
&gt; &gt; neighbours this very minute telling them all about her phonecall from
&gt; &gt; Canada and saying, &quot;You won't believe this - they speak Gaelic in
&gt; &gt; Vancouver!!&quot;

&gt; &gt; Mrs. Murchison said the story is well-known locally and she could lead
&gt; &gt; me to the very spot where Leac nan Gillean sits, which is down a road
&gt; &gt; - or more of a track, I gathered - to where on the right hand side
&gt; &gt; there is a field she called &quot;Each an Aiseig&quot; - Horse of the ferry; a
&gt; &gt; rather odd name for a field. I didn't like to ask her to spell it as
&gt; &gt; most elderly Gaels cannot read or write Gaelic, thanks to the
&gt; &gt; pernicious system which punished them for using the language at school
&gt; &gt; and I had no wish to emnbarrass her.

&gt; &gt; I assumed that in the old days a horse was used to to haul the ferry
&gt; &gt; across the sea loch (inlet) using some sort of rope pulley system.
&gt; &gt; Anyway, that's the precise site of Leac nan Gillean.

&gt; &gt; I remarked that they must have been a rough lot in Achintraid in those
&gt; &gt; days and she was amused and said, &quot;Some thing never change&quot; and asked
&gt; &gt; if I had never been to Glasgow? (the Watts or Harlem of Scotland for
&gt; &gt; most non-Glaswegians). She asked me if I was a Murchison, a local
&gt; &gt; sub-tribe among all the Macraes, I guess, and said with an air of
&gt; &gt; cosmopolitan sophistication, &quot;I had a phonecall just the other day
&gt; &gt; from a Murchison in the United States, researching his ancestors, so
&gt; &gt; we're quite used to calls from America here!&quot; Indeed!

&gt; &gt; A sweet old lady who was clearly itching to sit me down to a cup of
&gt; &gt; tea and scones with home-made jam and butter for a good &quot;crac&quot; (chat).

&gt; &gt; I must do this sort of thing more often - Highlanders are very
&gt; &gt; self-confident people and rarely startled by weird people appearing in
&gt; &gt; their lives out of the blue - after all, we've had the English and
&gt; &gt; after them, there can be no unpleasant surprises left...

&gt; &gt; So there we are Mr. Hines - Leac nan Gillean is now ours - what a bit
&gt; &gt; of luck that I have a Ph.D in charming elderly ladies!

&gt; &gt; So if you're ever in Achintraid, stop in to see Mrs. Murchison and
&gt; &gt; I'll bet you'll get your tea and maybe even a wee dram!

You know when I learned to read maps?

In 1947 - from the RAF Regiment. They took us out in a closed wagon and
dropped us off in groups of 5. They gave us a small section of the map of
the area and told us to get ourselves home but we did not get a compass.
Thus we had to match the topography of the terrain to the markings on the
map. Work out the best route home to base on foot . We had to call in at
enough checkpoints to take us around a minimum 30 mile route. We did not get
provided with food or drink and had to live off the land, (no problem as I
had been the village poacher at a very early age).

This route planning was not as easy as it first seemed for it could involve
cliffs, large rivers, lakes, (it was in England), bogs or any of the other
barriers you might find around the countryside. I never got lost, even once,
and was always first team leader back to base. I'll tell you something -
when those guys taught you something you learned fast - or else. They were
the toughest bunch of guys I have ever met in my life and, believe me I've
met a few.

Sadly, not the same place. I didn't find the Leac nan Gillean name
anywhere else but south of Achintraid, but Swordale / Suardal are
common names in the Northwest Highlands and Islands - it's a Norse
name meaning Grassy Valley and I would imagine, related to the English
word sward as in Greensward, meaning grassy.

Ach as a place name always means field (shortened from achadh) so
Achintraid was originally Achadh na Tràghad - The Field at the Beach,
Tràghad being the genitive case of Tràigh, a beach or strand

"The field at the beach".

There are literally hundreds of "Ach +" names in the Highlands as the
Gaels memorialized everything from fields to battles with a name.
