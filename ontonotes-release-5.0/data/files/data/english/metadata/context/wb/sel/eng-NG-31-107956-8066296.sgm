Posts from a sad, pathetic, moron from the last 24 hours...

The point is...go haunt some other newsgroup where your disruptive
behavior might be appreciated!

Trouble is...you know what those little puppies do on the floor...

Hee hee...for a minute there I thought you were talkin' about Dirty Dan.
Yes, Skip did a hugh amount of work on his boat and I hope he can find
his way up here in the fog.

Since you gave up your self appointed sheriff position for your better
fitting 'instigator hat', I felt someone had to step up and try to
maintain order.

What have I said that you would consider 'a personal attack'?
Don't mention Dan... he doesn't count!

I'm concerned for you JohnH.
Please go sign up for another 'Mickey Mouse/Goofy' cruise.  I'm sure
it'll help sooth your jangled nerves.

Coast Guard &amp; pilots had to go out to guide the ships into port because
of the fog.  Can you see any here?...

I imagine he's only allowed out of the back room after dark.
Most golf courses try to promote an upscale image.

Can you take a hint...and quit harassing legit boaters? &lt;My favorite!&gt;

Ah ha!  that explains why you're on edge.     I get the same way
planning a major trip...so much to think about...what will you forget
etc.  Once you're actually on the road it all melts away.
I've got a 2200 mile towing adventure coming up at the 1st of August.

Would a good size motorcycle have the same effect?

Thanks, Don!

admitting that your posts are sad, pathetic, etc.?

Wasn't hard.  His insecurities are more evident from every post he makes.
A deft touch of the proper 'hot button' here &amp; there and he's like a dancing
bear on a heated tin floor.
That drooling does get a bit messy though.

Those two were separated at birth.  They have nothing to do all day but
believe the world revolves around them.  Krause's narcissism is about
the only way to tell them apart.
