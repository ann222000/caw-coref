My JW Experience
I've been lurking here for a few years on and off.  I faded from the
borg seven years ago and haven't had one regret since.  The only
regret I have is wasting twenty years of my life and my children's
lives.  Thankfully they are all out and are very forgiving, although
they live with the residual effects of all the control that dominated
our lives.
I started studying with JW's in 1978 when I was disappointed with
life, family and marriage. The Vietnam war had ended and  I was
aware and afraid  of nuclear weapons.  i  had a friend from
high school that went to a commune in New Mexico and came back home and
began studying with JW's.  Paradise, seeing my father who passed away
when I was 3 and a loving brotherhood sounded wonderful so I started
studying out of that little blue Truth book.
I try to look at the good that happened in my life and I'm appreciative
that the religion helped me become drug and substance free.  I made
some good friends  while my children were growing up, which I didn't
have as a child or young adult.  My husband at the time was an
unbeliever so I didn't fit in with the elders etc., so I aux. pioneered
a few times of year to be considered theocratic.One of my fleshly
brothers was going through a divorce and he became one of JW's with my
help. :(
In the 1980's I became extremely depressed due to being abused as a
child.  I grew up in an orphanage, thus my alias v1710 was my laundry
number.  The elders weren't at all helpful, although they tried.  I
began professional counseling which lasted for over ten years.  My
couselor never told me to leave JW's, but helped me learn to think and
reason for myself.   When I began having doubts about the religion
he never told me what to do, but told me to ask myself what legitimacy
is there in what JW's say, what legitimacy is there in what I believe
and what do I feel most comfortable with.  This helped me not feel
guilty about going to work secularly and other things.  My biggest
disappointment with JW's was when they came out with the new light about
the generation in Matthew.  It was after that that I didn't want to go
door to door.  I didn't understand the new light and couldn't knock on
people's doors and teach them something I didn't understand or believe
in.  There was also an elder in the congregation that was very
controlling and that was more than I could handle.  When my older
children left the religion by and I wasn't supposed to have contact
with them I drew the line.  I didn't have a family when I was a child
and there was no way I was going to give up having a relationship with
my children.  They were teenagers and still needed guidance and
direction.
Although my husband wasn't a JW ( in fact he was df'd my marriage
ended).  We were both happy to be out of an unhappy situation.  I
began to fade after I separated from him.  I began attending meetings
at other congregations, not to fade, but because I thought it might be
better elsewhere, it wasn't.  It helped the fade as the elders never
new where and if I was attending meetings.  I found a little book at
Barnes &amp; Nobles about toxic religion and it referred to JW's.  I cried
and cried and called the author.  He was kind and got me in touch with
Randy at Freeminds.  I read Crisis In Cons.  by Ray Franz and
couldn't believe how the religion was rotten from the top.  I thought
it was just the congregation I was in, but he described perfectly what I
was experiencing locally.  I remember feeling so guilty for reading
the book and would hide it my closet in case anything happened to me and
someone found it I wouldn't be disfellowshipped and somehow I thought
hiding it from JW's was like hiding it from God.  That says a lot
doesn't it?
I continued to pray to God and accepted Christ as my savior.  I was
led out of the desert into a land flowing with milk and honey.  I
could of never imagined all the wonderful things that would happen to me
after I was free.  When I mentally left the religion I walked around
for days singing &quot;Born Free&quot;  I met a caring loving man and we've been
married for over six years.  I've tried to attend churches a few
times, but organized religion will never be part of my life
again.
For the first few years I wouldn't speak to any JW's  as I wanted
everyone and everything out of my life.  I had my husband burn all the
books and literature. This past summer JW's stopped by and wanted to
talk.  I was polite and tried not to get into anything &quot;spiritual&quot;
but they insisted so I gave it to them. It was the day after
the massacre at Virginia Tech and of course she brought up the how
terrible the tv and internet are for people.  I said that had nothing
to do with what that boy did.  He was mentally ill.  A lot of
people watch tv and use the internet and don't commit crimes to that
degree or any degree.  I told her that when evil happens there is also
the greatest propensity for good and that a lot of good would come out
of the situation.  I told her about my little grandaughter who has
juvenile diabetes and all the wonderful people we've met due to the
condition.   The woman (I won't call them sisters and brothes or use
any of their other terms) began attacking the catholic religion because
of the abuse that happens.  I asked her how she could do that when the
same things happens with JW's.  She asked me if I kew of someone
personally and I said &quot;YES&quot;  She said &quot;Well, there is no perfect
organization&quot;  I told here &quot;That's the point....I'm not looking for
any organization. No one will ever put me or God in a box again.
The greatest thing I've ever heard is the word GRACE and if I die
tomorrow I know that God loves me just the way I am right now.&quot;  Her
husband quickly spoke up and said &quot;We have to get going&gt;&quot;
After they left I felt so good for having my say.  I thought back to
the young 20 year old girl I was that swallowed everything they said
hook, line and sinker and had no regrets about what I said to them. I
appreciate this forum as it verifies my perception of reality and I
don't feel so alone in what I went through.

Welcome!

Typical reply! It is like they have to protect the organization no
matter what. I do not know if I could have came up with her reply so
fast! No empathy what so ever!

Re: My JW ExperienceSep 27, 2007
That's a great story and it's nice that you found true spirituality in a
non cultic group of Christians.
Time and again we see that the JWs are nothing but a ramshackle religion
that only really cares about preaching the Watchtower gospel, it does
nothing for the social or emotional needs of its members.
That agenda suits the multi billion dollar WTS but not the R&amp;F members.

Re: My JW ExperienceSep 27, 2007
WOW.....You go girl.  What an incredible story.  It truly is a
relief to &quot;get out of her&quot;.  I'm happy too that your children are not
among this cult.  My kids aren't either and I regret ever getting
involved.  But I have learned over the past few years that everything
happens for a reason and at least we have been there and know what it's
all about, giving us the edge so that we can be a source of good
advice for others.
I myself am a Born Again Christian and as a JW, I have never felt the
way I do now towards God.  I am so much closer to Him now and have a
real love for my fellow human beings, something we as JW's never had.
It's the biggest blessing of all getting DF or leaving on our own
accord.  GRACE......yes, this is a word we never knew until now.
Hallelujah!

The JW's always have to get going whenever they hear &quot;Grace&quot; because
the JW cult is all about working your way to everlasting life.
For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from
yourselves; it is Godâ€™s gift â€&quot; not from works, so that
no one can boast.
Ephesians 2:8-9

The JW's just don't get it...

And the spiritual whores leading them do not want the JW's to get
it, either.
