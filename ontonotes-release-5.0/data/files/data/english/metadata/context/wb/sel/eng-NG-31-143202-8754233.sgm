This is from my friend, forwarded for the needy

Dear friends,

This is for the benefit of all young ladies who want to make kozhakattais
for Ganesh Chathurthi.

Here is the recipe for kozhakattai:

Soak rice 1 glass for 6 to 7 hours.remove the water and strain it.spread on
a newspaper for further straining of water.when the rice is still wet but
removed of all water , put it in a mixie and powder it. now sieve it. the
fine powder will come out and some tharangal(coarse rice) will remain on the
sieve. now again put some more wet rice along with  the tharangal and powder
it. repeat the process till all rice is powdered.this you do on the previous
day and keep it in the freezer wellcovered. For 1 glass of rice you will get
2 glass of powder.for that you can use half a coconut.
instead of making rice powder you can also wet grind rice and make mavu like
kolam mavu.this you have to do on the same day and not the previous day.

Now for pooranam:-grate coconut finely .put in a cheena chatti. cut and add
vellam pieces half the measure of grated coconut . mix nicely with little
water. you can see the colour and judge whether the vellam is enough. now
start heating . keep stirring . add melted ghee in between . when the
pooranam start leaving the sides of the cheena chatti then stop. take little
in hand and make balls and see whether you can make small balls. add elachi
powder.
now for mavu, take the rice powder add enough water so that it looks like
kolam mavu.blend it nicely with chattuvam. now put in cheena chatti and
start heating. keep stirring  so that you get a  mavu without kattis .and
stop when the mavu leaves the sides. now take the dough off from the gas add
ghee or sesame oil( nalla ennai) and mix it nicely with hand like how you
make chapathi mavu.now the mavu will become soft and will not stick to
hands.

Now make kinnams out of mavu, keep pooranam inside and make kozhakattais.
while making kinnams keep little warm water and oil to wet your
hands.thenput them in plate and steam(without weight) for 5 min. it
should not be over
cooked then the kozhakattais will break. if you cook less it will stick in
the mouth. so cook properly. the test is if you open and see the cooker the
kozhakattais will shine.then remove from heat. cool it then remove it from
plate. dont remove when it is hot. it will break.

Nkozhakattrais are ready for pooja.or 1 glass of rice and half a coconut you
will get 25 to 30 kozhakattais.

May Lord Ganesh bless  all

Thank you,

Radha Sekhar
