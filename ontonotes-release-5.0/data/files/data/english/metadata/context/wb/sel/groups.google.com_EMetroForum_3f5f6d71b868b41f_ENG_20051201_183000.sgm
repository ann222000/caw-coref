We've said a lot about forgiveness in other topics: &quot;Persecution&quot; for
one.

I'm thinking that word gets tossed around a lot without people
considering what it's about. If I ask someone to forgive me, for
example, that means I'm acknowledging I did something wrong. If I ask
someone to forgive me and it doesn't mean I've acknowledged my
wrong-doing, I need to use another word.

Same goes for when I forgive someone. When I forgive someone that
means I'm acknowledging that someone has done something wrong TO me.
How many times do we flippantly say, &quot;I forgive you,&quot; without
considering that we've actually been wronged.

&quot;I forgive you,&quot; when said flippantly, is at times a way to avoid the
reality of the situation. Many times I'll ask a person who says that,
&quot;What did the person do wrong.&quot;&quot;How were you harmed by that person.&quot;
No answer - or - long pause.

When we get in touch with how we've been harmed instead of running to
&quot;I forgive you,&quot; we will get in touch with pain. Anger, sadness, fear,
etc. may be our reaction when we touch reality.

When a woman wanted to talk to me about her husband wanting to divorce
her, I didn't understand her incongruency in that she was smiling as
she described a marriage of 20 years falling apart. She smiled and
said, &quot;But I forgive him.&quot; I then asked her what he did to harm her
that warranted her forgiveness. At first she didn't know what say.
She was spellbound. She finally named all the times he had lied to
her, stepped out on her, verbally demeaned her, etc. By the time she
was finished, she was crying. A lot. During the sessions that
followed, she had to work through her feelings of anger, sadness,
shock, etc. By the time we were finished, she was able to say, &quot;I
forgive my husband. He owes me nothing. He will never be able to pay
me back for what he did to me.&quot; And she was then able to set the
boundary, in her case, of not allowing him to call her.

Another client , after she was molested when she was 8 years old, went
to a counselor a couple of times. It was only a couple of years ago at
age 20, that she told me the first thing the counselor told her was
that she had to forgive her perpetrator. She told me she hadn't been
able to get in touch with her anger because the counselor had made it
very clear that forgiveness meant &quot;Don't feel your pain, especially,
anger.&quot;

When I forgive someone it means I'm acknowledging I've been harmed.
When I get in touch with all that, I'm going to feel. And that's OK.

Hey all, this is Carla. Surprise! No, I didn't fall off the face of
the earth, though Minnesota is pretty close to that. Quick update on
me: I'm still at UPS, Kohl's, and now the newest addition to the
craziness of my life is SCHOOL. I'm going crazy! ahhh! I'm going to
school to be a medical assistant. This is my second (of 15) month of
school. Oh, and I have a boyfriend: Tony. He works for Fox Sport
Network....a camera guy. He's also adopted from Colombia.....get this
his mom's name is Joann.....mine is Joan...in case you don't
know......his dad's name is William as is mine. We've been together
since the end of July. Anyways, hi!
Anyways, forgiveness is something that was a hard concept for me to
grasp because of my past. Thank God, I have come to a better
understanding of it. Growing up, when wrong was done to me (by a
certain person), this person would keep saying they were sorry, day
after day after day. Yet, the same wrong was done to me. So they would
say &quot;I'm sorry&quot; I would genuinely forgive them, then the same routine
was repeated the next day. After 17 years of this, I realized that
maybe this person wasn't sorry, yet because I was (and still am) such a
forgiving person, I was taken advantage of. After 17 years, I stepped
back to look at this redundant pattern only to realize that my
perception of forgiveness had been warped because I was basing it on my
past instead of what it was in actuality.
Because these words were used so flippantly growing up, I have
learned to use them with some sort of reverence. I won't say I'm sorry
for something until I am genuinely sorry even if it is blatantly
obvious right then and there that I am wrong. I can't bring myself to
say something like that, and not mean it. I would rather have time to
think about the offense that was taken by someone else, than to just
say the words and not mean it. I don't know about you guys (and gals)
but that's just the way I operate......or at least try to.

Ok, time to ut-shup!
Love 'ya guys,
Carla

pam,
this is an excellent post' I'm not sure I can add much to it; it's so
good.

In his book Further Along the roald less Traveled, Scott peck talks about
something he calls &quot;heap forgiveness.&quot; Often his clients would come to him
and say, &quot;my parents did the best they could,&quot; right during the first
session.

i suppose if someone really belives that, it's okay, but as peck points
out, no one does the best they can all the time.
peck says we have to put our parents on trial first before we're ready
to forgive them.

I once sawa move called My life, about a guy who was terminally ill. He
became a famous actor, I think and was pretty alienated from his parents.
In the movie there were flashbacks of things that happened during his
childhood that deeply hurt him. then, on his dathbed, he says, and here's
the kicker, &quot;you didn't do anything wrong.&quot;

that's not forgiveness, that's denial. But Hollywood wants you to think
it's forgiveness.
i wanted to puke.
I am glad metro is a safe place for us to express all of our feelings,
including the ugly ones.

Carla lady: So wonderful to hear your voice - well, your post is
close! I'd rather see you so I can give you a hug. Thanks for sharing.
Just got back from a Metro meeting. It was fun.

Phil and I have gotten into the habit of saying, &quot;I am wrong,&quot; when we
are. That helps US to take responsiblity for our behavior instead of
being flippant with the I'm sorry.

As for the &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; we might say, &quot;I was wrong. And I am apologize
for what I did.&quot; Sometimes we have said to each other after that,
&quot;Will you forgive me?&quot; and the response may be, &quot;I'm not ready to do
that yet. I have to process more.&quot; We give each other the space for
that. Demanding forgiveness is not appropriate and can cause damage.
One book I was reading awhile was about a man whose father had poured
acid on him when he was a kid. The only time the dad came back was
when he became a Christian. He told his son, a grown man by then, &quot;You
have to forgive me because I have to make my peace with God.&quot; WOW!
What crap. Another thing that bothers me is when someone says, &quot;I have
to forgive you because God commands it.&quot; Wow! That is really poor.
If that's why someone is forgiving me, please don't tell me that was
your motivation. If God were taken out of the picture, that wouldn't
be happening. I want REAL relationships - not ones that are based on
obligation.

By admitting we're wrong, instead of being flippant with the &quot;I'm
sorry's&quot; and &quot;I forgive you's&quot; makes for safe relationships. There
was a person in my life once, for example, who said she was sorry but
had no understanding of what she did wrong. Without that understanding
on her part, I knew she'd repeat the pattern. I wouldn't have been able
to handle a repeat performance. THere are others, like the person in
Carla's life, who aren't sorry at all and just flip the word out to
make them look good. (or whatever).

Good thoughts. Keep 'em coming!

(Carla, I'm happy for you. I really am.)

&quot;Another thing that bothers me is when someone says, &quot;I have
to forgive you because God commands it.&quot;&quot;

That always bugged me too. For the same reason. That person is
observing a law, they don't really care about healing a wounded
relationship. Another one is when a fellow Christian does something
that irritates you and says &quot;Do you forgive me?&quot; as though you're under
obligation to.

I like your point about admitting you're wrong. It does say you've
taken responsibility. I wish some of the Christians who've asked me &quot;Do
you forgive me?&quot; had bothered to acknowlege they'd been less than
considerate, even if they didn't mean to be, rather than just expecting
to be forgiven automatically so that everything would continue on all
rosy and we'd all look like we had the fruit of the Spirit.

Hey Andre,
I've got a couple of episodes from my favorite TV show that have really
powerful forgiveness themes. And they're done really well IMO. I've
considered just showing one of them when it's my turn to speak some
week. I might do that next time, since the subject has come up on the
board. Beats all that work trying to put together a 1/2 hour long talk!

What you said reminds of Lenny, my high school classmate. We had the
assignment to play a piece of muic we enjoyed and then give a speech
about why we chose it. When Lenny got up to the front of the class, we
were all astonished that he was actually going to do something. The
teacher had a big smile on her face as if to say, &quot;I knew I could get
Lenny to do something, anything in my class.&quot; Lenny proceeded to play
the entire version of some popular piece back then, the name of which I
can no longer remember. We were all getting into the tune. I was
wondering what Lenny had planned to say afterward. When the piece
ended after about 10 minutes, Lenny said, &quot;I didn't finish the rest of
my assignment.&quot; We all died laughing. Lenny distracted the teacher
yet another time.

Anyway Robert - if you think you're gonna be able to pull a Lenny by
showing a movie and then saying, &quot;That's it folks.&quot; Think again!!! I
will figure out a way to change your wicked ways other than put you in
a quiet room like our English teacher did FOR us back then!

Talking about movies that relate to the &quot;forgiveness&quot; theme.

Phil and I just saw &quot;Walk the Line&quot; - about Johnny Cash's life. I
really like Cash and I understand his &quot;dark&quot; history. I love his
realness. I had heard a few years ago that he and June Carter fell in
love after each had been married before; Johnny was married when they
met; they had seen each other at the same gig. &quot;Love at first site,&quot;
they have said in interviews. Interviews with the couple also stated
that their ex's and all the kids get together during holidays and have
a blast together. As you probably know, the Cash's died within 4
months of each other sometime last year or the year before. &quot;Soul
mates&quot; as some say. TRUE story.

When I read the article - before seeing the movie - I remembered
thinking how God's forgiveness DOES cover a multitude of sins. The
couple had sinned against their former spouses in many ways, fell in
love, eventually married and DID live happily ever after. They were
both Christians so no one can say, &quot;Well, they hadn't come to Christ
before they were married.&quot; Our Lord took this couple's sin - forgave
it, and then gave them a fulfilled life together.

I didn't know the entire movie would be about the Cash/Carter
relationship. As I sat there what came to mind was the many couples
I've counseled and friends who I've talked to who struggle with the
temptation to throw out their marriages because the &quot;grass is greener
on the other side.&quot; All these people I was thinking about are &quot;devout&quot;
Christians. Even though the movie was a beautiful example of a revived
life and the grace of God, I know it will be a temptation for some
people who watch it to CHOOSE to leave their spouses because, &quot;Look
what God did for the Cash's. No one was really hurt in the long run.&quot;
blah blah blah.

I left the movie with really mixed feelings. Loved the singing; Loved
Cash's ruddy, realness; loved that June Carter had loved him fully
regardless of his many screw ups and actually nursed him into recovery.
LOVED how the grace and mercy of our God was depicted. AND I was
saddened - devestated, in fact - thinking about families who have seen
the Lord's forgiveness toward a spouse who left them for another man or
woman and how much &quot;glory&quot; that movie depicted about the new
relationship.

What I'm trying to say is that our Lord's grace is not fair. He
forgives people who hurt us. And we have to deal with that and heal
and struggle with our faith in a God who could do that.

BUT, thank God He is not fair. All I have to do is look at myself and
realize that if He was fair, I'd be in hell - just like the Cash's and
the rest of us - for not being able to live a holy life.

I love to say to the person who has sinned, &quot;THe Lord will redeem you.
He will give you new life. That's what He's done for me - many times.&quot;

I love to say to the person who has to watch the Lord bless those that
have hurt them, &quot;I'll help you work this out. I'll be with you when
you feel the pain. And I'll pray that our Lord will make it clear to
you that he hasn't taken sides; that He's still with you and does not
negate your feelings of anger and pain simply because He has forgiven
the one that has wounded you so deeply. That's what He's done for me -
many times.

I'm on a role today. I'll keep writing.

I think, too, we flippantly throw out, &quot;God forgives you,&quot; or &quot;I am
forgiven by Jesus,&quot; without thinking about what we're saying.

When the Lord (or anybody) says, &quot;I forgive you,&quot; they are saying that
a crime has been committed against them. If harm had not been done,
there's no need to forgive. (I feel bad for people who think that they
have harmed every Tom, Dick and Harry because their self-esteem is so
low that they can't discern when they have actually harmed another and
need to make ammends.)

THink about it. I need to anyway. I am forgiven by Jesus. That means
I have harmed Him. He knows I have and He was willing to wipe the
slate clean - once and forever - when He shed His blood on that cross
so long ago.

WHen I'm in touch with the harm I've caused myself and others, hearing
the &quot;I forgive you always and forever&quot; from my Jesus, I want to cry and
hug Him and thank Him for wanting a relationship with me knowing full
well what I've done in the past and knowing full well what I'll
continue to do in the future.

It really IS inappropriate to simply throw around the word
&quot;forgiveness.&quot;

OK, I'll say a little something too. But these episodes speak so
powerfully I don't know what else I'd need to add. I think they would
make for some great discussion afterward. Or who knows? Maybe I'd be
the only one they really speak to. Then I'd have to talk about what
they say to me.

Hey!! I got another idea! We could all watch The Matrix together
sometime! I haven't watched it since I saw it when it came out in '99
or whenever. I remember being so blessed - there were many Biblical
allusions in the movie. The main character died and rose from the dead
to defeat his enemies!

Post 17: Rob, you know I trust your presentations!!! Do what you need
to do.

The Matrix was so totally awesome with its spiritual connotations!
Laura and I took a walk together and were in awe of what was going on
in it. (It wasn't a good scene for me when I happened to counsel a
woman a few days later who told me she had forbidden her husband to see
&quot;The Matrix&quot; because it's violent and New Agey. OH, was that a tough
moment for me to say, &quot;Your boundaries are your business. I hope the
plan works for you.&quot;)

Then there's the Wizard of Oz. I see Jesus in that each time I watch
it.

ANd, to go on, The Lord of the Rings trilogy was so spiritually
powerful to me that my children and my husband told me I have to sit
far apart from them next time they go to the movies with me. During
the last movie, throughout much of it, I was applauding and making
verbal comments loudly.

I know I have harmed Jesus because He said He has forgiven me. Of
course, Jesus is capable of being harmed. He has flesh and blood and
feelings. (Can't harm Him physically anymore, obviously.) I am harmed
when I am attacked verbally; when I am abandoned; when I am deceived. I
have committed all those crimes against Jesus at some point in our
relationship.

Like I said, no need to say, &quot;I forgive you,&quot; if one hasn't been

It is amazing how the Holy Spirit works! We started out with REMORSE,
Then RESENTMENT,Then FORGIVENESS, Then PERSECUTION,Then
FORGIVENESS.-Sweet,Sweet Forgiveness in Jesus. Metrowest's goal is to

Rob, if I did THAT, my son would have shot me dead on the spot. I
think he's nervous that I'll be at his wedding in August AND at his
college graduation ceremony in the future. He doesn't know what I'll
do. For Holly's sake, I'll hold back at the wedding. But at his
graduation, anything goes!

Andre, Before I respond, I still want you to put yourself out there
with what you DO have regarding whether or not the Father can be
harmed. This isn't about right or wrong. Feel free to share..

Honestly &lt; really don't know; my gut instcint is to say the Father can't
be harmed; but I could be wrong.

Kim,
I do belive God suffers, but that's not the same thing as being harmed; at
least they don't mean the same thing to me.
i had mentioned in an earlier post that God is grieved by our sin; but I'm
not sure God can be harmed in the same way we harm other people.

I don't understand the problem with the concept of God being harmed -
and by us.

I have a relationship with God - the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God
is not a doctrine or Bible verse. He's living and active. He's got
feelings. I believe, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I have the
ability to harm Him. If I haven't harmed Him, why does He say, &quot;I
forgive you?&quot; One would have to ask, &quot;What did I do that warrants
your forgiveness?&quot; He reveals that on a regular basis through the
gift of conviction that opens my &quot;eyes&quot; to see how I've hurt Him. (He
makes it clear in the Scripture that when we hurt each other we are
also doing the same to Him, etc.)

THANK God for His mercy. Because of it I can boldly face His answer to
my question, &quot;What did I do to you that You have had to forgive me.&quot;
I'd be walking around in a lot of ugliness if my Lord didn't love me
enough to answer that question.

I want to know where you're coming from on this one Andre. I don't get
it.

pam,
Maybe this is semantic, but i don't have a problem with God being hurt,
and feeling pain, Geneeis tells us that when God destoryed the world after
the flood, He was filled with pain. As a side note, when the Koran recrods
this event, it takes out the reference to God's pain. Perosnally, I'm glad
it pains God to judge; it's not something He does casually or flippantly.
But to me, saying that God can be harmed implies that God can be inured;
and injuires need healing. What does that do to God's perfection?
Does God have problems? Does he need help?
i don't know, i cna't reconcile God being harmed with god's perfection?

I'm not wanting to respond any further to whether or not God can be
harmed. (Subject is getting boring to me now.) except to say I know I
have the ability to harm my Lord in many ways. Yes, I have injured my
Lord. I don't understand what that has to do with His perfection.

Maybe you can answer your own question: What does that have to do with
God's perfection? Does God have problems? Does He need help?

I, personally, don't need answers to those questions. Maybe others do
and can respond here.

Thanks for sharing, Andre.

I lied: (post 33) I do have something more to say about whether or
not God the Father can be harmed.

I looked up the words hurt, harm, grieved in the Greek and Hebrew
(using Strong's concordance) and the dictionary. Not much of a
difference between any of those words in any of the 3 languages.

RE: Post 36

Andre, (or anyone) if my responses are NOT gracious, let me know. I
have often lacked tact. I want to be held accountable if it's missing
in my responses. I really mean that!! &quot;How&quot; one says things makes a
huge difference in whether or not what is said will be received!

Andre, didn't you say that your Braille thingy on your computer does
not allow you to &quot;see&quot; the line up of previous posts so that makes it
impossible for you to make reference to those in your responses? If
it's possible to do that, it would be helpful; if not, I'll figure out
what responses match what post. Did you know that on this topic alone
there have already been 37 posts? WOW! (By the way, I have so
admired your life-long determination to thrive in your physical
blindness. I don't have patience to figure out how to use my cell
phone and you have mastered computers.)

Okay, then for me this raises more questions than answers; which is okay.
Quesitons about the nature of God; the nature of hurt, etc.
Thank you for making me think.

Father also has a human nature?
I don't have an anser.

Well,I havne't mastered computers, trust me, my knowlege is very limited;
I don't even use Windows, i use Dos and unix.
I have no way of knowing how many posts have been written on a particular
topic; the posts aren't numbered when they come to me.
