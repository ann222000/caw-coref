A  federal judge has ruled that President Clinton cannot use the power of his
office to block prosecutors from questioning his senior aides, rejecting
Clinton's assertion of executive privilege in the Monica S. Lewinsky
investigation, lawyers familiar with the decision said yesterday.
In a ruling issued under court seal  Monday, Chief U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson concluded that  independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's need
to collect evidence in his  obstruction of justice probe outweighs Clinton's
interest in preserving the  confidentiality of White House discussions, the
lawyers said.
The decision made Clinton the first  president to take a claim of executive
privilege to court and lose since the  dramatic Watergate showdown in 1974,
when the Supreme Court unanimously ordered  Richard M. Nixon to turn over the
secret Oval Office tapes that ultimately led  to his resignation. Clinton's case
also seems headed for the high court as  sources indicated that the White
House likely will appeal.
Johnson's ruling could amount to a  significant political as well as legal
setback for Clinton, lending ammunition  to Republican critics, such as House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.), who have  charged that Clinton is trying, in
Nixonian fashion, to impede Starr's  investigation with invalid privilege claims.
Clinton invoked both executive  privilege and attorney-client privilege to
prevent Starr from asking deputy  counsel Bruce R. Lindsey, communications
adviser Sidney Blumenthal and other top  officials about conversations regarding
the Lewinsky case. According to the  lawyers, Johnson also dismissed the
attorney-client privilege claim on the  grounds that Clinton could not use
government-paid White House lawyers to aid  his defense in a criminal probe.
The executive privilege dispute has  been one of many legal hurdles erected
in Starr's path as he investigates  whether Clinton lied under oath about
having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky  and asked her to do so as well. But
Starr has won a string of victories in  recent weeks. Johnson has also sided with
Starr by ordering Lewinsky's first  attorney to comply with a subpoena and by
rejecting the former White House  intern's claim of a binding immunity
agreement with prosecutors.
Word of the decision overshadowed  other important developments yesterday in
Starr's multi-faceted investigation  into the Clinton White House. A day after
charging former Clinton business  partner Susan McDougal with criminal
contempt and obstruction, the Little Rock  grand jury that has been investigating
Whitewater for 4 1/2 years disbanded  without issuing more indictments.
While the White House took that as a  hopeful sign that the long-running
Whitewater investigation is nearing its end  without producing charges against the
president or first lady Hillary Rodham  Clinton, officials were careful not
to read too much into it, at least publicly.  Indeed, a parallel Washington
grand jury can still take testimony or issue  indictments and Starr's spokesman
suggested that he still could impanel a new  Little Rock grand jury.
Johnson's executive privilege ruling  came as prosecutors yesterday infused
new energy into their Lewinsky grand jury  investigation, bringing back one of
the central players in that saga, Clinton  confidant Vernon E. Jordan Jr., to
testify. Another key witness, presidential  secretary Betty Currie, is slated
to return today.
Jordan, a prominent Washington  attorney, arranged job interviews in New York
for Lewinsky at Currie's request  and found a lawyer to help Lewinsky draft
an affidavit denying a sexual  relationship with Clinton in the now-dismissed
Paula Jones case. But Jordan has  denied that he was trying to encourage her to
lie.
&quot;Today, as twice before, I answered  all the questions completely, truthfully
and honestly and to the best of my  ability,&quot; Jordan said as he left federal
court after his third appearance before  the grand jury.
A Jordan associate said prosecutors  yesterday asked him about the timing and
substance of telephone calls he made to  the president, as well as calls he
made to various prospective employers on  Lewinsky's behalf in December and
January. Many of the questions went over  ground covered in previous appearances,
but Jordan was told he will have to  return again.
In another legal judgment related to  the investigation, the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District yesterday  upheld Johnson's decision to keep
secret the hearings related to executive  privilege and other disputes. Citing
grand jury confidentiality rules, a  three-judge panel unanimously rejected a
motion filed by news organizations,  including The Washington Post, seeking
access to the proceedings.
The continued secrecy surrounding the  dispute over executive privilege has
meant that both sides have not publicly  explained their arguments in a
high-stakes constitutional struggle, just as the  White House and Starr's office
offered no official comment on Johnson's ruling.
While presidents have claimed a form  of executive privilege to shield their
internal deliberations since George  Washington, the Nixon ruling in 1974 was
the seminal case establishing that such  a privilege exists and setting the
broad parameters of White House secrecy for  the modern era.
At the time, Nixon was defying  special prosecutors seeking Oval Office tapes
that implicated him in the  Watergate coverup. In an 8-0 decision, the
Supreme Court found that the  president does have a right to confidentiality,
particularly in national  security or law enforcement situations, but that it must
be balanced against the  need for disclosure. In Nixon's case, the court judged
that the interests of the  Watergate probe outweighed the privilege. Two
weeks later, Nixon resigned.
Judge Johnson applied a similar test  in the Clinton case, according to
lawyers familiar with her ruling. While she  found some validity to the argument
for confidentiality of the disputed  conversations, she concluded that the
prosecutors' needs were more compelling,  the lawyers said.
She also relied heavily on an earlier  appeals court ruling involving another
Clinton White House claim of  attorney-client privilege, citing a decision
that called the use of White House  lawyers in Whitewater criminal matters
affecting the Clintons a &quot;gross misuse of  public assets.&quot;
That case involved Starr's efforts to  subpoena notes taken by White House
lawyers in discussions with Hillary Clinton  during 1995 and 1996. The 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Starr  that government lawyers cannot be
enlisted in private defense work and the  Supreme Court refused a White House
request to hear an appeal.
The White House has 10 days to file a  notice of appeal of the latest
privilege ruling. If Clinton's lawyers seek a  hearing in the appeals court, Starr
likely would ask the Supreme Court to grant  an immediate hearing instead, just
as Watergate prosecutors did. The White House  may decide to forgo an appeal
rather than run the risk of a highly visible  defeat on the executive privilege
issue in the Supreme Court.
While Starr has been criticized by  the White House for spending four years
and more than $30 million on his  investigation, yesterday's ruling underlines
how much of his resources have been  absorbed fighting various court
challenges. In nine instances, witnesses or  defendants -- including the White House,
McDougal and former Arkansas governor  Jim Guy Tucker -- have challenged
criminal convictions or court rulings, only to  be rebuffed by the courts.
But Starr's time has also been split  between his private law practice and
his public duties. Just yesterday, Starr  argued at the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals on behalf of the Meineke muffler  chain, which was appealing a $397
million judgment awarded to franchisees who  claimed that the firm defrauded
them of millions of dollars that were supposed  to go to advertising.
Clinton partisans seized on  yesterday's argument to illustrate their
contention that Starr has not devoted  full energy to the taxpayers. &quot;When he got up
Tuesday morning, Mr. Starr had the  choice to serve the public interest or his
own,&quot; said White House spokesman  James Kennedy. &quot;He chose the latter
course.&quot;
Starr deflected questions about his  work at Kirkland &amp; Ellis, where he
continues to earn up to $1 million a  year, after the three-hour session in
Richmond. Instead, he seemed to relish his  brief furlough from government business.
Far from appearing unprepared, Starr  seemed sure-footed during aggressive
questioning by judges seated at a  wood-paneled dais in green leather swivel
chairs.
At one point, he complained &quot;there  has been a vilification&quot; of his client.
And in an allusion to a famous Watergate  phrase, he waved a black binder of
company letters and dismissed their  significance, saying, &quot;These are not
smoking guns.&quot;
If Starr has found a smoking gun  against the first family in his Whitewater
probe, he was not saying yesterday.  The Little Rock grand jury disbanded two
days before its official expiration  date without any charges being brought
against Hillary Clinton in connection  with her legal work involving Whitewater.
Starr and his deputies interviewed the  first lady under oath for nearly five
hours at the White House last month and  presented a videotape of that
session to the grand jury before closing it down.
Starr could still decide to bring a  Whitewater-related perjury or
obstruction case in Washington, since the  testimony of many witnesses, including
Hillary Clinton, has also been given  here, either before the grand jury or in
depositions. While the expiration of  the Arkansas grand jury signals Starr's
efforts there are nearly at an end, his  spokesman, Charles Bakaly, said he could
not rule out the possibility another  grand jury would be impaneled there in
the future if evidence warrants.
During 4 1/2 years of operation  involving three successive groups of
Arkansas citizens, the Little Rock grand  jury handed up nine indictments, including
charges against Tucker, McDougal and  her late ex-husband, James B. McDougal.
Starr's office also obtained several  guilty pleas in the investigation.
The latest group to serve on the  grand jury celebrated the end of their two
years on the job with a pizza party  at the courthouse. The White House, by
contrast, said the president was not  ready to celebrate yet.
&quot;He's not expecting that it will  fundamentally change things one way or
another,&quot; said White House press  secretary Michael McCurry. &quot;The persistent quest
for something in Whitewater  will likely continue.&quot;
