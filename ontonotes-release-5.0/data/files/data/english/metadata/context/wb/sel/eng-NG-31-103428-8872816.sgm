Let's discuss the three basic &quot;must-haves&quot; for success in a strength
training program.In order for you to experience muscle gain, three
conditions need to be fulfilled:1. You must perform progressive
strength training for the entire body.&quot;Progressive&quot; means that the
demands of the training increase over time. Today, you can lift 10
pounds over your head. Next month, you should be able to lift more
(perhaps 20 pounds). Next year, your overhead lifting ability should be
outstanding. &quot;Progressive&quot; = Lift more over timeWhy work the entire
body, if all I want are bigger arms or smaller thighs? By performing
whole-body workouts, you get hormonal benefits. Your body releases
greater amounts of growth hormone, a key hormone in cell (read: muscle
cell) growth, increasing your total muscle mass. Who would've thought
that you could make your arms grow larger by doing squats?Additionally,
we're interested in building fully functional, whole body strength, as
well as an aesthetically pleasing, well-proportioned physique. Seeing a
bodybuilder with a large, muscular upper body and tiny chicken legs is
probably the oldest gym cliche in the book.2. You must strength train
with a sufficient level of effort.Of course, progression can be
achieved through false means. If I lift a 3 pound plastic-coated
dumbbell today, and lift a 5 pound one tomorrow, well, that's
technically &quot;progression&quot;, but it doesn't involve sufficient effort. In
order to stimulate muscle growth, the weight has to be heavy enough to
require significant effort. In other words, it has to make you work
hard.How heavy is heavy enough? How much effort is required? No one
really knows what the specific percentages are for sure, but a good
rule of thumb is it should feel difficult. If, on a 1-10 scale, 1 is
easy as pie and 10 is impossible - couldn't do it if I held a gun to
your head and said &quot;Lift.&quot; - the exercises should require an effort of
about an 8.3. You must allow sufficient time for recovery.Exercise is
not what causes bodily improvement. It is merely the stimulus for
improvement. What gives you a larger biceps or a smaller waistline is
your body's response to the exercise stimulus. By strength training,
you force a specific adaptation to occur; in this case, larger,
stronger muscles. It takes time for your body to make these changes.
According to studies, muscle repair appears to take place within a
24-72 hour window (with most authorities naming 48 hours as the window
for full recovery), but your mileage might vary. If you're a 16 year
old awash in testosterone and sleeping 10 hours a night, you will
recover much faster from a workout than a 57 year old father of three
who consistently skips breakfast. Leaving 48 hours between weight
training workouts, however, is a good rule of thumb.It helps to sleep,
as well. By getting a full night's rest, you maximize growth hormone
release, which, as we've seen, is a good thing for building
muscle.There is a fourth aspect - you must eat in a manner that
supports muscle growth - but I'm leaving it out of this discussion as
the previous three points have applicability to all fitness goals,
whether it's improved performance, a smaller waistline, or 18.5 inch
biceps. If you're interested in getting muscularly larger but it is a
goal that continues to elude you, you can finish up your reading with
this post.
