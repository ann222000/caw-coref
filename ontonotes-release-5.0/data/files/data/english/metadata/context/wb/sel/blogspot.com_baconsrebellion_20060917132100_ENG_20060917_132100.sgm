Light Sunday Reading II: "The Planning Penalty"
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

The American Dream Coalition, a think tank funded by Dulles-area
developer Chris Walker, has published a paper, " The Planning Penalty:
How Smart Growth Makes Housing Unaffordable ."

The starting premise of this report is that the price of the house
pictured above can vary region by region by as much as a factor of
eight. The four-bedroom home, which sold for $150,000 in Houston
recently, would cost as much as $300,000 in Portland, Ore., $600,000 in
Boulder, Colo., and $1.2 million in San Jose. Some of that difference
can be accounted for by demand -- some localities are simply more
desirable places to live. But most of the difference, argues the report,
can be explained by restrictions on housing supply associated with
"growth management."

What author Randal O'Toole calls the "planning penalty" can amount to
hundreds of thousands of dollars per dwelling. Writes O'Toole: "Between
1999 and 2005, regions with growth-management planning saw prices grow
by 4 to 11 percent per year, while regions without such planning saw
prices grow at only 1 to 3 percent per year."

Northern Virginia and increasingly Hampton Roads, it seems, have
devised the worst of both worlds. Segregation of land uses, low
densities and beggar-thy-neighbor planning by local governments has
created both high-cost housing and traffic congestion. Congratulations,
guys!

The solution is not giving more power to local governments. It is not
social engineering. What we need is a market-based solution that honors
consumer sovereignty -- homeowners would be free to live where they want
and in the kinds of community they want -- with the proviso that people
pay the locational costs associated with their choices .

The challenge for Virginia is to revamp funding mechanisms for roads,
utilities and public services in order to create a locationally level
playing field, and to give developers more freedom to innovate new types
of communities that address housing affordability and traffic congestion
in creative ways. Rather than micro-manage growth, planners should
define the "Balanced Communities" and "Clear Edges" (see Ed Risse's
writings for details), which provide the broad parameters within which
free markets would function.

Well, I suppose the guy who paid $1.2 million for that house in San
Jose is paying his locational costs.

I would agree that there is a planning "premium" that is in ADDITION
to supply/demand factors for locations.

The county proffers are about 20K.. so that cannot explain the
"affordability" issue.. other factors are in play.

Spotsylvania's growth rate is in the top 15 in the entire
country...and virtually all of it is due to "by-right" development that
does NOT require local Board of Supervisors approval. In other words the
thesis presented is a canard.

ALL of the exurbs that surround NoVa are bound by the Dillion Rule.

Here's two questions:

1.- what is Chris Walker's definition of "Affordable Housing"? Does
he consider apartments and other housing that is NOT traditional 1/2
acre SFHs?

2.- what would happen if Spotsylvania and other NoVa exurbs decided
to approve ALL residential rezones for 1/4 acre residential lots? Would
housing then become more affordable?

Doesn't this sound a LOT LIKE.. build more road capacity to improve
reduce congestion... but we can't tell you how how much to build.. just
build it until congestion goes away?

What Chris Walker is advocating is providing MORE 1/4 acre single
family homesites.. and that is HIS definition of more "affordable" (not
more affordable housing.. such as options OTHER than 1/4 acre homes.)

As one who has been in the planning profession for over 25 years, Mr.
O'Toole's arguments are nothing new. Even HUD during the Reagan years
published a similar report.

Any item we buy, from Fords to asprin, is increased in cost because
of regulation. No one would dispute that. Some regulations are put on by
the federal government, others, like those mentioned in Mr. O'Toole's
document, are the result of residents responding to their fear of the
"unknown" and pressuring their elected officials to pass the
"penalties." I guess one solution to the problems would be for Congress
to legislate one size fits all land use regulations.

I am sure that Mssrs. O'Toole and Walker would not like it if the
locality in which they lived suddenly repealed the zoning, subdivision
and other land development control regulations. The value of their
property would likely decrease without the planning "penalty."

It is good that the costs of these regulations are brought to the
attention of the public and elected leaders. Yes, safe and affordable
housing is a problem, but it is a universal problem from Wise County to
Fairfax County.

A place to sleep, eat and watch TV in may be housing, but it is
nowhere near as valuable as a place you can actually live in.

And yes, absolutely, if NOVA jurisdictions got outof the way or
streamlined processes there would be more housing and the prices would
be lower.

Two examples.

When I built my Alexandria home, on an existing lot with water and
sewer in place, it took me over 18 months to get a building permit, and
four months to get an accupancy permit. The actual cost of the
construction was only $90,000, but the cost of the delays was almost as
much as the construction costs, because in the meantime the mortgage
rate went from 6% to 10.5%, which I was stuck with for years. And those
costs there were in spte of there being no proffers involved.

In those hyper inflation days, the cost of construction went up
substantially, too. There was simply no excuse for what happened in the
planning office. Every tme I went there a new, non-English speaking,
subcontractor had my file, which was "lost" four times. Fairfax was in
it's slow growth phase in those days, and they would use any excuse to
delay construction.

Now, here I sit with substantial land available, and ostensible
rights to build. However, the county has thrown up so many barriers,
that I cannot, in fact, use the rights I have (left). If I could use
them, or even one of them, my low overhead situation would allow me to
build a very nice home for some local teacher or someone in that price
range.

Even if they had not already taken away all the rights I previously
had, except the ones remaining that I now cannot use; then a tleast I
could sell the excess rights assuming there was a market for them. But
those markets are also restricted.

There is no physical or environmental impediment to such construction
and no reason why I shouldn't be allowed to do it. Not being allowed to
do it is sereiously compromising my ability to care for the rest of the
place, and it is costing someone a home as well. The only reason I can't
do it is because of a political ideology.

If you want to have a political agenda, fine, but don't put the cost
on my back, and that of my friends who might like to rent space from me.

That's just two examples that I know of personally, but take that and
multiply it by all of NOVA and think of what it means.

Would there be other problems that develop as a result of having the
planning boards actually do their job, instead of merely obstructing,
obfuscating, and exhibiting authority for either the fun of it or worse,
to support some agenda that is not even related to community
development? Yes, of course.

But here is what I think. The official morons who have been
interfering with my life, and by extension that of my tenants, for the
last 20 years have made a life-long enemy out of me. Nothing is going to
convince me that what they have done is not wrong, wrong, wrong. They
can forget about ever seeing a supporting vote from me or anyone that I
can convince otherwise.

Do that to enough people over a big enough area, for a long enough
time, and eventually the pendulum will swing back, and swing back with a
vengeance. I'd like to see something that makes more sense than that,
something that results in better, more livable communities, rather than
more lawsuits.

I'd like to see more money spent on what we agree on than what we
don't agree on, with the result that we all live better for less. But I
don't think that is where we are heading.

"The value of their property would likely decrease without the
planning "penalty.""

Exactly. That is precisely the point. As the Boston Globe recently
reported:

"Homeowners form the largest interest group. For them, unaffordable
housing is not a problem; it increases the value of their portfolio.
Moreover, since any new development brings some inconvenience, most
homeowners prefer new construction in any community but their own.
Antigrowth homeowners get ideological cover from environmentalists who
do not care if housing is cheap or expensive as long as new homes don't
eliminate green space. They don't much like cars, either."

Now Bacon's rebellion has recently been accused of being apathetic
towrds asphalt, but I should point out that sterotypes don't get that
way by accident. If the shoe fits, wear it.

I'm not a big fan of Randall O'Toole, but I wouldnt mind seeing him
in a live debate, or better yet, mud wrestling with EMR. Either way it
should be good for a laugh, and about as intellectually stimulating.

Howver, Ed Glaeser, a professor of Economics at Harvard notse that
"Since 1950, housing prices have risen regularly by almost two percent
per year. Between

1950 and 1970, this increase reflects rising housing quality and
construction costs. Since

1970, this increase reflects the increasing difficulty of obtaining
regulatory approval for

building new homes.....Our preliminary evidence suggests that there
was a significant increase in the ability of

local residents to block new projects and a change of cities from
urban growth machines

to homeowners’ cooperatives."

At least Randall O'Toole has some support in his beliefs.
http://post.economics.harvard.edu/hier/2005papers/HIER2061.pdf#search=%22glaeser%20housing%20costs%22
I happen to think that Glaeser's statement is accurate. So does the
state of Massachusetts, because they have now passed regulations that
penalize local jurisdictions for being overly restrictive.

It is true. Anything we buy from Fords to Aspirin is increased in
cost because of regulation. BUT NO ONE SAYS YOU CANNOT BUILD A FORD.
Just that if you do, you must meet certains standards for safety. You
can build an airplane in your basement, if you want. But you may not be
able to build a basement.

No one is telling me I cannot build A SINGLE HOME on 170 acres for
reasons of safety. They are teLling me I cannot do it because THEY DON'T
WANT IT. Not that they don't want it now, not that they don't want it
for ten years, not that they are willing to grant me a concession when
I'm ninety. THEY DON'T WANT IT, EVER.

So, according to Glaeser and Gyourko, as much as half of the price of
housing in some jurisdictions is directly atributable to zoning
regulation. We are not talking about building codes, which are related,
ostensibly, to safety. We are talking about restrictive zoning
ordinances as a means of social engineering, for which the effectiveness
is far from demonstrated, unless you are talking about its effectiveness
at artificially enhancing value.

Apparently it is A-OK for the public to just screw a landowner if it
wants to protect "the public's interest in preserving the uniqueness" of
his property. Sorry, buddy, your 157 acres are now worthless to you
because we really really like looking at your property, and if you
develop it, we won't get to enjoy it as much.

For liberals, the collective always trumps the individual. If the
collective (the public interest) wants your property, it gets to take
it. The assumption is that this "public interest" is some kind of
organic, knowable element. In truth, it is simply an expression of
political power by whoever currently prevails in the current day
political institutions.

If that means this landowner is in effect forced to donate his land
for this purpose, so be it. It doesn't strike them as unfair that
individuals have to pay for something that supposedly benefits the
"public."

Why is it horribly unfair that the public should be required to pay
for things that are in the "public interest" ?

Should there should be no restraint on the "rules" the "public"
(read: the land use planners inside any municipality) can apply to your
property? Whatever rules they layer on, you just have to obey. If the
rule requires a 200 foot setback from a ditch that means you can't build
on your property, tough luck. If the rule is an environmental overlay
that prevents you from adding on to your house, tough luck.

The "public" should not be forced to pay for the private cost of the
rules. That is unfair to the public. Only thing is, as this article
shows, it is the public that pays the price anyway.

Gee.. it's very difficult not to see and understand the frustration
and I can directly sympathize because on a less scale.. I have similar
issues.

I have a measly 5 acres and when I bought it, it could be subdivided
into 2 lots as long as one was at least 2 acres.

You can guess what happened next... a new ordinance was passed that
took that right away.

On the other hand, I know what this was done - because each new home
was costing county taxpayers more than 20K and taxes were going to go up
to cover the shortfall. Not only 20K initially but annual operating
costs also.

The two primary culprits were schools and roads.

A relatively low growth rate (like 2% which is the State average)
allows existing residents to pay a little extra to keep up with roads
and schools but when the growth rate accelerates then the equation
changes drammatically and the locality has two choices:

1. - either raise taxes substantially or 2. - take actions to reduce
the growth rate and/or make growth pay for itself.

Voters .. NOT planning officials per se have a LOT to do with county
housing policies.

People will get voted out if they raise taxes too high and/or too
fast.

But what really puzzles me.. is that if the landowners are correct in
their assignment of blame for restricting their rights .. and each local
jurisdiction has MORE and MORE landowners - what haven't they spoken at
elections and voted in people who will take away the landowner
restrictions?

I would think that the landowners would put up a candidate .. finance
him/her.. have him/her go to every landowner and promise relief and that
person's election would be almost automatic...

For myself.. I'm a landowner but I would not vote for such a person
and I do not think I'm alone.. I'm probably in the majority.

So that's the challenge of the landowners who do feel unfairly
restricted... to convince other landowners until there is a clear
majority at elections.

Larry Gross said... “ the locality has two choices: 1. - either raise
taxes substantially or 2. - take actions to reduce the growth rate

What doesn’t happen in #2 is honesty. Too often indirect means
—gimmicks— are used. To slow growth, simply reduce the subdivisions per
time period. A direct, equitable slow-down of growth . Where subdivision
was once per year, the law can be amended to read once per 3 years, or 5
years....

Re your landowner conundrum. The puzzle is solved once you realize
that homes are residences; places to reside. Despite claims that they
are investments —claims stridently heard when nearby construction is
proposed— houses are not investments by their occupants; they are
primarily shelter.

The phenomenon is not uncommon, even in developments. [NY state
examples, probably not legal in Virginia] Once residents in a homeowners
association become a majority, they may vote against construction on
(their neighbors’) unbuilt lots.

In Fauquier county there are only two thousand farms, maybe 700 of
any real size. There are 65,000 other residents. Even if you got every
landowner, they would still be outnumbered by people who want to save
"their" lifestyle at someone else's expense.

In your case the county saved $20k. I don't know how that was
figured: Fauquier claims it is $2300 per year that they save. But they
are effectively renting that savings from you, in perpetuity or until
they give you your building right back. It seems to me they ought to at
least have the courtesy of paying you 5% interest on what they claim you
are saving them.

I imagine Spotsylvania also has a program for PDR's, as Fauquier
does. So here they are, in one case buying valuable property rights and
in another case simply stealing them. I can't see any way that is
ethically defensible.

If you look at the Too Conservative blog there are 91 entries
concering Loudoun's Zoning issues, and the comments are all over the
map. I beleive an awful lot of stuff gets railroaded through on the
basis of apathy and activism, that doesn't really have a lot of thought
behind it.

I've said before that I think the housing loses money argument is
contrived and weak, probably outright wrong. We may have an inequitabe
and screwball way of paying for the county budget, but one way or
another it is all paid by people who live in houses.

Same goes for roads. the way we have chosen to pay for them is
screwball and inequitable, but we chose to do it that way.

In either case, to then point at one side of the inequity and say,
hey, these guys aren't paying enough makes no sense to me. All the bills
we have for the roads we get are paid, and mostof the people doing the
paying are either road uses or road beneficiaries.

Argue that the inequities need to be addressed, but don't use the
fact that we have chosen to install these iequities to argue against
houses or roads. I think Jim Patrick is right, this line of argument is
fundamentally dishonest.

And, if you want to staart onthe inequities, I'd suggest that the
300% overtaxation of farmers would be a good place to start.

I'm not in disagreement about some of the discussion.

I think we need to recognize that everyone who owns land is a
landowner but that the ones most concerned about their "rights" are
those that have undeveloped land and view it as a financial asset that
they own and control.

The value of any asset is not guaranteed. Changes can happen that
directly affect the value of that asset.

It happens all the time. You own stock in a land-line phone company
and boom.. they're out of business because of cable and wireless.

New government regs can make the value of a stock of a company that
pollutes .. go belly up.. out of business.

Is this unfair and wrong?

I'm sure it can be viewed that way by the person whose asset's value
was affected but as I said - they are no guarantees and actually there
is a standard warning for stock investiments - the prospectus.

The value of land is very depending not only on WHERE it is but also
what infrastructure exists to serve it.

You can own 10,000 acres... 300 miles from a road and that land won't
be worth what ten acres is next to an Interstate with water/sewer and
high speed internet access. Is it somebody's "fault" that there is no
road nearby? Is it the responsibility of taxpayers to build that road to
your property?

In years past - taxpayers paid for infrastructure and many raw land
owners experienced "windfalls" as the infrastructure was built close
enough to their properties to make it more valuable.

They didn't work hard to get the payoff. They just happened to be in
the right place at the right time - and folks learned.... and
land-speculation became a way of gaining wealth. way back.. when the
rails went west.

Does the availability of that infrastructure make a "right" to
develop adjacent land without "interference" from the government (which
is, in fact, representative of ALL taxpayers "rights")?

I maintain that a landowners "rights" stop at their property lines.
If they need infrastructure then it becomes a public issue and the
public's right to determine when/where/how/ infrastructure will be
provided because that infrastructure is paid for by the public.

Using "available" (existing) infrastructure is still "using"
infrastructure that was paid for by someone other than the landowner and
if we are talking "equity" then let's indeed keep straight what the
equities are.

Apparently some landowners think that it is their "right" to have
their infrastructure needs paid for by the public.

The problem that we have with roads, schools, libraries, fire/rescue
is that unlike water/sewer we don't capitalize them in such a way as to
know the actual costs well enough to assess them.. AND .. to be honest..
landowners of undeveloped land are OPPOSED to such fees anyhow.. Impact
Fees are Infrastructure Fees and those folks lobby against them every
year int he General Assembly and then landowners cry about the
unfairness of restricting their development "rights".

You can't have it both ways in my view. Pick a path. If you want to
develop - be prepared to pay the costs and not seek to have those costs
paid by others.

Larry, your asset argument doesn't hold water. If I own ten shares of
stock, the value may go up and down, but I still own ten shares of
stock.

If I own ten building rights, that camw with the property when I
bought and paid for it, the values of those buildingrights may also go
up and down.

But if the government came and took eight of your stock shares, you
would think they were stealing from you. If the government takes ten of
your building rights, then they are stealing just as well.

We are not talking about the guy who has two building rights and asks
for a hundred, we are talking about the guy, like you, that had two and
now has one.

You will never convince me that is not wrong. The county sets
themselves up as part of the land transaction by recording the deed. It
is their responsibility to protect people and property. The building
rights that come with a property should be protected just as the
boundaries are protected.

Now, suppose you have your two building rights, and the county passes
a new regulation that leaves you your building rights, but the reg is
intentionally passed with intent to make them worthless, say they set
your minimum drainfield size at two acres, knowing it will eliminate
hundreds of lots. If it is a true safety issue, then that's one thing,
but if there is a conscious decision to make one reg and another
overlay, etc. etc., then that is a stealth attack on property rights and
it is just as dishonest as stealing. This is what happened in Oregon,
and why the voters finally revolted, twice.

A regulation that is necessary for public safety, that is desinged to
prevent damge oustise your "property line" if you will, is one thing,
but simply confiscating your property or confiscating your property
under the guise of public necessity is something else.

When the spotted owl regulations came into effect a lot of woodland
owners went out and cut down all the trees favored by the spotted owl
because they knew that if one was seen on their property, all was lost.
That would not have happened and the owl would have been safer if the
regs had been designed fairly and if it hadn't been obvious that the
regs were being mis-used.

I also don't buy the argument that the infrastructure was paid for by
someone else. The farm has been paying taxes for decades, and even the
county says that farms pay 300% of what they owe in taxable services.
Where did the money go?

Surely, you are not going to argue that houses don't pay their way,
but at the same tame they are the ones that paid for all that
infrastructure?

The roads get paid for, they are not free. The infrastructure gets
paid for, it is not free. The schoools get paid for, they are not free.
We have a screwed up and inequitable system for footing the bills, but
the bills get paid.

Just because we have a screwed up method of paying the bills is no
excuse for telling someone that we are going to steal your existing
building rights because you aren't paying your fair share!

When we can sort out who really pays for what and wht the costs
really are, and when we set impact fees for those costs that actually
cross your property line, then I'd agree, let's set impact fees and be
done with it.

But, once we achieve that Nirvana, then what argument will you use to
prevent devlopment? After all, the builders will be paying their own
way. There will be no reason to prevent growth at will except for
environmental and conservation reasons, and those people can be expected
to pay their own full costs as well.

And, if it is fair to pay impact fees for costs you incur on others,
why isn't it fair for others to pay impact fees when they incur costs on
you, like taking your building right?

And, by the way, I am located next to an interstate, within a mile of
an exit, it was built on property that was once part of the farm, and
for which the state paid the princely summ of $200 per acre. In spite of
that, I still had my development rights restricted, whereas any place
else in the state I would probably be zoned light industrial.

I don't see where internet access is any product of the government,
and I sure don't see any "windfall" happening around here. Even if that
windfall happens some day, I don't see that you can call it a windfall
when the money has been invested and the taxes paid for over a hundred
and fifty years! You actually think that would be a windfall?

If the county told me what my impact fees were, I might not like it,
but it would be bettter than the current situation which is, we will let
you do nothing, ever. But, if they are going to have impact fees then
they are also going to have to deal with (or calculate out) all the
other ineqities that make impact fees appear to be necessary under our
present screwed up system of paying for what we get.

And we do pay for what we get. You may not like the method under
which this happens, but you cannot deny that the bills get paid. Roads
get paid for by people who use and benefit from roads. Infrastructure
gets paid for by people who use and benefit from the infrastructure. The
system we use is screwed up - I don't have any children - why should I
pay the 60% of taxes that support schools?

But just because the system is screwed up doesn't mean that you can
single out one party and say they are getting a windfall. We elected
representatives who designed that windfall into the system. So, just as
landowners are free to go object and vote, so are those that see
inequities and windfalls.

Trying to please everybody is exactly how our represntatives came up
with the system we have, whn all they had to do was be fair and honest,
with rules that people can understand. Like Stealing is Wrong. Forcing
others to do work for you without payment is wrong.

That doesn't seem so hard to me.

Monterey County, California, is a classic example, though by no means
unique. A recent story in the Wall Street Journal quoted residents of
that coastal community as saying how much they liked its lifestyle and
ambiance — as a justification of laws that make it nearly impossible for
anyone with less money to live there.

First of all, laws forbid building anything on three-quarters of the
land in that county. Existing residents who support such laws don’t own
that land but they can politically keep others from living on it, which
is the whole point of much rhapsodizing about “preserving” this and
“saving” that.

Land prices skyrocket when the supply of land is arficially and
drastically reduced, which means that housing prices become
astronomical. The consequences for those on the outside looking in were
illustrated by the story of a farm worker in Monterey County whose
family had been living in a room for years but who now could finally
afford to buy a small house.

This farm worker was described as “thrilled” to the point of tears as
he bought a 1,013-square-foot home for $490,000, even though it would
take 70 percent of his income to make the mortgage payments. He planned
to rent out one of the rooms to try to make ends meet.

His situation was not as unusual as it would be in most other places.
The average share of income required for someone with the average income
in Monterey County to buy the average home there is 60 percent.

But of course this does not apply to the existing residents who
bought or inherited their homes in years past. Far from suffering
economically from the laws they pass, they see the market values of
their own homes go up by leaps and bounds.

One of these residents describes herself as a liberal Democrat

and an ardent environmentalist. Election results in this and

other affluent counties in coastal California suggest that she

is very much the norm among the new nomenklatura.

The green nomenklatura talk egalitarianism like the old red

nomenklatura and similarly ride roughshod over others while

doing it. ”

"But if the government came and took eight of your stock shares, you

.... Ray .. they're not taking your land anymore than they're taking
your shares because your "rights" do not include freezing in place all
laws and regs that affect the value of your holdings whether they be
stock or land.

You're claiming the equivalent of freezing all laws and regs that
affect the value of your stocks to be what they were when you bought
those shares because those are your "rights".

As time goes by - new laws and regs are written all the time by
governments at the Fed, State and Local levels that can have direct
impacts the value of your holdings.

And I admit that whether or not such laws/regs are "takings" is a hot
debated subject but you were never entitled to have your land rezoned in
the first place and the concept rezoning is based on what impacts will
result off property as a result of the rezoning.

The term "building rights" ... implies a "right to build" but it
really is not about an administrative process building a new barn,etc
it's about subdividing the land and/or how many net lots a parcel can
yield after determinations are made with respect to land that cannot be
developed say for drainfield reasons, etc.

IF .. it is determined that drainfield size can affect public health
.. in other words.. over time... a too-small drainfield will probably
fail and result in polluted runoff... then I think you don't have the
"right" to pollute.

If the argument is essentially that your version of acceptable
risk/protection is different from the state/localitie's idea then fine
but unless you are a credentialed expert and can demonstrate that the
state/locality is wrong.. then they continue to have the protect the
public's "right" of not allowing insufficiently-sized drainfields to be
built that ultimately will fail and become a public responsibility.

If new evidence comes to light.. that current drainfield size are too
small.. then they can act in public's interest.

What you are arguing is that.. a drainfield size determined to be
"OK" 50 years ago.. is a "right" that cannot be changed.

re:I also don't buy the argument that the infrastructure was paid for
by someone else. The farm has been paying taxes for decades, and even
the county says that farms pay 300% of what they owe in taxable
services. Where did the money go?"

MOST of your taxes go for recurring.. operational expenses for
maintenance. For instance - the road that serves your farm - has to be
maintained... ditched... repaired... plowed.. re-paved, etc. THAT's
where your taxes go.

What you are arguing is that any amount of taxes that you pay will
actually cover the expenses for both maintenance and new improvements.

re: "The roads get paid for, they are not free. The infrastructure
gets paid for, it is not free."

Where does the money come from to expand the road in front of your
property when your property and others like it are developed for more
homes?

Right now - no one seems to know because the State no longer has the
resources and most localities do not have a procedure in place to
recover those costs. There is no "availability" fee for roads like there
is for water/sewer.

That "availability" fee for water/sewer - goes directly into a
Capital Facilities Fund to build new infrastructure. This approach
assures that as new development takes place - that funds are set aside
to improve the system once it reaches capacity.

We have no such equivalent for roads.

I feel that if we actually had such an equivalent for roads that
"restrictions" on growth would ease.

It's the main reason why localities want to keep you and others from
developing your property.

In fact.. if you check out the bills in front of the GA .. you'll
find that the Rust Bill for Northern Va ...

"Most of the increases would affect visitors (an increase in the
hotel and car rental tax) and builders (an impact fee for each new house
built)."

The Bill's prospected with regard to passage... might be
problematical.. but I think this points out that at least some
legislators ... also believe that there has to be a connection between
new homes and transportation infrastructure.

No Larry, I'm talking about actual rights that were previously posted
and promised by the government which, having done so, is responsible for
protecting my property. If the government says, OK, now we need to have
400 sq ft for septic drainage becasue we have learned that 200 sq. ft.
is insufficient for reasons of public safety, then that is different.
That makes my lot more expensive to build on, and worth less maybe, but
it doesn't eliminate my lot or the right to have it.

But if the government is buying rights from some people (which they
are) and taking them from other people (You used to have ten rights and
now you have two, all other regs stay the same) then that is stealing.
End of story.

Where it gets fuzzy is when the government deliberately creates new
regulations that they know will have the effect of eliminating building
rights, and when the value of those new regs is questionable. Even if
such a reg eliminates my ability to use the right, the right still
exists and I ought to be able to sell it to someone who can use it, but
that isn't what happens.

Or suppose my neighbor has plenty of land, I can buy an easement and
put my septic field on his property, except the rules don't allow tha,
either, because the real intent is to eliminate the building rights, not
to ensure that people have adequate septic. Your argument has some merit
where true safety regulations are concerned, but the fact is that they
are often used cynically and incorrectly.

Property rights are widely recognized as being a bundle of sticks.
Clearly if you take one of my sticks you have taken part of my property.
If you take one and then another and another, pretty soon all is lost.

Under present law, a loss is not considered to have happened until it
is total loss, or nearly so. Gradually that concept has been chipped
away at, but it is exceedingly difficult to sue, because you must be
first turned down for every possible administrative relief. A bill is
under consideration now to change that.

You are right. The government obviously has the ability to change the
rules. But in Oregon, when the rules were changed back or eased, the
environmentalists were screaming bloody murder. You can't allow my
neighbor to build, they said, I bought this place with the understanding
I would have a pristine view: I demand to be compensated. So, we agree
the government has the right to make new rules and losers shold be
compensated when they do.

All we have to argue about now is what the start date is.

I agree the government is allowed to make new rules. Therefore it
should not be allowed to make rules that cannot be undone. This is the
situation in Fauquier. The government has a rule that says I can only
develop 15% of my land. That is OK, except the should have compensated
me for the loss on the other 85% when they made the rule.

Nevertheless, the rule is in place. So, I ought to be able to build
on the other 15% provided I meet all the other regs, right?

Not so. In order to be allowed to build on that 15%, I must first
proffer a conservation easement on the remainder, and give that to the
government. The government then turns around and gives it to a
nongovernment agency. They do this specifically, and have said as much,
so that some future government cannot undo their rule.

Clearly, if the government has the right to change the rules, this is
wrong. It eliminates the right of future electees to do the will of
their future constituents. It puts the current government in control of
future constituents from out of the grave, even.

In this case the government has said I may not build on 85%, and I
obviously won't. But in addition they want me to agree that this rule
can never be changed, to give up the rights they previously stole,
permanently. And they want me to do this in order to exercise a right
that I allegedly still have. Besides that, they are giving away what is
now valuable public property.

What I have is a right that I must to pay to use, what kind or right
is that? Didn't we go through that with voting rights, alrady? And I
must pay it under duress, to create a condition we both agree is wrong:
preventing the government from changing the rules. Since the government
has already said I cannot build on 85% of the land, and they are in a
position to prevent it, then why is giving them a conservation easement
which they give to someone else necessary?

It is not necessary to prevent the land from being built on, it is
necesary to create a government rule that can't be undone, and the
current pactitioners have said as much.

Maybe it is because someone else gave big campaign contributions to
get their guy elected.

Like I said, a rule that changes the value of my stock is not the
same as simply taking my stock. In may case the government has done
both.

As for the cost of services, you simply cannot make the argument that
residences don't pay their way, and then say that those people who
aren't paying their way have somehow paid for roads that make your
development possible. That because you now have a windfall, you must pay
them back for all the money they invested, or will invest on your
behalf. (magically invested, since they aren't paying their way.)

If that is the argument, fine, then set the price and let me build.
But the argument is cynical because what they really want is for you not
to build, in order that they can have what they want without paying for
it.

If you want to make one argument or the other, fine, pick one and
apply it universally. I don't care which one. But you cannot have it
both ways and ethically live with yourself. < $BlogBacklinkSnippet$>
