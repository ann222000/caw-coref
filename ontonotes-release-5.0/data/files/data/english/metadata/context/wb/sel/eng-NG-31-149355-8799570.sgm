I got this little piece of information from my EX. From the subject line, I
thought he had a stroke, but it is a very useful piece of information for
anyone over 25, years that is. So enjoy and be alert to little tell tale
signs.

*New Sign of a Stroke -- Stick out Your Tongue*

*STROKE: **Remember The 1st Three Letters.... **S.T.R.**
*
*If everyone can remember something this simple, we could save some folks.
Seriously.. Please read:** *
*STROKE IDENTIFICATION:** *
*During a BBQ, a friend stumbled and took a little fall - she assured
everyone that she was fine (they offered to call paramedics) .....she said
she had just tripped over a brick because of her new shoes. They got her
cleaned up and got her a new plate of food. While she appeared a bit shaken
up, Ingrid went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening. Ingrid's
husband called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the
hospital - (at 6:00 pm Ingrid passed away.) She had suffered a stroke at the
BBQ. Had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke, perhaps Ingrid
would be with us today. Some don't die.... they end up in a helpless,
hopeless condition instead.** *
*It only takes a minute to read this...** *
*A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he
can totally reverse the effects of a stroke...totally. He said the trick was
getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed, and then getting the patient
medically cared for within 3 hours, which is tough.** *
*RECOGNIZING A STROKE** *
*Thank God for the sense to remember the '3' steps, STR . Read and Learn!**
*
*Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately,
the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe
brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke**
**.*
*Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple
questions:** *
*S * **Ask the individual to SMILE.** *
*T * **Ask the person to TALK and SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE(Coherently) (I.e.
It is sunny out today)** *
*R * **Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS.** *
*NOTE: Another 'sign' of a stroke is this: Ask the person to 'stick' out his
tongue. If the tongue is 'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other** **,
**that is also an indication of a stroke. *
*If he or she has trouble with** **ANY ONE of these tasks, call 911
immediately and describe the** **symptoms to the dispatcher.** *
*A cardiologist says if everyone who gets this e-mail sends it to** **10
people; you can bet that at least one life will be saved.** *
