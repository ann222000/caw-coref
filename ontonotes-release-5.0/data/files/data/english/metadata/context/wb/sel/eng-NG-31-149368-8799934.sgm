Hi All,
Arranging a trip for the kids to Infosys campus marked Independence Day celebrations at Prarambh. The idea was to let kids see the world outside their homes and locality.

Saturday: 11th August
*         On Saturday, though kids' strength was good, volunteers' count was low. Only Chacika and Ashish were there. Both of them conducted class in an effective manner.
*         8th standard kids had stayed back in the school for their extra classes therefore they did not turn up for classes.
*         Chacika and Ashish took a joint session of all the kids and told them about the Independence Struggle of India. Kids listened to all this with great interest.

Sunday: 12th August

*         Chacika taught Pooja, Kajal, Bhavana, Mumtaj, Neelam and Damini about English Comprehension. Also, she made them learn spellings and Hindi meanings of different words in the paragraph, she had taught during comprehension.

*         Ashish and Shachin had a talk with elder kids regarding their studies, future plans, etc. Discussion gave an insight about the thinking of kids about present scenario and their future planning.

*         Nirmal managed younger kids who were trying to disturb others, who were studying. He engaged them with dance practice and computer practice.

Wednesday: 15th August: The Independence Day
Arranging a trip for the kids to Infosys campus marked Independence Day celebrations at Prarambh. The idea was to let kids see the world outside their homes and locality.

*   We were at the Infosys campus at 11am; all kids were in awe of the magnificent campus of Infosys. The space ships and globe shaped offices were something that the kids were seeing, for the first time.
*   Infosys had also called in other children (of construction laborers). We began the day with trying to get the two groups mingle with each other.
*   Gaurav then started the proceedings with a brief note on the significance of 15th August followed by our national anthem.
*   Then we had a puppet show organized by a team of doctors from Bharti Vidyapeethh. They had prepared a small play to highlight some basic hygiene habits such as cleanliness, eating habits and mannerisms. This was a very good way to impart such values to the kids!
*   The puppet show was followed by a drawing competition. Groups were formed based on age. Kids, as always, were more than excited to display their coloring skills, we got to see some beautiful color combinations. See attached snaps.
*   Then, there was a medical checkup for all the kids. The doctors noted down all basic health parameters and helped kids to understand their health and also to maintain the same. Kids were also taught how to wash their hands, use the toilets, nail cutting etc.
*   All this activity made sure that our stomachs were growling:). HJW-Foundation had also arranged snacks for everybody.
*   Finally, it was prize distribution time; the winners of the drawing competition were announced. Mr. Satish Kulkarni distributed Prizes among winners. The winners really enjoyed the applause they received from the audience. :)
*   With activities coming to an end, we took the kids for a walk across the campus. The Infosys staff was really co-operative and we were able to take the kids inside the buildings. The beautiful architecture, lifts, flooring and lighting; everything was amazing that kids really felt good being there!

The purpose of this visit was purely to motivate the kids and to understand the 'good' life that exists on the other side of the spectrum. We just hope that what they saw that day makes them aspire to work in such areas in future. We hope that this thought will make them work harder to realize their dreams!!

It was an eventful Independence Day we all enjoyed it to the core! Happy Independence Day to you all
