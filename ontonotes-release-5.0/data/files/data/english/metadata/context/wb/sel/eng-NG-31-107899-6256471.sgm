Hi all.  I was wondering how does an external converter like the
Benchmark ADC1 connect up to computer?

http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/adc1/

If you click the top right picture it blows up the back.

Some other similar converters:

http://www.mercenary.com/addaconversion.html

If the unit doesn't have firewire or USB how does it connect with the
computer?  Do you connect the output directly to a digital input on
any capable sound card such as a SoundBlaster Xfi?  If you do go
through such a card does it affect the sound or is the file already
digital and can't be degraded?  I really don't know much about these
converters as I've never used one so any clarification you can offer
would be appreciated, thanks.

Right now I'm using an Aardvark Direct Pro 24/96 and am looking to
replace it with something with better converters.  Also Aardvark went
out of business and there is no stable driver for Windows XP.  So
right now I'm looking at the Lynx Two and the Benchmark ADC1.  Any
recommendations or opinions on other converters?

It has a standard S-PDIF or AES/EBU interface which is designed to carry
digital audio, not some cheesy USB crap.

If you want to plug it directly into a computer, you will need to put
a sound card in the computer with a standard S-PDIF or AES/EBU interface.

S-PDIF and AES/EBU are digital interfaces.  They predate USB by... well...
at least a decade.  They are specifically designed for streaming realtime
audio data over.

The ADC1 is a good quality converter, and has a lot of bang for the
buck.  Lavry makes some good equipment in a similar price range, but
I think anything much better is going to cost you.

Julian,

Understand that it takes an ADC and an audio-to-computer interface to get
audio into your computer.

A lot of the lower/mid range interfaces have both combined into one box, so
it can seem like it's the same thing.

By the way, Benchmark just announced a new version of the DAC-1 that has a
USB interface built in:

http://benchmarkmedia.com/

Hope that clears things up for you.

Thanks guys, I understand better now.  I've never seen S-PDIF or AES
before so it's new to me.

So you're saying even with this unit I need a sound card that has an
AES or S/PDIF input.  Does the quality of the sound card matter?  I'm
guessing no, because the signal is already created in digital format.
I don't see any low end cards with these types of inputs though.  So
even if I get a unit like this, I still need to get a card like the
Lynx Two?

No, you need a sound card with AES or S/PDIF output. The output of the
sound card is still in digital form, and the DAC1 (that stands for
DIGITAL to ANALOG CONVERTER) turns it into analog form which you can
listen to.

Just in case you misunderstand the whole concept, the DAC1 works in
one direction only. It's an output device. You can't plug an
microphone into it and record to the computer. For that you need a
companion ANALOG to DIGITAL CONVERTER (Benchmark makes one, the ADC1)
which takes an analog input, converts it to AES/EBU or S/PDIF, and
that goes into the computer via the sound card.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

In general, no, but the care with which the driver is written might
matter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Not exclusively. The reason for that is that most low end users want
analog inputs and outputs for general use (microphones or line level
sources in, headphones or loudspeakers out), and the digital I/O is so
that they can connect a device with a digital input or output, for
example, an MP3 player, without going through a conversion to analog
to get out of the player, then back to digital to get into the sound
card. But you'll find mid-range sound cards (and sound lumps - a box
connected to the computer via Firewire or USB) that have digital I/O
as well as analog.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Lynx Two?

The A/D and D/A converters on the LynxTWO are very good. Maybe not
quite as good as the Benchmark, but very close. If you were to get a
Lynx card, you could save your money and not get the Benchmark, at
least for a while. (Yeah, sour grapes - I didn't win a DAC1 in their
giveaway) However, there are some other choices that have lesser
quality analog outputs (and inputs) but offer a digital output. The M-
Audio Audiophile 2496, which goes for about $100 offers S/PDIF in and
out as well as fair-to-middlin' analog I/O, would work fine.

The reason why people buy converters like the DAC1 is because this is
what you actually listen to when recording and mixing, and you want
that to be as accurate as possible. It's great to have a really fine A/
D converter so what what goes into your recording is of excellent
quality, but it's more important to be able to hear accurately just
what it is that you're recording and mixing. If there's anything wrong
with the sound, you don't want it to be masked by mediocre quality
playback.

Thanks for your reply.  Haha, yeah I love the sound of vinyl records.
I have a small collection of some favorite classics.

I wrote an email to Benchmark, I think Wednesday, with some questions
and got no response so I'm not really so enthusiastic about them right
now.  The unit I was looking at though was the ADC1 (Analog to
Digital) since I need something to make the high quality conversion
from analog to digital.  Thanks for the explanation.  I understand
that part, I just wasn't sure how to connect it up to my computer or
what was the standard way of doing so.  I'm also concerned about
bottlenecks to the sound quality.  I don't see the point of getting
something as good as the ADC1 and then having a cheap sound card that
will limit it.  But if the sound card is just acting as a bridge to
transfer a digital file, without introducing noise or limiting the
potential, then maybe I can get away with spending less.

"The M-Audio Audiophile 2496, which goes for about $100 offers S/PDIF

So if I get something like that in combination with a high quality
external converter you think it will work as well as a Lynx Two with a
high quality external converter?  I just don't want to get something
cheap that will be a bottleneck to the quality if I have to replace it
in the end.  So maybe I should get the Lynx Two regardless for its
playback ability as well.

Sorry, I misread it. I wish they would use more different names for
these things. But they both interface the same way. And still, it's
important to have a good D/A converter so you can hear what you're
doing rather than take it on faith.

No reason why not. It's hard to define "just as good" but they should
be comparable. The advantage of using an outboard converter is that
you can get a better one when the need arises. But the LynxTWO also
has AES/EBU inputs and outputs, so you can use its own converters
(which, I can assure you, are very, very good) without any extra
haywire, and if you decide you want to try to find something better,
it's easy to hook up an external one like the Benchmark, feed the same
signal to both, and listen to them side by side.

I suppose you could buy a Lynx and a Benchmark, compare them, and:

If you decide you like the Benchmark better, return the Lynx and buy
an M-Audio Audiophile card (but you'll lose the good Lynx analog
output)

or

If you decide that you like the Lynx better (or they're so close you
don't care), return the Benchmark and just go with the Lynx.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; playback ability as well.

I think that's a very good plan. Also, compare the LynxTWO and L22.
Their electrical performance is very close, but the L22 will save you
some money. The TWO has more channels of I/O (eight, as I recall,
which you can split up as four in/four out, two in/six out, or six in/
two out) and has SMPTE time code, but for straight audio in and out
(the L22 has both analog and AES/EBU digital) they're pretty close.

An L22 is under $700. A Benchmark ADC1 is $1800. I don't know all
about you, of course, but since you're not yet deep enough into it to
have been making some of your own comparisons, I think the Lynx is a
much better approach for you. Excellent analog audio in and out, plus
an upgrade path when you're ready. You can get a better A/D converter
first (if you can find one) and still have the good Lynx analog
output, and perhaps later upgrade the output with a better D/A
converter. And hopefully you'll have got enough mileage out of it so
you won't be kicking yourself for buying a $700 card when a $100 card
(with outboard converters) would have worked.

I haven't read anything bad about the Lynx Two, that's good.  What did
you mean by jitter Daniel?  Do you think by passing through a low
quality soundcard jitter would be introduced to the signal, even if
the card isn't doing the analog to digital conversion?

Would it sound something like CD quality audio turned into low bit
rate mp3's or something along those lines?  I suppose the only way to
avoid such jitter is to use an external converter with a good sound
card, use the sound card alone, or use one of the newer converters
that don't require an additional soundcard by using USB or Firewire?

My dear, I do not know why a digital cable connection cannot copy 100%.

I know when I copy a wav from one point of the Harddisk to an other,
it does not loose Sound quality. Even when parting it into many Floppy
Disks and expanding them back on an other PC does not distort the wav.

Not copying Music realtime is the Solution. I don't know why Digital is
so slow with that case.

But you need analog into computer, so far I understood your lines.
Well, then lookout for a Card with a decent A/D Chip. Or try them out!!?
My local High End dealer gives me Cables, Amps and even Loudspeakers
with me, to try them out for further investigation.

It's possible that a weaker A/D chipped card, sounds better than the
decent one (better circuitry, discrete analog in and outs, etc.).
Listening them would open your mind.
Or ask the dealer if he would like to copy a certain analog record from
you to wav-file, with the Soundcard. Afterwards you can listen them
Easy, step by step with your CD-Player. (e.g. Turntable System-Tests are
recorded to CD and you can easy listen the various timbres for the
tested pickups) ;-)

The CD is better. You can hear the differencies of the best pickups....
:-))) o.k., just a joke!!

Best regards,

Daniel Mandic

P.S.: How about an old decent ISA-BUS Soundcard and some dedicated,
real-time OS operating (plain DOS, MS-DOS for example, nothing
serious...) Software. (forget NT and other COM-OS'es for Music. Such
are made for doing many tasks in the same time [com, communication],
not really something for Music Enthusiasts, except you prefer
Software-Synheizer. MIDI is running very well under DOS. I don't know

&gt; My local High End dealer gives me Cables, Amps and even Loudspeakers

&gt; It's possible that a weaker A/D chipped card, sounds better than the

Thanks for the advice Daniel.

"My dear, I do not know why a digital cable connection cannot copy
100%."  That's what I thought too but I ended up getting a converter
that has firewire so I can bypass the PCI card and go straight in.  I
will test it and see if I can hear a difference when the equipment
arrives.  I'll still need something like the Lynx Two for playback
though.  It seems to me the information will not be safe as pure
digital information until it's a file in the computer.  So by going
through an additional device before this step seems like a chance to
degrade the purity of the initial signal with jitter or other noise.
Correct me if I'm wrong though by all means, I'm just extrapolating
here, that's why I'm asking the question.  ;)

I found this thread especially useful to narrow it down:

http://gearslutz.com/board/archive/index.php/t-22089.html

The DCS was hard to find in the US and it seems to have a bad repair
history.

I decided the no nonsense approach and went for a Weiss ADC2.  I made
the mistake of going for cheap stuff in the past that I needed to
replace.  The good stuff I buy lasts.  Since this unit will effect my
entire setup I didn't want to skimp on it.  Was looking at the DCS
907, Cranesong HEDD, Prism Dream AD2.  I scoured the internet for
threads on these and reviews and thought the Weiss was the best choice
for me.

Thanks for all your help guys.

Yet I found a fitting sentence ;-). Realtime Playback is not clocked by
crystals (CPU, MHz etc.).

But it seems, Digital do have troubles with cables, too. ;-)

For example: A Lightcable (fibre) is not always the best dig-cable.
Maybe with expensive Hardware, which do have high-end opto-couplers!

Many swear to the std. Dig. Coax-cables, as I do.
I have built (soldered) a High-End coax cable for my friend (Home
Cinema, Dolby Digital Cable, DVD-to-Receiver) and we wiped floor with
my cable, versus his old ~150bucks expensive, so called High-End
Dig-Cable, also Coax.
His old made pffrt, pffrt Bass, and then Brrrm, Brrrrm. Round and deep.
(I was totally amazed. I knew the cable should be good, as mentioned in
a High-End Magazine, but that it beats such an expensive cable
'brand-name' so far...)

I took a fine, seemingly with a good thick copper wire, Antenna Cable.
Because, not every cheap Coax 75Ohm (75Ohm waves-resistance) Cable is a
Hit, some looking is obviously!
....75Ohm Std. Television Antenna Cable (1 Meter ~1buck), then, a bit
better Cinch Connectors (Gold plated, ~15bucks each), voila. My secret
TIP!!! Total ~32bucks :-), some solder and some watts energy.

Yes, please from my Side.

Hope my cable-info can help you.....

You said good, to check the stuff by ears. Cables, even the Digital are
audible. Digital cables, it seems to me, sometimes with even more 'aha'

IMHO.

I need more references to this. No pun intended, Daniel.

Having read most of the other threads here, I'm seriously considering an
M-audio lightbridge, and go with an external converter via lightpipe.
All in here seems to have only good things to say about the lightbridge.
I haven't yet decided on which AD/DA, though.

Something I've missed WRT possible problems with lightpipes?
I just don't wan't to get myself in trouble.

There is nothing "wrong" with fibre-optic interconnections.
The very highest speed networking and hard drives use
fibre-optic (vs. copper of any kind).  My whole part of
town was recently "wired" with fibre-optic cables. There
are several hundred strands smaller than a pin that go
down the street by my house. They terminate several
miles away and provide amazing bandwidth and accuracy.

Hobbyists fooling around with their stereo systems in the
basement can work themselves into believeing whatever
they wish. Doesn't have any reference to reality.

Even cheap extruded plastic Toslink cables with ~$1
sending and receiving transducers at each end are more
than capable of transferring digital audio without any
significant issues. In fact, exactly the same technology
is used for professional equipment to transmit 8 channels
(i.e. Alesis "Lightpipe")

Have you actually used Lightpipe?  It has some significant issues...
and admittedly they are made a lot worse by the poor clock management
in the ADATs.

Fibre optics are great.... one of the wonderful things about single mode
fibre is that you can get such wide bandwidth and low jitter specs, which
is why the telecom guys like it so much.  Toslink, though, was not such
a good idea.

I use 4 Toslink lightpipes with a 02R96 and couple of ADA 8000s. Again,
ADAT protocol. It just works. My home stereo uses Toslink  lightpipe to
isolate the serious audio from the video equipment. It just works.

The biggest problem I see with lightpipe is that the connectors and *cable*
is not nearly as robust and foolproof as say, an XLR mic cable.

Over 15 years ago, when plastic fiber was pretty new, I did some experiments
with transferring an HF signal. The original transmitters could do up to a
couple of MHz over up to 30 feet. I tuned one transmitter with some extra
components and I also polished the ends of the fiber exactly perpendicular
to the the fiber. Instead of using the supplid polishing paper I used a sort
of lime stone block normally used to hone chisels (think grit 16000). All
this resulted in a limit of 12MHz over 250 feet of fibre.

What I learned from this is that simply cutting the fibre with a sharp
Stanley knife with a new blade is not enough to get maximum performance.
Polishing the ends shiny and exactly perpendicular to the fibre is doing
great things for the maximum bandwith. This effectively gives the digital
audio signal steeper flanks and less clock jitter. Oh and sharp radii
smaller than 1" just ruin the cable. It produces microscopic fractures at
the surface of the fibre, ruining the reflection.

It's rated for use up to something like five meters, but actually DOING
that is an adventure.  With only 1m or so it's fine, but that isn't
long enough to even go from the top to the bottom of a rack let alone
between racks.

S-PDIF you can run a couple thousand feet over foamcore coax and it's
all just fine.  AES/EBU should be good for at least a few hundred feet.
A competing format that is limited to a meter or two is not very
competitive.

Actually, the cheap plastic stuff (which actually has fiber in it,
unless there's something different in the world now) is rated for 10
meters. The real glass fiber stuff doesn't use the TOSLink connectors.
There are adapters with drivers such as the system that Hosa sells
that can run a couple of hundred feet and there are audiophoole
TOSLink cables that put glass fiber into connectors that fit TOSLink
jacks, but the connector is really a big part of the problem.

No, there's nothing wrong with using fiber-optics for moving that sort
of data. It doesn't matter if it gets delayed by a few picoseconds, as
long as it gets there. But it's different with audio.

The plastic fiber optic cables that are used (because they're
inexpensive) have internal reflections that cause very slight timing
errors in the data rate. This is important for data going into the
recorder because if it's jerky going in, it will be jerky forever.
When it comes out, it goes through another piece of fiber (or at least
it might) and a D/A converter before it hits your ears, and modern
converters do a pretty good job of clocking the data properly so that
large errors become small errors, but there's only so much they can
do. And different converters have different clocking accuracies. This
is the sort of behavior that makes the CD that you give to the client
sound different than what you hear in the control room.

The reason why you don't have any problems with your HD24 is because
you don't know what you're missing until you compare it to something
else. Just because it sounds OK to you doesn't mean that it isn't a
problem to someone else. We all have our own threshold of "sucks."

Its one thing to optimize an "eye pattern", but I'm afraid that
some of this crosses the line into the kind of "magical thnking"
("thinking" in quotes) that I'm happy to leave to the folks on those
*other* rec.audio newsgroups :-)

Perhaps I am oblivious because I am using short lengths
within a small rack.  And a sample slipping one or two
clock cycles is indistinguishable from reverberation in
the locations where I typically record :-)

Mike,

That's not quite right. Jitter that occurs in the clocking of the A/D
converter itself is critical. But that's not what you're describing.
The jitter that occurs as the data is transferred via lightpipe, as
you've described, is not permanent. It is not "jerky forever". As long
as all of the data makes it to the other end, on playback it will be
clocked correclty.

I'm probably not explaining this very well. But Bob Katz does so much
better. I don't think he'll mind the link to his article on jitter:

&gt; &gt; There is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with fibre-optic interconnections.
&gt; &gt; The very highest speed networking and hard drives use
&gt; &gt; fibre-optic (vs. copper of any kind).

&gt; No, there's nothing wrong with using fiber-optics for moving that sort
&gt; of data. It doesn't matter if it gets delayed by a few picoseconds, as
&gt; long as it gets there. But it's different with audio.

&gt; The plastic fiber optic cables that are used (because they're
&gt; inexpensive) have internal reflections that cause very slight timing
&gt; errors in the data rate. This is important for data going into the
&gt; recorder because if it's jerky going in, it will be jerky forever.
&gt; When it comes out, it goes through another piece of fiber (or at least
&gt; it might) and a D/A converter before it hits your ears, and modern
&gt; converters do a pretty good job of clocking the data properly so that
&gt; large errors become small errors, but there's only so much they can
&gt; do. And different converters have different clocking accuracies. This
&gt; is the sort of behavior that makes the CD that you give to the client
&gt; sound different than what you hear in the control room.

&gt; The reason why you don't have any problems with your HD24 is because
&gt; you don't know what you're missing until you compare it to something
&gt; else. Just because it sounds OK to you doesn't mean that it isn't a
&gt; problem to someone else. We all have our own threshold of &quot;sucks.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;My dear, I do not know why a digital cable connection cannot copy
&gt;&gt;&gt; 100%.&quot;  That's what I thought too but I ended up getting a converter
&gt;&gt;&gt; that has firewire so I can bypass the PCI card and go straight in.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt; will test it and see if I can hear a difference when the equipment
&gt;&gt;&gt; arrives.  I'll still need something like the Lynx Two for playback
&gt;&gt;&gt; though.  It seems to me the information will not be safe as pure
&gt;&gt;&gt; digital information until it's a file in the computer.  So by going
&gt;&gt;&gt; through an additional device before this step seems like a chance to
&gt;&gt;&gt; degrade the purity of the initial signal with jitter or other noise.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong though by all means, I'm just extrapolating
&gt;&gt;&gt; here, that's why I'm asking the question.  ;)

&gt;&gt; Yet I found a fitting sentence ;-). Realtime Playback is not clocked by
&gt;&gt; crystals (CPU, MHz etc.).

&gt;&gt; But it seems, Digital do have troubles with cables, too. ;-)

&gt;&gt; For example: A Lightcable (fibre) is not always the best dig-cable.
&gt;&gt; Maybe with expensive Hardware, which do have high-end opto-couplers!

&gt;&gt; Many swear to the std. Dig. Coax-cables, as I do.

&gt; I need more references to this. No pun intended, Daniel.

&gt; Having read most of the other threads here, I'm seriously considering an
&gt; M-audio lightbridge, and go with an external converter via lightpipe.
&gt; All in here seems to have only good things to say about the lightbridge.

Oh dear, guess I read what I _wanted_ to hear WRT the lightbridge :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I haven't yet decided on which AD/DA, though.

&gt; Something I've missed WRT possible problems with lightpipes?
&gt; I just don't wan't to get myself in trouble.

Having re-read this and the lightpipe thread, I find diverting opinions.
I'm interested in the lightbridge to facilitate choosing AD/DA ifc's,
for connecting future outboard gear, and not be spellbound by PT (though
I've mostly made the choice).
If I choose PT, I'm pretty much ifc stuck otherwise.

My home studio won't cover large distances, so it seems using good
quality fibre over the cheaper extruded _may_ avoid problems, right?
I'm considering an ADA8000 ifc to go with it.

Good freaking Lord! Just buy some good quality lightpipe cables and be
done with it, if you have your system setup right, they will work just
fine. These guys get really cranky when they don't get any nookie. :-)

That's assuming that it's properly corrected on the other end. As I
said, it depends on what's playing it back. I'll admit that this is
somewhat old school thinking since most D/A converters do a good job
of smoothing out jitter, but some are better than others, which
implies that some are worse than others. Otherwise, all digital would
sound the same.

Oh, fiddle! We're talking about what MIGHT go wrong, not what will be
wrong with your recordings if you use Lightpipe to connect things. Go
ahead and buy one, use good A/D converters, and monitor through good D/
A converters. But cross your fingers. Some people have had problems
getting the Lightbridge to work properly. You could be one of the
lucky ones, or maybe all the problems with every comptuer have been
fixed by the latest driver.
