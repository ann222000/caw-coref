A main clue is that the playwright is described by Jonson as the Swan
of Avon. Shakespeare is from Stratford on Avon. The flights across
the river were made at the London theaters. Jonson knew the
playwright very well and is arguably the most knowledgeable authority
on the matter possible, so there is no mistake. All in the FF refer
to the same person. If your pet theory requires a conspiracy, it
would have to include everyone named in the First Folio. If you are
an anti-Strat, to preserve your credibility you might avoid this
direct a frontal attack on what is factual evidence. bb

There is just one Shakespeare who wore the buskin
and wrote and penned, or Jonson would have specified.

There is no reason to doubt Jonson, so denying his
credibility -- for the sole purpose of legitimizing some
other vaporous shakespeare with no evidence -- is folly.

AntiStrats need to destroy Shakespeare AND take many
others (Jonson, Heminge, Condel, King James) down as
collateral damage. But they have no foundation or any
evidence, just smugness and negative energy. They
think Shakespeare needed more schooling but Jonson
explained that he didn't have it. PLUS, the many other
educated people weren't Shakespeares, so he obviously
did not learn his talent in school.

(AntiStrats ought to marvel at the achievements that the
plays are and stop pretending they'd be easily accomplished
by the noble of their choice. Marlowe and Jonson were the
most similar to Shakespeare both in background and creative
output, so the noble argument is hollow.)

There are no stupid questions except those that answer
themselves.

On the 14th anniversary of Anne Hathaway's death [August 6, 1637]
Ben Jonson was BURIED UPRIGHT against the wall of his crypt.

'Two feet by two feet will do for all I WANT.' -Jonson

(To them) [my OM, by FO(DEVere)OL-]

and such like, which were ridiculous.&gt;&gt; -- Ben Jonson

&quot;I SHAKSPER&quot;
&quot;EKPHRASIS&quot;: A presentation to the mind's eye.
----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The Oxford Classical Dictionary, states that EKPHRASIS&quot;: is,
&quot;an extended and detailed literary description
of any object, real or imaginary&quot;.

Early rhetoricians organized this term into a rhetorical exercise,
which was derived from Aphthonius's Progymnasmata.
Another description of the term comes from the teachers
of ancient rhetoric. They defined [EKPHRASIS] as,
&quot; a vivid description intended to bring
the subject before the mind's eye of the listener&quot;.

In order to compose an EKPHRASTIC piece,
an incredible amount of skill and rhetorical knowledge was needed.
They were the most advanced &quot;graded preparatory exercises
(progymnasmata) designed to teach basic rhetorical skills to school boys.&quot;&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Petrarch's poems, because of their sculpted quality and because of
Petrarch's use of EKPHRASIS --for instance in sonnet 78 where LAURA
appears as SIMON's painting--which introduces the gaze into writing,
are made visible to the reader's eyes. Winn thus writes:

&quot;Petrarch's poetry, however expressive and sonorous, also employs
techniques learned from the recondite virtuosity of the Middle Ages,
.
including ANAGRAMMATIC DISTORTIONS of LAURA's name.&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------
MEASURE FOR MEASURE - ACT III SCENE II

LUCIO: Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

SIMON PETER Bar-Jona (= Ben Jonson)

Geneva: John 1:42 And he brought him to Jesus.
And Jesus beheld him, and said,

Thou art SIMON the son of Jona :

&lt;&lt; Like the initials 'B. J.'-which sign the Shakespeare
Folio's Portrait poem and represent the names of
Solomon's Pillars, BOAZ and JACHIN, as well as being the
initials of Ben Jonson-'T.T.' also signifies the Twin Pillars that
stand before the porch of Solomon's Temple, the Temple of Light.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Billy Budd - Melville

&lt;&lt;Billy stood facing aft. At the penultimate moment, his words,
his only ones, words wholly unobstructed in the utterance were these-

&quot;God bless Captain Vere!&quot; Syllables so unanticipated
coming from one with the ignominious hemp about his neck-
a conventional felon's benediction directed aft towards the quarters of
honor; syllables too DELIVERE in the clear melody of a singing-bird on
the point of launching from the twig, had a phenomenal effect, not
unenhanced by the rare personal beauty of the young sailor spiritualized
now thro' late experiences so poignantly profound. Without volition
as it were, as if indeed the ship's populace were but the vehicles
of some vocal current electric, with one voice from alow and aloft
came a resonant sympathetic ECHO- &quot;God bless Captain Vere!&quot;

And yet at that instant Billy alone must have been in their hearts,
even as he was in their eyes. At the pronounced words and the
spontaneous ECHO that voluminously rebounded them, Captain Vere,&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------------
_A Grace_ by Ben Jonson
extempore, before King James.:

Our king and queen,the Lord-God bless
The Paltzgrave, and the Lady Bess
And God bless EVERy living thing
That lives and breaths,and loves the king.
God bless the Council of Estate
And Buckingham,the fortunate,
God bless them all, and keep them save,
And God bless me, and God bless RAPH.

The King wanted to know who RAPH was &amp; BENJAMIN told him
that Â´twas the drawer at the Swan tawern, by Charing cross, who
drew him good canary. For this the king gave him 100 pounds.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Charles Dibdin wrote the words &amp; music for the Shakespeare Jubilee
in Stratford in 1769, produced &amp; directed by its star, David Garrick.
A page from one of Dibdin's songbooks was on display at the Folger
Shakespeare Library. On the page was a ballad called &quot;SWEET Willy. O.&quot;
The name &quot;Willy&quot; recalls Edmund Spenser's &quot;our pleasant Willy&quot;.

The pride of all nature was SWEET Willy. O.
The first of all SWAINs,
He gladdened the plains,
None EVER was like to the SWEET Willy O.

He sung it so rarely did SWEET Willy O;
He melted each Maid,
So skillfull he play'd,
No Shepherd EVER pip'd like the SWEET Willy O.

All Nature obey'd him, the SWEET Willy O;
WherEVER he came,
What e'er had a name,
WhenEVER he sung follow'd SWEET Willy O.

He would be a Soldier the SWEET Willy O;
When arm'd in the field,
With sword and with shield,
The Laurel was won by the SWEET Willy O.

He charmed them when living the SWEET Willy O;
And when Willy dy'd,
'Twas Nature that sighed
To part with her All in her SWEET Willy O.

In 20 short lines, &quot;EVER&quot; appears five times: 25% of the lines.

Dibdin was immensely prolific and published a 5-volume opus.
A scan of 500 lines of similar ballads produced 3 &quot;nEVER&quot;s &amp;
2 &quot;whenEVER&quot;s. . .no &quot;EVER&quot;s or other forms : 1% of the lines.

Rhine Sagas, as they have been told in Germany *throughout history* :

Lohengrin, The SWAN Knight of Kleve

&lt;&lt;Once upon a time ELSA, daughter of a deceased Duke lived in the castle
called Kleve, sometimes called the &quot;SWAN Castle&quot;. ELSA had barely come
of age when both of her parents died, and her younger brother followed
them after a short illness.

. . . .

After a sleepless night, ELSA confronted her husband with the
oath-breaking question: &quot;In the name of out sons - what do you call
yourself? And from where do you come?&quot; He stared at her clutching his
heart: &quot;Such happiness and now it is in shreds! You should never have
asked that question, as you well know. I shall answer you, but then I
must leave you!&quot; ELSA implored him not to say such a thing, but he
continued:

&quot;Know this: in a far-off land, inaccessible to you all, there stands a
castle, called Montsalwatsch. In the center gleams a glittering house of
God, more splendid than any ever built on earth. And this house contains
the most precious thing in existence: the Holy Grail. Twelve brave
heroes were selected to protect it. They are also available to come to
the assistance of innocent people who ask for help. King Percival is the
leader and all who serve him recieve strength from the Grail. But no one
is allowed to ask their names or who sent them. They have to leave
anyone who discovers their identity.&quot; ELSA cried out at this declaration
but the the SWAN Knight voice continued as though it were coming from
another world: &quot;I was sent here from the Grail. My father is King
Percival. I, his Knight-errant, am named Lohengrin!&quot;

As he spoke these words, the SWAN came gliding by, still harnessed to
the golden boat as it was so many years ago. It barely touched the bank
and Lohengrin was already inside. As the SWAN and the boat moved off,
Lohengrin did not glace back. Desperately, ELSA followed along the bank,
but she could not catch him. Heart-broken she returned to the castle and
she never again saw Lohengrin, no matter how often she visited the banks
in the vain hope of finding him. Her three sons remained her only
friends. They developed great chivalrous virtues, and they passed on
their strength and wisdom to many a later generation. They all bore
the SWAN in their coat of arms, and proudly called themselves
&quot;the SWAN Knights of Kleve&quot;.

but she could not catch him. Heart-broken she returned to the castle and
she never again saw Lohengrin, no matter how often she visited the banks
in the vain hope of finding him. Her three sons remained her only
friends. They developed great chivalrous virtues, and they passed on
their strength and wisdom to many a later generation. They all bore
the SWAN in their coat of arms, and proudly called themselves
&quot;the SWAN Knights of Kleve&quot;.

so if Queen Elizabeth wrote the plays, she used the pen name Shakespeare?

how did she come up with the name Shakespeare?
were they lovers?
why would she get involved with a rich,
illiterate businessman from Stratford
[who like to dabble in acting on the side]?

and was Ben Johnson her lover also; I mean why the dedication?

thanks

You're gonna tell me that Jonson's words in the First Folio are clear
and permit only one interpretation?

Oxfordian Frequently Unanswered Questions

Is there any evidence, any document or any testimony
to link Edward de Vere to any work of Shakespeare?
Did he ever attend or read or know of any of the plays?

Why don't Oxfordians include the known works
attributed to Oxford when speaking of Shakespeare's
works if they believe him to be one and the same?
When is any mainstream encyclopedia going to
state that Oxford wrote any Shakespeare play?
When will online search engines include the earl's
poems in their Shakespeare database if it is all
one man's work?

How did Oxford write/produce plays in court and
on stage during his travels and self-imposed exiles?

How did Oxford arrange that Cymbeline, The Winter's
Tale, The Tempest and Henry VIII be held six-eight
years after his death before they were first recorded,
licensed, and produced?

Since Oxford was a patron himself, why did he seek
patronage from the Earl of Southampton, a lesser
noble?

Why did Oxford desperately seek income from tin mining
licensing for several years while the plays were being
produced?

Since Oxford was awarded a law degree by Oxford
University, why doesn't that university promote itself
as having Shakespeare as a graduate?

(this one courtesy of Nicholas Whyte) Why do the
Shakespeare plays that have John de Vere, Earl of
Oxford as character (3 H VI and R III) spell the
name &quot;Oxford&quot; while the 16th Earl of Oxford spells
the name &quot;Oxenford&quot; if the earl was the author?&quot;

(these two courtesy of Tad Davis) When was
Edward de Vere first suggested as the author?
(The answer, of course, is 1920. Let's see, that's
... 304 years after his death. Kinda makes the
seven years between Shakespeare's death and
the First Folio look piddling, doesn't it? Of course,
the Oxfordians categorically reject the testimony
of Shakespeare's fellow actors because it wasn't
written when he was alive.)
When is the first documented reference to William
Shakespeare as an actor and playwright? (Take
your pick: 1592 -- Robert Greene. 1611 -- John Davies.
1623 -- Ben Jonson, John Heminges, Henry Condell.
And of course this doesn't even begin to touch the
hundreds of references to Shakespeare as either
an actor or a writer; these are just the ones that
unambiguously describe him as both.)

Since Oxford lived in both Holland and Italy, and Shakespeare
staged many plays in Italy, where are the Dutch plays?

Was Oxford educated or not? We know he was
homeschooled by Burghley and received honorary
degrees for professions he never pursued or practiced
so what evidence is there of any education?

Have you ever lied about anything other than
Shakespeare?

Get busy, Teebis. Have your answers on my desk by
8:00 AM Monday or you're just another lazyass Oxfordian
with no business in a real discussion of Shakespeare.
By ditching this assignment you are showing that you,
too, are an anti-Oxfordian. Defend your man or STEP OFF.
We don't need more evasive Oxfordians cluttering this place.

Go molest a cabin boy, why dontcha? (Ya see, that's
what the earl of Oxford did when he was FACEd with
responsibility.)

Notes on ODYSSEUS' Name &amp; Pseudonyms

ODYSSEUS' name is related to the Greek verb
ODUSSOMAI,
which usually means &quot;to HATE,&quot; or &quot;to be grieved.&quot;

However, in Homer's ODYSSEY the verb usually
means &quot;to cause pain&quot; or &quot;to bear a grudge against.&quot;

Thus, ODYSSEUS' name means &quot;he who causes pain
or makes others angry.&quot; Hence when he names ODYSSEUS,
AUTOLYCUS associates that name with his own tricky behavior:
&quot;odious, yes, HATEful to many for the pain I have caused&quot;.

Whenever one of the anti-Strats tells me there's more than one way of

aware that one can re-interpret their words just as easily.

I don't like to go in for gay bashing, but Tee Biss is obviously
asking for it. He's probably goes in for S&amp;M.

What kind of name is TeeBis? Sounds like Tee Hee. And what kind of
name is Boyce? Sounds like Bruce. Obviously, the writing is a raging
queen. No doubt he is one of those who admires Oxford because he
admires Oxford's penchant for having sex with your boys.

After I sent this, I became concerned that my joke about the name
&quot;Bruce&quot; might not sound as though I were joking.

There's a long association of the name &quot;Bruce&quot; with homosexuality -
and no one takes it seriously.

However, the name Boyce need make me think of homosexuality for some
reason. For a moment, I thought it might be becasue Boyce sounds like
&quot;boys&quot; - but then I realized it sounds like Boise - which was the name
of one of Oscar Wilde's lovers.

In any event, I don't seriously think the name Boyce means the writer
is gay.

However I still say TeeBis sounds swishy. :)

(In any event, I suspect TeeBis has to be a hoax, given his postings
on the Keats subject.)

&gt; I don't like to go in for gay bashing, but Tee Biss is obviously
&gt; asking for it. He's probably goes in for S&amp;M.

&gt; What kind of name is TeeBis? Sounds like Tee Hee. And what kind of
&gt; name is Boyce? Sounds like Bruce. Obviously, the writing is a raging
&gt; queen. No doubt he is one of those who admires Oxford because he
&gt; admires Oxford's penchant for having sex with your boys.

PETERMAN: Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin
Lubeck.

(Mr. Peterman gets the cake out of the fridge.)

PETERMAN: All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched
via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi
sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.

ELAINE: I guess I'll just--

PETERMAN: Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser
of vintage pastry.

(Lubeck inspects the cake.)

PETERMAN: All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?

LUBECK: I'd say about 219.

PETERMAN: Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just
made me a profit of $190,000.

LUBECK: No, $2.19. It's an Entenmann's.

PETERMAN: Do they have a castle at Windsor?

LUBECK: No. They have a display case at the end of the aisle.

PETERMAN: Oh, good lord.

LUBECK: You all right, Peterman? You look ill.

*Let thine own HISTORIES prove thy chronicle*

One of the poems signed &quot;E.O.&quot;

[&amp; one of 16 poems Steven May credits to Oxford.]

A Croune of Bays shall that man weare,
That triumphs over me:
For blacke and Tawnie will I weare,
Whiche mournyng colours be.

The more I folowed on, the more she fled awaie,
As Daphne did full long agone, Apollo's wishfull praie.
The more my plaints resounde, the lesse she pities me,
The more I saught the lesse I founde, that myne she ment to be.
[M]elpomeney, alas with dolefull tunes helpe than,
[A]nd syng Bis wo worthe on me forsaken man;
[T]hen Daphne's Baies shall that man weare, that triumps over me,
For Blacke and Taunie will I weare, which mournyng colours be.
Droune me you tricklyng teares, you wailefull wights of woe,
Come help these hands to rent my heares, my rufull happs to showe:
On whom the scorchyng flames of love, doeth feede you se,
Ah, a lalalantida my deare dame, hath thus tormented me.
[W]herefore you Muses nine, with dolefull tunes helpe than,
[A]nd syng Bis wo worthe on me forsaken man;
[T]hen Daphne's Baies shall that man weare, that triumps over me,

For Blacke and Taunie will I weare, which mourning colours be.
An Ancre's life to leade, with [NAILES] to scratche my grave,

Where earthly Wormes on me shall fede, is all the joyes I crave;
And hide my self from shame, sith that myne eyes doe see,
Ah, a alantida my deare dame, hath thus tormented me.
And all that present be, with dolefull tunes helpe than:
And syng [BIS] woe worthe on me, forsaken man. Finis. E.O.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Two major objections to Oxford's authorship are based on a passage
in Palladis Tamia, a book by an obscure clergyman named Francis Meres.
The 628 page book is almost entirely a collection of miscellaneous
anecdotes, similes &amp; sayings, grouped in moral an religious sections.
The book contains nothing of significance except for SIXTEEN pages in
the middle of it [where] Meres gives literary assessments of no less
than 125 [5 x 5 x 5] English writers and artists, comparing them all
favorably to classical and Italian Renaissance writers and artists.
His comments about them are pithy and perspicacious, suggesting great
familiarity (e.g., Anthony Munday is &quot;our best plotter,&quot; George Peele
died &quot;by the pox,&quot; Drayton &quot;is termed golden-mouthed for the purity
of pretiousness of his style and phrase.&quot; There is, however, no
corroborative evidence that he ever frequented literary circles in
London. Oxfordians note that Meres' comments on London writers were
totally out of character for him, based on his other writings. He was
a Protestant minister who translated religious works. In the same year
as Palladis Tamia he published translations of three religious works
written by a Spanish mystic. He never published anything else to the
end of his life, nearly half a century later. Most of his life was
spent in a rectory in northern England.&gt;&gt;

Did it eVER occur to you that both Wilson and Hathaway are
extraordinarily common names, Art? Of course not -- in your alternative
uniVERse, there can only be one Peter Gay, and even only one Wilson and
only one Hathaway. Comic crap like this is one of the salient reasons
that aneuendorffer114 ... @comicass.nut furnishes one of the most
entertaining exemplars of abnormal psychology on Usenet -- and in a
forum that features such memorable eccentrics as &quot;Dr.&quot; Faker, Elizabeth
Weird, Mr. Streitz, Ludwig Plutonium, _et al_, that is *really* saying

&gt;&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;Two major objections to Oxford's authorship are based on a passage
&gt;&gt; in Palladis Tamia, a book by an obscure clergyman named Francis Meres.
&gt;&gt; The 628 page book is almost entirely a collection of miscellaneous
&gt;&gt; anecdotes, similes &amp; sayings, grouped in moral an religious sections.
&gt;&gt; The book contains nothing of significance except for SIXTEEN pages in
&gt;&gt; the middle of it [where] Meres gives literary assessments of no less
&gt;&gt; than 125 [5 x 5 x 5] English writers and artists, comparing them all
&gt;&gt; favorably to classical and Italian Renaissance writers and artists.
&gt;&gt; His comments about them are pithy and perspicacious, suggesting great
&gt;&gt; familiarity (e.g., Anthony Munday is &quot;our best plotter,&quot; George Peele
&gt;&gt; died &quot;by the pox,&quot; Drayton &quot;is termed golden-mouthed for the purity
&gt;&gt; of pretiousness of his style and phrase.&quot; There is, however, no
&gt;&gt; corroborative evidence that he ever frequented literary circles in
&gt;&gt; London. Oxfordians note that Meres' comments on London writers were
&gt;&gt; totally out of character for him, based on his other writings. He was
&gt;&gt; a Protestant minister who translated religious works. In the same year
&gt;&gt; as Palladis Tamia he published translations of three religious works
&gt;&gt; written by a Spanish mystic. He never published anything else to the
&gt;&gt; end of his life, nearly half a century later. Most of his life was
&gt;&gt; spent in a rectory in northern England.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; Micronesia's Yap atoll seVEREly damaged by Typhoon Sudal
&gt;&gt; AUCKLAND (AFP) Apr 12, 2004

&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;Typhoon Sudal stormed into Yap, with a population of 8,000, on Friday.
&gt;&gt; The homes of more than 1,500 people have been
&gt;&gt; badly damaged, officials said Sunday. &quot;Trees are down any direction
&gt;&gt; you turn,&quot; Lutte said. &quot;It's a scene of wreckage all around.&quot; Lutte said
&gt;&gt; most people had no water, electricity or phone services. Yapese student,
&gt;&gt; Dominic Choay, told the newspaper his grandmother believed Sudal was the
&gt;&gt; worst storm to hit Yap. &quot;EVERything is gone except cement,&quot; he said.&gt;&gt;

I'm not permitted to divulge that information, Art. HoweVER, I can
tell you that it was one of Sinclair, MacGill, Ross, de Payen, de RazÃ¨s,
Guise, Lorraine, or Magdala -- in short, the usual suspects.
