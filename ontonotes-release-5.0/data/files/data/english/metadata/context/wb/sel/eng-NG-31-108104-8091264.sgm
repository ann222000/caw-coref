It's the chin acne. I have tried treating him at home. This is not
working. One of the blackheads has become pus-filled and erupted into
an abscess. So he *has* to go to the vet Monday. IMO he needs oral
antibiotics at this point.

But the chin itself is still going to have to be kept cleaned and
treated, then there's the pill to give him. Somebody tell me HOW to
treat the face of a 20-pound, very combative cat. Bosley is
exceptionally strong, and he can seriously hurt me. And he's learned
to bite. He's very angry at me now. It is impossible for me to even
*look* at his chin without him
starting to growl.

Maybe the vet will have some advice on this, but I thought some of you
guys might too.

I had good luck with a very soft toothbrush and Neosporin ointment.  But
then again I wasn't dealing with Basely.

Molly liked my brushing the crud off her chin.

Sherry, years ago, when my Missy (RB) had chin acne, our vet advised
cleaning her chin with a cotton pad using.....darn, I can't think what -
probably Phisoderm - anyway, a non-soapy cleanser.  Don't rub hard, just
clean.  And after, to put Neosporin on the area.   It worked well for Missy.
Not sure how you do this with a 20-pound, combative kitty - I'm guessing
even a soft cotton pad would vex him :(

How far do you live from the vet's clinic?  I had one of the vet techs come
to my house every day for a week on one occasion when I had to medicate
Holly.  She absolutely would not permit me to put the salve on her food and
bandage it, as the vet had instructed, so I had to have help.

Try throwing a towel or blanket over him to completely wrap him
before he can get any claws out.

If you can get it easily, you might try manuka honey as a local
antiseptic.  It's very safe and very effective.  Other kinds of
honey also work but manuka has specific anti-bacterial agents as
well, look for a type labelled as having a high concentration of
them.  Just spread the stuff on his chin with a knife as if he
was toast.

The only way I've managed to pill reluctant cats is by adding the
stuff to their food.

That would be a dream. I don't think it's feasible though; it's a 40-
mile round trip for them. It
never hurts to ask though. I'll throw this problem at the vet's
tomorrow morning. I can't be
the only client who can't do anything with her cat. I'm not entirely
sure they won't have
to sedate him just to examine him. He is so strong. And since he's
started this biting thing,
he actually is dangerous to treat.

It vexes him for me to *look* at it. He was sleeping upside downy-head
this afternoon, and I stuck
my face just a few inches from his chin just to have a look. Those
little eyes opened just a slit,
and this low growl started coming from him. It scared the crap out of
me. I hate to admit I have

Fortunately, I only live 3 miles from the clinic I use, so it was a lot more
feasible than what you face.  Moreover, it was on the vet tech's way home,
so she only charged $5.00 per visit.  That was a real &quot;deal&quot; for me!

When Rosie got a chin acne abscess last fall, I was able to give her a
liquid antibiotic in her food.  I got a some fish flavored gushy food

I rubbed the pad on her chin, But, she didn't try to bite or scratch
me. I don't know what to tell you about putting stuff on his chin,

I wish you didn't have to do this. I know it's hard when they don't

Annie, do you remember if the vet cleaned out, or debrided, the acne
and abscess? I think you are absolutely right...he needs to be treated
by professionals at least the first day or two, and probably needs an
elizabethan collar
. Bosley used fall for medicine mixed with his food. I hope
he still does.
Thanks everyone. I feel really bad for letting this get worse. I'd
heard from
so many people that chin acne just takes a long time to heal. I just
waited too long.

Pearl is taking liquid Clavomox. I'm mixing it in some food. It
sometimes takes a while, but she gets it all down. Anything Bos will
eat that he LOVES BEYOND ANYTHING? I use A/D

Wish I had some ideas about washing the chin. They may have to just
anesthtize him and clean it. Rats. I didn't know he was so difficult.
Of course, it probably hurts like a mother right now too. Maybe once it
is healed he wouldn't be so opposed to a light chin cleaning once a
weak or so?

Once we took our really combative kitty into the vet and they put her in a
heavy weight zippered bag--all the way up to her neck.

I called it the &quot;nylon maiden&quot;.  I don't know what it's made of or where
they got it (you might ask your vet or try google) but it sure worked!

&gt;&gt; How far do you live from the vet's clinic?  I had one of the vet techs
&gt;&gt; come
&gt;&gt; to my house every day for a week on one occasion when I had to medicate
&gt;&gt; Holly.  She absolutely would not permit me to put the salve on her food
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; bandage it, as the vet had instructed, so I had to have help.

&gt;&gt; MaryL

&gt; That would be a dream. I don't think it's feasible though; it's a 40-
&gt; mile round trip for them. It
&gt; never hurts to ask though. I'll throw this problem at the vet's
&gt; tomorrow morning. I can't be
&gt; the only client who can't do anything with her cat. I'm not entirely
&gt; sure they won't have
&gt; to sedate him just to examine him. He is so strong. And since he's
&gt; started this biting thing,
&gt; he actually is dangerous to treat.

Wonder if this &quot;biting thing&quot; is because his chin already hurts and itches
and is annoying the crap out of him.  Could even be a bad tooth and not just
acne.

That was one of the reasons I used the toothbrush.  Gave me a few inches
head start on the teeth.

I suspect you know as much as anyone here about holding and handling a cat.
But there is no holding any of them if they truly want to fight.  Three
people.  One to wrap him up like a papoose, one to hold his head still from
the back and one to treat the chin.

Oh Dear! Purrs and gentle headbutts for you and Bosley too. I
understand trying to treat large cats that understand the threat of
teeth.  When Hobbes had the abscess on his bottom he got very grumpy.
I'd have to all but lie on top of him to get the ointment on the
sore.  Fortunately I was working on the end without teeth. I feel for
you.

If I have to clip KFC's claws, I get my friend round.  She is very brave and
experienced with animals and I don't think there is anything she daren't
handle.  We wrap her in a blanket, or a big towel with only the appropriate
bits for treatment sticking out.  Yes, she wowls and howls but we don't get
slashed.  Could you try this with Bosley with just his face sticking out and
all four paws safely inside a blanket or towel? Wrapped like a cocoon.  It
will make him spitting mad though, like it does Kitty, but hey, what has to
be done has to be done.
I'm only just home from work so I haven't read any other replies, maybe this
has been suggested already.

&gt; Once we took our really combative kitty into the vet and they put her in a

&gt; I called it the &quot;nylon maiden&quot;.  I don't know what it's made of or where
&gt; they got it (you might ask your vet or try google) but it sure worked!

The first time the vet tried to draw blood from Rusty, they put
him in something similar to what you described. It looked like
a gym bag to me.  But still Rusty fought and kept turning his
head to avoid the needle. The vet finally gave up saying if Rusty
could finght like that, he couldn't be that sick.
Since then, the vet did succesfully draw blood from Rusty several
times, even without the use of the restraint bag

But since Kitty weighs 4 lbs, and Bosley weighs 20 lbs, Sherry would
need to bring five such friends in order to clip Bosley. :)

I haven't gotten Buster and Dot comfortable with trimming nails yet.
I have to distract them, then quickly clip a claw before they notice.
If they're long enough, and the kitty is relaxed, you can sometimes
even sneak in and get one without even touching the paw to unsheath
the claw.  That's time consuming though.

That's a good point, Tak. Especially when you consider Bosley weighs
20 pounds, and I
weigh 100, and don't have claws.  You idea might work once, but after
that I bet I'd have
5 friends who would avoid me.
But it's all good now. I withheld Bosleys food last night before the
vet appt., because I suspected they'd
have to sedate him, and they did. We went this a.m. and I picked him
up at 5. The chin area is completely
clean of blackheads and scabs, and really the only bad place is where
the abscess was. I told the vet I was going
to have an awful time medicating that area, and he said with the
antibiotics it should heal anyway.
He actually acts better than he has in days. Maybe the sedation isn't
completely worn off, or maybe he just
feels better.
I hate to leave the wrong impression about Boz. He is actually a real
loverboy, and he loves me better than anything
in the whole world except for Fancy Feast Roasted Chicken. He just
gets overstimulated so easy, he even really just
likes petting on his own terms.
