Let's look at flightless birds.  How the heck did
they survive this long?  What good are wings
on a chicken?

They are fat, slow, weaponless, lack camoflouge,
and can't fly.  Any mammal which spotted a
turkey, his eyes would light up like neon:
&quot;CHICKEN MCNUGGETS!&quot;

You call that natural selection?

I think this proves Darwin was wrong, and God exists.

Yes....wings are much better off the chicken, deep-fried, and covered

Looks like a little research on your part would clear up some
misconceptions.

1) Domestic chickens are the domesticated descendants of the native
Red Jungle Fowl of southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.  These
birds survived quite well in the wild (although some experts now
consider 'pure' native stock to be threatened because of contamination
with domesticated varieties).   Anyone who thinks of these birds as
defenseless has not tried to catch one.  Wear heavy gloves and eye
protection, especially if you're trying to catch a cock.  Also, RJF
(and chickens) don't fly *well* but they can, in fact, fly.

2) Ditto for Turkeys.  Wild turkeys don't fly well, but they do fly.
They're also not 'clumsy' or 'slow', and can be quite aggressive when
cornered.  The spurs on the toms can be over an inch long, and they're
quite adept at using them.

3) Ditto for most flightless birds.  I invite you to run down an
ostrich as an exercise.  Let us know how that goes. Besides being
quite fast, they can deliver a kick that can be deadly.

Your knowledge of nature must come from Walt Disney.  Yes, chickens
can fly, and if you think flightless birds have no weapons I dare you
to corner an on ostrich without a rifle in your hands.

If you are saying you can chase and catch a healthy adult quail or
wild turkey (I have a flock of each on my property), please do so and
provide video evidence. Otherwise, you'd be well advised not to openly
display your ignorance.

Wouldn't that be turkey McNuggets?  Hey, Bozo.  I stood out on my deck a
few days ago and watched two turkeys fly down the wooded hill above my
house well below the tops of the trees.  They made a hard left and shot
through a small opening between the branches, brushing their wings on
limbs along the way, to land on the road below.  Every year there are a
couple of hens with broods around my house.  They are everywhere.  My
cats give them wide berth.  I suppose a cougar might feast on them, but
I don't know what else.

Read Beebe's account of Junglefowl in his monograph about pheasants.
He observed Green Junglefowl flying to islands off on the horizon from
the beach to roost at night.  Red Junglefowl were brought to the US as
gamebirds, but they never amonted to something anyone would want to
shoot.  The Brits like to shoot them in India.  Normal standard sized
chickens can still fly.  They also use their wings to accelerate on
the ground and aid in balance and turning.  The wings are also used in
fighting.  There seem to be four species of gallus wandering around in
the wild, so they passed the tests so far.  Gee by comparison there is
only one species of Homo still around they must be real losers.  They
can't fly, they are weak muscled, their nearest relatives can tear
their arms off and beat them to death with them.  In another thread
they commented on how the eyes were going.

A lot of traits are selected for and against, you have to look deeper
and not pop off out of ignorance before you can figure out why some
species makes it and others don't.  Sometimes it is just bad luck, a
lot of times we just don't know the answer.

Oh, chickens can fly just fine, RichD.  Just ask anyone who's gone
into a chicken coop and come out with poop in their hair from an
aerial bombardment.  [The next time my farmer auntie said, &quot;Wear a hat
in the chicken coop,&quot; I listened.]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They are fat, slow, weaponless, lack camoflouge,

Er, except that they *can* fly.  And if you don't over-feed them - if
you let them forage for insects and goodies on their own - they're not
especially fat or slow.  And they've got these handy little spur-
thingies on their legs, which can do you some hurt, not to mention the
fact that they peck like the devil, and some of them know to go for
the eyes.

You haven't ever gotten up close and personal with any live chickens,
have you, Richie?

You err in thinking that modern chickens are the result of &quot;natural
selection.&quot;  They're the result of selective breeding, some of which
was done by my own mother and aunt, who were both great chicken-
growers.

And I think you know nothing of either Darwin *or* chickens.  And by

Nope, that is poultry ranching. Just for those who may not know, wild
turkeys, and their distant cousins, wild chickens, are not flightless,
are not defenseless,  nor are they fat, nor do they lack camafloge.
They are quite capable of taking care of themselves in the wild. It is
only man's desire and work at
getting  something that is edible, and cost effective.

So what you are telling us is that you are so
desperate to find some, no, any, proof of the
existence of your non-existent deity, so insecure in
your beliefs at the total absence of evidence of the
existence of _any_ deity, despite 40,000 years of
theist claims and seeking such proof, that you are
putting forth the incompetence of overfed
domesticated meat fowl at flying as your *BEST*
attempt to prove the existence of God?

Good luck with that.

Hell, I'd go one better.  Let HIM go hungry for a few days, put a
shotgun in his hands (but don't give him a dog) and see how well he
fares against a brace of wild turkeys in the woods, or a flock of
quail on a hillside. I bet he starves, unless he's experienced.

Back in my hunting days, I got pretty darn good in the field, and if I
hit more than half the birds I shot at, I called it a good day. (Note
that I was never a Cheney-style hunter, with people releasing hutch-
raised quail 10 yards in front of me.)

Chickens can fly, mate. They can't fly high, or fast, or far, but they can
fly when they want to. _Hen_ chickens will usually, but not always, run
and/or fly _away_. _Cock_ chickens have been known to, ah, engage the enemy
more closely. In particular 'bantam' roosters are notorious for taking Short
Guy Syndrome to an extreme above and beyond that of even Chihuahuas or other
useless rat-dogs.

_Domestic_ turkeys have problems, but not flying ain't one of them. (Being
too stupid to know when to fly, now that's a whole different matter. They're
literally too stupid to know when to come in out of the rain...) _Wild_
turkeys are that good at flying, though they're better than chickens at it.
They are _not_ defenceless. Far from it.

I didn't claim every meteor constitutes a miracle.
Logic isn't your strong point, is it?

Oh, you can whiz-bang practically _anything_ into &quot;a
miracle&quot;, if your only criterion is &quot;how do you know
it isn't?&quot; That kind of &quot;logic&quot; is what makes the
&quot;miracle&quot; claims of theists so hilarious to skeptics.

You're a bit on the dim side, aren't you? Collisions
of orbiting bodies occur according to the mechanics
whose rules Newton elucidated, thus he is &quot;father&quot;
to your faux miracles. Do you often find yourself
needing to have the joke explained to you, there in
your &quot;riding the short bus&quot; life?

Pretty wise of him, since physicists still lack a
good handle on what gravity even _is_, to this day.

You merely highlight one idiotic tendency of
theists, to jam gods into everyplace they find
ignorance prevailing. You theists are attracted to
ignorance like blowflies to dung, and for the same
reason: you prefer to feast on it as a primary form
of nourishment.

Hardly. If you think the Yucatan astroblem is &quot;a
miracle&quot;, then there are _lots_ of such miracles for
you to worship, you don't have to stick to the
burning bush thingie.

And your criterion for choosing the ones you call
miracles spring from what besides your abject
idiocy? The mammals and dinosaurs had been competing
for hundreds of millions of years. Your &quot;god&quot; sure
wasn't in a hurry to force a succession. Come to
that, the Yucatan impact looks exactly like waiting
around until blind chance did the job, no &quot;miracles&quot;
need apply.

Says the man who doesn't know that chickens and
turkeys, inherently, are flighted birds, only
flightless when domesticated and overfed, and finds
flightless overfed domestic meat-fowl &quot;best
evidence&quot; for the Godhead. Man, you should get into
swine, if &quot;so fat only waddling works&quot; turns into
gods incarnate for you.

xanthian.

And by the way, from my personal experience, wild
turkeys are excellent fliers, and will scare the
spit out of you passing close by in the woods at
eye level.

&quot;Pork, pork, pork, pork is god,
Pork, pork, pork is god,
Pork, pork, pork is God.

And nothing can stop me now,
For I'm .. the god of flab!&quot;
