AT&amp;T announced that they will expand the ability of their wireless customers
to make free calls.  In addition to getting free m2m, wireless customers
will be able to call AT&amp;T landlines without incurring usage fees or using
their wireless minutes.

AT&amp;T has 100 million landlines.

Good marketing strategy.

NOW THE REST OF THE STORY.

Jeremy  left out all the gotchas.. It's hardly a simple plan.
To call a landline free, the landline customer

1. Must be an AT&amp;T POTS customer, within the regular AT&amp;T service
area. (SBC/Bellsouth) on the landline.

2. Must have AT&amp;T unlimited long distance and unlimited local on the
landline. Far more expensive than say Vonage.

and....

3. Wireless customer must have a $59.99 or more AT&amp;T wireless plan.

4. The press release fails to mention (and thus likely time charges at
the wireless end) calls from landline to wireless.

More gotchas - in the press release/web site, but not the news story.

5. You have to get a new Cingular "Unity" plan (likely will decrease
your plan minutes).

6. You have to have combined ATT/Cingular billing; likely the $5 month
credit for combined billing is going away due to the "benefit" of the
Unity plan.

Yes, their ads will be a huge headline announcing FREE CALLING WITH ATT,
a short teaser with a picture of a teen on a phone calling a friend at
home, then 50 paragraphs of 5 pt. type disclaimers.

Still, it sounds like a powerful advertising incentive.  If your business
and/or family are on AT&amp;T landlines, that could give you a lot of free
calls.  Even if the monthly charge is a bit on the high side, there are
going to be people that will come out ahead.

Combine that with Remote Call Forwarding, and you could effectively get
free calls to anyone else. Assuming you have the unlimited LD package on
your home phone.

I agree that this will not be beneficial to everybody, but . . .

Those customers that meet the requirements will see their total number of
free calling numbers increase by a factor of 4 (I think that Cingular had
about 25 million m2m, and they now are adding 100m landlines).

I hope that my own carrier, Sprint, offers something similar to its
customers.

With all the stagnation in innovative discount plans lately, it is good to
see "something" new.

I am quite happy with Sprint.  $30/month per line, 7 PM N/W, free roaming,
even local calls will hop onto Verizon if there is no Sprint tower,
unlimited M2M (I use that a lot), Free long distance.  C'mon, where can I go
and get a deal that is much better than that?  And, unlike my experience
with Cingular, after they took control of my ATTWS service, my calls go
through on the first try, and I rarely get a dropped call.

All I want to do is to be able to make and receive calls.  No need for
anything else.  Just have my phone connect when I need it.  I was happier
with my old Motorola handset, back in the analog days, than I was with
Cingular.  My daughter, on the other hand, uses them and loves them.  Go
figure.

VONAGE is VOIP! Not landline service and there are a few "Must Have's"
to get this package, but it isn't much different than having a
landline, cellphone etc. The benefits are far greater and much more
cost effective in the long run.

Published reports have noted that 25% of Vonage's customers leave each year.
Vonage has to find replacements for 25% of their customer base annually,
just to stay in place.  If memory serves me correctly, Vonage has not turned

Vonage is doing very poorly, mainly because it's so cost ineffective
compared to a landline and a cheap long-distance service like OneSuite
or TalkLoop. Even among VOIP providers, their system is less capable,
and more expensive than other companies, like Voicestick.

After SWB/SBC/ATT charged me 98 cents a minute for Canada calls, I went
Vonage where Canada is local.

Charter called to offer 32 cents/min for calls to Costa Rica vs ATT's 34
cents; Vonage is 2 (yep, two). I call every week now, not every quarter.

They remind me of AOL in it's heyday.  They price themselves above
market, capitalizing on the ignorance of their users who think this is
how all providers of that service work.

Take the Vonage soft-phone, for example- first, they didn't offer it
until long after other providers did, and then they have the nerve to
charge $10/month extra for it!

Agreed.  Vonage got in the game early, and seems to think their

I've been playing with Voicestick more since finding a good deal on their
unlocked MG-3 ATA on eBay ($10!)  Sound quality is good, and it's a
pleasure using a real phone and not needing a PC or proprietary wireless
hardware, like with Skype.  The fact that I can use a softphone as well,
for no extra cost, on my PPC phone is a bonus.  (That comes in handy when
I'm stuck in a hotel with free Wi-Fi and crummy T-Mobile reception!)

&gt;&gt; Anyway, vonage is overpriced.  WAY overpriced.  Do your research.

&gt; After SWB/SBC/ATT charged me 98 cents a minute for Canada calls, I went
&gt; Vonage where Canada is local.

&gt; Charter called to offer 32 cents/min for calls to Costa Rica vs ATT's 34
&gt; cents; Vonage is 2 (yep, two). I call every week now, not every quarter.
">

Skype is offering unlimited calls for $14.95 per year!  The price doubles
after 1/31.

There are numerous phone sets offered that look and act like ordinary
cordless phones, but which run the calls over Skype.

They will even give you a local phone number, so you can receive incoming
calls from people using regular phone lines, for $38.00 annually.

If they make a lot of long distance calls, AND they have broadband cable
internet, AND they need to make a lot of peak time calls that they can't
use N&amp;W or MTM on their cell phone for, then $25 may be better than
their landline. Personally, I'd have to make three hours of long
distance calls per month before Vonage would be worthwhile, not counting
the fact that cable broadband would cost me an extra $25 per month over
DSL, which would pay for more than another twenty hours of long distance.

People get carried away with "unlimited" because they are unaware of how
cheap long distance calling actually is if they sign up for a good
service such as TalkLoop. They're doing their calculations using LD
rates from AT&amp;T or other high cost LD provider. They might also benefit
from switching to a wireless carrier like Sprint that has 7 p.m. nights
and weekends, versus 9 p.m. of the other carriers.

The fact remains that Vonage is operating in the red, so it would be
difficult for them to justify a rate reduction.

I use Verizon's VoIP service, VoiceWing, also $24.95 per month, and it is a
Godsend, considering that I routinely used to generate LD bills in excess of
$200/month, back in the days of AT&amp;T Reach Out America (First hour was
$10.00, and additional hours were $7.80 each, billed in increments of one
minute after the first full hour).

These are, truly, great days for long distance customers.  Who ever thought
that we could communicate for free via Instant Messenger, or for $15/year
via Skype, or $25.00 per month on VoIP lines?  Who would have believed, back
in 1984, that AT&amp;T long distance would one day be replaced by cheap
flat-rate substitutes?  I, for one, am truly grateful.  I remember in the
80s, when a call on Bell coast-to-coast was $.57 per minute during the
daytime.

That's not the way pricing works. You set your prices to be competitive,
it doesn't matter whether you're in the black or the red. You can't
raise prices to raise revenue, as you'll lose customers. Sometimes
lowering prices increases revenue as volume goes up.

Nothing per se, but that's at the high end of unlimted VoIP.  Others do
it for $15 or $20, and many offer pay as you go, which is a bargain for
those who use VoIP primarily for international calls (which typically
fall outside the unlimited US/Canada plans.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

But the two are related: perceptions of "quality" are colored by value.
People might expect less "quality" from Vonage for $15 than $25, much
like the quality expectation of a $1 McDonald's hamburger is less than a
$10 burger at the Hard Rock.

No offense to Vonage, but my landline service is only $25 (without LD, of
course.)  For $25/month I'd expect the Vonage experience to be very close
to landline in quality and uptime, whereas for $10 or $15/month, I'd cut
them a lot more slack.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Of course.  Their rates are almost in lockstep with Verizon's, despite
higher costs, higher churn, etc.  Remember, "competitive" doesn't mean
"cheapest," just in the ballpark, with reasonable justifications for
higher prices!  Verizon commands relatively higher prices because the
public's perception of quality ("the network") allows it.  Cingular can
offer fewer minutes than others for the same monthly rate as others
because they give you "rollover," etc.

$25 is more than what most people spend for their land line and long
distance combined. Remember, a great deal of long distance is now done
on off-peak or mobile to mobile cell phone minutes. Not free, but
included at no extra cost.

If someone really was cost sensitive and did a great deal of long
distance calling, then they'd choose a less expensive, and more capable
VOIP provider than Vonage.

Vonage ends up with a very small target market: people that make a lot
of long distance calls, have expensive landline service (every extra
feature on their landline such as call-waiting, caller-ID, three-way
calling, etc.), AND that believe the Vonage ads, rather than doing any
research prior to purchasing.

I use VoiceWing, also $24.95/month, with no term commitment, and it is a
BARGAIN over what I paid when long distance was billed by the minute.  While
I realize that there might be cheaper services out there, I like the fact
that Verizon remains my service provider, rather than some unknown company
without a track record.

I can think of lots of other things to complain about, but not $25.00/month
for a line, all the calling features, and unlimited LD to the US and
Canada--that is an amazing value for me.  I formerly paid hundreds and got
less.

Finally I am seeing the fruits of divestiture.  Granted, the Internet played
a big role in this, but I never thought I'd live to see the day when I could
make unlimited calls to anywhere for a set price.  Combine that with my
cellular N/W and my ability to communicate free via Instant Messengers, and
I feel like a kid in a candy store.

And now Skype is running a $15/ANNUAL promotion.  Life is good!

It doesn't apply to 99.99% of residential customers. The main reason for
this program is to try to sell more residential customers on buying
high-cost long distance service from AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T has been decimated in
the residential long distance market. A lot of businesses still use
them, because of their international capabilities for conference calls.

There are still a lot of people that are very naive about long distance
options. My mom was telling me about her friend that was spending
13¢/minute on AT&amp;T to call her son that had moved to Israel, plus a
monthly fee. I hooked her up with TalkLoop which is less than 3¢/minute,
1/5 the cost.

Not terribly imaginative, but not terribly surprising either, since the

Given how much variation there is in consumer pricing of essentially the
same goods, as even a cursory pricing trip through a supermarket
demonstrates, he made a patently silly claim that displays fundamental
ignorance of the consumer market.

It's all marketing.  "the network," "rollover," "7pm nights," etc. are
nebulous differentiators that salesdroids can use to explain to their
potential victims why their 450 minutes are better than the other guy's.
But obviously none of them want to chance having the low number in a
brochure to have to overcome with "rollover" or "7pm" like they used to.

Or, perhaps, he simply made a fairly accurate, although simplified,
comment appropriate to the forum.  It was usenet post, not an article or
dissertation, and the underlying message was fundamentally correct-
market forces determine a single company's pricing in a competitive
market to a far greater degree than the cost of production.

IIRC, this discussion started because someone posted a comment that
Cingular's rebranding to AT&amp;T would increase the rates Cingular users
will pay.  In that context, SMS' comment was dead on.

You're correct in your point that marketing and setting price points is a
complex business.  Yet the current similarity in minutes/dollar/month
among the top three carriers seems to indicate that the carriers AREN'T
effectively communicating their nuances to consumers, and have elected to
insure that they don't "look stingy" in terms of minutes offered at a
particular price point.
