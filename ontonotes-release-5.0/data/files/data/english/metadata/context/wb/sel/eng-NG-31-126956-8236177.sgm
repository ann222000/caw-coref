the Warlord as well as Kahagas were in attendance.

Hour one notes:

Jeremy Borash watched on as Jim Cornette spoke to Christian Cage and
pals about who pulled Abyss under the ring. Cornette announced a tag
team ladder match with a contract up top for a Hard Justice match
between Cage &amp; Abyss. If Cage and AJ Styles win the match goes away, if
Abyss and Sting win Abyss picks the stipulation. Kurt Angle, his wife
Karen and child walked by and Angle admonished the child for dropping
something.

(1) Team 3D (Ray and Devon) defeated “Wildcat” Chris Harris &amp; “Showtime”
Eric Young.

Team 3D have white hot old school ECW style heat on them with the
Orlando fans. They wasted no time in attacking Harris but he fired back
with a clothesline and bulldog combo. Harris used his power to suplex
Devon before tagging in Young who looked a little bit terrified but he
had his friends behind him as Ray tagged in. young faired well against
both 3D members but it came to a screeching halt when Devon tripped
Young from the floor and Ray leveled him. 3D kept Young occupied until
he hit what looked like a dropkick but when he went to tag out to
Harris, he found Harris on the floor fighting with Dustin Rhodes as
those two fought to the locker room. Young didn’t last along after being
hit with a top rope Spike Piledriver.

After the match Robert Roode, Ms. Brooks, a pillow and a two bottles of
lotion came out to the ring to admire 3D’s handiwork. They pulled Young
to the floor where Roode got the house mic and talked about embarrassing
moments. What happened next the mid-south wrestling fans used to call a
“tar and feather” incident. Backstage Jeremy Borash tracked down the
Angle Clan telling Angle that Samoa Joe would mow down anyone including
his family to get to Angle. Angle seemed more interested in his wife’s
figure and daughter’s appetite for candy.

(2) XXX (“Primetime” Elix Skipper, Senshi &amp; “Fallen Angel” Christopher
Daniels) defeated “Black Machismo” Jay Lethal &amp; “the Guru” Sonjay Dutt.

The Motor City Machineguns watched on and taped the bout as Skipper slid
to the floor. Lethal &amp; Dutt fought with the remaining members but Lethal
got isolated from Dutt and the under handed tactics began mixed in with
some amazing double team moves. Lethal fought out of a chinlock, avoided
a Daniels leg lariat and tagged in Dutt who let XXX have it with a
series of moves but his slingshot Pop move only got two. Dutt hit Senshi
with Sliced Bread into a slam of some kind. But he looked at Skipper who
dropped him on the top rope. It set up the Warrior’s Way and BME to get
the win for XXX. After the match XXX and the Guns had a heated verbal
exchange but it didn’t escalate to punches.

As Jeremy Borash looked on, Dr. Kevin Nash held a session with the Angle
Family. Kurt accused Karen of looking at Dr. Nash’s package. He forced
Karen to have a session with Dr. Nash or “don’t the door hit her on the
ass on the way out.” After Kurt left, Karen soon followed him out as she
wanted nothing to do with Nash and his acting resume.

(3) In a Ladder Match, Sting &amp; Abyss defeated “Phenomenal” AJ Styles &amp;
“Instant Classic” Christian Cage.

Sting and Abyss jumped their opponents at the bell and the hard hitting
action was under way. Abyss hit Cage/Styles with a clothesline and Sting
followed with a top rope bodyblock. Sting and Abyss sent Cage/Styles
back to the ring so they could bring the ladder in. but Styles and Cage
charged for a dropkick into the ladder but the ladder moved, they slid
to the floor and got leveled by it. Abyss placed the duo in a corner as
Sting hit the Stinger Splash into a ladder followed by Abyss’ version of
the Splash. Abyss went to climb up but Styles stopped him and countered
out a wheel barrel, dropping Abyss’ throat on the ladder. Sting saw the
duo coming with the ladder and dropkicked it, sending Cage/Styles to the
mat but when Sting went up top Cage followed. Sting opted to bring Cage
back down and hit a bulldog. Sting went up again but Styles stopped that
trip. Abyss and Styles fought on the ladder but Abyss chokeslammed
Styles to the mat. Just as Abyss grabbed the contract Tomko hit Abyss
with a chair. But as Tomko told Styles to go up, Andrew “Test” Martin
hit the ring and Tomko with several moves. Sting and Martin held the
ladder steady as Abyss climbed up and got the contract.

After a couch session, Kurt &amp; Karen Angle came out to the Impact Zone to
address the fans. Angle said he brought Karen out to explain to the fans
and home viewers just who Kurt Angle really is. Angle said it must be
difficult to live in his shadow but wanted Karen to tell the people what
it is like living with him. Karen kept her lips shut even as Kurt tagged
her with insults. Samoa Joe and his titles came out and said Kurt Angle
is a horse’s ass. Kurt hid behind Karen when Joe hit the ring. Karen
said living with Kurt for 12 years has been pure hell and went on to
make TNA Impact into the Maury Povich Show for a little while.

Joe said after Hard Justice Angle would be left with his clothes, but
then again he tore off Angle’s jacket and dress shirt. As Joe stood in
the ring with all the gold, Angle went for the high ground as Jeremy
Borash and Bill Banks filmed stuff for TNA Today.

Hour two notes:

TNA Management’s Jim Cornette and Matt Morgan made their way to the
ring. Cornette said Sting, Abyss and “the Punisher” Andrew Martin had
chosen their stipulation for the PPV. But Cornette was cut off by
Christian Cage, Tomko and AJ Styles. Cage said six man matches weren’t
his style and he wanted to discuss the world title situation. Cornette
said Abyss came up with a “doozy of a match” called the “Doomsday
Chamber of Blood” match. It’s basically a Six Sides of Steel match with
Barb Wire on the top, post to post and corner to corner. You need to
bust someone open to get a pinfall. The winner fights the TNA World
Heavyweight champion at No Surrender in September. The lights went down
and up to find the ring filled with people.

(1) In a tag team match, Kip James (w/Roxxie Laveaux) &amp; Brother Devon
defeated “Notorious 187” Homicide &amp; Rick Steiner.

Homicide was the smallest man in the ring but you wouldn’t have known
that by the way he took Kip down to the mat. Steiner tagged in and
decked Kip with a Steiner Line and some forearms. But Rick focused on
Devon for a moment and got kicked in the face by Kip. Devon laid in the
shots but Steiner caught in mid-air and hit a slam. This allowed
Homicide to tag in to take on both men. He ducked a Kip clothesline and
it sent Devon to the floor. But when Homicide went to the ropes, Devon
tripped Homicide and Kip hit the Famouser to win. After the match all
four teams fought in the ring with 3D and VKM hitting the pavement
running from LAX and the Steiners.

(2) In a six man “House of Fun” match; Raven, “Tennessee Cowboy” James
Storm (w/Jacqueline Moore) &amp; Robert Roode (w/Ms. Brooks) defeated “War
Machine” Rhino, Frankie “the Future” Kazarian &amp; Wildcat Chris Harris.

This specialty match in TNA dates back to the Nashville Asylum and like
those matches this was hard hitting bell to bell. Raven &amp; friends jumped
Kazarian as he came out. Brooks and Moore set up a table and you doubted
it was for a post match meal. Harris split Raven open with repeated
trash can shots. Harris &amp; Storm picked up where they left off with trash
can lid shots to the head. Kazarian tossed a chair into Roode’s face but
he ended up going through the table. Kazarian avoided a Storm
clothesline and when Storm went to skin the cat back in Kazarian tossed
a garbage can at him. But when Kazarian went for a spear, Storm hit him
with a trash can lid shot. Storm grabbed some martial arts chucks but
Rhino chased him to the locker room. Roode fell for the chair trick
twice and Kazarian hit a spinning heel kick but Raven hit him with a
kendo shot. Harris ducked a double team and hit a double clothesline and
he took Roode to the floor. Kazarian countered out of the Raven Effect
and kicked Raven into a table positioned in the corner. But Roode hit
Kazarian in the gut with a mallet and hit the Perfect Plex to win.

Samoa Joe made his way to the ring with a “special guest” Karen Angle.
Joe said he wanted to invite Karen to watch the match at the PPV from a
front row seat. But before things got quiet, Kurt Angle came to the ring
looking disheveled. Joe said the TV production truck said the show is
beginning to suck now that Angle is out. Kurt got in the ring to talk to
Karen about their marriage and reconciliation. Just when it looked like
Karen was going to tell off Kurt, Angle played the “kids card” and Karen
still told him off. Joe said after suffering due to Angle for the last
nine months, he enjoyed watching Angle suffer at the hands of his soon
to be former wife. But before it was done, Team 3D came out and accused
Joe of being a home wrecker and a thief. 3D said they were here to take
back what belonged to them, the TNA World Tag Team titles. Joe laid the
belts down but when Ray went to pick them up, Joe said it was going to
be hard for them to pick up. He attacked 3D but Angle attacked Joe.
Angle locked in the Ankle Lock as 3D whipped Joe in the back with the
title belts as they talked crap to his face. The Steiner Brothers hit
the ring to face off with Team 3D as Angle ran for the hills. JB and
Banks came back out to end the second hour with more stuff for TNA
Today.
