I'm going to go out on a limb, based on my layman's understanding of
earth history, and say no.  The only time the planet was flat enough
that its water could have covered everything, it was still too hot for
there to be liquid water.

But the archaeogeologists might well tell me I'm wrong, and I might
well be.

What I can be a lot surer of is that it hasn't been completely covered
by water at any time that there has been multicellular life.

*Completely* covered?  Evidence?  As another layman, I'll go out on a
limb and say no.  Geological evidence tends to be local, and you are
asking a global question.

At least some theories of the Earth's early history talk about a time
when there were no continents.  But no dry land at all?  Probably not.
The processes that produce places like Hawaii are pretty quick and
the processes that erode Hawaii-like places away (until they are completely
below water) are pretty slow.  So there has probably been at least
some land sticking out of the water since the rains started.

No. But there isn't much evidence for anything once you get back past 4
billion years. The earth most certainly hasn't been completely covered
at any time within the past couple of billion years. Is that good enough?

It is a theory that before the first continents were formed, the

Is there evidence of a time in history when the earth had no mountains
and no elevation over about six inches?

If you are thinking about Noah's time, Mt. Ararat and presumably Mt.
Everest, the Alps, the Andes and the Rockies were already formed.
There was not enough water on the earth or in its atmosphere to cover
all of those peaks.

If perchance the water did cover all those mountains, such that a fly-

how did all that excess water drain off to?

Before the earth expanded enough to separate the continents, the

The link says nothing about water covering the planet before formation
of the first continents.  According to the snippet, Rogers
(for the purpose of the Jour Geol paper) narrowly defines continents
as 'large, stable platforms that other rocks could settle on'.

The key word is 'stable'.  He's arguing that a process he's referred
to previously as 'cratonization' didn't occur until ca. 3,000Mya (his
'Ur'), not that what we refer to today as continental crust, of
uncertain size but with portions standing above sea level, didn't
exist prior to that time.

Short answer is no.  However, at different times, much of the exposed
surface has been under water, just not all at once.  You leave a
planet out in the weather for a few billion years and you do get some
water damage to the surface.

The simplest answer is that we do not know, since all record of the
earliest crust has been obliterated by erosion, glaciation, and plate
tectonics.  Having said that, there is certainly evidence of oceans as far
back as 3.8 billion years, and likely further back still.  But as far back
as we can look, there is no evidence that it was ever completely covered
(at least, none that I am aware of).  Since there is evidence that the
plates have been moving around since the Earth first started cooling, it is
likely that there was some dry land all the way back to that time.

Thank all of you who answered.
The question came up in a class I am teaching this year in Geography
and a student asked me about Noah's Ark.
In fact, the student asked me if I &quot;believed in Noah's ark&quot;. I said
no. I mentioned a few reasons and was about to say something about the
Earth's surface never being completely covered with water, but decided
that I better check on that before I say anything regarding that
particular problem.
Again thanks,

No.  The oldest rocks that I know of are metamorphosed granitic rocks in
northern Canada - that the original rock was granite suggests there were
mountains above it.  Other very old rocks include metamorphosed sedimentary
rocks - and you can't get sediments without erosion, and you can't get
erosion without dry land.

There are hundreds of problems with the Ark story.  You can refer
the student to talkorigins.org for some coverage of the topic.  (Or
you could send the student here, but manners are oft forgot in this
forum, so maybe it's not a good idea.)

True, though as I understand it most of those erosive submarine flows
begin as a redistribution of sediment - i.e. you need pre-existing
sediment on a submarine slope to begin with - once that sediment gets
roiled into suspension you have the beginnings of a turbidity flow.
That being the case, you still need to get the original sediment by
subaerial erosion.

Ultimately, yes that could be true in some cases. However, in this
particular case, you have sediments possibly but not necessarily
originating on land building up on a continental slope, that then slips and
erodes/scours said slope as it progresses into deeper water to form a new
turbidite deposit.  At any rate, the erosion resulting in said turbidites
is subaqueous in nature.  So you can have erosion in subaqueous
environments, and I think that was my argument.  Of course, that may not
apply in the case in question, since I have no idea whether or not any of
the sediments in question are turbidites.

">

You get some sediment from the detritus of plankton, as in the ooze that
covers much of the abyssal plains. In the absence of land-derived
sediment you'd get similar deposits elsewhere - assuming the absence of
land derived sediments didn't lead to the plankton being starved for
nutriments. Sedimentation could also arise from carbonate banks.

If you have sufficiently shallow water then you can have erosion from
waves, and perhaps from tidal flows. (On a landless planet waves and
tides are likely to be bigger, the former because of a larger fetch, and
the latter due to the lack of energy sapping interactions with land.)
OTOH, there's probably a narrow line between a planet with no land and a
planet with no shallow water.

&gt;&gt; http://research.unc.edu/endeavors/spr97/ur.html

&gt;&gt;However, there may still have been islands.

&gt; Before the earth expanded enough to separate the continents, the
&gt; volume of water was more than enough to cover the much smaller surface
&gt; area to considerable depth.  That is unless the water expanded too, in
&gt; which case.....

The general concensus follows what I've read here, that no such global
flood event occured.  The flood story in Genesis appears to be an
adaptation of the earlier Gilgamesh epic that took written form
sometime during the period in which the Israelites were captives in
Babylon.
It is likely that these flood narratives reflect some actual and
localized event the occured back in the time of the Sumerians.

Ah, then you're probably adept at 'framing' an argument.  In that
case, you may be interested in some of the evidence in support of the
resounding 'No' response to your original question, none of it
involving an attack on the supernatural.  For example, here are three
well-established factoids:

Temperatures on the early Earth's surface were simply too high to
permit condensation of water vapor before a rocky crust (of whatever
composition) solidified.

Much of the water that finally did condense was contributed to the
early atmosphere during crustal-thickening and differentiation
processes (i.e. volcanic activity) that would result in less-dense
material (proto-island arcs and microcontinents with 'granitic' cores)
standing above denser proto-oceanic crust.

Some of the oldest-dated rocks are metamorphosed sediments whose
components could only have been derived (based primarily on
geochemical evidence) by subaerial erosion.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; R

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; No.  The oldest rocks that I know of are metamorphosed granitic rocks
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in northern Canada - that the original rock was granite suggests
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; there were mountains above it.  Other very old rocks include
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; metamorphosed sedimentary
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; rocks - and you can't get sediments without erosion, and you can't
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; get erosion without dry land.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Though you can get erosion via turbidites and/or subaqueous
&gt; &gt;&gt; landslides.

&gt; &gt; True, though as I understand it most of those erosive submarine flows
&gt; &gt; begin as a redistribution of sediment - i.e. you need pre-existing
&gt; &gt; sediment on a submarine slope to begin with - once that sediment gets
&gt; &gt; roiled into suspension you have the beginnings of a turbidity flow.
&gt; &gt; That being the case, you still need to get the original sediment by
&gt; &gt; subaerial erosion.

&gt; Ultimately, yes that could be true in some cases. However, in this
&gt; particular case, you have sediments possibly but not necessarily
&gt; originating on land building up on a continental slope, that then slips and
&gt; erodes/scours said slope as it progresses into deeper water to form a new
&gt; turbidite deposit.  At any rate, the erosion resulting in said turbidites
&gt; is subaqueous in nature.  So you can have erosion in subaqueous
&gt; environments, and I think that was my argument.  Of course, that may not
&gt; apply in the case in question, since I have no idea whether or not any of
&gt; the sediments in question are turbidites.
">

Sure it's submarine erosion, but your scenario very quickly runs out
of the very material needed to operate.  As sediments are distributed
downslope via turbidity currents, their distal portions on the gentler
slopes of the rise, and especially on abyssal plains, are no longer
available for re-mobilization as turbidity currents -- how do they
then reappear as unstable piles on the shelf?  I think the opening
statement 'Ultimately, yes that could be true in some cases' is more
likely '...true in nearly all cases.'

With respect to the time frame implied in the OP's question, there are
good examples of Late Archean turbidites, perhaps the best example
being the Burwash Basin turbidites in the Slave province (mind the
wrap):
&lt; http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/nrc/cjes/2005/00000042/00000006... &gt;

In addition, Archean subaerial erosion (and deposition) is well-
documented.  See, for example,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db;=PubMed&amp;list;_u
ids=11539505&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus
regarding the ca. 3.2 Ga Moodies Group.

It is -the- classic example of a tale which grew in the telling.
Especially after some hillbillies without any experience
with water or shipbuilding adopted it
to show to their betters in Babylon
hat they really were 'our kind of people' too.

The original was probably a raft, with a family,
and some pigs, goats, and poultry on it.

Granite is not formed anywhere underground. It's formed in the ground
underneath mountains.

Granite can either form from magma, in which case this implies a
continental arc setting, or (depending on what you consider a granite)
as the end product of metamorphism in hot, high-pressure conditions
(i.e. underneath newly forming mountains).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No.  The oldest rocks that I know of are metamorphosed granitic rocks in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;northern Canada - that the original rock was granite suggests there were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mountains above it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why? Granite is said to be formed underground. There is ground under
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;oceans.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Granite is not formed anywhere underground. It's formed in the ground
&gt;&gt;&gt;underneath mountains.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Granite can either form from magma, in which case this implies a
&gt;&gt;&gt;continental arc setting, or (depending on what you consider a granite)
&gt;&gt;&gt;as the end product of metamorphism in hot, high-pressure conditions
&gt;&gt;&gt;(i.e. underneath newly forming mountains).

&gt;&gt;Are you aware that there are mountains underwater? And pressure?

&gt; Yes. The wrong type of mountains.
">

What Ernest means is that the underwater mountains are made of basalt,
because the source for the melt is in the mantle. Granite, on the other
hand, needs a source in the crust, generally a subducting plate
supplemented by bits of the underside of the continent that get caught
up in the melt.

And the sort of pressure underwater is a far cry from the sort of
pressure 20 miles under a continent, which is what Ernest is talking about.

&gt;&gt; Jan

&gt; The general concensus follows what I've read here, that no such global
&gt; flood event occured.  The flood story in Genesis appears to be an
&gt; adaptation of the earlier Gilgamesh epic that took written form
&gt; sometime during the period in which the Israelites were captives in
&gt; Babylon.
&gt; It is likely that these flood narratives reflect some actual and
&gt; localized event the occured back in the time of the Sumerians.
&gt; The mythmaking adornments were added over time.
&gt; R
">

I have heard this theory exposited before, but I do not know of its verity:

The flood myth may have originated when the Bosporus was closed off,
therefore having drained the Black Sea. At some point, the strait would
have reopened, flooding a massive basin over an extended period of time
(40 days would not seem unreasonable).

The so-called &quot;Black Sea Deluge Theory&quot;

number of half-science, half-hype specials made on this theory on

It sounds kinda neat, at first, if you don't do any critical thinking on

Water ice isn't water?

I suppose water steam isn't water, either.

But but but, they are all composed of two hydrogen and one oxygen

I suppose that water plasma would also not be water, right?
