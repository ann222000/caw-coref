Stranded on a desert island, is anyone really as they seem? When one of the islanders
is murdered, it's realized that each person has been brought here for a reason -
a reason that will blow your mind and make you question what is real. Marooned -
Coming Soon!

This month's Shot In The Dark Featured Game is Wizards: The Wands of Procyon, a kid-friendly
wizard-themed game that features a theft, not a murder.

The Most Powerful Wands In History Are About To Be Stolen!

It's a normal day - at least,as normal as a day inside Hyades Wizarding School can
be, when suddenly an alarm sounds - an alarm that heralds shocking news: The ancient
and powerful Wands of Procyon have been stolen from the Torchwood Room, where they
were displayed, on loan from the Royal Wizarding Museum. The magical logs quickly
tell who was in the room at the time of the theft, and the suspects are quickly rounded
up. Back in the Torchwood Room, it's up to the students under suspicion to prove
their innocence before the security troll's memory modification is reversed and the
truth is revealed - the identity of a wizard so powerful enough to steal the legendary
Wands of Procyon!

A Note from the Mystery Maiden
Contest Winner!
Wow, what a reaction to our Harry Potter Contest. For those who missed it, those
who correctly identified at least one of the main characters who were going to die
in the final book of the Harry Potter series would be entered in a draw for a great
Harry Potter prize pack, including an officially stamped first edition copy of the
new book itself! Who else had the book finished the next day? haha.

The winner of the contest is *drumroll* Cole! Congrats, Cole! To claim your prize,
simply send me an email from the same email address you submitted your guess with
your mailing address and I will send you your Harry Potter Prize Pack!

For those waiting for previous prize packs, I appreciate your patience. A few weeks
ago we had a major snag at the t-shirt printers... a snag that is still being worked
out.

In other mystery news, I'm particularly excited about our upcoming game, MAROONED
- a LOST-themed beachfront murder with all sorts of twists and turns. We should have
it up and running by your next edition of The Reaper Reader!

Best Wishes,
Mystery Maiden

P.S. If you're interested in pre-ordering MAROONED, send me an email at mysterymai ... @shotinthedarkmysteries.com
[mailto:mysterymai ... @shotinthedarkmysteries.com] for a 20% discount and pre-order
instructions.

Feature Article: Birthday Parties Are A Piece of Cake With These 3 Easy Steps!

If it weren't for birthdays, some of us would never have an excuse to throw a party.
If you're like us, you believe birthdays are important, and should be celebrated
- but not at the expense of your sanity! Here's three easy tips to make the next
birthday party you throw a piece of cake!

1. Declare a theme

Murder mystery games are, of course, our favorite themes for a party. It makes hosting
a party simple and low-stress and ensures a great time for all of the guests. But
even if you don't host a murder mystery game, you can choose a theme that will take
off on its own and create a lively atmosphere. Some examples are: An 80's reunion,
beach party, Luau and, the old frat club classic, Toga!

2. Make it a potluck

When you're throwing a party for someone else, it's easy to rally your guests for
help with the food. When you invite people, tell them it's a &quot;Potluck for Libby's
Birthday&quot; and most guests will be more than happy to help out.

3. Recruit a decorator, or decorators

Cheesy dollar store decorations are only good when they are put up with care. Recruit
a decorator or two by asking your kids, husband, wife, boyfriend or the kid who mows
your lawn to help you blow up balloons. The pay-off? Getting to rub balloons against
their heads before sticking them to the wall.

and enjoy your piece-of-cake party!

Mini-Mystery

Here's a mini-mystery to tantalize your senses!

Up for grabs this week is yet another copy of The Curse of Frankenstein and Taste
The Blood Of Dracula, both starring Christopher Lee! Two cheesy fright-films, one
great prize. Save your brains this week - here's an easy one!

Detective Palumbo had just finished examining the body of Debbie Layne, which was
lying on couch in her plush living room.
&quot;Mrs. Layne was hit on the back of her head 3 or 4 times with the butt of that pistol,&quot;
the sleuth said.
The .45 lay on the floor near the body. Sheriff Hobbs was dusting the weapon for
fingerprints.
&quot;I've telephoned her husband at his office and only told him to come home. I dislike
breaking bad news. Will you do it?&quot; the sheriff said.
&quot;I'll do it,&quot; said Palumbo as he watched the body being removed from the scene. Then
he took a seat in a lounge chair to wait for Mr. Layne.
The ambulance drove away just as Mr. Layne arrived. He came into the living room
and asked, &quot;Where's Debbie? What's happened?&quot;
&quot;I'm sorry to have to tell you that she was murdered about 3 hours ago,&quot; said Palumbo.
&quot;Your cleaning lady found the body and called the sheriff.&quot;
&quot;I can't find any fingerprints on this gun,&quot; said the sheriff. &quot;I'll send it to the
lab.&quot;
Mr. Layne's face flushed as he got angry and said, &quot;Please find the fiend that clubbed
Debbie to death. I'll put up a twenty-five thousand dollar reward!&quot;
&quot;Save your money,&quot; said Hobbs. &quot;The murderer won't be that hard to find.&quot;
Why?
