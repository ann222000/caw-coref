&gt;Cellulosic Ethanol Technology Forum and Roundtable Discussion
&gt;February 15 (Thursday), 2007
&gt;9 am to 4 pm
&gt;South Coast AQMD Headquarters Auditorium
&gt;21865 Copley Drive
&gt;Diamond Bar, CA 91765

&gt;Transportation sources in the South Coast Air Basin are
&gt;substantial contributors of air pollution and toxic risk
&gt;affecting the residents of the South Coast Air Basin, primarily
&gt;because the fuel used in transportation sources is based on
&gt;petroleum, such as gasoline and diesel.  Such overwhelming
&gt;dependency on a single fuel makes California and this Basin
&gt;vulnerable to supply shortages and consequent severe price
&gt;hikes, that in turn could seriously affect California's ability
&gt;to move goods and people.  Alternative fuels, such as ethanol,
&gt;can reduce this dependency on petroleum and also enable this
&gt;agency to meet its targeted air quality goals.  Twenty percent
&gt;of the ethanol currently produced in the country is consumed in
&gt;California.  However, production of this corn-based ethanol is
&gt;ultimately limited by a number of factors.  To be sustainable in
&gt;the long-term and on a large scale, it is imperative that ethanol
&gt;be produced from forest and agricultural residues such as corn
&gt;stalks and rice stalks, and other plant materials including
&gt;grasses and wood grown for this purpose.

&gt;The South Coast AQMD is pleased to host this one-day technology
&gt;forum and roundtable discussion of the current and upcoming
&gt;technologies which could increase production of ethanol from
&gt;biomass sources of waste cellulose.  The morning will consist of
&gt;formal presentations by a panel of national technical experts on
&gt;the production of cellulosic ethanol.  In the afternoon, there
&gt;will be a roundtable discussion among the panelists to
&gt;facilitate a candid exchange of views and suggestions.  This
&gt;roundtable will be moderated by Dr. Charles Wyman, Ford Motor
&gt;Company Professor, University of California, Riverside.  Members
&gt;of the public will also be able to ask questions of the
&gt;Technology Forum/Roundtable participants.

&gt;The South Coast AQMD encourages anyone interested in this topic
&gt;to attend this forum free of charge.  This forum will also be
&gt;webcast live, and copies of the webcast and of all the
&gt;presentations will be posted on the AQMD's Technology
&gt;Forum/Roundtable web page at:

&gt; http://www.aqmd.gov/tao/ConferencesWorkshops/techforum.htm .

&gt;If you have further questions about this forum, contact Mr.
&gt;Ranji George, (909) 396-3255.

&gt;Seems to be like a very bad idea to go to another carbon-based fuel.
&gt;It diverts the carbon from the land, does not sequester carbon, but
&gt;puts it back into the atmosphere., and mines the soil of micronutrients.
