All Roads Lead to Checkpoints

bring Palestinians and Israelis back to darker times."

There may have been a period when all roads led to Rome, but for the
Palestinian people, all roads lead to checkpoints. The latest checkpoint
Palestinians find themselves at is not manned by Israel but rather the
ostensible mediator of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the Quartet
(which is comprised of the US, Russia, the European Union and the United
Nations).

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas came to this latest checkpoint on behalf
of the Palestinian people in hopes of passing through and finding an
extension of the peace process on the other side. The reason Abbas wasn't
permitted through: for the first time since the passing of Yasser Arafat, he
refused to leave the interests of the Palestinian people behind.

Abbas has yet to fully learn a fundamental lesson: the more willing the
circus animal jumps through the ringleader's hoops, the more hoops the
ringleader will demand the animal jump through. Sidelining the needs of
Palestinians is not the equivalent of flexibility. Acquiescing to the
Quartet's demands may make good headlines in the West, but it will not make
life easier for the 3.8 Palestinians living in the occupied territories. The
86 million dollars the US planned to transfer to Abbas was nothing more than
a bribe to sell out his people. The formation of a unity government
comprised of Hamas and Fatah, known as the Mecca agreement, was the right
step for the Palestinian people, and the right decision for Abbas.

The first goal of the unity government was to end the factional strife
between Hamas and Fatah. The second goal was to end the policy of
starvation, which was emplaced upon the Palestinian people by the West and
Israel subsequent to the overwhelming election of Hamas in last year's
parliamentary elections. The Palestinian government cannot properly function
if it lacks the funds to satisfy the salaries of the Palestinian population
and their malnutritioned families. Given the US' rhetoric and its initial
rejection of the unity government, there is no reason to believe that there
will be significant economic improvement in the occupied territories.
Therefore, unrest will continue to be the status quo and, unity or not, the
occupied territories will continue to fall apart at the seams.

While Abbas has been viewed as a moderate alternative to Hamas, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has found little use for him. Olmert views Abbas
as someone to turn to only when the US needs it. Unfortunately, the only
time the Bush administration deems it necessary for a rejuvenation of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is when a fresh debacle sparks increased
debate on the Iraq war (i.e. Bush's stunning failure to sell the troop
"surge" to the American people). The other players in the Quarter have done
little to exert their influence on the US or Israel. Independently, British
Prime Minister, Tony Blair, asserted that there are "sensible" players in
Hamas with whom the West can talk with. Convincing the US that moderate
forces exist within Hamas is not simply an arduous task; it is a mission
Blair is unwillingly to take on. This lack of backbone is a problem that
plagues the European Union, the United Nations as well as European and Arab
states in general.

The latest rekindling of the peace process was nothing more than a few
photo-ops for Secretary of State Condeleeza Rice and an official
reaffirmation that the Palestinians "won't shed their terrorist ways." What
remained missing from the speeches made by Rice and Olmert as well as the
news outlets that covered this week's events were Israel's responsibilities
under the first phase of the roadmap. Phase one of the Roadmap does call
upon the Palestinian people to recognize Israel and renounce violence. But
it also calls upon Israel to freeze all settlement activity, including
activity "needed" for natural growth. Israel, however, has done quite the
opposite; it has accelerated settlement activity and has refused to tear
down its illegal outposts. Furthermore, even after a dramatic decrease in
Palestinian violence-and a marked increase in Israeli violence-Israel has
done nothing to improve movement conditions throughout the West Bank and
continues to use collective punishment against the people of the occupied
territories.

Under international law and multiple UN resolutions, the conditions of phase
one of the roadmap is not a lawful prerequisite to ending the Israeli
occupation. The occupation is not a structure Israel has any right to.
Ending the occupation is not dependent upon whether the Palestinians
officially recognize Israel and its right to exist, nor is it dependent upon
the Palestinian people verbally renouncing violence.

Even if one were to look at the terms of the Quartet's demands, in principle
Hamas has met the three conditions set forth. Since 2005, the group has
abided by a self-imposed cease-fire and has indicated the possibilities of a
long-term hudna (truce) on several occasions. While Hamas does not verbally
"recognize Israel," it has admitted that Israel exists and has not sought
its destruction, a point which is reinforced by their calls for a long-term
hudna. Thirdly, Hamas has repeatedly said it is willingly to negotiate with
Israel through an interlocutor such as President Abbas. Both parties, Hamas
and Fatah, base their political platform on the two-state solution-the
internationally recognized route to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Hamas is not the same organization it was in 1988 and treating it like is
only serves the agendas of those who are disinterested in peace and prefer
domination and the continuation of the status quo.

The besiegement of a people can only erode moderation, foment hatred, and
bring Palestinians and Israelis back to darker times. This may be the plan
for many in the Israeli administration and it surely bodes well for many in
the US administration, but it does nothing for peace, and only dims the
prospects of a future that must be met with an end to occupation, an end to
economic sanctions, and a beginning of reconciliation based on justice for
both peoples.
