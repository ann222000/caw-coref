___________________________________________________________

Every Oxfordian website touts Oxford's 'noble blood' or as
Sobran lectures Alan Nelson on his review site of Nelson's
Oxford biography:

&quot;The de Veres traced their ancestry back to before the conquest in 1066
by William of Normandy, who was accompanied by a fighting de Vere.
The line carried
the bluest of blue blood,

probably more of it than Queen Elizabeth, since she was the daughter
of Henry 8th and
a commoner,
Anne Boleyn.&quot;

If Anne Boleyn is 'a commoner' what is Oxford?

Elizabeth may have been an upstart Tudor but Boleyn was 'a commoner'
only in the sense that her father was an earl and her grandfather a duke.

In that ultra-aristocratic sense four of Henry VIII's wives were 'commoners.'

On the other hand Oxford's mother, Margery Golding, could trace her
pedigree back only a generation or two on either side of her family.

Oxford's half-sister Catherine De Vere, however, was descended
through her mother, Dorothy Neville, from the truly bluest of blue-
blooded English families, the Nevilles.

It may or may not have incited their notorious sibling rivalry
but Catherine De Vere of the Nevilles definitely had the bluer blood.

If Oxford was 'half-commoner' it raises the question if
William Cecil--not yet Lord Burghley--used that fact to coerce
the unwilling 17th Earl to marry a commoner, Anne Cecil. Cecil,
had many aristocratic antecedents on the maternal side but
William Cecil's own pedigree stopped at his two grandfathers.

English law prohibted a member of the nobility from being
forced into a marriage with a commoner. It certainly didn't work
on Southampton whose mother was a bona fide aristocrat and
only because Elizabeth conferred a barony on Cecil did
Southampton have to pay an enormous fine for breaking the
betrothal.

Best regards,

Elizabeth

There are a number of problems of Oxfordian &quot;Earl of Oxford Theory.&quot;

Autobiographical Problems
1. Oxfordians claim that de Vere was a man of unvarnished truth.
2. They claim that the works of Shakespeare are the autobiography of
Oxford.
3. They claim that Hamlet is a representation of Oxford's circle,
Cecil being Polonius etc.
4. However, when they get to Hamlet as Oxford, they deny that Oxford
is representing himself as the son of the Queen, the Prince.
Therefore,
1. Oxford is not always telling the truth, or historically
exaggerating his position and the works are not autobiography.
2. Oxford is telling the truth, and historically must be the son of
the Queen.

Further, they ignore that if Oxford is telling his autobiography
through Shakespeare, then why are the most biographical characters
royalty. Prince Hal, Bertram, etc, and King Earl?

Historical Problems
1. Oxfordians cannot explain Cecil's deep and abiding interest in the
son of minor, lowest ranking, not too well thought of Earl of the
realm. Such as getting him with Thomas Smith, etc.
2. Historians cannot explain why Cecil would ruin a perfectly good
marriage on this wastral black sheep poet, etc., They conclude that
Cecil made a &quot;mistake.&quot; But Cecil knew full well of Oxford's
character, he lived at his hourse, etc.. Why the shrewdest man in
England would make a mistake is unexplained.
3. Why would the Queen show such an interest in this obscure young
noble, such as going to both his university commencements, (only other
one was Southampton). Strange indeed.

Contraray to what Weir says, the earliest Oxfordians stressed Oxford's
nobility, lineage etc.. More recent ones don't want to talk about it
other than give him the title. Because to discuss it, is to bring up
problems they do not want to address.

&gt; There are a number of problems of Oxfordian &quot;Earl of Oxford Theory.&quot;

&gt; Autobiographical Problems
&gt; 1. Oxfordians claim that de Vere was a man of unvarnished truth.

"/>

All Oxfordians claim that? Lord Burghley has left two diary entries
that show that Oxford could not have told the truth in the Brincknell
Inquest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2. They claim that the works of Shakespeare are the autobiography of
&gt; Oxford.

"/>

That could be true in part but it doesn't prevent Oxford's genius
cousin Francis Bacon from writing the Shakespeare works. Bacon
knew everyone Oxford knew and unlike Oxford had all the right
literary connections. Oxford's genealogy shows that he had suprisingly
few.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3. They claim that Hamlet is a representation of Oxford's circle,
&gt; Cecil being Polonius etc.

"/>

Oxford was not in that circle when Hamlet was written. He'd been
evicted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4. However, when they get to Hamlet as Oxford, they deny that Oxford
&gt; is representing himself as the son of the Queen, the Prince.

"/>

Genetically speaking, it's very unlikely that the brown-eyed
Elizabeth gave birth to the blue-eyed Oxford. As far as the
Oxfordians are concerned, I don't doubt they believe that Oxford
is Elizabeth's son, they just don't want to go the Baconian route
and who can blame them. It's too distracting. I rarely think about
it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Therefore,
&gt; 1. Oxford is not always telling the truth, or historically
&gt; exaggerating his position and the works are not autobiography.

"/>

Or his genius cousin Francis Bacon is submerging the truth on
more than one level (as the subversive Virgillian poets did).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2. Oxford is telling the truth, and historically must be the son of
&gt; the Queen.

"/>

I'm not discounting that theory entirely. Elizabeth was no
virgin--the Baconians dug up a lot of evidence in the Escurial--
the Spanish ambassador was sending regular reports on her
affair with Leicester (and pregnancies) to Philip II.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Further, they ignore that if Oxford is telling his autobiography
&gt; through Shakespeare, then why are the most biographical characters
&gt; royalty. Prince Hal, Bertram, etc, and King Earl?

"/>

The Shakespeare characters are written from life but they
also represent the historical figures from Holinshed and Hall.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Historical Problems
&gt; 1. Oxfordians cannot explain Cecil's deep and abiding interest in the
&gt; son of minor, lowest ranking, not too well thought of Earl of the
&gt; realm. Such as getting him with Thomas Smith, etc.

"/>

Are you talking about Southampton? Oxford had the second
or third highest rank after Rutland who was number two, I believe.
There's another earl that never appeared at Court--can't think of his title
at the moment--who had the highest rank. You rarely hear of him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2. Historians cannot explain why Cecil would ruin a perfectly good
&gt; marriage on this wastral black sheep poet, etc., They conclude that
&gt; Cecil made a &quot;mistake.&quot; But Cecil knew full well of Oxford's
&gt; character, he lived at his hourse, etc.. Why the shrewdest man in
&gt; England would make a mistake is unexplained.

"/>

This is not difficult. Cecil was on a construction rampage. He built
the largest house in England--Theobalds--it's still the largest private
dwelling in England--out of Oxford's accounts. Theobalds was only
one of six or seven estates--all furnished with antiquities from the
Continent--all having vast gardens. Elizabeth, Leicester and
Lord Burghley literally raped Oxford's wealth. I've said so from
the beginning. Apparently an Oxfordian has finally looked into it.
I saw a reference to a recent article on that subject on an Oxfordian
site.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3. Why would the Queen show such an interest in this obscure young
&gt; noble, such as going to both his university commencements, (only other
&gt; one was Southampton). Strange indeed.

"/>

You're saying that she had a maternal twinge? I very much
doubt it. We know absolutely that Bacon was not a Bacon--
Lady Anne Bacon left three letters stating that Bacon was
'her ward not her son''--and Lady Anne Bacon was Elizabeth's
head lady-in-waiting and her closest friend since they were
both children at Court and York House was just across the
street from Whitehall and Bacon was born just when the Spanish
ambassador was reporting her confinement to Philip, etc, etc,
but the Queene didn't bond to Bacon. She had him at the
palace for years, showing his genius off to visiting royalty but
she never 'took an interest in him.' I doubt she was capable
of maternal love. When she was only two years old her own
mother was violently taken from her by her murderous father--
Bacon called him 'that bloody man'--so there can be no doubt
that she didn't trust any relationship.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Contraray to what Weir says, the earliest Oxfordians stressed Oxford's
&gt; nobility, lineage etc.. More recent ones don't want to talk about it
&gt; other than give him the title. Because to discuss it, is to bring up
&gt; problems they do not want to address.

"/>

I agree that Oxfordians are less touting of Oxford's genealogy
but it still hangs in the air. At the same time Oxford's genealogy
looks barren next to the mob of poets, writers, scholars, intellectuals,
explorers--Gosnold is cousin to both Bacon and Oxford, for
example--adventurers, owners of acting companies--Bacon
was cousin to Cary, Hunsdon, Pembroke, Stanley, Strange,
through the Sidneys the Earl of Leicester--I believe Bacon
was related to all the earls who had companies. This explains
why 'Shakespeare' was first with the Admiral's Men and
then shifted to the Chamberlain's Men. Bacon's genealogy
is like the who's who of Elizabethan literary society.

Best regards,

Elizabeth

wrote it all down, in a manuscript which still exists today.

He described the King's royal celebration:

&quot;...we royally feasted, and the King [had] all the ordnance

'RAINBOW Portrait' of Elizabeth I, c.1600 by Isaac Oliver

&lt;&lt;Oliver was a pupil of Elizabeth's favorite court painter, Nicholas
Hilliard. The symbolism is quite detailed. Elizabeth's gown is
embroidered with English wildflowers, thus allowing the queen to pose in
the guise of Astraea, the virginal heroine of classical literature. Her
cloak is decorated with eyes and ears, implying that she sees and hears
all. Her headdress is an incredible design decorated lavishly with
pearls and rubies, and supports her royal crown. The pearls symbolize
her virginity (and the crown, of course, symbolizes her royalty.)
Pearls also adorn the transparent veil which hangs over her shoulders.
Above her crown is a crescent-shaped jewel which alludes to Cynthia, the
goddess of the moon. A jeweled serpent is entwined along her left arm,
and holds from its mouth a heart-shaped ruby. Above its head is a
celestial sphere. The serpent symbolizes wisdom; it has captured the
ruby, symbolic of the queen's heart. In other words, the queen's
passions are controlled by her wisdom. The celestial sphere echoes this
theme; it also symbolizes wisdom. Elizabeth's right hand holds a RAINBOW
with the Latin inscription 'Non sine sole iris' ('No RAINBOW without
the sun'). The RAINBOW symbolizes peace, and the inscription reminds
viewers that only the queen's wisdom can ensure peace and prosperity.
Elizabeth was in her late sixties when this portrait was made, but for
iconographic purposes she is portrayed as young and beautiful; she
is more than mortal, after all. In this portrait, she is ageless.
This portrait hangs at Hatfield House.&gt;&gt;

Speaking as one who descends from two varieties
of English puritanism, let's not forget that there were
two varieties of English puritanism. The Anglican,
not the Calvinist version of puritanism drives the
Shakespeare works. I find the Shakespeare works
refreshingly anti-Calvinist. (Did you know that Whitgift
tried to get predestination accepted as part of Anglican
doctrine?!?!?!).

When you find a smoking gun for Oxfordian authorship
we'll consider your argument, Crowley. So far only
Oxford's genius cousin Francis has produced hard

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 3. They claim that Hamlet is a representation of Oxford's circle,
&gt;&gt; Cecil being Polonius etc.

It goes much further than 'Polonius.' Bacon, like Spenser,
was writing his relatives into the plays/poems. I just discovered that
the genealogical link that Spenserians have been desperately
seeking for over a hundred years--Sir John Spencer of Althorpe--
who was related to--who else--Francis Bacon--through his antecedent
Jane Spencer. This is a huge find. The Baconians should have
been doing Bacon's family genealogy instead of digging through
the Madrid archives.

Claudius and Gertrude are allegorical figures. They

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Therefore,
&gt;&gt; 1. Oxford is not always telling the truth,

"/>

I think you're right, Crowley. There is a great deal
of idealizing and romanticizing of Oxford and it's a
shame because Oxford--in his own skin--is one of the most
fascinating of all Elizabethans--Oxfordians have neutered
him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; or historically

The works are BIOgraphy to the extent Oxford is in them.
Early Oxforidans have entangled TWO lives. Oxford's with
his 'cosen Bacon's.'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 2. Oxford is telling the truth, and historically must be the son of
&gt;&gt; the Queen.

&gt; Nope. No one claims that he is son of the
&gt; Queen of Denmark.

"/>

Baconians found documents in the Escurial that
point to Bacon as one of Elizabeth's bastards--plus
she brought Bacon, not Oxford, to Court as a very
young child--he was barely out of infancy. He must
have been the only child at Court since wives were
discouraged from coming to Court.

I think a very strong circumstantial case can be made
for Bacon as Elizabeth's son but I don't make it because
it's NURTURE not nature that made Bacon a genius and
unlike poor Oxford, the fortunate Bacon landed in the middle
of an extended family of poets, scholars and theatre company
owners. He was related to all the theatre company owners
on both sides of the doctrinal and political 'war of the theatres.'

Bacon's 'Shakespeare genealogy' is so strong Oxford's
pales in comparison and of course the Stratford grain
merchant has no 'Shakespeare genealogy' at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Money and rank. How hard is that? Other than picking his
pocket and affixing his daughter to the De Vere pedigree
Burghley had no 'personal interest' in his diminutive ward.

I've been saying this from the beginning and I've finally found
an article--I think by an Oxfordian--who says the same thing.
Burghley, Elizabeth and Leicester were robbing Oxford blind.
(I wonder if Oxfordians lurk in HLAS).

Let's just say that the ranks of the Stanleys were
slammed shut in William Cecil's face. Cecil had no
class. I wouldn't be surprised if the Sidneys didn't scotch
Philip Sidney's betrothal to Anne Cecil. I guess they were
in love so it's a shame.

I think it's indicative that Elizabeth would not give Burghley
a higher rank than 'baron.' Elizabeth did that as a nod to
her Howard cousins who did not want to admit Burghley to an
earldom. Robert Cecil, Lord Salisbury, had to buy his earldom
from James. Thomas Cecil also bought one.

That's not what Burghley's second diary entry states
and puleez, Oxford never had 'exemplary character.'

The earls were wild thangs, Crowley. They lived out
in the sticks in their own little fiefdoms. They had their
own set of rules and that was the way it was supposed
to be. Stop imposing your own puritanism on Oxford.

Sobran is correct in stating that the earls had 'private armies'
which was in fact the way the 'unwritten constitution' of England
was 'enforced.'

The earls were incumbent to overthrow the monarchy
whenever it got too full of itself--the Hapsburgs should
have been dealt with the same way--Europe would have
been a far better place had that system--and its two-class
aristocracy--been in effect on the Continent.

The problem that Sobran doesn't see is the threat of Rome's
client Philip II in 1560-1600. England would have been defeated
without that hurricane--Philip had 45,000 armed soldiers on those
galleasses--and when Philip conquered England Oxford or one of
the other Howards would have been placed on Elizabeth's Protestant
throne.

This is why the Sidney faction strived to form--consciously
construct--England as the first nation. It was the Protestant
earls against the Catholic earls. And the Sidneys succeeded.
Despite Essex. Why? Because the Sidney's political philosophy
is built into the Shakespeare plays. As Yamada stated, where
the Shakespeare plays are translated, republics soon follow.

Oxford was not on the Sidney side in this--as an earl he had
not only a self interest in keeping the monarchy weak

it was his hereditary duty to keep the monarchy
weak.

Oxford, for all his personal vagaries, was not unaware of his
hereditary duties. Oxford was a typical 16th century English
earl (castrated by early 20th c. Puritans and not all of them
Americans) but he came up against something bigger than
earldom and that was the Sidney faction's nationalism which
entailed shifting the power from the earls to the monarchy AND
Parliament.

That was the basis for Elizabeth's ongoing quarrel with the Sidney
cousin and loyalist Francis Bacon. She didn't want so much power
to be shifted to Parliament but Bacon was busy creating the modern
British parliamentary monarchy (see his constitution-founding brief for the
Case of the Post-nati--it's all in there). The Shakespeare plays were
written to reinforce the Ciceronian politics of the Sidneys. The Sidneys
and Bacon represent republican Renaissance politics. Oxford and
the other earls (except for three or four) represent their feudal hereditary
position vis a vis a weakened monarchy.

Oxfordianism which has little to do with the real Oxford--Oxford
would be agast--is, in fact, a perfect fit for the rising
New Feudalism of the American Right. Webb keeps asking why
Oxfordianism is so 'right wing.' Because it's not Renaissance
republican, that's why. The British and American-style constitutions
are English Renaissance institutions, particularly the British which
has prevailed numerically--I think that 76 of the existing republics
are British-style parliamentary republics. Thanks to Bacon the
political philosopher and the patronage of the 'English Medici,' his
Sidney cousins.
That's why.

&gt; Baconians found documents in the Escurial that
&gt; point to Bacon as one of Elizabeth's bastards--plus
&gt; she brought Bacon, not Oxford, to Court as a very
&gt; young child--he was barely out of infancy. He must
&gt; have been the only child at Court since wives were
&gt; discouraged from coming to Court.

"/>

Not true. There were always plenty of mature
women at court. For example, Oxford's mother
was appointed a Maid of Honour on Elizabeth's
accession in November 1588. The young Oxford
(then aged 8) would have often attended court
and highly probably lived there at times.

The 'honeymoon' period of Elizabeth's reign was
astonishingly vibrant -- full of colour, confidence
and promise. We can assume, for Shakespeare,
great precocity; and that such a time was the
making of his character, that he would have
absorbed all of what was happening, and that,
even if young, would have taken part in much of it.

By the time Bacon first attended court (?~1575),
it had become relatively settled and staid.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think a very strong circumstantial case can be made

Stories about &quot;Elizabeth's sons&quot; are the ultimate
in worthlessness. How can someone, 400 years
after the event, claim to know more than the
people around at the time? Do they think that
those present would not have noticed? Or that
such a thing would not have mattered to them?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but I don't make it because
&gt; it's NURTURE not nature that made Bacon a genius and
&gt; unlike poor Oxford, the fortunate Bacon landed in the middle
&gt; of an extended family of poets, scholars and theatre company
&gt; owners.

"/>

So have lots of others. Did Bacon's father
(or his grandfather before him) have his own
company of players, who performed for the
family in the long winter evenings when he
was small child? Oxford had all that. While
Mary I was on the throne, his parents mostly
stayed at home, giving him the best possible
kind of education for that stage of his life.
Remember that his mother was the sister of
Arthur Golding -- and that this famous Latin
scholar also lived with Oxford in Burghley's
house when 'he' was writing 'his' translation
of Ovid's Metamorphoses.

You have nothing to compare with that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>

It's grossly exaggerated IMHO; and those who
maintain this line don't grasp the realities of the
position of aristocrats under Tudor monarchs.
Their wealth often (even usually) depended on
how the monarch regarded them. They usually
owed vast amounts to the Crown (for one
reason or another). Whether (or when) it had
to be paid (or not) depended entirely on the
monarch's whim.

&gt;&gt; Cecil wanted his descendants to be born into

&gt; Let's just say that the ranks of the Stanleys were

&gt; 'RAINBOW Portrait' of Elizabeth I, c.1600 by Isaac Oliver
&gt; http://englishhistory.net/tudor/monarchs/eliz/images.html

&gt;&lt;&lt;Oliver was a pupil of Elizabeth's favorite court painter, Nicholas
&gt; Hilliard. The symbolism is quite detailed. Elizabeth's gown is
&gt; embroidered with English wildflowers, thus allowing the queen to pose in
&gt; the guise of Astraea, the virginal heroine of classical literature. Her
&gt; cloak is decorated with eyes and ears, implying that she sees and hears
&gt; all. Her headdress is an incredible design decorated lavishly with
&gt; pearls and rubies, and supports her royal crown. The pearls symbolize
&gt; her virginity (and the crown, of course, symbolizes her royalty.)
&gt; Pearls also adorn the transparent veil which hangs over her shoulders.
&gt; Above her crown is a crescent-shaped jewel which alludes to Cynthia, the
&gt; goddess of the moon. A jeweled serpent is entwined along her left arm,
&gt; and holds from its mouth a heart-shaped ruby. Above its head is a
&gt; celestial sphere. The serpent symbolizes wisdom; it has captured the
&gt; ruby, symbolic of the queen's heart. In other words, the queen's
&gt; passions are controlled by her wisdom. The celestial sphere echoes this
&gt; theme; it also symbolizes wisdom. Elizabeth's right hand holds a RAINBOW
&gt; with the Latin inscription 'Non sine sole iris' ('No RAINBOW without
&gt; the sun'). The RAINBOW symbolizes peace, and the inscription reminds
&gt; viewers that only the queen's wisdom can ensure peace and prosperity.
&gt; Elizabeth was in her late sixties when this portrait was made, but for
&gt; iconographic purposes she is portrayed as young and beautiful; she
&gt; is more than mortal, after all. In this portrait, she is ageless.
&gt; This portrait hangs at Hatfield House.&gt;&gt;

Irises were on Louis VII's crusade banner in 1147 and were called
fleur de Louis. This in turn became fleur de lis, a famous design

The Romans, Egyptians, and Moors have used Iris extensively as a

with players and playwrights and information about costumes and props:

[FLEDGED] HALCYONE Days [Bulfinch's Mythology]

&lt;&lt;Iris puts on her robe of many colours, and tinging the sky
with her bow, seeks the palace of the King of SLEEP. Near the Cimmerian
country, a mountain cave is the abode of the dull god Somnus. Here
Phoebus dares not come, either rising, at midday, or setting. Clouds &amp;
shadows are exhaled from the ground, and the light glimmers faintly. The
bird of dawning, with crested head, never there calls aloud to Aurora
(Eos), nor watchful dog, nor more sagacious goose disturbs the silence.
No wild beast, nor cattle, nor branch moved with the wind, nor sound of
human conversation, breaks the stillness. Silence reigns there; but from
the bottom of the rock the River Lethe flows, and by its murmur invites
to SLEEP. Poppies grow abundantly before the door of the cave, and other
herbs, from whose juices Night (Nyx) collects SLUMBERs, which she
scatters over the darkened earth. There is no gate to the mansion, to
creak on its hinges, nor any watchman; but in the midst a couch of
black ebony, adorned with black plumes and black curtains. There the
god reclines, his limbs relaxed with SLEEP. Around him lie dreams,
resembling all various forms, as many as the harvest bears stalks,
or the forest leaves, or the seashore sand grains.
As soon as the goddess entered and brushed away the dreams that hovered
around her, her brightness lit up all the cave. The god, scarce opening
his eyes, and ever and anon dropping his beard upon his breast, at last
shook himself free from himself, leaning on his arm, inquired her
errand,- for he knew who she was. She answered, &quot;Somnus, gentlest of
the gods, tranquillizer of minds and soother of care-worn hearts,
Juno sends you her commands that you despatch a dream to Halcyone,
in the city of Trachine (Trikkala?), representing her
lost husband and all the events of the wreck.&quot;

Having delivered her message, Iris hasted away, for she could not longer
endure the stagnant air, and as she felt drowsiness creeping over her,
she made her escape, and returned by her bow the way she came...

[Halcyone] went to the seashore, and sought the spot where
she last saw Ceyx, on his departure. &quot;While he lingered here, and cast
off his tacklings, he gave me his last kiss.&quot;

There was built out from the shore a mole, constructed to break the
assaults of the sea. [Halcyone] leaped upon this barrier
and (it was wonderful she could do so) she flew, and striking the
air with WINGS PRODUCED ON THE INSTANT, skimmed along the surface of
the water, an unhappy bird. As she flew, her throat poured forth sounds
full of grief, and like the voice of one lamenting. When she touched
the mute and bloodless body, she enfolded its beloved limbs with her
new-formed wings, and tried to give kisses with her horny beak. Whether
Ceyx felt it, or whether it was only the action of the waves, those who
looked on doubted, but the body seemed to raise its head. But indeed he
did feel it, and by the pitying gods both of them were changed into
birds. They mate and have their young ones. For seven placid days, in
winter time, Halcyone broods over her nest, which floats upon the sea.
Then the way is safe to seamen.

The following lines from Byron's &quot;Bride of Abydos&quot; might seem borrowed
from the concluding part of this description, if it were not stated
that the author derived the suggestion from observing
the motion of a floating corpse:

&quot;As shaken on his restless pillow,
His head heaves with the heaving billow;
That hand, whose motion is not life,

are Anglican-Puritan just as the Marprelate Tracts are
quintessential Anglican-Puritan doctrinal statements.

The Anglican-Puritans were a faction within the Anglican
Church that wanted to reform ritual and vestment but this
faction also had a nationalistic pro-England political agenda.
Bacon's cousins the Sidney-Herberts and Robert Dudley and
Essex were the Anglican-Puritan leaders at Court. There were
also Anglican-Puritan factions within the Anglican episcopy and at
Cambridge.

The Anglican-Puritan Court faction lost power with the execution
of Essex but Bacon, his cousins Pembroke, Montgomery, Salisbury, his
friends Digges, Sandys, and Hooker carried on as leaders of the
Virginia Company and in Parliament.

You're stereotyping the Anglican-Puritans as New England Calvinist
Puritans. The Anglican-Puritans were hardly 'puritan.' Sir John
Falstaff
is an Anglican-Puritan type (Prof. Kristen Poole).

Oh, come on, David. You're overlooking the obvious. Oxford
was born when Edward VI was on the throne. Obviously, Oxford
was the son of 13-year-old King Edward and his 17-year-old half-sister
Elizabeth, the future queen, after they had been secretly married
to preserve the rule of the Templars. Get on the ball, man!

factions, not to an &quot;Anglican-Puritan&quot; faction! Here is the quotation
in context:

&quot;The most important religious groups, besides the Anglican state
church, were Catholic and Calvinist minorities, the latter referred
to as PURITANS.

[Note that Puritans are here *distinguished from* Anglicans.]

&quot;The expression 'Puritan' appeared first in 1564; in 1569 a Puritan

&gt; That could be true in part but it doesn't prevent Oxford's genius

The autobiography of Oxford can scarcely have been written by Bacon.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 4. However, when they get to Hamlet as Oxford, they deny that Oxford

&gt; Genetically speaking, it's very unlikely that the brown-eyed
&gt; Elizabeth gave birth to the blue-eyed Oxford.

"/>

It's very unlikely for many other reasons having little to do with
genetics. For one thing, unless Elizabeth endured the longest human
pregnancy on record (surpassing even the gestation period of an
elephant), Oxford wouldd have to have been posthumously begotten, at
least if Mr. Streitz's conjecture concerning his paternity is correct.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As far as the
&gt; Oxfordians are concerned, I don't doubt they believe that Oxford
&gt; is Elizabeth's son, they just don't want to go the Baconian route
&gt; and who can blame them. It's too distracting. I rarely think about
&gt; it.

"/>

The last two words are superfluous.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Therefore,
&gt;&gt; 1. Oxford is not always telling the truth, or historically
&gt;&gt; exaggerating his position and the works are not autobiography.
&gt; Or his genius cousin Francis Bacon is submerging the truth on
&gt; more than one level (as the subversive Virgillian poets did).
&gt;&gt; 2. Oxford is telling the truth, and historically must be the son of
&gt;&gt; the Queen.
&gt; I'm not discounting that theory entirely.

"/>

Of course not! Elizabeth possesses the remarkable capacity of making
*anyone*, even Mr. Streitz, appear positively sane by comparison.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Elizabeth was no
&gt; virgin--the Baconians dug up a lot of evidence in the Escurial--
&gt; the Spanish ambassador was sending regular reports on her
&gt; affair with Leicester (and pregnancies) to Philip II.

"/>

No doubt the Spaniards also knew exactly where her weapons of mass
destruction were concealed.

[...]
&gt;&gt; Historical Problems

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 1. Oxfordians cannot explain Cecil's deep and abiding interest in the
&gt;&gt; son of minor, lowest ranking, not too well thought of Earl of the
&gt;&gt; realm. Such as getting him with Thomas Smith, etc.
&gt; Are you talking about Southampton? Oxford had the second
&gt; or third highest rank after Rutland who was number two, I believe.
&gt; There's another earl that never appeared at Court--can't think of his title
&gt; at the moment--who had the highest rank. You rarely hear of him.

"/>

What a pity! If Elizabeth ever remembers whom she is talking about,
surely he should be promptly enlisted as a new Shakespeare authorship
candidate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 2. Historians cannot explain why Cecil would ruin a perfectly good
&gt;&gt; marriage on this wastral black sheep poet, etc., They conclude that
&gt;&gt; Cecil made a &quot;mistake.&quot; But Cecil knew full well of Oxford's
&gt;&gt; character, he lived at his hourse, etc.. Why the shrewdest man in
&gt;&gt; England would make a mistake is unexplained.
&gt; This is not difficult. Cecil was on a construction rampage. He built
&gt; the largest house in England--Theobalds--it's still the largest private
&gt; dwelling in England--out of Oxford's accounts. Theobalds was only
&gt; one of six or seven estates--all furnished with antiquities from the
&gt; Continent--all having vast gardens. Elizabeth, Leicester and
&gt; Lord Burghley literally raped Oxford's wealth. I've said so from
&gt; the beginning. Apparently an Oxfordian has finally looked into it.
&gt; I saw a reference to a recent article on that subject on an Oxfordian
&gt; site.

&gt; but the Queene didn't bond to Bacon. She had him at the
&gt; palace for years, showing his genius off to visiting royalty but
&gt; she never 'took an interest in him.' I doubt she was capable
&gt; of maternal love. When she was only two years old her own
&gt; mother was violently taken from her by her murderous father--
&gt; Bacon called him 'that bloody man'--so there can be no doubt
&gt; that she didn't trust any relationship.
&gt;&gt; Contraray [sic] to what Weir says, the earliest Oxfordians stressed Oxford's
&gt;&gt; nobility, lineage etc.. More recent ones don't want to talk about it
&gt;&gt; other than give him the title. Because to discuss it, is to bring up
&gt;&gt; problems they do not want to address.

&gt; looks barren

&gt;&gt;&gt; There are a number of problems of Oxfordian &quot;Earl of Oxford Theory.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Autobiographical Problems
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Oxfordians claim that de Vere was a man of unvarnished truth.
&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. They claim that the works of Shakespeare are the autobiography of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford.

&gt;&gt; That could be true in part but it doesn't prevent Oxford's genius
&gt;&gt; cousin Francis Bacon from writing the Shakespeare works.

&gt; The autobiography of Oxford can scarcely have been written by Bacon.

"/>

Why not, David? At least, why not his BIography? Most Orthodoxists (new
word, Bob) appear to believe that bits of Oxford's biography were written by
Shakespeare of Stratford.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. However, when they get to Hamlet as Oxford, they deny that Oxford
&gt;&gt;&gt; is representing himself as the son of the Queen, the Prince.

&gt;&gt; Genetically speaking, it's very unlikely that the brown-eyed
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth gave birth to the blue-eyed Oxford.

&gt; It's very unlikely for many other reasons having little to do with
&gt; genetics. For one thing, unless Elizabeth endured the longest human
&gt; pregnancy on record (surpassing even the gestation period of an
&gt; elephant), Oxford wouldd have to have been posthumously begotten, at
&gt; least if Mr. Streitz's conjecture concerning his paternity is correct.

"/>

First, a brown-eyed mother can easily give birth to a blue-eyed son. Brown,
I believe is dominant, so she would need to carry a blue gene, and said son
could also have either a brown- or green-eyed father, as long as the father
had a recessive blue gene. Son could also, of course, have a blue-eyed
father.

Second, how are we so sure of the colours of their eyes? Portraiture is
unreliable and often dictated by fashion.

Third, one assumes that if Seymour was Oxford's father (is that what Mr.
Steitz is saying?) then Oxford was born earlier than April 1550.

Not that I believe any of it.

&gt; Burghley had no 'personal interest' in his diminutive ward.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Historians cannot explain why Cecil would ruin a perfectly good
&gt;&gt;&gt; marriage on this wastral black sheep poet, etc., They conclude that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cecil made a &quot;mistake.&quot;
&gt;&gt; Oxford's character was not far from exemplary
&gt;&gt; in 1571
&gt; That's not what Burghley's second diary entry states
&gt; and puleez, Oxford never had 'exemplary character.'

&gt; The earls were wild thangs, Crowley. They lived out
&gt; in the sticks in their own little fiefdoms. They had their
&gt; own set of rules and that was the way it was supposed
&gt; to be. Stop imposing your own puritanism on Oxford.

"/>

Has *anyone* managed to read this far without laughing aloud?!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sobran is correct in stating that the earls had 'private armies'
&gt; which was in fact the way the 'unwritten constitution' of England
&gt; was 'enforced.'

&gt; The earls were incumbent [sic] to overthrow the monarchy
&gt; whenever it got too full of itself--the Hapsburgs should
&gt; have been dealt with the same way--Europe would have
&gt; been a far better place had that system--and its two-class
&gt; aristocracy--been in effect on the Continent.

&gt; The problem that Sobran doesn't see is the threat of Rome's
&gt; client Philip II in 1560-1600. England would have been defeated
&gt; without that hurricane--Philip had 45,000 armed soldiers on those
&gt; galleasses--and when Philip conquered England Oxford or one of
&gt; the other Howards would have been placed on Elizabeth's Protestant
&gt; throne.

&gt; This is why the Sidney faction strived to form--consciously
&gt; construct--England as the first nation. It was the Protestant
&gt; earls against the Catholic earls. And the Sidneys succeeded.
&gt; Despite Essex. Why? Because the Sidney's political philosophy
&gt; is built into the Shakespeare plays. As Yamada stated, where
&gt; the Shakespeare plays are translated, republics soon follow.

"/>

This is surely one of the funniest assertions I have *ever* seen in
h.l.a.s.! Spanish translations of Shakespeare have long existed
(Macpherson's appeared in the 1800s), yet it took quite a while for
Spain to rid itself of the monarchy -- but perhaps Elizabeth sees
Franco's Spain as a shining instance of the indomitable triumph of
republicanism precipitated by translations of the Shakespeare canon.
Nor did the ruthless and murderous Argentine military dictatorship of
the 1980s bear much resemblance to a republic. Elizabeth must also be
blithely unaware of the existence of Russian translations of
Shakespeare, with _Hamlet_ appearing in the mid-1700s and the complete
works by 1870. Yet it appears to have taken the Russians well over a
century to found anything much resembling a republic, and even then the
outcome appears to owe far more to Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and others than
to Shakespeare. For that matter, the superb German translation of
Schlegel was complete by the mid-1800s, yet Germany's republican form of
government has not always been evident for memorable parts of the past
century. But history is not Elizabeth's strong suit either.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Oxford was not on the Sidney side in this--as an earl he had
&gt; not only a self interest in keeping the monarchy weak

&gt; it was his hereditary duty to keep the monarchy
&gt; weak.

&gt; Oxford, for all his personal vagaries, was not unaware of his
&gt; hereditary duties. Oxford was a typical 16th century English
&gt; earl (castrated by early 20th c. Puritans and not all of them
&gt; Americans) but he came up against something bigger than
&gt; earldom and that was the Sidney faction's nationalism which
&gt; entailed shifting the power from the earls to the monarchy AND
&gt; Parliament.

&gt; That was the basis for Elizabeth's ongoing quarrel with the Sidney
&gt; cousin and loyalist Francis Bacon. She didn't want so much power
&gt; to be shifted to Parliament but Bacon was busy creating the modern
&gt; British parliamentary monarchy

"/>

Why didn't Bacon just skip all that and found a republic, as
inevitably happens wherever his works are translated?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (see his constitution-founding brief for the
&gt; Case of the Post-nati--it's all in there). The Shakespeare plays were
&gt; written to reinforce the Ciceronian politics of the Sidneys. The Sidneys
&gt; and Bacon represent republican Renaissance politics. Oxford and
&gt; the other earls (except for three or four) represent their feudal hereditary
&gt; position vis a vis a weakened monarchy.

&gt; Oxfordianism which has little to do with the real Oxford--Oxford
&gt; would be agast [sic]

"/>

According to Aubrey it was the Queen who was a-gass'd, but Oxford did
participate in the affair.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; --is, in fact, a perfect fit for the rising
&gt; New Feudalism of the American Right. Webb keeps asking why
&gt; Oxfordianism is so 'right wing.'

"/>

No, I have never said that Oxfordianism was particularly &quot;right wing&quot;
-- on the contrary, I have surmised that that the political mean of the
Oxfordian population approximates that of the general popoulation, but
that the standard deviation is much larger, due probably to the the
attraction of eccentrics from both ends of the political spectrum to the
Oxfordian cause. The appearance of a right-wing link with Oxfordianism
probably arises merely because a small handful of right-wing Oxfordians
-- Enoch Powell, Lord Burford, Joseph Sobran, etc. -- are merely more
conspicuous than their Oxfordian left-of-center counterparts. Plainly,
Elizabeth cannot read:

&gt;&gt; Yes, some Oxfordians are (relatively) sane. Hamlet is also the son
&gt;&gt; of a king who was married to the Queen when he was slain. If Gertrude
&gt;&gt; is Elizabeth I, then which slain king in English history could that
&gt;&gt; possibly be?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Oxford is not always telling the truth, or historically
&gt;&gt;&gt; exaggerating his position and the works are not autobiography.
&gt;&gt; The works *certainly* are not autobiography. Oxford, whatever his
&gt;&gt; other titles, was never Prince of Denmark. Nor was he ever a hunchback,
&gt;&gt; a Roman general, the estranged consort of a fairy queen, or even a
&gt;&gt; Scottish thane.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Oxford is telling the truth, and historically must be the son of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Queen.
&gt;&gt; If he is telling the truth in the literal fashion favored by future
&gt;&gt; Senator Streitz, he must also be the son of the King. Since the realm
&gt;&gt; was without a King for most of Oxford's life, he certainly could not
&gt;&gt; have been reporting historical truth with any fidelity in the play.
&gt; Oh, come on, David. You're overlooking the obvious. Oxford
&gt; was born when Edward VI was on the throne. Obviously, Oxford
&gt; was the son of 13-year-old King Edward and his 17-year-old half-sister
&gt; Elizabeth, the future queen, after they had been secretly married
&gt; to preserve the rule of the Templars. Get on the ball, man!

"/>

Of course -- it all makes sense now! This is merely yet another of
the instances of incest pointed out by Mr. Streitz (I had already lost
count of them by the time I finished his book; what's one more?). I'm
ashamed to have overlooked so completely the glaringly obvious.

Of course, the Mexican Reconquista, which I also overlooked
completely, did not for a moment escape the vigilance of Mr. Streitz:

&quot;This is not to mention _Reconquista_, Mexico's policy of flooding
the Southwest with Mexicans to force California, New Mexico, Arizona
and Texas to become part of Mexico. It's working. Does that sound
too crazy? Well, in August 2001, what did you think about Islamic
threats to destroy the World Trade Center?&quot;

Clearly, Mr. Streitz will make an excellent senator:

I have to defend Lizzie here, in part. During their early phase, the
Puritans aimed at further reform within the Church of England. From a
twenty-first-century viewpoint, it's hard to regard them as &quot;Anglican&quot;,

from their own viewpoint, they would have thought themselves so (if the

&gt;&gt; There's plenty of scientific theory in the Shakespeare works.

&gt; Examples?

"/>

Here's one of about twenty activities on science in the Shakespeare
plays put together by Tufts University with a grant from the Wright
Center for Science Education.

&lt;&gt;

Passage 1 - Act 1; Scene 2

Brutus: No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
But by reflection, by some other things.

Cassius: Tis just,
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye
That you might see your shadow....

Activity for Passage 1

Students will be given a diagram of the eye (page 22) and will trace
the path of light as it goes into the eye. An overhead transparency
may be used in order for the teacher to illustrate the difference
between the appearance of the object and the appearance of the image
(inverted, smaller). A presentation of the properties of light should
follow, using the key terms reflection, refraction, real image,
virtual image, plane mirror, convex mirror, concave mirror, convex
lens, and concave lens. If such mirrors and lenses are available, they
should be demonstrated to the students in order that they observe the
difference between images in the different mirrors. A description of
the application of these physical concepts to vision is essential.

I can't think of any poet who made scientific observations in
verse before Francis Bacon, can you?

Best regards,

Elizabeth

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are a number of problems of Oxfordian &quot;Earl of Oxford
Theory.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Autobiographical Problems
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Oxfordians claim that de Vere was a man of unvarnished truth.
&gt;&gt;&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. They claim that the works of Shakespeare are the autobiography
of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That could be true in part but it doesn't prevent Oxford's genius
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cousin Francis Bacon from writing the Shakespeare works.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The autobiography of Oxford can scarcely have been written by
Bacon.

&gt;&gt; Why not, David? At least, why not his BIography?

&gt; Mr. Streitz said *auto*biography.

"/>

Right, that's why I said BIography, which fits neatly with Oxford's sexual
proclivities.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Most Orthodoxists (new
&gt;&gt; word, Bob) appear to believe that bits of Oxford's biography were
written by
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford.

&gt; Can you be specific, Lynne?

"/>

Well, it's five to one and I just got back from a reading, but I'd say
Oxford says in a letter that he's lame (thanks to Alan Nelson for this) and
Shakespeare says it in the sonnets. Oxford also says in a letter, &quot;I am that
I am.&quot; Shakespeare says it in the sonnets. He's either aping Oxford or God.
There's a canopy in the answer somewhere too, but I'm too tired to think
about it, having just changed Bob Grumman into a bunny rabbit, which took
some sleight of hand, I can tell you. Bob is about 6 ft 3.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. However, when they get to Hamlet as Oxford, they deny that
Oxford
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is representing himself as the son of the Queen, the Prince.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Genetically speaking, it's very unlikely that the brown-eyed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabeth gave birth to the blue-eyed Oxford.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's very unlikely for many other reasons having little to do with
&gt;&gt;&gt; genetics. For one thing, unless Elizabeth endured the longest human
&gt;&gt;&gt; pregnancy on record (surpassing even the gestation period of an
&gt;&gt;&gt; elephant), Oxford wouldd have to have been posthumously begotten, at
&gt;&gt;&gt; least if Mr. Streitz's conjecture concerning his paternity is correct.

&gt;&gt; First, a brown-eyed mother can easily give birth to a blue-eyed son.

&gt; The above emphatically should *not* be construed as an implicit
&gt; endorsement of Elizabeth's crank genetics! I meant merely that Mr.
&gt; Streitz's scenario is unlikely for more quotidian, purely chronological
&gt; reasons. Of course Elizabeth's ignorance of genetics is exceeded only
&gt; her ignorance of mathematics, physics, foreign languages, English,
&gt; philosophy, history, and linguistics.

&gt;&gt; Brown,
&gt;&gt; I believe is dominant, so she would need to carry a blue gene, and said
son
&gt;&gt; could also have either a brown- or green-eyed father, as long as the
father
&gt;&gt; had a recessive blue gene. Son could also, of course, have a blue-eyed
&gt;&gt; father.

&gt;&gt; Second, how are we so sure of the colours of their eyes? Portraiture is
&gt;&gt; unreliable and often dictated by fashion.

&gt; Not to Elizabeth, who apparently hallucinates that she can ascertain
&gt; whether Southampton is wearing a wig in one of his portraits! If you
&gt; missed that thread, let me know and I'll post the URL -- Elizabeth was
&gt; truly at her best then.

&gt;&gt; Third, one assumes that if Seymour was Oxford's father (is that what Mr.
&gt;&gt; Steitz is saying?)

&gt; It is indeed. (Mr. Streitz lists the rest of Elizabeth's
&gt; illegitimate progeny elsewhere in the book.)

&gt;&gt; then Oxford was born earlier than April 1550.

&gt; Indeed -- that was my point about the necessity of posthumous
&gt; conception.

"/>

My adopted son was born three months before the birthdate the adoption
agency gave us. We thought him a really brilliant baby till we got his birth
certificate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Not that I believe any of it.

&gt; Well, you are certainly among the saner anti-Stratfordians, Lynne.

"/>

I am just among the saner, David, whether we are talking about
anti-Stratfordians or Orthodoxists.

"/>

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Elwood P. Dowd is a friendly, likeable drunk who has a best friend named
HARVEY, a 6 ft 3 and a half inch invisible white rabbit. HARVEY is a pooka
[e.g., Puck of Pook's Hill - Rudyard Kipling] , which is described in the
movie as, &quot;From old Celtic mythology, a fairy spirit in animal form, always
very large. The pooka appears here and there, now and then, to this one and
that one. A benign but mischievous creature very fond of rumpots, crackpots,
and....&quot;

Elwood P. Dowd tries, all through the movie, to introduce HARVEY to everyone
he meets but the only one who eventually sees him is Dr. Chumley, the
psychiatrist. Dowd's sister Veta sometimes acknowledges the existence of
HARVEY but only when she's under extreme stress.

This excellent lighthearted film was adapted from the Pulitzer Prize winning
hit play written by Mary Chase. Josephine Hull won a best supporting actress
Oscar for her portrayal of Elwood P. Dowd's long suffering sister Veta
Louise Simmons. James Stewart, who plays Dowd, was nominated for best actor
in this 1950 film but lost out to Jose Ferrer in Cyrano de Bergerac.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------
one HARVEY, my Lord of Oxford's man,
---------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;On 22nd June, 1582: &quot;Upon Friday last, in the afternoon,&quot; they saw one
called GASTRELL and &quot;maned&quot;' to be my Lord of Oxford's man draw his sword
upon 3 or 4 of Mr. Knyvet's men. And one of Mr. Knyvet's men said twice or
thrice: &quot;Put up thy sword GASTRELL, we will not deal with thee here, there
is no place here,&quot; and xxxred the street to bear witness. GASTRELL replied
and said he would fight with them, and one HARVEY, my Lord of Oxford's man,
would have parted the fray and willed GASTRELL to put up his sword, which he
did accordingly. And then one of Mr. Knyvet's men said: &quot;GASTRELL, another
time use thy discretion.&quot; Whereupon GASTRELL drew again and ran upon one of
Mr. Knyvet's men furiously; and they struck 5 or 6 blows, and Mr. Knyvet's
man hurt GASTRELL. The rest of Mr. Knyvet's men had their swords drawn but
struck not at all. HARVEY, my Lord of Oxford's man, with his sword drawn,
would have parted the fray and (according to Bothame) was hurt by chance,
by GASTRELL, for he did not see any of Mr. Knyvet's men strike at him,
or he at any of them.&quot;

The part played by HARVEY here may be of special interest to students of
the Elizabethan literary world, for though no Christian name is given, this
was in all probability Spenser's and Sidney's friend and Nashe's enemy,
the eccentric Cambridge don, [G]abriel [H]ARVEY; who is known to have
been a protégé of the Earl of Oxford at about this time. There is no
evidence that either Oxford or Knyvet was present on this occasion&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;1583: GASTRELL avenged the day at Blackfriars. He killed one of Knyvet's
men called Long Tom. This comes ot in a letter of March 12th from Burghley
to Christopher Hatton. Long Tom, [a former Oxford man], was &quot;a bad
fellow&quot; and Burghley says he is sending Hatton the records of the Coroner's
inquest acquitting [former Oxford man] GASTRELL.&gt;&gt; CO2 p. 653
----------------------------------------------------------------
THE NAMES IN WRITING OF Oxford's PRINCIPAL MEN.

[G]astrell [H]orsleye
[G]abriel [H]arvey
----------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;the Blackfriars affair: June 18, 1582: The junior master of
Caverley's fencing-school, which shared Blackfriars with the theatre,
was able to name Oxford's two men as [G]astrell and [H]orsleye:
&quot;Seeing swords drawn, and having only about him a single sword,
he went in amongst them--- only to keep the peace.&quot;&gt;&gt; CO2 p. 652
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Apocrypha 1 Esdras 6:9

*Building an house unto the Lord, great and new* , of hewn and costly
STONEs, and the TIMBER already laid upon the walls. Then asked we
these elders, saying, By whose commandment build ye this house,
and lay the foundations of these works? Therefore to the intent
that we might give knowledge unto thee by writing,
we demanded of them who were the chief doers, and

WE REQUIRED OF THEM THE NAMES
IN WRITING OF THEIR PRINCIPAL MEN.

So they gave us this answer, We are the servants of the Lord which
made heaven and earth. And as for this house, it was builded many years
ago by a king of Israel great and strong, and was finished. But when
our fathers provoked God unto wrath, and sinned against the Lord
of Israel which is in heaven, he gave them over into the power
of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, of the Chaldees;

WHO PULLED DOWN THE HOUSE, and BURNED IT,
and carried away the people captives unto Babylon.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1613 The First Globe BURNED
1644 The Second Globe PULLED DOWN
1759 Francis GASTRELL PULLED DOWN &amp; BURNED New Place
----------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;At his death, the house passed to his daughter, Susanna, and her
husband, Dr John Hall, and then to their daughter and son-in-law,
Elizabeth &amp; Thomas Nash. New Place was sold in 1675 to Sir Edward
WALKER, and passed from him to his daughter and, in 1699, into the
Clopton family. It was extensively rebuilt by Sir John Clopton,
who settled it on his son, Hugh, in 1702 before it was ready for
reoccupation. When Sir Hugh died, it passed to his daughters, who sold
it to the Reverend Francis GASTRELL in 1756. He demolished it in 1759.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;A subsequent owner, Rev Francis GASTRELL, the Canon of Lichfield,
spent only half of each year in the house and disputed having
to pay full rates on the property. The town council disagreed,
so in 1759 HE BURNT THE HOUSE DOWN.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------------

New Place remained in possession of Shakespeare's successors
until the Restoration; it was then purchased by the Clopton family:
about 1752 it was sold by the executor of Sir Hugh to a clergyman
of the name of Francis GASTRELL, who, on some offence
taken at the authorities of the borough of Stratford,
on the subject of rating the house, PULLED IT DOWN,

and cut down the MULBERRY tree.
According to a letter in the Annual Register of 1760,
the wood was bought by a silver-smith,
who &quot;made many odd things of it for the curious.&quot;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; I can't think of any poet who made scientific observations in
&gt;&gt; verse before Francis Bacon, can you?

&gt; Lucretius and Dante, to mention the first two who spring to mind.

"/>

I simply forgot about De Rerum Natura which was a huge
influence on Francis Bacon.

Dante wouldn't have occurred to me because I see him
as an idealist, not an empiricist.

I can't believe that Lucretius was not an influence on 'Shakespeare.'
De Rerum Natura seems to have been translated only in 1656 but
it must have been available in Latin. Strats tend to limit the sources
to what the Stratford grain merchant could have known except for
the impossible Strachey letter, of course.

Thanks

Elizabeth

Lucretius was an empiricist? An odd concept of empiricism. And I'd be
interested in hearing about Shakespearean passages that were palpably
influenced by De Rerum Natura.

I'm not disputing the existence of the term &quot;Anglican-Puritan&quot; or
even its appropriateness; rather, I'm noting that several of the sources
that Elizabeth cites (from an indiscriminate web-grep whose results she
plainly has not read) are *not* using &quot;Anglican-Puritan&quot; in the sense
that Elizabeth assumes. In particular, I would like to see a quotation
from Kristen Poole asserting that Falstaff was an &quot;Anglican-Puritan
type.&quot; One knows by now that whenever Elizabeth attributes an opinion
to someone, the likelihood is overwhelming that the person never said
anything of the kind, as the examples of Akrigg, Dogariu-Kuzmich-Wang,
Hsu, Kathman, Rips, etc. abundantly attest.

I searched Lucretius + empiricism and found this:

(Lucretius') was a vision of the &quot;open society&quot; -- and of the empirical
inquiry method necessary for sustaining it -- as the only lasting protection
against authoritarianism.

&lt;&gt;

Strats, blinded as they are by the influential notion that 'Shakespeare
wrote only for money,' can't see that the works are empirical philosophical
works that (subversively) advocate against authoritarianism.

That's very interesting. Corinthians isn't my strong suit. But it's also
interesting that St. Paul says *by the grace of God* I am that I am. It is
as if God has poured his spirit into him, allowing Paul to quote him as he
has in a sense imported God's essence. In any case it's very different from
both the mood of Oxford's letter, and the similar mood in the sonnet when
the words are used.

I believe from the context that Oxford was referring to himself, as was
Shakespeare. Both of them were of course echoing the words in the
scriptures.

I'm not sure, but I seem to remember that Lyly was quoting God. I'm sure
you'll put me right if I'm wrong. What about Melbancke?

Robinson Crusoe - Further Adventures - Daniel Defoe

&lt;&lt;However, at last, nothing else offering, and as sitting still, to me
especially, was the unhappiest part of life, I resolved on this voyage
too, which we made very successfully, touching at BORNEO and several
other islands, and came home in about five months, when we sold our
spices, with very great profit, to the Persian merchants,
who carried them away to the Gulf.&gt;&gt;

Poe, Edgar Allan - THE HAUNTED PALACE

&lt;&lt;When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood as
far apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make
all things appear natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in
two diameters, at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion
adopted, at the present day, by those who capture Chimpanzees,
or other large apes, in BORNEO.&gt;&gt;

Poe, Edgar Allan - THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE

&lt;&lt;What he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a voyage
to the Indian Archipelago. A party, of which he formed one, landed
at BORNEO, and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure.
Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang-Outang.&gt;&gt;

_Cargo Cult Science_ by Richard Feynman
From a Caltech commencement address given in 1974

&lt;&lt; In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people.
During the war they saw airplanes with lots of good materials,
and they want the same thing to happen now. So they've arranged
to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to
make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head
to headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's the
controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing
everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked
before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo
cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of
scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential,
because the planes don't land.&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;For Feynman, a cargo-cult science is one that has all the trappings of
science-the illusion of objectivity, the appearance of careful study, and
the motions of an experiment-but lacks one important ingredient: skepticism,
or a leaning over backward to see if one might be mistaken. The essence
of science is to doubt your own interpretations and theories
so that you may improve upon them.&gt;&gt; -- Anthony R. Pratkanis

The English &quot;The Hystorie of HAMBLET&quot; was adapted from
the &quot;AM-LETH&quot; story of Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus.
----------------------------------------------------------
&quot;MA-LETH&quot; (a haven)
----------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;At one time or other the traders of yesteryear- the Pheonicians and
the Carthagenians, the Romans and the Saracens, the Normans, the Normans
and the Aragonese, the hospitalier Knights, Napoleon and Nelson- have
used Malta's Harbours. It was the Pheonicians who gave the island the
name MALETH (a haven), which was later corrupted by the Greeks
into MELITA (honey), from which the modern name of Malta derives.

When Emperor Charles V offered Malta to the Knights of St. John in
1526, the island came into the limelight as a possible place where the
Knights could re- establish themselves permanently after the loss of
Rhodes, the island of Roses, in 1522. An eight-man commission
was dispatched to Malta to report on the nature of the island. The
commissioners reported : &quot;The island of Malta is only one continued
rock of soft sand stone.the surface of the rock is stony, unfit to
produce corn.except for a few springs in the middle of the island, there
is no running water. wood is scarce. but. there are several ports or
capes and places that form a sort of bays and coves in which ships may
anchor; there are two spacious and very good harbours in the island ,
capable of receiving the largest fleet. The convenience of so many
ports, so convenient for the armada of the Order, make us be of the
opinion that the Emperors proposals ought not to be rejected.&quot;

At the time, the order`s fleet was based in the Roman port of
Cittavecchia. In October 1530 the Knights entered Maltas main harbour on
board the great carrack Santa Anna- the first ever ARMOUR-plated vessel
under the command of Sir William Weston, who had commanded the
Santa Maria as the Order pulled out of Rhodes eight years before.

A landmark on the Grand Harbour basin is the vedette
on Senglea Point bearing the figures of AN EAR &amp; AN EYE -
symbols of the hearkening ear and the watchful oculus.

During his second visit to Malta in 1811
Lord Byron carved his name among the graffiti on one of the
terraces of Lazzaretto. A landmark on Valletta itself, as seen
from Marsamxett Harbour side, is St. Pauls`s Anglican
Cathedral with its smart, elegant behind the bastions.&gt;&gt;

King Henry V Act 1, Scene 2

CANTERBURY Therefore doth heaven divide

Setting endeavour in continual motion;
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
Obedience: for so work the HONEY-BEEs,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
They have a king and officers of sorts;
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
To the tent-royal of their emperor;
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
The singing *MASONS* BUILDING ROOFS of gold,
The civil citizens kneading up the HONEY,
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
DeliVERing o'er to EXECUTORS pale
The lazy yawning drone.

Sucks up the sweet of HONEY from the *BEE* .
Who worketh most, to their share least doth fall;
With due desert reward will never be.

First, I think you mean VERse 10, Art. Second, since God in EXOdus
and Paul in Corinthians used different tongues, neither of which was
English (although this may well be news to you, Art), I cannot see any
real substance in your rejoinder. In fact, many English translations
don't use either wording. For example,

&quot;10 But because God was so gracious, so VERy generous, here I am.
And I'm not about to let his grace go to WASTE. Haven't I worked
hard trying to do more than any of the others? Even then, my work
didn't amount to all that much. It was God giving me the work to
do, God giving me the energy to do it.&quot;

Or,

&quot;10 But whateVER I am now, it is all because God poured out his
special favor on me--and not without results. For I have worked
harder than all the other apostles, yet it was not I but God who
was working through me by his grace.&quot;

Or,

&quot;10 I am different now. It is all because of what God did for me by
His loving I CORINTHIANS 14, 15 I CORINTHIANS 15 favor. His loving
was not WASTEd. I worked harder than all the other missionaries. But
it was not I who worked. It was God's loving working through me.&quot;

Or,

&quot;10 But God was kind! He made me what I am, and his wonderful
kindness wasn't WASTEd. I worked much harder than any of the other
apostles, although it was really God's kindness at work and not me.&quot;

Or,

&quot;10    But God has been kind to me. He has made me what I am today.
And he did not bless me for nothing. I did more work than any of
them. Yet it was not I, but the loving kindness of God was working
with me.&quot;

Or,

&quot;10 But by the grace of God I am that thing that I am; and his grace
was not void in me [and his grace was not void, or idle, in me].
For I travailed more plenteously than all they [But I travailed more
plenteously than all they]; but not I, but the grace of God with me.&quot;

See
&lt;&gt;.

Popeye, Al Gore, and Lynne are all closer to Oxford's wording than any
of the above.

For that matter, God appears to express himself in English in rather
a variety of ways in Exodus 3:14 (note that those are the first three
decimal digits of pi, Art -- I'm sure you can find some nutcase
numerological significance therein) as well. In fact, God appears
strongly to prefer the wording &quot;I am who I am&quot; to &quot;I am that I am.&quot; For
example,

&quot;14 God said to Moses, 'I-AM-WHO-I-AM. Tell the People of Israel,
&quot;I-AM sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

Or,

&quot;14    God said to Moses, '[1](22 )I AM WHO I AM'; and He said, 'Thus
you shall say to the sons of Israel, &quot;I AM has sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

Or,

&quot;14 God said to Moses, 'I-AM-WHO-I-AM. Tell the People of Israel,
&quot;I-AM sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

Or,

&quot;14 And God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM and WHAT I AM, and I WILL BE
WHAT I WILL BE; and He said, You shall say this to the Israelites:
I AM has sent me to you!&quot;

Note that here God can't seem to decide between &quot;what&quot; or &quot;who&quot; and
settles for both, but he rejects &quot;that.&quot;

Or,

&quot;14 God replied, 'I AM THE ONE WHO ALWAYS IS. [3]Just tell them,
&quot;I AM has sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

Or,

&quot;14 And God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM.' And He said, 'Say to the
Israelites, &quot;I AM has sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

Or,

&quot;14-15 God said to Moses: 'I am the eternal God. So tell them that
the LORD, [3]whose name is &quot;I Am,&quot; has sent you. This is my name
forever, and it is the name that people must use from now on.'&quot;

Or,

&quot;14 And God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM.' And He said, 'Thus you
shall say to the children of Israel, &quot;I AM has sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

Or,

&quot;14    And God saith unto Moses, `I AM THAT WHICH I AM;' He saith
also, `Thus dost thou say to the sons of Israel, I AM hath sent me
unto you.'&quot;

Or,

&quot;14 God said to Moses, 'I am who I am. Here is what you must say to
the Israelites. Tell them, &quot;I am has sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

Or,

&quot;14 God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to
the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'&quot;

Out of eighteen VERsions, I count only three or four (the KJV and its
lineal descendants) in which the text reads &quot;I am that I am.&quot; OVERall,
God appears to display a significant preference (by a ratio of two to
one, in fact) for &quot;I am who I am&quot; -- *exactly* the wording employed by
Al Gore.

Of course, God's use of the name &quot;I-AM&quot; makes one wonder how Sam-I-am
fits into all this. Of course, no doubt the momentous significance of
&quot;GREENE eggs and HAMlet&quot; is not lost upon you, Art. And I've already
pointed out to you that another of Dr. Seuss's book titles, _The Lorax_,
is an anagram of

Ox, th'Earl.

He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

&gt;&amp;language=english&amp;version=MSG&amp;x=15&amp;y=7&gt;.

&gt; Popeye, Al Gore, and Lynne are all closer to Oxford's wording than any
&gt; of the above.

&gt; For that matter, God appears to express himself in English in rather
&gt; a variety of ways in Exodus 3:14 (note that those are the first three
&gt; decimal digits of pi, Art -- I'm sure you can find some nutcase
&gt; numerological significance therein) as well. In fact, God appears
&gt; strongly to prefer the wording &quot;I am who I am&quot; to &quot;I am that I am.&quot; For
&gt; example,

&gt;&quot;14 God said to Moses, 'I-AM-WHO-I-AM. Tell the People of Israel,
&gt;&quot;I-AM sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

&gt; Or,

&gt;&quot;14 God said to Moses, '[1](22 )I AM WHO I AM'; and He said, 'Thus
&gt; you shall say to the sons of Israel, &quot;I AM has sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

&gt; Or,

&gt;&quot;14 God said to Moses, 'I-AM-WHO-I-AM. Tell the People of Israel,
&gt;&quot;I-AM sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

&gt; Or,

&gt;&quot;14 And God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM and WHAT I AM, and I WILL BE
&gt; WHAT I WILL BE; and He said, You shall say this to the Israelites:
&gt; I AM has sent me to you!&quot;

&gt; Note that here God can't seem to decide between &quot;what&quot; or &quot;who&quot; and
&gt; settles for both, but he rejects &quot;that.&quot;

&gt; Or,

&gt;&quot;14 God replied, 'I AM THE ONE WHO ALWAYS IS. [3]Just tell them,
&gt;&quot;I AM has sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

&gt; Or,

&gt;&quot;14 And God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM.' And He said, 'Say to the
&gt; Israelites, &quot;I AM has sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

&gt; Or,

&gt;&quot;14-15 God said to Moses: 'I am the eternal God. So tell them that
&gt; the LORD, [3]whose name is &quot;I Am,&quot; has sent you. This is my name
&gt; forever, and it is the name that people must use from now on.'&quot;

&gt; Or,

&gt;&quot;14 And God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM.' And He said, 'Thus you
&gt; shall say to the children of Israel, &quot;I AM has sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

&gt; Or,

&gt;&quot;14 And God saith unto Moses, `I AM THAT WHICH I AM;' He saith
&gt; also, `Thus dost thou say to the sons of Israel, I AM hath sent me
&gt; unto you.'&quot;

&gt; Or,

&gt;&quot;14 God said to Moses, 'I am who I am. Here is what you must say to
&gt; the Israelites. Tell them, &quot;I am has sent me to you.&quot;'&quot;

&gt; Or,

&gt;&quot;14 God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to
&gt; the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'&quot;

&gt; Out of eighteen VERsions, I count only three or four (the KJV and its
&gt; lineal descendants) in which the text reads &quot;I am that I am.&quot; OVERall,
&gt; God appears to display a significant preference (by a ratio of two to
&gt; one, in fact) for &quot;I am who I am&quot; -- *exactly* the wording employed by
&gt; Al Gore.

&gt; Of course, God's use of the name &quot;I-AM&quot; makes one wonder how Sam-I-am
&gt; fits into all this. Of course, no doubt the momentous significance of
&gt;&quot;GREENE eggs and HAMlet&quot; is not lost upon you, Art. And I've already
&gt; pointed out to you that another of Dr. Seuss's book titles, _The Lorax_,
&gt; is an anagram of

&gt; Ox, th'Earl.

&gt; He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

----------------------------------------------------------
Davidic Lorax
----------------------------------------------------------
Druidic Lore

&lt;&lt;Let us commence in the words
of the immortal Taliesin in his poem:

Buarth Beirdd, 'The OX-Pen of the Bards'.

Gliding with rapidity were my thoughts,
Over the vain poetic art of the Bards of Britain,
Who labouring to make an excessive shew at the solemn meeting,
With sufficient care hammer out a song.

[I] require A STAFF, at unity with the Bardic lore.

[A]s for him who knows not the OX-pen of the Bards,
[M]ay fifteen thousand overpower and afflict him at once!

[I AM] a skilful composer: I am a clear singer:
[I AM] a tower: I am a Druid:
[I AM] an architect: I am a prophet:
[I AM] a serpent: I am love:
In the social banquet will I indulge.

A Bard am I, not doting upon superfluous trifles.
When a master sings his song will be close to the subject.
He will not be searching for those remote wonders.
Shall I then admit these, like men suing for garments,
Without a hand to receive them -

Like men toiling in the lake, without a ship!
Then let the giver of the mead feast cause to be proclaimed.

'[I AM] the CELL;
[I AM] the opening chasm;
[I AM] the bull Beer Lled;
[I AM] the repository of the mystery;
[I AM] the place of reanimation.

I love the tops of trees, with the points well connected,
And the Bard who composes without meriting a repulse;
But him I love not, who delights in contention.
He who traduces the adept shall not enjoy the mead.
It is time to hasten to the banquet
Where the skilful ones are employed in their mysteries,
With the HUNDRED KNOTS - the custom of our countrymen.'

The shepherds of the plains, the supporters of gates,
Are like persons marching to battle without their clan.

[I AM] the Bard of the hall;
[I AM] the stock that supports the chair:

I shall succeed in impeding the progress of the loquacious Bards.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's very interesting. Corinthians isn't my strong suit. But it's
also
&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting that St. Paul says *by the grace of God* I am that I am.
It is
&gt;&gt;&gt; as if God has poured his spirit into him, allowing Paul to quote him
as he
&gt;&gt;&gt; has in a sense imported God's essence. In any case it's very different
&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt; both the mood of Oxford's letter, and the similar mood in the sonnet
&gt;&gt;&gt; when the words are used.

In the Geneva, Exodus 3.14, which is what we were first discussing (or at

scholars believe that the Geneva was the Bible with which Shakespeare was
most familiar. It's no use looking at the KJV for wording because it came
out first in 1611, two years after the sonnets were published and long after
Oxford wrote his letter. Both Shakespeare and Oxford were clearly harkening
back to that verse as it appeared in the Geneva and/or other early versions
such as the Bishops' Bible.

&gt;&gt; Lucretius was an empiricist? An odd concept of empiricism.
&gt; I searched Lucretius + empiricism and found this:

&gt; protection
&gt; against authoritarianism.

&gt;&lt;http://humanists.net/pdhutcheon/humanist%20articles/lucritus.htm&gt;

&gt; Strats, blinded as they are by the influential notion that 'Shakespeare
&gt; wrote only for money,' can't see that the works are empirical philosophical
&gt; works that (subversively) advocate against authoritarianism.
&gt;&gt; And I'd be
&gt;&gt; interested in hearing about Shakespearean passages that were palpably
&gt;&gt; influenced by De Rerum Natura.
&gt; I can probably find some.

Elizabeth appears to be getting distracted by a side issue -- not
that she won't make a fool of herself most amusingly there as well.
However, she has been strangely mute concerning the subject line of this
thread. Earlier, Elizabeth opined, supposedly paraphrasing Yamada, that
republics soon form wherever Shakespeare's works are translated:

&quot;As Yamada stated, where the Shakespeare plays are translated,
republics soon follow.&quot;

and

&quot;...the record of the conduct of the Stratford Menace in his home
shire proves that there is no way in hell, Grumman, that sucn an
Immoral Beast could have written the Shakespeare works which, as
Yamada stated, form republics where they are translated.&quot;

Of course, there is no telling whether Elizabeth's paraphrase is even
remotely close to what Yamada wrote (we have seen samples of Elizabeth's
farcically inaccurate paraphrases and even her supposed &quot;quotations&quot; of
Kathman, Hsu, Dogariu, Kuzmich, and Wang, Rips, and others, which
certainly raise grave doubts), but whether or not Yamada actually said
anything of the kind, this belief of Elizabeth's appears quite curious.

To jog Elizabeth's memory (such as it is), Spanish translations of
Shakespeare have long been in existence (Macpherson's appeared in the
1800s), yet it took quite a while for Spain to rid itself of the
monarchy -- but perhaps Elizabeth sees Franco's fascist Spain as a
shining instance of the indomitable triumph of republicanism, directly
precipitated by translations of the Shakespeare canon a century earlier.
Nor did the ruthless and murderous Argentine military dictatorship of
the 1980s bear much resemblance to a republic.

Elizabeth must also be blithely unaware of the existence of Russian
translations of Shakespeare, with _Hamlet_ appearing in the mid-1700s,
several more plays during the reign of Catherine the Great, and the
complete works (in a good translation in which Nekrasov had a hand)
appearing by 1870. Indeed, _Hamlet_ was so influential as to become a
Russian obsession, a work that many Russians regard as an integral part
of their culture, a quintessentially Russian work that just happened to
have been written by an Englishman. Yet it appears to have taken the
Russians well over a century to found anything much resembling a
republic -- and even then the outcome appears to owe far more to
Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and others than to Shakespeare. Elizabeth
evidently has a very eccentric understanding of the meaning of the word
&quot;soon&quot; in the political sphere.

For that matter, the superb German translation of Schlegel was
complete by the mid-1800s, yet Germany's republican form of government
has not always been in evidence for certain memorable parts of the
twentieth century. But history is not Elizabeth's strong suit either.

Where *does* Elizabeth get this stuff?!

Strats refuse to acknowledge that Lucretius is a main source for
the Shakespare plays--Bullough doesn't list Lucretius, he's not on the
University of Basel site that is otherwise so thorough about
listing sources--not on Perseus' Shakespeare source list--but
individual Shakespearean scholars find a significant amount of
Lucretius in the plays.

As it turns out Lucretius is a real problem for Strats because he
appears on the list of Romans not read in grammar schools.
Strat scholars state that 'Shakespeare picked up Lucretius from
Montaigne' but Florio didn't translate Montaigne into English until
1603 after the plays in which De Rerum Natura appears were
written.

And then there's Bacon who was hugely influenced by Lucretius.
Bacon's brother Anthony lived in Bordeaux for two years with
Montaigne and of course John Florio grew up in Lord Burghley's
house and Bacon and Florio lived together for nearly three years
in the Paris Embassy with the most Lucretian of all Renaissance
thinkers--Giodorno Bruno.

So, as usual we have 'multiple ties' between Francis Bacon--
who read Latin like a Roman and had easy access to De Rerum
Natura from childhood, who was a lifelong friend of Montaigne's
translator Johns Florio, whose brother Anthony lived with Montaigne
(Dame Daphne Du Maurier's biography of Anthony Bacon) and
who spent more than three years--counting Bruno's stay at Wilton
with Bacon's Sidney cousins--being influenced by the most profoundly
Lucretian thinker Bruno.

I'll post on the influence of Lucretius in specific plays in
subsequent
posts.

Best regards,

Elizabeth

&gt;&gt; Elizabeth appears to be getting distracted by a side issue -- not
&gt;&gt; that she won't make a fool of herself most amusingly there as well.
&gt; Lucretius, as it turns out, exposes a coverup of sorts in Stratfordian

"/>

This is only a &quot;problem&quot; if one assumes, as Elizabeth apparently
does, that Shakespeare could never have read any book other than those
read in the grammar school curriculum. It seems likely that Elizabeth
is merely extrapolating from her own experience.

But Elizabeth is *still* getting distracted by a side issue. To
remind her of the thread's subject line, Elizabeth earlier opined,
supposedly paraphrasing Yamada, that republics soon form wherever
Shakespeare's works are translated:

&quot;As Yamada stated, where the Shakespeare plays are translated,
republics soon follow.&quot;

Of course, there is no telling whether Elizabeth's paraphrase is even
remotely close to what Yamada wrote (we have seen numerous samples of
Elizabeth's farcically inaccurate paraphrases and even her supposed
&quot;quotations&quot; of Kathman, Hsu, Dogariu, Kuzmich, and Wang, Rips, and
others, which certainly raise grave doubts), but whether or not Yamada
actually said anything of the kind, this belief of Elizabeth's appears
quite curious.

To jog Elizabeth's memory (such as it is), Spanish translations of
Shakespeare have long been in existence (Macpherson's appeared in the
1800s), yet it took quite a while for Spain to rid itself of the
monarchy -- but perhaps Elizabeth sees Franco's fascist Spain as a
shining instance of the indomitable triumph of republicanism, directly
precipitated by translations of the Shakespeare canon a century earlier.
Nor did the ruthless and murderous Argentine military dictatorship of
the 1980s bear much resemblance to a republic.

Elizabeth must also be blithely unaware of the existence of Russian
translations of Shakespeare, with _Hamlet_ appearing in the mid-1700s,
several more plays during the reign of Catherine the Great, and the
complete works (in a good translation in which Nekrasov had a hand)
appearing by 1870. Indeed, _Hamlet_ was so influential as to become a
Russian obsession, a work that many Russians regard as an integral part
of their culture, a quintessentially Russian work that just happened to
have been written by an Englishman. Yet it appears to have taken the
Russians well over a century to found anything much resembling a
republic -- and even then the outcome appears to owe far more to
Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and others than to Shakespeare. Elizabeth
evidently has a very eccentric understanding of the meaning of the word
&quot;soon&quot; in the political sphere.

For that matter, the superb German translation of Schlegel was
complete by the mid-1800s, yet Germany's republican form of government
has not always been in evidence for certain memorable parts of the
twentieth century. But history is not Elizabeth's strong suit either.

Where *does* Elizabeth get this stuff?!

Are the &quot;individual Shakespearean scholars [who] find a significant
amount of Lucretius in the plays&quot; themselves Stratfordians? If so,
isn't that fact inconsistent with your allegation of a Stratfordian
cover-up of this supposedly devastating fact?

I suspect that your &quot;research&quot; consists of googling

You simply don't grasp Miss Weir's theory in its fullness. Republics
didn't &quot;soon follow&quot; translations of Shakespeare into Spanish, Russian
and German, because the unenlightened translators were Stratfordians
and therefore authoritarians. Wherever Shakespeare has been translated
by people who realized that his works were written by the Renaissance
Genius Francis Bacon, republics have followed instantly. I defy you to
present a single counter-example!

&gt;&quot;As Yamada stated, where the Shakespeare plays are translated,

&gt; Of course, there is no telling whether Elizabeth's paraphrase is even
&gt; remotely close to what Yamada wrote (we have seen numerous samples of
&gt; Elizabeth's farcically inaccurate paraphrases and even her supposed
&gt;&quot;quotations&quot; of Kathman, Hsu, Dogariu, Kuzmich, and Wang, Rips, and
&gt; others, which certainly raise grave doubts), but whether or not Yamada
&gt; actually said anything of the kind, this belief of Elizabeth's appears
&gt; quite curious.

It would be shocking -- and unprecedented -- if Elizabeth's

to invention and/or hallucination -- her &quot;quotation&quot; of Dave Kathman's
(nonexistent) remarks on Richard Field's delivery of the Strachey letter
furnishes one amusing instance, and her recent hallucination concerning
the intimate details of Southampton's tonsorial and sartorial

&gt;&gt;&lt;snip of Webb's unread obsessive repetitions&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabeth appears to be getting distracted by a side issue -- not
&gt;&gt;&gt; that she won't make a fool of herself most amusingly there as well.

&gt;&gt; Lucretius, as it turns out, exposes a coverup of sorts in Stratfordian
&gt;&gt; what-passes-for-scholarship.

&gt;&gt; Strats refuse to acknowledge that Lucretius is a main source for
&gt;&gt; the Shakespare plays--Bullough doesn't list Lucretius, he's not on the
&gt;&gt; University of Basel site that is otherwise so thorough about
&gt;&gt; listing sources--not on Perseus' Shakespeare source list--but
&gt;&gt; individual Shakespearean scholars find a significant amount of
&gt;&gt; Lucretius in the plays.

&gt;&gt; As it turns out Lucretius is a real problem for Strats because he
&gt;&gt; appears on the list of Romans not read in grammar schools.

&gt; This is only a &quot;problem&quot; if one assumes, as Elizabeth apparently
&gt; does, that Shakespeare could never have read any book other than those
&gt; read in the grammar school curriculum. It seems likely that Elizabeth
&gt; is merely extrapolating from her own experience.

&gt; But Elizabeth is *still* getting distracted by a side issue. To
&gt; remind her of the thread's subject line, Elizabeth earlier opined,
&gt; supposedly paraphrasing Yamada, that republics soon form wherever
&gt; Shakespeare's works are translated:

&gt;&quot;As Yamada stated, where the Shakespeare plays are translated,
&gt; republics soon follow.&quot;

&gt; Of course, there is no telling whether Elizabeth's paraphrase is even
&gt; remotely close to what Yamada wrote (we have seen numerous samples of
&gt; Elizabeth's farcically inaccurate paraphrases and even her supposed
&gt;&quot;quotations&quot; of Kathman, Hsu, Dogariu, Kuzmich, and Wang, Rips, and
&gt; others, which certainly raise grave doubts), but whether or not Yamada
&gt; actually said anything of the kind, this belief of Elizabeth's appears
&gt; quite curious.

&gt; To jog Elizabeth's memory (such as it is), Spanish translations of
&gt; Shakespeare have long been in existence (Macpherson's appeared in the
&gt; 1800s), yet it took quite a while for Spain to rid itself of the
&gt; monarchy --

"/>

I just wanted to revisit this post.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but perhaps Elizabeth sees Franco's fascist Spain as a
&gt; shining instance of the indomitable triumph of republicanism, directly
&gt; precipitated by translations of the Shakespeare canon a century earlier.
&gt; Nor did the ruthless and murderous Argentine military dictatorship of
&gt; the 1980s bear much resemblance to a republic.

&gt; Elizabeth must also be blithely unaware of the existence of Russian
&gt; translations of Shakespeare, with _Hamlet_ appearing in the mid-1700s,
&gt; several more plays during the reign of Catherine the Great, and the
&gt; complete works (in a good translation in which Nekrasov had a hand)
&gt; appearing by 1870. Indeed, _Hamlet_ was so influential as to become a
&gt; Russian obsession, a work that many Russians regard as an integral part
&gt; of their culture, a quintessentially Russian work that just happened to
&gt; have been written by an Englishman. Yet it appears to have taken the
&gt; Russians well over a century to found anything much resembling a
&gt; republic -- and even then the outcome appears to owe far more to
&gt; Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and others than to Shakespeare. Elizabeth
&gt; evidently has a very eccentric understanding of the meaning of the word
&gt;&quot;soon&quot; in the political sphere.

&gt; For that matter, the superb German translation of Schlegel was
&gt; complete by the mid-1800s, yet Germany's republican form of government
&gt; has not always been in evidence for certain memorable parts of the
&gt; twentieth century. But history is not Elizabeth's strong suit either.

&gt; Where *does* Elizabeth get this stuff?!

&gt;&gt; Quoth Lynne:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford also says in a letter, &quot;I am that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am.&quot; Shakespeare says it in the sonnets.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I've already noted that Popeye also says it, as does Al Gore.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You've even said it yourself, Lynne:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ing.google.com&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;output=gplain&gt;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We are all somewhat later. We were also copying God or Oxford.

&gt;&gt; Or St. Paul:

&gt;&gt;&quot;But by the grace of God, I am that I am: and his grace which is in me,
&gt;&gt; was not in vaine: but I laboured more aboundantly then they all: yet not
&gt;&gt; I, but the grace of God which is with me.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:10).

&gt; That's very interesting. Corinthians isn't my strong suit. But it's also
&gt; interesting that St. Paul says *by the grace of God* I am that I am. It
&gt; is as if God has poured his spirit into him, allowing Paul to quote him
&gt; as he has in a sense imported God's essence. In any case it's very
&gt; different from both the mood of Oxford's letter, and the similar mood in
&gt; the sonnet when the words are used.

"/>

Here is the Exodus instance: &quot;And God answered Moses, I Am That I Am.
Also he said, Thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israel, I Am hath
sent me vnto you.&quot;

Here is a bit more context from St. Paul:

&quot;9. For I am the least of the Apostles, which am not meete to be called an
Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.

10. But by the grace of God, I am that I am: and his grace which is in me,
was not in vaine: but I laboured more aboundantly then they all: yet not
I, but the grace of God which is with me.&quot;

We need not believe that Paul's &quot;I am that I am&quot; is a deliberate echo of
God's line in Exodus -- in other translations Paul's words differ from
God's. Shakespeare (and Oxford, for that matter) may be echoing Paul OR
God OR Lyly OR Melbancke or some combination of sources.

Here is part of Oxford's letter of 30 October 1584:

&quot;My lord, this other day yowre man stainner towld me that yow sent for
Amis my man, and yf he wear absent that Lylle showld come vnto yow. I sent
Amis for he was in ye way. And I thinke very strange yat yowre Lordship
showld enter into that course towards me, wherby I must lerne yat I knev
[=knew] not before, bothe of yowre opinion and good will towards me. but I
pray, my lord, leaue yat course, for I mean not to be yowre ward nor yowre
chyld, I serve her magestie, and I am that I am, and by allyance neare to
yowre lordship, but fre, and scorne to be offred that iniurie, to thinke I
am so weake of gouernment as to be ruled by servants, or not able to
gouerne my self.&quot;

This is not at all like God's saying that his name is &quot;I am,&quot; but Oxford
may be suggesting that Burghley has been acting more godlike than is meet.
God says Moses should tell the Israelites, &quot;I Am hath sent me vnto you.&quot;
God, therefore, is the one who &quot;sends ... unto.&quot; Oxford complains about
Burghley's acting gas the one who &quot;sends ... unto&quot;: &quot;stainner towld me that
yow sent for Amis my man, and yf he wear absent that Lylle showld come
vnto yow.&quot; Thus perhaps Oxford is saying that with respect to his
servants, he (and not Burghley) should be their god.

On the other hand, we may consider Oxford's use closer to Paul's use if we
take Elizabeth's power as enabling Oxford to be what he is, as God's grace
allows Paul to be what HE is.

Here is Shakespeare's Sonnet 121:

TIS better to be vile then vile esteemed,
When not to be,receiues reproach of being,
And the iust pleasure lost,which is so deemed,
Not by our feeling,but by others seeing.
For why should others false adulterat eyes
Giue saluation to my sportiue blood?
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies;
Which in their wils count bad what I think good?
Noe,I am that I am,and they that leuell
At my abuses,reckon vp their owne,
I may be straight though they them-selues be beuel
By their rancke thoughtes,my deedes must not be shown
Vnlesse this general euill they maintaine,
All men are bad and in their badnesse raigne.

This sonnet could almost have been written in response to Paul. Paul
would certainly deny that it is &quot;better to be vile then vile esteemed&quot; --
he WAS vile when he persecuted Christ's followers, and now, if he is not
so vile, the change is not doing but God's. As for esteem, Paul says, he
is &quot;the least of the Apostles, which am not meete to be called an
Apostle.&quot;

I would not deny the Exodus echo in any of the later texts (it is more
explicit in Lyly and Melbancke, yet one cannot but hear it in Oxford and
Shakespeare), but we should not bury Paul.

Melbanke, byt the way, does a nice transformation of the Exodus phrase
that might have appealed particularly to someone with Shakespeare's first
name:

&quot;Shall the pot aske the potter why he fashioneth it so, or the anuile the
smith why he striketh it with the hammer, or thou search a reason of Gods
seuere punishmente, whose name is in Scripture I am that I am (so
incomprehensible is his maiestie) who renders his reason I will that I
will (so vncapable is his wisdome?)&quot;

The next lines add a Pauline flavor:

&quot;If any man haue tasted some extraordinary mercies, it was his free will,
not their deserte: if either the gentleman of whome the history mentions,
or thou Periander haue felt his heauie hande, it is your merite, not his
desire. I reprehend not thy presumption, but reproue thy despayre: for
prosperitie puffeth vp with contempt of God his bounty, and aduersity
pulleth downe to distrust his fauour, Therefore Periander.&quot;

Only the good, and not the vile, are God's handiwork. The virtuous may
say &quot;i am that I am by the grace of God&quot;; the vile &quot;I am that I am by my
evil.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Or Lyly, or Melbancke. Perhaps Oxford himself was echoing the scriptures
&gt;&gt; AND Lyly, since he refers to Lyly in the letter where he uses the words.

&gt; I believe from the context that Oxford was referring to himself, as was
&gt; Shakespeare. Both of them were of course echoing the words in the
&gt; scriptures.

"/>

All four of our Elizabethans were echoing the words in the scriptures.
None of them was saying of himself, &quot;my name is 'I am.'&quot; A reasonable
case can be made for a Pauline influence in all of the texts, but there is
no reason to think Shakespeare, who would have known Exodus and 1
Corinthians, and who (like Oxford) could have read Lyly and Melbancke,
must have been familiar with Oxford's letter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I'm not sure, but I seem to remember that Lyly was quoting God. I'm sure
&gt; you'll put me right if I'm wrong. What about Melbancke?

"/>

See above for Melbancke (of course the Euphuism in Melbancke is strong; he
would have known Exodus, 1 Corinthians, AND Lyly). As for Lyly, please
allow me to repost some of what I have said before:

The section &quot;Euphues and Atheos&quot; (which is completely different in tone
from the rest of the work) contains the words &quot;I am that I am.&quot; Let me
break down and quote a few paragraphs from the 1578 edition of *Euphues*:

&quot;But why go I about in a thing so manifest to use proofs so manifold? If
thou deny the truth who can prove it; if thou deny that black is black,
who can by reason reprove thee when thou opposest thyself against reason?
Thou knowest that manifest truths are not to be proved but believed, and
that he that denieth the principal of any art is not to be confuted by
arguments, but left to his own folly.

&quot;But I have a better opinion of thee, and therefore I mean not to trifle
with philosophy but to try this by the touchstone of the scriptures. We
read in the second of Exodus that when Moses desired of God to know what
he should name Him to the children of Israel He answered, [`]Thou shalt
say, I am that I am. Again, He that is hath sent me unto you. The Lord,
even your God, He is God in the heaven above and in the earth beneath. I
am the first and the last I am. I am the Lord and there is none other.
I have created the light and made darkness, making peace and framing
evil[']. If thou desire to hear what God is, thou shalt hear He is even a
consuming fire, the Lord of revenge, the God of judgment, the living God,
the searcher of the reins, He that made all things of nothing, Alpha and
Omega, the Beginning and yet without beginning, the end and yet
everlasting. One at whose breath the mountains shake, whose seat is the
lofty cherubim, whose footstool is the earth, invisible yet seeing all
things, a jealous God, a loving God, miraculous in all points, in no part
monstrous.&quot;

The passage that Euphues claims he found in book 2 of Exodus contains
nothing from that book, but instead quotes Exodus 3, Deuteronomy 4, Isaiah
34, and Isaiah 35; then Euphues takes off in a mock-biblical riff of his
own. In the 1581 (and later editions), after &quot;I am that I am&quot; are added 6
more words: &quot;Again, I am that I am.&quot; It seems to me that Euphues in his
dialogue with Atheos pretends at first merely to be quoting scripture, but
is actually rewriting scripture and perhaps even replacing it, just as the
repetition of &quot;I am that I am&quot; suggests that he may wish to to convert
Atheos to the worship not so much of the Christian God as of Euphues
himself. At the end of this section the godlike Euphues changes his
fellow's name from Atheos (&quot;godless&quot;) to Theophilus (&quot;god-loving).

&gt; smith why he striketh it with the hammer, or thou search a reason of Gods
&gt; seuere punishmente, whose name is in Scripture I am that I am (so
&gt; incomprehensible is his maiestie) who renders his reason I will that I
&gt; will (so vncapable is his wisdome?)&quot;

&gt; The next lines add a Pauline flavor:

&gt;&quot;If any man haue tasted some extraordinary mercies, it was his free will,
&gt; not their deserte: if either the gentleman of whome the history mentions,
&gt; or thou Periander haue felt his heauie hande, it is your merite, not his
&gt; desire. I reprehend not thy presumption, but reproue thy despayre: for
&gt; prosperitie puffeth vp with contempt of God his bounty, and aduersity
&gt; pulleth downe to distrust his fauour, Therefore Periander.&quot;

&gt; Only the good, and not the vile, are God's handiwork. The virtuous may
&gt; say &quot;i am that I am by the grace of God&quot;; the vile &quot;I am that I am by my
&gt; evil.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Or Lyly, or Melbancke. Perhaps Oxford himself was echoing the
scriptures
&gt;&gt;&gt; AND Lyly, since he refers to Lyly in the letter where he uses the
words.

&gt;&gt; I believe from the context that Oxford was referring to himself, as was
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare. Both of them were of course echoing the words in the
&gt;&gt; scriptures.

&gt; All four of our Elizabethans were echoing the words in the scriptures.
&gt; None of them was saying of himself, &quot;my name is 'I am.'&quot; A reasonable
&gt; case can be made for a Pauline influence in all of the texts, but there is
&gt; no reason to think Shakespeare, who would have known Exodus and 1
&gt; Corinthians, and who (like Oxford) could have read Lyly and Melbancke,
&gt; must have been familiar with Oxford's letter.

&gt;&gt; I'm not sure, but I seem to remember that Lyly was quoting God. I'm sure
&gt;&gt; you'll put me right if I'm wrong. What about Melbancke?

&gt; See above for Melbancke (of course the Euphuism in Melbancke is strong; he
&gt; would have known Exodus, 1 Corinthians, AND Lyly). As for Lyly, please
&gt; allow me to repost some of what I have said before:

&gt; The section &quot;Euphues and Atheos&quot; (which is completely different in tone
&gt; from the rest of the work) contains the words &quot;I am that I am.&quot; Let me
&gt; break down and quote a few paragraphs from the 1578 edition of *Euphues*:

&gt;&quot;But why go I about in a thing so manifest to use proofs so manifold? If
&gt; thou deny the truth who can prove it; if thou deny that black is black,
&gt; who can by reason reprove thee when thou opposest thyself against reason?
&gt; Thou knowest that manifest truths are not to be proved but believed, and
&gt; that he that denieth the principal of any art is not to be confuted by
&gt; arguments, but left to his own folly.

&gt;&quot;But I have a better opinion of thee, and therefore I mean not to trifle
&gt; with philosophy but to try this by the touchstone of the scriptures. We
&gt; read in the second of Exodus that when Moses desired of God to know what
&gt; he should name Him to the children of Israel He answered, [`]Thou shalt
&gt; say, I am that I am. Again, He that is hath sent me unto you. The Lord,
&gt; even your God, He is God in the heaven above and in the earth beneath. I
&gt; am the first and the last I am. I am the Lord and there is none other.
&gt; I have created the light and made darkness, making peace and framing
&gt; evil[']. If thou desire to hear what God is, thou shalt hear He is even a
&gt; consuming fire, the Lord of revenge, the God of judgment, the living God,
&gt; the searcher of the reins, He that made all things of nothing, Alpha and
&gt; Omega, the Beginning and yet without beginning, the end and yet
&gt; everlasting. One at whose breath the mountains shake, whose seat is the
&gt; lofty cherubim, whose footstool is the earth, invisible yet seeing all
&gt; things, a jealous God, a loving God, miraculous in all points, in no part
&gt; monstrous.&quot;

&gt; The passage that Euphues claims he found in book 2 of Exodus contains
&gt; nothing from that book, but instead quotes Exodus 3, Deuteronomy 4, Isaiah
&gt; 34, and Isaiah 35; then Euphues takes off in a mock-biblical riff of his
&gt; own. In the 1581 (and later editions), after &quot;I am that I am&quot; are added 6
&gt; more words: &quot;Again, I am that I am.&quot; It seems to me that Euphues in his
&gt; dialogue with Atheos pretends at first merely to be quoting scripture, but
&gt; is actually rewriting scripture and perhaps even replacing it, just as the
&gt; repetition of &quot;I am that I am&quot; suggests that he may wish to to convert
&gt; Atheos to the worship not so much of the Christian God as of Euphues
&gt; himself. At the end of this section the godlike

&gt; You're up to 45 posts containing the phrase 'overly fond of drag.'

&gt; Is it possible that you're a little obsessed with the subject?

"/>

No, I'm merely interested in ascertaining whether there is any
substance in your assertion that

&quot;Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about
the theatres hoping to play female roles. He was given a few
parts and was apparently very convincing as a girl.&quot;

In view of your conspicuous failure to furnish any credible evidence,
apparently there is no substance whatever to your claim. Evidently you
merely invented (or hallucinated) the whole thing.

What makes the whole affair so farcically funny is that you neither
acknowledge that you cannot adduce any evidence, nor do you retract your
statement. Rather, you make a complete, ridiculous ass of yourself by
inventing (or hallucinating) yet *more* hilarious crap -- about you can
tell that Southampton is wearing a wig in a portrait (a THEATRICAL wig,
no less!) because of his visible parietal bones, therefore he is also
wearing a dress, therefore he played feminine roles in the theatre,
therefore he was very convincing in those roles, a chain of inferences
so cretinous that one wonders what psychotropic substance could possibly
have induced it.

I expect that ten years from now, you'll *still* be insisting, with
the frantic desperation of the intellectually bankrupt, that Southampton
was overly fond of drag, that he used to hang about the theatres hoping
to play female roles, that he was very convincing in the feminine
theatrical roles he played, etc.; I also expect that you will still be
hopelessly unable to substantiate any of it -- because &quot;This is the
perishable internet and Wayback doesn't have a search function yet.&quot;

&gt; You simply don't grasp Miss Weir's theory in its fullness. Republics

&gt; by people who realized that his works were written by the Renaissance
&gt; Genius Francis Bacon, republics have followed instantly. I defy you to
&gt; present a single counter-example!

Of course! Why didn't I see it myself? Then it follows that
Karamzin and Nekrasov were authoritarians, as was Pasternak. Also
Schiller, Goethe, and Schlegel (doubtless Elizabeth will soberly inform
us that they were despicable German Idealists, and were therefore
sentenced at &quot;Nuremburg&quot;). And the first complete translation into
Basque did not appear until 1970, which no doubt accounts for the
nonexistence of an independent Basque republic today. It's really
amazing what one can learn from reading Elizabeth's posts!

But your brilliant insight does raise an interesting question: what
Baconians have translated Shakespeare into other tongues? Most of the
Baconians whose nonsense I have read can scarcely have done so, since
English does not appear to be a tongue in which they are even competent,
let alone fluent. Delia Bacon and Elizabeth herself are salient
examples of this regrettable tendency.

&gt;&gt; remind her of the thread's subject line, Elizabeth earlier opined,

&gt;&gt;&quot;As Yamada stated, where the Shakespeare plays are translated,
&gt;&gt; republics soon follow.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Of course, there is no telling whether Elizabeth's paraphrase is even
&gt;&gt; remotely close to what Yamada wrote (we have seen numerous samples of
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth's farcically inaccurate paraphrases and even her supposed
&gt;&gt;&quot;quotations&quot; of Kathman, Hsu, Dogariu, Kuzmich, and Wang, Rips, and
&gt;&gt; others, which certainly raise grave doubts), but whether or not Yamada
&gt;&gt; actually said anything of the kind, this belief of Elizabeth's appears

All four authors use the words &quot;I am that I am&quot; differently, and they are

Blasphemy is in the ear of the beholder. There is no blasphemy if Oxford

be blasphemous, I suppose, would be if Oxford had said &quot;MY name is &quot;I am
that I am&quot; -- but he did not say that. Unlike God, Oxford's essence is
not identical with his existence.

Oxford wanted to make it clear that while he was the queen's servant, he
was no other person's. If he had denied being the queen's servant (if he
had said &quot;I am that I am regardless of the queen&quot;) then he might be
tending toward lese-majesty -- but he said no such thing. Unlike God, who
&quot;is that he is&quot; without qualification, Oxford is very much the queen's
creature: but he does NOT consider himself Burghley's creature.

Paul &quot;is that he is&quot; by the grace of God, as is every one who is in God's
graces.

The speaker of the sonnet &quot;is that he is&quot; in a different sense from Paul
or from Oxford -- he is whatever it is that he is, but he doesn't tell us
what it is that he is (it may depend on what the meaning of &quot;is&quot; is).

He says &quot;I may be straight&quot; -- but while he appears to be in some ways
esteemed as &quot;vile&quot; it is also possible that he actually IS somewhat
&quot;vile.&quot; The speaker does not say that his is-ness is by the grace of God
(as Paul says) or of the queen (as Oxford allows) -- in fact, if he is
indeed &quot;vile,&quot; it might be a kind of blasphemy to blame God for this. As
Melbancke says, while God's graces are his gifts, his punishments are
earned -- &quot;if ... thou have felt [God's] heavy hand, it is your merit, not
His desire.&quot;

Oxford in his letter to Burghley does not acknowledge that he may be vile
or even that he may be esteemed by some to be vile. He resents Burghley's
talking to his men because Burghley's doing so does not show the kind of
respect that Oxford feels entitled to. Unlike what we see in Paul or in
Lyly or in Melbancke or in Shakespeare, morality is not an issue in
Oxford's use of &quot;I am that I am&quot;; rather we see injured pride.

Thanks for the full and prompt reply, Terry. It would seem that when
Shakespeare wrote. &quot;I am that I am,&quot; he was just in his Popeye mood, as I always
assumed, and used a locution probably a lot of people used at the time although
it has seldom been tagged by scholars in published works of the time.

I rather doubt Lynne will ever agree. Shakespeare's &quot;I am that I am&quot; is one of
the two main reasons she believes Oxford was Shakespeare, according to my
reading of some things she's written.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;is that he is&quot; without qualification, Oxford is very much the queen's
&gt;&gt;&gt;creature: but he does NOT consider himself Burghley's creature.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Paul &quot;is that he is&quot; by the grace of God, as is every one who is in God's
&gt;&gt;&gt;graces.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The speaker of the sonnet &quot;is that he is&quot; in a different sense from Paul
&gt;&gt;&gt;or from Oxford -- he is whatever it is that he is, but he doesn't tell us
&gt;&gt;&gt;what it is that he is (it may depend on what the meaning of &quot;is&quot; is).

&gt;&gt;&gt;He says &quot;I may be straight&quot; -- but while he appears to be in some ways
&gt;&gt;&gt;esteemed as &quot;vile&quot; it is also possible that he actually IS somewhat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;vile.&quot; The speaker does not say that his is-ness is by the grace of God
&gt;&gt;&gt;(as Paul says) or of the queen (as Oxford allows) -- in fact, if he is
&gt;&gt;&gt;indeed &quot;vile,&quot; it might be a kind of blasphemy to blame God for this. As
&gt;&gt;&gt;Melbancke says, while God's graces are his gifts, his punishments are
&gt;&gt;&gt;earned -- &quot;if ... thou have felt [God's] heavy hand, it is your merit, not
&gt;&gt;&gt;His desire.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Oxford in his letter to Burghley does not acknowledge that he may be vile
&gt;&gt;&gt;or even that he may be esteemed by some to be vile. He resents Burghley's
&gt;&gt;&gt;talking to his men because Burghley's doing so does not show the kind of
&gt;&gt;&gt;respect that Oxford feels entitled to. Unlike what we see in Paul or in
&gt;&gt;&gt;Lyly or in Melbancke or in Shakespeare, morality is not an issue in
&gt;&gt;&gt;Oxford's use of &quot;I am that I am&quot;; rather we see injured pride.

&gt; Thanks for the full and prompt reply, Terry. It would seem that when
&gt; Shakespeare wrote. &quot;I am that I am,&quot; he was just in his Popeye mood, as I
always
&gt; assumed, and used a locution probably a lot of people used at the time
although
&gt; it has seldom been tagged by scholars in published works of the time.

&gt; I rather doubt Lynne will ever agree. Shakespeare's &quot;I am that I am&quot; is
one of
&gt; the two main reasons she believes Oxford was Shakespeare, according to my
&gt; reading of some things she's written.

No, of course that's not true, Bob G.1. (Who is G.2?) I have said somewhere
that everyone needs a different burden of proof, but the bits of the sonnets
I mentioned to David are not the two main reasons I believe Oxford is
Shakespeare. They're just what finally tipped the scales for me.

We're also looking up the original in the Torah to see what we come up with
by way of a translation for &quot;I am that I am.&quot; I should say rather that
Michael is seeing what he can come up with. I'm just holding the flashlight.

Here are two more examples of the common Elizabethan (and earlier) use of
&quot;that&quot; for &quot;that which&quot;:

He smylde, and thus he answerd than, &quot;Desire can have no greater payne
Then for to see an other man that he desirethe to obtayne,
Nor greater Joy Can be than this,
Than to enjoy that others mysse.&quot;

The author of these lines was the 17th Earl of Oxford.

This is really in response to both your emails:

Well, we've been stewing over the Hebrew in 3.14. One of the problems is
that there are no vowels, However, it appears that *in the Hebrew* God says
something to the effect of &quot;I will be who I will be.&quot; It's interesting that
in the English translations the line is rendered in(to) the present tense,
usually &quot;I am that I am,&quot; or &quot;I am who I am.&quot; Perhaps this makes it appear,
at least on the surface, a bit more decipherable.

To me it is a conundrum. Although you suggest that the sentence tells us
that God is that which exists by definition, I think the meaning of the
sentence, rather like the essence of God, is deliberately unknowable. And
therefore I'd have to say that the same is true, to some extent, when Oxford
and Shakespeare use the sentence about themselves. We think we know what it
means, we believe we have some grasp of it, but it's a delusion. They are
consciously copying God or God through St. Paul, and what God says is really
not definable. The wonder of it is that two men at roughly the same time
both have the chutzpah, as we say in Jewish, to use God's words about
himself when referring to *themselves*. The arrogance of both men is
astonishing.

But they don't. They do not say, simpliciter, &quot;I am that I am.&quot; In each
case, the words are part of a longer sentence, and in neither case does
the context support the reading that either person intends his reader to
take him for God. In Oxford's case, the words are part of a complaint
that while he is the queen's creature, he does not with to be treated as
Burghley's. Can you imagine the God of Moses saying, &quot;if it's OK with the

You have not dealt with the difference between the use in Exodus and that

That Oxford was arrogant I grant you, but that he thought of himself or
wrote of himself as if he thought he were God is not something that you
have shown. What makes you think Oxford was quoting Exodus and not 1
Corinthians? What makes you think Oxford and Shakespeare could not have
been influenced by Lyly or Melbancke, or by other texts in which the words
&quot;I am that I am&quot; occur?

We know that Oxford in his verse sometimes used &quot;that&quot; in the sense of
&quot;that which&quot; -- this usage was not peculiar to Oxford, of course; it was
very common in Elizabethan literature, and anyone who digs an inch deep
into the matter can come up with dozens of contemporary instances.

We know that &quot;I am that I am&quot; appeared in Exodus and (in a different
sense) in 1 Corinthians. It also occurred in the Book of Common Prayer --
see the epistle for the 11th Sunday after Trinity, which is from 1
Corinthians.

The phrase appears among John Knox's dying words, according to William
Perkins's *salve for a Sicke Man* (1597):

&quot;He [Knox] lay on his death bedde silent for the space of four hours, very
often giving great sighes, sobbes, and grones, so as the standers by well
perceived that he was troubled with some grievous temptation: and when at
length he was raised in his bedde, they asked him how he did, to whome he
answered thus: that in his life he had indured many combates and conflicts
with Satan, but that now most mightily the roaring lyon had assaulted him:
often (said he) before he set my sinnes before mine eyes, often he urged
me to desperation, often he laboured to intangle me with the delights of
the world, but being vanquished by the sword of the spirit, which is the
word of God, he could not prevaile. But now he assaults me another way:
for the wily serpent would perswade me that I shall merit eternall life
for my fidelitie in my ministrie. But blessed be God which brought to my
minde such Scriptures whereby I might quench the fierie darts of the
devill, which were, What hast thou that thou hast not received: and, By
the grace of God, I am that I am: and, not I but the grace of God in me:
and thus being vanquished he departed.&quot;

No doubt the words appear in a number of sermons and tracts; they may also
occur in wills of the period, and it would not be surprising to find them
in private letters NOT written by Oxford.

I really do not know what the Oxfordian claim is supposed to be on this
matter. A common phrase, known to just about everybody, something that
everyone who attended church services regularly would hear every year,
something that appears not just in scripture (twice), and not just in
devotional literature but also appears in secular works -- somehow the
appearance of this phrase in Oxford's letter to Burghley and in a sonnet
by Shakespeare published 25 years later is supposed to persuade us that
the author of the *Sonnets* must have seen Oxford's letter? Are we really
meant to take this sort of thing seriously?

Contrast that line of reasoning with the kind of coincidence that would
indeed persuade us that the writer of one text must have been familiar
with another.

Brian Melbancke's *Philotimus* was printed in 1583, but he quotes two of
Oxford's poems that had not yet appeared in print; on the basis of these
quotations, scholars are able to give a terminal date for the composition
of those poems. (Of course if there were Melbanckians around, as there
are Oxfordians, we would be told that Oxford was the borrower, and not
Melbancke).

Philotimus writes in a letter to his beloved (page 131), &quot;Ah Aurelia,
faine would I singe, but furie makes me fret, and rage hath sworne to
seeke reuenge of wronge.&quot;

Melbancke is quoting the first lines of Oxford's &quot;Fain would I sing, but
fury makes me fret.&quot;

In his next letter, Philotimus says (page 139), &quot;Tenne thousand times a
day desire doth liue and dye, faine would I liue to gaine thy loue, or die
with griefe to leaue with losse.&quot; Melbancke is quoting Oxford's &quot;When
wert thou born, desire,&quot; which concludes with these lines:

NO, NO, DESYR BOTHE LYVES AND DYES,
TEN THOWSAND TYMES A DAY.

Why is this case of influence persuasive while the &quot;I am that I am&quot; fails?
For one thing, the lines from Oxford's poems did not also occur in Exodus.
For another, they did not also occur in 1 Corinthians. Third, they did
not occur in the Book of Common Prayer. Fourth, they did not occur in
*Euphues*. Fifth, they were not among John Knox's dying words. In fact,
we cannot trace those lines to any source earlier than Oxford's poems.

Melbancke does not name the author of the lines; he does not even identify
them as quotations (nor does he identify most of the other sources for the
many things he ...

&gt;&gt; Oxford wanted to make it clear that while he was the queen's servant, he
&gt;&gt; was no other person's. If he had denied being the queen's servant (if he
&gt;&gt; had said &quot;I am that I am regardless of the queen&quot;) then he might be

&gt;&gt;&quot;is that he is&quot; without qualification, Oxford is very much the queen's
&gt;&gt; creature: but he does NOT consider himself Burghley's creature.

&gt;&gt; Paul &quot;is that he is&quot; by the grace of God, as is every one who is in God's

&gt;&gt; The speaker of the sonnet &quot;is that he is&quot; in a different sense from Paul
&gt;&gt; or from Oxford -- he is whatever it is that he is, but he doesn't tell us
&gt;&gt; what it is that he is (it may depend on what the meaning of &quot;is&quot; is).

&gt;&gt; He says &quot;I may be straight&quot; -- but while he appears to be in some ways
&gt;&gt; esteemed as &quot;vile&quot; it is also possible that he actually IS somewhat
&gt;&gt;&quot;vile.&quot; The speaker does not say that his is-ness is by the grace of God
&gt;&gt; (as Paul says) or of the queen (as Oxford allows) -- in fact, if he is
&gt;&gt; indeed &quot;vile,&quot; it might be a kind of blasphemy to blame God for this. As
&gt;&gt; Melbancke says, while God's graces are his gifts, his punishments are
&gt;&gt; earned -- &quot;if ... thou have felt [God's] heavy hand, it is your merit, not
&gt;&gt; His desire.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Oxford in his letter to Burghley does not acknowledge that he may be vile
&gt;&gt; or even that he may be esteemed by some to be vile. He resents Burghley's
&gt;&gt; talking to his men because Burghley's doing so does not show the kind of

&gt; To me it is a conundrum. Although you suggest that the sentence tells us

&gt; That's a theological point open (obviously) to dispute.

Well. I'd prefer to say obviously open to *discussion*; however, please note
I was merely giving my own opinion on it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; And therefore I'd have to say that the same is true, to some extent,
&gt;&gt; when Oxford and Shakespeare use the sentence about themselves.

&gt; But they don't. They do not say, simpliciter, &quot;I am that I am.&quot; In each
&gt; case, the words are part of a longer sentence, and in neither case does
&gt; the context support the reading that either person intends his reader to
&gt; take him for God. In Oxford's case, the words are part of a complaint
&gt; that while he is the queen's creature, he does not with to be treated as
&gt; Burghley's. Can you imagine the God of Moses saying, &quot;if it's OK with the
&gt; pharaoh, I am that I am&quot;?

"/>

No, Terry, I can't; however, I would say this is a larger issue than whether
it's part of a longer sentence, that issue being that both Oxford (from a
study of his Geneva) and Shakespeare (from a study of the sonnets and plays)
seem well versed in the Bible, not unusual at the time, and therefore, when
they use these words we can be reasonably sure they are alluding to Ex 3.14.
One assumes they also knew that &quot;I am that I am&quot; is somehow tied to YHWH.
Thus, they used it in respect to themselves while fully understanding its
greater implications. It's not as if they chose by accident the words of
God. They knew what they were doing. They used the exact text of the Geneva.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; We think we know what it means, we believe we have some grasp of it, but
&gt;&gt; it's a delusion.

&gt; A mystery, perhaps, but hardly a delusion.

"/>

Well, I would agree it's a mystery, but if we really think we know what it
means, then we are deluded. Jewish scholars have been arguing over the
Hebrew for many, many years. Since they don't agree with one another, I
would say we probably can't say with any certainty what was meant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; They are consciously copying God or God through St. Paul, and what God
&gt;&gt; says is really not definable.

&gt; You have not dealt with the difference between the use in Exodus and that
&gt; in 1 Corinthians. Paul is NOT claiming to be God. There are expressions
&gt; that are taken as echoes of God's claim in the New Testament, but they are
&gt; given to Jesus.

"/>

Paul is definitely not claiming to be God, but I would say that he feels
inspired by the *spirit* and *grace* of God and therefore he can make the
same statement. There is something else. The two statements, in Ex and
Corinth, were written in different languages. One could argue that Paul was
not actually quoting God. Are we sure, for example, that as a non-Jew he
knew the OT very well? (I'm really not certain of this. Just throwing the
question out because it seems possible to me that the translations were made
to agree.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; The wonder of it is that two men at roughly the same time

&gt; Oxford's letter is dated October 30, 1584. Shakespeare's *Sonnets* were
&gt; published in 1609. Some of them may have been written somewhat earlier,
&gt; but we cannot date that sonnet to within a generation of the time Oxford
&gt; wrote.

"/>

Some of them may have been written SOMEWHAT earlier? But Terry, you know
that they were. Besides, when I talk about roughly the same time, I mean
around the turn of the 17th century, as opposed to the 18th or 19th.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; both have the chutzpah, as we say in Jewish, to use God's words about
&gt;&gt; himself when referring to *themselves*. The arrogance of both men is
&gt;&gt; astonishing.

&gt; That Oxford was arrogant I grant you, but that he thought of himself or
&gt; wrote of himself as if he thought he were God is not something that you
&gt; have shown. What makes you think Oxford was quoting Exodus and not 1
&gt; Corinthians?

"/>

Does he say &quot;By the grace of God&quot; or something similar? Does Shakespeare?
They both knew the Bible well enough to quote the words within Paul's
context if they meant their words to be taken as being his rather than
God's.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What makes you think Oxford and Shakespeare could not have
&gt; been influenced by Lyly or Melbancke, or by other texts in which the words
&gt;&quot;I am that I am&quot; occur?

Well, of course, Oxford and Lyly were connected, and it has been suggested
that Oxford was the model for Euphues--not something I wish to argue because
I'm not sure enough about it; however, I would again say that the words were
used very differently, and that both Oxford and Shakespeare were using the
words with reference to THEMSELVES.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; We know that Oxford in his verse sometimes used &quot;that&quot; in the sense of

Yes, but we also know both he and Shakespeare were versed in the Geneva and
likely the Bishops etc, and would be well aware of the heft of the words.
Literary or Biblical allusions have enormous weight. You cannot separate
those words from what God said by suggesting that Oxford or anyone else used
&quot;that&quot; for &quot;that which.&quot; It's like saying I would use a sentence such as &quot;It
was the best of times, it was the worst of times...&quot; because I understand
contrast, rather than that I would necessarily have a consciousness of where
those words came from.

Thanks, Art. That has certainly capped a two day break during which the
hotel tried to throw us out because they said we didn't have a reservation,
our tickets were so far back for *The Producers* that I could only be
pleased that I hated the show, and we lined up for two hours in the freezing
cold to get into an Egyptian exhibit, only to realise, when we finally made
it, that I'd recently seen the same exhibition in Balt.

Perhaps 36 will be a luckier number.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynne's reply on this thread appears on Google but has not made it to
&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usenet server yet, so I am responding here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Sun, 14 Mar 2004, LynneE wrote:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for a very informative post, Terry. I hadn't seen the
&gt; Melbancke
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before. Of course, I would still suggest that Oxford and Shakespeare
&gt; use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Biblical quote in a very different way from Melbancke and Lyly.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford's and Shakespeare's usage, where the words are turned in
&gt; order to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be self-referential, is pretty close to blasphemy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All four authors use the words &quot;I am that I am&quot; differently, and they
&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; used very differently in Exodus than they are in 1 Corinthians.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Blasphemy is in the ear of the beholder. There is no blasphemy if
&gt; Oxford
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is echoing St. Paul (or if Shakespeare is, for that matter). What
&gt; WOULD
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be blasphemous, I suppose, would be if Oxford had said &quot;MY name is &quot;I
&gt; am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that I am&quot; -- but he did not say that. Unlike God, Oxford's essence
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not identical with his existence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford wanted to make it clear that while he was the queen's servant,
&gt; he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was no other person's. If he had denied being the queen's servant (if
&gt; he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had said &quot;I am that I am regardless of the queen&quot;) then he might be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tending toward lese-majesty -- but he said no such thing. Unlike God,
&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;is that he is&quot; without qualification, Oxford is very much the queen's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; creature: but he does NOT consider himself Burghley's creature.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Paul &quot;is that he is&quot; by the grace of God, as is every one who is in
&gt; God's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; graces.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The speaker of the sonnet &quot;is that he is&quot; in a different sense from
&gt; Paul
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or from Oxford -- he is whatever it is that he is, but he doesn't tell
&gt; us
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what it is that he is (it may depend on what the meaning of &quot;is&quot; is).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He says &quot;I may be straight&quot; -- but while he appears to be in some ways
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; esteemed as &quot;vile&quot; it is also possible that he actually IS somewhat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;vile.&quot; The speaker does not say that his is-ness is by the grace of
&gt; God
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (as Paul says) or of the queen (as Oxford allows) -- in fact, if he is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indeed &quot;vile,&quot; it might be a kind of blasphemy to blame God for this.
&gt; As
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Melbancke says, while God's graces are his gifts, his punishments are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earned -- &quot;if ... thou have felt [God's] heavy hand, it is your merit,
&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; His desire.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford in his letter to Burghley does not acknowledge that he may be
&gt; vile
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or even that he may be esteemed by some to be vile. He resents
&gt; Burghley's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; talking to his men because Burghley's doing so does not show the kind
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; respect that Oxford feels entitled to. Unlike what we see in Paul or
&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lyly or in Melbancke or in Shakespeare, morality is not an issue in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford's use of &quot;I am that I am&quot;; rather we see injured pride.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is really in response to both your emails:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, we've been stewing over the Hebrew in 3.14. One of the problems is
&gt;&gt;&gt; that there are no vowels, However, it appears that *in the Hebrew* God
&gt; says
&gt;&gt;&gt; something to the effect of &quot;I will be who I will be.&quot; It's interesting
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the English translations the line is rendered in(to) the present
&gt; tense,
&gt;&gt;&gt; usually &quot;I am that I am,&quot; or &quot;I am who I am.&quot; Perhaps this makes it
&gt; appear,
&gt;&gt;&gt; at least on the surface, a bit more decipherable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; To me it is a conundrum. Although you suggest that the sentence tells us
&gt;&gt;&gt; that God is that which exists by definition, I think the meaning of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence, rather like the essence of God, is deliberately unknowable.
&gt; And
&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore I'd have to say that the same is true, to some extent, when
&gt; Oxford
&gt;&gt;&gt; and Shakespeare use the sentence about themselves. We think we know what
&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; means, we believe we have some grasp of it, but it's a delusion. They
&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt; consciously copying God or God through St. Paul, and what God says is
&gt; really
&gt;&gt;&gt; not definable. The wonder of it is that two men at roughly the same time
&gt;&gt;&gt; both have the chutzpah, as we say in Jewish, to use God's words about
&gt;&gt;&gt; himself when referring to *themselves*. The arrogance of both men is
&gt;&gt;&gt; astonishing.
&gt;&gt; I'm afraid that you're missing the most conclusive argument of all,
&gt; Lynne --
&gt;&gt;&quot;Exodus&quot; is a perfect anagram of &quot;Ox: Deus.&quot; What better proof could you
&gt; seek
&gt;&gt; that Oxford is likening himself to God rather than to Popeye or Al Gore?

&gt;&gt; You have not dealt with the difference between the use in Exodus and that
&gt;&gt; in 1 Corinthians. Paul is NOT claiming to be God. There are expressions
&gt;&gt; that are taken as echoes of God's claim in the New Testament, but they are
&gt;&gt; given to Jesus.
&gt; Paul is definitely not claiming to be God, but I would say that he feels
&gt; inspired by the *spirit* and *grace* of God and therefore he can make the
&gt; same statement. There is something else. The two statements, in Ex and
&gt; Corinth, were written in different languages. One could argue that Paul was
&gt; not actually quoting God. Are we sure, for example, that as a non-Jew he
&gt; knew the OT very well?

"/>

What are you talking about, Lynne? Paul most certainly *was* a Jew
(originally named Saul), although later in his career he was of course
instrumental in extending what had begun as a small Jewish sect to the
Gentile communities of the Roman empire as well. (However, as far as I
know, Popeye was not a Jew, nor is Al Gore, so you're on firmer ground
there.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (I'm really not certain of this. Just throwing the
&gt; question out because it seems possible to me that the translations were made
&gt; to agree.)

"/>

In a great many Biblical translations the words of Paul are
translated quite differently from the words of God in Exodus.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; The wonder of it is that two men at roughly the same time
&gt;&gt; Oxford's letter is dated October 30, 1584. Shakespeare's *Sonnets* were
&gt;&gt; published in 1609. Some of them may have been written somewhat earlier,
&gt;&gt; but we cannot date that sonnet to within a generation of the time Oxford
&gt;&gt; wrote.
&gt; Some of them may have been written SOMEWHAT earlier? But Terry, you know
&gt; that they were. Besides, when I talk about roughly the same time, I mean
&gt; around the turn of the 17th century, as opposed to the 18th or 19th.
&gt;&gt;&gt; both have the chutzpah, as we say in Jewish, to use God's words about
&gt;&gt;&gt; himself when referring to *themselves*. The arrogance of both men is
&gt;&gt;&gt; astonishing.
&gt;&gt; That Oxford was arrogant I grant you, but that he thought of himself or
&gt;&gt; wrote of himself as if he thought he were God is not something that you
&gt;&gt; have shown. What makes you think Oxford was quoting Exodus and not 1
&gt;&gt; Corinthians?
&gt; Does he say &quot;By the grace of God&quot; or something similar? Does Shakespeare?
&gt; They both knew the Bible well enough to quote the words within Paul's
&gt; context if they meant their words to be taken as being his rather than
&gt; God's.
&gt;&gt; What makes you think Oxford and Shakespeare could not have
&gt;&gt; been influenced by Lyly or Melbancke, or by other texts in which the words
&gt;&gt;&quot;I am that I am&quot; occur?
&gt; Well, of course, Oxford and Lyly were connected, and it has been suggested
&gt; that Oxford was the model for Euphues--not something I wish to argue because
&gt; I'm not sure enough about it; however, I would again say that the words were
&gt; used very differently, and that both Oxford and Shakespeare were using the
&gt; words with reference to THEMSELVES.
&gt;&gt; We know that Oxford in his verse sometimes used &quot;that&quot; in the sense of
&gt;&gt;&quot;that which&quot; -- this usage was not peculiar to Oxford, of course; it was
&gt;&gt; very common in Elizabethan literature, and anyone who digs an inch deep
&gt;&gt; into the matter can come up with dozens of contemporary instances.
&gt; Yes, but we also know both he and Shakespeare were versed in the Geneva and
&gt; likely the Bishops etc, and would be well aware of the heft of the words.

"/>

On what do you base your assertion that Oxford was VERsed in the
Geneva Bible, Lynne? He may VERy likely have owned one, if the
provenance of the Bible that Dr. Stritmatter studied has been correctly
determined, but the marginalia therein scarcely seem indicative of deep
scriptural knowledge.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Literary or Biblical allusions have enormous weight. You cannot separate
&gt; those words from what God said by suggesting that Oxford or anyone else used
&gt;&quot;that&quot; for &quot;that which.&quot; It's like saying I would use a sentence such as &quot;It
&gt; was the best of times, it was the worst of times...&quot; because I understand
&gt; contrast, rather than that I would necessarily have a consciousness of where
&gt; those words came from.
&gt;&gt; We know that &quot;I am that I am&quot; appeared in Exodus and (in a different
&gt;&gt; sense) in 1 Corinthians. It also occurred in the Book of Common Prayer --
&gt;&gt; see the epistle for the 11th Sunday after Trinity, which is from 1
&gt;&gt; Corinthians.

&gt;&gt; The phrase appears among John Knox's dying words, according to William
&gt;&gt; Perkins's *salve for a Sicke Man* (1597):

&gt;&gt;&quot;He [Knox] lay on his death bedde silent for the space of four hours, very
&gt;&gt; often giving great sighes, sobbes, and grones, so as the standers by well
&gt;&gt; perceived that he was troubled with some grievous temptation: and when at
&gt;&gt; length he was raised in his bedde, they asked him how he did, to whome he
&gt;&gt; answered thus: that in his life he had indured many combates and conflicts
&gt;&gt; with Satan, but that now most mightily the roaring lyon had assaulted him:
&gt;&gt; often (said he) before he set my sinnes before mine eyes, often he urged
&gt;&gt; me to desperation, often he laboured to intangle me with the delights of
&gt;&gt; the world, but being vanquished by the sword of the spirit, which is the
&gt;&gt; word of God, he could not prevaile. But now he assaults me another way:
&gt;&gt; for the wily serpent would perswade me that I shall merit eternall life
&gt;&gt; for my fidelitie in my ministrie. But blessed be God which brought to my
&gt;&gt; minde such Scriptures whereby I might quench the fierie darts of the
&gt;&gt; devill, which were, What hast thou that thou hast not received: and, By
&gt;&gt; the grace of God, I am that I am: and, not I but the grace of God in me:
&gt;&gt; and thus being vanquished he departed.&quot;
&gt; This is totally different. Knox is saying that he is reminded (by God) of
&gt; scriptures such as &quot;by the grace of God, I am that I am.&quot; The clue is *WHICH
&gt; WERE*. He is not a) quoting the words with reference to himself or b)
&gt; quoting Ex 3.14. He is clearly quoting Paul.
&gt;&gt; No doubt the words appear in a number of sermons and tracts;
&gt; Jeez, Terry, one would hope that they did. One would also suggest that they
&gt; were said with reference to God rather than with reference to the
&gt; sermonizers.

"/>

That does not necessarily follow.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; they may also
&gt;&gt; occur in wills of the period, and it would not be surprising to find them
&gt;&gt; in private letters NOT written by Oxford.
&gt; Well, it MIGHT not be surprising (although it would be to me), but so far
&gt; you haven't raised a single instance of a private letter not written by
&gt; Oxford in which these words appear and at the same time refer to the writer
&gt; himself. You haven't even given an instance where the words appear in a
&gt; letter and are not self-referential.
&gt;&gt; I really do not know what the Oxfordian claim is supposed to be on this
&gt;&gt; matter. A common phrase, known to just about everybody, something that
&gt;&gt; everyone who attended church services regularly would hear every year,
&gt;&gt; something that appears not just in scripture (twice), and not just in
&gt;&gt; devotional literature but also appears in secular works -- somehow the
&gt;&gt; appearance of this phrase in Oxford's letter to Burghley and in a sonnet
&gt;&gt; by Shakespeare published 25 years later is supposed to persuade us that
&gt;&gt; the author of the *Sonnets* must have seen Oxford's letter? Are we really
&gt;&gt; meant to take this sort of thing seriously?
&gt; No. Of course not.

"/>

I'm relieved to hear it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We are meant to take seriously the fact that there are
&gt; many such coincidences between Oxford and Shakespeare.

"/>

There are? What do you mean by &quot;many&quot;? And can be more explicit
about which ones you have in mind? I'm very fond of many of the
locutions of Nabokov and of the wit of Piet Hein, and I use both freely
in both writing and speech; that circumstance does not suggest by any
means that I wrote _Pale Fire_ or _Grooks_.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't say that the
&gt; author of the sonnets must have seen Oxford's letter. I think he must have
&gt; *written* Oxford's letter.

"/>

That's certainly a jarring non sequitur!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm certainly not suggesting that one copied from
&gt; another, only that they both had enough arrogance copy God.
&gt;&gt; Contrast that line of reasoning with the kind of coincidence that would
&gt;&gt; indeed persuade us that the writer of one text must have been familiar
&gt;&gt; with another.

&gt;&gt; Brian Melbancke's *Philotimus* was printed in 1583, but he quotes two of
&gt;&gt; Oxford's poems that had not yet appeared in print; on the basis of these
&gt;&gt; quotations, scholars are able to give a terminal date for the composition
&gt;&gt; of those poems. (Of course if there were Melbanckians around, as there
&gt;&gt; are Oxfordians, we would be told that Oxford was the borrower, and not
&gt;&gt; Melbancke).

&gt;&gt; Philotimus writes in a letter to his beloved (page 131), &quot;Ah Aurelia,
&gt;&gt; faine would I singe, but furie makes me fret, and rage hath sworne to
&gt;&gt; seeke reuenge of wronge.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Melbancke is quoting the first lines of Oxford's &quot;Fain would I sing, but
&gt;&gt; fury makes me fret.&quot;

&gt;&gt; In his next letter, Philotimus says (page 139), &quot;Tenne thousand times a
&gt;&gt; day desire doth liue and dye, faine would I liue to gaine thy loue, or die
&gt;&gt; with griefe to leaue with losse.&quot; Melbancke is quoting Oxford's &quot;When
&gt;&gt; wert thou born, desire,&quot; which concludes with these lines:

&gt;&gt; NO, NO, DESYR BOTHE LYVES AND DYES,
&gt;&gt; TEN THOWSAND TYMES A DAY.

&gt;&gt; Why is this case of influence persuasive while the &quot;I am that I am&quot; fails?
&gt;&gt; For one thing, the lines from Oxford's poems did not also occur in Exodus.
&gt;&gt; For another, they did not also occur in 1 Corinthians. Third, they did
&gt;&gt; not occur in the Book of Common Prayer. Fourth, they did not occur in

&gt;&gt;&gt; You have not dealt with the difference between the use in Exodus and
that
&gt;&gt;&gt; in 1 Corinthians. Paul is NOT claiming to be God. There are
expressions
&gt;&gt;&gt; that are taken as echoes of God's claim in the New Testament, but they
are
&gt;&gt;&gt; given to Jesus.

&gt;&gt; Paul is definitely not claiming to be God, but I would say that he feels
&gt;&gt; inspired by the *spirit* and *grace* of God and therefore he can make
the
&gt;&gt; same statement. There is something else. The two statements, in Ex and
&gt;&gt; Corinth, were written in different languages. One could argue that Paul
was
&gt;&gt; not actually quoting God. Are we sure, for example, that as a non-Jew he
&gt;&gt; knew the OT very well?

&gt; What are you talking about, Lynne? Paul most certainly *was* a Jew
&gt; (originally named Saul),

"/>

Yep, knew he was Saul of Tarsus. What was I thinking? But look at it this
way--another member of the clan!

although later in his career he was of course

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; instrumental in extending what had begun as a small Jewish sect to the
&gt; Gentile communities of the Roman empire as well. (However, as far as I
&gt; know, Popeye was not a Jew, nor is Al Gore, so you're on firmer ground
&gt; there.)

"/>

Oh, yes, sorry, I once knew that. Medication has addled my brain, likely
permanently. And I've been trying to sort out an MS where a copy editor has
turned all my little slave Rachel's speeches into standard English.

I kept thinking Saul/Paul was a Roman, which he was, and in my typically
muddled state imagined that Jews and Romans were mutually exclusive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; (I'm really not certain of this. Just throwing the
&gt;&gt; question out because it seems possible to me that the translations were
made
&gt;&gt; to agree.)

&gt; In a great many Biblical translations the words of Paul are
&gt; translated quite differently from the words of God in Exodus.

"/>

Yes. It's hard to know if Paul meant to echo God. It is not hard, however,
in the case of Shakespeare and Oxford. They both used the exact words of an
English translation of the time.

snip

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Yes, but we also know both he and Shakespeare were versed in the Geneva
and
&gt;&gt; likely the Bishops etc, and would be well aware of the heft of the
words.

&gt; On what do you base your assertion that Oxford was VERsed in the
&gt; Geneva Bible, Lynne? He may VERy likely have owned one, if the
&gt; provenance of the Bible that Dr. Stritmatter studied has been correctly
&gt; determined, but the marginalia therein scarcely seem indicative of deep
&gt; scriptural knowledge.

"/>

We KNOW he owned AT LEAST one, David. There is a bill of sale for it. We
also know that the Bible Roger studied belonged to de Vere. It has his arms
on the cover. What we don't know with any exactitude is whether the Geneva
for which there is a bill of sale is the same Geneva that is in the
Folger's. It's likely that it is. The marginalia in the Folger's Geneva seem
to suggest that Oxford read his Bible and was therefore versed in it. He
wouldn't have needed profound scriptural knowledge to know where &quot;I am that
I am&quot; came from or what it signified. There are underlinings of various
verses of Exodus in de Vere's Geneva Bible, so one assumes he read the
entire book of Exodus. I hope we're not going to get into a discussion now
about whether he actually wrote the marginalia in the Bible. If we are,
please have reasonable arguments ready to counter Appendix H: Forensic
Paleography, in Roger's dissertation. It's certainly not my forte, so you
can argue amongst yourselves.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Literary or Biblical allusions have enormous weight. You cannot separate
&gt;&gt; those words from what God said by suggesting that Oxford or anyone else
used
&gt;&gt;&quot;that&quot; for &quot;that which.&quot; It's like saying I would use a sentence such as
&quot;It
&gt;&gt; was the best of times, it was the worst of times...&quot; because I
understand
&gt;&gt; contrast, rather than that I would necessarily have a consciousness of
where
&gt;&gt; those words came from.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We know that &quot;I am that I am&quot; appeared in Exodus and (in a different
&gt;&gt;&gt; sense) in 1 Corinthians. It also occurred in the Book of Common
Prayer --
&gt;&gt;&gt; see the epistle for the 11th Sunday after Trinity, which is from 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; Corinthians.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The phrase appears among John Knox's dying words, according to William
&gt;&gt;&gt; Perkins's *salve for a Sicke Man* (1597):

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;He [Knox] lay on his death bedde silent for the space of four hours,
very
&gt;&gt;&gt; often giving great sighes, sobbes, and grones, so as the standers by
well
&gt;&gt;&gt; perceived that he was troubled with some grievous temptation: and
when at
&gt;&gt;&gt; length he was raised in his bedde, they asked him how he did, to whome
he
&gt;&gt;&gt; answered thus: that in his life he had indured many combates and
conflicts
&gt;&gt;&gt; with Satan, but that now most mightily the roaring lyon had assaulted
him:
&gt;&gt;&gt; often (said he) before he set my sinnes before mine eyes, often he
urged
&gt;&gt;&gt; me to desperation, often he laboured to intangle me with the delights
of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the world, but being vanquished by the sword of the spirit, which is
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; word of God, he could not prevaile. But now he assaults me another
way:
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the wily serpent would perswade me that I shall merit eternall
life
&gt;&gt;&gt; for my fidelitie in my ministrie. But blessed be God which brought to
my
&gt;&gt;&gt; minde such Scriptures whereby I might quench the fierie darts of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; devill, which were, What hast thou that thou hast not received: and,
By
&gt;&gt;&gt; the grace of God, I am that I am: and, not I but the grace of God in
me:
&gt;&gt;&gt; and thus being vanquished he departed.&quot;

&gt;&gt; This is totally different. Knox is saying that he is reminded (by God)
of
&gt;&gt; scriptures such as &quot;by the grace of God, I am that I am.&quot; The clue is
*WHICH
&gt;&gt; WERE*. He is not a) quoting the words with reference to himself or b)
&gt;&gt; quoting Ex 3.14. He is clearly quoting Paul.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No doubt the words appear in a number of sermons and tracts;

&gt;&gt; Jeez, Terry, one would hope that they did. One would also suggest that
they
&gt;&gt; were said with reference to God rather than with reference to the
&gt;&gt; sermonizers.

&gt; That does not necessarily follow.

"/>

Good. That's fine. Give me some examples from the period where it doesn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; they may also
&gt;&gt;&gt; occur in wills of the period, and it would not be surprising to find
them
&gt;&gt;&gt; in private letters NOT written by Oxford.

&gt;&gt; Well, it MIGHT not be surprising (although it would be to me), but so
far
&gt;&gt; you haven't raised a single instance of a private letter not written by
&gt;&gt; Oxford in which these words appear and at the same time refer to the
writer
&gt;&gt; himself. You haven't even given an instance where the words appear in a
&gt;&gt; letter and are not self-referential.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I really do not know what the Oxfordian claim is supposed to be on
this
&gt;&gt;&gt; matter. A common phrase, known to just about everybody, something
that
&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone who attended church services regularly would hear every year,
&gt;&gt;&gt; something that appears not just in scripture (twice), and not just in
&gt;&gt;&gt; devotional literature but also appears in secular works -- somehow the
&gt;&gt;&gt; appearance of this phrase in Oxford's letter to Burghley and in a
sonnet
&gt;&gt;&gt; by Shakespeare published 25 years later is supposed to persuade us
that
&gt;&gt;&gt; the author of the *Sonnets* must have seen Oxford's letter? Are we
really
&gt;&gt;&gt; meant to take this sort of thing seriously?

&gt;&gt; No. Of course not.

&gt; I'm relieved to hear it.

I'm relieved you're relieved.

In fact

And we're relieved, I think you'll say,
To argue in this kind of way;
And I'm relieved

We're both relieved--too-looral-lay!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; We are meant to take seriously the fact that there are
&gt;&gt; many such coincidences between Oxford and Shakespeare.

&gt; There are? What do you mean by &quot;many&quot;? And can be more explicit
&gt; about which ones you have in mind?

"/>

I'll tell you when you come through with the sermons of the time where the
sermonizers use the &quot;I am that I am&quot; bit when referring to themselves.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I'm very fond of many of the
&gt; locutions of Nabokov and of the wit of Piet Hein, and I use both freely
&gt; in both writing and speech;

"/>

Presumably their work is published. ;)

that circumstance does not suggest by any

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; means that I wrote _Pale Fire_ or _Grooks_.

"/>

Pity. Think how famous you would be.

Oxford couldn't have copied either &quot;I am lame&quot; or &quot;I am that I am&quot; from
Shakespeare, because as Terry was so quick to point out, the Oxford came
before the Shakespeare. Therefore one suggestion is that Shakespeare read
Oxford's letters. Rather a feat as the letters were private. But perhaps you
would argue that Shakespeare of Stratford had thoughts of holding the canopy
too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I don't say that the
&gt;&gt; author of the sonnets must have seen Oxford's letter. I think he must
have
&gt;&gt; *written* Oxford's letter.

&gt; That's certainly a jarring non sequitur!

"/>

And as the letters were private, as I said above, to my mind *Shakespeare
was Oxford* is a more likely scenario than *Shakespeare read Oxford*. But
that's only one jigsaw piece in a whole puzzle.

snip

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Either you're not getting it or I'm nuts. Either or both are possible.

&gt; I'll be discreet and remain uncommitted regarding which possibility
&gt; seems to me more likely. :-)

"/>

It's impressive that you're so mindful of Terry's feelings. :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why should we be impressed that Oxford, in a private letter to
Burghley
&gt;&gt;&gt; written 25 years before the *Sonnets* appeared, also happened to use
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; expression? More to the point, perhaps, Lynne, is why exactly does
this
&gt;&gt;&gt; happenstance impress you?

&gt;&gt; Because I cannot find ANY instance of it during the period, except in
the

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is really in response to both your emails:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, we've been stewing over the Hebrew in 3.14. One of the problems is
&gt;&gt;&gt; that there are no vowels, However, it appears that *in the Hebrew* God
&gt;&gt;&gt; says something to the effect of &quot;I will be who I will be.&quot; It's
&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting that in the English translations the line is rendered in(to)
&gt;&gt;&gt; the present tense, usually &quot;I am that I am,&quot; or &quot;I am who I am.&quot; Perhaps
&gt;&gt;&gt; this makes it appear, at least on the surface, a bit more decipherable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; To me it is a conundrum. Although you suggest that the sentence tells us
&gt;&gt;&gt; that God is that which exists by definition, I think the meaning of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence, rather like the essence of God, is deliberately unknowable.

&gt;&gt; That's a theological point open (obviously) to dispute.

&gt; Well. I'd prefer to say obviously open to *discussion*; however, please
&gt; note I was merely giving my own opinion on it.

That claim that God's essence WAS his existence was a Christian
commonplace, and still has its adherents.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; And therefore I'd have to say that the same is true, to some extent,
&gt;&gt;&gt; when Oxford and Shakespeare use the sentence about themselves.

&gt;&gt; But they don't. They do not say, simpliciter, &quot;I am that I am.&quot; In each
&gt;&gt; case, the words are part of a longer sentence, and in neither case does
&gt;&gt; the context support the reading that either person intends his reader to
&gt;&gt; take him for God. In Oxford's case, the words are part of a complaint
&gt;&gt; that while he is the queen's creature, he does not with to be treated as
&gt;&gt; Burghley's. Can you imagine the God of Moses saying, &quot;if it's OK with the
&gt;&gt; pharaoh, I am that I am&quot;?

The queen for Oxford occupies the role that neither the pharaoh nor any
other mortal occupies for the God of Moses.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I would say this is a larger issue than whether it's part of a longer

He certainly owned a Geneva Bible, and I do hope he studied it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and Shakespeare (from a study of the sonnets and plays) seem well versed
&gt; in the Bible, not unusual at the time, and therefore, when they use
&gt; these words we can be reasonably sure they are alluding to Ex 3.14.

We can be reasonably sure in each case that the author was alluding
(perhaps also alluding) to 1 Corinthians 15.10.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One assumes they also knew that &quot;I am that I am&quot; is somehow tied to
&gt; YHWH.

They might have associated the Tetragramaton with &quot;LORD.&quot;

You should not forget that the words are used in 1 Corinthians (where Paul
does NOT claim to be God) and that both Oxford and Shakespeare, as well as
a great many contemporaries, used &quot;that&quot; in the sense of &quot;that which.&quot;
We can be reasonably sure that Shakespeare knew *Euphues* (as Oxford may
well have been) as well as Exodus, 1 Corinthians, and the Book of Common
Prayer, and he could also have been familiar with Melbancke and even with
the story of John Knox's dying words. The phrase &quot;I am that I am&quot; was
common; everybody who went to church would have heard it every year.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thus, they used it in respect to themselves while fully understanding
&gt; its greater implications. It's not as if they chose by accident the
&gt; words of God. They knew what they were doing. They used the exact text
&gt; of the Geneva.

They are using the exact text of Exodus, of 1 Corinthians, of the Prayer
Book, of Lyly, of Melbancke, of Knox.

&gt; it means, then we are deluded. Jewish scholars have been arguing over
&gt; the Hebrew for many, many years. Since they don't agree with one
&gt; another, I would say we probably can't say with any certainty what was
&gt; meant.

There is no reason to believe that either Oxford or Shakespeare was a
Hebrew scholar. Their understanding of Exodus would have been Christian.
Whether they read scriptures in English or Latin, they would have
understood the difference between the words in Exodus and the words in 1
Corinthians.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; They are consciously copying God or God through St. Paul, and what God

It is NOT the same statement. Paul is NOT saying &quot;because I have faith I

by God's grace -- this is not the same thing as saying that his own
essence is his existence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is something else. The two statements, in Ex and Corinth, were

This is true -- but the Greek-reading Jewish community of Paul's time

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One could argue that Paul was not actually quoting God.

This is what I have been trying to tell you. This is one reason why in
most translations Paul's words are different from those in Exodus. We do
not find a note in the Geneva that directs us to read Paul's words as an
echo or fulfilment in any way of Exodus.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

He was a Jew. He knew his OT, and he believed that Jesus was the Messiah

I don't know that that is what happened. What may be more likely is that
we have a coincidence -- a coincidence made possible by the fact that in
the 16th Century, &quot;that&quot; was often used to mean &quot;that which.&quot; The &quot;that&quot;
in Exodus does not mean &quot;that which,&quot; but the &quot;that&quot; in 1 Corinthians and
the Prayer Book (and in Oxford and in Shakespeare) DOES mean &quot;that which.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; The wonder of it is that two men at roughly the same time

&gt;&gt; Oxford's letter is dated October 30, 1584. Shakespeare's *Sonnets* were
&gt;&gt; published in 1609. Some of them may have been written somewhat earlier,
&gt;&gt; but we cannot date that sonnet to within a generation of the time Oxford
&gt;&gt; wrote.

&gt; Some of them may have been written SOMEWHAT earlier? But Terry, you know
&gt; that they were.

"/>

We know some of them existed in the late 1590s-- Meres mentions
Shakespeare's &quot;sugared sonnets&quot; and two of them appeared in *The
Passionate Pilgrim* in 1599. I know of no scholar who dates Sonnet 121 to
the 1580s -- do you?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Besides, when I talk about roughly the same time, I mean around the turn
&gt; of the 17th century, as opposed to the 18th or 19th.

Twenty-five years passed between Oxford's letter and the publication of
Sonnet 121.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; both have the chutzpah, as we say in Jewish, to use God's words about
&gt;&gt;&gt; himself when referring to *themselves*. The arrogance of both men is
&gt;&gt;&gt; astonishing.

&gt;&gt; That Oxford was arrogant I grant you, but that he thought of himself or
&gt;&gt; wrote of himself as if he thought he were God is not something that you
&gt;&gt; have shown. What makes you think Oxford was quoting Exodus and not 1
&gt;&gt; Corinthians?

&gt; Does he say &quot;By the grace of God&quot; or something similar? Does Shakespeare?

"/>

Have you read Oxford's letter? Let me quote it once more.

&quot;My lord, this other day yowre man stainner towld me that yow sent for
Amis my man, and yf he wear absent that Lylle showld come vnto yow. I sent
Amis for he was in ye way. And I thinke very strange yat yowre Lordship
showld enter into that course towards me, wherby I must lerne yat I knev
[=knew] not before, bothe of yowre opinion and good will towards me. but I
pray, my lord, leaue yat course, for I mean not to be yowre ward nor yowre
chyld, I serve her magestie, and I am that I am, and by allyance neare to
yowre lordship, but fre, and scorne to be offred that iniurie, to thinke I
am so weake of gouernment as to be ruled by servants, or not able to
gouerne my self.&quot;

&quot;Lylle,&quot; of course, is John Lyly, whose riff on Exodus had appeared in
*Euphues* before he entered Oxford's service. Oxford whines that he has
only just now learned something about Burghley's &quot;opinion and good will
towards me&quot; -- and what he learned has hurt him, the poor little dear.
&quot;But I pray, my lord, leaue yat course, for I mean not to be yowre ward
nor yowre chyld&quot; -- ah, does that mean that Oxford is an entirely free
agent, a being self-created and self-governing? Read on: &quot;I serve her
magestie.&quot; Why do you ignore these words? &quot;I serve her magestie.&quot;
Oxford will not be Burghley's ward or Burghley's child, but he WILL be
whatever the queen wants him to be. &quot;I serve her magestie.&quot; This
statement of fealty occupies the same space as Paul's declaration of faith
in God:

I serve her magestie, and I am that I am,

But by the grace of God, I am that I am:

Oxford, of course, conveys nothing of Paul's submission to the divine
(although he could certainly have uttered the words); he is almost all
petulance. While acknowledging his submission to the queen, he does not
wish to be inferior to Burghley:

&quot;but I pray, my lord, leaue yat course, for I mean not to be yowre ward
nor yowre chyld, I serve her magestie, and I am that I am, and by allyance
neare to yowre lordship, but fre, and scorne to be offred that iniurie, to
thinke I am so weake of gouernment as to be ruled by servants, or not able
to gouerne my self.&quot;

So Oxford is what he is (subject to the queen's pleasure). He would like
to be free (subject to the queen's pleasure), rather than be &quot;ruled by
servants&quot; or &quot;not able to govern myself.&quot; ...

Just to mention the point, the reading for the epistle at Communion
would usually be from the same text as when the passage was read in
the Second Lesson at Morning or Evening Prayer. Since 1662 it has been
the KJV, but the Prayer Book never used unique translations of its
own; for example the Psalms in the 1662 book are from the Great Bible.
The KJV actually has &quot;I am what I am&quot;.

Before 1662 there was less of a standard, of course, and a particular
parson might choose a different text for the Lessons but still feel
obliged to use the prescribed version for the Epistle.

Tyndale (the ultimate source of all the other translations) has &quot;For I
am the lest off all the Apostles, which am nott worthy to be called an
apostle, because I persecuted the congregacioun of God: but by the
faveour of God I am that I am.&quot;

The Greek has &quot;chariti de Theou eimi ho eimi&quot; - it would be hard to
avoid &quot;I am what I am&quot;, though I would be tempted to begin &quot;but it is
by the grace of God that ...&quot;. The New English Bible has &quot;I am what I
am&quot;, as against Exodus 3.14 &quot;I AM; that is who I am&quot; in response to
Moses' request for a name.

&gt; ... Just to mention the point, the reading for the epistle at Communion
&gt; would usually be from the same text as when the passage was read in the
&gt; Second Lesson at Morning or Evening Prayer. Since 1662 it has been the
&gt; KJV, but the Prayer Book never used unique translations of its own; for
&gt; example the Psalms in the 1662 book are from the Great Bible. The KJV
&gt; actually has &quot;I am what I am&quot;.

"/>

The 1662 book and the 1611 KJV are, of course, too late to have influenced
Oxford's 1584 letter or Shakespeare's sonnets. The passage from 1
Corinthians in the 1549 prayer book (and later editions during Oxford's
and Shakespeare's lives) gives &quot;I am that I am.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Before 1662 there was less of a standard, of course, and a particular
&gt; parson might choose a different text for the Lessons but still feel
&gt; obliged to use the prescribed version for the Epistle.

"/>

There was a table of &quot;Proper Psalms and Lessons at Morning and Evening
Prayers&quot; in Elizabethan Prayer Books. The 1559 edition (in the Folger
edition edited by John Booty) lists Exodus 3 as the first lesson for
evening prayer for January 28, while 1 Corinthians 15 is the second lesson
for evening prayer on February 7, June 1, and September 30.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Tyndale (the ultimate source of all the other translations) has &quot;For I
&gt; am the lest off all the Apostles, which am nott worthy to be called an
&gt; apostle, because I persecuted the congregacioun of God: but by the
&gt; faveour of God I am that I am.&quot;

&gt; The Greek has &quot;chariti de Theou eimi ho eimi&quot; - it would be hard to
&gt; avoid &quot;I am what I am&quot;,

"/>

In the 16th Century, &quot;that&quot; was often used in the sense of &quot;that which&quot;;
while &quot;I am what I am&quot; would be hard to avoid for us, &quot;I am that I am&quot; was
a perfectly valid Elizabethan equivalent.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; though I would be tempted to begin &quot;but it is by the grace of God that
&gt; ...&quot;. The New English Bible has &quot;I am what I am&quot;, as against Exodus 3.14
&gt;&quot;I AM; that is who I am&quot; in response to Moses' request for a name.

"/>

The language has shifted in many ways since the 16th Century, and
translators today are not likely to translate the Exodus phrase and that
in 1 Corinthians using the same words, since the meaning is different --
but in the Prayer Book that Oxford and Shakespeare would have known, and
in many of the Bible translations before KJV, we find Paul saying &quot;I am
that I am.&quot;

This has not turned up on my server at all, Terry. I've just found it
here and will respond to a little of it before going to bed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is really in response to both your emails:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, we've been stewing over the Hebrew in 3.14. One of the problems is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that there are no vowels, However, it appears that *in the Hebrew* God
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; says something to the effect of &quot;I will be who I will be.&quot; It's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting that in the English translations the line is rendered in(to)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the present tense, usually &quot;I am that I am,&quot; or &quot;I am who I am.&quot; Perhaps
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this makes it appear, at least on the surface, a bit more decipherable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To me it is a conundrum. Although you suggest that the sentence tells us
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that God is that which exists by definition, I think the meaning of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence, rather like the essence of God, is deliberately unknowable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's a theological point open (obviously) to dispute.

&gt;&gt; Well. I'd prefer to say obviously open to *discussion*; however, please
&gt;&gt; note I was merely giving my own opinion on it.

&gt; That claim that God's essence WAS his existence was a Christian
&gt; commonplace, and still has its adherents.

"/>

It's a very fancy sentence, but I'm afraid I'm too stupid to
understand what it really means. I tend to think it's unexplainable,
but perhaps you could have a go.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And therefore I'd have to say that the same is true, to some extent,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when Oxford and Shakespeare use the sentence about themselves.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But they don't. They do not say, simpliciter, &quot;I am that I am.&quot; In each
&gt;&gt;&gt; case, the words are part of a longer sentence, and in neither case does
&gt;&gt;&gt; the context support the reading that either person intends his reader to
&gt;&gt;&gt; take him for God. In Oxford's case, the words are part of a complaint
&gt;&gt;&gt; that while he is the queen's creature, he does not with to be treated as
&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley's. Can you imagine the God of Moses saying, &quot;if it's OK with the
&gt;&gt;&gt; pharaoh, I am that I am&quot;?

&gt;&gt; No, Terry, I can't; however,

&gt; The queen for Oxford occupies the role that neither the pharaoh nor any
&gt; other mortal occupies for the God of Moses.

&gt;&gt; I would say this is a larger issue than whether it's part of a longer
&gt;&gt; sentence, that issue being that both Oxford (from a study of his Geneva)

&gt; He certainly owned a Geneva Bible, and I do hope he studied it.

"/>

I do believe he did. Shakespeare did, in any case, whoever he was.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; and Shakespeare (from a study of the sonnets and plays) seem well versed
&gt;&gt; in the Bible, not unusual at the time, and therefore, when they use
&gt;&gt; these words we can be reasonably sure they are alluding to Ex 3.14.

&gt; We can be reasonably sure in each case that the author was alluding
&gt; (perhaps also alluding) to 1 Corinthians 15.10.

"/>

Perhaps also alluding. But the source of Corinthians is perhaps Ex
3.14. In any case, it appears to be in the Geneva, where the wording
is the same. So we might conclude that the source of the Shakespeare
and the Oxford is Exodus, and perhaps, but not necessarily, also
Corinth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; One assumes they also knew that &quot;I am that I am&quot; is somehow tied to
&gt;&gt; YHWH.

&gt; They might have associated the Tetragramaton with &quot;LORD.&quot;

"/>

I know it as Tetragrammaton; however, yes, it is associated with
adonai or (my)Lord, referring to God.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; You should not forget that the words are used in 1 Corinthians (where Paul
&gt; does NOT claim to be God)

"/>

I think he claims to have God's essence by the grace of God.

and that both Oxford and Shakespeare, as well as

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; a great many contemporaries, used &quot;that&quot; in the sense of &quot;that which.&quot;

"/>

Yes. As did Exodus. &quot;I am that I am&quot; can no doubt be further broken
down into &quot;I am that which I am.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We can be reasonably sure that Shakespeare knew *Euphues* (as Oxford may
&gt; well have been) as well as Exodus, 1 Corinthians, and the Book of Common
&gt; Prayer, and he could also have been familiar with Melbancke and even with
&gt; the story of John Knox's dying words.

"/>

Possibly.

The phrase &quot;I am that I am&quot; was

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; common; everybody who went to church would have heard it every year.

"/>

Yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Thus, they used it in respect to themselves while fully understanding
&gt;&gt; its greater implications. It's not as if they chose by accident the
&gt;&gt; words of God. They knew what they were doing. They used the exact text
&gt;&gt; of the Geneva.

&gt; They are using the exact text of Exodus, of 1 Corinthians, of the Prayer
&gt; Book, of Lyly, of Melbancke, of Knox.

"/>

But unlike Lyly, or Melbanke, or (possibly) Knox, they had the
temerity to use it when speaking of themselves.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We think we know what it means, we believe we have some grasp of it, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's a delusion.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A mystery, perhaps, but hardly a delusion.

&gt;&gt; Well, I would agree it's a mystery, but if we really think we know what
&gt;&gt; it means, then we are deluded. Jewish scholars have been arguing over
&gt;&gt; the Hebrew for many, many years. Since they don't agree with one
&gt;&gt; another, I would say we probably can't say with any certainty what was
&gt;&gt; meant.

&gt; There is no reason to believe that either Oxford or Shakespeare was a
&gt; Hebrew scholar. Their understanding of Exodus would have been Christian.
&gt; Whether they read scriptures in English or Latin, they would have
&gt; understood the difference between the words in Exodus and the words in 1
&gt; Corinthians.

"/>

Um, I'm not sure about Oxford. He may well have learned Hebrew, I
believe from his tutor, and Shakespeare (whoever he was) perhaps got
the names of Iessica and Shiloch from the Torah. They do not appear in
the same form in English.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They are consciously copying God or God through St. Paul, and what God
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; says is really not definable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You have not dealt with the difference between the use in Exodus and that
&gt;&gt;&gt; in 1 Corinthians. Paul is NOT claiming to be God. There are expressions
&gt;&gt;&gt; that are taken as echoes of God's claim in the New Testament, but they are
&gt;&gt;&gt; given to Jesus.

&gt;&gt; Paul is definitely not claiming to be God, but I would say that he feels
&gt;&gt; inspired by the *spirit* and *grace* of God and therefore he can make the
&gt;&gt; same statement.

&gt; It is NOT the same statement. Paul is NOT saying &quot;because I have faith I
&gt; am God.&quot; He is saying that he what he is not through his own efforts, but
&gt; by God's grace -- this is not the same thing as saying that his own
&gt; essence is his existence.

"/>

It is the same statement in the Geneva. Whether it has been tailored
to be the same statement is of no matter. Both God and Paul say &quot;I am
that I am,&quot; although Paul is able to say it by the grace of God.
Whether the statements MEAN the same thing or not, which I imagine is
where you're going, is arguable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; There is something else. The two statements, in Ex and Corinth, were
&gt;&gt; written in different languages.

&gt; This is true -- but the Greek-reading Jewish community of Paul's time
&gt; would have known the Septuagint.

"/>

A confusing word but yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; One could argue that Paul was not actually quoting God.

&gt; This is what I have been trying to tell you. This is one reason why in
&gt; most translations Paul's words are different from those in Exodus. We do
&gt; not find a note in the Geneva that directs us to read Paul's words as an
&gt; echo or fulfilment in any way of Exodus.

"/>

I see where you're going now. Sorry to be so thick. We're saying two
different things. I'm saying that Paul may not actually be quoting God
because the meaning of the texts might differ in the original
languages. You're saying that Paul was not actually quoting God,
therefore he did not see himself as God, therefore Shakespeare and
Oxford were quoting Corinthians rather than Exodus, therefore they
weren't likening themselves to God either. Ha. I call that sleight of
hand. And some other things. Better left unprinted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Are we sure, for example, that as a non-Jew he knew the OT very well?

&gt; He was a Jew. He knew his OT, and he believed that Jesus was the Messiah
&gt; foretold of old.

"/>

Yes, sorry, I've already been through this with David. My mind is
working remarkably slowly lately. And I'm having difficulty thinking
and writing in this little box. This is not the time to get into the
difference between what the Jews believed the messiah to be, and what
the Christians believed him to be, a change that may have begun with
Paul, but perhaps we can talk about it another time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; (I'm really not certain of this. Just throwing the question out because
&gt;&gt; it seems possible to me that the translations were made to agree.)

&gt; I don't know that that is what happened. What may be more likely is that
&gt; we have a coincidence -- a coincidence made possible by the fact that in
&gt; the 16th Century, &quot;that&quot; was often used to mean &quot;that which.&quot; The &quot;that&quot;
&gt; in Exodus does not mean &quot;that which,&quot; but the &quot;that&quot; in 1 Corinthians and
&gt; the Prayer Book (and in Oxford and in Shakespeare) DOES mean &quot;that which.&quot;

"/>

But Terry, how can you tell? It's remarkable to me that you make these
distinctions with such confidence, especially after I've suggested
that the actual Hebrew in Exodus bears little resemblance to &quot;I am
that (which?) I am&quot; in the first place. It seems to me that you're
making such statements because you wish to believe they're so, not
because they are so. By the way, I checked this with an Israeli
yesterday. She also said the words in the original are closer to &quot;I
will be what I will be.&quot; It's a mystery.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The wonder of it is that two men at roughly the same time

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford's letter is dated October 30, 1584. Shakespeare's *Sonnets* were
&gt;&gt;&gt; published in 1609. Some of them may have been written somewhat earlier,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but we cannot date that sonnet to
