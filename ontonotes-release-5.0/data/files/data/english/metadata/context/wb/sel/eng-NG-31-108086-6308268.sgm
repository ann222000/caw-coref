Contest organizers are increasingly putting contest info and entry
forms on line.  This is great, as it allows competitors to fill out
entry forms before hand, instead of doing it in line at registration.
Since most contests have seperate sheets for each model, this can be
quite time consuming.

However, to ease the effort on the competitor's part, the file type
which is provided online is important.  I see commonly three file types
these forms are provided in: pdf, jpeg, and .doc.

Most of us do not have the software to EDIT pdf forms.  Jpegs are by
nature uneditable.  What this means is that we have to print out the
number of blank forms needed, and fill out ALL required info each time.

On the other hand, a word processing format such as .doc CAN be edited
by virtually everyone with a computer.  Almost any word processor these
days, even Wordpad that comes with Windows, can edit a .doc format
document.  That means we can edit the forms to put in our names,
addresses and such that are needed on each form.  Then we can print out
the number needed and only have to fill in the model info, which is
usually different on each one anyway.

Thus, I recommend that contest organizers do their entry forms in .doc
and place these on line, rather than jpeg or pdf versions.

There are great difficulties in using the .doc format if it's come from
Microsoft Word of a later version that the version that the user might
have.  For instance, I still have Word 95 for Windows and it works fine
for me but if I click on a .doc file which will of course be for a later
version, my Word tries to open it and it crashes with the dreaded
'unrecoverable error' window with only the 'ok' button to get me out of it.

Another version might be an online form that the user can partly fill
then return to at some later date, to complete.  This is already being
done with the Brit's favourite friend, the Inland Revenue!  Sadly, I've
not won anything from them but that would be a great idea.

May I suggest ".rtf" format? Rich Text Format will work with
more word processors than ".doc", which includes various versions
of windoze turd, errr, word.

".rtf" also works with StarOffice, OpenOffice, O'sucks TextEdit
and I would hope, but have not tried, some of the "online" word
processors from Google et. al.

And, yeah, word will treat it like a .doc file when it see
it.

I am a bit horrified with the blase attitude that people take to
document formats. Using a binary format like .doc is simply stupid if
one wishes it to be portable. This format changes version to version,
and there is no easy way to see the contents with simple text editors
and other word processors (which can all do the job of a text editor
in at least opening and saving simple text files). So for a portable
format with complex formatting allowed, one needs to take a standard,
which may change but does so transparently, for instance XML. This is
what future Microsoft .doc formats may use (but still with binary
extensions to make it harder to see what is going on there), but
OpenOffice.org and various other applications all over the web (not
only for human-readable documents, but also for applications to talk
to one another, since if a XML-reader and writer is standardized it is
reliably useful to all programs in the operating system).

In the absence of the need for formatting, one can always use simple
text (save as text file, not as .rtf or .doc).

It only takes one unhappy experience with not being able to read a
binary document to realize the truth of what I am writing.

(the same goes for Usenet: when people post HTML here by accident or
through ignorance, that is annoying, but not nearly as annoying as not
being able to see anything legible at all in a document)

This is an interesting discussion.  I have two thoughts I'd like to throw
out here.

While it is true that most people do not have the software to edit a PDF,
you can create a form in PDF format that allows the user to enter
information.  You just cannot save the data.  But this would still work
for the scenario where you had multiple entries.  You'd could do one of
two things.  Fill out the common info, print multiple copies, and fill
the rest of the information by hand.  Or fill out all the information,
print the form, enter the info for the next entry, print, and so on.

Second, .DOC format, aside from the backward compatibilty issue (which
.PDF shares to a small degree), introduces a major security hole.  Could
you imagine the fun Dennis would have if the IPMS should happen to
distribute a .DOC form with a virus?  I have heard of a number of viruses
spread thru word documents.  I have yet to hear of one spread thru a PDF
file.

Try Open Office

It is freeware, and works under Winbloz, or Linux

You can edit, and make PDF's no problem.

Excellent advice! I am not sure if you meant this one, but if so then
please call it "OpenOffice.org", since Open Office is a trademarked
set of software packages and is somewhat different.

O'sucks (OS X) TextEdit can. If anybody is still running
