I know that a first batch should have been a short mead, but I prefer
to stay natural and "pure". I didn't want anything but honey, water,
yeast and nutrient. I now know that I probably should use beer yeasts,
instead of wine or mead yeasts, since I prefer a very sweet mead. It
would have also allowed for a shorter brew and aging period, since
newbees are usually rather impatient, which I know I am.

Here is the basics from my notes:

2007.01.07
15 lbs honey (clover) fill to 5 gallons with spring water
OG: 1.107
Whitelabs sweat mead liquid yeast.
Yeast nutrient.

--------------------------

2007.01.08
here we are nearly 24 hours after pitching the yeast...
I can get a nice head of foam by aerating vigorously, but on it's
own.. nothing much happens....

sooo.. in with the second vial of yeast, and another capsule of
nutrient.

current sg is 1.102.
((1.100 @ 73F on a 60F hydrometer))

----------------------------

2007.01.10
ok, so at 5:39ish this morning (I edited the time of this post to
represent time of racking) I racked the sluggish must to teh secondary
fermenter, the glass carboy.

SG at this time was 1.098 @ 74.3F or 1.1 after adjusting for the 60F
calibration on my hydrometer.

Probably still a bit high for going secondary, but I wanted to reduce
chances for bacterial infection by closing it off to oxygen.

The taste right now is almost exactly want I want as far as sweetness
goes (so I'll probably end up more dry than I would prefer, or I will
add more honey later)... but it still has a rather yeasty bite. The
smell reminds me of a cross between mead and bread or beer... which I
take as a good sign. It is also still nicely carbonated, so
fermentation is still proceeding, albeit slowly.

The airlock is bubbling every 3 or 4 seconds (roughly).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From here, I'll simply let it sit until I notice a build up of lees.

--------------------------

2007.01.29
I racked the mead off the lees, and did a hydrometer test. SG: 1.04
which puts the mead at a yummy 8% ABV.. the flavor is still good, the
alcohol is starting to show more and it is still bubbly so it leaves a
slight bite on the tongue...

the air lock is bubbling roughly every 10 seconds, so still have a bit
of good fermentation left.

I was gonna save the lees to do something with, but ended up spilling
them all over the floor accidentally... oh well.... maybe the next
racking.. or before bottling.

I figure I'll check in on it once a week or so, until I can see a
decent amount of sediment, or bubbling stops, whichever comes first.
Then I'll rack it again.

--------------------------

2007.02.04
bubbles every 15 secs.
SG: 1.030
ABV:10.11%

taste is already very well on it's way to dry.
I think I'll add another few pounds of honey and some spring water....

I may halt fermentation chemically about week or so after I add the
honey.

I also need to look into chemical clarifying.

I really wanted to stay natural with this, but I think I may have
detected a hint of vinegaring, so I want to get this in a drinkable
state asap.

--------------------------

2007.02.11
Ok, so this may well be a mistake, since it will take a little while
to acquire the sorbate and clarifying agents...
Buuuut...
When I tasted it the other day and it seemed rather dry/alcoholic but
at only 10% ABV.... I decided to add another 1 gallon of water with 5
lbs o honey.

SG before sweetening: 1.024 (10.89% ABV)
SG after sweetening: 1.050 (unknown ABV.. ~7.5%? I don't know if the
calculations would be the same or not...)

Taste after degassing a sample was great, the alcohol punch was still
there, but it was almost as sweet as the good professional meads I've
tried.

--------------------------

2007.02.18
SG: 1.040

Still no idea on the adjusted SG, or the ABV.

Flavour is nicely sweet (I like a sweeter mead, not a dry one.)

kinda acidic.. almost lemony

a bit tangy on the tongue, slight "bubble sting" (to be expected, the
airlock is still kicking every few seconds -- didn't count though)

still quite cloudy, with a fine layer of sediment that looks about 3"
deep, until you realize that it's not straight across, more like
growing up the sides.

All in all, I would have no problem drinking the whole thing right
now.... except that would be way too much in one sitting ;)

I need to get some stabilizers and clarifying agents, pronto... I'm
getting both impatient and nervous.

--------------------------

2007.02.24
I racked a single bottle off the top, and tested the SG, still 1.040,
but still bubbling every 10-15 seconds (roughly).
I shared the bottle with a couple of friends who were not of very much
help with verifying the taste quality.
It has a strong taste of alcohol, but is also nicely sweet, so I'm
hoping aging it will help with that. They did help me finish the whole
bottle and asked for a bottle of their own when it is all done, so I
suppose it can't be all bad. I had thought I noticed an off odor in
the initial sample I used for testing the SG.... but the bottle showed
no signs of any off odor by the time a couple of hours had passed.

--------------------------

Sooooo.... what advice do the wizened folk of this group think I
should do from here. Please keep in mind that unless it endangers the
mead, I would prefer to stay away from chemical additives. I also have
no LHBS, so I have to order everything related to brewing and mazing
online.

Thanks guys.. I've followed this list for a few months and have seen
much sage advice, I guess it is just time that I finally decided to
ask for some of it.

Yeah man, RELAX, SLOW DOWN!!!!!!!!! I can't believe you're drinking less
than 2 months after pitching the yeast. Mead fermentations are notorious for
being long &amp; slow. Let it finish, then stabilize &amp; sweeten to taste
(probably sometime in the Fall or early Winter). Rack it only when you see a
build up of the lees. Patience is a virtue &amp; is required in meadmaking.

I agree, step back a bit.  Steve is right.  Mead is usually, but not always,
slower than wine.  You said you would stop it chemically.  Easier said than
done.  I know of no reliable chemical meas of stopping a mead mid ferment.
You can probably put it in a freezer and chill it down to stop ferment,
Keep it there untill it clears and you can rack the mead off the sediment.
Do not freeze.  That is fine if you have the freezer space.  I find that
freezer space tends to get filled, however much I have.

What you are probably refering to is using sorbate to stabilize the mead.
This will not stop a ferment.  It will stop reproduction so you can clear
the mead which removes almost all the yeast and then treat it so the little
bit of yeast left will not grow back to a viable colony but it will not stop
an active ferment.  If you do not have adequate freezer space, then your
best bet is to let it ferment till it stops and then clear it and stabilize
it.  Then sweeten to taste.

You started with a high SG so this is probably going to take a while to
mellow out.  If you want an early drinking mead you should probably shoot
for a low alcohol level.  10.5 to 11.5 %.  Make it dry at that level, clear
it and sweeten it.  It will probably mellow out in less than a year.
