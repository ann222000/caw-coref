Actually the claims you have made concerning NT scripture and the apostle
Paul have long been refuted and are old falsehoods. If anything, people like
you trying to claim portions of scripture to be fraudulent when they are not
are ones who are trying to disrupt and destroy the church. The scriptures
currently in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation including those epistles
from Paul are canon and are God's message to Christians.

May God bless,

Paul, considered himself an apostle of the Messiah but when we look
into his writing we find that in many instances where he is in direct
conflict with himself, the Messiah and the Old Testament.  So, in that
I have come to have issues with some of his writings, it's time I
consider his stands and lay them out.

Rev 2:2 &quot;I know your works, and your labour, and your endurance, and
that you are not able to bear evil ones, and have tried those who say
they are emissaries and are not, and have found them false;

Luke (not the disciple) records in Acts that Paul is a Roman Pharisee
from Tarsos, in Kilikia.

Conflict #1  -  Knowing the Torah.
Joh 7:49 &quot;But this crowd that does not know the Torah is accursed.&quot;

In John we read that those that don't know the Torah are cursed and
Paul conflict in saying that anybody &quot;of the works&quot; is cursed.

Gal 3:10 For as many as are of works of Torah are under the curse, for
it has been written, &quot;Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all
that has been written in the book of the Torah, to do them.&quot;

Conflict #2 Cursing
Gal 1:8 However, even if we, or a messenger out of heaven, bring a
'Good News' to you beside what we announced to you, let him be
accursed.
Gal 1:9 As we have said before, and now I say again, if anyone brings
a 'Good News' to you beside what you have received, let him be
accursed.

He conflicts first off with himself here by what he said to the
Romans,

Rom 12:14 Bless those who persecute you - bless and do not curse.

So he curses &quot;anyone&quot; in Galatians but tells the Romans not to curse.
In James we read,

Jas 3:9  Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse
we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
Jas 3:10  Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
brethren, these things ought not so to be.

Conflict # 3 Circumcision &quot;different 'Good News,'&quot;

Gal 5:2  Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised,
Christ shall profit you nothing.

For himself? It should also be noted that he circumcised Timothy in
the book of Acts.

Php 3:5  Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of  the
tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a
Pharisee;

I didn't notice this before but he says if you are circumcised you
should cut your Penis off and says that the sacrifice on the cross is
an &quot;offense&quot;.

Gal 5:11  And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased.
Gal 5:12  I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

I don't believe he ever cut off his own and he certainly never spoke
of it.  In his self aggrandizing style I'm sure he would have &quot;humbly&quot;
told us.

Conflict #4 - Judge before saints

1Co 6:1  Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law
before the unjust, and not before the saints?
1Co 6:7  Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye
go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye
not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

In the book of Acts He is asked if he will go before Jerusalem to be
judged in the temple.  Did he practice what he preached?  Note: At the
time, Nero was Caesar.

Act 25:9  But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered
Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of
these things before me?
Act 25:10  Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I
ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very
well knowest.

What happened to his earlier account?  He said,
Act 21:13  Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at
Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

Some might say this was a smart move but by his own actions we find he
pays the price for telling lies.

Conflict #5 - Why he was brought to Trial.
It's also interesting that it is recorded in Acts that he lies about
why he was brought to trial.
Why was he brought to trial?
Act 21:21  And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the
Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they
ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the
customs.

While in the trial he tells a lie and causes an uproar.

Act 23:6 Now Sha'ul, perceiving that one part were Sadducees and the
other Pharisees, cried out in the council, &quot;Men, brothers, I am a
Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee, I am being judged concerning the
expectation and resurrection of the dead!&quot;

The result was Roman commander bringing him safely out.

Act 23:10 And a great dissension having come, the commander, fearing
lest Sha'ul would be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the body of
soldiers to go down and seize him from their midst, and bring him into
the barracks.

Why, just before the trial
Act 22:29 Then at once those who were about to examine him withdrew
from him. And the commander was also afraid after he found out that he
was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

Conflict # 6 The results of his trail

&quot;Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the
Gentiles who are turning to God, but that we write to them to abstain
from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from things
strangled, and from blood. For Moses has had throughout many
generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the
synagogues every Sabbath.&quot;               Acts 15:19-21   NKJV

What he told the Galatians was very different.

Gal 2:10  Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same
which I also was forward to do.

Conflict # 7 Can Men be righteous?

Gen 6:9 This is the genealogy of Noah . Noah  was a righteous man,
perfect in his generations. Noah  walked with Elohim.
Vs
Rom 3:10  As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

Ironically, it isn't written anywhere.

Conflict #8 He robbed churches.

Exo 20:15  Thou shalt not steal.
Vs.
2Co 11:8  I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you
service.

Conflict #9 His account of Jesus on the road to Damascus.
Recorded three times in the book of Acts are 3 accounts of the same
journey to Damascus.
Act 9:6  And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou
have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the
city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
Act 9:7  And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless,
hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
Act 9:8  And Saul arose from the earth;

On the other occasion...

Act 22:10  And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto
me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of
all things which are appointed for thee to do.
Act 22:11  And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being
led by the hand of them that were with me,
Instead of being told to go to &quot;the city&quot; he is now told go to
Damascus.

And the third time is completely different, No longer being told to
&quot;go&quot; somewhere&quot; he's told on the spot.  Now I think if Jesus came to
me and stopped me on the road in a &quot;blinding&quot; light,  I'd remember
what he said.  But since he's at the end of his rope on lies here he
tells King Agripa that he's to be &quot;delivered from the people and from
gentiles&quot;.  I thought he was the apostle of the gentiles.

Act 26:16  But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto
thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of
these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I
will appear unto thee;
Act 26:17  Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles,
unto whom now I send thee,
Act 26:18  To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to
light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive
forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified
by faith that is in me.

I'm sure I'll find more as I go along, this is just what I found
today.  I find it interesting that Acts starts with the Apostles
recieving the set apart Spirit of Elohim and we are given a witness by
a Roman Pharisee that is working for the same cheif preist that just
had the Messiah killed.  Was Paul a spy set in from the beginning to
disrupt and destroy the church?

His writing certainly have been the cause of a LOT of anti-semitism
and a lot of &quot;Christians&quot; boasting about grace without the law.  I'll
be posting more on this as I find more lies and errors but suffice to
say, it's evidence enough for me.

More Conflicts in scriptures, we See in Ephesians he was soundly
rejected and then later the Messiah spoke of him in Revelations.

Inconsistent accounts of Saul's conversion:

Acts 9:7

And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a
voice, but seeing no man.

Acts 22:9

And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but
they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.

The argument:

2 Peter 3:14-16

14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and
blameless. 15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is
salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the
wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; 16 As also in all his
epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things
hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable
wrest, as

1Co 6:11  And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
sanctified, (but ye are justified) in the name of the Lord Jesus, and
by (the Spirit of our God).
1Co 6:12  (All things are lawful unto me), but all things are not
expedient: (all things are lawful for me), but (I will NOT be brought
under the POWER OF ANY).
1Co 6:13  Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall
destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, (but
for the Lord); and the Lord for the body.

Does anybody else not here Satan himself speaking in the pages of the
New Testament? Didn't he just say you could fornicate for the Lord?
The apostle will &quot;not be brought under the power of any?

Every verse he wrote contridicts although subtly, perverts the
doctrine of Jesus.  On several occasions he says that Christ is dead.
He calls circumcision a &quot;mutalation&quot; and says if you recieve it,
Christ is &quot;dead in vain&quot;.

He calls the Old Testament, &quot;Jewish Fables&quot; and claims he is above
the
apostles of Christ and claims... allow me to show you by adding
quotes
and capitols.

2Co 12:7  And lest (I should be exalted) above measure through the
abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the
flesh, (the messenger of Satan) to buffet me, lest I should be
exalted
above measure.
2Co 12:8  For this thing I (besought the Lord thrice), that it (might
depart from me).
2Co 12:9  And he said unto me, MY GRACE is sufficient for thee: for
MY
STRENGH is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I
rather glory in my infirmities, that the POWER of Christ may REST
UPON
ME.
2Co 12:10  Therefore I take (pleasure in infirmities), in reproaches,
in necessities, in persecutions, (in distresses for Christ's sake):
for when I am weak, then am I strong.

His double speak can be read two ways.  Did he ask that Satan depart
or the Jesus?.. he says IT leaving it open.  He doesn't say the Grace
of Jesus or the Power of Jesus or the Strengh of Jesus.  He says, the
power of Christ rest upon HIM.

2Co 12:16  But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless,( being
crafty,) I caught you with guile.

Jesus wasn't &quot;crafty&quot; and beguile us.  Paul hated circumcision and
had
many evil things to say about it...

Gal 5:4  Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
Php 3:2  Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out
for those who mutilate the flesh.
Gal 2:21  I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness
come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

He says Christ is Dead in Vain!  Not died or sacrificed in vain..
DEAD!
Paul says....
Col 3:3  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.

Jesus says...
Joh 10:10  The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and
to
destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might
have
it more abundantly.

Who is the thief?
2Co 11:8  I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you
service.

In Revelations 2 it clearly speaks of Paul.

Rev 2:2  I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how
thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them
which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:

Rev 2:9  I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou
art
rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and
are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
Rev 2:14  But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast
there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast
a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things
sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.
Rev 2:15  So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.

Paul says....
1Co 5:1  (It is reported) commonly that there is fornication among
you, and such (fornication as is not so much) as named among the
Gentiles, that (one should have his father's wife).

1Co 5:5  To deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the
flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

An apostle of Jesus calling for people to be delivered to SATAN?  He
never simply says, DON&quot;T FORNICATE.

1Co 5:11  But now I have written unto you (not to keep company), (if
any man that is called a brother) be a fornicator, or covetous, or an
idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; (with such a
one no not to eat).

So do we not it with the fornicator or with the man that is called a
brother?

1Co 6:9  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the
kingdom of God?

Notice the double NOT that cancel each other out.  He could have
said,

Now watch this cool trick...

NOR, connective. [ne and or.]
NEITHER, n. [Compound pronoun, pronominal adjective, or a substitute,
and not either, or not other.

Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
1Co 6:10  Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

He is a crafty one because What he says is... and not either
FORNICATORS AND IDOLATERS or ADULTERERS AND EFFEMINATE ...AND
EXTORTIONERS, SHALL inerit the kingdom....

He uses very cleaver double speak in all of his scriptures!

Luk 11:17  But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every
kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house
divided against a house falleth.

Those are the words of the Messiah Yeshua and in every bible today is
the trojan horse of the Christian church.

Gal 2:7  But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the
uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the
circumcision was unto Peter;

The 13th apostle, Paul, claimed he had, &quot;the gospel of the
uncircumcision&quot;, but what is it?  What are the tenant of this other
gospel hidden inside of your bible?  Today we have dozens of different
denominations of Christian church's and different translations of the
same text of scriptures but why?  All of the differences between
church's that use only the Torah and the Prophets and the New
Testament can be traced to the Trojan horse the false Apostle Paul.

Whether the reader believe in 1, 2, 10 or 613 commandments from our
Creator, the differences are sourced in Paul.  Paul preached only 1
Commandment, the Messiah concluded that you can sum up the entire
Torah (5 books of Moses) in 2 Commandments, our very literal brothers
of Judaism believe 613 commandments and of course we have the 10
commandments given on Mt. Sinai.

Now some believe Paul was for the Law and some believe Paul was
against the law and quote things like:
Rom 10:4  For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
one that believeth.
Col 2:14  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against
us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it
to his cross;

Good for them I say.  I will not argue this point at all because where
I'm going is to the real doctrine of the &quot;uncircumcision&quot;.  Paul was
definitely against the practice and made some very outlandish quotes
for us such as:
Php 3:2  Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the
concision.
Gal 5:2  Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised,
Christ shall profit you nothing.

Why was he so against the practice?  One of the most interesting and
telling quotes of Paul is:

1Co 6:12  All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not
expedient: all things are lawful for me, but (I will not be brought
under the power of any).
1Co 6:13  Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall
destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for
the Lord; and the Lord for the body.

Now keep that quote in mind as we jump to the Revelation of John:
Rev 2:1  Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; ...
Rev 2:2  I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how
thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them
which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:

Now we look into Ephesus and here we find the book,
Eph 1:1  Paul, an apostle

O.K. that's not looking to good but it must be another apostle,
right?  What else did the Messiah say?
Mat 16:18  And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon
this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
prevail against it.

Alright, so Peter is the Rock of our church, did he say anything about
Paul to support him?
2Pe 3:15  ...even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the
wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
2Pe 3:16  ... all his epistles,...some things hard to be understood, which
they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other
Scriptures, unto their own destruction.
2Pe 3:17  ...beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the
wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.

Error of the wicked? Led away?  Beware?  Wow. But he does call him
brother.  Oh wait,
1Pe 2:17  Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the
king.
He calls everybody brother, does he say any more?  Paul isn't named
again personally but we do find one of Paul's closest allies:

1Pe 5:12  By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I
have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true
grace of God wherein ye stand.
1Pe 5:13  The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son.

The church that is Babylon?  Isn't that spoken of in Revelations?
Rev 17:5  And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON
THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

Wait, am I sure about Silvanus?
2Th 1:1  Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the
Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

Wait, what other proof is there, this is the bible and he's an apostle
were talking about.. because your trying to tell me Paul is the church
of Babylon?  O.K. let's go back to Revelations, What church is next?
Smyrna, that was located just north of Ephesus and it's church is not
written about in any other scripture but it says:

Rev 2:8  And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These
things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;
Rev 2:9  I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art
rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and
are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

Well Paul was a Jew, right.  Let's see what Paul says:
1Co 9:20  And unto the Jews (I became as a Jew), that I might gain the
Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might
gain them that are under the law;
Act 21:37  And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak
Greek?
Act 21:38  Art not thou that (Egyptian), which before these days
madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand
men that were murderers?
Act 22:27 And having come, the commander said to him, &quot;Say to me, are
you a Roman?&quot; And he said, &quot;Yes.&quot;
Gal 2:15  We who are (Jews by nature)
2Co 11:22  Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I.
Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
Php 3:5  Circumcised the eighth day, of the (stock of Israel), of the
tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a
Pharisee;
Act 21:39  But Paul said, I am a man which am a (Jew of Tarsus), a
city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city:

Now wait, how can he be &quot;of the stock of Israel&quot; and also a Roman
Pharisee from Tarsus that spoke Greek?
Act 15:23  And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The
apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which
are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.

So they are Gentiles in Cilicia.
Act 6:9  Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called
the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and
of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.

The synagogue of the Libertines? Now that's the only mention of them
in the entire scripture. Now this must have been the synagogue that
Paul was trained at.  What happened to Stephen?
Act 6:13  And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not
to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
Act 7:59  And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
Jesus, receive my spirit.
Act 22:20  And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also
was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment
of them that slew him.

And here is the birth of Paul from the gentile synagogue of the
Libertines.  So he wasn't a Jew at all except, &quot;by nature&quot;.  O.K. so
what happened next?  We all know that Saul admitted he was a murderer.
What next?

Act 8:2  And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
lamentation over him.
Act 9:1  And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter
against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
Act 9:2  And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues,
that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he
might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
Act 8:3  As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every
house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.

So we see that they returned Stephen to Jerusalem, to the high priest
and Paul was hired by the very same high Priest that just murdered the
Messiah, Caiaphas.
Mat 26:57  And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to
Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
assembled.
Act 4:6  And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and
Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were
gathered together at Jerusalem.

He got a commission to go kill the church of the Messiah and went out
for that infamous trip to Damascus synagogues.  What happened?

Recorded three times in the book of Acts are 3 accounts of the same
journey to Damascus.
Act 9:6  And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou
have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the
city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
Act 9:7  And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless,
hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
Act 9:8  And Saul arose from the earth;

Notice the men heard the voice but On the other occasion they didn't...
Act 22:9  And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were
afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
Act 22:10  And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto
me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of
all things which are appointed for thee to do.
Act 22:11  And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being
led by the hand of them that were with me,
Instead of being told to go to &quot;the city&quot; he is now told go to
Damascus.

And the third time is completely different, No longer being told to
&quot;go&quot; somewhere&quot; he's told on the spot.  Now I think if Jesus came to
me and stopped me on the road in a &quot;blinding&quot; light,  I'd remember
what he said.  But since he's at the end of his rope on lies here he

It's not the Torah.  It's the Law from the Greek nomos; not the Hebrew
Torah.  The NT is in Greek not Hebrew.  God knows how to use His words
correctly.  He had the NT written in Greek, not Hebrew, for a reason.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;it has been written, &quot;Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all
&gt;that has been written in the book of the Torah, to do them.&quot;

You do not read too good.  It is speaking of those who don't do the
Law who are under it.  The Law was written to Israel; not the Gentiles
or the church of God.  Thee are three classifications of pople in the
Bible; Jews Gentiles, and church of God.  When a Jew or Gentile
becomes a member sof the chruch of God; he is not subject to the Law.
There is no contradiction; God has differnet rules for different
groups of people.  Again, the Law is not applicable to Gentiles or the
church of God.  It is applicable to Israel; except the smart ones that
get saved and become members of the chruch of God like Paul did.

Out of context quote.  The words were supplied by God via revelation
of Jesus Christ:

Gal 1:3-12 KJV
3  Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord
Jesus Christ,
4  Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this
present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:
5  To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
6  I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into
the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
7  Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would
pervert the gospel of Christ.
8  But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be
accursed.
9  As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other
gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
10  For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for
if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
11  But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of
me is not after man.
12  For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by
the revelation of Jesus Christ.

God through Christ through Paul is speaking to the church of God; not
Israel.  There is no contradiction.

&gt;Conflict # 3 Circumcision &quot;different 'Good News,'&quot;

&gt;Gal 5:2  Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised,
&gt;Christ shall profit you nothing.

&gt;For himself? It should also be noted that he circumcised Timothy in
&gt;the book of Acts.

&gt;Php 3:5  Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of  the
&gt;tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a
&gt;Pharisee;

&gt;I didn't notice this before but he says if you are circumcised you
&gt;should cut your Penis off and says that the sacrifice on the cross is
&gt;an &quot;offense&quot;.
">

Circumcision is of the Law and is applicable to Israel; not the the
Gentiles or the church of God.  Paul circumsised Timothy whose mother
was a Jew and whose father was a Gentile.  He did it because there
were busybody Jews nosing in other people's business.

Act 16:3 KJV
3  Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised
him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew
all that his father was a Greek.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Gal 5:11  And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet

&gt;I don't believe he ever cut off his own and he certainly never spoke
&gt;of it.  In his self aggrandizing style I'm sure he would have &quot;humbly&quot;
&gt;told us.
">

Paul did not say anything about cutting off a penis.  The word is not
used in the Bible.  The Revised Version corrected the translation:

Gal 5:12 RV
I would that they which unsettle you would even cut themselves off.

Paul was referencing a rite practiced by the Phrygians in the worship
of Cybele.

&gt;go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye
&gt;not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

&gt;In the book of Acts He is asked if he will go before Jerusalem to be
&gt;judged in the temple.  Did he practice what he preached?  Note: At the
&gt;time, Nero was Caesar.

&gt;Act 25:9  But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered
&gt;Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of
&gt;these things before me?
&gt;Act 25:10  Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I
&gt;ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very
&gt;well knowest.

Doesn't say anything about being judged in the Temple.  Two different
kinds of judgement; one a religious court (Acts) and the other a civil
court (Cor).  Paul demanded trial in civil court as  was his right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What happened to his earlier account?  He said,
&gt;Act 21:13  Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
&gt;heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at
&gt;Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

&gt;Some might say this was a smart move but by his own actions we find he
&gt;pays the price for telling lies.
">

No lies told.  Paul was told not to go to Jerusalem by God several
times; but went anyway.  It is one thing to be willing to die for what
you perceive to be a just cause; another thing to commit suicide by
committing yourself to religious fanaticsbent on killing you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Conflict #5 - Why he was brought to Trial.
&gt;It's also interesting that it is recorded in Acts that he lies about
&gt;why he was brought to trial.
&gt;Why was he brought to trial?
&gt;Act 21:21  And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the
&gt;Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they
&gt;ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the

Why are you perverting the word of God with you falsifications?  The
text reads, Paul; not Saul and certainly not Sha'ul.  Trying to show
off your very limited knowledge of Hebrew is back firing on you and
making you look like just another fanatic who has a beef with Paul
because Paul spoke against some sin that the fanatic likes to engage
in.

Paul did not lie.  Paul was a Pharisee.  He used his head and set
fanatic against fanatic.  It is apparendt that the one who is doing

Luk 11:17  But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every
kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house
divided against a house falleth.

Those are the words of the Messiah Yeshua and in every bible today is
the trojan horse of the Christian church.

Gal 2:7  But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the
uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the
circumcision was unto Peter;

The 13th apostle, Paul, claimed he had, &quot;the gospel of the
uncircumcision&quot;, but what is it?  What are the tenant of this other
gospel hidden inside of your bible?  Today we have dozens of different
denominations of Christian church's and different translations of the
same text of scriptures but why?  All of the differences between
church's that use only the Torah and the Prophets and the New
Testament can be traced to the Trojan horse the false Apostle Paul.

Whether the reader believe in 1, 2, 10 or 613 commandments from our
Creator, the differences are sourced in Paul.  Paul preached only 1
Commandment, the Messiah concluded that you can sum up the entire
Torah (5 books of Moses) in 2 Commandments, our very literal brothers
of Judaism believe 613 commandments and of course we have the 10
commandments given on Mt. Sinai.

Now some believe Paul was for the Law and some believe Paul was
against the law and quote things like:
Rom 10:4  For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
one that believeth.
Col 2:14  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against
us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it
to his cross;

Good for them I say.  I will not argue this point at all because where
I'm going is to the real doctrine of the &quot;uncircumcision&quot;.  Paul was
definitely against the practice and made some very outlandish quotes
for us such as:
Php 3:2  Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the
concision.
Gal 5:2  Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised,
Christ shall profit you nothing.

Why was he so against the practice?  One of the most interesting and
telling quotes of Paul is:

1Co 6:12  All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not
expedient: all things are lawful for me, but (I will not be brought
under the power of any).
1Co 6:13  Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall
destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for
the Lord; and the Lord for the body.

Now keep that quote in mind as we jump to the Revelation of John:
Rev 2:1  Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; ...
Rev 2:2  I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how
thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them
which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:

Now we look into Ephesus and here we find the book,
Eph 1:1  Paul, an apostle

O.K. that's not looking to good but it must be another apostle,
right?  What else did the Messiah say?
Mat 16:18  And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon
this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
prevail against it.

Alright, so Peter is the Rock of our church, did he say anything about
Paul to support him?
2Pe 3:15  ...even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the
wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
2Pe 3:16  ... all his epistles,...some things hard to be understood, which
they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other
Scriptures, unto their own destruction.
2Pe 3:17  ...beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the
wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.

Error of the wicked? Led away?  Beware?  Wow. But he does call him
brother.  Oh wait,
1Pe 2:17  Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the
king.
He calls everybody brother, does he say any more?  Paul isn't named
again personally but we do find one of Paul's closest allies:

1Pe 5:12  By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I
have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true
grace of God wherein ye stand.
1Pe 5:13  The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son.

The church that is Babylon?  Isn't that spoken of in Revelations?
Rev 17:5  And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON
THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

Wait, am I sure about Silvanus?
2Th 1:1  Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the
Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

Wait, what other proof is there, this is the bible and he's an apostle
were talking about.. because your trying to tell me Paul is the church
of Babylon?  O.K. let us go back to Revelations, What church is next?
Smyrna, that was located just north of Ephesus and its church is not
written about in any other scripture but it says:

Rev 2:8  And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These
things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;
Rev 2:9  I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art
rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and
are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

Well Paul was a Jew, right.  Let us see what Paul says:
1Co 9:20  And unto the Jews (I became as a Jew), that I might gain the
Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might
gain them that are under the law;
Act 21:37  And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak
Greek?
Act 21:38  Art not thou that (Egyptian), which before these days
madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand
men that were murderers?
Act 22:27 And having come, the commander said to him, &quot;Say to me, are
you a Roman?&quot; And he said, &quot;Yes.&quot;
Gal 2:15  We who are (Jews by nature)
2Co 11:22  Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I.
Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
Php 3:5  Circumcised the eighth day, of the (stock of Israel), of the
tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a
Pharisee;
Act 21:39  But Paul said, I am a man which am a (Jew of Tarsus), a
city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city:

Now wait, how can he be &quot;of the stock of Israel&quot; and also a Roman
Pharisee from Tarsus that spoke Greek?
Act 15:23  And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The
apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which
are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.

So, they are Gentiles in Cilicia.
Act 6:9  Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called
the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and
of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.

The synagogue of the Libertines? Now that's the only mention of them
in the entire scripture. Now this must have been the synagogue that
Paul was trained at.  What happened to Stephen?
Act 6:13  And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not
to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
Act 7:59  And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
Jesus, receive my spirit.
Act 22:20  And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also
was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment
of them that slew him.

And here is the birth of Paul from the gentile synagogue of the
Libertines.  So he wasn't a Jew at all except, &quot;by nature&quot;.  O.K. so
what happened next?  We all know that Saul admitted he was a murderer.
What next?

Act 8:2  And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
lamentation over him.
Act 9:1  And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter
against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
Act 9:2  And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues,
that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he
might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
Act 8:3  As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every
house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.

So we see that they returned Stephen to Jerusalem, to the high priest
and Paul was hired by the very same high Priest that just murdered the
Messiah, Caiaphas.
Mat 26:57  And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to
Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
assembled.
Act 4:6  And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and
Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were
gathered together at Jerusalem.

He got a commission to go kill the church of the Messiah and went out
for that infamous trip to Damascus synagogues.  What happened?

Recorded three times in the book of Acts are 3 accounts of the same
journey to Damascus.
Act 9:6  And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou
have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the
city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
Act 9:7  And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless,
hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
Act 9:8  And Saul arose from the earth;

Notice the men heard the voice but On the other occasion they didn't...
Act 22:9  And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were
afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
Act 22:10  And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto
me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of
all things which are appointed for thee to do.
Act 22:11  And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being
led by the hand of them that were with me,
Instead of being told to go to &quot;the city&quot; he is now told go to
Damascus.

And the third time is completely different, No longer being told to

Hebrews, which is clearly either the work of Paul, the false apostle,
or one of his fellows &quot;side kicks&quot; of Satan, does not name the
author.  No church authority claims to know the author, and yet the
book is canonized.  It meets no prophetic criteria and it speaks some
very evil lies mixed in with some nice sounding things about the
Messiah and our Father in Heaven but all clearly a work of fiction.
I could find little to fault outright about the book at first until I
got to Chapter 5 and then it was all downhill and the lies got deeper
and the arrogance of the author presumptive.

Heb 6:1  Therefore (leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ),
let us go on unto perfection; NOT laying again the foundation of
(repentance from dead works), (and of faith toward God),
Heb 6:2  Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and
of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
Heb 6:3  (And this will we do), if God permit.

Any reader who consume this and says there is something more perfect
then the sacrifice at Calvary, doesn't believe in Jesus Christ!  The
author goes on to say that if we repent from our sins as the Messiah
commanded us, we again crucify him and put him to shame.

Heb 6:6  If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance;
seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him
to an open shame.

A pretty scary thought but also the work of Satan when considered
along side all the teachings of the Messiah who's sacrifice was for
all and in his own words:

Joh 19:30  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It
is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.

It would not make any sense for the Messiah to preach repentance only
to do away with it as soon as he was murdered.

Luk 17:3  Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against
thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
Luk 17:4  And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and
seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt
forgive him.

He taught that if you needed to repent seven times a day... Do it! The
work of the Messiah is complete already and there is no way to improve
perfection.  It is impossible for us to blemish his perfection for he
is the Son of Elohim. The author behind this work of fiction is
clearly Satan that would deny the perfect sacrifice and boldly deny
the basic teachings of the Messiah.  Yet, how many people assume this
to be the words of Elohim?  Because a book is canonized in the evil
Roman Empire by a group of Sun worshiping Pagans doesn't make it
inspired by the creator!

I can say with assurance that his book is Satan inspired because it
goes against the written words given in the writings of Psalm by none
other then King David.  The book has the nerve to say that the words
of Elohim himself is useless!  This is in your &quot;holy bible&quot;!  Since
our Father Yahweh spoke those Ten Commandments on Mt. Sinai himself,
they are perfect but look at what &quot;Hebrews&quot; claims:

Heb 7:18  For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside
because of its weakness and uselessness
Heb 7:19  (for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a
better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.

That says clearly the Commandments of Elohim, written by his finger on
stone, are weak and useless!  Now what did King David say?

Psa 19:7 The Torah of      Yahweh is perfect, bringing back the being;
The witness of      Yahweh is trustworthy, making wise the simple;
Psa 19:8 The orders of      Yahweh are straight, rejoicing the heart;
The command of      Yahweh is clear, enlightening the eyes;
Psa 19:9 The fear of      Yahweh is clean, standing forever; The right-
rulings of      Yahweh are true, They are righteous altogether,
Psa 19:10 More desirable than gold, Than much fine gold; And sweeter
than honey and the honeycomb.
Psa 19:11 Also, Your servant is warned by them, In guarding them there
is great reward.
Psa 19:12 Who discerns mistakes? Declare me innocent from those that
are secret,
Psa 19:13 Also keep Your servant back from presumptuous ones, Do not
let them rule over me. Then shall I be perfect, and innocent of great
transgression.
Psa 19:14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be
pleasing before You, O      Yahweh, my rock and my redeemer.

Now I know for you lawless brand of Christians that isn't enough
because you worship Paul and the unnamed author as creator but further
proof is in the false statement of:

Heb 6:20  Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made a
high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.

This logic drivels on at:

Heb 7:11  If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood,
(for under it the people received the law,) what further need was
there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek,
and not be called after the order of Aaron?
Heb 7:12  For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity
a change also of the law.

First off, the imperfection was in MAN, not in the Levitical
priesthood that Elohim created by telling Moses.  The creator is
perfect in all his ways and to assume any fault in the system, assumes
imperfection in the creator and the fault must lay with us and our
rebellious ways of sin.

This failed logic attempts to justify itself by using the obscure
reference of Melchizedek, King of Salem and Priest of Elohim as noted
in this verse:

Gen 14:18  And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:
and he was the priest of the most high God.

It then goes on to say some &quot;whoppers of obscurity&quot; about Jesus not
being a Levitical priest but proof shows otherwise.  First, we should
examine the bloodline of the Messiah.

Luk 1:5 There was in the days of Herodes, the sovereign of Yehud ah, a
certain (priest) named Zek aryah, of the division of Ab iyah. And his
wife was of the (daughters of Aharon), and her name was Elisheb a.

That is Aaron of the Levitical priesthood. In verse 36, we see Mary is
related, probably a niece since Elizabeth is much older then her.

Luk 1:36 &quot;And see, Elisheb a your relative, she has also conceived a
son in her old age. And this is now the sixth month to her who was
called barren,
Luk 1:37 because with Elohim no matter shall be impossible.&quot;

We also see the bloodline of King David in Mary.  So half Levi, half
King, perfect according to the word!

Luk 3:23  And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age
being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,
Luk 3:31  Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan,
which was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was
the son of David,

And so in conclusion we can show via the gospel just using the given
bloodlines of Mary that the Messiah was perfection and of both the
King's bloodline and the Levite priest.

Eph 1:1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,

Conflict # 16 Dietary Laws and Marriage
1Ti 4:1  Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will
depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and
teachings of demons,
1Ti 4:2  through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are
seared,
1Ti 4:3  who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that

Conflict # 17 First with Christ, Conflicts with himself.

beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall
from your own steadfastness.

Eph 4:6  One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all,
and in you all.
Vs.
Joh 8:44  Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your

thorns, or figs of thistles?
Isa 5:3  And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
I pray you, between me and my vineyard.

Conflict # 24 Paul voted murder saints, unrepentant.
Rather then repent he makes this statement,
Act 20:26  Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure
from the blood of all men.
2Co 7:8  For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent,
though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made
you sorry, though it were but for a season.
Vs.
Act 26:10  And I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the
saints in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but
when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.
Conflict # 25 Law will not save?
Rom 3:20  Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
Gal 5:4  Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
Gal 5:5  For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness
by faith.
Vs.
Jas 2:24  Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
faith only.
Jas 2:26  For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
works is dead also.

Conflict #26  Jews persecuted Paul?
Act 25:3  And desired favor against him, that he would send for him to
Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.
Act 25:7  And when he was come, the Jews which came down from
Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints
against Paul, which they could not prove.
Vs.  Jews from Asia?
Act 19:28  And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath,
and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
Act 21:27  And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which
were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the
people, and laid hands on him,
Act 21:29  (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)

Where he robbed the Temple? 2Co 11:8  I robbed other churches, taking
wages of them, to do you service.
Notice it's plural churches he robbed, more then one.

So you think you are correct and what you say should be accepted,
