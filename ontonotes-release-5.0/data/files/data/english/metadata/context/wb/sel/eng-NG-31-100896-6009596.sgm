Let me put it this way. In Kant's view, boiling this down to a nugget,
the source of significance and truth would be the Critique of Pure
Reason
and the arguments contained therein. Because whatever you may claim
possesses the qualities of significance and truth, it must pass the
test
of Critique.

"Part-timer" is a colloquial expression for a poor example: a person
who does not rate highly in a particular field or literally does not
spend sufficient time on the field to rate as a "proper" philosopher.

I am proud enough to think myself common enough and do philosophy. But
I'd rather read Heidegger whom I rate as a major thinker against
Sartre who was more of a novel writer. Rand falls into the latter
category. More of a motivator for the below average intellegence
rather than a serious contender like Kant with whom she seems to be
constantly contrasted on this Newsgroup.

Some people seem to like viewing philosophy as a sports competition.
As I've posted before, though, advocates of both 'sides'  are not
doing any philosophy; one can call them cheerleaders of philosophy,
but not much else.  And that none of the cheerleaders is fairly
representing the philosophy for which he is cheering, as both the
philosophies of both Rand and Kant stress the supreme importance of
acting on one's own judgement, rather than either of theirs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chaz, I know who wrote /Atlas Shrugged/.  My question (which you might

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What's a 'part-time philosopher'?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Part-timer&quot; is a colloquial expression for a poor example: a person
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who does not rate highly in a particular field or literally does not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spend sufficient time on the field to rate as a &quot;proper&quot; philosopher.

&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, Rene Descartes would have been a 'part-time philosopher',
&gt; &gt; &gt; as he was primarily a mathematician.  Or John Locke, as his occupation
&gt; &gt; &gt; was doctor.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is a kind of joke - do you see?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, I missed the humour.  It sounded like a pale echo of Moronic
&gt; &gt; &gt; Prick's thesis that &quot;the common man&quot; should not be philosophizing, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; that those who do are being &quot;uppity

&gt; &gt; I am proud enough to think myself common enough and do philosophy. But
&gt; &gt; I'd rather read Heidegger whom I rate as a major thinker against
&gt; &gt; Sartre who was more of a novel writer. Rand falls into the latter
&gt; &gt; category. More of a motivator for the below average intellegence
&gt; &gt; rather than a serious contender like Kant with whom she seems to be
&gt; &gt; constantly contrasted on this Newsgroup.

&gt; Some people seem to like viewing philosophy as a sports competition.
&gt; As I've posted before, though, advocates of both 'sides'  are not
&gt; doing any philosophy; one can call them cheerleaders of philosophy,
&gt; but not much else.  And that none of the cheerleaders is fairly
&gt; representing the philosophy for which he is cheering, as both the
&gt; philosophies of both Rand and Kant stress the supreme importance of
&gt; acting on one's own judgement, rather than either of theirs
">

I think I would regard Rand as another cheerleader and fantasist. It
seems to me that she was a product of her experience - from a
disgruntled jewish ex-patriot Russian family that had been provided
witht the benefits of the "American Dream" and thought (with none of
the hard experience of the common man) that an extreme version of
american right wing politics was the way to go: as far from the
"communist" Russia from which she had been rejected. Her depth of
economic understanding is as thick as rice paper, its consequences and
realities not considered.

At least you're identifying yourself as one in the process.

It seems to me like you don't know what you're talking about; that you
know nothing of Rand's background, and (rather than find out)
preferred to just invent a fantasy about it.

But then, of course, your comments are purely ideological in nature:
you don't like Rand's economics because you're a socialist.  Which
also explains why you feel driven to make up fantasies about her.
