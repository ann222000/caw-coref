Although I'm not a fan of the PS3 at all, I'd say Killzone 2 looks
pretty decent concidering PS3's crippled GeForce 7800/7900 based
graphics processor.

compared to the E3 2005 prerendered trailer, the actual game
*runs at half the framerate
*has much less complexity &amp; detail
*is half the resolution; 720p (1m pixels) instead of the 1080p (2m
pixels)
*has FAR lower image quality

thus the graphics are, overall, a FRACTION of the prerendered trailer,
yet that was to be expected, except perhaps the low framerate, I was
actually semi-expecting 60fps even though I knew the detail and image
quality would be much, much less.

GC 2007: Killzone 2 Blowout
Hands-on, eyes-on and a Q&amp;A combined for your geeking-out pleasure.
by Greg Miller

August 24, 2007 - The rocket launcher in Killzone 2 is pretty awesome.
We had only had the Sixaxis controller in our hands for a few minutes
when we ran across the behemoth and hoisted it onto our shoulder, but
as we ducked down a dark alleyway and lightning crackled overhead, we
couldn't wait to use the thing.

Killzone 2 doesn't happen on Vekta, the setting of the first console
outing and Killzone: Liberation. Instead, you take the fight to the
enemy's home world of Helghan. This puts your team at an immediate
disadvantage. After living on the godforsaken rock for years, the
Helghast have grown accustom to living in survival suits and
harnessing the constant lightning for their massive anti-aircraft
cannon.

That cannon just shot down our friends -- troops from the Legion. Now,
we have a rocket launcher and the flashes in the sky have illuminated
some of the Helghast shooting up our friends in the distance.

We kick the rocket launcher into scope mode -- pretty much your
traditional R3 fare with a green tint and enlarged reticule -- and
point it at the pair of enemies pinning our reinforcements down. We
pull the trigger, the launcher kicks back, and the rocket lurches out,
hangs in the air for a split second and takes off to slam the villains
into the afterlife.

We wish we could tell you we stopped and basked in the eerie smoke
trail the rocket left on the screen, but suddenly a dozen pissed off
Helghast began shooting every weapon they had at us. This is war.

It's been a banner morning in Leipzig, Germany. Far from the show
floor over run with German teens and a myriad of soccer videogames,
sits Sony's private meeting rooms. In the last on one on the left,
Guerrilla Games Director Mathijs De Jonge and Guerrilla Games Producer
Steven Ter Heide are holding Killzone 2 court, and there's rarely an
empty seat in the small space.

At first glance, their presentation might not seem that. Each time a
new group enters the space, Mathijs and Steven queue up the same
Killzone 2 demo folks saw at E3 and stop when they beat the mini-boss
packing that badass machine gun tethered to his back.

It's awesome stuff, but we've seen it before, right?

Not like this. With the standard presentation of the carrier going
down, shooting from behind cover and basically blasting anything that
gets in front of your sights finished, the pair restarts the demo and
takes the intimate audience through a play-stop-explain format.

To begin with, they pause the game during its intro as the transport
begins its bumpy descent. As Mathis mans the sticks, Steven takes the
camera out of the action and down to the ground level. Once there, it
becomes clear it's the same 3D environment players are about to blast
through.

&quot;There's no trickery going on,&quot; Steven says. &quot;This allows us to have a
seamless transition from the cutscene to the game.&quot;

Next, the duo lets Sev, Killzone 2's main character, get to that first
firefight on the ground. Both sides start shooting, one of your men is
set on fire, and things are starting to go to hell.

Steven pauses the game. Time to talk lighting.

With all the craziness that's going on in the typical Killzone 2
screen, Mathijs and Steven don't expect you to notice what's going on
with the 500 different light sources around the level -- and that's a
good thing. You're supposed to be caught up in the seamless
experience. But with the game paused, Steven clicks off the cross-
processing filters and harsh sunlight floods the once dark arena.
Parts of Killzone 2 are extremely dark and hard to see in, and that's
on purpose. Guerrilla is trying to change the feeling of environments
through light or the lack thereof.

You don't need to look far to see the theory in action. On the
outside, Sev ducks and shoots as lightning erupts overhead and casts
creepy shadows on the ground and gives glimpses of the evil ahead.
Inside, Sev stops at the entrance to a room, and a Helghast hops over
a railing in the distance -- the light source is coming from a bright
room behind him and casts a sinister shadow on the empty wall. Later
on, Sev runs into a foe in a pitch-dark room -- the bad guy's menacing
eyes give him away -- and as Sev unloads his assault rifle into the
man's chest, muzzle flashes illuminate the bullets piercing the foe
and his pitiful flails.

When they restart the game, Mathijs walks us through Sev's new cover-
based combat techniques. Now, players can approach cover and press one
of the shoulder buttons to latch onto the object. From here Sev can
blindly fire by hitting the shoot button, pop out with a press of the
joystick and break off the defensive maneuver with another button tap.
The enemies and NPCs will use the same techniques, which brings up a
good point -- the opposing forces aren't dumb in Killzone 2.

If a Helghast is pressed up against a concrete pillar or wooden crate
and you've punched enough holes in the obstacle to make it useless,
don't expect the bad guy to sit there and take it. These guys will
react and move in tactical, group dynamics.

Don't think you can ignore your team, either. As a member of the
Legion, you'll need help thinning out the hordes of bad guys on the
prowl. When your commander -- Rico from the first Killzone -- goes
down, you'll have a limited window of time to get over to him and use
you medical pistol to pop a shot of health into the wounded soldier.

Getting shot is a big part of Killzone 2. In fact, it's with those
grisly deaths in mind that Guerrilla developed its &quot;Hit/Response
System.&quot; Using a blend of motion capturing and physics, each type of
enemy is going to have a different reaction when shot and that
reaction will depend on what weapon is doing the shooting.

For instance, let's look at that mini-boss with the suped-up machine
gun. This guy's name -- as of now -- is The Heavy. He's the biggest
human you're going to see in the game and he's covered in armor. If
you shoot him in the right arm with a machine gun from close up, he's
only going to take a stutter step back to the right. Meanwhile, if you
pull the same CQC move on a regular solider, he's going to get knocked
back way further than our mini-boss, and that's a pretty extreme
example. That regular ol' guard is going to react differently to shots
depending on where they're coming from, where he's being shot and what
type of weapon is being used. This isn't as simple as big guys don't
move as much as little guys.

One of the cooler physics inclusions? You'll notice a handful of gas
containers around the level. If you shoot these things, gas will begin
spraying out of the bullet hole and push the container in that like a
rocket. It's a valuable way to take out the enemy, but if you misfire
or the enemy hits the tank first, expect that bad boy to come flying
at you.

After the detailed breakdown was over, Mathijs surrendered the
controller to IGN. This game plays well. From the moment we picked it
up and began using it's double analog control scheme, everything felt
natural. We blew away some guards, hurled a few grenades and tried out
the brand new jump function. Jumping was left out of the original game
in an effort to keep it based in reality, but even here it's being
grounded -- you can't fire while in the air and can oly leap over
small obstacles.

So, yeah. We walked and ran through the levels, picked up weapons and
basically had a ball. Our shots tore up tables, put holes in the wall
and ran as smoothly as everyone's been expecting them to.

Once Mathijs and Steven opened up the floor to questions, the specs of
Sony's golden game started to come into focus. Killzone 2 will run at
a steady 30 fps in 720p. On the gameplay side, the duo said Sixaixis
will be implemented in the game but weren't allowed to elaborate, and
although the team couldn't talk about multiplayer, they said the medic
gun would be in there for players to help each other and described the
mode as a &quot;considerable&quot; component that would use Home and
Killzone.com.

For the final question of the meeting, someone asked how much of the
Blu-Ray disc the game would use. Mathijs and Steven chuckled. The E3
level everyone had just seen clocks in at 2 GB.

Guerrilla expects to pretty much use the whole disc.

it's even less impressive than i expected it to turn out. this was the
deciding factor in my wait-to-see attitude about the ps3. i'm sticking with
my 360

I'm surprised it looks the way it does. I was actually expecting
worse.

not saying I'm really impressed, i'm not. just saying it doesn't look
as bad as I thought it would

but no way would I buy a PS3 for this game.

They do have 6 months or so to work on the frame rate.

6 months?
I was one of the guys that was hard on the videos they showed at E3 on
Killzone 2. Since then the videos they are now showing of K2 are a  lot more
polished then they were in just a little over a month or so ago.. In 6
months this game is going to be amazing. The area hit impact this game has
is incredible. I am really excited to see how this game ans out over the
next few months.  I definitely think it's going to be  game that is going to
start to show what this system with it's  BluRay and Cell chip are capable
of.  Just look at UT3. It's more then capable of running at 30fps with
graphics that rival or surpass Gears of War and Epic is going to go with a
rock solid 30 so they can push the envelope even further.

Crippled graphics card?
LMAO. Like I said this guy is a RIOT!

first of all, the PS3 does not have a graphics CARD, it has a GPU
built into its motherboard.

And yes,  PS3's GPU is a CRIPPLED  G70/G71 / GeForce 7800/7900.

unlike the PC 7800/7900,  the PS3 version, RSX, has 8 of the pixel-
rendering-piplines/ROPs removed. it's got 8 instead of 16.   don't
confuse the 24 pixel shaders in RSX with pixel-pipelines. they're
seperate components of the GPU.

Also, the external memory bus connected to GDDR3 memory is 128-bit on
RSX instead of 256-bit on the 7800/7900 PC cards.   even the older
generation NV40 / GeForce 6800 from 2004 have a 256-bit bus and 16
pixel-rendering pipelines/ROPs.

so yes the PS3 graphics chip, RSX, is crippled compared to highend PC
GPU/cards of 2005.

so, *you* are the fucking riot that makes me laugh out loud.
