Here in the richest country in the world, we can't afford athletics or libraries for our children : "The West Contra Costa school district Monday night voted to eliminate high school athletics [in six high schools], close all its libraries and lay off 10 percent of its employees as part of $16.5 million in budget cuts. On the chopping block are 407 positions, or roughly 10 percent of the district's employees, including psychologists, speech therapists, teachers, principals, counselors and custodians." And the future of another bunch of kids gets flushed down the drain.

As usual, the proposed solution to failed government is to "turn to the private sector." The schools are planning to ask beg rich professional athletes to help fund their athletic programs. I wonder if they'll have equal success raising money from rich professional librarians.

Meanwhile, in Iraq, $16.5 million doesn't even amount to petty cash. A subcontractor is suing Halliburton for stiffing it for $87 million in unpaid bills for three months of meals it has served to troops in Iraq, and is threatening to start serving the troops sandwiches instead of hot food if it doesn't get paid. The students in West Contra Costa County should be so lucky.

As much as this looks bad when compared to the money spent on war, I don't think this is all bad. All I learned in the schools of Empire was that only the US matters and one should aspire to work in a cubical.

So some kids can't play high school football. Talk about reinforcing "life lessons" based on brutally.

Also, I think libraries are overrated. Why should I be forced to learn from the past? No one ever says: "learn from the future."

I'm sure you're being partially facetious, but let me just point out that between 6 high schools who could easily be talking 50 kids who aren't going to get an athletic scholarship to go to college and who might spend their lives working at McDonalds as a result.

And personally, I learned quite a bit at school, like how to spell "cubicle."

What with other school districts giving extra credit for kids who bring in paper towels or toilet paper, it's turning into "no child's behind left," isn't it?

The barbarians are in command now, citizens. They overran the walls and breached the gates, and we can all look forward to years of ignorance.

My son is set for his life's work already -- I taught him to say, "You want fries with that?" in a very clear voice.
