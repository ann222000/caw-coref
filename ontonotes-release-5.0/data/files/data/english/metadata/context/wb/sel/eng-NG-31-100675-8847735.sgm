<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Some woman or other equated dog fights to
&gt; &gt; &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; in a Washington Post
&gt; &gt; editorial. And I say:

&gt; &gt; THESE ARE NOT CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY
&gt; &gt; (they are crimes against dogadity at best). It
&gt; &gt; cheapens humanity when morons like the woman
&gt; &gt; above drags down the uniqueness of &quot;humanity&quot;
&gt; &gt; to the level of one or other of the lower beasts.

&gt; &gt; These beasts are unconscious of their destiny
&gt; &gt; and there is nothing outside of pure physical pain
&gt; &gt; they can anguish over... like your child anguishes
&gt; &gt; over your treatment of him/her. Billions of chickens
&gt; &gt; are slaughtered every day for our dinner in a hell
&gt; &gt; of a lot more horrific ways than those of a dog fight.
&gt; &gt; And all over Asia dogs are raised and slaughtered for
&gt; &gt; food exactly like we slaughter chickens, ducks, et al.

&gt; &gt; Recently we read of a dog that ripped off his
&gt; &gt; mistress's face (because doctors gave her a face
&gt; &gt; transplant): THAT was probably a hell of a lot more
&gt; &gt; savage/brutal an incident than anything that ever
&gt; &gt; happened in any organized dog fight--THAT's the
&gt; &gt; nature of this particular beast. It is a brutal/savage
&gt; &gt; animal. And yet, do we hear any clamor for the
&gt; &gt; banning of dogs as pets? No. And not even when
&gt; &gt; nearly 5,000,000 human beings are savaged every
&gt; &gt; year by dogs in this country alone (900,000 of whom
&gt; &gt; are ripped so badly that they require major medical
&gt; &gt; intervention). And that's EVERY year. With thousands
&gt; &gt; horribly killed or disfigured (especially children!).

&gt; &gt; Dogs are the most savage animals man has been
&gt; &gt; able to domesticate--THAT's why we domesticated
&gt; &gt; them. Dog fights are indeed inhuman, BECAUSE
&gt; &gt; humans so seldom engage in fights like those (but
&gt; &gt; we sometimes do, and that's why we will almost
&gt; &gt; certainly have dog fights). Yet place almost any two
&gt; &gt; dogs together and you will have a &quot;dog fight.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Enough of this nonsense: Fine Vick a few thousands
&gt; &gt; or whatever. And let him get on with his life. This
&gt; &gt; notion of crucifying him for putting dogs together so
&gt; &gt; they can do what comes natural to them is what is
&gt; &gt; detestable and insulting to the humanity of us all.

&gt; What can I say to this load of lies in defense of cruelty?  Only
&gt; that it depresses me that there are people with such ideas on
&gt; this earth

&gt; Lark.
">

I'm not really that cruel--Well, I am a little
cruel. But as a kid I asked my mother for a dog
(not that I really wanted a dog... it's just that
all the other kids had dogs). And my mother,
crazy as she was, God bless her, always liked
to give me everything I asked, cars, guns, and
now a dog! When what I really wanted was a
slave: I wanted a slave I could order about.
Maybe (eventually) chop his head off. (&quot;Well
if you're going to do it, do it out in the yard.
Your Uncle Roger executed his slave in the
living room and we still haven't gotten the
blood off the marble!&quot;) So a dog she got for me.
And nothing could've been worse: This animal
came in and started crapping and pissing all
over the house, eating from his bowl and then
vomiting it all over the place. And this beast
STUNK like nothing I've ever smelled before:
Finally I cried out: &quot;Get this fucking animal out
of here!&quot; Albeit my mother told me, &quot;You asked
for it, now you're going to have to take care of it!&quot;
So I said, &quot;Okay. I'll get Grandpa's gun...&quot; Which
was not the smartest thing I could've said: &quot;You
mean this fucking kid knows where I keep my gun?!&quot;
Said Grandpa: &quot;You know he's crazy! Jesus! He
could've killed us all while we slept!&quot; (Which is
crazy because as soon as I'd shot the first one
of'em the reat of them would've woke up and
scrambled out the windows on me or something.)
But, in any case, my Mother told me if I wanted to
kill the dog I'd have to do it with a hammer (which
she handed me). And I was going to whack him
good but dogs are such shameless kiss-ups, with
their longing eyes, and they put their heads on
your lap and look at your with an &quot;I love you so
much!&quot; (look) and, &quot;You're my hero!&quot; So I couldn't
bring myself to blow him away (with blows from the
hammer). I thought Ganny'd do it--She was used
to strangling chickens and once I even saw her
knock a cat off our roof with a big heavy brick.
But she wouldn't do it either. Damn dog seem to
know what was up and whenever I went to ask
someone else to waste him he's rush up to that
person and place his soulful head on that person's
lap and let's just say nobody wanted the job. So
we decided to get hold of this really mean bastard
we knew of down a couple of blocks from us and
we offered him a cool $50 bucks to come over
and finish off the troublesome dog--which he
accepted. He was a mean-looking bastard too.
He came over, took the dog, the hammer, and
the $50 bucks into the guest bathroom with a,
&quot;This'll only take a minute!&quot; (while we waited
outside for the dog to holler, or whatever). But,
about FIVE minutes later the fat bastard came out
and handed back the $50 bucks. Then he walked
away without saying a word! &quot;We're going about
this all wrong,&quot; said Granny: &quot;It's NOT our
responsibility to kill this damned dog, we should
just take him out somewhere far away and just
leave him there.&quot; But no sooner had she finished
saying that than the damn dog &quot;showed up his paw&quot;
and there, in black and white, was our address
tattooed or written in by the devil--who knows. That
dog seemed to know what we were saying! Well,
&quot;This dog is here to stay!' And he stayed.
Unfortunately for all of us, including the dog
because ours was a house full of psychopathic
germophobes... and, as you probably know, dogs are
about the most filthy/stinking animals on the face of
this earth: Farting is just the least of it, they DO
NOT USE TOILET PAPER, and employ their
TONGUE instead. And THEN they want to come
over and LICK
you like that's the greatest thing on earth for you!
I mean, it's okay for people who eat shit and all,
who can watch their dog slapping away at their asses
after a solid (or not) crapping and then coming over
and Frenching the damn creatures! I've seen it with
my own eyes: &quot;O, Fluffy needs to brush his teeth...
Come, give Mommy another kissie-pooh!&quot; [Dry
heave.] This didn't do in my house. There it was:
&quot;Agh!!!!! The damn dog touched me! Now I gotta
change my clothes! Can't you tie him outside the
house? He stinks! When are you gonna bathe it!?!&quot;
&quot;I bathed him this morning!&quot; &quot;Well, did you at
least try to drown him?&quot; &quot;Of course. But he won't
go anywhere near more than two inches of water.
I think he knows he meaning of 'drowning.'&quot; That
dog was smart, let me tell you.

This went on like that for what seemed ages (at
least a week, or nearly). And then, one day I got
home from school and when I opened the front
door the dog darted out into the middle of the
street, where he was run over by a car. Now, some
of the people that know ofthe incident say that it was
an accident. But, I say that when a dog wants to
greet somebody it runs up to that person. And that
dog ran out the door like the devil was chasing it.
So I say it was suicide. In any case, the driver of
the car got out and told us: &quot;This dog is dead.&quot;
No news there: he ran his car over him twice. &quot;Here,
let me help you move him out of the street,&quot; said he
and kicked the corpse all the way to the sidewalk
(although I think he was probably more concerned
with getting the dog out of the way so he could go
on his way). He was a big, fat guy, well-dressed, and
driving a large, expensive car--Which was why nobody
there said anything when he got back in his car and
drove off: nobody wanted to mess with somebody
driving a car that expensive (in my little home town
one didn't drive a car like that without being
somebody important). Maybe if the dog had been run
over by somebody riding a mule we might've kicked
up a ruckus about it and even tried to get some
&quot;replacement cash&quot; for a new dog. But this particular
fat bastard looked too important to mess with. Was
like &quot;the don&quot; running over a kid in an Italian
neighborhood: &quot;It's okay: Didn't puncture any of my
tires.&quot; We just counted ourselves lucky that we were
at least rid of the damn dog, and got on with our
lives. That is the lesson the dog taught us: I never
owned another dog since. And, by the way, FYI: you
don't know how many fleas a dog has until you kill it
and put it in a see-through plastic bag (for easy
garbage-disposal): Boy! Did fleas started coming out
of that dog. It's like, &quot;This dog is dead, baby. Time
to move on to the next doggie!&quot; Geronimo!

Never did find out whether the fleas made it out of
the plastic bag. But it makes for some fine
philosophical musings on rainy days...

Jealousy-Induced Wrong Again, Clown!!
There wasn't anything, even,
remotely, entertaining,
about how that fucking
satanic idiot likes to
kill dogs or whatever
the fuck that idiot
shit was supposed
to be conveying.
And, the fact you're
admitting that crap
like that, is
more your
cup of tea,
is just further proof
of what I was saying,
dumb ass!! Go to the
kook groups and stop
posting and crossposting
HERE!! And as far as
your pathetic use of the
word &quot;We&quot; when
unconvincingly
critiquing Me--:
You use
the term &quot;We&quot;
a lot, to make
yourself,
seem less
pathetically,
ALONE,
I guess. But,
aligning yourself
with KOOKS or
WORSE, to appear
less lonely; THAT,
is much worse
than just being
pathetically
alone!! But,
who else
can a DUMB
ASS CREEPY
UNCOOL
CROSSPOSTING
KOOK
align himself
with, really,
besides, yet
another, DUMB
