I've been seeing him in ads for the new Jimmy Smits show &quot;Cane&quot; when
last we left his character was alive and I would hope we get an
explanation for his not aging a day since he met Ben. Hopefully they
let him appear on both shows.

Here's what he looks like if the name doesn't ring a bell:

He was at the press tour, said he doesn't know if he'll be back on

IMO, the producers would be nuts to put him in the scenes they did if
they didn't have him signed for the next season.

OTOH, let's not forget Mrs. Klugh.  She was introduced as an important
character toward the end of season 2, then vanished for all but 5
minutes of season 3.

That's the one benefit of the new scheduling.  Because it looks like
they're going to shoot straight through starting later than most other
TV series do, it might allow the actor to &quot;fill in&quot; his scenes while
the other series he's in is taking breaks.  Could be his &quot;new&quot; series
is cancelled before the producers even need him :-(

like they did Ms Klugh...)

But Ms. Klugh was an awful character with a bad actress, none of that
applies to Carbonell.

Yeah, well, of course he would say that.  Because if he answered in the
affirmative, that would be a spoiler for season 4.

And you probably heard that after the game-changer got leaked to a
website, ABC blew their top and demanded the producers crack down on
leaks, which they have.  I'm sure the word has gotten around to the
actors that leaking even minor spoilers to the media could get them
dismissed from the show.  In fact, the producers are so insistent on
this that it wouldn't surprise me if they tried to write such a clause
into the actors' contracts for season 4.

I saw a commercial for another new series that has Terry O'Quinn in
it. Didn't catch the name of the series though. Might that mean Locke
gets killed off on Lost? Guess we will see.

The following comes from http://spoilerslost.blogspot.com/ :

&lt;Begin quoted material&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the currently running CBS Live Press Tour Nestor Carbonell
">

(Richard Alpert) stated that he still has no idea if he'll be back on
Lost next season or why his character never aged.

We still don't know how he will be juggling his filming schedule if
indeed he does return to Lost.

...and thanks to Leslies_a_Bitchin_Name for finding the following.

A press tour perennial: anytime an actor who had a recurring role on a
popular series joins the cast of a new show, they're asked whether
they'll have a chance to appear from time to time on their old show.
Inevitably, the answer is, &quot;I'm so happy to be here on my new show,
but if an opportunity to visit my old pals presents itself, I'd like
to take it.&quot; Even more inevitably, such a reunion doesn't happen until/
unless the new show gets canceled -- especially if they're on
different networks.

Today's contestant in this age-old game: Nestor Carbonell, who played
Richard, a seemingly-immortal member of The Others on &quot;Lost&quot; last
season, and is now a regular on &quot;Cane,&quot; CBS' Cuban-flavored
&quot;Godfather&quot; homage, with him as the Sonny Corleone figure in a family
of rum and sugar magnates.

So, I asked, would he be able to go back to &quot;Lost,&quot; even just to solve
the mystery of Richard's well-preserved face? And would his &quot;Cane&quot;
character age?

&quot;You'd probably know the answer to that second one better than I
would,&quot; Carbonell laughed.

As for the first, he gave the stock answer to the question, but &quot;Cane&quot;
producer Jonathan Prince acknowledged that it's good PR for the show
to have its actors appearing in other popular media, whether it's a
small role in a &quot;Batman&quot; film or hopping back to &quot;Lost&quot; for a quick
guest spot. The ultimate decision, though, would be up to the network.

I tracked down the ultimate decider on that, CBS entertainment
president Nina Tassler, and asked her whether she'd let Carbonell do a
guest spot if the &quot;Lost&quot; producers asked.

&quot;Probably not,&quot; she said, arguing that they're trying to establish a
new show and a new character, and she felt it would confuse the
audience to see Carbonell playing roles on two different series at
once.

Left unanswered (and, admittedly, unasked): would Tassler consider it
so confusing if &quot;Lost&quot; was also a CBS show?

A cast member from Lost appears on an episode of Law and Order on
cable every 4.2 seconds 24/7/365. People realize these are ACTORS.
Worst excuse to screw another network EVER. ;-)

So if Richard won't be back on Lost, just exactly how important is his
plotline anyhow? Does it even matter of he's aging or not?   Just
another red herring attached to a throwaway character...

You write that as though the &quot;Lost&quot; producers are the ones saying he
probably won't be permitted to be on the show, instead of the CBS
executive.  Do you really think the character of Richard Alpert was
planned and cast with the knowledge that Nestor Carbonell wouldn't be
available for season 4?

If the worst case scenario (in &quot;Lost&quot; terms) happens, the question of
Richard's aging can be delayed, or they can introduce other characters
who originated from the same place and time as Richard.  That might
mean ancient people or crew members of the Black Rock, for example.
Richard is not necessarily the only person on the island who is not
aging.  The producers can certainly advance that plotline without him
if they must.

Not necessarily.  The character could be pivotal in terms of
introducing a particular plot point, but the number of planned
appearances may not have been enough to warrant signing him to a
contract as a regular.  Richard's real significance may be that he was
the *first* character of his kind to be introduced, but not the only.
By the time he was identified as a particular fan favorite, he may

Yes they are going to introduce a &quot;not aging&quot; subplot that seemingly
affects only one character and then get rid of that character and
continue the subplot with a bunch of different characters. Brilliant

&quot;Seemingly&quot; is the word here.  There's no reason for me to believe
that Richard was a &quot;one of a kind&quot; kind of Other.  Why would you think
differently?

&gt; &gt; &gt; introducing a particular plot point, but the number of planned
&gt; &gt; &gt; appearances may not have been enough to warrant signing him to a
&gt; &gt; &gt; contract as a regular.  Richard's real significance may be that he was
&gt; &gt; &gt; the *first* character of his kind to be introduced, but not the only.
&gt; &gt; &gt; By the time he was identified as a particular fan favorite, he may
&gt; &gt; &gt; already have been signed by CBS.

&gt; &gt; Yes they are going to introduce a &quot;not aging&quot; subplot that seemingly
&gt; &gt; affects only one character and then get rid of that character and
&gt; &gt; continue the subplot with a bunch of different characters. Brilliant
&gt; &gt; planning.

&gt; &quot;Seemingly&quot; is the word here.  There's no reason for me to believe
&gt; that Richard was a &quot;one of a kind&quot; kind of Other.  Why would you think
&gt; differently?
">

Because he is the only one where there are &quot;clues&quot; to the 'not aging'
theory.  There hasn't been a hint or an inkling that applies to any
other character. What HAS been shown on screen is ambiguous and
applies ONLY to this one character.

I am just going to assume that the Island follows the normal rules of
the universe until shown otherwise.   Ben has demonstrably aged on the
show, his dad aged, there is no reason to think that there a bunch of
ageless Others running around.   Sure I can't disprove it based on
what we have seen, but there's no evidence FOR it either.

Some people want to take the (minimal, IMO) evidence that Richard is
not aging and from that assume that there MUST be &quot;other&quot; people that
are also not aging, this is a tremendous leap, in my mind.
Extraordinary claims require extraodinary evidence.

This is one of those theories that is based on what we don't know.
Hell, I think that John Belusi and Jim Morrison are living in sin in a
hut on the far side of the Island. The whole show is their drugged up
hallucination.   This must be a viable, acceptable theory because
nothing on the show has contradicted it.  The burden of proof is on
the claim, especially when the claim deviates substantially from the
norm.

The worst part is, she's got it backwards.  I can see ABC not wanting
him on both shows, because they have the higher rated one, and wouldn't
want to siphon off any viewers.  But CBS should LOVE to have somebody
currently on Lost be on their new show as well.

&gt; &gt; let him appear on both shows.

&gt; The following comes from http://spoilerslost.blogspot.com/ :

&gt; &lt;Begin quoted material&gt;

&gt; &gt;From the currently running CBS Live Press Tour Nestor Carbonell
&gt; (Richard Alpert) stated that he still has no idea if he'll be back on
&gt; Lost next season or why his character never aged.

&gt; We still don't know how he will be juggling his filming schedule if
&gt; indeed he does return to Lost.

&gt; ...and thanks to Leslies_a_Bitchin_Name for finding the following.

&gt; A press tour perennial: anytime an actor who had a recurring role on a
&gt; popular series joins the cast of a new show, they're asked whether
&gt; they'll have a chance to appear from time to time on their old show.
&gt; Inevitably, the answer is, &quot;I'm so happy to be here on my new show,
&gt; but if an opportunity to visit my old pals presents itself, I'd like
&gt; to take it.&quot; Even more inevitably, such a reunion doesn't happen until/
&gt; unless the new show gets canceled -- especially if they're on
&gt; different networks.

&gt; Today's contestant in this age-old game: Nestor Carbonell, who played
&gt; Richard, a seemingly-immortal member of The Others on &quot;Lost&quot; last
&gt; season, and is now a regular on &quot;Cane,&quot; CBS' Cuban-flavored
&gt; &quot;Godfather&quot; homage, with him as the Sonny Corleone figure in a family
&gt; of rum and sugar magnates.

&gt; So, I asked, would he be able to go back to &quot;Lost,&quot; even just to solve
&gt; the mystery of Richard's well-preserved face? And would his &quot;Cane&quot;
&gt; character age?

&gt; &quot;You'd probably know the answer to that second one better than I
&gt; would,&quot; Carbonell laughed.

&gt; As for the first, he gave the stock answer to the question, but &quot;Cane&quot;
&gt; producer Jonathan Prince acknowledged that it's good PR for the show
&gt; to have its actors appearing in other popular media, whether it's a
&gt; small role in a &quot;Batman&quot; film or hopping back to &quot;Lost&quot; for a quick
&gt; guest spot. The ultimate decision, though, would be up to the network.

&gt; I tracked down the ultimate decider on that, CBS entertainment
&gt; president Nina Tassler, and asked her whether she'd let Carbonell do a
&gt; guest spot if the &quot;Lost&quot; producers asked.

&gt; &quot;Probably not,&quot; she said, arguing that they're trying to establish a

&gt; A cast member from Lost appears on an episode of Law and Order on

&gt; Worst excuse to screw another network EVER. ;-)

&gt; So if Richard won't be back on Lost, just exactly how important is his
&gt; plotline anyhow? Does it even matter of he's aging or not?   Just
&gt; another red herring attached to a throwaway character...

I don't know where Nestor finds to the time to be acting at all, what with
his hero job of saving lives as BatManuel.

i am assuming you stop aging on the island after you have made a sacrifice

CBS's Entertainment Division is in a place that both NBC and The CW
envy--in first place, just ahead of ABC.

As long as that's the case, Nina Tessler's job is secure.  She must be
doing something right, because CBS' lineup is widely regarded as the
most solid overall of all the major networks.

&gt; &gt; not aging and from that assume that there MUST be &quot;other&quot; people that
&gt; &gt; are also not aging, this is a tremendous leap, in my mind.
&gt; &gt; Extraordinary claims require extraodinary evidence.

&gt; &gt; This is one of those theories that is based on what we don't know.
&gt; &gt; Hell, I think that John Belusi and Jim Morrison are living in sin in a
&gt; &gt; hut on the far side of the Island. The whole show is their drugged up
&gt; &gt; hallucination.   This must be a viable, acceptable theory because
&gt; &gt; nothing on the show has contradicted it.  The burden of proof is on
&gt; &gt; the claim, especially when the claim deviates substantially from the
&gt; &gt; norm.

I'd swap &quot;I am assuming&quot; with &quot;I have a theory that maybe,&quot; and then I
like it!  Or something like it.

(ejt, if you don't want to play the speculation game based on minimal
clues, please at least don't cut my &quot;fun&quot; speculation apart sentence
by sentence.  I think that part of the fun of the show is trying to
come up with theories that explain things, even if they turn out to be
way off.)

The problem with &quot;People don't age on the island,&quot; is that clearly Ben
aged, as did Alex.  Can we assume the Danielle aged as well?

So, if we're thinking there's a &quot;non-aging&quot; thing going on, and we
also are half-thinking that he's from the Black Rock, and other
non-agers might be as well...  then we might ask &quot;Why Richard (and
others) but not Ben?&quot;

But if we plug in &quot;sacrifice&quot; as the key to not aging, then we realize
that Ben is about the same age as when he killed his dad and that Alex
probably hasn't killed anyone yet.

On the other hand...  as much as I like an idea that seems to tie
together a couple previous mysteries, it does make me wonder:

What kind of cold-blooded island demands that YOU make a &quot;sacrifice&quot;
that is simply killing some other guy?

If the island is so happy with Ben now, why did it allow his cancer?

If the island wants a sacrifice before it starts doing its work, then
why is it healing Locke, Rose, etc.?  Or is &quot;healing&quot; different than
&quot;non-aging?&quot;  (Hmm, could &quot;never aging&quot; actually be viewed as some
kind of &quot;curse?&quot;  That's pretty out there.)

How does the ability to see Jacob fit in with this whole &quot;sacrifice /
killing / pleasing the island&quot; thing?  If anything, I was working on a
theory that, once you've killed, you can NO LONGER see Jacob.

Why?  Because Ben thought Locke had committed a murder, then took him
to see Jacob, and was then surprised that Locke could hear Jacob.
Someone else was the first to theorize that the reason Locke could
hear Jacob (and, in this theory, Ben couldn't) was that Locke was
still &quot;clean.&quot;

A lot of these theories should clear themselves up once we see a
couple more interactions.  For example, now that Locke has killed
someone, will he still hear Jacob?

OK, I won't pick it apart sentence by sentence, but I will point out
that it is taking a couple of data points and drawing a huge elaborate
picture from them.   There's a little bit o evidence for that theory,
certainly there is no evidence to disprove it, but I still think its a
stretch. For that to be the basic assumption of what is going on just
doesn't make any sense to me. I acknowledge it is a legit theory based
on the available evidence, but that doesn't mean it is what should be
assumed to be true going forward.  I know you replaced &quot;assume&quot; with
&quot;a theory&quot;, I am fine with that, its one possible theory.   The OP was
basically saying that this is the assumed explanation and go from
there, I'm not going to make that huge leap at this point based on the
minimal evidence.

All that mumbo jumbo about making a sacrifice could just be Locke
being manipulated.  That's what I'm going to assume since its the
likelier explanation.

I wouldn't go so far as to specify a &quot;sacrifice,&quot; but it seems fairly
certain to me that Craphole treats some characters differently than
others.  The thing that is not clear as of yet is the criteria the
producers are going to come up with to explain why.

There are some hints, however.  When Richard approaches Locke about
the &quot;Cooper problem,&quot; he hints that he thinks that Ben's priorities
have been misplaced, what with all of the fixation on the pregnancy
issue.  This may account for the cancer.  Locke himself guesses that
Ben is wondering why he's not healing as fast as he thinks he should
be. Again, it could be that Ben's no longer walking the right path and
once Locke reminds him of it, Ben heals right up.

If Richard is indeed not aging and is part of a number of Others who
aren't aging (and, again, this hasn't really been established IMO, but
I have a gut feeling that's where the producers are going), he's
probably been around long enough to know what the mysterious
&quot;criteria&quot; is.

I think it's a bit more simple than that.  Just going on what we saw

Craphole may have simply allowed Ben to manifest &quot;Jacob&quot; as some kind
of bizarre father figure.

Bottom line is, of course, that the producers are playing the
ambiguity card as they always do, in order for new (and better) ideas
to perhaps come along without directly contradicting what has gone
before.

I agree with this wholeheartedly. Especially since Ben is a known
liar, anything that comes from him either directly or indirectly has
to be suspected of being false.   The writers can easily erase
anything he ever said as being a lie.

Trying to build a whole mythology of the island granting agelessness
to people who sacrifice another person is an OK theory, but the
foundation isn't that strong.

I think there were enough clues scattered around to make us believe
that all is not well between Ben and most of the rest of them. Juliet
started it in the first six episodes and it's continued right up to
the point where Tom questions Ben's orders that the hostages not be
shot.  Neither Richard nor Tom intevene when Locke beats the crap out
of Mikhail even when Ben obviously wants them to.  I think the fact
that Ben got cancer in the first place is a pretty strong indication
that all is not well.  Locke brings that up also.

Then there's the reaction of Cindy and the rest of 'em when they learn
of Locke's &quot;cure&quot; and his seeming connection to the island.  Seems
they are waiting for someone and some of them think Locke may be that
someone, which begs the question &quot;where does that leave Ben?&quot;

In that light, I see Richard going to Locke and suggesting an
alternative as just another piece of that puzzle.  He knows Locke will
never be able to off Cooper on his own, but also realizes that Locke
will always be emotionally handicapped as long as Cooper lives. This
may well be why Ben &quot;brought&quot; Cooper to Craphole in the first place
(assuming the &quot;magic box&quot; is just another lie).

I'm hoping the producers aren't going to go down the &quot;chosen one&quot;
route as that's a bit cliched, but the Others do seem to be run like a
cult - I wouldn't be a bit surprised to find out they have some kind
of prophesy thing going..

It could simply be a matter of familiarity over logic.  If, as in
&quot;Lost Horizon,&quot; some part of the area itself (and not some guiding
intelligence) grants agelessness, it would stand to reason that the
longer those particular characters stayed in that area, they would age
at a reduced rate.  Think of it like a &quot;fountain of youth&quot; where you

to say that Richard (and maybe a few other Others) live most of their
lives in another part of the island (the &quot;temple,&quot; maybe?) that grants
them agelessness so long as they stay there?

I was with you up to this point. Sure there have been indications that
everybody is not on board with Ben's agenda, but he has been known to
have devious plans before, so I will wait and see how that plays out.
But then comes a huge leap that only parts of the island grant these
extraordinary abilities.   The more unknown variables you have to put
in a theory, the less likely it becomes.  Who's to say it isn't true?
Well, the burden of proof is on it being true since the show has not
even remotely hinted at it.

Granted, there was a lot of noise this season about dissention among
the Others, but that could indicate a lot of things that has nothing
to do with the whole aging issue.
