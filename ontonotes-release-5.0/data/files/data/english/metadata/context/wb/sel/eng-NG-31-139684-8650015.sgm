That newbie would be me, of course. :)

I'm having a little trouble finding a clear direction to take.  I'm actually
not a complete newbie.  I've played on GNU off and on for a year or two, and
pretty casually online - low 1700's on the Zone.  When it comes to equity
calculations, how and when to use them, cube decisions, etc. I am a newbie.

So this weekend I decided to try and take the game more seriously and learn
what it takes to get better.  I was reading a lot of Phil Simborg, who had a
story about playing for 20 years before getting serious, finding out that
the game is all about the calculations.  I figure, &quot;great,&quot; I'm good with
numbers and formulas and adding this element to my game might be exactly
what I need to improve.

Having said all this above, I find myself in a state of &quot;paralysis by
analysis&quot;!  By surfing through the web, reading whatever seems relevant, I
find that I'm pretty confused now.  Much of the information I have found
online is not all that clearly presented, and I lose a sense of what a good
player really needs to be able to do during a match.

Can anyone recommend a book or online source that provides a clear method
that a low-intermediate player like myself can take to become better?  When
I play now, I feel like I'm wasting time because I know there is so much
more to the game I need to learn, but haven't found a good source of
information to help me learn these things in a straightforward way.

Hope that all made sense, and thanks for any suggestions!

What helped me most was using the GNUBG match analysis feature - that
will help you detect your most glaring weak points.  It's also helpful
to play humans who are strong and weak, and ask yourself about the
differences in their play.  I keep a &quot;little black book&quot; with what I
consider to be crucial information, though of course as you get
better, some of the information will become obvious to you.  If you
keep such a book, you want to note things like when to double with a
mid point anchor versus a bar point anchor, when you have the pip
count lead, of course.  One thing that is common for novices is to
double when it's too good to double, for example (no Jacoby rule
matches), whereas I like to hold off against weak players, then if
they get lucky, double then, when they are still &quot;shell shocked.&quot;  It
works more than 50% of the time, if I had to guess.

I'd also suggest you decide upon whether you want to be a match player
or a money game player, unless you really want to do both on a regular
basis.  I've recently played a lot of weak players in 9 point matches
at BGR, and I'll point out that the weaknesses vary greatly from one
player to another, so it's difficult to say what you should study,
assuming you know the &quot;basics.&quot;  You are welcome to play me in one of
these small stakes matches at BGR - I'm usually there after 10:30 PM,
New York City time.  If you play, I'll explain what areas of your game
I think need the most work after the match is finished (they have a
general chat area on the site, so it's easy to do).

First thing to get out of the way ... most threads here @ RGB turn
into some form or another of &quot;Monty bashing&quot;.  Often deserved though I
can't understand why people don't simply ignore him.  He's a good
source of entertainment if that's all you read his postings for.

After that, to your actual question.  I maintain backgammon forums
where daily positions/problems are posted and analyzed a few of the
finest players around.  These forums are completely free and HTML
enabled, allowing you to post your own positions quite nicely.
(there's a feature in GNU that allows you to specifically export the
positions in HTML form)  There is no spam, annoying ads, or any other
drawback that I can see aside from putting up with me there.  I don't
know why everyone who is here @ RGB hasn't migrated to my forums.  The
only explanation is they can't stand me, which is fair enough =)

My forums (and site): http://wwww.bgonline.org/forums/

If you have never read a backgammon book, even if you have been
playing for a couple of years, I highly recommend reading Backgammon
by Paul Magriel.  This book was written almost 30 years ago but the
concepts presented and the clear &amp; concise way they are presented are
a must for anyone looking to play the game beyond pushing checkers
around.  After that book I'd recommend Backgammon Boot Camp by Walter
Trice.  Another medium range level book covering a wide variety of
topics.  After these first two books there are many directions to go
depending on what you're looking for.  There is also a ton of free
information available on the web and a nice collection of backgammon
players willing to help.

If you have any other questions I really do prefer my forums because
of the formatting, I'm not simply trying to drag ppl there.  Feel free
to post over there or email me with any questions.

The first link on your list (reading from top to bottom) is far from
ridiculous.

Yes, the problem is easy -- it's no double.

But the potential doubler does have an attack, so a pass would not be
amazing from a very weak player.

Note that, in this thread, Monty does _not_ make outrageous claims
about his own ability.  Nor does he imply that a server must be fixed
because he lost a position he should have won etc. etc.

What he really did was to pose a problem which is exactly what we need
more of.

Paul:

When dealing with a &quot;rubber room boy,&quot; keep in mind the following:

1. Human reason is of no use.

2. Logic is to be discarded.

3. Digressions from backgammon-related issues are expected.

4. Inane or ludicrous accusations are welcome.

5. To do otherwise is to open yourself up to attack.

There is more information online than anywhere but the nice part about
books is the organizational aspect.  It's presented in a developing
way and much easier to follow than you hunting down this, that, and
the other to try to improve your game.  I also hold strong to that
like with anything, whether it be backgammon or basketball or learning
another language, the fundamentals are of ginormous importance.  If
you get down the basics 110% you'll be better than 95% of the people
out there already.  That's why I think it's a must to read these books
if you've never read them even if most of the material may be old hat
for you.

Look forward to seeing you postwhore =)

I often play 9 point matches for $2, to keep me focused.  If you are
playing in the 1700s, then you should win your fair share.  Go to
www.backgammonroom.com and follow the instructions.  I also have a few
euros left in a TMG ( www.truemoneygames.com ) account, so that's
possible too.

Money games are where you will get &quot;hustled.&quot;  You might get lucky for
a while and think you are great, but then you lose a lot and think
your opponent was just lucky, and you keep playing people who are
clearly superior.  In matches, you can tell if you are far inferior to
your opponent, and then you simply avoid that person in the future if
you like.  Skill is more important in matches, as you have to know
about match equities.  3 point matches are easy to understand, but
when you get to 9 pointers, there will be situations where it's a
redouble and pass at 9 away, 5 away, for example, that are no double/
takes if it's 9A, 9A.

Aside from using GNUBG's match analysis feature, it's important not to
think about luck.  If an aggressive player gets very lucky in the
first few games, you might start to play too timidly, for instance.

Stick,

You're obviously a strong player (to say the least).

How much of Magriel is known to be wildly wrong?

I would think the answer is &quot;Quite a bit of it&quot; but I'm not sure.

For instance, there's a section saying you shouldn't readily give up
your opponent's 5 point to hit.

Yet world-class players are usually happy to sacrifice the golden
point in order to hit, and so are the bots.

Should this book really be recommended?

Also, I don't really believe in the too-many-points concept.

If I had seven points (the maximum) I wouldn't generally complain.

It's not that Magriel's bad -- it's that there are so many books which
don't offer advice which is known to consist of serious conceptual
errors.

So the OP should stick with Trice, Robertie etc. and pay close
attentioh to the rgb wisdom of Raccoon, Adam Tansley and Bob Koca et
al.

(And ignore everything I say because I'm not any good.)

While the answers to a lot of Magriel's stuff may be wrong (though I'd
toss out the adjective) it's the concepts that are priceless.  You
shouldn't read this book and take it word for word as the absolute
correct way to play bg, you should be able to gain an invaluable
amount of knowledge from it though.  (as you should with any book on
bg)  It's well thought out, nicely organized, and as I said, many of
the concepts still hold water today.

I agree that more often than not one should not hold anchor if there's
the option of hitting and Magriel probably gets this wrong though I'm
unable to check the section you're speaking of having loaned out my
copy once again.  There are many times it is correct to retain the
anchor, it depends, as most situations do, on the details of the
position.  It's a fair statement to say though that you should leave
your anchor to hit.

TMP, or too many points, is a concept much like duplication.  Useful
at times but sometimes overused.  You need to know when TMP is really
TMP (inflexibility in a position where flexibility is a must) and when
it's plain sweet to have 7 points lol.  Like I was trying to get
across, I think Backgammon the book is a must for any player looking
to get serious with the game.  It provides a solid foundation to build
on.  It gets you thinking about backgammon and it doesn't overwhelm
you.  You'll come away with a sense of having learned a lot and in
doing so hopefully you will question a lot of the examples given and
discern for yourself not only that it is wrong and things have changed
over 30 years, but the rational behind both plays and why one play is
better than the other.

&gt; &gt; you get down the basics 110% you'll be better than 95% of the people
&gt; &gt; out there already.  That's why I think it's a must to read these books
&gt; &gt; if you've never read them even if most of the material may be old hat
&gt; &gt; for you.

&gt; &gt; Look forward to seeing you postwhore =)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Stick - Thanks a lot for your reply.  I didn't see it at first because I had
&gt; &gt; &gt; all yahoo accounts blocked by my filter.  A newsgroup I used to go to for
&gt; &gt; &gt; years was attacked by a psychotic troll, and has laid it to waste.  Maybe in
&gt; &gt; &gt; time it will rebound, but there are so many interative websites now that
&gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroups are starting to seem archaic.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll start with the two books you recommend.  Even though the internet is an
&gt; &gt; &gt; amazing resource, sometimes a good old fashioned book is the best way to
&gt; &gt; &gt; learn.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Your website wouldn't come up, until I noticed the &quot;wwww.&quot; typo!  It looks
&gt; &gt; &gt; like a great site and I'm sure you'll see me posting more annoying questions
&gt; &gt; &gt; there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again,

&gt; Stick,

&gt; You're obviously a strong player (to say the least).

&gt; How much of Magriel is known to be wildly wrong?

&gt; I would think the answer is &quot;Quite a bit of it&quot; but I'm not sure.

&gt; For instance, there's a section saying you shouldn't readily give up
&gt; your opponent's 5 point to hit.

&gt; Yet world-class players are usually happy to sacrifice the golden
&gt; point in order to hit, and so are the bots.

&gt; Should this book really be recommended?

&gt; Also, I don't really believe in the too-many-points concept.

&gt; If I had seven points (the maximum) I wouldn't generally complain.

&gt; It's not that Magriel's bad -- it's that there are so many books which
&gt; don't offer advice which is known to consist of serious conceptual
&gt; errors.

&gt; So the OP should stick with Trice, Robertie etc. and pay close
&gt; attentioh to the rgb wisdom of Raccoon, Adam Tansley and Bob Koca et
&gt; al.

&gt; (And ignore everything I say because I'm not any good.)

You shouldn't read *any* book and take it word for word as the
absolute correct way to play bg.  Every book that has ever been
written is wrong in some way.  Learn to read critically, and
think about what the author is saying rather than just taking it
as truth because it's printed on a page.

&gt;&gt; I'd also suggest you decide upon whether you want to be a match player
&gt;&gt; or a money game player, unless you really want to do both on a regular

&gt; In a nutshell, what's the difference?
">

One of the main differences between match play and money play comes from the
difference the match score can make in your strategy.
The fact that the entire match will end when a certain score is reached
creates the need to play much more aggressively or conservatively at certain
scores , and it can change the value that gammons have and most importantly
can sometimes wildly change the value of the cube.  So unlike open ended
money games where your mathematical takepoint is always fixed and unchanged
,  the point where you double or take a cube can change by a great ammount
in matches.

*note : I would disregard thinking about this too much though ,  until you
are fairly comfortable with cubes in regular money games.

In general ,  you want to be more aggressive when you are behind (double and
take easier)  and more conservative when you are ahead (double later and
take less cubes)  if you want to get into the math of it there is some good
info on match equity etc. the net and Kit Woolsey wrote a book called 'how
to play tournament backtamon' that is all about adjusting for the score
..... but seriously ,  I wouldn't recommend you get into thinking about this
too much until you have read  Magriel and Trice at least and are confident
with the concepts in money games.

There is a very broad set of skills that apply to both match and money so if
you just keep interested and keep playing you don't have to worry too much
about his trying to confuse you.

That seems like the key point - that money games are open ended.  I
understand that match games have an end, whereas I guess money games are
just played in individual games.  I would have thought that money games were
played to a certain number as well.  For example, you might play matches to
15 for $100, or whatever.  In this case, it seems match play strategy would
be the same as for the &quot;money game.&quot;

But, I understand that the difference isn't of major importance to me at
this point.

Thanks!

Yeah , that's the point I skipped right over ..... when we talk about the
difference between matches and moneygames ,  we are NOT talking about
whether or not you bet money on the game etc. A match is a match to a
certain score ,  a moneygame is an open ended session that doesn't have a
score ....  I guess it can be confusing but people usually just call open
ended sessions 'moneygames'  rather than labelling them 'sessions' or
something else that would be more appropriate.
When games are open ended the mathematical give and take points are fixed.
when there is a match score these points can move around ... I guess that's
all I'm really trying to say.
