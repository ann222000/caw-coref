Having Nasal Surgery?
Christopher Martin, N.C.S.P.
Cold Tree Press

The nose is an organ of the human body that can be afflicted with a
number of serious ailments to health. These problems include such
conditions as rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and empty nose
syndrome (ENS). It has only been in recent years that physicians have
come to understand and treat ENS. But there are still a great many
doctors unfamiliar with this syndrome and the treatment options that
sufferers have to choose from. An ENS sufferer himself, Christopher
Martin has written a comprehensive and thoroughly 'reader friendly'
introduction to what ENS is, and what can be done about it, and what
to be aware of in various treatment options in &quot;Having Nasal Surgery:
Don't You Become An Empty Nose Victim!&quot;. Christopher relates his own
personal account of coping with ENS, offers an informed and
informative evaluation of turbinate surgeries with respect to nasal
conditions, provides an 'insider' look at the politics surrounding ENS
within the medical community, and identifies the best treatments for
ENS, many of which are also efficaciously applicable to sinusitis,
allergic rhinitis, postnasal drip, GERD, and asthma. Invaluable
reading for medical students, physicians, and non-specialist general
readers, &quot;Having Nasal Surgery&quot; is especially recommended for
personal, professional, and community library Health &amp; Medicine
reference collections and reading lists.

EXPOSED: THE TOXIC CHEMISTRY OF EVERYDAY PRODUCTS AND WHAT'S AT STAKE
FOR AMERICAN POWER considers not just a local or even a national
issue, but one which could result in a global economic power shift
with long-reaching repercussions for U.S. business and consumers
alike. Specifically, new demands by the European Union upon
corporations for stricter environmental regulations have resulted in
product improvements and new guidelines - in turn affecting a new
economic model which is, unexpectedly, financially rewarding. Both
business and health libraries at either the college or public lending
levels will find EXPOSED considers the accompanying shift of power
which has occurred as a result, exploring recent changes in the EU and
showing how the U.S. will lose its commercial supremacy and
competitive advantage unless it follows suit with products safer for
both the environment and human use. EXPOSED is an eye-opening expose.

this solid reference highly recommended for the personal bookshelves
