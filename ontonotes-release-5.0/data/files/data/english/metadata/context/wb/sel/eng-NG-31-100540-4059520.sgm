My daughter is mad at me because I will not install one of those $100
remote start after market options she bought at Circuit City on her 96
Grand Am. I am afraid that some night in the dead of winter a
connection will go bad leaving her stranded. There must be 20
connections that need to be made to the ignition, starter, door locks
and theft deterrent system. Anyone have experience with such a system?
Is my concern unwarranted?

Loose connections may not be much of a problem if the job is done correctly.
I have a 94 Grand Prix that had one and always have problems with the
ignition circuit acting like there is an intermittent connection.  I ripped
all the wiring from the remote starter out from under the dash, but left the
control module so I could unlock the doors and trunk remotely.

I also had one on a 96 Bravada that was installed by a dealer.  I started
having a problem with the check engine light coming on and Oldsmobile
recommended that the remote starter be taken off.

I guess to sum it up, if you make solid connections to the ignition wiring
and don't just hack it up, that part should be OK.  As far as the remote
starter causing other problems to the computer system, that's another story.
GM doesn't seem to recommend it, so it's up to you.   I've heard of some
people having them and haven't had any problems.

Good Luck

I've installed them. I will be putting one on my Trans Sport. I just
put one on my wife's Mystique.
Properly done there is NO chance of them affecting either the computer
or the operation of the engine. A bad connection MAY cause the remote
to stop working. On some vehicles bad connections could cause problems
with the power locks.

The remote starter, unless you chose to install the starter lockout
option, is totally wired in parallel with the ignition switch.
On some units a tachometer connection is required.

The connections MUST be soldered - and the wires are just stripped for
the connection, not cut. The connections must be well taped. I like
liquid electrical tape. Heat srink is OK IF you seal up the end where
two wires exit with the liquid tape - otherwise the connector is still
"open". Good vinyl tape, properly applied (stretched) does better than
heat shrink.

Definitely NOT a job for an amateur - and you want to pick your
installer very carefully.
It is also connected in parallel with the break switch.
