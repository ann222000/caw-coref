Had to do this one, 12 is my number... ;-)

Ambulance
Vehicle
1 pool
After a combat between this acting minion and a blocking minion, you may tap
the Ambulance to continue the action as if unblocked. If the action is
blocked again, burn this card. This minion may tap the Ambulance to attempt
to burn an incapacitated imbued as a +1 stealth action. A minion may have
only one vehicle.

This is pretty cool. Im not sure for which kind of deck this is
especially usefull, but it has a lot of potential. I guess this is
some new form of stealth or slease. should be cool in a bruise and
bleed deck. first punch the blocker in the face, then continue the
bleed for 3 or punch another idiot in the face. lol

Also the secondary ability is nice. I like it when anti strategies are
offered in &quot;general usefull&quot; cards. In other words; I would not play
anti cards if they dont support my main strategy at all.

Now, my opinion...

Effect 1 : well, you have to equip with it, sure, but it's a very nice bloc
denial effect ! No younger requirement either... I'm thinking Repo Man,
here, and this might just help clans without stealth and / or decks based on
block denial with few options (like the Giovanni), and / or deck with
stealth in a very intercept heavy environment. On the whole, from what I've
seen of this extension, I'd say intercept is pretty much screwed again.
Can't say it disturns me too much either.

Effect 2 : it is now plain obvious that the game conceptors heard our
worries ! The Imbued had a few issues to be rectified, and it looks better
and better now :
- Champion made them nigh untouchable, now the Dom card can burn them if
they enter combat
- Ambulance has a good first use, and its second one deals with the &quot;the
Imbued are too resilient&quot; part

Not to mention anti-gehenna cards, etc.

Now if Memories is fixed (and fixed !) in the Giovanni starter, they'll just
be a good, balanced option and everyone will be happy (even if I still hate
the principle of creating crypt cards non affected by so  many core cards of
the game).

Interesting, not what I was expecting from Ambulance.  I was thinking
something for moving guys from torpor or gaining blood - but this is
cool.  Good for stealth decks to get past walls.  The secondary
ability is odd too, not something one would prescribe to an
ambulance.  Wouldn't that be more a hearse?

But anyway, I can see good uses for this card.

You're a Vampire. You have some limited control over hopital personnel, and
you can have an ambulance available at your command. You go and attack an
Imbued, knowing that he'll be hard to kill righ away (for whatever reason an
Imbued is so hard to kill in combat by a vampire, but you know...). So you
send an ambulance to pick him up, and finish him.

Not a bad explanation...
When I first saw Ambulance on the list I was thinking something that
would allow any minion to rescue a vampire from torpor or something
like that, for 0 blood.

I very much like the first effect. A disciplineless Mirror Image that
costs a pool and an action. In theory it's reusable, in practice, if
you got blocked the first time, you're likely to get blocked again.

Also note that the second part of ambulance is not the same action as
the rules-card action to burn an incapacitated imbued. If I'm reading
that right, it means nobody can burn Convictions to punish the
offending minion.

The second ability is straight out of a horror movie. One of the
heroes goes down, they get 'rescued' by an ambulance and as they drive
away, the protagonist yells &quot;Quick! To the hospital, we're losing
him!&quot; Then the driver slowly turns his head and grins... (ambulance
fades into the disctance).

Absolutely brilliant, props to LSJ!

I have been waiting for a card with this effect
_since_Jyhad_first_came_out_.

(The first effect, not the second, obviously.)

Took ya'll long enough.

This is a good card. This set is shaping up nicely.

I find the uncharacteristic lack of negative criticism I have for this
set to be deeply disturbing.

By the way, this is the first card in a long time that I've seen help
a bruise-bleed or a bruise-vote archetype, and it manages to help them
both.

Once you've generated the stealth to get the vehicle out, you're
golden.

Now, if the Powers That Be would be so kind: reprint Repo Man.

Yes, I haven't liked much about the vamps I saw (but big vamps are hard to
play, especially in those clans...), but the library cards are very nice
indeed. The Aim cards are the ones I like less, but the other ones offer
plenty of new options, that's good. Hope the rest of the set is up to par !

Sure. You can also Summon Repo Man, no more stealth on first action but
easier to get...

Well, that kinda depends on circumstance. Like Mirror Image, if you're
using a wake to block, the waking minion can just re-block with the
same intercept (burning the Ambulance and wasting the Angel and the
pool). Even if you weren't waking, you can play the wake on the now-
tapped original blocker and re-block with the same intercept.

I'm definitely liking the card, but I actually expect it'd be better
for combat decks (or bruise-and-X decks). The same guy can only re-
block you if he's still ready, and even if someone does block again,
well, that just means you get to kill an extra minion, right?

Hmm. That doesn't actually confirm whether burning an Imbued with the
Ambulance triggers the conviction damage effect. It is clear that if you
take the zero stealth default &quot;burn incapacitated Imbued&quot; action, and
succeed, you can get damaged by conviction. Is the action granted by the
Ambulance the same action?

It's also clear that if you take the default &quot;burn an incapacitated
imbued&quot; action, you get their equipment, which ambulance does not
explicity allow.

Part of the reason this is unclear is that there's no rule term for
the action-type (like there is for &quot;diablerie&quot;), which means that it's
unclear if the Conviction rule is meant to apply to *any* action that
specifically burns incapacitated imbued, or just the rule-action.

I mean, it's pretty clear that you have to apply the consequences of
diablerie whenever the card text indicates you're committing
diablerie, but not on any other actions that burn torpored vampires
(like Sacrificial Lamb, for example).

It is not the pillowface action, as witness1 has already noted (not being &quot;that
action&quot; most primarily, just as superior Enchant Kindred is not the same action
as inferior The Call, but also observable via the Ambulance action not bestowing
equipment from the Imbued).

Quincy's action is also not a pillowface action.

And recruiting a War Ghoul and sacrificing an Imbued for it doesn't qualify as a
pillowface action.

Similarly, if Callirus burns a blood to burn a Memories of Mortality on him
during his untap phase, he doesn't go to torpor.

And if Ian has an Infernal Familiar and uses his own special ability to play
Eyes of the Dead, the Familiar doesn't get an investment counter.

And the inherent action to move Emissary is not the same action as a Shadow of
Taint action to move it.

And so on with the other parallels that have not been an issue until now.

I'll happily directly answer any question about any ambiguous situation,
newly-introduced or no.

For the non-ambiguous cases (see a recent thread about conceding), a &quot;teach a

Sure. Bruise and bleed decks like it. But the fact that it gives you a
&quot;form of mist at super&quot; type effect can be really useful for some
other strategies that rely on being blocked and then doing other
stuff. For example, I have a setitie, I bleed you with Social Charm.
You block? No stealth, you got me. First I play Venenation, to give
you a corruption counter. Now we're in combat, I play Majesty at
super, SCE and untap. Combat is over; I tap my Ambulance, action
continues. If you're still waking up or have another minion, sure, try
to block; I Play my Lost in Crowds / Faceless Night / Elder
Impersonation. Bleed goes through, I play Revelation of Desire to burn
the corruption counter for +3 bleed. And hey guess what, my guy is
untapped from Majesty! So I can go do something else... like um.... play
Enticement. Yeah lose another 3 pool.

Or say Aching Beuaty on a Toreador (Suzanne Kadim anyone?? I hear obf
and +1 bleed are useful for bleeding, let alone dom). No need for
change of target anymore, you can Beauty AND bleed them, in the same
action. You block my Legal Manipulations, you lose pool from Aching
Beauty, now I Majesty, tap ambulance and continue the bleed, Aire of
Elation. That's what, 8 pool? With only one A.B.? Madness. Hopefully
another dude tries to block again so you can make them burn more pool
from A.B. and then stealth it with obf. Also she can play Aura Reading
at basic before she majesties to see if they have flick (i.e. to
stealth/aire or not to stealth/aire).

Or PRO multi-rush but without the need to Psyche. Rumble or Taunt
someone, if they block you, great! Earth Meld, tap Ambulance, continue
the action to enter combat with them, beat the snot out of them, and
you're untapped from the Earth Meld, so go rush someone else. Of
course the trick won't really work more than a couple of times since
people will just stop blocking your rushes.

Great for corruption.
Corrupt someone, get blocked, Venenate them, tap the Ambulance,
corrupt them anyway.
Or the settites can now use the Form of Mist/Venenate/Revelation of
Desire trick without needing PRO.

Bleed, blocked, Venenate, S:CE, continue in ambulance and stealth it
up to use Revelation for the uber bleed.

Yep, I mentioned that one above.

Another good Ambulance-Corruption (what a great name) strategy is with
the new guy, Nakthorteb or whatever he's called. Bleed, if they block
play Venenation, Majesty, tap the Ambulance. Oh wow that guy can't
block me anymore because you have a corruption counter... someone else
want to block? Stealth it past him. Untap from his special, play
Enticement.

Other funny stuff: &quot;burn a blood to attempt to block&quot; effects such as
Dominion, Tenebrous Form (Lasombra Black Hand deck anyone?), &quot;burn a
blood before / during / after combat&quot; effects like Darkness Within,
totally whacky block stuff like Loose Cannon at thau (muahaha)...

Auspex/Thaum/Obten seems to be pretty dripping with opportunities
here; Shadow Twin someone, if they try to block play croc tongue, once
in combat go darkness within and/or theft of vitae, after combat tap
ambulance and Twin-ping them (probably into the bin).
Also remember the great thing about Dominion is that the &quot;burn a
blood&quot; thing is a requirement of a block attempt, not an effect, so if
after combat they don't have any blood left they can't even attempt to
block you if you tap the ambulance.

There is probably a host of evil things that can be done with
Mask1Kfaces too. E.g. vampire with scary combat bleeds, if someone
blocks beat them up, tap the ambulance to continue the action, now
someone with obf plays mask to continue the bleed. The first guy
untaps and the process begins again.

Actually that's an interesting question. I control Vampire A who has
an ambulance and bleeds. He is blocked. After combat, he taps the
ambulance to continue the action. Before block attempts can be made,
my Vampire B who has obfuscate plays Mask of a Thousand Faces to
continue the action. He then gets blocked. Does Vampire A's ambulance
burn?

IANLSJ, but I would say that it is burned.  Ambulance mentions if this
action is blocked again, not if this minion is blocked attempting this
action again.  I believe that Mask still treats it as the original
action, but I could be wrong, and I can't be bothered looking it up.

On the subject of Sutekh's Chosen, the natural combo is Hiereophant.
That card was vexing: why would a stealth clan get a block penalty
effect (though a strong one)? Now it finally comes together. Drop
Hiereophants and an ambulance on Sutekh himself. Send a chump to Tempt
your Predator's vampire. It gets blocked. Sutekh Masks in, Typhonics,
Grapples, and slaps the victim with Cobra Fangs. The Hiereophant burns
the target down to nil and the Fangs garauntees torpor. Any stealth
card played by the previous minion can be re-played now because Sutekh
is a different minion, so stealthing further is not a problem. The
victim is Tempted and Truth of 1k Lies untaps. Not bad for a night's
work.

Venantion can be comboed with Revelation of Wrath, the most efficient
(via number of tokens) way of getting Corruption on a foe. Nehsi comes
in riding in an Ambulance having been given an Aus skill card, putting
him at superior, laying down a Revelation of Ectasy and Weighing the
Heart. Blocked, he resorts first to Crocodile's Tongue, then to
Approximation of Loyalty, then to Venenation, and then to Revelation
of Wrath. Sucking down damage with Fortitude, he wishes his opponent
an overly-fond farewell and stealths the rest of the action through. 2
Blood, 1 Pool, at least 3 Corruption, one action.

This can all combo with the Hiereophant stuff _and_ the Mask stuff,
too. You could throw a _lot_ of Corruption in one action.

FoS could go light on the Stealth; they have a lot of scary stuff they

And if you can keep victims tapped, Regarhagan's Hold becomes obscene.
Use Faceless and the cost of their Wakes/Qui/Forceds begin to mount.

&gt; &gt; Sure. But as the guy whose job it is to answer questions, it often makes
&gt; &gt; sense to just answer the question rather than being unnecessarily
&gt; &gt; oblique. If for no other reason than it is a nice thing to do and is
&gt; &gt; less likely to be misinterpreted. Especially in a situation where new
&gt; &gt; ambiguous rules are being introduced.

&gt; I'll happily directly answer any question about any ambiguous situation,
&gt; newly-introduced or no.

&gt; For the non-ambiguous cases (see a recent thread about conceding), a &quot;teach a
&gt; man to fish&quot; approach may well be better in the long term, even if it doesn't
&gt; appear &quot;nice&quot; at first glance (as opposed to after examination).

But it also does not lead to easy support for a ruling needed at a
game if there is no definitive answer by the head judge, especially if
the answer has to be translated into numerous languages, something far
easier tpo do with a definite :It is x&quot; type answer.
