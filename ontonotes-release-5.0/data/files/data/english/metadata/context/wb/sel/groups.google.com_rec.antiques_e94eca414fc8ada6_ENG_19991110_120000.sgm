When purchasing antiques in the States it is customary to expect to pay
somewhat less than the &quot;asking&quot; price from an antique retailer. Is this also
true in Paris? Any ideas on a &quot;rule of thumb&quot; to expect? i.e. 80% of asking
price? Thanks!

To be serious, advice for all our American cousins, when in Europe,
forget all this retail, booking price, Martha Stewart, and what one would
&quot;expect&quot; nonsense, if you adopt this kinda attitude you'll get well and
truly ripped.

Look at the stuff, if you are REALLY interested, ask the dealer &quot;what he
needs&quot; for the item then take it from there, if it's still too much after
the haggling, then bid the dealer YOUR price, start the haggling again
and with a bit of luck and good humour you'll both settle somewhere in
the middle. Splitting the difference is what we call it over here. At the
end of the day, if you both can't agree on the price then no hard
feelings, you'll do a deal maybe the next time around. Don't burn your
bridges or cut your nose off to spite your face.

Best of luck. ;&gt;)

btw Jon .. have you ever tossed a coin to close the deal. Ya know, the
dealer sticks on a 100 quid you bid 80 quid as the best, and you both
toss a coin for it, heads for his oner or tails for your 80 quid bid?

Except for the rolling dice or flipping a coin to decide a price, things
are pretty much the same over here. It's against the law in Texas to
offer a lower price for cash than you offer for a credit card (don't ask
me why, it's never made any sense to me either) but in practice you
always get a slightly better deal for cash.

Most dealers build in a little negotiating room, and how low they're
willing to go bears a direct realtionship to how long the piece has been
gathering dust, and an inverse relationship to the amount they've
already sold that month. You also get a better deal right before the
rent is due on a slow month.

About a year ago, the mall where we used to sell &amp; work
changed their policy regarding credit card purchases. If
you charged your purchase, you were not entitled to the 10%
dealer's discount because the seller was charged a fee.

Years back when we checked into leasing a credit card
machine, we were told that it was illegal to charge the card
user the fee we had to pay whenever someone charged
something. I would expect the store owner to be responsible
for paying this fee.

Anyone else had this experience?

"/> Listen over here, if you're a dealer or claim to be a dealer and then
produce a CC to pay for the deal, after the deal is struck, after the
haggle, after the spit on the hand, you'll be told, in no uncertain
terms, to F.O and what precisely to do with your CC ... like sideways.

If you deal and expect a reasonable TRADE discount and expect to heavily
haggle (negotiate) over the price, then you are expected to pay with
dirty pounds notes. You'll not be taken seriously as a dealer when paying
with a CC and will be treated as a Joe Public out on a day trip to the
seaside, and offered a **small** token of discount, at best. I personally
DO NOT give ANY discount when a &quot;customer&quot; offers to pay me with a CC.
What I say to a dealer when he/she offers a CC payment, I can't repeated
here.

The antique **trade** is traditionally CASH only. Cash buys discount. ;&gt;)

The difference most people will give you for cash vs. checks or credit
card relates more to what they are charged in fees to use credit cards,
or what they are charged by the company that guarantees the checks.
This isn't going to go over a few percent. The only reason I would give
a $400 discount for cash over check on a $2500 sale would be if I
figured the check was going to bounce.

&gt;&quot;But I'll give you $2100 CASH today&quot;. She couldn't

&gt; though we had an offer of $2300 already. It's not like it
&gt; was a big deal for us to hold the camper &amp; title for the
&gt; couple of days it would take for a check to clear. Turned

If I remember correctly, at least in Texas this law came into being when
credit cards primarily meant the cards issued by the gas companies and
the department stores. It was looked upon as a way to avoid usury laws
to allow a company to charge extra for the use of a credit card, either
by a direct fee or indirectly by a cash discount. This didn't come up
in Texas for decades, then when the gas stations tried to give discounts
for cash back in the 80's someone at the state attorney general's office
noticed that this was illegal in Texas, and started sending out
threatening letters, which quickly stopped the process. The law doesn't
really make sense in the days of third-party credit card companies like
MasterCard and Visa, but it is a popular law among credit card users and
credit card companies alike, so its chances of being changed are next to
nothing.

Well, then that is a difference, because most dealers over here don't
care what they receive as long as they can put it in the bank. They'll
want to know what you're paying with before they determine how low
they'll go, but it doesn't put you in the category of a non-dealer by
any means.

I have a credit card in my company name that I use for business
purchases, because a lot of auction houses don't like to take checks,
just cash or credit cards. I don't use it to buy from other dealers,
because legal or not, I get a lower price handing them a check. I
generally reserve cash for flea market purchases.

Yes, Ronnie, the ONLY reason. My vast majority of my sales come in one
of two ways, either through my booth, or through eBay. If they come
through my booth, there is a record of the transaction maintained by the
mall, and I receive my money by check from the mall owner. No real way
I could cheat on my taxes if I wanted to. The only advantage I have is
the very small fee the mall charges me on check transactions which is
their fee to the check guarantee service.

If the sale comes through eBay, it is either paid for by check or by
money order, and either way the money goes into the bank, and would be
easily tracable. Cashing the money orders at the post office and then
claiming a lower sales price would be the easiest thing in the world to
raise the suspicions of an auditor, and the records of eBay could
probably be checked if the IRS wanted to push the matter. Having a
smaller profit margin on those transactions where the mode of payment is
postal money order is a dead give-away. Not to say some people don't do
it, but they are taking a very substantial risk.

On the few transactions that are handled outside of eBay and outside of
the mall, again, what do you think an auditor would think if all of your
transactions done in this manner suddenly had a dramatically lower
profit margin than those done through the mall or through eBay?

If I ran my own shop independent of a mall, I like to think would choose
to act in an ethical manner, but as it is the choice is essentially made
for me due to the way my business is transacted, I guess we'll never
know.

Another reason for not relying totally on cash for sales here in the U.S.
Two or three years ago, at one of the major shows in Miami, New England
dealers who had come south to buy with pockets full of one hundred dollar
bills found that none of the dealers doing the show would accept a hundred
dollar bill in payment for anything. It seems that Miami had just been
targeted and was being flooded with some really good, recent counterfeits &amp;
everyone was scared of them. One dealer passing through our town after the
experience told me that he couldn't even find a bank in Miami that would
turn his hundreds into smaller bills so he could spend them. (I thought
banks had to take money.....legal tender being legal &amp; all that...but if
that was true the banks sure wouldn't admit it.)
This last week central Florida has been hit hard with phony twenties. They
supposedly even show the proper internal configurations when held before a
bright light. At my malls we are checking every twenty before we accept it
with some sort of &quot;magic&quot; pen that will streak a phony black and makes a
lighter mark on the good ones. I'm sure it won't be long before the &quot;bad
guys&quot; find a way to outsmart the pens.

I have noticed when it's someone posting from New York or the states
around New York or from the New England area, then I'm usually on the
same wavelength, I can easily identify with the post and not that far
adrift in the reasoning. However (not all the time but most times) when
it's post coming from the wild west or &quot;tinsel town&quot; the dealing/business
and collecting attitude seems so alien to me, in many ways rather naive.
I think Richard missed my point altogether reference the &quot;cash
transaction&quot; within the antique trade and the function it serves and its
underlying meaning.

Why is that? ... got me foxed.

"/> LOL .... counterfeit money isn't unique to your neck of the woods or
indeed to the USA as a whole. We have the same problem over here as well,
mostly 10 and 20 pound notes, not so much a problem with 50s and I don't
believe (??) the Bank of England issue 100 pound notes, although we do,
in both Northern and Southern Ireland.

Counterfeits are in wide circulation, and not confined only to Bank of
England issued notes but to most other UK issued bank notes ... Scottish
and Northern Irish, issued bank notes have the same problem, in fact,
it's a serious problem in Northern Ireland, the reasons for that I will
not go into but counterfeit generally is a problem here in Northern
Ireland, not just money, you name it! .. we probably have it in
counterfeit form. Dave the Yank will know why. ;&gt;))

Shops, from the counter sweetie shop to the High Street retailer such as
Marks and Spencers would employ a small inexpensive device to check bank
notes. Service stations (gas stations) by and large check most notes, and
giving special care to the current waves of particular counterfeits in
circulation at that given moment in time. Recently we (NI) had a large
circulation of funny 5 pound note, YEA fivers!! do you believe that, go
to the trouble to produce funny fivers, and they say crime doesn't pay.

Banks and local police constabularies will keep the businesses and
general public informed as to what the current wave of counterfeit may
be, could be a high circulation of 10 pound notes or 20s, it all depends.
Counterfeits notes easily show up when these small devices are employed.
Banks here would be obligated to change notes, either large notes into
smaller notes, or vice versa, and other bank issued notes into Bank of
England notes. The English prefer Bank of England issued notes rather
that other issued UK notes, although all UK issued notes are legal
tender.

Saying all that, it hasn't changed the attitude to real money over here
one iota, just makes us more aware, and real money, that is cash, as Jon
has already pointed out is King. Cash buys discount and in many cases,
buys it big time. ;)

Just for an example, a client of mine got audited. Ran a convenience
store, handled mainly cash. Used a lot of the cash to buy merchandise.
The auditor took his figures for his purchases, imputed the profit
margin of the average of convenience stores in that area, and handed him
an assessment for the taxes he claimed he owed. To fight it he'd either
have to go to tax court in Washington, or pay the amount in full, then
sue for the overpayment locally in federal court (that was the rule
then, I don't do tax law so its possible it changed). Taking either
course of action would cost him more than just paying. And antique
dealers are a favored target for audits. Still nonsensical? (And by
the way, the general rule is if you make up deductions you get a bill,
if you hide income, they use the threat of indictment.)

I always tell folks that the offer is only at *that* moment at my

offerthe piece at a lower price. Why? Well in the time that you leave,
theyhave rung every other dealer to fish for bids and found out the
item really was only what you offered..or less!!

If they call back and offer me an item I have already bid on at half
my original offer, I won't touch it as I know they can't even get that

localguys to warn them about the 'try-on'...usually leaving the punter

how long she hung on to that!
