My view is that it was a bizarre and heavily tainted season but there
were some very fine performances on track. A few adjustments for
technicalities cannot change this it would simply underline just how
badly the FIA are managing the sport.

In my view Hamilton was the most deserving. Excepting a couple of
notable errors recently, his consistently good but McLaren, who have
done a wonderful job for him all season, let him down in the last two
races.

I'm quite happy to see Kimi win the title. If the points system were
more to my liking he would have won it by more than a single point too.
I don't even begrudge him winning the first race in an illegal car.

It is a consolation prize for the other seasons where he has fought
well but lost out due mainly to poor reliability.

Alonso probably should have and could have won the season but instead
of getting his head down like the professional WDC deserving to command
a $20m price tag, he chose to play the fool like a spoiled child. The
cheating and blackmail were too much for any camels back.

His loss, he simply made Hamilton look better and better. Not least of
all by being soundly outqualified by him again in Brazil.

Kimi, Lewis and Fernando each in different teams next season. If they
can perform at their best and the cars are not too unequal it could be
a great season.

I'm glad this one is over. Not least of all because it is an end to the
pitiful small minded and mostly negative behaviour of so many in this
group.

You're all a bunch of wankers.

(Well it is called the off season isn't it?)

He cheated like hell. He got custom-made rulings from the FIA, he got

He should have been banned from this season and the next.

I think Hamilton had a quite remarkable season. He is very talented, and
drove very well. He was also in the quickest car for much of the season

I don't believe he deserved it because (particularly with the more fair
old points system as you note) and equal reliability Kimi would have won

Yup, sums it up.

Whats sad is the all the nastyness directed towards Hamilton, his family and
Mclaren. Quite stunning infact. These people keep on about Hamilton fan
boys, but the bashers seem to have the majority of threads. I wonder why
they are so nasty, and vitriolic to wards him and the team.

Its sad that these people tarish a great team and driver by thier vile ,
ugly posts here: By driver and team I mean Ferrari and Kimi.

Funny how people I've never seen post here suddenly do so, just to be
nothing more than plain nasty.

Here's a post of mine from another forum that helps explain..

I believe he's disingenuous, one face for the press and another for when
he does the business. For me this started from the interview in the
Malaysia post race press conference, where he said this about Massa:

http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/57942

&quot;but fortunately I was able to trick him into out-braking himself&quot; ...&quot;so
I apologise for that&quot;

If you're any judge of human nature I don't need to say more. If you're
not it's like me saying: &quot;I just made you look like an idiot, such is my
giant intellect - and I'm sorry for doing so. (See - I'm also pretending
to be gracious as well).&quot;

The whole &quot;I love my team&quot; thing, contradicted most obviously by the
actions of Hamilton or his agents in Hungary. Here of course he ignored a
team order and then benefited while *his* team suffered at his
instigation.

Next is that I don't believe for a second that Alonso gets the same
quality of attention that Hamilton gets. Sentiment alone speaks to that.
Now this is fine of course - but not the simultaneous and perpetual line
of driver equality.

Then there's the silver spoon that delivered him into the silver car -
the best McLaren in nearly a decade. Certainly the most reliable one. He
lucked into it, and while I do believe it's likely Alonso contributed
significantly to its setup and in-season development, I don't believe
Hamilton likely to have been as helpful.

Next comes the &quot;monkeys at the back&quot; comment of the drivers at the rear
of the grid during the Monaco race weekend. Another insight into HRH's
psyche. Year one not halfway done and he's treating other drivers like
that?

Finally there is Alonso. On the tracks that matter for drivers - he's
comfortably bettered Hamilton: Silverstone, Monza and Spa. I don't
believe Hamilton is a better driver. He's very good, but I don't think
he's as good as Alonso. And I don't think he'd be in the same relative
position to Alonso in another team.

(I'll also add Hamilton's weaving off the start line earlier in the
season unpunished.)

Eh?  Sensible post other than this bit..  Alonso expresses himself in
a genuine manner?  Blackmail, tantrums, whining, prattling to the
Spanish press about English favouritism then turning around and saying
&quot;I don't believe any of that&quot; then turning back to the Spanish press
and saying &quot;Yes I do&quot;?  While you'd expect all of that to a degree
from racing car drivers, Alonso has been the world champion this year.

Spygate aside, I'm not sure it's been that significant a season in
terms of FIA and how they appear to be managing things.

I'm not even sure that Spygate was that badly handled - with
allegations of teams spying on each other FIA had to investigate to
protect the reputation of the sport. With news of Coughlan having
Ferrari documents at his home it would have looked far worse for the
sport if FIA did nothing.

But we haven't had a driver's strike, haven't had nonsense about lead
weights in fuel tanks, water cooled brakes, measurements of
bargeboards or teams having to surrender their ECU software to the FIA
for inspection.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the point of view of governance it wasn't a great season, but it

wasn't unusually poor either. And governance of F1 does not reside
entirely with FIA. The Concord Agreement has much to do with the
running of F1, and that puts some of the responsibility with the
teams. It's not FIA's fault that the Prodrive entry seems likely to
collapse at a very late stage.

The requirement for each car to run both tyres during the race is a
contrivance that I could do without.

Massa, Raikkonen and Alonso all outscored LH in the 2nd half of the

Kimi, for me, was the outstanding driver of the year. And the year was
a refreshing change because there were 4 drivers in the championship
until quite late in the season, and 3 in the last round. Kimi was the
guy who showed real speed this year, and I think that as the pressure
built in the  season he handled the pressure the best.

Alonso and Raikkonen both were the more lauded drivers in their teams
but also new to the team and had adjustments to make. As the season
went on they both started to outperform their teammates. It was a
season where experience and resilience counted for a lot.

It will be interesting to see how Raikkonen performs against Massa
next year.

Well... to be fair, Villeneuve didn't have to worry about any other
team. The Williams was clearly the best car of the year, and the best
driver (Schumacher) was in a bum car (the Ferrari) and unlikely to
trouble Williams.

So one could argue that Hamilton had to deal with stiffer opposition.
Even if you accept the argument that McLaren gave him preferential
treatment, there was nothing that McLaren could do to control Massa or
Raikkonen.

So maybe the comparison with Villeneuve in 1996 doesn't hold up that
well.

No. But I might not have expressed myself clearly. I don't think this
season was remarkable for suddenly showing FIA as being chaotic and
opaque and puzzling. None of this is that new. Things were more or
less the same under Balestre.

And I believe that FIA were absolutely right to investigate the spying
scandal. And once the trail of evidence emerged they were right to
punish McLaren heavily. What was uncovered cannot reasonably be
justified.

what strikes me when see how worked up people get about the rules, is

complexity.  if FIA were able to monitor everything at all times I'd
be pretty comfortable in betting that *all* of the teams havie been in
violation of one or more technical rule at some time during the
season.  willfully or not.  any undertaking at this level is about
going as close to the margins as possible and you can bet that the
issues that are brought to our attention is just a fraction of what is
really going on.

as for the floor of the Ferrari having a non-linear response to loads,
I think FIA set themselves up for this one.  it isn't unlike how car
manufacturers prep their cars for NCAP tests:  focus the test criteria
narrowly enough and the test defeats its purpose since engineers will
tend to optimize for the test and not for what the test is supposed to
uncover.

I'd been happy for either Kimi or Hamilton to win the WDC.  both
deserved it.  (I'm a huge fan of Kimi, but it was hard not to root for

That depends on how you rate Hill against Alonso.

Admittedly Hill was no Schumacher or Senna, but he was no mid-field
plodder either.

And then do we say that Alonso is the guy who beat Schumacher twice in
a straight fight (well... not in 2005 really) or that he's the
reigning champ who got a hard time from a novice teammate?

I think Hill was a good driver, you don't get to be WDC if you're a
complete no-hoper after all, but Alonso's achievements of pulling off
back to back WDCs against Schumacher in a competitive Ferrari proves
to me at least that he is the better driver.

I'd like to see if Alonso could come close to winning in an Arrows
though ;-)

&gt; &gt; AC

&gt; Here's a post of mine from another forum that helps explain..
">

&lt;snip&gt;

All good stuff, and I'm in agreement with you. I'd just like to add that
Alonso has been on the psychological back foot for half a season. I
reckon it cost him a few tenths a lap, compared to when he's at his MS
and KR-beating best.

Some would say the situation is of his own making, and in some respects
it's hard to disagree with that. Nonetheless, he has shown in this last
half a season, as in 2006, just how focused and determined he can be
when his back's against the wall, even if his ultimate speed has
suffered somewhat. I cannot help but be impressed with that resolve.
That's the positive side of his makeup, the side that Ron failed to
harness.

I still believe that had he been in the right frame of mind, with the
right support structure from the team, he would've been much quicker. I
haven't forgotten what he achieved in the inferior Renault against both
Kimi's McLaren and MS's Ferrari (and the FIA!). That speed and racecraft
doesn't just disappear, but it does need nurturing.

Fact is, Flav is better at man-management than Ron. Much better. In
fact, he runs a tighter ship altogether. McLaren have notched up more
cockups next to their name than any other team on the grid over the
years. Crappy strategy, botched cars, thrown away races, embittered
drivers. You name it, they've had it. And this season caps them all.

There is no getting away from the fact that he was out-qualified,

But he put himself on the psychological back foot once hamilton
started to be quicker than him. He couldn't handle it. For three races
in the latter part of the season he picked himself up, forgot about
Hamilton and showed what he could do. Had he done that all season,
he'd have been DWC. The fact that he isn't is his own fault. Of
course, he will never admit that and just blame everyone else in what
has become such a tiresome display of petulance. In many ways, he has
become worse than Schumacher. He's not even a real villain - just a

David, instead of being blindly loyal to Ron and criticising Flav, look

fact, the only entirely happy ones AFAICS have been Mika and Lewis (for

Flav has been dealing with many more drivers than Ron over the years,
with greater success, too. I mean OK, Flav can be a slimeball, but he's
got masses of talent when it comes to spotting, signing and looking

Dennis.

No.  He nailed it.
Far too much blame is being placed on Alonso.  If you look back at the
season after the first 3 or 4 races Hamilton was being hailed as the
second coming for doing nothing more then finishing where he started on
the grid.  Something many rookies have done.
His absolute choking at the end of the season makes him mortal.
He's the next Jenson Button, not the next Senna.

Alonso is the choker, not Hamilton. Alonso behaved like the rookie,

when he went up against Prost in the same team. Hamilton seemed not to

around that, no matter how you choose to magnify the odd mistake that
a 22 year old, with no previous experience in F1, made now and again

Yes. Look at how he's defended and bigged up Fisi over the years,
despite his less-than-thrilling performances. And yes for Heikki too.
He's been tough, but fair. Flav will chew a driver's head off if he
has to, but he will also get behind them 100%. He seems to be more
aware of what each driver needs than Ron is. Ron takes some
theoretical (*very* theoretical) intellectual, Cartesian notion of
equality, and blanket-applies it to all-comers. It doesn't work. It
isn't that simple. He doesn't adapt sufficiently. He's too rigid in
his treatment of drivers, especially Latins. It's been shown time and
time again.

Which trainer gets the best out of a highly-strung thoroughbred
racehorse? The one that adapts, reassures it and builds its
confidence, or the one that knowingly pushes it into a situation that
stresses it to breaking point? All in the name of a theory.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adjustments for technicalities cannot change this it would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply underline just how badly the FIA are managing the sport.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Spygate aside,

&gt; &gt; You're kidding, right.

&gt; No. But I might not have expressed myself clearly. I don't think this
&gt; season was remarkable for suddenly showing FIA as being chaotic and
&gt; opaque and puzzling. None of this is that new. Things were more or
&gt; less the same under Balestre.

&gt; And I believe that FIA were absolutely right to investigate the spying
&gt; scandal. And once the trail of evidence emerged they were right to
&gt; punish McLaren heavily. What was uncovered cannot reasonably be
&gt; justified.
">

To say things could have been worse is not nearly good enough.

Spygate has been a fiasco.

I would say they did not do nearly enough to investigate.

Both Max and Ferrari repeatedly behaved in a way which &quot;brought the
sport into disrepute&quot; before the second hearing. Max has contiuned to
do so.

The way spygate itself has been mishandeled is enough to have made this
a very bad year.

Other instances such as Australia, Hungary, Fuji and now Brazil only
add to the major upsets that have tainted this whole season. On top of
those you have the bizarre way the drivers were not only given immunity
from just punishment by the FIA but also not only permitted to carry on
racing but McLaren was told they cannot even discipline their cheating
agents, further than that they dignified the racist taunts of the
Spanish official by appointing an observer at his behest.

This is not club racing this is a multi-billion dollar business.

There can be few such public companies run so badly and disasterously
with such impunity.

&gt;Yes. Look at how he's defended and bigged up Fisi over the years,
&gt;despite his less-than-thrilling performances. And yes for Heikki too.
&gt;He's been tough, but fair. Flav will chew a driver's head off if he
&gt;has to, but he will also get behind them 100%. He seems to be more
&gt;aware of what each driver needs than Ron is. Ron takes some
&gt;theoretical (*very* theoretical) intellectual, Cartesian notion of
&gt;equality, and blanket-applies it to all-comers. It doesn't work. It
&gt;isn't that simple. He doesn't adapt sufficiently. He's too rigid in
&gt;his treatment of drivers, especially Latins. It's been shown time and
&gt;time again.

&gt;Which trainer gets the best out of a highly-strung thoroughbred
&gt;racehorse? The one that adapts, reassures it and builds its
&gt;confidence, or the one that knowingly pushes it into a situation that
&gt;stresses it to breaking point? All in the name of a theory.

Leaving Ron out of this - and I have little or no argument with you
there - I think you're being rathering generous about Briatore's
abilities. He may do all the things you say for his favourites but,
when a driver is out of favour, I'd say he's just as big a bastard as
Ron.

Disdaining your use of the infantile diminutive, several drivers'
fathers attend many of the races, including Jenson Button's and, when
he was in F1, Johnny Herbert's. For all I (and you) know, 90% of
fathers attend some or all of the races. Not many of them get Anthony
Hamilton's TV coverage, but that doesn't mean they aren't there.

Wasn't it Flav who screwed Moreno over in order to get Schumacher into
the car ASAP?

It seems to me that different teams have different management styles -
especially those teams where the team boss has been around for a
longish time.

Williams, for example, are known to be fairly blunt and unsentimental.
Dennis, from what I've read, is more likely to pamper a driver's ego
than Sir Frank is. But Ron, again based on what I've read over the
years, is much more concerned about how things look and about relating
with sponsors than Williams. Which is not to say that Williams don't
care about sponsors or drivers or appearances, just that their
approach is not the same as McLarens. Ron might have been less
accomodating of Jacques Villeneuve who wanted to do as little
promotional work as possible and liked wearing his overalls several
sizes too big.

This is not unusual. Different organisations have different ethoses
(ethii?) and the top F1 teams all have a fairly strong characters at
the top.

Individual drivers might thrive in one environment and not in another.

Anybody who thinks that Ron Dennis doesn't know how to go racing and
how to manage an F1 team is clearly off the twig. McLaren's record
over the 20 odd years in which he has run the team has been very good
indeed. Better than Williams actually. I doubt there's much to chose
between Ferrari and McLaren in the time that Ron has been running
McLaren.

He's not Flav. That's not surprising, and I doubt that either he or
Flav will lose sleep over that comparison.
