Microtubule behavior changes during the cell cycle and during spindle
assembly. However, it remains unclear how these changes are regulated
and coordinated. We describe a complex that targets the Protein
Phosphatase 2A holoenzyme (PP2A) to centrosomes in C. elegans embryos.
This complex includes Regulator of Spindle Assembly 1 (RSA-1), a
targeting subunit for PP2A, and RSA-2, a protein that binds and
recruits RSA-1 to centrosomes. In contrast to the multiple functions of
the PP2A catalytic subunit, RSA-1 and RSA-2 are specifically required
for microtubule outgrowth from centrosomes and for spindle assembly.
The centrosomally localized RSA-PP2A complex mediates these functions
in part by regulating two critical mitotic effectors: the microtubule
destabilizer KLP-7 and the C. elegans regulator of spindle assembly
TPXL-1. By regulating a subset of PP2A functions at the centrosome, the
RSA complex could therefore provide a means of coordinating microtubule
outgrowth from centrosomes and kinetochore microtubule stability during
mitotic spindle assembly
