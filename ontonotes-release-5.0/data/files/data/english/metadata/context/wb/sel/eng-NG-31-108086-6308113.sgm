I am totally confused and need some help from those knowledgeable of the
P-51. I received an Accurate Miniatures kit of the P-51C that has a four
piece  fuselage, two halves for the forward 2/3 and two halves for the aft
part. The vertical stabilizer has a large fillet in front of the stab and
that is what confuses me. I always thought that this fillet was only on the
later models of the D variant and not on the B/C variants. I cannot find any
documentation showing this feature on the C. Please enlighten be before I
carve this bit of plastic off. BTW I am aware that the B and C models are
the same just manufactured in different places. Thanks for any help you can
give me. Pete

What you might want to do it take a peek at the AM website and read
the step by step build up of your kit. Many times you can find answers
to your questions. Check some of the modeling websites for walk around
pictures, you might find a photographic reference you need to solve
the mystery as well. Given the popularity of the P-51, your local
library might have a book on it.

I have been able to find two reputable sources with Drawings of P-51C's with
dorsal fins, but no pictures yet.  I also have the Academy P-51B kit and it
does not have the dorsal fin.  I have also found a reference to a dorsal fin
retrofit kit for "earlier model" mustangs that could account for why a few
C's have a dorsal fin;  I will post more later.

I have done some more searching - both in books and online and find several
references to B and C Mustangs receiving the dorsal fin retrofit kit.  Some
sources say this was to correct a directional stability issue, but wikipedia
has this entry:

"A common misconception is that cutting down the rear fuselage to mount the
bubble canopy reduced stability, requiring a dorsal fin to be added to the
forward base of the vertical tail. Actually, both the B/C and later D/K
models had a low speed handling problem that could result in an involuntary
"snap-roll" under certain conditions of air speed, angle of attack, gross
weight and center of gravity. Several crash reports tell of P-51Bs and Cs
crashing because horizontal stabilizers were torn off during maneuvering.
The report says:"

"Unless a dorsal fin is installed on the P-51B, P-51C and P-51D airplanes,
a snap roll may result when attempting a slow roll. The horizontal
stabilizer will not withstand the effects of a snap roll. To prevent
recurrence the stabilizer should be reinforced in accordance with T.O.
01-60J-18 dated 8 April 1944 and a dorsal fin should be installed. Dorsal
fin kits are being made available to overseas activities"
"While some existing aircraft do not have the dorsal extension fitted, many
were equipped at some point in their service or refurbishment with a taller
tail, which provided a similar increase in yaw stability. Also,
civilian-owned examples often have newer, lighter radios, an absence of
external munitions and drop tanks, removed guns and armor plate and an empty
or removed fuselage tank - reducing the need for the dorsal fin."

I think what it comes down to, as in so many cases, is that you must
research the specific prototype you are modeling to find the correct
configuration.  If you wanted to do a "C" without the dorsal fin use the
Academy  "B" kit.  I believe the "C" kit in the markings provided is
accurate.

Some Bs and Cs hand the dorsal fin added, most didn't.

Here's are photos showing both "flavors" of P-51B/Cs

Best to work from photos of the actual prototype you're modeling.

The fin fillet was retro fitted to some B/C model Mustangs.

FWIW, there are three photos in Squadron's "P-51 in Action" of B/C's with
dorsal fins: "Lucky Leaky" (SX-M) of the 353rd FG (pg. 32), and two a/c from
the 52nd FG (pg. 34). In the old Aircam book on the P-51B/C, there are
photos of R4-E and WZ-S from the 78th FG, and two planes (one of them no.
72) from the 325th "Checkertails" FG. There are profiles showing CV-P from
the 359th FG, MC-L from the 20th FG, 5Y-14 from the 364th FG, D7-H from the
503rd FG, and "Princess" (fuselage no. 1078) from the 311th FG, all with
dorsal fins. All of the above a/c are in natural metal finish -- I haven't
found any OD B/C's with the dorsal fin -- but my resources are far from
comprehensive.

Just to muddy the waters a bit more, in the well known group photo of a/c
from the 361st FG (the group around which the green/blue camo debate
swirls), there is a clear view of one P-51D -- E2-C -- WITHOUT the dorsal
fin.

Oops! There are several P-51D's without dorsal fins in the 361st group photo
I mentioned in my previous post. Besides E2-C already mentioned, there's
E2-A, B7-U, B7-H and B7-R. In fact, the only D in the photo with a dorsal
fin is E2-S.

The first production 'D's out the factory door came without the dorsal
fin.  It was added to the line later.  IIRC, the original Airfix Mustang
came without the fin and the Heller kit came with the option of using or
not using the fin.  I took the parts and added them to a 'B' I was
building.  Thus I had a D without the dorsal and a B with.

Hi Troops:

I suspect AM got caught out by a commonly believed "urban legend"
that the P-51B was without the fin extension and the C came with the
fin extension. UNTRUE!  The 51B designation was applied to aircraft
built at North American's California facility and the 51C designation
was applied to aircraft built at the Government owned plant in Dallas
Texas.  The fin extension could be applied to either B or C aircraft
and a modified version  was implemented on the 51D/K later production
aircraft.

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-51_Mustang

&lt;quote&gt;

A common misconception is that cutting down the rear fuselage to mount
the bubble canopy reduced stability, requiring the addition of a dorsal
fin to the forward base of the vertical tail. Actually, both the B/C and
later D/K models had a low speed handling problem that could result in
an involuntary "snap-roll" under certain conditions of air speed, angle
of attack, gross weight and center of gravity. Several crash reports
tell of P-51Bs and Cs crashing because horizontal stabilizers were torn
off during maneuvering. One report stated:

"Unless a dorsal fin is installed on the P-51B, P-51C and P-51D
airplanes, a snap roll may result when attempting a slow roll. The
horizontal stabilizer will not withstand the effects of a snap roll. To
prevent recurrence the stabilizer should be reinforced in accordance
with T.O. 01-60J-18 dated 8 April &lt;/wiki/April_8&gt; 1944 &lt;/wiki/1944&gt; and
a dorsal fin should be installed. Dorsal fin kits are being made
available to overseas activities"

While some existing aircraft do not have the dorsal extension fitted,
many were equipped at some point in their service or refurbishment with
a taller tail, which provided a similar increase in yaw stability. Also,
civilian-owned examples often have newer, lighter radios, an absence of
external munitions and drop tanks, removed guns and armor plate and an
empty or removed fuselage tank - reducing the need for the dorsal fin.

Bill,
I think I read somewhere that the decision to have the P-51B kit
without the dorsal fairing and the P-51C with the fairing was purely a
marketing decision. If you wanted a Razorback without the fillet, you
bought the P-51B kit, if you wanted it with the fillet you bought the
P-51C kit. No confusion (theoretically) would occur in the buyer's
mind as to what he was getting.
