I have a Panasonic bathroom fan, about 75 CFM.  I want to put a
backdraft damper at the end of the exhaust pipe to reduce cold air
coming in the bathroom.  It is one of those spring loaded jobs and
says only needs .04 in W.G. pressure to open.  I was going to put at
the end of pipe to the sophet for ease of installation, rather than
inline.  Comments, or suggestions?  I was also considering a eave vent
with dampers by deflecto white plastic, dual side dampers flush mount
to sophet.  Anyone use one?

Do you mean .04 PSI?
Is W.G. = Waveguide?
Is sophet = soffit?
What is deflecto?

If you're using a waveguide pressure relief valve, its meant for a dry air
system.  Such a valve runs offline, not inline with the waveguide, a burp
valve if you will.  Such dry air isn't coming from bathroom vent.
