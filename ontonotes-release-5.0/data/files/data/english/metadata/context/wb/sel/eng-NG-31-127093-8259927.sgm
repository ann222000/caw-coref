The marriage no-shows

Carey Roberts Carey Roberts
July 13, 2004

* as you can see from the date, the marriage strike has been in progress for
some time and in fact has been increasing over the last 10 years

This week, Washington lawmakers took up the historical debate on the Federal
Marriage Amendment. But the good Senators appear to be blissfully unaware of
the trend that overshadows the controversies surrounding gay marriage - the
fact that millions of American men are marital no-shows.

Stripped down to its bare essentials, marriage is an enduring social
contract between a consenting man and woman. Before they agree to enter into
this sacred union, both parties must have the expectation of benefit. But
the disturbing fact is, millions of American men have come to believe that
marriage is a losing proposition.

News of the Marriage Strike first began to settle into our national
consciousness in 2002. That year Barbara Dafoe Whitehead and David Popenoe
of Rutgers University interviewed 60 men to probe their attitudes about
marriage. And to their surprise, they discovered that some of these men were
flat-out opposed to tying the knot
( http://marriage.rutgers.edu/Publications/SOOU/TEXTSOOU2002.htm ).

So this year, the Rutgers researchers decided to launch a full-scale
national survey of single heterosexual men, ages 25-34. These men represent
almost 10 million of the nation's most eligible bachelors. The report was
just released last month
( http://marriage.rutgers.edu/Publications/SOOU/TEXTSOOU2004.htm ).

Among those men, 53% said they were not interested in getting married
anytime soon - the marriage delayers. That figure alone is cause for
concern.

But this is the statistic that every American who wants to strengthen and
protect marriage should be worried about: 22% of the men said they had
absolutely no interest in finding their Truly Beloved. The report described
these guys as &quot;hardcore marriage avoiders.&quot;

When almost one-quarter of single men in their prime courting years - that's
two million potential husbands - declare a Marriage Strike, we're facing an
unprecedented social crisis.

Why are these men refusing to marry? Some of their reasons are spelled out
in the 2002 report:

a.. &quot;Some men express resentment towards a legal system that grants women
the unilateral right to decide to terminate a pregnancy...There is also a
mistrust of women who may 'trap' men into fathering a child by claiming to
be sterilized, infertile or on the pill.&quot;

b.. &quot;Many men also fear the financial consequences of divorce...They fear
that an ex-wife will 'take you for all you've got' and that 'men have more
to lose financially than women' from a divorce.&quot;

Men's fear of financial ruin following divorce is backed by research. In a
soon-to-be-released book
( http://www.psychstat.smsu.edu/stockburger/cs/CSarticleExcerpt.htm ), Sanford
Braver, PhD of Arizona State University notes that noncustodial fathers
often spend considerable money when they are with their kids. But the child
support guidelines don't take this into account.

Plus, the custodial mother reaps a number of tax benefits, such as being
able to list the kids as exemptions on her IRS return. Likewise, the mother
does not pay any taxes on her child support income, while the father cannot
list these payments as deductions. As a result, Braver suggests that the
&quot;guidelines have already become too generous&quot; to the point that the father
experiences a standard of living that is lower than his ex-wife.

Men have other reasons to resist the romantic urge. Domestic violence laws
allow vindictive women to kick hubby out of the house based on the flimsiest
of pretexts. And if divorce were to result, he would likely lose custody of
his own flesh and blood.

Four decades ago, radical feminists, taking their cue from Marxist-Leninist
theory, decreed that marriage was nothing more than gender slavery. Claiming
to speak on behalf of American women, feminists set out to radically
rework - or even do away with - the age-old social contract of marriage. And
women, mesmerized by the ephemeral promise of liberation and empowerment,
opted to go along for the ride.

Now, feminists are succeeding beyond their wildest dreams. And women are
left to wonder why their Prince Charming is nowhere to be found.

I read the study Carey cites;  it says men still want marriage.  In
fact, they can't have families without it.  So...that women are going
to college and establishing careers seems to be more the issue in the
delay of marriage.  When you couple that with the fact that women are
not buying mail order husbands but that men ARE buying male order
brides...well, the idea that men are not wanting marriage is not
terribly convincing.

Females aren't marrying because no men want them. The more alluent and
educated man will find females in countries that do not have such an anti
male bias.Of course, if he's smart he won't marry them either but keep them
around as fuck buddies :o) US skanks are not even worthy of that. Fat stupid
anti male females are for POOR men. The affluent can get anything they want
and are not buying a female's snake oil. :o)
