Hi! New guy - XR650L question

Looks like a nice group you got here. Hope you don't mind a new guy. :)

I'm 37 years old. Used to ride an XL250R back in the day. Got married
young (and poor), wife didn't want me to ride. blah, blah, blah...Sold
the bike.

I'm &quot;allowed&quot; to get a bike again. I'm dying to carry on with the dual
sport thing and I really want an XR650L. You guys think it will be too
big for a guy who hasn't really ridden in 17 years? Before you answer,
I'm 6'2&quot; and 280 so I think I have the size. I just want to get out and
explore the many miles of trails/fire roads near my house (St.
Augustine, FL).

I stopped by the dealer on Friday to sit on one and it seems like a good
match for me. I don't really want any other bike.

Then just buy it and go riding.  It's a Honda, you won't
be disappointed.

Go fast. Take chances.

Nope. And really, for a guy your size (with your desires) I probably
wouldn't recommend anything else. Our own DDave (XR650L_Dave) can
probably give you all the tips on the 650L you'll ever need too. I say
go for it!

Yep DDave's your guy.  Welcome to the hell that is RMD.  I've ridden
with DDave, and he's abnormal on an XR650L.
So's Deeney.  Ask away, and these guys will tell you everything youy
need to know.

The XRL is pretty much unstoppable. You will only feel its 350lbs (or
so) if it falls down (do NOT let it fall on you), in deep sand, or
mud. As long as you have a smidgeon of traction, it responds well
enough to steering inputs that you do not have to muscle it around.

It does not have a lot of horsepower, all 650 of those CCs are tuned
for mellow output and torque. Its so mellow-tuned, in fact, that a
little waking up is in order. You can put in a jet/needle kit, just
some jets, or jet it and drill the slide for much better smoothness
and better throttle response.

Stock or slightly modded, its very easy to ride, and with the stock
(very soft) springing its ideally suited for exploring. It just soaks
up logs and rocks, even while sitting.

If you're in the mood for used, XRLs pop up fairly frequently, and you
can save quite a bit.

I'm 5'11&quot; and 227, and I can pick the pig up fairly easily, as long as
its about 15-20 minutes between dumps.

You can see lots of info on the XRL at the yahoo XRLUG group,
4strokes.com, and thumpertalk.com .

If you do ever decide it needs more oomph, its readily upgradeable.

The answer is obvious.  Look no further.  Any other motorcycle will pale in
comparison.  Honda reached the pinnacle of motorcycle completeness when they
realeased the XR650L in 1993.  Why they bothered to continue manufacturing
any other bike is one of the unfathomable mysteries of the universe.

Wow. Thanks for all the info guys. What's making me crazy is that we
need to pay off some bills before I can swing it and I want it NOW!!
Still, I'm doing a lot of reading up on the bike, the mods, etc so I'll
be ready. I'm definitely getting the XRL. Thanks again!

The bills will still be there after you get it.  Just go get it
now.  It'll be more fun.

my 2000 year model has been a reliable tank, and I hadn't ridden for
years prior to buying it.
I'm 6'1 &amp; 200 pounds, it's definitely about the right mix for me.

Stock gearing is 15 front and 45 tooth in the back.  Changing to a 14
up front was a great move for mine.
Open up the airbox and do the jetting tricks - both are cheap.

Also, i see very clean L's for sale quite frequently.  Keep your eye
out and you might find a nice used one for the $3k to $3500 range.
Good luck!
Matt

Hey, I think &quot;Do whatever the F**k you want to!&quot;, is pretty much an open
ticket to buy a new bike.
