On the Mike and Mike in the morning show Steve Phillips said he
thought that the offers for Johan may include the Red Sox offering up
Ellsbury, Buchholz and Lester for Johan.  This is why he no longer GMs
a baseball team.

I thought the exact same thing.  That's why he's a commentator rather

I don't see how? Surely there have been worse than that. Lester might
never be more than a middle of the rotation nibbler, and Ellsbury may
be far from the player we think he is based on a small sample size.
Santana however could be the best pitcher in the major leagues. Put
him alongside Beckett and you have a pretty dominating staff.

By the way, I probably would NOT make that deal, in part because you
have 1 very valuable egg rather than 3 valuable eggs, and the risk of
injury is all too real, but I don't know if I could call it the worst
trade of all time, or even a very bad trade?

I may be talking out of my arse, but I will reserve judgement until
some more voices weigh in on this.

You'd be in favor of giving up three big league ready players...one about to
become a very good everyday centerfielder (if he isn't to be considered one
already) and two very promising starters who most believe will break into
the rotation for the defending champions?  In exchange for ONE year of
Santana???   Sorry Lee...you haven't thought this through...at all.

Of course not Dano.
1) no, I would not make that trade - as I think I said at the end of
my post, I was merely saying it would not be the worst trade
2) obviously the assumption in that trade would be Santana would sign
a long term deal, I wouldn't give up ANY of the players mentioned for
a 1 year rental, the Sox are not desperate.

I'm saying that if you inked Santana to a long term deal in exchange
for those three it would not be the worst trade ever by a long shot,
given that we have no idea how good JE and CB will be in the majors,
and that Lester has not been stellar. Santana on the other hand has
been the best/among the best pitchers in all of baseball for a few
years now.

If you inked Santana to a long term deal...that's merely signing a free
agent.  He does not have to sign any such deal and won't (I'm reasonably
certain).  Any trade would simply be for his rights for this coming year.
The team would be receiving compensation only for that.

Look...I just don't see the need or desire for the Sox to give up three
potential stars of their future...particularly for a guy you will have to
pay ridiculous FA type money to sign anyway.  It makes no sense at all to
me.  I'd prefer to take my chances on Buchholz and Lester...and Ellsbury
would be on my untouchable list.

I'm listening to these knuckleheads on the radio going on and on about
giving up this talent for him with barely a mention of how they will have to
pay the big money ON TOP of giving these kids.  Johan Santana will be
looking for a huge payday.  Reports are that the Yankees have offered 45
million for three years to Rivera, who will be 40 at the end of that deal!
Imagine what it's going to take to pay Santana!  Never mind Papelbon in a
few years...

Dano made my case, but I'd moderate as it's *potentially* the worst trade
of all time, given that the rookies are still not established.  I would
consider it an extreme gamble with justification to make it.  Maybe you
trade Lester and one AAA prospect, but that's as far as I'd go.  I would
touch the other two for anything.

&gt; I don't see how? Surely there have been worse than that. Lester might
&gt; never be more than a middle of the rotation nibbler, and Ellsbury may
&gt; be far from the player we think he is based on a small sample size.
&gt; Santana however could be the best pitcher in the major leagues. Put
&gt; him alongside Beckett and you have a pretty dominating staff.

&gt; By the way, I probably would NOT make that deal, in part because you

Dumbest trade of all time...prolly not.

This ain't a good one.
Von Hayes
December 9, 1982: Traded by the Cleveland Indians to the Philadelphia
Phillies for Manny Trillo, George Vukovich, Jay Baller, Julio Franco, and
Jerry Willard.

Brett Butler
October 21, 1983: Sent by the Atlanta Braves to the Cleveland Indians to
complete an earlier deal made on August 28, 1983. The Atlanta Braves sent
players to be named later and $150,000 to the Cleveland Indians for Len
Barker. The Atlanta Braves sent Rick Behenna (September 2, 1983), Brett
Butler (October 21, 1983), and Brook Jacoby (October 21, 1983) to the
Cleveland Indians to complete the trade.

&gt;The bulk of the commentary on ESPN, as well as talk radio, is well below

I enjoy Baseball Tonight, I don't even mind Kruk so much

It's the off-season that really brings out the Tin Hats though. People
don't realize that even without Lowell, the Sox project to be better
than last year what with Bucholz and Lester ,IMO, improving last years
staff. And Ellsbury almost can't help but be better than Crisp.

The Sox can just sit pat in the offseason.

&gt;I'm saying that if you inked Santana to a long term deal in exchange

Santana is a great pitcher. He had three years in a row 2004-2006 that
were almost pedroesk. But last year (2007) was v. good but more
ordinary (e.g., .333 ERA).

Yeah--he didn't have a dominating year in 07.
But getting him keeps him from the Yankees. And that's a major plus.
I hope the Red Sox are factoring that in. Signing a player
keeps him from the Yankees. That is an added factor not to be overlooked--in
Lowell's case and even ARod.
I would trade prospects for Santana, but not for a 3rd baseman.

I would sign Lowell for four years if I had to. He might accept a fourth
year in Boston with some incentives attached. He could also switch positions
with Youkilis at some point, if necessary. I hope they have thought of that.
There is a good fit.

Lowell-Youkilis are excellent at the corners. You could even say they are
synergistic. Epstein must know what that means. He went to Yale.

I wish this talk of Santana would go away...even though I know it won't.  I
believe we should stop worrying about NY at this point.  They can (and will,
and do) worry about Boston now.  They are chasing the Sox now.  F them.
What have their methods gotten them lately?

Santana...for the hundreth time...is a FREE AGENT after this coming season.
He is highly unlikely to be allowed to talk to suitors BEFORE any trade.
Even if he is, it will because a team is willing to fork over so much
talent...for the right to pay the man like a free agent anyway.  This is NOT
the same as when the Sox got Pedro.  For one thing, they gave up a hell of a
lot less than what is being suggested it will take for Santana to be dealt.

Ordway and his little gang are on week two of nearly demanding the Sox deal
for Santana...with almost NO mention of the fact that you could lose him
after one year.  How much do you figure the Yankees will cough up for him?
Imagine giving Buchholz, Lester and Ellsbury and having the yankees pay
Santana 30M for 6 years a year later.

I would pay Lowell for a fourth year too...not so sure I'd go for 15M...but
I trust Theo and the front office to decide where to draw the line.  The
Yankees are getting older and richer by the minute.  42M+ for your corner
infielders?   Do you really think that's wise?  Good luck to them if they
think so.
