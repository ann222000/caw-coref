Please forgive me if this has been posted and answered here before, but am
new to this newsgroup. My 9 year old feline has developed the subject
problem. The smell is overwhelming and when she defecates, the smell
permeates the entire house.

Her diet is Scientific dry food and Friskies canned. Her appetite is good
almost too good at times.

Thanks in advance.

Challen H.

My cat has had that problem from day one. I mentioned it to the vet and
she said it's the canned food that causes the odor. She also said a cat
can live on dry food alone as long as it contains all the nutrition the
cat needs. Did you recently change brands? If not, it probably would be
a good idea to take her to the vet.

"/> On behalf of those who have responded in a helpful manner, I am sure you're
welcome.

Please ignore the other rather rude responses, they're obviously not too
sociable of characters.

I understand entirely why you posted your query on here. For a start, you
appear to have posted at 18:45, vets by me are not open at this time, and,
while vets are indeed educated professionals, they can still make mistakes
or provide unintentionally incorrect diagnosis.

It always pays to see if others have had similar experiences and learn their
outcome, or vet's diagnosis. Obviously bearing in mind that one sympton can
be characteristic of many different conditions.

I hope all goes well.

Challen,
I had the same problem with my cats. I took them to the vet and it was
determined that it was the wet food that was contributing to their &quot;smell&quot;.
I changed their wet food from Friskies to MediCal (just a little everyday)
and they are fine..mind you they do not smell like roses but they ar emuch
better.
