Hormone-fed milk cows fade from market

Florida's milk producers have stopped injecting their dairy herds with rBST,
after grocery giant Publix said it would sell milk only from cows not
treated with the synthetic hormone.

Drinking McArthur and Publix milk products may be healthier now that the
majority of Florida's dairy farmers are no longer injecting their cows with
growth hormone.

Are you comfortable drinking milk with the synthetic hormone rBST?

Yes    No

Your vote has been counted, thank you for voting.

Food-safety advocates and scientists disagree on whether milk containing
hormones is bad for humans and cows, but this much is clear: You won't see
much of it anymore in Florida grocery stores.

Publix Super Markets, Florida's largest grocery chain, announced in May it
would no longer buy milk from cows treated with the synthetic hormone rBST.
As of this month, nearly all of the state's dairy farmers stopped using the
substance.

''I think it's a great idea,'' said Miriam Graydon, a mother perusing the
dairy case this week at a Coral Gables Publix. Her son can't swallow an Oreo
without a tall, cold glass of milk, and she would rather that milk be
hormone-free.

Since growth hormone helps farmers squeeze an extra gallon of milk from the
average dairy cow, moving herds off rBST means a dip in production -- and
profits -- for some dairies. For Southeast Milk, a cooperative of 300 dairy
farms -- 160 in Florida -- there wasn't much choice: Publix is its largest
customer.

The sweeping, and rather sudden, transformation of Florida's dairy industry
illustrates the large-scale changes some suppliers are being forced to make
to survive amid growing demand for more naturally produced foods and
beverages.

''I got to sell my milk, and the marketplace in Florida says it needs to be
from cows not treated with rBST,'' said Joe Wright, Southeast Milk's
president, who owns a 1,400-head dairy farm in Avon Park.

The cooperative, mainly family farms, produces more than 80 percent of the
milk consumed in Florida, sold under the Publix, McArthur Dairy, Costco and
Winn Dixie brands, among other labels.

The cooperative required all members to cease using the hormone Sept. 1.

Wright said Publix agreed to pay the cooperative more for its milk, though
not enough to cover losses for the decline in production.

Approved by the FDA in 1994, rBST, or recombinant bovine somatotropin, is a
lab-created copy of bovine somatotropin, a hormone naturally produced in
cows that speeds their ability to convert feed into milk.

The hormone is controversial. The European Union and Canada have never
approved its use. Some activists blame it for contributing to high cancer
rates, early puberty and other ailments.

Animal-rights proponents also point to studies showing an increased risk of
udder infections among rBST cows, requiring them to take antibiotics, which
in turn increases the likelihood of those medications leaching into milk.

Farmers are skeptical. They say strict screening protocols and economic
penalties keep infected cows off the production line. They also say the
udder infection, called mastitis, is common among untreated cows, as well.

The synthetic hormone is not traceable in milk, and 90 percent of the
naturally produced BST is burned away during pasteurization, according to
several studies.

What's more, critics of antihormone moves say retailers' demand for
rBST-free herds is cutting into the national milk supply, pushing already
record-high milk prices up. Between January and August, the average gallon
of 2 percent milk has risen in South Florida by 25 percent to $4.29, the
most recent data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows.

High demand, coupled with rising farm costs, have contributed to the spike.
No direct correlation has been shown between higher prices and the increased
number of dairy farmers eschewing rBST.

Still, Henry Miller, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution who headed
the Food and Drug Administration Office of Biotechnology from 1989 to 1993,
described Publix's decision as anticonsumer.

''It especially disadvantages the poor because it raises the price of milk
unnecessarily,'' Miller said, ``and with a product of milk where demand is
elastic, people consume less of the product as the price goes up. It's a
detriment to health.''

He also said it would be impossible for Publix to ferret out cheaters
because rBST is undetectable in milk.

A Publix spokeswoman said the company had taken no side in the debate,
rather, it was responding to inquiries about rBST from some customers and
requests from others to sell milk from untreated herds.

''We're in the business of catering to our customers and responding to what
our customers are looking for at the grocery store,'' said Publix
spokeswoman Maria Brous.

But Miller says he knows of no surveys in which consumers have identified
rBST herds as an issue.

''If you have products that are side by side, and the gene-spliced product
is cheaper, people will buy the cheaper product,'' Miller said, ``In
surveys, almost no one mentions gene-splicing or rBST as a concern.''

Three of four customers who were buying milk earlier this week at Publix
told The Miami Herald they had never heard of rBST. After its contested
health effects were explained, the three still said price would dictate
which brand they bought.

''I buy Publix brand because it's cheaper,'' said Jeannie Perez, 35. ``I
don't think the regular consumer knows about that stuff. Unfortunately, all
we care about is price.''

But Graydon, 52, said she chose milk from untreated cows as a compromise.
``I can't buy organic because it's real expensive, but this is kind of like
organic -- a little bit.''

Chris Galen, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, said
the push to eliminate the growth hormone from some dairy herds began as a
marketing strategy about 18 months ago amid a shortage of organic milk.

Milk from cows not treated with artificial growth hormone was touted as the
next best thing to organic, even though nontreated cows meet none of the
requirements for organic certification. Nonetheless, rBST-free milk is
sometimes sold at premium prices.

''It's a mid-price, mid-range product in the dairy case that appeals to
those people who don't want to shell out $8 for organic but have some vague
unease with what is claimed to be wrong with rBST,'' he said.

Publix's Brous said the store had pledged not to raise the price of its milk
based on rBST-free herds.

Resigned to the transition, dairy farmer Wright questioned the need to
eliminate rBST, but said he understood Publix's move. ''My own wife doesn't
want to drink rBST milk,'' Wright said.
