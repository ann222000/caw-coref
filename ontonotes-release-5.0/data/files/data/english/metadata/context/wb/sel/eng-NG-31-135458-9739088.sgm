Well, I have decided to try and install 12 today but found out
that my image did not come across. I did have disk lose power at some
point. After reinserting it into utorrent/rechecking it looks like it
is planning to redownload the whole think ( although I did not let it
finnish even the first piece, but it didn't wipe the file so I can still
open it in rar and read the text files . )

So, will torrent sort it out or should I be looking for about 3Meg of
recovery data ( PAR2 ).

Cheers Sam.

Download it using FTP, and check it's integrity with MD5SUM.

I wouldn't mind redownloading it if I had high speed and as if that wasn't
enough the line is so terribly noisy lately.
I let the torrent go , but while after 5 minutes I hoped it would only take 5 hours,
after about 40 minutes it looks only fractionally faster than plain ~3KBs download.
Why doesn't it check the chunks against the torrent file and only download those?
Now that I think back some more, I had to fix a file in the past but used to use something like bitgui and had to fix a file and worked well.

Well I guess I'll have to take it up with them guys.

That's (sort of) true, but even in remote areas there is usually the
possibility of a satellite/dish setup.  For someone wanting to explore
Linux (which usually involves ISO downloads), it's just a little hard for
me to understand why they don't do something to enhance that experience.

You make it sound like cable is not a good option for high speed access.
While it may not be optimal for hosting servers from your house, it's the
best solution for general household internet access, IMHO.  Generally MUCH
faster than residential grade DSL.  I pay less than the $60 you mention
above, and would gladly pay twice that if that's what it took.

We have a vsat system, but it's $70 for a 2gig shaped plan (256/64 -
64/64) so not suitable for downloading an iso. It's about the best you can
get in a rural area.

It's good for most other stuff tho, but 2gig is really easy to chew up in
a couple of weeks ;)

Perhaps it's time to order the cd kit from slackware.com ...?
The postman may have a lot more lag than dialup,
but he can provide extremely high bandwidth. :*)

Or, if one is intent on downloading over an (unreliable) dialup,
then maybe it would be better to go after the distribution tree
rather than the iso?   ie., get the files and burn your own iso.
That should allow easier recovery from d/l errors.

Note that rsync is very good at automatic error recovery, very
good at keeping up-to-date patches/.

I read some interesting sci-fi pulp, IIRC Heinlein, _Number of the Beast_,
featuring tech like flying cars and voice interfaces.  Syntactily, the
voice interface seemed very much like CLI, with typical features like
user-defined functions.

The utility of a voice interface really depends on the application,
and it would be useful only for things which could be expressed in
the most simple terms.  Talking takes more time and physical effort
than typingg, and is a lot harder to review and edit.

I've been using Linux for almost a decade and never needed high speed net
access.

There are plenty of places that sell burnt ISOs for cheap.  I imagine there
will be fewer as more people get high speed access.  But, I see no *need* for
it.  As for Slackware, I support the distro by buying it.

Do you have it with cable TV?  If you just want the internet option, you
are typically looking at around $55/month plus all the other crap they
tack on.  The best deal I have seen is $25/month for net and HDTV, each.
Add to that the $10/month for the HDTV box, maybe a cable modem, all the
other fees - and you are quickly up to $75/month.  That is $900/year.
I rather spend that money on fuel and tires for my trackbike.

It depends on how much you like pissing money away.  I make twice as much as
many of my friends who spend $100/month on cable/net.  It just isn't worth that
much to me - it is not priced for what it is worth.  It is a good example
of something that is priced to what the market will bear.  Basically, they
know even poor people here in the US will still pay $100/month for their
TV and net access.

Basically, most of the time you spend in front of the TV, or online,

Yes, I have it with digital cable TV.  I pay about $75 for the TV/HDDVR
part, and $40 for the internet access.  While I don't watch a lot of TV, I
do like to watch some things (sports) in HD, I find the cost to be

AMEN.

Not to mention there is no news service with cable and don't think there is with Bell
up here.
I think bell has something 10X faster than modem for $30 , but when I think how many times a week I get something about bell high speed while my line grows noisier every month and Bell claims all is good on their side and they are not responsible for wiring from basement to the jack.....
I could get DSL from other ISPs for maybe $24-25 but I think that is basically giving business to BELL and unless they fix the noise I'll end up getting half anyway( or less.) Aside from these occasional downloads which I can turn on for the night, not crazy about paying for high speed just so I can see them, ever spreading FLASH adds.

Just earlier on they had segment on news about Bells 7Mbit service ( for $50 )
only giving about 10%.

Well I guess I could support it once in a while, even though I am not getting
a home network I expected when I started fiddling with linux.

Back to the topic I did check MD5 with python and it matches ...hmmm
Would by nice to see if PAR2 is really any good. Despite  the fact that it worked
twice in the past on about 4 meg of data, I am skeptical that it is possible to always recover X amount of data with about X amount of recovery data if you consider that it could be missing/bad anywhere. But it could only apply if the data consists of multiple files about the size of the recovery pieces.
