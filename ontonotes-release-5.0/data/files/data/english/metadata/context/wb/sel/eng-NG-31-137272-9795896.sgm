Hi

I bought a small flowering orchid named &quot;Twinkle&quot;
It smells strongly like vanilla and this variety has other colors with
different smells like the red bloom (very small) smells more cinnamin
amber like.

I am taking it inside tonight as it is going to 40 degress tonight but
I wasn't told to do that.  The grower said to put it outside until it
blooms then bring it in.  Also said to fertilize it opne time a month.

Question 1
I am hoping you may know it or know a place where I can access more
instructions, for instance It needs repotting and I see spring as the
ideal time for that.

Question 2
Do we know anyone who is making perfume from orchids?

Thanks
Bb

Hi Bb:

When asking a question about Orchids it is very important to use the
full name of the plant. 'Twinkle' is the name of the hybrid grex (all
the plants from the particular cross), but the genus is Oncidium. Grex
names can be used for more than one genus so do not necessarily
identify the plant. In thios case, your description was enough to let
me know you were referring to Oncidium 'Twinkle', but that would not
necessarily be the case.

This hybrid should be very easy to grow following the instructions for
Oncidium found on the orchid doctor page of our website
( www.orchidsanfrancisco.org ). It's parents are somewhat more cold
tolerent than many Oncidiums and so the plant can live outside so long
as the night temperatures are above 50 degrees (and it really should
be protected from cold winter rains, as the combination of cold and
constantly wet can be very damaging). The occasional colder night
would do no harm, but once temps are consistantly 50 or below, the
plant should be moved indoors to a bright windowsill. In spring and
summer you might fertilize more often, but once a month is fine right
now.

The best time to repot would be when new top growth is in progress and
you see the beginning of new root production. In most cases this would
be spring, but as this plant can go through more than one growth cycle
each year (and thus can bloom more than once a year), keep your eyes
on the plant and let it tell you!

Orchid based perfumes are apparently not very popular in this country.
Some may in fact have notes of some orchid fragrances (and some have
vanilla, though this is not from the flowers), but none are based on
orchids. Sashiedo (I don't know the proper spelling) markets an orchid
perfume in Japan, where it apparently is very popular.

Sincerely,
Dennis

By the way, if you are a beginner, you might want to read the text on
repotting found by clicking the &quot;culture/techniques&quot; link on this site.
