School sends home obesity notices with students, parent upset

DENVER - In an effort to combat the problem of childhood obesity, the
Denver Public School District is sending home student health reports
to keep parents informed. However, one parent says it should not have
been sent home in her daughter's backpack because she read it.

&quot;The part that upset her the most as she started reading it, there it
stated that she was overweight and she started to cry saying, 'Mom,
that school tells me I'm fat.' So, it was very heart wrenching,&quot; said
Flaurette Martinez.

Her daughter Isabel was sent home from the Centennial K-8 School on
Monday with the health notice. It listed her height, weight and body
mass index - a measure of body fat. Underneath the listing it had a
marking next to the status &quot;overweight.&quot;

&quot;My daughter is big boned,&quot; said Martinez.

Isabel's mother does not have a problem with what the schools are
trying to do. She says that type of sensitive information should be
mailed directly home to parents, because kids are prone to reading
letters sent home by the schools.

&quot;If she would have dropped this letter, a student may have found it
and may have exposed it to other students,&quot; said Martinez. &quot;Anything
specific to the child should be mailed. It should not be given to the
child.&quot;

However, DPS Spokesperson Alex Sanchez says schools do that all the
time. Report cards, disciplinary notices and letters from the
principal are commonly sent home with students. Sanchez says it is
cheaper for the district to send these things home with students
instead of by mail.

Martinez says that decision is causing her daughter emotional
distress.

&quot;Most of the information that we get sent to us through the kids is
basically newsletters, but nothing this sensitive. This is a sensitive
issue for everybody,&quot; she said. &quot;It's real upsetting for me to see her
worried so much about her weight issue when it's not really that big
of a deal. She's not that overweight.&quot;

DPS issued this statement Thursday afternoon: &quot;In an effort to help
ensure our students' health, Denver Public Schools provides parents
with their child's hearing, vision, and body mass index (BMI) results
in a sealed envelope that is sent home with the students. DPS feels
compelled to inform parents about these very important health
screening results and provide information about making healthier
choices. The health of our students is very important to us and we
wish to be part of the solution, given the nation's childhood obesity
epidemic.&quot;

9NEWS asked Martinez repeatedly if sharing Isabel's identity and her
health information will make things worse. Martinez wanted people to
see her picture so they would know Isabel is not that big. She also
says the damage was already done when she read the notice and she's
talked to Isabel about addressing this issue of sending the notices
home with students. Martinez says her daughter is OK with this
information being released.

I watched the video without sound.  I noticed that there were only three
categories on the letter for weight:

Overweight
At risk for overweight
Underweight

Where is the entry for &quot;normal weight&quot;?  The way this letter is worded,
I'd be upset too.  Every child is classified as a problem in this
system.  Every child is diagnosed with a weight problem.

Yes, the girl is heavy -- a few pounds heavier than I was at her age.  I
resented the diets my doctor forced my mother to put me on, although I
wasn't classified as obese or at risk -- merely in the 95-100 percentile
for my age and height.  By the way, none of those diets worked.  No
matter how little I was fed or how unappetizing it was, I didn't lose
weight.  I didn't sneak food or eat junk food, either.  My meals were
home cooked out of fresh ingredients.  I spent a lot of time outside
playing. And I was (and still am) fat.

I have big problems with a government that classifies children as
potential expenses to the system.  The girl cannot be allowed to be
overweight because she *might* cost the system money down the road.  Her
health care *might* be more expensive.  The babies the system will
indoctrinate her she must have *might* have their own health problems
and therefore costs.  But suggest to someone, anyone, that this is a
crude form of eugenics and you will be immediately shot down as an
alarmist or a conspiracy freak.

Let's take a good look at the costs of health care over a lifetime for a
preemie with severe mental and physical disabilities against an
otherwise normal child who is consistently 20% overweight. But it's OK
to stigmatize the fattie, to ridicule and shun, to isolate and belittle
in the name of creating a &quot;healthier&quot; society.  To suggest that the
disabled child isn't anything but a gift from God that enriches the
entire planet by its mere existence is sacrilege, and you are a Nazi for
even thinking so!

Is the girl fat?  Yes.  But if she is healthy, so what?  Being fat does
not equal being unhealthy.  Is fat an indicator?  Sure, absolutely, and
some of us who are large monitor our cholesterol, our blood sugar, our
blood pressure, and other signs to make sure that we remain healthy. Is
the girl active?  Does she get exercise?  Is she abusing food by comfort
eating?  Is she depressed or anxious?  These are the signs the schools
should be looking for, not just a number.

The letter did not say that anything had to be done about the little
girl's weight -- just that she was overweight.  It was meant for those
parents and children who were in denial.  Admittedly, it did not work
as the mother did not see too much fat on her kid but &quot;big bones&quot;.
Even if the little girl is currently okay physically and is not
pre-diabetic, etc., she is still going to suffer from discrimination
from her classmates, teachers and anyone else she encounters in the
future.  Most heavy kids tend to get heavier as they get older. This
could have been a wakeup call but unfortunately, it sounds like both
her and her mother are firmly entrenched in a state of denial.

If the photograph by the article is of that form (the video won't play
for me so I can't see the girl), then the weight assessment is based on
BMI. BMI assessed me as being of normal weight when I was 1.65m and
49kg. Ever since then, I've disregarded anything BMI might proclaim.
It's twaddle.

Actually, IMHO, it *is* a fact of life.  Even if the little girl loses
weight, there will still, and always, be some reason to disriminate.
Especially with classmates and other kydz.

The reality is, children are cruel monsters that turn into even more cruel
workforce grunts.  I've lived through it all, and even though you might not
be overweight, kydz WILL FIND a way to make your life a living hell for some
reason.  &quot;Her boobs are too big.  He's too short.  He's not on the
basketball team!  She has a stupid hair color.  His nose is too small,&quot; ad
nauseum.

Then that becomes:  &quot;She's undereducated.  He's *over*educated.  She doesn't
like the boss's kydz.  He won't go to my home interior party....so I don't
care what happens to his job.  She won't listen to my stories about the dog.
He voted Democratic.  She doesn't like to drink or do karaoke.&quot;

You see?  People will *invent* reasons to be nasty to each other.  Extra
poundage not necessary.

I'm an advocate of returning the &quot;hazing&quot;, although it's a problem if

For example, getting called &quot;fat&quot; when you aren't reveals that the

This thread has given me an earworm:

&quot;Big Boned Gal&quot; by k.d.lang/ben mink
she was a big boned gal from southern alberta
you just couldn't call her small
and you can bet every saturday night
she'd be heading for the legion hall
put her blue dress on
and she'd curl her hair
oh she's been waiting all week
and with a bounce in her step
and a wiggle in her walk
she'd be swinging down the street ...

Nah, I only fuck women, not ugly, withered old cunts like you, so don't
bother trying to get my attention.

As for breeding, if a girl tries to fit me up for a paternity suit, she's
out of luck. I had my tadpoles dammed when I was 21. Ain't no fucking way
I'll have a kid. I can't stand the noisy, whiny, crying, puking, shitting
little cunts.

The only thing that stops me setting fire to the little assholes is that I
don't like jail real much. Been there once, don't need another visit.

Now you fuck off and try pouring some antiseptic on that festering cunt of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Even if the little girl is currently okay physically and is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pre-diabetic, etc., she is still going to suffer from discrimination
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from her classmates, teachers and anyone else she encounters in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; future.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I suppose this discrimination is &quot;just a fact of life&quot; in your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eyes, rather than something that should be combatted?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm with Melody on this one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- Daze

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, IMHO, it *is* a fact of life.  Even if the little girl loses
&gt;&gt;&gt; weight, there will still, and always, be some reason to disriminate.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Especially with classmates and other kydz.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The reality is, children are cruel monsters that turn into even more
&gt;&gt;&gt; cruel
&gt;&gt;&gt; workforce grunts.  I've lived through it all, and even though you
&gt;&gt;&gt; might not
&gt;&gt;&gt; be overweight, kydz WILL FIND a way to make your life a living hell
&gt;&gt;&gt; for some
&gt;&gt;&gt; reason.  &quot;Her boobs are too big.  He's too short.  He's not on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; basketball team!  She has a stupid hair color.  His nose is too
&gt;&gt;&gt; small,&quot; ad
&gt;&gt;&gt; nauseum.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then that becomes:  &quot;She's undereducated.  He's *over*educated.  She
&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; like the boss's kydz.  He won't go to my home interior party....so I
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; care what happens to his job.  She won't listen to my stories about
&gt;&gt;&gt; the dog.
&gt;&gt;&gt; He voted Democratic.  She doesn't like to drink or do karaoke.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; You see?  People will *invent* reasons to be nasty to each other.  Extra
&gt;&gt;&gt; poundage not necessary.

&gt;&gt; I'm an advocate of returning the &quot;hazing&quot;, although it's a problem if
&gt;&gt; you get caught. But otherwise, it stops them cold.

&gt;&gt; For example, getting called &quot;fat&quot; when you aren't reveals that the
&gt;&gt; insulter has a fear of being fat.

&gt; What a stupid fucking thing to say. So if I call you a cunt, that means
&gt; that I am afraid of cunts? How wrong can you get.

&gt; Yes, the girl is heavy -- a few pounds heavier than I was at her age.  I

So back in the days before the fuss about obesity, your mother was forced
to put you on a diet, and this girl is even heavier?

Guess what moron, you're both fat pigs. Woman who are childfree because
they are too fat to fuck don't count as true childfree. Piss off, you don't
qualify.

All diets that restrict calories work, and if they don't restrict calories
then they aren't diets, just delusions. If you didn't lose weight it was

No dear, we have logic and employ reasoning. If BMI is incorrect for
only one person, it means you cannot rely on it.

Bodyfat percentage is a much more reliable method of measuring whether
or not someone is overweight or not. We know how to recognise faulty
measuring methods when we see them.

According to the BMI calculations, Hulk Hogan is morbidly obese.

In your strange little world view, using that criterion, nothing works as
there not one thing in the world or in history that has worked for
everyone. There are always exceptions.

Maybe you should consider paying that reasoning you claim to employ a
little more, perhaps then it might get off its ass and start working.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Sure, if you can actually calculate bodyfat percentage accurately. Calipers
don't work, adipose thickness varies all over the body, internal fat can't
be measured, full immersion works but is difficult and costly, the various
resistance type scales are at best only a guesstimate. BMI was for a quick
and easy system that fat people could use. Has to be simple as fat people
are never too bright or they wouldn't have allowed themselves to get fat.

We know how to recognise faulty

You have difficulty following things don't you? I made that point in my
first posts in this thread. I did point out that BMI is a compromise, one
that works with far more people than are exceptions.

The fact that fit or muscular people are exceptions is of little import, it
is designed as a guide for those who *are* overweight and deluding
themselves, not for those who are fit - the fit know they aren't fat.

No, that might be what you wished I sounded like, but no I don't. I am

like to try again?

If you want to insult me, it has to ring true to me, it has to be something
that causes me to take offense. For instance, calling a tall guy shorty is
hardly going to offend, him, but calling a small guy shorty might do the
trick. Is it sinking in yet? Avoid weasel words and cliches, try to be
original, be daring and try for wit.

&gt; Especially with classmates and other kydz.

&gt; The reality is, children are cruel monsters that turn into even more cruel
&gt; workforce grunts.  I've lived through it all, and even though you might not
&gt; be overweight, kydz WILL FIND a way to make your life a living hell for some
&gt; reason.  &quot;Her boobs are too big.

Boobs can never be too small for me! (But I can understand the women
having to carry that around all the time.)

I now think pleasantly about DW's DDD cups...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=78903
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I watched the video without sound.  I noticed that there were only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; three categories on the letter for weight:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Overweight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At risk for overweight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Underweight

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Where is the entry for &quot;normal weight&quot;?  The way this letter is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worded, I'd be upset too.  Every child is classified as a problem in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this system.  Every child is diagnosed with a weight problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the photograph by the article is of that form (the video won't play
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for me so I can't see the girl), then the weight assessment is based on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BMI. BMI assessed me as being of normal weight when I was 1.65m and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 49kg. Ever since then, I've disregarded anything BMI might proclaim.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's twaddle.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not twaddle you stupid cow, it is a compromise. There are
&gt;&gt;&gt; exceptions, I'm one, according to it I'm overweight, but I have a good
&gt;&gt;&gt; enough physique to have earned a good income for nearly five years
&gt;&gt;&gt; modeling.

&gt;&gt; Which issues of  News of the World? Or was it Butt Slammin' Jail Boi's

&gt; Sorry, no good going through your collection, I won't be in any of them.
&gt; You'll have to jerk off to some other guy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I only stopped because I got my face messed up in an accident.

&gt;&gt; Translation: lost his bondage mask

&gt; No, I gained one. The surgery was pretty good, but not good enough. Didn't
&gt; worry me. Lasted long enough to get me through college and graduate
&gt; school. I wouldn't have kept it up for much longer regardless of what
&gt; happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am not as stupid as you are and say it's twaddle just because I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; suit it. For most people that aren't abnormally tall or short, and who
&gt;&gt;&gt; aren't muscular, it works just fine.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Shit, are all childfree as dumb as the examples I've sen so far?

&gt;&gt; Depends, try to stop looking in the mirror princess.

&gt; Aw c'mon. You gotta be able to do better that the absolute obvious. Or
&gt; maybe you can't. What I haven't seen is someone who seems like a
&gt; successful person, educated, attractive, good career, good income and

&gt;&gt; realize their children weigh too much.
&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;&gt; Parents frequently ask him whether their children have a thyroid problem,
&gt;&gt; but that's rarely the case. &quot;It's usually a dietary and lifestyle issue.
&gt;&gt; It's very difficult for parents to confront their own food issues,&quot; Ayoob

&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;&gt; Many parents simply don't realize their children are overweight, says
&gt;&gt; Dawn Jackson Blatner, a registered dietitian in private practice in
&gt;&gt; Chicago and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. &quot;The
&gt;&gt; doctor never told them. Other kids in the class look like their child,

So how fat are you?

hey cupcake, did you know they wrote a song about stubby little you?
Sean's Song
From Brad Paisley

I work down at The Pizza Pit
And I drive an old Hyundai
I still live with my mom and dad
I'm five foot three and overweight
I'm a sci: fi fanatic, mild asthmatic
Never been to second base
But there's a whole 'nother me
That you need to see
Go check out Myspace.

'Cause online I'm out in Hollywood
I'm six foot five and I look damn good
I drive a Maserati, I'm a black belt in karate
And I love a good glass of wine
It turns girls on that I'm mysterious
I tell 'em I don't want nothing serious

'Cause even on a slow day I can have a three-way chat
With two women at one time.

I'm so much cooler online
I'm so much cooler online.

I get home I kiss my mom
And she fixes me a snack
I head down to my basement bedroom
And fire up my Mac
In real life the only time
I've ever been to L.A.
Was when I got the chance with the marching band
To play tuba in the Rose Parade.

But online I live in Malibu
I pose for Calvin Klein
I've been in GQ
I'm single and I'm rich
And I got a set of six-pack abs that would blow your mind
[these lyrics are found on http://www.songlyrics.com ]
It turns girls on that I'm mysterious
I tell 'em I don't want nothing serious
'Cause even on a slow day I can have a three-way chat
With two women at one time.

I'm so much cooler online
Yeah, I'm cooler online.

When you've got my kind of stats
It's hard to get a date
Let alone a real girlfriend
But I grow another foot and lose a bunch of weight
Every time I log in.

Online I'm out in Hollywood
I'm six foot five and I look damn good
Even on a slow day I can have a three-way chat
With two women at one time.

I'm so much cooler online
Yeah, I'm cooler online
I'm so much cooler online
Yeah, I'm cooler online.

It's a huge issue here in England too. In fact Gordon Brown was just
on the news this morning under fire for his stance on children
obesity.
Yes, it is a huge concern. I went to a school with over 2000 students
and I really don't remember seeing a &quot;fat&quot; girl. Some were plump or
big chested but, not what I'd would call &quot;fat&quot;.
I was pretty well known in school and worked on the yearbook staff and
school newpaper, so I seen pics of pretty much all the students at my
school, no memory of any &quot;fat girls&quot;
They had on the news about a dozen teenage girls working out in the
gym and &quot;these&quot; girls were fat!

Also in my high school, there were a few big guys, but they were
mostly on the football team. I played lacrosse and we had a few big
guys, but I can tell you, we were in shape. We ran 4 miles every
practice in full lacrosse gear, 2 mile before practice and 2 miles
after. And it wasn't just running, it was run, throw ball, sprint,
scoop. Eight laps around a quarter mile field. Sometime we ran the
bleechers.

All the Prime Minister is saying is for schools to have a decent
Physical Ed class for teens and healthy diet is the school system.

&gt;&gt;&gt; problem, but that's rarely the case. &quot;It's usually a dietary and
&gt;&gt;&gt; lifestyle issue. It's very difficult for parents to confront their own
&gt;&gt;&gt; food issues,&quot; Ayoob says.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many parents simply don't realize their children are overweight, says
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dawn Jackson Blatner, a registered dietitian in private practice in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chicago and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. &quot;The
&gt;&gt;&gt; doctor never told them. Other kids in the class look like their child,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and their kid seems pretty healthy,&quot; she says.

&gt; hey cupcake, did you know they wrote a song about stubby little you?
&gt; Sean's Song
&gt; From Brad Paisley

&gt; I work down at The Pizza Pit
&gt; And I drive an old Hyundai
&gt; I still live with my mom and dad
&gt; I'm five foot three and overweight
&gt; I'm a sci: fi fanatic, mild asthmatic
&gt; Never been to second base
&gt; But there's a whole 'nother me
&gt; That you need to see
&gt; Go check out Myspace.

&gt; 'Cause online I'm out in Hollywood
&gt; I'm six foot five and I look damn good
&gt; I drive a Maserati, I'm a black belt in karate
&gt; And I love a good glass of wine
&gt; It turns girls on that I'm mysterious
&gt; I tell 'em I don't want nothing serious

&gt; 'Cause even on a slow day I can have a three-way chat
&gt; With two women at one time.

&gt; I'm so much cooler online
&gt; I'm so much cooler online.

&gt; I get home I kiss my mom
&gt; And she fixes me a snack
&gt; I head down to my basement bedroom
&gt; And fire up my Mac
&gt; In real life the only time
&gt; I've ever been to L.A.
&gt; Was when I got the chance with the marching band
&gt; To play tuba in the Rose Parade.

&gt; But online I live in Malibu
&gt; I pose for Calvin Klein
&gt; I've been in GQ
&gt; I'm single and I'm rich
&gt; And I got a set of six-pack abs that would blow your mind
&gt; [these lyrics are found on http://www.songlyrics.com ]

&gt; I'm so much cooler online
&gt; Yeah, I'm cooler online.

&gt; When you've got my kind of stats
&gt; It's hard to get a date
&gt; Let alone a real girlfriend
&gt; But I grow another foot and lose a bunch of weight
&gt; Every time I log in.

&gt; Online I'm out in Hollywood

So, it doesn't work for athletic people. It doesn't work for people of
stocky build that are underweight, they register as normal. It doesn't
actually work for people of stocky build that are a normal weight
either, they register as obese on the BMI scale.

So, that's three groups of people for whom it doesn't work.

Really really reliable measuring method you have there!

Do you actually think that you could rouse indignation in me? I truly doubt
that you could arouse any emotion at all in me. I respect very few people
and only someone I respect could possibly cause me to care. I don't people
very much and trust none of them. I have little conscience, no respect for
law, and a total indifference to the future of the human race. Once I am
not here it is of no importance to me. On the other hand, I'll help bums,
and rescue old dogs. It is just conventional society that I find totally
useless. That includes kids and parents. You could not possibly imagine how
many times I have been threatened with police after telling parents what
they can do with their baby assholes. Back in February I managed to empty a
restaurant. It was the day my parole ended.

You don't meet any standards of mine, but I had hoped, well not really
hoped, I was curious about people who can't stand children. I am told my
attitude to children and their obsessive but ineffectual parents borders on
that of a sociopath, so out of curiosity I googled for others with similar
inclinations. Seems that this little group is infested with people who just
hate, children being merely one of their obsessions. I have read through a
bit of history and most - with one or two exceptions - seem to be little
more than the dregs of society.
