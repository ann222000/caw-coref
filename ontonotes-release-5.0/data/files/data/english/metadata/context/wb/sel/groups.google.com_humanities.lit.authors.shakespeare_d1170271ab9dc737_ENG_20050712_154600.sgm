&lt;&lt;Whenever a town was founded a round hole would first be dug.
In the bottom of it a STONE, LAPIS MANAlis, which represented
a gate to the Underworld, would then be embedded.

&lt;&lt;Aug. 23, 1600: [M]uch [A]do [A]bout [N]OTHING is registered.&gt;&gt;

(, October 5th and the 8th of November)

this STONE would be removed to permit the MANES to pass through.
The object of the cult rendered to them was to appease their anger.
Originally they were offered blood sacrifices, and it is
probable that the first gladiatorial combats were instituted
in their honour.&gt;&gt; -- Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology

From a lecture presented by Sir Laurence Gardner,
at the 1999 NEXUS Conference held in Sydney,

olHill/Parliament/3460/lords4.­html

&lt;&lt;The Carpathian princes of the Sidhé...were of the
Tuatha Dé Danann Fairy strain. They reigned in regional
Mesopotamia from the 18th century BC and, from about 1600 BC,
they governed all Babylonia for another 500 years.

This particular race developed one of the oldest Ring cultures in
history and, in ancient Ireland, they were the sacred race of the
god-men: the VERE-BOLG. The greatest of their Ring shrines still exists,
known as Newgrange today - originally a sacred royal seat identified
as a RATH. These shrines (&quot;fairy rings&quot;) were called the Creachaire
(TEMPLE-TOMBS), and they housed the RATHs which were TURF-coVEREd
mound dwellings constructed upon a framework of poles. They were
Portals to the Netherworld, the sacred domain of ancestral souls.
They were the seats of the Portal Guardians: the OUPIRES,
the Ring Lords of the Sidhé, who were later dubbed &quot;VAMPIRES&quot;.

One of history's best known Grail Fairies was Princess Melusine,
daughter of the Pictish King, Elinas of Alba - a descendant of the
2nd-century King VERE of Caledonia, Lord of the DRAGON. In 733,
Melusine (maintaining the family heritage) married Rainfroi DE VERE,
Prince of Anjou, and among their offspring was Count Maelo, the
commander of Emperor Charlemagne's army. From Maelo's marriage
to Charlemagne's sister sprang the Elf King VERE Counts of Guisnes
who became England's Great Chamberlains and Earls of Oxford.

In the Arthurian &amp; Magdalene traditions of the Ladies of the Lake
(as discussed in Bloodline of the Holy Grail), Melusine was a
&quot;fountain fey&quot; - an enchantress of the Underwood. Her fountain
at Verrières en Forez was called Lusina (meaning &quot;Light-bringer&quot;).

The Fount of Melusine was said to be located deep within a thicket
WOOD in Anjou, and Melusine was often depicted as a MERMAID
(as she is still beguilingly portrayed in an old painting
at Count DRACULA's Bran Castle in Romania).&gt;&gt;
----------------------------­------------------------------­----------
Sitting alone upon my thought in melancholy mood,
In sight of sea, and at my back an ancient hoary WOOD,
I saw a fair young lady come, her secret fears to wail,
Clad all in colour of a nun, and coVEREd with a VEIL;
Yet (for the day was calm and clear) I might discern her face,
As one might see a damask ROSE hid under crystal GLASS.

THREE TIMES, with her soft hand, full hard on her left side she KNOCKS,
And sigh'd so SORE as might have mov'd some pity in the rocks;
From sighs and shedding amber tears into sweet song she brake,
When thus the ECHO answered her to EVERy word she spake:

Oh heavens! who was the first that bred in me this fever? VERE (Ver.)
Who was the first that gave the wound whose fear I wear for ever? VERE.
What tyrant, CUPID, to my harm usurps thy golden quiver? VERE.
What sight first caught this heart and can from bondage it deliver?
VERE. -- The Earle of Oxforde.

_Venus and Adonis_ Stanza 70

'What! canst thou talk?' quoth she, 'hast thou a tongue?
[O], would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!
[T]hy MERMAID's voice hath done me double wrong;
[I] had my load before, now press'd with bearing:
[M]elodious discord, heavenly tune harshsounding,
[E]ar's deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-SORE wounding.

'By this, poor WAT, far off upon a HILL,
Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,
To harken if his foes pursue him still:
Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;
And now his grief may be compared well
To one SORE sick that hears the passing-bell.

'If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,
And EVERy tongue more moving than your own,
Bewitching like the wanton MERMAID's songs,
Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown
For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,
And will not let a false sound enter there;

(begging your pardon, Miss Wardour) and fruits of the bottomless
pit,---had leaped out of our libraries, for the accommodation
of grocers, candlemakers, soapsellers, and other worldly
occupiers, we might have been therewith contented. But to put our
ancient chronicles, our NOBLE histories, our learned commentaries,
and national MUNIMENTS, to such offices of contempt and subjection,
has greatly degraded our nation, and showed ourselves
dishonoured in the eyes of posterity to the utmost stretch
of TIME---O negligence most unfriendly to our land!''

FOAL &lt;=&gt; LOAF
------------------------------­------------------------------­---------

&lt;&lt;...Lughnasadh is named for Lugh, the Celtic deity who presides over
the arts &amp; sciences. According to Celtic legend, Lugh decreed that a
commemorative feast be held each year at the beginning of the harvest
season to honor his foster mother, Tailtiu. Tailtiu was the royal
Lady of the VERE-BOLG. After her defeat by the Tuatha De Dannan,
she was obliged by them to clear a vast forest for the purpose of
planting grain. She died of exhaustion in the attempt. The legend
states that she was buried beneath *a great mound*, at the spot
where the first feast of Lughnasadh was held in Ireland, the hill of
Tailte. At this gathering were held games &amp; contests of skill as well
as a great feast made up of the first fruits of the summer harvest.
With the coming of Christianity to the Celtic lands, the old festival
of Lughnasadh took on Christian symbolism. LOAVES of bread were BAKED
from the first of the harvested grain and placed on the church altar
on *the first Sunday of August* . The Christianized name for
the feast of Lughnasadh is LAMMAS which means &quot;LOAF mass&quot;.&gt;&gt;

Ophelia They say the owl was a baker's daughter.

&lt;&lt;Jesus, in the guise of a beggar, came to a baker's shop to ask
for some food. The baker put some dough into the oven to make a LOAF
of bread for the supposed beggar, but the baker's daughter, overcome
with niggardliness, decided that the gift was too great and cut the
dough in half. She was promptly turned into an owl as punishment&gt;&gt;

P. Ovidius Naso, Amores

IV multa miser TIMEO, quia feci multa proterve, 45
exemplique metu torqueor, ecce, mei.

VI nec mora, venit amor?non umbras nocte volantis,
non TIMEO strictas in mea fata manus.
te nimium lentum TIMEO, tibi blandior uni; 15
tu, me quo possis perdere, fulmen habes.

XV Vilia miretur vulgus; mihi flavus Apollo+
Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua,
Sustineamque coma metuentem frigora myrtum,
Atque a sollicito multus amante legar!
Pascitur in vivis Livor; post fata quiescit+,
Cum suus ex merito quemque tuetur honos.
Ergo etiam cum me supremus adederit ignis++,
Vivam, parsque mei multa superstes erit.

Marlowe translation:

Let base conceited wits admire vilde things,
Faire Phoebus leade me to the Muses springs.
About my head be QUIVERING Mirtle wound,
And in sad lovers heads let me be found.
The living, not the dead can ENVIE bite,
For after death all men receive their right:
Then though death rackes my bones in funerall fler,
lie live, and as he puls me downe, mount higher

Ben Jonson translation:

Kneele hindes to trash: me let bright Phoebus swell,
With cups full flowing from the Muses well.
The frost-drad myrtle shall impale my head,
And of sad lovers Ile be often read.
ENUY the living, not the dead, doth bite.
For after death all men receive their right.
Then when this body falls in funeral fire,
MY NAME SHALL LIVE, and my best part aspire.

And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
And in that glorious supposition think
He gains by death that hath such means to die:
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!

And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
To hear the sea-maid's music.

About him were a press of gaping faces,
Which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice;
All jointly listening, but with several graces,
As if some MERMAID did their ears entice,
Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
The scalps of many, almost hid behind,
To jump up higher seem'd, to mock the mind.

TALBOT: He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.
As who should say 'When I am DEAD AND GONE,

&lt;&lt;The PlantaGENETs themselves were a junior branch of the
House of Anjou, whose senior branch was the House of VERE.
In 1861, the noted royal historian Baron Thomas Babington Macaulay
described the VEREs as &quot;the longest and most illustrious line of nobles
that England has ever seen&quot;. Their ancestry was jointly PICTISH and
MEROVINGIAN, descending from the ancient Grail House of Scythia. Here
was a true kingly line of the Elven Race, and it was for this reason
that OBERON (a variant of AUBREY/Albrey, the historical Elf King) became
Shakespeare's King of the Fairies. Such was the translatory nature
of all Rosicrucian symbology, whether portrayed in stories, artwork,
watermarks or the Tarot. In 1408, Edward de VERE's ancestor, Richard
(Lord Chamberlain &amp; 11th Earl of Oxford), had been invested as a Knight
of the Garter by King Henry IV at Windsor Castle. Invested at the
same time was King Sigismund of Hungary, who had revived the ancient
Egyptian Order of the DRAGON - within which Richard de VERE held the
hereditary distinction of Lord DRACONIS.&gt;&gt; - Sir Laurence Gardner
