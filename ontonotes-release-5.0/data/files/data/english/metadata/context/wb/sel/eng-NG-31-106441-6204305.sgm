Hard-hitting endeavour captures Ig Nobel

Steve Nadis, Boston

Woodpecker research flies away with alternative prize.

When Ivan Schwab first learned that he was slated to win an Ig Nobel
prize for explaining why woodpeckers don't get headaches, his response
was perhaps predictable for a man whose past had come back to haunt
him: he denied everything.

"I didn't do the work," Schwab, an ophthalmologist at the University of
California, Davis, told the event's organizer after being informed of
the dubious honour in store for him. Ig Nobel prizes are given for
"achievements that make people laugh, and then make them think". Schwab
gave credit instead to Philip May, a former psychiatry professor at the
University of California, Los Angeles, who died in 1986. A deal was
soon reached: Schwab agreed to share the 2006 Ornithology prize with
May for research initiated by May and associates in 1976 and taken up
by Schwab a quarter of a century later.

To May, the woodpecker represented a unique "experiment in Nature" and
a chance to understand how an animal could continually use its head as
a battering ram without sustaining headaches, concussions or other
brain injuries.

A pileated woodpecker may strike its beak against a tree 12,000 times a
day for the purposes of feeding, nest construction, ritual drumming (to
claim territory and attract mates), and even to relieve tension. They
peck at rates of up to 20 times a second - each blow is comparable to
striking a wall, face-first, at 25 kilometres an hour. This results in
deceleration forces of about 1,200g, which is hundreds of times more
than astronauts endure. Given the ill effects of headbanging seen in
humans, May wondered why the countryside was not "littered with dazed
and dying woodpeckers".

Clearly, woodpeckers do not get headaches or serious head injuries, May
reasoned, or they would stop pecking. So how do they prevent it? After
dissecting the heads and beaks of two woodpeckers (which were compared
with similar toucan samples) and analysing high-speed photographs of
live woodpecker strikes, May and his colleagues advanced several
explanations (P. R. May et al. Lancet i (7957), 454-455; 1976; Arch.
Neurol. 36, 370-373; 1979).

Striking stat: the pileated woodpecker hits its beak against a tree
around 12,000 times a day.
The woodpecker brain has relatively little cerebrospinal fluid,
reducing the transmission of shock waves, and it is tightly packed in
dense, spongy bone that keeps internal movements to a minimum. Muscles
encircling the skull serve as shock absorbers, "holding the bill in
resilient rigidity".

Like boxers, woodpeckers tense their neck muscles before absorbing a
blow. And their drilling trajectory is essentially linear, with little
or no rotation of the head, to avoid shearing forces. A third eyelid
closes a millisecond before each strike to secure and shield the eye.

Schwab, a bird enthusiast since childhood, read May's 1976 Lancet
article and later papers with keen interest. On occasion, he mentioned
the woodpecker example in ophthalmology classes and at conferences,
citing the potential for retinal damage, and always engaged his
audience. Yet he yearned to do more on the subject.

He got his chance in 2000, when he became an editor of the British
Journal of Ophthalmology. In 2002, Schwab put a woodpecker on the
journal's cover and wrote an essay presenting May's findings and
discussing anatomical features that might provide further protection,
as a result of dissections and CT scans he had performed of a pileated
woodpecker head (I. R. Schwab Br. J. Ophthalmol. 86, 843; 2002).

But Schwab's main objective was to bring attention to May's neglected
work. "We can't all win Nobel prizes," he says. "But we can look at the
world around us and ask questions, just as May did." In his own field,
Schwab asks, for example, why polar bears don't get ultraviolet
keratopathy - sunburn of the eyes. How can a jellyfish, which lacks a
brain, process the visual information it gets from its eyes? Why do
scallops have hundreds of eyes and giant clams thousands? Questions
such as these, says Schwab, are "the basis of discovery".

For that reason, Schwab says he is proud to be associated with May's
research and was delighted to receive an Ig Nobel on his behalf at the
ceremony held at Harvard University on 5 October (see 'The Ig Nobel
winners' circle'). He certainly got into the spirit of things,
attending the festivities in a woodpecker headdress. As for his initial
reluctance, Schwab explains: "I was embarrassed to receive an Ig Nobel
prize for work I did not do." In that respect, he stands out from
previous winners, who were embarrassed to receive Ig Nobels for work
they did do.
