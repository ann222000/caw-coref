Subject: Dandiya night @ AG

Hi All,

Yesterday evening Deepak P &amp; I visited AP, Some ritual for navaratri was
going on thr. We waited till it was over, seeing the mood of children after
the ritual, we decided to drop the  idea of teaching them... and
theeeennnnnnn..it was fun we played  a lot   :D

We also had a chat with kaka, while our discussion with him, idea of having
a Dandiya night @ AG popped up in our mind, we shared this with kaka &amp; he
agreed to it in a sec....he has also proposed the day of Khojagiri Purnima
i.e. October 25 Thursday, for this.....proposed timings are 8 pm  to 10 pm .

Also, Kaka has promised to treat us all with a special hot milk which is
prepared exclusively for Khojagiri purnima ;).

So mates wat say...does this makes sense to u also ...if yes please respond
back with your availability status, as we need to inform kaka about the
same.....kaka has also promised that he will play some good nos. for us on
Harmonium.

However, we need to sort out the problem of playing Dandiya... at least me &amp;
Deepak have no idea about it L. So girls please come forward &amp; suggest if u
can do something...as far as getting late is concerned. I propose that those
who are having family, please bring them along with you...just a thought

Request you to please revert back ASAP.

We also met 2 DI volunteers Kapil &amp; .(I forgot L).they have also promised to
join us on the day.

Over n Out

Hi,

I would have loved to be a part of this. but once again I have a problem. we
have a similar competition (dandiya) in our society that day only where me
and my wife are the lead couple. I can't back out from this competition.

And also I would not be here in Pune for the coming weekend. Otherwise I
would have helped in practicing.

Anyway, I am sure you guys will again rock the Night at AG. Enjoy n do send
the snaps.

Regards,

Piyush Chhajed

Subject: Dandiya night @ AG

Hi All,

Yesterday evening Deepak P &amp; I visited AP, Some ritual for navaratri was
going on thr. We waited till it was over, seeing the mood of children after
the ritual, we decided to drop the  idea of teaching them... and
theeeennnnnnn..it was fun we played  a lot   :D

We also had a chat with kaka, while our discussion with him, idea of having
a Dandiya night @ AG popped up in our mind, we shared this with kaka &amp; he
agreed to it in a sec....he has also proposed the day of Khojagiri Purnima
i.e. October 25 Thursday, for this.....proposed timings are 8 pm  to 10 pm .

Also, Kaka has promised to treat us all with a special hot milk which is
prepared exclusively for Khojagiri purnima ;).

So mates wat say...does this makes sense to u also ...if yes please respond
back with your availability status, as we need to inform kaka about the
same.....kaka has also promised that he will play some good nos. for us on
Harmonium.

However, we need to sort out the problem of playing Dandiya... at least me &amp;
Deepak have no idea about it :-(. So girls please come forward &amp; suggest if
u can do something...as far as getting late is concerned. I propose that
those who are having family, please bring them along with you...just a
thought

Request you to please revert back ASAP.

We also met 2 DI volunteers Kapil &amp; .(I forgot :-().they have also promised
to join us on the day.

Over n Out

Ashish

Good Morning folks

I have the CDs of Dandiya songs and if anyone else also have it, then please
bring.
Make sure that they have MP3 CD player available, not only CD player,
because CDs are in MP3  music format.

Good Day

&gt; &gt; Hi,

&gt; &gt; I would have loved to be a part of this… but once again I have a
&gt; &gt; problem… we have a similar competition (dandiya) in our society that day
&gt; &gt; only where me and my wife are the lead couple. I can't back out from this
&gt; &gt; competition.

&gt; &gt; And also I would not be here in Pune for the coming weekend. Otherwise I
&gt; &gt; would have helped in practicing.

&gt; &gt; Anyway, I am sure you guys will again rock the Night at AG. Enjoy n do
&gt; &gt; send the snaps.

&gt; &gt; Hi All,

&gt; &gt; Yesterday evening Deepak P &amp; I visited AP, Some ritual for navaratri was
&gt; &gt; going on thr. We waited till it was over, seeing the mood of children after
&gt; &gt; the ritual, we decided to drop the  idea of teaching them... and
&gt; &gt; theeeennnnnnn….it was fun we played  a lot   :D

&gt; &gt; We also had a chat with kaka, while our discussion with him, idea of
&gt; &gt; having a Dandiya night @ AG popped up in our mind, we shared this with kaka
&gt; &gt; &amp; he agreed to it in a sec....he has also proposed the day of Khojagiri
&gt; &gt; Purnima i.e. October 25 Thursday, for this.....proposed timings are 8 pm
&gt; &gt;  to 10 pm .

&gt; &gt;  Also, Kaka has promised to treat us all with a special hot milk which
&gt; &gt; is prepared exclusively for Khojagiri purnima ;).

&gt; &gt; So mates wat say...does this makes sense to u also ...if yes please
&gt; &gt; respond back with your availability status, as we need to inform kaka about
&gt; &gt; the same.....kaka has also promised that he will play some good nos. for us
&gt; &gt; on Harmonium.

&gt; &gt; However, we need to sort out the problem of playing Dandiya….. at least
&gt; &gt; me &amp; Deepak have no idea about it L… So girls please come forward &amp;
&gt; &gt; suggest if u can do something…..as far as getting late is concerned… I
&gt; &gt; propose that those who are having family, please bring them along with
&gt; &gt; you…….just a thought

&gt; &gt; Request you to please revert back ASAP.

&gt; &gt; We also met 2 DI volunteers Kapil &amp; …(I forgot L)…they have also
&gt; &gt; promised to join us on the day.

&gt; &gt; Over n Out

Hi,

I would have loved to be a part of this. but once again I have a problem. we
have a similar competition (dandiya) in our society that day only where me
and my wife are the lead couple. I can't back out from this competition.

And also I would not be here in Pune for the coming weekend. Otherwise I
would have helped in practicing.

Anyway, I am sure you guys will again rock the Night at AG. Enjoy n do send
the snaps.

Piyush Chhajed

Subject: Dandiya night @ AG

Hi All,

Yesterday evening Deepak P &amp; I visited AP, Some ritual for navaratri was
going on thr. We waited till it was over, seeing the mood of children after
the ritual, we decided to drop the  idea of teaching them... and
theeeennnnnnn..it was fun we played  a lot   :D

We also had a chat with kaka, while our discussion with him, idea of having
a Dandiya night @ AG popped up in our mind, we shared this with kaka &amp; he
agreed to it in a sec....he has also proposed the day of Khojagiri Purnima
i.e. October 25 Thursday, for this.....proposed timings are 8 pm  to 10 pm .

Also, Kaka has promised to treat us all with a special hot milk which is
prepared exclusively for Khojagiri purnima ;).

So mates wat say...does this makes sense to u also ...if yes please respond
back with your availability status, as we need to inform kaka about the
same.....kaka has also promised that he will play some good nos. for us on
Harmonium.

However, we need to sort out the problem of playing Dandiya... at least me &amp;
Deepak have no idea about it :-( . So girls please come forward &amp; suggest if
u can do something...as far as getting late is concerned. I propose that
those who are having family, please bring them along with you...just a
thought

Request you to please revert back ASAP.

We also met 2 DI volunteers Kapil &amp; .(I forgot :-().they have also promised
to join us on the day.

Over n Out

Ashish

Hi,

I would have loved to be a part of this... but once again I have
a problem... we have a similar competition (dandiya) in our society that
day only where me and my wife are the lead couple. I can't back out from
this competition.

And also I would not be here in Pune for the coming weekend.
Otherwise I would have helped in practicing.

Anyway, I am sure you guys will again rock the Night at AG.
Enjoy n do send the snaps.

Piyush Chhajed

Subject: Dandiya night @ AG

Hi All,

Yesterday evening Deepak P &amp; I visited AP, Some ritual for
navaratri was going on thr. We waited till it was over, seeing the mood
of children after the ritual, we decided to drop the  idea of teaching
them... and theeeennnnnnn....it was fun we played  a lot   :D

We also had a chat with kaka, while our discussion with him,
idea of having a Dandiya night @ AG popped up in our mind, we shared
this with kaka &amp; he agreed to it in a sec....he has also proposed the
day of Khojagiri Purnima i.e. October 25 Thursday, for this.....proposed
timings are 8 pm  to 10 pm .

Also, Kaka has promised to treat us all with a special hot milk
which is prepared exclusively for Khojagiri purnima ;).

So mates wat say...does this makes sense to u also ...if yes
please respond back with your availability status, as we need to inform
kaka about the same.....kaka has also promised that he will play some
good nos. for us on Harmonium.

However, we need to sort out the problem of playing Dandiya.....
at least me &amp; Deepak have no idea about it :-(... So girls please come
forward &amp; suggest if u can do something.....as far as getting late is
concerned... I propose that those who are having family, please bring
them along with you.......just a thought

Request you to please revert back ASAP.

We also met 2 DI volunteers Kapil &amp; ...(I forgot :-()...they
have also promised to join us on the day.

Over n Out

Ashish

Hi Guys,

Somehow I was out of the communication and hence couldn't replied. Sorry for
that.

Since we have puja at home for Kojagiri, we (me &amp; Radhika) won't be able to
make it.  However one of our friend Amit Dabekar, who is in the
communication wants to join. He will confirm his presence by end of the
day.  Tomorrow we will introduce him to you and leave quickly.

Regarding my involvement for next 2-3 weeks, I guess it is very difficult
for me to be there at AG for next couple of weekends. But if you are
planning any similar event during Diwali we will surely join it. For next
two weekends I will be out of station.

Regards,
Vasant

Hello All,

My $.02s -

1. Dandiya Sticks - I think, we should buy 40 pairs. There may be last
minute additions. Plus, Kaka has invited some trustees also.

2. Are we arranging Dandiya Cassettes/CDs also ? Kaka already has the
music system.

3. So far only 9 persons have confirmed the participation -
- Deepak P
- Deepak S
- Ekata
- Gagan
- Ashish
- Priyanka
- Pallavi
- Sumedha (will join us little late)
- Sameer

There is a request from Kaka that we should inform him of the possible
number by today evening. Depending upon our number, he has to arrange
for Hot Milk, some snacks etc.

4. Apart from Sponge Cake - thanks to Priyanka, can we think of some
other small snack items also ? Only thing is kids would have their
dinner before our event or immediately after our event.

Hi,

I would have loved to be a part of this... but once again I have
a problem... we have a similar competition (dandiya) in our society that
day only where me and my wife are the lead couple. I can't back out from
this competition.

And also I would not be here in Pune for the coming weekend.
Otherwise I would have helped in practicing.

Anyway, I am sure you guys will again rock the Night at AG.
Enjoy n do send the snaps.

&gt; Hi All,

&gt; Yesterday evening Deepak P &amp; I visited AP, Some ritual for navaratri was
&gt; going on thr. We waited till it was over, seeing the mood of children after
&gt; the ritual, we decided to drop the  idea of teaching them... and
&gt; theeeennnnnnn….it was fun we played  a lot   :D

&gt; We also had a chat with kaka, while our discussion with him, idea of
&gt; having a Dandiya night @ AG popped up in our mind, we shared this with kaka
&gt; &amp; he agreed to it in a sec....he has also proposed the day of Khojagiri
&gt; Purnima i.e. October 25 Thursday, for this.....proposed timings are 8 pm
&gt;  to 10 pm .

&gt;  Also, Kaka has promised to treat us all with a special hot milk which is
&gt; prepared exclusively for Khojagiri purnima ;).

Yes Jyoti, Nice idea..

This can be do this easily and can add more fun in the entire event :-)

And yes, we have Dhoom organizers like Saurabh and Swati with us.. So no
problems at all..

But I am worried about the timing..

Sameer sir,

You have better idea about overall schedule of program, is it possible to
add this? Will you please confirm with kaka?

Thanks and Regards,

Hi,

I would have loved to be a part of this. but once again I have a problem. we
have a similar competition (dandiya) in our society that day only where me
and my wife are the lead couple. I can't back out from this competition.

And also I would not be here in Pune for the coming weekend. Otherwise I
would have helped in practicing.

Anyway, I am sure you guys will again rock the Night at AG. Enjoy n do send
the snaps.

Hi Deepak,

Timings of the program are 8-10.

One more thing I would like to emphasize here is, I think program might get
extended till 10.30, so I think we all (esp. girls)shud finish our dinner
before program.just a thought.

Thanks

Yes Jyoti, Nice idea..

This can be do this easily and can add more fun in the entire event J

And yes, we have Dhoom organizers like Saurabh and Swati with us.. So no
problems at all..

But I am worried about the timing..

Sameer sir,

You have better idea about overall schedule of program, is it possible to
add this? Will you please confirm with kaka?

Thanks and Regards,

-Deepak

Schedule could be:

*       We can have a small event involving both the kids as well as the
volunteers.

*       This could be something similar to what we had in Dhoom at
Manavyya.......like we can have small small groups comprising of both kids
as well as the volunteers.Then each team can prepare a dance item or any
other thing like a small skit or a song to be presented for arnd 3
mins.........This whole event can be for 45 mins.....or so........

*       Then we could ask Kaka to sing for us.........heard he plays
wonderful harmonium!! Other DI volunteers can also display their talents..:)

*       Then after that if we are left with some more time we could have
some other games like antakshari or just sit and share our experiences......

What say dosto???....................if you all agree to it...............or

Subject: Dandiya night @ AG

Hi All,

Yesterday evening Deepak P &amp; I visited AP, Some ritual for navaratri was going on thr. We waited till it was over, seeing the mood of children after the ritual, we decided to drop the  idea of teaching them... and theeeennnnnnn....it was fun we played  a lot   :D

We also had a chat with kaka, while our discussion with him, idea of having a Dandiya night @ AG popped up in our mind, we shared this with kaka &amp; he agreed to it in a sec....he has also proposed the day of Khojagiri Purnima i.e. October 25 Thursday, for this.....proposed timings are 8 pm  to 10 pm .

Also, Kaka has promised to treat us all with a special hot milk which is prepared exclusively for Khojagiri purnima ;).

So mates wat say...does this makes sense to u also ...if yes please respond back with your availability status, as we need to inform kaka about the same.....kaka has also promised that he will play some good nos. for us on Harmonium.

Yes Jyoti, Nice idea....

This can be do this easily and can add more fun in the entire event :-)

And yes, we have Dhoom organizers like Saurabh and Swati with us.... So no problems at all....

But I am worried about the timing....

Sameer sir,

You have better idea about overall schedule of program, is it possible to add this? Will you please confirm with kaka?

Thanks and Regards,

Schedule could be:

*       Puja can be performed by Kaka or some elder person as they say.

*       We can have a small event involving both the kids as well as the volunteers.

*       This could be something similar to what we had in Dhoom at Manavyya.......like we can have small small groups comprising of both kids as well as the volunteers.Then each team can prepare a dance item or any other thing like a small skit or a song to be presented for arnd 3 mins.........This whole event can be for 45 mins.....or so........

*       Then we could ask Kaka to sing for us.........heard he plays wonderful harmonium!! Other DI volunteers can also display their talents..:)

*       Then after that if we are left with some more time we could have some other games like antakshari or just sit and share our experiences......

What say dosto???....................if you all agree to it...............or you have got some other suggestions......let your ideas flow...........but then time bahut kaam hai..........so atleast confirm your presence...........by atleast a single line reply..:)

Hi,

I would have loved to be a part of this... but once again I have a problem... we have a similar competition (dandiya) in our society that day only where me and my wife are the lead couple. I can't back out from this competition.

And also I would not be here in Pune for the coming weekend. Otherwise I would have helped in practicing.

Anyway, I am sure you guys will again rock the Night at AG. Enjoy n do send the snaps.

Hi Deepak,

Timings of the program are 8-10.

One more thing I would like to emphasize here is, I think program might get extended till 10.30, so I think we all (esp. girls)shud finish our dinner before program...just a thought.

Thanks

Subject: RE: Dandiya night @ AG

Hello All,

I spoke to Kaka and have informed him of our plan. He is OK.

Overall schedule may be like this -
8.00 PM to 8.15 PM - Prayer
8.15 PM to 8.30 PM - Formation of groups with the kids. Since there are 15 volunteers and around 30 kids, we will form groups of 4-5 children each. Each of these groups will have at least 2 volunteers.
8.30 PM to 8.45 PM - Practice of dance steps with the kids
8.45 PM to 9.15 PM - Dance of the individual groups
9.15 PM to 9.30 PM - Dance of the whole groups together
9.30 PM to 9.45 PM - Program of Kaka
9.45 PM to 10.00 PM - Hot Milk etc.

We can discuss it tomorrow also.

Above schedule is really aggressive. But the kids have their term-end exam on the very next day i.e. 26-Oct - It's going to be Hindi paper. So we must finish before 10.00 PM. (Sorry, if this is a dampner. But hope, you can understand).

There may be some surprise visitors with me tomorrow. Ashish Bhai - Please don't disclose.

Thanks and Regards,

Sameer

Yes Jyoti, Nice idea....

This can be do this easily and can add more fun in the entire event :-)

And yes, we have Dhoom organizers like Saurabh and Swati with us.... So no problems at all....

But I am worried about the timing....

Sameer sir,

You have better idea about overall schedule of program, is it possible to add this? Will you please confirm with kaka?

Thanks and Regards,

-Deepak

*       This could be something similar to what we had in Dhoom at Manavyya.......like we can have small small groups comprising of both kids as well as the volunteers.Then each team can prepare a dance item or any other thing like a small skit or a song to be presented for arnd 3 mins.........This whole event can be for 45 mins.....or so........

*       Then we could ask Kaka to sing for us.........heard he plays wonderful harmonium!! Other DI volunteers can also display their talents..:)

*       Then after that if we are left with some more time we could have some other games like antakshari or just sit and share our experiences......

Hello All,

I spoke to Kaka and have informed him of our plan. He is OK.

Overall schedule may be like this -
8.00 PM to 8.15 PM - Prayer
8.15 PM to 8.30 PM - Formation of groups with the kids. Since there are 15
volunteers and around 30 kids, we will form groups of 4-5 children each.
Each of these groups will have at least 2 volunteers.
8.30 PM to 8.45 PM - Practice of dance steps with the kids
8.45 PM to 9.15 PM - Dance of the individual groups
9.15 PM to 9.30 PM - Dance of the whole groups together
9.30 PM to 9.45 PM - Program of Kaka
9.45 PM to 10.00 PM - Hot Milk etc.

We can discuss it tomorrow also.

Above schedule is really aggressive. But the kids have their term-end exam
on the very next day i.e. 26-Oct - It's going to be Hindi paper. So we must
finish before 10.00 PM. (Sorry, if this is a dampner. But hope, you can
understand).

There may be some surprise visitors with me tomorrow. Ashish Bhai - Please
don't disclose.

Thanks and Regards,

Sameer

Hi Deepak,

Timings of the program are 8-10.

One more thing I would like to emphasize here is, I think program might
get extended till 10.30, so I think we all (esp. girls)shud finish our
dinner before program...just a thought.

Thanks

Good Morning folks

I have the CDs of Dandiya songs and if anyone else also have it, then
please bring.
Make sure that they have MP3 CD player available, not only CD player,
because CDs are in MP3  music format.

Good Morning folks

I have the CDs of Dandiya songs and if anyone else also have it, then please
bring.
Make sure that they have MP3 CD player available, not only CD player,
because CDs are in MP3  music format.

Good Day

&gt; Timings of the program are 8-10.

&gt; One more thing I would like to emphasize here is, I think program might

&gt; This can be do this easily and can add more fun in the entire event J

&gt; And yes, we have Dhoom organizers like Saurabh and Swati with us…. So no
&gt; problems at all….

&gt; But I am worried about the timing….

&gt; Sameer sir,

&gt; You have better idea about overall schedule of program, is it possible to
&gt; add this? Will you please confirm with kaka?

&gt; Hi all !

&gt; Great to see such an enthu..............now that we have such a good
&gt; number of people to attend the event I would suggest that we shud plan up
&gt; the event too...........I knw everything is going to be on the
&gt; spot........fir b just a little bit of planning.

&gt; Schedule could be:

&gt;    - Puja can be performed by Kaka or some elder person as they say.

&gt;    - We can have a small event involving both the kids as well as the
&gt;    volunteers.

&gt;    - This could be something similar to what we had in Dhoom at
&gt;    Manavyya.......like we can have small small groups comprising of both kids
&gt;    as well as the volunteers.Then each team can prepare a dance item or
&gt;    any other thing like a small skit or a song to be presented for arnd 3
&gt;    mins.........This whole event can be for 45 mins.....or so........

&gt;    - Then we could ask Kaka to sing for us.........heard he plays
&gt;    wonderful harmonium!! Other DI volunteers can also display their talents..:)

&gt;    - Then after that if we are left with some more time we could have
&gt;    some other games like antakshari or just sit and share our experiences......

&gt;  What say dosto???.....................if you all agree to
&gt; it...............or you have got some other suggestions......let your ideas
&gt; flow...........but then time bahut kaam hai..........so atleast confirm your
&gt; presence...........by atleast a single line reply..:)

&gt; &gt; number of people to attend the event I would suggest that we shud plan up
&gt; &gt; the event too...........I knw everything is going to be on the
&gt; &gt; spot........fir b just a little bit of planning.

&gt; &gt; Schedule could be:

&gt; &gt;    - Puja can be performed by Kaka or some elder person as they say.

&gt; &gt;    - We can have a small event involving both the kids as well as the
&gt; &gt;    volunteers.

&gt; &gt;    - This could be something similar to what we had in Dhoom at
&gt; &gt;    Manavyya.......like we can have small small groups comprising of both kids
&gt; &gt;    as well as the volunteers.Then each team can prepare a dance item
&gt; &gt;    or any other thing like a small skit or a song to be presented for arnd 3
&gt; &gt;    mins.........This whole event can be for 45 mins.....or so........

&gt; &gt;    - Then we could ask Kaka to sing for us.........heard he plays
&gt; &gt;    wonderful harmonium!! Other DI volunteers can also display their talents..:)

&gt; &gt;    - Then after that if we are left with some more time we could have
&gt; &gt;    some other games like antakshari or just sit and share our experiences......

&gt; &gt;  What say dosto???.....................if you all agree to
&gt; &gt; it...............or you have got some other suggestions......let your ideas
&gt; &gt; flow...........but then time bahut kaam hai..........so atleast confirm your
&gt; &gt; presence...........by atleast a single line reply..:)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Deepak,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Timings of the program are 8-10.

&gt; &gt; &gt; One more thing I would like to emphasize here is, I think program
&gt; &gt; &gt; might get extended till 10..30, so I think we all (esp. girls)shud finish
&gt; &gt; &gt; our dinner before program…just a thought.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes Jyoti, Nice idea….

&gt; &gt; &gt; This can be do this easily and can add more fun in the entire event J

&gt; &gt; &gt; And yes, we have Dhoom organizers like Saurabh and Swati with us…. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; no problems at all….

&gt; &gt; &gt; But I am worried about the timing….

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sameer sir,

&gt; &gt; &gt; You have better idea about overall schedule of program, is it possible
&gt; &gt; &gt; to add this? Will you please confirm with kaka?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Deepak,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Timings of the program are 8-10.

&gt; &gt; &gt; One more thing I would like to emphasize here is, I think program
&gt; &gt; &gt; might get extended till 10..30, so I think we all (esp. girls)shud finish
&gt; &gt; &gt; our dinner before program…just a thought.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ashish

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes Jyoti, Nice idea….

&gt; &gt; &gt; This can be do this easily and can add more fun in the entire event J

&gt; &gt; &gt; And yes, we have Dhoom organizers like Saurabh and Swati with us…. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; no problems at all….

&gt; &gt; &gt; But I am worried about the timing….

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sameer sir,

&gt; &gt; &gt; You have better idea about overall schedule of program, is it possible
&gt; &gt; &gt; to add this? Will you please confirm with kaka?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks and Regards,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all !

&gt; &gt; &gt; Great to see such an enthu..............now that we have such a good
&gt; &gt; &gt; number of people to attend the event I would suggest that we shud plan up
&gt; &gt; &gt; the event too...........I knw everything is going to be on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; spot........fir b just a little bit of planning.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Schedule could be:

&gt; &gt; &gt;    - Puja can be performed by Kaka or some elder person as they
&gt; &gt; &gt;    say.

&gt; &gt; &gt;    - We can have a small event involving both the kids as well as
&gt; &gt; &gt;    the volunteers.

&gt; &gt; &gt;    - This could be something similar to what we had in Dhoom at
&gt; &gt; &gt;    Manavyya.......like we can have small small groups comprising of both kids
&gt; &gt; &gt;    as well as the volunteers.Then each team can prepare a dance
&gt; &gt; &gt;    item or any other thing like a small skit or a song to be presented for arnd
&gt; &gt; &gt;    3 mins.........This whole event can be for 45 mins.....or so........

&gt; &gt; &gt;    - Then we could ask Kaka to sing for us.........heard he plays
&gt; &gt; &gt;    wonderful harmonium!! Other DI volunteers can also display their talents..:)

&gt; &gt; &gt;    - Then after that if we are left with some more time we could
&gt; &gt; &gt;    have some other games like antakshari or just sit and share our
&gt; &gt; &gt;    experiences......

&gt; &gt; &gt; What say dosto???.....................if you all agree to
&gt; &gt; &gt; it...............or you have got some other suggestions......let your ideas
&gt; &gt; &gt; flow...........but then time bahut kaam hai..........so atleast confirm your
&gt; &gt; &gt; presence...........by atleast a single line reply..:)

&gt; &gt; &gt; -Jyoti
