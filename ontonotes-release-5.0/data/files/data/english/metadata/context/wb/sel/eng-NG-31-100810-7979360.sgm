Sammy Goldenberger, a little boy, was walking down a dirt road after shul
one Saturday afternoon when he came to a crossroads where he met a little
girl,
Sarah Edelman coming from the other direction.

&quot;Hello,&quot; said Sam.

&quot;Hi,&quot; replied Sarah.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; asked Sam.

&quot;I've been to Temple this morning and I'm on my way home,&quot; answered Sarah.
&quot;Me too,&quot; replied Sam. &quot;I'm also on my way home from shul.&quot;

&quot;Which shul do you go to?&quot; asked Sam.

&quot;I go to Beth Shalom, a conservative Temple back down the road,&quot; replied the
Sarah. &quot;What about you?&quot;

&quot;I go to Anshe Shalom, an Orthodox shul back at the top of the hill,&quot;
replied Sam.

They discovered that they are both going the same way so they decided that
they'd walk together.

They came to a low spot in the road where spring rains had partially flooded
the road so there was no way that they could get across to the other side
without getting wet.

&quot;If I get my new Sabbath dress wet my Mom's going to skin me alive,&quot; said
the little girl.

&quot;My Mom'll tan my hide too if I get my new Shul suit wet,&quot; replied the
little boy.

&quot;I tell you what I think I'll do,&quot; said the little girl. &quot;I'm going pull off
all my clothes and hold them over my head and wade across.&quot;

&quot;That's a good idea,&quot; replied the little boy. &quot;I'm going to do the same
thing with my suit.&quot;

So they both undressed and waded across to the other side without getting
their clothes wet.

They were standing there in the sun waiting to drip dry before putting their
clothes back on when the little boy finally remarked.... &quot;You know, I never
did
realize before just how much difference there really is between Orthodox and
Conservative.&quot;

As the little girl said when she saw her brother naked in the bath for
the first time, &quot;Boy, isn't he lucky it didn't grow on his face&quot;

Many years ago I stayed with family in Winnipeg.

On Shabbat morning, they asked me if I would like to go to the
Orthodox synagogue or the Conservative.   I asked them what the
difference was.

They replied that the main difference was that at the Conservative
synagogue they would offer me a lift home, but at the Orthodox
synagogue, I would have to ask!

Even if you did ask at the Orthodox shul, you couldn't get a lift
because they don't drive.  You'd be better off not asking!

When I was a correspondent for a Jewish newspaper, I normally observed
Shabbat at home. But my editor told me it was important to cover a speech on
a Friday night at an Orthodox shul and nobody was available to report on
this emergency meeting. I agreed to take the assignment only because the
message was so important to the Jewish community.

I managed to get a seat close to the speaker and turned on my miniature tape
recorder when he began to speak. I thought nobody saw me, because the device
is no larger than a ball point pen and I carried it in my breast pocket,
under my jacket.

After the speech, at the Oneg Shabbat, an elderly man approached me. Wearing
a black hat with a wide brim and a beard, he spoke with a European accent.
&quot;You're from the paper, aren't you?&quot; he asked. I told him I was. &quot;You taped
the speech, didn't you?&quot; he asked. I admitted I had. &quot;You drove here, didn't
you?&quot; he asked. Again I didn't lie. &quot;Are you parked nearby?&quot; he asked and I
told him my car was on the next block. &quot;Then maybe you wouldn't mind taking
me home?&quot; he asked. I laughed and we left together.

I am sure G-d forgave him, and I hope G-d forgave me, because he really
couldn't walk. I asked him what he would have done if I hadn't been there
and he said there was always someone who drove.

I bet they do in Winnipeg. That is one spreadout city. And as there are
probably not a lot of orthodox Jews in Winnipeg I suspect that most
don't live within any reasonable walking distance of the schul.

Err... from where do you get that idea?

David is absolutely right.

Some years ago I remember reading the results of a study about observance
carried out among British Jews.  The upshot was that the typical profile of
a member of an orthodox synagogue and a reform one (Reform Synagogues of
Great Britain, as the organization used to be called) was about the same.

UK Reform is much more observant than US reform, BTW.

UK Reform is US Conservative.

There has been a drift in the US. &quot;Orthodox&quot; has been drifting toward the
right, shading, from right to left of  Hassidim, black hats and Young
Israel. &quot;Conservative&quot; has been moving like tectonic plates, with
&quot;Traditional Conservative&quot; differing from Modern Orthodox only in the
seating in the sanctuary. Egalitarian Conservative is now distance from
Traditional.

Wedged in between Reform and Egalitarian Conservative is Reconstructionist.
Then further to the left is Reform, which ranges from Kashruth and Shabbat
observance to Liberal Reform. In the UK, I attended a Liberal service that
resembled left-wing US Conservative.

&quot;It's enough to cross a rabbi's eyes.&quot;

Leon

PS. In response to an e-mail inquiry, when I was a newspaperman (no, I
didn't sell old newspapers, I wrote them), the style we used required that
we capitalize the R in rabbi or C in congregation when using it as a name,
as in &quot;When the rabbi spoke, he told the congregation that Rabbi Cohen would
be leading Congregation Etz Chaim next week.&quot;

Tectonic plates is a good analogy.
When plates meet or separate, earthquakes and volcanoes occur.
On the West Coast of the US there are Orthodox congregations that refer to
themselves as &quot;traditional, &quot;  meaning they drive themselves to services
(ah, suburbia!).
I have always wondered about bicycling to shul, since less energy is
consumed on a bicycle than by walking the same distance, but that's physics
and not Talmud!

I am not sure, but maybe we could find a rebbe who would rule that riding a
bicycle inside of an eruv is permitted, provided that the seat used by a man
has never been used by a woman.

More ridiculous rulings about what is permitted inside an eruv have been
made.

My mom, who lived at one time in a city in upstate New York, mentions
that the city's large orthodox synagogue's parking lot was open on
Saturdays, and the large Conservative synagogue's was closed.  Of
course, people drove to both synagogues -- not-as-religious-as-perhaps-
they-should-have-been orthodox and not-as-religious-as-perhaps-they-
should-have-been Conservative people, respectively -- and the rabbis
of both synagogues were against driving on Saturdays.  But the
orthodox place accommodated drivers, is all, while the Conservative
did not.  The reason, if I recall correctly, that my mom gave was that
the orthodox place sought driving congregants who would otherwise go
elsewhere or nowhere.
