ISRAEL LIVES SEPT 16, 2007  Subtleties of Anti-Semitism

$100,000 Al-Qa'ida Bounty on Swedish Cartoonist's Head Al Qa'ida is offering
$100,000 to the person responsible if Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks is
&quot;slaughtered like a lamb.&quot; The offer reportedly came from Abu Omar al-Baghdadi,
who is Al-Qa'ida's second-in-command in Iraq and was made on the organization's
Internet site. The offensive cartoon that precipitated the offer showed the
Prophet Mohammad's head on the body of a dog. It was published on August 18. A
$50,000 bounty is being offered for killing the editor of the newspaper, which
published the cartoon. Sweden, considers holocaust denial as a opinion, while in
all other EU countries it is a criminal offence. Let us see how the Swedes will
deal with Islamic intimidation. ALL PAPERS WORLD WIDE SHOULD REPRINT THE
CARTOON, not merely report the story – One month later, paging thru hundreds of
Google articles, I could not find a single reproduction of the ‘offensive’
cartoon.  THE ONLY WAY TO END MUSLIM TYRANNY IS TO EXPOSE IT NEWSPAPERS MUST
PUBLISH THE CARTOON, PUBLISH MUSLIM BEHEADINGS, PUBLISH MUSLIM ATTACKS ON WOMEN,
PUBLISH MUSLIM VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, ON THEIR FIRST PAGES.   Readers –
please, send a copy of the cartoon to IsraelLives to begin the process of its
publication worldwide.

The subtleties of anti-Semitism are coloring the opinion of the next generation
of college graduates.  Foremost, Holocaust denial is becoming an acceptable
academic position.  Joseph Massad, a Columbia University professor of modern
Arab politics and intellectual history, writes that &quot;all those in the Arab world
who deny the Holocaust are, in my opinion, Zionists.&quot;  Even staunch Jews abet
the dilution of the word, thereby diluting the reality of the worst crime
against the Jews to ever have been perpetrated (among the many perpetrated
throughout history) when they apply, as Rabbi Zimmerman did at the Jewish Center
of the Hamptons in his Rosh Hashana sermon, HOLOCAUST to Darfur.  Yes, genocide
is being committed in Africa by Muslims, not only in Darfur – but the very word
Holocaust must be reserved for the systematic ‘final solution’ applied by Hitler
against the Jews of Europe.

Asaf Romirowski writing in the Jewish Exponent, is the manager of Israel &amp;
Middle East affairs for the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia and an
associate fellow at Campus Watch.  The great freedom of American’s Jews growing
up in post WWII academia is over.  The system of tenure in American Universities
insures that unless a students bill of rights is passed quickly, being Jewish
will attract derision and worse.

Follow the money.  Anti-Semitic rhetoric seeps into lower schools, both public
and private and has subverted 80% of the Madrassas in the United States. Jews
build buildings, Saudis fund education.  Rabbi Zimmerman knew he was riling a
sizable portion of his congregation – Fully 15% of the graduating Rabbi’s at JTS
are Peace Now/Seeds of Peace advocates.  The best concept I heard over this Rosh
Hashana Holiday was from Dennis Miller who created a visual picture in words.
Picture the 500,000 million Arabs surrounding Israel as a football field and
Israel as a match box within it.  Olmert is in the process of signing away ½
that match box, if he hasn’t already signed a paper of intent with Abbas
intended to support President Bush’s coming November ‘peace initiative’.  Irony
of irony, the Arab world seems to be withdrawing support from Abbas at this very
moment, nation after nation refusing to attend – because they do not believe
anything substantive for the Arab cause will be achieved.

1&lt; A New Anti-Semitism Takes Root on Campus

2&lt; Where did your Rabbi stand this Holiday- fear for the safety of Israel or
community support?  Fear is a rational response to the daily danger Israel
faces, to deny the danger is blithe idiocy.  Fact: Israel is at war.  Fact: Jews
including many in Israel are in denial.

3&gt;Mr. Brzezinski, a former national security adviser to President Carter, who
pressed the administration’s anti-Israel views, recently appointed by Obama as
his foreign policy adviser, has endorsed and vigorously defends the
Mearsheimer-Walt book.

1&lt;A NEW ANTI-SEMITISM TAKES ROOT ON CAMPUS
Asaf Romirowski
The Jewish Exponent
September 13, 2007

Asaf Romirowsky is the manager of Israel &amp; Middle East affairs for the Jewish
Federation of Greater Philadelphia and an associate fellow at Campus Watch.

&lt; http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/4116 &gt;

Today, pro-Israel students confront a demoralizing challenge on campus defending
Israel's right to exist as a democratic Jewish state, as well as expressing
views that would be labeled as &quot;conservative.&quot;

Some examples:

· Natana DeLong-Bas, a lecturer in theology at Boston College, as well as in the
Department of Near East and Judaic Studies at Brandeis University, says that she
does &quot;not find any evidence that makes me agree that Osama bin Laden was behind
the attack on the twin towers. All we have heard from him was simply praise and
commendation of those who had carried out the operation.&quot;

· Joseph Massad, a Columbia University professor of modern Arab politics and
intellectual history, writes that &quot;all those in the Arab world who deny the
Holocaust are, in my opinion, Zionists.&quot;

· Hatem Bazian, a senior lecturer in Islamic studies at University of
California, Berkeley, states that &quot;it's about time that we have an intifada in
this country that changes fundamentally the political dynamics in here.&quot;

On the Horizon
You might think these statements were made somewhere in the Arab world or
perhaps in 1930s' Europe. Yet they are found today in U.S. classrooms.
Tellingly, these scholars represent what is happening in the halls of academia
and illustrate the type of scholarship used to mold future generations.

Moreover, with the release of The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy by John
Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, students face another challenge as it relates to
the American-Israeli alliance. The authors contend that that there are no
genuine or compelling motives for America's support for Israel, which they refer
to as a &quot;strategic burden.&quot;

In addition, they argue that U.S. foreign policy has been hijacked by the
pro-Israel camps and works against the interests of America itself. They even
went as far as claiming that one of the results of AIPAC's work was to start the
war in Iraq.

Their narrative recounts every colorful report of Israeli &quot;cruelty&quot; toward
Palestinians as an indisputable fact. But conveniently, they leave out the rise
of Palestinian terrorism before 1967, as well as the 1972 Munich Olympics, Black
September and countless cases of suicide bombings against Jews and Israelis.

In an attempt to defuse this, the Jewish Policy Center has organized a panel of
experts -- including Daniel Pipes, Cliff May and David Horowitz, and moderated
by radio commentator Michael Medved -- to address &quot;The Fight Against Radical
Islam and the New Anti-Semitism on Campus.&quot; The event will take place at 7
p.m.Wednesday, Sept. 19, at Temple Beth Hillel/Beth El in Wynnewood.

'A Full-Blown Crisis'
When asked about the reason and the importance for holding such an event, Dick
Fox, chairman of the Jewish Policy Center, stated that the center &quot;has been
addressing the problem of radical Islam and anti-Semitism on campus for several
years. Organizationally, this issue has been a top priority for us. Now, it has
become a full-blown crisis.&quot;

The brouhaha over the &quot;Israel lobby&quot; as a Jewish conspiracy controlling America
has been challenged; unfortunately, that has produced even more virulent
rhetoric against Israel.

Academia has unconsciously exposed Jews and Israelis as the canaries in the coal
mine. If universities are indicators of social trends, then anti-Semitism is
becoming more acceptable in the guise of anti-Zionism. The thesis of
Israel-bashers is basically that only Jews are unworthy of having a sovereign
state.

These attitudes are pervasive on university campuses and are protected by what's
called &quot;academic freedom.&quot; But if we are to become better advocates for Israel,
then we deserve to hear a balanced representation of Israel and the Middle East
in our educational institutions.

We can start by seeking out those voices that until Sept. 11, 2001, had been
predominantely marginalized by the academy.

(The following list is a repeat from Israel Lives Sept 12, 2007 – Every
Professor taints 10’s of thousands of colleagues and students during his/her
tenured career.  They are truly cancers in our midst.   If these 101 are
‘Caesars’, think how many ‘little Caesars’ are poisoning student’s minds – Think
that a percentage of those students are and will become our countries Mayors,
Governors, Congressmen, Senators and perhaps President.  Before this rhetoric
was as rampant as it is today, think about former President Carter; think about
Presidential hopeful Obama; think about the extremely liberal Hillary Clinton –
All of these ‘leaders’ were influenced by their teachers.

2&lt;NATIONAL RABBINIC LEADERSHIP SURVEY OFFERS OUTLOOK FOR JEWISH NEW YEAR

www.starsynagogue.org/images/documents/survey_5768_final.pdf

-- Declining Anxiety Over Israel, Growing Concern Over Synagogue Engagement

and a Glimpse into Attitudes about Presidential Candidates --

Minneapolis September 10, 2007-STAR (Synagogues: Transformation and Renewal), a
national foundation dedicated to synagogue innovation and leadership
development, today announced the results of its second annual National Rabbinic
Leadership Survey: Vision 5768. With Rosh Hashanah (September 13-14) and Yom
Kippur (September 22) marking the beginning of the

Jewish New Year, the cross-denominational survey of almost 200 rabbis reveals
High Holiday goals, offers a pulse on Jewish community concerns and uncovers
initial thoughts regarding support for Presidential candidates.

High Holiday Message.Engagement, Involvement and Inclusiveness

Almost half of the Rabbis surveyed remain optimistic about the future of
American Jewry (47%); however, they are less positive about synagogue growth.
Over the next three years, under onethird (28%) expect an increase in synagogue
membership in the U.S. in general as compared to 34% last year.

Reflecting this shift, the survey reveals a change in focus with respect to the
issues rabbis plan to address in their High Holiday sermons. Participation in
Jewish life beyond the High Holiday services ranked first at 45% followed by
forgiveness (41%), and the internal life/health of the

synagogue (37%), compared to last year where support for Israel (72%), creating
a better future (42%) and forgiveness (37%) were the top three subjects.

Mirroring these topics are the top three sermon goals: to inspire congregants
with a compelling vision of Jewish life (66%), bringing the congregational
community closer together (11%), and increasing the level of moral/ethical
behavior (9%).

Like last year, about half the rabbis expect attendance at synagogue events and
services throughout the year (46%) and participation in High Holiday services
(56%) to remain the same over the next three years. This may be one factor
driving the push towards more inclusiveness with the vast majority (92%)
pointing to a need within their community to reach out to segments

that have historically been less involved, such as gays and lesbians, interfaith
couples, single parents, and singles. In fact, 71% of rabbis have seen a rise in
gay/lesbian inclusion efforts in the last three years and the same numbers
expect participation from this group to rise in the years

ahead.

&quot;While synagogue growth is always on the minds of rabbis, this year's survey
reveals a heightened concern,&quot; says Rabbi Hayim Herring, Executive Director of
STAR. &quot;Shifting denominational affiliations and larger numbers of interfaith
families are challenging synagogue growth and rabbis keenly recognize their role
is not just about increasing ongoing membership

participation, but reaching out beyond current congregants by attracting a more
diverse community.&quot;

Strong Support for Israel but Less Immediate Urgency

While Israel remains a key issue, concerns in this area have diminished as the
region is somewhat quieter this year (last year's survey took place shortly
after the war in Lebanon) and rabbis are broadening their communal scope. In
fact, 58% of rabbis said they balance their community focus between Jewish
causes and broader concerns up from 50% last year.

Additionally, when asked the most pressing issue facing the U.S. Jewish
community, only 7% selected Israel-related issues including &quot;advocacy and
education with regard to Israel&quot; and the upcoming &quot;Presidential elections and
U.S. support for Israel&quot; (3%). Last year almost one-third (32%) selected
Israelrelated issues including advocacy and education for Israel (17%) and

the impact of midterm elections on U.S. support for Israel (15%). The top three
issues this year are making Judaism more relevant (35%), followed by involving
more people in Jewish organizations or activities (14%), and involving more
people in synagogue life (12%).

While the overwhelming majority of rabbis (88%) say they promote giving to
organizations or groups focused on Israel-related causes and 81% report their
synagogue raised money for Israeli charities in the past year these numbers are
lower, from 97% and 94% respectively, than last year. While promoting giving to
Israeli organizations dropped, &quot;donations to global emergency causes such as
relief for Darfur through general civic organizations&quot; has remained constant at
89% and edged out Israeli causes to be the number one focus for charitable
giving.

Israel Still Pivotal in Political and Educational Matters

Almost all rabbis (97%) say they plan to encourage their community to vote in
the upcoming Presidential elections and over two-thirds (67%) have also
encouraged participation in the political process in the U.S. in general.

Israel remains a key political issue and solidarity actions continue to be
broadly encouraged with about half of the rabbis (52%) reporting that in the
past year their congregations have written letters to the editor and contacted
governmental representatives to express support for Israel; 70% of the rabbis
also reported that their congregations attended pro-Israeli rallies.

Even more significant, eight in 10 rabbis (82%--unchanged from last year) say
they are more inclined to back political candidates who are pro-Israel over
those who are not viewed as pro- Israel. When asked which party is more
supportive of Israel, almost half, 49%, say there is no difference in parties,
21% point to the Republican Party as more supportive, down from 35%

last year whereas 16% cite the Democratic Party as more supportive of Israel, a
slight increase from 14% last year.

While rabbis do not endorse specific candidates, when asked which current
Presidential candidate will be most supportive of Israel, 41% of rabbis said
they are unsure, but almost a quarter ranked Senator Hillary Clinton as most
supportive (22%) followed by former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (16%)
and Senator John McCain (3%). Similarly Senator Hillary Clinton was ranked as
most supportive of Jewish causes in America in general (24%)

followed again by former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (10%), with
Senator Barack Obama ranking third (3%).

&quot;The findings indicate that Israel is still in the hearts and minds of rabbis,
but they are looking at broader issues as well,&quot; explains Rabbi Herring. &quot;The
battle to keep Judaism relevant may be more of a concern right now, but as the
Presidential election gets under way and global issues heat up, it is clear the
U.S. Jewish community will be ready to act on behalf of Israel and the synagogue
is perhaps the key venue for Israel activity, education and advocacy.&quot;

Global Repercussions

While three-quarters of respondents believe the U.S. is adequately supporting
Israel, 62% consider the American news media as negatively biased in its
portrayal of Israel (down from 67% last year). Despite this perception, the
majority of rabbis (67%--the same as last year), do not see

U.S. support for Israel as having negative repercussions for Jews in America,
but 41% believe this backing can create fallout for Jews overseas.

However, more than half (57%) agree the war in Iraq has harmful consequences for
Jews living outside the U.S., while only 34% say the war impacts Jews negatively
in the U.S. Only 26% said there would be a generally negative impact on Israel
if the U.S. leaves Iraq and most (64%) give very little or no encouragement to
their congregants to become involved in the war in Iraq (down from 76% last
year). Interestingly, 45% indicate there would be a generally negative impact
for Israel (45%) if the United States were to take action against Iran and 21%
thought this would have negative repercussion on attitudes towards Jews in the
U.S.

Additionally, 45% of respondents believe recent European actions such as the
boycott of Israeli professors by British academics reflect both growing European
anti-Semitic and anti-Israel sentiments, and an additional 17% think this
attitude is solely anti-Israel.

&quot;There continues to be confidence in the strength and security of the Jewish
community in the U.S.,&quot; says Rabbi Herring. &quot;However, there is awareness that
the Jewish community worldwide is more vulnerable and that political action here
can affect the attitude towards Jews across the globe.&quot;

3&gt;Dershowitz- Obama Should Repudiate Brzezinski

WASHINGTON —  &lt; http://www.nysun.com/related_results.php?term=Barack+Obama &gt;
Senator Obama may have distanced himself from a book criticizing the
&lt; http://www.nysun.com/related_results.php?term=Israel &gt; Israel lobby, but the
prominent  &lt; http://www.nysun.com/related_results.php?term=Harvard+University &gt;
Harvard law professor — and Senator Clinton ally — says the
&lt; http://www.nysun.com/related_results.php?term=Illinois &gt; Illinois lawmaker needs
to go a step further and repudiate his newest foreign policy adviser,
&lt; http://www.nysun.com/related_results.php?term=Zbigniew+Brzezinski &gt; Zbigniew
Brzezinski.

The Harvard professor,
&lt; http://www.nysun.com/related_results.php?term=Alan+Dershowitz &gt; Alan Dershowitz,
has emerged as a chief critic of &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy,&quot; a
new book in which authors
&lt; http://www.nysun.com/related_results.php?term=John+Mearsheimer &gt; John
Mearsheimer and  &lt; http://www.nysun.com/related_results.php?term=Stephen+Walt &gt;
Stephen Walt argue that a powerful coalition of individuals and organizations
has pushed  &lt; http://www.nysun.com/related_results.php?term=United+States &gt;
America into supporting Israel in ways that undermine its national interests

The book has drawn widespread scorn from the pro- Israel community, and it
appears to have divided Mr. Obama and Mr. Brzezinski, a former national security
adviser to President Carter who recently joined the Illinois senator's
presidential campaign. Mr. Brzezinski will be with Mr. Obama as the candidate
delivers a major policy address on Iraq today in Iowa.

Amid a firestorm over an initial working paper Messrs . Mearsheimer and Walt
published last year on the Israel lobby, Mr. Brzezinski rose to their defense,
even as he demurred on the question of whether he agreed with their central
arguments. The authors, he wrote in the journal Foreign Policy, &quot;have rendered a
public service by initiating a much-needed public debate on the role of the ‘
Israel lobby' in the shaping of U.S. foreign policy.&quot;

Mr. Obama's campaign took the opposite route earlier this week when notified
that an ad for its Web site appeared on the Amazon.com page of the
Mearsheimer-Walt book. The campaign immediately removed the ad, saying its
placement was unintentional, and issued a statement saying Mr. Obama believed
the arguments in the book were &quot;just wrong.&quot; &quot;I'm glad he's done that, but now
he has to dissociate himself from Brzezinski,&quot; Mr. Dershowitz said in an
interview yesterday. He said the Mearsheimer-Walt book was &quot;a bigoted attack on
the American Jewish community&quot; and that Mr. Brzezinski's comments in Foreign
Policy last year amounted to an endorsement.

Through an assistant, Mr. Brzezinski declined repeated requests to be
interviewed yesterday about his views on the book and Mr. Obama. He endorsed the
first-term senator last month, praising his long-running opposition to the Iraq
war and offering a high-profile boost to a candidate who has struggled at times
to combat the perception that he is inexperienced in foreign policy.

Mr. Dershowitz, who has contributed $1,000 to Mrs. Clinton's campaign and is
supporting her candidacy, said his criticism of Mr. Brzezinski extended beyond
the Mearsheimer-Walt book to what he said was Mr. Brzezinski's broader &quot;anti-
Israel&quot; rhetoric in recent years. The former Carter aide was highly critical of
Israel during its war last year with Hezbollah in Lebanon, at one point saying
its actions amounted to &quot;the killing of hostages.&quot;

Mr. Dershowitz said that while Mr. Obama has been a strong supporter of Israel,
he &quot;made a terrible mistake&quot; by bringing on Mr. Brzezinski, which he attributed
to &quot;naïveté.&quot;

In response, the Obama campaign released a statement from one of its top
supporters in the Jewish community, Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida. &quot; Barack
Obama has been a consistent supporter of Israel and this is an unfortunate case
of a fabricated controversy for political reasons,&quot; he said. &quot;I speak with him
often on Israel policy, and I can tell you firsthand that Barack Obama is
opposed to the arguments presented in this book.&quot;
