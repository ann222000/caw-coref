Do I understand your question, man,

Is it hopeless and forlorn? - Bob Dylan

Yesterday morning I was watching a streaming English-language news
broadcast from Russia. (And I expect that's enough cause right there for
the telecommunication giants to seek the end of the Internet as we know
it.) The lead story was the press conference of Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and the main points hit by the Russia Today
correspondent were Ahmadinejad's renouncing nuclear weapons as contrary
to Islam and his reiteration of Iran's 30-year commitment to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty, though Iran reserved the right to revisit its
commitment if adherence to the treaty imperiled its sovereignty.

It was an unexpectedly optimistic piece. Ahmadinejad was allowed to
speak at length and appeared relaxed and informed while fielding
questions. If the excerpts were representative and the translation
accurate, he appeared to be credibly attempting to defuse the crisis.

Naturally we need to compensate for spin whatever the source, and
Russian news tailored for a foreign audience has a spin no less than
Wolf Blitzer's Panic Room. Knowing that, I was still taken aback by the
absolute unfamiliarity of the same press conference when soon after I
started reading accounts of it in the Western media. The accent was
almost entirely upon provocation, not concilation: the UN "lacks guts"
to impose sanctions; "Defiant Iran in threat to quit nuclear treaty";
and "Iranian President insists 'Israel can not continue to live.'"

There's a Central Casting-like quality to Ahmadinejad's villainy. If
he didn't exist the Pentagon would have had to create him to justify
moving the goalpost to Tehren. And perhaps they did. (The election
fraud, rule by crisis and religious fascism are certainly familiar
enough. A reformist Iranian government was the war party's nightmare.)
But did he really say that ? Did he insist that Israel must die? The
headline is drawn from this quote, provided without context: "We say
that this fake regime cannot logically continue to live." To arrive at
the headline, the government has to be conflated with the nation.
Likewise we could say about the Bush administration, and with
considerable accuracy, that "this fake regime cannot logically continue
to survive." (Without knowing Farsi I'll presume that the original could
be translated as either "to live" or "to survive.") And is that the same
as saying America must die ?

Ahmadinejad says the darnedest things, but perhaps, when translated,
his rhetoric is subject to overinflation by parties interested in
conflict.

But perhaps it doesn't matter. Does it matter that we've barely
learned how to pronounce his name before he's become This Year's Hitler?
It doesn't matter what anyone says at this suddenly late stage, past the
fail safe point of arrested anticipation. Iran and the United States do
not see the need to talk to each other, and the go-between media appears
only to egg them on like a pack of jumpy kids itching for the stimulus
of a good after-school fight. (How's June sound?)

All things being equal, a chorus of just one wise word, something
like "Enough," should be sufficient now to deter the Bush regime which,
judging by the politics alone, ought to be the most vulnerable since
Nixon's circa 1974. But nothing's equal anymore, and American politics
is putting on an ever-more piss-poor pantomime of representative
government. The old vocabularies have expired. Throw their lexicons on
the Lexus, and burn the Lexus. We need to learn a new language before we
can speak this truth to that power.

Contrast the irani prime ministers reported statements with the us
president's suggestion that he is prepared to rain holy nuclear fire
down on iran.

Even if the prime ministers statements are as rash as they are
presented, they are as nothing to that threatened by the president.

From reading the analysis on ICH it is clear the Iranian President's
words are being deliberately distorted.

It is also clear that this deliberate and coordinated distortion is
another glaring example of how the mainstream media in the west is
simply just an arm of the government propaganda machine. I do not even
bother to think of them as anything else now.

That said it is hard to figure out why the Iranian president is
handing the axis of evil (the Israel, US & UK one) so much potential
ammunition.

Or is he?

Maybe he is just going about doing and saying what he always did. The
difference now is that the media spotlight of spin has been purposefully
turned on him and away from Iraq.

But for some reason I get the feeling he is a willing baddie in this
theatre. Not sure why but I have a hunch some deal has been cut over
Iraq. Maybe Iran will get a piece of Iraq in some future carve up once
the civil war has been finally ignited. (Although I am starting to
wonder if the Iraqis will successfully avoid this trap.)

The Iranians are smart people and they know that the manufactured
conflict with Iran is a massive help to the US/UK/Israel so why play
along?

Would it not have been much smarter to let the focus remain on Iraq.
What is in it for them in pursuing this strategy?

How about the confusion of cultures separated by cleanly delineated
ethnic, social and geographical lines through the form of digital
democratic, corporatistically databased "revolution"?

http://jarrarsupariver.blogspot.com/2006/04/day-in-life_18.html

This he has to say about the erring on the side of humanity at all
costs Riverbend:

"Riverbend, the Baleful Baathist of Baghdad, is sitting at home on
the couch, her Doc Martens up on the coffee table, wondering what to
write for her ONE BLOG ENTRY for the month of April. Later she'll walk
down to the vegetable seller and call him a frikking murdering Shiite
bastard. In the old days under UNCLE SADDAM, she tells him, his
fingernails would have been pulled out by her friends."

See. I've never gotten that "Baathist streak" outta Riverbend. Yet
somebody somewhere else has. Why? Why can't she just be another victim
of empire and leave it at that? Are the numbers of victims not rife?

My fear, which isn't even a fear anymore, but rather a projection, is
that there is a deep well of anatagonistic energy in the common
American. This sweet fascist nectar is just now being tapped for the
fresh stuff. These won't be your grandfather's anti-semites.

Jeff said;

"We need to learn a new language before we can speak this truth to
that power."

Yes, a new language is needed.

As a long time student of current events and parapolitics, I find it
interesting that rabble-rousers never do more than irritate our cultural
beast. Our leverage to effect events will remain weak as long as we
submit to the (formalized) mental conditioning systems that have defined
human society since the Consul of Nicea. When at the Consul of Nicea,
Jesus was declared to be God, the church became a means to enforce
authority and inhibit 'enthusiasm', and therefore an agent of Ahriman.

Descartes, with his clever speculations, further codified this
dualistic pretence, separating the spiritual and the physical, - thereby
obscuring again the value of individual creative expressions of
consciousness.

G-d is far off, "trust us say the authority figures, to explain to
you how reality is". As we learn to better examine our cultural
conditioning systems we may notice proposals for improvement.

Our collective criteria for understanding do more to shape psychical
expressions than any news tidbit or informed opinion. The 'harsh
critics' out there are to be reminded that a consequent cannot prove the
antecedent and therefore one expression of initial principles cannot be
said to be inherently more valid than another. It is in this spirit that
the following 'rules' for psychical conditioning are presented, a new
set of Criteria for Understanding.

1. The spiritual and material is fundamentally the same.

2. Consciousness precedes Being; Being is congealed Consciousness.

3. Taking or presenting relative truth as being Absolute truth
produces pathology.

4. Any particle is the agglutination of sub-particles that exhibit
the proper combination of frequency, velocity, vector, and a cyclical
balance between electro-magnetic attraction and static repulsion
characteristics.

5. The manifest expression reflects the balance between order and
liberty within consciousness.

I thought I'd try and get a comment in early before all our "friends"
from Fort Meade start diluting your post....

This is apparantly the same M.O. being used against fired CIA officer
Mary O. McCarthy. Although McCarthy has denied leaking classified
information, most new organizations have started their "spin" cycle.

What scares me with their Ahmadinejad typecast, however, is who's
next after we're done with this guy?!

At the same time, I tend to agree with "harry's" earlier comment
(5:40 A.M.) that Ahmadinejad seems like a willing partner in this made

Absolutely nothing in mainstream can relay the truth. It's just not

key to distortion. How many rembember that this was a BBC news company
less than a decade ago? Remember the CBC coverage live on the scene
which showed the victims on the subway all with headwounds and as
testifyed from their hospital beds that the "glass blew into the cars".

Then we have this link...WTF..

It certainly does seem that Ahmedinejad is filling his role a bit too
perfectly, but I suppose that's exactly the point of this post. Who's
version of the 'Truth' do we accept here. I suspect none-of-the-above is
the correct answer.

I've been thinking, regarding this whole mess of distraction and
disinformation, that the best way to approach this is not to say
'Ahmedinejad said/did' or 'Bush said/did'. We should be thinking in
terms of 'Fox News has presented Ahmedinejad thusly...' or 'CNN has
portrayed Bush as...'. I don't know if there's ever been such a thing as
truly objective journalism (I'm tempted to say that it is inherently
impossible), but it certainly doesn't exist anywhere today that I've
seen. It's not possible to seperate the message and the messenger when
it comes to this stuff.

John Pilger's recent piece The First Casualty of War has this quote:

The oldest cliché is that truth is the first casualty of war. I
disagree. Journalism is the first casualty. Not only that: it has become
a weapon of war, a virulent censorship that goes unrecognized in the
United States, Britain, and other democracies; censorship by omission,
whose power is such that, in war, it can mean the difference between
life and death for people in faraway countries, such as Iraq.

And, as far as the situation with Iran, I saw the following article
that gives an entirely different perspective -- that the idea of bombing
Iran is simply a red herring -- that the plan is to make huge profits
off of the oil in Iran through what's called Production-Sharing
Agreements (PSAs).

Sweet Deals: Behind the Iran 'crisis'

I must admit that I'm finding it extremely difficult to read between
the lines -- is Sy Hersh just plain wrong? Is he being used? I hope so.

Or, maybe it's all true -- we'll both bomb Iran AND enter into those
PSAs when there's a "stable government" there. Insanity.

Have you ever woundered that this is all planned to happen?

For the One World Government to be created, there must be a need for
it. There must be chaos, war, hunger, poverty, death. Only in a position
of vulnerability, of tiredness, of fear will human kind accept this One
World Government. Why is the United Nations playing the "good guy" and
the US playing the "bad guy"?This is the conditioning of the colective
counsciousness:

"(...)We possess detailed descriptions of the methods used by the
Communist police for dealing with political prisoners. From the moment
he is taken into custody, the victim is subjected systematically to many
kinds of physical and psychological stress. He is badly fed, he is made
extremely uncomfortable, he is not allowed to sleep for more than a few
hours each night. And all the time he is kept in a state of suspense,
uncertainty and acute apprehension. Day after day -- or rather night
after night, for these Pavlovian policemen understand the value of
fatigue as an intensifier of suggestibility -- he is questioned, often
for many hours at a stretch, by interrogators who do their best to
frighten, confuse and bewilder him. After a few weeks or months of such
treatment, his brain goes on strike and he confesses whatever it is that
his captors want him to confess. Then, if he is to be converted rather
than shot, he is offered the comfort of hope. If he will but accept the
true faith, he can yet be saved -- not, of course, in the next life
(for, officially, there is no next life), but in this.(...)"

the news has really turned propagandistic in the last few weeks with
iran. they make it sound like war will start tomorrow. i just don't
believe a thing they say, it makes no sense to me that the iranian
president would say such irresponsible things on a public international
scale unless he is a puppet or being entirely misrepresented. we tried
the puppet thing with the shah and we all know how that ended in 1979.

the media keep saying things about how iran wants to expand its
nuclear program without specifying if its the nuclear energy program or
a nuclear warhead program. the way they say it makes you think 'they're
makin nukes!?'

and then they go on and on everyday with these new explosively
inflammatory comments made by ahmadinejad, that as i said before are
incredibly irresponsible: it makes no sense.

then we have the bin laden tape and the thing in egypt.

then theres iraq in civil war.

and hamas in palestine.

"One way or another, we became conscious of language--not as a way of
communicating, but of constructing something. As if it were a pleasure
more than a duty. In the underground, unlike the world of bourgeois
intellectuals, the word is not what is most valued. It is relegated to a
secondary position. It was when we got to the indigenous communities
that language hit us, like a catapult. Then you realize that you lack
the words to express many things, and that obliges you to work on
language...

We went out into the world in the same way that we went out into
literature. I think this marked us. We didn't look out at the world
through a news-wire but through a novel, an essay or a poem. That made
us very different. That was the prism through which my parents wanted me
to view the world, as others might choose the prism of the media, or a
dark prism to stop you seeing what's happening."

Thank you Sounder for the definition of a "new language". Sounds very
much like William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Within his
writing is the philosophy of a balance between order and liberty, reason
and creativity. We must recognize the power of 'divide and conquer'.

We must also have no fear. Everyone who writes in this blog "I'm
afraid" or "I fear" are feeding the beast. We must see the enemy in
ourselves. Our power is in our 'knowing' not merely thinking.

My personal problem today is handling the constant rejection from
friends and family because I 'know' and they're too afraid to know or
even to look. Therefore they reject the messenger. I'm trying to span
that gulf and create a bridge.

I'm very thankful that I finally do 'know' because I'm more
comfortable knowing than not understanding. I understand why there's so
much suffering in the world. I know more now than at any time when I
used to watch TV and read the local paper. And thank you to all who
blog/dialogue and create this community of like-minded people. Too bad
we can't have one big BBQ/potluck party with all the regulars of this
blog. Thanks to Jeff for creating it.

I agree with "Sounder" and "Luposapien" to some extent while
disagreeing with "Harry," "Paul," "Ericswan," and "Kin."

As we've read here before, the most effective lies are half-truths.
Just as jokes tend to contain underlying elements of truth, I believe
most of what the journalists, editors, and media owners give us often
contains such a mix, but based on sufficient facts so that slander and
libel suits are rarely forthcoming. Sometimes, however, the reporters
are right, and it is the source of the news that has the power to
manipulate "truth" and perceived reality. Goering and Hitler, anyone?

This reminds me of another "w.," euGene Scott... "The picture's the
thing." People ought to start considering beliefs and knowledge on a
contingent basis, with the critical thinking abilities to accept a truth
or assertion that is better founded than the one they have. As it
stands, verisimilitude appears to be the standard of acceptance by John
Public--that and convenience.

Simply because our media sources contain a mix of truth and lies does
not logically mean that nothing they have reported about Ahmadinejad is
true or even that the context was misrepresented. Surely one world
leader with the financial means is as adept at manipulation of the
public via the media as another.

Here, the reader is perhaps best off adopting a stance such that we
accept the reports as contingently true until a superior report with
better facts comes through. When the risks are high, such as those that
we might have to deal with a fanatical fundamentalist regime with
nuclear capabilities demands both the greatest awareness as well as the
greatest scrutiny.

That means it cannot be simply written off and ignored. What if
Ahmadinejad is manipulating the Iranian people just as much as American
institutions are manipulating us? What if we all buy into it?

The inability to move outside a dualistic or dialectic truth
structure is a great weakness. Either he is a new "little Hitler" or he
isn't. We fail to consider the different ways he may or may not be like
demagogues of the past.

With rising oil prices and a planet in the balance, the situation is
unique, increasing uncertainty and anxiety, further pushing people
towards accepting simple truths that fail to caputre the nuances of
"reality."

That is as frightening to me as the anonymous ignoramuses who post
their irrelevant views in this forum. Nonetheless, some are warnings to
us of how easily many people will accept convenient, simple statements
of truth and support anybody who appears successful and "in the know"
enough to improve their perceived problems.

If we protest, we must demand more information in the process, not
decry the lies of the media and politicians with the simple-minded
attitude of "whatever you say, we believe the opposite." Read enough,
and you will be left with no truths to hold on to at all.

Former CIA Angola Task Force director turned whistleblower John
Stockwell tells of how a CIA-generated fake story about Cuban soldiers
raping Angolan women was played up for weeks in the American presstitute
papers. This would be in 1975 or 1976. The CIA newspaper fable climaxed
with the capture of the Cuban villains and the raped women forming the
firing squad that executed them. I remember reading this story at the
time and wondering what the US was doing in Angola so soon after fleeing
Vietnam. Stockwell wondered too and quit after the debacle.

I don't mind repeating myself:

Fascism is a male domination cult. War is killing people to steal
their stuff.

Military intelligence has honed the black art of bringing out the
worst in people

to harness the energy of predictable behaviors for control and
profit.

From Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' to Ronald Reagan-era School of the
Americas military dictatorship manuals,

the suppression and control of We the People by the military and its
moneyed henchmen is the primary goal of 'our government.'

This black art of fascism is a conspiracy carried out by the
Pentagon, CIA and other alphabet agencies, and corporate weasels
intended to

demoralize, divide, deceive, exploit, and destroy

the masses for the profits of the few.

Crimes against humanity that were once attributed to the Devil

are now the job description for the National inSecurity State

since 1947.

From today's SMC on the Iran info-op:

Dramatic structure lies at the heart of any good psy-op and refers to
the narrative components into which it, like any good fable, can be
broken down into.

In the initial phase termed exposition, the background information
that is needed to understand the story properly is beaten into the heads
of the targeted population per incessant repetition. Such information
includes basic information such as the protagonist, the antagonist, the
basic purported conflict including an overly articulated threat
scenario, and the setting.

The exposition ends with the inciting moment, which is the single
incident in the story's action without which there would be no story.
The inciting moment sets the remainder of the story in motion beginning
with the second act.

We now find ourselves at the junction between the exposition phase
ending in an inciting moment and the transition into the second act's
rising action. This junction revolves completely around culminating
Security Council antics - and at that, John Bolton is the right man with
the right stuff to ensure a smooth and unimpeded transition into the
action phase of this prewritten script.

There will be no resolution of any synthetic conflict at this point,
no matter what the Iranians do or don't do. Conflict is what we want and
what this psy-op is all about. The predetermined agenda to attack and
destabilize Iran is being laboriously pretexted - and we are the target
of this pretexting psy-op - not Iran. Psychological warfare has been
declared against you.

H.M. (Humanity) Wins, and Ronald Stark:

You are both right on in your analyses and conclusions. Read today's

summum bonum erzatz expression of faux internal opposition the plan
that's already been signed off on, to make it kosher for the masses to
accept US aggression when the shit comes down. I mean, c'mon, wink wink,
nod nod, ZB complaining about the immorality of bombing Iran? This is

longed for the precipitating crisis to spark the long war. Now we are
supposed to believe that he's railing against the next stage of what is
partly his baby? I think not.

23skidoo, who are you kidding to say that any rich man can buy equal
access to the world's mainstream media, which is the only thing the
masses watch or listen to? If what you say is so then why is it that all
the msm, alJazeera included, are only skewed one way, and all helping
the plan along? Guess again. Were you born yesterday, or the day before?

WTC

By Henry Makow Ph.D.

It is more effective to manage society by mind control than by
physical coercion. The events of 9-11 and the "war on terror" mostly are
exercises in mass brainwashing.

German psychiatrist Kurt Lewin, who became director of the
elite-sponsored Tavistock Institute in 1932, developed the thinking
behind 9-11. In the book "Mind Control World Control" (1997) Jim Keith
writes:

"Lewin is credited with much of the original Tavistock research into
mass brainwashing applying the results of repeated trauma and torture
[of individuals] in mind control to society at large."

"If terror can be induced on a widespread basis into a society, Lewin
has stated, then society reverts to a tabula rasa, a blank slate, a
situation where control can easily be instituted from an external
point."

"Put another way: By the creation of controlled chaos, the populace
can be brought to the point where it willingly submits to greater
control. Lewin maintained that society must be driven into a state
equivalent to an 'early childhood situation.' He termed this societal
chaos 'fluidity.'" (Page 44)

Elite planners designed Sept. 11 for its shock value. In the
aftermath, they were able to impose a security crackdown, a costly
military build-up and a war in Afghanistan and Iraq on a stunned
population.

Keith cites another Tavistock researcher Dr. William Sargent author
of "Battle for the Mind: A Physiology of Conversion and Brain-Washing"
(1957): "Various types of beliefs can be implanted after brain function
has been sufficiently disturbed by ...deliberately induced fear, anger
or excitement." (48)

This blueprint was laid out long before Sept. 11, 2001. The official
story of that tragedy doesn't bear scrutiny. There was no wreckage at
the Pentagon. All three buildings were demolished by explosives. Our
"leaders" are accomplices to the murder of over 3000 Americans and the
destruction of an American icon. The plan is to fold the US into a
"world government" controlled by London-based central bankers. Our
cultural, economic and political elite is complicit in the ongoing cover
up.

FUTURE SHOCK

Most political and cultural events are contrived by the elite for
their psychological effect. JFK could have been disposed of in more
humane ways. (He had many health problems.) Instead, for its shock
value, they shot him down , in Mort Sahls' words, "like a dog in the
street."

Jim Keith: "The Kennedy assassination was a British Intelligence,
i.e. Tavistock hit, and its purpose was to shock the American
consciousness into a near-comatose state for reprogramming, the standard
Tavistock modus operandi." (p.143)

The same can be said for the assassinations of Martin Luther King and
Robert Kennedy. It all climaxed with the beatings of demonstrators at
the 1968 Chicago Democratic convention. After that, my generation turned
inward as we were programmed to do. "Turn on, Tune in, Drop Out" said
CIA funded pied piper Timothy Leary.

["I mean who was I supposed to work for, the KGB?" Leary quipped.
(Keith p.99) Leary didn't realize that there wasn't a big difference.]

Many young people became "dead heads" after Jerry Garcia's Grateful
Dead. Keith writes:

"An FBI internal memo from 1968 mentions the employment of the
Grateful Dead as an avenue 'to channel youth dissent and rebellion into
more benign and non-threatening directions.' [They] performed a vital
service in distracting many young persons into drugs and mysticism,
rather than politics." (179)

Keith goes on to document CIA connections to the creation of mind
control cults used to create "controlled chaos." These include the
Symbionese Liberation Army, Jim Jones, Charles Manson, Scientology, the
Unification Church, Son of Sam and Heaven's Gate. The John Lennon
assassination also ties in. (183)

To bring the picture up to date, add the murder of Princess Diana,
Columbine, the blowing of the levees in New Orleans, the burning of
Black churches, and the bird flu scare. What we have is an ongoing
secret war by the central bankers against society, a drumbeat of
psychological torture designed to keep society off balance or zoned out.

THE BITTER TRUTH

The most significant thing about our life is that we are victims of
elite mind control. We have been trained to be apathetic, trivia-minded
and self absorbed. Apart from the political shocks, we are hardly aware
of the vicious attack on our natural heterosexuality by a psy-op known
as "feminism" masquerading as womens rights.

We get our values, identity, meaning and love from our family roles.
Women were brainwashed to abandon the female role and compete for the
male role. A woman who dedicated herself to husband, home and children
was stigmatized. This is part of the long-term elite program to
eliminate the institutions of marriage and family.

According to this web site, "Tavistock Institute has developed such
power in the USA, that no one achieves prominence in any field unless he
has been trained in behavioral science at Tavistock, or one of its
subsidiaries." Read how Tavistock directs hundreds of elite think tanks
and corporations in the United States. The degree of elite coordination
is breath taking.

For example, Century 21 has a new ad where a real estate agent is
greeting a middle class Chinese couple arriving to settle in America.
The voice-over says something like: "This is the shape of the future. We
are agents of change."

Obviously this ad will not appeal to Americans looking for a realtor.
Rather, it conditions them to embrace immigration. Central banker dupes
and lackeys have used the term "change agents" to describe themselves
for decades.

Mankind is in the grip of a satanic force and is sinking into a coma.
Our "leaders" work for an occult cabal of super rich perverts and
criminals who secretly plot the end of Western Civilization and world
tyranny. They see us as animals to be trained or culled.

The good news is that the animals "owe" them a lot of money for their
fiat currency. So if we can tune out their madness, we can relax. The
chaos is controlled. Wars are all orchestrated and they love money too
much to destroy us, at least not yet.

I can believe Brzezinski doesn't want another war. All these people
are out for profit, but they have different ideas about how to go about
it. A lot of the figures associated with Bush Sr. seem to be more
interested at this point in stability and deal-making than in chaos and
looting. Now that the Soviet Union is out of the way, they'd be
perfectly happy to have a clutch of small but prosperous nations in the
Middle East and Central Asia to exploit. Bush Jr.'s plans disrupt trade
and stir up anti-American feeling and the "realists" can't be happy
about that.

If all they wanted were some pliant countries to exploit they could

To clarify:

The Soviet Union was never "in the way" to begin with, having been
financed by Wall Street and the City of London. Read some Antony Sutton,
late of Stanford U., for starters. This is old news. War is far more
profitable when all sides of the conflict are stage-managed by the same
financier/provocateurs, as has been the case now for the past 250 years,
give or take.

If all these advocates of demonocracy wanted were some pliable client
nation-states to exploit, they could have had that decades ago and been
done with it and be on permanent vacation. But they are not about that.
They are about the total degradation of humankind in furtherance of
their sick, Luciferian agenda. Ordo Ab Chao isn't just a slogan. It's a
long term geo-political cum metaphysical strategy.

The last words of Colonel Kurtz characterized it well.

" The old vocabularies have expired...We need to learn a new language
before we can speak this truth to that power."

I agree totally. Things like the stolen election of 2000 (and maybe
2004) are nothing new, and the media coverup of that, 911, the basis for
the war on Iraq, etc. with Congressional complicity every step of the
way, is SOP and established tradition in the USA.

What is new is that a lot more people are getting a glimpse of just
how extensive and mind-boggling the fraud and genocide is.

But being mostly stuck on the stunning conspiracy details of this or
that outrage as we wake up, we've not even begun to digest the meaning
of all this and how to respond to it.

That is why we speak of our discoveries of truth in a vaccuum, as if
they weren't connected.

For example to refer to a stolen election in 2000 and other outrages
as if they were isolated instances, nothing that a little old-fashioned
citizen vigilance like an impeachment process or a few letters to your
Congressmen couldn't correct shows we still don't get it. The problem is
much more serious than that.

It appears the vast deception perpetrated on us extends to things so
fundamental like that we live in a free country and always have, that we
often miss the whole point.

In fact what all these things tell us is that we've always lived in
hybrid form of an authoritarian and oppressive dictatorship (assuming
age of at least 150 and under).

This means for instance that none of our life's "votes" ever did
count except to telegraph to the parasitic ruling class if their
propaganda was working and if not, how it should be adjusted, lull us
into a false sense of security that we were so free and well-off that we
even honor our tyrants, and actually made us take responsibility for the
failed public policies or crimes of tyrants because through ignorance we
sincerely voted for them (we didn't know it but real solutions never
make it to the ballot).

And here we are figuring out the whole Iraq war was based on a total
fraud, grumbling about it some, but totally ignoring the same fraud is
being used by the same tyrants to get us into another baseless war, now
with Iran. Unbelievable.

It's a big plate to digest but the quicker we do the better.

Disclosure;

My etiological pretences derive from some mental experiments done
while a teenager. In short, I took note that while I felt smarter than
most folk in my small town, I felt blessed to realize most 'knowledge'
was hearsay, and ignorance (my own) was pervasive.

The preacher for our fundamentalist church talked about the blind
leading the blind, and I thought, 'Well who is going to admit that they
are blind? Not the preacher, certainly. I saw forms designed to induce
conformity, yet if taken differently these forms could reveal substance
of a nature more useful than the conventional interpretation.

I became a junkie for finding what is behind door number three.

It has been gratifying to find validation in William Blake and
Abraham Heschel, although similar ideas floated in my mind long before
contact with them.

hey jeff i think you need to work on an inspiring article, something
like giving us examples of actions that are being taken that are
helpful, but whatever haha.

but to the point i want to make now: the truth is we all have the
power to slow down their juggernaut at an incredibly fast pace when
people realize how powerful they really are. not to sound irrationally
nationalist but americans, each american has vast power granted by the
US constitution to control their own destiny. it is written in it that
we have every justifiable right to protect ourselves, against tyranny in
every form. so what i'm trying to say is every american are as powerful
as they are allowed to be as written in the constitution, which goes
far.

so we then have these elites who wish to control everything because
they worship power, lets call it their religion. their religion tells
them 'prosperity by all means necessary'. and then you have america
since by its very inception is all about maintaining inalienable
inherent human rights.

so theres been a clash, always i'd say. over time americans have
literally been culled into a herd mentality. 65% of adult americans are
overweight, and 90% i believe have TVs. i think this is indicative of
something. its systematic programming.

and look where we are today in April 2006. the most fascistic
presidency on record (for this country) on the verge of declaring war on
a 3rd country in less than 5 years because of a state orchestrated
implosion of some of the tallest buildings on earth 5 years ago designed
to terrorize the people of the country to walk into an open
dictatership.

i dunno what else to say.

I basically agree with everything Makow writes but I don't agree with
this quote "We get our values, identity, meaning and love from our
family roles". All 'roles' are created to fit the agenda. We are not
born to live 'roles'. We are born to live with creativity and
spontaneity until it's beaten out of us by society, schools, parents and
workplace.

And it's no surprise the 9/11 movie is coming out. They need to

I wonder if the Iranian Government would consider hiring a PR firm in
Washington? Since the U.S. has no sanctions in place against Iran at
present, it's not out of the question.

I remember that the Serbian Govt. of Milosevic was not allowed to
hire a PR firm in Washington because of sanctions against his country.

However, this did not prevent the Republic of Croatia, the Republic
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the parliamentary opposition in Kosovo from
hiring Ruder Finn Global Public Affairs, a Washington DC-based public
relations firm.

When interviewed in 1993, James Harff, Ruder Finn's director related
how he used a file of several hundred journalists, politicians,
representatives of humanitarian associations, and academics to
manufacture public opinion against Serbia.

I think perhaps most people fail to consider the obvious. Israel was
and is a constuct of the West. Israel was brought into existence to
destabilize the middle east because of their oil reserves. Globalization
seeks unfettered access to the worlds resources. To do that,the
globalist seek to undermine national sovereignty not only in the
satellites of the former U.S.S.R,but in the middle east as well. Iraq
and Iran are just small pieces in this very deadly conquest which is
being run by the very old rule of divide and conquer. Of course a
compliant and controlled media is being used to further these ends. One
should not be surprised to find that being the case. It is not about
building democracy in the middle east,it is about destroying nations
that are in the way of controlling these very important resources.

Alexander Franklin Mutter, a.k.a. Floyd Smoots said, too bad you
kicked one of the better educated folks off your discussion board, Jeff.
I have NO apologies to make to you. It's your little world-game here at
R.I., and your quirky rules; but when you ban someone like me who
actually means no harm, accusing me of being more heat than light, and
continue to let a TOTAL FOOL like "professorpan" stay onboard to wash
the soles of your feet with his lizard-like tongue, then both of us,
Jeff and Alex are the Real Losers.

I would still like to know the why of "no one" on your board can
"dis" Jews in any way (and I truly am NOT Anti-Semitic!), but it's just
grand to let pagans, new-agers, et al, ad infinitum, ad nauseam,
disparage the God of the Holy Bible and the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and
all of us who believe in it.

However, very much like yourself, Jeff, I DO try to live in the real
world, such as it is, so I already think I know the answers to my
questions. Just wanted to let you know that I still read the "nuggets of
gold" and the "Excrement" (professorpan comes to mind), so knowing what
little of you that I do, I do not consider your blog a total loss.

While I would enjoy re-instatement, and I won't lie about that, I

The difference, if you haven't noticed, is that people can get their
feelings hurt, and gods can't. Gods are either non-existent, and
therefore have no feelings to *be* hurt, or they're transcendent, and
thus above it all. Either way, it turns out not to be a problem.

People, on the other hand, are delicate and easily damaged and
therefore you have to be very careful in what you say about them.

RI is a fascinating blog/forum and so deserves ongoing notice to see
just how good it is.

And occasionally a post like Floyd's throws out some big clues that
it is not yet that good, and further clues emerge by the type of
response or lack of it to these posts.

What? Jeff bans someone that will "dis" Jews? While I don't favor
disrespecting Jews at all it seems more like a free speech issue, and to
censor free speech even when distasteful is not what I thought this site
was about.

I also notice that some groups (like government) can get dissed a lot
here as they should be.

Now Floyd claims that Christians and Christ can get dumped on freely
here without any problem, but Jews are treated differently (it's not
tolerated). Is this true Jeff?

So far Jeff is silent on this but starroute condescendingly jumps to
defend Jeff and lecture Floyd at the same time, to explain why
disparaging Jesus Christ is OK and different than attacking Jews, which
is not OK. He tells Floyd:

"The difference, if you haven't noticed, is that people can get their
feelings hurt, and gods can't. Gods are either non-existent, and
therefore have no feelings to *be* hurt, or they're transcendent, and
thus above it all. Either way, it turns out not to be a problem. People,
on the other hand, are delicate and easily damaged and therefore you
have to be very careful in what you say about them. See the difference?"

What about Christian people starroute, who are "hurt" and "offended"
by vile attacks on Jesus Christ whom they love and believe is the son of
God? Are their feelings so inferior?

Do you now admit starroute that Floyd made a good point and that it
was you who failed to see a difference?

I suspect Floyd and many like him are not really "anti-Semitic" when
they criticize Jews because they're probably criticizing a relatively
small group of militant Jews called Zionists who as part of the
Illuminati have a well-documented global enslavement agenda, but Floyd
and crowd unfortunately neglect to make that distinction.

Failing to make the distinction between Jews in general and Zionists
may be wrong, but it isn't anti-semitism.

However I think most well-read persons (like Jeff) know this very
well, so it amazes me that he would still selectively censor, ban, and
impose political correctness on one group versus another as is being
alleged, and please Jeff correct me if I am misunderstanding the
situation.

Halacha and Agada

Law and Spontaneity

Order and Liberty

These three word pairs point to the same thing. All experience
contains both elements. When unbalanced, negative expressions are more
likely to occur. When one of the pair is denigrated in order for the
other to be built up, both will hide substance.

Some seem to want to freeze the spiritual into the physical, that is
order comes from the spiritual and should determine everything. Trouble
is, what is the actual nature of that order, beyond ones pretentious
conceptions (religion)? The polar mental type will claim that order
comes from the material.

Both styles of mentality are uncomfortable with how the pre-manifest
becomes manifest.

So all to often we focus on; which side of the coin should be facing
up? Rather than the potentially more productive pursuit of figuring out
what the coin is made of.

Its obvious that the media, and the Bush administration, are actively
distorting what Iran is saying and doing. Its absurd to believe that
Iran, under any type of leadership, would do anything that would only
lead to its assured destruction. What that means is that even if they
get the bomb, thats all it will amount to, they will have the bomb.

Hey, this whole business about developing new languages or new
vocabularies is, to quote Col. Potter, just horse cookies, and serves
only to obfuscate. You just need to trust yourself.

Humans have developed in response to a variety of things but
primarily what we are results from our social organization. To live as a
social creature, we have developed the ability to lie and to detect
lies.

You may not have any confidence in your ability to lie or detect
lies, but you should, because other people do. Further, these other
people know how to erode your confidence and belief in detecting lies.

If you can't get a bead on something, if you can't detect a lie, its
probably because you don't have enough information or contact with the
lier to make your determination. This is a serious issue because it is
another way liers use to evade detection. That is why the media should
really be called disinter-media-tion.

There may be shades of lies, subleties, or subject matter that keeps
you from seeing a lie, but not other languages or vocabularies. Believe
in what you see, what you hear and feel. Call it cognitive dissonance,
bullshit detector, bad vibes, gut feelings or whatever - just listen to
it. More often than not, when someone is lying to you, you will know.

their own pretences before they trust someone that challenges those
pretences.

When you feel the need for a bowel movement .. trust that feeling and
go sit on a toilet.

Or, you could choose to believe that it is not real, and make a mess
in your pants.

Your choice.

We simply must be able to trust ourselves or we're lost. In trusting
ourselves we can begin trusting others. Discernment.

America can stand in front of a 13 strip flag and still say, "In God
We Trust" then blow away hundreds of thousands of people all over the
world from Vietnam to Iraq and boast that you are doing the lords work,
certainly must give God reason enough to wipe you off his good books. I
think your founding fathers should have stuck with the original flag of
the coiled up serpent over a black background forming a 666. Even the
devil goes to church on Sunday in the good'ol U.S of A, takes christian
money and hands it to fellow blood worshipping demon ridden lords in
Washington to help expand the new world order.

The devils ultimate goal is to get American christians to knowingly
destroy and abuse the holy spirit (which the bible say's is,
"unforgivable", got that?) You may call it peace but it don't smell like
it.

The anti-christ will arrive as a saviour and turn out to be nothing
but a dictator, like demi-god Bush who should have been run out of the
WhiteHouse long ago, yet American christians are silent. So this proves
that American's love to, no, need to kill. You killed off the
Indians,drove them out from their tee-pee's and promptly put up signs
and flags that read, "don't tread on me,"

The black marble statue that sits way up there on your capital
building, do you dorks even know who it is? It was put up there as a
dedication to the god of war. Your true god. There are other countries
whose rulers may have slaughtered millions more but at least they didn't
claim to be born-again christians. America simply is not a christian
nation. Pat Robertson is not a christian. He may call himself one, but
you are and always will be American's first. Your lifestyles and
blasphemous ways are proof enough to that fact. Any country who kills in
the name of freedom and bares false witness against his neighbour so as
to steal and covet their resources is anti-christ. Satans new world
order is here and American christians made it happen.

Well said, anonymous from 1:53 PM.

I would only differ in stating that American Christians didn't make
Satan's new world order happen.

Satanists did it, by waging war against Christians who are now being
destroyed too with different tools and on a different schedule, but
destroyed nonetheless.

Yes Pat Robertson is a certified non-Christian who infiltrated the
Christian movement to discredit it, and he has done his job.

He was on the cover of TIME a few years ago with a classic Masonic
hand signal. His father was a 33d degree Freemason and former Senator.
Somehow amazing lucrative media-empire deals have come his way.

However unlike his other buddies like Jerry Falwell (financed by Rev
Moon) and Billy Graham (33d degree Mason) he has been prone to constant
slips of tongue where he reveals his true nature (obsession with death,
i.e., promotes forced abortion policy in China and advocates
assassination of foreign leaders). That is the fruit to measure him by.

Another "Reverend" who doesn't even invoke the name of Jesus Christ
or pretend to be Christian, but rather blackmails corporations for a
living, is Jesse Jackson (an unrepentant adulterous "Reverend" and also
a 33d degree Mason).

It seems like masonic symbols are everywhere. The triangle of death
was chosen for a reason and according to those who had near death
experiences like a man by the name of Howard Storm, (who had no belief
system until his,) was an artist turned minister and describes in detail
and with paintings what hell is like and states that the gates to hell
are white vortex triangles.

I wouldn't wish hell on anyone, but if today's christian won't stop
living in denial when the facts are right there before our eye's and
turn our faces because those who are in pain live in a different country
then I have to ask myself what kind of souls go to heaven? I know the
meek shall inherit the earth so that leaves America out. God will judge
us accordingly so if folks think being born-again is a free pass while
living in sin then they better get a good lawyer because Jesus said on
judgment day many would say to him , 'did I not cast out evil spirits',
and do good things in your name? Which Jesus would reply, "I never knew
you!"

Like it or not, Judgment day is for all of us and with good reason.
It'll keep lower class spirits from contaminating heavenly places. Even
the Annunaki who we're the very children of God

got kicked out of the heavens.
