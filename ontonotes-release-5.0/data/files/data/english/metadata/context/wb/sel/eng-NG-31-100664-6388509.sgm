I touched him but he couldn't be touched.. Let me remind you that he
was defending himself from the hardship of love.. He turned yellow in
the face of affection so he himself would not suffer as I did.. there
was no empathy.. It was his fight to believe in himself, while the
world pressured him to do otherwise.. it was a fight that determined
the character of his mind as somewhat iconoclastic.. If there were
masks I could wear that could give me the sensation of death, I would
remain stuck to the mask.  As such he wanted his own space, and set
boundaries before me.. when lovers filled up his room, there was no
boundary, except that I just stand there next to him, he would urge me
to retreat.. and in the darkness I would retreat.  Give me freedom and
the Laws of Physics.. do not make it necessary that I break my heart
for Truth.. in order to follow it, I must break the heart that
decides.. and in pieces there came my failing health as epilogued as
'In sickness Unto Death'.. the despair that exists in holding your
breath for ages until accidents happen, was the kind of despair I
would never want for the outcome would be just the same.. it is better
to live once than to live forever.  If it closes the book, then I am
assured things have been resolved..but if my eyes are opened there is
no resolution, and if I am conscious perpetually rotating on the
objects in the room I am bound to I could wait but there would be
nothing waiting could give.. so the final fixture of that is a
stillshot of me screaming without end.. Figaro fIgaro fiGaroooo!  No
one sees me in this secret place.. my screams are masked.. I will wait
to witness what unfolds.. nothing happens.. I will wait even more.. I
became a catatonic metaphysically.  But things of love are with secret
demons, but hey!, who the fuck cares really?   I will not hestitate to
be attached just for the sake of machismo.. as a matter of fact, men
are slime and your father lied to you.. And I am the one who knows.. I
revisit the old song by Danzig entitled 'Mother' where children are
snatched from the motherly influence into a dark world where they bind
hands with father to create the ultimate posse.. Tell your children
not to walk my way, what I mean, what I say, mother... Father!  Do you
want to bind hands tonight?? Do you want to show her my World?? It is
a twisted form of perfection to think women have to be punished for
their ways.. men have the upperstrength so they must remain humble
with their strengths when it comes to dealing with wives, mothers, and
spouses.. to abuse it is to become a monster.. a monster created by a
moral idea.. should we kiss the ideas before we kiss others and even
ourselves?  the moral prize is pathetic.. the word courage is just as
pathetic as the word 'wisdom'.. those were old yarns brought up too
many times till the yarns themselves would by careless hands be in
knots.. the worst thing in the world is an itch you can't quite
scratch..but thanks be to Cosmic Law that the goals we pursue cannot
come to an end by its completion, we were much happier when things
were being built for a purpose, to establish a civilization in man's
name so it could exalt man as victorious over the elements that oppose
his victory.. but social disorder can be loads of fun too.. if
everyone walked the line, we would have to brace our necks for the
upcoming utopia.. so as much as I want to construct, I also want to
deconstruct so it reconstructs as something else.. anyways, I will
spend my later years carving stool out of elephant penis.. did you
take it the wrong way, you sicko? no, I mean I'll be chiselling
elephant penis out so I can make seats for my friends and family..
aside from science and theology, forget that crap Sigmund, I just
called you so I could have a round of golf with you.. that is 1000X
better than theological crap.. be afraid be very afraid of being
serious.. it will darken your world till you kill in the name of
Love.. I pull my hair over being stressed out because stress kills
braincells and this stresses me the most.  Anyways, fuck God and I
hope you die exploding on film..
