Part 3
See part 0 for header information.

She was sitting on the catwalk above the cargo bay, legs dangling in mid air,
her arms hooked over the railing. Her face, god he wanted to kiss her face, was
just about sick with yearning and he knew why.

Even as he stood there, just out of sight, watching her back rise and fall as
she breathed, he saw her fingers clutch tight around the rails and her legs
begin to pull themselves up.

&quot;Hey.&quot; She spun around at his voice, her eyes flicking with anger and
frustration. &quot;You better not be about to get up and go to join 'em. You're
s'posed to be resting.&quot;

&quot;I am resting.&quot; She pouted and let her legs fall back down. &quot;I been resting for
a week!&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; He crouched down next to her and grinned into her scowl. &quot;You just keep
it that way.&quot;

&quot;It ain't fair. You wanna be tellin' people off, tell them off.&quot; She pointed
down to the cargo bay, where Zoe and Mal were teaching the finer points of hoop
ball to Simon and River. With greater or lesser success. &quot;They're just about
flauntin' it.&quot;

Even Jayne had to admit that it was cruel, just cruel to be running around like
that when Kaylee was just itchin' to be doin' the same. Hell, a few days in the
black and Jayne was ready to be down there as well. But he weren't.

&quot;You gonna get all pouty on me an' I'm just gonna pick you up, dump you down in
your bunk an' lock the door.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn't.&quot;

&quot;I won't have to. Mal finds out you were tinkering with that engine without
help an' he'll do it for me.&quot;

&quot;I was...&quot; Her denial died on her lips as he glared. &quot;... just tinkering with a
few parts is all. You spying on me round the clock now?&quot;

&quot;I wasn't spying.&quot; Jayne didn't even bother acting offended. &quot;Weren't my fault
I was walking past and the door was open and your feet were pokin' out from
under the machine, your toes all pink an' bubbly an' just beggin' to be
tickled.&quot;

&quot;I don't have ticklish feet!&quot; But the way her cheeks flooded with color and her
eyes shifted off to the side told him otherwise and it made him sorry he hadn't
given in to that particular temptation. &quot;If you weren't spying on me, then what
were you doin' walking around at three in the morning?&quot;

&quot;I told you, I was jus' walkin' past.&quot;

He could look as innocent as she could.

&quot;You know.&quot; Kaylee's eyes got that little glint in them that made him want to
back away, back away quickly. &quot;With them down there playin' ball and Inara off
with her client, there ain't no one around to walk past now.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; He looked down towards the game, where River darted quickly out of
Mal's reach and sent the ball flying towards Simon, who wasn't having near as
much luck avoiding Zoe. &quot;Is that so?&quot;

&quot;It is.&quot; Her voice was all low and sweet, too. It made his ear tingle. &quot;Nobody
but you an' me.&quot;

He swallowed.

&quot;Just us?&quot;

She nodded, letting the very tip of her teeth bite down, little white buttons
in the plump flesh of her bottom lip.

&quot;Just us and a wrench or two.&quot;

The very thought made him want to groan out loud and he settled for reaching
forward and kissing that mouth, just very softly.

&quot;Don't think I don't know what you're doin', Kaylee. I ain't no exercise bike
to work off steam.&quot; His knees cracked when he stood up. &quot;Now, you need anything
from the kitchen? Some water? I'll go get it, you stay right here. You don't
move nothin'.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; She sighed and laid her chin back on the railing. &quot;I'm being very
good.&quot;

Prompt #021: Lonely
Words: 533.

PARTNERS IN CRIME.

Kaylee thought she was gonna burst if she didn't get up and off the ship soon.

At least she had company.

&quot;You an' me alone again, hey girl?&quot;

She didn't expect a reply, they'd fallen into a fairly recognizable pattern
over the last week. Sitting atop the catwalks an' watchin' the others load up
and leave 'em behind. Mal shoutin' orders, Zoe echoin' 'em and Jayne just
nodding along.

And she could have sworn they both sighed when the door would close behind
them, leaving them abandoned until the group returned either triumphantly or
somewhat ragged.

It was eerie how much they had in common, really. Kaylee felt as if parts of
herself were missing. Oh, nothing physical or solid, just some real vital stuff
like her energy and her ability to lift more'n a hammer for longer than two
minutes at a time. Slowly, and with care, these parts would be replaced.

It was just the slowly side of things was taking far too long.

Not that she would have been going with them at any other time, she was rarely
ever chosen for jobs and she preferred it that way. Her strengths were never of
the conflict kind. Kaylee just missed having the choice.

At least she could be sure that whatever Jayne was doing, he weren't gonna be
seeing no other women. He might have liked to play around, but he was as loyal
as all get out when it came to things like that. She didn't have nothing to
worry about.

Not when her partner in crime, sitting beside her, was visibly replaced
everyday, had to sit and watch herself be pushed aside for something newer and
shinier and somehow more complete.

Kaylee thought about going to the kitchen and getting more of her nutritional
supplement, but the idea stuck in her throat. She could never bring it out here
and eat it in front of her friend, because that would be plain mean, a last
desecration. The guilt of it would stick in her mouth, cleave to her teeth and
the roof of her mouth. No, she'd save that for later.

At least she could get up and go down into the infirmary, talk to Simon if she
felt like it. Not that she really did right now. Or go to Inara's shuttle if
she was onboard the ship.

They weren't standing over her anymore, shrieking hysterically if she even
dared move any kind of muscle. Freedom of movement was something she'd grown to
dearly love. Now she understood some of what made River stretch and forever
test the boundaries of her body.

Yeah, they were gone and they would most likely be gone for hours, doing
whatever they did when they left the two of them sitting there. Lonely.
Abandoned. Kaylee ran a hand over the long, sleek line of her new friend,
wishing that she were more than a mere shell.

She stood up and thought about fine tuning the engine.

&quot;Don't worry, Vera, he'll be back soon.&quot;

As she left the empty gun sitting in its case, Kaylee wondered how long it
would take Jayne to find another custom full gauge hair trigger lock mechanism.

Prompt #022: Hunger.
Words: 573.

JUST A SCRAPE.

Damn if the job didn't go south again.

Jayne's shoulder stung like a bitch, but he wasn't gonna say nothin' about it
as he an' Zoe helped Mal stumble up into the infirmary, River trailing behind.
Girl had told Mal their contact couldn't be trusted and he damn well should
have listened. It's why they bought her along in the first place.

Gorram Mal's stubborn need to get paid.

Simon took over and fussed about some, Zoe stayed to help and River, River of
all people, ordered him to sit there in the common room and wait 'til he could
be seen. He musta been more injured than he thought, 'cause he found himself
too tired to argue with her.

&quot;Jayne?&quot; He was wondering when Kaylee would show up. &quot;What happened? Is
everyone alright? Oh god, you're bleeding.&quot;

&quot;Just a scrape, Kaylee, you don't need to worry none.&quot; He followed her line of
sight to where Mal was sitting on the table. If his face was anything to go by,
he was teachin' Simon some new curse words. &quot;Mal got shot in the leg, but it
ain't nothin' either.&quot;

She was bright enough to notice that not even Simon seemed all that tense, just
annoyed at Mal for whatever he was sayin' until he was able to be doped up. He
watched her settle some and turn back to him.

&quot;You sure you're okay?&quot;

&quot;'Course I'm okay. More'n okay now you're here.&quot; He reached out, grabbed her
hand and pulled her down onto the seat next to him. &quot;What'd you do while I was
out?&quot;

&quot;Worry 'bout you.&quot; She was smiling again as she leaned in close and suddenly it
was all quiet again. &quot;I ain't allowed to do anything else.&quot;

His arm was hanging by his side between them and Jayne looked down to where his
hand lay right by her thigh. It didn't hurt none to inch his fingers over a
little and slide over the material of her coveralls.

&quot;It's for your own good.&quot; He barely got the words out as her lips parted in a
gasp. &quot;You gotta be all careful an' quiet like for now.&quot;

That bought a smile to her face and she smiled slowly.

&quot;I can be quiet.&quot;

Yup, it was about then that Jayne's mind firmly packed its bags and moved out.

&quot;Kaylee.&quot; He whispered, almost groaning as her hand found his leg. &quot;I been
good.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; She kissed his cheek. &quot;A little too good.&quot;

His eyes closed and his head fell back as her mouth made its way over his chin
and down his neck.

&quot;Kaylee.&quot; He tried again. &quot;We can't do this here.&quot;

He felt her shift up and was about to open his eyes when she straddled him, her
weight sitting easily just past his hips. Even as he wanted to complain, he
found his hands were reaching up and grabbing her waist.

&quot;If I left it up to you, Jayne, we wouldn't do it anywhere. You're fussier than
a girl on her first time.&quot;

She cupped his chin and kissed him hard and his hands gripped tighter and
pulled her in so she was all up against him. She felt so good. And her little
moan, half pleasure half frustration, just about drove him crazy.

Somebody coughed politely.

&quot;Jayne?&quot; And they both looked over to Simon standing in the door to the
infirmary. &quot;I need to look at that shoulder.&quot;

Prompt #023: Vampire.
Words: 570.

CARRION EATER.

&quot;Ow.&quot; Jayne gritted his teeth. &quot;Ow.&quot;

&quot;I said,&quot; Simon tugged the weave through his skin a little rougher than Jayne
thought was needed, &quot;stay still.&quot;

Jayne glared.

&quot;And I said 'ow', gorramit. Ain't you got nothin' for the pain?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

Another vicious tug and another wince.

&quot;No, you ain't got nothin'?&quot; Jayne asked. &quot;Or no, you ain't got nothin' for me?&quot;

Maybe he was mistaken, but he could have sworn he'd seen the corner of Simon's
mouth twist up into a smile. Just for a second. Jayne craned his neck so he
could watch the hands tie off the weave on his shoulder.

&quot;I meant what I said before.&quot; Simon's voice was steady and calm. &quot;I won't hurt
you when you're on this table.&quot;

Jayne snarled and pushed his way up off the bed.

&quot;S'at what this is about?&quot; A flush of red ran over Simon's face. &quot;You're tryin'
to be nice about it all 'cause you think I'll turn you an' River in still?
'Cause I wouldn't do that, not now, not after...&quot;

They both stared at each other and Jayne just wished the whole thing'd be over.
Back home he just woulda smacked the man stupid and it would all have been over
nearly a year ago. This here is exactly what he got for doin' the right thing.

&quot;Fine.&quot; Simon had the grace to look away first. &quot;Whatever. I think we're done
here...&quot;

&quot;No. No way, we ain't done.&quot; Jayne's fingers itched and he clasped them
together, unconsciously making a fist. &quot;You got somethin' to say, Simon, why
don't you finally grow a pair and just say it?&quot;

&quot;You want me to say what I think? Is that it?&quot; Simon breathed in. &quot;I think
you're a vampire, Jayne, I think you circled around your prey and waited until
there was a weakness so you could swoop in and leach it dry. You're like a
flea, a parasite sucking life out of something else because you don't have any
of your own, you're like a carrion eater.&quot;

&quot;That's what you tell yourself is it? You think I'm some snake just slitherin'
around waitin' to strike?&quot; Jayne tugged his shirt back on. &quot;Yeah, you keep
tellin' yourself that and maybe one day you'll believe it. 'Cause we both know
what happened. Hell, everyone knows.&quot;

He stepped toward Simon, squaring his shoulders back so that he stood to his
full height.

&quot;Truth is, smart man, you had her and she woulda done just about everythin' and
anythin' you asked had you just asked. But you didn't. No, you hadda push her
down again and again until she had no tears left to shed over you.&quot;

His hand reached out of its own accord and pushed Simon back into the wall.

&quot;Truth is, I didn't wait for no weakness, she did. It were Kaylee came to me.
You even understand that? Kaylee chose me. You had her and she came to me
anyway. Truth is, Mr. Top Three, she's with me now and I'm gonna make damn sure
she don't need to go elsewhere.&quot;

He turned around and began to walk away, stopping just inside the door.

&quot;Know what a carrion eater is, Doc? It's a bird that makes it meals from
something that's already dead. It don't need to do any killin'. Maybe you were
right about that bit.&quot; He let the words sink in. &quot;Now I think we're done.&quot;

Prompt #024: Day.
Words: 755.

SEGMENT.

&quot;Can I look yet?&quot;

&quot;Have I said ya can look yet?&quot;

&quot;Jayne?&quot; She kept her arms out and her eyes closed, there was no real need to
look, she trusted him to lead her straight and her own feet knew the footing of
the ship as well as she knew her own body. &quot;What are you doin'?&quot;

Her nose twitched as they entered the cargo bay. If her eyes were opened they
would have widened. A lot. As it was, she just smiled.

&quot;You takin' me outside?&quot; She bounced a little. &quot;I get to leave the ship?&quot;

&quot;Dammit, Kaylee.&quot; He sounded upset. &quot;Can't nothin' be a surprise with you?&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Her words were quick. &quot;Forget I said it, I don't know nothin', I
promise.&quot;

She could almost hear him struggle not to smile with it.

&quot;Mal says we got all day here. We can do anything we want.&quot; Their steps lead
them over the ramp, she felt hard packed dirt under her feet and the
unmistakable scent of green plants got stronger. &quot;I mean, we got a few chores,
but nothin' too hard.&quot;

&quot;Now can I look?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Jayne.&quot; It was almost a whine. &quot;People are gonna see me.&quot;

&quot;Don't they normally see you?&quot;

That made her giggle.

&quot;Not bein' led around with my eyes closed.&quot;

She heard voices getting closer and felt the earth get firmer, noises sounded
around her, the soft noises of a small town going about its day, there was the
deep, earthy scent of horses nearby and somewhere, somewhere close, she heard
the beginning of market barkers about to start.

It wasn't even hard, giving over to it and letting him have his fun. It was
actually kinda nice, feeling the warm sun on her skin and his hand on her back.
Once or twice the loud squeal of children running around them and pushing past
made her stop and grab onto him, but after a while she stopped doing even that.

&quot;Okay,&quot; he whispered it low into her ear, all breathy, &quot;lift your feet now,
there's a step there.&quot;

&quot;Good morning.&quot; A voice greeted them as she felt the earth give way to wooden
floor.

&quot;Mornin'.&quot; Jayne answered, then put his mouth back to her ear. &quot;Okay, now open.&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot;

Her nose had picked up the tantalizing scent of sweetness and green and her
skin had prickled with the cooler air inside the store, so she'd known where
they were, even so the sight of the shelves bursting with brightly colored
fruit made her gasp.

&quot;Jayne.&quot; She turned into him and whispered low. &quot;What are we doin' here? We
can't afford no...&quot;

&quot;Yes we can.&quot; He looked as if he wasn't gonna take no for an answer. &quot;I got it
all worked out. You choose somethin' so we can get about our day, dong ma?&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;You choose or I'm takin' you right back to the ship.&quot;

It was tempting, all of it, the small, plump berries she knew would be bursting
with juices, or the crisp apples, or the smooth silkiness of the mangoes. But
that wasn't what she chose, her eyes fell on the perfect thing and her hand
reached out to tenderly pick it up.

&quot;That what you want?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

He paid with some coin and they went back outside into the warm air. Kaylee
cradled the chilled fruit in her hand as they walked along the street and
looked at the different stalls.

&quot;You get tired, you tell me, okay?&quot;

The fingernail of her thumb slid under thick skin.

&quot;Jayne.&quot; She sighed. &quot;We talked about this, you don't mother me and I won't try
an' stop you doin' whatever it is you got planned.&quot;

She watched his eyes flicker down to her hands, saw him follow the movement of
them as she twisted it around, extracting more and more flesh. He licked his
lips.

&quot;Don't got much planned, really, 'cept just before we're ready to go back. Then
we got some groceries to pick up an' some post waitin' for us. Other than that,
the day's yours.&quot;

She liked the sound of that. Without looking at it, her thumb found the small
depression and she pushed into the fruit, pulled the flesh apart and smelled
the ripeness of it.

&quot;God I missed these.&quot;

Kaylee carefully pulled off a segment of the orange and handed it over to him.

&quot;No.&quot; He tried to hand it back. &quot;I bought it for you.&quot;

She grinned.

&quot;And I chose it to share.&quot;

It tasted sweeter in halves anyway.

Prompt #025: Night.
Words: 550.

LIKE FATHER...

&quot;My Dear Boy.

Sorry to hear the job went bad. I know your work isn't easy. The credits you
forward are a help, but don't worry if you can't send them. We manage just fine
without it. You keep what you need. Just glad to hear from you.

Love, your mother.&quot;

&quot;Jayne Cobb!&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; He ducked his head. &quot;Yeah?&quot;

Kaylee leaned over and swiped the letter at him.

&quot;We've got paid for every job we've done lately! I know it an' you know it!
Which means not only did you lie to your own mother, you didn't send her the
money when you damn well could have!&quot;

&quot;I didn't lie!&quot; She glared at him. &quot;Not much anyhow. I needed that money.&quot;

&quot;You didn't need it.&quot; Kaylee sighed. &quot;You didn't need to get all that stuff.&quot;

This he could look her in the eye for.

&quot;Yes. I did.&quot;

&quot;It was too much, Jayne. Too much.&quot; She ran a hand over his shoulder and he
felt so solid under her touch. &quot;First you sold off your guns, now you scrimped
on sending credits home which I ain't never known you to do since you been with
us and you still haven't told me what you did for those days they had you off
ship.&quot;

&quot;I'll get better guns. And Vera's nearly back to workin' order.&quot; His eyes
looked her up and down and she wondered if he was really talking about his gun.
&quot;It was worth it.&quot;

&quot;And...?&quot;

She wasn't going to drop it and now was the perfect time. They'd spent all day
wandering around town and he'd let her chatter on about this and that and
nothing much at all that she could remember. They were both tired and he was
just that little bit more open with her now than he usually was. Heated with
sunlight and a letter from home.

&quot;It weren't nothin', Kaylee.&quot;

&quot;Then why won't you tell me?&quot;

He breathed in.

&quot;Welding, okay? We had enough to buy some of the meds and stuff, but not all.&quot;
His hands must be interesting, the way he kept looking down at them and not
her. &quot;They let me work off the rest of it. You happy now?&quot;

Not particularly, no. The engine thumped near them. They were sitting on the
floor, their backs against the wall. For some reason, Jayne had wanted to spend
time in here, away from the others, preferred to be alone with her where no one
else could see. She figured it had something to do with Simon.

&quot;You worked in a factory?&quot; He nodded slowly and she reached out to touch the
line of stubble on his jaw leading up to underneath his ear. &quot;You hate workin'
in factories an' the like.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; A small, bitter little laugh. &quot;But there ain't no one can weld like a
Cobb. Just ask my pa.&quot;

&quot;It's why you left home.&quot; She continued. &quot;So's you wouldn't have to do it.&quot;

&quot;Look, Kaylee, I know all this, okay? It ain't nothin' I haven't heard before,
so unless you got somethin' new to add, just drop it.&quot;

&quot;Only this.&quot; And she kissed him again, decided she liked kissing him, because
as much as he said he didn't like doing it, he was always eager about it.
&quot;Thank you, Jayne.&quot;
