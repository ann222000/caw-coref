Chosse session in XDM

Hi,

How do I choose the session with the XDM login manager? I have TWM and
XFCE installed. In runlevel 3, when I login as a user, I can fire up XFCE
with 'startx', since I defined my window manager beforehand with
'xwmconfig'. But when I switch to runlevel 4 in /etc/inittab, XDM fires
up and wants to start TWM.

Any idea where I can define the X session? I leafed through the files in /
etc/X11/xdm, but to no avail, and unfortunately, the xdm manpage is
written in some remote klingon slang.

cheers,

Niki

I don't think it is possible to point and click to choose session with
xdm. With kdm and gdm you can point and click to choose session.

Try to copy your .xinitrc to .xsession

If you don't need remote login through xdm, it's worth looking at slim as
a login manager, which is very lightweight and has a simple session
configuration.

That should work.

Incidentally, even the kllingon manpages often list useful cross-
references at the end of the page.  Even the xdm page :-)

Yeah, I know Slim, and I've been using it some time. Except it's supposed
to run in runlevel 3. Never managed to get the thing to work correctly in
runlevel 4. Which is a nuisance, when you have your users staring at a
blinking screen when they log out. Or once in a while, Slim won't even
fire up, and then there's just the console.

But I just spent the best part of a cold grey day trying to get a nice
configuration out of XDM, and heyyy, it's much better now. Even managed a
nice background PNG with qiv. In short, it looks now like a North Korean
edition of Mac OS X :oD

As usual, I ended up reading the whole load of it anyway. One thing that
confused me was that the config files in /etc/X11/xdm are hard-linked to /
usr/lib/X11/xdm.

Niki

Your description does not gel with my experiences of using slim, but it's
been a while, and my slackbox is now running kdm and KDE everything else
too.

You must have a lot of patience.  If you had that kind of time and energy
you could simply have themed twm to look like KDE  :-)

Oh don't, you're making me all nostalgic for the 20th century, when men

Have a look at the actual content of /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession.
Once you look at the options of using $1 versus $HOME/.xsession
(see lines 104-110), then you can decide which is best for you.

Look ahead for some new distros I'm working on:

- TWbuntu
- FVWbuntu
- Ratpobuntu

The crowd will love it.

My old X programming books call it &quot;X Window System&quot;. But I notice that
everyone nowdays calls it the X Windows System, which actually makes more
sense. Sometimes new things are not all that bad after all. Take
directories vs folders for instance[1]. I would call them directories
anyday but the folder analogy makes far more sense that the directory
analogy.

old) You store your files in this directory so that when you run your
program it can load them from the directory.

new) You store your files in this folder so that when you run your program
it can load them from the folder.

Most people associate directories as storage for information about people,
places or businesses. Whereas most people associate folders with cardboard
things you store your paper work in. It is easier to get a person trained
in the business world to relate to the folder analogy. For instance your
accounts are stored in this folder and your accounting program loads the
accounting files out of that folder.

Well, if you can draw one window you can draw more.  We don't talk about
the &quot;brakes system&quot; or the &quot;suspensions system&quot; on your car.  So the
first is better.

I still think of them as directories, but when I'm speaking out loud I
always say &quot;folder&quot;.  Years of working with Mac and Windows people will
do that to one :-)

...speaking of which, if you REALLY have lots of time and patience and a
fetish for xdm, I think you *could* set it up so you could choose your
session with a mouse click. You could write scripts to modify the
session (on my box I could do it by changing what /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
points to, since my xdm ignores ~/.xsession, but I have no idea whether
that's the right way or a profoundly stupid way to do it) and then call
these via xmessage buttons defined in /etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0. You could
even have them update xdm's background via /usr/bin/display or whatever,
so it's nice and obvious what session you're about to enter (e.g. you
could whack up your KDE wallpaper when the KDE button's pressed, or your
XFCE wallpaper when that one's pressed, etc.).

I haven't actually tried this (the modifying /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
part...I do have reboot and shutdown buttons in xdm) but don't see why
it wouldn't work. Of course, it'd be a heck of a lot easier just to use
kdm or gdm or qingy or whatever...

I'm personally just going to stick with what the X man page says:

# The X.Org Foundation requests that the following names be used when
# referring to this software:
#
#                                  X
#                           X Window System
#                             X Version 11
#                     X Window System, Version 11
#                                 X11

But, of course, everyone is free to do as they please. :)
