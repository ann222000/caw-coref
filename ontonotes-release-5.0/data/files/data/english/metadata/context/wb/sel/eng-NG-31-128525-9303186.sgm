CALLED, CHOSEN, FAITHFUL

“These Shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for He is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with Him are called, and chosen, and faithful.”

– Rev. 17:14

There are several qualifications given in this verse. While it is true, that “in all” (or, among all) “HE shall have the preeminence,” (Col. 1:18), for He is “The Firstborn among many brethren,” (Rom. 8:29), being THE KING of kings, and THE LORD of lords, it becomes self-evident that His many brethren are a ‘lordly’ company, and a ‘kingly’ people. They will move in the royal dignity of His character, and manifest the attributes of His nature.

Now it states that they have been CALLED. For “no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God,” (Hebrews 5:4). Furthermore, they are CHOSEN – this Divine selection is the result of their having been put to the test, to be tried and proven, and found to meet His specification and thus are chosen. “For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth,” (2 Cor. 10:18). While last in the list, certainly not the least, they are FAITHFUL, “Moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful,” (1 Cor. 4:2). They have not wavered, they have not cast off their faith, but through all the testings they have adhered to Him, and by their steadfastness proven that they are indeed faithful.

“Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God,” (Rev. 1:5-6). Clothed in fine linen, which is the righteousness of the saints. Lords, kings, priests, called, chosen, faithful – no wonder it speaks of them in Jude 14, literal translation, “Lo, the Lord comes in holy myriads of Himself”. Each one conformed to His image, a partaker of His divine nature; they are an extension of HIMSELF, for they are truly HIS SONS.

No wonder Peter exhorts us to “give diligence to make your calling and election sure,” (2 Peter 1:10. We would give total surrender, yielding to His inworkings, that we might be counted worthy “of this calling”. Amen!

Messages in this topic (2) 5. The White Dove Posted by: &quot;BishopMax&quot; BishopMax@charter.net bishopmax4 Mon Dec 10, 2007 10:43 am (PST) Hello Brothers and Sisters,

As I'm sitting here in my office, looking out the window, a Big White Dove
landed in a Magnolia Bush, as I was watching it, it kept looking at the
window like if it was looking directly at me.

Then all a sudden, I heard a voice speaking to my heart, that the Holy
Spirit was watching over my household. We never know when we will receive a
reminder that the Father is watching over us.

As I begin to write this posting, God is speaking to my heart. There is
someone that is going to read this posting, you needed to be reminded that
God, has not given up on you or your family. He told you that your husband
and children will begin to toss and tumble, and they will begin to to
wrestle with Holy Spirit, why they sudden surrender their lives over to the
Father. But as He promised. They will come to the Father. Just start seeing
them save through the eyes of the Lord, and give the Father praise.

At about 4:20pm our sweet Ashley Nichole earned her angel wings. She was very peacful, we were are there with her, including all her wonderful nurses and Dr's who loved her so.

I will update more in a day or so, our hearts are broken,

but we know Ashley is finally able to do all the things she

was never able to do.

Thank you everyone for loving our daughter,

Robin

Christmas came early for Marenna ...

Clear Scans. No Evidence of Disease.

Joy!

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

(Joe flew out today and had to take the laptop with him since it is

used for work. Karen doesn't have easy access to a computer.)

Karen asks especially for immediate prayer for herself and for the protection of Callie! She spent a lot of time cuddling Callie as best she could yesterday, putting her arms on either side of her and talking gently to her... no kisses.... but now she has come down with a terrible cold and her dad also has a sore throat. Karen asks us to please pray hard that she did not contaminate Callie with any germs that could make her sick! She has a very compromised immune system and is recovering from two abdominal surgeries as well as her heart/lung vessel surgery!

The results of the bronchoscopy were minimal.... they found few mucus plugs and were able to aspirate one small plub. The also saw some white patches inside the lung and aren't sure if they are d ue to a yeast infection or just irritation. Those are being cultured but no results yet. Interestingly, the lung from the *inside* did not appear collapsed like it does on the xray. They pumped some air into her to help keep it expanded.

Karen says that the medical folks had had to neglect the lung treatments that she normally would have had due to her abdominal issues.... but now they are going to be able to pay more attention to that.

She is on 30% oxygen, peep at 9 and at a rate of 16 breaths per minute. Her pulseox reading is in the low 80s which is good for her..... (Karen points out that these devices are not made to accurately register for babies and children.) Her PO2 is *good* for her, measuring 40%.......please note that anything 40% or higher is good for Callie's situation.

Extubation will not happen this weekend, but may be next week sometime. They are just taking it very slowly!

Her hematocrit and hemoglobin are very high, which is norma l because she has to compensate for the poor oxygenation flow.

Karen feels Callie's tummy pain is much better now that all the necrotic bowel has been removed. She is concerned, however, that when Callie wakes up, her eyes open very wide and she looks &quot;terrified.&quot; She also appears to try to cry, but can't due to the endotracheal tube. Some nurses pick up on Callie's pain issues, but Karen usually has to ask

for Callie to receive medication.

Again..... please pray that Callie was not infected with Karen's

cold and that Karen and her dad, Jack, can recover quickly!

Thank you for your continued prayers about all

areas of concern.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

Please help me help this little girl.

Please send her a Blessing in the form of a card or anything.

I can't even imagine if this was my son or daughter and it

was Christmas.

God bless all of you and especially those who will meet this need.

IVORY IS THE 7 YEAR OLD WHO RAN HER GO CART INTO THE A DOUBLE-WIDE AND SEVERED HER NECK AND SPINE,

COLLAPSED HER LUNGS AND INJURED LIVER AND SPLEEN.

SHE IS PRESENTLY QUADRIPLEGIC.

AND THEY DON'T KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE IF ANY WILL

EVER COME BACK.

SHE WOULD BE THRILLED TO RECEIVE LOTS AND LOTS OF CHRISTMAS CARDS AND NOW THAT SHE IS NOT MOVING

WE CAN MAIL THEM TO :

A month of anniversaries. The MOST noted should be Grace's

birthday on Dec. 16, she will be three. But this journey has changed that. Fighting for top spot we have memories of horror. December 8, 2005 Sharon finding that awful lump, being sent to CHOP with the knowledge that Grace had cancer, not sure if neuro or nephroblastoma. Dec 9 the dx of Wilms tumor. December 14 the nephrectomy. Dec 16 Grace's first birthday and discharge from CHOP. Seeing those eyes full of pain, a two hour drive home only 48 hours after major surgery. Cruel. First chemo Dec 23, 2005. Why can't her birthday be the only anniversary that comes to mind? When will this beast be so laid to rest that those dates are fuzzy in memory? BUT then I see Dec 14 as two years since any evidence of disease. EXHALE.

Grace has had some kinda bug going on for about 9 days, fever,

fussy, easily frustrated, no appetite. UGH. So pale and has

lost a little weight.

Today it is snowing and I said that. Grace says no it not snowing,

it snowflakes. I fail to see the difference, but every time I ask do

you want to see the snow, she says the snowflakes. She wants

to lick it but Mommy won't let her. Lots of luck with that.

And above all else the most WONDERFUL time of year, JOY to

the world. Grace and Sarah both very pleased with any and all Christmas lights. Sarah slept thru the Christmas parade and

Grace fought sleep the whole time.

Remembering our family, our very extended family. All those who

are new to us since this ordeal began. Those who have taken hold

of us and held on tight to get us thru. Many we have never seen,

and may not ever. But we will never forget. This little mini world

is a model of what the universe should be. Unconditional love,

as we have received thru that first Christmas.

Praying for those children in this battle, their siblings, parents and

all who love them. Praying for those who hurt so very much, carrying precious memories in their hearts. Please offer prayers for the cure (visit curesearch.org) Praying for those at this very moment learning

of this awful diagnosis, children forced into a world that is not for children. PRAY PRAY PRAY, that is the greatest gift you can offer.

Don't give up look up.

Deb Grace's Mom Mom

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

SUNDAY, DECEMBER 09, 2007 05:32 PM,

Stephanie is doing good -- our biggest problem today is keeping

her from doing things she shouldn't do -- like taking mask off

when they are giving her respiratory treatments and playing with feeding tube -- she is very implusive.. Hopefully this will be the

week that everything comes off - she (and we) will be a happy

camper. Suzanne, Al &amp; Ann came to visit today so helped Steph

pass some of the time. We hear it is going to be in the 70's in NC

this week -- it is in the single digits here -- with snow

on the ground.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

Abby's cat scan will be Dec. 11, and we should meet with the docs

on Dec. 13th to get the results. Keep praying for no signs of

cancer in our girl.

Last night, Abby LOST her 1st TOOTH. She was so excited. She

came down stairs at 6 am to show me her money from the tooth fairy. She told me that at school they sing a song every time some one looses a tooth and her teacher gives them a certificate.

She couldn't wait to go today.

Almost as exciting, I finished my Christmas shopping yesterday. Yahoo!!! Ben almost tossed a wrench in my plan about a week

ago when he told me he wanted to &quot;change his order&quot; for Santa.

Try expalining to a three year old the difference between a wish list

and an &quot;order.&quot; We have always told Santa to bring three gifts each

to our house, because Jesus got three gifts from the wise men. Any additions to the list means something else has to go. Actually, I haven't completely finished shopping. I haven't finished myself. I told Brad I wanted to finish decorating our bedroom as my gift. We've lived here almost 6 years and still haven't painted or hung a single thing on the walls. So that means I have to shop for myself too. I may have to wait for my gift. I'm tired of shopping now. :-) But other than my bedroom, I am done Christmas shopping until next year. I have the wrapping paper, boxes, tape, gift tags, everything. Aaahhh. Before you get to jealous - I haven't addressed a single Christmas card yet. And I still have to bake. And I still want to out lights in my front yard. The inflatable Pooh is up, but it is looking a little lonely. Off to get something done.

Merry Chrismtas.

Holly

What a star!

Tess and the Cal Young Middle School Jazz Band did a fabulous

job yesterday at Holiday Market. MUCH thanks to all the family and friends who turned out to see her (Daddy &amp; Grandma Linda, Dora,

Lisa &amp; Issac, Adelka, Alicia &amp; Jackson!) Tess says she squeaked

a little, but we heard nothing of the sort.

It was a lovely afternoon to visit with dear friends and enjoy

our hero knock out her first public saxophone solo.

She was feeling better once she was up and getting ready for the show. Unless you had inside info, you wouldn't know she had pain.

On the way to the gig, I asked how she was feeling and she said ... &quot;Better! Maybe its mind over matter.&quot; I just smiled and thought -

yep, mind over matter, and about a hundred people praying

and sending you love! Thanks to each of you!!

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

Sorry we haven't updated, our computer decided to do weird things.... but Chuck fixed it! YEAH!!!!! Sam is feeling pretty good. She is complaining of some back pain and leg cramps, but says she feels good. :( makes me nervous....We went to Children's Hospital today for lab work and all came back good. No transfusions needed. She is packing right now for her big trip and we are busy putting medicines, letters, paperwork, and everything together. It snowed this morning, scared me, but it all melted thank goodness. We are trying to keep Sam away from Karley who is sick. Chuck took her to ER Saturday night and she ended up having some infections, the main one being ear infection with pain. Brianna is doing well, we went to lunch together today which was nice. We better get busy around here and get to

bed early, it's an early flight tomorrow for Sam! She is off to the

land of palm tree's!!! Thank you so much for checking on Sam

and all the wonderful support and messages.

Lots of Love, Lisa

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

Asher is a rolling crazy man! He has rolled around before but now

it's with skill, purpose, and he's fast! He's starting to roll toward's

Dad to be with him, roll in the kitchen to be with me when I am

cooking. He rolls to his toys and whatever else he wants. We

are exhausted! We have been chasing him all day long! He's

not even crawling or walking! Ish.

I have been getting stuff done for Christmas on Saturday!

The weather is really icy outside so hopefully it won't get in

the way of our flight next Saturday!

Well I need to get laundry done for school and work tomorrow.

Love to you all,

Heather

THE WORLDWIDE CANDLE LIGHTING

Caringbridge Friends- Since this summmer I have lost 6 little friends-

I cannot imagine how their families feel with the upcoming holdiays.

A few days ago I stumbled upon this in the paper:

An organization called COMPASSIONATE FRIENDS is using Sunday, December 9, to honor all children who have become angels. At 7 p.m.

local time, light as candle to honor an angel...this will create a 24 &quot;wave

of light.&quot;

At the website Compassionate Friends you can post a message for a child who has passed, no matter the reason. You can also call (877)969-0010 toll free for more information. There is much valuable information on grieving

if you are ready.

December 9,2007

Thank you for the prayers and the love and the well wishes over the years. For listening to me go on and on and on about his labs and his veins. YOU GUYS listened. Sometimes when the doctors wouldn't. Do you know how hard that is?!!?? But finally I believe it is coming to an end. I at least have HOPE that this is coming to an end. They will make him better.

Tomorrow Aiden will see a cardiologist. They will place a simple heart monitor on him for three days. It is called a holter monitor. Pretty common. This will tell us what his heart rate is doing during the day and especially at night. I already know what it does at night. I have known for 18 months. I have documented it for 18 months. But now we will 'offically' know that his Heartrate drops dangerously low at night and thus we have all of his problems. A high level of hemaglobin to keep his oxygen levels high. Fainting, vommitting, diahrea, dehyrdation and dusfunction of his autnomic nervous system, due

to basically his body doing everything it can to keep his heartrate up. All becuase of this thing.

Christmas 2007 defintly nothing compated to Christmas of 2002,

his Gift of life. But this year I am praying thathe will get the Gift of

a QUALITY of life. After that... what else can we ask for?

I hope you enjoyed the photos and thank you for stopping by.

Check out the counter on the bottom of the page and PLEASE

UPDATE:

I FORGOT TO MENTION - WE PULLED ABEL'S LINE! He is now

free from the double lumen hickman. Abel barely cried when

they pulled it. One more victory in this war. ........................................................................................

No Glow! No evidence of disease! Clear scans! We are happy to report that we received goods news for our little fellow this week. He was great through all of the scans. He didn’t even need to be sedated. He sat still through the entire MIBG scan while I read books to him and we found various toys to keep him entertained. His labs were awesome and his marrow continues to do extremely well. He also had an EEG yesterday and we may not hear back from that until late next week. It was nice to see all the folks that where there for us during such a dark and difficult time. The caring people at St. Jude will always have a special place in our heart. Their smiles and encouraging words spoke volumes to our souls.

The next several weeks are going to be busy as we make final plans for Christmas and final preparations for me to return to school. I suspect the new year will bring many challenges but a multitude of rewards as well. Abel will return to Memphis for his next round of scans in May or June. Until then we will continue with three more rounds of accutane (we went up on his dose a little bit). If all goes

well, we may add a few more rounds of accutane but that is

far from decided.

Our hearts rejoice as we return home tonight. We are about to head

out the door to the airport so we will close for now. Thank you so much for all your prayers. Tonight, we sing our Lord’s praise with shouts of victory and joy.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

UPDATE:12-6-07

Corey is doing well. He has been busy playing with the Christmas

tree, he thinks he needs and wants all ornaments on the same

branch. It is nice to see him playing with something other than

a syringe so he gets his way. And the other kids even have to

question why there are no breakable or none of their baby

ornaments on it? He has lost just under 5 pounds and I'm

not sure why. So I tried upping his amount of formula and all

we end up with are major tummy troubles. I can figure out

why just a half an ounce extra and his system freaks out.

Emmy has not been doing well since Sunday. Saturday she was

at her best, Sunday started the nonstop seizures, gagging,

yucky sounding lungs and urine that looks like green syrup.

So we are back on meds but so far they have had no effect.

We are in the middle of another snowstorm. So I got the chance

to head outside today to shovel. At least the snow gives me an

excuse to sneak outside for awhile! Sometimes I have been afraid

to go online for so many little ones have earned their wings lately.

I won't mention names because I might forget someone. Please

keep them in your thoughts and prayers as their families

struggle without them this holiday season.

Hello and God's Peace from Big Snow Country!

It has been really cold and snowy here.. we won't complain

as it means work for Jason.. shoveling snow!

Laban is doing well. I STILL haven't heard from his immunologist

on what his test results were. She is thinking that the immune deficiency he and the girls have is just a maturational lag and will hopefully not be a lifelong thing! WOW is that ever good news!

In other news, Laban's first cousin, my niece Maria, will be

having major surgery in Boston next Tuesday. Here is her site www.caringbridge.org/visit/mariad .

Please pray for her and her family!

Have a Blessed Christmas!

God's Peace, Sarah

Hi Everyone!

Sorry for not updating. Its been a rough week. Emily and Charlie

are both feeling good. Charlie is doing better in school. Still having some emotional issues because of what is going on here at home,

but he is back to loving school and applying himself 100 percent.

Tuesday I got a phone call from Emily's teacher. A problem arose that he wasn't sure how to deal with. Emily is in 4.1 reading and the book they chose to read is Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes. I don't know how many of you are familiar with the story, but I will brief you a bit on it. It is set in Japan 9 yrs after the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Sadako is a 12yr old little girl that becomes gravely ill with Leukemia, an after effect of the atom bomb and the radiation it put off. Recalling a Japanese legend Sadako sets to work folding paper cranes. The legend says that if a sick person folds one thousand paper cranes, the Gods will grant her wish and make her healthy again. In the end Sadako folded 644 paper cranes and then she dies. The story itself is a good story. It shows the courage of this little girl and the hope that she never let die. But in the end she does die. Well Tuesday the class read the first chapter and talked about it. Emily's teacher does not look at her any different then any other kids, so when it came to this subject he did not think about whether it would effect her or not. Well a couple of the kids in the class made some comments about Emily having cancer and why didn't she die. Emily got very upset and angry.

She lashed out and all day she stayed angry.

So the teacher wanted me to read this book and let him know what I thought about Emily reading it. Now I don't think it would be a bad thing for her to read, but with Emily she reacts in 2 ways about her cancer. She either gets really mad, as she did on Tuesday, or she cries alot. So given that we decided that maybe it would be best for her to be moved to a different reading class to read a different book until they are done with this one. Sometimes we forget that even after 2 1/2 years of remission the subject of cancer is still very touchy with her. I hope that one day she will be able to read this book without any ill effects. It really is a good story.

Ok so what have we been up to? Well we didn't really do much of anything this weekend. Saturday night the kids and I decided to stay home and watch Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer. It was raining so much and we just didn't want to go out driving in it. We had a great night though. We made some popcorn and cuddled up under a blanket and watched the movie. It was a great movie. Sunday I spent most of the day running errands. Getting done some stuff that has been put off for a while. Then the week started and everyone went back to their schedules. Back to school and back to work.

I would like to ask that you continue to pray for the kids and I.

Things have been so hard for us and they just don't seem to

be getting any better or easier. Thank you.

Thank you all for checking in and for your messages. We have been checking them daily and they mean so much to us. Also thank you for your continued support and prayers. (((HUGS))) to all!!

Thank you for checking in on Emily and our family. Please don't

forget to sign the guestbook. We love to read your messages.

Please continue to pray for all the kids fighting cancer, the ones

in remission, and the families of the Precious Angels in Heaven.

We love you all and God Bless!

Love and Hugs, Angela

Prayer Need: Diyar

Hi, people.

Diyar is a very special friend. Will you please pray for this young

man facing major heart surgery. At last word he was sliding. But

he is in a good place, and I am hopeful they will get him stabilized again. He is Muslim, but he is curious about Jesus and is reading

The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in Arabic. Please pray for

Diyar and his family that they might know Jesus and to see a miracle. For more on his story you can visit &lt; http://shevet.org/diyar/ &gt; http://shevet.org/diyar/ Thank you.

PS If God puts it on your heart, please send this on to others

to pray for him.

SUNDAY, DECEMBER 09, 2007 05:48 AM, CST

Good morning everyone, I kept KK all night last night, It is the first

time I have seen her since she got home. She was glad to see me.

KK clung to be like glue. If I left the room she cried where's grandme. We watched Rudolph,frosty and Rudolph and frosty. She played with all my musical Christmas figures for hours. KK even played with Uncle Bert, usually she hides from him, but they played hide and seek for an hour. Me and KK sung our list of songs more than once. She wouldn't eat anything,not even Mc Donald's and I noticed she wouldn't drink either. The doctor already said if she stops eating she will have to get

a feeder tube, so we will be laying out a buffet for her to get her to eat. She didn't look very good when she got here but I think she was tired. She didn't have a Knapp all day yesterday, But she managed to stay up till after 10pm. She fell asleep in my bed after fighting with grandpa, she didn't want him even looking at his pillow, she wanted his pillow so she layed on it and held one side up so he couldn't lay his head on it, but she finally fell asleep. KK didn't wake up all night. she usually wakes up crying , SWIPPER NO SWIPPIN(from dora). Well enough for now I have to get ready for work, I could talk about KK for hours, and would rather stay home with KK today BUT I have to work so I will close for now. Continue praying for KK. We pray that her potassium comes up and she will eat all the food her body needs to heal.

We pray for a full and complete healing for her from her head

down to her toes. AMEN.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

My mom has been on dialysis as she has no kidney function at all. shes been on for four yrs which i hear after two yrs it doesent work anymore. she is 82 yrs old. she was admitted to the hospital last night as she couldnt breathe. they thought she had pneumonia but when i called this morning they said her lungs were clear and it wasnt congestive heart failure. so theyre edging toward the dialysis not working and filling her up with fluid. pray for her please. shes

&quot;Please Pray with me&quot;

Dear Lord Jesus,

You are the great friend of the sick and You healed them while

You were on earth. I ask that You heal, protect and have mercy on these children and their families, and everyone who needs Your healing touch. Grant them Your healing power, Dear Lord, and

comfort them in their affliction. Come Holy Spirit, strengthen them

so that they may find renewed health, both in body and spirit.

My Dear Jesus, Your coming on earth was like a new dawn over a world of darkness: the blind saw, the lame walked again, the sick were healed and even the dead were raised to life. Come again into the lives of everyone here and heal the wounds of their broken hearts. Come again to all who are sick or depressed and fill their lives with hope and peace. Come again to us, as we call on Your Holy Name so that we too, may receive Your help and healing grace. YOU, my Lord, are aware of all of these needs and of the burdens that are causing them great suffering, physically, emotionally, spiritually or financially.

Father, I bring up to You, each and everyone and each and

every prayer warrior and their families. I ask that You keep

them all, in Your most loving and gentle care and grant

them, much good health, peace, love and joy.
We also pray for President Bush and his family, our soldiers

and their families, for the people of Iraq, for their safety and for the safety of everyone in these United States and for all those affected by terrorism, their family members and friends and for all who work to eliminate terrorism and bring about world peace. We pray for a deep and profound respect for life in all of its forms, in all of its stages.

We pray for one another, for those who have asked our
prayers and for those who need our prayers the most.
Father, in Your mercy, hear our prayers! AMEN!

Today's Verse
December 10, 2007

Verse:

The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. John 1:14 NIV

Thoughts:

Jesus is God's message. It wasn't a message contained in a book or given in a vision, or revealed on a mountain to only a watchful few. No, God's message was human flesh, bone, and blood. God's message came and lived among us. He faced our hardship, got our dirt between his toes, felt our disappointments, struggled with our temptations, suffered our treachery, and bled our blood. Yet living in our world, God's message brought us more than truth; he delivered us from death by God's grace..

Prayer:

Almighty God, thank you for speaking in the past through your prophets. Thank you for inspiring godly men to give us your Scripture. Thank you for making the proclamation of your Word powerful today through the convicting work of the Holy Spirit. May I hear your truth in each of these areas. Most of all, Father, I praise you for speaking your clearest, most profound, and most accessible message in Jesus. Because of Jesus, I know you love me, I know you have cleansed me, and I know I will share heaven with you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart and may my gratitude be seen in the quality and character displayed in my life. In the name of Jesus. Amen.

Messages in this topic (1) 8. THE FIRST REQUIREMENT OF MINISTRY Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Mon Dec 10, 2007 11:20 am (PST) The First Requirement of Ministry
Joel 1:9
The priests are in mourning, those who minister before the Lord.

The first requirement for being used by God in the life of others is to mourn on their behalf. We must identify with their pain and suffering. Each of us must be broken for others first.

In order to be fully used by God in the marketplace, we need to understand what breaks God's heart. When we understand what breaks God's heart, we are able to mourn on behalf of a grieving person, or a nation we are called to serve. What breaks God's heart? When we begin to answer this question, we begin the first step to becoming instruments of change for those things that are important to God. Perhaps it is an overemphasis in our own talent and abilities, or lack of complete trust in Jesus. Perhaps it is the lack of respect for human life that leads to the killing of innocent babies. Perhaps it is the deceit and pride that often rule the marketplace of commerce. Or perhaps it is the strife and divisions among His own Body that grieve Him most. When we begin to mourn over our own sins in these areas, God begins to use us as instruments of righteousness to affect these things. It was only when God let me see my own sins in the marketplace and how they broke His heart that I began to be an instrument for His purposes.

Today, ask God to show you what things in your world are breaking His heart. Then see how He might want you to be the priest to affect for Him. The first step is identification with what breaks God's heart.

Posted by: &quot;God Loves Rich Nicholas&quot; worldprayer2004@yahoo.co.uk worldprayer2004 Mon Dec 10, 2007 11:39 am (PST) The day of vengeance of our God shall come with a mighty delivering power and shall be released under the feet of the righteous of Israel--dancing upon the head of injustice, breaking the shackles of mourning and grieving.

YHVH is Rising as the GREAT KING of JUSTICE for the OPPRESSED of the EARTH

The Great Shepherd of Israel will protect and maintain his sheep

Dominion and awe belong to YHVH. Job 25:2

&quot;As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain. For He says, 'In the time of My favour I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.' I tell you now is the time of God's favour, now is the day of salvation.&quot;
2 Corinthians 6:1-2

&quot;We are entering days of awe.&quot; God's awe will render us incapable of operating in anything other than His Holy Spirit. His glory and awe will sweep us off our feet, and at times, we may not be able to speak. His awe will usher in His dominion--

His Kingdom reign and rule in our lives and that of the nations of the earth.

&quot;But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.&quot; Genesis 45:7

Psalm 2--Foundation for Prophecy to the Nations

it is imperative that we see the nations in the context of the Kingship of Christ. Psalm 2 to ground our teaching.

&quot;Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against His Anointed One. 'Let us break their chains,' they say, 'and throw off their fetters.'&quot; Psalm 2:1-3
These introductory verses begin to reveal the context of the nations in respect to Jesus Christ as King over the entire Universe. In other words, compared to King Jesus, the rulers and kings of the earth are as nothing!
Jesus is the only One with true authority to break the chains of oppression and bondage in the nations (see Isaiah 9:1-8).
When prophesying into nations, we must therefore acknowledge the:
• Context of the nations to Christ--they are under His rulership.
• Consistency of God in His Kingship.
• Character of God in His Kingship--God's Governmental authority, compassion, mercy and grace.
In this introductory part of Scripture, we see Christ revealed as:
• King.
• Messiah. (&quot;Anointed One&quot; is a Scriptural link to John 1:41, &quot;We have found the Messiah, that is the Christ.&quot;)
These few verses call us to:
• Vertical focus in worship and adoration to the King of kings, Who is seated on the Throne of Grace.

• Fear of the Lord and reverential awe.
Once we have the vertical focus of our hearts in right alignment, we are then postured appropriately for horizontal dispersal on the earth of what we receive in revelatory form from our Heavenly Father. In other words, we are ready to prophesy.
Set Your Heart in Alignment with Heaven--Proclaim the Decree of the Lord
Before one can prophesy, one must &quot;desire to prophesy!&quot; (see 1 Corinthians 14:1). To proclaim, pray and prophesy God's decrees, it is necessary to first:
• Align ourselves with Heaven here on earth--by worshipful posture, giving God His rightful place, and by exercising faith to hear and speak God's heart for the nations.
• Surrender and display a willingness to obey and speak for God when He tells us, in the manner He instructs us to share.
A &quot;decree&quot; may be described as an official order issued by a ruler or authority that has the force of law; a judgment or decision of certain law courts.
The Key of Sonship and Revelatory Intimacy
&quot;He said to me, 'You are My son; today I have become your Father.

Ask of Me and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. You will rule them with an iron scepter, you will dash them to pieces like pottery.&quot; Psalm 2:7-9

Sonship and our understanding of this Kingdom relational reality are crucial if we are to prophecy into the nations (see Romans 8; John 15). In the context of Psalm 2, these verses speak of Jesus as the One to Whom the nations are given to Him as an inheritance by the Father.

Jesus is our High Priest and Mediator of the New Covenant of Grace. As a holy priesthood, we are called to carry the nations before God's Throne and to intercede and prophesy from a place of mercy and holiness.
Jesus has Authority Over All Nations--It's His Inheritance

When we view the nations in the context of Jesus' Kingship, we won't have a problem prophesying! Once we understand we are sons, then we will also accept that we have a &quot;royal inheritance!&quot; We are ambassadors on the earth ushering in our Heavenly Father's Kingdom through acts of loving kindness, prayers, praise, worship and prophecy.
• The nations belong to Jesus, Who is supreme over all--the Father gave them to His Son.
• We must begin to see the nations through the eyes of our FATHER and accept His authority over all things created. When we begin to receive a revelation of the authority of Jesus Christ, we rise up in faith, desiring to see our King take His rightful position and His Throne of Grace be established in all the earth.
• We must be ones who are under authority before God can release His authority through us. That means we need good relational accountability in our lives, church family and ministry.
Through Sonship, We are Heirs and Co-heirs with Christ
• When we see the context of our sonship in relation to inheritance, we won't have a problem prophesying! The nations belong to Jesus. As we release God's prophetic decrees, we cause the spiritual atmosphere to change, causing the earth to align itself with the will of Heaven.

&quot;Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned you rulers of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for His wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.&quot; Psalm 2:10-12
The final three verses in Psalm 2:10-12 reveal:
• Focus--we prophesy from a place of relationship with the Son; we prophesy as servants of God; we prophesy from worship and fear of the Lord; we prophesy as priests under a kingly anointing. Revelation 1:5-6 declares, &quot;and from Jesus Christ, Who is the faithful Witness, the Firstborn from the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him Who loves us and has freed us from our sins by His Blood, and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve His God and Father--to Him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen!&quot;

&quot;NATIONS WATCH!

Vision for Lagos, Nigeria
I see an angel with a sword poised over Lagos, and I hear the Spirit of the Lord say, &quot;It is a delivering sword. It is both a sword of mercy and a sword of judgment.&quot; The Lord says, &quot;I am going to expose that which is masquerading under a false and counterfeit anointing and Lagos will experience a 'dirge' until it acknowledges the pure prophetic Voice of the Holy Spirit.&quot;

I see the angel visiting a courtroom and he splits a

judge's gavel in two as the sword is brought down in the courtroom. I see a division coming to Lagos--a division between what is soul and what is spirit, and the Lord is bringing &quot;justice&quot; to those who have long been denied it.

I see the angel standing poised in business meetings where high-powered men and women are convening, although he has not yet executed the sword of the Lord. There is time for the business community of Lagos to turn and experience God's abundant blessing.

&quot;Lagos is both a watching and a watchman city for Nigeria. Nigeria is a gatekeeper's nation for Africa, and Africa is a gateway continent for the world.&quot; Amen. For further study read Acts 2 and Habakkuk).

The day of vengeance of our God shall come with mighty delivering power and shall be released under the feet of the righteous of Israel--dancing upon the head of injustice, breaking the shackles of mourning and grieving.

&quot;He has sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives, and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion--to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.&quot; Isaiah 61:1-3

Uganda, Africa- Children are running out of the fire--to safety (they are naked), for God is rising as the King of Justice for the oppressed children of the earth. The fire is a two-fold fire from Heaven--speaking of judgment (particularly against crimes of humanity towards children), but it also speaks of the fire of God falling in holiness and revival. Although there are rebel factions operating in Uganda in the north/northwest regions, there are also a number of precious believing churches who are experiencing God's glory presence. Uganda is a holy heartbeat away from revival.

KINGDOM GATEKEEPERS
© Morris Ruddick
There is an uncovering underway. An uncovering and unveiling of gateways that heretofore have been hidden or otherwise shrouded. Gateways that will provide passage into a new dimension in the operation of God's Kingdom. Gateways serving in the release of God's throne-room initiatives for this era. Gateways accessing the world's systems.
While there is a need to recognize and understand the function of these gates; it is the emerging role and calling of an unusual group of gatekeepers that needs to be clearly discerned, as the Lord releases them into their pivotal functions. While gates are a means of access and a means to control access, the gatekeepers are those entrusted with the keys.
In Matthew 16:19 Jesus said &quot;I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of God. Whatever you lock on earth will be locked in heaven, and whatever you open on earth will be opened in heaven.&quot; The gates of Hell will not prevail against the gatekeepers entrusted with the keys.
Gatekeepers are entrusted ones. They are mature, seasoned servants of the Lord. Sold out to the Spirit of Truth. Like Samuel, none of their words fall to the ground. Like King David, they are men and women after God's own heart. They are warriors who flow in His presence and hear His voice with great clarity. Their obedience is such that they will be among those described in Revelations as loving not their own lives unto death. Their eye is single, with their hearts fixed on the Lord's agendas. They have been tested by fire. From a human stance, they are broken; but spiritually they are as fortified walls of bronze. They are steadfast, stable and utterly reliable. They serve and support with dependability those they are called to stand along side. Their prophetic giftings and insights are always balanced with wisdom and compassion. They operate with a razor-sharp discernment that sees deeply into situations and people. They are men and women of God entrusted with great
authority, who are decisive and know what to do in the functions they serve.
Since the time that the Lord spoke to Peter and entrusted him with the keys to build the Church, there have been gates and gatekeepers. But what is emerging in our era are significant, heretofore unseen, untapped, strategic-level gates; and a chosen group of trusted, proven gatekeepers. Gates and gatekeepers commensurate with the day of His power we are entering. Gates and gatekeepers aligned for the Throne-room agendas they will serve. Gates advancing God's Kingdom. Gatekeepers operating with a Kingdom perspective.

Let's give keen focus to interceding:
* For the activation and mobilization of today's Kingdom gatekeepers.
* For the wisdom for these gatekeepers to understand and operate within the boundaries of their individual spheres of authority.
* For the balance and understanding required between the operation of individual versus corporate gatekeeper initiatives.
* For an unmasking of the enemy's gateway diversion strategies; and an exposure of the counterfeit gatekeepers and those operating outside their spheres of authority whose activities serve to distract and undermine the work of the genuine gatekeepers.
* For an uncovering, unveiling and identification of the enemy-held gateways and strongholds whose acquisition will serve to undergird God's throne-room agendas for this day.
* For a release of greater spiritual authority for those serving as the gatekeepers guarding Kingdom strongholds, as well as those penetrating enemy-held seats of power and strongholds.
* For discernment and wisdom to implement the strategies required for guarding and controlling access at the gates; repossessing the gates and seats of power usurped by the enemy; operating the Kingdom keys; and advancing the Kingdom.
* For divinely orchestrated alignment, coordination, clarity of purpose, and operational precision among the Kingdom gatekeepers entrusted with the keys.
* For the mobilizing of an impenetrable prayer shield around today's Kingdom gatekeepers and for a release of God's miracle-working power and new levels of angelic support to intervene on behalf of those serving as Kingdom gatekeepers.
KINGDOM GATEKEEPERS AND SPHERES OF AUTHORITY
Gatekeepers wield authority. Gates are places of authority. The gatekeeper --- the one entrusted with the keys --- has an authority that will not be challenged or held back by what the scripture refers to as &quot;the gates of hell.&quot; The Amplified Version (Matthew 16) spells it out this way: &quot;the powers of the infernal region shall not overpower it --- or be strong to its detriment, or hold out against it.&quot;
There are different types of gatekeepers with different levels of authority. The boundaries of individual authority levels need to be recognized and approached with care. 2 Corinthians 10:13 speaks of the sphere of authority we've been appointed to. Genuine gatekeepers understand and operate within the boundaries of their individual appointed spheres. This understanding is no minor thing. Jude 1 speaks of the angels who did not stay within the limits of authority God gave them, but left the place where they belonged --- and now await in outer darkness for their judgment.
The individual sphere of authority is enlarged and greatly enhanced by the corporate sphere. We need to be connected and flowing in our corporate spheres, as we simultaneously and in concert operate within our individual spheres. This is especially significant in the functions served by a uniquely-called group best described as today's Kingdom gatekeepers.
Kingdom gatekeepers serve a role that extends beyond the traditional operation of today's Church. Kingdom gatekeepers operate within the heart of the marketplace --- in business, government, technology, communications and the media --- in spheres of influence normally accepted as the enemy's camp. But allowing these spheres to be remain under the enemy's control has never been God's intention.
Today's Kingdom gatekeepers frequently will be found working in conjunction with Kingdom pioneers --- those serving to pave the way for new agendas the Lord is releasing. Those penetrating the marketplace systems of this world and restoring that which has been stolen to God's Kingdom.
But there are some strategic-level gatekeepers who will serve as both pioneers and gatekeepers.

Joseph was a pioneer-gatekeeper extraodinaire, who opened the way --- and then stood at the gates --- and then administrated the resources and power held by Egypt in the furtherance of God's purposes for His people.

There's a balance required between the individual versus the corporate role of Kingdom gatekeepers. There are those who get labeled as &quot;loose cannons&quot; despite what might reflect some unusual anointings. These are misguided believers who operate independently and out of context to the timing of, or simply miss what the Spirit of the Lord is doing. Loose cannons should not be confused with the independence required of pioneer-gatekeepers who pave the way for new agendas. There are also those who operate in context, but because of the focus of their personal agendas, they create distortions and misdirection for God's agendas. On the other hand, there are those whose corporate conformance is such that they miss the essentials associated with their own callings.
The gatekeeper called to the strategic levels of this era will operate strongly in their individual sphere, while simultaneously being in sync with the flow of what the Lord is doing in the corporate sphere of their calling. The corporate calling is not an organizational thing, so much as the recognition of what the Lord is doing on a broad scale, concurrently across and within many different groups.
The flow of the corporate gatekeeper functions will not diffuse the role of the individual gatekeeper, but instead will direct, strengthen, and provide needed context to enable the Spirit of the Lord to orchestrate His agendas in fullness.

The Body is indeed coming together in unity. As it does, there will be a diffusion of the enemy's webs of distraction-tactics targeting Kingdom gatekeepers. Infiltrators, counterfeits, phonies, the self-serving and those otherwise operating under delusions of grandeur are being exposed and removed.

The Body is rapidly transitioning into an offensive posture and gaining strength, as the Lord releases the strategies to possess the gates of the enemy and advance His Kingdom.
Understanding the sphere and level of authority, and the corporate context is crucial to operating so that the gates of Hell will not prevail against those entrusted with the keys.
IDENTIFYING ENEMY AND WORLD SYSTEM GATEWAYS
Heretofore, when God's people have come within proximity of the enemy's gates, the result would be a flurry of smokescreens, entanglements, distractions and diversions. Unfortunately, there's been a preoccupation with battling the enemy's gatekeepers, while too often missing the gates. But as the Body approaches increasingly higher levels of unity and relationally, their knowledge of the Lord --- the masking of the enemy-guarded gates is being dispersed. We have entered an era that will be marked with God's people identifying and penetrating the gates accessing marketplace systems and resources.
With the penetration of the enemy-guarded gates will come greater fortification of the gates to the Kingdom; as well as the role of the Kingdom gatekeepers.
The Josephs and Daniels of our day are gatekeepers whose callings are in the heart of what we refer to as the world's systems. Business, government, technology, communications and the media. These areas are the means of access --- the gateways into the resources and seats of power of this world. Resources and power that will be used to extend God's love to the hungry, afflicted and oppressed. Resources and power that are being restored and redirected for Kingdom purposes as we approach the final harvest. Restored through entrusted Kingdom gatekeepers.
The world's system as it now exists, is a mere shadow and perversion of God's plans and intentions formed long ago for His people. Scripture clearly indicates that the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. It is the Lord Who owns the cattle on a thousand hills. Individual gatekeepers called by God have periodically gained access in the past into the arena encompassed by what rightfully belongs to God --- into the resources and seats of power of this world. But it's been sporadic, and the exception. We are now entering an era whereby companies of Kingdom gatekeepers will operate in concert to open gates into seats of power previously deemed beyond the scope of the possible for the people of God.
STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, AUTHORITY AND DOMINION
It also needs to be recognized that the Lord appoints gatekeepers from not only among His people, but from persons of the world in positions of authority, who He knows will be unwavering in the accomplishment of His purposes.

Cyrus was a non-believing King, who the Lord used mightily in opening gateways for His people: Isaiah 45 outlines what the Lord has to say about Cyrus: &quot;Cyrus, His anointed one, whose right hand He will empower. Before him, mighty kings will be paralyzed with fear. Their fortress gates will be opened, never again to shut against him.

This is what the LORD says: &quot;I will go before you, Cyrus, and level the mountains. I will smash down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron. I will give you the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, the LORD, am the God of Israel. For Jacob My servant's sake, and Israel My elect, I have even called you by your name; I have named you, though you have not known Me. I am the LORD, and there is no other; there is no God besides Me. I will gird you, though you have not known Me.&quot; Cyrus was a gatekeeper into the world's resources and seats of authority needed to bring about restoration and empowerment for God's people.
What is significant about the Cyruses is that they will have a recognition of genuine dominion and will not hesitate to use their authority to realign dominions as they should be.
GATEWAYS TO SEATS OF POWER AND STRONGHOLDS
Gates traditionally have served as a place where people in authority gather within fortresses, cities, dwellings for refuge and business, and appointed places of worship. Cities and dwellings for refuge and business: places of authority and rule. Places where decisions and judgment occur. Places for in-gatherings of those with common purposes and political unity. These are the foundations for empires. They are seats of power.
The marketplaces of today's world are seats of power. Cities contain the pulse of these marketplaces. It is through the marketplace mechanisms --- business, technology. communications, media --- that lives are influenced and impacted for eternity. The marketplace provides gateways into the seats of power that control the destinies of millions and millions of souls. Their dominion and rule determines whether they are used for good or for evil. It was at the city of Babel that the Lord undermined the purposes of those building this dominion, by confusing their language. Revelation 17 speaks of the great city that rules over the kings of the earth. But it was Joseph, as administrator over Egypt, who reached out to the hungry and afflicted, while averting disaster and caring for God's covenant people.
Gates are not only a means of control and access, they provide protection and a place of observation. II Samuel 18 speaks of the chambers over the gates. The chambers over the gates provide a place of safety for those in authority with a view of distant things approaching.
Gatekeepers guard and provide access to strongholds. There is a mind-set within the Body that tends to view strongholds as only something that the enemy has. That is a deception. The dictionary defines &quot;stronghold&quot; as 1. A fortified place or a fortress. 2.a. A place of survival or refuge. b. An area dominated or occupied by a special group or distinguished by a special quality: a stronghold of democracy. The Body indeed has fortified places that are as headquarter centers, where warriors are trained, replenished and sent out. The Body also has safe places and places of refuge --- that are closer to the battle lines and are not obvious to the enemy; that its warriors can enter while on assignment.
STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS OF GATEWAYS AND GATEKEEPERS
We need some fresh mind-sets that will give us greater clarity in defining the strongholds we are penetrating and taking dominion of. A stronghold is something worth conquering. We need to view strongholds as seats of power, with the potential to serve the Lord's purposes, once they are conquered.
The Body has far too long confused enemy strongholds with enemy gatekeepers. We have too frequently become enmeshed with enemy gatekeepers without taking dominion of and sometimes not even clearly identifying the stronghold. A stronghold is a place, an area, or a particular group of people, or a distinguishing quality that brings together a particular group of people. Mammon, for example, is a high-level gatekeeper trying to protect a stronghold.
The enemy loves attention. If he can keep us focused on doing battle with his gatekeepers, we will never conquer the strongholds. And no doubt there will be battles as the Kingdom of God advances and the violent take it by force. But there are also times, when the enemy's gatekeepers can simply be bypassed, by Kingdom gatekeepers --- because they hold the keys. The keys with the authority to open the gates.
Bypass strategies will accelerate the accomplishment the Lord's purposes. We are in an era in which the Lord's actions will be marked by the word &quot;suddenly.&quot; There will be instances in which demon gatekeepers will be bypassed as they are paralyzed with fear, simply because of the Presence of the Lord and the authority resident within the Kingdom gatekeeper. And there will be times when entrance into enemy-guarded strongholds will be made by means of alliances established with the Cyruses and Pharaohs of this era.
In summary, God's strongholds are places where His people partake. The enemy's strongholds are places God's people plunder and gain dominion.
God's gatekeepers guard and control entrance into His strongholds. God's gatekeepers also identify, open the gateways and provide access to gain dominion of enemy-held strongholds. Those entrusted with the keys will guard access to Kingdom strongholds; and unlock access to plunder enemy seats of power --- to bring restoration; what is needed in building the Kingdom; and to release God's initiatives for this hour.
And again, the Word tells us that the enemy cannot overpower; be strong to its detriment, or hold out against those with the keys --- those with gatekeeper authority operating within their sphere.
As the Lord brings His Body together, His dominion will penetrate and utilize the systems of this world for His purposes. As in the days of old; as in the days of Joseph and Daniel; the Lord Almighty, the King of Kings ...
