There would have still been a Hillary Rodham in politics, probably
seeking office
in Illinois. One of the recent Hillary bios (&quot;A Woman In Charge&quot; by
Woodward,
haven't read it) posits that she would have had a political career
even without
Bill.

It has been suggested that the Clinton impeachment appealed to many
Southern Congressmen because of their disapproval of Clinton marrying
a
&quot;Yankee&quot; rather than a nice Southern gal. Is it possible that a
Clinton who's
married to some ex-beauty queen from Arkansas or one of the
neighboring
states with a traditional Southern personality/style would not be as
polarizing
to Southron Republicans?

Best,
Stan B.
