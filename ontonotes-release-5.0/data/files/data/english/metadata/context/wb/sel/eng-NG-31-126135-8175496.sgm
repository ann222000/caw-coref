Hello everyone, this is my first post here, and I hope not the last. I
*will* be asking for advice on scientific consequences of unscientific
(parascientific, really) premises; my reasons for doing so shall
remain a mystery so as not to stir gratuitous controversy. I promise
fun, though.

The overall idea is a generational fantasy epic with a sci-fi twist. I
have three parts planned, in chronological order, and I'm still
considering which would be the most interesting to do first (... or
the easiest of the bunch to sell as a stand-alone work). In this post
I will be discussing tome three, where the epic takes to
interplanetary space.

At the end of part two, a coalition of human nations nominally &quot;wins&quot;
the war against the demon nation that poured out of a hellmouth a
century before (read: &quot;land-based alien invasion&quot;). The head nation
initiates a slow and tedious annihilation campaign to erase the demon
cities still standing, justified by nebulous xenophobic doctrine. One
of their weapons (arguably, THE weapon) in this campaign is the
airship &quot;São Paulo&quot; (temporary name), the most spectacular display of
overengineering I could conceive of with 50s-era-technology-plus-magic
_and_ the main topic I will be discussing in this post.

The idea is I toss around some random details about it (without giving
away too much), and you'll tell me if anything sounds incredibly
wrong. Deal?

Weighing in at a little below 2 million tons, airship São Paulo is the
bastard son of a threesome between an overturned battleship, an
armored blimp and an aircraft carrier, scaled up to supertanker
proportions. 600 meters long, 70 wide, for a complement of over 20000
men and a maximum cargo allowance of 500000 tons (I estimated mass,
cargo space and crew size by scaling up real-world wet ship designs -
the deadweight is three times the like-sized supertanker Knock Nevis,
for instance), it was apparently designed to engage city-sized targets
by smothering them in a warm blanket of ordnance

The thing is built in part like an upside-down building because its
reactionless drive is mounted in-belly above the center of gravity
(all around it, in fact... but more on that later), and it looks and
feels a little like a building, too, with a thick outer skin made of
layered steel, concrete and water tanks (which double as balancing
ballast). Since in air it also _handles_ a lot like a building,
despite a futile attempt at an aerodynamic shape, it was designed with
an air-tight hull below the armored skin, so that it could operate
outside the atmosphere for long-distance travel. The fact that it has
no landing carriage can make it a necessity to &quot;park&quot; it in orbit,
too, in case it cannot reach one of its dedicated docks (in a _real_
emergency, it is believed to be waterproof enough to be safely kept
underwater for a while. Nobody bothered estimating the crush depth,
because, seriously, duh. Dunking my trillion-dollar biscuit in the
milkbowl &quot;for science&quot;? you first)

Strategists and engineers agree in considering it a doomed, idiotic,
prohibitively expensive design with little practical application,
already obsoleted by saner designs and geopolitics by the time it was
finally fielded... then again, the thing can gobble down a half
million tons, drag its entire support fleet in tow, operate outside
the atmosphere and keep a constant acceleration of 1g virtually
forever (that's how it stays afloat, of course), so it can't be _all_
bad -surely somebody will think of something. They do the math, and at
the &quot;end&quot; of the war the São Paulo is thus repurposed as an
interplanetary exploration vessel

The reactionless drive: it does not violate conservation of momentum
because it does not use energy (would you keep down the screaming?
sheesh). The gimmick is that it's based on the young theory of &quot;meta-
materiality&quot; (i.e. &quot;magic&quot;), exploiting previously unknown geometrical
properties of &quot;reality&quot;. The fancy theories can only produce very
crude technology, though - the &quot;pullor&quot; that lugs the São Paulo around
is a big mean sledgehammer of a design that cannot be scaled down or
up significantly. The pullor is (how conveniently) a closely-guarded
military secret, mainly because it's the first breakthrough in magical
technology in millenia during which the discipline was, essentially, a
branch of archeology, but also for more sinister implications, as the
kind of magic behind it was believed to only affect energy, and
everybody is at a loss as how, exactly, could it act directly on mass
as well (dun-dun-duuun). Even the technobabble to justify a reality-
bending technology is beyond me, so I try to consider the engineering
aspect only (as for you all, pretend that every time a pullor
manufactures kinetic energy from nowhere, a random massive object
somewhere in the universe mysteriously decelerates). As for the
economic aspect, I have a couple ideas on what it could consume in
place of fuel

The engineering aspects of the pullor: it's composed of a few central
units that can &quot;create velocity vectors&quot; and apply them to several
dummies, huge spheres of solid metal (not just any metal, but I have
yet to decide what makes a metal &quot;magical&quot; or not) that act like the
ring of a dog's collar to let the velocity vectors drag the ship
around like leashes (needless to say, I realize the &quot;collar&quot; and the
&quot;dog&quot; must be built though enough or the poor &quot;fleas&quot; will get a
mouthful of vacuum). I imagine there need to be several dummies and
that they need to be &quot;before&quot; the center of mass in the direction of
movement, for stability. Of course the pullor needs to at least impart
a constant acceleration of 1 g to let the big metal turd float without
orbiting, and allow for generous amounts of extra acceleration for
maneuvers (I have &quot;preallocated&quot; 3 g, is that too much?).

A sustained 1 g comes in real handy for outer space, as you get free
artificial gravity during long-distance travel. When you're halfway
through everyone straps down, the big mofo spins half-circle around
its longitudinal axis, and uses the pullor to go -1 g and keep the
artificial gravity going; if my quick calculations aren't way off,
this should let you get to Mars in a matter of days, without ever
going over 0.3% c (this can work great for drama, as I can make the
first mission look deceptively easy). The pullor is obviously used to
power a gigantic crankshaft electric generator that keeps the fat lady
singing, because with that much &quot;free&quot; kinetic energy it'd be a crime
not to exploit it some. I was considering flywheels for storage, are
they viable to the cyclopic scales in question, without resorting to
exotic materials?

(the whole setup is considered a bit &quot;quaint&quot; by scientists, though,
who envision the eventual development of a magical machine to produce
electric potential directly. Similary, engineers hope the flimsy
radiators can be replaced with magical &quot;heat wells&quot; ASAP. In a typical
display of short-sightedness, everyone is so awed by the image of
specialized building-sized devices to appreciate the idea of magical
appliances drawing from a magical &quot;power grid&quot;)

There is no magical technology in the São Paulo other than the pullor
(if we exclude the odd antique in possession of some crewmen). You can
now stop holding your breath.

Payload and supplies: I have tried all the &quot;hard-and-fast&quot; formulas on
Project Rho, and let me tell you: being able to move 500000 tons
around the solar system with total impunity makes things
_considerably_ easier. I can barely fill 1500 tons with crew, air,
water and hydroponics, and filling the rest of the cargo hold with
canned food you get a little over _20 years_ of survival. And by
removing part of the armament (like some of the ridicolously oversize
110 cm gun turrets and related magazines) and using strap-on external
storage, I bet you can get even more cargo space, and especially much
more crew accomodation space. Logistically, I figure I got my ass
covered.

Make no mistake, though: the São Paulo is a spaceship purely by chance
and brute force. It was created by a world that ignores everything
about relativity and was propelled into space age prematurely by
stumbling on &quot;puller&quot; technology and designing an oversize submarine
around it.

The answer I'm interested the most in is, in fact, whether these poor,
damned fools would even have a chance; Project Rho's &quot;Atomic Rocket&quot;
manual only goes as far as stating that sliding rules, tabulated
functions and electro-mechanical computers would be workable
navigation tools in space, but it always assumes knowledge of
relativity. What mysterious phenomenons would my industrial-age
spacefarers encounter during their early trials-at-space? And could
they have radio and some crude form of radar without relativity? What
deadly perils could they anticipate, and what could they not? Do state-
of-the-art optical rangefinders make sense in space, or will the
delicate antiques just serve as crystal earrings for the big lady?

(And finally: is there any merit to the use of genius dolphins in the
Star Trek universe as space navigation experts? And how would dolphins
cope with high g's? better or worse than hairless apes? I need to know
how outlandish my outlandish ideas are)

Arrrgh! curse nautical terms in foreign languages! curse contradictory

halving the figures because I'm rather too fond of tonnage in the

solid lead I'm OK with. And whoever speaks word about it gets a

Please, please, bear with me here. &quot;Giant airship&quot; is a contractual
obligation for fantasy authors. Appreciate that I'm not trying to pull
too many parascientific principles out of my ass, and help me here
with these outer space hazards, would you?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From a cursory research, I'm now pretty sure that you can well have
">

radio and radar without any knowledge of relativity: &quot;it's just
waves&quot;. Radioactivity is a natural phenomenon that occurs everywhere
on ground level, all the time, and once you have electricity you are
going to pretty much stumble into it somehow. Chemistry and newtonian
mechanics alone can bring you very close to atomic theory. Electricity
sooner or later gives you vacuum tubes, and theories on electrons;
relatively simple experiments reveal electrons are lighter than
hydrogen atoms, thus subatomic theory is born. Radioactive bombardment
experiments will reveal there is a lot of empty space between the
parts of an atom. With some luck and basic newtonian mechanics you
discover isotopes. It's not a big stretch from there to discover all
atoms seem to be made of whole multiples of electrons and hydrogen
ions, and there you have nuclear theory. To go beyond that, you need
quantum theory, which I think can be reasonably assumed to be a big
enough rats nest to require extraordinary individuals and big strokes
of luck - altough in a world with rigorous scientific theories on the
nature of magic and metaphysics, the idea that we are &quot;made of&quot;
probability functions will probably be more readily accepted

All in all, this means they should be somewhat well-prepared for the
high energy perils of outer space. The São Paulo already has a layered
armor of steel plates, water tanks and concrete walls: those by
themselves should give pretty good radiation/cosmic ray shielding

Now let's see what lack-of-Einstein gets us. No photoelectric theory,
so some big confusion as to the nature of energy and light as an
energy carrier; they can, however, reach the same conclusions in a
somewhat roundabout way, through their research on metamateriality;
until then, no laser.

No model of Brownian motion, so atoms aren't believed to be &quot;real&quot;
yet; as noted before, though, they have theories on the nature of
reality itself, so they would definitely keep their pants on at the
news; not sure of the non-philosophical implications here.

No special relativity, and this seems to be a pretty big breakthrough;
my backwards podunks hence still believe in luminiferous aether, and
are still baffled by its confusing properties. Still, outer-space São
Paulo seems the perfect laboratory to discover that light has no
inertia and a fixed velocity; on the longest travels, they will
invariably begin noticing extra inertial mass coming from nowhere (or
maybe velocity affects the pullor as well, perhaps *dropping* its
output as it increases)

No mass-energy equivalence, and no reason to go looking for it,
either; altough further study in the nature of magic will eventually
reveal it, clear as day, and then things will get interesting and
magic study will probably get sidelined for ZOMG BOMBS (it must be
noted they do have bombs of the ZOMG quality, altough they are
antiques that cannot be reproduced or even dismantled).

General relativity: one of those &quot;DUH&quot; phenomenons that you literally
have been measuring since forever but never realized; let's assume
that somebody will, by chance or divine inspiration, eventually look
into a telescope during a solar eclipse; until then, they are going to
observe and measure time dilation and redshift, and not know what to
make of it.

I'm sure I'm underestimating the implications of ignorance of
relativity and quantum theory, though. Anyone can fill me in?

Why?

A cylinder 70 m wide and 600 m long has a volume in my estimates of
about 2,3 millions of cubic metres. Since the weight is under 2

It woud float deep, with 50 m draft or so. In emergency, it might mean
alighting in open sea and having waves break over the 20 m or so
overwater part. In a smaller emergency, it might mean picking a
suitable deep lake or fiord as alternative to a dedicated dock.

If it is to float, then it should not leak at its 50 m draught.

But you might use the pullor to press the ship below water, so as to
be concealed from overwater navies and planes...

Scaling down is a restriction. Scaling up - how accurately can the
pullor maneuver, e. g. in docking? You might consider building a ship
with more than one pullor.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Of course the pullor needs to at least impart

Shuttles limit acceleration to 3 g for passenger comfort. Large

&gt; Payload and supplies: I have tried all the &quot;hard-and-fast&quot; formulas on

&gt; _considerably_ easier. I can barely fill 1500 tons with crew, air,
&gt; water and hydroponics, and filling the rest of the cargo hold with
&gt; canned food you get a little over _20 years_ of survival.
">

My numbers are slightly different. For 20 000 crew, 1500 tons is 75 kg
per head - the weight of crew itself.  We then have 115 cubic metres
of volume per head - meaning about 150 kg of air - and 25 t payload
capacity per head.

Also I suggest that making it elongated is a bad idea. You do not
really need it to be aerodynamic - your thrust overwhelms any drag!.
But you are essentially cantilevered out of a single support point at
the pullor. Unlike a tanker or an airship, which is supported by
buoyancy all along its length, your spaceship would tend to break at
the middle. Mind you, you can deal with it with 1950´s technology. The
Forth Rail Bridge, built in 1890, extended over 200 m out from the
central  pillar, and supports beam spans on both ends, so 300 m
overhang could be doable. But you would spend a lot of structural
steel on it. If what you want is a mobile gun platform, you would do
better to make it wider and shorter, so you do not have to cantilever
so far out f the pullor.

Feasible. It would always be an emergency maneuver, though, since
&quot;water landing&quot; would sink the ventral conning tower and the main

probably traverse far enough to point outside the water - I really
really need to 3D-model the thing). And the flight deck would probably
go underwater as well (really, REALLY need to model it to have a

I happen to agree completely! I envisioned the &quot;saner designs&quot; that

they are romantic like that.

The &quot;pullor&quot; proper is the magical generator of velocity vectors. Each
can generate and orient several at the same time, and they are applied
to the &quot;dummies&quot;, which are passive targets in the whole ordeal, and
essentially act as hooks the airship is suspended from with &quot;invisible

spread the load across several dummies.

Interesting setup!

I wouldn't fret about the unrealistic nature of the reactionless drive,
you're entitled to an unrealistic postulate as long as you handle the
results consistently.

Indeed in general I think you're being a bit too harsh on your
characters. Given free-energy reactionless drive that you can't scale
down, Sao Paulo is fundamentally a sensible design however weird it
looks to us. And if you don't have to worry about mass allowance or zero
g or spending terribly long periods of time in travel, that's all your
big headaches solved in advance. They'll have a much easier time than we
have.

3g is definitely too much for something that big and heavy that wasn't
designed for it. I'd say something like 0.8 - 1.2g as specified range.
Yes, that means it must never _stop_ accelerating or you void the
warranty. Coping with zero g is a nasty problem, or rather hundreds of
nasty problems, none of which an airship would otherwise need to solve.

That means turnaround for deceleration phase on long trip is a slow loop
not stop-and-flip.

It also means no orbit, but orbit doesn't make sense anyway, the whole
point of it is so you can turn off the engine before you run out of
fuel, but in this case you never need to turn off the engine.

And no water, making things immersable in water without breaking is
another design headache. Dock by hovering at zero altitude.

Uplifted dolphins for navigation? Er not really; they wouldn't have any
advantages over humans, and disadvantage of no hands to work the controls.

Relativity isn't a biggie, I think if you're using slide rules for
navigation the relativistic correction at say 0.01 c will be within your
error margin anyway. The general relativity correction for things like
pointing a telescope at the sun during an eclipse will be far too small
to notice unless you were explicitly looking for it.

I'm guessing you'll have problems with induced radiation from ultra high
speed collision with hydrogen atoms and dust particles (shielding
notwithstanding) before you start having problems with relativity.

Quantum mechanics, you don't really start needing for technology before
you start inventing things like transistors and lasers, which these
people aren't up to yet.

But I would have expected them to stumble on both already. e.g. if they
have radar, they know Maxwell's equations and would have noticed their
inconsistency with Newtonian mechanics. What's your reason for not
wanting relativity and QM known in the setting? And what's your
currently planned explanation for why they're not discovered yet?

The USS Enterprise has three onboard (two bottlenose, one orca)
conducting experiments in space maneuvering; they could never be

references (true story!). In my imaginary world, dolphins have been
communicating with humans for ages, they have their own culture and
written historical record, and they have evolved a prehensile multi-
appendix of the tongue (could have gone worse, I could have chosen the
penis... but for one, it's a bit too inconveniently placed). The idea
is to give them their own &quot;little&quot; prototype space shuttles, to study
and develop space maneuvering techniques. Completely unnecessary to
the overall story, just exploring mission objectives. It'd also be a
diplomatic gesture towards the empire of the sea (another story for

Transistors and lasers are QM, not relativity. Honestly, I don't think

Oh. You probably ought to be aware then that, contrary to some popular
science presentations, relativity and atomic energy are quite
independent of each other. (Quantum mechanics is more relevant, but I

If atomic energy is what you don't want, much simpler to just put a stop

General relativity sort of yes, we got lucky with that with Einstein
getting his teeth into it on theoretical grounds, it might have waited a
long time. But special relativity was an idea whose time had come, a
number of people were closing in on it. Quantum mechanics, also, was the
work of many minds. (Ironically, Einstein never did get his Nobel Prizes
for SR and GR; instead he got one for his first work - discovering a key
component of quantum mechanics.)

Fair enough. Then maybe the second generation of spaceships will be
designed to work in 0g so they can park in orbit, coast for the
midsection of a journey etc to save pullor lifespan/cost/etc.

If so, then I predict the third generation will go straight back to the
Sao Paulo model of having to operate the pullor 24x7, once the
staggering cost and operational headaches of doing anything in 0g have
become apparent and people have realized it's actually cheaper to just
run the pullor all the time and avoid the problem. At the end of the day
hardware's cheaper than labor.

It's a pet annoyance of mine.

I've read way too many stories where they've got some kind of magical
drives that can pull 1G (or atleast a significant fraction of it)
continously for year-long trips, but where nevertheless, turning is done
with a very elaborate strap-everything-down, turn-engine-off, turn-180,
restart-engine.

If your engine is capable of pushing continously for 10 years anyway, I
see no plausible reason to turn it off for the short while it takes to
turn around. Even with *very* careful slow turning, I can't imagine
turning taking more than say a single day.

Applying a slight push to start turning, then waiting until turning is
done, then applying a slight push to stop turning would seem to be much
more logical, yet you never see or read about that.

Well, see, the point is precisely that I did not make up a very
specific magical device that made space travel cheap. Space travel is
the gimmick, not the pullor. The development of the pullor is a direct
consequence of previous events. And no physicist knows _why_ magic
works in physics terms, as studying magic is like studying the physics
of a whole another universe; of course the material universe _could_
turn out to be a 10-dimensional cross-section of the 26-dimensional
magical dimension and viceversa, or whatever, but that kind of
breakthrough can wait. And the São Paulo mission could well be the
perfect chance to get a better understanding of it

Various hints on the nature of magic are dropped throughout the
series, while the discipline is refined and the concept of
&quot;metamateriality&quot; introduced (which suggests its hypothetical nature
as an orthogonal &quot;cut&quot; of reality to that provided by physics), so
hopefully I won't need a Basil Exposition moment at any point in the
epic.

Better not be too specific, or the magic loses its magic and I'll end
up doing something stupid and ham-handed like developing an elaborate
metaphor for quantum mechanics and the probabilistic nature of
universe. Magic is not &quot;really&quot; just a misunderstood facet of physics,
and materiality and metamateriality will not be reconciled any time
soon. That seems to be a perfect way to date your work irreparably.
&quot;Invisible wires&quot; is something anyone could readily accept (of course

speak of, I started with some archetipal elements (hellmouth, demon
invasion, a powerful wizard, a forgotten advanced civilization of
ancient), and the thing unfolded on its own by cause/effect, with some
infusions from popular culture and other fantasy works for added
flavor. The São Paulo itself seemed a cheap gimmick even to me, as it
comes very late into part 2 and serves a role that is marginal at best
for the purposes of moving the story forward, until I realized I had
just created a near-perfect spaceship. Who knew I would get this far
starting from the simple image of a wizard who can throw magic balls
of concussive force as his trademark move? (the fact that I love
basking in outrageousness might have helped. Not holding technology in
disdain or distrust like so many fantasy authors do is not a bad plus,
too)

&gt; &gt; suitable deep lake or fiord as alternative to a dedicated dock.

&gt; Feasible. It would always be an emergency maneuver, though, since
&gt; &quot;water landing&quot; would sink the ventral conning tower and the main

carriers, and US lost 1 out of 3. A carrier supported by pullor... if
you can exercise the pullor at 1,1 g, then accelerating up at 0,1 g,
you can rise from 1 km to 17 km in 3 minutes. Meanwhile, an enemy
plane would cover 36 km if it flies at 720 km/h. So, just watch out
for any potential attacks, and you can get out of trouble...

Nitpick: if it's airtight by design, that presumably means its primary

expect there to be a very heavily armored roof, let alone a swing-open

&gt; All in all, this means they should be somewhat well-prepared for the

&gt; No model of Brownian motion, so atoms aren't believed to be &quot;real&quot;

There's a tall assumption. Read up on your basic physics, then reconcile
the following statements.

1. Light has neither mass nor inertia and therefore a constant velocity.
2. Given a change in conductive medium (as for example air versus the
crystal of a well-crafted prism) light can and will bend, or refract,
implying a *slight* (read: really, really *really* tiny)change in velocity.
3. The gravitational lens effect has been demonstrated.

I've been working on that for a number of years now, in the interest of
disproving the red-shift (my thinking calls for a loss of velocity,
something like -.1% in velocity over distances greater than perhaps
100,000 light years), and no soap. The texts most carefully dance around
that subject, as well as the solar wind phenomenon.

Because if you've got a constant acceleration drive and you're

doing a 180 over a day or so is utterly negligible to your overall

How do you figure that ?

Typical everyday glass has a refractive index around 1.5, which means
that the speed of light trough it is 1/1.5 = 67% of the speed in vacuum.

I don't know about you, but I don't think that a speed-reduction of
1/3rd can accurately be described as a &quot;really, really, *really* tiny&quot;
change.

If the speed-change was tiny, then the bending of the lightbeam would be
tiny too, which fails to match everyday experiences.

Everyday glass isn't near the top of the refactive-index list either,
diamond, for example, has an index of aproximately 2.5 and silicon has 4.

Hardly.

Listen, you've been accelerating continously at a significant fraction
of 1G for literally *years*, you're travelling at a large fraction of C.

Which implies that you're going to something that is several lightyears
away.

Whatever you do inside of one day is going to be of no measurable
influence whatsoever, if it *did* matter, which it don't, you could
correct it by pointing your engine 0.01 degree differently than you
otherwise would for the remaining braking. (or by turning 181 degrees,
waiting a bit, and then turning 1 degree back)

And one *day* is very liberal for turning. Keep in mind that we're
talking of a structure that is un-flimsy enough to be able to withstand
both 1G and 0G, which means it needs quite a bit of structural
integrity. With most plausible designs you could probably turn in an
hour rather than a day, 180 degrees flip in 1 hour ain't precisely quick
turning, even supertankers can do that, and they've got pesky water to
deal with.

Your objection is akin to asking what you're going to do about the
problem that the fly flying into your left car-window will prevent you
from arriving at Grandmas by pushing you off course. The answer is, in
principle it will *sligthly*, but in practice the disturbance is so
small that you won't even notice it happening.

With an engine capable of pushing for 1 hour, you don't waste delta-V by
letting the engine run during a flipover-maneuver. With an engine
capable of pushing for *years*, it makes no sense to turn it off for
such a short duration, the risks outweigh the benefits by SEVERAL orders
of magnitude. (what do you do if the period of zero-G dislodges
something in a way that prevents restarting the engine ?)

Maybe. Even then, it would be a *magic* particle, living in an N-
dimensional metamaterial space rather than the M-dimensional material
space our physics studies. &quot;Magic&quot; proper, in fact, is the interaction
(any interaction) between material and metamaterial, material-to-
metamaterial being &quot;casting&quot; and metamaterial-to-material being
&quot;enchantment&quot;. You would be able to detect a &quot;magic particle&quot; only by
observing enchantment happen. And this is a possible reason why my
scientists could waste *ages* trying to explain phenomenons like
quantum mechanics without success: they would automatically assume it
to be a form of enchantment (strictly speaking, it *is*, but I
wouldn't want to see the differential equations for *that*); they'd be
as lost as our string-theorists are in math too high for their own

one ally against others. They have several choices. They can publicly
demand that the program be stopped as wasteful - but then it would be
completed without them. Building a replica would take too much
resources and time. They can prepare to sabotage the carrier. They can
use their workers on the project to prepare to hijack the carrier. Or
they might use their insights to prepare weapons against the carrier.

&gt;&gt;&gt; turning taking more than say a single day.
&gt;&gt; And how do you account for the fact that as soon as you deviate from

&gt; Hardly.

&gt; Listen, you've been accelerating continously at a significant fraction
&gt; of 1G for literally *years*, you're travelling at a large fraction of C.

&gt; Which implies that you're going to something that is several lightyears
&gt; away.

&gt; Whatever you do inside of one day is going to be of no measurable
&gt; influence whatsoever, if it *did* matter, which it don't, you could
&gt; correct it by pointing your engine 0.01 degree differently than you
&gt; otherwise would for the remaining braking. (or by turning 181 degrees,
&gt; waiting a bit, and then turning 1 degree back)

&gt; And one *day* is very liberal for turning. Keep in mind that we're
&gt; talking of a structure that is un-flimsy enough to be able to withstand
&gt; both 1G and 0G, which means it needs quite a bit of structural
&gt; integrity. With most plausible designs you could probably turn in an
&gt; hour rather than a day, 180 degrees flip in 1 hour ain't precisely quick
&gt; turning, even supertankers can do that, and they've got pesky water to
&gt; deal with.

&gt; Your objection is akin to asking what you're going to do about the
&gt; problem that the fly flying into your left car-window will prevent you
&gt; from arriving at Grandmas by pushing you off course. The answer is, in
&gt; principle it will *sligthly*, but in practice the disturbance is so
&gt; small that you won't even notice it happening.

&gt; With an engine capable of pushing for 1 hour, you don't waste delta-V by
&gt; letting the engine run during a flipover-maneuver. With an engine
&gt; capable of pushing for *years*, it makes no sense to turn it off for
&gt; such a short duration, the risks outweigh the benefits by SEVERAL orders
&gt; of magnitude. (what do you do if the period of zero-G dislodges

picture this setup. A sealed box, in which are placed a cat, and a
container which is opened or not depending on the decay of a radioactive
isotope (I think he named u239, but for gossake, don't quote me on that

lethal dose is administered, cannot affect in any way whether it does
kill the cat if it is administered. Question: without looking into the

Look at it this way: Given the scale of the numbers, one day of
sideways thrust is probably less than the precision of your
navigational systems. So, yes, it will change your course, but it
will do so less than the noise in the navigational system. You've
going to need to do course corrections anyway on such a long

That would be for 0.01 rad, not 0.01 deg.  0.01 deg would be about 3 x
10^-3 ly for every 100 ly.  That's about 200 au.

But you're still missing the point in two ways.  First, _years_ of
acceleration aren't going to be undone by _a day_ of acceleration in a
different direction.  The difference will be negligible.  0.01 deg is
surely a vast overestimate, given just for the sake of saying.

Second, even if the difference weren't negligible, the difference is
_known_.  The pilots who performed the maneuver know what they did and
could easily compensate by changing course by that tiny amount.

It can't slow down but it can stop and then continue again.

The slower speed of light in these media is accomplished by having the
light occasionally bang into an atom, get absorbed, then get re-emitted a
short time later. Or so I understand it, I could be horribly horribly
wrong.

OK, let's try to salvage what we can of this derailed discussion.

produce nasty electromagnetic radiation, but that water and ice and

I realized not long after writing this that the cargo doors need to be
huge, and cannot open on the belly (the belly underdeck carries the
main turrets and the ventral conning tower). I'm now considering a
combination of side doors (the sides are mostly free of
installations), pivoting the stern/bow tips open like on a cargo
plane, and using the flight deck as a loading area. Spare parts
(especially the extra amount needed for space exploration) can be
strapped to the outer hull, so I will most certainly have to put
folding loading cranes all around (in-field change of barrels for the
main guns while under planet gravity is going to be interesting!). I
wonder what kind of crane design would work both in 1g and 0g - I
guess you could pair dorsal and ventral cranes to create a &quot;conveyor&quot;

What about this? How would I go about calculating size/mass/RPM

the generator does not produce significant amounts of heat, I'll have
to provide for electric heating and... what else? What about
radiators, too? I think they won't need to be as large as on an atomic

Sort of.  The polariton is a distortion of the atomic lattice due to
the electromagnetic field of the light.  This is only part of the
picture of optical response, however, a by far larger effect in most
systems is the response of the electrons to the field of the light.
This polarization and screening (whether electronic or from the
lattice) creates a back reflection while absorbing the incoming wave.
In transparent media, the interaction of the light with its own
polarization cloud creates the &quot;slowing down&quot; effect, you can think of
it as absorption and re-emission of the wave by the medium if you
want, or the excitation of virtual excitons or virtual optical phonons
(personally, I think about it as poles in the irreducible
polarizability, or poles in the dielectric matrix, but that's what's
most useful for actually working with electronic and optical
response).

Anything that will stop the higher energy cosmic rays will stop solar
flare radiation.

For stopping cosmic rays, you have two issues.  The first is getting
the ray to interact with the material.  The primary interaction
mechanism at these energies is a direct collision with a nucleus (you
will get electronic excitations along the entire track, but on average
you will not lose much energy due to electronic effects before a
nuclear collision).  For this purpose, the lighter the atoms in your
shielding, the less massive your shielding for a given chance of
stopping the ray (the cross sectional area of a nucleus goes as
roughly the 2/3 power of its mass).  Anything with hydrogen in it will
work the best, so your water and concrete should do the job just fine.

Once you force an interaction, you get a shower of secondary
particles.  These can in turn interact to create tertiary particles
and so on, in a cascade of interactions.  The higher energy nuclei in
these cascades are stopped just like the primary ray.  The lower
energy nuclei are brought to a halt by electronic excitations - for
these, the mass for a given amount of protection is mostly material
independent, so use anything.  The gamma rays produced, on the other
hand, are stopped best by heavy elements.  In practice, the path
length needed to stop the primary cosmic rays and subsequent high
energy nuclear fragments is long enough to stop most gammas in light
materials as well, but you could always follow up with a cm or two of
heavy element shielding (lead, uranium, or platinum or gold if you
have it) on the inside of your cosmic ray stopper to eat up any gammas
that happen to leak past.

As a rough order of magnitude, it takes roughly a meter of mater to
get a cosmic ray to interact on average. (Calculations - the inter-
atomic spacing is about 1E-10 m.  In one cubic meter, you thus have
about 1E30 atoms.  The nuclear radius is about 1E-15 m.  A nucleus
thus has a cross section of about 1E-30 m^2.  You thus see that for
one cubic meter, the combined cross section of all those nuclei is
about 1 m^2, so your cosmic ray is likely going to hit one of them.)
So, accounting for the radiation cascade, several cubic meters of
condensed matter (whether steel, concrete, or water) should stop space
radiation.

Long enough to have long left it for better forums, but not long
enough not to come back every once in a while, albeit with higher
standards of discussion. This thread has been great this far, with
excellent advice and thought-provoking suggestions, and I'm happy
people are playing along and enjoying my thought exercise. Let's keep

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Given a change in conductive medium (as for example air versus the
&gt;&gt;&gt; crystal of a well-crafted prism) light can and will bend, or refract,
&gt;&gt;&gt; implying a *slight* (read: really, really *really* tiny)change in
&gt;&gt;&gt; velocity.

&gt;&gt; How do you figure that ?

&gt;&gt; Typical everyday glass has a refractive index around 1.5, which means
&gt;&gt; that the speed of light trough it is 1/1.5 = 67% of the speed in vacuum.

&gt; But light has no mass, no inertia, no velocity, so it *can't* slow down,
&gt; to quote the post to which this replies. Riddle me that, sir.
">

It's no riddle at all. There are longer, more complex explanations. But
the short explanation is that you are wrong. Light does, infact, travel
more slowly trough materials with a higher refrative index.

Light *in*vacuum* (or in any given medium) travels at a constant,
unchanging speed. That may the source of your confusion.

In any case, you're arguing against yourself.

First you claimed it slows down by a &quot;really really *really* tiny&quot;
amount, and that this slowing-down is responsible for refraction.

I point out that, actually, the slowdown is not at all &quot;tiny&quot;.

You *then* come back claiming ligth cannot slow down at *all*
contradicting your own original statement.

Perhaps you should try to get your act together ? Or alternatively, just
admit that you don't have a clue what you're talking about ?
