Empanada Dough

Recipe By: Tyler Florence

1 1/2  cup  all-purpose flour
1  cup  masa harina
1  teaspoons  baking powder
1  teaspoons  salt
1/2  cup  (1 stick) unsalted butter -- melted and cooled
1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water -- for egg wash
Butter -- for greasing the pans

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, masa harina, baking powder,  and
salt. Stir in the melted butter. Gradually add 1/2  cup  to 3/4  cup   of
water, working it in with your hands to incorporate; the dough  should be
easy to handle and not sticky. Form the dough into a ball,  wrap it in
plastic, and chill for 30 minutes.  Lightly flour your rolling pin and
counter. Divide the dough in 1/2  so it will be easier to work with and
roll it out to 1/8-inch  thickness. Using a 4-inch cookie or biscuit
cutter, cut out 10  circles of dough; repeat with the other 1/2.  Spoon 2
generous  tablespoons  of filling into the center of each  pastry circle,
leaving a 1/2-inch border. Brush the edges with the  egg wash and then
fold the dough over in 1/2 to enclose the filling  and form a semi-circle.
Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the  tines of a fork. Chill at
least 30 minutes before baking.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place
the empanadas on a buttered  baking sheet and brush the tops with
additional egg wash. Using a  fork, prick a few holes in the top of the
empanadas for steam to  escape. Bake for 30 minutes, until the pastry is
golden brown.
