I have switched to building sites based on CSS.

I have a problem with IE, it won't play nice

On about 90% of computers in the world my designs
work ok, but then there are some where they fall apart.

It is something about IE and certain computers.

Does anyone know of any tutorial to hacked
the bad behavior from IE??

Thanks

Maybe check out, http://www.htmldog.com they have some good tutorials. But
as for IE, v 6 does have a lot of bugs with rendering CSS.

Here or alt.html or ... presumably there must be a newsgroups devoted
specifically to css?

I suggest you cross-post here and in alt.html (don't multi-post) with the
url and a description of the problem you are seeing and include the browser
versions that give the problem if you think it is browser specific.

There is a very simple solution. Keep it simple.

If you tried to drive across the Sahara desert in a Rover Metro would
you complain everytime the car broke down &quot;that it wasn't playing
nice?&quot; or would you accept that perhaps you were trying to force it to
do something beyond its design capabilities?

IE works fine with all the CSS suggestions I give it. All browsers
have problems when you try implementing complex absolute positiong,
layers and the like, because HTML was never designed for that.

Some things are very easy and reliable to do across all browsers. Like
setting fonts and margins and padding (there's a few caveats and
encouragement to use a doctype with a path to get the boxmodel right and
not in quirks mode).

Some things like tableless layouts are very difficult.

My general rule for CSS is to use as few classes as possible and
style  by element under a decendant.

In other words, dont do this:

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;fancy&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;fancy&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;fancy&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;fancy&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;fancy_list&quot;&gt;...
&lt;/div&gt;

do this instead:

&lt;div id=&quot;fancy&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;..

and style it like this:

#fancy p{}
#fancy ul{}

and set default styles in the body

body{default styles for page}

You may need to add td and th for some browsers.

I mention that because many people don't do it that way. And you wind
up with a lot of extra unneeded markup.
