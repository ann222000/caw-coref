***********************************************************

The more we empty ourselves to make room for God's love, the more he
fills us with himself and the more united to him will we be.  --St.
Alphonse Liguori

Cast yourself in the arms of God and be very sure that if He wants
anything of you, He will fit you for the work and give you strength.
--St. Philip Neri

If we concern ourselves with pleasing God, we would not worry about
pleasing people.

We can represent God's love every waking hour.

My sobering pastime shakes me out of my indifference and reminds me of
my highest calling - to serve our living God each day. Against that
truth, we can assess our goals and how we spend our time. Each day we
are building our legacy.  --Tom Smith

God offers new starts and second, third, fourth, fifth - countless -
chances. Forgiveness and renewal are always available. Whatever our
stage in life, we can be grateful that God gives us forgiveness and
opportunities for new beginnings.  --Marie E. DisBrow

Live your life so that others can see the light of Christ in you.

When we ask for forgiveness and allow God to clean old, sinful ways out
of our hearts and minds, we can be restored to bring glory to God.
--Karen L. Banning

PERSEVERANCE IS NOT A LONG RACE
PHILIPPIANS 3:14
Walter Elliot said, &quot;Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short
races one after another.&quot;
Many would define perseverance as one consistent day after another, but
the fact is that no one is consistently consistent in all things 100% of
the time.
A better way to say it is that perseverance is 4 consistent days out of
5. Or 9 consistent days out of 10.
I love Paul's use of the phrase &quot;press on&quot; in Philippians 3. It
communicates the idea of not just trying, but trying again.  Paul admits
that he is not perfect, has not yet attained all that he desires to be ...
(v. 13-14) But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining
toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal ...
Perseverance isn't so much a matter of winning one long marathon as it
is a matter of winning (or even &quot;placing&quot; in) the short races you run
day after day, hour after hour. It requires us to press on, even after
minor setbacks and temporary defeats.
Perseverance is a lifetime accomplishment ... lived out one day at a
time, one 40-yard dash at a time.  --Steve May

A Grateful Heart
Psalm 118:1 - Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His love endures
for ever. (NIV)
Ephesians 5:20 - Always giving thanks to God the Father for everything,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. (NIV)
God has blessed us in so many wonderful ways. How often do we take the
time to thank Him? Surely not only once a year.
Here are some reasons to thank God every day:
* Loving relationships with family and friends
* His Word, the Bible
* The beauty of creation
- a rainbow
- a sunset
- a fresh snowfall
- the fall colours
- flowers in a garden
* Good health
Let us all try to make our own list of things we're thankful for.
God's steadfast love endures forever! So much so, that He sent Jesus,
His only Son, to die on the cross so that our sins could be forgiven and
we could have eternal life. What a reason to give thanks! Today and
every day, let our hearts be full of gratitude and thanksgiving for all
that God has done for us.
Psalm 100:4 - Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with
praise; give thanks to him and praise his name. (NIV)
God's generous giving deserves our thankful living!
Prayer: Heavenly Father, with grateful hearts, we thank You for Your
love which surrounds us and for the many blessings You have showered
upon us, even though we don't deserve them. Thank You for giving us so
much, and help us to be generous to others. May we always remember to
give You thanks and praise each and every day of our lives! In Jesus'
name, we pray. Amen.  --Dee Renaud

Who's leading your Parade?
Every day you are bombarded by messages. The messages are communicated
from the leaders of fashion, entertainment, politics, and finance (to
name a few). They cleverly communicate message about the way you should
think, feel, behave, and look. They are successful at getting the masses
to follow them. They are leading the parade and getting everyone to buy
into their products, philosophy, style, and culture. Think that you are
not impacted by these leaders? Think again. They influence your
decisions regarding your diet, health, leisure time, travel, wardrobe,
and spending. In fact, they are leading the entire culture into a new
way of thinking about life style, family, priorities, and norms. It is
hard not to get caught up in their parade! It is fun, beautiful,
comfortable, and exciting. It is easier to be swept along with the
majority and give in to their thinking and standards.
Of course, that may be what is easy, but it certainly is not what is
best. The only one that you should be following is Jesus Christ. Have a
question about something the world is telling you to do, be, or
participate in? Look to Jesus. Read the Word. Ask Him for the answer in
pray and meditation. Don't get swept away by the world's overwhelming
tidal wave of influence. Stop and ask yourself who is leading your
parade. Are you following the parade of the world and in the process
compromising your integrity and standards? If so, make a decision today
to step away from the crowd and surrender your life to Jesus Christ.
When He is your leader, the choices in your life are no longer
meaningless reactions to the world around you, but rather, are
purposeful and powerful decision that will result in the blessings that
only He can provide.
My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. John
10:27  --The Daily Journey

***********************************************************

CLOSE YOUR EYES
&quot;I will not leave you as orphans.&quot;  John 14:18
Recently took my mother in law to the orthopedic surgeon for an
examination. One of the tests was for her to shut her eyes and try to
walk a few steps. She was aware her balance was off, but she did as the
doctor asked, anyway. She knew that he was asking her to do something
important, and she had confidence that he would catch her when she began
to sway and fall.
Do we act with the same trust and faith in God as she had done with the
doctor? When He asks us to do something we know will be uncomfortable or
scary, am we obedient? Do we have faith that He will be there to catch
us?  That He will not let us fall flat on our faces?  That His
everlasting arms are big enough to hold us through the frightening times
of life?
I pray we would have that type of an obedient spirit, and have that much
faith. God tells us in the Bible He will never leave or forsake us- and
His promises are true! He has proved them over and over to us, time and
again throughout the ages as well as with me on a personal level.
Thank you, dear Lord, for you promises. Especially the one that says you
will always be with us.  --Marion Smith

***********************************************************

Gaining weight is something we all seem to battle -- especially as we
get older! Obviously, God does not want us physically fat! But He does
want us spiritually FAT!
God is looking for FAT disciples! The question then is this: How FAT are
you?
Faithful
1 Corinthians 4:2 reads, &quot;Moreover it is required in stewards [managers]
that a man be found faithful.&quot; When I am faithful, God can trust me with
assignments and responsibilities. Not only does it mean that God can
trust me and count on me, but it also means that I trust God and count
on Him. If I am faithful, I am full of faith and believe God enough to
step out on His Word, regardless of the circumstances.
Romans 10:17 tells us, &quot;So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by
the Word of God.&quot; I must show my faith by my obedience for &quot;the
obedience... comes from faith.&quot;
Available
The Lord asked, &quot;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&quot; Then I
said, &quot;Here am I. Send me!&quot; (Isaiah 6:8) God is looking for volunteers,
people who will say, &quot;I am Yours, Lord. I am ready and willing to do
Your will, whatever it may be.&quot; Are you available to the Lord like that?
God never looks for ability -- God always looks for availability! He
does not call the equipped -- He equips the called!
Moses told God he could not speak well...and God said, &quot;No problem. I
can give you the ability to speak.&quot; (Exodus 4:10-12) The best ability is
simple availability.
Teachable
It is really hard for God to work in a heart that does not easily and
readily receive instruction (a hard-soiled or rocky-soiled heart). I
often pray, &quot;Lord give me a heart that is good soil so that your Word
can penetrate and bear fruit in me thirty, sixty and a hundredfold.&quot;
God can teach a person wonderful lessons, even through a little child,
if that person is open and teachable. God is not only looking for those
open to instruction, He is looking for those open to correction.
If I am truly teachable, you can point out deficiencies and blind spots
in my life (speak the truth in love)... and I will listen and take those
comments to heart.
David prayed, &quot;Let the godly strike me! It will be a kindness! If they
correct me, it is soothing medicine. Don't let me refuse it.&quot; (Psalm
141:5) If you and I truly want to grow strong in the Lord, we need
people around us who will love us enough to tell us the truth and point
out blind spots so that we can work on them... to the glory of God.
Would you determine in your heart to be a FAT disciple? Remember, the
FATTER you become spiritually, the more God will be able to use you to
make a difference in the world for Christ.  --Senior Pastor Timothy Satryan

When Cows Fly
&quot;Set an example for other followers by what you say and do, as well as
by your love, faith, and purity.&quot; -- 1 Timothy 4:12 (CEV)
I read a news story recently that came from the state of Texas. It seems
that a cattle carrier traveling on an interstate experienced trouble
when the back of the trailer came open. For lack of a better way to put
it, cows flew out. Of course, cows can't fly, which in this instance, is
not good news for the cows involved.
Neither was it good news for the traffic following the cattle carrier.
The flying cows led to a chain reaction of negative events. Several cars
hit some of the cows, and at least one cow died. Police scrambled to the
scene. While working to control the accident scene, another truck
approached on the interstate. It sped by, nearly hitting a police
officer. Two police vehicles immediately began pursuit of the speeding
truck. The truck quickly pulled off to the side of the interstate and
two men jumped out and began running. The police vehicles also pulled
over, the officers got out of their vehicles, and began pursuing the
suspects on foot. Eventually, the suspects were caught. Unfortunately,
the officers had stopped their vehicles in tall grass, which ignited a
fire, engulfing their cars in flames and completely destroying them.
When cows fly, bad things happen. When cows fly, unintended consequences
are set into motion. I don't know about you, but when I look back on my
day, so often I feel like I've sent cows flying. Of course, I've never
actually flung a cow, but in my words and actions, I've unleashed all
kinds of unintended consequences.
Here's one simple example. In a weak moment, I've said unkind words
about someone else in the presence of others and that, in turn,
encourages those others to do the same. Typically, this just reflects
the frustration of the moment, not even any long-term issues. But then
the unkind words somehow make their way back to the person they were
spoken about. Talk about unintended consequences. Pretty soon, it's
raining cows! Relationships are damaged and work has to be done to
restore them. Sometimes, the relationships have been repaired, sometimes
not.
The Scriptures tell us that we have a responsibility to keep a close
watch over our lives regarding how we think, speak and act. Today's
story is just one simple reminder to all of us of why. When cows fly,
unintended consequences result and bad things happen. Today, let's do
our best, with God's help, to keep the cows where they belong.  --Jim
Liebelt

Small Straws In A Soft Wind by Marsha Burns
My beloved people, take time to put your issues of life into
perspective.  As long as you focus on your circumstances and feel like
you have been victimized you are living life according to the flesh and
not walking in the Spirit.  And, that is not a good place to be.  You
are in training and being trained by the Spirit to exist in the Spirit
realm.  Refuse to allow the enemy to shift your focus from life in the
Kingdom to life in the flesh.  It is the difference between life and
death, victory and defeat.  Look up, says the Lord.
Romans 8:5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on
the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the
things of the Spirit.

Expect to be stretched as your encounters take you beyond the ordinary.
You will need to exercise patience in every situation in order to avoid
frustration.  I am going to shine a light on attitudes, motives and
hidden agendas, which will be valuable in making decisions and will in
some instances cause you to make a course correction at this time.  Your
responses to challenges that you face will be extremely revealing and
will be a stage for spiritual growth if you are willing to be honest
with yourself.  Take advantage of these opportunities to grow in
discernment, says the Lord.
Luke 21:19 &quot;By your patience possess your souls.

Be strong, beloved, and refuse to allow the enemy to single you out and
whisper in your ear of your failures and shortcomings.  The attack
against you will come with singular intensity to make you feel like you
are the only one &quot;not getting it.&quot;  It is designed to paralyze you with
condemnation so that you can't hear My voice or the voice of
encouragement from those around you.  Rise up and shut the door to the
accuser of the brethren by not receiving the devil's lies.  You can
choose to only receive the truth of My word, says the Lord, which will
usher you into the realm of supernatural victory.
John 8:44b &quot; He  (the devil) was a murderer from the beginning, and does
not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks
a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father
of it.

Seek Me for wisdom, says the Lord, because the spiritual land you are
now moving into will require fresh revelation as to the challenges you
will face.  You must be clear and alert if you are going to understand
how to overcome.  Watch for definitive opportunities to overcome the
works of the flesh through fear, failure and frustration.  Be ready to
resist the devil vehemently.  The term &quot;new levels; new devils&quot; will be
given detailed definition as you encounter princes of darkness in this
unfamiliar territory.  Now is the time to function at your highest level
of perception and discernment because life will not be business as usual.
Ephesians 2:1-7 And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and
sins, in which you once walked according to the course of this world,
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now
works in the sons of disobedience, among whom also we all once conducted
ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh
and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the
others.  But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with
which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive
together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up
together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ
Jesus  that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of
His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

Watch for the enemy to test you again in old places of defeat, which
have recently become places of victory.  As you move toward your new
spiritual plateau the opposing forces will exert great strength to hold
you back or even cause you to lose ground.  Refuse to give up one inch!
Stand your ground, and exercise your authority to push back the powers
of darkness.  Remember that as formidable as the enemy seems, I am still
stronger, says the Lord, and I have already gained the victory on your
behalf.  But, you must fight the good fight of faith.
Luke 10:19 &quot;Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and
scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any
means hurt you.

Hope Is Eternal
Hope is a word we hear almost every day by people wishing the best
outcome to be.
It's &quot;hope for the best&quot; with sheer positive thinking for the future
they can't even see.
But the very word &quot;hope&quot; has different meaning for the Christian who
lives by His call.
For that hope is the anchor of their very own lives as they trust Him as
their one and all.
Hope is the promises of God for His children regardless of the outcomes
of life.
For hope holds the soul in the palm of His hand through heartache &amp;
seasons of strife.
That hope is not passing...like a fleeting emotion when it is fixed on
the glory of the King.
For it's hope that reveals God's everlasting beauty and will give you a
new song to sing.
This hope for the believer is not earthly hope but it's eternal, in a
world yet unseen.
It is permanent and solid...exceeding all human reason and surpassing
our mere, mortal dreams.
This hope is the surety and the seed of eternity planted deep in the
heart's fertile sod.
For hope is a person and His name is Jesus sitting high at the right
hand of God.
--Sheila Gosney

May I Run This Race,Lord?
Today I feel weary and a little bit worn
I need to go visit the elderly lady
The baby that was just born
May I run this race,Lord?
Oh how I would like to be physically fit
With a healthy body,plenty of energy and a little wit
To be a pleasure to someone each day
May I run this race,Lord?
Lord give me wisdom to understand your word
Allow  me  to be useful for you in this world
For others to see you in my life
May I run this race,Lord?
Thank you for all that you have done for me
Especially my salvation ,that set me free
&gt;From worldly pleasure that is just not me
May I run this race, Lord?
You gave your son that I may live
To glorify our Father is the way I feel
Help me to do your perfect will
Let me run this race ,Lord
--Sarah Berthelson

***********************************************************

&quot;Abba, Father,&quot; he said, &quot;everything is possible for you. Take this cup
from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.&quot;  &quot;Watch and pray so
that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the
body is weak.&quot;  Mark 14: 36,38

Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the
world, the love of the Father is not in him. For everything in the
world---the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the
boasting of what he has and does---comes not from the Father but from
the world. The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the
will of God lives forever.  1 John 2:15-17

Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD; O Lord, hear my voice. Let your
ears be attentive to my cry for mercy. If you, O LORD, kept a record of
sins, O Lord, who could stand? But with you there is forgiveness;
therefore you are feared. I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in his
word I put my hope. My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait
for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning. O Israel, put
your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is unfailing love and with him
is full redemption. He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.
Psalm 130

Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.  Isaiah 40:1

Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what
is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may
benefit those who listen. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with
whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Get rid of all
bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form
of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each
other, just as in Christ God forgave you.  Ephesians 4:29-32

And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me
unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.  2
Timothy 4:18

No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is
faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But
when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can
stand up under it.  1 Corinthians 10:13

***********************************************************

His Work of Art
Do you ever wake up and wonder if you're where God wants you?  Do you
ever wonder if you're really following God's plan for your life?  These
are normal questions and ought to be asked by every true believer in
Jesus Christ.  We should desire to follow His plan; and the only way to
know is to ask, listen for direction, and obediently follow.
The most important part of God's plan is that we trust in Jesus for the
forgiveness of sin; &quot;He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to
perish, but everyone to come to repentance&quot; (2 Peter 3:9).  God wants us
all to repent, turn to Jesus, and receive His gift of Salvation.  He
wants us to step from eternal death to eternal life through faith in His
one and only Son!
But many people receive His gift and then continue life with no real
change, no new direction.  This should not be!  When we receive God's
gift of Salvation, something wonderful occurs; &quot;Therefore, if anyone is
in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!&quot; (2
Corinthians 5:17).  When we place our life in His hands, He wipes away
the ugliness of our sin and begins to grow and mature us into the
likeness of His Son (Romans 8:29).  This process of maturing growth IS
His plan!
Ephesians 2:10 &quot;For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to
do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.&quot;
When we become a new creation in Christ, we become God's workmanship.
The Greek word for workmanship is &quot;poiema&quot; - it's where we get the word
poem.  And though it might be difficult to think of our life as a poem,
the idea being presented is that God is creating something beautiful,
something almost poetic which touches the heart of God.
It might be easier to switch analogies and think of God as the Master
Painter.  When we give Him our life, we hand Him our old canvas covered
with the grotesque ugliness of sin.  But by grace, the canvas is wiped
clean, and the Artist begins to paint a work of art with Jesus as the
model.  Every stroke of His brush is to make our canvas look more and
more like Christ.
Are we where God wants us?  Are we following His plan?  To help find the
answer, we should ask: Is the likeness of Christ beginning to form or is
my canvas still filled with ugliness and confusion?  Am I allowing Him
to paint or am I trying to take the brush at every opportunity?
God really is the Master Painter, and He really does know what He's
doing.  If we will allow Him to finish His work, the end result will be
better than anything we can imagine!!  Let's give Him our canvas and
allow Him to paint.  Let's follow His plan and allow our life to become
His work of art. Have a Christ Centered Day!  --Steve Troxel

Come to Me
Where do you go when you are empty? Where to you go when your batteries
are low, or drained and you have no energy and your spirits are low?
What do you do when you are burdened and weary and wondering if you have
what it takes to keep going?
Sound familiar? Have you been there? Are you there now?
Jesus understands those feelings. He offers a suggestion.
&quot;Are you tired? Worn out? Come to me. Get away with me and you'll
recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me
and work with me-watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace.
I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me
and you'll learn to live freely and lightly.&quot; (Matthew 11:28-30, The
Message)
Jesus said, &quot;Come to me.&quot; Sounds like He may be saying turn down the
noise. Shut off the racket. Get away from the crowds. Go to Him. Go to
where He is. Spend time with Him.
The passage expands the thought when He says, &quot;Get away with me and
you'll recover your life.&quot; Sounds like it is not going to happen unless
we do what He says, &quot;Get away with Him.&quot; We need to be alone with Him.
&quot;Walk with me and work with me -- watch how I do it... Keep company with
me...&quot; You cannot walk with someone when you are not with them. You
cannot watch how they work from a distance. Jesus wants us to walk with
Him, watch how He lives and works.
All those things require something of us that we are reluctant to give:
Our time. Our complete and undivided attention is what He is asking. As
hard as it may to give it, it is obvious that we cannot receive the
benefits unless we go with Him, walk with Him, keep company with Him,
and watch how He works.
What is the promise? &quot;I'll show you how to take a real rest.&quot; &quot;You'll
learn to live freely and lightly.&quot; That's what we are looking for. Rest.
The free life. There is it. Right there in our grasp.
All we have to do is go to Jesus.
Sounds like it is worth the sacrifice.
Let's go. Let's rest. Let live. Let's spend time with Jesus.  --Tom Norvell

May The Lord Bless You
Today as I knelt to pray
I thought of you this very day
I asked the Lord to bless you
You are His child and He loves you so
May the Lord bless you
He sent you into my life to be my friend
I am so happy about that and do not know how to begin
To tell you I care and wish you were near
For me to tell you in person that I love you my dear
May the Lord bless you
He has showed me that you are special to Him
Therefore I need to stay in touch so together we can be friends
May the Lord bless you
Often you are hurting or may be sad
He tells me to care for you, he cares like a dad
May the Lord bless you
On this day!!

Read Through The Bible
Exodus 1
The Israelites Oppressed
1 These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with
Jacob, each with his family: 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; 3
Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; 4 Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 5 The
descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in
Egypt. 6 Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, 7
but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became
exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them. 8 Then a
new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt. 9
&quot;Look,&quot; he said to his people, &quot;the Israelites have become much too
numerous for us. 10 Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will
become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies,
fight against us and leave the country.&quot; 11 So they put slave masters
over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and
Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 12 But the more they were
oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to
dread the Israelites 13 and worked them ruthlessly. 14 They made their
lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of
work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them
ruthlessly. 15 The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose
names were Shiphrah and Puah, 16 &quot;When you help the Hebrew women in
childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill
him; but if it is a girl, let her live.&quot; 17 The midwives, however,
feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do;
they let the boys live. 18 Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives
and asked them, &quot;Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys
live?&quot; 19 The midwives answered Pharaoh, &quot;Hebrew women are not like
Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives
arrive.&quot; 20 So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and
became even more numerous. 21 And because the midwives feared God, he
gave them families of their own. 22 Then Pharaoh gave this order to all
his people: &quot;Every boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but
let every girl live.&quot;
