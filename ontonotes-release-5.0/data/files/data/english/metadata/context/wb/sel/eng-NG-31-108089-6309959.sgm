Here is my knowledge, yes it will. When looking at after market tanks in J&amp;P
cycle it shows tanks for 2000 - 2006 softails. One tank said not for Deuce.
Here is a thought,,,call the local Harley dealer.

You could visit the Harley web site http://www.harley-davidson.com and
compare the part numbers of the tanks for each bike.

As i recall, the fuel injected tanks are not interchangable with gravity
feed ones

So go to one of the aftermarket shops - j&amp;p , dennis kirk , etc . look up
parts for the two different bikes ... if they use the same p/n , they must
be the same !!!!
And when you get finished , wash the spoon and put it back in the rack .

As per the H-D catalog........... Tanks from '01 and later fuel
injected softails will also fit on '04 to '06 carbureted Softails.
(except Deuce carb or injected models)

So, if the fatboy is carbed, he's most likely forked.
