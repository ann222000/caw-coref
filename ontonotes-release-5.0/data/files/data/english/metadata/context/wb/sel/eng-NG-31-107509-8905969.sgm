First let me say that I am a lurker who much appreciates the advice and wisdom of this group.

My podcast is a small weekly story telling show.  I am not in your league.  So I am most appreciative of an advice on this rather strange problem I am having.

I recently replaced my laptop (so I could play WoW but that is another story) and have been trying to get it set up for recording my show.

The operating system is XP (it was hard but I found a new machine with XP on it) and I use Audacity to record.

When I record myself, I am off-center (my politics are far left but I did not think Audacity would pick up on it). I do 'normalize' to try to get myself in the middle but it takes away some of the warmth of the voice.

I did not have this problem with the old machine.  Mic has not changed; room has not changed; I am in constance flux but then that is life.

Is there an option I forgot to choose?  I want a mono recording (just me talking why waste the bandwidth).  That is what I am getting.  Just slightly off-center.

TIA.

Normalizing will not change your stereo placement.  Nor will it affect
the warmth of the voice.  It only make your highest audio level equal to
digital zero (-3 dB with Audacity I think).

What is telling you the stereo image is off center?  Are you listening
with headphones?  Can you see it on Audacity's meters?  Is it skewed to
the left or the right?

Michael,

If you currently have an XP disc with a key, you can install it on whatever
computer you purchase now. Just have to get the drivers. Otherwise, you can
buy XP for around $100 to $140.

Thank you.

I have a Toshiba Satellite with an OEM version of XP. Will that work
on any pooter, or does it have to be a Toshiba Satellite, or does it
have to be THIS Toshiba Satellite?

I plan to upgrade in the next few months, and really don't want to pay
for Vista, then delete it (They do include the charge for the OS in
the price of a new pooter.)

I'll have to research this. (Off to GOOGLE! I go.....Yes! GOOGLE!!)

Usually if it is oem for one computer brand it will ONLY work with that
brand.  MY only complaint with Vista is with the software and hardware
vendors that have known for CLOSE TO TWO YEARS that this os was coming and
they have done NOTHING to be ready for it.

Normally, the disc goes along with the brand of the computer, as it may be a
restore disc that installs it to factory specs.

The price you are paying for Vista is negligible. As you do not get an
original disc with the computer. Just make a restore disc, and if you decide
to go back to Vista, you have a way to do it. You can a nice computer fro
$300 to $1000, depending on speed, ram, HD size, etc.

There are issues with Vista, but it is not as much as you would think.
I had a customer come in and buy a new quad core with Vista. She upgraded
the video card for gaming. The games were between 1 month to 2 years old. 18
out of 20 games worked with Vista. I'd call that good odds.

You know, this exact thing happened to me the last time I recorded Coffee
and Tea Show--the mic recorded off center for a while (the wave pattern
actually reached down further than it went up) and I couldn't do anything
about it, then all of a sudden it sort of settled down and recorded more
equally. Then the next day when I tried to record Rockypod, there was a low
hum. I think my mic is going bad, which makes me mad since I only bought it
in January and I have been really careful with it (It's an MXL 990
compressor mic and wasn't that expensive, but I can't keep buying new mics
all the time even at that price! Luckily I earlier bought a couple of used
mics from Amber and Rusty at GA Podcast network or I would have really been
in trouble.)

Long story short, your mic may be going bad.

I just thought of something else which I hadn't tried. It may be a bad
connector on your mixer, if you use a mixer.

Ok, more information.  How I know I am off center is visually.
Looking at the picture that Audacity produces my recording is not
aligned with the zero.  It is below the mark by .25.

As to the normalizing.  In Audacity, the normalize by Dominic Mazzoni
has two check boxes 1) Remove any DC offset (center on 0 vertically)
and 2) Normalize maximum amplitude to -3 dB.

I use the first option and it seems to get me back to 0 (center).

I don't use a mixer.  Very low tech just computer, microphone (Sony
ECM-MS907?), and me.  I don't think it is the mic.  On the old
machine, I am right 0.

As to getting an new machine with XP.  I bought directly from Compaq
on-line.  There was a model I liked noticed another with same product
code but for the addition of X to the end.  Turned out to be same
machine with different XP instead of Vista.  Bought it.

I am thinking there is another option or setting in Audacity I forgot
to set.

Whether or not you're touching zero has nothing to do with left/right

Normalize to -3 dB, and then raise your volume by 3 dB, and you'll be

It sounds to me like you're doing fine.

He wasn't worried about left/right space.  That was misspoken.

He was seeing the Audacity waveform off of the zero mark, which will
limit the dynamic range available.

It may be that your mic or mic preamp isn't working properly
electronically, causing a high DC offset.

In Audacity you try Effect -&gt; Normalize and tick the box that says
&quot;Remove any DC offset&quot;.

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_offset :

&quot;DC offset is an offsetting of a signal from zero. The term originated
in electronics, where it refers to a direct current voltage, but the
concept has been extended to any representation of a waveform. DC offset
is the mean amplitude of the waveform; if the mean amplitude is zero,
there is no DC offset.

DC offset is usually undesirable. For example, in audio processing, a
sound that has DC offset will not be at its loudest possible volume when
normalized (because the offset consumes headroom), and this problem can
possibly extend to the mix as a whole, since a sound with DC offset and
a sound without DC offset will have DC offset when mixed. It may also
cause other artifacts depending on what is being done with the signal.&quot;

Andrew
