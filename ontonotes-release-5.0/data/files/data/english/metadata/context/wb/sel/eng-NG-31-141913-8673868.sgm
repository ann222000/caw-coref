&quot;I refuse to be silent any longer. I refuse to be party to an illegal
and immoral war against people who did nothing to deserve our
aggression. My oath of office is to protect and defend America's
laws and its people. By refusing unlawful orders for an illegal
war, I fulfill that oath today.&quot; - U.S. Army First Lt. Ehren Watada

Petraeus Lets Slip the Ugly Truth of this War

By Andrew Sullivan

When historians look back on the past week in Washington, I suspect
they will see it as a seminal moment. It was the moment when the
president and his party recommitted themselves to an indefinite,
decades-long Iraq occupation, and when the Iraq war was formally
handed over to the next president, with forces near the maxed-out
2006 level.

Checkbook Imperialism

The Blackwater Fiasco

By Robert Scheer

Please, please, I tell myself, leave Orwell out of it. Find some
other, fresher way to explain why &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot; is
dependent upon killer mercenaries. Or why the &quot;democratically elected
government&quot; of &quot;liberated&quot;

Iraq does not explicitly have the legal power to expel Blackwater
USA from its land or hold any of the 50,000 private contractor
troops that the U.S.

government has brought to Iraq accountable for their deadly actions.

At What Price, Safety?

By Cindy Sheehan

I am consistently amazed at things that right-wing nut jobs throw
at me to justify their support of an unjustifiable war. Seriously,
when you watch Generals, Ambassadors, Senators and Congress Reps
and pundits who still cheerlead for a miserable, failed and murderous
policy you can almost see the skepticism in their eyes, too. They
know they are lying for their masters now, if they, like George and
Dick didn't always know they were lying.

Senate Bars Bill to Restore Detainee Rights

By Susan Cornwell

to be considered by lawmakers in the Senate, narrowly controlled
by Democrats; it received only 56, with 43 voting against the effort
to roll back a key element of President George W.

Bush's war on terrorism.
