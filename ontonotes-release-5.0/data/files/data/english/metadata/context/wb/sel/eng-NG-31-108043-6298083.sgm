All right, I'm ready to smack upside the head of the character who has
been recently asking d20 questions here that don't have anything to do
with Dungeons and Dragons specifically. Just because the current
version of Dungeons and Dragons uses d20 does NOT mean people can go on
about ANY d20 product around here. This is NOT a d20 newsgroup! Sheesh,
get with the program.

I've been messing around with a d20 Modern urban-fantasy setting off
and on for a while; a small city called New Megiddo; founded on the
banks of the Mississippi in the early 1800s by a religious sect that
embraced the Book of Revelation with absolute literal certainty. The
place became a haven for bohemian elements and circus freaks during the
Depression; the "collection" of a P.T. Barnum-esque character who casts
a shadow even to this day. Of course, the definition of "freak" is a
wide one.

Anyway, think "Good Omens" with a twang and hucksterish, voodoo
seasoning. Maybe even a dragon or two. And Odin. Never know where he'll
turn up, simply because I'm a Gaiman dork.

As far as Ralph's rant, I see what he's getting at, and even sympathize
to a certain extent. For me, though, the line between D&amp;D and the rest
of d20 is so blurry as to be insubstantial. As long as a certain
fraction of the group will be left out in the cold during a discussion
of any given D&amp;D splatbook anyway, what's the harm in throwing d20
Modern into the mix?

Read the charter, you uppity young whippersnapper! This newsgroup is
for Dungeons and Dragons! I can kind of understand something like
someone adapting D&amp;D rules to some other campaign, but some of the
posts have nothing to do with any of the D&amp;D rules. :-p

I'm usually left out in most of the discussions, anyway, because I
prefer first edition AD&amp;D. I guess the main reason I get so crotchety
about d20 is that some people act like it's the be-all end-all of
gaming, and that we should convert everything to d20. It has its good
points, but it's not God's gift to gaming, for cryin' out loud.

For god's sake. That's pathetic. Back in the day, we had people who
could come up with proper rants that went on for pages and pages and
swamped our 1200 baud modems with foaming dreck that meant we couldn't
download anything else for a *week*. But now, thanks to so-called
improvements in technology, and despite the fact that the increased
bandwidth delivered by ADSL would let you froth and jabber for
MEGABYTES, you don't even bother to try. You're just one of those
whippersnappers who's grown up with the idea that the internet is all
about pretty pictures and icons and MySpace and YouTube and point and
bloody click!

I see a post header promising a nice inviting rant, and what do we
get? Five and a half lines. I could have wept. What's wrong with
society these days? I blame the parents. Or the state education
system, I suppose. When I was at school, they taught us proper English
so that we could put together an argument. Say what you like about the
Liberal Arts Establishment, but their spawn can usually be relied on
for a good incoherent argument that burbles on for a few kilobytes.
Whilst I acknowledge that English might not be your first language, I
consider that a) unlikely and b) no excuse.

Half the rants we get nowadays aren't even written by human beings!
These idle layabouts will just bash a few keywords into a perl script
and let it do the work. What happened to craftsmanship? What happened
to honesty, to pride, to satisfaction? Before the Internet, newspapers
would be snowed under by the Green Ink Brigade showering them with
deeply held and half-baked theories in mad screeds of furious and
minutely detailed pedantry. Those days are now, I fear, behind us,
relegated only to be unread on the comments page of the Daily
Telegraph. It's a sad day.

Old Fart? who are you trying to kid? I was ancient and farting when
you were still unwrapping your first Nintendo. In those days, the BBS
would have ONE, just ONE group for all roleplaying and we called it
D&amp;D because that's all there was. Then some clown would start spamming
us with crap about some upstart gibberish called Tunnels and Trolls.
OK, so it was at least fantasy and a crude ripoff of D&amp;D with the same
monsters. But when they had Traveller and Metamorphosis Alpha and
Gamma World and this ridiculous FUTURE nonsense, that was really cause
to complain.

Right. I've wasted enough time trying to educate you. Just do better
next time, or I shall become annoyed.

And as for those people talking about d20 for other stuff, you can
stop sniggering. The boy is right. Try rgfm. It could do with the
traffic.

&gt; &gt; &gt; All right, I'm ready to smack upside the head of the character who has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been recently asking d20 questions here that don't have anything to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; with Dungeons and Dragons specifically. Just because the current
&gt; &gt; &gt; version of Dungeons and Dragons uses d20 does NOT mean people can go on
&gt; &gt; &gt; about ANY d20 product around here.

&gt; &gt;       Sure it does. As long as someone incorporates it into D&amp;D.

&gt; &gt;       I wonder who, on this newsgroup, might incorporate, say, D20 Modern
&gt; &gt; into D&amp;D...

&gt; I've been messing around with a d20 Modern urban-fantasy setting off
&gt; and on for a while; a small city called New Megiddo; founded on the
&gt; banks of the Mississippi in the early 1800s by a religious sect that
&gt; embraced the Book of Revelation with absolute literal certainty. The
&gt; place became a haven for bohemian elements and circus freaks during the
&gt; Depression; the &quot;collection&quot; of a P.T. Barnum-esque character who casts
&gt; a shadow even to this day. Of course, the definition of &quot;freak&quot; is a
&gt; wide one.

&gt; Anyway, think &quot;Good Omens&quot; with a twang and hucksterish, voodoo
&gt; seasoning. Maybe even a dragon or two. And Odin. Never know where he'll
&gt; turn up, simply because I'm a Gaiman dork.
">

Ooh, I like this.

And to make Ralph happy, have you considered looking at it through
something else than d20? nWoD (plus Second Sight, the book for "mortal
magic") seems like it would be perfect for something like this...

&gt; I'm usually left out in most of the discussions, anyway, because I
&gt; prefer first edition AD&amp;D. I guess the main reason I get so crotchety
&gt; about d20 is that some people act like it's the be-all end-all of
&gt; gaming, and that we should convert everything to d20. It has its good
&gt; points, but it's not God's gift to gaming, for cryin' out loud.

Point taken, although I have yet to meet a system of any popularity
that didn't have its religious sect.  ;)

"This unmoderated discussion newsgroup is for discussion of the official rules

including Collector's Edition Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D), Basic D&amp;D, Advanced
Dungeons and Dragons (AD&amp;D), and AD&amp;D Second Edition. This proposed newsgroup
would include discussion of TSR's rules and products and compatible products,
such as: character classes; character races; monsters; magic spells; weapons;
Greyhawk; the Forgotten Realms; the Known World; Dark Sun; Spelljammer;
RavenLoft; Hollow World; City State of the Invincible Overlord; and so on.
Crossposting between this group and other groups in the rec.games.frp hierarchy
is discouraged, however issues of general interest that happen to involve a D&amp;D
rulebook or setting are more than welcome."

First of all, it's out of date, since it refers only to TSR's editions of the
game. If we're strict literalists about the charter, everything ever posted here
about Third Edition D&amp;D is off-topic, and I don't believe we should give that
homophobic cunt Christian Lott the satisfaction.

Second, "official rules and settings of the D&amp;D family of role-playing games" .
. . "discussion of TSR's rules and products and compatible products" inevitably
must include all products based on the d20 System License and the Open Gaming
License. TSR is owned by Wizards of the Coast; Wizards of the Coast's rules
include the d20 System and the OGL system; all d20 products and, broadly, OGL
products are compatible with D&amp;D to some extent; quod erat demonstrandum.

Hell, people use the OGL Mutants and Masterminds to run D&amp;D campaigns!

I've considered it.  It seems made for an extreme fantasy campaign -- no
grittiness here, it's all about mighty heroes and gods walking the
earth.

No doubt.  It was d20 Modern, and then Urban Arcana that started me
thinking up this place, though, so I've been coloring it to suit that
system.  That, and the new-to-gaming players in my group have invested
so much time into learning d20 that I'm just not jazzed about trotting
out something else.  :)

Even so, I confess that I'm curious about Phil Brucato's "Deleria"
game, although from what I've read, many folks use it as inspiration
for modern-fantasy set in some other system.  Anyone seen it? Any
thoughts?
