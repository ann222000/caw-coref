Have America's troubles in Iraq sounded the death knell of
neoconservatism, the political ideology that is said to be behind our
presence there? Over the past year, there has been no shortage of
voices saying so, many with undisguised glee. Abroad, the Times of
London heralded &quot;the end of an ideological era in Washington,&quot; while
the Toronto Globe and Mail reported with satisfaction that
neoconservatism has been &quot;decisively wiped out.&quot; Observers here at
home have agreed. To the historian Douglas Brinkley, Democratic
electoral victories in November 2006 spelled &quot;the death of the
neoconservative movement,&quot; while at National Review Online John
Derbyshire wrote that &quot;all the buzz is that neoconservatism is as dead
as mutton.&quot;

Prognoses from within neoconservatism's ranks have been
correspondingly grim. Kenneth Adelman, an author and sometime defense
official in Republican administrations, has lamented that &quot;most
everything we ever stood for now . . . lies in ruins.&quot; Francis
Fukuyama, in a short book excerpted in the New York Times Magazine,
took leave of his own sometime affiliation with neoconservatism,
protesting that it had &quot;evolved into something that I can no longer
support.&quot; Jonah Goldberg, a columnist at National Review, despaired
that the word neoconservatism itself has become &quot;useless, spent.&quot;

But more than a word is at issue. The opprobrium lately faced by
neoconservatism flows from a number of entwined propositions: that its
ideas shaped President George W. Bush's war against terrorism; that
the ensuing policy has failed disastrously; and that this failure
demonstrates the illusions and delusions embodied in those ideas. This
indictment must either be accepted or answered, and the exercise must
begin by identifying the ideas in question. That requires revisiting
history that has been told before.

_____________

The term &quot;neoconservative&quot; was coined in the 1970's as an anathema. It
was intended to stigmatize a group of liberal intellectuals who had
lately parted ways with the majority of their fellows.

As a heretical offshoot of liberalism, neoconservatism appealed to the
same values and even many of the same goals-like, for example, peace
and racial equality. But neoconservatives argued that liberal policies-
for example, disarmament in the pursuit of peace, or affirmative
action in the pursuit of racial equality-undermined those goals rather
than advancing them. In short order, the heretics established
themselves as contemporary liberalism's most formidable foes.

Two distinct currents fed the stream of neoconservatism. One focused
on domestic issues, specifically by reexamining the Great Society
programs of the 1960's and the welfare state as a whole. It was
centered in the Public Interest, a quarterly founded and edited by
Irving Kristol. The other focused on international issues and the cold
war; it was centered in COMMENTARY and led by the magazine's editor,
Norman Podhoretz.

The former current has little if any relevance to the controversy
surrounding neoconservatism today. Much of the domestic-policy
critique mounted by neoconservatives eventually became common wisdom,
symbolized by President Bill Clinton's welfare-reform program and his
declaration that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; In the meantime,
several of the seminal figures of the domestic wing-Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, Daniel Bell, and Nathan Glazer-drifted back toward
liberalism.

It was the foreign-policy wing that was, all along, more passionately
embroiled in ideological disputation.1 For one thing, the stakes were
higher. If a domestic policy fails, you can try another. If a foreign
policy fails, you may find yourself at war. Also, the battles that
rived the Democratic party in the 1970's, at a time when virtually all
neoconservatives were still Democrats, principally concerned foreign
affairs. These battles sharpened ideological talons on all sides.

The divisions stemmed from the Vietnam war. Not that all
neoconservatives were hawks on this particular issue; some, including
Podhoretz, were (qualified) doves. But when opponents of the war went
from arguing that it was a failed instance of an essentially correct
policy-namely, resisting Communist expansionism-to contending that it
was a symptom of a deep American sickness, neoconservatives answered
back. Whatever problems we may have made for ourselves in Vietnam,
they said, the origins of the conflict were to be found neither in
American imperialism nor in what President Jimmy Carter would call our
&quot;inordinate fear of Communism,&quot; but in Communism's lust to dominate.

Contrary to Carter and the antiwar Left, neoconservatives believed
that Communism was very much to be feared, to be detested, and to be
opposed. They saw the Soviet Union as, in the words of Ronald Reagan,
an &quot;evil empire,&quot; unspeakably cruel to its own subjects and
relentlessly predatory toward those not yet in its grasp. They took
the point of George Orwell's 1984-a book that (as the Irish scholars
James McNamara and Dennis J. O'Keeffe have written) resurrected the
idea of evil &quot;as a political category.&quot; And they absorbed the
cautionary warning of the Russian novelist and dissident Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn against yielding ground to the Communists in the vain
hope &quot;that perhaps at some point the wolf will have eaten enough.&quot;

Many in our history, both statesmen and scholars, had drawn a
distinction between Americans' sentiments and America's self-interest.
Where Communism was concerned, the neoconservatives saw the two as
intertwined. Communism needed to be fought both because it was morally
appalling and because it was a threat to our country.

_____________

For their passion against Communism, neoconservatives were accused of
being &quot;zealots&quot; and &quot;Manicheans.&quot; To this, one neoconservative
rejoined: &quot;we face a Manichean reality.&quot; That is to say, the struggle
between the Communist world and the West involved, on the one hand,
some of the most malign, murderous regimes ever created and, on the
other hand, some of the most humane. The moral consequences were
enormous.

This attitude was one of the things that set neoconservatives apart
from traditional conservatives. To be sure, there were a few
intellectuals of the Right, like William F. Buckley, Jr. and Whittaker
Chambers, who shared the neoconservatives' loathing for Communism. But
mainstream conservatives were better represented by the approach of
Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and their foreign-policy
mentor, Henry Kissinger, according to which the Soviet Union was to be
seen more as another great power than as the vessel of a lethal
ideology; the policy of détente was devised accordingly. This approach
was embraced by such conservative icons as the Reverend Billy Graham,
who hoped to convert Russians to the Gospel, and the capitalist Donald
Kendall, who hoped to sell them Pepsi-without, in either case,
troubling with the issue of their enslavement.

Even those traditional conservatives who distrusted the readiness of
Nixon and Kissinger to make deals with the Soviet Union tended to
share the underlying philosophy of foreign-policy &quot;realism.&quot; As
opposed to the neoconservative emphasis on the battle of ideas and
ideologies, and on the psychological impact of policy choices,
realists focused on state interests and the time-honored tools of
statecraft. That was one reason why, for the neoconservatives of the
1970's, the great champions in American political life were not
conservative or Republican figures but two Democrats of unmistakably
liberal pedigree: Senator Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson and George Meany, the
president of the AFL-CIO. When President Ford, on Kissinger's counsel,
closed the White House door to Solzhenitsyn upon his expulsion from
Soviet Russia, these two stalwart anti-Communists formally welcomed
him to Washington.

It was only with the accession of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in
1981 that the neoconservatives made their peace with Republican-style
conservatism. Reagan brought several neoconservatives-notably Jeane
Kirkpatrick, Richard Perle, Max Kampelman, and Elliott Abrams-into
pivotal foreign-policy positions in his administration (and, on the
domestic-policy side, William J. Bennett and others). With time, most
neoconservatives moved into the Republican fold. As for Reagan's
&quot;belligerent&quot; approach to the cold war, it was criticized as loudly by
both liberals and conservatives within the foreign-policy
establishment as it was cheered by neoconservatives. But there can be
no question that it issued in a sublime victory: the mighty juggernaut
of the Soviet state, disposing of more kill power than the U.S. or any
other state in history, capitulated with scarcely a shot.

1 Irving Kristol is often referred to as the &quot;godfather&quot; of
neoconservatism. Though this may capture his role in shaping the
domestic side, it has been a source of confusion when it comes to
neoconservative ideas on foreign policy. Although outspoken on this
subject, Kristol has more often positioned himself with traditional
conservatives than with other neoconservatives. For example, he
opposed the Reagan policies of supporting anti-Communist guerrillas
and of promoting democracy abroad, on which more below.

political causes, one never hears them attacked by their opponents on
the Right in the anti-Semitic terms used freely by the Left.
