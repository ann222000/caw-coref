Recently, a 20-year-old Bangladeshi Muslim cartoonist sketched a
cartoon that appeared in a Bangla newspaper. It was intended to
caricature the local culture where everyone tends to add &quot;Muhammad&quot;
before their name. In the cartoon, when an elderly Muslim priest asks
a little boy carrying a cat, what was its name; the boy answers,
'Muhammad Cat.' This created outrage among Bangladeshi Muslims. The
leader of Khelafot Andolon (Caliphate Movement) Maulana Ashraf stated
that: &quot;the cartoon indicates disgrace of the Muslim prophet by naming
a cat 'Muhammad'. Similar to the Danish Cartoon incident prophet
Muhammad has been defamed in Muslim majority Bangladesh.&quot; The head
cleric of Bangladesh's National Mosque, said: &quot;This is a grievous
offense, this is dangerous.&quot;

It led to violent protests in Bangladeshi capital, despite a ban on
public demonstrations, under the current military rule. The newspaper
offered immediate apology; so did the cartoonist. Not enough, the
country's entire press community later sought forgiveness of the
people. Still unsatisfied, the protesters demanded closure of the
popular daily, and death of the cartoonist. Obviously, to save the
young cartoonist's life from mob justice, authorities arrested him and
put him in jail on groundless charge of &quot;hurting people's religious
sentiments.&quot; One should be little surprised by this outrage of
Bangladeshi Muslims, as well as those surrounding Muhammad's
caricatures in Danish and Swedish papers, since Prophet Muhammad
himself was ruthless with his critics, especially the poets and
singers, who ridiculed his creed.

Repercussions in Nigeria

Can this Bangladesh cartoon have anything to do with Nigerian
Christians, thousands of miles away in a different continent?
According to a Nigerian news report it led to slaughter of nine
Christians by Muslim mobs in Islam-dominated State of Kano in Nigeria.
There was also widespread vandalism of Christian businesses, homes and
properties, and raging down of churches. The General Secretary of the
Christian Association of Nigeria, Mr Samuel Salifu, said:

&quot;...they (Muslims) saw a cartoon on the internet and they discovered
that this cartoon was drawn by a 20-year-old Muslim boy from
Bangladesh and they decided to visit their anger on innocent
Christians and their churches.&quot;

Salifu Continued:

&quot;They cannot control their anger, they take knives and slaughter. When
you tell them what they are doing is wrong, they will turn round and
start to kill.&quot;

The question is: how could a cartoon, allegedly offensive to Muslims,
drawn in a far-off land--that too, by a Muslim--anger Muslims of Nigeria
to such an extent that they go on killing any non-Muslim come within
their reach?

A similar savagery by Muslims took place in India in 1921 CE. When the
Ottoman caliphate was facing the prospect of collapse, the Muslims of
India, then under British rule, started the Khilafat Andolon
(Caliphate Movement). Its aim was not only to protect the integrity of
the Ottoman caliphate, but also to integrate India into that
caliphate, after ousting the British rulers. And unsurprisingly, our
Mahatma Gandhi happily joined this movement.

However, as the Ottoman caliphate faced a definite collapse, it hurt
and angered Indian Muslims so much that the Mopla Muslims of Malabar
(Kerala) vented their anger upon their Hindu neighbors. They went on a
barbaric spree of killing, rapes and pillage leading to thousands of
deaths and rapes of the Hindus. This episode became known as the Mopla
rebellion. Gandhiji, out of compassion for his Khilafat movement
brethren, quickly forgave the murderers and even embraced the leader
of killers as his brother. But the British rulers caught the
mastermind, and disappointing Gandhi, put him to justice.

It will not be difficult, however, to grasp why Muslims vent their
anger on innocent bystanders and neighbors in such cases, if one
understands the fundamental principles of Islam. Neither are such
incidences anything new. In Islam, just by being a Muslim, one is
obligated to attack and kill non-Muslims without any provocation, or a
hurtful cartoon. Muslims must, by default, attack and kill the
idolaters (Hindus, Buddhists etc.) unless they accept Islam, as
commanded in the Quran:

&quot;But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the
Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie
in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and
establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the
way for them...&quot; [Quran 9.5; Yusuf Ali]

If the Christians and Jews don't accept Islam, Muslims must by-default
fight, kill and enslave them. But for belonging to the so-called
'people of the book' category, they are allowed to retain their faith
if they accept a subjugated and humiliated status to Muslims and
willingly pay Jizya (poll-tax) to Muslims:

&quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that
forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor
acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of
the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel
themselves subdued.&quot; [Quran 9.5; Yusuf Ali]

Muslims' religious obligation is concisely defined by Imam Al-Ghazzali
(d. 1111 CE), the greatest Islamic Sufi mystic and considered second-
greatest Muslim after Muhammad, as follows (Kitab al-Wagiz Fi Fiqh
Madhab al-Imam al-Shafi, Beirut, 1979):

&quot;one must go on Jihad at least once a year... One may use a catapult
against them when they are in a fortress, even if among them are women
and children. One may set fire on them and /or drown them... One may cut
down their trees... One must destroy their useful book (Bible and Torah
etc.).&quot;

Although Muslims do not carry out those religious obligations today,
under Muhammad, they used to put every command of the Quran to
practical application, whereby all idolaters were annihilated from
Arabia before Muhammad's death in 632 CE, while the Hejaz (Southern
Arabia) was denuded of Jews and Christians by the time of second
caliph, Omar (634-644). In order to grasp the depth of Islamic
fanaticism, we have to consider the history of Muhammad's struggle
against the idolaters of Mecca. He, with ~150 converts, relocated to
Medina from his ancestral city of Mecca in 622 CE, because his mission
had become stagnant there. After arrival in Medina, he soon launched
an unceasing war against Mecca, initially by attacking Meccan trade-
caravans one after another leading to a number of bloodletting
battles, causing death of more than a hundred Mecca citizens. The
struggle culminated in prophet's capture of Mecca in 630 CE. He
effaced the vestiges of idolatry from Mecca by revealing verse 9:5
(cited above) in 631 CE.

Here we must consider that the citizens of Mecca were the fathers,
brothers and kinsmen of Muhammad and his Meccan converts, who
emigrated with him. Once they joined the creed of Islam, they broke
all kindred relations, bonds and affection; and eagerly and
aggressively attacked their own kinsfolk causing bloodbaths. Such is
the blood-thirsty rage that Islam can create among its followers.
Unprovoked attack on and slaughter of the infidels remained a dominant
feature of Muslim societies until the pre-colonial era. Oppression of
non-Muslims continues in post-colonial days in repressed forms in all
Islam-dominated societies.

Let us consider two more examples. One such example was the case of
Abdullah Ibn Obayi, a powerful leader of Medina, who had converted to
Islam, but consistently opposed Muhammad's excessive cruelty. He had
successfully prevented Muhammad from slaughtering the Jewish tribe of
Banu Qainuqa in 624, while his similar intervention in the attack of
the Banu Quraiza Jews was ignored by Muhammad in 627, when Abdullah
had become too weak. Muhammad slaughtered 800-900 surrendered Jews en
masse. Because of his opposition to Muhammad's cruelty, i.e. dubious
loyalty to Muhammad, he is repeatedly called 'hypocrite' in the Quran.
Abdullah's son had become a devoted follower of Muhammad and was so
enraged by his father's faltering loyalty to Muhammad that he sought
Muhammad's permission to kill his own father. But Abdullah was a
powerful leader and Muhammad, always judicious in such matters,
resisted the temptation.

The second incidence was the killing of Jewish merchant, ibn Sunayna.
After arriving in Medina, Muhammad sought to draw the Jews to Islam
and wanted they accept him as their prophet. The Jews not only
rejected his exhortations, but also became a nuisance to his mission
through their criticism and ridicule of many of the inconsistencies of
Muhammad's creed. Exasperated, Muhammad gave following open order
(July 624): &quot;Kill any Jew that falls into your power&quot; [Ibn Ishaq, The
Life of Muhammad, Karachi, p369]. Muhayyisa was a Jewish convert to
Islam from ibn Sunayna's own tribe and his family depended on the
merchant for sustenance. After this order of Muhammad, Sunayna
happened to fall on the way of Muhayyisa. The latter, ignoring tribal
bonds and material help of the merchant, fell upon Sunayna and killed
him.

The assassin's elder brother Huwayyisa, angered by such brutal murder
of someone on whom their family depended for livelihood, confronted
the killer saying, &quot;You enemy of God, did you kill him when much of
the fat on your belly comes from his wealth?&quot; Muhayyisa answered, &quot;Had
the one (i.e. Muhammad), who ordered me to kill him, ordered me to
kill you I would have cut your head off&quot; [Ibn Ishaq, p369]. This
brutal rage of the younger brother impressed Huwayyisa so much that he
said, &quot;By God, a religion which can bring you to this is marvelous&quot;
and immediately, converted to Islam.

These stories tells us what kind of appeals attracted early Muslims
and what kind of murderous rage the Islamic creed can incite among it
followers even against their nearest kinsmen. When no offense on the
part of ibn Sunayna or just the rejection of Muhammad's creed by Mecca
citizens could incite Muhammad's followers to raise swords and soak
them with the blood of their kinsmen, one should be little surprised
by what has taken place in Nigeria.

Muslims are definitely frustrated by international treaties and
obligations which prevent them from unleashing--what is divinely
required of them--on the world's five billion infidels. When further
anger is added by offensive cartoons like this to their perennial pent-
up frustration, what do they do? Muslims are supposed to follow the
ideals of Muhammad to live a perfect life and to book a seat in
Islamic paradise. They have definitely civilized themselves a lot from
the Muhammad's age and time. They do those things now only rarely and
at least with the excuse of one provocation or another.
