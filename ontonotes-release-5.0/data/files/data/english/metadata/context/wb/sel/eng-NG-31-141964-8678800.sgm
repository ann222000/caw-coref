YouTube Magic:
Now You See It,
Now You Don't
Hired Eyes Make Sure
That Copyrighted Videos
Are Yanked From the Web

By KEVIN J. DELANEY
August 8, 2007; Page A1

LOS GATOS, Calif. -- A lot of people watch YouTube videos at work. A
few are actually paid to do it.

A former bartender named Joe Bersik sits in front of a flat-screen
monitor about eight hours a day, pulling up Internet videos. His job
is to find pirated material and get it taken off the Web.

Mr. Bersik works at BayTSP Inc., an eight-year-old start-up with big
clients like Viacom Inc., the parent of MTV Networks. BayTSP employs
more than 20 video analysts -- sometimes called &quot;hashers&quot; -- who watch
videos looking for copyright violations.

Tethered to his computer by headphones, Mr. Bersik on a recent day
played the music video of R&amp;B singer Akon's hit song &quot;Don't Matter&quot; on
YouTube. The logo of the MTV Jams TV channel was visible at the bottom
of the clip. The 53-year-old Mr. Bersik watched for a minute then
fired an alert to a colleague who sent an email requesting that
YouTube take it down.

In about two hours, the video was gone.

Mr. Bersik and the eight men around him staring at monitors are
playing a cat-and-mouse game with the people who post copyrighted
clips on the Web. Working from a leafy office park on the fringes of
Silicon Valley, they are key players in the legal battle over Internet
copyrights between Viacom and Google Inc., which now owns YouTube.

Viacom last fall asked BayTSP to keep a running log of clips from the
cartoon show &quot;South Park&quot; and other Viacom programs that people had
posted on YouTube. In February, Viacom gave the signal to fire off a
barrage of &quot;take-down&quot; notices: In a single batch of emails on Friday,
Feb. 2, BayTSP requested that YouTube remove more than 100,000 Viacom
clips, in a procedure outlined in U.S. copyright law. The clips Mr.
Bersik and others identified were cited in Viacom's $1 billion
copyright suit filed against Google the following month. The New York
media company says it pays more than $100,000 a month to BayTSP, to
find infringing videos and have them removed from YouTube and other
sites.

BayTSP says it has more than five TV and movie-studio clients but for
contractual reasons can't disclose names other than Viacom. The
closely held company says it bills clients as much as $500,000 a month
to track down illegal copies of software, music and video clips. Every
month it sends out more than a million take-down notices.

Other companies have started using automated technology to identify
video clips so they don't have to employ a room full of people
manually scanning them as Bay TSP does. YouTube, which says it
complies with copyright laws by removing clips when their owners
request it, is testing technology to keep infringing videos off its
site in the first place. BayTSP thinks human beings will always be
needed if only to inspect automated results.

&quot;There will always be something that falls into the gray area,&quot; says
BayTSP CEO Mark Ishikawa, 42, who is also an active race-car driver.
The company and Viacom have faced criticism for mistakenly requesting
the takedown of noninfringing clips such as parodies and home videos,
though BayTSP says its error rate on Web videos is only around 0.1%.

It's in an open, white-walled room close to Mr. Ishikawa's race-car
machine shop at BayTSP's headquarters that Mr. Bersik and the other
video analysts sit side-by-side combing through clips looking for
clients' content. Movie posters with mustaches drawn on actresses'
faces and other defacements hang above the desks.

The analysts use special software to scan the new clips posted to
YouTube and other video sites a few times a day, creating lists of
potentially infringing ones. They can use a separate program to
conduct searches for keywords -- such as &quot;Laguna Beach&quot; or character
names -- on the sites and either flag a clip for takedown or clear it
to stay up.

On a recent day, their manager, Eric Antze, pulled up a clip from
Comedy Central's &quot;Chappelle's Show&quot; that one of his colleagues had
identified. &quot;This is clearly copyright infringement,&quot; said Mr. Antze,
26, as the video began playing on YouTube. He clicked &quot;Send&quot; in a
BayTSP software program running on his other monitor, triggering the
email delivery to YouTube of a takedown request. When YouTube receives
such emails, employees review them and then remove the clips. Mr.
Antze, who was a part-time teacher until he started at BayTSP in
November, has a sheet showing the logos of Viacom's various TV
channels taped to his monitors.

He says BayTSP has had more than 230,000 clips, which users had viewed
more than two billion times, removed from YouTube for Viacom alone.
When the Viacom takedowns crossed the 150,000 mark, BayTSP bought
better chairs and desks for the analysts.

People who post videos use tricks to make it harder to locate them.
Some deliberately misspell the names of shows or films to thwart
searching. With music videos, they sometimes include the word &quot;remix&quot;
in the title, because the media companies often will let videos
altered by users stay. Users often figure out and try to work around
the rules BayTSP's clients set for what they want taken down.

The users also remain persistent in finding ways to upload videos
again each time they're removed. &quot;By the time I send notices and take
them down, they'll be reposted,&quot; says Justin Hernandez, 27, who
focuses on finding feature films for a BayTSP client.

The part-time DJ says he thought the video-analyst job was &quot;too good
to be true&quot; when a friend who works at BayTSP told him he could get
paid to watch online videos all day. Analyst salaries start at around
$11 an hour. Perks include subsidized 25-cent sodas.

BayTSP's analysts say they don't tell friends and family exactly what
they do, because they sign agreements not to disclose specifics of
their work or the media-company clients. Scott Martine, 26, says his
vagueness has led friends to suspect he is in the pornography
business.

Mr. Bersik tells people he works for an Internet security company. The
amateur guitar player, who has worked here since January, spends much
of his time taking down music videos recorded off Viacom's MTV and
other music channels. He keeps a dogeared copy of the Billboard music
charts printed each Tuesday in USA Today on his desk to give him ideas
for songs and artists he should search for.

Some analysts complain of tired eyes, and the tedium of watching the
same clips over and over. &quot;The novelty of 'Oh great, I get to look at
YouTube videos all day' -- that wears off real quick,&quot; says Mr.
Martine, who has worked at BayTSP since January. &quot;Are you prepared to
watch a million videos over and over again?&quot; Mr. Antze asks job
applicants.

The men, mostly in their 20s, play basketball in the parking lot
during a 3 p.m. break each day. They combat the monotony by passing
links to quirky clips around the office. One recent oddball favorite
was a video of a flamboyant German disco-era group performing in
Genghis Khan-inspired outfits.

The analysts generally say they have little appetite for YouTube
outside of work anymore, however. &quot;By the time I'm done working on it
for eight hours, this is the last site I want to go to,&quot; says Mr.
Antze.

Because YouTube touts this as a website where users can create their
own content (akin to Geocities), they put the legal burden on the
posters (members), to stay within the letter of the local, state,
federal and international laws.

But my thought is 'this is intentional' and as long as the website
allows people to post videos over a specific byte size, you are going
to have this.  The idea behind this site, was to have 'others' create
your content.. content that is sure to pull in the crowds, to click
those banner ads that are everywhere... which in turn, make the
company money.

It is a very old scheme, and what the companies that are complaining
need to do, is squeeze You Tube to enforce compliance by mandating
that they REQUIRE approval of each and every multimedia file that is
posted.  This is what alot of bulletin boards do, even CNN's, they
moderate them.

You Tube would not do this, because they are using the loops in
Internet Laws to skirt around what is their responsibility and what is
the responsibility of the posters.

I think that if legislation tightened up rules regarding 'monitoring,
and screening' and put this burden on the company (or be fined hard)
then it might keep sites such as this from profiting off piracy.

I cannot feel bad for You Tube if mandatory approval of all multimedia
files were required, because they created this site to do exactly as
it is doing, and anyone that falls for their innocent 'batting of
eyes' and their 'oh we cannot stop them from posting - what to do -
what to do'.... then that person is very naive.
