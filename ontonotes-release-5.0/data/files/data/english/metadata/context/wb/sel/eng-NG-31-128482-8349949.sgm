&gt; The Republicans are definitely basing their whole election drive on
&gt; Anti-Illegal-Immigration. Obviously that's very good for us, finally
&gt; having one of the major parties doing that (either party would do, but
&gt; it would never have been the Democrats). This was also made very clear
&gt; by the vote of the GOP in Wash today to openly break away from Bush
&gt; and the RINO party leadership on Illegals. Not to mention the RINO
&gt; Presidential candidates and scared Senators suddenly changing their
&gt; tune on Amnesties ...

Just a few weeks ago one national Internet figure -- who in the
process has become quite a hero to many Americans who'd never even
heard of him before -- made public the home addresses of the SENATE
TRAITORS who at the time planned to do nothing less than &quot;Terry
Schiavo&quot; America, which has virtually been on life support for some
time.

Which put the fear of God into said SENATE TRAITORS, who then had to
decide what was more important to themselves and their loved ones:

A. Screwing over Middle America like they'd never screwed it before

or

B. Jeopardizing what they themselves hold most important on a very
*personal* level.

The SENATE TRAITORS voted wisely, I'd say, because I truly believe
that, had the ILLEGAL ALIEN AMNESTY NIGHTMARE passed, the USA could
very well have entered a phase of TOTAL ANARCHY, with surely hundreds
of thousands if not actually millions of INCENSED Americans working BY
ANY MEANS NECESSARY to right the terrible wrong that the SENATE
TRAITORS had done to them and regain ownership of their country.

Having said that, I nonetheless STILL suspect that the only way that
we, the American People, are going to be able to solve the present
shameless situation in which over 25 million lawbreaking foreigners --
many, many, many of whom are quite literally among the most dangerous,
most violent criminals on Earth (try reading a California newspaper --
even a small-town one -- some time for proof!) -- is via actions which
have VERY EFFECTIVE, VERY PERMANENT effects.

Our enemies -- and make no mistake: ANYONE who not only okays but
downright *ENCOURAGES* foreigners who make a mockery of America's laws
with their very first steps inside the country, and who even fly Old
Glory upside-down and *under* the flag of Mexico (and there are LOTS
of photos of repeated instances of this illegal alien atrocity
viewable online!) to sneak into the USA is our sworn ENEMY -- from the
very outset are engaging in RUTHLESS, UNPRINCIPLED behavior just as
much as others would be were they, for example, to encourage people to
rob and plunder others' homes.

Personally (and I emphasis that this is *my* *personal* *opinion*) I
WOULD RATHER SEE AMERICA DESTROYED* THAN TO LET IT REMAIN IN THE HANDS
OF THE AXIS OF THE ELITES AND THEIR PET ILLEGALS.

Why?

Here's why, by way of a story:

Let's say a man built a house,a very good house. In fact, it was SO
good that it was the envy of the entire neighborhood; no, it was
actually the envy of the entire city, it was THAT good. Now, after
several years of living in this house (again, a house which the owner
himself built) people not only from a different neighborhood but a
different CITY began breaking into it almost at will almost every day,
covetous to enjoy its shelter and comforts but unwilling to make the
effort to build their own such houses in their own city.

After they saw that the local police weren't doing anything to
increase patrols on the street where the nice house was located, the
rapidly-increasing numbers of robbers became so brazen that they
actually began leaving notes for the homeowner; notes warning him that
he'd better start leaving some of his most valuable property out for
them to steal &quot;if he knew what was good for him.&quot;

Finally, the intimidated homeowner returned home to his house from
work one day and, while his only worry on his drive home that
afternoon had revolved around deciding which of his valuables to leave
out for the following day's expected voracious robbers, he now instead
discovered that the locks in all the doors of the house had been
changed _by_the_brazen_robbers_themselves_ -- robbers who now partied
raucously within the structure, which they now considered to be
*their* house. (After all, the city's cops never bothered them earlier
when they were breaking into it in droves, right? And many, many years
ago didn't the distant ancestors of a handful of the robbers -- so
they claimed -- live on/near the very same land the man would later
build his fine house on?) But now the &quot;robbers&quot; were, for all intents
and purposes, the &quot;owners,&quot; and the new &quot;owners&quot; quickly began
covering the home's once-immaculate floors with piles of trash and
damaging its walls and windows with their uncontrolled behavior -- and
now the man couldn't even get inside of &quot;his&quot; house.

The legal owner of the house begged for the city's governmental
officials to assist him. He pleaded. He reminded them of what a
responsible, law-abidng, taxpaying citizen he'd always been. All to no
avail. In fact, in some cases the officials to whom he'd just pleaded
for help laughed in his face, asking him why he didn't &quot;get it&quot; that
it was precisely BECAUSE he was always such an &quot;obedient, responsible,
law-abidng, taxpaying citizen&quot; that they now felt &quot;empowered,&quot; as they
put it, to tell him to go to hell.

The &quot;obedient, responsible, law-abiding, taxpaying citizen&quot; gave the
matter much thought. Ultimately, he concluded that he was going to do
whatever he could to get his once-wonderful, respected and envied
house back &quot;by any means necessary&quot; -- even if it meant that the house
itself was ultimately destroyed in the process.

He thought back to a time when, as a boy, he used to watch an old
sculptor in the park perform magic with just a block of stone, a
hammer and a chisel. One day while watching, though, he sensed that
the sculptor's demeanor was unusually serious. &quot;Why are you so tense
today,&quot; he asked. The old man explained that a criminal, knowing how
valuable his sculptures were but unwilling to make the effort to learn
how to make his own, had tried to steal the artwork he'd been close to
completing. The old sculptor chased the thief, who dropped the
unfinished sculpture, but it was seriously cracked in the process.

After an interminable effort to save the unfinished work of art, and
as the boy watched incredulously, the old sculptor picked up a
sledgehammer and smashed the unfinished -- and now irredeemably-marred
-- object into pieces.

Finally, the shocked boy found the strength to ask the old sculptor,
&quot;But ... why?&quot;

The old man answered thusly, he now recalled:

&quot;I have been long known as an artist who insists on quality being
the hallmark of my work. I tried -- God how I tried! -- to 'fix' the
situation caused when that would-be thief tried to steal my work,
which he would then surely sell -- after all the blood, sweat and
tears I'd put into it! -- for a small fortune. In the end, though, I
realized that, unfortunately, it couldn't be saved and, rather than
discard it (which would leave the thief free to retrieve it from the
garbage and then falsely claim it was merely a lesser-quality example
of my work or, God forbid, even try to pass it of as his *own*
creation and sell it for a fraction of what it might have cost before
it was damaged, I decided that it was far preferable to destroy it and
be done with it. You see, my child, THE THEIF CANNOT BRING ANOTHER
WORK OF ART LIKE THAT INTO EXISTENCE, BUT I NOT ONLY CAN BUT WILL --
AND YOU CAN BE SURE THAT I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON ...  *THIS TIME* I'LL
MAKE SURE THAT NO OPPORTUNISTIC CRIMINALS CAN EVER GET THEIR FILTHY
HANDS ON IT!&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And conversely, the Dems are doing these Extreme Violations reported
&gt; above, doing them right on the floor of our national legislature in
&gt; order to assist Illegals Aliens. Dirty tricks behind doors and under
&gt; the table is bad enough, but that's something they've done up there
&gt; for over 200 years. This is something else altogether, you never do
&gt; the particular thing they did here in public. They are going to pay a
&gt; serious price for this Anti-American Activism of theirs. They are
&gt; trodding routes that they've gotten away with taking for the last 20
&gt; years or so with RINOs skipping along beside them. But things changed
&gt; when the Senate Amnesty crashed and these Dems have not updated their
&gt; motis operandi.

&gt; If the Republicans do FINALLY realize what a powerful, irresistable
&gt; bludgen this Illegals issue is, there will be a bloodbath... Nobody
&gt; can resist an easy kill. Democrats layed out flat in the hundreds and
&gt; RINOs hiding in the men's washroom with trembling hands.

&gt; Strange to say, Ted Kennedy and the Republican Traitors in the US
&gt; Senate may have done us a great favor by trying to ram through their
&gt; Destroy America bill, they proved something about us that these
&gt; politicians needed to know.

(*I do not advocate &quot;the destruction of America&quot; or engaging in any
illegal acts, nor do I plan to engage in such acts. I DO, however,
unabashedly refer to the wise words of guidance thankfully bequeathed
to us by the Founders of our country, some of which I've quoted
below.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------
WHAT WOULD THE FOUNDING FATHERS DO? ...

If the representatives of the people betray their constituents,
there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original
right of
self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of
government ... The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without
concert,
without system, without resource; except in their courage and
despair ... The natural strength of the people in a large community,
in
proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater
than in a small, and of course more competent to a struggle with the
attempts of the government to establish a tyranny ... the people,
without exaggeration, may be said to be entirely the masters of their
own fate.

-- Alexander Hamilton

The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain
occasions, that I wish it always to be kept alive.

-- Thomas Jefferson

The will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any
government, and to protect its free expression should be our first
object.

-- Thomas Jefferson

We in America do not have government by the majority. We have
government
by the majority who participate.

-- Thomas Jefferson

All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good
conscience to
remain silent.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the
people
alone. The people themselves are its only safe depositories.

-- Thomas Jefferson

In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of
principle, stand like a rock.

-- Thomas Jefferson

No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.

-- Thomas Jefferson

The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to
keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves
against tyranny in government.

-- Thomas Jefferson

As our enemies have found we can reason like men, so now let us
show
them we can fight like men also.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Don't talk about what you have done or what you are going to do.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Every citizen should be a soldier. This was the case with the
Greeks
and Romans, and must be that of every free state.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will
delineate and define you.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Merchants have no country. The mere spot they stand on does not
constitute so strong an attachment as that from which they draw their
gains.

-- Thomas Jefferson

I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied
corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a
trial
by strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country.

-- Thomas Jefferson

I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our
liberties
than standing armies.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Experience demands that man is the only animal which devours his
own
kind, for I can apply no milder term to the general prey of the
rich on the poor.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms of government
those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations,
perverted it into tyranny.

-- Thomas Jefferson

&quot;The Illegal-Alien Crime Wave&quot; by Heather MacDonald

&quot;The federal issue of border security quickly becomes
a local one when feds refuse to enforce the law. Local
law enforcement agencies in Everytown, USA are
forced to respond.&quot;
-- Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch www.JudicialWatch.org

&quot;Unfortunately, the majority of illegal aliens who are here are
engaged in criminal activity. Identity theft, use of fraudulent Social
Security numbers and green cards, tax evasion, driving without
licenses represent some of the crimes that are engaged in by the
majority of illegal aliens on a daily basis merely to maintain and
hide their illegal status. In addition, violent crime and drug
distribution and possession is also prevalent among illegal aliens.
Over 25% of today's federal prison population are illegal aliens. In
some areas of the country, 12% of felonies, 25% of burglaries and 34%
of thefts are committed by illegal aliens.&quot;

-- Testimony of District Attorney John M. Morganelli before the
House Subcommittee on Immigration, Border, Security and Claims [Note:
99% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles, California -- the USA's 2nd
most-populous city -- are for illegal aliens]

&quot;It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate,
tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of  freedom in
the minds of men.&quot;
