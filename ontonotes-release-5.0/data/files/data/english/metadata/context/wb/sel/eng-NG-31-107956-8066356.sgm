200 People Busted For Alcohol-Related Offenses On The Little Miami River
Last Update: Jul 8, 2007 2:26 AM

Close to 200 people fall victim to a sweep on the Little Miami River. Officials
in Warren County were targeting alcohol-related offenses, from open containers
to underage drinking. The operation left many people drying out and forced to
pay a hefty fine.

Many people were feeling the heat, and not because of the temperature. The main
objective of this operation is not to ruin activities but to make sure the
Little Miami River can be a fun place for the whole family.

Out of sight and undercover, officers from several agencies were looking to put
a stop to a common problem. There's a little too much drinking on the Little
Miami River. Area residents living around the river complained of rude and
obnoxious behavior, enough that something had to be done.

The Sackriders, a local family, agree with Warren County officials who say
alcohol and the river don't mix. Most were upset to get ticketed, in over a few
hours authorities handed citations close to 200 people.

The violations ranged from underage drinking to littering and life jacket
violations. Some people on canoes got stopped more than once for the most
popular offense, having an open container. The goal of the crackdown is to make
sure the river is a friendly place for local families to make a splash. Dozens
of empty beer cans were picked up in the seven-hour sweep

Meanwhile, on the water Chris and Rebecca Sackrider will stick to drinking
water. There will be another similar sweep in the near future, but officials in
Warren County are not saying when.

Oh jiggers the cops are comin
Why can't they leave us alone
Keep paddlin while I'm dumpin
No beer in Ohio.

Gotta get done with it
Swallow the evidence down
Should have been done long ago
There's my whole six pack
Soaking into the ground
A case woulda been quite a blow

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, (etc)

Oh jiggers the cops are comin
Why can't they leave us alone
Keep paddlin while I'm dumpin
No beer in Ohio
No beer in Ohio
(how many more?)
No beer in Ohio
(will I have to pour?)
No beer in Ohio

There are some darn good reasons not to drink while boating. The
skipper really needs to blow zero. Passengers who become intoxicated
are more likely to wind up in the water and will be less able to
assist in their own or some other person's rescue. Studies have shown
that the marine environment tends to increase the effects of alcohol.

Still, that said, busting people for having an open can of beer
anywhere aboard a boat seems extreme. The news bit didn't imply that
all or even any of the boaters were legally intoxicated. A town big
enough to turn out 45 cops (to write a total of 200 beer-related
tickets) has to have a mayor, city council, etc. I guess we can all be
sure that when the politicians all gather for a party on the mayor's
yacht that there will be no open containers or consumption of alcohol
anywhere aboard.

Some boaters have and enforce a no-alcohol policy aboard their boats.
I'm not opposed to a guest having a beer or a glass of wine, within
moderation. As long as the operator waits until the boat is at its
final destination for the day before imbibing, the cops shouldn't be
busting beer. Public intoxication, lewd or rowdy behavior, public
urination, etc, deserve to be ticketed and should be.......but even if
it's borderline unwise a non-operating adult shouldn't be ticketed for
holding a can of beer on a boat.

Especially on a canoe which is in no possible way a &quot;motor vehicle&quot;.

Depends on how the local law is written of course but I'd like to see
them fight it out in court.

Subtle distinction: The government sweep didn't target drunks, the
tickets were handed out to people caught with an open bottle of beer
in a boat. If it's 100 degrees, 3-4 guys are out fishing, and somebody
other than the person operating the vessel pops open a beer that
shouldn't be considered a crime. It may be unwise, but if the boat
operator isn't drinking at the helm it's merely a questionable
practice and not a crime. IMO.

There's a difference between having a beer on a summer afternoon and
being a &quot;drunk&quot;.

I thought Carrie Nation and Temperance Unions were ancient history.
Good thing they didn't catch one of the canoeists or kayakers smokin a
doobie.....if beer warrants a ticket those uptight puritans would
probably lynch somebody found with a joint.

No wonder the entire world seems to be moving to the west coast! :-)

You can't drive a car on the highways legally with an open container of
booze. I doubt you could ride a bike doing so, either. But driving a
boat with open containers of booze visible is ok?

I have heard you say many times, that you have had a beer on a boat on

People (not an individual person) often get irresponsible and out of
control when alcohol is involved. I've seen it ruin many a perfectly
good, responsible and happy a festive time where many individuals are
enjoying alcohol responsibly.

People SUCK! Remember? We see many instances of this sucky behavior
all the time. Many instances involve alcohol too, unfortunately. Ruins
the good responsible time for the rest of us, yano? :-(

What the hell is a doobie? Is it one of those new designer drugs?
Does it give you the feeling that Kansas and Nebraska are closing in on the
left coast.
Good to see you a little closer to the fusilage than ol' HK, at least on
this issue. There may be redemption for you yet.

&gt;&gt; You can't drive a car on the highways legally with an open container
&gt;&gt; of booze. I doubt you could ride a bike doing so, either. But driving
&gt;&gt; a boat with open containers of booze visible is ok?

&gt; I have heard you say many times, that you have had a beer on a boat on
&gt; hot summer day, and that you allow others to drink on your boat, you
&gt; just don't allow them to get drunk.  Is that ok with you?

Harry, as usual is incorrect, there are states that it is still legal to
do so

All in all, I don't allow any alcoholic beverages on my boat. Most of
my friends don't drink, and the ones that do don't give me any hassle
about my &quot;rule&quot;.

Carylyle Lake does a pretty good sweep a couple times a year too. They
don't get wild about &quot;open seal&quot; though, but when none of the boats
occupants can pass the breath blower, then things get interesting.

And it does happen.

How many of the people who responded actually read (and understood) the
article?
Apparently not many.

This is NOT about people &quot;driving&quot; a vehicle.
Canoes appear to be the boats in question
This is NOT about general boating laws.

This is a quiet, scenic, river that has a special &quot;no alcohol allowed&quot; law
in this area.
They are trying to keep this a &quot;family friendly&quot; area near a state park.
The idea is that it is much easier to enforce a blanket no alcohol policy
than to try to chase down the problem people or have probably cause to
individually check id's on people who are drinking to check their age.

I don't know the details of the river but expect that it is similar to a few
of them around here where people go to kick back while canoeing or tubing.
They are slow, shallow, wide enough to not be difficult but narrow enough to
easily wade across.

You would need to be really wasted (like not be able to stand up) to be in
significant danger on them.

The Cannon (near Cannon Falls, MN) is longer, the primary activity is using
a canoe barely faster than drifting, and the activities are very quiet.

The Apple (near Somerset, WI) has a very different reputation.  The water
has a small &quot;rapids&quot; at the end of the commonly used zone.

Googling for &quot;apple river&quot; wisconsin alcohol family, brought this up as the
2nd result.

WARNIING: NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY

The primary activity is tubing.  You park your butt in an inner tube and
drift along the river.
There are campgrounds along the river that have tube rental and some people
go there to party with their underage friends and/or get REALLY drunk and
obnoxious.

From what I have heard, it used to be a lot worse than it is now.  The local
people decided that things were getting out of hand and convinced the county
sheriff's department to spend some time cracking down on: underage drinking,
public drunkenness, public sex acts, and littering.  There are warnings
about this and you are supposed to pay a deposit on every container you
leave with.

I have been down it several times in the last 15 years and never saw
significant nudity but saw a number of obnoxious drunks.  We generally have
a cooler in it's own tube and have a 2-4 beers in the few hours it takes to
drift through the trees.  More fun that soaking in a hot tub.
Usually the tubes are tied together into a raft and whomever is towards the
front gives a quick (and sometimes surprised) call of &quot;butts up&quot; to warn
people about a rock near the surface.

&gt; People (not an individual person) often get irresponsible and out of

&gt; enjoying alcohol responsibly.

&gt; People SUCK! Remember? We see many instances of this sucky behavior
&gt; all the time. Many instances involve alcohol too, unfortunately. Ruins
&gt; the good responsible time for the rest of us, yano? :-(

It's a little more complicated than that.

The combination of alcohol and sun can lead to dehydration - even one
can cause the effect if one hasn't taken precautions by drinking
non-caffinated beverages like water or a sports drink.  Even one 12
ounce can of beer can do the trick - in particular if somebody hasn't
eaten or had some water along the way.

If you are just sitting on your house deck, drinking a beer and eating
a burger, that's not going to create a problem as such.

On a boat, that's a whole different story.  Movement, wind, the
accelerated dual effect of direct sun and reflected sun can dehydrate
you in short order.  Add 12 ounces of beer, it's possible that you can
have or be a problem in short order.

The sad thing is you won't even know it until it happens.  All of a
sudden, exhaustion sets in.  A cold beer sounds gppd and the effect in
compounded.

When I was active with the local Vollies, I've seen it happen a number
of times on local lakes - I only had one beer.

Never doubted it for a second.  :&gt;)

Not the issue and I'm surprised that you would make such a statement.

An open container law bans an open container of alcohol in the
passenger compartment of a vehicle and/or boat. The goal is to stop
people from drinking and driving, it almost goes without saying that
an open container law should stop people from drinking WHILE driving.

And that's really the issue - drinking while driving and boating.

You ought to check our own state's Open Container law then because
it's one of the more drastic ones in terms of fines and effects.

The definition of vehicle is: Any means in or by which someone travels
or something is carried or conveyed; a means of conveyance or
transport.  Vehicles that do not travel on land can be properly
referred to as &quot;craft&quot;.  Crafts are still vehicles.

That's a good point.

Unless there is a law against public consumption.

You have to be careful with absolutes.

Technically, Connecticut is not in compliance with the Federal Open
Container requirements, but if an open container in found in a vehicle
in the course of a vehicle/traffic stop, a field sobriety and/or BAT
is required of the driver.

That was a recent change and I believe of the 13 states that are not
compliant have similar laws.

I agree.

CT is an odd state with quite possibly the most moronic legislature in
the 50 states second only to RI and/or MA. You would think that they
would be all over this, but curiously they aren't.

Yeah, many state parks and public beaches have &quot;No Alcoholic Beverages

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have heard you say many times, that you have had a beer on a boat on
&gt;&gt;&gt; hot summer day, and that you allow others to drink on your boat, you
&gt;&gt;&gt; just don't allow them to get drunk.  Is that ok with you?

&gt;&gt; People (not an individual person) often get irresponsible and out of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drinking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; water. There will be another similar sweep in the near future, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; officials in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Warren County are not saying when.

&gt;&gt;&gt; People (not an individual person) often get irresponsible and out of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Close to 200 people fall victim to a sweep on the Little Miami
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; River. Officials
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in Warren County were targeting alcohol-related offenses, from open
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; containers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to underage drinking. The operation left many people drying out and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; forced to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pay a hefty fine.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many people were feeling the heat, and not because of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; temperature. The main

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sure the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Little Miami River can be a fun place for the whole family.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Out of sight and undercover, officers from several agencies were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; looking to put
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a stop to a common problem. There's a little too much drinking on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Miami River. Area residents living around the river complained of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rude and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obnoxious behavior, enough that something had to be done.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Sackriders, a local family, agree with Warren County officials
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who say
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alcohol and the river don't mix. Most were upset to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ticketed, in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hours authorities handed citations close to 200 people.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The violations ranged from underage drinking to littering and life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jacket
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; violations. Some people on canoes got stopped more than once for

In New Mexico it's illegal to drink alcohol &quot;in the public view&quot;.  You

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hours authorities handed citations close to 200 people.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The violations ranged from underage drinking to littering and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jacket
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; violations. Some people on canoes got stopped more than once

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; popular offense, having an open container. The goal of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; crackdown

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drinking

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have heard you say many times, that you have had a beer on a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; boat on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hot summer day, and that you allow others to drink on your boat, you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just don't allow them to get drunk.  Is that ok with you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; People (not an individual person) often get irresponsible and out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control when alcohol is involved. I've seen it ruin many a perfectly

By this statement, I should be able, as a passenger in a car, to hoist
my open can of brew in a salute to the Fuzz in the next lane. Care to
estimate how long it would take for him to hit the skids, and swoop in
on the 6 O'clock for the kill? I'm not sure you know it, but there IS an
open container law here in Washington. Please explain the legal
difference between a boat and a car in this scenario.

&gt; Yeah, many state parks and public beaches have &quot;No Alcoholic Beverages

It wouldn't be a lifeguard arresting you.  If they are like Minnesota, the
state parks and larger park systems have their own police officers and the
others can bring in the local authorities quickly.

However, they have better things to do than bust people for alcohol unless
they are causing a problem.

While on a camping trip at a state park, we had a group site (secluded, away
from the main sites).  We went for a late night hike and talked with a state
park ranger along the way.  He casually asked if we had any alcohol, then
said that if we did, we shouldn't carry it around (we wouldn't anyway) or be
overly loud.

I volunteer with a local (Three Rivers Park District) park district.  The
&quot;park patrol&quot; is around for information and first aid.  After appropriate
training, we use the trails (skate, bike, hike, ski) and watch for people
who need assistance.  Usually it is just to help people figure out where
they are or where something is.
However, if we see a problem, we will call the dispatcher for the park
police.

There are some important differences between cars and boats.
In most states it's also illegal to operate your car unless everybody
is in a seat belt and normally a shoulder harness. Would you propose a
similar restriction for boats?

A car is nothing more than vehicle of conveyance, while a boat can be
simultaneously a conveyance and a means of accommodation.

I don't suggest the skipper should be drinking underway, but busting
the skipper seated up on the flybridge because a guest down in the
salon is having a cold beer or a glass of Merlot on a summer afternoon
is way over the top.

Good thing there's no actual crime in Ohio, thereby freeing 45 of the
local cops to spend an afternoon preventing the consumption of beer on
the Little Miami river.

I don't spend a lot of time thinking about booze and boats, Chuck. So
far this year, I've had two beers, and both were consumed in my den
after spending four hours mowing my lawn and field. I have one friend
who is an alcoholic. When he comes aboard, I restrict his cooler to two
beers. Maybe once or twice a year, I have a beer on board, but only
while anchored or in a slip.

I don't believe the case you cited involved drinking a glass of wine in
the salon.

&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; 200 People Busted For Alcohol-Related Offenses On The Little Miami

&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; Last Update: Jul 8, 2007 2:26 AM
&gt; &gt; | &gt;
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; Close to 200 people fall victim to a sweep on the Little Miami River.
&gt; &gt; Officials
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; in Warren County were targeting alcohol-related offenses, from open
&gt; &gt; containers
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; to underage drinking. The operation left many people drying out and
&gt; &gt; forced to
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; pay a hefty fine.
&gt; &gt; | &gt;
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; Many people were feeling the heat, and not because of the temperature.
&gt; &gt; The main
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; objective of this operation is not to ruin activities but to make sure
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; Little Miami River can be a fun place for the whole family.
&gt; &gt; | &gt;
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; Out of sight and undercover, officers from several agencies were
&gt; &gt; looking to put
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; a stop to a common problem. There's a little too much drinking on the
&gt; &gt; Little
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; Miami River. Area residents living around the river complained of rude
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; obnoxious behavior, enough that something had to be done.
&gt; &gt; | &gt;
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; The Sackriders, a local family, agree with Warren County officials who
&gt; &gt; say
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; alcohol and the river don't mix. Most were upset to get ticketed, in
&gt; &gt; over a few
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; hours authorities handed citations close to 200 people.
&gt; &gt; | &gt;
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; The violations ranged from underage drinking to littering and life
&gt; &gt; jacket
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; violations. Some people on canoes got stopped more than once for the
&gt; &gt; most
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; popular offense, having an open container. The goal of the crackdown
&gt; &gt; is to make
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; sure the river is a friendly place for local families to make a
&gt; &gt; splash. Dozens
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; of empty beer cans were picked up in the seven-hour sweep
&gt; &gt; | &gt;
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, on the water Chris and Rebecca Sackrider will stick to
&gt; &gt; drinking
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; water. There will be another similar sweep in the near future, but
&gt; &gt; officials in
&gt; &gt; | &gt; &gt; Warren County are not saying when.

&gt; &gt; | Subtle distinction: The government sweep didn't target drunks, the
&gt; &gt; | tickets were handed out to people caught with an open bottle of beer
&gt; &gt; | in a boat. If it's 100 degrees, 3-4 guys are out fishing, and somebody
&gt; &gt; | other than the person operating the vessel pops open a beer that
&gt; &gt; | shouldn't be considered a crime. It may be unwise, but if the boat
&gt; &gt; | operator isn't drinking at the helm it's merely a questionable

&gt; &gt; What the hell is a doobie? Is it one of those new designer drugs?
&gt; &gt; Does it give you the feeling that Kansas and Nebraska are closing in on the
&gt; &gt; left coast.
&gt; &gt; Good to see you a little closer to the fusilage than ol' HK, at least on
&gt; &gt; this issue. There may be redemption for you yet.
&gt; &gt; |

&gt; All in all, I don't allow any alcoholic beverages on my boat. Most of
&gt; my friends don't drink, and the ones that do don't give me any hassle
&gt; about my &quot;rule&quot;.

And it should indeed be the skipper's privilege to formulate an
alcohol policy for his or her boat. And it would be for the best if
more boaters had a policy similar to yours......but should it be a
*crime* to allow a guest to enjoy a beer while underway? I think not.

&gt; It's a little more complicated than that.

&gt; The combination of alcohol and sun can lead to dehydration - even one
&gt; can cause the effect if one hasn't taken precautions by drinking
&gt; non-caffinated beverages like water or a sports drink.  Even one 12
&gt; ounce can of beer can do the trick - in particular if somebody hasn't
&gt; eaten or had some water along the way.

&gt; If you are just sitting on your house deck, drinking a beer and eating
&gt; a burger, that's not going to create a problem as such.

&gt; On a boat, that's a whole different story.  Movement, wind, the
&gt; accelerated dual effect of direct sun and reflected sun can dehydrate
&gt; you in short order.  Add 12 ounces of beer, it's possible that you can
&gt; have or be a problem in short order.

&gt; The sad thing is you won't even know it until it happens.  All of a
&gt; sudden, exhaustion sets in.  A cold beer sounds gppd and the effect in
&gt; compounded.

&gt; When I was active with the local Vollies, I've seen it happen a number
&gt; of times on local lakes - I only had one beer.

&gt; Never doubted it for a second.  :&gt;)

&gt; &gt;I thought Carrie Nation and Temperance Unions were ancient history.

&gt; Not the issue and I'm surprised that you would make such a statement.

&gt; An open container law bans an open container of alcohol in the
&gt; passenger compartment of a vehicle and/or boat. The goal is to stop
&gt; people from drinking and driving, it almost goes without saying that
&gt; an open container law should stop people from drinking WHILE driving.

&gt; And that's really the issue - drinking while driving and boating.

&gt; &gt;No wonder the entire world seems to be moving to the west coast! :-)

&gt; You ought to check our own state's Open Container law then because
&gt; it's one of the more drastic ones in terms of fines and effects.
">

I agree that it's questionable to allow people to drink on board, but
there's a sliding scale of risk that effectively decreases as the size
of the boat increases. Those large charter and sightseeing boats run
non-stop bars. Booze was easily available on our recent cruise ship
vacation 24 hours a day. 2400 passengers, most of them drinking at
least a little bit every day for a week straight and some almost non-
stop, and not a single incident where the safety of the vessel was
compromised or the risk of going overboard was dramatically increased.

I offer again my example from earlier in this thread. Joe Doaks has a
party of guests out for an afternoon cruise. Joe isn't drinking, and
in fact he's piloting the boat from the flybridge. Down below in the
salon, Mrs. Doaks is serving Margaritas to a couple guests of legal
drinking age. Is Joe Doaks a criminal? Should he be hauled into court
and made to answer for his behavior? In many states, certain boating
offenses cross reference to your vehicular driving license, so should
stone sober Joe's car insurance be cancelled or his premiums be
doubled because somebody else on his boat (well out of reach of the
skipper) had an alcoholic beverage?

Last year at our Seafair hydroplane races the Seattle cops did one of
these mass arrest deals. They had to rent portable jails to lock up
everybody they were processing. The difference was, the Seattle cops
where targeting people exhibiting drunken behavior  (not merely people
who might be having a beer while watching the hydroplane races). The
Seattle cops also focused on underage drinkers.

I've always like the European approach to alcohol. In many societies
it's common to serve beer to school kids, and entire families often
enjoy a drink together. The difference is that becoming publicly
intoxicated is a very serious screw up, and getting caught DWI will
typically result in very serious punishment even for &quot;first
offenders&quot;.

That's just law enforcement grandstanding to &quot;appear&quot; they are doing
something... gee? Who put out the press release???   heh

Silly sheeple.

Last night we had we had a &quot;fireworks party&quot; out at the T41 &quot;Beer Can
Island&quot;.  It took me 13 minutes to get there on plane at 7pm....   it took
me 1.5 hours to get home trolling at 1200 rpm at 12:30AM with a BAC of
between .08 and .10.

I'm *very* hesitant to plane the boat out at night in the dark anyway,
because I'm afraid some drunk fisherman will have his lights off.  But I
never **EVER** go above troll if drinking. For one thing, the marine patroll
doesn't bother inobtrusive trolling people... and further it's just not
safe... and yes I wore my PFD to pee off the swim platform - just in case.
:)

I'm very aware and very sensitive to drunk boaters - my cousin was
(famously) killed by one in NH on a Memorial Day weekend. But that *doesn't*
mean my sence of right and wrong change with the wind of public opinion.  A
drinking boater or a canoe at NO speed can't really hurt a fly. The possible
exception being *themselves* if they fall in the water and drown... and I
don't want Big Brother Nanny interfering with good old fashioned Darwinism.
:)

I have no problem with little boats (and pontoons) running at &quot;headway
speed&quot; with a load of beer and good old boys with fishing poles aboard.
HOWEVER...  I'm all for throwing the book at BUI's up on plane.   All the
Marine Patroll has to do is look for &quot;strange behavior&quot;  in order to get the
real assholes off the water. Not some bullshit PR stunt, a &quot;sweep&quot; like that
is waste or resources and money.  (but it looks good in print)

Personally... after the last few days... I think the flaming idiots who run
a tube side to side in the travel channels are the worst problem. I've had
**way** too many chances to contribute to Darwinism by running thier
sniveling offspring on a rope over.  I'll take a **trolling** drunk any day
over those child endangering assholes.

-W

W: Charlie.... kill the stereo and start the motor.  please.
C: WHY???
W: Because I see a boat comeing up way too fast for 3AM, and I'm afraid he's
even drunker than we are (if that's even humanly possible).  I just wanna be
ready to get TF out of his way if he's too blind to see our anchor light.
You can kill it again when he's gone by us....

Heh - as much as I would like to debate this with you, I would do so
from a position of extreme weakness.

I once asked a local legislator just how much time was spent on
debating the necessity of any particular piece of public safety
legislation vs considering the financial aspect of any particular
piece of public safety legislation.

He said the revenue portion (that's exactly how he put it - not
penalty/fine portion) is about 50% of any legislative debate when it
comes to public safety.

I'd lose the argument before we even got started.  :&gt;)

Depending on the state, the definition of &quot;public highway&quot; can be considerably broader, including parking
lots, and private driveways.  The following is for New York:

SWF,
There are many states where it is legal to have an open container in a
boat, as long as the driver is below the legal limit.  If they come up
to the boat while it is underway, it is easy to see who is behind the
wheel, if they are at anchor, they just ask who is the driver.

I have been stopped for a safety check after having a beer, and have
never had them ask me to blow into anything, I guess I either didn't
have any smell of alcohol on my breath, or they can tell the difference
between one beer and 6.

Today, I don't bring any beer on board, but would allow a passenger to
bring some as long as they limited their consumption so they will be
below the legal limit at the end of the day.  I don't want anyone to be
driving home drunk.  I figure a beer an hour will keep someone below .08.

Now there's another consideration.

When I was running SWS semi-full time, the rule was no alcohol onboard
- period.  I even turned around and returned to the dock when one
client brought some orange juice on board spiked with vodka.  (By the
way, don't believe it when they tell you vodka doesn't smell - its
does).

Now when we returned to the dock, that was another story.  Break out
the case of beer kept on ice in the slip's storage locker and let's
sit back and talk over the trip.  I always kept an eye on that though
because of the very reason you stated - I didn't want anybody driving
home intoxicated.

It seems to me that there are a number of different ways of looking at
this open container law.
