There are two classical characters named Bathyllus.

One was a boy loved by ANACREON,
apparently in rivalry with Polycrates tyrant of Samos
(6th century BC: Horace Epodes14.9-10).

The other was a dancer (pantomimus) from Alexandria
with homosexual influence over Maecenas
(first century BC: Tacitus Annals 1.54).

Neither of these was a writer or dealer in literary works.

They both had a homosexual reputation
and the second was a stage performer.

ANACREON'S GRAVE. - Goethe

HERE where the roses blossom,
where vines round the laurels are twining,
Where the turtle-dove calls, where the blithe cricket is heard,
Say, whose grave can this be, with life by all the Immortals
Beauteously planted and deck'd?--Here doth ANACREON sleep
Spring and summer and autumn rejoiced the thrice-happy minstrel,
And from the winter this mound kindly hath screen'd him at last.

&lt;&lt;Believe it or not. . . the original version of the national anthem of the United States. . . is a drinking song written for a British social club. Apparently, the melody was well-know in the colonies and was often given new sets of words, such as the poem written by Francis Scott Key during the Battle of Baltimore (1814) - i.e., the version the U. S. now recognizes as its national anthem. It iss also surprising for many to find out that the SSB did not become the official anthem of the U. S. until March 3, 1931. Criticized as a violent song of war by pacifists, as a drinking tune by prohibitionists, and as too difficult to sing, the SSB faced stiff competition from &quot;America,&quot;&quot;Yankee Doodle,&quot;&quot;Hail Columbia,&quot;&quot;My Country, 'Tis of Thee,&quot;&quot;Columbia, Gem of the Ocean,&quot; and &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic.&quot;

&lt;&lt;&quot;The song To ANACREON in Heaven was written for the ANACREONtic Society founded in 1766 by a 'sprightly class of citizens' who met once a fortnight at the London Coffee-House on Ludgate Hill, eventually moving to the Strand. The society's legendary patron was the Greek lyric poet ANACREON (ca. 570-478 BC), whose love and drinking songs, according to [traveler] Dr. [Charles] Burney, 'were distinguished by their... voluptuous gaiety.' The club's motto was: 'Here sadness were a sin.' &quot;The text of To ANACREON in Heaven was submitted in 1770 by the club's president, Ralph Tomlinson, and set to music in 1771 by John Stafford Smith (1750-1836), an organist, composer, and tenor.

Plot Summary

&quot;In the text, the 'sons of harmony' (a.k.a.. society members) appeal to ANACREON for inspiration, and he agrees to help them enjoy the mingling of love (the &quot;myrtle of Venus&quot;) and drink (the fruit of &quot;Bacchus' vine&quot;). Up on Mount Olympus, old thunderous Jove objects, arguing that if these mortals have so much fun, the goddesses will not be able to resist them, and, in fact, they are already abandoning Parnassus for Rowley's (the liquor merchant on Ludgate Hill), as are Apollo (the &quot;yellow-hair'd god&quot;) and his nine muses. Apparently the gods too are succumbing, because Idalia (Venus' temple) and the &quot;bi-forked hill' (Olympus) are nearly deserted. Apollo pleads with Jove in Latin not to bother with his thunder, saying 'these thunderclaps are avoidable, you know' and offering to protect the club and its members from his 'crackers.' Momus, the god of mockery and ridicule, then threatens to join Apollo, imploring Jove not to be 'jealous of these honest fellows'; Jove relents, and swears by the river Styx that the club shall long entwine love and drink.&quot; (Paraphrased from liner notes of Musical Heritage Society 512415X written by Kenneth Cooper.)&gt;&gt;

&quot;To ANACREON in Heaven&quot;

Text by Ralph Tomlinson (1770);
Music by John Stafford Smith (1771)

To ANACREON, in Heav'n, where he sat in full glee,
A few sons of harmony sent a petition,
That he their inspirer and patron would be;
When this answer arriv'd from the jolly old Grecian-

Voice, fiddle, and flute.
No longer be mute;
I'll lend ye my name, and inspire ye to boot:
And besides, I'll instruct ye, like me, to intwine
The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine.
The news through Olympus immediately flew;
When old Thunder pretended to give himself airs-
If these mortals are suffer'd their scheme to pursue,
The devil a goddess will stay above stairs.

Hark! already they cry,
In transports of joy,
A fig for Parnassus! To Rowley's we'll fly;
And there, my good fellows, we'll learn to intwine
The myrtle of Venus with Bachus's vine.

The yellow-hair'd god, and his nine fusty maids,
To the hill of old Lud will incontinent flee,
Idalia will boast but of tenantless shades,
And the biforked hill a mere desert will be.

My thunder, no fear on't,
Will soon do its errand,
And dam'met I'll swinge the ringleadsers, I warrant.
I'll trim the young dogs, for thus daring to twine
The myrtle of Venus with Bachus's vine.

Apollo rose up: and said, Pr'ythee ne'er quarrel.
Good king of the gods, with my vot'ries below!
Your thunder is useless-then, shewing his laurel,
Cry'd, Sic evitabile fulmen, you know!

Then over each head
My laurels I'll spread;
So my sons from your crackers no mischief shall dread,
Whilst snug in their club-room they jovially twine
The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine.

Next Momus got up, with his risible phiz,
And swore with Apollo he'd cheerfully join-
The full tide of harmony still shall be his.
But the song, and the catch, and the laugh shall be mine:

Then, jove, be not jealous
Of these honest fellows.
Cry'd jove, We relent, since the truth you now tell us;
And swear, by Old Styx, that they long shall entwine
The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine.

Ye sons of ANACREON, then, join hand in hand;
Preserve unanimity, friendship, and love.
'Tis your's to support what's so happily plan'd ;
You've the sanction of gods, and the fiat of love.

While thus we agree,
Our toast let it be.
May our club flourish happy, united, and free!
And long may the sons of ANACREON intwine
The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine.
