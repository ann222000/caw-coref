FAT PEOPLE SUCK!!  http://arlo4pres.tripod.com/fatpeople.html

Sure some may say that this title is mean, but hey they do. Nothing
ruins my day more than seeing a fat person walking around. They are
really sick and nasty! Who wants to see someone who obviously doens't
care enough about themselves to get slimmer. When i am talking about
fat people i am not talking about chubby people or big boned people, i
am talking FAT. I mean the people that you see int he hall and say
&quot;GOOD GOD THAT PERSON IS FAT!&quot; these people should have to get into
shape.

It is true as well that america has the most fat people, go to china,
how many fat people are there? Not alot, why do we have to have all
the fat people? I am not sure, maybe in other countries they just kill
all the fat people! Or maybe it is because people in america do not
care enough to get off their lazy arses and do something. And some may
say that this is insensitive and that fat people are people
nonetheless, but you people do this as well. Whether it is to their
face or just behind their back, everybody does it except the fat
people. That are my views on fat people.

I have pity for poor shlubs who cover up a lack of self-esteem by
finding and pointing out superficial faults in others.

Anger, stress, and worrying overmuch about things you have no control
over causes health problems which could lead to an untimely death, you
know. I wish you cared enough about yourself to improve your stress
levels and be a healthier person.

Fat People Suck by The King Posted 11.18.2003

http://www.makemeking.com/home/articles/58/Fat_People_Suck.html

I have a problem with fat people. Whenever I look at someone who is
obese I get this bottled up rage inside of me. Don't ask why or how. It
just happens. Nothing makes me more sick than seeing a fat person with
a positive self-image about themselves. When fat people think they're
cool or the shit I get this uncontrollable aggression where I want to
rip them limb from limb. The kind where you just walk up and punch them
right between their squinty &quot;fat&quot; eyes. I have come to realize that
there are several different types of fat people. Now don't get me
wrong. I would never want to stereotype fat people, however, here is a
list of how all fat people are. Each fat person has at least one of
these characteristics in them:

1. The Social Fat Guy - This is the guy who tries to be the life of the
party. The guy in the Hawaiian buttoned down dress shirt that's not
tucked in. These guys are very eager to fit in. If you ever need some
quick cash ask to borrow money from them. They will never ask to be
paid back in fear that it might upset you.

2. Fat Person With A Crush - This is the person (usually female) who
tries to get attention by making it very public who they have a crush
on. Whether the crush involves someone they actually know or a
celebrity they act like they are madly in love with them (Think Rosie
O'Donnel and Tom Cruise before she turned dyke). They tend to flirt
very heavily with guys way out of their league.

3. The Fat Friend - This is the very sensitive fat person with lots of
friends of the opposite sex. The majority of these friendships form out
of pity. I happened to see two different occasions of this at lunch
today. This obese guy was eating with two girls obviously out of his
reach. Same with this huge fat bitch who sat down at this guy's table
and made him eat with her. They were only one table apart and I
couldn't help but think, &quot;These two would make the perfect couple&quot;.
Another classification commonly used for these type of obese
individuals is called the &quot;Great Personality Friend&quot;.

4. The Fat Person In Denial - These are normally males who still hold
the notion that they are big-boned or never lost their baby fat. They
just don't understand...but we do.

5. The Fat Girl Who Wears Skinny Girls Clothing - This is by far the
most troubling characteristic a fat person could carry. Some fat
females take it upon themselves to push the limits. They like to wear
tube tops, short skirts, and other skimpy clothing that reveals their
abnormally sized body. The epitome of this is when a girl wears a shirt
that shows her belly button ring while simultaneously showing every
fucking cupcake and hoho this girl has eaten in her life. If looking at
her doesn't repulse you enough just remember girls like this are
scientifically known to carry more STD's. They also tend to wear pants
so tight that the little flap on the front flips over and you can see
every notch of the zipper holding on for dear life before it explodes
at the seam.

6. The &quot;On A Diet&quot; Fat Person - This is the type of fat person who
orders two Super-Sized Big Mac's with cheese, large fries, and a large
diet coke. They claim to be on a diet yet you never notice a difference
in their appearance. They order a salad for lunch and then consume
5,365 calories at dinner alone.

If you see a fat person, your best option is to remind them how fat
they are at least twice a day. Destroying their self-confidence and
ridiculing them is a very productive weight loss technique in which you
are actually helping them in the long run. Keep in mind that fat people
also think it's funny when you mumble under your breath when they order
their meals. Just make sure you avoid any sympathy directed towards
them because it's their own damn fault they're fat plus it will
encourage them to stay fat.

Funny thing. When I was a fat person, nothing made my day more than
ruining some moron's day just by existing and not caring enough to lose
those extra pounds. I honestly hope that a memory of me made you puke
in your pillowcase. If not me, then hopefully some other obese person
who deserves better than your obnoxious scorn. I can't decide what is
more sad; the obesity crisis in America or the fact that fat and
homosexual remain acceptable prejudices by the majority of americans
while idiocy goes unpunished and even rewarded.

PS- &quot;that are my views&quot; on you and your ilk. MUHAHAHAHA!

Observer,

There is an obvious difference between your average homosexual adult
and a child molester. If you can't tell the difference between
consenting adults and felony rape, mores the pity. If you believe that
all homosexuals are child molesters, you are sadly misinformed. Either
way, I can't sympathize with a child molester, hetero or homosexual,
cleric or lay person.

"/> Alright Hollywood, your response to that question was a reasonable one
although it does appear that the percentages of the male homosexual
population that are child molesters is far greater than that of the
heterosexual male population. Flagrant promiscuity is another story
altogether. The gay couple who live down the street and have led a
long-term quiet life relationship with each other doesn't bother me in
the least. . Now the next question; does your desire to see
homosexuals regarded in a more favorable way extend to the many who
loiter around public men's rest rooms obviously &quot;on the prey&quot;. I
know of a road side rest stop that had to be closed by the highway
department because this problem was so severe.

While the OP obviously was baiting everyone here, your response and the
response above you are very telling. Rather than addressing the chance that
the OP might have a basis for his post and arguing with his point of view,
you both chose to attack HIM personally, though you know nothing about him.
Refusal to recognize that there IS an overweight epidemic is the main
problem and it only serves to worsen things. So go ahead, keep attacking
the messenger. Feel better.

There is also an epidemic of stress and related mental and emotional
problems, evidenced by the alarming rise in prescriptions of
anti-anxiety medications, which also causes major health problems. Even
though stress problems often don't have physical signs everyone can see
like weight problems do, they are no less serious. I just found it
ironic that the OP was choosing to react to overweight people in such a
way as to potentially cause himself medical problems, when his complaint
about fat people is that they are sick and don't care enough about
themselves to be healthy. So, because others are sick, he's making
himself sick by choosing to obsess over the bad choices others make.

And, I wasn't attacking him. I used the exact same reasoning he used
about fat people not caring enough about themselves to get thin to point
out he was also endangering his own health. Which he is.

Okay, Here we go.

http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html
This article has a nice bibliography that addresses the myth that gay
people are more likely to be child molesters. The FACT is that straight
guys are more likely to molest their own daughter. The &quot;appearance&quot; to
the contrary is probably a result of what makes news. A guy rapes his
own daughter, and the outcry is private, the story is not that unusual.
A gay person molests a child and it's big news.

I know straight people who are flagrantly promiscuous. Should they be
denied basic civil liberties? That's a very Victorian notion, and while
I understand that a lot of the US would be happy seeing a new Victorian
era (I do live in Missouri, where they like that stuff, but couldn't
really articulate it if you asked them), I don't think that how much
booty you score should relate to the number of rights you get.
Likewise, I don't think how much some frat guy scores should impair the
number of rights I, a married straight guy, should get. If you think
about this in terms of straight people's rights, I think it becomes
clear.

I think that the rest room kind of deal is a sad comment on society. In
a better world, gay people wouldn't be driven to cruise for sex in rest
stops. They could cruise for sex in bars in the city, like everyone
else, without fear of anything outside of what everyone else fears
going to a bar.

I can sum up my beliefs like this. I think that gay people are people
too. They should get the same rights as anyone else. That includes the
right to fuck up and go to prison for criminal activity. I go with the
Supreme Court on this. If they are in their homes, not bothering
anyone, rock on. If people are out in public places having sex,
straight or gay, bust em with a ticket, or whatever we deem is the
proper punishment. But to have a double standard is stupid and
shortsighted. And that's what all of your questions are essentially
about. You are coming up with circumstances where I wouldn't support
the rights of a homosexual or a heterosexual. In the norm, I think
rights should be rights and people should be people. Except the Irish.
(KIDDING!).

Wasn't the original point that Captain Blubberslap has a problem with
seeing fat people? That it ruins his day? If he changes his attitude
and stops obsessing about it, problem solved. He will lead a longer,
happier, healthier, more productive life. Or, if he simply cannot stop
obsessing, perhaps he could start a health campaign where he works.
Petition to get soda machines and snack machines removed from the office
lounge and replaced with healthier options, or start a lunchtime walking
or jogging group, or a weekend sports league of some sort. Or he could
volunteer at a school or church to run an after-school fitness club to
help prevent the younger generation from getting fat. There are
probably many more options for positive things he could do with his time
to help combat America's obesity problem.

&gt; Wasn't the original point that Captain Blubberslap has a problem with
&gt; seeing fat people? That it ruins his day? If he changes his attitude
&gt; and stops obsessing about it, problem solved. He will lead a longer,
&gt; happier, healthier, more productive life. Or, if he simply cannot stop
&gt; obsessing, perhaps he could start a health campaign where he works.
&gt; Petition to get soda machines and snack machines removed from the office
&gt; lounge and replaced with healthier options, or start a lunchtime walking
&gt; or jogging group, or a weekend sports league of some sort. Or he could
&gt; volunteer at a school or church to run an after-school fitness club to
&gt; help prevent the younger generation from getting fat. There are

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is also an epidemic of stress and related mental and emotional
&gt;&gt;&gt; problems, evidenced by the alarming rise in prescriptions of
&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-anxiety medications, which also causes major health problems.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Even
&gt;&gt;&gt; though stress problems often don't have physical signs everyone can see
&gt;&gt;&gt; like weight problems do, they are no less serious. I just found it
&gt;&gt;&gt; ironic that the OP was choosing to react to overweight people in such a
&gt;&gt;&gt; way as to potentially cause himself medical problems, when his
&gt;&gt;&gt; complaint
&gt;&gt;&gt; about fat people is that they are sick and don't care enough about
&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves to be healthy. So, because others are sick, he's making
&gt;&gt;&gt; himself sick by choosing to obsess over the bad choices others make.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And, I wasn't attacking him. I used the exact same reasoning he used
&gt;&gt;&gt; about fat people not caring enough about themselves to get thin to
&gt;&gt;&gt; point
&gt;&gt;&gt; out he was also endangering his own health. Which he is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ruins my day more than seeing a fat person walking around. They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really sick and nasty! Who wants to see someone who obviously
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doens't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; care enough about themselves to get slimmer. When i am talking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fat people i am not talking about chubby people or big boned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people, i
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am talking FAT. I mean the people that you see int he hall and say
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;GOOD GOD THAT PERSON IS FAT!&quot; these people should have to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shape.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is true as well that america has the most fat people, go to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; china,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how many fat people are there? Not alot, why do we have to have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the fat people? I am not sure, maybe in other countries they just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all the fat people! Or maybe it is because people in america do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; care enough to get off their lazy arses and do something. And some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; say that this is insensitive and that fat people are people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nonetheless, but you people do this as well. Whether it is to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; face or just behind their back, everybody does it except the fat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people. That are my views on fat people.

&gt; Your premise that fat people are generally happy because of their

"/> Who said fat people were generally happy? I dont think these groups are
&quot;general&quot; anything. But Im not sure that any of the groups he posted to
would be helped much by his post. I also didnt say thin people are
stressed.

The original post does seem to have the purpose of stressing people
about their weight. And dieticians have begun to swing toward a more &quot;do
a few things to be healthy&quot; than a &quot;you are too fat and should diet&quot;
direction because there are now some papers trying to decide whether
weight or stress is worse. (very different of course from happily
dieting, or from any reference to medically obese)

I think that some people are arguing a &quot;point&quot; that I didnt see in the
original post.

Well, what a post! You must be proud of yourself?

Life has a funny way of repaying us for all the negitivity we put out.
I can only assume that your repayment was perhaps in the form of a small
penis?
Don't feel bad - everyone has their faults, however, a small penis is
unfortunate I
must say.

I AM NOW GOING TO IMPLANT SOMETHING INTO YOUR BRAIN
THAT I VOW TO YOU - YOU WILL NEVER FORGET! MAY IT EAT
AWAY AT YOU UNTIL YOU'VE PAID YOUR DUE!

Expect BAD karma from the information that your publishing.
BAD KARMA YOU WILL RECEIVE.....say it with me.....

&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

And just when you think you have it out of your head - it will pop back in
when you least expect it.

Anyway, that's it from me! May all of the other wonderful members (not you
of course blubber....Bad Karma I will receive) of this group share in
happiness &amp; great joy. Keep up the good work!

&gt; I can only assume that your repayment was perhaps in the form of a small
&gt; penis?
&gt; Don't feel bad - everyone has their faults, however, a small penis is
&gt; unfortunate I
&gt; must say.

&gt; I AM NOW GOING TO IMPLANT SOMETHING INTO YOUR BRAIN
&gt; THAT I VOW TO YOU - YOU WILL NEVER FORGET! MAY IT EAT
&gt; AWAY AT YOU UNTIL YOU'VE PAID YOUR DUE!

&gt; Expect BAD karma from the information that your publishing.
&gt; BAD KARMA YOU WILL RECEIVE.....say it with me.....

&gt;&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&gt;&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&gt;&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&gt;&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&gt;&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&gt;&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&gt;&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&gt;&quot;Bad Karma I will receive&quot;

&gt; And just when you think you have it out of your head - it will pop back in
&gt; when you least expect it.

&gt; Anyway, that's it from me! May all of the other wonderful members (not you
&gt; of course blubber....Bad Karma I will receive) of this group share in
&gt; happiness &amp; great joy. Keep up the good work!

&gt; Em

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is an obvious difference between your average homosexual
adult
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and a child molester. If you can't tell the difference between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;consenting adults and felony rape, mores the pity. If you believe
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all homosexuals are child molesters, you are sadly misinformed.
&gt; Either
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;way, I can't sympathize with a child molester, hetero or
homosexual,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cleric or lay person.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Hollywood

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alright Hollywood, your response to that question was a reasonable
one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; although it does appear that the percentages of the male homosexual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; population that are child molesters is far greater than that of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heterosexual male population. Flagrant promiscuity is another story
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; altogether. The gay couple who live down the street and have led a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; long-term quiet life relationship with each other doesn't bother me
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the least. . Now the next question; does your desire to see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; homosexuals regarded in a more favorable way extend to the many who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; loiter around public men's rest rooms obviously &quot;on the prey&quot;. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know of a road side rest stop that had to be closed by the highway
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; department because this problem was so severe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Observer,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is an obvious difference between your average homosexual
&gt;&gt; adult
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and a child molester. If you can't tell the difference between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;consenting adults and felony rape, mores the pity. If you
believe
&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all homosexuals are child molesters, you are sadly misinformed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Either
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;way, I can't sympathize with a child molester, hetero or
&gt;&gt; homosexual,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cleric or lay person.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alright Hollywood, your response to that question was a
reasonable
&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; although it does appear that the percentages of the male
&gt; homosexual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; population that are child molesters is far greater than that of
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heterosexual male population. Flagrant promiscuity is another
&gt; story
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; altogether. The gay couple who live down the street and have led
a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; long-term quiet life relationship with each other doesn't bother
&gt; me
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the least. . Now the next question; does your desire to see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; homosexuals regarded in a more favorable way extend to the many
&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; loiter around public men's rest rooms obviously &quot;on the prey&quot;.
&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know of a road side rest stop that had to be closed by the
highway
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; department because this problem was so severe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Funny thing. When I was a fat person, nothing made my day
more
&gt;&gt;&gt; than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ruining some moron's day just by existing and not caring
&gt; enough
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lose
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those extra pounds. I honestly hope that a memory of me made
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; puke
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in your pillowcase. If not me, then hopefully some other
obese
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; person
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who deserves better than your obnoxious scorn. I can't
decide
&gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more sad; the obesity crisis in America or the fact that fat
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;homosexual remain acceptable prejudices by the majority of
&gt;&gt;&gt; americans
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;while idiocy goes unpunished and even rewarded.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does your empathy for the homosexuals include all the
Catholic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; priests
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have been praying (preying) upon little boys?
