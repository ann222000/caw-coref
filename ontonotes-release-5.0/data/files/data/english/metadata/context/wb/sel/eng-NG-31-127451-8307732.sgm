Former Gov. Mitt Romney attacked Sen. Barack Obama yesterday for
purportedly wanting sex education in kindergarten.

It turns out, Romney himself once indicated support for the same sort of
sex-ed approach - &quot;age-appropriate&quot; - that Obama backs.

In a Planned Parenthood questionnaire he filled out during his 2002
gubernatorial run, Romney checked ‘yes’ to a question asking, &quot;Do you
support the teaching of responsible, age-appropriate, factually accurate
health and sexuality education, including information about both
abstinence and contraception, in public schools?&quot;

Obama wants such sex education to begin with Kindergarten; Romney never

that no sex education is age-appropriate for 5-year-olds.

•  I used to occasionally babysit Emily, a friend's 4-yr old after she
came home from pre-school.  Emily loved to discuss which boys in
pre-school were &quot;hot&quot; and which were not.  I was shocked.  Up until then I
had doubted Sigmund Freud's conclusion in his 1908 book Three Essays on
the Theory of Sexuality.   In it, Freud expressed the opinion that
children were sexual beings. He also reached some conclusions about the
sexual victimization of children that affronted many holy men. Freud's
biographer, Ernest Jones, said that Three Essays on the Theory of
Sexuality brought down more odium than any of Freud's other writings. Much
of the odium was vented from pulpits by rabbis and by priests.

Mitt's comments strike me as decidedly hypocritical when viewed within
the context of some of Mormonism's remarkably unhealthy attitudes
toward children and sex.

For example, within the Mormon Church children are typically baptized
when they turn eight years old (sometimes later, but not before).
Part of the process involves a &quot;worthiness&quot; interview in which the
local bishop -- an untrained lay member/leader of the local
congregation -- &quot;interviews&quot; the child.  Part of the interview process
involves questions about masturbation.

Depending upon the bishop (lay members with no training who lead local
congregations) young children who fondle their private parts might be
required to go through a process of &quot;repentance&quot; before they can be
baptized.

Mormonism's preoccupation with masturbation is pervasive, with
children being given periodic interviews throughout life.  Those
children engaging in masturbation are required to go through a process
of &quot;repentance.&quot; Some of the LDS advice to children for controlling
sexual urges is positively draconian.  Here's a link to a talk I
remember hearing when I was a young man in the LDS Church:

http://www.moonmac.com/Mormon_masturbation.html

This issue becomes even more applicable when you consider the fact
that Mitt Romney has served in leadership positions in the LDS church
that would have involved him asking these sorts of questions.  Imagine
Mr. Romney sitting at his desk asking a pretty teenage girl if she
plays with her private parts.  Is this Presidential material?

Given the harmful attitude of his church, and his personal behavior
(as a leader in that church) regarding human sexuality and how this
affects children, Mitt Romney really has no room to badger Obama about
the far more benign *age* *appropriate* sex education that he has
proposed.

According to Mormon doctrine, a child under the age of 8 can't sin, and
receiving baptism is an act of repentance anyway. Therefore, Duwayne's
bit about an 8yo kid being required to repent in such a way before
baptism would only be the case if the presiding authority was going
contra church doctrine.

Right you are.  However sound your logic is though, kids are
interviewed by the bishop prior to baptism--at least I was.  I don't
believe I was interrogated about masturbation until I was 12 so I
could baptise the dead ;)

You're right, David.  Your statement is hardly a surprise.  It's your
standard method of operation -- when faced with issues you cannot
substantively deal with -- to simply assert that the other guy &quot;shows
a profound lack of knowledge about Mormon doctrine...&quot;

No evidence.  No references.  Just that naked Bowie assertion we've

And where would any good LDS apologetic argument be without a strawman
appeal to Bill Clinton?

If Bill was chasing skirts does that have anything to do with
unhealthy sexual attitudes in the LDS Church and Mitt Romney's
participation?

&gt; According to Mormon doctrine, a child under the age of 8 can't sin, and
&gt; receiving baptism is an act of repentance anyway. Therefore, Duwayne's
&gt; bit about an 8yo kid being required to repent in such a way before
&gt; baptism would only be the case if the presiding authority was going
&gt; contra church doctrine.
">

First point:  Children &quot;under the age of 8&quot; are not baptized in the
LDS Church.  David certainly knows this, so I'm not sure why he'd make
that part of his argument, except for the general observation that
Mormon apologetics is often based upon public denials and lying about
what the church teaches.

Second point:  Repentance is most assuredly a prerequisite to
baptism.  I'm not sure if David's ever read the Book of Mormon, but if
he'd pick it up and search it he'd find the phrase &quot;repent and be
baptized.&quot;  Here's an example:

Moroni 8: 10 Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teach --
repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of
committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent and be
baptized, and humble themselves as their little children, and they
shall all be saved with their little children.

Notice that repentance is a prerequisite to baptism.  This doctrine is
clearly taught (in many different places) in the D&amp;C, too.

This is really basic doctrine, and I can see no excuse for David's
misrepresentation on this point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This issue becomes even more applicable when you consider the fact
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that Mitt Romney has served in leadership positions in the LDS church
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that would have involved him asking these sorts of questions.  Imagine
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Mr. Romney sitting at his desk asking a pretty teenage girl if she
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; plays with her private parts.  Is this Presidential material?
&gt; &gt;&gt; Must...resist...gratuitous...Bill Clinton comment...
&gt; &gt; True, but Clinton isn't ideal.

&gt; True, but by definition he was presidential material.

&gt; David, by definition not presidential material
">

Well, we agree on that.

But David's pretty good at dodging the issue here -- namely that Mitt
Romney is a member of (and engaged in) a church that is
extraordinarily intrusive with children and sexuality.  I'd much
rather have a trained teacher tell my kids about *age* *appropriate*
touching than an un-trained middle-aged man question them about
whether or not they play with their private parts.

Exactly what kind of training is required to discuss sex with children?
As a parent, and a survivor of adolescence, I think I am more than
qualified to teach and prepare them for what is ahead.  The fact that
anyone would rely on a third party system at all to teach their children
about sex, religion or anything else is absurd.

As for your general comments, confession is a tenet of most religions

Mormon bishops are required to have no training at all.  These are
typically middle-aged men who have achieved some measure of success
within the LDS Church, but they don't have any formal or consistent
training in counseling, teaching, etc.

Also, please note that I'm not necessarily supporting Obama's
position.  I think intelligent people can discuss both sides of that
argument.

What I'm objecting to is the notion that Mitt Romney would take Obama
to task for proposing what I consider to be a far less intrusive forum
on adolescent sex education than what's actually practiced by the LDS
Church and supported by Romney.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's fine.  But I consider discussions between an un-trained lay
church member (and middle-aged men) and children on the subject of
sexuality inappropriate.  Further, the fascination exhibited by the
LDS Church with adolescent masturbation is far more intrusive (in my
opinion) than anything I've seen proposed by Obama.

All of which makes Mitt Romney's castigation of Obama a case history
in hypocrisy.  Especially since Mitt, in his &quot;leadership position&quot; in
the Mormon Church has almost certainly been in the position of
questioning cute teenage girls about whether or not they play with
their private parts.

&gt; Do you attend a church regularly?

I was born to LDS parents and was active in the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon) until my mid 30's.  I went on a
mission for the church (British Columbia), graduated from BYU, married
in the temple (still married after 29 years, too).  I'm the father of
5 children and grandfather to 1.  I've held many positions in the LDS
Church, including Elder's Quorum President.  As a hyper-active Mormon
I also acted pretty much like the other TBMs on ARM, including such
characters as Guy R. Briggs, David Bowie, and Diana.

In my mid 30s I became aware, over a period of several months, that
the LDS Church is a fraud based on lies.  Though I continued to attend
church regularly for the next 15 years I was an openly disbelieving
member.  The church stopped &quot;calling&quot; me to positions, of course, but
they never took any action against me - other than telling me to stop
asking questions in the Gospel Doctrine class.  I've never been
disfellowshipped or excommunicated from the LDS Church.

Eventually I wrote a book that summarizes my experience and some of
the intellectual problems with Mormonism, particularly the religion's
problems with science.  The book is called &quot;Farewell to Eden: Coming
to terms with Mormonism and science,&quot; and can be ordered through any
major bookstore, as well as on-line outlets like Amazon.com.

Finally fed up with the Church's support for crooks in government, I
formally resigned from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
when I was 51 -- though it took multiple letters and threats of law
suits, they finally aquiesed and removed my name from their records
(or so they say)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Repentance is a good thing.  I consider my resignation from the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and my book, to be part of my
personal path to repentance for having supported, for so many years,
the corrupt LDS Church.

I should have known better.  I had my suspicions earlier, but didn't
act.  I converted many people to the Mormon Church, and I deeply
regret it.

Baptism is just getting wet.

But in spite of your ad hominem argument, the LDS Church really is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you attend a church regularly?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was born to LDS parents and was active in the Church of Jesus Christ
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon) until my mid 30's.  I went on a
&gt;&gt;&gt; mission for the church (British Columbia), graduated from BYU, married
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the temple (still married after 29 years, too).  I'm the father of
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 children and grandfather to 1.  I've held many positions in the LDS
&gt;&gt;&gt; Church, including Elder's Quorum President.  As a hyper-active Mormon
&gt;&gt;&gt; I also acted pretty much like the other TBMs on ARM, including such
&gt;&gt;&gt; characters as Guy R. Briggs, David Bowie, and Diana.
&gt;&gt;&gt; In my mid 30s I became aware, over a period of several months, that
&gt;&gt;&gt; the LDS Church is a fraud based on lies.  Though I continued to attend
&gt;&gt;&gt; church regularly for the next 15 years I was an openly disbelieving
&gt;&gt;&gt; member.  The church stopped &quot;calling&quot; me to positions, of course, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; they never took any action against me - other than telling me to stop
&gt;&gt;&gt; asking questions in the Gospel Doctrine class.  I've never been
&gt;&gt;&gt; disfellowshipped or excommunicated from the LDS Church.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Eventually I wrote a book that summarizes my experience and some of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the intellectual problems with Mormonism, particularly the religion's
&gt;&gt;&gt; problems with science.  The book is called &quot;Farewell to Eden: Coming
&gt;&gt;&gt; to terms with Mormonism and science,&quot; and can be ordered through any
&gt;&gt;&gt; major bookstore, as well as on-line outlets like Amazon.com.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally fed up with the Church's support for crooks in government, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; formally resigned from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
&gt;&gt;&gt; when I was 51 -- though it took multiple letters and threats of law
&gt;&gt;&gt; suits, they finally aquiesed and removed my name from their records
&gt;&gt;&gt; (or so they say)
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the insight.  I would say that those who fall away, for
&gt;&gt; whatever reason, tend to be the most vehemently against.  I speak not
&gt;&gt; only of the Church, but any other church or job.

&gt; Yeah.  Of course you'd say that.  After all, you can't form a coherent

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What are your beliefs on repentance

&gt;&gt;&gt; Repentance is a good thing.  I consider my resignation from the Church
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and my book, to be part of my
&gt;&gt;&gt; personal path to repentance for having supported, for so many years,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the corrupt LDS Church.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I should have known better.  I had my suspicions earlier, but didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; act.  I converted many people to the Mormon Church, and I deeply
&gt;&gt;&gt; regret it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Baptism is just getting wet.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip to end&gt;
&gt;&gt; So, why would you believe in repentance and not baptism?

&gt; Because repentance is how we become better people.  Baptism is how you
&gt; become a Mormon (or whatever).

&gt;&gt; Do you believe
&gt;&gt; in the Bible?  I ask since it requires both.

&gt; It's an authentic ancient text filled with human writing -- nothing
&gt; more.

&gt; The Book of Mormon is also filled with human writing, but isn't an
&gt; authentic ancient text.  It's just a plain old fraud.

I see.  So you don't really subscribe to any religion now-a-days?  It
seems to me when a person leaves the LDS church, more often than not
they just loose their faith all together.  I don't know enough about you

pretty complete break.  Is that a fair reading?

is bizarre, since you tend to issue assertion-based stuff yourself. In
fact, if you re-read what i was responding to, you will notice an
unsurprising lack of references.

Given that the original argument (yours) contained no references, it
seems completely reasonable for me to not offer references of my
own--it's top-of-the-head argument versus top-of-the-head argument. If
you want more, provide more initially, you know?

Except, of course, that if someone responds in kind (i.e., no
references) you can slam them for using exactly the same argumentation
technique that you used. Nice gig if you can get it.

I'm tempted to consider this a willful misreading of my statement. I was

I remember asking you for proof and details of all this sexual

my daughters were, and are, pretty, yet they were not sexually
harassed, or made to feel awkward.

Since you keep claiming that its intrusive sex education rather than a
question, and a teaching moment, which is accepted by, every parent,
and Obama wants it forced on everyone by the government, without
parental input as to what is said and done, I think it only fair that
you back it up with proof of how wicked it is, and not quoting just a

I'd rephrase that to make it true: Mormon bishops aren't required to have
any formal training.  The way you worded it means that a man is
disqualified by having training.  Since we have a lay clergy it is

Bishops do have training every 6 months from the stake presidency.  They

Here you stray from what Obama proposed.  Obama wanted age-appropriate sex

What Obama proposed isn't really my point.  In fact, I went out of my
way to note that reasonable people can disagree over what Obama
proposed.

My point is that Mitt Romney and the LDS Church engage in some very
questionable behavior regarding child sexuality.  Just as bad is this
policy of having middle age men -- with no requirement for formal
training -- engaged in private interviews with young kids (including
young women) talking about whether or not they play with their private
parts.

It's inappropriate behavior.

But Mitt did it, and he supports it.  Yet he lambastes Obama.

&gt; &gt; First point:  Children &quot;under the age of 8&quot; are not baptized in the
&gt; &gt; LDS Church.  David certainly knows this, so I'm not sure why he'd make
&gt; &gt; that part of his argument, except for the general observation that
&gt; &gt; Mormon apologetics is often based upon public denials and lying about
&gt; &gt; what the church teaches.

&gt; I'm tempted to consider this a willful misreading of my statement.
">

Of course you are, David.  But fortunately we can all see what you
wrote.  You said:

David Bowie said:
&quot;According to Mormon doctrine, a child under the age of 8 can't sin,
andreceiving baptism is an act of repentance anyway. Therefore,
Duwayne's bit about an 8yo kid being required to repent in such a way
before baptism would only be the case if the presiding authority was
going
contra church doctrine.&quot;

The reasons your arguments are bogus are:
1)  The LDS Church doesn't baptize children until *after* their 8th
birthday (when they can -- according to Mormon doctrine -- sin).
2)  Repentance is a prerequisite to baptism.

Let's refresh folks on what happened here.  I claimed that Mormon
bishops require 8-year-old children (someone who's over 8, but under
9) to repent before being baptize.  David said I didn't know what I
was talking about (see above).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I was
&gt; saying that children of record who are presented as baptismal candidates
&gt; can't be considered to have sinned, and so wouldn't be asked to repent
&gt; in the way that you're implicating.
">

In Mormon doctrine children are considered unable to sin before they
reach the age of accountability (8 years old).  They are baptized
after they reach the age of accountability.  And, like anyone else who
is baptized, repentance is a prerequisite.

This is basic LDS doctrine.   Go read the D&amp;C for crying out loud.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Second point:  Repentance is most assuredly a prerequisite to
&gt; &gt; baptism.  I'm not sure if David's ever read the Book of Mormon, but if
&gt; &gt; he'd pick it up and search it he'd find the phrase &quot;repent and be
&gt; &gt; baptized.&quot;  Here's an example:
&gt; &gt; Moroni 8: 10 Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teach --
&gt; &gt; repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of
&gt; &gt; committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent and be
&gt; &gt; baptized, and humble themselves as their little children, and they
&gt; &gt; shall all be saved with their little children.

&gt; This is amusing--you can't even choose a prooftext that supports your
&gt; position!
">

Can you read, David?  What part of &quot;repentance and baptism&quot; don't you
understand?  Which comes first in the sentence?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You seem to have missed that &quot;unto those who are accountable&quot;
&gt; thing. A child who just arrived at age 8 hasn't been accountable.
">

Once again -- the LDS Church doesn't baptize children that are under
8.  And children that are over 8 can sin, according to LDS doctrine.

Is Mormonism so corrupt that even the *basic* doctrines are now being
denied and lied about by LDS apologists?

Typical LDS apologist.  The LDS Church is obsessed with masturbation
and makes little children &quot;repent&quot; of it.  They question kids
throughout their entire lives on the subject.

But when the critic points this out, the apologist thinks the critic
is the one that's obsessed.

And *that*'s the biggest problem with your arguments (which are largely
based on attempted proof by repeated assertion, BTW) on this thread--you
are arguing from observations made quite a while ago.

The Mormon church, like many, many other churches, has come to realize a
good number of things about society as society itself has changed. Some
of these include bishops receiving certain sorts of psychosocial
training that they didn't receive earlier in church history, interviews
being conducted with extra safeguards, and so forth.

You, however, seem to refuse to believe that such changes in church
policy can have taken place--and, as a result, you end up looking a bit
idiotic to those of us who have had more recent observations.

Got it now?

The &quot;proof&quot; was in the way you assert &quot;They do receive training&quot; and
then -- unable to provide any evidence of this training -- try to
wiggle out of it by saying &quot;.... it does not matter....&quot;

It reminds me of the LDS apologetic regarding the mountain meadows

Nothing like trying to cover all your bases.

Depending upon the bishop (lay members with no training who lead
local
congregations) young children who fondle their private parts might be
required to go through a process of &quot;repentance&quot; before they can be
baptized.

Mormonism's preoccupation with masturbation is pervasive, with
children being given periodic interviews throughout life.  Those
children engaging in masturbation are required to go through a
process
of &quot;repentance.&quot; Some of the LDS advice to children for controlling
sexual urges is positively draconian.  Here's a link to a talk I
remember hearing when I was a young man in the LDS Church:

Given the harmful attitude of his church, and his personal behavior

the far more benign *age* *appropriate* sex education that he has

Duwaynea,

I was born LdS and have remained active throughout my life.  Surely you
must realize that at least a few policies have changed since you left the
Church.  In particular, that talk you posted a link to was from 1976.

I went through my baptismal interview without masturbation being brought
it.  Masturbation was not mentioned in my interview to receive the Aaronic
Priesthood, move up through its ranks, or for any of the times I went to
the temple for baptisms for the dead.  In the interviews before becoming
an elder, receiving my own endowment, and sending in mission papers, my
bishops clarified that the Law of Chastity means no sexual activities
outside the bonds of marriage.  However, no specific sexual activities
were mentioned.  Ditto for the sealing interview.  Interviews to renew my
temple recommend have just fallen back to the Law of Chastity without any
clarification.

Yes, there is a lesson on the Law of Chastity once a year in young men /
young women.  Yes, there are occasional talks in General Conference
regarding the Law of Chastity (there has been an alarming increase in the
warnings against pornography in the priesthood sessions, so I'm assuming
it's becoming a greater problem).  HOWEVER, my point was, and is, that
masturbation is only brought up in interviews if the interviewee asks
about it.

Remember this whole thread got started because Mitt Romney opposes Obama's
suggestion that age-appropriate sex education in the classroom begins in
kindergarten.  You have turned the situation into some fantasy in your
mind of Mitt Romney, in his former role of Bishop, interviewing teenage
girls (always pretty or cute) about their sex lives - comparing it to phone
sex without the phone.  How did we jump from teachers discussing sex with
5 year olds over to teenagers saying if they obey the Law of Chastity to
their bishop?

The great majority of those links refer to the same stuff from before I

What's the point of having living prophets and an open canon if the Church
can't change in regards to society and scientific understanding?  Even
here apologetics change their arguments based on more recent findings (not
that apologetics' words are ever doctrinally binding).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The Mormon church, like many, many other churches, has come to realize a
&gt;&gt; good number of things about society as society itself has changed.

&gt; Why did they have to learn these things within the context of a
&gt; changing society?
&gt; Where was the holy ghost, and why wasn't he telling the prophets to
&gt; change?

Maybe the Holy Ghost tells us how it should be at the time of his telling?
If society changes, then the Holy Ghost prompts on how to deal with those
changes.

True.  In fact, here's a short list of things that come to mind --
changes that I've seen in the LDS Church during the last half century
that I've observed:

1)  Women can pray in church (it used to be they were forbidden from
praying in sacrament meeting)
2)  Birth control -- the church no longer takes an active role in
preaching against it
3)  Blacks -- the church used to teach that blacks were not valiant in
the pre-existence and so that's why they were marked with the curse of
Cain and unable to hold the priesthood.
4)  Women working outside the home -- they've softened their tone on
that
5)  The church used to teach that the Indians would turn white when
they joined the church.  It says that in the BOM, but the church has
backed away from it, anyway.
6)  The church used to relocate young Native Americans to Mormon homes
as a means of indoctrinating them.  They called it the &quot;Lamanite
placement program.&quot;  They've since stopped it.  Many Mormons I know
are aghast when I explain what the church used to teach about Native
Americans.

That's just a short list - there are many more examples.  So, yes, we
all agree that the LDS Church can and has changed - often for the
better, often because of pressure from &quot;liberals&quot; and often from
pressure outside the organization.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In particular, that talk you posted a link to was from 1976.

Oh, I posted lots more than just that.  Masturbation is one of those
areas on which the church hasn't changed much.  They're still as
draconian as ever.

For example, if you go to the official Internet site of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon) and search on
&quot;masturbation&quot; you'll see that the church lumps masturbation with
thinks like &quot;fornication (including living together without marriage),
homosexuality, abortion, and masturbation&quot; [Lesson 34: Moral

&gt; I went through my baptismal interview without masturbation being brought
&gt; it.

Nobody really knows what was said in your interview -- and you have a
clear motivation to deny it.

But we can all verify the teachings of Mormonism on masturbation, and
we can all read the horrible talk given by Mark E. Petersen of the
Council of the 12 Apostles at the following link:

&gt; &gt; Actually, David, you are describing what you are doing.  I've posted
&gt; &gt; multiple links and quotations from LDS sources -- including LDS

&gt; &gt; Here are a few links:

&gt; The great majority of those links refer to the same stuff from before I

Are you suggesting that you should not trust what your prophets say
today, because the church might change it all around tomorrow?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The other links are talks, discourses, and articles about

&gt; The point is none of the recent links are about

If you go to the official LDS Internet site and search on
&quot;masturbation&quot; you'll come up with lots and lots of references to
masturbation as a sin.  Often the &quot;sin&quot; of masturbation is lumped in
with things like homosexuality, rape, incest, and adultery.

http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.062a5ea6a5e8d8661b6220...

Are you suggesting that the church preaches that masturbation is a
serious sin -- as it manifestly teaches (and all can verify) -- but
that it's not discussed in personal interviews?

Really!  Is there anything the church might do that the apologists
won't deny?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; BTW) on this thread--you
&gt; &gt;&gt; are arguing from observations made quite a while ago.

&gt; &gt; Why should the &quot;only true church&quot; change the way it does?

&gt; What's the point of having living prophets and an open canon if the Church
&gt; can't change in regards to society and scientific understanding?

What's the point in having modern-day prophets that are no more
progressive than my neighbor?

&gt; &gt; I was born LdS and have remained active throughout my life.  Surely you
&gt; &gt; must realize that at least a few policies have changed since you left the
&gt; &gt; Church.

&gt; True.  In fact, here's a short list of things that come to mind --
&gt; changes that I've seen in the LDS Church during the last half century
&gt; that I've observed:

&gt; 1)  Women can pray in church (it used to be they were forbidden from
&gt; praying in sacrament meeting)
&gt; 2)  Birth control -- the church no longer takes an active role in
&gt; preaching against it
&gt; 3)  Blacks -- the church used to teach that blacks were not valiant in
&gt; the pre-existence and so that's why they were marked with the curse of
&gt; Cain and unable to hold the priesthood.
&gt; 4)  Women working outside the home -- they've softened their tone on
&gt; that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll accept what you say about your history in the church since I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no real reason to doubt you or desire to check.  However, this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statement
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   calls into question what you know about the inner workings of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ward.  Bishops are trained, quite a bit, to act in their roll.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because I happen to be friends with our current Bishop who is my age
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (mid 30s).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My claim was that they don't get, or are required to have, any formal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; training in counseling or adolescent sexuality.  They are pure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amateurs, yet they are given authority by the Church of Jesus Christ
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon) to engage in the most intimate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (and, in my opinion inappropriate) discussions with children about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sex.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They do receive training,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not in counseling.  If you assert otherwise, then give the title and
&gt;&gt;&gt; publication date of the training manual.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as to the specific aspects, I could not say
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; having never been one myself.  You never mentioned being a bishop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yourself, so I am unsure how you make this claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As an Elders Quorum President I worked with Mormon Bishops for several
&gt;&gt;&gt; years.  My father was in LDS bishoprics for over a decade.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In any case, it does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not matter, the counsel offered by the &quot;untrained&quot; is no different than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the &quot;trained&quot; clergy, so I don't know why you ever made the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disitiction.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Typical LDS apologetic -- lie about the details and then cover
&gt;&gt;&gt; yourself by saying it doesn't matter.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip to end&gt;

&gt;&gt; Well, in typical anti-mormon fashion, you call me a liar without proof
&gt;&gt; and answer no questions yourself, so I don't feel so bad about your
&gt;&gt; assessment of my character.

&gt; How do you know that the counsel offered by the &quot;untrained&quot; is no
&gt; different than the &quot;trained&quot; clergy ???

How do you know it is?
