DDJ. chapter.57

The 1st sentence:
"yi zheng zhi guo,
yi qi yong bing,
yi WU SHI qu tian xia"

The last sentence:
So the sage said:
"wo WU WEI, er min zi hua;
wo hao jing, er min zi zheng;
wo WU SHI, er min zi fu;
wo wu yu, er min zi pu."

There are 2 words--wu wei and wushi in these 2 sentences.
I'd like to express what's my understanding of these 2 words.

Wuwei: a highest state of one's spirituality/ world view. already have
discerned the true appearance of the world and all creature, shuffle off
this mortal coil, get rid of the cord of illusioned "self".(the self
cause=&gt;you and I ,my and your, different races ,different countries ...etc
all kind of differential heart. It is the source of our inexhaustible
suffering/tragedy/worry/resentment/unwisdom...), understanding the world is
an unity and how it works. Understanding that to regard others/creature is
love yourself......etc.
very close to the concept of "Nirvana"

Wushi: having no deliberate (intentional) purpose and
implies non-interference in the natural order. Frequently
it is misinterpreted to mean doing nothing which can be
wrongly mapped to the Western idiom of a "carelessness"
or an indifferent "laissez-faire" attitude.
(it is copied from Shazi'post before, but shazi give this definition to
"Wuwei")

Why so many people misunderstand wuwei so many years?
my point of view is they mix up with the Rujia'wuwei.
The word "wuwei" also used by Rujia/confucian/Confucianism.
The influence of rujia/confucian/Confucianism is far-reaching in Chinese
culture/politics.
"Once a use forever a custom."

So,
"wo WU WEI, er min zi hua; wo WU SHI, er min zi fu"  can be apprehended as:

"if I(governer) attain to as high as wuwei level of world view or I'm
working hard try to heighten my consciousness to wuwei,(i'm an example)
then people will spontaneous follow me to civilize their spirituality
(no need promote by words).
if I(governer) having no deliberate (intentional) purpose and
implies to intervene in the affairs of state,
then people will involuntary get rich."

Your understanding aligns with others.

Red Pine translated the phrases as:
"use inaction to rule the world" and
"I do nothing

Yes.
Wu Wei seems to connote spontaneity
in the sense of no premeditated action.
It may also literally denote non-action.
It suggests or connotes effortless action
or action without action, wei-wu-wei.

Wu Shi might mean the same thing.

And\or:
Wu Shi seems to connote not meddling with
or not bothering or not troubling people.

It might be much less
than not having a deliberate
nor intentional purpose.

It's one non-action to allow mud to settle.
It's another not-meddle to not stir things up.

My point of view in my post is:
1).Wu-wei and Wu-shi are 2 completely different concepts.
2). Wushi=   your "wuwei"= rujia's wuwei
3).Wu-wei close to "Nirvana".(It help you understand, don't take it too
seriously).

It looks as if it's hard to be accepted by you all at once.

supplement:
Wu-wei 's literal meaning is no-doing. but,
It should means ones illusive/improper thought/heart none-acting.
A man attain to wuwei stage , he may be a sage/wisdom/zhenren/shengren/ Or
an arhat/Bodhisattva/Buddha.....
this man also be reckoned has Get Dao.
he naturally know what should/can be done, what not
he naturally know when should/can advance or retreat.
this may be called Wushi.
-------------------------------

chapter.63  the first sentence.

"wei wu wei, shi wu shi, wei wu wei"

it is a difficult sentence.  my understanding  is:

"If you want success , beginning from 'cultivate wuwei',
if you deal with affairs, using Wushi first.
Taste comes from your unoccupied sense ."

Wu Wei    Is actionless action or spontanenity...  comes from within
from the center  as many Taoists believe is the way of Tao.

Wu Shih is to do without having to struggle, force, meddle,
interfer...leaving others to find their own way; in other words, people
will be content without others manipulating or interferring with their
way of life.   It is the way of the ancients to which Lao Tzu and
Chuang Tzu pointed.

63 is again referring to the ancients; the next sentence refers to a
balance or a pivot;  it is said in CT, in ancient places,  cultivation
was not needed, as when the people were as the ancients living in small
isolated villages, however both Lao Tzu and Chunag Tzu (who appreciated
the ways of Lao Tzu ) believed that the interference of rulers, sages,
emperors and other leaders destroyed the balance of people's lives and
felt that the old ways of non-action or action less action and not
interference would help and cultivation became a topic and a practice
for some Taoists sages and adepts.   Today, there are those who do not
practice any type of cultivation of wu wei or wu shih and there are
those who do have a practice of cultivation.  I find it all... a way of
sorts... of this and that... under the large umbrella of what we call
the Taoist way.

I'm not so certain that laissez-faire implies carelessness
It's a fundamental principle of free market economics
(a thing quite distinct fro corporate capitalism) that allows
the "invisible hand" to do its work.
Later in the chapter we have: wo wu shi, er mi zi fu.
One funny, colloquial, but faithful way of rendering this is
"it's none of my business, yet the people themselves prosper".
If I wish the people to prosper, and so avoid meddling in their
affairs, this may in fact be the result of caring for their welfare.

Shi means event, affair, and has overtones of trouble.
Sheng shi shi sheng is a symmetrical sentence where
sheng means birth, to be born, to give birth to, to arise,
to give rise to, and here it means: to create trouble
begets trouble. Another relevant expression is ping-an
wu-shi, which means that everything goes well. So
meddling is a correct translation for shi. Wu-wei and
wu-shi to me both mean to efface oneself in favour of
what happens, without meddling in it or interfering
with it. To me non-interference, non-obstruction,
non-resistance, making space for what happens by
emptying oneself out and letting the situation act one,
etc. are implications of wu-wei and wu-shi.

This may or may not be, but the issue is that you have no
responsibility or control either way. The true spirit of doing nothing
is the insight that you actually *can't* do anything on your own.
Carelessness is basically a good thing; not carelessness itself, but
knowing that you don't have to care.

In a way, I do agree.   Boundaries can merge with space in a way of
emptiness and stillness, flying, where caring is all one does.
