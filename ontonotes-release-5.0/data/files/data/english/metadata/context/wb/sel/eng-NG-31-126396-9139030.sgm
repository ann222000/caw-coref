WTF are you talking about, Edwin? I looked up Tholen when the Mayor
gave me a  url on him. He is on the Big Island (Hawaii), while I am on
Oahu.

Your whole line of thought on this is irrational... and seems a dodge from

way out for you by lashing out like that?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; All the sane Maccies are distancing themselves from Dave...

&gt; &gt;&gt; And you are running from a reasonable question.  You have made it clear you
&gt; &gt;&gt; cannot understand why one person would not know another simply because they
&gt; &gt;&gt; have the same employer, even if they live far away from one another and are
&gt; &gt;&gt; not in the same department.

&gt; &gt; Dave Tholen isn't just another employee, he's an award winning
&gt; &gt; astronomer who's been posting to CSMA and COLA for years.

&gt; &gt; How is it I know who Dave Tholen is but the guy who claims to be Dave
&gt; &gt; Fritzinger does not?

&gt; No reason Fritzinger should necessarily know who Tholen is...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WTF are you talking about, Edwin?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's above your question, Dave.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I looked up Tholen when the Mayor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gave me a  url on him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then why didn't you know who I was talking about?   Did you use the
&gt;&gt;&gt; link above?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He is on the Big Island (Hawaii), while I am on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oahu.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What does that have to do with you not knowing who an award-winning
&gt;&gt;&gt; astronomer is who works for the same University as you claim to?
&gt;&gt;&gt; That was small news for the university and Hawaii?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now you are descending into madness...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8^(

&gt;&gt;&gt; You mistakenly assume I share your circumstances.

&gt;&gt; Your whole line of thought on this is irrational...

&gt; Not to rational people.

&gt;&gt; and seems a dodge from
&gt;&gt; whatever the real issue is.

&gt; What other issue did you see in my OP?

&gt;&gt; Why is it you and others in CSMA go for bizarre
&gt;&gt; personal attacks when you cannot hold your own in a debate?

&gt; You have the nerve to ask that, you who forged obscene Web sites and
&gt; posts in your efforts to attack posters who you couldn't overcome in
&gt; debate?

&gt;&gt; Is it just a
&gt;&gt; way out for you by lashing out like that?

&gt; I quoted Dave and referenced the University of Hawaii's employee
&gt; list.   How is that &quot;lashing out?&quot;
">

And now you are pushing all sorts of attacks against *me*... merely because
I have pointed out it is irrational to assume one person must know another
for the reasons you assume they must or should.  You are not acting in a
rational way, but I have no desire to follow you into a circus of personal
insults as you run from the actual topic of your error.

There simply is no reason he would necessarily know of another person who
shares the same employer - especially when not in the same field.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; THOLEN, David J., Astronomer

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WTF are you talking about, Edwin?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It's above your question, Dave.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I looked up Tholen when the Mayor
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gave me a  url on him.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Then why didn't you know who I was talking about?   Did you use the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; link above?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He is on the Big Island (Hawaii), while I am on
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oahu.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; What does that have to do with you not knowing who an award-winning
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; astronomer is who works for the same University as you claim to?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; That was small news for the university and Hawaii?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now you are descending into madness...
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8^(

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; You mistakenly assume I share your circumstances.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Your whole line of thought on this is irrational...

&gt; &gt;&gt; and seems a dodge from
&gt; &gt;&gt; whatever the real issue is.

&gt; &gt; What other issue did you see in my OP?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Why is it you and others in CSMA go for bizarre
&gt; &gt;&gt; personal attacks when you cannot hold your own in a debate?

&gt; &gt; You have the nerve to ask that, you who forged obscene Web sites and

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LOL! I've got Edwin on my side but you've got Snit on yours, Dave. Are

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All the sane Maccies are distancing themselves from Dave...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; And you are running from a reasonable question.  You have made it clear you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; cannot understand why one person would not know another simply because they
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have the same employer, even if they live far away from one another and are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not in the same department.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Dave Tholen isn't just another employee, he's an award winning
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; astronomer who's been posting to CSMA and COLA for years.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; How is it I know who Dave Tholen is but the guy who claims to be Dave
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Fritzinger does not?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;No reason Fritzinger should necessarily know who Tholen is... you are simply
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;showing a very weak grasp of logic and reason.

&gt; &gt;&gt; In any company you usually at least hear the names of the more
&gt; &gt;&gt; prominent people even if you never meet them personally. Tholen is one
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the University of Hawaii's.

&gt; &gt;After all the years Dave Tholen was mentioned in CSMA, and posted here
&gt; &gt;himself, why doesn't Snit and Dave Fritzinger know this?

&gt; Well to be fair Tholen has slacked off quite a bit as it became
&gt; obvious, even to the diehards, that OS/2 was going the way of the
&gt; dodo.

More irrelevant and bizarre comments from you - simply because you cannot
accept that with a large employer it is not reasonable to assume that one

Dave Tholen only rarely posts to CSMA and COLA, and almost always as
part of a cross-posted thread someone else cross-posted from the groups
he does regularly post in.  It is quite reasonable to expect that people
here, if they do not hang out in those other groups, to not recognize
Tholen, even if they read CSMA and COLA quite prolifically.

Your wrong about that, Tim.   There were long periods were CSMA was almost
entirely given to Dave Tholen threads.  Also you're only focusing on one
aspect, the posts, the way others focused only on his being employed by the
same university.  Both need to be taken together, along with the fact the
honors Dave Tholen received would have been big news in Hawaii.  Then
there's the goofy &quot;geography lesson&quot; Dave Fritzinger resorted to in a
laughable attack in response to this.

Now, Edwin, I realize you don't know much about the world, but the
University of Hawaii is a rather large institution, and Tholen works
in a different department than I, on a different island than I, in a

&gt; &gt;Why would he know him just because they have the same employer?

&gt; LOL! I've got Edwin on my side but you've got Snit on yours, Dave. Are
&gt; you ready to surrender yet? 8)

Never!!! You've also got zara and Muahman. With a lineup like that,
you can't win!

&gt; &gt; And you are running from a reasonable question.  You have made it clear you
&gt; &gt; cannot understand why one person would not know another simply because they
&gt; &gt; have the same employer, even if they live far away from one another and are
&gt; &gt; not in the same department.

&gt; Dave Tholen isn't just another employee, he's an award winning
&gt; astronomer who's been posting to CSMA and COLA for years.

&gt; How is it I know who Dave Tholen is but the guy who claims to be Dave
&gt; Fritzinger does not?

Because you are obsessed with him?

&gt; &gt;No reason Fritzinger should necessarily know who Tholen is... you are simply
&gt; &gt;showing a very weak grasp of logic and reason.

&gt; In any company you usually at least hear the names of the more
&gt; prominent people even if you never meet them personally. Tholen is one
&gt; of the University of Hawaii's.

But, Mayor, we are in very different departments, and I hear little
about the Astronomy department, except to know that it is an excellent
department.
