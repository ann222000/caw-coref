Look at the statute he cited. It mentions correctional officers.

I don't classify all of them in that light; but, there are some who commit
so many errors that calling them assholes or tax leech persons of lesser
intelligence isn't hard to do.
Why do *they* need to carry guns in public so much?
Why do we need to spend billions on guntoters in foreign lands?
There is ample work to be done in the USA; and that money is the peoples'
money.

&gt; read Delaware State Code

&gt; Section 222
&gt; Subsection 14

&gt; &gt; And you're crying about it..:o)

&gt; No - I'm not an incompetent prison clerk.

&gt; Does it really make you feel better to believe your fantasies?

&gt; That's also Wentzky's opinion of you.

&gt; and?

&gt;  How do you feel now that you're
&gt; only friend and lover has rejected you by rejecting your profession?

&gt; Only someone like you would be upset over something like that.

&gt; God, your life really does suck.

&gt; If you wish to believe fantasies..:o)

&gt; &gt; Oh yea, you were supposed to have gotten me fired...how is that going by
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; way?

&gt; Who said I was going to fire you or get you fired - I sure didn't, you
&gt; half-baked loser.

&gt; Oh yes you did coward, you did say about a month or two ago I would soon
&gt; be
&gt; out of a job.

&gt; Now I see that you found out you can't do jack shit..:o)
&gt; And you're going to change your tune.

&gt; Don't worry...Patty tried it too and failed.
&gt; You're not alone in the &quot;failure&quot; department.

Why is your fucking newsreader attributing my words to you, prison

&gt; that doesn't support your claim about your job. to support *your*
&gt; claim, you need to present *your* credentials.

Holy shit do you get more and more stupid.

I said, I am a law enforcement officer.

I work with the Department of the Corrections.
I am NOT going to reveal my rank because it's too much fun watching you
idiots guess.
Hint: It's between Lt. and Major.

You seen what the Delaware Code states.
It proves what I said.

Now you want to go on and be in denial.

You can NEVER say again you haven't seen me prove my claims.
I have, and it's on record.

My title?

I will not say on here because these idiots are chasing me hard, they are so

I will give a hint:

It's between Lt. and Major

There is no job title known as &quot;prison clerk&quot;, it's just something they made

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; He is a _prison_ clerk_.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Delaware.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Prison Clerk, you're a plagiarist.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Street ho, you're dishonest and ignorant.

Trolling Keegan, don't you see that you don't have a fan base like you
think? You run and hide anytime someone confronts you.
You speak about things you know nothing about, you distort and you lie.

You asked me to prove a claim earlier, that Delaware Correctional Officers
are law enforcement officers.  A claim I easily proven through Delaware
State Code, then you wanted to move the goal post..showing just how truly
loathsome and dishonest you truly are.

Odd, when ever Barnes or one of your buddies edits and distorts one of
my postings, you seem to never be around to &quot;correct&quot;, and when you
are asked why, you say that it's not your responsibility.  So tell us,
why is it sudden your responsibility to correct my statements?

You wouldn't be a tad bit on the dishonest side now would you???

You clearly have no honor or shame.  EVERYONE knows you to be a liar
out here.  Here is another example you recently ignored after I shoved
that ugly face of yours in it another of your lies:

The proof above demonstrates not only that you are a liar, but that you
always have some way of claiming you didn't lie when you clearly did.
This should be more than enough to show anyone who has any doubts who
is telling the truth here.  You lie.  Then you have some psychotic
explanation when you get caught.

Osprey:  It's your burden to show proof, and since I never relied on
any internet business for any income, you are dead wrong.

(In reality, his failed internet business was called &quot;Gifts Unlimited.&quot;)

His father advertised it here:  &lt; http://tinyurl.com/2c58nc &gt;

And Osprey admits to it here:  &lt; http://tinyurl.com/22f74x &gt;

It was so long ago that Osprey thought know-one knew about it so he
took a chance and LIED.

Quoting Osprey in that older post:  &quot;I for one do run a business on the
internet and I do use news groups as  a means of generating interest.
Our company happens to be a very honest hard working company.&quot;

But recently he lies:  &quot;It's your burden to show proof, and since I
never relied on any internet business for any income, you are dead
wrong.&quot;

ONCE AGAIN!  I proved my assertion.  And once again, he simply denied
it.  Just as I have proven the reprimand he received at work, the
trailer, the bankruptcy, etc., I proved it again, and once again he did
what he always does and pretended the proof didn't exist. The proof
above demonstrates not only that you are a liar, but that you
always have some way of claiming you didn't lie when you clearly did.

This should be more than enough to show anyone who has any doubts who
is telling the truth here.  You lie.  Then you have some psychotic
explanation when you get caught.

Very twisted.

Osprey gets his ass handed to him again and thinks, once again, that if
he ignores the truth it will go away.

Later, Osprey will claim &quot;Prove it!&quot;  &quot;You never proved I lied!&quot; or
&quot;You had your chance and you failed!&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It's absolutely 100% fact, you were never a police officer.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can you support that statement?
&gt; &gt; &gt;It's been supported.

&gt; &gt; Not by any literate person.

&gt; Well, you're not literate...so I don't expect much.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Barnes admitted to me that he was working with Home Depot and failed to
&gt; &gt; &gt;get a
&gt; &gt; &gt;position as a fork lift driver.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; What is embarrassing is when you applied for that forklift position and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; turned you down.  Seems they can't trust you to drive a little tiny
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; forklift
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; around.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Yeah, yeah, yeah...

&gt; &gt; I've corrected your convenient editing.

&gt; Odd, when ever Barnes or one of your buddies edits and distorts one of
&gt; my postings, you seem to never be around to &quot;correct&quot;, and when you
&gt; are asked why, you say that it's not your responsibility.  So tell us,
&gt; why is it sudden your responsibility to correct my statements?

Osprey admits to being a liar.  He just has a &quot;good reason.&quot;
