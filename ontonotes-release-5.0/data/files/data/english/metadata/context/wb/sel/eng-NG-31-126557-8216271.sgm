Mediagrids today announced that it is to showcase its ground-breaking
broadcare system at the Telecare 2007 event in Birmingham on 27th
September. The broadband-based video system heralds the next
generation of telecare provision and is already disrupting older
architectures, according to the Company. broadcare advances the
telecare industry beyond panic buttons and voice-only call centres to
enable hospitals and care centres to provide intelligent and discreet
visual monitoring of individuals in their own environments.

The innovative broadcare system is already in use in The Netherlands
where 40 'care hubs' are using it over a fibre optic network.
Mediagrids partly attributes its success to date to strategic
partnerships with specialist healthcare resellers such as iTelecare in
the UK, and TeleZorg Support in The Netherlands and Benelux.
