It's a game for consoles that was ported as an afterthought, many, many
years later. Quit crossposting/spamming your links - why do you even
bother when perhaps 1% of ppl here (which actually rounds down to zero)
will give a flying fuck about this tripe? I know it's easy to just add
another group in your quest for fame &amp; recognition &amp; to boost your
fragile ego &amp; low self-esteem. It's just as easy to remove one, in other
ppl's quest for less spam. Do us &amp; your future therapists a favour, will

Why is it a big deal?  Really, what is the problem?

Phantasy Star is a huge, all time classic. And while it's a console game
vs PC, it's not like someone trying to discuss cooking pound cake in
vietnam vets forum or something.

I owned a Sega Master System and Genesis. I played all the Phantasy
Star games and loved them.

I have not had a new console for many many years. I don't follow them,
I don't read their newsgroups.

But if not for this message, I would not even have noticed it was the 20
year aniversary.  I think that was kind of cool.  I was glad it was brought
to my attention.

So what's the problem anyhow?  Usenet is such a dying breed, so few
people even using it anymore, all spread out across tens of thousands
of groups.  Is it really the end of the world if the occasional crosspost
happens, especially when it is at least in the same &quot;genere&quot; (rpg-games).
Is it really so bad if people from different groups cross talk occasionally?

Is this destroying usenet servers world wide?  Are hard drives crashing
from the lost space?

This is like that stupid argument about not being able to talk about
Bioshock
in this group because it's not an RPG.

I can't help but feel (still) that these types of complaints simply come
down
to either a) hatred of the game in question disguised as complaint about
on topic posting, or b) wannabe moderator/netcopping.

It's not a big deal!

It's not a big deal, but the problem was that orginal poster's message
was the kind of mindless console game advocacy that gets crossposted far
too often here.  While in this case, it might have been technically on
topic for this newsgroup, posts devoid of content that serve no purpose

Mate don't sweat it. This was more my knee-jerk to the bi-weekly (or
more) drive-by spamming from all the console cunts, who crosspost their
console crap here as if it actually had some inkling of relevance.
No one was more surprised than I to get a debate in response from said
arsewipe, given that I thought I was just venting to a troll most likely
(that AirRaid fucktard is the same - now this 2bitwiz thinks the OP
wasn't xposting ROFL!).

Geez, has anyone noticed I've started fucking swearing a lot more

Phantasy Star was a Japanese RPG, but it wasn't wacky like all the
super-deformed stuff that's come out of Japan since the early 90s,
mostly for Nintendo and Playstatation systems.

PS was the first true RPG released for consoles in the U.S., arriving
in 1988, 2+ years before Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy.

I don't think it had much influence in Japan, although it's not hugely
different from the very influential Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.
With 3D dungeons it's the closest to the Ultima series of games that
they're all inspired by.  The artwork doesn't feature the super-deformed
characters that Final Fantasty and Dragon Quest did, but it's still in
anime style.  It had a sci-fi setting, but I never played it so I don't
know how &quot;wacky&quot; it might.  Like it other games of the time, I think it
emphasised combat over story.

Hugely influential, but not nearly as popular as those two. Inspired three
sequels, two text adventures and the current MMO game that's gone through
several revisions since coming out in 2001. Phantasy Star was notably
unusual for having a female protagonist and a setting that didn't occur in
some Tolkienesque fantasy world (as you note below.)

I don't know if I agree with your last statement there. The thousand-year
apocalyptic cycle of the Dark Falz and the simmering racial tension of the
three planets in the Coral system had enough story to support eight major
game titles. I would argue that there's actually more story there in the
first game than in the equvalent Ultima title of the time.

Just to keep this on topic? As a PC title, Phantasy Star Universe probably
won't sway you from your favorite game if you're already a World of
Warcraft or Guild Quest player. What it does have over other MMOs is a
fully realized offline mode that offers nearly everything the online game
has. The dungeon areas all become available as you progress through a
story that addresses some very modern concerns in a classic sci-fi way
(like the role of the military in a free society, or the price of racial
prejudice.) There are also lobby areas populated by colorful NPCs that
flesh out the game world in an immersive way that human players don't
(since AI NPCs won't hit on you or log out midway through a mission.) I
like Phantasy Star Universe enough to recommend it to anybody.

For a game to be influential, it needs to influence the development of
games made by other developers.  Dragon Quest is credited with creating
the console RPG genre, and Final Fantasy is said to be the biggest
influence in the genre.  The Phantasy Star series seems to be it's own
isolated branch of the genre.

&gt; &gt;I don't think it had much influence in Japan, although it's not hugely

&gt; Hugely influential, but not nearly as popular as those two. Inspired three
&gt; sequels, two text adventures and the current MMO game that's gone through
&gt; several revisions since coming out in 2001. Phantasy Star was notably
&gt; unusual for having a female protagonist and a setting that didn't occur in
&gt; some Tolkienesque fantasy world (as you note below.)
">

There were 8 text adventures for the MegaDrive based on the PSII
characters released in Japan, released over Sega's first network using
the Mega Modem.  these were re-released on the MegaCD.

also there were two GameGear games: an actual RPG (Phantasy Star
Gaiden)
and Puzzle game (Phantasy Star Adventure)

also the MMO, Phantasy Star Online, is a seperate series from Phantasy
Star Universe.  PSU has just become a series with the introduction of
an expansion.

&gt; &gt;With 3D dungeons it's the closest to the Ultima series of games that
&gt; &gt;they're all inspired by.  The artwork doesn't feature the super-deformed
&gt; &gt;characters that Final Fantasty and Dragon Quest did, but it's still in
&gt; &gt;anime style.  It had a sci-fi setting, but I never played it so I don't
&gt; &gt;know how &quot;wacky&quot; it might.  Like it other games of the time, I think it
&gt; &gt;emphasised combat over story.

Phantasy Star wasn't just sci-fi (as in science fiction) it was a mix
of fantasy and science.
PSII was more sci-fi.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't know if I agree with your last statement there. The thousand-year
&gt; apocalyptic cycle of the Dark Falz and the simmering racial tension of the

&gt; Just to keep this on topic? As a PC title, Phantasy Star Universe probably
&gt; won't sway you from your favorite game if you're already a World of
&gt; Warcraft or Guild Quest player. What it does have over other MMOs is a
&gt; fully realized offline mode that offers nearly everything the online game
&gt; has. The dungeon areas all become available as you progress through a
&gt; story that addresses some very modern concerns in a classic sci-fi way
&gt; (like the role of the military in a free society, or the price of racial
&gt; prejudice.) There are also lobby areas populated by colorful NPCs that
&gt; flesh out the game world in an immersive way that human players don't
&gt; (since AI NPCs won't hit on you or log out midway through a mission.) I
&gt; like Phantasy Star Universe enough to recommend it to anybody.

It's a matter worthy of some debate. The Legend of Zelda and the first
Neutopia title had nearly identical stories and gameplay, but were
developed independently and had no programmers in common. Given how
widespread both titles were, which one was more influential? In the same
way, the first Final Fantasy and the first Phantasy Star both came out in
December of 1987 and inspired waves of RPGs with turn-based combat and
pre-rolled parties. Which one had more influence? You could draw a
straight line from any current JRPG back to either one of them.

I'm going to play against type here and mention briefly that none of these
games is more influential than the American RPGs that inspired the
Japanese programmers to begin with. Wizardry and Ultima in particular are
what shaped the production of JRPG titles more than any domestic Japanese
product. You can see the waves of Mangar's berserkers in every frame of
Dragon Force and the mutated undead of Wasteland propping up the ghosts of
Silent Hill.

In times past and currently, even with JRPGs flooding both the console and
PC markets, it's the American games (paper and computer) that have driven
Japanese tastes. Every cyberpunk setting like Phantasy Star owes a big
debt to Shadowrun. Every stealth tactics game owes a debt to Airborne
Ranger. Every grid-based strategy game has a root in some early SSI title.

But back to your point? Albert Odyssey's Pike had a winged flying machine.
Is this based on Cid's airship or Rolf's hovercraft? Ziekfried is
horrible, corruptible and out to conquer Filgaia. Is he based more on
Final Fantasy's Chaos or Phantasy Star's Dark Falz? Every RPG has one
character that dies and can't be brought back. Is that more like Alys
Bragwin or more like Aeris Gainsborough? I won't deny that Final Fantasy
is the more famous of the two, but I don't think Phantasy Star is an
also-ran by comparison.

Certainly the post that started this thread was off-topic, since it was
only about a console game. But is it reasonable to exclude all discussion
of another platform when you're talking about a soft abstraction like
artistic influence, or something hard and fast like a multiplatform port?
I don't think that's a line that you can draw so thick and clearly, and
that there is room for some flexibility to accomodate instances where
there is some genuine crossover.

So there's plenty of merit in your complaint, but I'd appreciate it if you
could make it a little more diplomatically. Being hostile and openly
derisive isn't necessarily the best way to influence people's behavior,
especially in an era of dwindling Usenet readership. If I've been rude or
out-of-step in any way in this group, I wouldn't mind a friendly tap on

Well, my local games store shevels are stocked quite nicely, but I don't
have a much of a problem &quot;off-topic&quot; posts so long as they're only one
step away from being on topic.  That's especially true if that happens
because of thread drift.  It's less true when someone starts a new
thread with an off-topic post and would've obviously been better posted
to another group.  So I don't mind questions about PC gaming hardware
here, or the fact that this thread has drifted into a discussion of the
influence of a console RPG, especially since it does have some relevence
to PC RPGs.

I do mind it when people make contentless posts just boost their own ego,
regardless of the topic, so please continue play netcop with those guys.
Thanks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I do mind it when people make contentless posts just boost their own ego,
&gt;&gt;&gt;regardless of the topic, so please continue play netcop with those guys.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks.

&gt;&gt;Christmas &amp; my parents ;)

&gt;You are SO getting coal in your stocking, buddy. ;^)

Nothing says I love you like a wake-up blowjob on Christmas morning &gt;8^D
