&quot;Unfortunately, overall acceleration just isn't in the same class as other
modern sportbikes, most of which use dual-overhead-cam, liquid-cooled
powerplants that rev higher, produce more power, and generally whomp the
Buell in terms of straight-line acceleration.&quot;

Why?

Definitely interesting.  Rotax builds good motors, and Buell does
interesting chassis.

You didn't read the whole artical.  That paragraph
describes the old sportster engine.  The new bike has a
liquid cooled DOHC 72* V2.  Redlines at 10,500.   146hp.
I'm not a sport bike kinda guy.  But I do like
this new bike.

&gt;well considering the new sport bikes, the paragraph is still true to

&gt;ZX 14 Horsepower: 187 bhp @ 9500 rpm + 197 bhp Ram Air @ 9500 rpm,
&gt;dyno resuults on stock ZX 14's show 170 HP to the rear tire most
&gt;everywhere you look

&gt;heck bmw has more  ponies on thier sport bike at 167hp on the k1200s

&gt;Still I like that new buell, sweet machine, I like the fact they are
&gt;moving forward.

You miss the point friend. They are not building a 'Busa Buster.
Eric's target is the GSXR 750 and Ducati 996 etc. The new 1125R
measures well against those bikes.

The super high power, long wheelbase bikes are too much for the track
(or most urban riding).

Get to an inside pass track day(sponsored by Buell). You can ride one
all day long on the track :)

I regularly ride with some Buell engineers. We went for a small jaunt to
central WI last Sunday. Him on a new 1125R. A group of about a dozen
Ducatis pulls in to a gas station right as we are about to leave. Well,
until one of 'em noticed the MFG plates on the back of the 1125R. We
didn't get out of there for about a half hour :)

No it's original target was the 999R for substantially cheaper.
It will obliterate a GSXR750 it almost every category. *AND* make a much
better street bike, with it's flatter torque curve. And if it's like
past Buells(and I'm sure it is), it'll be a hoot to ride!

It'll wake yer ass up in a *hurry*.

I took the Keith Code California Superbike Class at Laguna Seca (on
the old 9-turn track, not the new 11-turn track).

We were on modified Ninja 600's. I was *way* slow in the corners
(relitive to my track mates) but coming out of turn 9 and blasting
down the straight, speed shifting using the rev light, I was clocked
(timed) at between 148mph and just under 160mph.

After my first lap, I had to pull into the pits and *tighten* my
helmet strap. And I mean, *tighten* it. I *thought* I had it tight...
in fact, uncomfortably tight. When I got up into the 140mph range, the
helmet buffeted so much that I *literally* could not see. A total
blur.

But.... it *was* a total blast. They hook ya with *just* enough track
time to get you used to the bike (and fast) and then pull ya off the
track. I begeed for more track time and the answer was, &quot;sign up for
the advanced class and you get XXX laps!&quot;.

Man, Keith really knows how to sell ya on his advanced class!! My
class was paid for as a BD present by a bunch of friends that got
together and pooled to pay for the class. It was *cheap* (by today's
standards: ~$165.00, IIRC) but the advanced class was something like 5
or 6 hunskie, again IIRC.

Preacher says, JUST DO IT! His advertisement says &quot;the most fun you

I'm not so sure it wouldn't be even more fun, with your clothes OFF!

Naah, not *THAT* much. I've done track days at R.A. in the past. My
&quot;Ulybolt&quot;(A Buell XB12STT with firebolt fairing and Ulysses tail and
bags). The XB12s can reach about 140-145 on the front straight. About
1/2 way down the straight, you're in 5th bouncing off the rev limiter on
an XB12. I have no way of knowing EXACTLY how fast I was going however.
Because I never looked down at the tach or speedo the whole day.

$165 is cheap for that class. Some of my friends are professional Buell
racers.

They've helped our 'lil group out with following us, and us following them.

I still think anyone who rides on 2 wheels should do a track day. You'll
learn more about your limits in one track day, than you can in a whole
season+ of riding on the street IMHO.

That was a long long LONNNNNNNG time ago. That's why I mentioned the
old 9-turn track vs. the &quot;new&quot; 11-turn track. Folks familiar with
Laguna know that, which just goes to show how 'familiar' *I* am with
it, since I can't remember fer shit when they upgraded it for FIA
&quot;rules&quot;.

I lived on the Mtry. Penninsula most of my life and I remember it was
a LOOOONNNGGG time ago, but CRS as far as how long ago. I have pics of
my ride and I can tell ya from looking at how skinny I was, that it
was a *LOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNG!* time ago &lt;G&gt;.

Hell, I probably weighed all of 160 lbs, which means I was in my
late-20's or *early* 30's. Born in '55 so, '84 -85.

$165 was a considerable amount for a &quot;one day class&quot; back then. I know
it took a few friends (plus my sis and her husband) to &quot;pitch in&quot; for
it. My BIL was as interested in being there as I was. He's a photog so
he &quot;got in for free&quot; and was able to get a bunch'a pics (he &quot;got
something&quot; out of it too?).

Anyway, point was, it was a long long long LONG time ago.

I 'bout *shit* last time I checked his prices for the Laguna Seca
(beginner?) class!

Cain't remember what it was, but remembering having to change my
shorts.

TMI?
