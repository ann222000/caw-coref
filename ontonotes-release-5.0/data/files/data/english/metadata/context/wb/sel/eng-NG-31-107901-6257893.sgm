Yes, that's the minimum definition of "professional". Depending on the
context, as you imply, the term connotes other qualities. Among them are
ethicality, skill, and depth of experience. Care to rate Krooger on those
qualities, or others of your choosing?

Since you wish to make a point of it, I don't really see how I can rate him on the above without
further knowledge.

I also don't do such things on demand from a troll bot.

It does seem that he has plenty of experience in the PC sound card / digital audio area for sure and
certain aspects of audio equipment testing fwiw.

Bwahahaha! You are such a fool, Poopie. Why don't you ask Krooger to
describe his "testing" environment. If, after learning the details of what
Krooger believes is "science", you don't realize how deluded he is, that
will reveal you're as pig-ignorant as Krooger is.

I've asked Poopie the aBxism Donkey several times to substantiate his

Can you name one single "subjectivist" who espouses such a viewpoint?

yesterday's admission to being a wannabe pimp, of course.

I've asked Poopie the aBxism Donkey several times to substantiate his
farty bleating. Here's my question for the Stupid Audio Donkey:

Can you name one single "subjectivist" who espouses such a viewpoint?

Now that Poopie has failed to take responsibility for his anti-quality
ranting, we can all see what kind of dirtball he is. This is on top of
yesterday's admission to being a wannabe pimp, of course.

Too bad donkeys aren't evolved enough to experience shame.

Uh.... I realize he's afraid to answer, Reynard, but that's not exactly
the point. For an anonymous Usenet coward, you seem remarkably unschooled
in the art of trolling.

You _fantasize_.
He is no doubt laughing at your desperate attempts to get an
