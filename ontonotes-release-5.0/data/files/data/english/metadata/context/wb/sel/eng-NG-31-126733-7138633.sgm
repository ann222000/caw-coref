Researchers have found that fibromyalgia is more common among the
siblings, parents and children of those who have fibromyalgia than in
the general population. But their research didn't clear up whether this
phenomenon was the result of nature or nurture. A new study funded by
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will examine the role nature
might play.

Jane Olson, PhD, a genetic researcher at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, recently began a four-year, $2 million project
to map genes in the selected relatives of 160 families with a history
of fibromyalgia. "We're searching for genes that may cause
fibromyalgia. If we find them, then we can learn about what's causing
the syndrome on a biological level," says Olson. She expects those
findings will help researchers develop effective treatments for
fibromyalgia.

In a previous study, Muhammad Yunus, MD, a rheumatologist at the
University of Illinois College of Medicine in Peoria, found a link
between fibromyalgia and a specific genetic marker by studying 40
families in which close relatives had fibromyalgia. That study was
limited, however, because it only looked at one genetic marker present
on the cells, notes Dr. Yunus, who will help conduct Dr. Olson's study
as a co-investigator.

Some researchers think psychological and social factors play a role in
fibromyalgia because the syndrome has been found in people who have
histories of physical and sexual abuse, alcoholism or depression in
their families. To address these concerns, Olson plans to examine
psychological and stress factors in her study, too.

Whether there is a genetic cause of fibromyalgia has been a contentious
topic for researchers to explore, notes David Sherry, MD, director of
pediatric rheumatology at the Children's Hospital in Seattle. "Proving
this is like proving the nature vs. nurture aspects of overweight
children," he says. Families and doctors both hold strong opinions and
it's easy to offend one side or the other. Plus, the criteria for
diagnosing fibromyalgia tend to be subjective, and that makes it hard
to research psychological or genetic factors in a statistical way, Dr.
Sherry adds.

Other researchers are examining familial tendencies toward pain
syndromes in general, not just toward fibromyalgia. The NIH recently
awarded Lesley Arnold, MD, a rheumatologist at the University of
Cincinnati, a grant to study the prevalence of irritable bowel
syndrome, migraines, chronic fatigue syndrome and mood disorders in the
close relatives of people with fibromyalgia.
