As Dollar Crumples, Tourists Overseas Reel

By Mark Landler*

The steep decline of the dollar against the euro has made eye-popping prices
a lamentable part of the traveler's tale.

A day after Michael Kingsley arrived in this romantic university town, he
was in no mood to savor the cobblestone streets, the half-timbered houses or
the flower-bedecked windows - to say nothing of the camera-ready castle on
the hill.

Mr. Kingsley had left his camera battery and charger in a hotel room in
London, and he knew that as an American tourist, buying replacements here
was going to sting. The damage: $143. Back home in Falls Church, Va., he
said, the same purchase would have set him back no more than $100.

For Americans visiting Europe this summer, the steep decline of the dollar
against the euro and the British pound has made eye-popping prices a
lamentable part of the traveler's tale. (The Kingsley family's hotel room in
London was $500 a night; five bite-sized chocolates at Harrods cost $10.)

&quot;It's O.K.,&quot; said Mr. Kingsley, 59, with a resigned laugh. &quot;I'll just have
to work a few extra years to pay off this vacation.&quot; His wife, Laura, did
her best to soothe him. &quot;It's just play money,&quot; she said.

By now, five summers after the dollar began its long swoon against the euro
and the pound, American travelers are used to $5 cups of coffee and
triple-digit dinner checks in Europe's great capitals. But the dollar's
latest plunge - to $2.05 to the pound and to a record of $1.38 to the euro -
has turned mere sticker shock into a form of suspended disbelief for many
tourists.

For Kaelon Kroft, a custodian from San Bernardino, Calif., it was the cost
of Coke that shocked him most in Paris. &quot;We just paid 9.5 euros for a can of
Coke at a cafe,&quot; he said. &quot;At our hotel, the bar was serving a glass of Coke
for four euros.&quot;

&quot;That's over five bucks,&quot; his wife, Kristi, added. Actually, at the current
exchange rate, it is a fizzy bubble or two over $5.52.

The Krofts and the Kingsleys both scaled back their European holidays to
limit the pain of the currency pinch. But neither family seriously thought
of canceling the vacation, and their glass-is-half-full determination to
make the best of things was echoed in interviews with American tourists from
Ireland to Italy.

It is also reflected in the tourism statistics in France, Germany, Spain and
other countries, which show that the number of Americans visiting Europe has
increased this year, even as the value of the dollar has eroded. Travel
experts say this speaks both to the resilience and rising affluence of
American tourists, as well as to the perennial appeal of Europe as a
destination.

&quot;Americans who visit Europe tend to be more educated, with higher incomes,
so they are less affected by the exchange rate,&quot; said Joachim Scholz, a
researcher at the German National Tourist Board. &quot;Even backpackers have more
money than they used to, if you look at the price of hostels.&quot;

Americans spent $3.8 billion on travel-related services in Europe in the
first quarter of this year, a 5.5 percent increase from the quarter a year
ago, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. They spent $22.8 billion
in 2006, nearly 10 percent more than in 2002, when the dollar was close to
parity with the euro.

That should be a relief to innkeepers and restaurateurs here, because many
currency experts say the dollar - pulled down by the combination of a
persistent trade deficit with the rest of the world, a slower American
economy and an unexpectedly vigorous Europe - has not reached bottom against
the euro.

Ashraf Laidi, chief currency strategist at CMC Markets in New York,
described the dollar's decline as &quot;pervasive.&quot; He predicts that it could
trade at $1.42 to the euro by the end of this year. The outlook for
Americans in Britain is better: Mr. Laidi thinks the dollar is close to its
nadir against the pound.

Across the Atlantic, the weaker dollar has encouraged a European travel boom
to the United States. And the currency changes are spurring a shift in
trade, with American exports to the rest of the world picking up even as
European officials are becoming louder in their complaints that the cheaper
dollar is undermining the global competitiveness of their manufacturers.

In the last 12 months, the dollar has declined 8.9 percent against the euro
and 9.9 percent against the pound. But the erosion has been most striking
over the last few weeks, after many Americans had already booked their
European trips. Most appear to have held on to their bookings.

&quot;A lot of Americans purchase their packages in the U.S., and pay in dollars,
so they don't even notice,&quot; said Thierry Baudier, the chief executive of
Maison de la France, the French tourism board. &quot;Once they arrive, it's too
late.&quot;

Mark Trotter, a high school teacher from Fresno, Calif., taking 27 students
on a tour of Madrid and Barcelona, said he watched with alarm as the dollar
sank in the last two weeks. But nobody pulled out of the trip, which he
leads each summer, and he said this was his largest group ever.

&quot;I remember doing this trip for $2,100 as recently as 2003,&quot; Mr. Trotter
said, standing beneath the stone columns in Madrid's main square. &quot;This year
it cost $2,800. But in all honesty, parents don't even blink.&quot;

To be sure, tourists are making some adjustments to their itineraries or
their spending habits. Paris has increasingly become a weekend destination
for American tourists, Mr. Baudier said, reflecting a trend toward shorter
European vacations.

In Ireland, a group of students from Virginia opted to skip a visit to the
Waterford crystal factory, 100 miles south of Dublin. They are also cutting
back on casual purchases.

&quot;I have to be much more aware of looking at the price of everything,&quot; said
Erin Rogers, 21, still marveling at a $22 plate of Irish stew she ordered
the previous evening. &quot;I didn't have a clear compass of just how weak the
dollar was. It was a crash course in global economics.&quot;

The Krofts decided not to extend their stay in Paris, as they had hoped,
because of the cost. Next year, Kristi Kroft said, their family of four
would probably go to Hawaii or the Virgin Islands, where a dollar is worth
100 cents.

Mr. Kingsley, a strategic planner with the Army Corps of Engineers, had
plotted a grand tour of Europe that would have taken him, his wife, and
their 33-year-old son, Josh, to London, Paris, Rome and Vienna, before
ending up in Germany, to attend the wedding of a family friend.

As the dollar wilted in recent weeks, Mr. Kingsley crossed off one city
after another, eventually leaving only London and Germany. &quot;I would have
loved to go to Vienna,&quot; Mrs. Kingsley said sadly.

The currency squeeze is toughest on Americans who live in Europe and are
paid in dollars. They suffer from erosion in their real income that, in many
cases, is not fully compensated by their employers.

&quot;It's scary,&quot; said Jennifer Aquino, who lives in Madrid and manages
international alumni relations for Bentley College in Waltham, Mass. &quot;It
makes you think twice about if you want to keep building a life in Europe.&quot;

Maddine Insalaco, who runs a landscape-painting workshop in Tuscany with her
husband, Joe Vinson, said business had been crippled because their costs
were in euros while their revenue was in dollars. &quot;It's a mom-and-pop
operation,&quot; she said. &quot;We're too small to hedge our risks in terms of
foreign exchange.&quot;

Worse, most of their clients are American, and as the euro has spiked,
enrollment has dwindled. Still, Ms. Insalaco and other Americans are
philosophical about the vagaries of currency markets. &quot;When the dollar was
strong, no one was complaining,&quot; she said. &quot;We cashed in then.&quot;

Among some, there is even a sense that turnabout is fair play. Linda Miller,
a frequent visitor to Europe from Honolulu, was browsing the other day in
the gift shop at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin.

Recalling how she and her husband, Stephen, an eye surgeon, had lived large
on earlier trips to Europe, Ms. Miller said, &quot;We have always thought that
America got away with something.&quot;
