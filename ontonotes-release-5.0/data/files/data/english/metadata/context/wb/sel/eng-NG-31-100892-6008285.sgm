Bond (1)

That to be both, a mystic and or Kantian, you have to, by necessity,
believe that any
and all of man's ideas theories and or concepts of his knowledge of
reality need not be,
by absolute necessity, directly linked to sensory evidence, which
exists as it exists
without contradiction. e.g. the Kantians claim space and time are
concepts of man's knowlwdge which need have no meaning nor have any
direct link to sensory evidence
in the origin of their meaning, they claim that both are concepts with
a requirement
of total imagination.

Bond (2)
That both the mystics and the Kantians ideas, theories and concepts of
their
knowledge of reality require there be a standard of contant
uncertainity.
e.g. the Kantians say, uncertainty is the only certainty, meaning there
is even
uncertainty in their meaning of certainty, so just how the clowns can
even make such statements "as the only certainty is uncertainty", is
beyond any comprehension
and of course the mystics use that exact very standard of uncertainty
to claim that
their god exists because no-one can be certain that it doesn't exist.

I. Of the difference between Pure and Empirical Knowledge

For how is it possible that the faculty of cognition should be
awakened into exercise otherwise than by means of objects which affect
our senses, and partly of themselves produce representations, partly
rouse our powers of understanding into activity, to compare to

our sensuous impressions into a knowledge of objects, which is called
experience? In respect of time, therefore, no knowledge of ours is

I take it, then, that Gordgians believe they did have knowledge of
time antecedent to experience.  Interesting.  How do they think they
acquired it?   And how (considering that Gordgians pay lip service to
non-contradiction) do they square that with the Gordgian doctrine that
time doesn't really exist?

If you take Buddhist epistomology into account, which is very often
lambasted as mystical, mind-objects (concepts and emotions) are very
much sensory objects-- sensed and percieved by the mind. The five
physical senses in many mystical epistemologies found in India are not
the only modes of empirical awareness.

No you stupid cunt George, existence of someTHING BEFORE knowledge of
ANYTHING.

There HAS to be some THING existing and or happening for man to claim
ANY knowledge of ANYthing.

Knowledge is a RESULT of a PROCESS, knowledge does NOT cause
knowledge.

EXISTENCE IS the begining, IS the axiom of man's knowledge, the data
gained by man's senses is identified and integrated WITHOUT
CONTRADICTION and the RESULT is called knowledge.

The thing BEFORE, the THING **giving rise** to man's knowledge of time
is action.

Time is a relational concept, specigfically between two events,
measured in the duration of an action.

The standard of ALL time, for man's knowledge, is one revolution of
the earth around the sun.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  What knowledge do Gordgian thinks

The answer is:

Your question is not a question, its idiotic Kantian fucking nonsense.

Read my lips bozo.

Reason is the ONLY means of man's knowledge.

Knowledge defined as, a mental construction of man's understanding of
the existing world around him.

Therefore, to have or to claim, ANY knowledge of ANY subject, there
HAS to be some THING existing in - sensory reality - for man to be
conscious of and to form his knowledge OF.

Knowledge is NOT the beginning of man's knowledge, that is just
stupid, EXISTENCE IS.

There is NO SUCH thing as, (contrary to that stupid as all fuck
Kantian idea) of man having *innate knowledge*.

There is no such thing as, "the knowledge of time beginning with
time", that is just stupid beyond words.

How are you coping so far dopey?

Man's knowledge is formed of existence, WHICH exists as it exists
without contradiction and as can only be perceived by man's senses.

To be identified and intergrated to form his knowledge of THAT and
EACH existent by man's faculty of reason.

Reason, I have defined as, a faculty of man of, non-contradictory
identification and integration of the perceptions of man's senses,
eyes, ears, nose feel touch - identified and intergrated WITHOUT
CONTRADICTION.

e.g. how did you go trying to place your cat exactly where your dog
sits at the same instant?

Did that take a mental picture to stop you or was it clawed balls?

NOTE the use of man's senses does NOT rule out man using machines and
or even other animals e.g. trained dogs, to sense, e.g. finding human
beings buried under snow etc etc.

Knowledge is contextual and hierarchical.

This is not what many if most mystics claim.  I assume you are using
´mystics´in a pejorative sense of your own making.  Many mystics -
usual sense of the word - claim to have experience of God and describe
this and the relationship.  Thus basing their own certainty on
experience, much like anybody else bases their assumptions adn
assertions about whatever entities they believe in: themselves, other
people, animals as subjects as examples of sentient entities many
believe based on their experiences.  That you assume mystics
experiences of God are hallucinations or wishful self-convincing doesn
´t change the fact that you misrepresented their claims.  I have heard
or read Fundamentalists and other churchgoers and those who believe in
God or whatever because of habit, authority, their parents, tradition,
etc.make such idiotic claims about God existing because no one can
prove it otherwise.  Perhaps that is what you mean by mystics.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

A mystic, I define, is any person who claims to have gained any
knowledge through their imagination, e.g. the silly Kantian / mystics
are always saying things like *man's knowledge is imagined*

They, the Kantians use phrases like *man's knowledge is subjective*
which means *imagined, whimmed and not reality or linked to sensory
reality* and or they will say, *man experiences his knowledge* or *man
gains all of his knowledge of everything, except space and time, by
experience*.

But just why the Kantians say man doesn't or cant experience those
things which in sensory reality which give rise to the concepts of
space and time, is a mystery the Kantians are required never to
divulge, for fear of the rule of non-contradiction requirement, to
then trash any and all of the other silly Kantian crap.

Explain HOW you *experience* a tree, a dog, a boat, a plane, a storm,
the sun, the moon, a cat, a car, a child, a table a chair and explain
why man ought not use that exact same standard to claim experience of
a god.

What makes a god exempt from those sensory perceptual and real
*experiences* to be identified by man without contradiction?

That idea has a long tradition in Western philosophy as well; nowadays
the postulated mental sense is called 'intuition,' though various
philosophers have called it other things as well, like 'understanding'
and (most confusingly) "reason."  Here's an example typed in from
Thomas Aquinas' /Summa Theologica/:

"Now, a truth can come into the mind in two ways, namely, as known in
itself, and as known through another.  What is known in itself is like
a principle, and is *perceived immediately by the mind*.  And so the
habit which perfects the intellect in in considering such a truth is
called 'understanding'; it is a firm and easy quality of mind which
sees into principles.'

And all fundies are just as certain of the truth of their beliefs as
the anti-fundy OP.  Which shows that 'certainty' and 'uncertainty' are
being classified wrongly in terms of 'objective' and 'subjective'.  If
a fact is subjective (for example, "I'm feeling pain" or "I seem to
see a calendar"), then it's true if one believes it's true, and
there's no reason to be uncertain of it.  It's only the belief in mind-
independent or objective facts - and therefore statements that can be
false although believed true, or true though believed false - that
opens the door to uncertainty about one's beliefs.

Nothing.  I think you are confusing people who believe in God or other
so called supernatural entities out of habit, submission to authority,
tradition, listening to their parents, guilt, lack of self-respect and
so on.  Mystics have experiences, experiences by the way that often
put them at odds with the nearest church.

I think you are making a good point and all the monotheists who come
up with contorted definitions of faith deserve to find themselves
locked in a room with your arguments, but the mystics I have read have
described experiences of God and other entities.  I am not a
Christian, but I do believe in the existence of sentient entities that
you no doubt do not, but I base my beliefs, or better put my beliefs
have arisen out of experience.

As a different tack: thinking that animals had emotions and were
subjects, had consciousness and all that was considered mystical.  We
cannot sense these things, the hard ass distrusting of intuition
scientists said.  In other words if you thought your dog was sad when
you left him alone in the house, you were a mystic, if a boring one.
Talk about denying the obvious.

Mind you, Kant never thought we could have intuitive knowledge of the
noumenal or mind-indepenent world, either.  In contrast to most of his
precursors - Aquinas, Descartes, even Locke - he argued that
'intuitions' - a term which he confusingly applied both to sensory
perceptions and 'pure' intellectual insights - belonged to what he
called 'phenomenal' reality, or what I believe Buddhists call maya.

"Mind you, Kant never thought we could have intuitive knowledge of the
noumenal or mind-indepenent world, either."

Well, that's all the more case for how Kant was unlike the mystics, at
least the Buddhist ones. At least I would say that he reached the
climax of what intellectualization could yield in terms of what is
real. In the Buddha's teachings, it is clear that Right Understanding
is part of how we become aware of how things are, though it is a lived
teaching, not really separate from the other seven aspects of the
Eightfold Path. I think there is something to be said about what you
call a confusing application of "intuition." The ability to be aware
of awareness itself is facilitated by, first of all, awareness of the
conditioned genesis of phenomenal reality. The illusion ("maya") part
comes in when we make the mistake that phenomenal reality, or some
essential aspect that it ultimately reflects, is what there really is;
or, more precisely, when we take phenomenal reality to be ultimately
satisfying.

Reason is the only means to man's knowledge.

Reason is a TWO legged process, reason is rendered totally impotent,
totally USELESS unless BOTH are used.

The two legs of reason are:

Man's sense perceptions of existing matter or the results caused by
matter reacting e.g. energy or action AND logic

Sensory perceptions of existing sensory matter AND THEN non-
contradictory identification and integration of the data gained by the
perceptions of the senses is what forms man's knowledge.

That process can happen as quick as a reflex, indeed there are
situations where your death is certain unless you do reason as instant
as a reflex and or the reasoning can take several years.

*Innate knowledge* is Kantian derived idiotic nonsensical
contradicting trash designed to keep you stupid George.

Knowledge is the RESULT of a two part process.

NO matter means there is nothing to have any knowledge of.

Even the mystics will tell you that, man cant *know* god, but just how

Wow, you have no self respect.  I am saying it is based on
experience.  Which goes against the assertion in your first post which
you are now pretending you did not make.  You claimed that mystics
think that since there was no proof there was no God there was a God.
Remember?  This implies that mystics use logic and poor logic as a
base.  This contradicts the texts mystics have written where they talk
about their experiences of God.  Now you want to shift the issue.  You
clearly don´t know what the word ´mystic´means and you are the kind of
person who cannot admit you are wrong.  I have no respect for that.  I
leave you to slug it out with you pet peeve the Kantians.

Oh, yes.  Just in case you try to slip around this.  You made a claim
about HOW THEY CLAIM TO KNOW THERE IS A GOD.  In this you are wrong.

Now you want to move the discussion into whether they are right to
consider their EXPERIENCES the same as the other ones we have both
listed.

That is another issue.

&gt; &gt; I am not up on Kantians.

&gt; You dont think and Kantians dont think, you are up on Kantianism
&gt; indeed as high up as it is possible to get.

&gt; To think means to reason.

&gt; You telling the world that the mystics experience god in the identical
&gt; manner that you experience a table leg, a dog, a cat, a tree is just
&gt; too fucking stupid for words and is a total rejection of reason and a

Dopey ignorant arrogant commie cunt, your challenge is to substantiate
your claim by giving an example of a single piece of man's knowledge
of reality derived soley from this other *mode* that you are crapping

Liar, I have said a zillion times that mystics dont think.

Thinking means the application of reason is in process, god exists in
the mystic's mind as a result of ***faith**** and NOT reason.

Faith is the acceptance of an idea without any evidence, without any
SENSORY evidence for the acceptance of that idea.

Whereas, ideas or claims of knoweldge accepted by the process of
reason are, ideas based upon the process of non-contradictory
identification and integration of the data gathered from man's sensory
perceptions of exising matter.

No matter means there is NOTHING to reason.

ME? thats a fucking joke coming from you.

Mystics claim knowledge through the use faith, as defined above,
you're as mystical as they get.

What the fuck are you on about now?

Mystics will tell you things like *man cant know god*, they also say
things like, *you dont question the existence of god you just accept
it* or *just believe god and it will be* or *god requires 100%
commitment to 100% faith* (which as it happens is true) and if you've
never heard a mystic say any of those things, then you know as much
about mystics as you do about thinking, which is NOTHING, but the
mystics wont tell you how come they can claim knowledge of something
which they also claim man cant know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

YOUR claim is that mystics experience god like anyone else experiences
a tree, its now time to prove your very serious accusation.

Give the definition of the mystic's god, which has been given by a
mystic of course, who claims their definition of it comes from them
being able to experience it, in the identical manner in which you
claim anyone experiences a tree, a dog, a cat, a table.

Include the things and information just like anyone normal would
rationally expect for any other existing experienced matter e.g.
colour, size, shape, smell, age, weight, where, when, how long
existing, does it have eyes, what colour are they, ears nose big or
small, human or animal, male or female, does it wear anything e.g.
like clothes, who else saw it, what time, what date, was it sitting or
standing, lying down or walking, running maybe, what's different about
it to a rock or a mud puddle, where was it existing, and here's a real
tricky one for them, ask them to explain how come others cant see it
the same way he does etc etc etc

You cant just make statements at a philosophy forum and expect them to
be taken seriously without offering something other than subjective
Kantian inspired piffle you know, ask chazzzzzzzz.

&gt; &gt; You share more in common with the mystics in your false adherence to
&gt; &gt; absolute certaintyLets test that theory with a couple of question that you and your
&gt; Kantian stupidity directly give rise to.

&gt; How the fuck does a Kantian recognise, let alone define, certainty,
&gt; when according to you silly Kantians, there can be no certainty to be
&gt; had about anything, not even about uncertainty of certainty, chazzzz?

&gt; Second question remaining unanswered for over a year now.

That is only because you are too fucking stupid to understand
anything.
Only dickheads like you and the other mystics rely on certainty. Most
interlligent people are happy enough with personal certainty, and wise
enough to be able to reject it when the situation arises. If you had a
brain your would realise that what you see as absolute certainty is
actually probability.

&gt; &gt; Without any experience, what could you reason about?
&gt; &gt; You reason about the
&gt; &gt; *matter* of existence, as perceived by your
&gt; &gt; senses
">

Your senses perceive 'matter' without you experiencing (being aware)
that you perceive it.  IOW, you're not aware - you don't know, or even
think, that you're perceiving any 'matter'.   How in the hell can you
'reason' about something when you're not even aware of it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and then identified and integrated into the result which man
&gt; calls knowledge, without contradiction.

Meanwhile you don't experience any of it.  You're like a zombie, or a
cockroach - you're body 'perceives', but your mind isn't aware of
anything that happens.  All this 'reasoning' and 'knowledge' happens
without you knowing that any of it is happening.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No matter matters not, you cant have ANY knowledge if there is no

You do like to keep changing the subject like that; probably because
you know how how stupid your thesis is:  that you can have 'knowledge'
automatically, without your mind experiencing anything.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Reason is the only means to man's knowledge.

Then try using it sometime.  If you can't experience your perceptions,
you can't think about them; and therefore you can't reason about
them.  So what are Gordgians aware of?  All that's left is your
imagination.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Reason is a TWO legged process, reason is rendered totally impotent,
&gt; totally USELESS unless BOTH are used.

&gt; The two legs of reason are:

&gt; Man's sense perceptions of existing matter or the results caused by
&gt; matter reacting e.g. energy or action AND logic
">

Gordgian epistemology cuts off both legs.  By denying that you can
experience (be aware of) any of your perceptions, it denies that you
can know what any of them are; and by doing that, which leaves you
nothing to reason about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sensory perceptions of existing sensory matter AND THEN non-
&gt; contradictory identification and integration of the data gained by the
&gt; perceptions of the senses is what forms man's knowledge.
">

No exerience, no perception and no sense data.  All you have left is
your imagination, and whatever 'non-contradictory integration' you
choose to do on that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That process can happen as quick as a reflex, indeed there are
&gt; situations where your death is certain unless you do reason as instant
&gt; as a reflex and or the reasoning can take several years.
">

Which is why the Gordgian option, of 'reasoning' about things you
don't experience - whatever you imagine or make up - is  a non-
starter:  It can literally get you killed.
