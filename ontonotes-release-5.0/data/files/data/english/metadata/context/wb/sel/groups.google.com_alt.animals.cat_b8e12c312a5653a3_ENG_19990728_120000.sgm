UGLY
Everyone in the apartment complex I lived in knew who Ugly was. Ugly was
the resident tomcat.
Ugly loved three things in this world: fighting, eating garbage, and shall we
say, love.
The combination of these things combined with a life spent outside had
their effect on Ugly.To start with, he had only one eye, and where the
other should have been was a gaping hole. He was also missing his ear on
the same side, his left foot appeared to have been badly broken at one
time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, making him look like he was always
turning the corner. His tail has long since been lost, leaving only the smallest

stub, which he would constantly jerk and twitch. Ugly would have been a
dark gray tabby striped-type, except for the sores covering his head, neck,
even his shoulders with thick, yellowing scabs. Every time someone saw Ugly
there was the same reaction. &quot;That's one UGLY cat!!&quot;
All the children were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks at him,
hosed him down, squirted him when he tried to come in their homes,or shut his
paws in the door when he would not leave.
Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the hose on him, he would stand
there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. If you threw things at him, he
would curl his lanky body around feet in forgiveness. Whenever he spied
children, he would come running meowing frantically and bump his head against
their hands, begging for their love. If ever picked up he would immediately
begin suckling on your shirt, earrings, whatever he could find.
One day Ugly shared his love with the neighbors huskies. They did not respond
kindly, and Ugly was badly mauled. From my apartment I could hear his
screams,and I tried to rush to his side. By the time I got to where he was
laying, it was apparent Ugly's sad life was almost at an end.
Ugly lay in a wet circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly out of
shape, a gaping tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his front. As I
picked him up and tried to carry him home I could hear him wheezing and gasping,
and could feel him struggling. I must be hurting him terribly I thought. Then I
felt a familiar tugging, sucking sensation on my ear- Ugly, in so much pain,
suffering and obviously dying was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer
to me, and he bumped the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one
golden eye towards me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in
the greatest pain, that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a little
affection, perhaps some compassion. At that moment I thought Ugly was the most
beautiful, loving creature I had ever seen. Never once did he try to bite or
scratch me, or even try to get away from me, or struggle in any way. Ugly just
looked up at me completely trusting in me to relieve his pain. Ugly died in my
arms before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time
afterwards, thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could so
alter my opinion about what it means to have true pureness of spirit, to love so
totally and truly.
Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books, lectures,
or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always be thankful. He had
been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside,and it was time for
me to move on and learn to love truly and deeply. To give my total to those I
cared for.
Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for
me... I will always try to be Ugly.

Liked the story - quite sad really. However, cats will also purr when in
pain.

"/> When my husband and I were first dating, he was late for a date one Saturday.
Turned out that, on the way to my place, he'd seen the car ahead of him hit a cat
and keep going. He slammed on the brakes, pulled over, and went to the cat. It was
clearly dying, but not yet dead. He picked it up, took it to the side of the road,
and held and petted it till it died, and then left a note for its family, should
they find it, to let them know what had happened.

On his way to a hot date with a new chick on a Saturday night, he took the time to
see to it that a cat didn't die alone. It was right then I knew I would love him
till the day that I died.

"/> I am sorry, I am not able to answer the original message
I want to say thank you to Lynn for her text about Ugly. She is right, it
makes one think, and feel miserable.

Perhaps someone, somewhere, would like to read the story in french. I put
here the translation I made

L'Affreux

Chacun, dans l'ensemble résidentiel où j'habite, connaissait Affreux. C'était
le matou de l'immeuble.

Affreux aimait trois choses dans ce bas monde : se battre, se nourrir de
détritus, et, si onpeut dire
ainsi, aimer.

La combinaison de ces trois activités, et d'une vie passée dehors, avait
marqué Affreux. Pour
commencer, il ne possédait plus qu'un œil; là où l'autre aurait dû se
trouver, il n'y avait plus qu'un trou
béant.

Du même coté, il lui manquait aussi une oreille. Sa patte gauche semblait
avoir été méchamment
cassée, et s'était remise avec un angle curieux, lui donnant toujours
l'allure de tourner un coin.

De sa queue, perdue il y a bien longtemps, ne subsistait qu'un moignon qu'il
agitait constamment de
façon saccadée.

Affreux aurait pu ressembler à un chat-tigré gris sombre, si ce n'étaient les
plaies couvrant sa tête, son
cou et ses épaules d'épaisses croûtes jaunes.

Chaque fois que quelqu'un apercevait Affreux, il avait la même réaction:
&quot;Quel AFFREUX chat !!&quot;.

On interdisait aux enfants d'y toucher; les adultes lui jetaient des pierres,
l'arrosaient au jet d'eau,
l'éjectaient de chez eux quand il essayait d'y entrer, ou lui coinçaient les
pattes dans la porte quand il
ne voulait pas sortir.

Affreux avait toujours la même réaction. Si vous dirigiez un tuyau d'arrosage
vers lui, il restait là,
immobile, se laissant tremper, jusqu'à ce que vous laissiez tomber et
quittiez le terrain. Si vous lui
lanciez des choses, il enroulait son corps maigre autour de vos pieds, en
signe de pardon. Quand il
observait les enfants, il accourrait vers eux, miaulant frénétiquement, et
poussait sa tête sur leurs
mains, mendiant leur amitié. S'il était jamais pris dans les bras, il
commençait immédiatement à téter
votre chemise, vos boucles d'oreilles, tout ce qu'il pouvait atteindre.

Un jour Affreux offrit de partager son amour aux chiens esquimaud du voisin.
Ils ne lui répondirent pas
gentiment, et Affreux fut gravement malmené. De mon appartement je pouvais
entendre ses cris, et
j'essayais de me précipiter à son secours. Le temps que j'arrive à ses côtés,
il gisait sur le flanc. De
toute évidence, la triste vie d'Affreux touchait presque à sa fin. Affreux
reposait dans une marre
humide, les pattes arrières et les reins fortement tordus, la marque de
fourrure blanche de son front
trouée d'une blessure béante.

Alors que je le ramassais et tentais de le ramener à la maison, je pouvais
entendre sa respiration
sifflante et haletante, et je le sentais se débattre. Je pense que je devais
lui faire horriblement mal.
Soudain, je sentis sur mon oreille une sensation familière de succion.
Affreux, au milieux de toutes ses
souffrances, de toute évidence en train de mourir,, essayait de me lécher
l'oreille? Je le rapprochais
de moi, et il poussa sa tête contre la paume de ma main, puis il me regarda
de son unique œil doré, et
je pus distinctement l'entendre ronronner. Même au milieu des plus grandes
douleurs, cet affreux chat
battu et terrorisé ne demandait qu'un peu d'affection, qu'un peu de
compassion peut-être.

A cet instant, je pensai qu'Affreux était la plus belle et aimante créature
que j'ai jamais rencontré. Pas
une seule fois il avait essayé de me mordre, de me griffer, ou même de se
dégager de moi ou de se
débattre de quelque façon que ce soit.

Affreux me regardait, tout simplement, me faisant pleine confiance pour
soulager sa douleur.

Affreux mourut dans mes bras avant que j'ai pu rentrer chez moi, mais, je
m'assis et le gardais
longtemps dans les bras, méditant sur le fait qu'un pauvre animal effrayé et
déformé pouvait infléchir
mes idées sur ce que signifiait la possession d'une vraie pureté de l'âme, la
démonstration d'un amour
aussi vrai et absolu.

Affreux m'en a appris plus sur le don de soi et la compassion q'un millier de
livres, de lectures ou de
conférences spécialisées ne pourraient jamais le faire, et de cela, je serais
à jamais reconnaissant.

Il avait eu peur de son environnement, mais j'avais peur de l'intérieur, et
il était temps pour moi de
changer et d'apprendre à aimer vraiment et profondément. De me donner à fond
à ceux que j'aimais.

Bien des gens veulent être plus riches, mieux réussir, être plus aimés, plus
beaux, mais, quant à moi,
j'essaierais toujours de ressembler à Affreux.

It made me sad, too. But it also made me extremely angry. Angry that no one
cared enought about this wonderful creature until his dying moments to step
in, take him in and give him the care and love he so obviously craved.
Where was this narrator when all this abuse was going on?

A clear case of a little too much, a little too late.

This is, of course, assuming this animal did indeed exist and that this is
not just another urban legend.

But I did cry. Cried because sometimes its not our human ACTS that are
cruel, but our APATHY. Just so you know, I have this &quot;urban
legend&quot;/&quot;anecdote&quot;/whatever you want to call it up on my cats' web site.

I don't know if this story is true or not but I bawled all the same.
It doesn't matter if &quot;Ugly&quot; ever existed or not-there are thousands
like him in every city, and it breaks my heart.

It also breaks my heart that people can be so mean spirited and cruel.

UGLY
Everyone in the apartment complex I lived in knew who Ugly was. Ugly was
the resident tomcat.
Ugly loved three things in this world: fighting, eating garbage, and
shall we say, love.

The combination of these things combined with a life spent outside had
their effect on Ugly.To start with, he had only one eye, and where the
other should have been was a gaping hole. He was also missing his ear on
the same side, his left foot appeared to have been badly broken at one
time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, making him look like he was
always turning the corner. His tail has long since been lost, leaving
only the smallest stub, which he would constantly jerk and twitch.

Ugly would have been a dark gray tabby striped-type, except for the
sores covering his head, neck, even his shoulders with thick, yellowing
scabs. Every time someone saw Ugly there was the same reaction.

&quot;That's one UGLY cat!!&quot;

All the children were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks
at him, hosed him down, squirted him when he tried to come in their
homes,or shut his paws in the door when he would not leave.

Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the hose on him, he
would stand there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. If you
threw things at him, he would curl his lanky body around feet in
forgiveness. Whenever he spied children, he would come running meowing
frantically and bump his head against their hands, begging for their
love. If ever picked up he would immediately begin suckling on your
shirt, earrings, whatever he could find.

One day Ugly shared his love with the neighbors huskies. They did not
respond kindly, and Ugly was badly mauled. From my apartment I could
hear his screams,and I tried to rush to his side. By the time I got to
where he was laying, it was apparent Ugly's sad life was almost at an
end.

Ugly lay in a wet circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly
out of shape, a gaping tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his
front. As I picked him up and tried to carry him home I could hear him
wheezing and gasping, and could feel him struggling. I must be hurting
him terribly I thought. Then I felt a familiar tugging, sucking
sensation on my ear- Ugly, in so much pain, suffering and obviously
dying was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer to me, and he
bumped the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one golden
eye towards me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in
the greatest pain, that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a
little affection, perhaps some compassion.

At that moment I thought Ugly was the most beautiful, loving creature I
had ever seen. Never once did he try to bite or scratch me, or even try
to get away from me, or struggle in any way. Ugly just looked up at me
completely trusting in me to relieve his pain. Ugly died in my arms
before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time
afterwards, thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could
so alter my opinion about what it means to have true pureness of
spirit, to love so totally and truly.

Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books,
lectures, or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always
be thankful. He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on
the inside,and it was time for me to move on and learn to love truly
and deeply. To give my total to those I cared for.

Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful,
but for me... I will always try to be Ugly.

It's obvious you don't have the capability to see beyond the words. A
story does not have to be true to hold meaning.

You are a compassionless sorry excuse for a person and I hope you have
no animals who suffer from your lack of understanding.

BTW....it didn't have to be a cat....it could have been a homeless
person....a dog....anyone or anything that could have benefitted from
kindness and compassion as opposed to the reality of neglect and abuse,
and about the one thing we all have in common-a need for love and
affection.

As my mother used to say....open your mind and your heart....and shut
your mouth.

I don't know why I'm letting myself get sucked into this crap. Jon, you
just sneered at the gullibility of these readers, then you tell a
whopper about quadraplegia and brain tumors. If that is indeed so, I am
very sorry, but you have given us every reason to doubt you, and to find
your motives suspect. The story about Ugly is about you. You are
acting it out for us on several levels. Your attitude and point of view
are truly ugly, and reading your posts makes me feel ugly. If I were to
be swept along with you in your ugliness, I would use your tricks
against you. For instance, if it's inoperable, how is it that you are
recovering? (You pulled that one on someone named Ginny, I believe.)
I wonder why you work so hard at making people feel bad. I suppose I
could buy your story about your health, that would provide a nice pat
answer. But you wouldn't want me to be too gullible, would you? I wish
for you that you could read the original story (whether or not it is
true is not the point, and the overdose of saccharine-poisoned
responses is beside the point) and take something away from it for
yourself. Long ago I broke myself of wasting time on lost causes, so I
don't know why I'm making an exception for you, and I'm not going to
waste any more of my time. When there is so much to do and so little
time, why do people waste it trying to make other people as miserable as
they are?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am always amazed by how easily you American women are
&gt;&gt;&gt;taken in by this crap. Your gullability is in inverse proportion to
&gt;&gt;&gt;your slender grip on reality.

&gt;&gt;&gt;--
&gt;&gt;&gt;Jon

&gt;&gt;First of all Jon, gullability (as I was raised to understand it),
means that
&gt;&gt;a person believes a story. If you go back and read the story, it says
that
&gt;&gt;the story is not true. I knew it was not true when I posted that but
it was
&gt;&gt;still a very sad story.

&gt; No, you actually said &quot;I don't know if this story is true or not&quot; Now
&gt; you admit it's fiction. There is nothing in the original story that
&gt; says that it's fiction. This is not a forum for fiction. This is a
&gt; newsgroup for cat health and behaviour topics. I don't have a
&gt; problem about anyone feeling bad about real stuff. Heaven knows
&gt; there are enough things in this world to feel bad about. Try a dose
&gt; of reality.

&gt;&gt;Second, you are a troll and a bad one at that. I have read two of
your posts
&gt;&gt;this morning, both of them are insults to people in this group. So be
gone
&gt;&gt;with you.

&gt; I am a quadraplegic recovering with an inoperable brain tumour (sorry
&gt; that's tumor in your simplified spelling). I cry myself to sleep each
&gt; night with the image of my fourteen year old daughter weeping
&gt; beside my grave. Now off you go back to your cat stories.

Before anyone comments on my spelling, allow me to say that &quot;sereved&quot;
(in the final line quoted below) is not the American spelling of
&quot;served&quot;; it is the error of a harried typist who is trying to type
around, over and under his cat.

(I really shouldn't blame Gideon, even though he does love to &quot;help&quot;
me at the computer. I'm sure I would make my fair share of typos even
if he weren't constantly trying to lay on the keyboard. But he's a
convenient excuse.)

For several days, I've been reading all these messages about Ugly's story.
True or not, there must be something strong in that story, to arouse such
interest. A story that makes somebody think about his acts is a good story.

On this now completely off-topic thread, I would like to add some stories,
true or not, that move people:

The Incredible Journey, The Ten Commandments, The King and I, David and
Goliath, Brian's Song, Free Willy, The Champ, Ghost,Bambi,The Lion King

The list is endless. I think stories that move people, true or not, are
good for the soul. I think a good cry now and then is healthy. I think a
fictitious story with a moral point makes us think. Some stories make us
appreciate our own lives more... some make us appreciate others more. A
friend of mine was talking about never speaking to her mother again.... I
sent her a copy of the story of Ugly. I didn't send it for its truth, but
for it's meanings.... the ones that poor Jon could not see. My friend also
saw it for what it meant to her.

I apologize for my dig at men when Jon first emptied his catbox on the
readers here. I did a little research and found that there are no inspiring
or moving stories out of Jon's home town. I guess that can make you hard,
rude, and cynical.

I guess his hometown is very closed and shut off from the rest of the world.
I guess that can make you racist against Americans. [where jon is from is
irrelevant to this ng really... except to point out that he is not American
and neither am I... but that we are not all like this about Americans]

I'm not American but know many Americans, and I know many of Jon's
&quot;ethnicity&quot; too. I find there are good and bad in both... in all really.
I am sorry Jon does not know that. He should get out and meet people from
different countries more.

I am saddened that he finds American spelling so offensive. We should never
sweat the small stuff in this life. It is not worth the ulcers. I can't
imagine myself getting all upset and hot under the collar about an American
variation on spelling. Since all Americans had to come from elsewhere (with
the exception of a small handful of natives left), I suspect Jon even gets
ulcers over his own American cousins.

Here is my thought for anyone still reading after my long-winded babbling:
there are things in this life not worth getting upset over. This includes
ethnic spellings, other people's countries and ways of life, and the fact
that humans of all types (not just American women), are moved by the
meanings they pull out of stories, true or not. Mr. Spock from Star Trek
was fictitious. I do not aspire to be like him.

Oh and one last thing. Don't let him get to you. This is just a ng. There
will always be flamers and flames over one point or another. There will
always be people who hate you for where you are from. There will always be
people who call you names and sling insults at you for things as small as
the way you spell things. On this ng, we are all here because of our common
interest in and probably love for cats. Anything else is off-topic and
unnecessary. We can read them, discard them, or comment on them. There are
many cat-related topics that will inflame, sadden or inspire us. The beauty
of an unmoderated ng is that we can take what we want and leave the rest...
much like the American buffet. hehe

Hugs to all.
Hugs to you too, Jon. I am pretty sure you would not approve of an
imaginary hug from another country, but I hope that you could try to accept
it for its meaning.

You go, Donna! Yes, cancer is a devastating thing. I've been through it too
(passed the 5-year window several years ago, woo-hoo!). But I don't use it
or my quadaplegia or any other disease as an EXCUSE (which is exactly how it
was proffered, because you didn't, in your first post, state any of your
afflictions. You only did so when your orig. post about us &quot;American
women&quot; -- and I am not going to sink to your level by assuming that all
British (Canadian, Kiwi, Aussie, or whatever nationality you claim, I'm
merely going on your spellings) men or male quadraplegics or what have
you -- act as insensitively as you do -- was attacked, presumbably by an
irritated American woman.

Leave nationality out of your attacks. Lord knows there will be plenty left
over for you to sharpen your incisors on.

But regarding your quadraplegia, I have a couple of questions for you and I
would appreciate, out of courtesy, an answer. And not a smart-alecky one
either.

1. If you are quadraplegic, I am curious what you use to type? What kind
of special equipment is set up?

2. If you have a fourteen year old daughter, instead of lurking on these
newsgroups and running down the (in your words) gullible American women who
post here, why don't you spend a little more quality time with her.
According to your post, you make it sound as if you don't have that much of
it left.

And finally, I'll get off my soapbox here in a minute and turn it over to
someone else:

As far as the cat story goes, I thought enough of it and what it says (to me
anyway) to put it up on my cats' web site. Of course, the internet as a
whole, being a public forum and all, and not subject to regulation or
censorship (thank God!) is there for us all and we can choose to ignore what
we don't like or don't understand or that which offends us, or we can
exchange ideas with others and be challenged (like we are challenging you on
your beliefs and stances right now, Jon), informed, entertained and
sometimes disgusted, offended or annoyed. And all this for the price of
your monthly internet connection. It just doesn't get any better than that,
does it?

&gt; But that is the whole point. There is a need to identify the crap and

&gt; the one who deserve our sympathy and help.

"/> Dear Mr Jon Rose

I am an American woman, and as I recall, the name of this news group is
alt.animals.cat, in other words, anything to do about cats is
acceptable to post here. I do not appreciate being insulted by some
one who does not even know me, much less be told what I can, or cannot
post/read in this news group. I enjoy reading about people's cats, I
benefit from their experiences and I have learned alot from what I have
read in this ng. If you do not like what is being posted here, then by
all means, why don't you just quit reading this ng. If you are only
interested about cat health and problems, may I suggest you hop on over
to alt.animals.feline.deceases, you will not be troubled by &quot;sappy&quot;
stories and &quot;gullible&quot; American women.

One of the benefits of being American is that I am free to speak and
read what ever I damn please, and to have my own opinion, as long as I
respect other's, and am willing to give everybody a chance to speak out
and say what they want, and that includes you. So please, refrain from
making any more insulting statements about people you don't even know.
It would be easy for me to do the same, but I know that what you say is
just your opinion, and so I will not call you any names or make any
judgements on your character.

Thank you.

Sandra and the furries.

&gt;:/L'Affreux
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Chacun, dans l'ensemble résidentiel où j'habite, connaissait Affreux. C'était
&gt;:/le matou de l'immeuble.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Affreux aimait trois choses dans ce bas monde : se battre, se nourrir de
&gt;:/détritus, et, si onpeut dire
&gt;:/ainsi, aimer.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/La combinaison de ces trois activités, et d'une vie passée dehors, avait
&gt;:/marqué Affreux. Pour
&gt;:/commencer, il ne possédait plus qu'un œil; là où l'autre aurait dû se
&gt;:/trouver, il n'y avait plus qu'un trou
&gt;:/béant.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Du même coté, il lui manquait aussi une oreille. Sa patte gauche semblait
&gt;:/avoir été méchamment
&gt;:/cassée, et s'était remise avec un angle curieux, lui donnant toujours
&gt;:/l'allure de tourner un coin.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/De sa queue, perdue il y a bien longtemps, ne subsistait qu'un moignon qu'il
&gt;:/agitait constamment de
&gt;:/façon saccadée.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Affreux aurait pu ressembler à un chat-tigré gris sombre, si ce n'étaient les
&gt;:/plaies couvrant sa tête, son
&gt;:/cou et ses épaules d'épaisses croûtes jaunes.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Chaque fois que quelqu'un apercevait Affreux, il avait la même réaction:
&gt;:/&quot;Quel AFFREUX chat !!&quot;.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/On interdisait aux enfants d'y toucher; les adultes lui jetaient des pierres,
&gt;:/l'arrosaient au jet d'eau,
&gt;:/l'éjectaient de chez eux quand il essayait d'y entrer, ou lui coinçaient les
&gt;:/pattes dans la porte quand il
&gt;:/ne voulait pas sortir.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Affreux avait toujours la même réaction. Si vous dirigiez un tuyau d'arrosage
&gt;:/vers lui, il restait là,
&gt;:/immobile, se laissant tremper, jusqu'à ce que vous laissiez tomber et
&gt;:/quittiez le terrain. Si vous lui
&gt;:/lanciez des choses, il enroulait son corps maigre autour de vos pieds, en
&gt;:/signe de pardon. Quand il
&gt;:/observait les enfants, il accourrait vers eux, miaulant frénétiquement, et
&gt;:/poussait sa tête sur leurs
&gt;:/mains, mendiant leur amitié. S'il était jamais pris dans les bras, il
&gt;:/commençait immédiatement à téter
&gt;:/votre chemise, vos boucles d'oreilles, tout ce qu'il pouvait atteindre.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Un jour Affreux offrit de partager son amour aux chiens esquimaud du voisin.
&gt;:/Ils ne lui répondirent pas
&gt;:/gentiment, et Affreux fut gravement malmené. De mon appartement je pouvais
&gt;:/entendre ses cris, et
&gt;:/j'essayais de me précipiter à son secours. Le temps que j'arrive à ses côtés,
&gt;:/il gisait sur le flanc. De
&gt;:/toute évidence, la triste vie d'Affreux touchait presque à sa fin. Affreux
&gt;:/reposait dans une marre
&gt;:/humide, les pattes arrières et les reins fortement tordus, la marque de
&gt;:/fourrure blanche de son front
&gt;:/trouée d'une blessure béante.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Alors que je le ramassais et tentais de le ramener à la maison, je pouvais
&gt;:/entendre sa respiration
&gt;:/sifflante et haletante, et je le sentais se débattre. Je pense que je devais
&gt;:/lui faire horriblement mal.
&gt;:/Soudain, je sentis sur mon oreille une sensation familière de succion.
&gt;:/Affreux, au milieux de toutes ses
&gt;:/souffrances, de toute évidence en train de mourir,, essayait de me lécher
&gt;:/l'oreille? Je le rapprochais
&gt;:/de moi, et il poussa sa tête contre la paume de ma main, puis il me regarda
&gt;:/de son unique œil doré, et
&gt;:/je pus distinctement l'entendre ronronner. Même au milieu des plus grandes
&gt;:/douleurs, cet affreux chat
&gt;:/battu et terrorisé ne demandait qu'un peu d'affection, qu'un peu de
&gt;:/compassion peut-être.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/A cet instant, je pensai qu'Affreux était la plus belle et aimante créature
&gt;:/que j'ai jamais rencontré. Pas
&gt;:/une seule fois il avait essayé de me mordre, de me griffer, ou même de se
&gt;:/dégager de moi ou de se
&gt;:/débattre de quelque façon que ce soit.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Affreux me regardait, tout simplement, me faisant pleine confiance pour
&gt;:/soulager sa douleur.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Affreux mourut dans mes bras avant que j'ai pu rentrer chez moi, mais, je
&gt;:/m'assis et le gardais
&gt;:/longtemps dans les bras, méditant sur le fait qu'un pauvre animal effrayé et
&gt;:/déformé pouvait infléchir
&gt;:/mes idées sur ce que signifiait la possession d'une vraie pureté de l'âme, la
&gt;:/démonstration d'un amour
&gt;:/aussi vrai et absolu.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Affreux m'en a appris plus sur le don de soi et la compassion q'un millier de
&gt;:/livres, de lectures ou de
&gt;:/conférences spécialisées ne pourraient jamais le faire, et de cela, je serais
&gt;:/à jamais reconnaissant.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Il avait eu peur de son environnement, mais j'avais peur de l'intérieur, et
&gt;:/il était temps pour moi de
&gt;:/changer et d'apprendre à aimer vraiment et profondément. De me donner à fond
&gt;:/à ceux que j'aimais.
&gt;:/
&gt;:/Bien des gens veulent être plus riches, mieux réussir, être plus aimés, plus
&gt;:/beaux, mais, quant à moi,
&gt;:/j'essaierais toujours de ressembler à Affreux.
&gt;:/

I think that is why it is so sad to me - that it CAN be anyone or anything. I
adopted 8 special needs children, all of whom had been abused in one form or
another - often in several. It's easy to adopt a baby (just like kittens &amp;
puppies are easy to find homes for), but when kids get older, it's not that
easy.

As you said, Ugly makes me think of all those unloved and unwanted people and
animals, and how we should look beyond the obvious.

I am not American. I am not female. I most certainly am not gullible. I
still read the story and cried like a child.

Jon, I'm sure we're all glad your gone.

Salomeh, thanks for the post.
