&quot;THE LOST TOMB OF JESUS&quot;: THE TALMUD MAKES ITS WAY TO THE DISCOVERY
CHANNEL

by Michael A. Hoffman II | Feb. 27, 2007
http://www.revisionisthistory.org/page1/news.html

The Discovery Channel's documentary, &quot;The Lost Tomb of Jesus,&quot; is the
latest predictable bigotry from the usual suspects. Though Hollywood
director James Cameron is the visible spokesman, according to the New
York Times, Simcha Jacobovici, an Israeli, is &quot;the documentary's
director and its driving force.&quot; For obvious reasons the media are not
emphasizing that fact.

Zionist reporter Laurie Goodstein, writing in the Feb. 27 edition of the
New York Times, treats the alleged discovery of the &quot;grave of Jesus&quot; as
worthy of serious contemplation, while regarding any Christian outrage
as  slightly comical: &quot;It's going to get a lot of Christians with their
knickers in a knot unnecessarily.&quot;

No such laisssez-faire insouciance from the Laurie Goodsteins of the
world greeted Prof. Ariel Toaff of Bar-Ilan University earlier this
month, when he asserted in his Italian-language book, &quot;Pasque di Sangue&quot;
(Bloody Passovers) that medieval and Renaissance Judaic ritual murder of
Christian children was in some cases factual. The Zionist media and the
ADL had more than their knickers in a knot over Toaff. They responded
with one mighty voice of howling wrath: this was fantasy, not history;
anti-semitic racism from a self-hating Judiac opposed by every historian
on earth and despised by every right-thinking human on the planet.
Serious contemplation of a new discovery? Fuggetaboutit!

To learn the extent to which Judaic supremacy is triumphant in our time,
all one has to do is compare the treatment accorded to each of these
'discoveries.' The Jacobovici/Cameron hoax is presented by the media as
a thoughtful alternative to uptight fundamentalist orthodoxy. Pros and
cons are debated in an atmosphere of civility and reason. Criticism is
entertained, mainly in order to appear balanced amid ample shades of
gray. But any vehement, sustained outrage against the claim that Jesus
Christ's tomb has been found, with the suggestion that he was buried
next to his sex partner, Mary Magdalene, is scornfully dismissed as
nutjob religious fanaticism.

In the disparity between the treatment of the two controversies, we find
the strength of Judaism and the anemia of a Christianity which, in
American society, is little more than Churchianity, in spite of the fact
that the President of the United States is alleged to be a &quot;devout
Christian,&quot; along with a sizable portion of his Republican party, who
will no doubt blow off ineffectual steam over &quot;The Lost Tomb of Jesus,&quot;
just as they did with &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; even as the producers' cash
registers ring a merry tune. After all, Martin Scorcese, the director of
&quot;The Last Tempation of Christ,&quot; a movie that portrayed Jesus as a
demented sex freak and coward, has just won the Academy Award.

Far from being courageous heretics, Jacobovici and Cameron are
conformist front men for the dictates of dogmatic Orthodox Judaism, just
as Dan Brown and Hollywood director Ron Howard with their &quot;Da Vinci
Code&quot; book and movie vomit, were fronting for the Kabbalistic gnosis of
the western secret societies.

The Establishment will deflate the impact of the Israeli origins of this
grotesque insult to Christ by trotting out a few Orthodox rabbis who
will say they side with Christians against it. These &quot;good rabbis&quot; are
part of the charade, necessary to successfully deflect attention away
from the Talmudic nature of the production. How many of the handful of
supposed &quot;Orthodox Judaics of good will&quot; will come forward to condemn
the film as having been inspired by traditional Judaic teachings about
Jesus? Rather, they will indict the &quot;The Lost Tomb of Jesus&quot; as a
&quot;liberal&quot; rather than a Talmudic evil.

This writer would be more than happy to have Jerry Falwell, Franklin
Graham and John Hagee condemn an English translation of Ariel Toaff's
&quot;Pasque di Sangue&quot; even as it was published from coast to coast. Their
condemnation wouldn't faze me in the least; neither will any
window-dressing theatrics from those token &quot;good Orthodox rabbis&quot;
detract one iota from the success of &quot;The Lost Tomb of Jesus&quot; and the
fact that the hidden hand of rotten rabbinic tradition is all over this
degenerate project.

In the run-up to the publication of his book, Prof. Toaff started out
defiant: &quot;The author of a book on the use of blood by Jews in Ashkenazi
communities in the Middle Ages said... in the face of the furor its
publication aroused, 'I will not give up my devotion to the truth and
academic freedom even if the world crucifies me.&quot; Within a week of Toaff
announcing the book's publication, he did just that, under threat of
expulsion from his university, arrest by Israeli authorities and
credible death threats.

While the infantilized goyim are told it would be racist &quot;anti-Semitism&quot;
for us to give Toaff's thesis a hearing, to defend him or demand that
his book go forward, it is noble, adventurous and truly adult of us to
give thoughtful consideration to Jacobovici and Cameron's &quot;Lost Tomb of
Jesus.&quot;

If America were really a &quot;Christian country&quot; the sponsors of this
subversive, antichrist filth would face fiscal bankruptcy from an
iron-clad Christian boycott of the cable TV network associated with the
film, and every corporate sponsor connected with it; and moral
bankruptcy due to near-universal revulsion and social ostracism. But
nothing like that happened to the influential Ron Howard, the
fantastically wealthy Dan Brown or Academy Award winner Scorcese. Surely
Jacobovici and Cameron are emboldened by the fact that America is the
place to score against Christ while stuffing one's pockets with cash.

Jesus Christ, the New Adam, never suffered physical disintegration on
earth. That was God's curse on the old Adam. But the Talmud, Kabbalah
and Toledot Yeshu have always accused Jesus of being a a con-man and
sorcerer who learned his magician's trade in Egypt, and who is even now
being cooked in hell in his own feces. From hell, the Talmud has Jesus
advising we the living to obey the Judaic authorities in all things.

In our misdirection and paralysis, it appears Americans are dutiful
followers of that hell-bound, faux Talmudic &quot;Jesus.&quot; After all, lots of
money (perish the thought, says Cameron) is going to be made off the
Tomb of Jesus scam, and when did any red-blooded, rabbi-fearing American
ever interfere with a guy's ability to make a buck? It's the American
way!

The truth is, Jesus Christ rose from the dead and ascended into heaven
and sits at the right hand of the Father, from whence He shall come
again to judge the living and the dead, and of His kingdom there will be
no end.

Are you listening, proud, arrogant, profit-loving &quot;Christian America,&quot;
facilitators of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and now &quot;The Lost Tomb of Jesus&quot;?
Are you listening Hollywood? Are you listening, all of you who make
common cause with Talmudic rabbis and Israeli Zionists? His day, the Day
of Judgment by the Jesus you allow Hollywood to say lies moldering in
dust for the TV cameras to ogle and the DNA ghouls to sample, is coming,
and when it does, all those who tolerated or -- God forbid -- promoted
this diabolical charade, will have their fateful appointment with
eternity.

In the meantime, a kind of ritual murder of the reputation of Jesus
Christ is unfolding before our very eyes, scandalizing millions,
including our children. It's legal. It's profitable, its Talmudic, and
it's all happening right here in &quot;Christian&quot; America, light unto the
nations and bosom buddy of God's Chosen People, of whom Simcha
Jacobovici is a sterling example.

A Documented Exposé of Supremacist Rabbinic Hate Literature

By Warrant of John 18:37, Galatians 4:16

Introduction

The Talmud is Judaism's holiest book (actually a collection of books). Its authority
takes precedence over the Old Testament in Judaism. Evidence of this may be found in the
Talmud itself, Erubin 21b (Soncino edition): &quot;My son, be more careful in the observance
of the words of the Scribes than in the words of the Torah (Old Testament).&quot;

The supremacy of the Talmud over the Bible in the Israeli state may also be seen in the
case of the black Ethiopian Jews. Ethiopians are very knowledgeable of the Old
Testament. However, their religion is so ancient it pre-dates the Scribes' Talmud, of
which the Ethiopians have no knowledge. According to the N.Y. Times of Sept. 29, 1992,
p.4:

&quot;The problem is that Ethiopian Jewish tradition goes no further than the Bible or Torah;
the later Talmud and other commentaries that form the basis of modern traditions never
came their way.&quot;

Because they are not traffickers in Talmudic tradition, the black Ethiopian Jews are
discriminated against and have been forbidden by the Zionists to perform marriages,
funerals and other services in the Israeli state.

Rabbi Joseph D. Soloveitchik is regarded as one of the most influential rabbis of the
20th century, the &quot;unchallenged leader&quot; of Orthodox Judaism and the top international
authority on halakha (Jewish religious law). Soloveitchik was responsible for
instructing and ordaining more than 2,000 rabbis, &quot;an entire generation&quot; of Jewish
leadership.

N.Y. Times religion reporter Ari Goldman described the basis of the rabbi's authority:

&quot;Soloveitchik came from a long line of distinguished Talmudic scholars...Until his early
20s, he devoted himself almost exclusively to the study of the Talmud...He came to
Yeshiva University's Elchanan Theological Seminary where he remained the pre-eminent
teacher in the Talmud...He held the title of Leib Merkin professor of Talmud...sitting
with his feet crossed in front of a table bearing an open volume of the Talmud.&quot; (N.Y.
Times, April 10, 1993, p. 38).

Nowhere does Goldman refer to Soloveitchik's knowledge of the Bible as the basis for
being one of the leading authorities on Jewish law.

The rabbi's credentials are all predicated upon his mastery of the Talmud. Other studies
are clearly secondary. Britain's Jewish Chronicle of March 26, 1993 states that in
religious school (yeshiva), Jews are &quot;devoted to the Talmud to the exclusion of
everything else.&quot;

The Talmud Nullifies the Bible

The Jewish Scribes claim the Talmud is partly a collection of traditions Moses gave them
in oral form. These had not yet been written down in Jesus' time. Christ condemned the
traditions of the Mishnah (early Talmud) and those who taught it (Scribes and
Pharisees), because the Talmud nullifies the teachings of the Holy Bible.

Shmuel Safrai in The Literature of the Sages Part One (p.164), points out that in
chapters 4 and 5 of the Talmud's Gittin Tractate, the Talmud nullifies the Biblical
teaching concerning money-lending: &quot;Hillel decreed the prozbul for the betterment of the
world. The prozbul is a legal fiction which allows debts to be collected after the
Sabbatical year and it was Hillel's intention thereby to overcome the fear that
money-lenders had of losing their money.&quot;

The famous warning of Jesus Christ about the tradition of men that voids Scripture (Mark
7:1-13), is in fact, a direct reference to the Talmud, or more specifically, the
forerunner of the first part of it, the Mishnah, which existed in oral form during
Christ's lifetime, before being committed to writing. Mark chapter 7, from verse one
through thirteen, represents Our Lord's pointed condemnation of the Mishnah.

Unfortunately, due to the abysmal ignorance of our day, the widespread &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot;
notion is that the Old Testament is the supreme book of Judaism. But this is not so. The
Pharisees teach for doctrine the commandments of rabbis, not God.

The Talmudic commentary on the Bible is their supreme law, and not the Bible itself.
That commentary does indeed, as Jesus said, void the laws of God, not uphold them. As
students of the Talmud, we know this to be true.

Jewish scholar Hyam Maccoby, in Judaism on Trial, quotes Rabbi Yehiel ben Joseph:
&quot;Further, without the Talmud, we would not be able to understand passages in the
Bible...God has handed this authority to the sages and tradition is a necessity as well
as scripture. The Sages also made enactments of their own...anyone who does not study
the Talmud cannot understand Scripture.&quot;

There is a tiny Jewish sect which makes considerable effort to eschew Talmud and adhere
to the Old Testament alone. These are the Karaites, a group which, historically, has
been most hated and severely persecuted by orthodox Jewish rabbinate.

To the Mishnah the rabbis later added the Gemara (rabbinical commentaries). Together
these comprise the Talmud. There are two versions, the Jerusalem Talmud and the
Babylonian Talmud.

The Babylonian Talmud is regarded as the authoritative version: &quot;The authority of the
Babylonian Talmud is also greater than that of the Jerusalem Talmud. In cases of doubt
the former is decisive.&quot; (R.C. Musaph-Andriesse, From Torah to Kabbalah: A Basic
Introduction to the Writings of Judaism, p. 40).

This study is based on the Jewish-authorized Babylonian Talmud. We have published herein
the authenticated sayings of the Jewish Talmud. Look them up for yourself.

We publish the following irrefutable documentation in the hope of liberating all people,
including Jewish people, from the corrosive delusions and racism of this Talmudic hate
literature, which is the manual of Orthodox and Hasidic Jews the world over.

The implementation by Jewish supremacists of Talmudic hate literature has caused untold
suffering throughout history and now, in occupied Palestine, it is used as a
justification for the mass murder of Palestinian civilians. The Talmud specifically
defines all who are not Jews as non-human animals.

Some Teachings of the Jewish Talmud

Where a Jew Should Do Evil

Moed Kattan 17a: If a Jew is tempted to do evil he should go to a city where he is not
known and do the evil there.

Penalty for Disobeying Rabbis

Erubin 21b. Whosoever disobeys the rabbis deserves death and will be punished by being
boiled in hot excrement in hell.

Hitting a Jew is the same as hitting God

Sanhedrin 58b. If a heathen (gentile) hits a Jew, the gentile must be killed.

O.K. to Cheat Non-Jews

Sanhedrin 57a . A Jew need not pay a gentile (&quot;Cuthean&quot;) the wages owed him for work.

Jews Have Superior Legal Status

Baba Kamma 37b. &quot;If an ox of an Israelite gores an ox of a Canaanite there is no
liability; but if an ox of a Canaanite gores an ox of an Israelite...the payment is to
be in full.&quot;

Jews May Steal from Non-Jews

Baba Mezia 24a . If a Jew finds an object lost by a gentile (&quot;heathen&quot;) it does not have
to be returned. (Affirmed also in Baba Kamma 113b). Sanhedrin 76a. God will not spare a
Jew who &quot;marries his daughter to an old man or takes a wife for his infant son or
returns a lost article to a Cuthean...&quot;

Jews May Rob and Kill Non-Jews

Sanhedrin 57a . When a Jew murders a gentile (&quot;Cuthean&quot;), there will be no death
penalty. What a Jew steals from a gentile he may keep.

Baba Kamma 37b. The gentiles are outside the protection of the law and God has &quot;exposed
their money to Israel.&quot;

Jews May Lie to Non-Jews

Baba Kamma 113a. Jews may use lies (&quot;subterfuges&quot;) to circumvent a Gentile.

Non-Jewish Children are Sub-Human

Yebamoth 98a. All gentile children are animals.

Abodah Zarah 36b. Gentile girls are in a state of niddah (filth) from birth.

Abodah Zarah 22a-22b . Gentiles prefer sex with cows.

Insults Against Blessed Mary

Sanhedrin 106a . Says Jesus' mother was a whore: &quot;She who was the descendant of princes
and governors played the harlot with carpenters.&quot; Also in footnote #2 to Shabbath 104b
of the Soncino edition, it is stated that in the &quot;uncensored&quot; text of the Talmud it is
written that Jesus mother, &quot;Miriam the hairdresser,&quot; had sex with many men.

Gloats over Christ Dying Young

A passage from Sanhedrin 106 gloats over the early age at which Jesus died: &quot;Hast thou
heard how old Balaam (Jesus) was?--He replied: It is not actually stated but since it is
written, Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days it follows that he
was thirty-three or thirty-four years old.&quot;

Jesus in the Talmud:

Horrible Blasphemies Against Jesus Christ

While it is the standard disinformation practice of apologists for the Talmud to deny
that it contains any scurrilous references to Jesus Christ, certain Orthodox Jewish
organizations are more forthcoming and admit that the Talmud not only mentions Jesus but
disparages him (as a sorcerer and a demented sex freak). These orthodox Jewish
organizations make this admission perhaps out of the belief that Jewish supremacy is so
well-established in the modern world that they need not concern themselves with adverse
reactions.

For example, on the website of the Orthodox Jewish Hasidic Lubavitch group--one of the
largest in the world--we find the following statement, complete with Talmudic citations:

&quot;The Talmud (Babylonian edition) records other sins of 'Jesus the Nazarene':

1) He and his disciples practiced sorcery and black magic, led Jews astray into
idolatry, and were sponsored by foreign, gentile powers for the purpose of subverting
Jewish worship (Sanhedrin 43a).

2) He was sexually immoral, worshipped statues of stone (a brick is mentioned), was cut
off from the Jewish people for his wickedness, and refused to repent (Sanhedrin 107b;
Sotah 47a).

3) He learned witchcraft in Egypt and, to perform miracles, used procedures that
involved cutting his flesh, which is also explicitly banned in the Bible (Shabbos 104b).

End quote from http://www.noahide.com/yeshu.htm (Lubavitch website
&lt; http://www.noahide.com/yeshu.htm &gt; ) June 20, 2000.

[Note: we have printed and preserved in our files a hard copy of this statement from the
Lubavitch&quot;Noah's Covenant Website,&quot; as it appeared on their website at
http://www.noahide.com on June 20, 2000, in the event that denials are later issued and
the statement itself suppressed].

Let us examine further some of these anti-Christ Talmud passages:

Gittin 57a. Says Jesus is in hell, being boiled in &quot;hot excrement.&quot;

Sanhedrin 43a. Says Jesus (&quot;Yeshu&quot; and in Soncino footnote #6, Yeshu &quot;the Nazarene&quot;) was
executed because he practiced sorcery: &quot;It is taught that on the eve of Passover Jesus
was hung, and forty days before this the proclamation was made: Jesus is to be stoned to
death because he has practiced sorcery and has lured the people to idolatry...He was an
enticer and of such thou shalt not pity or condone.&quot;

Kallah 51a.&quot;The elders were once sitting in the gate when two young lads passed by; one
covered his head and the other uncovered his head. Of him who uncovered his head Rabbi
Eliezer remarked that he is a bastard. Rabbi Joshua remarked that he is the son of a
niddah (a child conceived during a woman's menstrual period). Rabbi Akiba said that he
is both a bastard and a son of a niddah.

&quot;They said, 'What induced you to contradict the opinion of your colleagues?' He replied,
&quot;I will prove it concerning him.&quot; He went to the lad's mother and found her sitting in
the market selling beans.

&quot;He said to her, 'My daughter, if you will answer the question I will put to you, I will
bring you to the world to come.' (eternal life). She said to him, 'Swear it to me.'

&quot;Rabbi Akiba, taking the oath with his lips but annulling it in his heart, said to her,
'What is the status of your son?' She replied, 'When I entered the bridal chamber I was
niddah (menstruating) and my husband kept away from me; but my best man had intercourse
with me and this son was born to me.' Consequently the child was both a bastard and the
son of a niddah.

&quot;It was declared, '..Blessed be the God of Israel Who Revealed His Secret to Rabbi
Akiba...&quot;

In addition to the theme that God rewards clever liars, the preceding Talmud discussion
is actually about Jesus Christ (the bastard boy who &quot;uncovered his head&quot; and was
conceived in the filth of menstruation). The boy's adulterous mother in this Talmud
story is the mother of Christ, Blessed Mary (called Miriam and sometimes, Miriam the
hairdresser, in the Talmud).

&quot;The Editio Princeps of the complete Code of Talmudic Law, Maimonides' Mishneh Torah --
replete not only with the most offensive precepts against all Gentiles but also with
explicit attacks on Christianity and on Jesus (after whose name the author adds piously,
'May the name of the wicked perish')... --Dr. Israel Shahak, Jewish History, Jewish
Religion, p. 21.

&quot;The Talmud contains a few explicit references to Jesus...These references are certainly
not complimentary...There seems little doubt that the account of the execution of Jesus
on the eve of Passover does refer to the Christian Jesus...The passage in which Jesus'
punishment in hell is described also seems to refer to the Christian Jesus. It is a
piece of anti-Christian polemic dating from the post-70 CE period...&quot; --Hyam Maccoby,
Judaism on Trial, pp. 26-27.

&quot;According to the Talmud, Jesus was executed by a proper rabbinical court for idolatry,
inciting other Jews to idolatry, and contempt of rabbinical authority. All classical
Jewish sources which mention his execution are quite happy to take responsibility for
it; in the talmudic account the Romans are not even mentioned.

&quot;The more popular accounts--which were nevertheless taken quite seriously--such as the
notorious Toldot Yeshu are even worse, for in addition to the above crimes they accuse
him of witchcraft. The very name 'Jesus' was for Jews a symbol of all that is abominable
and this popular tradition still persists...

&quot;The Hebrew form of the name Jesus--Yeshu--was interpreted as an acronym for the curse,
'may his name and memory be wiped out,' which is used as an extreme form of abuse. In
fact, anti-zionist Orthodox Jews (such as Neturey Qarta) sometimes refer to Herzl as
'Herzl Jesus' and I have found in religious zionist writings expressions such as &quot;Nasser
Jesus&quot; and more recently 'Arafat Jesus.&quot; --Dr. Israel Shahak, Jewish History, Jewish
Religion, pp. 97- 98, 118.

Talmud Attacks Christians and Christian Books

Rosh Hashanah 17a. Christians (minnim) and others who reject the Talmud will go to hell
and be punished there for all generations.

Sanhedrin 90a. Those who read the New Testament (&quot;uncanonical books&quot;) will have no
portion in the world to come.

Shabbath 116a. Jews must destroy the books of the Christians, i.e. the New Testament.

Dr. Israel Shahak of Hebrew University reports that the Israelis burned hundreds of New
Testament Bibles in occupied Palestine on March 23, 1980 (cf. Jewish History, Jewish
Religion, p. 21).

Sick and Insane Teachings of the Talmud

Gittin 69a . To heal his flesh a Jew should take dust that lies within the shadow of an
outdoor toilet, mix with honey and eat it.

Shabbath 41a. The law regulating the rule for how to urinate in a holy way is given.

Yebamoth 63a. States that Adam had sexual intercourse with all the animals in the Garden
of Eden.

Yebamoth 63a. Declares that agriculture is the lowest of occupations.

Sanhedrin 55b. A Jew may marry a three year old girl (specifically, three years &quot;and a
day&quot; old).

Sanhedrin 54b. A Jew may have sex with a child as long as the child is less than nine
years old.

Kethuboth 11b. &quot;When a grown-up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing.&quot;

Yebamoth 59b. A woman who had intercourse with a beast is eligible to marry a Jewish
priest. A woman who has sex with a demon is also eligible to marry a Jewish priest.

Abodah Zarah 17a. States that there is not a whore in the world that the Talmudic sage
Rabbi Eleazar has not had sex with. On one of his whorehouse romps, Rabbi Eleazar
leanred that there was one particular prostitute residing in a whorehouse near the sea,
who would receive a bag of money for her services. He took a bag of money and went to
her, crossing seven rivers to do so. During their intercourse the prostitute farted.
After this the whore told Rabbi Eleazar: &quot;Just as this gas will never return to my anus,
Rabbi Eleazar will never get to heaven.&quot;

Hagigah 27a. States that no rabbi can ever go to hell.

Baba Mezia 59b. A rabbi debates God and defeats Him. God admits the rabbi won the
debate.

Gittin 70a. The Rabbis taught: &quot;On coming from a privy (outdoor toilet) a man should not
have sexual intercourse till he has waited long enough to walk half a mile, because the
demon of the privy is with him for that time; if he does, his children will be
epileptic.&quot;

Gittin 69b. To heal the disease of pleurisy (&quot;catarrh&quot;) a Jew should &quot;take the excrement
of a white dog and knead it with balsam, but if he can possibly avoid it he should not
eat the dog's excrement as it loosens the limbs.&quot;

Pesahim 111a. It is forbidden for dogs, women or palm trees to pass between two men, nor
may others walk between dogs, women or palm trees. Special dangers are involved if the
women are menstruating or sitting at a crossroads.

Menahoth 43b-44a. A Jewish man is obligated to say the following prayer every day: Thank
you God for not making me a gentile, a woman or a slave.

Tall Tales of a Roman Holocaust

Here are two early &quot;Holocaust&quot; tales from the Talmud: Gittin 57b. Claims that four
billion Jews were killed by the Romans in the city of Bethar. Gittin 58a claims that 16
million Jewish children were wrapped in scrolls and burned alive by the Romans. (Ancient
demography indicates that there were not 16 million Jews in the entire world at that
time, much less 16 million Jewish children or four billion Jews).

A Revealing Admission

Abodah Zarah 70a. The question was asked of the rabbi whether wine stolen in Pumbeditha
might be used or if it was defiled, due to the fact that the thieves might have been
gentiles (a gentile touching wine would make the wine unclean). The rabbi says not to
worry, that the wine is permissible for Jewish use because the majority of the thieves
in Pumbeditha, the place where the wine was stolen, are Jews. (Also cf. Gemara Rosh
Hashanah 25b).

Pharisaic Rituals

Erubin 21b. &quot;Rabbi Akiba said to him, &quot;Give me some water to wash my hands.&quot;

&quot;It will not suffice for drinking,&quot; the other complained, &quot;will it suffice for washing
your hands?&quot;

&quot;What can I do?' the former replied, &quot;when for neglecting the words of the Rabbis one
deserves death? It is better that I myself should die than that I transgress against the
opinion of my colleagues.&quot; [This is the ritual hand washing condemned by Jesus in
Matthew 15: 1-9].

Genocide Advocated by the Talmud

Minor Tractates. Soferim 15, Rule 10. This is the saying of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai: Tob
shebe goyyim harog (&quot;Even the best of the gentiles should all be killed&quot;).

This passage is from the original Hebrew of the Babylonian Talmud as quoted by the 1907
Jewish Encyclopedia, published by Funk and Wagnalls and compiled by Isidore Singer,
under the entry, &quot;Gentile,&quot; (p. 617).

This original Talmud passage has been concealed in translation. The Jewish Encyclopedia
states that, &quot;...in the various versions the reading has been altered, 'The best among
the Egyptians' being generally substituted.&quot; In the Soncino version: &quot;the best of the
heathens&quot; (Minor Tractates, Soferim 41a-b].

Israelis annually take part in a national pilgrimage to the grave of Simon ben Yohai, to
honor this rabbi who advocated the extermination of non-Jews. (Jewish Press, June 9,
1989, p. 56B).

On Purim, Feb. 25, 1994, Israeli army officer Baruch Goldstein, an orthodox Jew from
Brooklyn, massacred 40 Palestinian civilians, including children, while they knelt in
prayer in a mosque. Goldstein was a disciple of the late Brooklyn Rabbi Meir Kahane, who
told CBS News that his teaching that Arabs are &quot;dogs&quot; is derived &quot;from the Talmud.&quot; (CBS
60 Minutes, &quot;Kahane&quot;).

University of Jerusalem Prof. Ehud Sprinzak described Kahane and Goldstein's philosophy:
&quot;They believe it's God's will that they commit violence against goyim, a Hebrew term for
non-Jews.&quot; (NY Daily News, Feb. 26, 1994, p. 5).

Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburg declared, &quot;We have to recognize that Jewish blood and the blood
of a goy are not the same thing.&quot; (NY Times, June 6, 1989, p.5).

Rabbi Yaacov Perrin said, &quot;One million Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail.&quot; (NY
Daily News, Feb. 28, 1994, p.6).

Talmudic Doctrine: Non-Jews are not Human

The Talmud specifically defines all who are not Jews as non-human animals, and
specifically dehumanizes Gentiles as not being descendants of Adam. Here are some of the
Talmud passages which relate to this topic.

Kerithoth 6b: Uses of Oil of Anointing. &quot;Our Rabbis have taught: He who pours the oil of
anointing over cattle or vessels is not guilty; if over gentiles (goyim) or the dead, he
is not guilty. The law relating to cattle and vessels is right, for it is written: &quot;Upon
the flesh of man (Adam), shall it not be poured (Exodus 30:32]); and cattle and vessels
are not man (Adam).

&quot;Also with regard to the dead, [it is plausible] that he is exempt, since after death
one is called corpse and not a man (Adam). But why is one exempt in the case of gentiles
(goyim); are they not in the category of man (Adam)? No, it is written: 'And ye my
sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are man&quot; (Adam); [Ezekiel 34:31]: Ye are called man
(Adam) but gentiles (goyim) are not called man (Adam).&quot;

In the preceding passage, the rabbis are discussing the portion of the Mosaic law which
forbids applying the holy oil to men.

The Talmud states that it is not a sin to apply the holy oil to Gentiles, because
Gentiles are not human beings (i.e. are not of Adam).

Another example from tractate Yebamoth 61a: &quot;It was taught: And so did R. Simeon ben
Yohai state (61a) that the graves of gentiles (goyim) do not impart levitical
uncleanness by an ohel [standing or bending over a grave], for it is said, 'And ye my
sheep the sheep of my pasture, are men (Adam), [Ezekiel 34:31]; you are called men
(Adam) but the idolaters are not called men (Adam).&quot;

The Old Testament Mosaic law states that touching a human corpse or the grave of a human
imparts uncleanness to those who touch it. But the Talmud teaches that if a Jew touches
the grave of a Gentile, the Jew is not rendered unclean, since Gentiles are not human
(not of Adam).

From Baba Mezia 114b: &quot;&quot;A Jewish priest was standing in a graveyard. When asked why he
was standing there in apparent violation of the Mosaic law, he replied that it was
permissible, since the law only prohibits Jews from coming into contact with the graves
of humans (Adamites), and he was standing in a gentile graveyard. For it has been taught
by Rabbi Simon ben Yohai: 'The graves of gentiles [goyim] do not defile. For it is
written, 'And ye my flock, the flock of my pastures, are men (Adam)' (Ezekiel 34:31);
only ye are designated men (Adam).&quot;

Ezekiel 34:31 is the alleged Biblical proof text repeatedly cited in the preceding three
Talmud passages. But Ezekiel 34:31 does not in fact support the Talmudic notion that
only Israelites are human. What these rabbinical, anti-Gentile racists and ideologues
have done in asserting the preceding absurdities about Gentiles is distort an Old
Testament passage in order to justify their bigotry.

In Berakoth 58a the Talmud uses Ezekiel 23:20 as proof of the sub-human status of
gentiles. It also teaches that anyone (even a Jewish man) who reveals this Talmudic
teaching about non-Jews deserves death, since revealing it makes Gentiles wrathful and
causes the repression of Judaism.

The Talmudic citation of this scripture from Ezekiel as a &quot;proof-text&quot; is specious,
since the passage does not prove that Gentiles are animals. The passage from Ezekiel
only says that some Egyptians had large genital organs and copious emissions. This does
not in any way prove or even connote that the Egyptians being referred to in the Bible
were considered animals. Once again, the Talmud has falsified the Bible by means of
distorted interpretation.

Other Talmud passages which expound on Ezekiel 23:20 in this racist fashion are: Arakin
19b, Berakoth 25b, Niddah 45a, Shabbath 150a, Yebamoth 98a. Moreover, the original text
of Sanhedrin 37a applies God's approval only to the saving of Jewish lives (cf. the
Hesronot Ha-shas, Cracow, 1894).

Moses Maimonides: Advocate of Extermination

We will now examine the post-Talmudic commentator Rambam (Moses Maimonides). This
revered &quot;sage&quot; taught that Christians should be exterminated. He has the highest stature
in Judaism:

&quot;Moses Maimonides is considered the greatest codifier and philosopher in Jewish history.
He is often affectionately referred to as the Rambam, after the initials of his name and
title, Rabenu Moshe Ben Maimon, &quot;Our Rabbi, Moses son of Maimon.&quot; [Maimonides'
Principles, edited by Aryeh Kaplan, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America,,
p. 3].

Here is what Maimonides (Rambam) taught concerning saving people's lives, especially
concerning saving the lives of gentiles and Christians, or even Jews who dared to deny
the &quot;divine inspiration&quot; of the Talmud:

Maimonides, Mishnah Torah, (Moznaim Publishing Corporation, Brooklyn, New York, 1990,
Chapter 10, English Translation), p. 184: &quot;Accordingly, if we see an idolater (gentile)
being swept away or drowning in the river, we should not help him. If we see that his
life is in danger, we should not save him.&quot; The Hebrew text of the Feldheim 1981 edition
of Mishnah Torah states this as well.

Immediately after Maimonides' admonition that it is a duty for Jews not to save a
drowning or perishing gentile, he informs us of the Talmudic duty of Jews towards
Christians, and also towards Jews who deny the Talmud. Maimonides, Mishnah Torah,
(Chapter 10), p. 184:

&quot;It is a mitzvah [religious duty], however, to eradicate Jewish traitors, minnim, and
apikorsim, and to cause them to descend to the pit of destruction, since they cause
difficulty to the Jews and sway the people away from God, as did Jesus of Nazareth and
his students, and Tzadok, Baithos, and their students. May the name of the wicked rot.&quot;

The Jewish publisher's commentary accompanying the preceding statement of Maimonides
states that Jesus was an example of a min (plural: minnim).

The commentary also states that the students of Tzadok were defined as those Jews who
deny the truth of the Talmud and who uphold only the written law (i.e. the Old
Testament).

According to Maimonides' Principles, p. 5, Maimonides &quot;spent twelve years extracting
every decision and law from the Talmud, and arranging them all into 14 systematic
volumes. The work was finally completed in 1180, and was called Mishnah Torah, or &quot;Code
of the Torah.&quot;

Maimonides taught in another part of the Mishnah Torah that gentiles are not human: &quot;Man
alone, and not vessels, can contract uncleanness by carriage. ...The corpse of a
gentile, however, does not convey uncleanness by overshadowing. ...a gentile does not
contract corpse uncleanness; and if a gentile touches, carries, or overshadows a corpse
he is as one who did not touch it.

&quot;To what is this like? It is like a beast which touches a corpse or overshadows it. And
this applies not to corpse uncleanness only but to any other kind of uncleanness:
neither gentiles nor cattle are susceptible to any uncleanness.&quot; (The Code of
Maimonides, vol. 10, translated by Herbert Danby, Yale University Press, New Haven,
1954, pp. 8-9).

Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Rotze'ach 2:11: &quot;A Jew who killed a righteous gentile
is not executed in a court of law. It says in Exodus 21:14, 'If a man schemes against
his fellow man and kills the man deliberately, take him away from the altar and put him
to death.' But a gentile is not considered a man, and even more so, a Jew is not
executed for killing an unrighteous gentile.&quot;

The Schindler's List Quote

The Talmud (i.e., the Babylonian Talmud) text of Sanhedrin 37a restricts the duty to
save life to saving only Jewish lives.

The book on Hebrew censorship, written by Jews themselves (Hesronot Ha-shas), notes that
some Talmud texts use the universalist phrase:

&quot;Whoever destroys the life of a single human being...it is as if he had destroyed an
entire world; and whoever preserves the life of a single human being ...it is as if he
had preserved an entire world.&quot;

However, Hesronot Ha-shas points out that these are not the authentic words of the
original Talmud.

In other words, the preceding universalist rendering is not the authentic text of the
Talmud and thus, for example, this universalist version which Steven Spielberg in his
famous movie, Schindler's List attributed to the Talmud (and which became the motto of
the movie on posters and in advertisements), is a hoax and constitutes propaganda
intended to give a humanistic gloss to a Talmud which is, in its essence, racist and
chauvinist hate literature.

In the authentic, original Talmud text it states that &quot;whoever preserves a single soul
of Israel, it is as if he had preserved an entire world&quot; (emphasis supplied). The
authentic Talmud text sanctions only the saving of Jewish lives.

Jewish Deception and Dissimulation

The response of the orthodox rabbis to documentation regarding the racism and hatred in
their sacred texts is simply to brazenly lie, in keeping with the Talmud's Baba Kamma
113a which states that Jews may use lies (&quot;subterfuge&quot;) to circumvent a Gentile.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a multi-million dollar rabbinical propaganda center
dispatched Rabbi Daniel Landes in 1995 to deny that the Talmud dehumanizes non-Jews.
&quot;This is utter rot,&quot; he said. His proof? Why, his word, of course.

Lying to &quot;circumvent a Gentile&quot; has a long patrimony in Judaism. Take for example the
13th century Talmud debate in Paris between Nicholas of Donin, a Jewish convert to
Christianity, whom Hyam Maccoby admits had &quot;a good knowledge of the Talmud&quot; ( &quot;The Jews
on Trial,&quot; p. 26) and Rabbi Yehiel. Yehiel was not under threat of death, bodily injury,
imprisonment or fine. Yet he brazenly lied during the course of the debate.

When asked by Donin whether there were attacks on Jesus in the Talmud, Yehiel denied
that there were any. Donin, a Hebrew and Aramaic scholar, knew this to be false. Hyam
Maccoby, a 20th century Jewish commentator on the debate, defends Rabbi Yehiel's lying
in this way:

&quot;The question may be asked, however, whether Yehiel really believed that Jesus was not
mentioned in the Talmud, or whether he put this forward as an ingenious ploy in the
desperate situation in which he found himself...It would certainly have been pardonable
of the rabbi to attempt some condonation in which he did not fully believe, to prevent
such tyrannical proceedings by one religious culture against another.&quot; ( Maccoby, &quot;The
Jews on Trial,&quot; p. 28).

This is how Jewish denial of the existence of hateful Talmud texts is justified to this
day. A fanciful word for Jewish lying is conjured (&quot;condonation&quot;) and deemed
&quot;pardonable,&quot; while any scrutiny of Jewish holy books by Christian investigators is
characterized as a &quot;tyrannical proceeding.&quot;

In 1994, Rabbi Tzvi Marx, director of Applied Education at the Shalom Hartman Institute
in Jerusalem, made a remarkable admission concerning how Jewish rabbis in the past have
issued two sets of texts: the authentic Talmudic texts with which they instruct their
own youth in the Talmud schools (yeshiviot) and &quot;censured and amended&quot; versions which
they disseminate to gullible non-Jews for public consumption.

Rabbi Marx states that in the version of Maimonides' teachings published for public
consumption, Maimonides is made to say that whoever kills a human being transgresses the
law.

But, Rabbi Marx points out &quot;...this only reflects the censured and amended printed text,
whereas the original manuscripts have it only as 'whoever kills an Israelite.&quot;(Tikkun: A
Bi-Monthly Jewish Critique May-June, 1994).

The Jewish book, Hesronot Ha-shas (&quot;that which is removed from the Talmud&quot;), is
important in this regard. (Cf. William Popper, The Censorship of Hebrew Books p. 59).

Hesronot Ha-shas was reprinted in 1989 by Sinai Publishing of Tel-Aviv. Hesronot Ha-shas
is valuable because it lists both the original Talmud texts that were later changed or
omitted, and the falsified texts cited for Gentile consumption as authentic.

Historian William Popper states: &quot;It was not always that long passages...were
censored...but often single words alone were omitted...Often, in these cases, another
method of correction was used in place of omission--substitution.&quot; (Cf. William Popper,
The Censorship of Hebrew Books pp. 58-59).

For example, the translators of the English Soncino version of the Talmud sometimes
render the Hebrew word goyim (Gentiles) under any number of disguise words such as
&quot;heathen, Cuthean, Kushite, Egyptian, idolater&quot; etc. But these are actually references
to Gentiles (all non-Jews). Footnotes for certain passages in the Soncino Talmud
translation state: &quot;Cuthean (Samaritan) was here substituted for the original goy...&quot;

The heirs of the Pharisees often deny the existence of the Talmud passages here cited,
in order to brazenly claim that such passages are the &quot;fabrications of anti-Semites.&quot;

In 1994, the 80 year old Lady Jane Birdwood was arrested and prosecuted in a criminal
court in London, England for the &quot;crime&quot; of publishing in her pamphlet, The Longest
Hatred, the truthful statement that the Talmud contains anti-Gentile and anti-Christian
passages. (She was accused of violating the Public Order Act of 1986).

In the course of her Orwellian thought-crime trial, which was ignored by the U.S. media,
a rabbi was called as a prosecution witness. The rabbi proceeded to flatly deny that the
Talmud contained anti-Gentile or anti-Christian passages and on the basis of the rabbi's
&quot;prestige,&quot; this elderly and ailing woman was sentenced to three months in jail and
fined the equivalent of $1,000.

&quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; Response to the Talmud

Neither the modern popes or the modern heads of Protestantism, have ever insisted that
the rabbis of Judaism repudiate or condemn the racism in the Talmud or the murderous
hate for Christians and gentiles expressed within it. On the contrary, the heads of
Churchianity have urged the followers of Christ to obey, honor and support the followers
of the Talmud. Therefore, it should be obvious that these Catholic and Protestant
leaders are the worst betrayers of Jesus Christ on earth today. (Cf. Matthew 23:13-15; I
Thess. 2:14-16; Titus 1:14; Luke 3:8-9; Rev. 3:9).

Non-Jews are &quot;Supernal Refuse&quot;

Moreover, not only Christians but non-Christians of all races are regarded as &quot;supernal
refuse&quot; (garbage) by Talmud teachers such as the founder of Habad-Lubavitch, Rabbi
Shneur Zalman.

This was analyzed in the Jewish magazine, New Republic: &quot;...there are some powerful
ironies in Habad's new messianic universalism, in its mission to the gentiles; and
surely the most unpleasant of them concerns Habad's otherwise undisguised and even
racial contempt for the goyim.

&quot;...medieval Jewish theologians--most notably the poet and philosopher Judah Ha-Levi in
twelfth-century Spain and the mystic Judah Loewe in sixteenth-century Prague--sought to
define the Jewish distinction racially rather than spiritually...this...view, according
to which there is something innately superior about the Jews, was rehabilitated in its
most extreme form by Shneur Zalman of Lyady. The founder of Lubavitcher Hasidism taught
that there is a difference of essence between the souls of Jews and the souls of
gentiles, that only in the Jewish soul does there reside a spark of divine vitality.

&quot;As for the goyim...Zalman's attitude (was): 'Gentile souls are of a completely
different and inferior order. They are totally evil, with no redeeming qualities
whatsoever.'

&quot;Consequently, references to gentiles in Rabbi Shneur Zalman's teachings are invariably
invidious. Their (non-Jews) material abundance derives from supernal refuse. Indeed,
they themselves derive from refuse, which is why they are more numerous than the Jews,
as the pieces of chaff outnumber the kernels...All Jews were innately good, all gentiles
innately evil.

&quot;...Moreover, this characterization of gentiles as being inherently evil, as being
spiritually as well as biologically inferior to Jews, has not in any way been revised in
later Habad writing.&quot; --The New Republic, May 4, 1992. Also cf. Roman A. Foxbrunner,
Habad: The Hasidism of Shneur Zalman of Lyady (Northvale, New Jersey, Jason Aronson,
Inc., 1993) pp. 108-109.

U.S. Government Lays Groundwork for Talmudic Courts

&quot;Our&quot; government under Presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton, has provided, under the
euphemism of education (for example, House Joint Resolution 173 and Public Law 102-14),
a groundwork for the establishment of Talmudic &quot;courts of justice&quot; to be administered by
disciples of Shneur Zalman's Chabad successor, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.

Maimonides ruled that it is a Jewish court -- or a court appointed by Jewish authority
--that enforces obedience and passes judgment on Gentiles, as well as promulgating
legislation by court order for that purpose. Maimonides further decreed that any
non-Jewish nation &quot;not subject to our jurisdiction&quot; (tahaht yadeinu) will be the target
of Jewish holy war. (Cf. Hilkhot Melakhim 8:9-10; 10:11. Also cf. Gerald J. Blidstein,
&quot;Holy War in Maimonidean Law,&quot; in Perspectives on Maimonides [Oxford, England: Oxford
Univ. Press, 1991].

These courts are to be convened allegedly under the &quot;Noahide Laws&quot; (proscriptions
against idolatry supposedly based on the covenant with Noah). The U.S. presidents and
Congress urged the adoption of the &quot;Noahide&quot; Laws as interpreted by Chabad-Lubavitch
Grand Rabbi Schneerson.

Prof. Easterly of the Southern University Law Center, a Jewish legal expert, has
compared this Public law 102-14 to the &quot;first rays of dawn&quot; which &quot;evidence the rising
of a still unseen sun.&quot;

The Jewish Encyclopedia envisages a Noahide regime as a possible world order immediately
preceding the universal reign of the Talmud.

It has to be understood that we are not dealing with the Noah of the Bible when the
religion of Judaism refers to &quot;Noahide law,&quot; but the Noahide law as understood and
interpreted by the absolute system of falsification that constitutes the Talmud.

Under the Talmud's counterfeit Noahide Laws, the worship of Jesus is forbidden under
penalty of death, since such worship of Christ is condemned by Judaism as idolatry.
Meanwhile various forms of incest are permitted under the Talmudic understanding of the
Noahide code. (Enziklopediya Talmudit, note 1, pp. 351-352).

Furthermore, all non-Jews would have the legal status of ger toshav (&quot;resident alien,&quot;
cf. Alan Unterman, Dictionary of Jewish Lore and Legend [London: Thames and Hudson,
1991], p. 148), even in their own land; as for example in occupied Palestine where newly
arrived Khazars from Russia have an automatic right to housing and citizenship, while
two million Palestinian refugees who either fled or were expelled by the Israelis, are
forbidden the right of return.

Resident alien status has been clearly delineated in scholarly articles in leading
Jewish publications. For example, Hebrew University Professor Mordechai Nisan, basing
his exposition on Maimonides, stated that a non-Jew permitted to reside in a land ruled
by Jewish law &quot;must accept paying a tax and suffering the humiliation of servitude.&quot;

If Gentiles refuse to live a life of inferiority, then this signals their rebellion and
the unavoidable necessity of Jewish warfare against their very presence. [Cf. Mordechai
Nisan, Kivunim (official publication of the World Zionist Organization), August, 1984,
pp. 151-156].

At a symposium (&quot;Is Autonomy for Resident Aliens Feasible?&quot;) organized by Israeli
Minister of Education Shulamit Aloni, the Israeli Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren repeated the
Talmudic teaching on resident aliens: that Judaism forbids &quot;granting any national
rights&quot; to them. He ruled that such &quot;Autonomy is tantamount to a denial of the Jewish
religion.&quot; (Nadav Shraggai, Ha'aretz, Oct. 14, 1992).

American taxpayers' subsidy of the so-called &quot;U.S. Holocaust Museum&quot; in Washington,
D.C., is yet another indicator of the gradual establishment of a Jewish state religion
in the U.S. This &quot;Holocaust museum&quot; excludes any reference to holocausts perpetrated by
Jewish Communists against Christians in Russia and Eastern Europe, from 1917 onward.

The focus of the museum is almost entirely on Jewish suffering. Holocausts perpetrated
by Israelis against Arabs in Lebanon and Palestine since 1948 are nowhere to be found in
the exhibits of the U.S. &quot;Holocaust Museum,&quot; which functions more like a synagogue than
a repository of objective historical information.

It is through the rapid emergence of this ostensibly secular but all-pervasive
&quot;Holocaustianity&quot; -- whereby the religion of Judaism is gaining enormous power and
influence as mankind's supreme ethos and the creed of God's Holy People.

Jewish Law Requires Christians be Executed

Israeli &quot;Torah scholars&quot; have ruled that:

&quot;The Torah maintains that the righteous of all nations have a place in the World to
Come. But not all religious Gentiles earn eternal life by virtue of observing their
religion...And while the Christians do generally accept the Hebrew Bible as truly from
God, many of them (those who accept the so-called divinity of Jesus) are idolaters
according to the Torah, punishable by death, and certainly will not enjoy the World to
Come.&quot;

Jewish Superstitions

It is not for nothing that the authoritative edition of the Talmud is known as the
Babylonian Talmud. As Christians misled by their Judaizing preachers and popes are
increasingly consulting Jewish rabbinical sources for a &quot;pure&quot; understanding of the Old
Testament, they are unknowingly consulting the occult.

Judaism is the religion of the Pharisees and the patrimony of Babylon, from whence the
Talmudic and Kabbalistic traditions of Judaism ultimately derive. Orthodox Judaism's
other sacred book, the Kabbalah, is filled with astrological teachings, fortune-telling,
gematria, necromancy and demonology.

The photograph on the cover of this publication's hard copy version shows an orthodox
Jew performing a ritual to transfer his sins to the chicken he is waving over his head.
This is pernicious superstition.

Furthermore, the Israeli &quot;Star of David,&quot; is actually nothing of the kind, but rather an
occult hexagram, a yantra of the androgyne, which became associated with the Khazars in
14th century Bohemia. (The misnamed &quot;state of Israel&quot; was founded in 1948 in an alliance
between Jewish Communists and atheistic Zionists, with crucial U.N. recognition provided
by Soviet Communist dictator Joseph Stalin).

Christians might find it eye-opening to visit a Hasidic Jewish area during &quot;Purim&quot; and
observe the grotesque, Halloween-like cavorting. Though the Purim festival uses the Book
of Esther as its supposed proof-text, in practice the Jewish celebration of Purim is
little more than a Bacchanal (cf. &quot;Superstitions said legacy from Jewish ancestors,&quot;
Canadian Jewish News, Nov. 16, 1989, p. 58).

Orthodox rabbis place curses, cast spells and imagine they have powers greater than God,
derived from their study of the Sefer Yezriah, (a book of Kabbalistic magic). Christians
are trafficking in Babylonian paganism when they defer to the rabbis of Judaism.

Sodomy in the synagogue

From a report published in the Hebrew language Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz

&quot;...for many years, (Talmud scribe) Yaakov Yitzhak Brizel...sodomized ultra-Orthodox
boys. The greatest rabbis knew - and did nothing...

&quot;At the age of 11, Moisheleh, the strongest fellow in the talmud torah (school for
ultra-Orthodox boys), went up to Shaiya Brizel and said to him: 'Kid, I want you know
that your father is not the holy man you think he is. He is a homo.' ...Brizel was a
scion of the Brizel family, which founded ...the mysterious organization that imposes
moral order on the ultra-Orthodox ghetto...

&quot;Had the father, Yaakov Yitzhak Brizel ...contented himself with homosexual relations
with adults, it is reasonable to suppose that we would never have heard his son's story.

&quot;However, in his book, The Silence of the Ultra-Orthodox, published a few weeks ago, the
son claims that for decades his father ...sodomized yeshiva students. He committed the
act in empty synagogues during the hours between prayers and in other places.

&quot;The greatest of the ultra-Orthodox rabbis...like Rabbi Landau and the halachic sage
Shmuel Halevi Hausner of Bnei Brak, knew and kept silent. The father was a Hasid heart
and soul, and went to a number of rebbes.... the twin brother of the rebbe from Rehovot,
the Rebbe of Kretschnif in Kiryat Gat, was happy to accept the father among his
followers. Ultimately, claims Brizel, it was not easy for the Rebbe from Kiryat Gat to
be picky when he could win such a respected adherent.

&quot;...The proud father with the look of an honored rebbe, who observed all the
commandments from the slightest to the most important, used to pray at a certain yeshiva
with the young boys. There, claims Shaiya Brizel, he hunted his victims. When the head
of the yeshiva discovered the true reason that the respected Torah scribe was praying
fervently at his yeshiva, he did not contact the police...

&quot;Before the publication of his book, Shaiya Brizel met with the yeshiva head. 'You are
right that we covered up for him,' admitted the man. 'I and a few other rabbis...I was
busy trying to calm things down and hushing up the affair so that it would not get
publicized.'

&quot;(The son) published the book using real names. His entire family and almost all the
rabbis appear under their own names. Only the names of some of the localities and the
head of the yeshiva are disguised. To protect himself from a legal point of view, Brizel
held a series of conversations with members of his family and rabbis, in which he
demanded explanations of why they had covered up for his father's misbehavior. He
secretly recorded all these conversations, even with his mother.

&quot;If I had written without the names it would have been fiction and this certainly did
not suit me,&quot; he explained. 'I wanted things to change, for ultra-Orthodox society to
know that it can attempt to hide things and be hidden, but even if it takes 30 years, a
Golem will always rise up against its creator and reveal everything. In this case, I was
the Golem.'

&quot;When Rachel Brizel, the daughter of a good Bnei Brak family, married an arranged match
from the glorious Brizel family, she had no idea that she was destroying her own life.
After six months, she caught her husband having sex with another man. In that case, at
least it was with an adult.

&quot;Shaiya Brizel relates that some of the boys with whom his father had relations sent
letters of complaint to their own fathers; in the discreet ultra-Orthodox society they
had no one else to whom they could complain.

Shaiya Brizel: author of a book telling of sodomy in the synagogue

&quot;When she read these letters, my mother went out of her mind,' writes Brizel. 'Every
such letter made her want to demand a divorce. Again and again batteries of mediators,
the Brizel rabbis, would show up, whose job it was to calm her down so that, heaven
forbid, she would not destroy the good name of the Brizel family.

&quot;They could live with the fact that one of their own had raped minors, but for them
divorce was an impossible situation.'

&quot;...Twice, once during prayers in a synagogue, and once during a Gemara (Talmud) study
hour at Rabbi Eliezer Shach's Ponevezh Yeshiva, ultra-Orthodox men who were strangers to
him touched his sexual organ, presumably on the assumption that he followed in his
father's footsteps. The first time, he made a fuss, only to discover that the only thing
that interested the people there was to hush the whole thing up. The second time, he
made do with a whispered warning to the man.

&quot;Shaiya Brizel is now 36 and the father of three; he works as an accountant.

&quot;His father, 65, was forced to leave home several years ago and return to his elderly
parents' apartment. Shaiya wrote this book after a suicide attempt in June.

'For all those years I was half dead. For the past five years I have been getting
psychological treatment. During my talks with the psychologist I decided that I was
going to spew out all this ugliness in the form of a book.'

&quot;He took into account that there would be violent reactions to the book...which only
came out a few weeks ago...Brizel suffers from a serious heart defect, which could cause
his death. As a way of protecting himself, he has deposited a letter with three lawyers
that contains serious allegations about the Eda Haredit, and he has informed the
relevant people.

&quot;Recently, he has moved to a new apartment, and he lives in the National Religious
sector of a mixed community of National Religious and ultra-Orthodox families.
Naturally, he started praying at the only Hasidic synagogue in the settlement. After the
book came out, associates of the local rebbe (rabbi) informed him that he was persona
non grata.

&quot;Ironically, this same rebbe had come to the area after being compelled to leave several
other communities on suspicion of having sodomized his pupils. In ultra-Orthodox
society, revealing that acts of sodomy have been committed is a far graver offense than
committing them.

&quot;On the day the book was published, Brizel met with the head of the Hachemei Lublin
Yeshiva, Rabbi Avraham Vazner. 'He told me that publishing the book was a million times
worse than what my father had done...'

&quot;Ha'aretz has been unable to obtain a response from Rabbi Yaakov Yitzhak Brizel. At his
parents' home, a woman replied: &quot;We don't care. Shaiya is a liar and there is nothing
more to be said.&quot;

&quot;Ha'aretz also requested the Brizels' response through the Eda Haredit activist Yehuda
Meshi- Zahav. By the time the article went to press, there was no response through this
channel either.

&quot;Several weeks ago the father responded to the women's magazine La'isha, saying that he
would sue the publishers, which has not yet happened. It is unlikely that it will
happen.

&quot;Shaiya Brizel was ready to put off publication of the book, on condition that the
family sue him in a rabbinical court, in which the affair would be aired. He has said
that no one in the family was prepared to take up the challenge.

&quot;In the conversation with La'isha, the father said that he was indeed a homosexual, 'But
I have had treatment and today I am no longer like that. All this is behind me.'

&quot;In reply to a question as to whether he had sexual relations with minors, he replied:
'Perhaps I will talk about that some other time.' He accused his son Shaiya of being
'the only one who is after me. He has destroyed my life...He wrote this only for the
money. He wanted money from me...Because of him I separated from my wife.'

&quot;Shaiya's sister, Rivka Hubert, spoke with great anger to the La'isha reporter about the
fact that her brother had revealed the names of the persons involved, and declared: 'We
deny everything it says in the book.&quot;

Christianity is the only true religion of the Bible. It was founded by Israelites who
adhered to the Torah (Pentateuch) and who recognized in Christ's gospel of salvation
through grace, the fulfillment of the Old Testament. It is the followers of Jesus who
constitute the holy nation and the royal priesthood (I Peter 2:9).
