Several years ago, at an auction, I purchased a pale green
bottle with the embossed words &quot;Pluto Water&quot; and &quot;America's
Physic.&quot; There's also an embossed figure on it (an imp or
devil.)

I've NEVER been able to find anything on this one -- does anyone
have a clue?

Kris

Can't be sure, but I think that Pluto Water was a mineral water bottled at
French Lick, Indiana (home of Larry Bird). There is a historic resort
area there that was frequented by raqueteers in days gone by...a very
luxurious place in its time. At the heart of it is a structure built
around a spring. They call it Pluto water. I can't find details right
now, but could probably dig up some more if you are interested.
