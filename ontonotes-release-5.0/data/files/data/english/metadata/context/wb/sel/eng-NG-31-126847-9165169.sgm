Massachusetts Faces a Test on Health Care
Samuel B. Hagan, 27, a courier who also does not have insurance, says
he is not concerned about serious health problems.
A year after Massachusetts became the only state to require that
individuals have health coverage, residents face deadlines to sign up
or lose their personal tax exemption, worth $219 on next year's state
income tax returns. More than 200,000 previously uninsured residents
have enrolled, but state officials estimate that at least that number,
and perhaps twice as many, have not.

Those managing the enrollment effort say it has exceeded expectations.
In particular, state-subsidized insurance packages offered to low-
income residents have been so popular that the program's spending may
exceed its budget by nearly $150 million.

But the reluctance of so many to enroll, along with the possible
exemption of 60,000 residents who cannot afford premiums, has raised
questions about whether even a mandate can guarantee truly universal
coverage.

Additional concerns have been generated by projections that the
state's insurers plan to raise rates 10 percent to 12 percent next
year, twice this year's national average. That would undercut the
plan's secondary goal of slowing the increase in health costs.

&quot;We're going to be very aggressive in trying to get those numbers down
to single digits,&quot; said Jon M. Kingsdale, executive director of the
Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, the agency that
markets the subsidized insurance policies. &quot;If we continue with double-
digit inflation, I don't think health reform is sustainable.&quot;
