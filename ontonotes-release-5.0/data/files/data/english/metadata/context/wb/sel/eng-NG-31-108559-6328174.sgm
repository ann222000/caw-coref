I did some searching for magnification tools for inspection of
homebrew PCB's....

I checked out the toy digital microscope at:
http://www.playdigitalblue.com/products/qx5/info/

I read what the pros are using:
http://groups.google.ca/group/sci.electronics.design/browse_frm/threa...

Looked at stereo microscopes dental/surgical binoculars on ebay.

Then I discovered a hack-your-digicam website
http://www.hoagieshouse.com/macro/

How about this idea..
I'd like to find a handheld digital camera with a video output and
attachable 2x or up to 10x macro lens.
I'd mount it on a stand to magnify, video or photograph PCB's.
Then I can move the PCB around and watch the enlarged footage off my
computer monitor.

Since the camera is not dedicated for macro use, I can remove it from
the stand and take it with me for vacation photos/video.

Has anybody done this? Is it a good idea?
I did a little google searching and became impatient.. :)

Do a little more google searching. I've seen digital cameras that still
accept real lenses from real cameras - you could zoom in arbitrarily
tight, or photograph the Lunar Explorers, depending what's the budget to
buy the lenses. :-)

As far as finding one, you know I'm not about to do your homework for
you! ;-)

Have Fun!

Just gambling that someone here might have set up a video/photo
cam+macro lens to create a computer based PCB magnifier.
I'll also be looking into crazy junk yard ideas like maybe getting an
ebay security camera and stick on any cheapo ebay macro lens.

I'll keep searching and check out digicam's with ~ real~ lenses too :)

Now that you mention it, I have a "web-cam", which has, I think, 320 x 200
resolution, that I got off ebay for $0.01 + $5.00 shipping. It plugs
into the parallel port, and has a Windows driver, somewhere around here.

It's about the size of a golf ball, and has the quality of lens that
you see on disposables, but when you unscrew the lens you can see the
element itself - if you had the proper setup, you could probably point
just about any lens at it - if you think you'd be happy with 320x200
resolution. ;-)

Cheers!

I've  a colour CCD video camera with a zoom lens. Can have it on it's tripod
about a foot away from the pcb and with zoom,  have useful close ups. Camera
video plugs straight into a Haupannuage? TV card in the PC, so I've a  live
picture on the iiyama monitor and can adjust zoom and focus at will.
A click and a pic is frozen to a jpg. Camera needs as min' a 1/3rd inch CCD
sensor and at least 500k pixels of video on display. (Preferably 1M).
Beats farting about with those useless, back of camera LCDs and crappy USB,
low res', low frame rate  video. I originally modified a webcam but found
the video quality from those things is barely at 'toy' level.

Interesting :)
I do plan on using above web cam quality..
Likewise, I have a TV card too with video in.
Thanks the resolution recommendation.

Good for you, but they don't work for everyone.  All "reading
glasses" do is make my vision worse. My uncorrected vision was 20/200 &amp;
20/400 when I was 20, and has become even worse over the years

In the US you can find them for a couple dollars at flea markets.  I
used to sell over 100 pair a day at $1 a pair.  Some people bought them
by the dozen.

Michael,  Get cataract surgery... aka lens replacement... fastest way
from 20/400 (which I used to be) to 20/20 ;-)

Headgear!!!
Looks like it does the job :)
Stereoscopic too for depth...
I do wonder where that's sold..

But I can't resist the "cool" factor of a DIY PC based videoscope.
Just makes me feel like a kid again. New toy microscope :)
It'll be good for inspection and documentation of PCB's.

I would think "resurfacing a watch crystal"

You obviously haven't had it done... I have.

They blast away you existing lens with a laser, make a small slit and
slip it an artificial lens.

Takes just a few minutes.

Maybe adapting a cheapo ebay macro lens from an old camera is possible
if more magnification is needed.

A few months ago, I went shopping for a 3Megapixel camera.

No I was nearsighted when I went in, 20/30 when I left.

This was 9 years ago.  I've now developed some astigmatism, so I don't

&gt;&gt;I have 2 (soon to be 3) solutions;

&gt;&gt;1.  A pair of the cheap magnifying goggles that sit on a head-band and
&gt;&gt;you can flip up and down,  I find they work very well with my normal
&gt;&gt;prescription specs.

&gt;&gt;2. A Swift stereo microscope (x10 and x 20)  I bought mine from a used
&gt;&gt;microscope dealer (I Miller)  in Philly, he usually has a good range.

&gt;&gt;3. Soon to be.   In Oct  01,  &quot;Silicon Chip&quot; published an article on
&gt;&gt;building one from a cheap digicam, an old SLR lens and PVC waste-pipe
&gt;&gt;fittings. It  looks pretty good.

I bought a nice clip-on binoc magnifier lens (2.5Xmag )on Ebay,cost me $9
including shipping.It clips on to my eyeglass frame,weighs less than the
visor-type magnifiers,and doesn't obstruct peripheral vision.

BTW,Edmund Scientific ( www.edsci.com)sells video inspection stuff,although
it's pricey.

&gt; How about this idea..
&gt; I'd like to find a handheld digital camera with a video output and
&gt; attachable 2x or up to 10x macro lens.
&gt; I'd mount it on a stand to magnify, video or photograph PCB's.
&gt; Then I can move the PCB around and watch the enlarged footage off my
&gt; computer monitor.

&gt; Since the camera is not dedicated for macro use, I can remove it from
&gt; the stand and take it with me for vacation photos/video.

&gt; Has anybody done this? Is it a good idea?
&gt; I did a little google searching and became impatient.. :)

I bought a B&amp;L Stereo zoom maybe 8 years ago for $300. It had a heavy
stand that is designed so you can slip PCBs under it. No regrets. I'd
sure hate to have to pay shipping on such a beast.

I've also fiddled with a supercircuits camera (B&amp;W) and C-mount spaces
for close focusing. It's not bad, but you still need a steady base.
Such microscope stands show up all the time on ebay. This is the stand
I have:

Stand_W0QQitemZ120083412966QQihZ002QQcategoryZ11813QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem#eba yphotohosting&gt;
This is the focusing arm:

You can try your luck on ebay with complete microscopes, but I passed
over so many clunkers at the flea market that I didn't even argue
regarding the one I bought, which had nothing wobbly.

You can get microscopes on Craigslist. They tend to be lab scopes, not
assembly scopes. The deal with the B&amp;L is you have decent working
room.

Or you can go to one of the budget on-line glasses places (with prices
down in the $14 delivered range on up, depending on which website you
choose and what frames you want), but you'll need a tiny bit of research
into how to specify a magnifier in optician terms. (ie, +3 diopter is
1.75X, +5 is 2.25X, +12 is 4X). If you happen to wear glasses, this can
be a very good option, as you can get magnifying glasses that fit your
eye spacing and other aspects of your prescription in one package (by
starting with your prescription and adding appropriate magnification).
If you bring the subject up while in the eye doctor's office, you can
probably have a preview of the effect (useful - bring something you'd
like to look at with you) and a prescription for your "special
work-magnifying reading-type glasses" if you feel the need. If you don't
wear glasses, it's still cheaper than most magnifiers, and you can still
get the correct eyespacing (good luck on that with most magnivisors).

These simple magnifiers have working distance limitations (shorter as
the power gets higher - 4X would have the work awfully close to your
nose), but no worse or different than the visor type things that are the
same principle. Telescopic magnifiers can improve the working distance,
but generally cost quite a bit more. There's probably a way to home-brew
a cheaper solution to the telescopic versions.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Michael,  Get cataract surgery... aka lens replacement...

&gt; &gt;&gt;I would think &quot;resurfacing a watch crystal&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;would be the analogy for cataract surgery.

&gt; &gt;Used to be that way... fuzzy vision and various infections.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Messing with the lens seems much more invasive.

&gt; &gt;You obviously haven't had it done... I have.

&gt; &gt;They blast away you existing lens with a laser, make a small slit and
&gt; &gt;slip it an artificial lens.

&gt; &gt;Takes just a few minutes.

&gt; Was it painful? I'm going to need that in a year or so, I estimate.

&gt; Can they leave me nearsighted?

Not terribly.  My Mom was getting home from having hers done as you
posted this!  Today she's tired, but fine.

Yes, they can leave you nearsighted.  Discuss it with the doc &amp;
(s)he'll make you whatever you want.  I encouraged Mom to do this, but
she opted to shoot for emmetropia (0.0 diopters correction).  I
personally wouldn't want that.  I like being able to see clearly up
close, sans lenses.  The imprecision of the lens replacement, however,
is such that you could easily wind up +0.5 or more, i.e.,
significantly farsighted.  Farsighted, of course, means you can't ever
see anything clearly, ever, without some sort of appliance.  Too early
to tell, but it looks so far like that's what she got.

Another choice is to have one "far" eye and the other "close" aka
"monovision."  Very handy if you can stand it, but life-wrecking to
those who can't.  I'm that way naturally and like it.  Most docs will
Rx trial contact lenses beforehand that simulate the various choices
so you can try it before you buy it.  Highly recommended.

James Arthur
