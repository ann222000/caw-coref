Gaza is still under a lethal siege. Ongoing, it now goes unreported. There
is newer news. Elected representatives in the U.S. and Europe who could end
this regime of death by deprivation look on dispassionately and do nothing.
John Pilger's piece below, from ZNet, on the continuing siege was forwarded
and introduced by New Profile supporter Racheli Gai.

Looking from the side, from Belsen to Gaza January 17, 2007

By John Pilger

A genocide is engulfing the people of Gaza while a silence engulfs its

bystanders. "Some 1.4 million people, mostly children, are piled up in

one of the most densely populated regions of the world, with no freedom

of movement, no place to run and no space to hide," wrote the senior UN

relief official, Jan Egeland, and Jan Eliasson, then Swedish foreign

minister, in Le Figaro. They described people "living in a cage", cut

off by land, sea and air, with no reliable power and little water and

tortured by hunger and disease and incessant attacks by Israeli troops

and planes.

Egeland and Eliasson wrote this four months ago as an attempt to break

the silence in Europe whose obedient alliance with the United States

and Israel has sought to reverse the democratic result that brought

Hamas to power in last year's Palestinian elections. The horror in Gaza

has since been compounded; a family of 18 has died beneath a 500-pound

American/Israeli bomb; unarmed women have been mown down at point-blank

range. Dr David Halpin, one of the few Britons to break what he calls

"this medieval siege", reported the killing of 57 children by

artillery, rockets and small arms and was shown evidence that civilians

are Israel's true targets, as in Lebanon last summer. A friend in Gaza,

Dr Mona El-Farra, emailed: "I see the effects of the relentless sonic

booms [a collective punishment by the Israeli air force] and artillery

on my 13-year-old daughter. At night, she shivers with fear. Then both

of us end up crouching on the floor. I try to make her feel safe, but

when the bombs sound I flinch and scream."

When I was last in Gaza, Dr Khalid Dahlan, a psychiatrist, showed me

the results of a remarkable survey. "The statistic I personally find

unbearable," he said, "is that 99.4 per cent of the children we studied

suffer trauma. Once you look at the rates of exposure to trauma you see

why: 99.2 per cent of their homes were bombarded; 97.5 per cent were

exposed to tear gas; 96.6 per cent witnessed shootings; 95.8 per cent

witnessed bombardment and funerals; almost a quarter saw family members

injured or killed." Dr Dahlan invited me to sit in on one of his

clinics. There were 30 children, all of them traumatized. He gave each

pencil and paper and asked them to draw. They drew pictures of

grotesque acts of terror and of women streaming tears.

The excuse for the latest Israeli terror was the capture last June of

an Israeli soldier, a member of an illegal occupation, by the

Palestinian resistance. This was news. The kidnapping a few days

earlier by Israel of two Palestinians - two of thousands taken over the

years - was not news. An historian and two foreign journalists have

reported the truth about Gaza. All three are Israelis. They are

frequently called traitors. The historian Ilan Pappe has documented

that "the genocidal policy [in Gaza] is not formulated in a vacuum" but

part of Zionism's deliberate, historic ethnic cleansing. Gideon Levy

and Amira Hass are reporters on the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz. In

November, Levy described how the people of Gaza were beginning to

starve to death

"there are thousands of wounded, disabled and shell-shocked people

unable to receive any treatment the shadows of human beings roam the ruins

they only know the [Israeli army] will return and what this will mean

for them: more imprisonment in their homes for weeks, more death and

destruction in monstrous proportions."

Amira Hass, who has lived in Gaza, describes it as a prison that shames

her people. She recalls how her mother, Hannah, was being marched from

a cattle-train to the Nazi concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen on a

summer's day in 1944." [She] saw these German women looking at the

prisoners, just looking," she wrote. "This image became very formative

in my upbringing, this despicable 'looking from the side'."

"Looking from the side" is what those of us do who are cowed into

silence by the threat of being called anti-Semitic. Looking from the

side is what too many western Jews do, while those Jews who honour the

humane traditions of Judaism and say, "Not in our name!" are abused as

"self-despising". Looking from the side is what almost the entire US

Congress does, in thrall to or intimidated by a vicious Zionist

"lobby'. Looking from the side is what "even-handed" journalists do as

they excuse the lawlessness that is the source of Israeli atrocities

and supress the historic shifts in the Palestinian resistance, such as

the implicit recognition of Israel by Hamas. The people of Gaza cry out

for better.
