&gt;Sorry about the size of the file (189K) but if it's too big, don't pull

"/> You berk (rhyming slang).

We do not have the choice whether to pull it down or not as you put it
because we choose to use, quite legitimately and in common with many
others, an off-line reader.

We have been charged money by our telephone provider because you could
not be bothered to read that one does not post pictures to non binary
newsgroups. Presumably you feel that you and your garish piece of papery
are too important for this rule to apply to you.

We will try to explain this very slowly so that the dull and witless
across the ocean who have not cottoned on yet will understand. In the UK
in common with some other countries outside the US one has to pay for
the time one is connected by telephone to ones ISP. This means if you
put a large file in this newsgroup we have to pay to download it.

We are quite shocked that &quot;trancery&quot; whom we had previously considered
to be of good (albeit excitable) character replied to your posting with
some useful advice. For this reason we are sending a bill for the cost
of downloading your JPG and all the others we have had to on this
newsgroup to &quot;trancery&quot;; our estimated bill is to the amount of one
hundred dollars.

Oh yeah and we hope a rabid ground squirrel eats your squalid little
Buck Jones poster before you get it insured.

We also hope that said rabid ground squirrel then bites you.

On the bum.

Just before it copies the antics of Richard Gere's hamster.

You almost made us forget our policy of never making a complaint to a
service provider about someone's conduct on usenet.

Well, subtlety gets me in trouble again.;)
I was trying (and failed to do it, I suppose) to point out that it is
disingenuous
(not straightforward) to ask, as many do writing in here, thinking we
are
a bunch of fools they can handle with ease, for an insurance appraisal.
So, in the future, when I want to call people lying scum, I will do so
in a plainer
manner. I have to, those $100 fines will break me in a hurry!
From now on, I will just refer to all such people as &quot;eaters of corpse
pussy&quot;.
There will be no mistaking THAT for tacit approval.;)
My sincere apologies,
T.
P.S. I just love this newsgroup!

Surprise, surprise! It looks like I finally got little Trants to come out
from under his rock. How extremely clever to put my &quot;return&quot; in your post.
I bet you fooled all of the AOLers. Of course, the misspelling of my last
name may have been on purpose, but I doubt it. Puerile phraseology is your
hallmark. If you [Mr./Ms. T] are capable of debate or conversation without
resorting to your school-yard jargon, please, let's begin. Otherwise, check
out rec.mental.onanism and have a ball with those of like mind.

Your &quot;observations&quot; and &quot;contributions&quot; are of such little real use to this
group, I wonder why you hang around. I guess it must be in the vein of
small-fish-in-a-small-pond.

This wimp continues to hide behind an alias and post via &quot;talkway.&quot; As I've
told you before, you know my name and where I live. If your cajones will
allow it, drop on over. Free beer/ass whuppin' - your choice.

A pathetic faux-post trying to emulate my name is sad, even for you.

Jon's post reminded me of Warren Zevon's song, &quot;Excitable Boy&quot;

&quot;Well, he went down to dinner in his Sunday best
Excitable boy, they all said
And he rubbed the pot roast all over his chest
Excitable boy, they all said
Well, he's just an excitable boy

He took in the four a.m. show at the Clark
Excitable boy, they all said
And he bit the usherette's leg in the dark
Excitable boy, they all said
Well, he's just an excitable boy

He took little Susie to the Junior Prom
Excitable boy, they all said
and he raped her and killed her, then he took her home
Excitable boy, they all said
Well, he's just an excitable boy

After ten long years they let him out of the Home
Excitable boy, they all said
And he dug up her grave and built a cage with her bones
Excitable boy, they all said
Well, he's just an excitable boy&quot;

There was a Fleetwood Mac reunion type show on PBS over here that I hope
you get a chance to see. Just for this one thing, that Lindsey
Buckingham
is one of the best guitar players I have ever seen. I never knew he was

No need to chase this coward via his stealth ISP. I've called him out to
speak for him/herself and he/she/it counters with lame pseudo posts.

I may be a royal pain-in-the-ass, but I consider it a HOLY quest to expose
Mr./Ms. T. whenever it appears that the meds are wearing off. I have a
relatively high tolerance for name calling and ranting &amp; raving, but,
whenever psycho-twerp spews, I intend to stand as the &quot;bouncer&quot; at this pub.

With all of the Yankee bashing by the &quot;gang of Brits&quot; [sorry, Ronnie, + 1
NIer], I must say one thing you must covet [and few will experience] is true
gnarly blues sung in nasty little juke joints in the Mississippi delta [and
the piedmonts and their Memphis, Kansas City and Chicago offspring] drinking
40s and getting lost in a true American art form. To see Big Jack Johnson
give a free concert on the steps of the library in Clarksdale or just see
two old gents guitar-jammin' on their porch in Tunica or Yazoo City is
something you can't capture or experience on vinyl, CD or a dreadful movie
like &quot;Crossroads.&quot;

By the way, Ronnie - this [did I mention dreadful?] c.1985/86? movie depicts
a teenage Ralph Macchio [the brilliant thespian who thrilled us in &quot;Karate
Kid&quot;] accompanied by an old Black blues player [whisked away from a nursing
home up north] and played by Joe Seneca [the only bright spot, acting-wise]
on a quest to become THE blues guitarist ala Robert Johnson.

The music is/was good blues, however. Do yourself a favor [if you can't
visit Mississippi] listen to any good blues recording and save yourself the
agony of the movie.

Legend has it that RJ sold his soul to the devil at the crossroads [thought
today to be the intersection of US49 &amp; 61 near Clarksdale] in exchange for
his greatness. 49/61 today is not the desolate and bleak setting in the
desolate and bleak movie. It's a typical strip of American roadside,
replete with gas stations and convenience stores. If you visit the delta,
go there to say you've been, then venture into town and soak up some real
blues.

Rich

time picking out who was who in the band at the end, and my daughter
danced the whole way through. Maybe not very believable, but fun.

It must have been the cat who took control of my keyboard -- yeah, that's
it, the CAT likes BB2000...

I guess I don't have very discrimating tastes after all... I'll take any
lame excuse to listen to Aretha do R-E-S-P-E-C-T and although I don't rub
it in, I *did* recognize Clapton in the band from hell long before my Dear
Husband did. (He was still saying &quot;Clapton? No, can't be...&quot; for
*seconds* after I pointed him out.) We play just about any kind of music
around here (with jazz and blues as predominate influences) and tolerate
all sorts of abuse (including bad movies) for its sake, except that said
Dear Husband doesn't deal with the 13-yr-old's rap very well, and hates
opera, so I and the cat have to listen to Puccini in private. It's
apparently genetic -- our 5-yr-old daughter (the one who danced all the
way through BB2000) played the tape of the movie over and over until the
rental period was up, and has conceived a fondness for Andrew Lloyd Webber
show tunes after seeing the Phantom of the Opera... she has time to
develop better taste yet, I suppose...

There may be some credence in the roots of blues coming from West Africa in
the early days of the slave trade. There can be no questioning the fact,
however, that as an art form [which it truly is] it was raised amid the
institutionalized savagery of the Deep South.

Let me [largely] plagerize Robert M. Baker [from the Blues Highway] on the
&quot;Brief History of the Blues&quot; ---

Joseph Machlis says that the blues is a native American musical and verse
form, with no direct European and African antecedents of which we know. In
other words, it is a blending of both traditions. Something special and
entirely different from either of its parent traditions. (Although Alan
Lomax cites some examples of very similar songs having been found in
Northwest Africa, particularly among the Wolof and Watusi.)

The word 'blue' has been associated with the idea of melancholia or
depression since the Elizabethan era. The American writer, Washington Irving
is credited with coining the term 'the blues,' as it is now defined, in
1807. The earlier (almost entirely Negro) history of the blues musical
tradition is traced through oral tradition as far back as the 1860s.

When African and European music first began to merge to create what
eventually became the blues, the slaves sang songs filled with words telling
of their extreme suffering and privation. One of the many responses to their
oppressive environment resulted in the &quot;field holler,&quot; which gave rise to
the spiritual, and the blues, &quot;notable among all human works of art for
their profound despair. &quot;They gave voice to the mood of alienation and
anomie that prevailed in the construction camps of the South, for it was in
the Mississippi Delta that blacks were often forcibly conscripted to work on
the levee and land-clearing crews, where they were often abused and then
tossed aside or worked to death.&quot; (Lomax)

Lomax states that the blues tradition was considered to be a masculine
discipline (although some of the first blues songs heard by whites were sung
by 'lady' blues singers like Mamie Smith and Bessie Smith) and not many
black women were to be found singing the blues in the juke-joints. The
Southern prisons also contributed considerably to the blues tradition
through work songs and the songs of death row and murder, prostitutes, the
warden, the hot sun, and a hundred other privations. The prison road crews
and work gangs where were many bluesmen found their songs, and where many
other blacks simply became familiar with the same songs.

Following the Civil War (according to Rolling Stone), the blues arose as &quot;a
distillate of the African music brought over by slaves. Field hollers,
ballads, church music and rhythmic dance tunes called jump-ups evolved into
a music for a singer who would engage in call-and-response with his guitar.
He would sing a line, and the guitar would answer it.&quot; (note: I've seen
somewhere, that the guitar did not enjoy widespread popularity with blues
musicians until about the turn of the century. Until then, the banjo was the
primary blues instrument.) By the 1890s the blues were sung in many of the
rural areas of the South and by 1910, the word 'blues' as applied to the
musical tradition was in fairly common use.

Some 'bluesologists' claim (rather dubiously), that the first blues song
that was ever written down was 'Dallas Blues,' published in 1912 by Hart
Wand, a white violinist from Oklahoma City. The black composer W.C. Handy
(1873-1958) first popularized the blues form about 1911-14. However, the
poetic and musical form of the blues first crystallized around 1910 and
gained popularity through the publication of Handy's &quot;Memphis Blues&quot; (1912)
and &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; (1914). Instrumental blues had been recorded as early
as 1913. Mamie Smith recorded the first vocal blues song, 'Crazy Blues' in
1920. (note: a great piece of sheet music in my collection depicted Mamie
and her band). Priestly claims that while the widespread popularity of the
blues had a vital influence on subsequent jazz, it was the &quot;initial
popularity of jazz which had made possible the recording of blues in the
first place, and thus made possible the absorption of blues into both jazz
as well as the mainstream of pop music.&quot;

the vocal style, and the imitation of vocal idioms by instruments.

Without doubt it's an &quot;art form&quot; and now a secular folk music of
American blacks, influenced by work songs and field hollers,
minstrel-show music, ragtime, church music, as well as the folk and
popular music of whites. Blues developed in the southern United States
but the origins of the blues are poorly documented and IMO lost in
obscurity.
