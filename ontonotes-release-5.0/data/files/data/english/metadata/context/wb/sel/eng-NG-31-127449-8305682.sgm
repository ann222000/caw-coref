I heard somewhere that christening a ship goes back to the days when
people believed in gods, and when a ship was launched a child was
beaten to death on the hull of a ship as a sacrifice to appease the
sea god.

I did a google search and was unable to find any reference to
this...can someone shed some light on this for me?

Thanks!!

Well, the Vikings called it Wodening a ship. The Indian Navy currently calls
it Krishnaing a ship. When the Scient***gists have their own country,
they're going to call it Lafayetting (although there's a sub-sect that wants
to call it Cruising.) The Greeks called it Poseidoning while the Romans
called it Neptuning. Israeli ships are launched in the President's wife's
name so they don't have an actual procedure. Brit ships are Affirmed and,
yes, just like the days when people believed in gods, we like to beat a
child to death on the hull. But not on the Kingston upon Hull, Cue Commodore
Hatpin ...

Yeah, but the asterisks aren't really necessary IMO, except perhaps
as a visual representation (in the style of Kurt Vonnegut) of how the
&quot;church&quot; of Scient*logits operates.

You forgot the obigitory *spit* before the word &quot;church.&quot;  Sometimes
