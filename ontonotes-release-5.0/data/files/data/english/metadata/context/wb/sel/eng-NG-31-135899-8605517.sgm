I was wondering.. wouldn't it be better to include pc converted pictures in
modern c64 demos rather than those ugly painted red/green/purple pictures we
can see now?
I tried some conversions myself and the result was quite impressive..  like:
http://tinyurl.com/3ahomz or http://tinyurl.com/3xhm3h or
http://tinyurl.com/2vpabf .. and I bet better results are achievable.

What are you talking about? Which demo have you seen with &quot;ugly painted
red/green/purple pictures&quot; ?
Really, I don't know where did you find &quot;ugly&quot; pics in recent demos. Please
tell us.

Desert Dream http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=48039
and so on.
By the way, there are also some painting programs that allow you to convert
and (re)paint on PC and produce pics in C64 common formats, like Project
one, Timanthes, 0xpaint, Ganged... search them there aswell.

I checked these ones.. these are exactly the kinf of pics I am talking
about... the use of colours is just no good.. green.. yellow.. I mean.. a
better result can be achieved with conversions as the color is mixed really
better.. those cut colors just don't do it.

Impressive?  Did you actually watched them on a real C64?  Not all
color combinations look good on the real thing, some tend to really flicker

They aren't ugly. They are their own style. For some of these artists, they
actually pixel them. In these cases, there is partial conversion but many of
these artists don't merely just convert pics.

These colors are also used for a reason. As you are probably aware of (or
not) is the color limitation and certain colors &quot;antialias&quot; with only a
limited number of colors. Mere conversions don't particularly have any real
control of this. Sometimes, it is good - sometimes it is not and they begin
to look like many GIFs with dots scattered about and no clean antialias
shading.

The reality is that all of this is dependent on the style and artistry of
the artist. (Graphician)

I give a few examples of what I have seen. I seen some good conversions and
I seen shit. The C64's limited color and limitations can be tricky and in
many cases - raw conversion comes out like shit. Especially with
sophisticated original pics.

In the case of the DTV, those enhanced video modes are more forgiving for
converters because conversions can come out better because if you choose
8bpp mode, you can get better results verses the 4 bit color cells with
video limitations of 3 or 4 colors per 8x1 cell.

None of the stuff in the list was &quot;ugly&quot; in my opinion. This stuff is better
than what I had released in my opinion (when it comes to gfx).

Here is an example of pixelated conversion:
http://www.geocities.com/wildstar128/Pixelated-pic1.bmp

I kindly highlighted with yellow circle. An artist would inadvertantly
choose to have a different less pixelated background. The background of the
original image converted poorly and left alot of pixels shotgun bursted all
over the place. Destroying contrast. I probably would have choose to use a
solid shaded background  or a rainbow background with solid single tone rays
in a very simplistic manner which would give contrast to the person and wire
nest from the background.  Forming artistic depth, that way. It would also
soften the flicker because you can defeat flicker by having the background
the same color in both FLI images in the IFLI.  Leaving the flicker only
around the &quot;person and wire nest&quot;.

After that, I would clean that up a little further in those black areas and
make it solid black instead of ugly brown and blue pixels mixed into the
black. A little bit of artistic modification. A little bit of black
outlining might even help. At least in certain portions of the image.

I recommend the original poster of this thread to look at this in VICE with
double size on and &quot;PAL Emulation&quot; under the Options drop down menu
immediately below Double Scan. Usually, you can see how ugly something can
get right there. Don't forget guys, that the image can often be seen on an
actual TV which usually a 29&quot; to 45&quot; screen. Basically, 3-5x wider than a
VICE window on a typical PC screen.

The cleaner you can get it to view without &quot;PAL Emulation&quot; (which I would
like to call TV emulation), and with Double Size mode on - the better it
will likely look on a TV with real hardware. Even when the pic (about the
size of an average VICE emulation screen (with Double Size off) - it is
pixelated and I can see it and looks like shit.

The very pic you (original poster) claims to be ugly look nicer because they
purposely took the time to give the object contrast to its background and
this is art.

Sorry Marc, this isn't directed at you but certainly I agree with you. It
was something that I needed to say and point out. Another area that bothers
me on that one pic was the face of the &quot;person meddling with the wire nest&quot;,
I can't tell what it is suppose to be. Also, I can't distinctively tell
exactly what he is messing with except for the wire nest.

This is the kind of stuff an artist would look out for. I would summarize
this pic as &quot;Low Visual Fidelity&quot;. Alot of pixelated &quot;noise&quot;.

Of course, but I think that if a converted picture is better in quality then
it's good as it shows capabilities of the c64 better than a painted one.
Don't you think?

Hello. Yes I checked them on my c64 and they look good.. some flickering but
not too much... I can send you the .d64 of the files if you want. I noticed
the ones that don't look good are the ones with a lot of white as they
flicker too much..

A painted/pixelled pic is always preferred because it shows the artist's
capabilities. Converting someone else's pic is not art and will be judged
with negative points on demo charts.

Demos are not, especially the gfx art of a &quot;graphician&quot;, about the technical
capability of the C64. It is more than that. That is a part in regards to
how you can put together a demo but it is the WHOLE composition that
matters.

It is like music. You can have a simple band of two guitars players, a
drummer, and a lead vocal and backup vocal OR you can have a sophisticated
group of people including the above but also containing people of a variety
of instruments. Music isn't about the technical capability of the
instrument. It is about the composition. How you use the techniques,
technical capability, and all. This is artistry. Something that can not be
vulcanized to pure logic.

Quite often the painted work has a balanced beauty that far outweighes a
converted pic when it comes to the whole composition. It is how you use the
stuff. Too much pixelated noise and people lose grasp to what the content
is. It isn't about - lets convert a JPEG from the PC and display it.

There is more to demo making and more to consider. Contrast, clarity,
balance, smoothness and many more aspects when judging different aspects of
the demo.

Coders have their benchmark on code. Gfxians have their benchmark stemming
from classic fine art benchmarks standards of form. Even in animated form.

Importances lies in much more than mere technical capabities.

You need to work it on both ends of conversion. First, with lack of cell
attribute limitations on the PC - you can simply over do it. In practice,
complex gfx doesn't come across as clean and sharp as a more simplistic
image.

You have too much artifact and low fidelit of the pics. I have done
conversions before and even with some of the best tools out there. The
problem is that the conversion gives you a crappy representation of the nice
pic you made on the PC (especially if you have lots of colors in an 8x8 area
throughout the entire pic (not to mention many colors that the C64 doesn't
have).

Usually, you get better and cleaner pics that is nicely done. To many
degree, it becomes an arbitrary purpose to choose colors the way it is done.
That is art. You know the limitations of the hardware and video modes SO you
work with it. This isn't about trying to display photos. Demos are not a
photo slideshow. If you don't get it, then you are stupid and should stay on
the PC and leave the sceners alone who are actually contributing and in many
regards is real art. Deekay is a fellow gfxian that creates art on the C64
for the C64. So it is in the testiment of his artistic skill in pixelling
that he can achieve such lifelike yet it was all pixeled/painted in.

I don't think he gets it. So here is an example of a pic that I was working
on, (it is NOT complete) and this is a conversion base with a little bit of
pixeling modification.

URL: http://www.geocities.com/wildstar128/phoenix0002.png

Certainly, it is a bit too pixelated. The background image which was based
on a very high resolution (compared to normal C64 stuff) art work that I did
for an art class. It looses alot of it's original content. So I have to
alter it later on the C64 side because it gives an interesting background.
So to keep the background - I arbitrarily do a little bit of outlining of
the phoenix to give it a little bit of contrasting to pull it out from the
background.

I believe this is an FLI (not IFLI)

In this stage of the photo, I was doing a little bit of arbitrary outling of
the phoenix (in the preconversion original image) so it saves me a little
bit of work afterwards. Later I would work on the hillside a bit in the
background to regain definition. There would also be some work on the feet
(like the beak and eye).

You can see where I was heading with this.

I arbitrarily worked it so I also had 3 black colums on the right to balance
the columns on the left (FLI thinggy)

This could be an interesting pic when finished.

Yes I do get the point as I used to be a grafician for ZD on Amiga back in
the days.

Good then. You should not just do raw conversion. There is this one thing
that you should keep in mind, fidelity. (How clean the content of the image
is. The objects from the background.) I'm not saying conversion is bad. Just
raw conversion unless you have a real nice day and a luck that the original
image isn't too complicated to begin with. The more cleaner it is and the
mere luck that you don't exceed the charater cell attribute limitations -
great.

So in my opinion, there is some cleanup work that you have to do on most
conversion jobs to hold up to the standards because that is what the best
graphicians do.

If you work on the images that you have a little more and take some of the
advices (points that I given) as well as observing what the other
graphicians do - like Deekay to make their just clear - you got something.

As for your original question: this is up to you. I wouldn't mind both. But
you need to work on the converted pics a little bit on the C64 (clean up) by
working it on the C64 side (or emulator) or a cross-platform graphic editor
that edits 'native C64 graphic formats'.

You have some more work to do than just converting. That is what we are
saying. Painted work can be just as good as converted work or most cases
better than raw conversions. Work that has been refined (Post-conversion
refinement - pixelling a little to clean up) - can be equal.

Painted work (Pixeled work) shows the artist's talent within the C64.
Converted work could easily be stealing something on the web or on the PC
from somewhere and converting it. If you actually make the original pic,
then I don't see any problems.

Anyway, good luck and keep working on your conversions (but do some
refinement work - pixelling)
