&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Why do you assume separate has more effect than not?
&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't think I assume separate has MORE effect but it can be different
&gt; &gt;&gt; in that the mother may actually be doing something physical which the
&gt; &gt;&gt; child can consciously remember.
&gt; &gt;How much can you consciously remember?
&gt; Quite a lot.  Some people can - some people can't.  I can remember
&gt; particularly two events (one when I was very little - about 18 months)
">

Two events well that explains your complete understanding of your
entire
psyche.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; which triggered a deep insecurity.  To an external observer these would
&gt; have been very minor events.
">

Irrelevent, it is the child that matters not what others think.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Now, you can say that this was going to be
&gt; triggered anyway but if my parents had been aware of my perceptions they
&gt; may have been able to deal with the event differently (since I am sure
&gt; that they did not mean to be unkind)
">

Yes, this is why it is important to know ourselves-not just for us but
for the sake of understanding others, but if you don't understand
yourself you can't understand others.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Since when do early environmental
&gt; &gt;belief schemas have to be CONCIOUS? The UNCONSCIOUS is a far larger bank
&gt; &gt;of psychic material.
&gt; I know - that was not what I said.
&gt; &gt; The conscious mind and ego BY DEFINITION are an
&gt; &gt;aspect of FOCUS. A narrow experience of physicality at the exclusion of
&gt; &gt;the conscious apprehension of the &quot;other&quot; banks of psychic material. A
&gt; &gt;flashlight shone in one corner of a dark room does not extinguish the
&gt; &gt;rest of the room-we just can't SEE it. This is WHY persons have such
&gt; &gt;difficulty seeing how &quot;they&quot; create their reality, because they
&gt; &gt;&quot;believe&quot; that the self they experience in the conscious state is ALL
&gt; &gt;they are and that ALL they can remember is ALL they are. But astrology
&gt; &gt;shows us that the corraborations are there REGARDLESS of whether you
&gt; &gt;have conscious access to the psychic material that creates your reality
&gt; &gt;or not.
&gt; &gt;This is why in consultation I can pinpoint where these schemas were
&gt; &gt;triggered (because they &quot;actually&quot; exist AT birth and are CATALYSED by
&gt; &gt;experience) by solar arcs, secondaries or Saturn quadratures etc.
&gt; I agree with you BUT half of what my last post was about is there is no
&gt; point in telling people this - particularly in one consultation of a
&gt; couple of hours - because they won't be able to absorb it.
">

The point is not always to give some conscious recitition of facts but
to TRIGGER aspects of the psyche into developmental awareness. A
chiropractor doesn't have to explain every bone he's readjusting and
how
the whole thing works in order for effect to take place now does
he/she?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  There is no
&gt; advantage in blasting people with theories they don't understand because
&gt; they won't get anything out of it.
">

Duh, you are as bad as the cynics with this begging the question
fallaciousness. Yes I blast all clients that come in immediately
yelling
and screaming for them to SIT DOWN!! Etc. What do you think I am some
idiot?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You can say the same about the archetypes evident on the chart.  There
&gt; are often posts about people being born at the same time being different
&gt; - but my feeling is that archetypes are triggered by the 'nurture'
&gt; factor and you will never *really* know what this until you question the
&gt; client.
">

Of course, but the point is to get empathic understanding before they
get there as much as possible-otherwise you are just doing
psychology-why have a chart?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  ALTHOUGH the chart shows perceptions and ALTHOUGH you can see
&gt; the clients unconscious beliefs, I still say these can be modified by
&gt; the outside influences of carers.
">

It is not an outside influence even then-it is their CHOICE of
probabilities-we went all over this in "Time Tracks" remember?
You always fall back on the same things weve discussed over and over
with the same lame assertions about what I am-when I already expalined
and expolored this already.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I do not do charts for babies but I know someone who does and she spends
&gt; quite a lot of time talking to the parents about this.
">

Only can deal with probabilities-but we know those developmental times
WILL BE. I have followed my sons since birth and what was in that
HAllway as I saw it at the hospital at birth HAVE COME TO PASS.
I knew I would divorce BECAUSE of his birthchart as soon as I saw it,
because I saw his parental issues WITH THAT, and therefore knew.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt;  I think possibly these are things which
&gt; &gt;&gt; are easier to deal with in a counselling context because the child has a
&gt; &gt;&gt; concrete reason for the way he is and not just some vague, causeless
&gt; &gt;&gt; feeling.
&gt; &gt;A feeling is a reaction to a belief. No one EVER just &quot;feels&quot; someway
&gt; &gt;without first having a belief about it. But yes, cognitive psychology
&gt; &gt;works on this principle. It must be incorporated into the counseling
&gt; &gt;process.
&gt; &gt;&gt;  It is often a comfort to people to know where the feeling
&gt; &gt;&gt; comes from and I think possibly it does more psychological damage if
&gt; &gt;BELIEF comes from. Them.
&gt; Yes - I KNOW it does - but the parents also have beliefs and we are
&gt; talking about a relationship here (and I know they are supposed to have
&gt; chosen their parents but that is totally irrelevant to most counselling
&gt; situations.)
">

So is what their parents believe-it is theirs we are concerned with.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt;you
&gt; &gt;&gt; can't find a cause - because a perception has to be brought into
&gt; &gt;&gt; consciousness before it can be changed.
&gt; &gt;A perception is the EFFECT of ones consciousness.
&gt; &gt;This I have stated throughout my writings-&quot;you cannot change something
&gt; &gt;you don't own.&quot;
&gt; EXACTLY!  What I am trying to say to you is there is absolutely NO point
&gt; in *telling* people what is wrong with them because they will just argue
&gt; with you. (in the same way they do in this NG)
">

You are incredibly insulting. I don't tell clients whats "wrong" with
them Ms Judgment head. Who would know better-the clients who cry and
hug
me after consultation and know we have made changes in their
consciousness-the persons who know me personally here, or you and your
conSISTANT hard headed projections of what you THINK I am across the
ocean there???
This will be the last time I answer you until you stop this assertion
crap and helping the cynics demonize me because of your own
limitations-I DO NOT need to be taught by you. Counsel does NOT equal
newsgroup. The fact that you parallel the two is the height of inanity.

Please take stock and reread this garbage.
SNIP!

I think there's been a shortage of illegal alien workers for the last five
years that'll take Edmo's book as payment.
