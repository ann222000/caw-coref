I've never had a website, btw. Almost no one did when I sold my company
in 1999 'cuz it cost too much then, and I haven't needed one since.

Hello Peggy,

Thank you for answering my distress call....

We have been treating our holding tank with Raritan K.O. for the past 6
months... but have not used the head much until summer finally kicked in.
Unfortunately, stinky gasses are coming out of the vent whenever we pump....

The vent and vent hose seem clear - since the gases come out - but perhaps
the bacteria died over the winter (I know I would if I had to live in the
holding tank :-) - but perhaps stronger measures are called for.

What I have in mind is to install a small aerorater pump of the type that
sends the airflow through a pipe to the bortom of the tank -  but I have
heard that they can be quite noisy - sort of like an aquarium pump. So I am
wondering if you have any recommendations for a quiet pump of that type?

Secondly, if the pump does the job - and the bacteria turns the tanks
contents into water and CO2 - would that then qualify as treated waste that
could be released through the boat's macerator into the environment ?

What say you, wise Peggy?

Cheers,
Claus

If you haven't added any K.O. to th tank since last fall, yes...the
bacteria died. You should have thoroughly rinsed out the tank before
storing for the winter.  The bacteria in K.O. are like any other living
organism...they need food to survive. So they'll die if they exhaust
their food source (nutrients in waste) while the boat sits for an
extended period.

So before you resort to more drastic measures, pump out and thoroughly
rinse out the tank...and also backflush the vent line to make sure it's
clear. Then restart it with a fresh dose of K.O. If you do this right
before the boat will sit, add a couple more ounces of K.O. with the
first flush after you return to the boat.

If you still have odor, it's because your tank isn't sufficiently well
ventilated to allow the bacteria in K.O. to function aerobically.
Odorlos is another non-chemical product that often works in tanks that
K.O. can't...so try it ACCORDING TO DIRECTIONS!!! before doing any
surgery on the system.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's no guarantee that it isn't at least partially blocked. Tank vents
require maintenance. Check the thru-hull regularly...scrape out anything
you find...and backflush it every time you pump out and/or wash the boat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Of course it did...it starved to death.  And it may have died in the
bottle if you stored it where it could freeze or where temps went over
110 F.

- but perhaps stronger measures are called for.

Or at least reading the directions on the bottle of K.O. :)

Aeration isn't quite that simple...there's a bit more engineering to it
than most people realize. The piping in the tank has to be able to
distribute air across the entire bottom of the tank, and it has to be
designed to prevent becoming clogged by sludge...and the pump has to run
24/7/365 to keep the tank odor free.

No. There is nothing that can be added to a tank that will make it legal
to dump the tank inside the &quot;3 mile limit.&quot;  Nor does just passing
through a tank discharge macerator pump have time to macerate to the
legal standard.  ONLY waste that is treated by a CG certified Type I or
II MSD and discharged directly overboard from the device is &quot;treated
waste.&quot;  It's not even legal to dump a tank full of waste that was
treated by Type I or II before it went into the tank...'cuz once it goes
into a tank, it's no longer considered &quot;treated waste.&quot;  Reason: the
treatment device may kill almost all the bacteria, but only one of the
li'l buggers has to survive to quickly multiply into zillions in the tank.

At least a year if it's not exposed to temps above 110 or below 40 F. It
should be fine stored anywhere on a boat except during winter
storage...or as long as it wasn't left in a dock locker exposed to the
sun or anywhere else where solar heat can &quot;cook&quot; it.

Peggie:

I have a follow up comment/question - the tank's 3/4&quot; vent hose on our boat
goes from the top of  of the holding tank through the side of the boat above
the deck. It terminates in a small chrome &quot;mushroom&quot; with two small holes. I
cannot figure out how to get a good backflush going through the small
openings... is there some kind of tool or adapter available for this purpose
or what am I missing???
Claus

P.S.
After emptying, rinsing etc. of the tank and applying a dose of Oderlos
(what a bizarre moniker, unless you are norwegian) the odor is gone - hope
it lasts until the next pump-out!

If it were my boat, I'd replace the thru-hull with an open bulkhead
fitting and--if heeling puts it under water--clamshell over it.

If you expect to without adding more, you didn't read ALL the
directions....'cuz it won't. Odorlos isn't a live bacteria product that
contines to renew itself by multiplying...the active ingredient in it is
nitrates, which exhaust themselves in  about a week, So to keep it
working, more must be added. It's especially important after the boat
sits for several days--even if you pumped out and added it last thing
before leaving the boat, that you add again with the first flush when
you come aboard.

Peggie, when I search of an &quot;open bulkhead fitting&quot; on WestMarine
website, nothing shows up.  I too have the fitting with two small
holes on the hull of my Pearson. it is heavily corroded so i assume it
is the source of the most foul smell I hav when pumping my new Lavac.
Can you be more descriptive of what this fitting it?

thanks

Come on, Ed...surely you have more imagination than that (I hope!)! It
never occurred to you to try just &quot;bulkhead fitting?&quot;  Or, since you're
looking for a type of thru-hull, &quot;through hull&quot;... or &quot;thru hull?&quot;  WM
was the only site you searched...you didn't try any other marine
retailers?

I guarantee you'll find plenty of 'em if you put a bit more thought into
your search. I just found a zillion of 'em in all sizes and materials on
the Defender site http://www.defender.com . And a google search turned up
a zillion more on non-marine sites.

Nylon is ok for the new fitting on the tank, but go with stainless or
bronze for the thru-hull. As for what size you need, I'm not sure
whether the nominal size for fittings is the OD or ID, so you'll need to
ask to make sure you get the right size to fit into a 1&quot; hose.
