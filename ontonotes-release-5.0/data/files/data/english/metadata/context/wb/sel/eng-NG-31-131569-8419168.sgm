&quot;There is something in my house, my house..
It's just the Ghost of the Love that was never there
There is something in my house..But you're not there..&quot;  - Nick Sayer

I've seen Orion but it wasn't the beauty of it that amused me, but its
pure and simple innocence.  I've seen battleships glaze the sky and
crash into the horizon.. There are times I wondered if I was in Love
with those I would light candles with.  And to blow it out on my
birthday with those I trusted.  But only a few will enter.. And I am
waiting here with open arms.  You don't need to be somebody.. You
could just be another one.. And in deperfection my love grew
stronger.. Until I realized that the world of success doesn't lead to
something kind and it won't matter to anyone if you fell in the
gutter.  There's nothing here if there's no one to hold.. absolutely
nothing here.. So what will I do now?  At 3o'clock in the morning I'll
run to ground like a bang and a clatter.. an angel that ran to
ground..  You know my weaknesses.  I'm not an idol.. And I've got not
much to offer.. You could say I'm dealing with the limits.. But there
was something in my house.. It was the Phantom Bride that is in my
house.  I think it wise for you to patch up your indifferences with
your cousin and form a friendship that's more than just a man and his
idol..
