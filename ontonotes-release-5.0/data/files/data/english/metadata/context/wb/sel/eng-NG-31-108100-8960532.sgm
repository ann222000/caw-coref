WASHINGTON—Conservatives claim to be in favor of stable
families, small businesses, hard work, private schools,
investment and homeownership. So why in the world are so many on
the right attacking the family of Graeme Frost?

Graeme is the 12-year-old from Baltimore who delivered the
Democrats’ reply to a radio address by President Bush in
September. The seventh-grader pleaded—in vain, it turned
out—that the president not veto Congress’ $35-billion expansion
of the children’s health care program known as SCHIP. A car
crash in December 2004 left two of Halsey and Bonnie Frost’s
children comatose, Graeme with a brain stem injury and Gemma,
his sister, with a cranial fracture.

The kids were treated, thanks to SCHIP. The Frosts spoke out so
the public would know that real people lie behind the acronym.

Their reward was to be trashed on right-wing blogs and talk
radio as if they were multimillionaires ripping off the system.
The assault on the Frosts apparently began on the Free Republic
Web site and quickly spread to National Review Online, Power
Line and Michelle Malkin’s blog, as well as Rush Limbaugh’s
radio show.

And of what were the Frosts guilty? Well, they own their own
home, which they bought for $55,000 in 1990 and is now worth
about $260,000; they invested in a commercial property, valued
at $160,000; Halsey Frost, a self-employed woodworker, once
owned a small business that was dissolved in 1999; and Graeme
attends a private school on scholarship. I rely here on facts
reported this week in The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times,
both of which set straight the more outlandish claims made by
the Frosts’ attackers.

The right is unapologetic. “The Democrats chose to outsource
their airtime to a seventh-grader,” wrote National Review’s Mark
Steyn. “If a political party is desperate enough to send a boy
to do a man’s job, then the boy is fair game.”

OK, the Democrats are “fair game,” but a 12-year-old? No wonder
nobody talks about compassionate conservatism anymore.

As a general rule, I am a fan of the blogosphere. It has
broadened the public debate and brought new people into
politics. And nasty stuff is by no means limited to the right-
wing blogs. Left-of-center blogs whose political views I largely
share have published offensive stuff, too. Shaun Mullen, who
blogs at The Moderate Voice—yes, there are moderate blogs—is
right to generalize when he says that the targeting of the Frost
family reveals “the vicious underbelly of the blogosphere.”

So rather than just condemn the right-wingers as meanies, let’s
take their claims seriously. Doing so makes clear that they are
engaged in a truly perverse and incoherent form of class warfare.

The left is accused of all manner of sins related to
covetousness and envy whenever it raises questions about who
benefits from President Bush’s tax cuts and mentions the yachts
such folks might buy or the mansions they might own. But here is
a family with modest possessions doing everything conservatives
tell people they should do, and the right trashes them for
getting help to buy health insurance for their children.

Most conservatives favor government-supported vouchers that
would help Graeme attend his private school, but here they turn
around and criticize him for ... attending a private school.
Federal money for private schools but not for health insurance?
What’s the logic here?

Conservatives endlessly praise risk-taking by entrepreneurs and
would give big tax cuts to those who are most successful. But if
a small-business person is struggling, he shouldn’t even think
about applying for SCHIP.

Conservatives who want to repeal the estate tax on large
fortunes have cited stories—most of them never check out—about
farmers having to sell their farms to pay inheritance taxes. But
the implication of these attacks on the Frosts is that they are
expected to sell their investment property to pay for health
care. Why?

Oh, yes, and conservatives tell us how much they love
homeownership, and then assail the Frosts for having the nerve
to own a home. I suppose they should have to sell that, too.

The real issue here is whether uninsured families with earnings
similar to the Frosts’ need government help to buy health
coverage. With the average family policy in employer-provided
plans now costing more than $12,000 annually—the price is
usually higher for families trying to buy it on their own—the
answer is plainly yes. All the conservative attacks on a boy
from Baltimore who dared to speak out will not make this issue
go away.

Good post Frank.  With the assets the family seems to have why do they

Why? Because the boy's parents allowed him to be used as a pawn and
political tool for the Democrats who are waging another sleazy and
deceitful campaign against the Bush administration. (For the record,
I'm not a fan of George Bush, just a fiscal conservative)

Since the Dems healthcare proposal calls for coverage of children up
to the age of 25, why didn't they instead find a healthy 25 year old
to pose as their poster boy?

Hey Cecil how ya doing?

The, &quot;it's for the children&quot; ploy, seems to be a consistent strategy used by
the proponets to create a national health care system by stealth.

This health care issue is going to dog us for a long time. I have yet to see
a comprehensive objective nonpartisan study that breaks down the cost of
health care and how costs are determined. This would be an all inclusive
report, that would include salaries, building costs, rents, equipment costs,
janitors, paper work, education, insurance, government mandates, etc and the
percentage that these items contribute to the total cost. Right now I don't
know. I know some of the usual suspects, but the devils in the details.

While &quot;it's for the children&quot; is part of the ploy (and usually the part I
find most objectionable), it's not the worst part this item.  The reason
they chose a 12 year old is because no one is allowed to criticize him.  He
is the most recent of the spokes-people chosen by the Dems specifically
because they are &quot;beyond criticism.&quot;

They made a celebrity of Cindy Sheehan because as a mother who lost a son to
war, no one was allowed to criticize her - after all, she is a poor grieving
mother.

The New Jersey wives of firemen lost in the 9-11 attacks were used to
criticize the war solely because no one was allowed to criticize them in
return - after all, they were poor defenseless widows.

Now, they bring in a &quot;sick&quot; 12 year old &quot;saved&quot; by government health care -
and again no one is allowed to criticize either the dems, or the boy, simply
because he is a &quot;sick child.&quot;  In this case, &quot;sick&quot; is a perfect description
of the Democrat party.

We already have a national health care system.  The problems with it
are 1) it's far more expensive than ones that provide better health
care, and 2) it leaves a lot of people uncovered.

Actually, the &quot;it's the children&quot; ploy is used far more often by the
religious right for their nefarious purposes.

You'd never make it as a CPA.  You want barrels of details to argue
over, but you don't want to compare bottom lines.  Above all, you
don't want to compare costs versus results.

France has the best health care system in the world.  The US is
something like 43rd.  Yet France spends far less per person, to be the
best, than the United States spends to be 43rd.

Having used both systems, I can confirm that the French system is far
better, far more convenient, and far LESS expensive.  They've cut out
almost all of the money wasters and gone for high quality.

The US should survey those 42 nations that do better than we do, and
copy the best features of each.  That means starting with the French
system, and correcting its (very few) weaknesses.

Why do you take an attitude like this? Jenny points out a stark truth
and you bs your way right around it. Your example is really stupid
Linus. If the U.S. were faced with a similar emergency we'd falter also
so what's your &quot;point&quot;.

If you have some details of the faults in the French health system lets
hear them. Rather than dribble all over her words with bs, why not
discuss your reasons for dissing them?

Jenny might find her treatment different now.

&quot;But in September 2007, this all changed. At the same time she was
diagnosed with bowel cancer, the French government announced that in
accordance with EU law, it would no longer allow early retirees from
other EU countries to have access to the French healthcare system.
Instead, they would have to take out private health insurance. Plus the
legislation is to be retrospective so the rules apply to early retirees

as devastating as her medical diagnosis. 'It's a double whammy that has

so not only will private health insurance premiums be extraordinarily

accept her anyway because even with high premiums the cost of her
treatment is likely to be greater that what she pays in. This means that
if she stays in France Pat will have to fund the entire cost of her

There may be some use in comparing the French health system to that of the

population is approaching 300 million, not counting the 1/2 billion
illegals(maybe a slight exaggeration) so what might work for France, might
not work for the US.

That may well be true for you, but in my case health care insurance is free

As usual, Linus is right and you are lying.

(CBS/AP) The death toll in France from August's blistering heat wave has
reached nearly 15,000, according to a government-commissioned report
released Thursday, surpassing a prior tally by more than 3,000.

A study by scientists at INSERM, the National Institute of Health and
Medical Research, determined that 14,802 people had died in August.

The toll exceeds the prior government count of 11,435, a figure that was
based only on deaths in the first two weeks of the month.

The country's largest undertaker had said earlier this month it thought
the death toll was closer to 15,000 than the government was admitting.

The government's new estimate includes deaths from the second half of
August, after the record-breaking temperatures of the first half of the
month had abated.

The new estimate comes a day after the French Parliament released a
harshly worded report blaming the deaths on a complex health system,
widespread failure among agencies and health services to coordinate
efforts, and chronically insufficient care for the elderly.

Earlier this month, the government commission recommended better
coordination between health bodies in the future, reports CBS News
Correspondent Elaine Cobbe, saying thousands of lives could have been
saved if the alarm had been raised sooner.
*****************
But most of the top health officials were on vacation, and the
government report says that also partly explains why the alarm wasn't
raised sooner.
***************
Local authorities in Paris are now reviewing plans for more home visits
for the elderly during holiday and vacation times, reports Cobbe.

The heat wave swept across much of Europe, but the death toll was far
higher in France than in any other country.

Health Minister Jean-Francois Mattei has ordered a separate special
study this month to look into a possible link with vacation schedules
after doctors strongly denied allegations their absence put the elderly
in danger. The heat wave hit during the August vacation period, when
doctors, hospital staff and many others take leave. The results of that
study are expected in November.

The role of vacations is a touchy subject. The National General
Practitioners Union says that only about 20 percent of general
practitioners were away during the heat wave.

Listen up here for a minute.  Jenny says she was treated in France once
(zero details) and therefore France has the world's best medical system
and ours is piss-poor.

Jenny has a solid reputation for bad-mouthing the USA at every opportunity.

I've been in France on several occasions and I was less then impressed.
I also keep an ear to the ground for rumbles of discontent and I know
there have been many about the way the French medical system treats its
patients (especially the elderly).

I did not just fall off the turnip truck so I don't buy her version of
what constitutes great medical care.  When world figures need treatment,
they flock to the Mayo clinic, I haven't seen a similar stampede to France.

She's going to have to come in with medical experts that have a
reputation as knowledgeable in the field in order to bolster her case.

Until then, her credibility is below my radar.

Check out some of the major _wide_area_ heat waves back in the 1930s.

Chicago, 1995, had over 500 deaths -- in 5 days -- in the city itself. on a
population of maybe 3 million.   &quot;normal&quot; for a _year_ is something like 15.

In Chicago, there were a number of reasons given for the high number of
deaths.

Too many medical workers on vacation was not one of them, as was found
to be a MAJOR contributing factor in France.

You guys are a fricken hoot. Anybody or any organization that doesn't
agree with your warped point of view is BAAAAD. The UN may be flawed but
withdrawing from it is not the answer. We chose to not back the League
of Nations and you know the result of that. We can't, I'll repeat, we
can't go it alone today or ever. While folks like you are battling
windmills, Putin is over in Iran making chummy with the Nut. China is
making hay against our support for the dissidents in Burma. China is
pissed because we gave audience to the Dalia Lama. Putin is building up
his military and he is most likely to side with China in a conflict.

Onadesdays, the shits gonna hit the fan and you guys will be shaking
your heads wondering whatinhell happened. History repeats itself and the
folks with their heads up their ass will always prevail. Funny thing is,
when the fan spreads the shit over all, they will blame it on those who
had nothing to do with the mess.

And another thing. I'm sitting here watching crude go awfully close to
$90/barrel and now $100/barrel does not seem at all unlikely. This makes
it entirely possible we'll see $4/gallon gas prices with a similar spike
in fuel oil and diesel.

Part of the many &quot;reasons&quot; we went into Iraq was the claim we'd
stabilize oil prices and darn near guarantee less expensive fuel. I'm
wondering how that works for you guys. Those with sufficient funds to
spend may not suffer much but how about the huge number of folks driving
the economy, you know, the guy working a regular job just getting by.
High fuel prices equate to more than just higher pump costs, they equate
to increased shipping costs, increased air fares, much higher food
prices. that same segment of the population is the goose that lays the
golden eggs and we're trying our damnedest to kill it.

Plus, so many folks are tied to these same people's spending habits by
their income. Income that comes from investments. What do you think will
happen when folks see their income shrink due to less spending by the
masses forcing the stock prices down. You need to look back in history
to see the results of that.

We've got a President and a Congress with their collective heads up
their ass. Their so involved in this stupid hate the other guy war they
aren't tending to business. All the pie in the sky talk about
alternative energy is just that, talk. We can't get any of the plans on
stream in time to stop the economy slide that's sure to come with
$100/barrel oil.

But then, that won't stop you guys from your &quot;opposition&quot;. Jenny might
be a &quot;bare ass&quot; endorser but from her posts it looks like she has more
experience in French health care than you Linus. That won't stop you

You finally, after all these spews, got one right. Withdrawing isn't the
answer. We should withdraw, withdraw all funds, give all UN ambassadors
3 hours to get out of the country, and then level the freaking building,
complete with all of the spy bullshit it houses.

The UN is merely a means of gathering together all of the worlds most
evil men, so they can conspire against us. Only fools and damn fools
would support, let alone FUND such an organization.

&gt;&gt; Tell us the truth now.  No waffling or bullshit.

&gt; I read somewhere that the French have the world's most experienced

The country has a high
unemployment rate of 9 percent along with high taxes. In France, taxes
amount
to more than 44 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 26
percent in
the United States, according to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and
Development.

Looks like tax collecting is a major industry in France too.

What's dishonest about telling the truth?  Are you trying to tell me you
don't remember any of the reasons the administration used for the
invasion? Are you trying to make a case for just Saddam's weapons of
mass destruction being the only reason for said invasion? Are you trying
to tell me no one in the Bush administration made the case for cheap
oil? Are you trying to tell me stabilization of Iraqi oil production
wasn't mentioned by any of said administration folk?

Cheney and crew made one helluvacase to Bush, enough of a case to prompt
him to go against his pledge to not be a nation builder. Bush didn't
need much persuasion but Cheney made damn sure there was no possibility
he wouldn't buy in.
