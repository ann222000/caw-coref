Or, The Book of The Farts, in plain English. I see many new quitters
thirst for scientific information related to the Flatulence Phase.

So here you go!

THE ANTICIPATED FART: This one warns that it is back there waiting for
some time before it arrives. A person who is uneasy for a time in a
crowd and who later farts at a time when they think no one will notice
has farted an Anticipated Fart.

THE BACK SEAT FART: This is a fart that occurs only in cars. It
is identified chiefly by odour. The Back Seat Fart can usually be
concealed by traffic noise as it is an eased-out fart and not very
loud.
But its odour is foul, will give it away, due to the way air moves
around in a car. And then someone will say, who farted in the back
seat?

THE BARRED OWL FART: A familiarity with owl calls is helpful in
identifying this fart. Almost any morning if you get up just before
daybreak you can hear one of these birds talking to himself. It's a
sort of a crazy laugh, particularly the way it ends. If you hear a
fart that has about eight notes in it, ending on a couple of down
notes, and it sounds maniacal, you have heard the rare Barred Owl
Fart.

THE BULLET FART: Its single and most pronounced diagnostic
characteristic is its sound. It sounds like a rifle shot. The farter
can be said to have snapped it off. It can startle spectators and
farter alike. Fairly common following the eating of the more common
fart foods, such as beans.

THE COMMAND FART: This fart differs from the Anticipated Fart in that
it can be held for long periods of time waiting for the right moment.
Unlike the Anticipated Fart, it is intended to be noticed. Harold
Tabor recently held a Command Fart for the whole period in history
class and let it go right at the end when the teacher asked if there
were any questions.

THE COMMON FART: This fart needs little description. It is to the
world of farts what the house sparrow is to the world of birds. I can
see no point in describing this far any further.

THE CUSHIONED FART: A concealed fart, sometimes successful. The farter
is usually on the fat side, sometimes a girl. They will squirm and
push their butt way down into the cushions of a sofa or over-stuffed
chair and ease-out a fart very carefully without moving then or for
some time after. Some odour may escape, but usually not much. Common
with some people.

THE DUD FART: The Dud Fart is not really a fart at all. It's a fart
that fails. For this reason it is strictly a group one identification
fart, because there is no real way you can identify a fart that
somebody else expected to fart but didn't. It is the most private of
all farts. In most cases the farter usually feels a little
disappointed.

THE ECHO FART: This is a fart that can be wrongly identified. It is
not some great loud fart in an empty gym or on the rim of the Grand
Canyon. The true Echo Fart is a fart that makes its own echo. It is a
two-toned fart, the first tone loud, then a pause, and then the second
tone. Like an echo.

THE G AND L FART: This is one of the most ordinary and pedestrian of
farts, known to everyone. Certainly it is the least gross. If you have
not already guessed, G and L stands for Gambled and Lost. One of the
most embarrassing of all farts, even when you are alone.

THE GHOST FART: A doubtful fart in most cases, as it is supposed to
be identified by odour alone and to occur, for instance, in an empty
house. You enter and smell a fart, yet no one is there. People will
insist that only a fart could have that odour, but some believe it is
just something that happens to smell like a fart.

THE HIC-HACHOO-FART FART: This is strictly an old lady's fart. What
happens is that the person manages to hiccough, sneeze, and fart all
at the same time. After an old lady farts a Hic-Hachoo-Fart Fart she
will usually pat her chest and say, &quot;My, my&quot;, or &quot;Well, well&quot;. There
is no reason she should not be proud, as this is probably as neat an
old person's fart as there is.

THE JERK FART: The Jerk Fart is a fart by a jerk who smirks, smiles,
grins, and points to himself in case you missed it. It is usually a
single-noted, off-key, fading away, sort of whistle fart, altogether
pitiful, but the jerk will act as if he has just farted the Biggest
Fart in the World Fart.

THE JOHN FART: The John Fart is simply any ordinary fart farted on the
john. It is naturally a group one identification, with the wound,
whatever it was, somewhat muffled. If it is all the person's trip to
the john amounted to he will be disappointed for sure. Common as
pigeons.

THE LEAD FART: The heaviest of all farts. It sounds like a dropped
ripe watermelon. Or a falling body in some cases. It is the only fart
that goes thud. Except for the odour, which is also very heavy, it
could be missed altogether as a far. What was that, you might think?
And never guess.

THE MALTED MILK BALL FART: Odour alone is diagnostic and positively
identifies this fart. It smells exactly like malted milk balls.
No other food works this way. It is rare.

THE OMEN FART: This is the adult version of the Poo-Poo Fart. About
the only difference is that the farter will not say anything. He will
just look kind of funny and head for the john. This one is easy to
spot if you pay attention.

THE ORGANIC FART: Sometimes called the Health Food Nut Fart. The
person who farts an Organic Fart may be talking about the healthy food
he eats even when he farts. If he is heavily into health foods he may
even ask if you noticed how good and pure and health his fart smells.
It may smell to you like any other fart, but there is no harm in
agreeing with him. He is doing what he thinks is best.

THE QUIVER FART: A group one identification fart only. When you
fart, it quivers. If it tickles, then it is the Tickle Fart. If you
have to scratch it, then it is the Scratarse Fart.

THE RAMBLING PHADUKA FART: You must not be fooled by its
pretty-sounding name, as this is one of the most frightening of all
farts. It is frightening to farter and spectator alike. It has a
sound of pain to it. What is most diagnostic about it, however, is
its length. It is the longest-lasting fart there is. It will
sometimes leave the farter unable to speak. As though he has had the
wind knocked out of him. A strong, loud, wavering fart, it goes on for
at least fifteen seconds.

THE RELIEF FART: Sound or odour don't matter on this one. What matters
is the tremendous sense of relief that you have finally farted.
Some people will even say, &quot;Wow, what a relief&quot;. Very common.

THE RELUCTANT FART: This is probably one of the oldest farts known
to man. The Reluctant Fart is a fart that seems to have a mind of
its own. It gives the impression that it likes staying where it is.
It will come when it is ready, not before. This can take half-a-day
in some instances.

THE RUSTY GATE FART: The sound of this fart seems almost impossible
for a fart. Is is the most dry and squeaky sound a fart can make.
The Rusty Gate Fart sounds as if it would have worked a lot easier
if it had been oiled. It sounds like a fart that hurts.

THE S.B.D. FART: S.B.D. stands for Silent But Deadly. This is no
doubt one of the most common farts that exists. No problem of
identification with this one.

THE SANDPAPER FART: This one scratches. Otherwise it may not
amount to much. You should remember that if you reach back and
scratch, it automatically becomes a Scratcharse Fart. Common.

THE JIGSAW FART: A truly awesome fart. It vibrates the farter.
Really shakes him up. People back away. It sounds like an electric
jigsaw ripping through a piece of half-inch plywood. Very
impressive. Not too common.

THE SONIC BOOM FART: The people who believe in this fart claim
it is even bigger than the Biggest Fart In The World Fart. The
Sonic Boom Fart is supposed to shake the house and rattle the windows.
This is ridiculous. No fart in the world shakes houses and rattles
windows. A fart that could do that would put the farter into orbit or
blow his head off.

THE SPLATTER FART: Unfortunately the Splatter Fart exists. It
is the wettest of all farts. It probably should not be called a
fart at all.

THE TEFLON FART: Slips out without a sound and no strain at all.
A very good fart in situations where you would rather not fart at all.
You can be talking to someone and not miss saying a word. If the wind
is right he will never know.
