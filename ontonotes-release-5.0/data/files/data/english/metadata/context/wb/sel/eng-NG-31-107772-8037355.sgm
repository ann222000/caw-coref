I noticed a link in a search engine recently, it was asking, what's
the best way for a thirteen year old to commit suicide? I never looked
at the link but it's a terrible shame to notice this sitting there so
blatantly openly on show and I wondered if that child's parents knew
what this child was up to online. Let alone that this was how the
child felt, and more so why or that the child even felt this way?

It should be made illegal globally to display anything like that on
any web site or search engine. Why? Well I've seen countless web sites
where the members coax people to commit suicide live on camera. And
they then use that video as a snuff video, which is illegal in endless
global countries? There was a documentary I once watched about this
very topic, and those who had watched someone take their life were not
even finally charged with any crime. ISP's should monitor and report
any material like this posted by telephoning parents directly.

Do you know exactly what your children are posting on the Internet
regardless their age are you constantly supervising their Internet
use?

I recall a teenage girl telling me she was suicidal, just recently
over the last few years, my empathy fully kicked in and I wrote her
the following in painful but deeply dearly true words of
encouragement.

Why do you feel like taking your life, don't you know there a billions
of children your age and much younger too, living in endless third
world countries would willingly trade your place and be in your shoes
right now?

You have a home, a bed and blankets, comfort food water, heat
electricity a computer to type this out on, no doubt you've computer
games dvd television music system and lost more. You've a family and
parents that love you dearly they could not manage to go on as normal
would suffer very badly without you all their life along.

Where as the children who would trade your place as I mentioned, they
have absolutely nothing, they want to die but are to weak to take
their own life through lack of food and water they face starvation.
They have no food and no money to buy food, nor any shops to go to
even if they could.

They can't even go to a shop and buy razor blades or rope and end
their life cause there are no shops and no money to be able to afford
those things. They have no blankets no clothes no food no home no
family no loving parents nor any one even of the many luxuries you
have.

Rather than waste your life why not swap places with one of them
first, you'll soon get your wish to die and also be letting one of
them live in place of you?

Those thoughts deeply touched that young lady she was so moved at what
I had wrote to her she went and confided in her parents that very
night.

As result I wrote relaying that myself being older, I would send her
an angel feather from heaven when I finally died, just to let her know
she should always have hope?

With this in mind I compiled her the following poem and this as with
the comments above is for all those who think that taking their life
is an easy answer option.
