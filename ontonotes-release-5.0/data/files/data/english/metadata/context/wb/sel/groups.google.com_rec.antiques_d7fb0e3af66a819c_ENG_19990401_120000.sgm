Hi ... as some of you may recall, I (we) moved house several months
ago, in '98 ~ most of our bits and pieces being still in the packing
cases, but every now and then we unpack a little bit. It's like Xmas
but sometimes more like a bad dream. ;&gt;

These pair of vases came out of hiding last evening. I bought them
maybe just over a ago (shortly before we moved) and decided to keep
them. I am aware of the factory, although not that much on its history
or work.

I believe this stuff is more common in America than it is over here in
the UK/Ireland. I am NOT {please note Carol ;&gt;) } looking a monetary
worth, just, can anyone assist and fill in the blanks?

1. Does anyone know the pattern name?

2. Does anyone know who the designer was? (see sig, back stamp image)

3. Or any other useful input? (other than to buy a book)

Here's the URL links ... many thanks for your input.

"/> Ronnie, that's French. Based entirely on the fact that the work &quot;dessin&quot;
is French for &quot;drawing&quot; (or &quot;design&quot; in that context). Design as in the
decoration, anyway. I don't know any more, and don't have any books with
me. It's a nice pair, though, with an air of turn-of-the-century about
them, to my eye.

"/> I would have put in more info with the first post , but but my young lad
Noah required a urgent diaper change. Our man Alf Wallander ( 1862-
1914) was quite talented, porcelain was only one of the mediums he used,
he also designed furniture, glass and textiles. He was one of the first
in Sweden to design in the Art Nouveau style, his porcelain pieces
tended to have floral decorations underglaze or modelled in relief, the
colours sometimes almost had a pastel look to them. Alf began work at
Rorstrand in 1895 and as Trance has already stated, became artistic
director in 1897. The Rorstrand company itself made several different
wares, during the 19th century they produced earthenware items copying
English styles, Bone china in Sevres style during the 1850's and
Majolica items in the 1870's, Rorstrand didn't use hard paste porcelain
till the 1870's . Alf being at Rorstrand in 1895 and 1900 being the peak
for Art Nouveau , plus his departure from this earth in 1914 should help
narrow down the time of production for your vases. The Pattern? well ,
just one more mystery to ponder. Man, I love Nouveau!

"/> Well, I looked in one of my handy-dandy marks books, and here's the
highlights:

Porslin Fabriker Rorstrands (with an umlaut over the o), Lidkoping
(same), Sweden. Founded 1726 as a faience factory; began producing
porcelain in 1797.

&quot;At the time of the Art-Nouveau movement, Alf Wallander was the artistic
director, himself creating many models. He and his co-worker Erkikson
and the two Linstroms made excellent models and underglaze colours.&quot;

The mark shown could have been used anytime from the 1880s on.

I recommend that anyone who might come across European porcelain buy.

Beautiful vases, Ronnie. I have no idea what the pattern would be
called, but the flowers appear to be fuchsias.

&quot;At the world exhibition in Stockholm in 1897, the very best of Swedish

Rörstrand, by designers like Gunnar Wennerberg and Alf Wallander.&quot;

"/> A few more tidbits from &quot;Scandinavia: Ceramics &amp; Glass in the Twentieth
Century&quot; (a catalogue of the holdings of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum):

&quot;Wallander made delicately wrought and modelled porcelains based on
flower and plant forms...in a style which reflected the international
Art Nouveau manner fashionable in Europe, but painted in what had become
the typical Scandinavian underglaze palette of blue-greys, pinks &amp;
greens....Wallander's elegant and subtle Art Nouveau was restrained
enough to appeal to British taste. The Victoria and Albert Museum
bought a modeest group of Wallander's porcelains following the [1900
Paris] exhibition [where Rorstrand was awarded a grand prix] -- a
cautious purchase by a national museum of the country that deeply
disapproved of the apparently ungoverned extravagances of French or
Belgian Art Nouveau.&quot;

The unexpurgated text contrasts Wallander's work with his contemporary
Gunnar Wennerberg, whose work was simpler and had less international
appeal.

The book shows several examples of Wallander's work, including one vase
ca. 1906-08 which strikes me as very similar in concept to your vases,
though with a different pattern. (BTW, none of the Wallander pieces in
this catalogue are identified by pattern name.]

In addition to the media Mike mentioned, Wallander also did metal and
painting. Under career, it lists:

1895-1910 Rorstrand, Lidkoping, art director from 1900
1899- Svensk Konstslojdutstalining [umlauts upon
request], Selma Globel (interior design),
director
1908-9 Kosta [glassworks]
1908-14 Reijmyre [glassworks]
1908- Natl College of Art Craft &amp; Design, Stockholm,
senior tutor

"/> Alf Wallander 1862-1914 was a painter, designer, became artistic &quot;leader&quot; and
designer at Rorstrand 1895- 1910. He was working with Kosta glassworks 1909-12
and with Reijmyre 1908-14. Seems to have been everywhere at the same time more
or less. Described as little bit restless.
He is represented at many museums, among them The National museum, Hallwylska,
The Nordic museums in Stockholm, and there is a claim that he should be
represented in Minneapolis, no less.

Earlier there had been some artists working sporadically at both Rorstrand and
Gustavsberg but when Wallander and G. Wennerberg (who was at Gustavsberg)
begun to work with the mentioned factorys it was the beginning of something new.
They where pioneers for what many over here likes to think of as the typical
Swedish &quot;art industry era&quot; in this century, that is, that almost every factory
emloyed artists and had a department that produced unique art pottery wich did
far from always, but sometimes had an impact on the massproduced goods.
The &quot;Swedish Grace&quot; comes to mind.
And yes, I have been cheating and looking in some books! &lt;BG&gt;

Long time no hear from you Martin. Thanks to your post, I can now quit
wondering why the name Alf Wallander is familiar to me. Kosta in Sweden is
known to produce some of the world's finest crystal, correct?

Well seems we have unravelled the mystery on our man Alf Wallander,
which has been much appreciated. Many thanks Mike, Rich, Gillam and
Martin in Sweden, for all your much valued info and input.

As I said in my previous post, these vases I bought to re-sell but in
the end decided to hold on to them. In fact shortly after the purchase
I (we) decided to move house/shop, and they have been packed away for
almost a year, even in our last abode they were never on display, so
it's really for the first time I have gave these any serious thought
or consideration.

Always well that ends well. I must say I like them a lot, but never
come across that much Rorstrand here in Ireland. Now! how they ever
got here is another question, although that one may remain a mystery
forever. :)

Once again, thanks for an interesting thread, and happy rolling to ya
all on Sunday. :)

You got it right the second time -- specifically, it's a person who
attended Texas A&amp;M. In spite of the university having a good reputation
academically, there is a long tradition of Aggie jokes that focus on the
attendees' cluelessness. Actually, the Aggies I know in real life are
generally quite intelligent, but most are rather... odd.

So when my kids seem to be trying to cause themselves brain damage, I
use that particular caution, and I thought Laurie needed it, too...

PS -- These days, Aggies don't like to be called Aggies, because they
consider it a pejorative term. They much prefer to be known as
Agro-Americans. &lt;ba-dump&gt;

So, Terri, did you hear about the Aggie who was driving from Texas to
California? He saw a sign which read, &quot;Clean Restrooms Ahead.&quot; By the time he
reached California he had cleaned 389 bathrooms! Ba-Dump!

For our friends across the ocean, just an example of Aggie humor.

Okay, now you've done it. I hadn't intended to inflict this on the world
at large, but now I have to tell one of my favorite Aggie jokes.

There was an Aggie who, upon graduation from A&amp;M, enthusiastically looked
forward to setting up his chicken farm. He had saved his money, and
bought some good land, found a stock of healthy baby chicks, prepared the
soil and then planted them, about 1 inch deep. He watered them carefully,
but it was to no avail: they all died in a day or two.

Only slightly disheartened (after all, his teachers had told him that
farming was hard work!) he went and bought more baby chicks. This time,
he fertilized as well, but it was no use: they all died, just as the first
batch had.

He was getting pretty discouraged, but tried once more, this time planting
the baby chicks head first, but they lasted a much shorter time than the
previous two plantings. Now he was desperate, and he decided he had to
ask for help. He wrote a letter explaining his situation to the major
professor in the agriculture department, and took a few days off until he
had an answer.

He was surprised to receive a telegram from his old professor the next
day. It read:

SITUATION SOUNDS SERIOUS
SEND SOIL SAMPLES
