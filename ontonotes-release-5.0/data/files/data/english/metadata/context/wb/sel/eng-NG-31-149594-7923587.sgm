Harold:  Bruce Ganton says you won't see this unless I send it to this list
serve - so - here it is - Jean.

Harold:  Here is a post I sent to the people on my list who have asked to
receive info from Aboriginal sources.  I added my own comment to help people
understand the background to current Aboriginal leadership in Canada.  The
people I listen to with the greatest respect in the matter of Aboriginal
issues are Aboriginal people - however they want to define themselves.  So -
FYI - Jean.

A few years ago, before the Harper government, I think I would have greeted
yesterday's announcement (on June 12/07) re land claims enthusiastically,
but my fear of Harper's plans for the future of Canada makes me even more
wary of Harper's and Jim Prentice's &quot;historic&quot; plan for re-vamping
Aboriginal land claims.

And I have always said that, where there are differences of opinion among
various Aboriginal people or organizations, I stand apart, loving you all
equally, partly because I know that some of those differences arise from the
&quot;divide and conquer&quot; tactics my people have used over several centuries to
try to speed the colonization/assimilation process.

There is some truth to the fact that not all Band Chiefs (who are empowered
for leadership in their reserves by virtue of the federal Indian Act
legislation) have been able to retain their traditional tribal leadership
values.  The Indian Act, under which they have been exercising power in
their reserves for well over 100 years, compels Band leaders, the Chiefs and
Councillors, to be accountable to INAC (Indian &amp; Northern Affairs Canada)
but there is absolutely no accountability build into the leadership
regulations towards their people.    To their credit, there are many Band
Chiefs who retain at least some semblance of the understanding of their
traditional role as leaders, which is to listen to and serve their people,
but many have been corrupted by INAC governance and become unaccountable to
their people.

And the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) is essentially a creature of INAC.
It certainly is heavily funded by INAC, and while it endeavours to speak for
all Aboriginal Chiefs, (and it has had a number of leaders who have been,
and are currently,  strongly motivated to try to speak for the people), it
is difficult for some to accept that the AFN can speak for all the people,
since he/she is chosen by the 600 or so Chiefs across the country who vote
for that office.  Each of those Band Chiefs is, technically, voted into
office by the reserve residents (Band members), but it is a well-known fact
that in many reserves, the Chief and Council are chosen because they belong
to one or two &quot;headman&quot; families, and there is almost never any kind of
&quot;campaign&quot; leading to the vote, nor are there many people who exercise the
vote on reserves.  They are convinced that only certain families will be
elected, and trying to campaign against those people means that when they
are elected, they have the power to give jobs, homes, and other amenities to
their families and friends, and if you are known to have voted against them,
you may find yourself way down on the list of needy people.

One of the reasons for this breakdown in traditional beliefs is the
residential school experience of many chiefs and their families - another
way in which we tried to oppress and assimilate.

This situation has begun to be addressed by the Aboriginal provincial
organizations, and with good results, and I applaud those efforts.  It is
one of the ways in which Aboriginal people are becoming strong enough to
reclaim their own traditional values, culture, and language, and I see them
becoming strong enough to demand self-governance, and INAC is beginning to
listen.  There is great hope in that for Aboriginal people.

Meanwhile, the elected Chiefs who want to be responsible to their people are
doing what they can to support the good things offered to them, but they
will continue to fight against what they see as bad things, and we must
understand and respect why that is, and support them in their efforts to
achieve justice for their people within the sovereign-to-sovereign treaty
relationship between First Nations leaders and you and me as represented by
our federal and provincial governments.

Herewith, I commend to you the following post - FYI - Jean.

Commentary

A Cree cultural leader speaks out

We need to end the obsolete function of the AFN and the dysfunctional
leadership on first nations reserves

FLOYD FAVEL

Globe and Mail Update

June 12, 2007 at 8:59 AM EDT

I wish I could support Assembly of First Nations Chief Phil
Fontaine's call for a national day of action on June 29, calling all
Canadians to support aboriginal people and their call to address
their two main grievances, as defined by Mr. Fontaine. Those
grievances being land claims to be resolved, and funding to be raised
from the 2-per-cent cap set by the Liberals to 2.5 per cent. I wish I
could support his call, but I can't. These issues are too narrow and
do not address the injustices that most aboriginal people live with
in modern Canada. Some are the results of a colonial policy that
Canada has used to administer our people, but some are being
perpetrated by our own people, by the very same chiefs who elect the AFN
chief.

Such injustices include unaccountable leadership on first nations
reserves - unaccountable leadership that administers its people
without any rules and leaves no avenues with which to protest unjust
leadership.

The Department of Indian Affairs is silent when it comes to such
things and, more shamefully, the Assembly of First Nations plays down
unaccountable leadership, simply because it is the chiefs who elect
the AFN chief.

I live on the Poundmaker Reserve in Saskatchewan, a reserve that is
blessed in human resource potential but that has had the same
unaccountable leadership for the past 13 years. There have not been
any regular band meetings for all these years. The membership has
little idea how its funds, its assets, its natural-resource revenues
are administered or spent. The reserve's only major businesses are
those directly owned by the leadership.

There are no committees to make decisions about housing, education
and employment. Jobs are largely disbursed by the leadership as
favours, or withheld as punishment. There has been no band office
since it burned to the ground in 2003, the night before an audit by
federal officials.

This leadership is represented at the national level by Mr. Fontaine,
who blames all our woes on the federal government. On our reserve, an
increase in federal funding will only increase the existing problems.

I don't want this article to be used by right-wing Canadians for
misinformed attacks on our treaty rights. These treaties were signed
by our ancestors with the Crown and, in many ways, legitimize the
dispossession of our lands by the Canadian people. Without these
treaties, there would be enormous legal, ethical and economic
repercussions for the entire country. It is a racist notion to
believe that Canadians had the right to dispossess us of our lands
simply by their self-proclaimed virtues and superiority. We
aboriginal people have our own rich cultures and beliefs that add to
the fabric of Canada. Indeed, we, along with hockey and the natural
environment, define Canada in the eyes of the world.

In our culture, you'll find a belief in the sanctity of the natural
environment. This belief can inform and inspire all Canadians as we
struggle to formulate a sustainable economy in the face of global
warming. Unfortunately, these beliefs are being compromised by
aboriginal leadership, which has been co-opted into the narrow-minded
economic system of mainstream Canada.

At this moment, trucks loaded with gravel haul our land away,
creating destructive eyesores on our beautiful land. The Buffalo
River Dene Nation in northern Saskatchewan has signed an agreement
for bitumen exploration on its traditional lands. Bitumen exploration
is another word for tar sands, the development of which is an
environmental catastrophe comparable to the destruction of the
Amazonian rain forest. What is our leadership thinking?

On the local and national level, our leadership is strangely silent
on environmental issues. Money and political power seem to be their
masters - no different from the colonial oppressors our people have
lived with for the past century. This is just as tragic as the
poverty and dysfunction that permeates first nations communities, as
tragic as the racism that exists at all levels of Canadian society.

But our local and national leaders live in comfort, driving their big
trucks and collecting huge salaries.

The tragedy of our leadership can be easily changed.

On a national level, the function of the Assembly of First Nations
needs major revision. This organization must remember its reason for
being: to lobby for aboriginal rights. But the aboriginal world has
changed from the AFN's inception in the late 1960s; its needs are
different now.

Within first nations communities, we need a re-evaluation of where we
are going as a people and how we can further contribute to this great
country. To do this, we have to shake off the shackles that hinder
our growth - one of which is the obsolete function of the AFN and the
dysfunctional leadership that most of our communities live with.

To achieve this &quot;Buckskin Revolution,&quot; the Indian Act, which dictates
how reserves are governed, must be restructured. As well, we must
redefine the relationship between elected chiefs and the AFN, and
between the AFN and the federal government.

Mr. Fontaine's call for a national day of action is a call by a man
and an

Let's leave my distrust of the Harper government for another time.  The

Harold and Jean

You both seem to disagree without the possibility of discourse.

Is white culture the cause of corruptions? It isn't a question of
white culture at all but of the tension between opportunity and
responsibility.

There is the danger of isolation and the debilitating effects of this
problem. Unfortunately, I am the receiving end of some of them as an
adoptive parent of a now 29 year old victim of fetal alcohol syndrome.
He is not better or worse off outside of the reserve. He is a mass of
contradictions and damage and would be hard pressed to function in any
culture of any colour, but he has many friends on the street and he
has had some remarkable musical experiences.  He is also - along with
the homeless in general - God's secret agent. We cannot be complacent
in our rich ignorance when such persons happen. My experience makes it
difficult to comment without bias.

I am also aware of government programs and the dangers to all -
bureaucrat and receiver alike - when large amounts of money are
transferred. Accountability is of the essence but is very difficult
and as Harold points out, it creates a dependency.  Companies or
universities receiving research grants have the danger of becoming
dependent on them too.  As soon as we are successful, the grants dry
up - so dependency is almost guaranteed but the result may be a new
thing on the earth earlier or instead of not at all. Money creates
these problems.

I also by the way am a product of a residential school - a not happy
experience for me due to abuse by an Anglican Priest over a period of
years. So when do we leave these things behind and come away healed?

Applying these things to aboriginal issues alone is difficult. We have
many successful aboriginal things and people here in the west from the
Museums on the Queen Charlottes to the individual artists and singers
that I have personally known all up and down the coast. Some of them
have had grants and some not; some on reserve and some not; some
teaching in non-abroiginal situations (not white either by the way);
some speak to the whales and some do not.

I am grateful that I have one possible source of integration and
healing - that which comes through the creative use of non-power by
the Son of God on my behalf.  I know that I need this help. I don't
know if other helps are sufficient - they may be but I know my source
(and it is not the Churches but the Lord they worship - or so I
understand).  The Churches run the same risk as government of being
condescending to their flock and failing as they do to build and use
the gifts that are there.  I know, I know, there are lots of servers,
and vergers, and volunteer choir members - but their roles are limited
as were those of the children of Korah - but the Koraites got the last
word! (they rewrote the salvation history in Chronicles. - see Michael
Goulder's book on the Psalms of the Sons of Korah) - and the Churches
have a lot of interest in money - and that is disruptive frequently.

You cannot keep people in their place (reserve or pew) and expect to
grow them! So the university has its guild and the scholars and the
priests and of course the convenience of the nation which is the
government's responsibility. So how do you match responsibility with
opportunity?

Bob:

Thank you for this.  You have the experience of living with and among
Aboriginal people so I honour your story.  In particular, I understand the
effort to share one's life with an Aboriginal person with foetal alcohol
syndrome, as I have become friends over the past three years with two young
Aboriginal men with the same condition.  They have been homeless but are now
living in an apartment, and doing very well with the help of an older friend
who has also decided to forgo living on the street.  &quot;God's secret agent&quot; -
to describe the homeless - I understand and appreciate that, also.

&quot;When do we leave these things behind and come away healed?&quot;  That is an
important question, and I guess the answer is different for each of us.  I
know that for Aboriginal people, the ultimate healing has to take place
within their own hearts and minds - no matter how much I would wish to help,
I cannot do that for them.  I must only stand side by side, and pray for
their strength and courage to effect that healing within themselves.  We are
fortunate that within the Anglican Indigenous Church we have stories like
&quot;Topahdewin, The Gladys Cook Story&quot; (from Anglican Video) and of other
Anglican Indigenous folk (some of them most recently heard from at GS 2007).
And in all the healing situations of which I'm aware, it is ultimately the
reliance on one's Christian or traditional faith that enables that to
happen, the result of the Great Spirit/God working in our lives.

It is my understanding that, as church people, we will be given the
opportunity to engage in this healing process when the healing and
reconciliation projects begin - probably this fall, according to my bishop
in Toronto.  Is it possible that such a process will allow us the
opportunity to &quot;match responsibility&quot;?

Thanks again for sharing your thoughts with me and with the list.

Blessings,
Jean.
