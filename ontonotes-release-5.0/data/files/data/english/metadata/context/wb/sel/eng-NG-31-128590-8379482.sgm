GENERAL ELECTION.
-------------
CUMBERLAND (EAST).     [continued]

Mr. JAMES then came forward to address the multitude, but a scene of great
turmoil and confusion took place, which lasted for nearly a quarter of an hour,
during which, from the symptoms of riot which began to evidence themselves, and
the determination evinced by a considerable portion of the crowd not to hear the
Liberal candidates, as the Conservatives would not be listened to, many persons
on the hustings dreaded that a renewal of the scene which occurred in West
Yorkshire would have taken place. After a considerable commotion, however,
silence was at length procured, when Mr. JAMES said that he believed a large
portion of his constituents were anxious he should still continue the services
which they had selected him to perform on the last occasion on which they had
exercised the privilege of the franchise; and he could assure them that,
although he might not have done all he ought to have done, and certainly less
than he wished, yet he could proudly say that he had not done anything which
could have forfeited their good opinion and confidence. (Cheers.) As had been
said by his friend Mr. HOWARD, and truly so, his public conduct, although he had
served them but for a limited period, was, nevertheless, long known to them.
(Cheers.) When he was last before them on the hustings, he had explained to them
his opinions, and had declared the principles upon which he would act if he was
returned by them to Parliament. Since then he had endeavoured to follow up those
principles consistently for the benefit of the country; and if he had again the
honour to be elected by them, he would accept the trust confided to him with
unabated zeal, and would do his best for Cumberland and for the country
generally (cheers and disapprobation), more especially he would endeavour to get
the benefits of that reform for them which they had all struggled to obtain.
(Cheers.) He had still the same detestation of Tory principles and of Toryism as
ever, for he believed them to be subversive of the rights, the privileges, and
the liberties of mankind, whilst the assertions of the party in reference to the
alleged attacks on the institutions of the country served but to alarm the
weak-minded, and to form excuses for the renegade voter. (&quot;Hear,&quot; cheers, and
disapprobation.) It was very convenient for his opponents to ally him, as they
did the Ministry, with Mr. O'CONNELL; but his friend Mr. HOWARD had stated to
them the truth when he stated that this was not the case. He did not disavow any
connexion with Mr. O'CONNELL, for he was his friend, and when he thought that he
was wrong, he did not hesitate to vote and speak against him. (&quot;Hear,&quot; cheers,
and disapprobation.) But many persons had told him that they would not vote for
him because he supported Mr. O'CONNELL, who was a dangerous man. Now, he (Mr.
JAMES) did not think so (cheers); but if he were, what was it that had made him
so? The wrongs of Ireland. (Cheers.) And how would they render him less
dangerous? By redressing those wrongs. (Cheers.) He had been told that it was
desired by him to establish Roman Catholic ascendancy and Popery in this
country, and the Tories certainly thought that there was nothing too bad of this
nature which was not desired to be done; but he (Mr. JAMES), as the friend of
freedom, would repel the charge. He wished to get rid of the abuses, which would
prove injurious to the constitution, to remedy its defects, and to cause it to
work harmoniously for the general good. And then, in reference to the organic
changes which were spoken of as requisite in the House of Lords, he was not an
advocate for the abolition of that house. He did not think that if the reforms
to which he alluded were carried, it would be necessary to get rid of it, but he
would maintain that if it did not harmonize with the constitution of the empire,
it ought to be got rid of. (Loud cheering and disapprobation.) But he hoped for
better things for the future. (Hear, hear.) He wished to preserve all that was
worth preserving in the institutions of the country, and to destroy what was not
worth keeping. (&quot;Hear,&quot; and cheers.) But the reply of the Tories now was the
same they gave whilst the Reform Bill was passing through the Legislature; it
was said that if they got rid of the rotten boroughs they would destroy the
monarchy and overturn the established church. (&quot;Hear,&quot; and cheers.) Now, amongst
the charges brought against him were, that he was the enemy of religion, and
wished to overthrow the church; but he would say, that if he were the enemy of
the church - the church which he wished to reform, and was therefore declared to
be its enemy - if he were the enemy of the church, the thing by which he would
most gratify his enmity would be not to promote a reform of it (cheers and
disapprobation), for he knew that it was by withholding it the real danger would
be created. (Cheers.) He was, and had been all his life, a sincere member of the
Church of England - he had done his best to promote its interests and its
usefulness, he wished to give it his honest support, and he knew that a reform
of it would be the best means of strengthening it. (Cheers.) He did not want to
alienate the revenues of the church from strictly religious purposes; but he
thought that a redistribution of church property should take place, by which
they would afford the greatest possible amount of instruction to the greatest
number of persons, and by remunerating the clergy according to the amount of
their services. (Hear.) At the same time he thought it right that all men should
enjoy the right to observe the form of worship which they believed to be the
best; whereas the Tory principle - that of Sir James GRAHAM - was to denounce
the religion of a large portion of the people, and thus alienate their
affections. The hon. gentleman then referred to the opposition of Sir J. GRAHAM
to the Irish Municipal Bill, although he might perhaps vote with the Duke of
WELLINGTON next session. In respect to the Irish church, Protestantism was not
the religion of Ireland; and therefore the state had a right to deal with any
surplus which might remain, after the religious instruction of the Protestants
was provided for, to the purpose of the instruction of the majority; and this he
considered would be instrumental in promoting peace and prosperity in that
beautiful land, whereas at present there were there now 800 parishes in which
there was hardly a resident Protestant. (Hear, hear.) Many of the clergy had
their thousands a-year without any congregation, while in other places there
were congregations without pastors. With regard to the agricultural interest,
his private interests were bound up with it, but he was anxious that justice
should be done to all parties. He wished for an abolition of the present corn
laws, and the adoption of a fixed rate instead of a fluctuating scale of prices.
He wished that the farmer should have a fair price for his corn, and that the
workman should buy his loaf at a reasonable price. Mr. JAMES then quoted Sir J.
GRAHAM as an authority in his favour, and quoted a passage from the publication
of the right hon. baronet to sustain his recommendation of a fixed rate of duty.
With regard to slavery, he would say that if he were sent to Parliament, he
would do all in his power to carry out in its spirit and in its letter that bill
which had cost the country so much money. Sir James GRAHAM was in the habit of
saying that the present was a weak and inefficient Administration. If it were
so, the electors had the power to render it less so, by turning the right hon.
baronet out. The contest was not between Sir J. GRAHAM and himself, but between
principles; and God grant that the electors might choose the right for the
country's interest. He was happy to tell them that our gracious Queen had
discharged from about the Court every man, woman, and child that was a Tory, and
he hoped the electors would follow out such an illustrious example by turning
out of Parliament as many Tories as they could.
