Hi All

A recent thread mentioned the history of usenet and caused
me to wander back through some old posts on the diabetes
newsgroups.

We have had some wonderful people help each other on these
groups in the past. But there is life away from the
newsgroups and people move on; sadly, that sometimes means
that their wisdom may be forgotten and disappear into the
archives. Some are easy to find in searches, some not.

So I thought it may be a good idea to start a thread
collecting some of the better posts from the past. I invite
anyone to add their own favourites to the thread.

I'll follow this with one of the posters who helped me a lot
when I first arrived.

Cheers, Alan, T2, Australia.

I have found it difficult, for some unknown reason, to
search for some of Old Al's posts using Google Groups
search. Here is one of his standard replies to a newby:

http://tinyurl.com/2u5txv

oldal4865
Nov 1 2006
Newsgroups: alt.support.diabetes
From: &quot;oldal4865&quot;

-First piece of advice:   Learn as much as you can about the
disease.

Method 1:   Read Jennifer's advice to the newly diagnosed.
(A whole bunch of us picky diabetics on these newsgroups
accept her site as
a good one)

http://www.alt-support-diabetes.org/NewlyDiagnosed.htm

Method 2:   Attend a diabetes training cour$e at a Ho$pital

(A bit pricey. . .BUT. . .many hospitals offer scholarships
to folks who can't pay.   Can't hurt to ask!)

Method 3:    Read the two diabetes newsgroups every night:
alt.support.diabetes    misc.health.diabetes

Slower but more complete than a training course.

--Second Piece of advice:
March and November are National
Diabetes-Something-or-Other-Months
(Education?  Awareness?)

Many hospitals conduct free Diabetes Expos during one or
both of those months.   That means free medical lectures,
free diabetes medical tests, and a look at the newest
diabetes therapies and support equipment.

(Did you notice,  &quot;free&quot; and &quot;medical&quot; in the same
sentence?)

November's here.  Call around,  find any in your
neighborhood.   FWIW,   I go to all of them in a 40 mile
radius   (Alas,  that's only two,  one in March one in
November)

-Third Piece of Advice:
Many hospitals offer free monthly Diabetes Support Group
meetings.   They aren't traditional support groups.  Rather,
they are free lectures by a medical professional on some
aspect of diabetes.

(There it is  again:  &quot;free&quot; and &quot;medical&quot; in the same
sentence!)

Note that Diabetes Support Group meetings are moderated by
the same people (CDE) who run the Diabetes Training Courses,
who are also the same people who can start an application
for a  scholarship in motion.

My particular slant on Type 2 Diabetes:

Your triglycerides are sky-high.    That is a strong
indication of very high Insulin Resistance.

That's bad.   You're well into the artery-damage range which
is a particularly bad place to be for a diabetic.

Your attack on high I.R. and high triglycerides

1.  Lose fat lb
2.  Gain muscle lb
3.  Exercise**every day,  as vigorously as possible
4.  Ration your carb,  eat slowly digesting carb,  spread
your daily carb over several small meals

(**Even walking 2 miles a day will help but squeezing in
something more vigorous will help more)

Cheap OTC triglyceride meds

5.  OTC Fish oil  (~ 3 gram/day)
6.  OTC Time release Niacin  (~1 gram/day)

Cheapest prescription med

7.  Metformin   (generic metformin,  Brand name
Glucophage)

1,2,3,4,7  fight high blood sugars and fight them well.
Metformin is almost a miracle med for Type 2 diabetics.

Two additional comments:

&quot;The First Year - Type 2 Diabetes &quot;   Becker,  Gretchen is
one of the best books around.   My library has a copy.

Type 2 diabetes is hereditary.   That means your mother,
father, siblings, cousins,  children and niece/nephews
should be made aware of their risk.

The latest correlation between HbA1c and 24/7 average blood
sugar is:

24/7 Ave bG = 35.6 x HbA1c - 77.3

Your HbA1c of 9 correlates with a 243 bG.   Your target is
&quot;less than 6.0&quot;, i.e.  24/7 bG less than 136

Keep coming back.  Diabetes is one of the odd diseases in
which the patient does all the work and most of the
management.  Reading the diabetes newsgroups every night has
produced substantial improvements in my health,
my quality of life,  and, I'm sure,  my life expectancy.

Regards
Old Al

I don't believe the high C-Peptide thing.  I clearly have IR and yet I

Your calculation is for a home meters that measures whole blood. Both

Some medical personnel suggest that,  at first-diagnosis,  ALL T2 should
be started on metformin plus an ACE merely for the proven prophylactic
values.

Before you quit your metformin,   take a quick look at these URL

a. Metformin reduces blood sugars

http://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes_treatments/metformin.php

b. Metformin improves cholesterol and triglycerides

http://tinyurl.com/5errv

c. Metformin cuts heart attack risk in T2

http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/issue132/item2.shtml

also,

Common diabetes drug lowers risk by inhibiting proinflammatory factor
Heart Disease Weekly
July 27, 2003
&quot;This action of metformin may help prevent Atherosclerosis,&quot; said Dandona,
&quot;and may explain why persons with type 2 diabetes who are treated with
metformin are at lower risk of dying from heart disease.&quot;

(BTW, so do the TZDs, Actos and Avandia)

d. Actually,  Metformin reduces overall mortality rates among T2 diabetics

http://tinyurl.com/69yjd

e. Metformin probably protects dying beta cells which are the proximate
cause of T2
(A reasonable interpretation of the metformin results in the DPT-2  (DPP-2
??)

http://www.niddk.nih.gov/welcome/releases/8_8_01.htm

(Regular, heavy exercise is an extremely potent defense against the host of
T2 &quot;bad effects&quot;.    Metformin is decidedly in second place [see DPT-2} when
compared to, say, becoming an aerobics instructor.    However,  if you are
exercise-restricted,   metformin becomes a &quot;miracle&quot; drug)

f. Metformin protects against the formation of Advanced Glycosylation End
Products (A.G.E.)

(A very good thing for a diabetic)

http://tinyurl.com/5tonv

g.  Metformin simulates exercise

http://www.dundee.ac.uk/pressreleases/prmar02/ghardie.htmg

h.  Metformin helps folks lose weight (though usually only in
the first year)

http://www.smart-drugs.net/ias-metformin-weightloss.htm

i.   However,  metformin favors vitamin B12 deficiency and a related high
homocysteine levels.

http://www.aafp.org/afp/20040115/letters.html

and

http://tinyurl.com/4nytv

&quot;. . . .The clinical significance of metformin-induced low levels of serum
vitamin B12 associated with an increase in serum homocysteine levels as a
risk factor for vascular disease is still controversial. Calcium
supplementation appears to be an effective treatment as well as
intramuscular or oral crystalline cyanocobalamin   (B12).  . .&quot;

High homocysteine is scary.  Extra B6,  B12 and Folic acid are the standard
high-homocysteine remedies, which, IMO,  *** ALL ****  diabetics (even T1 )
ought to use,  independently of metformin use.

j.  When you are all through with &quot;quick reads&quot;,    spend some time on this
exhaustive survey article from the Annals of Internal Medicine journal

http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/137/1/25.pdf

Lastly,

&quot;. . .once I get into a state where better control is possible. . .&quot;

Don't fixate on blood sugar control.   Type 2 diabetes is primarily a
cardiovascular disease.

&quot;. . .For most of my patients, [ Type 2] diabetes is really a cardiovascular
disease, occasionally complicated by high blood sugar. . .&quot;

I forgot your running battle with Old Al.

To amplify Jan's response, a reference from the page she
linked to:
http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/summary/139/10/802

Use of Common Laboratory Tests To Identify People with
Insulin Resistance

&quot;What did the researchers find?

The tests that were most useful for identifying patients who
had insulin resistance were triglyceride level, ratio of
triglyceride to HDL cholesterol, and insulin level. However,
no test was perfect and all tests missed some people with
insulin resistance and incorrectly labeled some people as
insulin resistant when they were not. In addition, insulin
levels are not standardized across laboratories, so similar
values obtained from another laboratory might or might not
indicate insulin resistance. For this reason, the authors
favor the lipid markers (triglyceride level and the ratio of
triglyceride to HDL cholesterol) of insulin resistance.&quot;

That was from the summary. You will find the original paper
here:

I'd be willing to bet that one particular poster won't post in this thread.

I'm glad somebody gets the value of the archives, at least.

This one is from one of my favourite ladies. I dropped in on
her when I happened to be passing one Christmas; she was
only 500km away, well worth the trip for a cuppa. Sadly,
health issues have led to her retirement from the group but
I encourage anyone to spend an hour browsing through her
posts in the archives.

Just one example for those interested in eyes and diet. Read
back up through the thread for background.

Subject: Re: Zeaxanthin and Lutein

&quot;After posting the above, I realised that a bit more
information would be helpful.

So I thought it might be a good idea to post some of the
food sources for the ingredients mentioned. That way people
can choose the ones that suit their own taste or degree of
availablity. There may, of course, be other food sources not
listed here, I just took those listed at:

http://www.hypoglycemia.asn.au/articles/rich_sources_nutrients.html

1. Beta carotene: (Converts to Vitamin A).
Apricots, asparagus, watercress, avocados, beet root greens,
broccoli, Brussels sprout, rockmelon (cantaloupe), carrots,
chard, chili peppers,
yellow corn, cress, pink grapefruit, greens (mustard,
turnip, beet, collard etc), kale, lettuce, butterhead or
Romaine lettuce, mandarin oranges, mangoes, papayas,
parsley, peaches, bell peppers, plums, pumpkins, tangerines,
spinach, squash, winter squash, sweet potatoes, tomatoes and
water melon.

2. Copper:
Calf and beef liver, Brazil nuts, pickled cucumber, cashews,
oysters, lobster, avocado, almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts,
pecans, peanuts, cod liver
oil, banana, dried bean, soy beans, soy lecithin, peas,
pulses, whole wheat, prunes, prawns (shrimp) and most
seafood, legumes, molasses, potatoes, organ
meats, poultry, game, chicken, grain products, dark
chocolate, raisins, beer, cider, coconut, mushrooms, black
pepper, thyme, paprika, Bay leaves, Bone meal*. (Drinking
water from copper piping should also be considered a source
of copper).

3. Lutein: &amp; Zeaxanthin: (Carotenoids  - plant pigments,
recommended in treatment of eye diseases).
Highest in avocado, corn, kiwi, red grapes, green peppers,
carrots, oranges and rich in eggs (the deeper the colour of
the egg yolk, the more it
contains lutein and zeaxanthin), pumpkin, kale, collard
greens and many other yellow to red vegetables and fruits.
Found in spinach.
It may improve vision in retinitis pigmentosa. It is an
antioxidant that slows cancer development, stimulates immune
function and protects against
the risk of age-related macular degeneration in the eye.
(AMD), helpful in glaucoma, cataract and
various eye diseases.

4. Selenium: Butter, tuna, herrings, smelt, oysters, Brazil
nuts (5 Brazil nuts per day), nuts, eggs, poultry, apple
cider vinegar, scallops, barley,
lobster, prawn (shrimp), beef, Brewer's yeast, wheat germ,
garlic, onions, bran, broccoli, whole grains, pork, chicken,
milk. (US wheat content higher
than European wheat content).

5. Vitamin C: (Ascorbic acid, ascorbate)
Citrus fruits,Kiwi Fruit, rose hips, Acerola cherries,
alfalfa seeds, alfalfa sprouts, cantaloupe (Rock Melon)
strawberries, broccoli, cabbage,
tomatoes, green peppers, capsicum, parsley, Brussels sprout,
kale, mustard greens, paw paw, spinach, cauliflower,
oranges, mangoes, grapefruit,
pineapple, radishes, onions, green peas, spinach, sweet
peppers. Herbs: alfalfa, burdock root, cayenne, chickweed,
eye bright, fennel seed, fenugreek, hops, Horsetail, kelp,
peppermint, mullein, nettle, oat
straw, paprika, parsley, pine needle, plantain, raspberry
leaf, red clover, rose hips, skullcap violet ;leaves,yarrow,
yellow dock.

6. Vitamin E: (Tocopherol) The body needs zinc to maintain
proper vitamin E levels. Vitamin E and vitamin C work
synergistically in the body.
Richest in wheat germ oil, avocado, Almonds, Brazil nuts,
cold-pressed oils, cornmeal, Dulse, eggs, legumes, nuts,
brown rice, oatmeal, organ meats,
sunflower seeds (&amp; oil), safflower oil, sesame oil, peanut
oil, corn oil, hazelnuts, olive oil, organ meats, molasses,
nuts, soybean oil, sweet
potatoes, leafy vegetables, watercress, wholegrains, kelp,
milk, desiccated liver* (See NHS205.21) Herbs: alfalfa,
bladder wrack, dandelion, dong quai,
flaxseed, nettle, oat straw, raspberry leaf, rose hip.

Zinc: Unprocessed bran, wheat bran, lean beef steak, Brazil
nuts, brown rice, cashews, cocoa dried powder, almonds
(nuts), cheddar cheese, Edam cheese, Parmesan cheese, chic
peas, oysters, dark meat of turkey, ginger root, hazelnuts,
lamb chops, lentil, potato, soya sprouts, sunflower seeds,
split peas, beef liver, pork, nonfat dry milk, yoghurt, egg
yolk, whole wheat, rye, oats, seafood, organ meats, edible
mushrooms, Brewer's yeast, soybeans, walnuts, wholemeal
flour, orange juice.

Because Australian soil is low in zinc it is advisable to
take zinc daily zinc supplements in the form of chelated
zinc.

(And I did).

Bon apetite,

Annette&quot;

Yes Annette is a very delightful and good person. I miss her gentle posts.

I went to the archive to find a particular issue we use to talk about here a
few years ago and could not find it but instead had a good cry seeing all
those friends that are gone from the group and some have passed away. I love
the archives. Thanks for your suggestion.

Anyway the post was by Jude and he contstantly spoke about those with
diabetes needs to wear shoes and foot care.

I then saw people I miss but had to leave as it was getting too emotional
for me. Colleen, Budd, Jude, Wolf, Bev, Doug, Ronnie, Carol, Daniel, Jude,
Charles, Tony from Mexico, Bev, Alien_Dancer, wombn, those are just a drop
in the bucket of those that I miss and was reading last night.

There are so many out there that have left for their own reasons and some
great ones have stayed and dedicated themselves to helping others.

This group is more good than bad. Take the good leave the bad don't like
someone skip their posts. Simple. :-)

Ok done reminising :-) Maybe

C-peptide is produced as a side-effect of insulin production; however,
it's much more stable in the body, so easier to measure. Plugging a
fasting glucose and a C-peptide reading into the HOMA model gives a
good indication of how much insulin you have as a base level, i.e.
what your IR is like.

&gt; &gt; Hi All

&gt; &gt; A recent thread mentioned the history of usenet and caused
&gt; &gt; me to wander back through some old posts on the diabetes
&gt; &gt; newsgroups.

&gt; &gt; We have had some wonderful people help each other on these
&gt; &gt; groups in the past. But there is life away from the
&gt; &gt; newsgroups and people move on; sadly, that sometimes means
&gt; &gt; that their wisdom may be forgotten and disappear into the
&gt; &gt; archives. Some are easy to find in searches, some not.

&gt; &gt; So I thought it may be a good idea to start a thread
&gt; &gt; collecting some of the better posts from the past. I invite
&gt; &gt; anyone to add their own favourites to the thread.

&gt; &gt; I'll follow this with one of the posters who helped me a lot
&gt; &gt; when I first arrived.

&gt; &gt; Cheers, Alan, T2, Australia.

&gt; missed. I do hope they are all doing well

People come and people go and that's why it is ridiculous to choose
NOT to archive posts that might help those in the future.

Here are some good professional links that a few of us realize the
importance of to a newbie:

On a related topic, someone posted recently about the USDA flavanoid
database, which can be found here:

The PDF gives you lists of foods which is kewl, but there's also an
Access database that lets you look for your favorite flavanoids.

&gt; Hi All

&gt; A recent thread mentioned the history of usenet and caused
&gt; me to wander back through some old posts on the diabetes
&gt; newsgroups.

&gt; We have had some wonderful people help each other on these
&gt; groups in the past. But there is life away from the
&gt; newsgroups and people move on; sadly, that sometimes means
&gt; that their wisdom may be forgotten and disappear into the
&gt; archives. Some are easy to find in searches, some not.

&gt; So I thought it may be a good idea to start a thread
&gt; collecting some of the better posts from the past. I invite
&gt; anyone to add their own favourites to the thread.

&gt; I'll follow this with one of the posters who helped me a lot
&gt; when I first arrived.

Well,  ,u experience with newsgroups predates Usenet
The first NET i was on was IP Sharpe - an international net of APL users
based in Canada

My first user group was ACT59, which was moderated by Sun Life of
Canada.  In the US, CompuServe provided similar services, but only to
large corporate accounts.  MUCH later Compuserve started selling off
hour time to the individuates market.

Later came Usenet - If you were in a DARPA facility, or if you were a
member of a Unix Users group you could get on Usenet.  About the same
time came FidoNet and its cousins.  Like Usenet, they were a system of
the messages in an area being swept into packets and swapped upstream.
To get an answer from Australia took about a week.

IPShaerpe was a true backbone based system.  I could email someone in
Singapore and get a reply the next day.  To reach it, I had to use a
dial-up network to access the Canadian backbone at Rochester New York.
Later they established one in Silver Spring.

I was shocked as hell when Deja News first began; hundreds of my posts
on lots of controversial topics were suddenly permanent!  One didn't
think about conversation being recorded back then.

It's very time-consuming to sort through posts and have them deleted; I
really only did it once to remove a long-term flamewar.  I can't even
explain why I did that as there's plenty of other flamewars I never
bothered deleting from the archives.

I got used to it though and eventually found myself annoyed that
thousands of my posts were &quot;lost&quot; by being posted long before any
archives or by being on BBSes instead of Usenet.

Doing a vanity search today yields more web-board posts than Usenet
ones... times change.

Posting a link to an article or the text of said article is not the same as
posting pictures of one's self.  If you add to a post some kind of personal
opinion or something that you'd rather not survive for others to see later,
I can understand it, but why would anyone post an informative non-opinioned
article but wish for it to not be archived?  It is -not- the same as posting
a picture.

Look, it's Usenet. People have their own reasons for doing things, when it
comes to munging or not munging, using filters or not using filters,
archiving or not archiving. There's plenty of value judgments being made out
there without sufficient information or objectivity. There's just no reason

Do you do this IRL also? I'm just trying to imagine what it'd be like to
have a conversation with someone who thought it was selfish that anyone
might object to having it tape-recorded.  Just seems weird to me.

I appreciate the archives.  I also appreciate the posts of those who
don't choose to archive.  Just... it would never occur to accuse anyone
of being selfish cause they didn't do it my way.

YMMV.

Gys, thanks for finding that message of Old Al's on
metformin. Unfortunately my newsserver was off air yesterday
and I had to read most answers via Google groups, so I
didn't respond to it directly.

This is one he posted about insulin use just prior to that
one in a thread on the genetics of diabetes. I don't use
insulin, so I'll let others comment on it's value. If I ever
do use insulin, I'll always keep in mind his description of
&quot;Godawful-NPH&quot;.

Subject: Re: genetics of diabetes

&lt;snip&gt;
More remarks from this completely insulin dependent
diabetic:

From my personal experience,   the best way to reduce your
HbA1c yet avoid going hypo is to:

1.   Use the most modern insulins available,  i.e.

Fast insulin before meals:   Humalog,  Novolog or Apidra

Slow insulin at bedtime:    Lantus or Levemir

2.   Use multiple small shots rather than a very few large
shots,  e.g. shoot fast insulin before every meal and snack
and be willing to use the &quot;Corrective Bolus&quot; technique, i.e.
test your sugar at 2 hours after eating and if too high,
inject a small &quot;Corrective Bolus&quot; of modern fast
insulin  (Humalog,  Novolog  or Apidra).   I regard 180 as
reason for a Corrective Bolus.   At times,  I have shot a
Corrective Bolus at 150.

The Corrective Bolus technique doesn't work too well with
the old-fashioned &quot;R Insulin&quot;  (Regular Insulin).  The R
insulin is too slow.

3.  Avoid the old-fashioned &quot;Insulin N&quot; as your slow
insulin.    I call Insulin N   &quot;Godawful-NPH&quot; because it is
so erratic and prone to cause hypos.    Some of us,
including some genteel ladies  (Kate),  use more earthy
terms.

I made NPH work but I had to split my daily dose into 4
shots to do so.

4.  Avoid the &quot;pre-mixes&quot;,  i.e.  70/30,  75/25.    As our
very good local endo says in his very good training lecture;
Pre-mixes are for T2,  i.e. people who are not totally
dependent on insulin.    If you are T2 and totally
dependent,   the T1 rules apply  (avoid pre-mixes)

5.  Find a good Certified Diabetes Educator and use her to
help you figure out how to control bG with insulin.    There
are insulin training courses at most hospitals.   The CDE
who teach these courses are willing to consult daily over
the phone after the original (for fee) consults.  Most of
the insulin trainer CDE can beat the docs since the CDE do
this all day,  every day and get very good at it.

Some remarks on &quot;going hypo&quot;

Speaking as a totally insulin dependent diabetic:

I see two modes of &quot;going hypo&quot;   (Caution:  engineer,  not
a medical person)

The first is a panic attack prompted by my hypothalamus.
When my hypothalamus &quot;sees&quot; a low sugar or a rapidly
dropping sugar,  it releases adrenaline and other hormones
into my blood which induce a chemical panic attack.

It is important to understand the hypothalamus panic attack
hypo because you can train your hypothalamus to regard
normal,  or even high sugars as &quot;too low&quot;.      The docs say
that 70 is a normal sugar.    If you have panic attack hypos
at sugars higher than 70, odds are that you have trained
your hypothalamus to see normal sugars as &quot;too low&quot;.

The second hypo is a real hypo caused by a lack of sugar in
the brain. Some symptoms include numbness of the tongue
and/or lips,  stupidity,  (I'm not drunk and stupid,  I just
need a cookie&quot;), cold sweats,  difficulty seeing (large
green spots), and general difficulty in moving around.

The docs regard 55 as a reasonable boundary between &quot;low&quot;
and &quot;hypo&quot;.

I carry the U.S. candy &quot;Smarties&quot; at all times.   They are
cheap,  fast and come in convenient,  individually wrapped
rolls.   A single roll of Smarties rapidly kicks my bG up by
about 20 mg/dL.    It would raise your sugar by more
(depends on body weight).

Regards
Old Al'

Come on y'all. Alan made a really nice thread please don't argue.

Susan I understand why you don't archive. I have tried and google keeps
mine anyway :-)

If a person has ever been stalked they would understand. I know I do and

&gt; &gt;&gt;People come and people go and that's why it is ridiculous to choose
&gt; &gt;&gt;NOT to archive posts that might help those in the future.

&gt; &gt; It's a choice posters make for themselves, and there's nothing
&gt; &gt; ridiculous about it at all IMO. Same reason *some* people choose not
&gt; &gt; to post their pictures and things.

&gt; Posting a link to an article or the text of said article is not the same as
&gt; posting pictures of one's self.  If you add to a post some kind of personal
&gt; opinion or something that you'd rather not survive for others to see later,
&gt; I can understand it, but why would anyone post an informative non-opinioned
&gt; article but wish for it to not be archived?  It is -not- the same as posting
&gt; a picture.

I agree.  Choosing to not archive good information doesn't make sense.
But then again, it might be a good thing if the poster has a habit of
posting misleading or bad information.

&gt;&gt;I believe this isn't exactly correct. &quot;sky-high&quot; trigs are
&gt;&gt;more of an indication the person has consumed too
&gt;&gt;many high carbs.  I see this particularly with my blood
&gt;&gt;work when I've not been good and eat at home.  IR
&gt;&gt;is more indicative of a high C-Peptide.

&gt;Don't go overboard on this.  I have IR, and low values

Interesting. I also still have IR but now have good trigs -
but my trigs were very high at diagnosis. The IR improved as
my trigs dropped but it's not a linear relationship.

Were your trigs good at the time of your diagnosis?

It's a choice, which *is* the same thing I was talking about. A
personal opinion is one thing that doesn't need to be archived in the
first place, and as far as  non-opinioned articles go, anyone can find
those on their own, though it does take a little effort on the part of
the seeker.
