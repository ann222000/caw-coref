Five times more journalists have died in Iraq than in Vietnam

Since the beginning of the war in Iraq, 305 journalists
and media workers have died, 276 of them Iraqis

BY LISANKA GONZALEZ SUAREZ
Granma International staff writer

AS the war in Iraq launched by the United States and its allies enters
its fifth year, it is worth noting the number of journalists killed
while completing their mission to report on events occurring there.

That situation is unprecedented. In none of the other conflicts that
have ravaged the planet have so many correspondents and media support
personnel died. The number of 63 correspondents who died during the 20
years of the war in Vietnam, once described as the most bloody by
professionals in the field, now seems minor in comparison.

According to the BRussells Tribunal, up until October of 2007, more
than 300 journalists, cameramen, photographers and support personnel --
Iraqi nationals and from around the world -- have died in Iraq.

Occasionally statistics reported by the media and some organizations
contradict this figure since they refer only to non-Iraqi journalists,
while the highest number of professionals to have died are in fact,
Iraqi nationals.

If we adhere to the facts disseminated by this organization, during the
war so far, since it began in March of 2003, 276 Iraqi nationals have
been killed, including 160 reporters, 27 cameramen, six photographers
and 12 translators, with the balance comprised of support workers.

In addition, 24 foreign correspondents have died.

If five who died of non-violent causes are included, the number reaches
the astronomical figure of 305, 276 men and 29 women.

The most deadly years were 2006, with 89 colleagues lost, and 2007 with
78.

Despite the timid protests of some organizations that the lives of
those dedicated to informing the public should be respected, the
numbers have increased considerably since 2005, when journalists were
dying at a rate of three per month, breaking all known records.

To date, 18 of the 70 [sic; above it says 78 have died in 2007 so far
- -NYTr] who have died this year in the country were victims of direct
attacks by the U.S. occupying forces, prompting various international
organizations to demand protection, some of them calling on the United
Nations to undertake an investigation.

Being a correspondent, especially an independent one, and telling the
truth about what is happening within the country, is a death pass.
There are no guarantees for the lives of those covering the war,
especially those of Iraqi origin.

The long arm of criminals attacking journalists has now extended to
relatives, as was the case this week in Baghdad. The Network News of
Iraq, an independent entity, released a communication denouncing the
murder by an unknown group of 11 family members of journalist Dia al
Kauaz, the electronic dailys chief writer. The attack, according to
the report, was carried out Sunday morning, November 25, by five armed
men who entered the Kauaz household and riddled the entire family with
bullets; a number of women and children were among the victims.

Additionally, 62 media workers have disappeared, the majority of whom
were condemning the occupation. Many of them, of Iraqi origin, have
suffered an unknown fate.

Clearly, until the war is over, the fate of many disappeared colleagues
will not be known. Their names will join the other victims, including
hundreds of university professors, professionals and their families,
massacred as supposed &quot;insurgents.&quot;

During the War in Vietnam, the cities, like Saigon, were relatively
free from terrorist attacks similar to road side bombs. The civilian
population in the cities was predominantly supportive of the allied
presence in Vietnam In the field, journalists could assess the risks
involved in moving into an area in which combat was probable. In Iraq,
the casualties for Americans and journalists result more from planned
assassination in and around cities in the form of improvised exploside
devices. The population in and around cities in Iraq views the allies
as illegal invaders inimical to Islam with the result that they
support such assassinations of Americans and journalists. The
aforementioned differential characteristics of the war in Vietnam and
Iraq make appropriate safeguards for journalists very difficult to
plan or make while promulgating assasination attacks against the same
to a much greater degree than existed in Vietnam while making them
much more vulnerable to the same.
