MARUTI UDYOG

RESEARCH: CLSA (MARCH 15, '07)
RATING: OUTPERFORMER
CMP: RS 779 (FACE VALUE RS 5)
12-MONTH PRICE TARGET: RS 980

TALKS with passenger car industry dealers have revealed that retail demand
remains buoyant, unlike that in the two-wheeler industry. Led by this
momentum, Maruti Udyug (MUL) is expected to register a robust 25% growth in
its sales figures in February and March '07. With the success of its recent
launches, MUL's market share has gone up to 57%. With its dominance of the
car industry intact, the company remains well-placed to benefit from the
rising domestic consumption theme. MUL's expected March '07 sales growth
will be only 4% on account of high March '06 base. However, after factoring
this, (for the period February-March '07) MUL's volume growth rates will be
robust at 25%. Dealers indicate that company's new launch, the Swift Diesel,
is doing well. The model has a waiting period of more than three weeks. Post
the correction from recent highs, MUL now trades at 13.6x FY08CL earnings,
close to its historic average trading bands. The long-term growth prospects
for the car industry remain intact, with car penetration at India at an
inflexion point, considering robust GDP growth underway.

BIOCON

RESEARCH: MERRILL LYNCH (MARCH 14, '07)
RATING: BUY
CMP: RS 469 (FACE VALUE RS 5)
12-MONTH PRICE TARGET: RS 500

BIOCON'S custom research subsidiary, Syngene has announced an R&amp;D deal with
BMS. It is estimated to generate $15 million in revenues in FY09E and scale
up to about $25-28 million peak revenues by FY10E. This deal renders high
visibility to Syngene's earnings stream. The BMS deal involves setting up of
a dedicated R&amp;D facility with 400 scientists for its discovery and early
drug development needs involving about $20 million outlay. This could nearly
double Syngene's scientist strength by FY09E to 900 (from current 500). The
$25-28 million revenue estimate in FY10E assumes $60-70,000
revenue/scientist. The target price of Rs 500 per share is based on 18x
FY08E EPS, in line with the domestic pharmaceutical sector average. Biocon's
valuations, at 20x on FY07E and 16x on FY08E EPS, are currently at a slight
discount to the sector average. Following are the risks to the target price:
1. Higher than expected price erosion for Simvastatin and Pravastatin
supplies to the US market. 2. Lower than expected pick-up of insulin and
immunosuppressant sales to non-regulated/regulated markets. 3. Risk of
failure in research. 4. Severance of custom manufacturing tie-ups. 5.
Regulatory delays.

GUJARAT AMBUJA CEMENTS

RESEARCH: JM MORGAN STANLEY (MARCH 12, '07)
RATING: UNDERWEIGHT
CMP: RS 104 (FACE VALUE RS 2)
12-MONTH PRICE TARGET: RS 85

GUJARAT Ambuja Cements (GACL) is arguably the lowest-cost cement producer in
India. Inclusive of its stake in Ambuja Cements India, it has an annual
capacity of about 12.9 million tonnes. The Ambuja group has a strategic
alliance with ACC through a 13.8% stake. Faced by the bleak scenario of a
potential export ban, cement companies chose to accept the lesser evil of a
pricing freeze for the next 12 months. Thus, the cement sector on March 9,
'07, gave a commitment to the commerce minister that they would "hold the
price line" for the next 12 months, even if inputs (such as coal, power and
freight) become dearer. The sector has also committed to pass on any cuts in
excise duties to consumers. Thus, any duty cuts from the government (such as
the roll-back of the higher excise duties in the latest Budget) will not
benefit cement manufacturers. While advocating a positive stance for a
six-month period on pricing power before the capacity led downturn (in
FY09), the agreement between the sector and the government has ruled out any
price increases — and thus potential upwards earnings revisions — for 12
months. The move to hold pricing has negated the increased pricing scenario
that the market was starting to factor in. While stock prices had been
moving up on potential EPS upgrades in FY08, given the strong pricing power
in the sector, this move has resulted in a 5.6% decline in the EPS estimate
for GACL for FY08 (CY07).

GREAT OFFSHORE

RESEARCH: ASK RAYMOND JAMES (MARCH 15, '07)
RATING: BUY
CMP: RS 568 (FACE VALUE RS 10)
12-MONTH PRICE TARGET: RS 644

GREAT Offshore (GOFF) is India's leading integrated offshore oilfield
services provider (with a fleet size of 39 vessels) offering broad spectrum
of services to upstream oil and gas majors to carry out offshore exploration
and production (E&amp;P) activities. With the recent heightened offshore
exploration activities resulting in around $15-20 billion capex announced by
upstream majors like RIL, ONGC and GSPC, GOFF is expected to be a key
beneficiary, thus giving it a long-term visibility for sustained order
flows. GOFF is attractively valued at 10.1x FY08E earnings and 9.3x FY09E
earnings. With the diversified nature of fleet, largest fleet size, most of
the terms committed till FY10E, 35% CAGR in earnings for FY07-10E (27% for
FY07-09E) and low financial leverage, the stock is available at a very good
risk-reward ratio. Based on peer comparison, GOFF is valued at 11x FY09E
earnings, and the oneyear target price is Rs 644, offering an 18% upside
from current levels with a 'buy' recommendation.

MAHINDRA &amp; MAHINDRA

RESEARCH: EDELWEISS (MARCH 13, '07)
RATING: BUY
CMP: RS 731 (FACE VALUE RS 10)
12-MONTH PRICE TARGET: NA

MAHINDRA and Mahindra (M&amp;M) has agreed to acquire a 43.3% stake in Punjab
Tractors (PTL) from Actis and the Burman family at Rs 360 per share in cash.
M&amp;M will make an open offer for another 20% as per regulations. The total
cost of acquisition will be Rs 1,388 crore, including the open offer. M&amp;M
(along with its 100% subsidiary Mahindra Holding and Finance) will fund the
acquisition through a combination of its own cash resources and some amount
of debt. The deal, though prima facie expensive, is earnings accretive for
M&amp;M, and is good for both the companies as well as the industry. Edelweiss
estimates the acquisition (at 63.3% stake) will be earnings accretive for
M&amp;M for FY08 up to a debt level of Rs 700 crore. In the long run, the
biggest benefit from consolidation in the industry will come from market
discipline in the face of a sales slowdown. Edelweiss reiterates 'buy'
recommendation on M&amp;M.
