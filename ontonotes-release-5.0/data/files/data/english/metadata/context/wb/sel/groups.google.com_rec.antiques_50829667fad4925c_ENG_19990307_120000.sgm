&gt; I have a set of 4 cups and saucers that were made in Japan. It does not say

&gt; Value? Where I can learn more about them? Please email me.

"/> I think it's actually spelled moriage. And &quot;Nippon&quot; was the name used
on Japanese wares before 1912 (plus or minus a couple years); the
original poster's plates, marked &quot;Japan&quot;, are more recent than that.

The moriage dragonware was made and marked Nippon, Japan, Made in Japan, and
Made in Occupied Japan. It is still being produced today, and primarily sold
in gift or souvenier shops.
