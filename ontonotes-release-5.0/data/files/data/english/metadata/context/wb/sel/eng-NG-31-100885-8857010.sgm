Ever see an animal do something goofy and think, &quot;gosh, that was
stupid!&quot;? Believe me, I know I have and I'm sure many here have too...
In fact, I know the tables have been turned when I've sat there,
trying to stretch, do yoga or whatever and my cat gave me the look of
&quot;boy, you're one stupid hoomin!&quot; got up stuck his tail up in my face
and I'd be sitting there looking at cat butt. Here's the most ironic
thing though... I've born witness to one animal saying to another
animal, &quot;boy, you are really stupid!!!&quot; and get away with it!!! The
funny part was, it was Jager &quot;saying&quot; it to Shinobi!!! Several years
ago, my SO found this great stuffed toy bunny that's a dutch bunny....
perfect black and white. It looks so real!!! I know that Shinobi has
cautiously sniffed it and once he realized it was safe, he'd push it
over or wrestle with it. I swear, what a doofus! So last night, I was
clipping Jager's nails and checking his teeth and when I was done,
Jager got to play for about 45 minutes. After he zoomed and binkied
and played for a while, he sat really still. He looked just like that
stuffed toy bunny. Shinobi went up to Jager after having his snack or
whatever... and then began to sniff at Jager. I swear, you could see
the evil gleam in Jager's eyes... He just sat still... Shinobi
continued to sniff and Jager just stayed still. It wasn't until
Shinobi made this weird meowl and gently pawed Jager. Jager then
thumped and nosed Shinobi then went from being in his &quot;loaf bunny&quot;
position to full binky. Shinobi jumped straight up, made this weird
noise, his eyes got all wide, and ran... Ever see a cat try to run on
a wood floor? It has got to be the funniest thing in the whole
universe!!! The cat missed the first step to our spiral stairs, flew
up the second step and all the way up... I think he grew wings or had
a turbo jet pack on his back or something!!! it sounded like there was
a herd of elephants running through the house and all it was, was a 12
pound scaredy cat running from a little 5 pound rabbit!!! Well, Jager
decided the cat was a real wuss and cuddled up with the kids,
demanding more of the show, &quot;Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe&quot; on the
Discovery Channel. I think that he thought it was funny that Mike Rowe
was playing with bugs. After a few minutes, Shinobi made his way back
down the stairs, trying desperately to remain somewhat dignified,
after all, the &quot;toy bunny&quot; was alive! it wasn't his fault he squealed
like a little girl and went running like a little mouse with his tail
tucked between his legs! So he went back to where Jager was sitting
all cozy and watching TV... He stood at the edge of the carpet and
sniffed the air, he looked at the bunny and needless to say, the
mental image I got was hilarious... Jager, all buff and plumped up all
muscular with the Arnold Swartzenbunny accent... &quot;You came back for
more?&quot; and he's tossing Bunnitude and dirty looks at Shinobi...
Meanwhile, I see &quot;Clint Eastkitty&quot; looking at Jager... (ok, when have
you ever known Dirty Harry to back down from a fight? When have you
ever known Arnold Swartzenegger to back off??? HUH?!?! ACK!!!!!) so
Shinobi gets this attitude like, &quot;Go ahead... Make my day...&quot; and then
of course, Jager gets all &quot;Scarface&quot; and charges Shinobi... &quot;Say hello
to my leeeetle friend!!!!!&quot; yup, you guessed it... Shinobi took off
like a bat out of hell. He sat at the 3rd step down from the top of
our sprial stair case, glaring at Jager. Jager just sat looking at him
and I know that little fuzzbutt was laughing at that cat.... It was as
if you could hear him mocking the cat and saying, &quot;boy cat, you really
are stupid!!! I'm the one who's supposed to be afraid of you and yet,
you ran away from me!!!! Bwahahahahahahhahahahahahaaaa!!!!&quot; Yep, Jager
is a wicked little stinker... but he sure is cute!!! Poor Shinobi!!! I
think he needs to stay out of the cat nip, eh? &lt;weg&gt;

Baby Gekko, at no more than two pounds, used to terrify my roommate's cat,
Rolland.  Rolland.  20 pound cat.  Terrified of a two pound ball of black
fluff.

What power Gekko had!

Then again, Rolland was afraid of caterpillers.  He used to hide behind his
sister. Grandis.  Who was afraid a' nut'in.  20 pound Rolland, hiding behind
his &quot;big&quot; sister... 6 pound Grandis.

And yes, they were true littermates, too.

That's too funny! 2 pounds vs. 20 pounds.... LOL!!! I love it!! Oh the
power of the bunny!!! I watched the entire situation unfold and
considered a short story but then, why? Why not just put down what
happened rather than try to put myself into their paws and tell it
from their point of view? there's just no way to honestly know what in
the world they were thinking... all I know is that they had some sort
of odd exchange and now, Shinobi is scared of little Jager! HA! it was
truely something to see!
