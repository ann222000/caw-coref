A woman with an artificial arm has been given the sense of touch following a
pioneering operation to reroute some of her nerves. Claudia Mitchell, 27,
lost  her left arm in a motorcycle accident three years ago, but can now feel her
missing hand after having nerves from her lost limb rerouted to her chest.
Now, when she touches something with her artificial hand she can feel it
through a device attached to her chest.
During a four-hour operation, surgeons moved nerves from her shoulder, which
normally ferry signals from the hand to the brain, and redirected them to
muscles in her chest area.
Four months after surgery, a patch of skin on her chest was able to feel
touch, temperature and pain sensations as if they were coming from different
parts of her hand and wrist.
Mitchell has since tested a prototype of a prosthetic limb that gave the
sensation of her hand closing around objects and picking them up.
A similar operation was performed on 54-year-old Jesse Sullivan, who lost
both his arms to burns after touching an electrified cable. He is now able to
feel sensations in one of his hands lost in the accident.
The patients were treated by a team of doctors at the Rehabilitation
Institute of Chicago. Earlier this year, they reported landmark operations on  the
same two patients in which nerves were redirected to allow them to control  the
movement of an artificial limb by thought alone.
In those operations, doctors took nerves that previously controlled the
movement of the hand and arm and grafted them on to chest muscles. When the
patients thought about moving the arm, the nerves made the chest muscles twitch.
The muscle movement is picked up by sensors in the prosthetic limb, which
clenches or rotates accordingly.
Paul Marasco, a sensory neurophysiologist at the clinic, said the most recent
operations, which use a procedure called targeted reinnervation, give
patients  more natural control over their artificial limbs.
&quot;Current prosthetics don't really give any sensory information back to the
individual and that forces them to have to watch what they're picking up
instead  of feeling it. The neat thing about this is we are able to return a sense
of  touch through the normal nerve channels,&quot; Marasco said.
What is remarkable about the work is that it shows that nerves that have been
out of use for more than a year are still able to carry sensation signals
when  they are grafted on to new tissues.
The team are so impressed with the results that they have operated on two
further patients. Marasco said prosthetic limbs that can recreate a sense of
touch are expected to be widely available in two to four years.
Following their operations, both patients tested artificial limbs fitted with
pressure sensors that triggered devices on their chests that pressed on the
skin  to mimic different sensations.
&quot;Pushing on the chest gives them the sense their missing limb is being
touched and when we press it in appropriate ways, in relation to objects being
picked up with their prosthesis, it gives the impression they're gripping things
with their missing hand,&quot; Marasco said.
Using cotton-tipped probes, the doctors mapped out where on the patients'
chests they needed to press to recreate a sense of touch in various areas of the
hand. Some areas triggered a strong sense of pressure on the wrist, palm or
back  of the hand, while others created a tingling feeling over a larger part
of the  limb.
According to a paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, both
patients sensed touch on their chests, but as the pressure was increased,
they  felt the sensation in their missing limb too.
&quot;Down the road one of the ideas is that we put multiple devices on the chest
representing individual fingers - that's where we'd like to end up,&quot; said
Marasco
