*Good as Gold*
------------------------------
Once there were two sisters. When they were young, they loved eachother
very much. Their father was a strong handsome Muslim who worked as a
merchant. He owned a bakery. He made fine breads of all kinds, and cakes
that were fit for kings. He was a widow for a few years and thought
seriously about re-marrying. The girls needed a mother to look after them
and teach them all the things about being ladies.

Well, he meet many Muslimahs in his spare time but, none seemed quite right,
for his little daughters could not get used to the idea of another mother. A
their mother was kind and soft-spoken, she had hair the color of midnight.
She always told them stories, baked them their favorite cookies, and tucked
them in bed at night followed by a soft kiss.

There came the day the father met a lady. She was slender in size, tall in
stature, with piercing eyes, she was quite stunning and gracious. Or so he
thought. Soon they were married and the couple settled in to being a family.
When the Merchant went of fto work, the wife would begin a full tirade at
the daughters, &quot;pick up this&quot;, &quot;move that you lazy girls&quot;, &quot;bring my tea&quot;. The
girls were afraid of her so to please their father, they did what they were
told.

The girls did this for many years, until the day came when they were 16 and
17. They grew up to be just like their mother. They were beautiful, smart,
and often went to the Mosque to learn new Surahs. This made their father so
proud. But the wife was not. She became jealous at the attention the father
paid to his daughters. She schemed to have them sent away on the pretext of
them becomming Hafiz. Parting with his daughters almost broke his heart. It
seemed to make him less vibrant, and old.

Over the months and over the years, the Muslim came to know that the woman
he had married was a bad cook, housekeeper, and a slob. She never made her
prayers on time and spent many times with friends gossipping. Now it came a
day that the gossip got around to the humble Merchant. He was furious. He
went home to confront his wife, she had never seen him is such a rage.
&quot;Why&quot;, he asked, &quot;did you send my daughters away&quot;. Stuttering and stumbling she
said, &quot;They needed a good Islamic education and to be presentable young
ladies&quot;.

&quot;You lie he screamed, &quot;you were jealous of my love for them&quot;. &quot;You found out
that they would inherit the property upon my death&quot; &quot;everyone but me knew&quot;.
The wife studdered and in a voice that thundered, she said, &quot;, &quot;You are
weak, you give most of your earnings to beggars
and orphans&quot;, &quot;you treat them like family&quot;.,&quot;how pathetic&quot;.

&quot;By Allah, it is right to do good by them&quot;, why do you think you have lived
well and my poor daughters have not&quot;? &quot;They help me by carrying my goods
through the neighborhood to my customers.&quot; They never cheat me nor steal
from me.&quot; &quot;Unlike you, my dear wife&quot;. And in an arrogant and haughty
attitude she said, &quot;I never steal&quot;!

The merchant knew she stole from by all the gossip that went on. But he set
out to prove the truth. As he prepared to go to work, he placed a large bag
of gold in a hiding plase in the cottage yard. He knew she was watching him
hide the gold. as soon as he left, the wife began to pack her things, she
went to the wall and collected the gold. &quot;Look at all this fine shiney gold
that he has&quot;, He will never miss a few pieces&quot;. &quot;This will be enough to get
far away, she thought.&quot;

The merchant was at the Mosque praying as he did everyday. He ask Allah to
keep safe his two beautiful daughters, and deal justly with his wife. He
went to his shop and started his daily work. On a whim, he sent one of the
beggars to his house with fresh bread and cheese. The house was empty, gone
were all the furnishings of his first wife, the beggar hurried back to the
merchant with the news!

&quot;My brother&quot; there is no seat nor furnishings, you have been robbed&quot;! His
plan had worked. He immediately sent for the authorities. But to his
surprise, his wife was already arrested. He inquired of the nature of the
arrest. It seems that she was using fake gold to make purchases.
The merchant did not feel the least bit of sorry for her. She got what she
wished for. All of his belonging were returned to him. And when he returned
home, he found two beautiful ladies who reminded him of their mother.

They helped their father at his shop everyday. They went home to pray and
prepare the meals.
When their father returned home, they both took turns reciting to him the
Qur'an. &quot;What good daughters you are&quot;, he said. &quot;Abi, none is good but
Allah&quot;!! His heart seemed to grow bigger with these words. Year later, the
old merchant passed away. The daughters were very sad.
They prepared his Janazah and all the people he had helped came to wish him
a good end.

He had promised his daughters to that Sheik who had two sons. They too were
also Hafiz, Mashallah. The daughters were pleased with their father's choice
for them. The sheik treated them like his own daughters. The sons worked in
the merchants shop while the daughters tended the houses. The sheiks wife
who was away all this time finally returned home. Upon her arrival, she went
to great her new daughters, and to their suprise, she resembles their own
mother! She had a very kind face and hair that was black as midnight!!
Subhanallah, the daughters were more happier than they ever thought they
could be!!

Epilogue: The gold in the wall was discovered by the sheik with a note that
read, &quot;The gold on the bottom is real, please see to it that my daughters
recieve it as it is their inheritance from me and their mother&quot;! It was
enough to make them wealthy until they reached old age!

The gold that was stolen from the top was the fake gold. Had the second wife
taken the whole bag, she would have been very rich. She was released from
jail, and soon after, she died. The daughters gave her a proper Janazah!

MORAL: Never take what you haven't earned.

What happens next...?
