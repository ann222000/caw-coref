Hello,

I'm from Belgium and I plan to travel in USA.
Ammo in my country is quite expensive.
I legally own guns here in Belgium.
Can I buy ammo in USA with a belgian licence ? And carry it by plane in my
luggage ?

Thanks for your informations (and sorry for my average english)

In the U.S. , regulations governing the purchase of Ammo vary from
State to State,
even from city to city, and sometimes even with the type of ammo
purchased.
In N.Y. City or Washington D.C. ....forget it.
Some require no identification at all, some require a license or ident.
As to carrying the stuff on a commercial flight, consult the airline
involved.
It won't be allowed as carry - on luggage, but properly packed, most
will permit it.
Get a WRITTEN copy of the carriers regulations and carry it with you as
in the
current political enviornment, the first reaction of any clerk is
likely to be
"NO ...HELP! ..TERRORIST! ..TERRORIST!".
As to getting it through Belgian Customs, .......you're on your own.

I think that this would be a question best asked of a Belgian lawyer as
to whether you are legaly allowed to privately import ammunition.
It shouldn't be any problem buying ammo in the USA (depending on state
and local laws).
It would be best to consult with a lawyer in the part of the USA that
you're going to visit and with the ATFE on what is required to be done
to allow transport of ammunition on an airliner, if you're actualy
allowed to do so.
The real problem will probably arise when you get to the airport and try
to transport it through customs.
Please don't try this without propper legal advice.

Buying it here shouldn't be the problem.  Transporting it internationally
and importing it into your country seems like the big issue.  If you can
afford to fly, you may simply be better off buying it at home for a higher
price.

The first question to answer is which states are you going to visit.
That will tell you what the restrictions are on ammo purchase
The next are
If Belgium allows to be brought back, and in what quantities.
What are the regulations and restrictions of the airline you are using

One thing to consider is getting the most inexpensive hunting license for
the states you may visit
Then you might have an easier time buying and bringing back the ammo.

In Kansas, you don't have to have anything to buy ammo... except ID if
you're a teenager.   Gotta be 18 for ammo for a rifle, 21 for handgun
ammo.   so, you can definitely buy it in this state and you can shoot
it anywhere in the US.

What you're talking about doing is, well, just kinda ridiculous to save
a couple bucks.  If you're planning on buying ammo here and taking it
overseas just to save a couple bucks, you're going to at least make
people in line at the airport wait for a while they try to figure out
if what you're doing is ok or not.

Someone in the freight industry could probably offer more tips than I
can on this, but I think loaded ammuntion has to be shipped by ground,
or maybe it's just primers... I don't know for sure.

Sorry that you live in a country where ammo is expensive.   On the
bright side, you're next to holland where I hear you can do pretty much
anything.   Is it true that they have urinals in the streets because of
all the drunks?  always wondered if that was true.

I solved that problem. I bought my own plane. No one asks me what I'm
carrying on board (other than customs).

Also, for the Original Poster, keep in mind that non-resident hunting
licences are not considered cheap.  In Washington, for example, you move
the decimal point over one place for non-residents (10x the cost of a WA
resident licence).  Don't forget the hunter safety class.

Whilst it is quite likely that many gun stores won't care about you
buying ammo, strictly speaking it is unlawful for non-resident aliens
to purchase or acquire firearms or ammunition inside the U.S.
Others reading this thread should note that many commercial airlines
impose a limit of 5lbs gross weight for ammo in checked baggage.
(Easyjet here has 5kg)

I don't want to muddy the waters here, but I believe that if
a non-immigrant alien is in possession of a valid hunting
license or permit from one of the states of the United
States, then they are permitted to buy ammunition. However,
as others have noted, the individual states also have a say
in whether a non-immigrant alien may purchase ammunition in
their state.

Also exceptions for those entering the country for purposes
of a shooting competition, diplomats, foreign law
enforcement entering the country on official business, or
persons who may have received a waiver from the Attorney
General's office.

Actually, he's saying you're good at fellatio...

No, not really. "Fella" is a shortened version of "fellow".

You obviously speak/read/write English very well.  However, to learn all
the colloquialisms of the "American" language can be intimidating.

I remember an Australian bloke (that's Oz for man) that had a hangar
across from me at the local airport.  He came over one day saying, "hey,
Mate, you got a spanner I could borrow?".  My first thought was that I
wasn't his kind of man if he thought I wanted to mate with him and the
second thought was, "What the Hell is a spanner?".

Once we sorted out what he meant in American we became pretty good
buddy's.  That's "friends" in American by the way.

It is a misspelling of the word "fellow" based on a colloquial

It's a friendly form of "fellow". Sort of the equivalent of
"chap" in England.
