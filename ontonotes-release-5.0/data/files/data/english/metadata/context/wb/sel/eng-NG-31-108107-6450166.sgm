Rat poison found in now-recalled pet food ALBANY, N.Y. - Rat poison
has been found in pet food blamed for the deaths of at least 16 cats
and dogs, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Agriculture and
Markets said Friday.

Spokeswoman Jessica Chittenden would not identify the chemical or its
source beyond saying it was a rodent poison.
ABC News reported it was aminopterin that may have been on imported
wheat used in the pet food. Aminopterin is used to kill rats in some
countries but is not registered for that use in the United States,
according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The chemical, also a
cancer drug, is highly toxic in high doses.

Officials from the agriculture department and Cornell University's
Animal Health Diagnostic Center would not immediately confirm the ABC
report but scheduled a news conference Friday afternoon to release
laboratory findings from tests on the pet food.
The Food and Drug Administration has said the investigation was
focusing on wheat gluten in the food. Wheat gluten itself would not
cause kidney failure, but the common ingredient could have been
contaminated by heavy metals or mold toxins, the FDA said.

State and FBI officials said they knew of no criminal investigations
in the case.
The pet deaths led to a recall of 60 million cans and pouches of pet
food produced by Menu Foods and sold throughout North America under 95
brand names. There have been several reports of kidney failure in pets
that ate the recalled brands, and the company has confirmed the deaths
of 15 cats and one dog.

Menu Foods last week recalled "cuts and gravy" style dog and cat food.
The recall sparked concern among pet owners across North America. It
includes food sold under store brands carried by Wal-Mart, Kroger,
Safeway and other large retailers, as well as private labels such as
Iams, Nutro and Eukanuba.
Menu Foods is majority owned by Menu Foods Income Fund of
Streetsville. The company also makes foods for zoo cats, but those
products are unaffected by the recall.

The company's chief executive and president said Menu Foods delayed
announcing the recall until it could confirm that the animals had
eaten its product before dying. Two earlier complaints from consumers
whose cats had died involved animals that lived outside or had access
to a garage, which left open the possibility they had been poisoned by
something other than contaminated food, he said.
Menu Foods planned a media teleconference for later Friday, a
spokesman said.

A spokesman for New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said he was not
aware of any criminal investigation involving the tainted food. FBI
spokesman Paul Holstein in Albany said Friday he was not aware of any
FBI involvement in the case.
"I don't know where we'll go from here," he said.

A complete list of the recalled products along with product codes,
descriptions and production dates was posted online by Menu Foods. The
company also designated two phone numbers that pet owners could call
for information: (866) 463-6738 and (866) 895-2708.

On the CBC evening news here in Canada, (and I don't want to start a
knee-jerk reaction here), they said the wheat gluten was sourced in China.
Now depending on your political orientation you will blame the Chinese or
suspect that someone contaminated the food to discredit the Chinese.  We
may never know, but it's interesting how the layers are coming off the
onion as more and more info comes to light.  Did they not mention the China
connection in the States?  It was on the 9:00 o'clock news, Eastern time,
here in "Catnada."

Buried a 14 year old tabby in December 06 from a sudden and rapid
kidney failure.  She ate Iams and Fancy feast and I noticed she seemed
to dislike the gravy style food and we bought it a couple of times by
mistake and expectde her to eat it anyway.

Got the vet bills and grave in the yard to prove it.  They say it
started as early as December but I strongly suspect it was almost
certainly in the food chain as early as October or November and my
last tabby Rosie went out fast because she was not a strong or young
kitten anymore.

They a full of poop if they are trying to say they have no clue.  They
have lots of clues but they want to sift through them and spin it in
the best possible light for themselves.  When we look at the salaries
of execs in this country and then for them to allow something like
this to happen, they deserve proper penalties to offset the huge
rewards they normally enjoy.

Now I have to worry that my new cat was given any of the leftover food
because I never suspected premium IAMS would be on the cat killer
list.

Before you come down too hard on Iams beer in mind this stretched
across NINETY+ brands.    Iams plus 89 other brands at least.

Before you blame IAMS the ultimate responsibility is the supplier in
China.   Menu foods may have been a victim of choosing the wrong
supplier. (Bear in mind too sometimes these ingredients are only
availalbe from two mfg. so if one mfg. is down for whatever reason
the only other option is this one company in China.

So before you blame IAMS remember the other 89 brands that
also used this ingredient incuding Science Diet, Purina,
and many others.

As far as whether you're cat was victim of this, i'd start with
your vet.  Maybe you're vet could shed light on whether you could
prove a connection?

It may be somewhat pricey to check it out but for peace of mind
you might want to pursue it further.   I know if it were my cat
i'd feel obligated to pursue it further.

One thing i'm wondering after the 90+ brands of moist food are
removed the shelves is there anything left?

(I'm fortunate that all my cats only do dry food.   My oldest has
never tolerated moist food.)

But i'd want further details before blaming IAMS/science diet/
purina and the other 87 brands.    After all it comes down
to a question of who knew what when.

(I'd add that is probably sheer luck that New York officials
stumbled on what the ingredient was.)

The US is importing an increasing amount of food from abroad,
especially from places with much lower safety standards, like Chile
and Mexico.  I think people ought to rethink this dangerous policy.

MY personal problem with Menu Foods is that they SAT on their info.
for, some reports have said, as many as two weeks before they
announced any kind of a problem with their food.  To me, that's
inexcuseable.  You can want to track down the source of the problem
all you want and make sure it's not something else before you release
ALL the information to the public about the contaminated food, but at
least tell your damn consumers that there IS a problem in the first
place.  The fact that MF didn't do even THAT much is garbage, plain
and simple.

Also, according to published news reports, Menu Foods learned of the
problem after something like 9 cats got sick and died during routine
taste testing.

Er... 'scuse me, but wouldn't a frickin' red flag go up after the
first ONE OR TWO deaths (certainly by the THIRD one, I would
think!)???

There are a lot of angry pet owners across North America right now,
and there should be.  We have a right to be angry.

Menu Foods messed up and didn't handle this recall right from start to
finish.

Do I feel bad that they may have gotten the screws put to 'em by a
faulty supplier?  Sure, I do.  However, when you sit on something of
THIS magnitude for weeks and let pets die before you go public with
ANY sort of information about a potential problem, then YOU are just
as culpable in my book as the supplier of the defective product is.

I don't want to be in a position to defend menu but you've never
worked in retail have you?  The problem could be anywhere in a
long chain.   From the factory to the warehouse, the entire
distribution system, the retail warehouses, the retailer, etc.
The problem (if there is one could stretch anywhere along the
chain.  Remember the Tylenol scare? That occurred on the shelf
at the store.

Yup, that's the Real Question, regardless of whether or not aminopterin
is the ultimate cause. They still let something slip by them that
shouldn't have.

I've been wondering for a couple hours, if MF goes under the weight of
the pressure they are going to face, and have to cease operations, what
are all the big brand names going to do?

This isn't bad grain, this is a human produced specific poison.

I have to watch code dates, product condition, source of product etc.  I

from my jobsite, it wouldn't take two weeks for the word to get out.

It was two years ago and the problem is solved already, but thanks for

Please note that I *never* overfed; it was the content of the feed

much grain products in his diet - and it was my vets recommendation to
cut them out. My older female seems to tolerate such just fine, but
Bandit did not.

You weren't around for the Tylenol scare were you?  Something like
this could have put in any where along the line, as Tylenol and
other companies have found out the hard way.  That is why they
have the caps they do on many products.

If you want to extort money from a corporation tainting a product
is one place to start.  A number of cases have occurred over the
years.

Too many corporations have learned that lesson the hard way.

But the question is who knew what and when did they know it?

Bear in mind there is a long chain of events that occur from
the mfg. to store shelves.

I'd also add that Menu foods is in Canada subject to Canadian law.
And the supplier is in China subject to China law.  There are many
questions to answer before convicting them.

This may well have been mishandled but someone needs to prove that
in a court of law.

I wonder if we get the gluten from China, or just the wheat, and then we

china, and not getting wheat from China.....Doesn't the US make more wheat
than like, everybody?
My guess is that we send the wheat to China, and they turn it into
gluten (whatever that is) and then send it back....I know we do this with
olives and olive oil. Most olives are grown in California. We then ship them
to Italy, where they make the olive oil, and then send it back to us in
fancy bottles labeled, "Italian Olive Oil". (In Italian, of course)
But if we grow the wheat here, then why would the Chinese contaminate it
with rat poison? One would think that we would contaminate it with the rat
poison if anybody is going to do so at all......Do the rats wait until it is
on Chinese soil before they eat it?

Sorry, but that's too easy a statement to make. Nobody in higher management
(and that would include you if you were at that level) is going to

I haven't seen any official reports on the distribution either, it's
mostly just my feeling after reading hundreds of articles this week. The
reported cases are very widespread, sometimes with cities very near each
other having vastly differing case loads. That says to me that the
distribution of the toxin was at least at the factory level or above.

Google "pet food recall" sometime and sort the results by case dates,
then look thru them and note the cases by city; you might see the
patterns that way. Lots of stuff to sort thru and much repetition - no
doubt someone with better skills and tools is already looking at this
already, but to me it seems obvious *shrug*

We wait and we see... and we hope, eh? If it was a retail level lone
nutcase the reports should die down relatively quickly after the recall.

That could be, but we are talking about a commercial product here....And one

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd point out the same thing happened to Tylenol and they survived.

&gt;&gt;And it did usher in a new era of safety measures for the entire drug and
&gt;&gt;food industry. It's highly likely this current pet food fiasco will do the
&gt;&gt;same thing. There's just too much big business money involved for them not
&gt;&gt;to.

&gt; It also ushered in a rash of product contamination cases, some even in
&gt; sealed containers.

&gt; Bear in mind there are products that have several seals
&gt; on the package and the bad guys have still been
&gt; able to contaminate them.

&gt; Bear in mind this moist food is already in sealed cans or sealed
&gt; pouches.
">

Yes, and this is precisely why the contamination didn't happen anywhere in
the distribution system, or at the retail level. It had to take place either
in the factory, or before that, at the ingredient level. I think they
already know that it was in the wheat gluten that they get from China....

I wonder why they don't put "wheat gluten" in dry cat food? Or, if they do,
why doesn't it come from China too? Or, if it does, why isn't it

&gt;&gt; The US is importing an increasing amount of food from abroad,
&gt;&gt; especially from places with much lower safety standards, like Chile
&gt;&gt; and Mexico.  I think people ought to rethink this dangerous policy.

&gt;&gt; Your life and your loved ones lives are at stake.

&gt; What is the alternative? Manufacturing sufficient food on the North
&gt; American
&gt; continent for the North American public is probably impossible within a
&gt; realistic time frame and if it was possible, it would probably more than
&gt; triple the cost of what we pay now for food. Do you really think the
&gt; general
&gt; public would sit still for that? The truth is that we're too greedy and
&gt; selfish of a society deny ourselves the luxuries with have.
">

You may be speaking about the luxury to kill ourselves......I like foreign
food as much as the next person....I eat cheese from France and Denmark,
olive oil from Italy, caviar imported from Iran, and a host of other foreign
stuff. But I also pay my government a hell of a lot in taxes to police all
that stuff and make sure it doesn't contain rat poison. Obviously, my
government carries out this duty like they do everything else.....NOT!!

I believe Menu Foods only makes wet food.  I have several different types of
pet food in the house--dry and canned/pouched, none of them on the recall
list.  I've read a lot of labels in the past several days and in looking at
what I have, none of the canned products have wheat gluten (or any wheat
product, for that matter).  Most of the dry food I have does contain wheat
gluten--it's hard to know what to feed them!

Yes. - I have been feeding them roasted whole body chickens....I can get
them on sale for 69 cents a pound, and I  take them home and cook them, and
then cut them up for the cats. I also feed them canned people tuna fish. The
problem is, they are outside cats, and I haven't any control over what the
neighbors feed them....So, I am watching them closely for signs that they
are sick......

Yeah, and they've got a hell of a nerve complaining. The wheat, corn,
