My buddies razzed me so much in the other newsgroup about the FX 5200
that I picked up a Quadro4 card yesterday from a PS show vendor for a
very modest sum of money. Am looking through the DRIVERS area of
nvidia.com and came up with v91.36 Forceware.

Not sure what model of Quadro4 this is?  It say Model: P80 on the back.
Are the v91.36 drivers ok?  How to tell if it's a Quadro XGL series?
Only other choice is Quadro4 Go.

Thanks.. I'll be popping it in now and installing drivers.   :))

What can be expected when going from a FX 5200 to a Quadro?  It's
a MUCH bigger card (taller and longer) with lots of caps and coils, etc.

Well, the 700XGL is based on the GeForce4 Ti 4200 series. Although DX8.1 and
AGP4X, it's a better card than a 5200 series. If you do a lot of Autocad,
workstation graphics, rendering, etc it's a better card. For gaming it's
worse (although a 5200 is at the bottom as well) and for web browsing, word
processing and other general productivity no difference. Not much difference
in Photoshop or digital video editing either, for that matter. The reason to
go to a Quadro card is better visual fidelity and stability in workstation
graphics and autocad type programs...they make poor 3D gaming cards, which
are optimized for speed.

Thanks for that. The next question was going to be &quot;what version of
DirectX is supported by the Quadro4 700 XGL?&quot;  My application is for
FlightSim and other games like Motocross Madness 2. Also the main-
board slot is an AGP 2x but keyed the same. Here's the control panel:

http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bertp/Quadro4_700_XGL.gif

It's installed with v91.36 and tested on MM2, running on graphics
quality 8 out of 10. What features would be lacking in DX9?  I have
fuselage reflections turned off (and alpha layers removed) from
FlightSim 8.

Well, not really. Quadros indeed are great gaming cards, even when they
usually are a few % slower than the comparable Geforce models. Of course
it's silly to buy a Quadro just for gaming, but basically they are as
good as Geforce cards when it comes to running games.

That depends on the software.

Basically, you have a Geforce4 Ti 4200 as Augustus already told you, so
for your Quadro4 700XGL the same like for the Geforce4 Ti 4200 is valid.
If a game runs with a GF4 then it will do so with the Quadro4, if not
then it also won't run with your card.

MM2 was released in 2000 and is a DX7 game. I would imagine you can max
every option on this one without difficulty. FS 2002 is a DX8.0 game with
pretty low requirements. Your card should run it without issues with
fuselage reflections and other options on. Assuming you're not at 1600x1200
or something like that. As for you other question, and being overly
simplistic here, DX8 is the first one to have far more  realistic
reflections and lighting. DX9 improves on this more....you can see heat
rippling/wavering  effects, very realistic shadows and light mapping, etc. I
always found that the most dramatic jump in &quot;wow&quot; factor was from DX7 to 8.
Next is DX8 to DX9. The least is DX9.0c to DX10....at least with what's
available hardware wise today.

Thanks aGaiN for that too. What if I was to pull the Quadro and put the
FX 5200 back? That's a DX9 card, yes? They both have 64MB of vRAM
however the Quadro is almost twice a big. It extends back into the PC
until its rear edge is interfering with the HD ribbon cables. Not sure
how much DC power it used from the power supply, but it DOES have a
DVI port and I'm going to buy a DVI cable and connect it to the Samsung
LCD panel. That should be an improvement over the FX 5200. The Sim
buddies say that FX 5200 sux. I only paid $12.50 for it on ebay.   :))

This is very good to know. What about the step from FS2002 to FS2004
as far as DirectX goes?  Running in 1280x1024 here.

With a 32MB TNT2 video card in FS2002, I had to strip mips, resize
textures from 1024x to 512x, and save as DXT1 with alpha layer flushed
white to get any decent clarity and framerates.

There's a quantum level of difference between a TNT2 card and a Ti 4200
card. FS2004 is 4 years old, but is a DX9 title with way more eye candy and
system resources. Running a DX9 title in DX9 mode on an FX5200 will be a
slide show. Your Quadro will do it better. There are 64bit and 128bit 5200
cards, with differing GPU and memory speeds, so I've no idea which one you
have.I've never used either FS programs, but a DX8.1 card will run in
compatability mode for DX9. FS2004 on a dual 500Mhz Xeon workstation will be
something of a disappointment no matter what the videocard. FS is very CPU
dependent.

I know you're talking about the Quadro running FS2004. I can assure you that
FS2004 will be a slide show, not because of the Quadro card (which is quite
capaple of running it in DX8 mode) but because of the speed of your
processor and motherboard. FS2004 is not dual processor capable. A PIII 500
Xeon with 512K L2 running at 250Mhz and ECC PC100 SDRAM is the right at the
very bottom of minmum system requirements. FS2004 is very CPU
intensive....you just don't have the power. Your system is state of the art
for Quake II......not trying to be a jerk here, but your system is really
ancient for these kinds of sims. Stick to FS2002 until you do a major
upgrade is my advice. But it's you're time and effort....load up FS 2004 and
see what happens.

&gt;processor and motherboard. FS2004 is not dual processor capable. A PIII 500
&gt;Xeon with 512K L2 running at 250Mhz and ECC PC100 SDRAM is the right at the
&gt;very bottom of minmum system requirements. FS2004 is very CPU
&gt;intensive....you just don't have the power. Your system is state of the art
&gt;for Quake II......not trying to be a jerk here, but your system is really
&gt;ancient for these kinds of sims. Stick to FS2002 until you do a major
&gt;upgrade is my advice. But it's you're time and effort....load up FS 2004 and
&gt;see what happens.

All true. I'm the low-end holdout and minimalist in the FS group.
You'll see some astonishing Simulator views HERE from the museum piece
with 500MHz CPUs and TNT2 AGP: http://www.flickr.com/photos/flightsim

FS min specs: http://mywebpages.comcast.net/flightsim/sim_specs.gif

While we're at it, can we nail-down the video requirements for FS2002,
FS2004, and FSX in this discussion?

*  FS2002 is DX8
*  FS2004 is DX9
*  FSX is  ??  (and multicore enabled)

What are some `low end´ and `optimum´ nVidia boards for these Sims?

-G

btw.. this table was the PREDICTED requirements for FSX. Note the weak
video specs. http://mywebpages.comcast.net/flightsim/Sim_specs_FSX.gif

&gt; brought the following to our attention:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hold it.. the 5200 is DX9, yes?  I'm asking about the Quadro4 running
&gt;&gt;&gt; FS2004. I'll be trying it out [the Quadro] with FS2002 soon. What about
&gt;&gt;&gt; attempting to run FS2004 (DX9) on the Quadro (DX8.1)? Are you saying
&gt;&gt;&gt; it will be a slide show?  If so, then maybe I'll forgo the whole thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Recall I've been running FS2002 for years on a 32MB TNT2 and dual 500
&gt;&gt;&gt; MHz Xeons with mips stripped and textures converted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A dual PIII 500 Xeon Dell workstation isn't just a little bit behind the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;curve. It's basically a museum piece.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you!    :))

&gt;&gt;I know you're talking about the Quadro running FS2004. I can assure you
&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;FS2004 will be a slide show, not because of the Quadro card (which is
&gt;&gt;quite
&gt;&gt;capaple of running it in DX8 mode) but because of the speed of your

FSX is multicore enabled ,DX9.0C and again, highly CPU intensive. I'd be
looking at an 8800GT and an E6600 with 2 Gig of RAM for a really goot
experience with it. This is a reasonably future proof system....for a while.

FS2004 is DX9.0 and CPU intensive, not multicore enabled. Any decent A64 CPU
or P4 Northwood above 2 Ghz should be fine. A 9800 Pro or 6600GT should be
just fine.

Your card is fine for 2002.....something in the Coppermine line above 733Mhz
should do for CPU duties.

Yes, but it's slower than the Quadro4.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They both have 64MB of vRAM
&gt; however the Quadro is almost twice a big. It extends back into the PC
&gt; until its rear edge is interfering with the HD ribbon cables. Not sure
&gt; how much DC power it used from the power supply, but it DOES have a
&gt; DVI port and I'm going to buy a DVI cable and connect it to the Samsung
&gt; LCD panel. That should be an improvement over the FX 5200. The Sim
&gt; buddies say that FX 5200 sux.

After todays standards, they are right. But after todays standards your
system sux ;-)

For your system the Quadro4 is probably the better choice. DX9 doesn't
offer you anything on your system, and the Quadro4 is faster. So I'd use
the Quadro.

My workstation probably sux more, because soon after buying it in 1999
I upgraded the video card to a 32MB TNT2 (Diamond Viper 770D).

The Quadro will stay, and so won't the 610 for a while.   :))
