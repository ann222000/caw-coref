(BooiCopter) Re: old weathervane
Thanks for the support, Marianne. He made a lewd comment to me and sent
it privately...too chicken to post to the newsgroup.

I wonder how she knows it's not nice to post someone's email, but doesn't
know not to post FS ads on a discussion group. Maybe she only read part
way down the FAQ. (If at all).

I can't imagine what kind of &quot;lewd&quot; remark you could find to make about her
FS post. &lt;g&gt;

Besides, there's good lewds and bad lewds, maybe you should have given her
the good lewds first.

Well,I've thought about it and thought about it and I've finally figured
out what 'Clueless' is referring to as 'lewd'... Here is her original
post:

(BooiCopter) old weathervane
I have an old weathervane For Sale. It has a horse and the directions on
the swinging bar and a glass ball in the upright shaft.{ The shaft comes
to a point at the top.} Can send good digital pictures.
Thanks!
Kathy

So, I sent her her an e-mail addressed to Clueless AOLer and said,&quot; The
shaft comes to a point alright&quot;.... &quot;MEANING&quot;, that 'the shaft' was
given to r.a and the 'point' was a FS Ad.
I included the FAQs url and got a reply that 'I'M' the clueless one
because I didn't put www after the html (I guess she meant http) and
that she couldn't click on the FAQs.She PUT her everloving WWW after her
html's &amp; http's and still couldn't locate our FAQs and said &quot;who needs
it anyway&quot;? (or something to that effect).
What she failed to report to everyone was my 'next' reply to her
'clueless e-mail' where I told het to wait until either her parents or
someone with a 6th grade education gets home to teach her how to access
the FAQs. I also told her that I assumed that she still had 49 1/2 of
her 50 Free AOL hours left and should learn how use newsgroups. She
still hasn't shown ME that she's not CLUELESS and my opinion hasn't
changed one iota (my first IOTA of 1999 &lt;G&gt;).
In case she's reading THIS,go look here :

OR, to make YOU happy :

OR :

Yeeehaaaaaaaa !

Maybe like that other nitwit, she figured you were ranting obscenely
when you shouted FAQ...?
