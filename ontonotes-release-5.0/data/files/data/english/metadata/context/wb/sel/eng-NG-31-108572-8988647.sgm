I was told that a line is composed of infinite number of points. But
this doesn't make sense to me. It is trivial to prove that two line
segments of different length have same number of points on them and as
well as different number of points at the same. I think it can also be
proved that all line segments are composed of just a single point and
multiple points at the same time.

One could ascribe all this ambiguity to the strange properties of
infinity and still believe that a line is composed of points. But I
disagree.

If a line is composed of an array of adjacent points, then what is in
between the two adjacent points? If there are no points between two
adjacent points, then they should in fact be just one and the same
point. Similar reasoning would collapse all adjacent points to a
single point. But this is not the proof for my statement above saying
a line could also be composed of single point.

The very belief that a continuum can be expressed as a set of points
seems fallacious to me.

So, any two different points will have infinite number points between
them on the line joining these two points. This rules out &quot;adjacency&quot;.
Because the adjacent points are different and hence separated by
infinite number of points between them. So the points are ordered, but
we don't have any adjacent pair of points.

If we take two elements from a finite ordered set we have 3 kinds of
possibilities - same, adjacent, non-adjacent. If we consider an
unordered finite set, then we have two possibilities - same,
different. The infinite ordered set (line) seem to have same
properties of finite unordered set. But this is false for an infinite
ordered set of, say, integers. We do have adjacent elements in this
set. However, continuum is different - it has order but no adjacency.
This sounds like continuum is not composed of any discrete parts, but
still divisible into any number of parts. The point of division itself
is not a part of the continuum.

So line is not composed of points in such way that it is divisible
into points. It is divisible at points but not into points. And when
we cut the line endlessly, what do these parts become? They still
remain line segments, but not points, simply because every division is
made at a different point which is separated by infinite number of
points from other division.

there lies trouble. the concept of &quot;adjacent&quot; points is a common

That's true. The notion of a line as a set of points seems fallacious to

here. A line is composed of points. Period. Nothing about adjacency.

YES YES YES! They are ordered, in the sense that given any two, one is
to the left of the other (imagining a horizontal line). This is
analogous to saying that given any two distinct real numbers, one is
less than the other.

But they are not &quot;well-ordered,&quot; which is a stronger condition. In a
well-ordered set, there's a first one, then the next one, then the next
one, and so on. (That is not the technical definition of well-ordered,
but it will do for this discussion.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes. A finite set is well-ordered. Some infinite sets are well-ordered
too, for example the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, ... In a well-ordered
set, you have the notion of adjacency. 2 is adjacent to 3, for example.
They are distinct, and there is nothing strictly between them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If we consider an

True. What you can do is choose an ordering. It's easy to choose a
well-order of a finite set.

yes, exactly. a continuum has no adjacency. That's not enough to define
a continuum though. For example the rational numbers have no adjacency
-- between any two rational numbers there is another rational number.
However the rational numbers are not a continuum. The extra condition a
continuum needs is &quot;completeness.&quot; The set of rationals is full of
holes, where the irrationals are. So you need to take the rationals and
the irrationals together to make a continuum.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This sounds like continuum is not composed of any discrete parts, but
&gt; still divisible into any number of parts. The point of division itself
&gt; is not a part of the continuum.
">

Well, you can choose to include the division point in one of the parts.
For example you can cut the real line at 0. Then you could say you made
two parts: all the numbers less than or equal to zero; and all the
numbers greater than zero. Or you could make three parts: less than
zero, zero, and greater than zero.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So line is not composed of points in such way that it is divisible
&gt; into points.
">

Well it is, actually. For example I can divide up the real numbers into
a whole bunch of individual points. Symbolically I can consider the
collection of all possible sets {a} where the symbol 'a' ranges over all
the real numbers. That's a whole lot of singleton sets, in other words
sets containing exactly one point each.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;It is divisible at points but not into points.
">

I don't know what that means. I believe I just explained how to
partition the line into individual points. Just put each point into its
own private bucket. Assuming you have a lot of buckets!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And when
&gt; we cut the line endlessly, what do these parts become?
">

Well if you divide a line in half, and in half again, dot dot dot, at
each finite step you still have a line. But the limiting process can
result in a point. In other words, here is a little thought experiment.
Start with all the points between 0 and 1 inclusive, denoted [0,1]. Cut
that in half, so we have the set [0, 1/2]. Cut that in half, and cut
that in half, etc. After each cut, we still have a line segment. But the
intersection of ALL the line segments consists of the single point 0.
That's one of the tricks mathematicians use to deal with the mysteries
you're interested in.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;They still

Yes, your understanding is correct. I think you understand all this very
well. It is a little mysterious, and it took mathematicians a long time
to invent set theory and the rigorous theory of real numbers. In fact
these things are very recent inventions, less than 150 years old. Before
that time, mathematicians were confused about exactly the same problems.

Proof that two line segments of different lengths have different
number of points on them:
---------
Given lines A and B.
Assumption: It is already proved that two line segments have equal
number of points on them irrespective of their length. Now cut A into
two parts A_1 and A_2, of non-zero length. According to the
assumption, A_1 has same number of points as B. Then all the points on
A_2 are extra to what we have on B. So initially A had more points
than B. Proof complete.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Consider the following -

.................   Line A
\             /
\           /
...........   Line B
\       /
\     /
\   /
\ /
.  Point P

Any line joining P with any point on A has a corresponding point on B.
This proves that A has as many points as B. Now make the line B
smaller and smaller by moving it closer to P and until it coincides
with P. The rule should still hold good. The number of points on A and
B should be equal. If the rule doesn't hold good, when exactly, while
moving B closer to P, did it stop being valid?

A lot of this stuff seems paradoxical at first. It is known to be correct,
because it can be proved from set theory.

A big part of this is defining exactly what you mean by the &quot;number of
points&quot; in a set. The paradox you have below stems from this. A set is not
assumed to be bigger than another just because you can pair the elements off
together and still have some left over. Its a little more subtle; one set is
said to be larger than another if you can pair all of the elements of the
smaller set with ones from the larger set, and also prove that there is no
possible way to do it in reverse. For finite sets, this new definition works
exactly the same; for infinite sets it gives the only real definition of the
&quot;number of points&quot; in a set that produces sensible mathematics.

You need to define exactly what you mean by a line.

One possiblitiy.

Start with the set of real numbers  (we can definine this
set in a number of ways which do not involve lines)

Define an ordered pair of real numbers, and let
R^2 be the set of all ordered pais or real numbers.

Let a point be an ordered pair of real numbers.

Let a line be the set of ordered pairs (x_i,y_i) that
satisfy (Ax_i + By_i + C)

Then a line is a set of points.  This set is
uncountable.

As to your contention that a line can be divided
at points but not into points.

A subset, S,  of a line will be called a segment, iff
S has at least two elements and if x and y are in S, then x+y/2 is
in S.

A line can be divided into a countable number of segments,
but not an uncountable number.

So a countable number of points can divide a line into
segments (by dividing at the points), but not into points.

However, an uncountable number of points can divide a line into
points.

So there is at least one sensible defintion of a line in
which a line can be divided into a set of points.

&gt; &gt; If a line is composed of an array of adjacent points, then what is in

&gt; &gt; The very belief that a continuum can be expressed as a set of points
&gt; &gt; seems fallacious to me.

&gt; &gt; So, any two different points will have infinite number points between
&gt; &gt; them on the line joining these two points. This rules out &quot;adjacency&quot;.
&gt; &gt; Because the adjacent points are different and hence separated by
&gt; &gt; infinite number of points between them. So the points are ordered, but
&gt; &gt; we don't have any adjacent pair of points.

&gt; &gt; If we take two elements from a finite ordered set we have 3 kinds of
&gt; &gt; possibilities - same, adjacent, non-adjacent. If we consider an
&gt; &gt; unordered finite set, then we have two possibilities - same,
&gt; &gt; different. The infinite ordered set (line) seem to have same
&gt; &gt; properties of finite unordered set. But this is false for an infinite
&gt; &gt; ordered set of, say, integers. We do have adjacent elements in this
&gt; &gt; set. However, continuum is different - it has order but no adjacency.
&gt; &gt; This sounds like continuum is not composed of any discrete parts, but
&gt; &gt; still divisible into any number of parts. The point of division itself
&gt; &gt; is not a part of the continuum.

&gt; &gt; So line is not composed of points in such way that it is divisible
&gt; &gt; into points. It is divisible at points but not into points. And when
&gt; &gt; we cut the line endlessly, what do these parts become? They still
&gt; &gt; remain line segments, but not points, simply because every division is
&gt; &gt; made at a different point which is separated by infinite number of
&gt; &gt; points from other division.

&gt; You need to define exactly what you mean by a line.

&gt; One possiblitiy.

&gt; Start with the set of real numbers  (we can definine this
&gt; set in a number of ways which do not involve lines)

&gt; Define an ordered pair of real numbers, and let
&gt; R^2 be the set of all ordered pais or real numbers.

&gt; Let a point be an ordered pair of real numbers.

&gt; Let a line be the set of ordered pairs (x_i,y_i) that
&gt; satisfy (Ax_i + By_i + C)

&gt; Then a line is a set of points.  This set is
&gt; uncountable.

&gt; As to your contention that a line can be divided
&gt; at points but not into points.

&gt; A subset, S,  of a line will be called a segment, iff
&gt; S has at least two elements and if x and y are in S, then x+y/2 is
&gt; in S.

&gt; A line can be divided into a countable number of segments,
&gt; but not an uncountable number.

&gt; So a countable number of points can divide a line into
&gt; segments (by dividing at the points), but not into points.

&gt; However, an uncountable number of points can divide a line into
&gt; points.

&gt; So there is at least one sensible defintion of a line in
&gt; which a line can be divided into a set of points.

Euclid has separate definitions of lines and points and then
definitions and properties.  Set theory has a line defined by its
points.  Rather, set theory is very useful in the logical implications
of inclusion, about whether a point is &quot;in&quot; or &quot;on&quot; a line, where all
the logical relations for prototypical points for showing properties
true for the same construct as a line are carried in the general
notion of set theory.

About lines having the same number of points, that is about how for
line segments that there are certain natural transforms of the lines
that correspond to transform of basis coordinates and there exist
those natural transforms for each pair of line segments.

About lines having different numbers of points, that's about those
transformations not in terms of translations and other gauge invariant
transforms.  As inputs to processes, for example from the even
integers to the integers, half of them are even, as points.

That is where the origin is 0 and also (0, 0, 0, ...).  In terms of
the origin, half of the integers are even.

Then, there can be considered prototypical points.  Yet, also
properties of the line are assumed to be true.  To actually prove that
the line and set of points said to comprise a line are the same thing
has for one thing that all the properties provable using set-theoretic
properties agree with an object given all the properties of a line, in
terms of the set-theoretic properties of the set called a prototypical
line.

The total ordering of the points of the line and properties of lines
under transforms that preserve the total ordering of partitions
maintain casually that the intermediate products are as well, totally
ordered.

Inserting probabilitistic reasoning and interval arithmetic seems
reasonable.  The properties of numbers are very absolute.

At least enough of those properties hold to make very direct proofs
using set theory about geometric figures in space.

&gt; &gt; If a line is composed of an array of adjacent points,

&gt; there lies trouble. the concept of &quot;adjacent&quot; points is a common
&gt; misconception. Between ANY two points on a line there is another point,
&gt; in fact an infinity of other points. There is no such thing as adjacency
&gt; when it comes to considering points on a line.

&gt; &gt; then what is in

&gt; there are no adjacent points. the concept of adjacency is meaningless in

&gt; &gt;If there are no points between two

&gt; &gt; The very belief that a continuum can be expressed as a set of points
&gt; &gt; seems fallacious to me.

&gt; That's true. The notion of a line as a set of points seems fallacious to
&gt; you. Letting go of the notion of adjacency is the path to understanding
&gt; here. A line is composed of points. Period. Nothing about adjacency.

&gt; &gt; So, any two different points will have infinite number points between
&gt; &gt; them on the line joining these two points.

&gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt;This rules out &quot;adjacency&quot;.

&gt; YES!!!

&gt; &gt; Because the adjacent points are different and hence separated by
&gt; &gt; infinite number of points between them. So the points are ordered, but
&gt; &gt; we don't have any adjacent pair of points.

&gt; YES YES YES! They are ordered, in the sense that given any two, one is
&gt; to the left of the other (imagining a horizontal line). This is
&gt; analogous to saying that given any two distinct real numbers, one is
&gt; less than the other.

&gt; But they are not &quot;well-ordered,&quot; which is a stronger condition. In a
&gt; well-ordered set, there's a first one, then the next one, then the next
&gt; one, and so on. (That is not the technical definition of well-ordered,
&gt; but it will do for this discussion.)

&gt; &gt; If we take two elements from a finite ordered set we have 3 kinds of
&gt; &gt; possibilities - same, adjacent, non-adjacent.

&gt; Yes. A finite set is well-ordered. Some infinite sets are well-ordered
&gt; too, for example the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, ... In a well-ordered
&gt; set, you have the notion of adjacency. 2 is adjacent to 3, for example.
&gt; They are distinct, and there is nothing strictly between them.

&gt; &gt;If we consider an
&gt; &gt; unordered finite set, then we have two possibilities - same,
&gt; &gt; different.

&gt; True. What you can do is choose an ordering. It's easy to choose a
&gt; well-order of a finite set.

&gt; &gt;The infinite ordered set (line) seem to have same
&gt; &gt; properties of finite unordered set. But this is false for an infinite
&gt; &gt; ordered set of, say, integers. We do have adjacent elements in this
&gt; &gt; set.

&gt; yes.

&gt; &gt;However, continuum is different - it has order but no adjacency.

&gt; yes, exactly. a continuum has no adjacency. That's not enough to define
&gt; a continuum though. For example the rational numbers have no adjacency
&gt; -- between any two rational numbers there is another rational number.
&gt; However the rational numbers are not a continuum. The extra condition a
&gt; continuum needs is &quot;completeness.&quot; The set of rationals is full of
&gt; holes, where the irrationals are. So you need to take the rationals and
&gt; the irrationals together to make a continuum.

&gt; &gt; This sounds like continuum is not composed of any discrete parts, but
&gt; &gt; still divisible into any number of parts. The point of division itself
&gt; &gt; is not a part of the continuum.

&gt; Well, you can choose to include the division point in one of the parts.
&gt; For example you can cut the real line at 0. Then you could say you made
&gt; two parts: all the numbers less than or equal to zero; and all the
&gt; numbers greater than zero. Or you could make three parts: less than
&gt; zero, zero, and greater than zero.

&gt; &gt; So line is not composed of points in such way that it is divisible
&gt; &gt; into points.

&gt; Well it is, actually. For example I can divide up the real numbers into
&gt; a whole bunch of individual points. Symbolically I can consider the
&gt; collection of all possible sets {a} where the symbol 'a' ranges over all
&gt; the real numbers. That's a whole lot of singleton sets, in other words
&gt; sets containing exactly one point each.

&gt; &gt;It is divisible at points but not into points.

&gt; I don't know what that means. I believe I just explained how to
&gt; partition the line into individual points. Just put each point into its
&gt; own private bucket. Assuming you have a lot of buckets!

&gt; &gt;And when
&gt; &gt; we cut the line endlessly, what do these parts become?

&gt; Well if you divide a line in half, and in half again, dot dot dot, at
&gt; each finite step you still have a line. But the limiting process can
&gt; result in a point. In other words, here is a little thought experiment.
&gt; Start with all the points between 0 and 1 inclusive, denoted [0,1]. Cut
&gt; that in half, so we have the set [0, 1/2]. Cut that in half, and cut
&gt; that in half, etc. After each cut, we still have a line segment. But the
&gt; intersection of ALL the line segments consists of the single point 0.
&gt; That's one of the tricks mathematicians use to deal with the mysteries
&gt; you're interested in.

&gt; &gt;They still
&gt; &gt; remain line segments, but not points, simply because every division is
&gt; &gt; made at a different point which is separated by infinite number of
&gt; &gt; points from other division.

&gt; Yes, your understanding is correct. I think you understand all this very
&gt; well. It is a little mysterious, and it took mathematicians a long time
&gt; to invent set theory and the rigorous theory of real numbers. In fact
&gt; these things are very recent inventions, less than 150 years old. Before
&gt; that time, mathematicians were confused about exactly the same problems.
">

Of course, you are assuming that the set of the reals with &lt; is
isomorphic to the spatial line with its spatial left-right order.

But can that be proved or is it rather a postulate?

We have two concepts of continuum: the intuitive geometric concept and
the algebraic proposed by Cantor, Dedekind, Cauchy...

Can we be sure they coincide?

Intuitively points are discrete and lines are continuous objects.
Intuitively the continuum cannot be built out of the discrete except
by turning previously separate parts into adjacent parts.

Thanks for the guidance. I understand that one of the necessary
conditions for showing a set is larger than the other is to show that
some elements in the first set don't have corresponding elements in
the second set. I realize this. We can't really prove that lines have
different number of points.

However I have a few more thoughts.

Two lines have equal number of points on them? I would say a line has
as many ways of dividing into two parts as any other line. I'm not
talking about the contents of the line, but ways of dividing its
contents. Ways of dividing contents are the same as content?

If you keep cutting a line at different places, will it be cut into
pieces of zero length? It is self contradictory, because when the
piece if of zero length, then it is not a result of cutting at
different places. So, this means we can't keep cutting at &quot;different&quot;
places. We'll start cutting at the same place when the number of cuts
are approaching infinity? Is it a blind belief, or common sense?

It seems to me that we are tying two unfathomable things (infinite
number of cuts and piece length becoming zero) together and hoping
that they somehow fit with each other. This works for all practical
purposes, but I doubt its validity for pure mathematics.

You might say that the cardinality of the set of all possible cuts of
a line is the same as some infinite number set. But which number set?
Integers, real numbers?

As Dave said, some rules stop being valid at limiting conditions. So
when I keep one end of the line fixed and keep moving second end
towards the first, the length keeps decreasing and becomes zero and
again increases while point moves to other side (or is it negative
length?) So it suddenly stopped being a line for a moment when the
length was zero. And the rules became invalid for that moment. May be
this is a problem is due to defining a line as a set of points?

Of course you do.  After all N cuts are done there are N line

The point 0 is what remains after all the line segments are

Correct.  The piece left over does not correspond to a cut.

There is a cut for each element of N.  There is no cut omega.
There are omega cuts, however there is no omega'th cut.

There is a completed set in which all the cuts have been completed.
But does that set consist of &quot;line segments&quot; or &quot;points&quot;?

Isn't a &quot;length&quot; the &quot;distance&quot; between two points?

A distance might be zero.

A line segment is determined by two points.

If the end points are two distinct points, then it seems that the
distance between them must be nonzero.

If the end points are not two distinct points, then how is this object
a line segment?

The distance along the number line between the points identified by
1/3 and 2/6 is zero.  There is no line segment on the number line
&quot;between&quot; the points identified by 1/3 and 2/6 -- they are the same
point.

If a &quot;point&quot; is identically the same as a &quot;line segment&quot; of &quot;zero
length&quot;, then a &quot;point&quot; would seem to be a redundant concept.

A &quot;piece&quot; which is a &quot;line segment&quot; of &quot;zero length&quot; seems to be a
contradiction in terms.

A line segment is a set of points.

After all cuts (omega cuts, one for each element of N)
have been completed we have
omega+1 sets of points.  One set of points is

segment is a matter of how you define line segment.

&gt;         .  Point P
">

And this already sounds like a TO/RF-style
argument that's appeared many times in the
various Cantor threads.

It appears that what the OP is trying to
argue something like this:

Assume that for every two real numbers a,b,
the interval [0,a] has the same cardinality
as the interval [0,b]. Then in particular
the interval [0,1/n] has the cardinality of
the interval [0,1/(n+1)]. This implies
(possibly by &quot;infinite-case induction&quot;) the
interval [0,0] must also have the same
cardinality as [0,1/n]. Since [0,0] clearly
has cardinality 1, therefore [0,1/n] must
also have cardinality 1. Thus all line
segments are a single point, which is an
obvious contradiction.

Once again, the OP wants to believe his
intuition, which is identical to the
intutions of both TO and RF -- namely, that
proper subsets of sets must have strictly
lesser cardinalities.

Ever since TO and RF first posted these
intuitive ideas, I've wondered whether one
can come up with a geometry -- using the
hyperreals of course -- in which the
intuitions of TO, RF, and the OP of this
thread are true.

We begin by considering the Dehn plane of
ordered pairs of hyperreals:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn_plane

Our model, however, won't be the full
Dehn plane, but a proper subset. We begin
by choosing a certain fixed infinitesimal,
which we might as well call iota (a la RF)
or Lil'Un (a la TO). Now we consider the
set of all ordered pairs of hyperreals
(a,b) such that there exist hypernaturals
A,B such that a=iota(A) and b=iota(B).

Notice that this set will not include, as
a subset, the standard plane R^2. However,
by gratuitous choice of ultrafilter, it is
possible to make this new set include Q^2
as a subset. We just choose an ultrafilter
that contains the following set:

{1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, ..., n!, ...}

(Why does this work? It's because any
rational number has a finite expansion in
the so-called &quot;factorial base&quot;:)

http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/FactorialBaseRepresentationOfFract...

Also, notice that for any point (x,y) in
R^2, there exists a point (a,b) in our
subset of the Dehn Plane in such that the
standard parts of a,b are x,y respectively.

Unlike in the standard Euclidean plane, we
see that points now have adjacent points,
such as (0,0) and (iota,0) for example. It
has already been mentioned that this cannot
happen in Euclidean geometry, but it is
well-known that the Dehn plane is not
considered Euclidean at all.

&gt; &gt; Yes, your understanding is correct. I think you understand all this very

&gt; But can that be proved or is it rather a postulate?

It depends on what you mean by the &quot;intuitive geometric approach&quot;. I
can't be sure that /your/ inutuition and /my/ intuition of these
concepts are the same!

It is true that, given the real numbers as they are usually defined,
the Cartesian plane obeys Euclid's postulates of plane geometry.

But it is not true that every collection of lines and points
satisfying Euclid's postulates of plane geometry are isomorphic to the
the cartesian plane.

For example, the collection of all points and lines which can be
finitely constructed using a compass and straight edge, given a pair
of points which are a unit distance apart, are a countable set of
points and lines that satisfy the (original) postulates.

But the set of points on the real line are uncountable; so these
systems can't be isomorphic. In particular, there is no /finite/
sequence of constructions using only the compass and straightedge
which allow us to construct a line segment of length pi.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Can we be sure they coincide?

&gt; Intuitively points are discrete and lines are continuous objects.
">

The terms &quot;discrete&quot; and &quot;continuous&quot; need to be defined /rigorously/
if we are to answer your questions.

&quot;Continuous&quot; might just mean &quot;infinitely divisible&quot;; or it might also
mean &quot;connected&quot; (in a very particular sense). These different
meanings give different results.

Euclid's postulates were a fantastically good start at formalizing
geometry. But there were missing statements: things that were assumed
to be true &quot;intuitively&quot;, but not stated as being true. For example,
that if a line exists then it contains at least two points is
&quot;obvious&quot;, but was not stated explicitly. More subtle things were
missing as well.

More rigorous versions of Euclid's original postulates have been
developed; for example by Hilbert:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms

Hilbert's axioms regarding &quot;continuity&quot;, in particular, the
&quot;completeness&quot; axiom, ensures that the result is &quot;complete&quot;: it must
be impossible to add further lines and/or points to the system without
&quot;breaking it&quot;, so that it fails to fulfill the other axioms.

The compass and straight-edge example I gave above fails to satisfy
this additional constraint: these points and lines are a subset of the
larger set of points and lines in the cartesian plane.

I'm pretty sure (but maybe I'm wrong!) that the completeness axiom
(along with the other axioms) allows us to prove that the &quot;geometric&quot;
line and the &quot;real&quot; line are, indeed, &quot;one and the same&quot;, once we
formalize our &quot;intuive&quot; notions as Hilbert et al have done.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Intuitively the continuum cannot be built out of the discrete except
&gt; by turning previously separate parts into adjacent parts.
">

But we needn't expect that the continuum be &quot;built out of&quot; any such a
thing at all.

The axioms tell us how the line can be /broken apart into/ certain
types of parts which satisfy a certain type of order (and thus
adjacency).

They /don't/ claim that there exists a set of indivisible discrete
parts, satisfying adjacency, and which the line can be /built up
from/; and indeed, we can prove that there is no such set.

I actually mentioned this example in one of the other

model, there exist two disjoint half-lines (i.e., rays
with no endpoints) whose union is the whole line. For
example, consider the half-line defined by x&lt;pi and

never intended for there to be two disjoint half-lines

Thanks for the link. I was reading about Hilbert's
axioms for the other Cantor threads, and I was
confused about this axiom. I thought that the
completeness axiom sounded as if the line needed
to be complete in the way that R is complete. I
must thank you for clarifying this for me.

I noticed this from the Wikipedia article in the
link you provided:

&quot;Hilbert's axioms do not constitute a first-order
theory because the axioms in group V cannot be
expressed in first-order logic. Therefore Hilbert's
axioms, unlike Tarski's, implicitly draw on set
theory and so cannot be proved decidable or complete.&quot;

This is highly reminiscent of PA, in which there
is a first-order axiomatization in which it is
possible for nonstandard natural numbers to
exists, and a second-order theory in which no
such naturals exist.

So apparently, in Hilbert's second-order
axiomatization, one can prove that the set of
points is equivalent to R^2 or R^3 (depending on
whether the 3D axioms are used), whereas there
are nonstandard models if only the first-order
axioms are used.

In particular, our &quot;point-and-compass&quot; model is
a countable model of first-order Hilbert. This
may suit the intuitions of WM and others who
believe that the real line should be countable.

If we denied V.1, the other second-order axiom,
then we have the Dehn plane of infinitesimals. I
already mentioned the Dehn plane in another post
in this thread:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn_plane

&quot;The Dehn plane consists of all points (x,y),
where x and y are finite hyperreal numbers. The
parallel postulate fails in the Dehn plane.

&quot;All pairs (x, y) where x and y are any members
of a hyperreal field F with the metric taking
values in F gives a nonstandard model of
Euclidean geometry.&quot;

So one must include _all_ hyperreals, not just
the finite ones, in order to obtain a
nonstandard model of Euclid/first-order Hilbert.

Notice that the subset of the Dehn plane I
mentioned in that post is _not_ a model of
first-order Hilbert. My post was designed to
suit the intuitions of TO, RF, and the OP who
desired adjacent points. But one can already
prove the nonexistence of adjacent points in
first-order Hilbert alone. Indeed, this is
implied by II.2:

&quot;II.2: If A and C are two points of a straight
line, then there exists at least one point B
lying between A and C and at least one point D
so situated that C lies between A and D.&quot;

Strangely enough, I first read about Hilbert
from a different source, and II.2 is different:

http://www.friesian.com/space.htm

&quot;For two points A and C, there always exists at
lest one point B on the line AC such that C lies
between A and B.&quot;

Notice that point B in this axiom corresponds to
point D in Wikipedia's. There is no mention of
point B between A and C in Friesian. But it
still follows that such a point exists, but
we must use their version of II.4:

&quot;Let A, B, C be three points that do not lie on
a line and let a be a line in the plane ABC
which does not meet any of the points A, B, C. If
the line a passes through a point of the segment
AB, it also passes through a point of the segment
AC, or through a point of the segment BC.&quot;

Now let X be a point on AB. Let a be the line
that passes through X that is parallel to BC
(a line whose existence is guaranteed by the
Parallel Postulate, IV.1 in Friesian). By II.4
a must pass through either segment AC or it
must pass through BC. Since it is parallel to
BC, it can't pass through it, so therefore it
must pass through AC. Thus a intersects the
segment AC at the point, say Y. Then Y is a
point between A and C, so A and C cannot be
adjacent points. QED

Of course, Wikipedia's version of Axiom II.2
is much more straightforward.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This does not imply a last cut.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a completed set in which all the cuts have been completed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; But does that set consist of &quot;line segments&quot; or &quot;points&quot;?

&gt; &gt; A line segment is a set of points.

&gt; &gt; After all cuts (omega cuts, one for each element of N)
&gt; &gt; have been completed we have
&gt; &gt; omega+1 sets of points.  One set of points is
&gt; &gt; the singleton {0}.  Whether you call this a line
&gt; &gt; segment is a matter of how you define line segment.
&gt; &gt; All other sets of points are
&gt; &gt; line segments.

&gt; Yup, the one at 0 is of length 0, but how long's the one next to it?

Since there is no &quot;one next to it&quot;, the question is meaningless.

No.  I said that given any r&gt;0 there are an infinitude in
the interval (0,r).  That is not the same thing as saying
there is an interval next to 0.

Correct.  &quot;Next to it&quot; implies there exists an interval A
such that there is no interval between A and 0.
No such A exists.

William just misspoke.  The right answer is &quot;There are none next to
it.&quot;  &quot;Next to&quot; means &quot;adjacent to&quot;, i.e., a segment is &quot;next to&quot; {0}
iff there is no other segment between it and {0}.

Clearly, there are no segments next to {0} in this sense.

Well, maybe in some other thread you will get your wish.
On the other hand, claiming that &quot;next to&quot; means &quot;near&quot;

It seems to me that a &quot;point&quot; has dual nature. Consider two

A point seem to represent a &quot;split&quot; or absence of material and as well

We are not talking about anything physical, but
an abstraction.  Since a physical object must be made of discrete
(if small) objects, a pyhsical object is not a point.
A point is the abstraction &quot;location&quot;. As such it may be approximated
as well by an absense of matrerial as by the presence of materal.

The question is: does it make sense to talk about a line as an
abstraction of extent consisting of abstractions of location?
The answer is yes, note however, we have to have an uncountable number
of points before we can get an extent.

Wrong. I do not invoke that, even though I could, that is
a common usage. (Or would you claim that there's next to
no evidence to support that assertion?) However, I do not
need to invoke that. Read it again. Look at my use of
articles this time. Notice how what you've said in order
to contradict me has in fact been in part a rewording of
what I wrote surrounded by additional explanation to
shroud that fact.

No.  You can say that a line segment is defined by two

different.  However, a line segment is not a set of
two points.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, your understanding is correct. I think you understand all this very
&gt; &gt; &gt; well. It is a little mysterious, and it took mathematicians a long time
&gt; &gt; &gt; to invent set theory and the rigorous theory of real numbers. In fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; these things are very recent inventions, less than 150 years old. Before
&gt; &gt; &gt; that time, mathematicians were confused about exactly the same problems.

&gt; &gt; Of course, you are assuming that the set of the reals with &lt; is
&gt; &gt; isomorphic to the spatial line with its spatial left-right order.

&gt; &gt; But can that be proved or is it rather a postulate?

&gt; It depends on what you mean by the &quot;intuitive geometric approach&quot;. I
&gt; can't be sure that /your/ inutuition and /my/ intuition of these
&gt; concepts are the same!

&gt; It is true that, given the real numbers as they are usually defined,
&gt; the Cartesian plane obeys Euclid's postulates of plane geometry.

&gt; But it is not true that every collection of lines and points
&gt; satisfying Euclid's postulates of plane geometry are isomorphic to the
&gt; the cartesian plane.

&gt; For example, the collection of all points and lines which can be
&gt; finitely constructed using a compass and straight edge, given a pair
&gt; of points which are a unit distance apart, are a countable set of
&gt; points and lines that satisfy the (original) postulates.

&gt; But the set of points on the real line are uncountable; so these
&gt; systems can't be isomorphic. In particular, there is no /finite/
&gt; sequence of constructions using only the compass and straightedge
&gt; which allow us to construct a line segment of length pi.

&gt; &gt; Can we be sure they coincide?

&gt; &gt; Intuitively points are discrete and lines are continuous objects.

&gt; The terms &quot;discrete&quot; and &quot;continuous&quot; need to be defined /rigorously/
&gt; if we are to answer your questions.

&gt; &quot;Continuous&quot; might just mean &quot;infinitely divisible&quot;; or it might also
&gt; mean &quot;connected&quot; (in a very particular sense). These different
&gt; meanings give different results.

&gt; Euclid's postulates were a fantastically good start at formalizing
&gt; geometry. But there were missing statements: things that were assumed
&gt; to be true &quot;intuitively&quot;, but not stated as being true. For example,
&gt; that if a line exists then it contains at least two points is
&gt; &quot;obvious&quot;, but was not stated explicitly. More subtle things were
&gt; missing as well.

&gt; More rigorous versions of Euclid's original postulates have been
&gt; developed; for example by Hilbert:

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms

&gt; Hilbert's axioms regarding &quot;continuity&quot;, in particular, the
&gt; &quot;completeness&quot; axiom, ensures that the result is &quot;complete&quot;: it must
&gt; be impossible to add further lines and/or points to the system without
&gt; &quot;breaking it&quot;, so that it fails to fulfill the other axioms.

&gt; The compass and straight-edge example I gave above fails to satisfy
&gt; this additional constraint: these points and lines are a subset of the
&gt; larger set of points and lines in the cartesian plane.

&gt; I'm pretty sure (but maybe I'm wrong!) that the completeness axiom
&gt; (along with the other axioms) allows us to prove that the &quot;geometric&quot;
&gt; line and the &quot;real&quot; line are, indeed, &quot;one and the same&quot;, once we
&gt; formalize our &quot;intuive&quot; notions as Hilbert et al have done.

&gt; &gt; Intuitively the continuum cannot be built out of the discrete except
&gt; &gt; by turning previously separate parts into adjacent parts.

&gt; But we needn't expect that the continuum be &quot;built out of&quot; any such a
&gt; thing at all.

&gt; The axioms tell us how the line can be /broken apart into/ certain
&gt; types of parts which satisfy a certain type of order (and thus
&gt; adjacency).

&gt; They /don't/ claim that there exists a set of indivisible discrete
&gt; parts, satisfying adjacency, and which the line can be /built up
&gt; from/; and indeed, we can prove that there is no such set.

Thanks, Chas.

What I ask is whether there is a proof (from more evident axioms) for
the isomorphism between these two structures:

{R, &lt;}

{{x: x is point on the line}, 'lies at the left
of'}

Cantor in the Beiträge assumed it as a postulate. I don't see how
Hilbert's completeness axiom could entail it. Please, give a hint.

&gt; &gt; &gt; a common usage.

&gt; &gt; No it isn't.   (Before you give an example check to
&gt; &gt; see if the example you are giving is one where something
&gt; &gt; is both near and next to, rather than an example of where
&gt; &gt; near and next to mean the same thing.)

&gt; Now that's just silly. Before I give an example of X
&gt; meaning Y, I must check to ensure that it's not a case
&gt; where X means Y.
">

No.

the two cases are

something is both near and next to
e.g. something is both X and Y

a case where X means Y.

They are not the same.

Example, Consider two stores A and B.

If store A is next to store B we would
normally asy that store A is near store B.

However, saying that store A is near store
B does not normally mean that store A is next
to store B.

So in this example we can have A both near
and next to, but near does not mean next to.

The fact that you did not produce an example
where near and next are not only related but
mean the same thing is telling.

In your reply, before more spew please
produce your putative example.

&gt;No.  You can say that a line segment is defined by two

I'm not sure what you mean when you say a line segment is defined by
two points but is not a set of two points. (Though perhaps it should
be added that the line segment is a straight line segment.)

Exactly the same thing I mean by saying that a linear
equation is defined by a set of three numbers, but a linear
equation is not a set of three numbers.  Do you really
think that the line segment (0,1) and the
set of two points {point 0, point 1} are the same ?!?

You've lost the plot William. Reread the
thread. You're horribly confused and are
trying to define the wrong thing.

And, if you remember, I said that such an
definition wouldn't even be required. However,
you oh-so-subtly snipped that part, and went
ranting about the thing which you thought was
needed that I said wasn't.

Now re-read the thread. A meaning B is not the same as
B meaning A.

Oh, I did back it up. About 8 posts upthread.
You're ability to both &quot;conventiently&quot; forget such things,
as well as your determination to waste your time on things
that I did *not* use as part of my argument despite being
told that I do not use said things (see what you quoted
above - I did not invoke &quot;next to&quot; means &quot;near&quot;, even though
&quot;next to&quot; can mean &quot;near&quot;) speaks even more volumes.

Sure for the purpose of this discussion. The definition is the purpose
of the discussion as I understand it. If we adduce further properties
and predicates then the situation changes. Otherwise one is never in a
position to say what the line &quot;is&quot; because there are always further
predicates capable of being adduced to show what the line really &quot;is&quot;.

By the way, you excised my comment &quot;(Though perhaps it should
be added that the line segment is a straight line segment.)&quot; which
illustrates this point exactly.

Ok.  Then for the purpose of this
discussion a set of two points is a line segment
(A stupid definition, but that's the one you want)
and a line segment is a set of at most two points.
So if we divide the real line into line segments
and points, we divide the real line into points.
It does not matter how many pieces we have
or whether the  &quot;piece left over&quot; is a line
segment or just a point.  Discussion over.
