Make&quot;:

I wonder if he's ever spoken of the book by Alistair Taylor.  It seems
he says he and Paul ere very close.  And he didn't like Linda at all,
it seems.

I think Paul wrote &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; while Alistair Taylor was visiting
him.

Yeah, I read an interview with him, in which I think) he talked about
it.  And added that &quot;now&quot; Paul wouldn't speak to him.

Caller: All these books written about The Beatles, I'm curious are
they all that accurate?

Paul: No. In a word No. Um...there's one original book that was pretty
accurate by Hunter Davis that was an autobiography, but lately there
have been a couple...I think what happens is if you don't bring stuff
out yourself there's always some guy thinks: 'Hey wait a minute there
hasn't been a Beatle book for a couple of years, I'll write one.&quot; And
they do it to make money, let's face it. Umm..couple of the
people..umm...there's a Peter Brown book out--I don't actually want to
advertise it--he's some guy used to be a friend of ours, and he came
around and he conned us all actually. He kinda said to us all (you
know) I'm your mate and remember me, your long lost friend of yours.
We brought him into our house and we showed him around, and met the
kids, and gave him a meal and all of that-- took him around
everywhere. On the basis, what he was going to do he said: he was
going to write this wonderful book and he was going to let us all see
it in case anyone didn't like anything and so we believed him; and
what happened was he came out with some book called &quot;The Love You
Make&quot; (I think it was called that) even nicked the title, isn't that
wonderful? He nicked some lyrics of mine for his title; but umm...he's
what known as a &quot;schlemeil&quot; and I just don't like the fella. He just
did the dirty on us so that book is not (incoherent) stuff that's
(incoherent). You can't believe it 'cause he's just doin' the thing to
make money, probably sue me up to the eyeballs, but I don't care.

Peter Brown is seems to me a total dousebag. Thank god Paul got rid of
this faggot. What aggrevates me about this interview is that it tends
to break up in places---where I typed incoherent.

I haven't read TLYM, and I don't really have an opinion on Peter Brown
(maybe I should), but he's a lucky bastard as he got his full name onto a
Beatles A-side. &quot;Peter Brown called to say you can make it OK&quot;. Don't think
anyone else managed that feat.

Wasn't it Peter Brown who was the man who worked in the motor trade?

Paul said in his 1983 Entertainment Tonight interview that he and
Ringo felt betrayed by Peter Brown, who they thought was a &quot;mate.&quot;
George also attacked &quot;The Love You Make&quot; in his 1983 interview with
Geoffrey Giuliano.  Here are
the excerpts.

Giuliano: Tell me a bit about the new book on the Beatles by your
former Apple attache Peter Brown.

George: Peter Brown came by with this guy (Steven Gaines) for about
ten minutes to Friar Park, had a cup of coffee, and they left.

Giuliano: What did he ask you?

George: Nothing.  There was no interview, nothing.  They just had a
coffee and split.  Then he goes away and acts like the three of us sat
him down and said, &quot;Right, Peter, you're the one.  You should be
writing this.  You tell the story.&quot;  The guy made millions, you know.

Giuliano: Millions, really?

George: Yeah.  It's one of the best-selling books in the world.  Well,
a million anyway.  But it's crazy.

Giuliano: What do you mean?

George: We took this guy from Liverpool.  Made him.  Gave him a job.
Helped him establish himself.  After all those years, then he comes
out with this rubbish.

I got what I could out of it. Some of the sound was wayyy off, but
this is basically what he said. Essentially, what he said is correct:
Most guys write books about the Beatles to make money and not much
else.

I really don't know for sure. Peter Brown is a pretty common name.
And, yes he is a lucky bastard-to have worked alongside Brian Epstein
and to have his name mentioned in 'The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;. I
consider anybody to have ever worked with legends such as the Beatles
pretty lucky.

No, that was Pete Shotton, and he has also written a book.

So I think what Paul is saying is that most Beatle books (including)
Peter Brown's book isn't true.
