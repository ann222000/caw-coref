Does the LS430 Have Tranny Hesitation?

The ES300 has tranny hesitation from what everyone seems to say. It either can
or can not be dealt with by the driver. The adapative transmission seems to be
the source of the problem. There is a "smart" tranny in my old (1996) Mercedes
S430. But it does not have any problems like that, other than the standard MB
problem that they just start out slow when you punch the pedal down. Due to the
incredible number of problems (car and dealer) with the MB, I would like to go
with a different brand when I replace it soon. So the question is - Does the
LS430 have this tranny hesitation problem which shows up sometimes and
sometimes not?

The '03 LS430 does indeed have a hesitation problem, as did my
previous '99 LS400.

I don't know if the same issue as the ES300, or if still exists in the
new 6 speed LS430.

When traveling at slow speed (5-30 mph) and you apply 1/2 to 3/4
throttle, the car hesitates for up to 2-3 seconds (seems like hours)
before downshifting.

It's most noticable when I go through a "Yield" sign onto a highway
and need to merge into existing traffic. Â Several times I've had to
abort my attempt because of the hesitation.

If you apply full throttle right away, it doesn't seem to hesitate
quite as much, but I don't usually want to make THAT drastic a move.

I've mentioned this twice to the Lexus dealer (and once in writting to
Lexus headquarters in California), but was told that this was not a
known problem.

It does also, but the higher horsepower minimizes the negative effect... at
least this is what the mechanic said. He said for ever 5 es330 complaints,
there is one LS complaint... I guess there is also some issue with the
RX.... the GX is the only one that does not use fly by wire throttle... (at
least 04 does not)

sounds like drive by wire normal operation rather than transmission lag.

You're saying that this type of hesitation problem exists on ALL
"drive by wire" cars?

Does anyone know if this applys to the new 6 speed tranny? Have you tried to
notify any of the safety agencies or your state atty gen office for fraud?

The drive-by-wire system has nothing to do with the transmission lag.
It is caused by the computer engine control.

Well whatever causes it, does the LS430 have it? And if it does, is there any
way to fix it?
