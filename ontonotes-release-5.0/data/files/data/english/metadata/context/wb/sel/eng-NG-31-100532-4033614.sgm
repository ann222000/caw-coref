94 Pathfinder XE 4x4 Automatic 128,000 miles.

Sometimes when I try to push in the button on the shifter to get out of
park, it wont press in all the way. I'll have to wiggle the shift around
and press it a bunch of times before it will go in all the way and allow
me to shift out of park.
Yes, I'm applying the breaks before I push the button!

Anyone know how to fix/adjust this this?
Is there something I under the console that needs to be adjusted/lubed?

Also, is there an "override" for this to disengage it if I can't get it to
push in? (my 2005 Xterra has a little pin that can be pulled out, right
next to the shift lever. Hopefully it will be many years before i need to
use it on that truck!)

i had the same problem on my 94 pathfinder, remove the console, clean out
any foreign material and grease the areas that move

Thanks Sly - I was hoping it would be something easy like that!

also, by wiggling the shifter around, do you mean you have to twist the
shisfter back and forth a bit? if thats the case then the only solutions are
replacing the shifter handle or checking to see if the clip or screw(i dont
remember which) is missing or loose, the shifter handle has to be centered
just right cos inside the shifter are angled plastic pieces that line up
just right so when you push in on the button, the shaft in turn pushes down

I had a similar problem on a 68 Ford Mustang once. A US Quarter ($ .25)
had fallen into the shift console and prevented the shifter from going
into gear.
