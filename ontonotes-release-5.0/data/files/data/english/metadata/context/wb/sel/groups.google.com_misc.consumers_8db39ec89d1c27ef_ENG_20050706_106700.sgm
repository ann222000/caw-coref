I have a Craftsman Eager series self propelled mower that my son used
in the neighborhood to make a few bucks mowing lawns until it suddenly
developed a problem and I can't tell if it's a gas problem or a timing
problem which leads to the following questions...

Do lawn mowers have a proper 'timing' adjustment? The reason I ask is
because when it ran, it seemed to be having a timing issue - misfiring
and such as it barely ran following the problem surfacing.

How does a person determine if the coil is creating the problem? I
assume that with an ohm-meter, one can tell if the primary is OK but
how about the secondary part of the ignition? I held the spark plug
cable and gently pulled the start cord but couldn't feel much 'zap'
but notably, some was there.

I think this might be down to the ignition system side or perhaps even
the carb (filthy air cleaner I pulled off that may have allowed dust
through) and really don't want to just keep throwing money into it if
the money would be better spent on another mower but obviously, would
like to save it if I can.

Does the magneto (or coil) have a surface that can be cleaned (air gap
with the flywheel) to help the spark issue ???

Would appreciate any pointers from any lawn mower mechanics to help me
decide again, if I should just dump it and buy another one... It's a
7hp motor on approx a 3 year old walk behind, self propelled mower.
TIA for any feedback...

more than a few bucks for all this, and from what little I know, these
things are the main causes of mower problems.

It's wise of you to have your son learn how to make money. I wish the kids
in my neighborhood would start mowing lawns and making themselves useful,
instead of 'hanging out', which they do seem quite good at.

Anyway, this might be a good time to teach your son the economics of running
a business, a fancy way to say &quot;get it fixed, son.&quot; ;-)

"/> I've had keys fail and the mower would still run. It would also kick back
hard when starting - enough to break the rope.
OP - pull the flywheel and check the key. The chances are that the problem
is there.
Also - watch the crossposting.

"/> I favor the guys who think it is an ignition problem.

You said in the original post that you did not get much of a zap. Look down
on the flywheel and see if you can see if the key that secures the flywheel
to the shaft is at all bent. This will throw the timing off and produce a
weak spark.
If the key is really ok, then remove the plug from the wire and rig up a
piece of metal ( a nail, screw, or whatever) from the plug wire so that
the other end of the metal is about a quarter inch from the motor. Pull the
starter cord and see if you get a spark that will jump the quarter inch gap.
If you get a big spark, the ignition is good, if not you know what needs to
be fixed.

On a side note, I am about to buy a gas powered lawn mower. I saw one
in Sears for 179 and one in Sams for 209... see links below..
which one is better value for money.. I have a small yard. 700-800 Sq
ft.

Are these ones, which are walk behind ones. too much of a pain to work
with. Would a self propelled one be better ?

"/> That's what I was thinking. About once a month, I mow an area much larger
than that. I do it with this:

http://www.sears.com/sr/javasr/product.do?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes&amp;vertical...

It's a great workout, especially for upper body strength. :) I just walk
slowly back and forth, swinging it in an arc. It cuts about a 4' swath.
Note that the area I'm talking about can't be done with a walk behind mower
or a riding mower due to uneven terrain and rocks. Still, for 800 square
feet? How are you going to change the oil on a mower if the engine never
gets warm? :)

But seriously, that Craftsman 4.5hp mower looks like a much better deal. It
might be overkill for 800SF, but it's a better value, by far. -Dave

on the first pull. One problem is the soft blade -- it gets dull very
quick.

I have a Craftsman Eager series self propelled mower that my son used
in the neighborhood to make a few bucks mowing lawns until it suddenly
developed a problem
CY: Sounds like your son hit a rock. When that happens, the flywheel keeps
going, and shears the soft flywheel key. tht throws the timing off. Most
electronic ignitions will still spark, but the timing is way off.

and I can't tell if it's a gas problem or a timing
problem which leads to the following questions...

Do lawn mowers have a proper 'timing' adjustment?
CY: The timing adjustment is the shear key between the flywheel and the
crankshaft. Shears should be able to sell you a new flywheel key.

The reason I ask is
because when it ran, it seemed to be having a timing issue - misfiring
and such as it barely ran following the problem surfacing.
CY&quot;: Sounds right.

How does a person determine if the coil is creating the problem? I
assume that with an ohm-meter, one can tell if the primary is OK but
how about the secondary part of the ignition? I held the spark plug
cable and gently pulled the start cord but couldn't feel much 'zap'
but notably, some was there.

I think this might be down to the ignition system side or perhaps even
the carb (filthy air cleaner I pulled off that may have allowed dust
through) and really don't want to just keep throwing money into it if
the money would be better spent on another mower but obviously, would

Does the magneto (or coil) have a surface that can be cleaned (air gap

CY: Usually not an issue.

Would appreciate any pointers from any lawn mower mechanics to help me
decide again, if I should just dump it and buy another one... It's a
7hp motor on approx a 3 year old walk behind, self propelled mower.
TIA for any feedback...
CY: 7 HP is worth the effort. Might want to find a local repair shop, and
take it in. Ask your neighbors to try to find a mechanic to help. Sounds
like you're not familiar with these. But, it's a (relatively) simple fix.

Craftsman. 22&quot; 4 HP self-propelled mower. I mowed the better part of an
acre for two years with it before I bought a garden tractor. I still use
the same Craftsman to mow around the landscaping and other obstructions

runs on the first or second pull after sitting in the shed all winter.

I bought mine about 5 years ago - still on the original battery. I saw
an ad on TV with a little old lady mowing her grass and thought 'hey, I
could use that'. They offer a deal where you can return it after six
months if you don't love it. And when I got mine, they offered free
shipping - BOTH WAYS - so you weren't out any shipping fees if you
didn't like it. I figured with that kind of offer, they probably had to
have a really good product that people would not return.

I love mine and two friends of mine tried it and bought the same one I have.

I have no affiliation with these people - I just think this is the
nicest lawnmower I've ever had.

"/> On a serious note.....
ALL mower engines have a keyway called a &quot;Woodruff&quot; Key. It's a halfmoon
shaped piece of metal that keeps the flywheel from shearing the crank if the
blade hits something hard(like a big rock or curb).
If this keyway was damaged or sheared it will run lousy or not at all.
BEFORE YOU DO THE NEXT STEP MAKE SURE THE PLUGWIRE IS OFF THE PLUG AND
GROUNDED!!!!
Pull the cover off the engine, look at the cutout on the crankshaft. It
should match the cutout on the flywheel.If it is off even a little your
timing is off too.
To replace this part and inspect the magneto coil you need to remove the nut
on the end of the crankshaft. Next you need to tap on the flywheel with a
RUBBER mallet, while pulling up on it.
Books and/or info on Briggs&amp;Stratton and Tehcumseh engines are easy to find,
engines are VERY simple. Unless the mainbearings are trashed,valves are
burned or it threw a rod..its EASY to keep them running.
Depending on what your personal time is worth, I have seen 6HP 22&quot; rotary's
going for $199 with a rear bagger.....

&gt; used to have a B&amp;D corded mower. ran troublefree for years, then the
&gt; motor burned out. got a used gas mower from a mower repair place for
&gt; $60. nothing fancy, but it works. when it doesnt work, i tip it over,
&gt; drain the gas and oil and sharpen the blade, refill with new fluids and
&gt; clean the plug off.

"/> A gas mower doesn't work very well if you don't mow more often than once a
month or so. I've used a corded electric for decades and only cut through the
cord ONCE! They've all been from yard sales, and somehow I now have three
working ones -- friend bought one from me that I'd bought, gave me one he
picked up for free, not at all sure where the other one came from... Oh shit,
I have FIVE working ones, although the first one is really too small...

No maintenance, no starting fluid, no gas, no oil, just flip the switch. I
guess you could sharpen the blade every once in a while, but that appears to
be optional.

&gt; HUH?

"/> Once you use it, it becomes USED. There are probably more used mowers in
garages and sheds than there are new ones in stores. What that has to do with
push mower vs electric mower, I haven't a clue.
