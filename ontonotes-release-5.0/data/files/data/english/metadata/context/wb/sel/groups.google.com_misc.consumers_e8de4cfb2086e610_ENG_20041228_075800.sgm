&quot;People are dying by the thousands from heart attack and stroke while on &quot;low cholesterol&quot; diet.&quot;

&quot;The cholesterol scare is big business for doctors, laboratories, and drug companies. It is also a powerful marketing gimmick for vegetable oil and margarine manufacturers.... In the end , cholesterol will be exonerated from its role as primary villain in cardiovascular disease. The accusing finger points at 'experts' who concocted the cholesterol theory to drum up business by spreading fear.&quot;--Udo Erasmus (Fats that Heal Fats that Kill)

About 80% of the population has blood cholesterol affected not much by
dietary intake of cholesterol, while about 20% of the population has a
genetic difficulty handling dietary cholesterol.
Meanwhile, dietary fat intake is a major factor for blood cholesterol
for most people.

Heart attacks are also more likely in people who are overweight, who
don't get aerobic exercise, and who have high blood pressure.
In fact, being overweight worsens blood cholesterol, while aerobic
exercise lowers &quot;bad cholesterol&quot; while raising &quot;good cholesterol&quot;.
