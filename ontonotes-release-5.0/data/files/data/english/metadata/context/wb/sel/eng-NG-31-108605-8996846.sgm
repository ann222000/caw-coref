9-11-2007- WHAT'S GOING ON?

Tell A Friend

Going into Labor Day weekend, there were lots of rumors anticipating a
false flag operation, another 9-11. Trainloads of armored vehicles
rolled into Houston. The San Francisco Bay bridge closed for three
days. Suspicious activity was reported on ferries in Puget Sound.
Ominous civil defense exercises are being held in Oregon, as part of
Operation Noble Resolve, which also involves military jets flying over
New York. An antiaircraft division is ordered to Washington DC.

We made it through the holiday safely.

Then last Wednesday, Congressman Paul Gillmor (R-OH) was found dead in
his home. This was reported as a heart attack, until word leaked out
that he had blunt trauma to the head and neck. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20649320/
Now we're being told he fell down the stairs. Gillmor was
investigating a series of option trades that are suspicious- someone
is betting billions of dollars that the market will fall 50% by
September 21st. Even with the housing crisis, it would take a major
catastrophe, like a &quot;terrorist&quot; attack, to precipitate such a plunge.
As part of his job on the House Finance Committee, Gillmor was
investigating this deal. Was he murdered because he was about to
reveal something?

Would this death, on top of the deaths of Senators Wellstone and
Carnahan, and the anthraxing of Senators Daschle and Leahy, have a
chilling effect on people in Congress? Maybe that's why they're
&quot;spineless&quot;.
Now we learn that on August 30th, six nuclear warheads were
&quot;accidentally&quot; shipped by B-52 from Minot Air Force Base in North
Dakota to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. (Five arrived, did
one get &quot;lost&quot;? Or is someone unable to count?) This violates all
military procedure, which requires that nuclear weapons always be
shipped on the ground in the continental US, so that if there's an
accident, a bomb detonation won't occur. It would take an order from
the Commander-in-Chief to put nukes on a plane.

The warheads were reportedly fastened to cruise missiles, which have a
range of 1500-2000 miles. Not enough to cross the Atlantic, but enough
to hit cities in the US as part of a false flag operation. This
scenario is being claimed by &quot;military investigators&quot; on the Hal
Turner show, and is making its way around the internet. It's being
said the plan was to hit 5 American cities with nuclear weapons over
Labor Day weekend in order to install martial law. If so, we have been
saved by the grace of God, operating through loyal American
whistleblowers, who made the &quot;accidental shipment&quot; of nuclear warheads
public.

Now we are told that the entire Air Force will stand down on September
14th, for overhaul and review of procedures.
http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2007/09/airforce_aircombatcommand_s...
Our skies will be unguarded for a day, and our vulnerability has been
announced to the whole world. It's an open invitation to America's
enemies to attack us. The last stand-down, unannounced ahead of time,
took place on Sept 11, 2001. What's planned for Sept. 14th, 2007?
Oddly enough, El Al, the Israeli airline, will not be flying planes
that day either.

What is going on? One of my most anti-conspiracy friends says he
believes it's a giant conspiracy. What do you think? and how can we
nip it in the bud?

Let us pray that honest, conscientious, loyal Americans will abort
whatever evil plot is in the works, just as someone &quot;outed&quot; the nukes
on the B 52 on August 30th. Let us remember that many such evil plots
have been headed off- the fourth plane that did NOT hit Congress or
the White House 6 years ago (which would have initiated martial law) ,
the anthrax that did NOT wipe out the whole Senate (thanks to alert
postal workers and doctors at the Communicable Disease Center), the
lie about &quot;yellowcake from Niger&quot; that was exposed by Ambassador Joe
Wilson (at great cost to his wife Valerie Plame, and to all of us who
were being protected by her undercover CIA network), and many others.

What to do? Talk about the Sept 14th stand-down and your suspicions,
write about it, protest about it. The truth will set us free. God is
with us, with We the People. We are being threatened with great harm
by those in power who are supposed to be serving us. If we shed enough
light, if we make enough noise, if we love our country and our planet,
we will finally be able to overthrow the pirates who have hijacked our
ship of state, and bring them to justice.

Impeachment now!

In the name of the God of truth and justice, Carol Wolman

I can't speak to the rest of it, but tonight through sundown tomorrow
is Rosh HaShana, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.  That might
be why El Al isn't flying.

This followup comment seems apposite:

The fun of research...

Now I hate Bush as much as the next guy, and living in Portland, the next
guy hates Bush a lot. But you seem to have missed a couple of facts in
your research. Sorry, no sources, since I couldn't get the links to show
up on this site. None of them took l onger than 30 seconds to find on
Google though.

First, the armored vehicles in Houston. Since you didn't cite a source,
and I couldn't find anyone else talking about it via a quick Google
search, it was hard to pin down exactly. However, Eagle Global Logistics
is based in Houston and ships (among other things) &quot;armored vehicles&quot; to
Iraq. I'm guessing they were passing through.

The Bay Bridge was NOT closed. The lower deck was.There has been
extensive work on it, and other bridges in the area. Why would you assume
so much significance into that?

As for the suspicious activities on Puget Sound ferries, it was two men,
whose crime was being overly curious. Suspicious? Sure, but no more than
anything that happens dozens of times a year.

As for Operation Noble Resolve...oh wait, it's already over. That's
right, it ended last month.

Side note: I mentioned I live in Portland. I can confirm that no nuclear
weapons went off, I'm still alive, and I never even heard of Noble
Resolve until tonight. As for the jets over New York, there was also a
simulated hurricane near Africa, among many other things. Picking and
choosing the ones that support your theory is not good journalism.

You also mentioned anti-aircraft patrols in Washington. I found plenty of
links to back that up.
Only problem is that all of them were from separate times the exact same
thing has happened between 09/11/01 and now. It's nothing new or
surprising.

A dead congressman, with conflicting information? No surprise there. On
09/11/01 the local radio station was first reporting that two planes
collided in midair, and then hit the WTC. There is ALWAYS inaccurate
information given out by the media immediately after a noteworthy event.
Besides, do you really think he's the only person who could make some
sort of revelation? That he didn't have scores of aides working on the
project, among other congressmen, leaving possibly dozens of people who
had the same information, and hundreds who could pick up where he left
off?
I somehow doubt congressmen do quite as much legwork to make your
scenario plausible.

And of course the nukes - 5 or 6? Remember what I said a moment ago:
there is always inaccurate information reported right after an event. As
for only a Commander-in-Chief being able to give that order...that's why
there's an investigation, and the man in charge was immediately &quot;relieved
of his duties&quot; - because it wasn't supposed to happen.
Also, all the nuclear weapons are now completely accounted for.

Now, if the government were launching a fake attack, why in the world
would they do so from inside the US? Wouldn't it be far more plausible to
stage another Cuban Missile Crisis, firing cruise missiles from offshore?

The last safety day was more recent than September 2001, it was actually
2004.
Also, it's probably worth pointing out that the safety day is probably
due to the huge mix-up of loading nukes onto a B-52. Even if you think it
was done on purpose, then having a safety day is a good way to cover it
up, isn't it? Either way, the safety day is not quite what the article
claimed it to be.

Someone already pointed out the reason the Israeli airline isn't flying.
And besides, why would the US warn Israel (I assume that's your point),
and not Canada, the UK, etc?

&quot;One of my most anti-conspiracy friends says he believes it's a giant
conspiracy.&quot;
One of my most fevered conspiracy friends thinks there's nothing unusual
about it whatsoever. See, I can pretend personal tidbits are valuable
evidence too.

As for Bush...it's long past time to get that guy out of office. No
argument from me there.
