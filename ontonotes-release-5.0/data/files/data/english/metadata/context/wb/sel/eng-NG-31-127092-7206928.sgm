I would love feedback on the drug Xenical from anyone who has used it
good or bad feedback.
I run an Advertising Agency and use blogging and the internet to gain
perspective and get feedback.
I have started a group called whatisxenical that i would love anyone
interested to join and i have also just kicked off a blog where i
intend to publish any quality articles or medical journals that i find.
In edition to these i will also publish any messages that you leave for
me at the blog that explain what your experience with Xenical was like.
You can message me expressing interest in joining such a group or visit
the blog at
www.whatisxenical.blogspot.com

Regards

Paul Ritchie
C.E.O Paul Ritchie Advertising Group

ps.If you have links promoting health or diet related products i will
be happy to include the links to said products with your contributions.
