Rules of play

Craps is a game played by 1 or more players. Players take turns
rolling two dice. The player rolling the dice is called the "shooter".
The game is played in rounds, with the first roll of a new round
called the "come-out roll."

On the come-out roll if the total of the two dice are 7, 11, 2, 3 or
12, the round ends immediately and the shooter must roll another come-
out roll. A result of 2, 3 or 12 is called 'craps' while a result of 7
or 11 is called a 'win' or a 'natural'. When any other number (4, 5,
6, 8, 9, or 10) is rolled on the come-out roll, this number becomes
what is called the point. If a point is established then the shooter
will re-roll the dice continuously until either a 7 is rolled, or the
point is rolled again. If the shooter rolls the point again, the round
ends and the game starts over with the same shooter rolling another
come-out roll. If the shooter rolls a 7 instead of the point, this is
called a 'seven-out', the round ends and the dice pass to the next
player to the left, who becomes the new shooter.

Players can make any of a large number of bets. Most of these are
betting on the way the round will end (point comes or a seven out).
Other betting can include betting on a specific total being rolled, or
a specific total being rolled before a 7. In a casino players will
make bets with chips on a specially made craps table.

A casino craps table is run by four casino employees: a boxman who
guards the chips, supervises the dealers and handles coloring out
players; two base dealers who stand to either side of the boxman and
collect and pay bets; and a stickman who stands directly across the
table from the boxman and announces the results of each roll and then
collects the dice with an elongated wooden stick. He is also in charge
of managing the bets made on the center of the table (hardways, yo,
horn, etc).

A new shooter, who must bet the table minimum on either the pass line
or the don't pass line to play, is presented five dice by the stickman
and picks two.

The dealers will usually insist that the shooter roll with one hand
and that the dice bounce off the wall surrounding the table. These
requirements are meant to prevent cheating attempts by players
switching the dice or making a "controlled shot." If a die leaves the
table, the shooter will usually be asked to select another die from
the remaining three but can request using the same die if it passes
the boxman's inspection. This requirement is used in an effort to
reduce cheating the game by players substituting loaded dice for the
regulation dice.

[edit] Types of bets

[edit] Player bets

Fire Bet: Before the shooter begins, some casinos will allow a bet
known as a fire bet to be placed. A fire bet is a bet for between 1-5
dollars in the hopes that the next shooter will have a hot streak of
setting and getting many points of different values. As points are
made by the shooter they will be marked on the craps layout with a
fire symbol. The first three points will not pay out on the fire bet,
but the fourth, fifth and sixth will pay out at increasing odds. The
fourth point pays at 25-1 (a maximum of $125), the fifth point pays at
250-1 (a maximum of $1250) and the 6th point pays at 1000-1 (a maximum
of $5000). Note that the points must all be different numbers for them
to count towards the fire bet. A shooter who successfully hits a point
of 10 twice will only garner credit for the first one on the fire bet.

[edit] Line bets

The shooter is required to make either a Pass Line bet or a Don't Pass
bet. Line bets are based around points.

Pass line: The fundamental bet in craps is the pass line bet, also
called the win line in some countries. A pass line bet is won if the
come-out roll is a 7 or 11. If the come-out roll is 2, 3 or 12, the
bet loses. If instead the come-out roll establishes a point, and that
point is rolled again, the bet wins. If a point is established and a 7
is rolled before the point is re-rolled, the bet loses.

Don't pass: The opposite of the pass line bet is the don't pass bet.
The don't pass bet is opposite in that it loses if the come-out roll
is 7 or 11 and wins if the come-out roll is 3. One of 12 or 2 will
draw, the other will win (this depends on the casino), either way a
player cannot lose if 12 or 2 is rolled. A draw on either 2 or 12 is
done to ensure the casino maintains a house edge regardless of if
players are betting pass or don't pass. If a point is established and
that point is rolled again, the don't pass bet loses. If a 7 is rolled
instead of the point being re-rolled, the don't pass bet wins. Many
craps players consider don't pass bets to be in poor taste, or even
taboo, because they are betting opposite to how the game is
conventionally considered to play.

Pass odds: If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 is thrown on the come-out roll
(i.e., if a point is set), most casinos allow pass line bettors to
take odds by placing from one to five times (and at some casinos, up
to 100 times) the pass line bet behind the pass line. This additional
bet wins if the point is rolled again before a 7 is rolled (the point
is made) and pays at the true odds of 2-to-1 if 4 or 10 is the point,
3-to-2 if 5 or 9 is the point, and 6-to-5 if 6 or 8 is the point.

Don't pass odds: If a player is playing don't pass instead of pass,
they may also take odds by placing chips behind the don't pass line.
If a 7 comes instead of the point coming, the odds pay at true odds of
1-to-2 if 4 or 10 is the point, 2-to-3 if 5 or 9 is the point, 5-to-6
if 6 or 8 is the point. For most players the perceived disadvantage of
putting up the long side of the bet makes the don't pass odds less
desirable, however putting up the long side reduces variance.

Come bet: The rules for the come wagers are the same as for the pass
line except that they can only be made after the come-out roll. If the
roll the come bet is made on is a 7 or 11 it wins, if it is a 2, 3 or
12 it loses, just like a pass bet. If instead the roll is 4, 5, 6, 8,
9, 10 then the come bet will be moved by the stick-man onto a box
representing that number. If the number is rolled again before a seven
the bet wins, if the seven comes before the number (the come-point)
the bet loses. Odds can also be placed on a come-point just like a
normal pass point; in this case the dealer (not the player) places the
odds bet on top of the bet in the box, slightly offset to signify that
it is an odds bet and not part of the original come bet.

Because of the come bet, if the shooter makes their point, a player
can find themselves in the situation where they have a come bet
(possibly with odds on it) and the next roll is a come-out roll. In
this situation odds bets on the come wagers are presumed to be not
working for the come-out roll. That means that if the shoot rolls a 7
on the come-out roll, any players with active come bets waiting for a
come-point lose their initial wager but will have their odds money
returned to them, if the come-point is rolled the odds do not win but
the come bet does and the odds are returned. The player can tell the
dealer that they want their odds working, such that if the shooter
rolls a number that matches the come point, the odds bet will win
along with the come bet, and if a seven is rolled both lose.

Don't come: There is also a don't come box which is the opposite of a
come bet in that the player is betting that craps will come on the
next roll instead of 7 or 11, or that if a come point is made, that
value won't be rolled again before a 7. It pays just as don't pass and
also has odds in the same way.

[edit] Single roll bets

Single Roll bets have a result in a single shooter roll. They include:

Yo: Wins if the shooter rolls 11.

3 (ace-deuce): Wins if the shooter rolls a 3.

2 (snake eyes): Wins if shooter rolls a 2.

12 (box cars): Wins if shooter rolls a 12.

2 or 12 (hi-lo): Wins if shooter rolls a 2 or 12. The stickman places
this bet on the line dividing the 2 and 12 bets.

Craps: Wins if the shooter rolls 2, 3 or 12.

C &amp; E: A combined bet, a player is betting half their bet on craps and
the other half on yo (11). One of the two bets will always lose, the
other may win.

Any seven: Wins if the shooter rolls a 7. This bet is also nicknamed
Big Red, since the 7 on its betting space on the layout is usually
large and red.

Field: This bet is a wager that one of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11,
or 12 will appear on the next roll of the dice. This bet typically
pays more 2:1 or 3:1 if 2 or 12 is rolled, and 1:1 if 3, 4, 9, 10 or
11 is rolled. Unlike the other proposition bets which are handled by
the dealers or stickman, the field bet is placed directly by the
player.

The Horn: This is a bet that involves betting on 1 unit each for 2, 3,
11 and 12 at the same time for the next roll. The bet is actually four
separate bets, and pays off depending on which number is actually
rolled, minus three units for the other three losing bets. Most
players do a "Horn High" bet which involves betting an additional $1
on one of the 4 choices, with the most frequent being a $5 "horn high
yo" bet (which means $2 on the 11, $1 each on 2, 3 &amp; 12).

Whirl or World: bet is a five-unit bet that is a combination of a horn
and any-seven bet, with the idea that if a seven is rolled the bet is
a push, because the money won on the seven is lost on the horn
portions of the bet.

[edit] Multi roll bets

These are bets that may not be settled on the first roll and may need
any number of subsequent rolls before an outcome is determined.

Hard way: You may bet that the shooter will throw a specific hard way
(either 4, 6, 8 or 10), before he throws a seven or the corresponding
easy way. A hard way is when both dice show identical values, so 2 2
is hard way 4.

Easy way: Opposite of hard way is a bet that the shooter will throw a
specific easy way (either 4, 6, 8 or 10), before he throws a seven. An
easy way is an value that does not have two dice identical, so 3 1 is
easy way 4.

Big 6 and Big 8: These wagers are considered by craps players as
sucker bets because they pay even money while a player can bet on the
same proposition (that the number will be rolled before a 7) by making
place/buy bets on the 6 or the 8, which pay more money. Veteran craps
players avoid these bets, and some casinos do not even offer them. The
bets are located in the corners behind the pass line, and bets are
placed directly by players.

Place and buy: Players can buy or place certain individual numbers (4,
5, 6, 8, 9, 10) by placing their wager in the come area and telling
the dealer, "place the 6" or "buy the 8". Both place and buy bets are
bets that the number bet on will be rolled before a 7 is rolled. Place
bets are paid at odds worse than the true odds, while buy bets are
paid at true odds, but a 5% commission is charged. Traditionally, the
buy bet commission is paid no matter what, but in recent years a
number of casinos have changed their policy to charge the commission
only when the buy bet wins. Most casinos usually charge only $1 for a
$25 green-chip bet (4% commission), or $2 for $50 (two green chips),
reducing the house advantage a bit more. Where commission is charged
only on wins, the commission is sometimes deducted from the winning
payoff - a winning $25 buy bet on the 10 would pay $49, for instance.

Lay: A lay bet is the opposite of a buy/place bet, where a player bets
on a 7 to roll before the number that is laid. The lay bets pay true
odds, but a 5% commission is charged. In some casinos the commission
is only charged if the bet wins. Like the buy bet the commission is
adjusted to suit the betting unit such that fraction of a dollar
payouts are not needed.

[edit] Bet odds

Note: Individual casinos may pay some of these bets at different
odds than those listed below. The payoff odds listed are the most
common throughout North American casinos.

Note: Actual odds do not vary (and are yet to be added to the
table).

Lay 5 / Lay 9   2:3 + 5% commission     5%
Lay 6 / Lay 8   5:6 + 5% commission     5%

The expected value of all bets is negative, such that the average
player will always lose money. This is because the house always sets
the paid odds to below the actual odds. All bets have a negative
expectation except for the "odds" bet that the player is allowed to
make after a point is established on a pass/come don't pass/don't come
bet (the odds portion of the bet has a long-term expected value of 0).
However, the "free odds" bet cannot be made independently, so the
expected value of the entire bet, including odds, is still negative.
Since there is no correlation between die rolls, there is no possible
long-term winning strategy in craps.

Maximizing the size of your odds bet in relation to your line bet will
reduce, but never eliminate the house edge, and will increase
variance. Many casinos have a limit on how large the odds bet can be
in relation to the flat bet, with single, double, and five times odds
common. Some casinos offer 3-4-5 odds, referring to the maximum
multiple of the line bet a player can place in odds for the points of
4 and 10, 5 and 9, and 6 and 8, respectively. During promotional
periods, a casino may even offer 100x odds bets, which renders the
house edge to almost nothing, but dramatically increases variance, as
the player will be betting in large betting units.

[edit] Optimal betting

Since all bets have a house advantage (and a negative expected value)
the optimal strategy is not to bet. Players can, however, reduce their
average hourly losses by only placing bets with the smallest house
advantage.

The pass/don't line, come/don't line, place 6, place 8, buy 4 and buy
10 (only when commission is charged only on wins) are the bets with
the lowest house edge, and all other bets will on average lose money
between three and twelve times faster because of the difference in
house edges.

An important alternative metric is house advantage per roll (rather
than per bet), which may be expressed in loss per hour see reference.
The typical pace of rolls varies depending on the number of players,
but 102 rolls per hour is a cited rate for a nearly full table see
reference. This number then permits calculation of rate of loss per
hour, and per the 4 day/5 hour per day gambling trip:

$10 Pass line bets .42% per roll, $4.28 per hour, $86 per trip

$10 Place 6,8 bets 1.46% per roll, $14.89 per hour, $298 per trip

$10 Place 5,9 bets 1.32% per roll, $13.46 per hour, $269 per trip

$10 Place 4,10 bets 1.19% per roll, $12.14 per hour, $243 per trip

$1 Single Hardways 2.78% per roll, $2.84 per hour, $56.71 per trip

$1 All hardways 2.78% per roll, $11.34 per hour, $227 per trip

$5 All hardways 2.78% per roll, $56.71 per hour, $1134 per trip

$1 Craps only on come out 3.29% per roll, $3.35 per hour, $67.09 per
trip

$1 Eleven only on come out 3.29% per roll, $3.35 per hour, $67.09 per
trip

This runs counter to the notion that hardways and C/E on come-out roll
are necessarily bad bets, since, although their house percentages are
poor, they have lower minimum bets and happen less frequently.
Therefore, they do not lose money as quickly as the pass line bet.

Also, by this metric, other betting patterns are shown to be costly,
for example placing $10 on all point numbers, which has a much higher
loss of $40.49 per hour or $810 per trip. [citation needed]

[edit] Etiquette

Besides the rules of the actual game, certain unwritten rules of
etiquette exist while playing craps and are expected to be followed.
Many consider these guidelines as important as the actual rules
themselves. New players should familiarize themselves with them before
approaching a craps table.

[edit] Rules related to casino security

* Players are not supposed to handle the dice with more than one
hand (such as passing them from hand to hand before rolling) nor take
the dice past the edge of the table. The only way to change hands when
throwing dice, if permitted at all, is to set the dice on the table,
let go, then take them with the other hand.
* When throwing the dice, the player is expected to hit the
farthest wall at the opposite end of the table. The dice may not be
slid across the table and must be tossed. Typically, players are asked
not to throw the dice higher than the eye level of the dealers.
* The dice cannot land in the boxman's bank or on any of the
dealers' working stacks of money.
* When either of the dice land on chips or markers not in the
boxman's bank or the dealers' working stacks, the number that would be
on top if the object the die is leaning on were removed, is the number
that is used to make the call.
* If one or both dice hits a player or dealer and rolls back onto
the table, the roll counts as long as the person being hit did not
interfere with either of the dice, though some casinos will rule "no
roll" for this situation.
* In most cases the shooter may "set" the dice to a particular
configuration, but if they do, they are often asked to be quick about
it so as not to delay the game. Some casinos have "no setting" rules.
* Do not try to place money in the dealer's hand or expect the
dealers to hand you chips. Dealers are not allowed to touch the
players. A player is expected to lay the cash down on the layout,
which the dealer will take and then place chips in front of the
player.
* Many craps table layouts state "NO CALL BETS". This means a
player is not allowed to call out a bet without having at least the
right amount of chips on the table. If the chips exceed the bet, for
example a $100 chip is placed and bets called out of "$25 on five and
nine", the dealer will say "it's a bet" and return $50 change to the
player. The dealer doesn't have to actually place the bet in the
proper place on the table to constitute a valid bet. This method is
consistent with the fast action of the game, allowing a player to make
a last-second bet while the dice are about to be thrown. The NO CALL
BET rule may exist to prevent confusion on the amount bet, possibly
going back to the days of 25 cent tables. For example "three fifty"
could mean $3.50 or $350. If the dealer is not clear about the
intention of the player he may state "no bet" and push the chips back
to the player.

[edit] Commonly observed etiquette

* When offered the dice to shoot, a player may pass the dice to
the next player without fear of offending anyone; however, keep in
mind that at least one player must always be a "shooter" betting on
either the pass line or don't pass line for the game to continue.
* When tipping, the most common way is simply to toss chips onto
the table and say "For the house," "For the dealers," or "For the
boys" (the latter is considered acceptable even though dealers often
are women). Another method is to place a bet next to your bet and call
out "dealers." A "two-way" bet is one that is part for the player and
part for the dealers. Usually, the dealers' bet is smaller than the
player's bet, but it is appreciated. The part of the bet for the
dealer is called a "toke" bet; this is from the $1 slot machine coins
or tokens that are sometimes used to place bets for the dealers in a
casino. Most casinos require the dealers to pick up their winning
bets, including the original tip, rather than "let it ride" as the
player may choose to do.
* After the come-out roll, it is considered bad luck to say the
word "seven". A common "nickname" for this number is "Big Red".
* It is considered bad luck to change dice in the middle of a
roll.
* Center bets are made by tossing chips to the center of the table
and calling out the intended bet; the stickman will then place the
chips correctly for the player.
* It is considered rude to "late bet," or make wagers while the
dice are no longer in the middle of the table. While entirely
permissible, excessive late betting will generally garner a warning.
* Food, drinks, and other items should remain off the chip rail.
* Players feel it is bad luck for the shooter to leave the table
after a successful come-out roll.
* While it is mathematically a slightly better bet, "wrong
bettors" (people who bet "don't pass") are considered to bring bad
luck to the table.
* When the shooter is ready to roll, players should remove their
hands from the table area in order to avoid interfering with the dice.
The stickman will often say "hands high, let 'em fly" or "dice are
out, hands high".
* When making bets in the field or on the Big 6 or Big 8, it is
the player's responsibility to track his or her bet. Place bets and
Come Line bets will be tracked by the dealer, who will pay you
directly. Hardway and other proposition bets are tracked by the
stickman and will be paid by the dealer to you directly based on
instructions from the stickman.

[edit] Systems

[edit] Martingale system

No betting system can consistently beat casino games of pure chance
such as craps, but that does not stop hopeful gamblers believing in
them. One of the best known systems is the Martingale in which the
player starts by betting $1 and doubles his bet whenever he loses.
Upon winning, he starts over at $1. The idea is to realize a net win
of $1 after every eventual win. This system fails because the player
will either run out of money after having to double his bet several
times in a row after a streak of losing bets, or he will be unable to
bet the amount dictated by the system because it would exceed the
maximum bet allowed by the casino.

[edit] Gambler's fallacy

Other systems depend on the gambler's fallacy, which in craps terms is
the belief that past dice rolls influence the probabilities of future
dice rolls. For example, the gambler's fallacy indicates that a craps
player should bet on eleven if an eleven has not appeared or has
appeared too often in the last 20 rolls. In reality, each roll of the
dice is an independent event, so the probability of rolling an eleven
is exactly 1/18 on every roll, even if eleven has not come up in the
last 100 rolls, or if eleven has come up 5 times in the last 5 rolls.

[edit] Parity hedge system

The parity hedge system is a hoax promulgated by Quatloos. Despite the
fact that no such system exists (indeed, it is a mathematical
impossibility), several gambling-related web sites have retold the
'parity hedge' story without attribution.

[edit] Dice setting or dice control

Main article: Dice control

Another approach is to "set" the dice in a particular orientation,
then throw them in such a manner that they do not tumble randomly. The
theory is that by doing so, one or both of the dice will be more
likely to show certain numbers. Unlike other systems, this one is not
mathematically absurd, because if it were possible to alter the
probabilities of each outcome, then winning systems could be devised.
Nevertheless, the casinos take steps to prevent this. The dice are
supposed to hit the back wall of the table, which makes controlled
spins more difficult. Whether it is possible for human beings to
consistently exercise the precise physical control necessitated by the
theory is a source of controversy. A small but dedicated community of
controlled shooters maintain records and claim proof of dice
influencing in casino conditions. Frank Scoblete and Stanford Wong,
authors of books that feature dice control techniques, believe that it
is possible to alter the odds in the player's favor by dice control.
In addition, some people offer to teach dice-setting skills, for a
substantial fee. However, there has been no independent conclusive
evidence that such methods can be successfully applied in a real
casino.

[edit] Miscellaneous

Craps is such a popular game, its terminology is often found as
colloquialisms in our language. The terms "on a roll", "crapshoot",
"no dice", "crap out", "Snake Eyes" and "do it the hard way" all trace
their origins to the game of craps.

As casinos restrict players' options in blackjack, craps is increasing
in popularity, as it offers the best odds of all standard casino games
based on pure chance.

In the classic crooner song "Luck Be a Lady Tonight," most famously
sung by Frank Sinatra, the lyrics, "A lady doesn't wander all over the
room / And blow on some other guys dice," make reference to point of
craps etiquette. A lady blowing on the shooter's dice before he rolled
was supposed to bring the shooter good luck. It was seen as
inappropriate for a lady to blow on the dice of a man other than the
one she was with at the casino. Of course, the verse can also be
interpreted as a sexual euphemism.

The plot of the musical Guys and Dolls, which is the source of the
above-mentioned song, sung by Marlon Brando in the movie, revolves
around some illegal games of craps, which "float" from location to
location..

In a seemingly unrelated application of this game, one of the Diehard
tests to test for statistical randomness will play several (hundred
thousand) craps games using the input data, and analyze the outcomes.
