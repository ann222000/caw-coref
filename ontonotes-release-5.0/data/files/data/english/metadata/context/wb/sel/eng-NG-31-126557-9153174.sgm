The broadband-based video system heralds the next generation of
telecare provision and is already disrupting older architectures,
according to the Mediagrids company. CareMATE Online, previously known
as &quot;broadcare&quot; advances the telecare industry beyond panic buttons and
voice-only call centres to enable hospitals and care centres to
provide intelligent and discreet visual monitoring of individuals in
their own environments.

The innovative CareMATE Online system is already in use in The
Netherlands where 40 'care hubs' have successfully used it for the
last 6 months. Mediagrids attributes its success to date to strategic
partnerships with specialist healthcare resellers such as iTelecare in
the UK, and TeleZorg Support in The Netherlands and Benelux.
