High-Stakes Flimflam
By BOB HERBERT

It's time to rein in the test zealots who have gotten such a
stranglehold on the public schools in the U.S.

Politicians and others have promoted high-stakes testing as a panacea
that would bring accountability to teaching and substantially boost
the classroom performance of students.

&quot;Measuring,&quot; said President Bush, in a discussion of his No Child Left
Behind law, &quot;is the gateway to success.&quot;

Not only has high-stakes testing largely failed to magically swing
open the gates to successful learning, it is questionable in many
cases whether the tests themselves are anything more than a shell
game.

Daniel Koretz, a professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Education,
told me in a recent interview that it's important to ask &quot;whether you
can trust improvements in test scores when you are holding people
accountable for the tests.&quot;

The short answer, he said, is no.

If teachers, administrators, politicians and others have a stake in
raising the test scores of students - as opposed to improving student
learning, which is not the same thing - there are all kinds of
incentives to raise those scores by any means necessary.

&quot;We've now had four or five different waves of educational reform,&quot;
said Dr. Koretz, &quot;that were based on the idea that if we can just get
a good test in place and beat people up to raise scores, kids will
learn more. That's really what No Child Left Behind is.&quot;

The problem is that you can raise scores the hard way by teaching more
effectively and getting the students to work harder, or you can take
shortcuts and start figuring out ways, as Dr. Koretz put it, to &quot;game&quot;
the system.

Guess what's been happening?

&quot;We've had high-stakes testing, really, since the 1970s in some
states,&quot; said Dr. Koretz. &quot;We've had maybe six good studies that ask:
'If the scores go up, can we believe them? Or are people taking
shortcuts?' And all of those studies found really substantial
inflation of test scores.

&quot;In some cases where there were huge increases in test scores, the
kids didn't actually learn more at all. If you gave them another test,
you saw no improvement.&quot;

There is not enough data available to determine how widespread this
problem is. &quot;We know it doesn't always happen,&quot; said Dr. Koretz. &quot;But
we know it often does.&quot;

He said his big concern is where this might be happening. &quot;There are a
lot of us in the field,&quot; he said, &quot;who think that if we ever really
looked under the covers, what we'd find is that the shortcuts are
particularly prevalent in lower-achieving schools, just because the
pressure is greater, the community supports are less and the kids have
more difficulties. But we don't know.&quot;

One aspect of the No Child Left Behind law that doesn't get enough
attention is that while it requires states to make progress toward
student proficiency in reading and math, it leaves it up to the states
themselves to define &quot;proficiency&quot; and to create the tests that
determine what constitutes progress.

That's absurd. With no guiding standard, the states' tests are
measurements without meaning.

A study released last week by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute and the
Northwest Evaluation Association found that &quot;improvements in passing
rates on state tests can largely be explained by declines in the
difficulty of those tests.&quot;

The people in charge of most school districts would rather jump from
the roof of a tall building than allow an unfettered study of their
test practices. But that kind of analysis is exactly what's needed if
we're to get any real sense of how well students are doing.

Five years ago, President Bush and many others who had little
understanding of the best ways to educate children were crowing about
the prospects of No Child Left Behind. They were warned then about the
dangers of relying too much on test scores.

But those warnings didn't matter in an era in which reality was left
behind.

&quot;No longer is it acceptable to hide poor performance,&quot; said Mr. Bush,
as if those who were genuinely concerned about the flaws in his
approach were in favor of poor performance.

During my interview with Dr. Koretz, he noted that by not rigorously
analyzing the phenomenon of high-stakes testing, &quot;we're creating an
illusion of success that is really nice for everybody in the system
except the kids.&quot;

That was a few days before the release of the Fordham Institute Study,
which used language strikingly similar to Dr. Koretz's. The study
asserted that the tests used by states to measure student progress
under No Child Left Behind were creating &quot;a false impression of
success.&quot;

The study was titled, &quot;The Proficiency Illusion.&quot;
