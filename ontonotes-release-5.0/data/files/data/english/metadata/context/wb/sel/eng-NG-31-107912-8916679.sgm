Gave up trying to get all the performance issues ironed out of my old carb
- last straw was when the car refused to idle - hot or cold. Bought a
rebuilt Solex and popped it on. Started well, runs much better than the old
one but it too will not let the car idle. Engine dies as soon as rpms drop
below approx 1200rpm.

Any suggestions on my next step?

Thanks in advance for help on this AND previous requests for assistance!!!

1)  Idle solenoid working?   Clean idle jet with compressed air?

2)  Timing correct?

3)  Vacuum leaks?  Has manifold ever been removed?

4)  Compression adequate?

1) Idle solenoid - it clicks when I put 12v to it.... Question - should
it click EVERY TIME I put 12v to it? Seems as though it will click but
that's it for a period of time.

2) I believe my timing, while maybe not perfect is close.

3) Vacuum leaks - that was my first suspect and I've checked pretty
thoroughly - spraying WD-40 at all suspicious places

4) Motor is new - 1000K miles - better be sufficient.

Thanks for the quick response!

1000 K  Miles??  Well, there you have it.   LOL

The idle cutoff must click *every* time 12V is applied.
See that it is screwed in tightly and that all the push-on
terminals are tight and the crimps not failed.
Or....run a jumper wire from battery + to the solenoid (as a test).

That may be a red herring, but failure to idle below 1200
sure does sound like the cutoff solenoid.

I took it out, grounded it against the block, applied 12v to it and it
clicks. Take the 12v away for a couple of seconds and reapply 12v and
nothing. If you claim that putting 12v to it, I should get a click, take
12v away for a second, reapply 12v I should get another click on &amp; on &amp;
on... then it's the cutoff solenoid.... Off to find one and I'll report
back.

Found one. Just installed it and I have the same problem. Starts great,
runs great, just won't idle. The slightest pumping will keep it running but
take your foot off and it just dies. For what it's worth, from the few

30PICT carb, right?

2 bad carbs?   Idle circuit clogged.

If I were **100%** certain there were no vacuum leaks anywhere,
I would blow the carb passages out with 100 psi air.

What is a 34PICT doing on a '69??

Is this not the original engine?
If it's now dual port, do a thorough leak test on the manifold, not just
WD40.

BTW, the 34PICT solenoid can't be tested off the carb;
it won't pull in of its own usually.

On a 34PICT, the usual trick is to snip the plunger
off the solenoid.
You could remove the solenoid completely and plug the
opening.

This may be considered &quot;extreme&quot;, but sometimes it is warranted:

Make some sort of temporary adapter to connect an air source
to the manifold (in place of the carb).   You don't need high
pressure air; a vacuum cleaner (reversed) might be enough.
Even a tire air pump.

Remove both rocker shafts so that all the valves are closed.

Start air source and apply soapy solution to all points in the
intake, *including* where the manifold ends meet the heads.

Watch for bubbles.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, it's a 34PICT3. What are the odds that the rebuilt one is
bad?
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's rhetorical.... The new solenoid clicks each and every time,
so
&gt;&gt;&gt; there was a problem with the old one as it would not. Ok, I'll go
&gt; back
&gt;&gt;&gt; and retest for leaks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks Jim for hangin' with me on this.

&gt;&gt; What is a 34PICT doing on a '69??

&gt;&gt; Is this not the original engine?
&gt;&gt; If it's now dual port, do a thorough leak test on the manifold, not
&gt; just
&gt;&gt; WD40.

&gt;&gt; BTW, the 34PICT solenoid can't be tested off the carb;
&gt;&gt; it won't pull in of its own usually.

&gt;&gt; Jim

&gt; Not the original engine. New dual port motor. How can I test for leaks
&gt; on the manifold without using WD40 or some other flammable at seams?

&gt; Checking the timing right now.

Timing is good.Unless there's a way I can test vacuum, I guess it's time
to give up and find a shop here in San Diego that know what they're
doing with bugs....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;then it's the cutoff solenoid.... Off to find one and I'll report

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;back.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you don't find one, e-mail me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jim

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Found one. Just installed it and I have the same problem. Starts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;great, runs great, just won't idle. The slightest pumping will
keep
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it running but take your foot off and it just dies. For what it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;worth, from the few minutes I ran it, it seemed as though I didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;need to keep the revs up nearly as high as before,,, Any further
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;suggestions?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Does this one click every time you apply 12V?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;30PICT carb, right?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2 bad carbs?   Idle circuit clogged.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If I were **100%** certain there were no vacuum leaks anywhere,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I would blow the carb passages out with 100 psi air.

&gt; This may be considered &quot;extreme&quot;, but sometimes it is warranted:

&gt; Make some sort of temporary adapter to connect an air source
&gt; to the manifold (in place of the carb).   You don't need high
&gt; pressure air; a vacuum cleaner (reversed) might be enough.
&gt; Even a tire air pump.

&gt; Remove both rocker shafts so that all the valves are closed.

&gt; Start air source and apply soapy solution to all points in the
&gt; intake, *including* where the manifold ends meet the heads.

&gt; Watch for bubbles.

It may very well be a leak 'down line' from the carb as when I first got
it back from the shop, the intake manifold boots were badly torn,
indicating to me that the shop did a crappy job of finishing up. I
replaced the intake boots and it ran fine for a period of time. Maybe
they were sloppy and didn't lock down something... I'll report back.

Again, thanks a lot!
