You gutless cowards who say you support the iraq war but refuse to
fight in it can no longer say it's because you served in Vietnam or
Gulf War One.  It's a goddam lie and everybody knows it.

Everyone i talked to to says they served in vietnam all agree. War
Sucks and there's nothing better than coming home.

Of course they also all say they would do it again (must be that
brotherhood thing the military has)

but mostly, war sucks, wanna go home.

I can imagine killing people on a daily basis can harm the psyche and
conflict with the &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; rule.

1.  It's not a rule.  It's a commandment.
2.  The Commandment actually states &quot;you shall not commit murder.&quot;
The Old Testament has no problem with war.

It's because i don't believe in war. Nothing hypocritical about me not

The funny thing about that is for about 1,900+ years the Commandment
stated &quot;Thou shall not kill&quot; but that turned out to be somewhat
inconvenient for the Church and governments alike so a &quot;modern&quot;
version was invented. It's just easier that way.

I'm sorry, you're wrong.

If you go to the Judaism 101 website, it states the Sixth Commandment
as Thou Shall Not Murder. The Signet Hebrew/English English/Hebrew
Dictionary also documents that the Sixth Commandment is linguistically
connected for the verb for murder (p.213), not killing (p. 182).

The commandment &quot;you shall not murder&quot; was the standard translation
until 1611 (not &quot;1,900+ years) when King James authorized an English
translation of the Bible.  In common with most other translations of
the period, the New Testament was translated from the Textus Receptus
(Received Text) edition of the Greek texts. The Old Testament was
translated from the Masoretic Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha was
translated from the Greek Septuagint (LXX).

The commandment &quot;thou shall not kill&quot; (Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy
5:17), is better understood to mean &quot;you shall not murder,&quot; most
modern translations of the Bible rendered it this way. According to
the Bible not all killing, the taking of a life, is murder. Murder is
the unlawfully taking of human life. The command not to murder applies
to human beings, not to killing animals or plant life for food.

Tell me, how may years have you served in the Peace Corps?  How many

How have you earned the right to be against the war?

You've done nothing but complain?

anyone can oppose it, regardless of their lack of service?

No, in 1611 it was made politically correct by the order of King

It's &quot;you shall not murder&quot;.  Deal with it.

&gt; Yet another unread leftie who thinks that &quot;Jesus Was A Jew&quot; is a major

Uh-huh. I suppose that's your wishful thinking calling others unread
when it seems you only &quot;read&quot; things that already agree with you
predisposed opinion. It's duly noted.

Pls. tell the class where Jesus said it was ok by him to &quot;kill&quot;
another as long as it wasn't &quot;murder&quot;. I know all you so called modern
Christians love to ignore the fact that Jesus taught pacifisms. If you
claim to be a Christian then you must follow the teaching of the
&quot;Christ&quot; or you are nothing more then hypocrite.

worship is hypocritical and self-centered and is ultimately the reason
Christianity is on the decline. I *understand* you won't *understand*
any of this because your &quot;faith&quot; tells you to blindly believe
everything you're told without using your god-given gift of intellect.
