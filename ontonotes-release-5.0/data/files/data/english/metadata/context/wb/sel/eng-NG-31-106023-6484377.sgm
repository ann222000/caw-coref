Friends,

I registered for Umstead 100 and was fired up to finally be attempting my
first 100.  As is usually the case for me, I didn’t train as well as I
should have.  I ended up finishing only 50, and a pathetic 50 it was.  I
came in dead last among 50-milers, and by far my slowest 50 ever.  Why?
Because since November I have averaged only 17.55 miles per week!  I have
only myself to blame.

However, it was wonderful to be on the course with so many great athletes
and determined souls.  I may leave some out, but I see the Finkles finished
another 100, and Tom Herbst finished another 100 as well.  The Dumars
finished and Pam Carpenter finished the 100 (not sure, may be firsts for
Susan and Pam).  Congratulations to you all!  Your abilities and
perseverance truly blows my mind!

Also, Ed Demoney is still going strong.  And Rob Apple finished his 481’st
ultra!

David Solomon

I posted this to the Mangum Group and Ultralist earlier today.  The e-mail account I used was not recognized by the Google Group.  My apologies to members of both lists that get this twice...

Here is my take on Umstead from my perspective.  Congrats to all who showed the line.  Life is about showing, and doing the best you can on that day in that place...

Best To all.

----------------

Not to counter the weather observers at Umstead that reported it to be "perfect", it was in my candy ass opinion much too warm.  For some it was perfect.

Friday might have been better for me with a High of 69 and Low of 34....now that is great running weather.

Saturday with a high of 79 and low of 47 was unseasonably warm for this Sasquatch.

I was seriously questioning my hydration strategy and the weather while vomiting into the woods at mile 70.

I ran Umstead in 04 and 05 in reportedly bad weather years and had the runs of my life.  Both times setting my 100 PR.

This year after retching at 70 I hobbled to 75 on an empty stomach, ate half a pizza, drank some water and sat for an hour to allow my stomach to process and catch up.

Some days it really is about finishing.  Sometimes people are counting on you to finish.  Somewhere behind me the ever lovely Mrs. Doom was still running to expel her demons from last year.  How could I quit?

It was a perfect day for Susan.  Last year the cold had disheartened her and forced her to drop at 75.  I could not set a bad example this year, she was running well and having a great race.  I headed back on to the course with reduced expectations but a new sense of purpose.

Everybody at the finish line this year, on this Sunday morning, saw tears streaming down my cheeks as my running buddy crossed the line of her first 100.  Susan will write her race report in due course, she was busy getting a cast today.

She hobbled the last loop with a stress fracture of her tibia.  Maybe I'm a bad example after all...

Good weather...Bad Weather....Good Example...Bad Example.  Lots of contradictions in ultrarunning.

The weather will be forgotten, and the leg will heal.

The best ultrarunning experience of my life... Umstead 07.

Perfect weather... Yes,  Perfect indeed.

Cheers,
Doom

Did I mention you guys are the best Track club EVER!

Pam, Sarah Jane, Marie x 2, Doug, Mark, Lucinda, Joey, Ben, Tony, Tom x 2, Richard, Finkles, Laura, Professor, etc...If I missed ya I'm sorry.

All that ran with Susan, asked how she was doing, cheered for her, or just believed in her.

My most profound thanks.

Warmest Regards,
Doom

And I forgot a few words in the opening of that last message....As in... you showed up at the starting line..not...you showed the line.  Try and remember I am a Sasquatch of very little brain.
