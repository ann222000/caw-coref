Went to an Estate sale this weekend.
I always find this rather sad and morbid.....the sales where you walk
through someone's home or condo and all their personal belongings are lying
around like yesterday's trash....usually with hefty prices assigned with magic
marker and masking tape.
Sometimes there are interested parties (family?) sitting in the garage or
kitchen, smoking and watching and shaking their heads.
Here's what bothers me the most about these sales.....besides glassware
and furniture and other misc. items there is almost always a pile of underwear
and bras heaped up in the bedroom. Not to mention the clothing that still
hangs in the closet.....and sometimes even a wig, or an adult potty chair, or
other intensely personal items. And I'm wondering if the family *really*
needs to make those extra couple dollars (if those items sell) and at what
point love for the deceased and respect for their dignity comes into play?
For those of you that manage estate sales...is this ever discussed with
the family? Like, do you suggest removing certain items, like those I
mentioned? Just wondering.
LF
PS I put my purse on the counter while I was packing up some dishes and a
woman picked it up. I told her it was mine and I thought we were going to get
into a scrape until she realized it was MY PURSE and not just something in the
sale I didn't have *in my hands*. It's a jungle out there. :-D

"/> Hi, Fayette

Dead people's used underwear is so disturbing that I no longer
go into bedrooms when estate sales are held in a home.

What's really odd here in Utah is the kind of underwear one often
sees: Mormon &quot;garments&quot; (the &quot;secret&quot; long-john type of thing
that LDS wear full-time *under* their underwear) and which are
never supposed to be seen in public because they're specially
blessed.

But let Aunt BonnieJo die, and someone will come along and put
a $1 price tag on her tatty &quot;garments. Not being LDS, I don't
know for sure but I've been told that one is not supposed to sell
or just throw garments into the trash. One woman told me that
they were supposed to be burnt and given the same respect one
would give to a US flag (but she got a bit ticked when I asked
her if the Boy Scouts were involved).

Used medical supplies like potty chairs and the like bring a
premium.....but they're just scary to me.

Kris

Wigs, underwear, and potty chairs don't bother me. I figure the person
is gone, and if somebody can get some use out of their old belongings,
that's great.

What seems ultra-personal to me are the old letters, postcards, family
photos, etc. that are left out for people to dig through and purchase.

What is a shame, too, is that people don't mark pictures with dates

was the last of his family. No one now knows who any of the people
were or when and where many of the pictures were taken. So sad.

"/> About 20 years ago I tried to get Grandma's potato salad recipe from her. It
was like trying to catch a squirrel in a paper bag. She couldn't repeat the
steps (which were all in her head somewhere) without actually doing it. So
then we tried for devilled eggs. She made them and I wrote down the
instructions. She takes a bottle of vinegar.....tosses in a dash or
two....salt shaker.....shake shake shake, taste, shake head, shake some more.
Well......let's just say my devilled eggs don't taste like Grandma's and I
*follow her directions*.
So when it came to identifying people in old pictures it was a circus.
*If* she remembered the people she would launch into a long story about them,
which wasn't all bad....but we didn't get very far very fast. Nowadays
Grandma swears that teenagers can be seen climbing on her roof and people are
stealing her clothes. Oh alright, we do hide some of them. :-D
But I can guarantee one thing: when my Grandma passes I will be the first
one into her bedroom to remove the personal items to have them destroyed.

grandmother. I sat on a footstool next to her chair and recorded all her
thoughts about our family, her friends, school memories, etc. It is my
cherished possession and for Mother's Day many years ago, I made copies for all
her daughters.

If you are lucky enough to still have your parents, grandmother or grandfather,
I urge everyone to take advantage of your time and get your family history
taped or written down.

Any time I've done estates ( probate appraisals) I've always felt for the first
couple of days I'm not alone with these people's possessions, they all seem to
glare back at me as if I'm an intruder, like a dog that waits for it's master to
return. My brain tells me to get on with it, but my heart says show some respect

"/> How timely, LF.

I just spent a day with my Mom cleaning out Grandma's house. As
executrix it's up to her whether there's a sale or not. First thing
she said is &quot;No clothes....I don't want people pawing through Mom's
clothes.&quot; We threw away all used underwear, and bagged up the rest of
the clothes for the Salvation Army. I guess people pawing through
Grandma's clothes is okay at the thrift store where noone knows they
were hers. We tossed a lot, including all medication, prescription
and non, all partly used soaps, toothpaste, mouthwash, powder puffs,
(cheap) perfumes and the like. And rest assured that no stranger will
have the chance to rifle through personal family papers.

Mom has co-managed a few estate sales for other people. As I recall,
used underwear was tossed beforehand, (who would buy used underwear?
--yeech--) but usually clothes in the closets were sold. Any
leftovers would generally be sent to SA. And she wouldn't sell
personal papers or photos without the executors explicit approval.
Home medical equipment is fair game -- there's always a market for
that stuff, and it's pricy new.

Several (ahem) years ago when our children were younger, my friend did a
load of laundry. &quot;Klunk,klunk,&quot; said the clothes dryer. Investigating, my
friend discovered a dental partial plate that could only have come out of
the pocket of her seven-year-old's jeans. She called her (soon to be ex-)
husband and said, &quot; Why does Thomas have your teeth?&quot;&quot;What are you talking
about?&quot; said Soon To Be Ex. &quot;My teeth are in MY mouth.&quot; Seems Thomas had
made an unauthorized visit to the elderly next door neighbor while she was
preparing for a house clearance sale. She had made a gift of her deceased
husband's dentures.
