Chap. 8 - Preaching the Distinctive Truths
Heralding the Second Advent

Rouse People to Preparation.--We are living in the close of this
earth's history. . . . Prophecy is fulfilling. Soon Christ will come with
power and great glory. We have no time to lose. Let the message sound forth
in earnest words of warning. {Ev 217.1}

We must persuade men everywhere to repent and flee from the wrath to
come. They have souls to save or to lose. Let there be no indifference in
this matter. The Lord calls for workers who are filled with an earnest,
decided purpose. Tell the people to be instant in season and out of season.
With the words of life upon your lips go forth to tell men and women that
the end of all things is at hand. {Ev 217.2}

Let us keep our souls in the love of God. The note of warning must be
given. The truth must not languish upon our lips. We must rouse people to
immediate preparation, for we little know what is before us. My faith is as
strong as ever that we are living in the last remnant of time. Let every
teacher present an open door before all who will come to Jesus, repenting of
their sins.--Letter 105, 1903. {Ev 217.3}

Proclaim It in Every Land.--I have been instructed to trace words of
warning for our brethren and sisters who are in danger of losing sight of
the special work for this time. . . . In every land we are to herald the

218
second coming of Christ, in the language of the revelator proclaiming:
"Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him."--Testimonies,
vol. 8, p. 116. (1904) {Ev 217.4}

The time has come when the message of Christ's soon coming is to sound
throughout the world.-- Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 24. (1909) {Ev 218.1}

Message, "The Lord Is Coming."--The Lord is coming. Lift up your heads
and rejoice. Oh, we would think that those who hear the joyful news, who
claim to love Jesus, would be filled with joy unutterable and full of glory.
This is the good, the joyful news which should electrify every soul, which
should be repeated in our homes, and told to those whom we meet on the
street. What more joyful news can be communicated! . . . {Ev 218.2}

The voice of the true watchman needs now to be heard all along the
line, "The morning cometh, and also the night." The trumpet must give a
certain sound, for we are in the great day of the Lord's
preparation.--Letter 55, 1886. {Ev 218.3}

No Time to Lose.--Sound an alarm through the land. Tell the people that
the day of the Lord is near, and hasteth greatly. Let none be left unwarned.
We might have been in the place of the poor souls who are in error.
According to the truth that we have received above others, we are debtors to
impart the same to them. {Ev 218.4}

We have no time to lose. The powers of darkness are working with
intense energy, and with stealthy tread Satan is advancing to take those who
are now asleep, as a wolf taking his prey. We have warnings now which we may
give, a work now which we may do, but soon it will be more difficult than we
imagine. . . .

219
{Ev 218.5}

The coming of the Lord is nearer than when we first believed. The great
controversy is nearing its end. Every report of calamity by sea or land is a
testimony to the fact that the end of all things is at hand. Wars and rumors
of wars declare it. Is there a Christian whose pulse does not beat with
quickened action as he anticipates the great events opening before us? {Ev
219.1}

The Lord is coming. We hear the footsteps of an approaching God, as He
comes to punish the world for its iniquity. We are to prepare the way for
Him by acting our part in getting a people ready for that great day.--Review
and Herald, Nov. 12, 1914. {Ev 219.2}

Living Power Must Attend Message.--Living power must attend the message
of Christ's second appearing. We must not rest until we see many souls
converted to the blessed hope of the Lord's return. In the days of the
apostles the message that they bore wrought a real work, turning souls from
idols to serve the living God. The work to be done today is just as real,
and the truth is just as much truth; only we are to give the message with as
much more earnestness as the coming of the Lord is nearer. The message for
this time is positive, simple, and of the deepest importance. We must act
like men and women who believe it. Waiting, watching, working, praying,
warning the world--this is our work. . . . {Ev 219.3}

All heaven is astir, engaged in preparing for the day of God's
vengeance, the day of Zion's deliverance. The time of tarrying is almost
ended. The pilgrims and strangers who have so long been seeking a better
country are almost home. I feel as if I must cry aloud, Homeward bound!
Rapidly we are nearing the time when Christ will come to gather His redeemed
to Himself.--Review and Herald, Nov. 13, 1913.

220
{Ev 219.4}

All Discourses in Light of Christ's Coming.--The truths of prophecy are
bound up together, and as we study them, they form a beautiful cluster of
practical Christian truth. All the discourses that we give are plainly to
reveal that we are waiting, working, and praying for the coming of the Son
of God. His coming is our hope. This hope is to be bound up with all our
words and works, with all our associations and relationships.--Letter 150,
1902. {Ev 220.1}

Key to History.--An understanding of the hope of Christ's second coming
is the key that unlocks all the history that follows, and explains all the
future lessons. --Letter 218, 1906. {Ev 220.2}

Effect of Preaching the Second Advent.--The second coming of the Son of
man is to be the wonderful theme kept before the people. Here is a subject
that should not be left out of our discourses. Eternal realities must be
kept before the mind's eye, and the attractions of the world will appear as
they are, altogether profitless as vanity. What are we to do with the
world's vanities, its praises, its riches, its honors, or its enjoyments?
{Ev 220.3}

We are pilgrims and strangers who are waiting, hoping, and praying for
that blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ. If we believe this and bring it into our practical life, what
vigorous action would this faith and hope inspire; what fervent love one for
another; what careful holy living for the glory of God; and in our respect
for the recompense of the reward, what distinct lines of demarcation would
be evidenced between us and the world.--Manuscript 39, 1893. {Ev 220.4}

Keep It Before the People.--The truth that Christ is coming should be
kept before every mind.--Letter 131, 1900.

221
{Ev 220.5}

A Caution Against Time-Setting Expressions.--The times and seasons God
has put in His own power. And why has not God given us this knowledge?--
Because we would not make a right use of it if He did. A condition of things
would result from this knowledge among our people that would greatly retard
the work of God in preparing a people to stand in the great day that is to
come. We are not to be engrossed with speculations in regard to the times
and the seasons which God has not revealed. Jesus has told His disciples to
"watch," but not for definite time. His followers are to be in the position
of those who are listening for the orders of their Captain; they are to
watch, wait, pray, and work, as they approach the time for the coming of the
Lord; but no one will be able to predict just when that time will come; for
"of that day and hour knoweth no man." You will not be able to say that He
will come in one, two, or five years, neither are you to put off His coming
by stating that it may not be for ten or twenty years. . . . We are not to
know the definite time either for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit or for
the coming of Christ.--Review and Herald, March 22, 1892. {Ev 221.1}

The Sanctuary Truth

The Foundation of Our Faith.--The correct understanding of the
ministration in the heavenly sanctuary is the foundation of our
faith.--Letter 208, 1906. {Ev 221.2}

The Center of Christ's Atoning Work.--The subject of the sanctuary and
the investigative judgment should be clearly understood by the people of
God. All need a knowledge for themselves of the position

222
and work of their great High Priest. Otherwise, it will be impossible for
them to exercise the faith which is essential at this time, or to occupy the
position which God designs them to fill. Every individual has a soul to save
or to lose. Each has a case pending at the bar of God. Each must meet the
great Judge face to face. How important, then, that every mind contemplate
often the solemn scene when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be
opened, when, with Daniel, every individual must stand in his lot, at the
end of the days. {Ev 221.3}

All who have received the light upon these subjects are to bear
testimony of the great truths which God has committed to them. The sanctuary
in heaven is the very center of Christ's work in behalf of men. It concerns
every soul living upon the earth. It opens to view the plan of redemption,
bringing us down to the very close of time, and revealing the triumphant
issue of the contest between righteousness and sin. It is of the utmost
importance that all should thoroughly investigate these subjects, and be
able to give an answer to every one that asketh them a reason of the hope
that is in them.--The Great Controversy, pp. 488, 489. (1888) {Ev 222.1}

The Key to a Complete System of Truth.--The subject of the sanctuary
was the key which unlocked the mystery of the disappointment of 1844. It
opened to view a complete system of truth, connected and harmonious, showing
that God's hand had directed the great advent movement, and revealing
present duty as it brought to light the position and work of His
people.--The Great Controversy, p. 423, (1888) {Ev 222.2}

Eyes Fixed on Sanctuary.--As a people, we should be earnest students of
prophecy; we should not rest until we become intelligent in regard to the
subject

223
of the sanctuary, which is brought out in the visions of Daniel and John.
This subject sheds great light on our present position and work, and gives
us unmistakable proof that God has led us in our past experience. It
explains our disappointment in 1844, showing us that the sanctuary to be
cleansed was not the earth, as we had supposed, but that Christ then entered
into the most holy apartment of the heavenly sanctuary, and is there
performing the closing work of His priestly office, in fulfillment of the
words of the angel to the prophet Daniel, "Unto two thousand and three
hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." {Ev 222.3}

Our faith in reference to the messages of the first, second, and third
angels was correct. The great waymarks we have passed are immovable.
Although the hosts of hell may try to tear them from their foundation, and
triumph in the thought that they have succeeded, yet they do not succeed.
These pillars of truth stand firm as the eternal hills, unmoved by all the
efforts of men combined with those of Satan and his host. We can learn much,
and should be constantly searching the Scriptures to see if these things are
so. God's people are now to have their eyes fixed on the heavenly sanctuary,
where the final ministration of our great High Priest in the work of the
judgment is going forward,--where He is interceding for His people.--Review
and Herald, Nov. 27, 1883. {Ev 223.1}

The Central Truth in a Simple Theology.--In every school established
the most simple theory of theology should be taught. In this theory, the
atonement of Christ should be the great substance, the central truth. The
wonderful theme of redemption should be presented to the
students.--Manuscript 156, 1898.

224
{Ev 223.2}

Seriousness of Sanctuary Truth.--While Christ is cleansing the
sanctuary, the worshipers on earth should carefully review their life, and
compare their character with the standard of righteousness.--Review and
Herald, April 8, 1890. {Ev 224.1}

Preaching the Sanctuary Doctrine Endorsed by Holy Spirit.--For more
than half a century the different points of present truth have been
questioned and opposed. New theories have been advanced as truth, which were
not truth, and the Spirit of God revealed their error. As the great pillars
of our faith have been presented, the Holy Spirit has borne witness to them,
and especially is this so regarding the truths of the sanctuary question.
Over and over again the Holy Spirit has in a marked manner endorsed the
preaching of this doctrine. But today, as in the past, some will be led to
form new theories and to deny the truths upon which the Spirit of God has
placed His approval.--Manuscript 125, 1907. {Ev 224.2}

False Theories Regarding the Sanctuary.--In the future, deception of
every kind is to arise, and we want solid ground for our feet. We want solid
pillars for the building. Not one pin is to be removed from that which the
Lord has established. The enemy will bring in false theories, such as the
doctrine that there is no sanctuary. This is one of the points on which
there will be a departing from the faith. Where shall we find safety unless
it be in the truths that the Lord has been giving for the last fifty
years?--Review and Herald, May 25, 1905. {Ev 224.3}

Contest Over Distinguishing Truth.--The time is near when the deceptive
powers of satanic agencies will be fully developed. On one side is Christ,
who has been given all power in heaven and earth. On the other side is
Satan, continually exercising his

225
power to allure, to deceive with strong, spiritualistic sophistries, to
remove God out of the places that He should occupy in the minds of men. {Ev
224.4}

Satan is striving continually to bring in fanciful suppositions in
regard to the sanctuary, degrading the wonderful representations of God and
the ministry of Christ for our salvation into something that suits the
carnal mind. He removes its presiding power from the hearts of believers,
and supplies its place with fantastic theories invented to make void the
truths of the atonement, and destroy our confidence in the doctrines which
we have held sacred since the third angel's message was first given. Thus he
would rob us of our faith in the very message that has made us a separate
people, and has given character and power to our work.--Special Testimonies,
Series B, No. 7, p. 17. (1905) {Ev 225.1}

Presenting the Law and the
Sabbath

Our Special Message.--The Lord has a special message for His
ambassadors to bear. They are to give the people the warning, calling upon
them to repair the breach that has been made by the Papacy in the law of
God. The Sabbath has been made a nonentity, an unessential requirement,
which human authority can set aside. The holy day of the Lord has been
changed to a common working day. Men have torn down God's memorial, placing
a false rest day in its stead.--Manuscript 35, 1900. {Ev 225.2}

The Last Message to the World.--The last message of warning to the
world is to lead men to see the importance that God attaches to His law. So
plainly

226
is the truth to be presented that no transgressor, hearing it, shall be
excusable in failing to discern the importance of obedience to God's
commands. {Ev 225.3}

I am instructed to say, Gather from the Scriptures the proofs that God
has sanctified the seventh day, and let these proofs be read before the
congregation. Let those who have not heard the truth be shown that all who
turn aside from a plain "Thus saith the Lord," must suffer the result of
their course. In all ages the Sabbath has been the test of loyalty to God.
"It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever," the Lord
declares.--Gospel Workers, pp. 148, 149. (1915) {Ev 226.1}

The Deciding Question for Whole World.--The light concerning the
binding claims of the law of God is to be presented everywhere. This is to
be a deciding question. It will test and prove the world.--Special
Testimonies, Series A, No. 7, pp. 17, 18. (1874) {Ev 226.2}

The Build-up in New Fields.--I have had to break off writing to have an
interview with Brother _____. He is in some perplexity. . . . He wished to
know how to present the truth in entering new fields, whether the Sabbath
should be presented first. {Ev 226.3}

I told him that the best and wisest plan would be to dwell upon
subjects that would arouse the conscience. He could talk to them upon
practical godliness; devotion and piety; and present the self-denial,
self-sacrificing life of Jesus as our example until they will see the
contrast in their self-indulgent life, and become dissatisfied with their
unchristian lives. {Ev 226.4}

Then present to them the prophecies; show them the purity and binding
claims of the Word of God. Not one jot or tittle of this law is to lose its
force, but hold its binding claims on every soul to the end of time. When
the law of God is made void; when

227
the Christian world is joined to the Catholic and the worldly, in making of
none effect the commandments of God, then God's chosen people arise to
defend the law of Jehovah. {Ev 226.5}

This is the guile that Paul used; this is the wisdom of the serpent;
the harmlessness of the dove. When we come to a community that is acquainted
with our faith, this cautious course need not to be pursued, but in every
case special efforts should be made to come close to hearts by personal
efforts. Avoid running down the churches; do not let the people receive the
idea that your work is to tear down, but to build up, and to present the
truth as it is in Jesus. Dwell much upon the necessity of vital
godliness.--Letter 2, 1885. {Ev 227.1}

Broaching the Sabbath in New Fields.--The message of truth is new and
startling to the people of this country [Australia]. The Bible doctrines
presented are as a new revelation, and they really look upon the sentiments
advanced as infidelity. In presenting the Sunday question, or the union of
church and state, handle it carefully. It will not answer to present the
strong positions that have been and will of necessity be presented in
America. {Ev 227.2}

These subjects must be broached guardedly. We have not as yet obtained
standing place in this country. The enemy of all righteousness has been and
still is working by every device he can invent to hinder the work that ought
to be done in enlightening and educating the people; his forces are
increasing. Delays have been giving Satan advantage of the situation, and
these delays have caused the loss of many souls. The Lord is not pleased
with the retarding of the work. Every delay renders more difficult the work
that must be done, because advantage is given for

228
Satan to preoccupy the field, and prepare for determined resistance. {Ev
227.3}

The tardy movements of our people in raising the standard in our large
cities are not in harmony with the light given of God. A glimmering of light
has been shining in the cities, but just enough to make the false shepherds
feel that it is time for them to be actively at work in presenting fables
and falsehoods to turn the people away from the message of truth. Some
little effort has been made, but men and money are not furnished to do the
work. Satan has worked and will work with his lying wonders, and strong
delusions will be accepted where the banner of truth should have been
uplifted. Now the fact that God's people that know the truth have failed to
do their duty according to the light given in the Word of God, makes it a
necessity for us to be more guarded, lest we offend unbelievers before they
have heard the reasons of our faith in regard to the Sabbath and Sunday. . .
. {Ev 228.1}

There is need now to give to the people patient, kind instruction; the
education of a lifetime is not to be readily counteracted; great tact and
patient effort are needed by those who shall present the truth in any
manner.--Undated Manuscript 79. {Ev 228.2}

Defer Its Presentation.--You should not feel it your duty to introduce
arguments upon the Sabbath question as you meet the people. If persons
mention the subject, tell them that this is not your burden now. But when
they surrender heart and mind and will to God, they are then prepared
candidly to weigh evidence in regard to these solemn, testing
truths.--Letter 77, 1895. {Ev 228.3}

Caution Against Undue Delay.--Caution is needed; but while some of the
workers are guarded, and make

229
haste slowly, if there are not united with them in the work those who see
the necessity of being aggressive, very much will be lost; opportunities
will pass, and the opening providence of God will not be discerned. {Ev
228.4}

When persons who are under conviction are not brought to make a
decision at the earliest period possible, there is danger that the
conviction will gradually wear away. . . . {Ev 229.1}

Frequently when a congregation is at the very point where the heart is
prepared for the Sabbath question, it is delayed through fear of the
consequences. This has been done, and the result has not been good.-- Letter
31, 1892. {Ev 229.2}

In a Brief Campaign.--When you have a congregation before you for only
two weeks, do not defer the presentation of the Sabbath question until
everything else is presented, supposing that you thus pave the way for it.
Lift up the standard, the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. Make
this the important theme. Then, by your strong arguments, make it of still
greater force. Dwell more on the Revelation. Read, explain, and enforce its
teaching. {Ev 229.3}

Our warfare is aggressive. Tremendous issues are before us, yea, and
right upon us. Let our prayers ascend to God that the four angels may still
hold the four winds, that they may not blow to injure or destroy until the
last warning has been given to the world. Then let us work in harmony with
our prayers. Let nothing lessen the force of the truth for this time. The
present truth is to be our burden. The third angel's message must do its
work of separating from the churches a people who will take their stand on
the platform of eternal truth.--Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 61 (1900)

230
{Ev 229.4}

Life and Death Message.--We are as a people in danger of giving the
third angel's message in such an indefinite manner that it does not impress
the people. . . . Our message is a life-and-death message, and we must let
this message appear as it is,--the great power of God. Then the Lord will
make it effectual. We are to present it in all its telling force.--Letter
209, 1899. {Ev 230.1}

Message Not Muffled.--Satan has devised a state of things whereby the
proclamation of the third angel's message shall be bound about. We must
beware of his plans and methods. There must be no toning down of the truth,
no muffling of the message for this time. The third angel's message must be
strengthened and confirmed. The eighteenth chapter of Revelation reveals the
importance of presenting the truth in no measured terms but with boldness
and power.... There has been too much beating about the bush in the
proclamation of the third angel's message. The message has not been given as
clearly and distinctly as it should have been.--Manuscript 16, 1900. {Ev
230.2}

As Christ Presented the Law.--Christ presented the principles of the
law of God in a direct, forcible way, showing His hearers that they had
neglected to carry out these principles. His words were so definite and
pointed that the listeners found no opportunity to cavil or raise
objections.--Review and Herald, Sept. 13, 1906. {Ev 230.3}

Paul Adapted His Methods.--To the Gentiles, he [Paul] preached Christ
as their only hope of salvation, but did not at first have anything definite
to say upon the law. But after their hearts were warmed with the
presentation of Christ as the gift of God to our world, and what was
comprehended in the work of the Redeemer in the costly sacrifice to manifest
the love of

231
God to man, in the most eloquent simplicity he showed that love for all
mankind--Jew and Gentile--that they might be saved by surrendering their
hearts to Him. Thus when, melted and subdued, they gave themselves to the
Lord, he presented the law of God as the test of their obedience. This was
the manner of his working--adapting his methods to win souls.-- Special
Testimonies, Series A, No. 6, p. 55. (1895) {Ev 230.4}

First the Fundamental Principles.--Do not make prominent those features
of the message which are a condemnation of the customs and practices of the
people, until they have opportunity to know that we are believers in Christ,
that we believe in His divinity and in His pre-existence. Let the testimony
of the world's Redeemer be dwelt upon.--Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 58. (1900)
{Ev 231.1}

We Preach the Gospel.--Let the outsiders understand that we preach the
gospel as well as the law, and they will feast upon these truths, and many
will take their stand for the truth.--Letter 1, 1889. {Ev 231.2}

Will Convict of Sin.--The law and the gospel, revealed in the Word, are
to be preached to the people; for the law and the gospel, blended, will
convict of sin. God's law, while condemning sin, points to the gospel,
revealing Jesus Christ, in whom "dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead
bodily." The glory of the gospel reflects light upon the Jewish age, giving
significance to the whole Jewish economy of types and shadows. Thus both the
law and the gospel are blended. In no discourse are they to be divorced.--
Manuscript 21, 1891. {Ev 231.3}

The religionist generally has divorced the law and the gospel, while we
have on the other hand almost done the same from another standpoint. We have
not held up before the people the righteousness of Christ

232
and the full significance of His great plan of redemption. We have left out
Christ and His matchless love, and brought in the theories and reasonings,
preached arguments.--Manuscript 24, 1890. {Ev 231.4}

They Go Hand in Hand.--If we would have the spirit and power of the
third angel's message, we must present the law and the gospel together, for
they go hand in hand.--Gospel Workers, p. 161. (1915) {Ev 232.1}

Reinforce the Message With Literature.--The days in which we live are
times that call for constant vigilance, times in which God's people should
be awake to do a great work in presenting the light on the Sabbath question.
. . . This last warning to the inhabitants of the earth is to make men see
the importance God attaches to His holy law. So plainly is the truth to be
presented that no transgressor, hearing it, shall fail to discern the
importance of obedience to the Sabbath commandment. . . . {Ev 232.2}

There is work for all to do in order that the simple truths of the Word
of God may be made known. The words of Scripture should be printed and
published just as they read. It would be well if the nineteenth and the
greater portion of the twentieth chapters of Exodus, with verses twelve to
eighteen of the thirty-first chapter, were printed just as they stand. Crowd
these truths into small books and pamphlets, and let the word of God speak
to the people. When a discourse concerning the law is preached that is right
to the point, if you have any means of doing so, get it into a printed
leaflet. Then when those who plead for Sunday laws meet you, place these
leaflets in their hands. Tell them that you have no discussion over the
Sunday question, for you have a plain "Thus saith the Lord" for the keeping
of the seventh day.-- Review and Herald, March 26, 1908.

233
{Ev 232.3}

Make the Distinguishing Mark Prominent.--We are to give to the world a
manifestation of the pure, noble, holy principles that are to distinguish
the people of God from the world. Instead of the people of God becoming less
and less definitely distinguished from those who do not keep the seventh-day
Sabbath, they are to make the observance of the Sabbath so prominent that
the world cannot fail to recognize them as Seventh-day
Adventist.--Manuscript 162, 1903. {Ev 233.1}

Called to Expose Man of Sin.--In the very time in which we live the
Lord has called His people and has given them a message to bear. He has
called them to expose the wickedness of the man of sin who has made the
Sunday law a distinctive power, who has thought to change times and laws,
and to oppress the people of God who stand firmly to honor Him by keeping
the only true Sabbath, the Sabbath of creation, as holy unto the
Lord.--Testimonies to Ministers, p. 118. (1903) {Ev 233.2}

A Distinct People With a Testing Message.--The Lord has been pleased to
give His people the third angel's message as a testing message to bear to
the world. John beholds a people distinct and separate from the world, who
refuse to worship the beast or his image, who bear God's sign, keeping holy
His Sabbath--the seventh-day to be kept holy as a memorial of the living
God, the Creator of heaven and earth. Of them the apostle writes, "Here are
they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."-- Letter
98, 1900. {Ev 233.3}

The Mark of the Beast.--When Sunday observance shall be enforced by
law, and the world shall be enlightened concerning the obligation of the
true Sabbath, then whoever shall transgress the command of

234
God, to obey a precept which has no higher authority than that of Rome, will
thereby honor popery above God. He is paying homage to Rome, and to the
power which enforces the institution ordained by Rome. He is worshiping the
beast and his image. As men then reject the institution which God has
declared to be the sign of His authority, and honor in its stead that which
Rome has chosen as the token of her supremacy, they will thereby accept the
sign of allegiance to Rome,--"the mark of the beast." And it is not until
the issue is thus plainly set before the people, and they are brought to
choose between the commandments of God and the commandments of men, that
those who continue in transgression will receive "the mark of the
beast."--The Great Controversy, p. 449. (1888) {Ev 233.4}

Reception of Mark of the Beast Future.--The change of the Sabbath is
the sign or mark of the authority of the Romish church. Those who,
understanding the claims of the fourth commandment, choose to observe the
false sabbath in the place of the true, are thereby paying homage to that
power by which alone it is commanded. The mark of the beast is the papal
sabbath, which has been accepted by the world in the place of the day of
God's appointment. {Ev 234.1}

No one has yet received the mark of the beast. The testing time has not
yet come. There are true Christians in every church, not excepting the Roman
Catholic communion. None are condemned until they have had the light and
have seen the obligation of the fourth commandment. But when the decree
shall go forth enforcing the counterfeit sabbath, and the loud cry of the
third angel shall warn men against the worship of the beast and his image,
the line will be clearly drawn between the false and the true. Then

235
those who still continue in transgression will receive the mark of the
beast. {Ev 234.2}

With rapid steps we are approaching this period. When Protestant
churches shall unite with the secular power to sustain a false religion, for
opposing which their ancestors endured the fiercest persecution, then will
the papal sabbath be enforced by the combined authority of church and state.
There will be a national apostasy, which will end only in national
ruin. --Manuscript 51, 1899. {Ev 235.1}

When Seal of God Is Refused.--If the light of truth has been presented
to you, revealing the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and showing that
there is no foundation in the Word of God for Sunday observance, and yet you
still cling to the false sabbath, refusing to keep holy the Sabbath which
God calls "My holy day," you receive the mark of the beast. When does this
take place? When you obey the decree that commands you to cease from labor
on Sunday and worship God, while you know that there is not a word in the
Bible showing Sunday to be other than a common working day, you consent to
receive the mark of the beast, and refuse the seal of God.--Review and
Herald, July 13, 1897. {Ev 235.2}

As a Result of Disregard of Light.--God has given men the Sabbath as a
sign between Him and them, as a test of their loyalty. Those who, after the
light regarding God's law comes to them, continue to disobey and exalt human
laws above the law of God in the great crisis before us will receive the
mark of the beast.--Letter 98, 1900. {Ev 235.3}

Caution in Presenting the Sunday Question.--[We are] not to provoke
those who have accepted this spurious sabbath, an institution of the Papacy
in the place of God's holy Sabbath. Their not having the

236
Bible arguments in their favor makes them all the more angry and determined
to supply the place of arguments that are wanting in the Word of God by the
power of their might. The force of persecution follows the steps of the
dragon. Therefore great care should be exercised to give no
provocation.--Letter 55, 1886. {Ev 235.4}

Let the Truth Do the Cutting.--Satan's efforts against the advocates of
the truth will wax more bitter and determined to the very close of time. As
in Christ's day the chief priests and rulers stirred up the people against
Him, so today the religious leaders will excite bitterness and prejudice
against the truth for this time. The people will be led to acts of violence
and opposition which they would never have thought of had they not been
imbued with the animosity of professed Christians against the truth. {Ev
236.1}

And what course shall the advocates of truth pursue? They have the
unchangeable, eternal Word of God, and they should reveal the fact that they
have the truth as it is in Jesus. Their words must not be rugged and sharp.
In their presentation of truth they must manifest the love and meekness and
gentleness of Christ. Let the truth do the cutting; the Word of God is as a
sharp, two-edged sword, and will cut its way to the heart. Those who know
that they have the truth should not, by the use of harsh and severe
expressions, give Satan one chance to misinterpret their spirit.--Review and
Herald, Oct. 14, 1902. {Ev 236.2}

A Call to Enlighten the Masses.--I have been shown that Satan is
stealing a march upon us. The law of God, through the agency of Satan, is to
be made void. In our land of boasted freedom, religious liberty will come to
an end. The contest will be decided over the Sabbath question, which will
agitate the whole world.

237
{Ev 236.3}

Our time for work is limited, and God calls us as ministers and people
to be minutemen. Teachers as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves must
come to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.
There are many who do not understand the prophecies relating to these days,
and they must be enlightened.--Letter 1, 1875. {Ev 237.1}

Meeting Sabbathkeeping Problems

No Cause to Worry or Fear.--Often when our workers present the testing
Sabbath truth to the people, some stand hesitating for fear of bringing
poverty and hardship upon themselves and their families. They say, Yes, I
see what you are trying to show me in regard to the observance of the
seventh-day Sabbath; but I am afraid if I keep the Sabbath I shall lose my
position, and shall not be able to provide for my family. And so, many keep
their worldly position and disobey the command of God. But these scriptures
[Luke 12:1-7] teach us that the Lord knows all about our experiences; He
understands about our inconveniences; and He has a care for all who follow
on to know the Lord. He will never allow His children to be tempted above
that they are able to bear. {Ev 237.2}

Christ declared to His disciples: "Take no thought for your life, what
ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on. The life is more
than meat, and the body is more than raiment. Consider the ravens: for they
neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God
feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls? And which of you
with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? If ye then be not able
to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?"

238
{Ev 237.3}

Holding up before them the lily of the field in its beauty and purity,
the Saviour continued: "Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not,
they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these. If then God so clothe the grass, which is today
in the field, and tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more will He
clothe you, O ye of little faith? {Ev 238.1}

"And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be
ye of doubtful mind. For all these things do the nations of the world seek
after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. But rather
seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you."
{Ev 238.2}

Christ is here teaching a precious lesson in regard to His service.
Whatever experiences may come to you, He says, serve God. Whatever
inconveniences and hardships you may encounter, trust in the Lord. We have
no cause to worry and fear if we take our position for the truth, that we
and our families will suffer. To do this is to manifest unbelief in God.
"Your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things," the Saviour says.
If we would study the Word more faithfully, we would increase in
faith.--Manuscript 83, 1909. {Ev 238.3}

Time to Extend a Helping Hand.--It is an important time now for these
localities where an interest has been awakened. A large number . . . are in
the valley of decision. O that the Lord will give to His servants wisdom to
speak to these souls such words as shall give them courage to confess the
truth and surrender their will, their heart's entire devotion, to God. We
pray that the Lord will inspire with faith these souls who are convinced of
the truth, that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, that they shall

239
not confer with their own feelings and let the enemy lead them to decide
that the sacrifice is too great. {Ev 238.4}

They will suffer loss in temporal matters, and a helping hand must not
be wanting. Many ask, "How can we support our families? We shall lose our
positions as soon as we decide to keep holy the seventh day and do no work
on the Sabbath. Our families, shall they starve?" What can we say? Poverty
and want are seen everywhere, and honest souls know not what to do. They
dare not venture out; yet they are fully convinced that the seventh day is
the Sabbath of the Lord. They know that God blessed the seventh day and set
it apart for man to observe as a memorial of His creating of the world in
six days and His rest upon the seventh day. {Ev 239.1}

When we see the difficulties standing like mountains before their
souls, the prospect of want to themselves and children staring them in the
face, our hearts are pained. Many a one says, "I want to observe the seventh
day, but as soon as I state to my employer that I have decided to keep the
Sabbath, I shall be discharged." Hundreds are waiting to step into any place
made vacant. I am sorely troubled. All we can do is to encourage them to
have faith, and pray for them. Oh, sometimes I wish I had a million dollars.
I could use every dollar in this work. . . . {Ev 239.2}

Many become decided transgressors of God's holy law as the result of
union, concord, and co-operation with companions who are instruments of
Satan. God sends them light to undeceive them, but they refuse to take the
Word of God as it reads. They accept error, choosing the lies of Satan
rather than a "Thus saith the Lord." And these advocates of error make it
very hard for those who see the truth to obey it. Human sight can see
nothing but starvation before those who keep the Sabbath.--Manuscript 19,
1894.

240
{Ev 239.3}

Never Results in Starvation.--Never need anyone fear that observance of
the true Sabbath will result in starvation. [Isa. 58:11, 12; Prov. 7:2; Isa.
58:14.] These promises are a sufficient answer to all the excuses that man
may invent for refusing to keep the Sabbath. Even if, after beginning to
keep God's law, it seems impossible to support one's family, let every
doubting soul realize that God has promised to care for those who obey His
commandments.--Manuscript 116, 1902. {Ev 240.1}

It Takes Men of Courage.--It requires moral courage to take a position
to keep the commandments of the Lord. An opposer of the truth once said that
it was only weak-minded people, foolish, ignorant persons, who would turn
away from the churches to keep the seventh day as the Sabbath. But a
minister who had embraced the truth, replied, "If you think it takes
weak-minded persons, just try it." It takes moral courage, firmness,
decision, perseverance, and very much prayer to step out on the unpopular
side. We are thankful that we can come to Christ as the poor suffering ones
came to Christ in the temple. . . . {Ev 240.2}

You have not dared to trample under foot the commandments of God, and
have stepped out on unpopular truth, let the result be what it may. Will the
Saviour ever turn away to leave you to struggle alone? No, never. But He
never told His disciples that they should have no trials, no self-denial to
endure, no sacrifices to make. The Master was a man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief. "Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, how that
though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His
poverty might be rich." We thank God that in your poverty you can call God
your Father. {Ev 240.3}

Poverty is coming upon this world, and there will

241
be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation. There will
be wars and rumors of wars, and the faces of men will gather paleness. You
may have to suffer distress; you may go hungry sometimes; but God will not
forsake you in your suffering. He will test your faith. We are not to live
to please ourselves. We are here to manifest Christ to the world, to
represent Him and His power to mankind.--Manuscript 37, 1894. {Ev 240.4}

Time to Rely on God's Word.--In the wilderness, when all means of
sustenance failed, God sent His people manna from heaven; and a sufficient
and constant supply was given. This provision was to teach them that while
they trusted in God, and walked in His ways, He would not forsake them. The
Saviour now practiced the lesson He had taught to Israel. By the word of
God, succor had been given to the Hebrew host, and by the same word it would
be given to Jesus. He awaited God's time to bring relief. He was in the
wilderness in obedience to God, and He would not obtain food by following
the suggestions of Satan. In the presence of the witnessing universe, He
testified that it is a less calamity to suffer whatever may befall, than to
depart in any manner from the will of God. {Ev 241.1}

"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God." Often
the follower of Christ is brought where he cannot serve God and carry
forward his worldly enterprises. Perhaps it appears that obedience to some
plain requirement of God will cut off his means of support. Satan would make
him believe that he must sacrifice his conscientious convictions. But the
only thing in our world upon which we can rely, is the Word of God. "Seek ye
first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall
be added unto you." Even in this life it is not

242
for our good to depart from the will of our Father in heaven. When we learn
the power of His word, we shall not follow the suggestions of Satan in order
to obtain food or to save our lives. Our only questions will be, What is
God's command? and what His promise? Knowing these, we shall obey the one,
and trust the other.--The Desire of Ages, p. 121. (1898) {Ev 241.2}

An Appeal to One in the Valley of Decision.--The enemy was telling you
to wait for a more convenient season. He has been on hand with his devices
presenting to you the advantages you would gain if you did not keep the
Sabbath, and the disadvantages you would realize in keeping the Sabbath. He
has prepared these various excuses why you should not make your decision to
be obedient to the law of God. He is a deceiver. He falsifies the character
of God, and you have accepted his temptation. All your imaginings have shown
distrust of your heavenly Father. {Ev 242.1}

You have thought when you could realize a certain prosperity in your
business, then you would obey the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. But the
Lord requires of every one of His subjects entire obedience. God's
requirements were upon you, and you have been making terms with God. And all
the time Satan has been working to make it more and still more impossible as
you look at the matter, to decide to keep the Sabbath. You have been growing
less and less susceptible to the movings of the Spirit of God upon your
heart. The Lord has given me a message for you and for your children to take
up your long-neglected duty, to walk in the light as He is in the light.
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind." "This do," said Christ of
a lawyer, "and thou shalt live." This is the voice of God

243
to yourself and to your children. The law of God is good as well as just and
profitable to all who obey, and you will show honor to Him whom you obey.
{Ev 242.2}

When your mind is brought into conformity to the will of God, to obey
His commandments, think you that the Lord will not have a care for you and
your temporal interests? You have been almost persuaded, but did not obey.
You thought you would wait until the way cleared before you. The Lord has
left every human agent responsible for his course of action. God's claims
are to be your first consideration. Obedience to God is your first duty. You
are to leave all the consequences in His hands. You have been hesitating
because you do not now realize the strong convictions that you once had, and
would not yield to obey. You need not expect as forcible conviction again.
You will have to obey God and take your position on the truth, feeling or no
feeling. Your business now is to work decidedly from principle, to make your
decisions irrespective of consequences.-- Letter 72, 1893. {Ev 243.1}

Live Up to Every Ray of Light.--Live up to every ray of light that you
have received. Your eternal interests are involved here, and that is why I
say, "Cherish every ray of light." On your knees ask Christ to impress your
heart by His Holy Spirit, and turn not away from His law.--Manuscript 10,
1894. {Ev 243.2}

Better Lose Position Than Jesus.--Do not think that if you take your
position for the Bible truth you will lose your position. You had better
lose your  position than lose Jesus. You had better be partakers of the
self-denial and self-sacrifice of the Lord than to go in your own way
seeking to gather to yourself the treasures of this life. You cannot carry
any of it into the grave. You will come up from the grave

244
without anything, but if you have Jesus you will have everything. He is all
that you will require to stand the test of the day of God, and is not this
enough for you?--Manuscript 20, 1894. {Ev 243.3}

A Decided Stand.--Men may raise up all the combativeness they please,
but the commandments of God are the commandments of God still. We have
decided to keep God's commandments and live, and [preserve] His law as the
apple of our eye. Let men rail out against the law of God and trample His
commandment-keeping people under their feet. Can they do it and live? It is
impossible. God has His measurement of character, and it is those who obey
Him that live, and those who keep His law as the apple of their eye that He
preserves.--Manuscript 5, 1891. {Ev 244.1}

Offering Positions to New Sabbathkeepers.--Among those who embraced the
truth at _____ last winter was a young man who left the school that he was
attending, in order to keep the Sabbath. He was asked what he expected to do
for a living. He replied, "God has given me physical strength, and I will
work in any capacity rather than break His commandments." Some felt anxious
that he should be given a place in the printing office, but one said, "No.
When he shows that he will obey God at any cost, then we shall know that he
is the very man we need in this office. But if he has not principle enough
to do this, he is just the man that we do not want." {Ev 244.2}

Elder _____ came to me, and asked me if he ought to give the young man
encouragement to think that he would be given a place in the office. I said,
"The God of heaven has presented before him the eternal weight of glory that
awaits the overcomer, and if like Moses, he has respect unto the recompense
of reward, he will take his position decidedly on the side of truth.

245
But it would do harm and not good to hold out before him any bribe or
attraction. And yet your duty is to help him to see that he must walk out by
faith, but do not leave him to wrestle this battle out alone, for Satan will
tempt him, and you must render him every help possible."--Manuscript 26,
1886. {Ev 244.3}

Business Ties With Sabbathbreakers.--There is need of a Sabbath reform
among us, who profess to observe God's holy rest day. Some discuss their
business matters and lay plans on the Sabbath, and God looks upon this in
the same light as though they engaged in the actual transaction of business.
{Ev 245.1}

Others who are well acquainted with the Bible evidences that the
seventh day is the Sabbath, enter into partnership with men who have no
respect for God's holy day. A Sabbathkeeper cannot allow men in his employ,
paid by his money, to work on the Sabbath. If, for the sake of gain, he
allows the business in which he has an interest to be carried on on the
Sabbath by his unbelieving partner, he is equally guilty with the
unbeliever; and it is his duty to dissolve the relation, however much he may
lose by so doing. Men may think they cannot afford to obey God, but they
cannot afford to disobey Him. Those who are careless in their observance of
the Sabbath will suffer great loss.-- Review and Herald, March 18, 1884. {Ev
245.2}

One Kind of Employment for Sabbathkeepers.--We find here the best class
of people to work for. And for many of them it would not be difficult to
keep the Sabbath. _____is a place where a great deal of poultry raising is
done. With almost every dwelling house on the outskirts of the city poultry
yards are connected. The houses are not built in terraces, but stand apart
from one another, often surrounded by several acres of land. Poultry of all
kinds is raised,

246
and the eggs find a ready market in _____ and _____, and are taken to the
city by boat. {Ev 245.3}

I write this that you may understand the situation. In poultry raising
many families find a means of livelihood, and these could not raise the
objection that many raise to keeping the Sabbath--that it would interfere
with their business. They could keep the Sabbath without fear of losing
their employment.--Letter 113, 1902. {Ev 246.1}

Preaching on Nonimmortality

Delay Presentation of Objectionable Features.-- Great wisdom should be
used in the presentation of a truth that comes directly in opposition to the
opinions and practices of the people. Paul's habit was to dwell upon the
prophecies when with the Jewish people, and bring them down step by step,
and then after some time open the subject of Christ as the true Messiah. {Ev
246.2}

I have been shown that our ministers go too rapidly through their
subjects and bring the most objectionable features of our faith too early
into their effort. There are truths that will not involve so great a cross,
that should be kept before their minds, day after day and even weeks before
the Sabbath and immortality questions are entered upon. Then you gain the
confidence of the people as being men who have clear, forcible arguments,
and they think you understand the Scriptures. When once the confidence of
the people is gained, then it is time enough to introduce publicly the
Sabbath and immortality questions. {Ev 246.3}

But men who are not wise advance these questions too soon, and thus
close the ears of the people, when with greater care and more faith and
aptness and wisdom they could have carried them along step by step

247
through the important events in the prophecies and in dwelling upon
practical subjects in the teachings of Christ.--Letter 48, 1886. {Ev 246.4}

One of the Great Delusions.--Every species of delusion is now being
brought in. The plainest truths of God's Word are covered with a mass of
man-made theories. Deadly errors are presented as the truth to which all
must bow. The simplicity of true godliness is buried beneath tradition. {Ev
247.1}

The doctrine of the natural immortality of the soul is one error with
which the enemy is deceiving man. This error is well-nigh universal. . . .
{Ev 247.2}

This is one of the lies forged in the synagogue of the enemy, one of
the poisonous drafts of Babylon. "All nations have drunk of the wine of the
wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed
fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through
the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven,
saying, Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins,
and that ye receive not of her plagues."--Review and Herald, March 16, 1897.
{Ev 247.3}

Emphasize Life Through Jesus.--The question of the nonimmortality of
the soul also needs to be treated with great care, lest in introducing the
subject there be started a deep and exciting controversy which will close
the door to further investigation of the truth. {Ev 247.4}

Great wisdom is required in dealing with human minds, even in giving a
reason of the hope that is within us. What is the hope of which we are to
give a reason? The hope of eternal life through Jesus Christ. . . . You
dwell too much upon special ideas and doctrines, and the heart of the
unbeliever is not softened. To try to impress him is like striking upon cold
iron. . . .

248
{Ev 247.5}

We are in constant need of wisdom to know when to speak and when to
keep silent. But there is always perfect safety in talking of the hope of
eternal life. And when the heart is all melted and subdued by the love of
Jesus, the inquiry will be, "Lord, what must I do to be saved?"--Letter 12,
1890. {Ev 248.1}

Wisdom Required in Presenting Testing Truths.-- Our growth has been, in
untried fields, generally slow because of the seventh-day Sabbath. There
stands a sharp cross directly in the way of every soul who accepts the
truth. {Ev 248.2}

There are other truths, such as the nonimmortality of the soul and the
personal coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven to our earth in a short
time. But these are not as objectionable as the Sabbath. Some will
conscientiously accept the truth for its own sake, because it is Bible
truth, and they love the path of obedience to all the commandments of God.
These objectionable features of our faith will bar the way to many souls who
do not wish to be a peculiar people, distinct and separate from the world.
Therefore, great wisdom is required to be exercised in the matter of how the
truth is brought before the people. There are certain clearly defined ends
to gain at the very introduction of missionary effort. If the plans and
methods had been of a different character, even if they necessarily involved
more outlay of means, there would have been far better results.--Letter 14,
1887. {Ev 248.3}

Lay Off Combative Armor.--Some ministers, when they find before them
unbelievers who are prejudiced against our views upon the nonimmortality of
the soul out of Christ, feel all stirred up to give a discourse on that very
subject. This the hearers are in no way prepared to receive, and it only
increases their prejudice and stirs up their opposition. Thus all the good

249
impressions that might have been made if the worker had pursued a wise
course are lost. The hearers are confirmed in their unbelief. Hearts might
have been won, but the combative armor was put on. Strong meat was thrust
upon them and the souls that might have been won were driven farther off
than before. {Ev 248.4}

The combative armor, the debating spirit, must be laid off. If we would
be Christlike we must reach men where they are.--Manuscript 104, 1898. {Ev
249.1}

Correct Understanding Vital.--A correct understanding of "what saith
the Scriptures" in regard to the state of the dead is essential for this
time. God's Word declares that the dead know not anything, their hatred and
love have alike perished. We must come to the sure word of prophecy for our
authority. Unless we are intelligent in the Scriptures, may we not, when
this mighty miracle-working power of Satan is manifested in our world, be
deceived and call it the workings of God; for the Word of God declares that,
if it were possible, the very elect should be deceived. Unless we are rooted
and grounded in the truth, we shall be swept away by Satan's delusive
snares. We must cling to our Bibles. If Satan can make you believe that
there are things in the Word of God that are not inspired, he will then be
prepared to ensnare your soul. We shall have no assurance, no certainty, at
the very time we need to know what is truth.-- Review and Herald, Dec. 18,
1888. {Ev 249.2}

The Message of Christian
Stewardship

Teach Every Convert.--Every soul converted is to have the light in
regard to the Lord's requirement for tithes and offerings. All that men
enjoy they receive from the Lord's great farm, and He is pleased

250
to have His heritage enjoy His goods; but He has made a special contract
with all who stand under the bloodstained banner of Prince Immanuel, that
they may show their dependence and accountability to God, by returning to
His treasury a certain portion as His own. This is to be invested in
supporting the missionary work which must be done to fulfill the commission
given to them by the Son of God just before He left His
disciples.--Manuscript 123, 1898. {Ev 249.3}

Each a Link in Chain of Salvation.--He who becomes a child of God
should henceforth look upon himself as a link in the chain let down to save
the world, one with Christ in His plan of mercy, going forth with Him to
seek and save the lost.--Ministry of Healing, p. 105. (1905) {Ev 250.1}

Evangelists' Responsibility.--It is part of your work to teach those
whom you bring into the truth to bring the tithe into the storehouse as an
acknowledgment of their dependence on God. They should be fully enlightened
as to their duty to return to the Lord His own. The command to pay tithe is
so plain that there is no semblance of excuse for disregarding it. If you
neglect to give the new converts instruction on this point, you leave undone
a most important part of your work.--Letter 51, 1902. {Ev 250.2}

Guiding the New Church.--Never should the laborer who raises up little
companies here and there, give the impression to those newly come to the
faith, that God does not require them to work systematically in helping to
sustain the cause by their personal labors and by their means. . . . {Ev
250.3}

All should be taught to do what they can for the Master; to render to
Him according as He has prospered them. He claims as His just due a tenth of
their

251
income, be it large or small; and those who withhold this, commit robbery
toward Him and cannot expect His prospering hand to be with them. Even if
the church is composed mostly of poor brethren, the subject of systematic
benevolence should be thoroughly explained, and the plan heartily adopted.
God is able to fulfill His promises. His resources are infinite, and He
employs them all in accomplishing His will. And when He sees a faithful
performance of duty in the payment of the tithes, He often, in His wise
providence, opens ways whereby it shall increase. He who follows God's
arrangement in the little that has been given him, will receive the same
returns as he who bestows of his abundance.--Gospel Workers, pp. 222, 223.
(1915) {Ev 250.4}

Test of Heavenly Fellowship.--Our heavenly Father bestows gifts and
solicits a portion back, that He may test us whether we are worthy to have
the gift of everlasting life.--Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 408. (1875) {Ev
251.1}

A Point to Be Presented Tactfully and Repeatedly. --Teachers of the
Word of God are not to keep back any part of the counsel of God, lest the
people shall be ignorant of their duty, and not understand what is the will
of God concerning them, and stumble and fall into perdition. . . . {Ev
251.2}

Let no one neglect to give faithful and plain instruction upon tithing.
Let there be instruction as to giving to the Lord that which He claims as
His own; for the commendation of the Lord will not rest upon a people who
rob Him in tithes and offerings. There will be need of often setting before
the people their duty on this matter that they may render unto God His own.
Let the one who first presents the truth be faithful in presenting this
matter and let him also who follows up the interest also make plain the
requirement

252
of God on tithing, that the people may see that in all points the laborers
are teaching the same truth and are of one mind in urging them to yield
obedience to all the requirements of God. {Ev 251.3}

But let laborers have discretion and not give strong meat to those who
are babes; feed them with the sincere milk of the Word. In no case mingle
your own spirit and ideas with the truth and cover up the precepts of God by
traditions or suppositions. Let the people have the truth as it is in
Jesus.--Manuscript 39, 1895. {Ev 252.1}

A Neglected Work.--We are to give the message of warning to the world,
and how are we doing our work? Are you, brethren, preaching that part of the
truth that pleases the people, while other parts of the work are left
incomplete? Will it be necessary for someone to follow after you, and urge
upon the people the duty of faithfully bringing all the tithes and offerings
into the Lord's treasury? This is the work of the minister, but it has been
sadly neglected. The people have robbed God, and the wrong has been suffered
because the minister did not want to displease his brethren. God calls these
men unfaithful stewards. --Review and Herald, July 8, 1884. {Ev 252.2}

Faithful Tithe, Adequate Means.--Should means flow into the treasury
exactly according to God's plan, --a tenth of all the increase,--there would
be abundance to carry forward His work.--Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 150. (1882)
{Ev 252.3}

Ingathering for Missions.--In the providence of God, those who are
bearing the burden of His work have been endeavoring to put new life into
old methods of labor, and also to invent new plans and new methods of
awakening the interest of church members in a united effort to reach the
world. One of the

253
new plans for reaching unbelievers is the Harvest Ingathering campaign for
missions. In many places, during the past few years, this has proved a
success, bringing blessing to many, and increasing the flow of means into
the mission treasury. As those not of our faith have been made acquainted
with the progress of the third angel's message in heathen lands, their
sympathies have been aroused, and some have sought to learn more of the
truth that has such power to transform hearts and lives. Men and women of
all classes have been reached, and the name of God has been
glorified.--Counsels on Stewardship, pp. 190, 191. {Ev 252.4}

Avoid Worldly Methods.--We see the churches of our day encouraging
feasting, gluttony, and dissipation, by the suppers, fairs, dances, and
festivals gotten up for the purpose of gathering means into the church
treasury. Here is a method invented by carnal minds to secure means without
sacrificing. . . . {Ev 253.1}

Let us stand clear of all these church corruptions, dissipations, and
festivals, which have a demoralizing influence upon young and old. We have
no right to throw over them the cloak of sanctity because the means is to be
used for church purposes. Such offerings are lame and diseased, and bear the
curse of God. They are the price of souls. The pulpit may defend festivals,
dancing, lotteries, fairs, and luxurious feasts, to obtain means for church
purposes; but let us participate in none of these things; for if we do,
God's displeasure will be upon us. We do not propose to appeal to the lust
of the appetite or resort to carnal amusements as an inducement to Christ's
professed followers to give of the means which God has entrusted to them. If
they do not give willingly, for the love of Christ, the offering will in no
case be acceptable to God.--Counsels on Stewardship, pp. 201, 202. (1878)

254
{Ev 253.2}

Bribed by Feasting and Merriment.--It is a deplorable fact that sacred
and eternal considerations do not have that power to open the hearts of the
professed followers of Christ to make freewill offerings to sustain the
gospel, as the tempting bribes of feasting and general merriment. It is a
sad reality that these inducements will prevail when sacred and eternal
things will have no force to influence the heart to engage in works of
benevolence. {Ev 254.1}

The plan of Moses in the wilderness to raise means was highly
successful. There was no compulsion necessary. Moses made no grand feast. He
did not invite the people to scenes of gaiety, dancing, and general
amusement. Neither did he institute lotteries or anything of this profane
order to obtain means to erect the tabernacle of God in the wilderness. God
commanded Moses to invite the children of Israel to bring the offerings.
Moses was to accept gifts of every man that gave willingly from his heart.
These freewill offerings came in so great abundance that Moses proclaimed it
was enough. They must cease their presents; for they had given abundantly,
more than they could use.--Counsels on Stewardship, p. 203. (1874) {Ev
254.2}

And what impression is made upon the minds of unbelievers? The holy
standard of the Word of God is lowered into the dust. Contempt is cast upon
God and upon the Christian name. The most corrupt principles are
strengthened by this un-Scriptural way of raising means. And this is as
Satan would have it. Men are repeating the sin of Nadab and Abihu. They are
using common instead of sacred fire in the service of God. The Lord accepts
no such offerings. {Ev 254.3}

All these methods for bringing money into His treasury are an
abomination to Him. It is a spurious devotion that prompts all such
devising. O what blindness, what infatuation, is upon many who claim to be

255
Christians! Church members are doing as did the inhabitants of the world in
the days of Noah, when the imagination of their hearts was only evil
continually. All who fear God will abhor such practices as a
misrepresentation of the religion of Jesus Christ.-- Counsels on
Stewardship, p. 205. (1896) {Ev 254.4}

Man's Stewardship.--There is a yet deeper significance to the golden
rule. Everyone who has been made a steward of the manifold grace of God, is
called upon to impart to souls in ignorance and darkness, even as, were he
in their place, he would desire them to impart to him. The apostle Paul
said, "I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians; both to the
wise and to the unwise." By all that you have known of the love of God, by
all that you have received of the rich gifts of His grace, above the most
benighted and degraded soul upon the earth, are you in debt to that soul to
impart these gifts unto him.-- Mount of Blessing, p. 193. (1896) {Ev 255.1}

Presentation of the Spirit
of Prophecy

New Believers to Have Clear Understanding.--As the end draws near, and
the work of giving the last warning to the world extends, it becomes more
important for those who accept present truth to have a clear understanding
of the nature and influence of the Testimonies, which God in His providence
has linked with the work of the third angel's message from its very
rise.--Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 654. (1889) {Ev 255.2}

God's Present-Day Instruction.--In ancient times God spoke to men by
the mouth of prophets and apostles. In these days He speaks to them by the

256
testimonies of His Spirit. There was never a time when God instructed His
people more earnestly than He instructs them now concerning His will, and
the course that He would have them pursue.--Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 661.
(1889) {Ev 255.3}

Frequently Neglected.--Ministers frequently neglect these important
branches of the work--health reform, spiritual gifts, systematic
benevolence, and the great branches of the missionary work. Under their
labors large numbers may embrace the theory of the truth, but in time it is
found that there are many who will not bear the proving of God. The minister
laid upon the foundation, hay, wood, and stubble, which would be consumed by
the fire of temptation.-- Review and Herald, Dec. 12, 1878. {Ev 256.1}

Not to Take Place of the Bible.--The testimonies of Sister White should
not be carried to the front. God's Word is the unerring standard. The
Testimonies are not to take the place of the Word. Great care should be
exercised by all believers to advance these questions carefully, and always
stop when you have said enough. Let all prove their positions from the
Scriptures and substantiate every point they claim as truth from the
revealed Word of God.--Letter 12, 1890. {Ev 256.2}

Testimonies Not Ahead of Bible.--The more we look at the promises of
the Word of God, the brighter they grow. The more we practice them, the
deeper will be our understanding of them. Our position and faith is in the
Bible. And never do we want any soul to bring in the Testimonies ahead of
the Bible. --Manuscript 7, 1894. {Ev 256.3}

Purpose of the Testimonies.--The Word of God is sufficient to enlighten
the most beclouded mind, and

257
may be understood by those who have any desire to understand it. But
notwithstanding all this, some who profess to make the Word of God their
study, are found living in direct opposition to its plainest teachings.
Then, to leave men and women without excuse, God gives plain and pointed
testimonies, bringing them back to the Word that they have neglected to
follow. The Word of God abounds in general principles for the formation of
correct habits of living, and the Testimonies, general and personal, have
been calculated to call their attention more especially to these
principles.--Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 663, 664. (1889) {Ev 256.4}

The Greater and Lesser Lights.--Little heed is given to the Bible, and
the Lord has given a lesser light to lead men and women to the greater
light.-- Colporteur Evangelist, p. 37. (1902) {Ev 257.1}

Illustration: Presenting the Spirit of Prophecy.-- Elder _____ enters
into no controversy with opponents. He presents the Bible so clearly that it
is evident that anyone who differs must do so in opposition to the Word of
God. {Ev 257.2}

Friday evening and Sabbath forenoon he spoke upon the subject of
spiritual gifts, dwelling especially upon the Spirit of prophecy. Those who
were present at these discourses say that he treated the subject in a clear,
forceful manner.--Letter 388, 1906. {Ev 257.3}

In his teaching Elder _____ showed that the Spirit of prophecy has an
important part to act in the establishment of the truth. When binding off
his work, he called for me . . . to speak to the people.--Letter 400, 1906.
{Ev 257.4}

Give Time to Weigh Evidence.--In the last vision given at Battle Creek
I was shown that an unwise

258
course was taken at _____ in regard to the visions at the time of the
organization of the church there. There were some in _____ who were God's
children, and yet doubted the visions. Others had no opposition, yet dared
not take a decided stand in regard to them. Some were skeptical, and they
had sufficient cause to make them so. The false visions and fanatical
exercises, and the wretched fruits following, had an influence upon the
cause in _____, to make minds jealous of everything bearing the name of
visions. All these things should have been taken into consideration, and
wisdom exercised. There should be no trial or labor with those who have
never seen the individual having visions, and who have had no personal
knowledge of the influence of the visions. Such should not be deprived of
the benefits and privileges of the church, if their Christian course is
otherwise correct, and they have formed a good Christian character. {Ev
257.5}

Some, I was shown, could receive the published visions, judging of the
tree by its fruits. Others are like doubting Thomas; they cannot believe the
published Testimonies, nor receive evidence through the testimony of others,
but must see and have the evidence for themselves. Such must not be set
aside, but long patience and brotherly love should be exercised toward them
until they find their position and become established for or against. If
they fight against the visions, of which they have no knowledge; if they
carry their opposition so far as to oppose that in which they have had no
experience, and feel annoyed when those who believe that the visions are of
God speak of them in meeting, and comfort themselves with the instruction
given through vision, the church may know that they are not
right.--Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 327-329. (1862)

259
{Ev 258.1}

Driven to a Premature Position.--I have been shown that some,
especially in _____, make the visions a rule by which to measure all; and
have taken a course which my husband and myself have never pursued. Some are
unacquainted with me and my labors, and they are very skeptical of anything
bearing the name of visions. This is all natural, and can be overcome only
by experience. If persons are not settled in regard to the visions, they
should not be crowded off. The course to pursue with such may be found in
Testimony No. 8 [volume 1, pages 328, 329], which I hope will be read by
all. Ministers should have compassion of some, making a difference; others
save with fear, pulling them out of the fire. God's ministers should have
wisdom to give to everyone his portion of meat, and to make that difference
with different persons which their cases require. The course pursued with
some in _____ who are unacquainted with me, has not been careful and
consistent. Those who were, comparatively, strangers to the visions, have
been dealt with in the same manner as those who have had much light and
experience in the visions. Some have been required to indorse the visions
when they could not conscientiously do so, and in this way some honest souls
have been driven to take positions against the visions and against the body,
which they never would have taken had their cases been managed with
discretion and mercy.--Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 382, 383. (1863) {Ev 259.1}

Overcoming the Opposition.--The ministers (non-S.D.A.) are opening up
their tirade, and against Mrs. White in particular. But this is only hurting
themselves. . . . I am placing Desire of Ages, Great Controversy, Patriarchs
and Prophets, and Christ Our Saviour in families; so while the ministers are
working against

260
me, I will speak in my writings to the people. I believe souls will be
converted to the truth. We are now turning them to the law and to the
testimonies. If they speak not according to this word, it is because there
is no light in them.--Letter 217, 1899. {Ev 259.2}

Judged by Their Fruits.--Let the Testimonies be judged by their fruits.
What is the spirit of their teaching? What has been the result of their
influence? All who desire to do so can acquaint themselves with the fruits
of these visions. . . . {Ev 260.1}

God is either teaching His church, reproving their wrongs, and
strengthening their faith, or He is not. This work is of God, or it is not.
God does nothing in partnership with Satan. My work . . . bears the stamp of
God, or the stamp of the enemy. There is no halfway work in the matter. The
Testimonies are of the Spirit of God, or of the devil.--Testimonies, vol. 5,
p. 671. (1889) {Ev 260.2}

God Speaks Through Testimonies.--We must follow the directions given
through the Spirit of prophecy. We must love and obey the truth for this
time. This will save us from accepting strong delusions. God has spoken to
us through His Word. He has spoken to us through the Testimonies to the
church, and through the books that have helped to make plain our present
duty and the position that we should now occupy.--Testimonies, vol. 8, p.
298. (1904) {Ev 260.3}

Presenting Health and Christian
Standards [SEE ALSO PP. 513-551,
"A MEDICAL EVANGELISM," AND PP. 657-665,
"HEALTH AND HEALTH PRINCIPLES."]

Presenting Health Reform.--Our work is to be practical. We are to
remember that man has a body as

261
well as a soul to save. Our work includes far more than standing before the
people to preach to them. In our work we are to minister to the physical
infirmities of those with whom we are brought in contact. We are to present
the principles of health reform, impressing our hearers with the thought
that they have a part to act in keeping themselves in health. {Ev 260.4}

The body must be kept in a healthy condition in order that the soul may
be in health. The condition of the body affects the condition of the soul.
He who would have physical and spiritual strength must educate his appetite
in right lines. He must be careful not to burden the soul by overtaxing his
physical or spiritual powers. Faithful adherence to right principles in
eating, drinking, and dressing is a duty that God has laid upon human
beings. {Ev 261.1}

The Lord desires us to obey the laws of health and life. He holds each
one responsible to care properly for his body, that it may be kept in
health.--Letter 123, 1903. {Ev 261.2}

A Part of the Last Message.--The principles of health reform are found
in the Word of God. The gospel of health is to be firmly linked with the
ministry of the Word. It is the Lord's design that the restoring influence
of health reform shall be a part of the last great effort to proclaim the
gospel message. --Medical Ministry, p. 259. {Ev 261.3}

As a people we have been given the work of making known the principles
of health reform. There are some who think that the question of diet is not
of sufficient importance to be included in their evangelistic work. But such
make a great mistake. God's Word declares, "Whether therefore ye eat, or
drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God." 1 Cor. 10:31. The
subject of temperance, in all its bearings,

262
has an important place in the work of salvation.-- Testimonies, vol. 9, p.
112. (1909) {Ev 261.4}

Fully Established in Health Reform.--Those who live in the last days of
this earth's history need to be fully established in the principles of
health reform. . . . {Ev 262.1}

Sickly men and sickly women need to become health reformers. God will
co-operate with His children in preserving their health, if they eat with
care, refusing to put unnecessary burdens on the stomach. He has graciously
made the path of nature sure and safe, wide enough for all who will walk in
it. He has given for our sustenance the wholesome and health-giving
productions of the earth. . . . {Ev 262.2}

Many have done the body much injury by a disregard of the laws of life,
and they may never recover from the effects of their neglect; but even now
they may repent and be converted. Man has tried to be wiser than God. He has
become a law unto himself. God calls upon us to give attention to His
requirements, no longer to dishonor Him by dwarfing the physical, mental,
and spiritual capabilities.--Letter 135, 1902. {Ev 262.3}

Health Reform Progressive and Practical.--The Lord desires our
ministers, physicians, and church members to be careful not to urge those
who are ignorant of our faith to make sudden changes in diet, thus bringing
men to a premature test. Hold up the principles of health reform, and let
the Lord lead the honest in heart. They will hear and believe. Nor does the
Lord require His messengers to present the beautiful truths of healthful
living in a way that will prejudice minds. Let no one put stumbling blocks
before the feet that are walking in the dark paths of ignorance. Even in
praising a good thing, it is well

263
not to be too enthusiastic, lest you turn out of the way those who come to
hear. Present the principles of temperance in their most attractive form.
{Ev 262.4}

We must not move presumptuously. The laborers who enter new territory
to raise up churches must not create difficulties by attempting to make
prominent the question of diet. They should be careful not to draw the lines
too closely, for impediments would thus be thrown in the pathway of others.
Do not drive the people; lead them. {Ev 263.1}

Wherever the truth is carried, instruction should be given in regard to
the preparation of wholesome foods. God desires that in every place the
people shall be taught by skillful teachers how to utilize wisely the
products that they can raise or readily obtain in their section of the
country. Thus the poor, as well as those in better circumstances, can be
taught to live healthfully.--Gospel Workers, p. 233. (1915) {Ev 263.2}

Keep It to the Front.--The work of health reform is the Lord's means
for lessening suffering in our world and for purifying His church. Teach the
people that they can act as God's helping hand, by co-operating with the
Master worker in restoring physical and spiritual health. This work bears
the signature of heaven, and will open doors for the entrance of other
precious truths. There is room for all to labor who will take hold of this
work intelligently. {Ev 263.3}

Keep the work of health reform to the front, is the message I am
instructed to bear. Show so plainly its value that a wide-spread need for it
will be felt. Abstinence from all hurtful food and drink is the fruit of
true religion. He who is thoroughly converted will abandon every injurious
habit and appetite. By total abstinence he will overcome his desire for
health-destroying indulgences.

264
{Ev 263.4}

I am instructed to say to health-reform educators, Go forward. The
world needs every jot of the influence you can exert to press back the tide
of moral woe. Let those who teach the third angel's message stand true to
their colors.--Testimonies, vol. 9, pp. 112, 113. (1909) {Ev 264.1}

Total Abstinence From Liquor and Tobacco.--Men and women have many
habits that are antagonistic to the principles of the Bible. The victims of
strong drink and tobacco are corrupted, body, soul, and spirit. Such ones
should not be received into the church until they give evidence that they
are truly converted, that they feel the need of the faith that works by love
and purifies the soul. The truth of God will purify the true believer. He
who is thoroughly converted will abandon every defiling habit and appetite.
By total abstinence he will overcome his desire for health-destroying
indulgences.--Letter 49, 1902. {Ev 264.2}

Conversion the Secret of Victory.--The very first and the most
important thing is to melt and subdue the soul by presenting our Lord Jesus
Christ as the sinbearer, the sin-pardoning Saviour, making the gospel as
clear as possible. {Ev 264.3}

When the Holy Spirit works among us, as it surely has done at the camp
meeting in _____, souls who are unready for Christ's appearing are
convicted. Many come to our meetings and are converted who for years have
not attended meetings in any church. The simplicity of the truth reaches
their hearts. It touches all classes. The tobacco devotees sacrifice their
idol and the liquor drinker his liquor. They could not do this if they did
not grasp by faith the promises of God for the forgiveness of their sins. Is

265
it not worth a decided effort to save these souls?--Letter 4, 1899. {Ev
264.4}

Begin Reform at the Foundation.--Liquor drinking encourages the vilest
debauchery and strengthens the most Satanic propensities. . . . As we face
these things, and see the terrible consequences of liquor drinking, shall we
not do all in our power to rally to the help of God in fighting against this
great evil? At the foundation of liquor drinking lie wrong habits of eating.
Those who believe present truth should refuse to drink tea or coffee, for
these excite a desire for stronger stimulant. They should refuse to eat
flesh meat, for this too excites a desire for strong drink. Wholesome food,
prepared with taste and skill, should be our diet now. {Ev 265.1}

Those who are not health reformers treat themselves unfairly and
unwisely. By the indulgence of appetite they do themselves fearful injury.
Some may think that the question of diet is not important enough to be
included in the question of religion. But such make a great mistake. God's
Word declares, "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
all to the glory of God." The subject of temperance, in all its bearings,
has an important place in the working out of our salvation. Because of wrong
habits of eating, the world is becoming more and more immoral. --Letter 49,
1902. {Ev 265.2}

Personal Labor for Intemperate.--Missionary work does not consist
merely of preaching. It includes personal labor for those who have abused
their health and have placed themselves where they have not moral power to
control their appetites and passions. These souls are to be labored for as
those more favorably situated. Our world is full of suffering ones. {Ev
265.3}

God has written His law upon every nerve and

266
muscle, every fiber and function of the human body. The indulgence of
unnatural appetite, whether for tea, coffee, tobacco, or liquor, is
intemperance, and is at war with the laws of life and health. By using these
forbidden articles a condition of things is created in the system which the
Creator never designed. This indulgence in any of the members of the human
family is sin. . . . The eating of food that does not make good blood is
working against the laws of our physical organism, and is a violation of the
law of God. The cause produces the effect. Suffering, disease, and death are
the sure penalty of indulgence.-- Letter 123, 1899. {Ev 265.4}

The Quest for Pleasure.--Multitudes are vainly seeking happiness in
worldly amusements. They crave something which they do not have. They are
spending their money for that which is not bread, and their labor for that
which satisfieth not. The hungering, thirsting soul will continue to hunger
and thirst as long as it partakes of these unsatisfying pleasures. O that
every such one would listen to the voice of Jesus, "If any man thirst, let
him come unto Me, and drink." Those who drink of the living water will
thirst no more for frivolous, exciting amusements. Christ, the wellspring of
life, is the fountain of peace and happiness. {Ev 266.1}

God bestows various talents and gifts upon men, not that they may lie
useless, nor that they may be employed in amusements or selfish
gratification, but that they may be a blessing to others by enabling men to
do earnest, self-sacrificing missionary work.--The Youth's Instructor, Nov.
6, 1902. {Ev 266.2}

Shows and Theaters.--Satan's ruling passion is to pervert the intellect
and cause men to long for shows and theatrical performances. The experience
and

267
character of all who engage in this work will be in accordance with the food
given to the mind. {Ev 266.3}

The Lord has given evidence of His love for the world. There was no
falsity, no acting, in what He did. He gave a living gift, capable of
suffering humiliation, neglect, shame, reproach. This Christ did that He
might rescue the fallen. While human beings were instituting schemes and
methods to destroy Him, the Son of the Infinite God came to our world to
give an example of the great work to be done to redeem and save man. But
today the proud and disobedient are striving to acquire a great name and
great honor from their fellow men by using their God-given endowments to
amuse.--Manuscript 42, 1898. {Ev 267.1}

Working for Pleasure Lovers.--Instead of disparaging Jacob's well,
Christ presented something infinitely better. . . . He offered the woman
something better than anything she possessed, even living water, the joy and
hope of the gospel of His kingdom. {Ev 267.2}

This is an illustration of the way in which we are to work. It is of
little use for us to go to pleasure lovers, theatergoers, horse racers,
drunkards, gamblers, and scathingly rebuke them for their sins. This will do
no good. We must offer them something better than that which they have, even
the peace of Christ, which passeth all understanding. . . . {Ev 267.3}

These poor souls are engaged in a wild chase after worldly pleasure and
earthly riches. They have no knowledge of anything more desirable. But
games, theaters, horse races, will not satisfy the soul. Human beings were
not created to be satisfied in this way, to spend their money for that which
is not bread. Show them how infinitely superior to the fleeting joys and
pleasures of the world is the imperishable glory of heaven. Seek to convince
them of the freedom and

268
hope and rest and peace there is in the gospel. "Whosoever drinketh of the
water that I shall give him shall never thirst," Christ
declared.--Manuscript 12, 1901. {Ev 267.4}

Instructions on Dress and Pleasure.--The principles of the Christian
life should be made plain to those who have newly come to the truth.
Faithful, Christian men and women should have an intense interest to bring
the convicted soul to a correct knowledge of righteousness in Christ Jesus.
If any have allowed the desire for pleasure or the love of dress to become
supreme, so that any portion of their mind, soul, and strength is devoted to
selfish indulgences, the faithful believers should watch for these souls as
they that must give an account. They must not neglect the faithful, tender,
loving instruction so essential to the young converts, that there may be no
half-hearted work.--Manuscript 56, 1900. {Ev 268.1}

Instructing New Converts on Idolatry of Dress.-- One of the points upon
which those newly come to the faith will need instruction is the subject of
dress. Let the new converts be faithfully dealt with. Are they vain in
dress? Do they cherish pride of heart? The idolatry of dress is a moral
disease. It must not be taken over into the new life. In most cases,
submission to the gospel requirements will demand a decided change in the
dress. {Ev 268.2}

There should be no carelessness in dress. For Christ's sake, whose
witnesses we are, we should seek to make the best of our appearance. In the
tabernacle service, God specified every detail concerning the garments of
those who ministered before Him. Thus we are taught that He has a preference
in regard to the dress of those who serve Him. Very specific were the
directions given in regard to Aaron's robes, for his

269
dress was symbolic. So the dress of Christ's followers should be symbolic.
In all things we are to be  representatives of Him. Our appearance in every
respect should be characterized by neatness, modesty, and purity. But the
Word of God gives no sanction to the making of changes in apparel merely for
the sake of fashion,--that we may appear like the world. Christians are not
to decorate the person with costly array or expensive ornaments. {Ev 268.3}

The words of Scripture in regard to dress should be carefully
considered. We need to understand that which the Lord of heaven appreciates
in even the dressing of the body. All who are in earnest in seeking for the
grace of Christ will heed the precious words of instruction inspired by God.
Even the style of the apparel will express the truth of the gospel. {Ev
269.1}

All who study the life of Christ and practice His teachings will become
