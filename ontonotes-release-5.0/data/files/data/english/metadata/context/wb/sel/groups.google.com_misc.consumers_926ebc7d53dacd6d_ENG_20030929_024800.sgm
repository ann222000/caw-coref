I don't HAVE to have integrity you worthless freaks.
I have John Fereira, Allisson, Charlotte Blackmer and Phoobilee as
friends no matter what I do.

I can make fun of people's kids
gloat about your daughters dying violent deaths
defend pedophiles to the death
threaten people and never follow through
post 24 hours a day and claim to be an attorney

I'm beyond criticism because I'd kick Charlotte and Fereira's ass to
the moon and back at the next Jeemboink if they dared criticize me.

I'm da man!

"/> This forgery was brought to you by Stephen A. Chaney, a
noted net kook from the early 90's whose behavior has yet to
change in such a way that would render the usual label
applied to him -- &quot;ragingly insane&quot; -- inaccurate.

Mr. Chaney is mentioned twice in part 4 of the net legends
faq:

http://www.killfile.org/~tskirvin/faqs/legends/legends4.html

Mr. Chaney also has his own faq, a copy of which can be
found at:

http://www.pat-acceptance.org/steve_FAQ.html

Recently, Mr. Chaney bragged about hiring a private
investigator to track down an ex girlfriend (from nine years
earlier) whom he claimed defamed him nine years ago. His
rationale for tracking her down was to be able to sue her in
case she ever defamed him again. Of course, this girlfriend
hadn't uttered a peep in Mr. Chaney's direction in the
preceding nine years. Mr. Chaney's explanation of these
events:

http://www.pat-acceptance.org/kookrant.html

http://www.pat-acceptance.org/kookrant2.html

Mr. Chaney's net-kook credentials were recently acknowledged
in alt.usenet.kooks, wherein Mr. Chaney was voted kook of
the month for July 2003.

Message ID: &lt;bgrguq$p9 ... @blackhelicopter.databasix.com&gt;

Some of Mr. Chaney's other notable achievements include
initiating child molestation remarks in the newsgroup
soc.singles, running a self-acceptance/fat-acceptance
website ( http://www.self-acceptance.to ) while insulting the
size and weight of posters with whom he has disagreed,
posting over 10,000 forgeries of other posters to usenet,
and having a movie of his life story made and published on
the internet.

That movie can be viewed here:

http://www.pat-acceptance.org/pat.html

If you have any questions about this ragingly insane
netkook, post them to soc.singles, and someone will
certainly be glad to answer them for you.

While your obviously bitter rebuttal seems more a purging of bile
toward GW that offered no proof whatsoever that he's abused usenet or
behaved irrationally as Mr. Chaney clearly has. In fact, your last
paragraph verges on irrational anger as well.

Not difficult to see who's version is more probable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mike, you really should go hide in a gopher hole. You just

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the weak are always tormented.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yet his post was a non polarized account that offered definitive proof
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that a good number of respectable people on usenet do believe Mr.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chaney is a kook and have for over 10 years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;While your obviously bitter rebuttal seems more a purging of bile

&gt;Chaney acts like a dribbling kook and has a 10 year history of it

&gt;To my knowledge, GW has not been accused of kookery by anyone but

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For the uninitiated, let me explain this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cretin Mike Cranston, Failed Pretend Attorney, harbors an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;irrational hatred for one Steve Chaney because of many past
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;painful encounters. Unfortunately, Mike, an impuissant mental
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;twerp, also harbors a deathly fear of said Chaney. He hates
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;himself because he only hurts himself every time he tangles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;assholes with Chaney. His rage, frustration and general
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;chickenshittedness compel him to create a phantom Chaney and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;post forgeries of himself and claim Chaney did it so he can put
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;up this laughable false front of being willing and able to tak
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;him on. Mike is weaselry personified. He isn't afraid of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surrogate Chaney, because it's an imaginary Chaney. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hilarious thing is that it still kicks stupid Mike's ass.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [ embarrassing outpouring of rage snipped ]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mike, you really should go hide in a gopher hole. You just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aren't designed to deal with the cruel world around you, where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the weak are always tormented.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yet his post was a non polarized account that offered definitive proof
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that a good number of respectable people on usenet do believe Mr.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chaney is a kook and have for over 10 years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;While your obviously bitter rebuttal seems more a purging of bile
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;toward GW that offered no proof whatsoever that he's abused usenet or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;behaved irrationally as Mr. Chaney clearly has. In fact, your last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;paragraph verges on irrational anger as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not difficult to see who's version is more probable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jade

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know anything about him. Nothing has changed in my comparison
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of their posts. I see no evidece of net abuse from GW either. So I am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;only left with what I have observed:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chaney acts like a dribbling kook and has a 10 year history of it

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To my knowledge, GW has not been accused of kookery by anyone but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chaney and company.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;seems pretty obvious

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why? Not used to seeing logical conclusions drawn? Enlighten me if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;think you can.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I honestly don't think anyone could.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That's about what I expected out of you.

&gt;&gt;This forgery was brought to you by Stephen A. Chaney, a
&gt;&gt;noted net kook from the early 90's whose behavior has yet to
&gt;&gt;change in such a way that would render the usual label
&gt;&gt;applied to him -- &quot;ragingly insane&quot; -- inaccurate.

&gt;&gt;Mr. Chaney is mentioned twice in part 4 of the net legends
&gt;&gt;faq:

&gt;&gt;http://www.killfile.org/~tskirvin/faqs/legends/legends4.html

&gt;&gt;Mr. Chaney also has his own faq, a copy of which can be
&gt;&gt;found at:

&gt;&gt;http://www.pat-acceptance.org/steve_FAQ.html

&gt;&gt;Recently, Mr. Chaney bragged about hiring a private
&gt;&gt;investigator to track down an ex girlfriend (from nine years
&gt;&gt;earlier) whom he claimed defamed him nine years ago. His
&gt;&gt;rationale for tracking her down was to be able to sue her in
&gt;&gt;case she ever defamed him again. Of course, this girlfriend
&gt;&gt;hadn't uttered a peep in Mr. Chaney's direction in the
&gt;&gt;preceding nine years. Mr. Chaney's explanation of these
&gt;&gt;events:

&gt;&gt;http://www.pat-acceptance.org/kookrant.html

&gt;&gt;http://www.pat-acceptance.org/kookrant2.html

&gt;&gt;Mr. Chaney's net-kook credentials were recently acknowledged
&gt;&gt;in alt.usenet.kooks, wherein Mr. Chaney was voted kook of
&gt;&gt;the month for July 2003.

&gt;&gt;Message ID: &lt;bgrguq$p9 ... @blackhelicopter.databasix.com&gt;

&gt;&gt;Some of Mr. Chaney's other notable achievements include
&gt;&gt;initiating child molestation remarks in the newsgroup
&gt;&gt;soc.singles, running a self-acceptance/fat-acceptance
&gt;&gt;website ( http://www.self-acceptance.to ) while insulting the
&gt;&gt;size and weight of posters with whom he has disagreed,
&gt;&gt;posting over 10,000 forgeries of other posters to usenet,
&gt;&gt;and having a movie of his life story made and published on
&gt;&gt;the internet.

&gt;&gt;That movie can be viewed here:

&gt;&gt;http://www.pat-acceptance.org/pat.html

&gt;&gt;If you have any questions about this ragingly insane
&gt;&gt;netkook, post them to soc.singles, and someone will
&gt;&gt;certainly be glad to answer them for you.

&gt;into who posted this trash? Why did you waste hours (or days)
&gt;checking
&gt;into all of this? It only takes a few seconds to kill file anyone
&gt;and they are gone !!!! That's a whole lot easier and time is too
