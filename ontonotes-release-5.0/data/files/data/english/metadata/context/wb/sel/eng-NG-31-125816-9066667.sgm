I choose to print the label using PayPal and I opted for special delivery.
I took it to the post office, and they just took it off me and put it in a
bag. Obviously I have no tracking number so I pointed this out, they
seemed a bit miffed but done one for me and stuck it to the envelope and
gave me the receipt with the tracking number on.

Have I done this right as I can smell a chargeback with this one and want
to make sure I'm not doing something wrong. PayPal doesn't give me the
option to put a tracking number on now, why is this?

Just out of interest, the reason they were miffed was because they
still had to do all the work, while not getting any of the revenue. If
you're going to expect the PO to issue the stickers, do the recording,
take the package, why on earth not let them have the money?

You now have the tracking info for the package, can't see any problem
with that.

Sorry, no idea. They've recently revamped their site design, but no
idea if this has just been moved, is there but you're not recognising
it, or has gone for good, as I never use it.

At my local PO they love ebayers. I've even been known to sell them

And where do you get this little gem from Kim? The SPM *does* get paid
for handling *PREPAID* mail, despite what he might think. Would the
SPM be as miffed if you'd simply bought a stamp from the local paper
shop and then posted via his SPO? No, he probably wouldn't.

The reality is that most SPM's are whinging old buggers stuck in the
dark ages, like the type of people from the old Maxwell House (I think
it was) TV ad &quot;We don't like change, do we Deidre?&quot;.

Royal Mail are now operating in a competitive market. I personally
blame the Government for that, and I think it is BS that the UK market
was liberalised this much earlier than the other European Postal
markets, but c'est la vie. RM have got to come up with innovative
solutions, to help prevent customers flooding to the Dutchies (TNT)
and the like, OLP/smartStamp/Paypal Postage are just a number of these
such things. If the SPMs don't like this, then they need to ask
themselves whether they're better off with (for example) a customer
using SmartStamp, or a customer using the Dutchies. The answer is, he
is better off with the customer using SmartStamp, as he (the customer)
will still pop in, even if only &quot;now and then&quot; to post his SD items.
While he's there he may pickup a leaflet about Post Office Travel
Insurance. What about Post Office Homephone? Post Office Loans? Post
Office Credit Card?

Post Office Limited is now, finally, becoming more and more diverse,
and I'd stick my neck out as far as to say that there is more money to
be made by a SPM on services other than postage. I'm sure Geep can
give more info about this, if he's willing to...?

What you said above, Neil, (the bit I snipped) about POs being 'paid' to
take pre paid mail across the counter is NOT true.  It was true, until a
month ago, but the payment, which was worth a considerable four figure
sum per annum to me, has been withdrawn.  No consultation.  No
discussion.  Terminated.  From last month, I only receive payment for
mail for which a label is printed.  Doesn't matter if the label is for
nil value - I still get paid.  My instructions, received earlier today,
are to print a label for *every* item of mail that comes across the
counter.  I am free to bin the hundreds of nil value labels which will
be produced.  Every letter, every postcard, every parcel, every flat,
every package.  Everything gets a label, even though the majority will
not require one.  That way, I might just get paid.  Can you even begin
to imagine the queues that will build up, as we approach Christmas?

Sorry yes, forgot to mention that you'd need to enter it on Horizon as
pre-paid and therefore do a zero value label.

And yes, the queue's will be crazy, but come on Geep, be fair, how can the
old bugger at the OP's PO moan about not getting paid, when, actually he
will if he follows the correct procedure? He's talking shite and you know
it, even if he doesn't! :-)

To the OP, if you get ANY grief at all from the Postmaster, make a complaint
via the Post Office External Helpline (08457 223344), these complaints ARE
logged and believe me, these things ARE followed up to a [varying degree].

&lt;snip&gt;

That's interesting.

I sell little on ebay nowadays but recent sold a couple of books and
went with the Paypal version of stamped addressed labels as that's nice
and neat. I had intended just to pop them in the post box but realised
they were too big when I tried so instead I took them to a PO in my
lunch break.

What a dreadful experience that was!

I'd taken the trouble to print out the COPs as I now going to the PO and
asked for them to be stamped. The big-bad-wolf has nothing, I say
NOTHING!, on the woman behind the counter as she huffed and puffed and
loudly embarrassed me by complaining about the bleeding people who
pointlessly make her life more difficult by pre-printing their postage
labels when she has to still do all the work.

So instead of just handing my parcels over and getting my receipts
stamped she tarted about getting me to recall how much exactly I has
paid for the stamps (I had picked to option where this isn't printed) so
that she could print extra labels to stick on the parcels - and it took
ages! And all this in front of a busy lunchtime queue.

With a final glower, she handed me my COPs, and I scurried off thinking
&quot;never again&quot; and I haven't been back to that PO since.

And after all that you say the witch got paid? Bleeding heck. :-(

My point exactly!  OK, her attitude deserves a quick poke with a sharp
stick, but the point is that your local PO is now obliged to print an
utterly pointless label for *every* item of mail.  Ask anyone employed
by Royal Mail or Post Office and they will tell you that it is not a
problem, as a label only takes seconds to print, but we all know that is
not true, don't we?  Each one takes perhaps thirty seconds - add those
together for the average customer who wants to post several items and
the minutes tick away, whilst the queue gets longer.

&gt; That's interesting.

&gt; I sell little on ebay nowadays but recent sold a couple of books and
&gt; went with the Paypal version of stamped addressed labels as that's
&gt; nice and neat. I had intended just to pop them in the post box but
&gt; realised they were too big when I tried so instead I took them to a
&gt; PO in my lunch break.

&gt; What a dreadful experience that was!

&gt; I'd taken the trouble to print out the COPs as I now going to the PO
&gt; and asked for them to be stamped. The big-bad-wolf has nothing, I say
&gt; NOTHING!, on the woman behind the counter as she huffed and puffed and
&gt; loudly embarrassed me by complaining about the bleeding people who
&gt; pointlessly make her life more difficult by pre-printing their postage
&gt; labels when she has to still do all the work.

&gt; So instead of just handing my parcels over and getting my receipts
&gt; stamped she tarted about getting me to recall how much exactly I has
&gt; paid for the stamps (I had picked to option where this isn't printed)
&gt; so that she could print extra labels to stick on the parcels - and it
&gt; took ages! And all this in front of a busy lunchtime queue.

&gt; With a final glower, she handed me my COPs, and I scurried off
&gt; thinking &quot;never again&quot; and I haven't been back to that PO since.

&gt; And after all that you say the witch got paid? Bleeding heck. :-(

Oh FFS calm down. I was under the impression that handling pre-paid
mail in this way got the PO less revenue than doing the full service,
and that would be mighty annoying considering the same amount of work

They should be better back because they're employed to serve people.
They're moaning about OLP losing them money, but yet in the next
breath they're driving customers away by being rude and disrespectful
to them, go figure...!

There is an old saying; &quot;The Customer is always right&quot;. Well, within
the &quot;retail and service industry&quot; we know that this isn't true, so we
have our own saying; &quot;The customer is always right, even when he's
wrong, make him think he's right&quot;. Yes its contradictory (if that's
how you spell it!) But it sums things up quite nicely.

At the end of the day, the customer pays the SPM's wages, he has to
treat them well.

I can, and do, sympathise with the idea - we (SPMs) should be paid for
what we do, not an average figure which may or may not be accurate.
However, time is, as always, the factor.  Today, a quiet Wednesday in
the quiet period of one of the quietest months of the year, we had to
print dozens and dozens of completely unnecessary labels.  Imagine the
situation as we approach Christmas, quite apart from the environmental
concerns.  The situation would be much improved if we could settle to
stamps, rather than label, particularly where we have a file of items,
all the same price.

Perfect précis.

The fun has only just begun.  Not only do we now have to print all these
pointless (and expensive) labels, but we have to sort the mail, too.
Royal Mail are saving costs at their end by moving the work from sorting
offices out to post offices.  Nice work if you can get it.  Needless to
say, Royal Mail paid their staff to sort the mail.  Guess how much they
pay sub postmasters?  Did you say zero?  Go to the top of the class.

Sorting mail will, of course, drive even more customers away from post
offices straight into the open arms of the couriers.

Exactly right, which brings us full circle.  The only way in which the
SPM can generate payment for a pre paid article is, in the case of

Geep, RM can only do as much research as they can. Just because they might
not come and ask YOUR opinion on things, doesn't mean to say they don't ask
*any* SPMs.

The planning and developement stages of OLP were quite extensive. Ok,
mistakes may have been made, but we're only human (yes, WE, as I was
personally involved in the planning of OLP), but the important thing is that
these mistakes are realised and resolved (where possible.

You need to remember that SmartStamp and OLP are both very much in their
infancy and are still under development, you might not see it, but believe
me, things ARE happening!

You obviously value your job, as I do, otherwise you'd not be spending your
time talking about it on here and helping people out as you ocassionally do,
and that is great to see! You're not the only one who gets frustrated by RM.
I may appear to be of the opinion that RMG can do no wrong, but believe me,
this is FAR from the case! ;-)

Incidently Geep, do you have any dealings with the NFSP? Purely out of
interest, that's all! Also, have you heard anything about something called
STAR Panels?

&gt; &gt;&gt;So instead of just handing my parcels over and getting my receipts
&gt; &gt;&gt;stamped she tarted about getting me to recall how much exactly I has
&gt; &gt;&gt;paid for the stamps (I had picked to option where this isn't printed) so
&gt; &gt;&gt;that she could print extra labels to stick on the parcels - and it took
&gt; &gt;&gt;ages! And all this in front of a busy lunchtime queue.

&gt; &gt;My point exactly!  OK, her attitude deserves a quick poke with a sharp
&gt; &gt;stick, but the point is that your local PO is now obliged to print an
&gt; &gt;utterly pointless label for *every* item of mail.  Ask anyone employed
&gt; &gt;by Royal Mail or Post Office and they will tell you that it is not a
&gt; &gt;problem, as a label only takes seconds to print, but we all know that is
&gt; &gt;not true, don't we?  Each one takes perhaps thirty seconds - add those
&gt; &gt;together for the average customer who wants to post several items and
&gt; &gt;the minutes tick away, whilst the queue gets longer.

&gt; No, no, you're supposed to be terribly pleased to do all this
&gt; pointless work (and waste a heap of consumable resources the planet
&gt; can barely spare) at the same time, and if you suggest it's anything
&gt; other than a pure joy, Neil Monk will come round and personally piss
&gt; in your cornflakes. ;o))

&gt; I really don't understand why everybody's blaming the POs for the fact
&gt; that RM have brought in a half-arsed system that *doesn't* standalone
&gt; as a internet service, saves no effort, no time and no cost in a large
&gt; number of cases. For anything other than straight postage of minor
&gt; items (for which it does, I happily admit, work very well) it has no
&gt; advantages - so having done all the work online one has to go to the
&gt; post office and they have to do all the same work there. The fact that
&gt; the PO does, at the moment, get paid if they dick about enough is
&gt; hardly the point by this stage. The customer gets ratty because the PO
&gt; has to repeat all the stuff they've already done, the PO gets stick of
&gt; taking the brunt of the unhappy customer, and the queues don't improve
&gt; because no effort's been saved whatsoever.

&gt; If find with most people in the retail and service industry that you
&gt; reap what you sow. Anybody who has problems with grumpy counter staff
&gt; should look at their own attitude first. If you've been standing in a
&gt; long queue, getting hot and uncomfortable, worrying about getting back
&gt; to work on time, it's easy for your first words to the person serving
&gt; you to be less than friendly... get off on the wrong foot, and why
&gt; *should* they be any better back?
">

I will not be &quot;looking at my own attitude&quot; thank you very much!

I was polite and pleasant and was in no way rushed (I have an hour for
lunch) and had no idea whatsoever when I innocently used the services
being offered to me that a political situation existed between the PO
and the RM. I therefore see no reason whatsoever why I should have to
take the brunt of the counter staff's rudeness because of it and I
equally fail to see the reason for your defence of it.

And for the record, despite the not inconsiderable rudeness shown to me
and the inconvenience experienced, I did not complain *at all* to the
lady behind the counter nor to anyone else in the PO at the time. I just
left as quickly as I could, taking the nasty taste in my mouth with me.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Just out of interest, the reason they were miffed was because they
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; still had to do all the work, while not getting any of the revenue.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If you're going to expect the PO to issue the stickers, do the

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; And where do you get this little gem from Kim? The SPM *does* get
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; paid for handling *PREPAID* mail, despite what he might think. Would
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the SPM be as miffed if you'd simply bought a stamp from the local
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; paper shop and then posted via his SPO? No, he probably wouldn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's interesting.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I sell little on ebay nowadays but recent sold a couple of books and
&gt; &gt; &gt; went with the Paypal version of stamped addressed labels as that's
&gt; &gt; &gt; nice and neat. I had intended just to pop them in the post box but
&gt; &gt; &gt; realised they were too big when I tried so instead I took them to a
&gt; &gt; &gt; PO in my lunch break.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What a dreadful experience that was!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd taken the trouble to print out the COPs as I now going to the PO
&gt; &gt; &gt; and asked for them to be stamped. The big-bad-wolf has nothing, I say
&gt; &gt; &gt; NOTHING!, on the woman behind the counter as she huffed and puffed and
&gt; &gt; &gt; loudly embarrassed me by complaining about the bleeding people who
&gt; &gt; &gt; pointlessly make her life more difficult by pre-printing their postage
&gt; &gt; &gt; labels when she has to still do all the work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So instead of just handing my parcels over and getting my receipts
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamped she tarted about getting me to recall how much exactly I has
&gt; &gt; &gt; paid for the stamps (I had picked to option where this isn't printed)
&gt; &gt; &gt; so that she could print extra labels to stick on the parcels - and it
&gt; &gt; &gt; took ages! And all this in front of a busy lunchtime queue.

&gt; &gt; &gt; With a final glower, she handed me my COPs, and I scurried off
&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking &quot;never again&quot; and I haven't been back to that PO since.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And after all that you say the witch got paid? Bleeding heck. :-(

Please do.  No customer deserves to be treated with rudeness if a
situation develops which is not the fault of the customer.  Yes, some
customers can be rude, difficult and generally unpleasant, but they are
few and far between.  The reason I enjoy being a sub postmaster is the
customers.  The people who come into the office, some day in, day out,
some occasionally and some perhaps just once.

Sounds to me as though the rude lady behind the counter was an employee,
and the SPM may not even be aware of the situation?

Believe me, you are not the only person with similar thoughts.  I could

helping competitors - more about just getting rid of customers and
closing post offices.  When RM close a PO, they are obliged to pay
compensation, and, possibly worse, face huge storms of public protest,
commons debates etc.  However, if RM can organise things such that the
sub postmaster just cannot afford to continue the business, and closes
the PO, then RM can look all innocent, and exclaim that it was not
*their* decision, and is nothing to do with them.

&gt; I can, and do, sympathise with the idea - we (SPMs) should be paid for
&gt; what we do, not an average figure which may or may not be accurate.
&gt; However, time is, as always, the factor.  Today, a quiet Wednesday in the

&gt; The situation would be much improved if we could settle to stamps, rather
&gt; than label, particularly where we have a file of items, all the same

&gt;&gt;To the OP, if you get ANY grief at all from the Postmaster, make a
&gt;&gt;complaint
&gt;&gt;via the Post Office External Helpline (08457 223344), these complaints ARE

Well to be fair it never crossed my mind that that'd ever happen. But
then again it never crossed my mind that SPMs would have any issues
with OLP. Yes, I was extremely naieve (sp?) on that front, but like I
said, we all make mistakes.

I think it's case case of think yes, it's a waste of time and
resources, but would it save us getting earache from whinging SPMs
complaining about not geting paid fairly.

Would it be fair for RMG to just pay all SPMs a set amount? No, it
wouldn't, as some offices will deal with more OLP/Prepaid stuff than
others. So to me, this is the next best option.

Geep, can you think of a better way to do it?

That is the way the system worked for twenty years, but no, I don't

I would suggest putting these OLP/pre paid items through Horizon, but

I am a little careful of what I say here, but, IMO, yes :-)

Let me give you an example.  Before becoming an SPM, I wanted to find
out as much as I could about the job, the relationship with the PO etc.,
and, perhaps most importantly, the sort of questions I should be asking
the PO, at my interview.  NFSP were absolutely hopeless.  They refused
to answer any enquiries from me, as I was not a SPM.  After taking on
the job, I queried this with NFSP, and was met with a look of shock and
horror.  They just could not see that it would be in their interests,
and in the interests of their members to encourage sub post office
ownership.  Perhaps they are terrified of putting people off the idea
:-)

The result was that, at my interview, I did not know how to phrase
certain questions.  I was not told untruths as such, but the interviewer
was extremely economical with the truth.

The only contact I have with PO staff, apart from the appalling help
line, is rural development managers, or whatever they are called now.
Nice people, but they have no more say in what goes on than I do.
Ruining their day by voicing my concerns is fairly pointless - they have
heard it all before, and are powerless to do anything about it.
