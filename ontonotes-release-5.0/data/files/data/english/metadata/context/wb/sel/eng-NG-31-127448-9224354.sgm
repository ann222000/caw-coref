I was in a cafe recently, I order some tea,
then ask the girl behind the counter, &quot;Do
they have any honey?&quot;

She answers:  &quot;Yes.&quot;

That's it.  Then we stare at each other a few seconds...
and I'm like, &quot;uh, I'd like to get a teaspoon for my tea.&quot;
And she's like, &quot;oh, you want some honey?  Let me
get the bottle.&quot;

That's right... I had to explain the REASON I
inquired about the honey!

Now, according to the Darwinists, traits are selected
per their usefulness.  For humans, it's supposedly
our intelligence which got us to the top of the food chain.

Then how come there are so many air heads?
Why would that trait be selected?  If anything
should be filtered out, that would be it...

I think this proves Darwin was wrong and God exists.

PS Yes, she is blond.

So your explanation of why God made airheads is...?

He was having a bad hair day?

He had nothing much on his mind and was doodling?

He made blondes so that men could have easy sex?

The fact that you used the phrase &quot;And she's like..&quot; indicates that you, my son,
are one of her race. You may have dangly bits between your legs (albeit
shriveled, testosterone-free, and full of low-mobility sperm), but you're still
a member of the same airhead generation who cannot report a conversation without
prefixing each quote with the word &quot;like&quot;.

Whenever people like you stroll past me, I look for a solid anchor point with
which to belay myself, lest your vacuoisty ultimately implodes and sucks up a
half-square mile of the neighborhood, spewing the crushed debris into an
oblivion nether dimension where the infinites are more split than your
over-producted hair, and the participles dangle more than your aforementioned
girly boy-bits.

You suck. You all totally suck.

Shouldn't you have asked: &quot;Do you have any honey?&quot; Why did you use a
third person plural pronoun when a second person singular pronoun was
more appropriate. She might have been an English major and was struck
dumbfounded by the way you asked your question and took a while to
recover her thoughts.

Your poorly worded inquiry finally rang through. Then she got you a
bottle of honey, maybe one of the plastic squeeze kinds that one could
have efficiently squirted into the tea without the added step of
pouring it into the spoon. Or maybe there was a bin of plastic spoons
and she expected that you would know that. Or maybe she had gotten a
disturbing call from her boyfriend ten minutes previous which
compounded with you referring to her as &quot;they&quot; really made her wonder
why there are such inconsiderate people in the world. Or maybe she was
new on the job and hadn't encountered the &quot;honey for my tea&quot; situation
yet. Next time someone asks she might be more prompt.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well I've driven through drivethrus at fast food places oodles of

*The* food chain? Huh? Where did you learn your Darwinism? Top of what
food chain? Where do we fit in the marine food web when large sharks
are swimming about? What about in the jungle when tigers are roaming?
How about in Alaska when grizzly bears are roaming? What about you
take a look in your gut sometime and ask the bacteria where they fit?

Intelligence is one human attribute among many that have allowed our
ancestors to satisfice.  Opposable thumbs and upright walking are
others.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then how come there are so many air heads?

At worst she can hold a job so she's making a living. How old was she?
Did she actually like her job or was it a chance for spare money?
Maybe she's working part time, living with her parents (or boyfriend
or husband) and struggling through college or vocational school and
when you met her she was really tired from lack of sleep because it
was final exam week and she had to work a double shift because someone
called in sick. She was more interested in mentally rehearsing for a
calculus exam than your trivial need for an odd choice of sweetener.

One can have the potential for developing their innate intelligence,
but in actuality something short-circuits along the way. Or someone
could have some cognitive roadblocks but work harder to achieve more.
The tortoise vs. the hare. A slacker with a high IQ isn't going to
achieve much. They still have to learn. It may take longer, but somene
with a lower IQ could learn the skill they need to earn a good living
and be reasonably successful.

I hope you are never an airhead enough to put yourself atop *the* food
chain which includes barracuda as a top predator. If humans habitually
preyed on barracuda, there would be more ciguatera poisoning. Being at
the apex of *a* food chain (within the larger webs) opens one up to
bioaccumulation of toxins each step along the way.

Many humans aren't at the top of any food chain at all. People who are
buried after they're dead tend to get eaten by worms. Those get eaten
by birds, etc. And even for humans who get cremated after death and
are true meat lovers during life, there are still a lot of animals
they don't eat.

I am in the middle of the food chain. With plants, eggs and cheese
below me, and worms above me.

&gt;So you think women who act smart have more sex?  Interesting theory.

Having a lot of sex is not really a survival trait for women;
they are limited to at most one child a year, with each pregnancy
exacting a toll on overall health.  Therefore, it benefits them
(genetically) to be very picky.

Where being an airhead *is* a (genetic) survival trait is in a society
that has invented birth control.  The best genetic &quot;defense&quot; against
birth control right now is being too dumb to be able to use it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; She answers:  &quot;Yes.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's it.  Then we stare at each other a few seconds...
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I'm like, &quot;uh, I'd like to get a teaspoon for my tea.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And she's like, &quot;oh, you want some honey?  Let me
&gt; &gt; &gt; get the bottle.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, according to the Darwinists, traits are selected
&gt; &gt; &gt; per their usefulness.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Then how come there are so many air heads?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why would that trait be selected?  If anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be filtered out, that would be it...

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think this proves Darwin was wrong and God exists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; PS Yes, she is blond.

&gt; &gt; So your explanation of why God made airheads is...?

&gt; So you tacitly accept His existence?

No, but you do, so I was asking what *your* explanation was.

&gt; &gt; He was having a bad hair day?
&gt; &gt; He had nothing much on his mind and was doodling?
&gt; &gt; He made blondes so that men could have easy sex?

&gt; Explanation?  What mere mortal can divine
&gt; the divine?  The Lord works in mysterious ways...

And you show that you have none. OK, good to know.

&gt; You see through me, hey?

It's just like looking through air.

&gt;Let's get back to a near-animal &quot;society&quot; and see how fast such morons get
&gt;weeded out. &quot;Oh, a pack of hungry wolves... ... *blank stare* ...
&gt;AIEEEEEEEE!&quot; :)

&gt;And on the other hand... *gets darkly cynical* That's kind of an adaptation
&gt;to times where any _thinking_ person will go mad quickly, like living in
&gt;shrubbenführer's 4th reich of ameriKKKa.

&gt;Damn, watching from afar I cannot but say kudos to everyone of you who's
&gt;still sane after 7 years of living in la la land...

&gt;&gt; PS Yes, she is blond.

&gt;Hey now... our current trainee at work is one of the smartest I remember
&gt;currently. She's blond too. :)

My best friend is a natural blond and one of the smartest people I have
had the good fortune to know.
