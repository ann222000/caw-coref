&gt; I Have a Dream - Free College for Illegals - AMNESTY Nightmare Returns

&gt; A Washington Times editorial states, &quot;The Dream Act would repeal a
&gt; 1996 law - the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
&gt; Act - which included a provision barring any state from offering
&gt; discounted tuition to illegals unless it provided the same tuition
&gt; discount to all U.S. citizens.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But 10 states (California, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico,
&gt; New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Washington) currently grant
&gt; reduced in-state tuition to illegals in violation of federal law.&quot;

&gt; &quot;It would be difficult to exaggerate all of the perverse incentives in
&gt; the Dream Act, which provide illegals with better treatment than
&gt; citizens and non-citizens who obey the law.&quot;

&gt; &quot;This is a clear-cut issue: The Dream Act is a nightmare.&quot;

&gt; A Traitorous Senate Strikes AGAIN by Land and Sea with an Assault on
&gt; the United States to Sneak Amnesty into Law

&gt; The Senate is at it again trying to push through AMNESTY LEGISLATION
&gt; ignoring the will of legal citizens with a sneak attack. The Minuteman
&gt; Civil Defense Corps (MCDC) calls upon citizens nationally to join them
&gt; in opposing both the DREAM ACT and the STRIVE program.

&gt; This NEW AMNESTY PROPOSAL being brought forward NOW in the U.S. Senate
&gt; hopes to officially create the roadmap to amnesty that President
&gt; George W. Bush and the &quot;open-borders&quot; lobby continue to espouse. This
&gt; latest amnesty program has been added as Senate Amendment 2237 to the
&gt; Defense Department's 2008 Appropriation Bill by Senator Dick Durbin (D-
&gt; IL) and seeks among many of its provisions to grant U.S. citizenship
&gt; to underage illegal aliens.

This all seems to be a fuss about &quot;offering citizenship to underage
illegals.&quot;  The constitution already grants citizenship to children born
in the U.S.  Have you read it lately?

The simplest solution is to demand that our states announce there will
be no prosecution for crimes against illegals. If we did that, the
illegals would leave on their own and at no cost. Illegals have no rights.

&gt;The simplest solution is to demand that our states announce there will
&gt;be no prosecution for crimes against illegals. If we did that, the
&gt;illegals would leave on their own and at no cost. Illegals have no rights.

Unfortunately for you, illegals have ALL rights, except those
specifically reserved for citizens.  The 14th amendment gives rights
to due process to &quot;persons&quot; not to &quot;citizens&quot;.

They have human rights, just no legal ones. Yes, there *is* a

Being &quot;persons&quot;, they have constitutional rights, which are &quot;legal
ones&quot;.  No state can deprive them of those constitutional rights,
which include almost all of those that citizens have.

Have YOU read it lately?  If so, please post all the pertinent
sections, even the ones stating who is excluded (like those children
of parents who may be here illegally).  Thanks, in advance for your
research into this.

What we have here is just a plain old failure to enforce the laws that
are currently on the books.  It's unknown to you and me  (and that may
be the intent) whether the failure is due to budgetary reasons,
political pressures, priorities any or all of the above or anything
else POLITICIANS can think of to better their positions.

I think if I was an applicant for citizenship, I would rally my fellow
countrymen who are seeking the same legal status here in the US and
file a class action suit against Uncle Sam and everyone else involved
in helping illegals stay here, including those loud mouth bastards who
are trying to make Spanish the official language for the US.

Catch the Sunday Cowboys game?  NFL honoring those spanish speaking
consumers who have the dough to spend $100 on jerseys but can't buy
auto insurance.  Commercials in spanish.  Not only do they have their
own fuckin networks, now they jump onto mine with that yackayackayacka
that we can't (and won't) understand.

Actually not so.  The state can deprive ME of my second amendment
rights in spite of the 14th amendment and the fact I was born here.
That is because they claim those rights have not yet been
&quot;incorporated&quot; into the 14th therefore they can be ignored.

Generally speaking up to now, this country has taken the view that any
non-citizen is under the same rights and laws as citizens. It is not a
guarantee that they must be treated that way, but the idea was that
since we believe in our system so strongly, then we should impose it
universally on all to set an example.  Not a bad idea, I'd say.  But
9-11 and Gitmo changed that. Now non-citizens are routinely being held
under different rules than citizens. And there is really nothing that
says we can't treat non-citizens, especially illegal non-citizens
under another set of rules. It just means that then you are setting a
different kind of example to the world.

There is dispute as to what your 2nd amendment rights are, if any.

Whatever they are, they are the same as for any other &quot;person&quot; in this
country.

It hasn't clearly been decided that there are any rights to
incorporate.  If and when that happens, incorporation will likely
follow without any need for a court to opine.

The 14th amendment does not make any distinction.

Indeed, there is very little in the Constitution that distinguishes
&quot;citizens&quot; apart from any other persons.

I don't think it is &quot;routine&quot;, and indeed Bush tried to hold an
American citizen under his &quot;different rules&quot; (Hamdi and Padilla).

And Gitmo wasn't the first time.  The US still hasn't lived down its
treatment of Japanese and German immigrants during the World Wars.

The 14th amendment refers to persons.
