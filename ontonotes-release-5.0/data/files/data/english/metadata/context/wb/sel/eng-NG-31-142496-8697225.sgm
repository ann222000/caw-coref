Saturday Evening, Tonite September 15th

8:30pm ET
Lisa Natoli
Teacher, Counselor, Writer, Inspiration

Pamela's Topic:
&quot;An Invitation to leave the world&quot;

Lisa Natoli' site:
http://www.lisanatoli.com

http://www.gorgeousforgod.com

Lisa is our Guest Teacher every Sunday Evening at 2pm ET

Lisa Natoli says:
The reason the phrase &quot;love heals all things&quot; is true is because love
is the highest frequency of energy there is, and no problems or
sickness exist at that
level. There is only love, joy, freedom, happiness and peace. It's a
whole other world.
In this place, you know you are loved and lovable. At this level, you
feel truly safe and happy, and life is one big adventure.

Most people have no problem raising their vibration to
the level of love - you laugh a lot, you smile
constantly, you feel alive - but the difficulty is
that most people cannot maintain the frequency of love
for extended periods of time. They dip back down into
lower frequencies, where pain, depression, doubt and
sadness exist. But with practice, you can learn to
live in a world where there is only love.
By following a few simple instructions, you can learn to raise your
energy level (and keep it raised!) to a place where
miracles occur naturally every day.

I hope to see you Saturday night, 8:30PM EST on
paltalk.com when we leave this world of pain and
sickness behind, and never come back.

I love you. Lisa Natoli
Gorgeous for God

LISA NATOLI's NEW BOOK,
GORGEOUS FOR GOD,
CHANGE YOUR MIND &amp; YOU CHANGE YOUR LIFE
comes out shortly on Amazon.com

Is it possible that the idea is to let inner guidance help one to

What's that to do with this conversation?
The ego is not to be overcome, within Course frameworks.
It is to be taken to God.

i often have difficulty seeing what your point is. anything can appear to be
outside rather than inside, but that does not change the fact that it is all
inside. i do not see the ego as the demon that many seem to see. i am not an
acim fundmentalist, i see it as a useful tool in a toolbox full of useful
tools. as i see it, the only real use for the course in to help me know
myself, who i am in truth. when i complete that simple task, there is
nothing more to do.

just out of curiosity tho, how does one take something that does not exist
to anyone, especially god?

Yet, Who we are in truth is ego-less. If we insist on the ego being
inside, we have abandoned truth in feverish dreams. (&lt;--imho)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&quot;Bringing the ego to God, is but to bring error to truth, where it stands
corrected, because it is the OPPOSITE of what it meets, and is undone
because the CONTRADICTION can no longer stand. How long can contradiction
stand, when its impossible nature is clearly revealed?&quot;

and from L 72:

The light of truth is in us, where it was placed by God. It is the body that
is outside us, and is not our concern. To be without a body is to be in our
natural state.[...]

“What is salvation, Father?

I do not know.

Tell me, that I may understand.”

Then we will wait in quiet for His answer.

Great idea. Voice contact adds a dimension
and depth the written word may lack. My skype
handle is 'sonshipradio'. Although I felt our difficulties
had more to do with the ideas that are mentioned.

I am particularly grateful for the topic inside vs outside
as mentioned in the Material, because the experience
of the Holy Instant is bare of body identification and
bodily sensations each time, seen from my pov.
And that is the proof in the pudding idea, isn't it?

Please don't hesitate to write a short notice like
&quot;can you say that again?&quot; or &quot;in plain English please&quot;
whenever my writings are confusing or obscure.
That way I can improve by learning, and that's
what I feel is appropriate in communications.

thanks, maZ~

&gt;&gt;i often have difficulty seeing what your point is.

&gt; I often have difficulties seeing what Jesus' point is.
&gt; And his point is what we explore here, not mine. ok?

&gt;&gt; anything can appear to be outside rather than inside, but that does not
&gt;&gt; change the fact that it is all inside. i do not see the ego as the demon
&gt;&gt; that many seem to see. i am not an acim fundmentalist, i see it as a
&gt;&gt; useful tool in a toolbox full of useful tools. as i see it, the only real
&gt;&gt; use for the course in to help me know myself, who i am in truth. when i
&gt;&gt; complete that simple task, there is nothing more to do.

&gt; Yet, Who we are in truth is ego-less. If we insist on the ego being
&gt; inside, we have abandoned truth in feverish dreams. (&lt;--imho)

&gt;&gt; just out of curiosity tho, how does one take something that does not
&gt;&gt; exist to anyone, especially god?

&gt; &quot;Bringing the ego to God, is but to bring error to truth, where it stands
&gt; corrected, because it is the OPPOSITE of what it meets, and is undone
&gt; because the CONTRADICTION can no longer stand. How long can contradiction
&gt; stand, when its impossible nature is clearly revealed?&quot;

&gt; and from L 72:

&gt; The light of truth is in us, where it was placed by God. It is the body
&gt; that is outside us, and is not our concern. To be without a body is to be
&gt; in our natural state.[...]

&gt; “What is salvation, Father?

&gt; I do not know.

&gt; Tell me, that I may understand.”

&gt; Then we will wait in quiet for His answer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;mr bill&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;i see no sense in leaving out any of the parts, as all of it is going on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;in here.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Your take on it. The workbook process advises and instructs otherwise.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show me anyone in this world who has overcome the ego. i do not believe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that it can be done.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What's that to do with this conversation?
&gt;&gt;&gt; The ego is not to be overcome, within Course frameworks.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is to be taken to God.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't the ego &quot;inner guidence&quot; as well?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Try, 'I am at home, fear is the stranger here',
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and ego/body might appear to be outside,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not inside.  maz

&gt; Great idea. Voice contact adds a dimension
&gt; and depth the written word may lack. My skype
&gt; handle is 'sonshipradio'. Although I felt our difficulties
&gt; had more to do with the ideas that are mentioned.

&gt; I am particularly grateful for the topic inside vs outside
&gt; as mentioned in the Material, because the experience
&gt; of the Holy Instant is bare of body identification and
&gt; bodily sensations each time, seen from my pov.
&gt; And that is the proof in the pudding idea, isn't it?

&gt; Please don't hesitate to write a short notice like
&gt; &quot;can you say that again?&quot; or &quot;in plain English please&quot;
&gt; whenever my writings are confusing or obscure.
&gt; That way I can improve by learning, and that's
&gt; what I feel is appropriate in communications.

&gt; thanks, maZ~

it seems to me that it would be more important for my to turn up the
sensitivity of my receiver, as i am sure that mission control is
broadcasting at the perfect frequency and power.
