Yeah, leave it to the most extreme of today's psychopathic,
social-climbing narcissists to coin a disgusting phrase like &quot;starter
husband&quot; and expect it to carry the same moral connotations as &quot;starter
home&quot;. If you ever meet a woman who admits to regularly reading a rag
like &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, it's probably in your best interests to &quot;next&quot; her
as fast as you can.

But in terms of cringe-worthiness, that's nothing. On the same page as
the above article, there's a link to another, titled &quot;Is Anal Bleaching
Right For You?&quot;

The concept of &quot;starter husband&quot;, regrettably, was not even close to
being the worst thing in that article. Here's a few gems that stood
out for me:

&quot;The problem? He was boring. &quot;Wholly uncomplicated,&quot; as she puts it.
The kind of guy who reads Tom Clancy books on the couch and watches
Adam Sandler movies while dreaming of white-picket fences. Going to
depressing French movies, leapfrogging over the less ambitious on the
company ladder - those were the things that excited Andi.&quot;

So... she didn't know what hobbies her husband-to-be had prior to
getting married? Her interests, excitement-wise, are not exactly
skydiving off of Petrionas towers either.

&quot;I think marriage is the new dating and having kids is the new
marriage,&quot;
&quot;It's true. I wouldn't have married him if I didn't think I could get
out of it.&quot;

Glad we got that clear. Especially since divorce laws cater to women
in most cases and it's just a wise business decision to marry.

&quot;Despite how it sounds, Andi is not a first-class bit**. She's the
type who will hunt down the most perfectly thoughtful baby gift or
whisk you off to a much-needed mani-pedi after your boss goes nuclear
on you.&quot;

She's not?? Exactly how far does female camaraderie reach? Any limits?
It's funny that the sample good deeds that she's presumably capable
off relate to another high maintenance gossipy bit**. Mani-pedi???? I
wonder if she would ever help a blind man accross the street or shove
him under the bus cause he's wasting space. My vote is on the latter.

This is from the author's experience:
&quot;I don't have to look far in my own life to find human faces that bear
out the numbers: One of my best friends from college barely scratched
out a two-year union following her six-figure Hawaiian wedding&quot;

I wonder what percentage of those six figures came from the bride's
pockets. And I wonder who's idea was it to HAVE a six figure Hawaiian
wedding.

&quot;While our grandmothers were forced to remain shackled to unhappy
unions for monetary reasons, most women today have the financial
wherewithal to cry uncle and bolt whenever we get uncomfortable. &quot;

Ummm... yeah... and most of those monetary resources come straight out
of the husband's pockets.

&quot;I totally bought into the wedding-industry machine,&quot; admits Elisa,
who spent more time obsessively planning every detail of her nuptials
for 300 at a Malibu estate than she did working on her master's
thesis. From the five-star vegan menu to the Japanese lanterns to the
playlist, Elisa's focus was all wedding, no marriage. &quot;I had a totally
misguided notion of what a wedding was about,&quot; she says. &quot;You work
toward this giant event, have an enormous party, then an hour after
you get married, reality sets in. I was like, Oh, sh** - that didn't
really solve anything.&quot;

Sheeesh!! I would dismiss this as implausible gibberish if I didn't
see plentiful examples in everyday life. F*ing disgusting!

&quot;You can almost forgive a girl for focusing on the party and
forgetting about the hangover.&quot;

And I naively thought that the female author might admonish this
behaviour and call her out on not being stupid and irresponsible. How
silly of me...

&quot;And when she realized that she didn't even have a clue what a good
marriage looked like, let alone what one felt like, she didn't
hesitate to produce her Get Out of Jail Free card.&quot;

I wouldn't call it &quot;free&quot; giving up at least 50% of one's assets and
many years of alimony payments. Or was that not the case for that
lucky woman?

&quot;It's easy to write these women off as callous or self-absorbed. And
yet on some level, they just might be pioneers: Why stay put in an
empty shell of a marriage - an arrangement on paper only - instead of
calling it what it is? &quot;This generation is reinventing marriage,&quot;

It's not just easy - it's correct!! I agree with one thing; marriage,
as it stands today is an empty shell, and while it's a financial
goldmine for women, it's an absolute no-win situation for men.

You think men haven't been doing exactly that since time out of mind?
Albeit without explaining their motivation for divorce because guys in
general never were very honest or effective communicators when it came
to their dicks.  It should come as no surprise that women - in the age
of new 'equality' (what a joke!) - are taking up this mantle.

If you're a guy what you should be asking yourself is &quot;why does this
surprise me?&quot;

That said and my moral conscience salved - those women are nasty

went around comes back around.

I'm surprised! Well, not really. But if I were, it'd because I was
confused. How was I confused? It seems as if women today cry for the
need for equality and try to display more intelligence and sensitivity
then men could reflect in their behavior and yet, acting this way
seems like a devolution of everything that was fought for before.
Seemingly hypocritical.

Guys are not horrible communicators. It is only that the 2 genders
differently value what truly is communication. In my experience, many
women communicate by intrepretation and men communicate with...knock
on wood...words spoken from their mouths. If you learn to to
communicate like a man, communication runs smoothly. Vice versa with
women. Women are horrible at communication when the lot of them expect
men to just &quot;magically know&quot; what is expected of them in a
relationship. When reprimanded for not remembering to be or do
something, his response would be, &quot;You never told me.&quot; She replies, &quot;I
did, I acted this or that way and it was so obvious what I was
saying.&quot; Ladies, to communicate to men, just say it. For some reason,
most women have this notion that they can telepathically send mental
vibes to the guy and he'll all of sudden &quot;get it.&quot; Don't assume he'll
think like you and try to &quot;intrepret&quot; what you're trying to say.
Ironically, men, do try to intrepret her, but not in the way she does.
If you don't know, ask. It also helps to listen to what is actually
coming out of her mouth. It's even better help when you regurgitate
exactly what she said, but paraphrased. &quot;So you're saying....&quot;
Something like that. This eliminates the surprise &quot;you forgot?&quot;
moments.

Truthfully, it's obvious how fickle this woman is with relationships.
She also seems like a pushover being that she was &quot;pressured&quot; by her
friends and family to marry this guy. My grandparents marriage was
&quot;arranged&quot; by the 2 families (obviously this is a different country).
Key word: &quot;grandparents.&quot; If you want to use &quot;new age&quot; behavior to
justify your actions, then you should know that in this &quot;new age&quot;
behavior, you can choose who to grow old with now. People coin phrases
such as the aformentioned &quot;starter-husband,&quot; not to reflect a new age
movement, but to justify their mistake and say it wasn't their fault.
The only way they can think to logically justify it is push that this
idea should be a common thing.

You know what I think about women and equality?  Real equality - not the
equality women think they should be 'granted' by men - is a myth.  There
*is* no equality.  Women and men are complimentary, not equal.  A woman
demanding equality is like a hamster thinking other animals will treat
it more fairly by pretending it's a tiger.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Guys are not horrible communicators.
">

What I said was &quot;guys in general never were very honest or effective
communicators when it came to their dicks&quot;.  That sounds similar to what
you said but isn't by a long shot.  I didn't say guys were horrible
communicators.

In my experience I've never, ever met a man who could look his
partner/friend in the eye and say &quot;this is my dick, it/I want(s) this,
it/I want(s) that, I feel the desire for this or that, I'm not ashamed
of it, I can be honest about what I want, etc.&quot;  There is always -
without fail - game playing, white lying, avoidance and sugar coating
the truth.

I admit this is probably because their partners couldn't handle the
truth initially, or maybe even ever.  But it still needs to be there.  I
think guys need to get to the point where they're open about what they
want and need and the lying (at worst) and mystery (at best) needs to stop.

Just by chance yesterday I met an older couple who run a fruit and
veggie stand in the city center.  The lady stood talking to a customer
when I arrived and shortly afterward said goodbye to her husband and
walked out.  While he was ringing my order up he said jokingly &quot;See
that?  I work all day while my wife stands around talking, then she
leaves!&quot;  I told him &quot;Looks like to me between the two of you your wife
is the smarter&quot;, and he replied &quot;Nah, she's just going to the Mosque to
pray.  But you know what makes a good marriage?  When two people don't
lie to one another.  Neither should lie, and the one receiving honesty
should be merciful enough to look the other way now and then.  When you
start lying to one another there's no point in continuing.&quot;

I was kinda stunned at what he said because it came out of the blue and
landed on me.  But the more I mulled it over the more I saw he was
right.  There should be honesty between the sexes and that honesty
shouldn't be met with punishment.

I know! :D  Been there, lived that.

I've been with my husband and behaved a certain way... you know, wanted
something and didn't ask for it outright because that didn't seem the
way to get it.  I don't even know myself why that is, but I approach
things in a roundabout way because it seems more natural.  It ended with
my husband being frustrated and clueless and me being angry.  Later on
when we discussed it he told me he's not a mindreader and in future
should I want something I need to come out and say it so he can respond.

I think it comes down to women caring more about the complexity of
emotion, the different layers of motivation that influence a decision or
need.  In my experience men don't care much about motivation, they care
about action and reaction.  Solid things.  Whereas women need to see
what influenced us to be where we are, and what the several possible
outcomes of an action will be so we can choose the best one.

It's no wonder we need to learn to communicate with one another.

Exactly.  I find the 'regurgitating' very helpful too.  Very often what
I think I've heard (and vice versa) is incorrect and this enables my
husband to clarify.

Yes, but I think that article's interest factor lies in sensationalism
