has this ever been decided by some court, whether you can
claim copyright for chessgames or positions
and then successfully prevent others
from publishing the moves ?

Suppose some tournament, where players agree to submit
the rights on the games to the organizer who claims copyright.
Although the spectators and journalists can follow the moves
they mustn't publish them, else they are sued.

Suppose some players who only play under such conditions,
so they can prevent their bad games from being published later...

is it realistic ?

Yes. This has been decided many times and the decision is that there
is no copyright to the moves of a chess game.

There may be exceptions. For example, a composed game clearly
identified as such, for example Sam Loyd's famous composition of a
stalemate in 12, would be copyrightable, but the moves to a normal
tournament game between two contestants could not be copyrighted.

The part of the game that is protectable is that which is tied to the
players: competitions, game collections, etc.

Publishing the moves without the name of the players is obviously fine, but
no one's ever challenged the right-to-publicity angles, i.e., Fischer's
right to publicity when they let you know he was playing White, etc.

I suspect sometime or other an organizer or player is going to assert these
rights.  Shveshnikov is about the only play I know of who has, and no one
has wanted to challenge him I guess out of fear of losing a publishing cash
cow.

How rich would Fischer be now if he were allowed to license the use of his
name in connection with his game scores?

The exception is not an exception.

A composed game could perhaps be copyrighted - but this copyright would
only be valid in a &quot;composed games&quot; context.  There would be no way to
prevent two players from reproducing that very same game over the board.

Right-to-publicity laws generally prohibit profiting from someone's image or
likeness without their permission.

It isn't a copyright violation if I publish Game 3 of the 1972 world
championship, but if I say it's &quot;Fischer-Spassky&quot; then most of the
publication value would extend from the knowledge of who played the game,
and when.

Oddly, copyright protection might slow the computer onslaught a bit, as
theory would take longer to proliferate and thus reward original thinkers
far more, especially if they publish their innovations.

It would have been interesting.  My personal opinion is he probably
would not have won for several reasons, one being that being famous
prevents you from claiming your name was used without permission and
demanding royalties.

For example I can use famous people's names without owing them
royalties as it is done all the time.   Now if I claim that a famous
person has endorsed my product or my movie or my magazine that is an
entirely different situation.

If Fischer had won, it's conceivable that mentioning Queen Elizabeth,
Paris Hilton or any well known public figure would mean having to pay
them royalties for mentioning them.  If we take that to the full
logical extreme a newspaper could not run a story on anyone famous
without having to pay them for the right to mention their name.
Having never seen the movie &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; I am curious if
Malkovich is actually IN the movie or if they just used his name in
the title?  If so did they pay him royalties?  If so then maybe
Fischer's case would be strengthened.  If not then it would prove my
point.  Also what about references to Elvis?  Should using Elvis' name
in a movie require paying royalties to his estate?  In I Walk the
Line, the biographical film about Johnny Cash, people are portraying
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Carl Perkins, June Carter Cash and the her
parents.  In addition someone is portraying Johnny's first wife.  Does
that mean the film had to pay them all royalties?  I doubt it.

At the time the movie was being made, Fischer was in self imposed
seclusion and even if attempts had been made to ask his permission or
offer him royalties for his participation or cooperation, it is
doubtful he would have been interested.  Actually more than likely he
would have sued to prevent them from using his name or from making the
movie.

I'm comfortable.  I have published famous games of many players before
including Fischer.  There is no recognizable legal copyright to the
moves of a game of chess, played by famous people or otherwise.

Using someone else's name is not a copyright violation.  Even being
the first to play a combination does not make it copyrightable.  It
would be totally uneforceable to claim otherwise.

Now if Fischer made a series of notes about his games and I used them
without his permission that would be a copyright violation.  If I used
someone's photo of Fischer without the photographer's permission that
would be a copyright violation.

Only on a contingency basis would they feel that way, and few chessplayers

Do unauthorized biographies about Mickey Mantle include footage from his

I wouldn't be shocked if in the internet age that one might have to pay for

Then why mention that Fischer played the game if his name doesn't add value
to publication?

If it does add value, then a court will decide how that value should be
distributed.  Right-to-publicity laws are very well-established.  The
application would have to be determined by a court.

I actually have optioned the right to publish the games of some talented
youngsters in order to test this theory should I choose to in the future.

Why should a top junior not be the only one other than the publisher who
profits from the use of his name?  That would give an incredible incentive
to our top players to keep training, and would bring their income in line
with other sports and forms of competition (such as poker).

Using someone's name can be a violation just as using their photograph is.
It's their &quot;likeness&quot; attached to something that gives that something

I am pretty sure that the same game collection titled &quot;two guys playing

That also depends.  It's never cut-and-dried.

Chuck Wepner sued Stallone over Rocky (and just got paid for it 30 years

Generally, I think when the movie isn't profiteering off the name, the
famous person wants the publicity, so 90 percent of it is stopped there.

Most of these questions come down to marketing and how much profit is
generated.  The more profit, and the less the famous person wants the
publicity, the more likely they are to sue, and the more likely they are
also to get paid to prevent suing.

Now if you want to study something fascinating, check out the compulsory
cover license for music, which basically makes it legal to do covers of
other songs if you pay a fixed royalty of like a half-cent per minute per
recording sold.

It's quite possible the Cash movie went and got the permission, but the same

In &quot;The Late Shift&quot; the woman Kathy Bates played sued over her portrayal,

I think the movie was okay because Fischer was just a backdrop, where his

&gt; &gt; It would have been interesting.  My personal opinion is he probably
&gt; &gt; would not have won for several reasons, one being that being famous
&gt; &gt; prevents you from claiming your name was used without permission and
&gt; &gt; demanding royalties.

&gt; That also depends.  It's never cut-and-dried.

&gt; Chuck Wepner sued Stallone over Rocky (and just got paid for it 30 years
&gt; later), because Rocky was based on the Ali-Wepner fight from 1974.

&gt; The studios might settle something like that out of fear of setting a
&gt; precedent that could cost them billions.

&gt; &gt; For example I can use famous people's names without owing them
&gt; &gt; royalties as it is done all the time.   Now if I claim that a famous
&gt; &gt; person has endorsed my product or my movie or my magazine that is an
&gt; &gt; entirely different situation.

&gt; Which is why &quot;Searching For Bobby Fischer&quot; might have crossed a line or two.
&gt; On the other hand, Fischer's very public disappearance would logically lead
&gt; to such a &quot;search.&quot;

&gt; &gt; If Fischer had won, it's conceivable that mentioning Queen Elizabeth,
&gt; &gt; Paris Hilton or any well known public figure would mean having to pay
&gt; &gt; them royalties for mentioning them.

&gt; The Queen is a truly public figure with &quot;public&quot; funding, so the public owns
&gt; that.  Paris Hilton?  It would depend.  Not as likely with a public figure.

&gt; Still, it's not the same thing as actual game scores, which are presumed to
&gt; have a market value based on their existence (for studying).

&gt; &gt;If we take that to the full
&gt; &gt; logical extreme a newspaper could not run a story on anyone famous
&gt; &gt; without having to pay them for the right to mention their name.
&gt; &gt; Having never seen the movie &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; I am curious if
&gt; &gt; Malkovich is actually IN the movie or if they just used his name in
&gt; &gt; the title?  If so did they pay him royalties?  If so then maybe
&gt; &gt; Fischer's case would be strengthened

&gt; Malkovich was in the movie, yes.

&gt; &gt;.  If not then it would prove my
&gt; &gt; point.  Also what about references to Elvis?  Should using Elvis' name
&gt; &gt; in a movie require paying royalties to his estate?

&gt; Generally, I think when the movie isn't profiteering off the name, the
&gt; famous person wants the publicity, so 90 percent of it is stopped there.

&gt; Most of these questions come down to marketing and how much profit is
&gt; generated.  The more profit, and the less the famous person wants the
&gt; publicity, the more likely they are to sue, and the more likely they are
&gt; also to get paid to prevent suing.

The law tends to be strongly precedent based and extremely reactive.
Copyright law has huge volumes of precedent.  My only point was that I
would not sit around worrying about potential copyright infringement
until and unless some new dynamic earth shattering ruling comes down
the pike about it, particularly in regard to chess where the money
involved is fairly miniscule.

The original poster was worried about posting chess games of famous
players getting him into trouble.  My response was that presently it
is perfectly legal and until and unless some earth shattering ruling
goes against the grain and declares it otherwise I think he's
relatively safe.  Even if someone sues they aren't going to sue anyone
without deep pockets.  Until and unless someone wins a case
challenging the current laws, the laws presently don't prohibit what
he wants to do.

When the recording industry sued over downloading of music they mostly
went after the providers NOT the individuals doing the downloading,
which is normal.  No point in suing 17 year olds.  They went after the
large corporations profiting off of the lack of copyright
infringement.

I disagree.  You can certainly copyright a composed position or problem.

That doesn't mean you can prohibit someone from playing into that
position in a game - but it does mean that you can prevent someone from
publishing the same position/problem AS a position/problem.

The key difference is between having an idea and reducing it to concrete
form on the one hand and recording the result of some other activity on
the other hand.  One is creative - the other is reporting.

What can be copyrighted are written works specifically created by
someone.  If I ran off copies of pages from a book of chess problems
and sold them that someone had composed that would be a copyright
violation because the book contained the collection of created chess
problems.

However it would be very difficult to prove that I was violating
copyright laws by creating my own book of problems, unless there was
nearly identical similarity to the problems in my book and the
problems in someone else's previously created work.  There is also
what is called &quot;fair use&quot;.  That means that you can use small amounts
of copyrighted materials under fair use without violating the law.
For example using a single problem from a collection would probably
qualify as fair use, but including several pages of problems composed
in a copyrighted book by another author in my own book would be a
copyright violation.

Think of it as a person not being able to copyright a word or a short
phrase but if I copy verbatim his/her entire poem or story I would be
violating copyright laws.  I can't steal someone else's creative
content.  To prove I am in violation however the person would have to
show that his content was so creative and unique that it is obvious
that I stole it from him/her.

In short, a person would have to prove that your problems were so
identical in creative content and there was substantial evidence to
indicate that you had plagiarized them from a copyrighted work for you
to be in trouble.

What you were asking was if it was safe to publish famous games of
chess masters without violating current copyright laws and I said yes,
it is safe to do that.  That is not the same as photocopying a book
written by someone else that is copyrighted and using it to instruct
or resell.

And if Ken can point out a single problem that is so creative and
unique that it has been copyrightable I would like to hear about it.
I'm not saying there isn't one, but I would like to know where it is
and who composed it and if anyone ever tried to plagiarize it and lost
in court.

I agree that chess games themselves, i.e., the move sequences, can't be

pointing out that they are Fischer's games instead of a random collection of

Only Shveshnikov seems to have succeeded in having his games off the radar,

I suspect you're going to see this issue dealt with in the courts at some

Their real fear is independent distribution, not piracy.

In chess, if the right to publicity were established, you'd have 10 year-old
kids getting offers to sell their chess rights for substantial money.
Imagine what Fischer at age 13 would have gotten!

If I ever find the right player to do this with, I might test the law myself
by purchasing these rights and then asserting them, but it'll have to be a
popular enough player for it to stick.

&gt; &gt; Ken Sloan is right and Bruce is wrong and here are two examples.

&gt; &gt; I have just made &quot;fair use&quot; of the quotes of Ken and Bruce.

Sure. Any created or composed chess problem would be copyrighted.

However, problemists are always anxious to have their compositions
published, so they will not complain if you publish one.

&gt; In short, a person would have to prove that your problems were so

&gt; What you were asking was if it was safe to publish famous games of

&gt; it is safe to do that.  That is not the same as photocopying a book

According to the U.S. Copyright website the following things can be
copyrighted:

§ 102. Subject matter of copyright: In general26
(a) Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in
original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of
expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be
perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or
with the aid of a machine or device. Works of authorship include the
following categories:

(1) literary works;

(2) musical works, including any accompanying words;

(3) dramatic works, including any accompanying music;

(4) pantomimes and choreographic works;

(5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works;

(6) motion pictures and other audiovisual works;

(7) sound recordings; and

(8) architectural works.

(b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of
authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of
operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in
which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such
work.

If one were going to try and get a copyright on a chess problem they
would probably have to go under either #5 or #1.  Im guessing most
chess problems unless they have written explanations by the author
explaining them would fall under pictorial.  Then the question becomes
was the problem so unique and so creative that this would allow the
author to copyright it?

letter b above implies to me that chess combinations cannot be
copyrighted because they are concepts, ideas, principles or discovery
and those things are specifically exempted from being copyrighted,
unless I'm reading that wrong.

Anyway if anyone can find a single example of a chess problem that has
been successfully copyrighted I will acknowledge that they are right
and I am mistaken.

Afterall I didn't sign a sworn affidavit asserting that I am right-
unlike some people I know.

Be specific and cite the author of the problem and tell us when they
got the copyright recognized on their problem?   Tell us any cases
where anyone successfully sued somone for copyright violations
relating to chess problems?

A collection of chess problems could be copyrighted as a literary work
but I'm talking about a single problem being copyrighted.

Bruce has made an interesting point (for a change).

It does not appear that a composed chess problem such as a mate-in-
three would qualify for any of the categories under which a copyright
could be taken.

I have a difficult time believing that this is correct. Would not
Rubik's Cube or some other famous puzzle qualify for a copyright?

But perhaps it does not.

&gt; &gt; According to the U.S. Copyright website the following things can be

&gt; &gt; § 102. Subject matter of copyright: In general26
&gt; &gt; (a) Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in

&gt; &gt; If one were going to try and get a copyright on a chess problem they
&gt; &gt; would probably have to go under either #5 or #1.  Im guessing most
&gt; &gt; chess problems unless they have written explanations by the author
&gt; &gt; explaining them would fall under pictorial.  Then the question becomes
&gt; &gt; was the problem so unique and so creative that this would allow the
&gt; &gt; author to copyright it?

&gt; &gt; letter b above implies to me that chess combinations cannot be
&gt; &gt; copyrighted because they are concepts, ideas, principles or discovery
&gt; &gt; and those things are specifically exempted from being copyrighted,
&gt; &gt; unless I'm reading that wrong.

&gt; &gt; Anyway if anyone can find a single example of a chess problem that has
&gt; &gt; been successfully copyrighted I will acknowledge that they are right
&gt; &gt; and I am mistaken.

&gt; Bruce has made an interesting point (for a change).

&gt; It does not appear that a composed chess problem such as a mate-in-
&gt; three would qualify for any of the categories under which a copyright
&gt; could be taken.

&gt; I have a difficult time believing that this is correct. Would not
&gt; Rubik's Cube or some other famous puzzle qualify for a copyright?

&gt; But perhaps it does not.

Rubiks Cube might be copyrightable because it was unique and created
by someone.

A chess position is difficult to prove is unique and created by
someone.  If you say a chess problem is copyrightable then at what
point is a problem shown on a chess board so unique and creative that
it can be claimed as a creative work?

Can I put a rook and pawn ending in a diagram on a chess board and
claim that my diagram is copyrightable?  That would be an absurd claim
because it takes no creative ingenuity to set up a simple rook and
pawn ending.  However if I were able to devise a problem so creative
that no one else had ever thought it up before or even considered
setting it up before I might be able to claim a copyright on that
problem.

I can find no example of any such problem existing which is why I was
asking you or Ken to cite one so we could see what it looks like?

Even books of problems can be so similar to other books of problems
that unless they appear to be identical there is almost no way of
distinguishing a set of chess problems from another set of chess
problems.

I seem to recall that Laszlo Polgar had sued someone for copyright
violations for using identical problems to those he used in his huge
book of chess combinations, but I don't know if the suit was dropped
or if it ever even made it to court or if it did how it was decided?

A regular chess position cannot be copyrighted, because it is a part
of sequence, idea or strategy that is a component of the game
itself.   What could be copyrighted would be a highly complex problem
with the solution supplied by the person who created the problem.  The
key in my opinion would be that it would have to be unique, meaning
the chances were infinitesimal that this position could be known,
played or even reproduced except by the author.  A position with ten
white queens or simultaneous mating of two white kings, for example
which couldn't occur in a normal game but could be incorporated into a
creative chess problem might be a good test case.

We could also ask this question:  What form of mathematical problem
could in theory be copyrighted?  If we can answer that question we
will come closer to knowing what kind of chess problem can be
copyrighted?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and does it matter whether those positions or games or endgames

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and what about chess-problems : mate in 2 , selfmate,...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are they copyrightable ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What can be copyrighted are written works specifically created by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone.  If I ran off copies of pages from a book of chess problems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and sold them that someone had composed that would be a copyright
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violation because the book contained the collection of created chess
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However it would be very difficult to prove that I was violating
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copyright laws by creating my own book of problems, unless there was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nearly identical similarity to the problems in my book and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems in someone else's previously created work.  There is also
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what is called &quot;fair use&quot;.  That means that you can use small amounts
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of copyrighted materials under fair use without violating the law.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example using a single problem from a collection would probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; qualify as fair use, but including several pages of problems composed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a copyrighted book by another author in my own book would be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copyright violation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think of it as a person not being able to copyright a word or a short
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phrase but if I copy verbatim his/her entire poem or story I would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violating copyright laws.  I can't steal someone else's creative
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; content.  To prove I am in violation however the person would have to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; show that his content was so creative and unique that it is obvious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I stole it from him/her.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In short, a person would have to prove that your problems were so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identical in creative content and there was substantial evidence to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indicate that you had plagiarized them from a copyrighted work for you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be in trouble.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What you were asking was if it was safe to publish famous games of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chess masters without violating current copyright laws and I said yes,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is safe to do that.  That is not the same as photocopying a book
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; written by someone else that is copyrighted and using it to instruct
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or resell.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if Ken can point out a single problem that is so creative and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unique that it has been copyrightable I would like to hear about it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not saying there isn't one, but I would like to know where it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and who composed it and if anyone ever tried to plagiarize it and lost
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in court.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Okay I do need to make a correction here, fair use of copyrighted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; materials only applies to specific uses of the copyrighted information
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such as teaching, research, criticism and not use of the material for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; commercial purposes.  I just attended a workshop on this last Friday
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it was talking about use of copyrighted materials in classrooms
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for instructional purposes.

Actually Rubik's Cube was an object so it was patented not
