Nah, just show the all time record highs by state, check the
&quot;highs&quot; above to the all time record highs in those states in

http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wheat7.htm

Also, the coolest high for any state is a tie, between Hawaii
and Alaska.

If anybody wants to talk about high temperatures being
&quot;warm&quot;, anything under 100 F  for any state other than the two
coolest states, Hawaii and Alaska, is just not worth mentioning.

I checked couple of entries on accuweather.com -- the data seems to be
correct. So, I feel uneasy about the apparent imbalance of highs and

Probably more because there were some really cold periods
in many parts of the country, the Ohio valley was 10 degrees below
normal all during the 1960s, and other areas were below normal at one
time or another.

And there is a strong resistance to freezing, caused by the
latent heat of fusion, the greater mass of the solid and liquid
surfaces, and the interior heat of the Earth.

It would take a really detailed study of all the data sets
to see the reasons (there may be more than one), and who knows,
maybe the Earth is warming, but it may just be ........heat islands.

If it is heat islands, then bigger cities with NWS stations
in them, or NWS stations at or near airports or military bases or large
factory or research complexes.

I think all NWS data is raw, with no modification to remove
heat island effects.

I walked across some really black asphalt in a parking lot
the other day, they should really start whitewashing those things,
the heat was stifling.

No, the data has not been skipped.  I do, however, not bother to report
when there are only a few records.  There are some stations that don't
have many years of data, so one would expect to find that they would
more frequently exceed range of the available temperature records.
Remember too that the data I have is only that of the official NWS
sites.  There are many more sites in the cooperative network, but
these do not submit a report every day.  When the official sites
report a record event, it's also likely that some of the cooperative
sites in the vicinity will also see record temperatures.

It's a good thing to be &quot;uneasy&quot; that the Earth appears to be warming.

Appears to be warming to whom, somebody born yesterday and
hasn't seen many 100 degree days?

Really, you should see the day of the year record
temperatures for what they are, just fills for a sparse data set.

There are 365 days, and for a given location the old records
for a given week may look like
91
90                                                90
89
88
87
86

so it would not be unusual for the 87 to be exceeded in any
year, there does not have  to be warming involved at all, in fact the
Earth could be cooling, and day of the year records could still be
broken fairly regular.

As the data set gets more mature (possibly as long as a
thousand years or so), each day of the year record would be closer to
each other, instead of all the ups and downs.

Any temperature below 100 is fairly normal in most of the
contiguous US states, why you would feel that 90 degrees, or even
88 or 87 in July or August &quot;appears to be warming&quot;, even if it is a high
for the day of the year, is amazing.

But  regardless, CO2 has so little effect it isn't worth
talking about, on a clear night in June a week ago, it was 80 at dusk,
and 58 nine hours later at 6 AM.
What would the temperature have been if the Earth night was
as long as the moon night?

But there is a big difference between the Earth and the
moon, that difference is NOT CO2 in the atmosphere, it is water,
water, everywhere, in the ocean, in the soil, in the air.

So the Earth would not cool as much as the moon, although it
would go well below freezing, because the water would start giving off
heat as it cools, and it takes a lot more energy to cool water than it
does air, and there is a lot more water mass than there is air mass.

CO2  caused global warming is a fluke theory, formed about
200 years ago on false assumptions, using the moon as the base,
but the moon turns too slow, it cools too much, and greenhouse gas
theory doesn't consider the length of the night at all (apparently).

Even water vapor will not slow black sky radiation cooling
much as long as clouds or fog do not form.
The whole idea of greenhouse gas theory needs to be reworked,
starting with a realistic model of radiational black sky cooling, and to
remove the error of the 1800s, determine what the temperature of a
region of the Earth at mid latitudes would be after 300 hours straight
of black sky cooling.

It won't be as cold as the moon, but it will be well below
freezing, even with the heat in the water and the soil, that does not
exist on the moon.

Or perhaps just that these data were recorded during summer...?

&gt; &gt; (Edited, ties excluded)

&gt; &gt; Also, could you please provide verifiable source(s) to the above data?

&gt; I checked couple of entries on accuweather.com -- the data seems to be
&gt; correct. So, I feel uneasy about the apparent imbalance of highs and
&gt; lows. Is it because Eric skipped some days (when there were more lows
&gt; than highs)?- Hide quoted text -

&gt; No, the data has not been skipped.  I do, however, not bother to report
&gt; when there are only a few records.  There are some stations that don't
&gt; have many years of data, so one would expect to find that they would
&gt; more frequently exceed range of the available temperature records.
&gt; Remember too that the data I have is only that of the official NWS
&gt; sites.  There are many more sites in the cooperative network, but
&gt; these do not submit a report every day.  When the official sites
&gt; report a record event, it's also likely that some of the cooperative
&gt; sites in the vicinity will also see record temperatures.

&gt; It's a good thing to be &quot;uneasy&quot; that the Earth appears to be warming.

Maybe this 15 year old girl can show you just why there are more high
temperature records:

The link was split. You have to put the URL together manually.

There are several things that can be done to prevent this, the
simplest seems to be to indent it.
