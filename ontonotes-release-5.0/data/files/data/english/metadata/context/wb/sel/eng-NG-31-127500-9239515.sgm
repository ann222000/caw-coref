Does this differ from the US-VISIT version of it?

This ain't nuthin' official, but I regularly use a couple of sources
inside Nyuukoku Kanrikyoku at Narita and KIX.  According to one of the
people there who is at the &quot;stands in the background and appears to make
decisions&quot; level, if you have your torokusho and passport in your hand
and you talk back to the rent-a-pig that will try to shoo you into the
&quot;Visitor&quot; line in Wa-go, the unwritten rule is to leave you alone and
let you through as an honorary human being instead of a foreign animal.
Besides, they've already got your photo and fingerprint at your
kuyakusho.

Of course, some of the people there do not understand the level of
suckiness of that video.  Them that do say it was done in Kasumigaseki
by people who don't get out much but have a large budget that must be
wasted annually.  I'm trying to find out what prescription concoction
they shot that hakujin in the mondo ugly striped shirt full of as I
think I need some.

BTW, as long as we're on the subject of execrable video, have you ever
clicked on the *Manga: Ise Jingu* button at:

I made it through less than one full minute.  It will make you believe
that abortion is not legal enough.  I tripped over it while trying to
prep my five-year-old daughter for a visit so that she'd have a little
bit of background of what she was looking at besides wood buildings and
a fancy bridge ... and a horsie on certain days.  The kid thought the

That unwritten rule seems to have been in place for donks. Even if you
still have your passport and gaigin card in your pocket, brushing off
the I'm-here-to-help-you rentacop with &quot;I'm a resident with a re-entry
permit so I'm going to line up with the Japanese in the shorter
queues&quot; has always been simple. From November 23rd though, I'll have
to line up with the tourists (even APEC card holders will have to),
and since only Narita will have an automated gate for pre-registered
gaigin guests (ie permanent residents etc), will have to do so each
and every time I use Chubu, Osaka, and so on.

My understanding is that the &quot;Re-entry Permit&quot; signage at the airports
is already being removed in preparation for the change.

Exactly - so other than sucking up to Sepponia, what is the point of
fingerprinting and photographing permanent residents etc coming back
home from gaikokuland?

Fuck.

It's a good thing I planned my trip to the US this Christmas through Narita.

But goddammit, if I have to do this silly crap every time I COME HOME TO THE
COUNTRY I LIVE IN [emphasis mine], then why do I have permanent residency in the
first place? Hell, I don't even think the re-entry permit (I call it the &quot;gaigin
tax&quot; is a particularly sane idea, either.

According to my source ... and, again, it isn't anything official ...
keeping up the behavior of &quot;I'm just going home&quot; will get you left
alone.  The problem seems to be that the law allows them to have one
photo and fingerprint copy tied to your residence or one tied to your
visitor's entry, but not both.  They're hoping that if they employ lots
of Vogon poetry, screaming &quot;Resistance is useless&quot; a lot, you won't
notice or remember.

They also said that if you are with small children and a wife who are
all carrying their Japanese passports sending you to the other line will
look extremely mean spirited and they'd tend to avoid a confrontation.
They recommended carrying the smallest one and looking helpless, if
necessary.

I never let a little thing like that stand in the way of what I want to
do, but I have had years of playing spoiled foreigner and it hardly
seems like the time to give up.

The &quot;special conditions resident&quot; classification is supposed to be for
Koreans but, the way it is written in the guidelines, it can apply to
anyone who has been in Japan more than three years.  I am on spouse visa
#7 but I guess I could bite the bullet and go for permanent residence if
there was some incentive.

Oh, yeah, I almost forgot -- You won't have to be photographed or
fingerprinted if they clear you through Immigration at your private
business jet ...

The thing is, while I don't doubt a terrorist attack could happen in
Japan, what's the use of fingerprints after the terrorists have burnt
themselves to ashes?

Anyway, I wonder if they will insist on this after the number of
tourists drop.

I kinda doubt it. The &quot;blame&quot; will be placed somewhere else, just as
it has been in the US despite the cheap exchange rate and vacant hotel

If you've not gone yet, there's a restaurant in the shopping area
across from the naiku that has rather good tekonezushi. I go there
every time I visit the shrine. I can't remember the name, but if you
