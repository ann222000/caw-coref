Most places put Mercon/dextron in the power steering pump.  It is red in
color. But you can also buy power steering fluid which is clear.
If the only difference is color why doesn't the transmission fluid
bottles say can be used in power steering also?
If they are 100% the same why hasnt some company labeled it as for use
in transmissions and power steering?

My 1987 town car  had ps pump replaced, the fluid was clear but had a
green tint to it.  What does the green color mean?  If i had red
transmission fluid in it you could not detect the color like with clear
ps fluid.

They're not 100% the same, although to be honest I couldn't tell you
what the differences are.  They are *basically* the same, however.

I think a green tint generally denotes a mineral oil; check your manual
to see if it recommends some different type of fluid than normal.  It's
important to use the right type of fluid; practically any fluid will
work FOR A WHILE but you need to use the right type for the sake of all
the rubber components - they may not be compatible with any given fluid,
if it's not the one spec'd in the manual.

Which reminds me, I was going to flush the P/S in the Corrado...  I
think someone put regular P/S fluid in it when it's supposed to use the
Pentosin mineral oil stuff...

good luck,

nate

I don't know what you are referring to when you say "Most places..." but,
most REAL automotive shops use power steering fluid these days.

Because color is not the ONLY difference......

Were it the same, I'm sure some market-savvy company would, indeed, label
the same product for dual usage...

See above answer....

It means that the manufacturer dyed the fluid green....

Several years ago, GM starting specifying power steering fluid.  I kept
using ATF because
I didnt read the manual, and had to replace hoses and a PS pump.

Were the failures related?  I dont know.  Could be normal GM failure rates,
but from that
time on, if it says power steering fluid, that is what I use. (And I have
had no more failures)

My very strong suggestion would be to just follow the instructions in
your owners manual.  And be sure to flush the power steering system
periodically too.

Well, yes that is true.  But I don't understand your point.

Because FORD's are a different species

Nope, (close) not the same thing - some contain mineral oils and some do
not - you cannot use mineral oil in your automatic tranns

The slight green tint is for leak detection!

Color means nothing, unfortunately. Refer to your owners manual for the
correct type of fluid to use in the power steering system.

And its DEXRON, "dexTron" is not a word.

Not in all systems. ATF will weep right through the rubber components in
some systems (at best) or weaken the rubber until it false (at worst).
