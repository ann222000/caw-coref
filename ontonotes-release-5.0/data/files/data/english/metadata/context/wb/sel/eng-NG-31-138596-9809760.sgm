Nigeria's Oil Morass
Shell Takes $716 Million Charge After Attacks

By Steven Mufson

Friday, February 1, 2008; D01

After insurgents attacked a link to a key oil export terminal on the
Forcados River in Nigeria's Delta region in February 2006, it took a
year and a half for Royal Dutch Shell to make repairs and get part of
it running again. It took just two months for insurgents to shut it
down again.

The result: Just when oil-consuming countries want more high-quality
petroleum to cool off high oil prices, a group of insurgents in the
West African nation forced oil companies to stop pumping an average
of 475,000 barrels a day last year, and at times as much as 600,000
barrels a day.

Yesterday Royal Dutch Shell, the biggest foreign company in the
strife-torn Niger River Delta, said it would take a $716 million
charge against earnings largely because of the security situation
there. Industry sources say that in addition to the production
shutdown, about 435 miles of pipeline and thousands of barrels a day
of crude oil and condensates have been stolen. Much of the pipeline
has been used for pillars in house construction.

(High oil prices nonetheless bolstered Shell's worldwide earnings.
Profit was $8.7 billion in the fourth quarter, up 60 percent from the
comparable period a year ago, even though production dropped and
refining margins fell.)

With the exception of Saudi Arabia's spare production, Nigeria's
unpumped oil accounts for the biggest untapped capacity in the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets today
to review prices and supply. All indications from OPEC ministers and
diplomats point to no change in oil production, despite President
Bush's plea for more output during his visit to Saudi Arabia two
weeks ago.

In Nigeria's case, restricted production is not a matter of choice. A
group called the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta
(MEND) has been blowing up pipelines and attacking or kidnapping
foreign oil workers for several years, demanding that the companies
and Nigerian government share more revenues with the deeply
impoverished region. There is also a bitter history of environmental
disputes in the region with Shell and other oil companies.

The topography of the Niger Delta makes it hard to protect. It is an
area the size of England, mostly swamp, with about 1,000 wells and
3,750 miles of pipeline. Little progress has been made in
negotiations with the insurgents, and Nigeria's military has been
incapable of, or uninterested in, defeating them. Oil industry
sources say some Nigerian navy boats in the Delta sell insurgents
spare parts for their speedboats while ignoring illicit sales of
bargeloads of stolen oil to foreign tankers.

Fixing the situation does not seem like a high priority for the
Nigerian government, which keeps changing the person in charge of
negotiations and postponing summit talks.

&quot;It's one of the puzzling aspects,&quot; said Stephen Morrison, director
of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. &quot;If the Gulf of Mexico were in the condition of the Niger
Delta, or some portion of the gulf were in semi-permanent
Katrina-like condition with lots of guys with weapons running around
stealing things, it would be a political issue.&quot;

One reason for official inertia may be that with oil prices hovering
around $90 a barrel, the Nigerian government is flush with cash. Long
saddled with foreign debt, it has paid off its foreign creditors and
accumulated reserves of about $50 billion, according to the World
Bank.

Nonetheless, Nigeria's government is not paying its share of
joint-venture investments, another reason for Shell's charge against
earnings. In November at the OPEC summit in Riyadh, Odein Ajumogobia,
Nigeria's energy minister, said that &quot;the government clearly cannot
fund its portion.&quot; He said it had budgeted only $5 billion of the $9
billion it was supposed to invest in 2008.

Because Nigeria's government does not want outside mediators to help
negotiate with insurgents, oil companies are among the only ones
searching for solutions. Shell, for example, has hired several
hundred &quot;community liaison officers&quot; to help solve grievances. The
company has sent storage tanks and generators to 21 towns and
villages.

But some U.S. human rights groups say that some oil company payments
may simply fuel insurgent arms purchases. Last month, MEND advertised
ahead of time that it would attack an oil installation. In an e-mail
sent to reporters and others, it said: &quot;An attack on the Nigeria oil
industry that will cause an economic tsunami in the world oil markets
is imminent. This will herald the real emancipation of the Niger
Delta.&quot; An attack then took place on two pipelines, one for oil and
one for waste water, southwest of the town of Warri.

Now MEND is threatening to widen its targets to reach outside the
Delta -- perhaps to Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, or to oil
installations offshore, where Nigeria's pumps another 2.2 million
barrels of oil each day.

Oil industry sources say that MEND is really a coalition of smaller
armed bands, but there seem to be half a dozen or so groups outside
MEND's umbrella too. One example is the Niger Delta Vigilante
Movement, whose leader, Ateke Tom, attacked a hotel in Port Harcourt
on New Year's Day. In an interview with Newswatch, a Nigerian
magazine, Tom said he was retaliating because government troops
attacked and burned down his house and allegedly took $46,000 in
cash. He did not say why he was keeping that much cash on hand, but
he wanted it returned.

&quot;It's a difficult situation,&quot; said Ajumogobia, the energy minister.
&quot;There are complications from criminal elements that have infiltrated
the process and are trying to break the process.&quot;

He said that the government was going to triple its budget for the
Niger Delta. It currently gives 13 percent of oil revenues to the
governments of oil-producing states.

Analysts say that most of the money allotted for the Delta region
doesn't get there. The former governor of Delta state, James Ibori,
has been charged with 129 counts of money laundering and other
financial crimes. Human rights groups say Ibori provided key
financing for the campaign of President Umaru Yar'Adua last year and
that Ibori's influence was one reason why the president recently took
the country's top prosecutor off the job and sent him on a training
program.

A Human Rights Watch report last year reported that the $1.3 billion
for Rivers state had little impact on ordinary people. The governor
had a $65,000-a-day travel budget, the report said, and $92,000 a day
for &quot;grants,&quot; &quot;contributions&quot; and &quot;donations.&quot; One local government
spent 2 percent of its share on its crumbling primary school and 30
percent on its own salaries and offices. Another local chairman
claimed to have spent huge sums on projects, including a fish pond
with neither fish nor water.

&quot;There are a lot of opportunities for diversion and corruption,&quot; said
Monica Enfield, a West Africa analyst at PFC Energy, a Washington
consulting firm. &quot;So you have communities with no hospitals, roads or
schools, and that creates a lot of anger against the government and
the operating companies there.&quot;
