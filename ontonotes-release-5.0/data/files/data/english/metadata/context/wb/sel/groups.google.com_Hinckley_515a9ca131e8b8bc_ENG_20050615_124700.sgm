Ah well, glad to be back....... Did you hear.

TRAVELLERS FLEE AFTER BARRICADE

Travellers who invaded the new Â£4 million Hinckley United stadium,
fled after football fans started to barricade them in.

The convoy of French-Algerian travellers with 20 caravans took over the
training pitches at the side of the main pitch at Marston's stadium, in
Leicester Road.

Police had earlier moved the travellers from the new hospital site in
Ashby Road, Hinckley, a mile away.

The travellers' negotiator and translator offered the club money to be
allowed to stay for a few days.

However, club chairman Kevin Downes made it clear they were not wanted
on the pitch, where they train youth teams and use their clubhouse
function rooms for special events, such as weddings and concerts.

Mr Downes, the managing director of a building firm, said that at first
the travellers indicated they would stay anyway.

His solicitor said that he would have to take out an injunction, which
could take a week.

Mr Downes then started contacting workers and supporters, and indicated
that if the travellers did not move on immediately, the road into the
club would be blocked with bricks and rubble and they would be unable
to go in or out.

He said: &quot;I said I am a builder and have got machines and lorries. We
are demolishing a place in Derby Road at the moment and I told them I
would bring everything down here and they would be here until
Christmas.

&quot;The first wagon turned up and blocked a hole in the hedge where they
could have got out. When we started blocking the road off they started
to get a bit agitated.

&quot;About 10 or 15 of us went down and blocked them in with our vehicles.
We got 40 or 50 tonnes of rubbish down there, and the farmer opposite
was offering his slurry.

&quot;They asked if they could send a couple of vehicles to look for other
sites in the area. We said we would give them an hour, and after that
we wouldn't let them back into the site. They came back about an hour
and 15 minutes later, had a big pow-wow, and within 10 minutes they had
all revved up and moved off.&quot;

A spokesman for Leicestershire police said they were notified that the
travellers had moved on to Leicester Road at about 1.30pm on Friday.

She said: &quot;They moved on a few hours afterwards and were out of
Leicestershire by the evening. We attended to prevent a breach of the
peace.&quot;

Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council have moved skips into the car
park entrances of parks and beauty spots where traveller invasions have
taken place in the past, including Burbage Common and Stapleton Lane
Park, in Barwell.

Police in Somerset warned villagers not to gaze out of their windows
after gipsies on an illegal site complained their privacy was being
invaded.

The sergeant who phoned us said he'd received complaints from the
gipsies about us and that we should not inflame the situation by
looking out of our windowes.

Makes you think
