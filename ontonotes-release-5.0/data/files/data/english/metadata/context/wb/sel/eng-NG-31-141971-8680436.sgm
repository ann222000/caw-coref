There's no question that Hillary Clinton is a lot
more electable than Barack Hussein Obama (yes, that's
his given last name).  Personally, I liked her when I
conversed with her face-to-face, and like her now based
on her recent speeches and interviews.

And there's that secret . . .

thank you jai maharaj ji for your unique insight. hillary will thrash pretty
boy romney in 08. and then there will be a new new-world-order. at the
moment women are having to work twice as hard to earn a pay equal to men -
fortunately, it is not hard for women to do that since men put in hardly any
work worth mentioning. after 08 women will get 3 year paid leave upon
childbirth, free nationalized insurance (paid for by taxes from top 1 pct),
social security will be replenished with monies saved from annuling iraq
madness. defence will be slashed by 80pct to pay for free college education.
you will see, it will be like 60s all over again when the world will be one
peaceful family.

isn't it true, jai maharaj ji that the hindus too think the world is a
family? dr. dyer says it is.

Ask Jay Stevens what year Hillary WILL be assinated IF she gets elected.

Do you ever think for yourself, or is it just too much work?
