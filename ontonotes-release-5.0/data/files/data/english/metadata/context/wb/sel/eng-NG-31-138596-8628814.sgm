Give him creditUPDATED: 2007-08-18 01:23:16 MST

At 26, Douglas Idugboe is a true rags to riches story

By PAUL JACKSON

Eight years ago Douglas Idugboe arrived in Canada as a refugee from Nigeria with just $5 in his pocket and the very next day got a job as a factory worker in Montreal.     Now, he's already a millionaire, a successful real estate investor, a financial and marketing coach, and has a bestselling book on sale across the nation in stores such as Chapters, Indigo and Shoppers Drug Mart.      His book, Credit Miracle for Canadians (Quick Success Press, $24.95), explains how to get out of debt, build or repair your credit rating and &quot;make banks beg to loan you money.&quot;      The 23rd child of a 68-children African family -- one father, several mothers -- Idugboe, now still only 26, was driven to get out of poverty, and knew he could do that only by owning his own business.      But when he tried to borrow money, no bank or trust company would lend him a dime.   Perplexed, he decided to investigate how the credit system in North America worked.   With a quiet
thoroughness that is the hallmark of everything he does, even to his impeccable dress, he was soon being granted loans to invest in real estate.

When friends and acquaintances saw how well he was doing they kept coming to him for advice.      With that, he started giving courses in credit worthiness.      &quot;Soon, I had to turn people away from my courses because I had too many clients. Feeling sorry I couldn't help so many, I decided to write a book.&quot;      As before, he had to pound on many a door to get his book published and distributed nationwide.      &quot;I simply didn't want to self-publish and try to sell it on Amazon.com.&quot;   Persistence paid off when he found White Knight Book Distributors in Toronto.   &quot;The company president, Bill Belfontaine, read the book and uttered one word, 'Wow!' and that was it.      Idugboe, who gushes with enthusiasm, contends Canada is the best place in the world in which to start a small business, and his website www.creditmiracle.ca gets hundreds of hits every week.      &quot;To be successful in Canada is easy -- as long as you truly want to be successful. There are really three
motivators -- desperation, desire and determination.&quot;   With those prerequisites, insists Idugboe, you are on your way.

Introduction:
A beautiful initiative for the rebirth of Eminent Lectureships occurs at the Bells National Technology Fair, which was held between 5th and 6th of March 2007. The fair, which was organized by Bells University of Technology, Ota, Nigeria, in collaboration with Emerald Energy Resources Limited, had as its theme: ‘Energy and Technology Development’.
Such lectures aims at fostering mutual academic cooperation to undertaking collaborative research project with the initiative of the lecture; organizing joint conferences/seminars for informed technological and innovative debate; knowledge dissemination through joint publications and personal encounter; seeking outside funding sources for joint research activities; and exchanging publications brought out by the participating institutions
This article addresses the initiative to lectureship and its importance to staff and students in Nigeria universities. It explores the different ways university lectures by eminent persons in Nigeria goes about quality enhancement of the staff/students in Nigeria, enabling them to achieve their potential and contribute to the provision of excellent teaching and research in the University
The study include the acknowledgement of the crucial importance of improving staff quality and in keeping them current in their fields of expertise through lecture interactions, pointing out its importance in institutional survival and the need for universities to commit themselves to eminent persons in lectures
I hope other higher education institutions should draw their lessons from this initiative I reviewed here as an innovation strategy for individual and institutional development in Nigeria as we discuss what constitutes eminence in the eminent person, and what importance it is to the lectureship series in Nigeria University, using Bells University of Technology Ota as the brainstorming idea
In my university I construct an inquiry
Beyond a storyline cataloged by given headings
Amid challenge including of own evaluative testimonial
On the President of the Central Bank of my Naija land
I write this beyond mere summarizing facts
A review of more extensive testimony of research
To honor an eminent son in more complex content,
I write this in profiling a living individual
Lectureship that sorts fictions from facts
Prominence given to modern opinions
Amalgamate of data from the Banker of the Year,
(Omosun Sylvester oseremen, august 3rd 2007)
Initiative for Special Lectureship
In 2005 the Bells University of Technology Ota, under the leadership of the erstwhile Vice-chancellor; Professor Julius Ameobi Okojie, now the Executive Secretary of the National University Commission establishes a committee as an initiative to coordinate an annual lecture series in the University
One of the criteria in nominating persons for the lectureship is that the person must be eminent in their chosen field of research within the broad refines of Science, Technology and Medicine. The lecturer should be prepared to contribute to a seminar programme in other relevant area according to the vision of the University and shall allow publication of the lecture into the university journal/library collection
The lectures series which is to be annually is in line with the vision of the University, which is to discover, disseminate and apply the knowledge of Science and Engineering for Human well-being and Development of Society, the series will ensure that each department and college in the university nominate a person of choice for their lectureship in lieu with the ceremonial committee of the university.
This is because we wished to honor the lecturer as one of our more eminent person worth emulating by the future leaders (students/staff) we are nurturing and for the very major contribution the lecturer made to the field of Technology/economic development (our vision) throughout his working life
One of such lectureship series planned this year, 2007, under the leadership of the current Vice Chancellor, Professor Adeyemi, is an eminent person lecture; He suggested that a lecture be established whereby the University could nominate persons of note to address the Community. The lecture, which will be given annually by an eminent person who is professionally concerned with GROWTH initiative for the federal republic of Nigeria,
WHAT CONSTITUTE EMINENCE?
A champion, campaigner, genius, famous, successful, legendary, memorable, world-famous, well-known, notable, gifted, victor of Gold, role model in the field, top achiever, these are but few of the words that describe the eminence in a person
Professor Charles Soludo was nominated to be the first eminent person to be honored in such initiatives at the University because he has all the attribute of a person of eminence noted above
As Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) since May 2004, Prof. Soludo has embarked on ambitious reforms of the CBN and the entire financial sector. The most significant aspect of these reforms was the requirement for all the deposit money banks to raise their capital base to a minimum of N25 billion, and he achieve it within eighteen month
As the Chief Economic Advisor to President Obasanjo in 2003, Prof. Soludo coordinated Nigeria's economic and social reform program (2003-2007) - the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), which aided the debt relief for Nigeria. He was voted the world Central Bank Governor of the Year, 2006.
Global Central Banker of the Year
If this is a book I could list some hyperlinks to the online news stories, press releases, or other documents that support the claims made in the section above, and I could explain critically, why he is A champion, campaigner, genius, famous, successful and much more because I am a writer, but this review is not intended to write a great big book on this subject at this time; but to simply say something rather than nothing about what I witnessed yesterday, 3rd of August 2007, during the first eminent lecture at Bells University of Technology Ota,
Apart from being treated to a lovely meal at the Temperance Hotel, I had the opportunity of meeting some other notable son our country, who can only be seen in the presence of an eminent personality, it has been a long time since I have seen a very constructive assembly of advocate in a university lectureship in Nigeria
The past and present Secretary of the National University Commission were there, the erstwhile president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was there, Registrars, Deans, and Vice-Chancellors of different universities were there, It was such a brilliant crops of eminent people, this experience show of what we can achieve with faith in God and country through the synchronization of diverse groups of people and intellectuals.
The Laborers from the adjacent field, traders, school students, and a host of others were not left out, everyone got four copies Professor Soludo published Journals free, also including August 2007 edition of the TELL Magazine(special publication), highlighting the FSS strategy, (the Financial System strategy), Businessday newspaper and NEEDS
University community sometimes missed an opportunity to be identified with such an eminent person, who achieve quiet such extraordinary initiative within month, I am privileged to have played a part on the successful hosting of the lecture, that featured this person of note and granting of a plaque to him in honor of his eminence, and I extend all thanks to God and to the university ceremonial committee for a job well done, I am proud to have been there
I want to compose a final letter to the world
Biographical chart and map of traveled of the famous person
I will exemplify the notable's life in history
And record an interview with the notable
Till you Judge why history includes me
As I seek the autograph of your eminence
Study a gallery of my paintings
Judge if they are not worth a review
My writings assemble an album of memorabilia
Of the eminent person's life and achievements
Drawing a map of a famous person's travels
Like artifacts demonstrating the notable's achievements
PART TWO
HIS EMINENCE
A young student in awe asks
Am I worthy to shake his eminence hand?
And in response he got a hug
Therein lies the inspiration that money cannot buy
Another review and in response
Assemble and survey images of great personalities
Colour in outlines of the famous faces in his book
And suddenly like a dream
His eminence came to tell him he is but human
A staff composes a scrapbook of the famous people
He photograph memorabilia of a famous person
Represent locations of the achievements of the famous
Then like a dream his eminence came to tell him
That his achievement too is but notable
TO BE CONTINUED
