Jews and Arabs are 'genetic brothers'
BBC

Jewish heritage has been maintained

They may have their differences but Jews and Arabs share a common
genetic heritage that stretches back thousands of years.

The striking similarities in their biology have just been revealed in
a study of over 1,300 men in almost 30 countries worldwide.

Scientists compared the men's Y chromosomes, the tiny structures
within cells that carry the genetic instructions that tell a
developing foetus to become a boy.

The comparison also showed that Jews have successfully resisted having
their gene pool diluted, despite having lived among non-Jews for
thousands of years in what is commonly known as the Diaspora - the
time since 556 BC when Jews migrated out of Palestine.

Genetic signatures

Throughout human history, alterations have occurred in the sequence of
chemical bases that make up the DNA in the Y chromosome, leaving
variations that can be pinpointed with modern genetic techniques.

Related populations carry the same specific variations. In this way,
scientists can track descendants of large populations and determine
their common ancestors.

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, found that Jewish men shared a common set of genetic
signatures with non-Jews from the Middle East, including Palestinians,
Syrians, and Lebanese.

These signatures were significantly different from non-Jewish men
outside of the Middle East. This means Jews and Arabs have more in
common with each other, genetically speaking, than they do with any of
the wider communities in which they might live.

Good opportunity

Dr Mark Jobling of Leicester University, UK, one of the authors of the
new study, told the BBC: &quot;The kind of DNA we have used to analyse this
question is the human Y chromosome. This represents only 2% of our
genetic material and it is passed down from father to son.

&quot;This makes it particularly interesting to use in a study of Jewish
populations because Jewishness is passed down from the mother to
children - it is maternally inherited. So using a paternally inherited
piece of DNA gives us a good opportunity to see the signal of mixture
with other populations if this has occurred.

&quot;The fact that we don't see it suggests that after the Diaspora these
populations really have managed to maintain their Jewish heritage.

Dr Jobling dismissed the idea that the study could have any political
implications. &quot;It seems that in many of these situations where groups
are in conflict with each other they are likely to be pretty much
genetically indistinguishable, and this factor, to the peoples
involved in these conflicts, clearly isn't the point and isn't likely
to change their behaviour very much.&quot;

That is why Jews never built their own society, but have historically
always leeched off of others and have been dependent completely upon
the grace of other societies as Israelis do today off the US.    The
wandering Hebrew tribes were nomadic gypsies, tramps and thieves who
wore out their welcome in every society that allowed them to take
advantage of the civilization that Jews were incapable and too lazy to
build for themselves.     For a band of Gypsies to claim a land that
was lived on and cultivated for centuries by Palestinians is
absolutely laughable.   They even have the nerve to claim the city of
Jebus that was built by the indigenous population as their capitals,
when it wasn't even built by Jews and only conquered and controlled by
them for a very short period of history.

THE NEAREST TO PALESTINIANS AND ARABS.  WESTERN JEWS WILL MATCH
GERMANS, AUSTRIANS, ENGLISH, AND RUSSIANS.  AMERICAN JEWS WOULD BE A

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; their common ancestors.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sciences, found that Jewish men shared a common set of genetic
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; signatures with non-Jews from the Middle East, including
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Palestinians,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Syrians, and Lebanese.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; These signatures were significantly different from non-Jewish men
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; outside of the Middle East. This means Jews and Arabs have more in
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; common with each other, genetically speaking, than they do with any
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the wider communities in which they might live.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Good opportunity

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dr Mark Jobling of Leicester University, UK, one of the authors of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; new study, told the BBC: &quot;The kind of DNA we have used to analyse
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; question is the human Y chromosome. This represents only 2% of our
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; genetic material and it is passed down from father to son.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;This makes it particularly interesting to use in a study of Jewish
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; populations because Jewishness is passed down from the mother to
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; children - it is maternally inherited. So using a paternally
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; inherited
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; piece of DNA gives us a good opportunity to see the signal of mixture
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with other populations if this has occurred.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The fact that we don't see it suggests that after the Diaspora these
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; populations really have managed to maintain their Jewish heritage.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dr Jobling dismissed the idea that the study could have any political
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; implications. &quot;It seems that in many of these situations where groups
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; are in conflict with each other they are likely to be pretty much
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; genetically indistinguishable, and this factor, to the peoples
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; involved in these conflicts, clearly isn't the point and isn't likely
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to change their behaviour very much.&quot;

&gt; Which is extremely surprising.

&gt;&gt; &gt; the Ayrabs are dune monkeys who were late arrivals to the area..

&gt;&gt; The Jews were a wandering nomadic group that never took roots, until
&gt;&gt; after they forcibly left ancient Egypt. Arabs were firmly planted in
&gt;&gt; the Sinai and in parts of the Babylonian empire before the Jews wore
&gt;&gt; out their welcome in the Pharaoh's Egyptian court.

&gt; I think you should read up your history. The Arabs were fairly late

I think you should read up on your history Bernie. What you are reading is
Israeli-Jew propaganda. Like I told William Black, your lack of education is
showing.... Take a few courses in Western Civ. on a college level and then
spout that horseshit in your classroom. I bet your professor will correct
you straightaway.

Don't take my word for it, sign-up for a Western Civ. course ASAP.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jewish heritage has been maintained

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; They may have their differences but Jews and Arabs share a common
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; genetic heritage that stretches back thousands of years.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The striking similarities in their biology have just been revealed in
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a study of over 1,300 men in almost 30 countries worldwide.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Scientists compared the men's Y chromosomes, the tiny structures
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; within cells that carry the genetic instructions that tell a
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; developing foetus to become a boy.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The comparison also showed that Jews have successfully resisted
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; having
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; their gene pool diluted, despite having lived among non-Jews for
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; thousands of years in what is commonly known as the Diaspora - the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; time since 556 BC when Jews migrated out of Palestine.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Genetic signatures

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Throughout human history, alterations have occurred in the sequence
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; chemical bases that make up the DNA in the Y chromosome, leaving
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; variations that can be pinpointed with modern genetic techniques.

&gt; That is why Jews never built their own society, but have historically
&gt; always leeched off of others and have been dependent completely upon
&gt; the grace of other societies as Israelis do today off the US.    The
&gt; wandering Hebrew tribes were nomadic gypsies, tramps and thieves who
&gt; wore out their welcome in every society that allowed them to take
&gt; advantage of the civilization that Jews were incapable and too lazy to
&gt; build for themselves.     For a band of Gypsies to claim a land that
&gt; was lived on and cultivated for centuries by Palestinians is
&gt; absolutely laughable.   They even have the nerve to claim the city of
&gt; Jebus that was built by the indigenous population as their capitals,
&gt; when it wasn't even built by Jews and only conquered and controlled by
&gt; them for a very short period of history.
