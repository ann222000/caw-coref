Honey is the nature's gift to mankind. It is a pleasant food item having
acquired of special reputation as medicine and as a nutritious food. Honey
is a golden coloured syrupy substance made by bees from the nectar of
flowers. The quality of honey depends on the prevailing flower blossom.
Genuine honey will contain pollen grains, which can be detected under
microscope. Glucose, starch, and cane sugar usually adulterate honeys that
are available commercially.

Honey is healthier compared to refined sugar since honey has traces of
minerals and vitamins to its credit. Honey contains fewer calories and
carbohydrates than sugar since it contains water. But when substituting
honey for sugar in recipes, due to the high density of honey compared to
sugar, substituting honey for sugar by volume rather than by weight would
give you more calories. Honey contains sugars in the form of glucose and
fructose that gives the sweetness. The clearer the honey the higher the
proportion of fructose although, honey will almost always granulate if it is
kept long enough. Heating can make it loose. Honey consists of 20% water and
about 79% sugar. Honey contains glucose 25- 37%, fructose 34- 43%, sucrose
0.5- 3% maltose5-12%, and 319 kcal per 100 gms.
