Hi all,

I recently posted some info regarding the NAFTA Super Highway and I enjoyed
reading your responses.  While the original article I posted may have been
some conspiracy theorist's own take on the situation, I've pretty much come
to the conclusion that it is in fact in the works.

So, now I have a related situation to share.  Yesterday I found out that the
Mexican family living in the other half of my twin home, has at least one
illegal immigrant.  We suspected since they moved in earlier this year, that
there was something fishy going on over there but we had no proof.

The night before last, one of them was pulled over by a state cop right in
front of our house for failing to signal for a turn.  When asked for license
and registration etc.,  he had none.  His registration was expired, his
insurance was expired and he had no license to drive in ANY state or
country.  He told the cop he's been in PA for three years and has no working
papers, green card etc.

So, what happened to him you ask?  He got a ticket for the traffic violation
and that's it.  They didn't impound the car and he was driving it again
yesterday.

The family has at least three adult males, an adult female (who is pregnant
with their fourth child), the three small children and on the weekends,
there are always lots more coming and going.

They have about five or six cars and park them on the lawn, and in the
street in front of everyone else's homes. Our street has terrible parking so
each home only has one spot in the driveway and then usually we can park in
the spot directly in front of our house but since they have so many cars,
there's never any place to park.  Of course, that in itself is not illegal,
just rude and inconsiderate.  They also have been seen numerous times,
switching the license plates back and forth between the vehicles.

They leave trash all over their front lawn which blows over to mine.  I
sometimes find trash in my back yard too like old cigars and stuff which I
throw back over.  They don't pay for trash service so we've been trying to
figure out what they've been doing with their trash.  Well a few weeks ago
we found out.  My husband was putting our trash out and saw one of the men
walking down the sidewalk like he was going to put their trash into our
trash bin but he saw my husband watching and walked away.  So, I guess we
and the neighbors have been paying for their trash removal.

Their children (all under the age of 6 I would say) are always running
around the neighborhood with no one watching them and leaving their bikes
lying on the sidewalk.  In fact, I hit one the other day (a bike that is,
not a kid) because they had left it lying down right in my driveway and I
didn't see it when I looked in my rearview mirror.  Of course I was going
very slowly because I never know when one of the kids will dart out so it
didn't do any damage.)

When they first moved in, the first thing they did was to paint the brick
facade on the front of the house BRIGHT RED with white over the grout.  It
looks like that stupid fake brick cardboard background they use at the mall
for Christmas displays.  Good luck to us if we ever want to sell our half of
the house unless we sell it to another bunch of Mexicans.

So, after finding out that at least one of them is definitely illegal, I
spent a lot of time making calls yesterday and explaining the situation over
and over.  I got off the phone feeling like I had been banging my head
against the wall.  I started at our local boro police; they can't do
anything.  The state police; they can't do anything.  The district
attorney's office; they can't do anything.  The ONLY department that has the
authority to arrest and/ or deport this guy is the immigration office and
they won't do anything because a residency issue and a simple traffic
violation are not deportable offenses.

It doesn't matter that just by simply BEING HERE, he is breaking the law!
He has to be selling drugs or killing people before they'll do anything.

I am beyond frustrated by the stupidity of our federal government.  The
police all say their hands are tied and they are just as frustrated as I am.
I can't believe that we are paying taxes and these immigrants come here and
take advantage of all the wonderful opportunities we have for OUR citizens.

They could put up a big sign on the front lawn that says, &quot;WE'RE ILLEGAL&quot;
and nothing would happen to them.  Meanwhile, they keep having more kids to
anchor them to the US and use our public school system and our health care
services without contributing anything.

So....that was my day, how was yours?

That is SO frustrating and makes me want to hurl. The word ILLEGAL
should bring out the forces in droves. I can't believe no one can or
will do anything to help you. I don't consider myself a prejudice
person and if someone comes into this country the legal way and does
their best to obey the laws, be considerate to their neighbors and is
just trying to make a better life for themselves - hey, go for it. But
in this case I can't find one redeeming quality about your neighbors -
it's like they're shoving this right in your face because they know
they can get away with it.
I pray that someone steps up to the plate and rectifys this situation.

This is all irrelavant, as this could happen with any neighbor, illegal or

they were good neighbors?

I'm sure it happens but how the heck should I know why the cop really pulled
him over?  I'm just telling you what the cop said to the guy.  He failed to
signal.  His car might be considered &quot;conspicuous&quot; looking since it's spray
painted blue with a big vent hole cut in the hood and a really loud exhaust
system.  Plus, the cops were just at their house the previous day regarding
another of their cars that had no license plate.

Sure, it could happen in any neighborhood but previously, our neighbors had
always taken turns with us mowing our shared lawns and allowing each other
to park in front of our respective homes etc.  Just common courtesy.  Of
course, I care that they are illegal.  That was the whole point of my post
and the rest of the details were to give an idea of what it's like to live
next to this particular family.

I have no problem with people who are here legally from other countries and
have become citizens or are in the process of it.  In fact, there are two
very nice Chinese ladies across the street that I exchange kids clothes and
toys with and another lady from Turkey whose husband is serving in the US
military in Bahrain right now so I've been trying to help her get familiar
with the neighborhood.

My husband and I also have a good friend whose father is Mexican.  Perhaps
in my frustration about my situation, it came across that it is just
Mexicans with whom I am frustrated but that was not my intent so I apologize
for that.

My grandparents were legal immigrants and they worked hard to become US
citizens.  So much so, that they rarely spoke of their own country and my
father didn't learn their language or about his heritage because he wanted
to fit in at school and be more &quot;American&quot;.  This is not the attitude of
most illegal immigrants today, in my opinion.

I'm sorry for that and I apologized above.  I was (and still am) very upset
with the situation.  Although, if none of what I posted would bother you,
I'll send the next group of &quot;visitors&quot; from my neighbor's house over to
yours, OK?

I think the point is, what if they are legal US citizens?  Would that
make it OK for them to be jerks?  Or the other way around.  What if
they are great neighbors?  Would that make it OK for them to be
illegals?

You get your points confused.  Whether they are great neighbors or not
has nothing to do with whether they are legal or not, and true the
other way around.

Even if they are bad neighbors?  You'd have no problems with them?

&gt; My grandparents were legal immigrants and they worked hard to become US

Bottom line, there has always been illegal immigrants as long as there
is unequal economics.  And there will always be illegal immigrants.
This is not just the US.  Europe has huge illegal immigrant
populations.  Many Asian countries do, so do many African countries,

unequal economies exist.  People from poor countries will always
strife to better their lots in life, often by moving to a more
prosperous country.  And people in more prosperous countries will
always &quot;tolerate&quot; illegal immigrants because they provide a cheap
source of human capital.

Me!!!!     It was BS.    This was back in a college town at 10pm.  The road
had construction on it and the two lanes were merging into one, I had no
choice but to change lanes.   The cop pulled me over for failing to put a
signal on when changing lanes.  He followed me from  my workplace which
happened to be a bar.

FWIW, I didn't get a ticket.  I'm sure it had nothing to do with my skimpy
cocktail outfit that I had on.LOL

While what she described isn't necessarily true of all illegal

racism, it's just stating the facts of what's happening in our country
due to millions of poor, unskilled, uneducated Mexicans pouring across
our borders onto the red carpet laid out to them by way too many
politicians.

I live in Los Angeles so all this stuff is now just a fact of life.
The mayor here has shown time and time again that his is pro-illegal,
going as far as showing up at some of their raliies and saying stuff
like &quot;we clean your toilets&quot;.  Yeah, that really makes me feel like
he's got my interests at heart.  Then again, he also recently showed

over 60 charges of rape and sexual assault, so it's probably more that

There's no need to apologize.  The overwhelming majority of illegal
aliens in our country are Mexican so there's really no way to have a
discussion about illegals without talking about Mexicans as well.

Which is why those of us who are so against it are constantly called
racist, because you simply cannot have a negatively toned conversation

Hell, even Mexico's illegal immigration policies are enforced more
often and more severely than ours are.  The may not care who's coming
in from the US, but they sure as hell care about who's coming in from
the Central America side.

BS. Like I have said elsewhere, this posts content is 90% about how bad of
neighbors Mexicans are. Because the OP believes they are illegal, the OP
feels that gives a pass to make such stereotypical comments.

He/she probably doesn't even have Mexican neighbors. This post has TROLL

Add that's part of the problem - Why is the local enforcement of
illegal immigration a 'Federal Issue&quot;?
IMO the Feds are way over-reaching on this one - what the heck does
Ted Kennedy know about the illegal immigration issues in Brownsville,
Texas?  When was the last time any of these Political Princes and
Princesses on either side of the isle left their Congressinoal Palaces
to spend any amount of time along any of these Southern US Border
cities that are being ravished as if set upon by swarms of locusts?
And why not simply put the issue up to an American People vote?  Poll
after poll show the issue of illegal immigration as the Top or in the
Top Two issues of most concern by the American public - yet all we
poor unwashed peons recieve for our 50%'ish taxes is lip service.

I say the whole bunch of congress and the President should be thrown
out of office immediately for failure to do their jobs of protecting
the nation's borders.

What kind of training, expertise, and resources are required to ask

&gt; &gt; by sneaking around and, once here, taking advantage of the Good 'ol
&gt; &gt; U.S. of A.  A lot of them are criminals, slobs, losers and they are
&gt; &gt; ruining it for the people who give a rat's ass. So if that is being a
&gt; &gt; racist then I will stand and admit to it.

&gt; Her post was simply an opportunity to reinforce the racial stereotypes
&gt; associated with Mexicans. How good of neighbors they are have nothing to do
&gt; with them being Mexican, nor does it have anything to do with them being
&gt; illegal.-
">

You're right - I understand that. In fact we have a couple of
neighbors that I could do without. They certainly aren't as irritating
as Alida's but they are big slobs - their house is rotting away in
parts and they throw all kinds of crap out on the side of their house
and this crap will often blow over into our yard. They are just
&quot;regular&quot; American folk - not Mexican, not illegal etc. But they are
annoying. I've often thought about &quot;reporting&quot; them for stuff but in
the interest of not making enemies we try and tolerate.

&quot;That point has always driven me crazy -&quot; because it's rubbish,
fille.  A BS talking point spread by self-serving politicians, civic
groups, and corps, who benefit from a dirt cheap labor force.  What it
says is that Americans are too lazy to work for their own country - I
say, &quot;Bull&quot;.  Even the U.N. admitted, through recent research, that;
from: http://archives.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/trends/08/30/ilo.study/
[Lawrence Jeff Johnson -- the chief labor market economist who has
led the ILO team in producing its new &quot;Key Indicators of the Labor
Market 2001-2002&quot; study -- also says American workers are, per person,
more productive than their counterparts in other countries.]

It's just crap that America has to put up with rampant illegal
immigration in order to fill low-earning less skilled jobs - not to
mention (ahem) illegal.

What many of the illegal alien supporters fail to acknowledge when
spewing this rhetoric are the billions of U.S. dollars that would be
*gained* in U.S. infrastructure, medical care, education, law
enforcement, etc. without the illegal alien problem - and The Biggie?
- &quot;remittance&quot;.  Depending on the source, American dollars practically
flowing back across the border, are depending on the report, Mexico's
No.1 or No.2 source of national revenue - can you believe that?
American dollars getting sent to Mexico is that third world country's
Top 1|2 source of revenue?

Rather than sneaking into America and having rallies to change
America's Immigration procedures - those pinheads should be doing the
same in Mexico.

&gt;&gt; Same old fucking kneejerk reaction, pulling the racism card.

&gt; BS. Like I have said elsewhere, this posts content is 90% about how bad of
&gt; neighbors Mexicans are. Because the OP believes they are illegal, the OP
&gt; feels that gives a pass to make such stereotypical comments.

&gt; He/she probably doesn't even have Mexican neighbors. This post has TROLL
&gt; written all over it.

The only TROLL that is here is you.  I most certainly do have illegal
neighbors (who happen to be Mexican).  My comments were not made just to be
stereotypical.  My neighbors happen to actually fit most of the sterotypes
that are made about Mexicans.  It's not my fault if the stereotypes are true
in this case.  You think I'm a racist?  Fine, think whatever you like.

I'm pissed off that my elected officials are not doing their jobs.  I'm
pissed off that people can come here illegally from ANY country and receive
a free education, free health care, own a business, etc. ALL on MY taxes.

The state and local police are supposed to uphold all federal laws but they
don't because, in the case of illegal immigration, they are not getting any
support.  There are only about 2,000 Immigration officers for the whole
country.  Not quite enough when there are approximately 12 MILLION illegal
immigrants here.  In fact, when the local or state police do arrest illegal
immigrants, they are being told to let them go most of the time unless they
are committing other more serious CRIMES (besides being here illegally in
the first place).

I don't believe for one minute that we NEED all of these illegal immigrants
to do jobs that Americans won't.  That's total crap.  My mom just recently
went back to work after not being in the work force for over 20 years.  She
has no current jobs skills and knows absolutely nothing about computers so
she is doing the housekeeping for a department store.  She's cleaning
toilets and vaccuuming. Is that a great job?  Of course not but she wanted
to work, it's a job she can do and she's getting paid.

We have a LEGAL means for people to come here but they choose to ignore and
violate our laws by coming here anyway.  Why should they be rewarded?  Why
do they deserve my sympathy?  They don't.

People like you are the reason that this is happening. Your indifference and
complacency is repugnant.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I do wonder about the character though of those people who would

&gt;&gt; &gt; grass cut, thier houses cleaned, their kids watched, and their outside
&gt;&gt; &gt; dishes washed, just to save a few dollars; pretty greedy, and down
&gt;&gt; &gt; right low IMO.

&gt;&gt; That point has always driven me crazy - &quot;illegal aliens are just doing
&gt;&gt; the jobs that we Americans don't want&quot; - says who? I don't think it's
&gt;&gt; beneath *every* American to clean toilets, mow lawns, babysit etc.
&gt;&gt; There are a LOT of people that aren't qualified to work the suit and
&gt;&gt; tie jobs but still want to work. They would readily accept &quot;any&quot; job
&gt;&gt; at times when there are bills to pay and mouths to feed. I've had my
&gt;&gt; share of these crappy jobs but, for me, it was more honorable to take
&gt;&gt; one of them and make an honest living rather than rob a bank, sell
&gt;&gt; dope or beat up an elderly person and swipe their pocketbook.

&gt; &quot;That point has always driven me crazy -&quot; because it's rubbish,
&gt; fille.  A BS talking point spread by self-serving politicians, civic
&gt; groups, and corps, who benefit from a dirt cheap labor force.  What it
&gt; says is that Americans are too lazy to work for their own country - I
&gt; say, &quot;Bull&quot;.  Even the U.N. admitted, through recent research, that;
&gt; from: http://archives.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/trends/08/30/ilo.study/
&gt;   [Lawrence Jeff Johnson -- the chief labor market economist who has
&gt; led the ILO team in producing its new &quot;Key Indicators of the Labor
&gt; Market 2001-2002&quot; study -- also says American workers are, per person,
&gt; more productive than their counterparts in other countries.]

&gt; It's just crap that America has to put up with rampant illegal
&gt; immigration in order to fill low-earning less skilled jobs - not to
&gt; mention (ahem) illegal.

&gt; What many of the illegal alien supporters fail to acknowledge when
&gt; spewing this rhetoric are the billions of U.S. dollars that would be
&gt; *gained* in U.S. infrastructure, medical care, education, law
&gt; enforcement, etc. without the illegal alien problem - and The Biggie?
&gt; - &quot;remittance&quot;.  Depending on the source, American dollars practically
&gt; flowing back across the border, are depending on the report, Mexico's
&gt; No.1 or No.2 source of national revenue - can you believe that?
&gt; American dollars getting sent to Mexico is that third world country's
&gt; Top 1|2 source of revenue?

&gt; Rather than sneaking into America and having rallies to change
&gt; America's Immigration procedures - those pinheads should be doing the
&gt; same in Mexico.
">

I totally agree. I think I read an estimate of between 4 and 5 billion
dollars a year being wired back to Mexico.  Is there a source that would
show what it costs the average American in additional school taxes and
higher health care etc. by having these illegal immigrants here?

I also don't believe the statement that we can't actually arrest and deport
all the illegal immigrants because it would cost too much or we don't have
the manpower etc.  Well, we wouldn't have to do that because if we started
enforcing the laws we have in place right now.  A lot of the illegal
immigrants would leave on their own for fear of being caught if they saw the
law being enforced.

Right now in OK, that is what's happening.  The governor passed a law that
employers can't hire illegal immigrants, people can't transport them to or
from the jobs, landlords can't rent to them etc.  The law is going into
effect in a few weeks and they already had approximately 20,000 illegal
immigrants leave.  They are pulling their kids out of school and selling
their homes.  AZ has a similar bill that is scheduled to be voted on in
January but I think that one is being fought and may not pass.

There is something seriously wrong with the thought processes of anyone who
thinks that criminals should be rewarded for their crimes and given
preferential treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Houston has been declared a &quot;sanctuary city&quot; so police are not even

&gt;&gt;&gt; to ask for ID when Mexican illegals are (illegally) gathered en masse in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lowe's parking lot waiting for their ride to their day laborer jobs - in
&gt;&gt;&gt; fact they're instructed to just drive on by.

&gt;&gt; Sanctuary city or not, why would local police enforce federal laws?

&gt; The US constitution *mandates* that federal law be enforced by local
&gt; authorities.

&gt;&gt; They are not trained to do so, and have no expertise or resource to
&gt;&gt; check ID's.

The local and state police are supposed to enforce ALL laws but if the
police feel they need more training to handle immigration violations, there
is a program called 287(g) through ICE which allows them to gain the
expertise for those situations.   I've already forwarded information about
the training program to my local and state police.  I suggest that you do
the same if you feel it could be helpful in your hometown or state.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I know exactly how you feel, BOH - I had to wait for over 6 hours in an
&gt;&gt;&gt; emergency room for them to set my broken wrist while dozens of Mexicans
&gt;&gt;&gt; were
&gt;&gt;&gt; treated for minor illnesses (a typical patient was like the one on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; bed
&gt;&gt;&gt; next to me when I finally did get taken back to the treatment room - a
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; year old, who didn't speak English, who was treated for a sore throat
&gt;&gt;&gt; and a
&gt;&gt;&gt; fever of 101.

&gt;&gt; You know they are illegal because you checked their ID's?  Or because
&gt;&gt; they are not white and therefore must be illegals?

&gt; I knew they were illegals because they couldn't speak English, which I
&gt; believe is required in order to pass a citizenship test?
&gt; http://www.usimmigrationsupport.org/citizenship_application.html You'll
&gt; notice that the second bullet reads &quot;The ability to read, write and speak
&gt; English&quot;.  Both parents and child had to have an Hispanic nurse translate
&gt; to the doctor what they were saying.  And YAY for the Hispanic nurse who
&gt; became a citizen and is working *LEGALLY* in our country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Our ERs are being used like free clinics and our school
&gt;&gt;&gt; teachers are so busy teaching English to the children of illegal aliens
&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; they don't have time to teach American children to read or write or add!

&gt;&gt; First people complain because immigrants don't speak English.  Now you
&gt;&gt; complain because the schools are teaching them English.  Can't win.

&gt; I'm complaining because the children who already speak English - both
&gt; native born and legal immigrants - are being ignored in the classroom
&gt; while the children of illegal immigrants are taught English.  I would have
&gt; *NO* problem with a separate class specifically for the purpose of
&gt; teaching the children of legal immigrants English, but taking away vital
&gt; resources (access to emergency rooms, education, etc.) from citizens in
&gt; order to accomodate people who are in our country illegally is ridiculous!
">

I agree totally.  The burden should be on the illegal immigrants to learn
English on their own not on the public school system.  As I mentioned in one
of my previous posts, my father was the son of legal immigrants and they had
to learn English on their own time.  They didn't have free classes.

It's pure, free-market capitalism, just simply trying to cut costs.
Blame the economic conservatives who think that businesses should be
able to freely maximize profits with as little government oversight as
possible.

Because of the history of our political parties, it's created an

economically conservative (and thus, pro-business, pro-capitalism,
pro-free market, small government, etc.) but also socially
conservative (in favor of government enforcement of social
homogeneity).  Democrats are reversed (in favor of expanding
government regulation of business and in favor of increasing social
diversity).

And that's why nothing will ever really get done on the issue.  The
pro-business Republicans and the pro-diversity Democrats work together
to keep illegal immigrants ingrained in our society, both economically
and socially.  Until either party breaks apart, expect to hear a lot
of empty rhetoric with nothing significant actually getting done.  A
wall along the border is not going to be built; millions of illegal

occasional business will be raided here and there, businesses as a

First off, I am a Libertarian isolationist. You won't find many people who

as a matter of fact, I stated that I previously agreed with you on that part

However, your post could have done without the &quot;back-story&quot; as it was

You're right - but I don't feel it's very productive for the
legislative branch to create laws opposing illegal immigration on one
hand, then create laws favorable to illegal immigration on the other -
not only is it non-productive, it goes against the vast majority of
what the American people have repeatedly stated they want; the
stopping of the current wave of illegal immigration.  But again, you

South America and Mexico - *legally* -before &quot;settling&quot; down in

The cause of their fear is irrelevant.  Whether you have sympathy for

employers value that fear.  A fearful workforce is a cheap,

Yes they should.  But good luck getting any Congress and any President
to pass serious sanctions against the people who helped finance their
election wins.  Neither side of the aisle has any real interest in
pissing off businesses, so you're never going to see Democrats or
Republicans passing any serious penalties against businesses that

immigrants.

With respect to illegal immigration, nowhere, really.  Which is the
point.  Illegal immigration is, ultimately, a non-issue in the grand
scheme of national politics.  Our status quo is not going to change to
any significant degree, whether we vote for Republicans or Democrats.
As long as our country remains a two-party system, and as long as our
two parties maintain their current ideologies, we will never have a
Congress that will pass strict enough penalties against businesses,
and we will never have a President who will enforce immigration law to
a point where it would actually matter.

But the parties *want* us to argue about illegal immigration, so that
we will choose sides, and support one party over the other on other
issues.  So they will keep up the rhetoric, but in the long run,
nothing will really change.

Our current political system is not designed for doing what is right
or what is best for anyone except the Democratic Party and the
Republican Party.  The whole system is pitched towards the two parties
keeping an ever-tightening stranglehold on our country, with their
rabid pawns pulling the noose tighter and tighter with every &quot;wedge
issue&quot; the parties come up with to whip the nation into a frenzy.

And as long as they keep us fed, the average American isn't going to
do anything about it.

&gt;&gt; Houston has been declared a &quot;sanctuary city&quot; so police are not even allowed
&gt;&gt; to ask for ID when Mexican illegals are (illegally) gathered en masse in the
&gt;&gt; Lowe's parking lot waiting for their ride to their day laborer jobs - in
&gt;&gt; fact they're instructed to just drive on by.

&gt;Sanctuary city or not, why would local police enforce federal laws?
&gt;They are not trained to do so, and have no expertise or resource to
&gt;check ID's.  Besides, kicking out illegals would severely impact the
&gt;lifestyle of Houstonians, who rely on illegals to clean their houses,
&gt;watch their kids, mow their lawns, and wash their dishes at
&gt;restaurants.
">

The Houstonians would survive.  In fact, I'll bet it would be quite
easy for them to find legal citizens to do the exact same jobs.
Somehow restaurants managed to provide us with clean dishes even
before the wave of illegal Mexicans came over.

&gt;You know they are illegal because you checked their ID's?  Or because
&gt;they are not white and therefore must be illegals?

Because it's common sense.  You may not know which ones are legal and
which ones aren't, but I can guarantee you that an ER full of
Mexicans, in a state that borders Mexico, is filled with a high
percentage of illegals.  Which is why so many hospitals have shut down
over the past decade, because they're forced to provide emergency care
to people who have no intent of ever paying.  You can just ignore the
facts and cry racism, but that doesn't change the fact that they ARE
facts.

&gt;First people complain because immigrants don't speak English.  Now you
&gt;complain because the schools are teaching them English.  Can't win.

Sure you can win.  You make speaking English a condition of attending
that school.  Why should the American students' education be
compromised to cater to illegals?  Lord knows they're already getting
an inferior enough education as it is.

&gt;There are a LOT of people that aren't qualified to work the suit and

I know there was a raid on some business in the past year that nabbed
a lot of illgals.  Might have been a chicken factory, not sure, but it
was one of the &quot;just doing the jobs Americans don't want&quot; type of
places.  So what happened after the raid?  The factory had a line of
Americans around the block applying for jobs.

There are plenty of Americans who want these jobs, they just don't
want them for the 3 or 4 dollars an hour that the illegals are doing
them for.

There was a recent study done in Los Angeles that calculated the cost

&gt;as a matter of fact, I stated that I previously agreed with you on that part

&gt;However, your post could have done without the &quot;back-story&quot; as it was
&gt;unnecessary and actually detracts from the point of your post (if the point
&gt;of your post actually was about lack of immigration law enforcement). If

No, the back story wasn't unneccsary at all.  There's more to the
immigration argument than just law enforcement.  She was showing us
how illegal immigration has directly affected her quality of life. If
these neighbors were stopped at the border like they should have been
she wouldn't have these problems.  Doesn't mean she'd necessarily have
better neighbors if they were white Americans, but that's just
theoretical since it's not the reality of the situation she's dealing
with.

Reasonable points made. I would also point out that one of the things
keeping down the pay for &quot;jobs that Americans won't do&quot; is the vast
number of illegals willing to work for next to nothing and the sad lack
of appropriate penalties for those who hire them. Consider, what might
happen if employers, lacking easily exploitable illegals to hire, were
forced to negotiate in good faith with their low level employees? Health
care insurance might just suddenly return to the table. Of course, the
cost of that insurance would first need to drop. Step one to accomplish
that would be closing the &quot;illegal alien free-clinics&quot; and returning
them to their original function: emergency rooms. (Circle complete!.
BTW, step two is enact a bit more tort reform, which would create vast
wave of &quot;redeployable&quot; lawyers available to pick lettuce. &quot;The Law
Offices of ***** ********&quot; might be converted to a hiring hall for
legal, seasonal agricultural workers.*)

The Other Mickey

* Nathan, I concede not all lawsuits are frivolous, but many are nothing
more than &quot;high tech&quot; extortion, which results in a hefty surcharge on
everything you or I buy, including health care.
