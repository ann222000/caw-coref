&gt; The End Of Cheap Food

&gt; By John James

&gt; 04 August,2007
&gt; Countercurrents.org

&gt; It looks like the era of cheap food is over. The price of maize has
&gt; doubled in a year, and wheat futures are at their highest in a decade.
&gt; The food price index in India has risen 11%, and in Mexico in January
&gt; there were riots after the price of corn flour went up fourfold. The
&gt; floods in England and India have devastated crops. In nearly every
&gt; country food prices are going up, and they are probably not going to
&gt; come down again.

&gt; Before World War II, most families spent a third or more of their
&gt; income on food, as the poor majority in developing countries still do.
&gt; But after the war a series of radical changes, from mechanisation to
&gt; the green revolution, raised agricultural productivity hugely and
&gt; caused a long, steep fall in the price of food, to a tenth of many
&gt; people’s income.

&gt; It will probably return to a quarter of a family's income within a
&gt; decade, or higher, from four factors:

&gt; 1) Demand as global population continues to grow and more people want
&gt; to eat more meat. Early this month, in its annual assessment of farming
&gt; trends, the UN predicted that in less than 10 years people in the
&gt; developing countries will be eating 30% more beef, 50% more pig meat
&gt; and 25% more poultry. With lot-feeding huge amounts of grain-growing
&gt; land will move from human to animal consumption.

&gt; 2) Global warming lowers crop yields: see the chart on the right.
&gt; Christopher Field and David Lobell in Environmental Research Letters in
&gt; March stated that for every 0.5°C temperature rise, crop yields fall
&gt; between 3 and 5%. So 2°C hotter means a 12 to 20% fall in global food
&gt; production just as the population is about to surge over the 7 billion
&gt; mark.

&gt; 3) Rising demand for biofuels replaces food production (see &quot;Looming
&gt; disaster&quot;, right), causing food price hikes that lead to social unrest,
&gt; such as the recent riots in Mexico. This should be taken in context: a
&gt; massive report by the major oil companies warns that oil supplies will
&gt; peak within 8 years, if not sooner. It estimates that production from
&gt; existing reserves would soon start declining by 3% pa even as world
&gt; demand for oil is growing by 2% pa. In order to keep the driving public
&gt; from facing reality politicians will take the easy road and legislate
&gt; to use more land for biofuels.

&gt; 4) Desertification, especially in the Sahara and Central Asia (see map
&gt; below), is undermining food production for one third of humanity. Tree
&gt; planting is not the answer as it puts more pressure on already-scarce
&gt; water. Their food will have to be provided by just those breadbasket
&gt; countries now turning to biofuels. “It creates a chain reaction that
&gt; must lead to social turmoil”, Zafaar Adeel, author of the UN food
&gt; report.

&gt; looming biofuels disaster

&gt; Biofuel production is pushing huge amounts of land out of food
&gt; production. One sixth of the grain grown in the US this year will be
&gt; &quot;industrial corn&quot; for ethanol. One third of US maize is now used for
&gt; biofuel and there was last year a 48% increase in the amount of
&gt; farmland devoted to biofuels. During that time hardly any new land was
&gt; brought under the plough to replace the lost food production.

&gt; There is only a difference in scale in China, Indonesia and Brazil
&gt; where primary forests are being cleared to plant energy crops. Yet,
&gt; after fossil fuel use, deforestation is the largest single source of
&gt; CO2.

&gt; The competition for water is likely to favour the biofuel producers as
&gt; their crop, being subsidised, commands higher prices than corn or soya.
&gt; Ethanol has roughly 70% the energy content of gasoline while costing
&gt; 40% more to produce.

&gt; In Australia, if all our wheat and sugar output was diverted to ethanol
&gt; it would supply less than 30% of our fuel needs. As these crops now
&gt; feed 80 million people, what will they eat instead?

&gt; It is argued that Australia could increase its biofuel capacity by
&gt; using marginal land, but Mick Keogh, executive director of the
&gt; Australian Farm Institute, said: &quot;A close examination of global biofuel
&gt; experiences shows they are only viable with high levels of government
&gt; support, and have at best a limited capacity to meet future energy
&gt; needs.&quot;

&gt; The attraction of biofuels for politicians is obvious: they can claim
&gt; they are doing something useful to combat global warming without
&gt; demanding any sacrifices from business or the voters. For voters the
&gt; attraction is that they can continue to drive their cars without a
&gt; thought for the consequences. The attraction for business is that they
&gt; can make lots of money out of biofuels, and be subsidised to do so.

&gt; A straight switch is happening from food to fuel. As oil prices rise -
&gt; and Peak Oil guarantees they will - it pulls up the price of biofuels
&gt; as well, so it becomes more attractive for farmers to switch from food
&gt; to fuel.

&gt; Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute says: &quot;The stage is now set
&gt; for frontal competition for grain between the 800 million people who
&gt; own automobiles, and the world's two billion poorest who will need it
&gt; to survive.&quot;

&gt; The real answer is to consume less, drive less and to fund high-tech
&gt; hybrid and electric cars so we dont panic for ethanol as oil production
&gt; declines. Let's not forget that ethanol is NOT a renewable product:
&gt; just consider the fuel and water required to produce and distribute it,
&gt; and the clearing of the forests to grow it that is now releasing huge
&gt; amounts of CO2.
">

The Lord loves farmers and stupid people.  Farmers (make that big ag
business) are getting rich and all the stupid people (who the Lord made
plenty of) are falling for the biofuel crap.

No.  In PA you set aside the top soil and strip mine.  When coal vein is
exhausted you put back the top soil and build a golf course.  You think

&lt;lol&gt; Sorry for laughing, but that is such an irony is it not?
The same thing is happening everywhere.

Farmers lose their land to increased property taxes due to increased
property values...

for housing developments and mini-malls.

Building housing on fertile lands is an f-ing crime.
There are plenty of places to build that are hostile to farming. It's
not a matter of space. Not really.

I meant rice, beans and torillas as a staple diet.

We do eat rice but it's brown, red and black rice from the asian market.

There may be a day when biofuels are economical but what is screwing up
the whole thing is the fine hand of government with their subsidies and
laws.  What it amounts to is taking money out of tax payer pockets and
giving it to ag business. This results in higher food costs to the tax
payer.  The tax payer is not saving any money in reduced fuel costs.
The same fine folks in congress that have done this have enacted a high
tariff on ethanol imports to prevent import of cheaper Brazilian ethanol
where production processes are more economical.

This would be a good idea but sugar cane grows best in places like
Brazil and agri-business has already spun importation of Brazilian
ethanol to a halt.

What is truly disturbing is that a few companies are in a position to
regulate the price of food as they now do with the price of oil, since
the two are so inexorably linked.

Because we subsidize the major protein grains, we have discouraged
farmers in the Third World from growing these crops.  For example.
&quot;small farmers in Mexico, compete(s) with American products raised on
megafarms that use satellite imagery to mete out fertilizer. These
products are so heavily subsidized by the government that many are
exported for less than it costs to grow them. According to the Institute
for Agriculture and Trade Policy in Minneapolis, American corn sells in
Mexico for 25 percent less than its cost. The prices Mr. Hernandez and
others receive are so low that they lose money with each acre they
plant.&quot; http://www.organicconsumers.org/chiapas/031203_chiapas.cfm

Thus we suppress competition, leaving only a few major players in food
production. Most American family farmers, unsubsidized, hope to break a
little over even, while corporate  agri-business reaps the subsidies. A
diverse, world wide farming is important to all of us for our security.
We all need farms in Mexico, Africa, and Asia producing a variety of
crops. Just as in our gardens, diversity is healthy. It brings checks
and balances. When part of the food grid goes down another could step in
and moderate the  short fall. But when there are only a few players, we
are at their mercy (think compassionate conservative, that should scare
you).

Diverting corn into ethanol will be good for the oil, petro-chemical,
subsidized, corporate agriculture, and the middle men like Cargill and
ADM that count on cheap materials to make their profits, for the rest of
us, it will just hasten our journey to becoming the new peasants.

&quot;In fact, corn is such a poor source of ethanol that researchers at the
University of Minnesota estimate that converting the entire U.S. corn
crop ‹ the sum of all our ears ‹ into ethanol would replace only 12
percent of our gasoline consumption. . . .

. . . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that reducing gasoline
consumption 10 percent through an increase in fuel economy standards
would cost producers and consumers about $3.6 billion a year. Achieving
the same result by expanding ethanol production would cost taxpayers at
least $10 billion a year, based on the subsidies ethanol already
receives ‹ and probably much more, because expanding production would
require higher subsidies.&quot;
http://prairieweather.typepad.com/big_blue_stem/2007/01/conservation_...
tml

So as Bob Zimmerman so eloquently put it,&quot;The pump don't work cause the
vandals took the handle&quot;. It is obvious that corporate America wants to
suck every list dime out of us. It is obvious that our representatives
are in the pockets of the rich (the farm bill is a classic example). It
is obvious that we the people, who have been watching this unfold, are
sheep.

The only way to stop the &quot;corporate American empire&quot; is (1) campaign
finance reform, (2) making subsidies available to all but the richest
farmers, (3) writing to your representatives to not spend another penny
on the War on Iraq, and (4) if you can bring yourself to do it, vote for
Cindy Sheehan for President (or anybody that isn't a Republican or a
Democrat).

If my memory serves me well.

Ethanol has a number like 1.2  to generate 1 equivalent of oil gas.
Then as Charlie pointed out there is soil loss.  It takes about one
bushel of soil to make one bushel of corn. So we are losing valuable
commodity potential for food and shelter etc.

Bill hope you can wade thru below.

Fumbling around here but, yeah, a gallon of ethanol has about 70% of the

Long on character assassination and short on facts. Certainly seen that
before. It doesn't match the approach I've encountered from other
instructors but it certainly would explain the downward spiral of
American education. So if your done stroking that little, uh, (?), hmm,
. . . ego of yours, perhaps you could apply some pedagogy here and give
us some facts. Hopefully you will address why we can't wait twenty to
forty years for fusion to come on line, instead of saddling us with a 10
to 100 thousand year problem of radioactive waste containment. But
before you get into the conspiracy of Yucca Mountain maybe you could
begin by addressing the total disinterest in nuclear construction,
unless the Feds limit the utility's exposure to liability. Apparently
Three Mile Island, Tchernobyl, or  most recently at Kasiwazaki, Japan,
where the magnitude of the &quot;at first unreported problem&quot; just keeps
growing, has rattled somebody's confidence.

Sorry, I very much want to hear your exposition of the benefits of
nuclear power, pleas continue.

But just so everybody is clear on their game plan (Bush'e Everlasting

&quot;Of course the people don't want war. But after all, it's the leaders of
the country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple matter to
drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship,
or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the
people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is
easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and
denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country
to greater danger.&quot;

unsubstantiated derision of Bush? Did not the Bush Administration
horribly orchestrate an unnecessary war, (it appears) it badly bungled
another, and is now pressing for a third? Is not the Bush Administration
socializing wasteful expenditures and privatizing war profits? Are not
these wasteful expenditures crippling our ability to respond to national
disasters? You're familiar with the loss of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, the FISA
court oversight, privacy? Do you know anything about the laws that were
passed as a result of the Church Commission (&quot;72) and the Rockerfeller
Report ('75). Does not the Bush Administration meet with corporate
lobbyists to solicit corporate desired legislation? That this and
pandering to the theocrats are threatening to under-cut science and
spawn a generation of Falwell like Taliban? If you don't know this
stuff, it is easy enough to look up.  Heck, just ask retired diplomate
Joe Wilson about the heck of a job that Bush is doing to us. &quot;sides,

(How did that go again? A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer
were asked to find the volume of a large red rubber ball. The
mathematician did the integral of the area of a curve with half the
diameter of the ball through 360 degrees. The physicist submerged the
ball in water to observe its' displacement, and the engineer looked up
the answer in his &quot;big red rubber ball&quot; book:-)
------
Meanwhile back at Kasiwazaki, Japan

Initially, plant owner Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said there
was no leak of radioactivity. Then it said there was a small leak of
radioactively contaminated water.  Then the size of the leak turned out
to be much larger than originally reported, and the water was 50 percent
more radioactive than they had first said.  Then it came out that
hundreds of nuclear waste barrels had fallen over, with the lids coming
off dozens of them.  Oh and, it was revealed that cobalt-60 and
chromium-51 was released into the atmosphere from an exhaust stack. Stay
tuned for further developments.

I would have thought as teacher (if you are a teacher) would know more
about what they were advocating. Anyway, if you want more try
http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/07/17/japan_nucle...

Recipe By: Jacques Pepin
Published in: Fast Food My Way

Bread leftover
cheese
chicken stock
pepper
chives chopped

For this soup like one my mother used to make, prepare croutons by
baking slices of leftover bread in a conventional oven or toaster
oven until brown and crisp.  Divide the toasted bread among soup
bowls, breaking the slices into pieces if they are too large, and
grate a generous amount of Gruyere or Jarlsberg on top.  Bring a good
homemade chicken stock or canned broth to a boil and pour over the
croutons and cheese in the bowls.  Sprinkle with cracked pepper and a
few chopped chives and serve

Thank you, Cheryl.  I'm with you 100%.  The bushwackers' hatred isn't
doing anyone any good at all.  I don't like what he's done, either.
That means time for a change, and it will change, on 1/20/2008.

What I really hate is the pigeonholing that goes on now with political
leanings.  Because I consider myself a conservative it means in some
(conservative, mainly but also 'liberal') circles that I'm wrong to be
an environmentalist, wrong to care about our food......these aren't
liberal or conservative issues, they're human issues that we need to
do something about.

And while I'm completely off topic, here's a very moving link that
shows a glimmer of hope - only if these people aren't hunted down and
beheaded by the terrorists themselves.....

We eat fish about once per week if that. Most of that is chicken, pork
and some beef.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I net about $750.00 per week.

&gt;&gt; About what I do.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Between pet food and human food (of decent quality rather that eating a
&gt;&gt;&gt; diet high in starch like too many do) I spend about $250.00 per week at
&gt;&gt;&gt; the grocery store.

&gt;&gt; I don't know where you live or what you buy, but I spend about that
&gt;&gt; much per month.

&gt; That is for 2 people and the pets. About 1/2 of that is for good quality
&gt; pet food. Fresh meat and fresh veggies is what we mostly eat, most of
&gt; that cost is for meat.

While it can vary widely, I think we average about $200 a week for 4 people
and no pets. However, I have a teenaged son..... We're trying meatless days,
but that doesn't seem to work well.

Thank you, Ann, for sharing the video.  I don't usually go to the links
but did this time.  It is certainly a reminder that we people all over the
world are much the same and are all victims of our &quot;leaders&quot; and the words
spread by those same leaders (and our media!).  We only need to look
within our own country to see the conflict in what we say and what we do.
It's important that we not let our own unpleasant truths be forgotten.
What some dictators have done is not that different from what was done in
&quot;settling and civilizing&quot; our own country.  It's always important to
remember the history books are written by the winners and nothing written
in those books ever justifies people hurting people.

While I detest our current administration on the federal level, I have
learned that our current president is not the worst we have ever had.  He
is simply &quot;more effective&quot; to hurting our position worldwide than some
past presidents because of a technical communication age.  I often wonder
where the terrorist cause would be if we had not invaded Iraq without U.N.
sanction with all of the sympathy and support from the entire world after
9-11.  I suspect it would not be as advanced as it is; my fear is that we
have created more support for it than we have eliminated - how can anyone
truly know.

For a chilling reality of presidents, read the lesser known facts about
Andrew Jackson.  His Trail of Tears march was only one of a truly horrible
line of actions by him, yet he is &quot;honored&quot; on our $20 bill.  I wonder how
many Americans would like seeing his face so often if they realized his
true character.  I knew some of what he had done, but until recently, I
didn't realize what a truly evil person he was.  He makes this president
look like a saint.

It's a downright shame that truly good people can't make it in politics at
high levels.   I'm talking truly good as in all the way through deep into
their heart as well as their actions.

My tag line on my signature has been:  &quot;I can't change the world but I can
make my little corner better.&quot;  That is what most of us try to do, and it
matters.

Look, I came from a Republican family. I voted for Goldwater, not
because of his ideas but because of his integrity. (Barry and George
McGovern became friends.) But then the Dixie-crats boarded the
Republican party and that was the end of the GOP. I have long admired
Pete McCloskey, a local Republican and co-author of the Endangered
Species Act, and I admire Russel Train, another Republican, the second
head of the EPA and founder of the World Wildlife Fund (Politics,
Pollution, and Pandas: An Environmental Memoir ). There are good guys
who are Republicans but these guys in Washington ain't them.
Conservative isn't supposed to mean reactionary. If you want to put me
in a box, I'm a fiscal conservative and a social liberal.

My beef with Oz is his &quot;Sheldon like&quot; unsupported condescension toward
anything that rubs his fragile ego the wrong way. Besides a series of
unsupported babble about the benefits of fission reactors, he claimed
that Rachel Carson was responsible for 200 million deaths and he gave no
supporting evidence. (I mean Hitler was probably responsible for 100
million deaths, and look at the deep doo that got him in.) He claims
that this attribution to Carson is no different than me referring to
&quot;shrub&quot; as Monsanto's very best 40-0-0. Oz is living in a bubble if he
doesn't understand what a premeditated gangster Bush is. If I make a
claim. I'll back it up with citations or corroborating logic. Oz makes
his claims, and then like a cow having relieved herself, walks away.

In any event my reference to Bush et al. was just a small part of my
post. Most of it (equally off subject) had to do with the folly of
nuclear power.

Ann, I think the point of this excellent video
( http://youtube.com/watch?v=s6P9qP_Rpxw )  is about the lies that are
being told about Arabs, not the terrorists in their midst. Yeah there
probably are a spectrum of would-be terrorists in Iraq, just as there
are in America. They range from cat killers to the Timothy Mc Veighs to
the George Bushes. They are all just waiting for funding. (Isn't that
what this is all about?) Kermit Roosevelt, while working as a CIA agent
(1953), payed both pro-Mosaddeq and anti-Mosaddeq factions to riot in
the streets of Tehran, thereby destabalizing and overthrowing the
democratically elected Iranian government. (and people wonder why they
might hate us.) The CIA used terror and false news stories to do the
same in Nicaragua to topple the government of Jacobo Arbenz Guzman
(1954). I'm presuming (can't prove squat) that the Bush-Cheney Corp. is
milking this war for profits, which all go away, if the war ends. So
they just keep it simmering. (Missing weapons? Missing money? How could
this happen?) You want to see the progression? Look at Overthrow:
America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq by Stephen Kinzer.

(On subject for no apparent reason)
My crop of tomatoes so far numbers 3 (stupice) harvested but greenies on
7 other vines, and at least flowers on another 12. Had first cuke last
night. I have a couple of ja-lap-pen-nos with breakfast most mornings
(hot suckers). Had a few beets (anybody have a descent recipe for beet
greens, other than plain boiled or steamed?). I planted my corn in
succession this year. First few were too old but as I worked through the
patch I finally found some that were perfect. Not much to show for all
the work and water but tasty. The green beans sometimes go in the salad
and sometimes mixed with crook-necks, and sometimes by themselves,
depending on how much I have.

Tonight I'm planning on doing a pasta. So far I'm planning on adding
olive oil, garlic, mushrooms, crook-necks, and basil. Any suggestions,
or tweaks anyone could suggest?
