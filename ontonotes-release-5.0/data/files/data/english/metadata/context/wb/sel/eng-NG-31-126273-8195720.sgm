Motor programs in the brain

The first motor program generator (central pattern generator) was
demonstrated by Wilson in 1961. He showed that an ensemble of neurons
produced the muscular action required for locust wing action. Since
then a great deal of work has been done, mostly with invertebrates,
and with simple circuits. None question that the neural circuits
involved are constructed by the genome. The molecular activity
involved in such construction of circuitry by the genome is beyond
present analysis, but many believe that it will be done.

In vertebrates, the circuitry largely defies analysis, being
exemplified by populations rather than by individual neurons.

Here is a list of the major motor pattern generators and their
approximate location within the central nervous system; all cribbed
from Larry Swanson.

Breathing: ventral medulla/upper cervical cord.

Orofaciopharyngeal movements; facial expression, vocalization,
licking, chewing, and swallowing: parvicellular reticular nucleus
(dorsolateral hindbrain).

Reaching, grasping, and manipulating: cervical enlargement (spinal
cord).

Orienting movements;
Eyes (oculomotor): dorsal midbrain reticular core.
Head and neck: cervical spinal cord.

Posture: spinal cord.

Locomotion: spinal cord.

Some list! Since none seem to question that invertebrate motor pattern
generators are constructed by the genome, why should we question
similar construction by the genome in vertebrates (including man, of
course). The shift from individual neurons to populations of neurons
is fundamentally trivial. Also trivial (except to anatomists) is to
extend the &quot;brain&quot; to include the spinal cord. I so do.

I like to think that a human lifetime can be seen as the genome
interacting with the environment. Many bridle at such a notion. They
want to include something from the soul (spirit, essence, psyche,
mind, consciousness, awareness, intelligence, intellect, mentality,
self, individuality, persona, personality, conscious mental field,
self awareness, sentience, executive function), but that is what I
see.

Motor pattern generators were learned by the genome during four and a
half billion years of random mutations; nothing is learned after
conception. Any mutations acquired during meiosis will be passed on to
the next generation. We are born with a set of motor pattern
generators. All motor acts follow from these generators. Specifically,
all phonemes are produced individually from generators. Man can learn
initiation, variation, control, and expression of a generator, but not
the generator itself.

Man does not &quot;learn&quot; to walk. The walking circuitry in his brain
matures, and he walks. The environment alters the expression of the
locomotion generator so the brain (following the rules of neural
alteration as set up by the genome, enables the organism to get over
the ground.

Man's brain matures. In his second year, man starts s to babble (baby
talk). He does not learn to babble. He just takes pleasure in
initiating the phoneme generators. Later, then environment will cause
him to sequence the phoneme generators. He will &quot;learn&quot; a language.

All, not some--but all, motor acts proceed from the initiation of
motor program generators.

The activity of a motor program generator can be liked to a player
piano. The holes in the piano roll are the generator. As the roll is
unrolled, air passes through the holes, passes through tubes, and
actuates the key mechanisms. Music ensues. The pulses of air, passing
through the tubes, make up an abstract entity that we may call a
&quot;program&quot;.

Similarly, a motor program generator is activated. Beautifully
sequenced neural pulses (a motor program) flow through brain circuitry
until they reach motor neurons. A motor act ensues.

En route, the motor program flows through the ventral anterior-ventral
lateral complex of the thalamus. Here the motor program is subject to
the inhibitive influence of the thalamic reticular nucleus. If the
program is halted (inhibited), the organism pauses. This pause is
generally called thinking, or hesitating. I intend to speak more of
thinking in a subsequent post.

Since my own interest is  invertebrate nervous systems, I can't
complain about your insistence on the significance of genetically
determined programs of neural circuits and patterns of activity in all
animals.  However you seem to swing the pendulum far too much in
denying any influence of learning, a process that can easily modify or
modulate genetically determined circuits.  Why not go for the middle
ground and say that genetically programmed patterns, as modified by
conditioning and learning, underlie a lot of vertebrate and mammalian
and primate and hominoid (and human) activity.  Nonetheless, you also
do have to concede that there is also a separate enormous pattern of
behavior especially in the latter group of the above mentioned animals
that is essentially completely learned.  Even something like bird song
varies tremendously in the relative significance of genetic
programming and learning.

And your suggestion that what we call &quot;thinking&quot; is merely a pause in
genetically programmed and controlled motor behaviors strikes me as
rather bizarre, to say the least.

On the more positive side, don't try to extend the notion of &quot;brain&quot;
to the spinal cord.  Just refer instead &quot;central nervous system&quot; and
not to brain.  There is no question that this will include the spinal
cord.  Incidentally, you have to do the same for invertebrates:
Wilson's central pattern generators were located in the thoracic
ganglia, part of the CNS but distinctly not part of the brain.
Invertebrate also have complex pattern generators outside the CNS. The
stomatogastric system of Crustacea is a prime example.  The cardiac
ganglion is perhaps the simplest example of a peripheral pattern
generating neural circuit even though the pattern is by no means
complex.

Also I believe it was Adrian in the early 1930's who showed
spontaneous patterned activity in fish respiratory systems, i.e., a
central pattern generator as opposed to reflex activity or some other
response to stimuli.

There is much known about this process and you should review some
popular embryology books, even at the public library, these include
the direction of the assembly of these circuits by the genes by,
chemical gradients attracting particular cells to do particular
things, cell multiplication, cell type formation, etc,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryology

Following fertilization there is a period of about 24 hours during
which profound and still poorly understood changes occur. The cell
then divides into two adherent daughter cells and after another 18-24
hour period, becomes a four celled embryo. It seems probable that
until this time, each of the daughter cells maintains the potential to
continue development in its own right and become a separate and
complete individual. This is the source of identical twins, triplets
or quadruplets, when they occur. With successive divisions, this
pluripotential quality is lost and the components of the growing cell
cluster become progressively more specialized.

As the cells continue to divide and adhere to each other through the
8,16, 32 cell stages etc., the cluster begins to resemble a mulberry
and, as a result, this is often referred to as the 'morula' (mulberry)
stage. During the following sequence of divisions, the solid mass of
daughter cells develop an inner cavity, thereby entering the
'blastocyst' (blast, developing; cyst, sac, stage. At one end of the
now hollow, ball-like structure, a cluster of cells grows more rapidly
than those around it, becoming the 'inner cell mass'. This is the
beginning of the embryo. The remainder of the blastocyst will form the
various parts of the embryo/fetus support system, i.e., placenta,
amniotic sac, etc.

THE PRIMITIVE CELL LAYERS

Each individual is made up of three different types of tissue.
Ectoderm includes all of the packaging elements of the organism, i.e.,
skin, hair, nails and, interestingly enough, the nervous system.
Mesoderm makes up the the major structural components of the body
including the great muscle masses, both the voluntary muscles which
underlie all of our work, actions and behavior, and the involuntary
muscles which make up the walls of all of our organs such as heart and
blood vessels, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, and our
bones. Finally the endoderm includes all of the cell systems which
line our organs and vessels.

APPEARANCE OF THE NOTOCHORD

The inner cell mass originally differentiates into a layer of
primitive (presumptive) ectoderm and an underlying and roughly
parallel-lying layer of endoderm. In the area between these two cell
layers, a few new cells appear, apparently from the underlying
endoderm. These most recent arrivals become the primitive mesoderm.
Their first task is to come together to form a long cylindrical
structure. In doing this, they are recapitulating the earliest event
in the transition from invertebrates to vertebrate forms, a transition
which occurred at least six hundred million years ago. This rod-like
structure is the notochord, the progenitor of the backbone or
vertebral column. We all still carry traces of the old notochord in
our own bodies. Our vertebral column is made up of 32 separate
vertebrae, piled on each other to form our flexible backbone. Between
each vertebra is a small shock absorber or intervertebral disc. In the
center of each of these fibrous disks is a small soft area like a
cherry inside a hard chocolate. This is the nucleus pulposus, the
divided up remnant of our notochord. When we suffer a herniated disc,
it is the nucleus pulposus which has been squeezed out of the
intervertebral disc and is now playing havoc by pressing on one or
more spinal roots. We have literally been 'tripped up' by a vestigial
organ more than half a billion years old!

In the case of the developing embryo, the notochord seems to have a
highly specific &quot;organizing influence&quot; on the primitive ectoderm layer
just above it. Through the release of special chemicals, the overlying
ectoderm is induced to divide more rapidly, forming a thickened mass
called the neural plate. A crease or fold soon appears in this plate.
The crease rapidly deepens and becomes known as the neural groove. The
entire embryo is lengthening as this happens. The neural groove
continues to deepen until its sides, the neural folds, arch over and
fuse with each other forming a short segment of completely enclosed
tube. This newly formed &quot;neural tube&quot; will become the nervous system.
The actual fusion of the walls to form the tube occurs first in the
center of the embryo about midway between front and rear poles of the
still rapidly lengthening little organism. However, you can probably
visualize how the newly formed section of neural tube rapidly begins
to roof over in both a frontward (anterior or rostral) and a backward
(posterior or caudal) direction. It is as if there were two zippers in
the newly formed roof of the developing neural tube. As these zippers
are pulled simultaneously away from each other toward the two ends of
the embryo, the neural folds come together and the neural tube
lengthens progressively in both directions. Finally the neural tube is
almost completely enclosed in both directions, leaving only a small
unroofed portion or opening at each end. These residual openings are
called neuropores and under normal developmental conditions will soon
be closed, thereby forming a complete neural tube. During this process
a front-back polarity has been established in the still-lengthening
embryo. Accordingly, the small unroofed area of the neural tube at the
front end is called the anterior neuropore; the one at the rear end,
the posterior neuropore.

INCOMPLETE CLOSURE OF THE TUBE

We have already mentioned the remarkable capacity of the developing
nervous system to follow an incredibly complex series of developmental
rules laid down progressively by the genes. Nonetheless, errors occur,
and the roofing over of the neural groove to form the neural tube
represents one point where disturbed development can severely affect
the growing embryo. Incomplete closure of the anterior or posterior
neuropore represents two such developmental errors during the first
trimester which radically alter the future life of the embryo/fetus
and infant.

If the anterior neuropore fails to close, the resulting deficit leads
to varying degrees of incomplete development of the cerebral
hemispheres and brain stem. One of the most frequent and dramatic
resulting anomalies is the fetus which is born without cerebral
hemispheres and usually without any skull above the level of the eyes.
This is the so-called anencephalic child (a- or an- without: cephalon-
brain) Strangely enough, this type of extreme anomaly may come to term
and under some conditions, live for a week or two following birth.
Such a severely deformed infant has only a brain stem (the upward
continuation of the spinal cord within the skull) on which to depend
for its behavior. This takes care of its basic breathing,
cardiovascular, suckling and elimination reflexes. However, little
else is possible for the infant and it usually dies within a few days
or weeks of birth.

If incomplete closure persists at the posterior neuropore, the fetus
will be born with some variant of spina bifida (bifida- split). In the
most severe of these, the posterior portion of the spinal cord is
totally or partially undeveloped and the entire lower back may be
open. Some defects of this sort may be amenable to restorative surgery
while others are not compatible with life. There is a more subtle form
of this anomaly known as spina bifida occulta (occulta- hidden) where
the only residual pathology is a tract or canal, usually of
microscopic size, running between the subdural space surrounding the
lower tip of the spinal cord and the skin of the lower back. Often,
the only sign of such an anomaly is a little patch of hair in the
middle of the lower back just above the beginning of the cleft between
the buttocks. Although usually asymptomatic, this tiny canal can
become infected, usually through trauma, and can form a painful pus-
filled sac known as a pilonidal cyst. Early in World War II, one of
the more frequent surgical procedures was removal of pilonidal cysts
caused by the rough and bouncy ride experienced by soldiers riding in
earlier versions of the famous Army jeep.

CLOSURE OF THE NEURAL TUBE

With successful closure of the neural tube, the anterior or rostral
(rostral- front) end develops three vesicles which demarcate the
territory for cerebral hemispheres and brain stem. Of these, the first
and third divide once more forming a series of five vesicles which
will become the major portions of the central nervous system within
the skull. These consist of the cerebral hemispheres, diencephalon,
midbrain, pons and cerebellum and medulla oblongata.

CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND DIVISION

The most dramatic phase of development now shifts to the walls of the
neural tube. Here, what is initially a single cell layer of primitive
ectoderm begins to divide very rapidly and will in time form virtually
all of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Packets of
cells 'left over' on each side of the midline, where fusion of the
neural folds initially occurred, are known as neural crest cells.
These will migrate to a number of sites throughout

But the genes direct the assembly of the neurons which can be accented
to these various songs. We need a standard that can make it clear
three areas of activity; activities completely determined by the
genes, 2 activities of a mixed nature via nurture and 3 completely
learned and little effect from the genes that direct the assembly of
these capacities. I would wager that most activities in all animals
are the second (2) variety, because I like Ridley's view of nature via
nurture;

Is it nature or nurture that makes us who we are? The question itself
is a false dichotomy;

[someone presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where
in fact other alternatives exist or can exist]

There are copious examples from human and animal behavior, which
present the notion that our environment affects the way our genes
express themselves.

The switches controlling our 30,000 or so genes not only form the
structures of our brains but do so in such a way as to cue off the
outside environment in a tidy feedback loop of body and behavior.

We have genetic &quot;thermostats&quot; that are turned up and down by
environmental factors.

The proof is in the pudding for such touchy subjects as monogamy,
aggression, and parenting, which we now understand have some genetic
controls.

Nevertheless, the more we understand both our genes and our instincts,
the less inevitable they seem.

Not only are nature and nurture not mutually exclusive, but genes are
designed to take their cue from nurture.

Genes are not unchanging little bits of DNA: their expression varies
throughout a person's life, often in response to environmental
stimuli.

Babies are born with genes hard-wired for sight, but if they are also
born with cataracts, the genes turn themselves off and the child will
never acquire the ability to see properly.

On the other hand, stuttering used to be ascribed solely to
environmental factors. Then stuttering was found to be clearly linked
to the Y chromosome, and evidence for genetic miswiring of areas in
the brain that manage language was uncovered. But environment still
plays a role: not everyone with the genetic disposition will grow up
to be a stutterer.

[snip summary]
&gt; Some list! Since none seem to question that invertebrate motor pattern
&gt; generators are constructed by the genome, why should we question
&gt; similar construction by the genome in vertebrates (including man, of
&gt; course). The shift from individual neurons to populations of neurons
&gt; is fundamentally trivial. Also trivial (except to anatomists) is to
&gt; extend the &quot;brain&quot; to include the spinal cord. I so do.
">

The shift to neural groups or clusters (a term I prefer to
'populations') is not at all trivial, especially since it's quite clear
that that in vertebrates environmental factors are essential to the
proper development of the brain, including of course those motor
programs. IOW, the structure of those clusters de[ends on environmental
inputs. The vertebrate learns how to move. This does not abrogate the
function of the genome, but does change it. As a matter of fact, there
is evidence that the genome's function depends crucially on external
inputs, even in invertebrates.

| Motor programs in the brain

In mammalian nervous systems, there's
an enormous over-production of cells,
that's subsequently whittled-down dur-
ing the course of experience, and which
has been verified to occur differentially
with respect to experience. Rats [and
humans] that experience &quot;rich&quot; envir-
onments end up with nervous systems
that have relatively-more neurons 'wired-
up' in relatively-more-complex ways.

What this Proves is that 'the genome'
maps =generalized= processors, the
functionings of which are tuned by ex-
perience.

The &quot;general plan&quot; =is= in 'the genome',
but 'the genome' does not, and cannot,
dictate the 'final' convergence upon
functionality -- because, if that were
the case, then, to the degree that it
'were' the case, the organism would
not be able to adapt to demands en-
countered during experience unless
'the genome was omniscient'.

The difference is subtle, but Huge,
and understanding it is extremely-
important -- because, in it, how and
why experience matters is fully-dis-
closed.

Understand?

Given a particular 'genome', knowing
that, 'within' the bounds' of that 'genome's
capacities, experience determines the
functional convergence enables folks
to =choose= that which they, for instance,
will enable their Children to experience,
and gives Individuals reason to get-off-
their butts to choose what they will, them-
selves, experience.

The same-stuff is True across popula-
tions -- groups can choose what they'll
enable themselves to experience.

And, lo and behold, 'the genome' stands-
ready to enable, regardless of the partic-
ulars inherent in experience -- except, as
above, 'the genome' cannot enable that
which is not experienced.

That is, for instance, &quot;being creative&quot; re-
quires that being able to &quot;create&quot; be ex-
perienced.

Of course, this's all best-practiced be-
ginning at birth -- be-cause, if it's not,
to the degree of such, the nerve cells
that'd, otherwise, enable this or that
functionality will have been whittled-
away -- which reality is what folks're
actually referring to when they say that
&quot;the genome determines&quot; this or that.
[After the massive cell-loss that typ-
ically occurs, there's an appearance
of 'incapability' -- but that's only be-
cause the massive cell-loss has, in
fact, occurred.

It requires volumes to just barely ad-
dress what's inherent -- even what
one eats, which is just more exper-
ience, enters into the determination
of functional convergence.

Basically, the capabilities of the gen-
eralized processors that are mapped
in 'normal' human 'genomes' are un-
bounded.

Folks, not being aware with respect to
such, routinely throw-out almost all of
what 'genomes' enable -- which 'throw-
ing-out' has, itself, been, thus far, ex-
perientially-'determined' -- folks 'pre-
sume' that all they 'can do' is 'what has
already been done' because that's
what folks routinely expereince, and,
then, folks who've 'thrown-out' their
innate functional-convergence capac-
ities negatively-sanction anyone who
has not -- which tends to keep 'every-
thing' going-nowhere.

And, then, folks, having thrown-out
almost all of what 'genomes' enable,
which is literally unbounded, say, &quot;It
must be genetic&quot; :-]

[If it's 'necessary' for me to explain, I'm
=not= being &quot;cantankerous&quot;. I'm just
trying to give folks Reason. Unfortun-
ately, it's necessary to disclose to
folks who've &quot;thrown-out&quot; stuff that
what can be =still= depends upon their
choices -- which is 'Difficult' be-cause
the stuff in which &quot;choice&quot; can occur
has been &quot;thrown-out&quot;.

It's why I emphasize the Children in
the work I do, Trusting that Adults can
see that much, and that they'll find it
'within' themselves to choose accord-
ingly -- working to give folks experience
that'll enable such choice, which is
'Hard' because folks don't like to exper-
ience that which is different from that
which they've experienced :-]

It's a bit of a &quot;hump&quot; that needs to be
gotten-over, and it's 'slathered with a
slimey layer', so folks slip a lot in try-
ing to 'get-over-it'.

Anyway, relative to behavior, the &quot;motor
programs&quot; you've cited are analogous
the capabilities of a master automobile
mechanic to a crescent wrench -- just
&quot;tools&quot; that enable the actual work.

Considered in stand-alone ways, they
[justifiably] seem wonderous, but =rel-
ative to= the unboundedness that's
mapped in 'the genome', they're Trivial.

[Please forgive me if I've offended.

I mean 'just'-the-opposite stuff, and
I'm 'tired'. Just enough left to say-it-
plain.]

I would strike &quot;learning&quot; from my vocabulary. I think &quot;maturation&quot; a

the environment. &quot;Maturation&quot; includes the concept of a window during
which certain of these adaptations are emphasized, or even possible.
One thinks of binocular vision in the primate as an example. The
binocular window closes at six (?) in man, forever.

Let it be &quot;maturation&quot;.

I strongly object to &quot;underlie a lot&quot;. Why not just &quot;all&quot;? Is birdsong
to be maturation (including all the methods of adjustment mentioned
above), or are we to allow the soul to have a hand?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And your suggestion that what we call &quot;thinking&quot; is merely a pause in
&gt; genetically programmed and controlled motor behaviors strikes me as
&gt; rather bizarre, to say the least.

We look at the normal function of the mammal for something different,
something outstanding. We see the startle response. The thalamic
reticular nucleus halts all motor programs in the ventral anterior-
ventral lateral complex. The animal is frozen. Motor program
generators that do not pass through the thalamus are activated. The
head is oriented toward the novel disturbance. The body takes a crouch
stance. Sensory information passes through the thalamus reticular
nucleus. If the balance of previous bad outcomes is toward fleeing, it
disinhibits the fleeing motor program. If the balance is toward
fighting, it disinhibits the fighting motor program. If the balance is
toward unimportance, it disinhibts the interrupted motor program, and
life continues.

The startle response is endlessly embroidered by man. He writes books.
Provincial as ever, he speaks of thinking.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the more positive side, don't try to extend the notion of &quot;brain&quot;
&gt; to the spinal cord.  Just refer instead &quot;central nervous system&quot; and
&gt; not to brain.

I was upset by the six syllables in &quot;central nervous system&quot;. It
bothers me that we don't have a one-syllable name for the concept. But
you are so right. I have resolved, in the future, to use the first
instance of the concept to write &quot;central nervous system (CNS)&quot; and
afterwards to use just &quot;CNS&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also I believe it was Adrian in the early 1930's who showed
&gt; spontaneous patterned activity in fish respiratory systems, i.e., a
&gt; central pattern generator as opposed to reflex activity or some other
&gt; response to stimuli.

I always bow to authority when reporting precedence. Did Adrian have a
clear understanding of the respiratory system as a neural circuit,
i.e., something that can be bread boarded?

As I have told Scanlon (in several different ways), his views are consistent
with what is known about so-called &quot;emitted&quot; behavior (behavior that is not
elicited on the pattern of the reflex), but that is as far as it goes. It
should be well known that some behavior is spontaneous in the sense
described above, and the probability of the behavior can be altered by its
consequences. That the basal ganglia are critical to such response classes
is also clear. That pretty much sums up his position as far as it goes. His
ridiculous notion that anything that doesn't directly mention nervous system
activity (i.e., behavioral definitions of habituation, classical
conditioning, operant conditioning) is to be relegated to the &quot;soul&quot; is
insipid. The notion that thinking is merely the nervous activity that
intervenes between some antecedent stimulus and some response is equally
insipid. Unfortunately, when it comes to mainstream psychology and the
fields it has corrupted (like most of neurobiology) his inanity is not rare.
Other than that I don't have any feelings on the subject one way or the
other. :)

BTW, there have not been many that have taken &quot;spontaneity&quot; seriously. Curt
Richter was one of the first (especially odd since his graduate advisor was
JB Watson), followed by Skinner who wrote a paper on &quot;spontaneous behavior&quot;
(around 1932, I think) even while he was still calling operant behavior a
type of reflex. Guys like Victor Hamburger came later, but they were
responsible for the notion gaining more popularity in biology - eventually
leading to the notion of the CPG.
