MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP)--A cosmetics company CEO has sued Southwest Airlines
(LUV), alleging that she was unfairly subjected to its policy of requiring
large passengers to buy two seats because she is black.

Nadine Thompson, president, CEO and co-founder of Warm Spirit Inc. beauty
and wellness company in Exeter, sued the airline in federal court in
Concord last week, saying the company does not uniformly enforce its policy
requiring obese passengers to buy two seats.

The lawsuit said &quot;a disproportionate number of women and persons of color
are subjects of Southwest's policy requiring a passenger to purchase a
second ticket.

&quot;But for the plaintiff being a large African-American woman, she would not
have been subjected to Southwest's policy of requiring a passenger to
purchase a second ticket.&quot;

The lawsuit said, &quot;Similarly sized white male passengers are not subjected
to Southwest's policy requiring a passenger to purchase a second ticket.&quot;

Southwest Airlines disagrees with Thompson.

&quot;I know that is not the case at all. We do not tolerate any discrimination
in any shape, form or fashion,&quot; said Southwest spokesman Ed Stewart.

&quot;Being a black man myself I can totally speak from experience,&quot; Stewart
said. &quot;We do not discriminate against black people. That's been my
experience for the 14 years I've been here.&quot;

Thompson said she had booked the flight to a conference in Chicago out of
Manchester Airport. She was relaxing in her seat on July 9, 2003, with the
seat belt buckled and the armrest down, when a Southwest employee
approached her and told her she would have to buy a second ticket or leave
the aircraft.

She said the man kept repeating it was &quot;for her comfort and safety and for
the safety of the people around her.&quot;

Southwest had never before required her to buy two tickets, she said. She
told the Southwest employee that no one was sitting next to her, so she
couldn't be encroaching on anyone else's seat.

Thompson said she had been a frequent flier on Southwest, flying at least
three or four times a month as CEO of Warm Spirit Inc.

She decided to leave the plane. When she left, she was met on the jetway by
three Southwest employees and two Rockingham County sheriff's deputies. She
said she was deeply humiliated. &quot;I about died.&quot;

She said she started to cry, but the deputies were very kind and helped her
book a new, single-seat flight on United.

&quot;They're feeling horrible,&quot; she said of the deputies. &quot;One of them said,
'You're no bigger than my wife. I can't believe this could happen to my
wife.&quot;'

Southwest because their blubbery booties won't fit in the goddamn seats. At

Did anyone else note the irony in Southwest's response?

"/> The very act of requiring an obese person to purchase two tickets, while

&quot;discrimination&quot; is: treating people differently based on some
characteristic.

Now discrimination is not necessarily bad. Most discrimination is good. We
discriminate amongst job seekers and divide them into groups of &quot;qualified&quot;
and &quot;not qualified&quot; people (perhaps using education and/or experience to
make the division). We then routinely discriminate against the &quot;not
qualified&quot; group in making hiring decisions.

Discrimination is bad when society has decided that decisions should not be
based on a small number of certain characteristics. Unless the activity
really requires discrimination, it is not permitted in our society to
discriminate on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, and other similar
categories (exceptions being such things as a restroom attendant (sex
discrimination is O.K.), an actor playing the role of M.L. King Jr. (race
discrimination is O.K.(, etc.).

The real question in this case is whether or not society believes we can use
a person's size as a basis for permissible or impermissible discrimination.
Southwest believes that it should be allowed to discriminate, contrary to
the assertion of its spokesperson.

Okay, so what you got here is yet another Biiiiiiiiiiiig, fat black woman

Maybe if she'd put more emphasis on losing weight, and less on the

templates, similar to the baggage templates seen at airports, so that

it upon everyone.

&gt;| There's no discrimination here. The rule is the same for both: You
&gt;pay for
&gt;| each seat that you occupy either fully or partially.
&gt;|
&gt;| This is as &quot;discriminatory&quot; as the fact that if a fat person needs
&gt;three Big
&gt;| Macs to feel full after lunch, he has to pay for three Big Macs, not
&gt;one.

&gt; In that case, sell seats by the inch. Pay for the number of
&gt;horizontal
&gt;inches you use.

&gt; In fact, why stop there? Shorten the distance from floor to
&gt;ceiling
&gt;to a maximum of six feet. You're taller than that? - Sorry, you'll
&gt;have to
&gt;pay for the extra height.
&gt; Muscular? No matter how compact you might be, airlines could
&gt;charge you for your weight. The more weight you transport, the more
&gt;money it costs the airline, so no matter how the weight is packaged,
&gt;you should pay more.
&gt; Let's charge more for children too. True, they don't weigh as
&gt;much nor take up as much space, but some of them can be annoying
&gt;to other passengers if they cry or get too fidgety.
&gt; And shouldn't people pay extra for the privilege of reclining
&gt;their
&gt;seats back? After all, they're infringing on someone else's already
&gt;tiny
&gt;space. How is it that there are so many complaints about sideways
&gt;space, but so few about space in front?

&gt;Robin, wondering why some thin people whine so much, when it's the
&gt;fat people who are being squeezed out

"/> You have so really stupid ideas, fat lady. Buy your extra seat and quit
whining.

sell a ticket to someone if they cannot offer them a full seat space?&quot;
Of course not. It is not fair and it is not safe. If a passenger is
doing something that permanently intrudes into the seat beside them,
that seat is not fully available and should not be sold. It makes no
difference if that intrusion is by a peice of luggage, tuba case, or
hip-flesh.
If a passenger makes a seat next to them unavailable/unsuitable for
the safe use of another passenger, that passenger should reimburse the
airline (if the airline actually needs the seat on that flight.)
Any other answer to this implies that the fat person sees nothing
wrong with forcing their fellow passengers to have less space than
they have-for the same price.
Greed is not a &quot;human rights issue.&quot;

a bit of a space problem here, could one of us be reseated?' I received
a, &quot;sorry, we can't do that&quot; reply. On one flight I spent two hours in the
back galley area of the aircraft, leaning against a bulkhead and reading
my book. One FA was somewhat insistent that I return to my seat until,
at my suggestion, she looked at the situation -- and noticed that about
half the seat I was to occupy was actually available -- and then curtailed
her demands.

"/> It's not about weight, or volume. It's about whether you can fit into a
single seat, or need more room. That's all the airlines, and other
passengers, care about.

Trains, buses and boats that operate on a one-passenger-per-seat basis will
have similar requirements.

And airlines have shrunken the width of airline seats (with the exception of
some older widebody aircraft. There are just as many (or as few) seats
across as there always have been. What has shrunk is seat pitch, the
distance from the back of your seat to the back of the seat in front of you.

And, whereas that impacts customers of size who are taller than normal, it
does not impact customers of size who are wider than normal.

The problem isn't the airline.

both.
If they want to charge extra for a few inches worth of room,
fine. But
why double the fare if all you need is two or three extra horizontal
inches and
a bit of room for your legs? My legs are not so long and they fit

&gt;I agree that airlines in general *are* being arbitary about their
&gt;policies on this. Having had to deal with a situation of having an
&gt;adjacent passenger substantially spill into *my* seat that I paid for
&gt;THREE times, I do wish that they would be more consistent in
&gt;application of their own regulations.

&gt;&gt;and is discriminating against fat
&gt;&gt;people in making them buy two seats.

&gt;&gt;If this &quot;fat&quot; lady is traveling with two children and they occupy
&gt;&gt;three seats what freaken right does the airline have to MAKE her buy a
&gt;&gt;fourth ticket?

&gt;I had commented on this earlier in the other crossposted thread. I
&gt;think they should have left her alone, since she did pay for the
&gt;seats. However, I did speculate that they may have done so as to
&gt;*not* to set a precedent that obese passengers are *sometimes* allowed
&gt;to purchase only one ticket for themselves.

&gt;(this inconsistency could come back to bite them on the ass when it
&gt;comes to litigation)

&gt;&gt;Additionally, if the &quot;fat&quot; lady is traveling with her husband and he
&gt;&gt;sits in the middle seat and the lady sits in the aisle seat what
&gt;&gt;freaken right does SWA have for trying to make the lady buy an
&gt;&gt;additional ticket?

&gt;Generally, I think that if her husband is fine with sharing his seat
&gt;with his wife and they in no way impinge on the other passenger, they
&gt;should be left alone.

"/> Well, perhaps a &quot;travelling in same party&quot; sort of exception can be put into
policy, but then (as you understand per what you've said above) you can get into
situations like an obese person travelling with their child, booking two of
three seats in a section. They may or may not still spill over into the third
seat.

Maybe a hard-and-fast policy that any passenger who desires to have the arm rest
down has a right to that, leaving the discomfort and hassles, and decisions, to
the pax who would find that too confining.

to the ground, then complained that I was knocking into people on the
train. I might say that the train is too small, or people might say
'put your fucking arms down!'.

intelligent rational debate rather than proposing that people be put

like crates in a lorry just so fat people have enough room for their
massive rolls of lard.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What other common form of transportation charges people by

"/> You pay for places on the trips. A train is similar to a plane, if
you're oozing into someone else's seat then the same policies should
apply as on a plane. The same goes for buses and boats. Taxis are
different as you pay for the whole taxi and can take up as much room
as you like. The analogy would be if a fat person chartered the entire
plane. Then she could ooze everwhere she wanted, as long as it didn't
violate the safety rules.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why should planes be any different?

"/> They're not, they're all based on seats paid for individually, and
nowhere is it acceptable to use someone else's seat as well as your
own. You don't go to a restaurant and start eating some of someone
else's food because you've got some disorder that makes you more
hungry, you buy a second meal. If you went to a stranger and started
eating his food he'd boot you in the face, and so when a fat person
oozes into someone else's seat they should be made to leave the plane
or buy another seat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And if it's ONLY about
&gt; weight,
&gt; why discriminate against people with wider hips?

be subject to the same policy, although I don't know of people that
large. Seems that wideness is self-inflicted rather than genetic.

These situations can be solved by having a solid policy that you're
not allowed to trespass on someone else's seat, full stop. If this is
enforced consistenty then you know EXACTLY what you're getting before
you get on the plane, and so you have no room for complaints.

"/> Not necessarily the amount:

I have a frighteningly enormous appetite, yet my BMI is rarely as
high as 25.1, usually ranging between 24.5 and 24.9. It's not how
much I eat but what I eat:

I eat everything but avoid foods high in sugar, fat, and salt as well
as fried foods and so-called foods devoid of nutritional value. By
&quot;avoid&quot; I don't mean I don't eat stuff high in salt, fat, and sugar
and fried foods (some fried chicken tonight) because I do, but I do
so so seldom as to not have an adverse effect upon my health or body.

I attended parties with buffets last night and tonight. Last night's
was heavy on sushi, prawns, vegetables, fruit, and . I also had a
small piece of cake.

Tonight's included prime rib, salad, chorizo, clams, mussels, fried
chicken, crab cakes, and a whole buncha other stuff I ate but don't
know what was. Both nights, I was among the first in line and, when
it had diminished, went through again filling my plate just as high
the second time as the first. Last night a woman commented &quot;You won't
have to eat tomorrow&quot;. Hah!

I believe you're the one who confessed to having an incredible

measured, over three layers of clothing and a BMI of 24.9, at
thirty-seven inches, about 16½ inches across when seated. There's 17½

For every larger seat they make, they will have to take another seat
out. That will decrease the revenue they can get per flight. So, they
will have to either raise the fares per seat, or absorb the loss in some
other way. It's simple arithmetic. Are you capable of that?

Right now, most of the major carriers are in or near bankruptcy, in case
you haven't noticed. USAir is about to go bankrupt a second time.

As usual, you and the rest of your fat-is-good cohort expect the rest of
us to pay for you. You expect to be able to share our seats on a plane,
you expect us to pay for heavy lifting equipment in hospitals, the list
goes on. Well, we're not going to. So, buck up and buy two seats, fatso.

&gt;There is a concept of addictive personality. There is a correlation between
&gt;nicotine addiction and poker machine addiction. If one were addicted to
&gt;nicotine, why not recognize your analog with food addiction? By the way, my
&gt;daughter brought up food on an airplane once. Unpleasant for all concerned.

&gt;abacus.

"/> Well, yes, there can be an addiction to food. Indeed I think that's often the
problem. Which kinda blows away the fat-as-just-the-way-I-am acceptance idea,
doesn't it? Unless we're also willing to go in for hollow-eyed-and-eroded-nose
cocaine's-just-the-way-I-am, or emphysemea-ridden nicotine's-just-the-way-I-am.
Going back again to how it's pathological.

But in a practical sense as far as airplanes and food, no one has stated that
food should be denied anyone (served or carry-on) on an airplane flight. Nor is
food, unlike smoking, a substance that spreads to affect everyone in an
immediate sense. So how food is may or may not be a necessity on a flight has
nothing to do with buying airplane seats. So it coming up the way it did is
really odd.

The point I'm making is that, just because someone can point to some
distinguishing characteristic, likes-to-be-drunk, or wears-jeans-too-tight,
has-eaten-way-much-for-way-too-long, nicotine-addicted, or whatever, does not
make them a member of some persecuted minority with some particular need to be
perfectly accomodated or it's &quot;Discrimination&quot;. We got past that when capital-S
&quot;Smoker's&quot; were pulling out the &quot;Discrimination&quot; lingo, and we really need to
get past this &quot;Fat&quot; or &quot;Person of Size&quot; equal-rights contortion of the language
of human rights.

"/> children unfortunately dn't always organize their barfing as efficiently
asmost adult do -- although my best friend's 14 year old son once
experienced a particularly dreadful adult barfing event. The man behind
him hurled over the top of the seat in front of him and all over this
kid on TAKE OFF for an intercontinental flight -- The poor kid was
covered with this guys barf and had to sit in his rinsed out smelly
shirt for 9 hours.

The FAs paid little attention to the kid's needs at first denying that
such a thing could have happened when his Mom went to get help. Then
they moved the barfing guy into first class to make him more comfortable
leaving the kid to clean his own seat and wash out his shirt.

I used to pack a change of clothes on a long flight -- but once kids are
past the early years, I think lots of people overlook this possible need
-- once this happened to poor David, I got back in the habit of making
sure I had at least a clean shirt in my carry on stuff.
