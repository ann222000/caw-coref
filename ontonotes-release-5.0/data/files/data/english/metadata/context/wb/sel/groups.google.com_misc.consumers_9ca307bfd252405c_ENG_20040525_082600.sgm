In the space of less than one week:

Walked into a local Carl's Jr with a friend, ordered two combos
and one small side salad. The guy behind the counter said, &quot;That'll
be $19.50&quot;. My friend and I looked at each other. $19.50? The
clerk appeared to look over the receipt and said, &quot;Yes, $19.50&quot;.
We asked him to start over and ring it up again. This time he came
up with $12.95.

The following day we drove through KFC, where 90% of the time
our order is missing at least one item. Never, ever more than we
ordered -- always less.

Then we went to Safeway, picked up two packs of hot dogs for a
picnic. They were clearly marked &quot;buy one, get one free&quot;. We
checked the receipt later.. yep, we got charged for both packs.

I could go on citing dozens of other examples over the last year
or so, but the theme here is the same. An occasional mistake is
understandable, but it really seems like something else lately.
You pay for x, you get x - y. Anyone else having the same
experience?

Check your order before you leave the window. When you notice a discrepancy,
politely inform the window-droid and then wait for the extras that were
missed. Then wait for the shift manager to come to the window to comp you a
dessert or an extra side. Yes, you will cause those behind you the minor
inconvenience of an extra three-to-five minute wait but your order wasn't
correct and that &quot;90% of the time&quot; is worth their inconvenience.

After about three visits, you'll notice that _your_ orders' accuracy
suddenly improves.

"/> In Michigan, there's a law that if a supermarket rings up the
wrong price, then you get $1.00 plus 10 times the
difference--whether the difference is in your favor or the
store's--up to a $5.00 total limit. Plus, stores are required to
individually tag items with prices (not just on the shelf) so you
can easily verify that prices are correct at the cash register.

We could really use a law like this in California.

"/> [ overcharges and missing items ]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I could go on citing dozens of other examples over the
&gt; last year or so, but the theme here is the same. An
&gt; occasional mistake is understandable, but it really
&gt; seems like something else lately.

"/> I've noticed this as well. I believe that there are two
factors at work here. In the case of fast food restau-
rants, it's that most of the employees are adolescents,
many of whom have gnatlike attention spans and poor atten-
tion to detail -- partly by nature and partly thanks to
the video game/MTV culture they live in. And particularly
in the case of girls, they're often distracted by social-
izing with other employees.

People aren't born with the focus and self-discipline
necessary for them to be good employees, even at unskilled
jobs like those at Burger King and McDonald's. Sometimes
it's imparted by effective parenting, but it usually has
to be taught on the job. And since even the managers are
now mostly from the same generation as the rank and file
employees, we have a declining situation where figuratively
speaking, the blind are more and more often being led by
the blind.

(Yeah, yeah; I know -- people have *always* heaped derision
on &quot;kids nowadays.&quot; That doesn't mean it's never justified.)

I *always* open the bag and check my order before driving
away from the window at a fast food place. If they haven't
actually screwed up my order, they'll often have neglected
to give me any napkins at the very least.

In the case of being charged for both items at supermarkets
when you're supposed to get two for one, this is a byproduct
of the computerized pricing system that large food stores
use nowadays. The trouble with such systems is that the
associated databases need to be kept up to date, and that's
also something that requires discipline and attention to
detail -- which many employees lack, or they wouldn't be
working at supermarkets to begin with. I always watch the
LED readout attached to the register as my groceries are
being rung up, so that I can spot any errors.

You know what I miss? Price tags. Actual paper price tags
that are attached to merchandise with adhesive backings. One
always knew where he stood with those, as far as how much
things cost was concerned.

&quot;Hmm, there's no price on this. It must be free.&quot;

"/> All of which are trivial. The labeling equipment is a one-time
expense; they're simple mechanical devices. (Okay, the addit-
ional cost of those nifty leather holsters needs to be factored
in as well. Still, it's a one-time expense, and a relatively
low one, at that.

And the cost of the labels themselves is inconsequential relative
to the cost of -- and more to the point, the profit margin on --
the typical item. Why, those labels must cost all of a fraction
of a cent apiece, especially in the quantities in which stores
would be buying them. The horror!

Then there's the time, and therefore the expense, that it would
take for employees to apply price tags to items. I find that in
many retail establishments (especially, but not exclusively,
supermarkets), cashiers tend to slap down the &quot;Register Closed&quot;
sign the instant the final customer in a group has gone through,
and then to disappear into the back room of the store on break
or head out front to huff a cancerette.

Curiously, I never see these people restocking shelves, pushing
a broom, or making themselves otherwise useful. This indicates
that properly managed, they could typically be employed far more
productively than they are.

In fact, I think anyone who opposes Wal-Mart is an idiot whose

The implicit goal of any mass-market retail operation is to bring
the most merchandise possible to the most customers possible at
the lowest price possible -- thereby generating the most profits
possible by virtue of the economies of scale. Some lament the
effect this has on mom-and-pop operations and on downtown areas.

My position on that? Boo friggin' hoo. Time is passing these
more traditional operations by. If there's a retail model that
can bring more goods to a bigger marketplace more cheaply than
others, then obviously, it deserves to succeed and lesser retail-
ing models deserve to go the way of _le deaudeau_. Get over it,
already.

The times that the customer is to blame is when they:

Wait until everything has been rung up before fumbling for their check
book, writing out the check, deducting it from the ledger and then
fumbling again for their ID.(These are the same people who make an ATM
transaction and insist on updating their checkbook before leaving the
machine.)

Remembering after everything is rung up that they forgot something.
When this happens I suggest that the checker ring up the total, get the
payment and then let the customer come back when they find the item. At
times I have told the checker that rather than wait I will leave.

People who spend time fumbling for 8 cents because it is inconvenient
for them to carry 92 cents around but it is not inconvenient for the
rest of us to wait.

People at a fast food place who, after 5 minutes on line , suddenly
figure out that they have to decide what to order and start saying
&quot;uh,uh, let me have, uh&quot;. It makes me miss New York where the worker
will just point to the next person as say &quot;Next&quot;.

Another pet peeve: The problem transaction at a bank. Never know whose
fault it is (usually a customer not understanding something) but there
should be a bank rule that if a teller can not resolve a problem in a
few minutes it should be turned over to someone higher up.

The cost of the labellers and labels might seem trivial to
you, but you are vastly overestimating the profit margin of
food items at grocery stores. A typical profit on a can of
soup is 2-3 cents. They rely on (enormous) volumes and a
handful of higher profit items -- most of which are already
individually priced, like meat and bakery goods, for their
money. When I was a kid, grocery stores used to price every
item individually. There were always people in the aisles
pricing things. Minimum wage was much cheaper then.

And it didn't really solve any problems. There were still
mispriced goods, switched labels, and things that didn't get
retagged before or after sales.

&gt; In the space of less than one week:

&gt; Walked into a local Carl's Jr with a friend, ordered two combos
&gt; and one small side salad. The guy behind the counter said, &quot;That'll
&gt; be $19.50&quot;. My friend and I looked at each other. $19.50? The
&gt; clerk appeared to look over the receipt and said, &quot;Yes, $19.50&quot;.
&gt; We asked him to start over and ring it up again. This time he came
&gt; up with $12.95.

&gt; The following day we drove through KFC, where 90% of the time
&gt; our order is missing at least one item. Never, ever more than we
&gt; ordered -- always less.

&gt; Then we went to Safeway, picked up two packs of hot dogs for a
&gt; picnic. They were clearly marked &quot;buy one, get one free&quot;. We
&gt; checked the receipt later.. yep, we got charged for both packs.

&gt; I could go on citing dozens of other examples over the last year
&gt; or so, but the theme here is the same. An occasional mistake is
&gt; understandable, but it really seems like something else lately.
&gt; You pay for x, you get x - y. Anyone else having the same
&gt; experience?

&gt; Mike

"/> Yep, particularly with the fast food places at the drive-up window, and the
cashiers then often get upset because I take the time to check the bag for
what I ordered before I pull away.

The wierdest one lately was when I went through the drive-up and ordered a
small sundae which was something like $1.40. I had my exact change ready
by the time I got to the pick-up window (which was also serving as the &quot;pay
at&quot; window because it was off regular peak hours). The guy said &quot;that will
be $6.89&quot;, and had two bags sitting there. I said &quot;for what&quot;, and he said
it was something like two combos. I told him all I ordered was a
strawberry sundae. He reached behind him and got the sundae, handed it to
me and said &quot;That will be $6.89&quot; again! I said, &quot;the hell it will, it's
$1.40&quot;, I put my exact change on his counter, took my sundae from him and
left. He looked so completely perplexed, like he didn't get the connection
between the food ordered and the amount collected!

The other thing that is a problem by me is because at least half of the
staff are non-English speaking (at least not good English). I don't think
I've ever asked for &quot;Ranch&quot; dressing and not gotten French, no matter how
clearly I say it. If I ask for anything that isn't standard menu (like fish
sandwich no cheese), they have no idea what I'm saying.

Then their latest -- the Adult Happy meal, which is advertised (in the
picture at least) as a salad, a pedometer and a water -- but I was told that
the price advertised includes a soft drink -- if you want a water or a milk,
it's an upsell. That was a fun conversation with the drive-up guy too.

Apparently that's too subtle a distinction for many in the

If one is really considerate, one would bring the error to
the attention of th windowdroid -- and then pull out of the
drive-through line and get his missing item at the counter
inside. It wouldn't take any longer to get the missing stuff,
and the drive-through line would continue to move. Everybody
wins.

Of course, people are going to grasp about wildly for reasons
to object to that approach, since it would involve a proactive
deviation from their normal routine. What they'll probably come
up with is something petty, perhaps an objection along the lines
of, &quot;B-but...I shouldn't have to lift my pimply b'hind off the

bordering on insufferably so.

Just as puns are the lowest form of humor, accusations of hypo-
crisy are the lowest form of discourse. Why? Because they don't
address actual ideas, but merely the placement of ideas within the
debate.

What's worse, people are often so eager to show how clever they
are by pouncing on what they believe to be hypocrisy that it
blinds them to the subleties of the actual discussion. Take
you, for instance. Walking through the tall grass of the dis-
ciussion, you stepped on the tines of the point I was making
and ended up getting smacked in the face by the rake handle
of my retort. Shame, shame. I bet you feel about an inch
tall now, don't you? And well that you should.

workarounds, it fails to address the actual problem, which is
that merchandise sometimes isn't properly tagged.

Besides, it would mean going to Staples or wherever and buying

"/> What a sloshing bucket of tiger tinkle. &quot;An actual study
with statistical controls and everything&quot; might provide
formal validation, but the lack of one hardly means that
individual experiences and observations are groundless
or illusory.

I find that when people make objections such as yours and
grasp at the lack of formal studies as an excuse not to
take someone's personal observations seriously, it's in-
variably because either (1) they aren't attentive enough
themselves to have made the same observation, or (2) the
observation runs afoul of their sensibilities in some way
or other, and so they're in denial.

Example: Maybe a decade ago I made the observation that
there was a striking, even overwhelming, preference for
the Toyota Camry among Chinese living in the Bay Area.
Pointing this out in various newsgroups always raised
howls of protest. &quot;There've been no Studies(tm)! You
have no Scientific Data(tm) to back that up!&quot; And even,
&quot;You're a racist!&quot;

Even today, a decade later, I maintain that 80-90% of
the Toyota Camrys I see on the roads of the Bay Area
are driven by Chinese. The acrimony over my obser-
vations only made me more attentive, and I stand by
what I've always said about this. And since this
correlation is readily apparent to anyone who cares
to look, it's clear that something other than a point
of order about scientific rigor was at play as far as
people's skepticism was concerned.

What that was, was a reflexive bristling at any attempt
to make generalizations about groups of people -- partic-
ularly those made in an ethnic or racial context. Nobody
wants to believe that anybody &quot;has their number.&quot; (Which,
of course, doesn't mean that nobody actually does.) People
didn't like the abstract idea of that, and so they went
immediately into denial.

A few even went on the attack -- although why noticing
some group's preference for a certain make and model
of car indicates a belief on the observer's part in
that group's racial inferiority was a mystery to me.
This was an issue of culture, not of race per se.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> I knew it, I knew it, I *knew* it! Sure enough, it was

Some react so strongly to generalizations about people
that it's tainted their attitude toward personal obser-
vation in general.

It's fashionable to object to generalizations on the
basis that they're not true 100% of the time. Well,
yeah; that's why they're called &quot;generalizations.&quot;
Therefore, that objection is a strawman.

By the way, there's no need to capitalize &quot;black.&quot; It's
an adjective, not a proper noun. (I note that many who
capitalize &quot;black&quot; also conspicuously fail to capitalize
&quot;white.&quot; That's obviously a symptom of liberal guilt and
self-loathing.)

"/> I'd noticed the conversion of drive-up windows to ATMs, but I
guess I assumed it was the same way everywhere.

I had an interesting experience in Arizona early in my ATM-
using life, as a matter of fact. It was in Sierra Vista,
where I had the questionable fortune of living for a year
back in the '80s while working at Fort Upchuck.

One Saturday morning I drove into the parking lot of the First
Interstate branch I banked at in order to use the ATM. Just as
I was pulling into a parking space, I noticed a sizeable knot of
people standing around outside the front door. (The branch was
due to open within a few minutes.) Swearing to myself, I assumed
that the reason they were there was because the ATM was down yet
again. I wheeled around and drove out of the parking lot,
wondering what I was going to do for money that weekend.

I got about half a block when I realized that all those people
I'd seen waiting for the bank to open were old folks (Sierra
Vista is something of a retirement haven). Hitting the brakes
and turning around, I though to myself that it'd be just like
old people to be skittish about using one of those newfangled
automatic teller machines and to insist on old-fashioned, face-
to-face contact with an actual human when they conducted their
business. Sure enough, I was right: it turned out that the ATM
was working just fine.

A corollary to this mindset is the way that not only will some
people give higher precedence to the phone than to people, but
will also treat all new calls as more important than the one
they're currently on.

on the basis that there'd been no formal studies, the lack
of formal studies would mean that their skepticism was as
just as unfounded as my observation, and for precisely the
same reason.

They'd have just as much reason to believe me as not, but
they choose not to -- and no for any compelling, defensible
reason. They wouldn't be able to claim I was wrong on the
basis of any empirical data, because there wouldn't be any.
That sword cuts both ways.

So that leaves only two other possibilities: either my
observation offends their sensibilies for some reason,
or they simply aren't observant enough to have noticed
what I noticed. Neither of which is grounds for skep-
ticism. Q.E. effin' D. Badda-bing, badda-boom. Send

Besides, when I said &quot;invariably&quot; in my original post, it
was out of actual experience: because in debates such as
those, subsequent discussion always (yes, _always_) revealed
these people's true prejudices. I've seen this little drama

"/>  A similar thing happens at the race track. When I started going
everything was done with a live clerk. Each window was dedicated to a
particular bet (i.e, $2 win,$5 show). You walked up to the $2 Win window
and simply said &quot;5&quot; and you got a $2 win ticket on number 5. There were
a smaller amount of dedicated windows for cashing winning bets (that
used to be a lesson for first timers) so if you bet $2 win and $5 show
and the horse won you had to cash in at two different windows. I should
also add that at that time each track only took wagers on their own
races.
Now you have the choice between a live teller or a machine. You can
start by buying a voucher from a clerk or a machine. You insert the
voucher in a machine ,pick a track, an amount and type of wager, accept
the bet and you get a ticket with the bet and a new voucher minus the
old amount. If the bet wins you insert the ticket in the machine, it
displays the payout, you add your voucher and get a new one from the
machine.
Like the bank some people still prefer a live person. Those lines are
much longer because now you have to say &quot;Hollywood Park, race 3, two
dollars win number 5 and two dollars show, number 5&quot;. Many times I see a
long line at the live window with plenty of unused machines. as the
horses are entering the gate. As soon as the gate opens the machines,
both manned and automatic can no longer issue bets on that race.
Invariably people will yell at the clerk or or the customer in the
front of the line if they got shut out when they could have easily used
the machine.
By the way, the track has its own version of the people who look for
their checkbook after everything has been totaled. They get to the
machine and start looking at the Racing Form or their program trying to
decide what to do. I was told the first time I went to the track that
you don't get on line until you know what you want to do. Others are
making numerous bets such as several horses in each leg on the Pick 6
and have to review their notes to see what they picked. There are slips
similar to those used in the lottery that allow you to do those things
beforehand. You then simply place your voucher and the slip in the
machine and are done in about three seconds. I have asked people why
they don't do this and the replies are &quot;too complicated&quot; or &quot;takes too
much time&quot;.

&gt;&gt;It's just as annoying when they wait until the order is totally

&gt;&gt;On the subject of checks: the person (typically a senior) who
&gt;&gt;insists on writing out the check themselves (slowly, of course)
&gt;&gt;rather than letting the register print it for them. I ran into
&gt;&gt;this at Costco recently where some woman was taking forever to
&gt;&gt;write out a check. She said something about it took so long and
&gt;&gt;I told her &quot;not if you'd have just given the blank check to the
&gt;&gt;cashier&quot;. She was clueless, had no idea that she could have done
&gt;&gt;it that way apparently.

&gt;I haven't run across a retailer that has that capability.

I read somewhere that many customers are extremely skittish
about taking merchandise that's in any way different from
other items of the same type, even if the difference is
something inconsequential. The classic example is dented
cans. I wonder if the same mentality applies to merchandise
that's found in the wrong section, like, say, a can of peaches
abandoned on the toothpaste shelf.

Something else along those lines that I've noticed is that
many people won't take the top copy of a newspaper when they
buy a paper from a machine. Instead they'll reach in under-
neath and take one of the copies from lower down, as though
the top newspaper has cooties or something. Bizarre.

Then there was the time when the top copy was soaking wet, in spite

in more of a hurry not taking the top copy.

Y'know, Steve, I purchased a book recently that made me
think of you. It's a collection of columns by a woman
after my own heart named Florence King. Until recently
she had a regular feature in _National Review_ called
The Misanthrope's Corner, which should give you a basic
indication of her style. I've only read the first
chapter at this point and I can tell already that the
tome is going to be a treasure trove of .sig quotes.

Writing of Americans' descent into mealy-mouthedness due
to the fear of giving offense, King says:

&quot;Our diversity kills the spontaneity that
wit must have. Our worst nightmare is
that backbone of wit, the generalization.
Samuel Johnson's quip, 'If you give a
Scot something, he'll either break it or
drink it,' would cause mass cardiac arrest
in the land of the free and the home of
Jimmy the Greek. Jesse Jackson and Ted
Kennedy would go on _Nightline_ and wail,
'Some Scots are clumsy drunks but the
vast majority of Scottish-Americans are
well educated and responsible citizens.'

"/> She ought to have one. I think she's hilarious, and so do a
lot of other people. Stand-up may not be precisely her chosen
medium. but she gets off a good line far more often than most
political pundits do. A couple of my personal faves are these
gems from her book _Slander_:

&quot;Even Islamic terrorists don't hate America like liberals
do. They don't have the energy. If they had that much
energy, they'd have indoor plumbing by now.&quot;

and

&quot;Here the country had finally given liberals a war against
fundamentalism and they don't want to fight it. They would,
except it would put them on the same side as the United
States.&quot;

Now, I ask you: what's not to like?

In fact, the only people I've encountered who don't get a
chuckle out of Ann Coulter are liberals...partly because
so much of wehat she writes is at theor expense, of course,
but mainly because they have no sense of humor and take
themselves, and the world, so goddam seriously. No,
instead of laughing at her wonderfully caustic prose, they
stamp their tiny little feet in outrage and put up pissy
Web sites in a lame, day-late, dollar-short attempt to
rebut her.

Of course, one needs to have an appreciation of wallpaper-
peeling sarcasm in order to appreciate Ann Coulter. But
then, that's something possessed by far more conservatives
than liberals. After all, the more things one can laugh
at and about, the greater one's sense of humor. Liberals
think sarcasm is _mean-spirited_ and _insensitive_ and all
those other nasty things.

What it boils down to is that liberalism is a fundamentally
emotional orientation, while conservatism is far more rational
and intellectually based. Conservatives think; liberals _emote_.
And like the man said, the world is a comedy to those who think
and a tragedy to those who feel.

No, the point of the passage you're responding to above was
&quot;the tendency of liberals to regard liberalism as the natural

conceit, and (to tie all this up with a neat little bow) the
author of the snippet you quoted demonstrated it admirably.

"/> That's a rather tendentious interpretation. I really doubt
that George W. Bush invented the concept of delegating to
subalterns, don't you? I mean, you folks give him credit
for so little else; why the sudden magnanimity?

Not that I expect consistency from liberals. Look at the
way they screech about Bush's going into Iraq without UN
approval, even though it didn't bother them at all that
Clinton did the same thing in Kosovo. Whoops!

Given all the hostility toward Bush, I don't blame the man
for having questions pre-screened by his underlings -- if
in fact that's even what he does. It strikes me as the sort
of thing he may have done once or twice under specific cir-
cumstances (if even then), and that took on a life of its
own due to being blown out of proportion by the usual horde
of hysterical lefty yammerheads. Where's a decent water
cannon now that I need one?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So why are we supposed to trust him?

"/> Considering what you wrote above, maybe a more immediate
question is why you're supposed to *hate* him. Even if
what you said about the screening of questions is true,
outright hatred is a little strong.

Which is to be expected, really. The Left is downright
psychotic with rage at Bush, and the way y'all will
incoherently seize on one unrelated thing after another
and treat every little thing, no matter how trivial, as
though it should be regarded as a fatal show-stopper for
the Bush Administration makes you look crazier than
shithouse mice.

And you'd have us trust the custodianship of the country
to the likes of you or anyone you'd approve of, like
that pompous git Kerry or &quot;Animatronic Al&quot; Gore? It is
to laugh.

(Strange but true: You can order an actual pair of John
Kerry &quot;flip-flop&quot; sandals through townhall.com. Or

What color is the sky on your planet?

It's interesting that you claim he's Xanax-addicted and
obviously hold it against him. Usually, liberals prefer
to euphemize drug addiciton as &quot;substance dependency&quot;
and to regard it as an illness, not a moral failure.
Funny how their perception changed and they were suddenly
made of sterner stuff when it was Rush Limbaugh who was
addicted, and now (allegedly) Bush.

If Bush is re-elected, will you promise to leave the
country? I've been thinking of setting up a Web site
the purpose of which would be to hook up liberals who
make such a pledge with conservatives who'd volunteer
to help them pack.

celebrities (Alec Baldwin et al.), said that they'd leave if
Bush were elected -- the first time. What with the steadily
rising level of liberal anti-Bush rage since then, such pro-
nouncements can only have gone up. These people don't need

"/> Reality is unpalatable to liberals, and so they take
delusional refuge in an alternate universe that's
founded on wishful thinking. For instance, there was
all the caterwauling before the invasion of Iraq about
bloody house-to-house fghting in Baghdad. It never
happened -- but the liberals wanted it to, and so
they convinced themselves that it would.

Then there was the braying about a quagmire when the
troops paused on the way to Baghdad. That turned out
to be because they were moving so fast that they'd
outrun their supply lines. So, no quagmire -- but
the liberals wanted for there to be one, and so that's
what they made themselves believe was going to happen.
Even long before there was any objective basis for
such a prediction.

Neither of those predictions had any basis in reality.
Which should hardly come as any surprise when you
stop to consider that lefties tend to be dumber than
a bowl of mice when it comes to grasping anything
having to do with the military or with the nuts and
bolts of warfighting. Actually knowing anything
about such matters would be morally tainting, you
see. They just know they don't like war. They saw
&quot;The Killing Fields,&quot; after all.

Yet a third example of this syndrome of self-delusion
is the way liberals insist that Bush &quot;lied&quot; about WMDs
-- even though his receiving faulty intel is a simpler,
and therefore far more likely, explanation. And indeed,
it's the documented one. But they _want_ Bush to have
lied, and so they've convinced themselves that he did.

Another sort of mental gymnastics you people engage in
is the way you always insist on placing the worst
possible interpretation on things when it serves your
purposes to do so. Example: Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root got
that contract. But since Cheney used to be in the
employ of Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root's holding company, the
only possible interpretation, the liberals believe, is
that the fix is in. Apparently there's no room in the
liberals' mental universe for the possibility, however
remote, that KB&amp;R got the contract for legitimate
reasons.

Now, it may eventually turn out that the fix *was* in.
But don't feel vindicated, liberals, because (subtle
distinction alert) *you still would've had no basis
for believing that was the case right off the bat.*

Say, I hear there's a free screening of &quot;The Day After
Tomorrow&quot; down at your local googleplex. It should
be starting right about now. If you hurry, you can
catch it. Run along, now.

Fernando Valley hardly means that the whole enterprise is
doomed to failure...the Left's defeatist naysaying notwith-
standing.

(And that's another thing liberals have been prone to: the
instant-gratification &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; syndrome. That
certain things haven't happened _yet_ is taken as incontro-
vertible evidence that they won't or can't happen. For
example, a friend of mine claims that we'll never get bin
Laden. Why? Because we haven't yet? &quot;So exactly how
long is something like this supposed to take,&quot; I asked
him? He got curiously quiet at that point.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;and eat at McDonald's? Sure, they are the largest in their respective
&gt;&gt;&gt;markets, but it doesn't mean that everyone shops there. As I said in
&gt;&gt;&gt;another thread, I have never shopped at Walmart here in Los Angeles.
&gt;&gt;&gt;And the last time I ate at McDonald's was more than 6 years ago. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;eat at In&amp;Out, Baja Fresh, Quizno's, but not at McDonald's. I think
&gt;&gt;&gt;the population of Los Angeles is over 50,000.

&gt;&gt;Thanks for the response. But as a Californian I cannot trust the
&gt;&gt;cultural milieu you are exposed to, especially in LA.
&gt;&gt;I am sorry if there is any offense, but none intended.
&gt;&gt;In case you didn't know, we fell into the ocean sometime in the
&gt;&gt;mid-sixties, and no longer are connected to America. 'Off the chart',
&gt;&gt;I think is the expression.

&gt;I just used the Walmart's store locator, and from zip code 90277, the
&gt;closest Walmart is 11 miles away. According to you, the cultural
&gt;environment I'm exposed to prevents me from driving 11 miles to go to
&gt;Walmart, making me instead drive 3 miles to the nearest Target store.

"/> Commuting to work affords me to pass two per day, twice, and next to
it is another BORG. For those of us who plan our limited time,
necessity becomes paramount. Oh, and for the most, Walmart is cheaper
than Target, but I do support Martha Stewart.

&gt; Hmm... I suppose Samuel Clemens was &quot;cowardly&quot; because
&gt; he used a &quot;nom de plume&quot; - Mark Twain - for his public
&gt; writings? And actors who use stage names are cowards,
&gt; too, right?

"/> I realize that you understand perfectly well what I meant
and are arguing just to argue, since that's your _shtick_.

And I also understand that you're going to do your usual
&quot;Energizer Bunny&quot; impression and argue about this until
the heat death of the universe, in the childish belief
that victory can be achieved by getting the last word.
But hey, I'll run with it.

It depends on the context and on the motive. An actor who
changes his name from something lackluster, difficult to
pronounce, or excessively foreign-sounding to something
simple, catchy and memorable like, say, &quot;Rock Hudson&quot;
clearly doesn't do it in order to try and conceal his
identity. After all, publicity is what actors want, not
something they recoil from. That's not cowardice.

Noms de plume can be cowardly or not, again depending on
the intent. Sam Clemens obviously wasn't trying to con-
ceal his true identity, but merely wanted to employ a
catchier name than his own -- one which alluded to the
riverboats in the locale that he wrote about. On the
other hand, the author of _Primary Colors_ was concealing
his name for less lofty reasons.

Scott in Aztlán blathers ever onward:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sales calls have nothing to do with a listed telephone number,
&gt; and you know it. Sales calls are made with automated dialing
&gt; equipment that systematically calls every number in a given
&gt; exchange, listed or not. Do Not Call lists change this slightly,
&gt; but being unlisted has virtually no effect.

"/> No, I _don't_ know it. Many larger outfits do use automated
dialing equipment, but not all. The sort of local, community
based organizations that can be found in my area are less
likely to have access to that sort of set-up than an organ-
ization with national reach like, say, Citibank or AT&amp;T.

No solution is perfect. Avoiding unwanted calls involves
plugging more than one type of hole. Do-not-call lists
are one approach; unlisted numbers are another.

And more to the point, what's this got to do with cowardice?
It's possible to have your number listed in the phone book
but not your address, you know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Opinions (and facts, for that matter) stand on their own
&gt; merit; the words in the header of the USENET post are
&gt; irrelevant.

"/> In an ideal world, sure. But we both know what they say
about ideal worlds. You and I may believe that opinions
stand on their own merit, but not everyone does. Some
people, especially liberals, can be very vindictive when
they encounter opinions (or facts, for that matter) which
run counter to their sensibilities.

And it's not far-fetched that prospective employers could
conceivably Google for someone's Usenet postings in order
to gain some understanding of what sort of person he is,
or how likely he is to &quot;play well with others&quot; if hired.
&quot;Conceivably,&quot; hell; I've actually heard of this happening,
from people I trust. Others I know haven't actually done
it, but would if they were in that sort of position.

Be that as it may, anyone who worries about that sort of
thing to the point of concealing his identity on the Net
is a flippin' coward. Anyone with any balls would let
the chips fall where they may. If nothing else, pissing
people off with what you write is an excellent filtering
mechanism: I'd prefer not to work for the sort of person
who'd scan Usenet for my posts anyway, let alone one who'd
scan Usenet for my posts and then reject me for the opinions
and personality that I let show therein. Fuggem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How do I know that &quot;Geoff Miller&quot; is even your real name?

"/> Strictly speaking, you don't. Then again, unless it's
something clearly made-up like &quot;Mike Hunt&quot; or &quot;Seymour
Butts&quot; (or my personal fave, &quot;Creighton Beryll&quot;), the
odds are pretty good that a normal-sounding name is a
_real_ name.

Since Usenet is a medium of self-expression, it stands
to reason that if someone were going to come up with
a fake name to post under, they'd be a little more
creative than choosing some plain-vanilla moniker
like &quot;John Smith&quot; -- or &quot;Geoff Miller.&quot;

The real nail in the coffin of your argument, though,
is that we're not talking about people who post under
names that _might_ be real. This got started when
I berated somebody for posting under the username
&quot;anonymous.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The fact is, I don't know - and I don't care. My
&gt; discussions with you are based solely on the merit
&gt; of your words, not on whether I know the name on
&gt; your birth certificate.

"/> I'll almost always carry on a discussion with an
anonymous poster regardless of whether I get on
his ass for posting anonymously. When I don't,
it's generally because the person is an asshole
and I want to twist the blade. Either way, I
make no apologies. Anyone who doesn't like that
is encouraged to put a lip-lock on a Remington.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Friends don't let friends shop at Best Buy.

"/> You never told me why you're obsessed with Best Buy.
There's one not far from where I work, at a shopping
center where I sometimes go at lunchtime to spend
some qulity time at Borders. I actually think of
you every time I see the place.

&gt;Due to the context, it appeared to me as though George's point was an attempt at
&gt;refutation, but after looking at it again, it looks more like a tangential
&gt;comment. My apologies if I misunderstood.

&gt;Clearly, if your number is on the National DNC list, it's irrelevant whether you
&gt;are listed or not. OTOH, if you are not on the National DNC list, being unlisted
&gt;does not help you as you can still be called by telemarketers who systematically
&gt;dial all 10,000 numbers in a given exchange.

"/> Well, except for the fact that they can be fined for calling random
numbers which are on the DNC list, you are absolutely right.

offering your community right now. I know you're thinking this is a

getting harrassing phone calls, and your name IS on the DNC list.
They should be able to trace it just as they would any other stalker.

&gt;&gt;They were until I got tired of sales calls, which has nothing

&gt; Sales calls have nothing to do with a listed telephone number, and you
know it.
&gt; Sales calls are made with automated dialing equipment that systematically
calls
&gt; every number in a given exchange, listed or not. Do Not Call lists change
this
&gt; slightly, but being unlisted has virtually no effect.

"/> Have you ever had an unlisted number, and if so, have you been getting
marketing calls at this number?
I have had an unlisted number for over 20 years, and I have yet to receive
a random marketing call.
I live in the South Bay.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bottom line, the measure of a USENET post is in the words it
&gt;&gt;&gt; contains, NOT in the name in the header. Truth is truth,
&gt;&gt;&gt; facts are facts, and valid points are valid points regard-
&gt;&gt;&gt; less of whether the name in the header is the same as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; one on the poster's birth certificate. To claim otherwise
&gt;&gt;&gt; is nothing more than an Ad Hominem attack.

&gt;&gt;Articles posted to Usenet by any given person who employs
&gt;&gt;a pseudonym aren't necessarily offensive or even controversial.
&gt;&gt;Be that as it may, the purpose of Usenet newsgroups, collec-

&gt; Opinions (and facts, for that matter) stand on their own merit; the words
in the
&gt; header of the USENET post are irrelevant.

&gt; How do I know that &quot;Geoff Miller&quot; is even your real name? The fact is, I
don't
&gt; know - and I don't care. My discussions with you are based solely on the
merit
