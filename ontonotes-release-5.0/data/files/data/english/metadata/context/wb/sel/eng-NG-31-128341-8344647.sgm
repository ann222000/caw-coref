Has anyone looked at their bill for fall term yet? I don't remember
paying for general fees or info tech some kind of euip. fee. Does
anyone know what this is and why we are charged this. It's $400 more!
I may give UC a call tomorrow unless someone else can shed some light
on this.

It's terrible isn't it!!!  Almost $4000 for tuition and they want to
thrown that on top of it. I'm pretty sure that these fees are because
we are full time this semester.  I got charged the same thing the
semester I did 2 prerequisite classes at UC.

Also, watch carefully for the line item for health insurance.  I
filled out the form to have it waived, but that hasn't happened.  I
guess I'll call today.

My financial aid better come through fast...

Yes.  That is so annoying.  I filled out the waiver form too.  And the
extra $400 fee!

I emailed Nada and she wasn't sure what it was either, but gave me a
name in the UC speech dept to call. I left a message with her and I
spoke to someone in student accounts. It looks like we won't get out
of these fees now that we have a fulltime schedule this fall. That's a
lot of money!

I have been trying to get through to the number listed at the bottom
of our fee page all morning.  I, too, completed the waiver.  I was
also going to find out what the other things were for.  I don't know
how I am going to pay for practicum!!!  And books!!!!  And my laptop
(that I think is finally working like it should)!!!!!!

Good luck on the test, ladies.  I probably won't take it until
tomorrow due to schedules in our house!!

Well that's another thing that sucks for CSU students.  At least the
practicum hours are covered under the full-time hours for UC students,
we have to pay ANOTHER tuition bill on top.

This semester REALLY hurts!

I finally talked to someone about the insurance waiver.  The
representation said I should check the status of my waiver (an option
from the waiver page).  My request is still in process, which means
they haven't yet completed the review.

Thanks Tina.  I looked at my waiver and its been approved.  It
probably just hasn't been posted yet.  If its like other accounting
type systems I've worked with, they do an information dump overnight.
Sometimes it can take 3-4 days to match up.

Thanks for the info, Tina!  I have been getting a busy signal all day
today at the OneStop number.

I also looked up the fee schedule.  UC has a different schedule for
Distance Learning Students.  Has anyone asked if these fees could
apply to us instead?  They are certainly lower!!  If no one as asked
yet, I can figure out who the person to talk to is, then see what we
can come up with.  But, if anyone has done this already, can you let
us know?  I don't want to duplicate what has already been done!!

Omigosh!!!  If OSU can give us a break, so can UC.  Dr. Fox spearheaded
the efforts there.  I wonder who we can recruit to help us out at UC.
I think that we might want to get Nada involved.  Maybe she could
appeal to someone like Dr. Craighead.  Let me know how I can help!  You
go girl!!

I am opting not to do practicum this quarter because
we are on a &quot;full time&quot; basis.  I figured that I will
hold off and take practicum when the rates will be
cheaper.  I might be behind on hours, but UC rates are
pretty high and I have a upcoming wedding.  Any little
bit that I can save I will.

I am somewhat frustrated by some of these surprise
fees and additional classes we have to take.  We will
get through this though.

Good luck on the final!  I haven't started yet, but I
do intend on doing it tonight. Has there been a final
decision about meeting during out break yet?

Sooooo...I checked the status of my health insurance waiver, and it
says it was approved...YET, I am still being charged for health
insurance...do you think it is just a matter of updating my bill?
Maybe they just approved the waiver...I'm so confused...I'll have to
call someone tomorrow...did anyone find out who our contact would be
for this sort of thing?  Just curious!!

Good luck with the final, everyone!  I took it earlier and am sooooooo
glad to be done!!  Yay!! :)

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; students,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we have to pay ANOTHER tuition bill on top.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This semester REALLY hurts!

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good luck on the test, ladies.  I probably
&gt; &gt; won't take it until
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tomorrow due to schedules in our house!!

Just to let you all know- I just sent Nada an email, so I will let you
know what becomes of it.  I just asked if there was a way that we
could be charged the distance learning fees instead of the traditional
student fees.  We are, afterall, disntance learning!!

Later,

Stephanie,

Those were my thoughts exactly.  Afterall, I am sure
that our degree/diplomas will say something to the
effect of distance learning instead of the usual
traditional ones issued to those on campus (even the
students affiliated with UC).  So why should we pay
the same fees?  I don't understand how they could
justifiy it any differently with the CSU students.
They truly have nothing coming from UC other than the
credit hours for the courses taken.  This should have
been something discussed when they were developing the
program.  I am sure that we will have many other
unexpected things since we are &quot;guinea pigs&quot;.  Please
let us know if you get some good news.

YES, Let us know if there is anything we can do.  We are all distance
learning students and should benefit from the reduced tuition.   I'd
be willing to make calls to professors/administrators at UC as well if
it would help.  This one aspect--tuition, fees, financial aid and
payments--has made me nuts from day one when we met in Columbus for the
first time.  If Dr. Fox could arrange for reduced tuition through the
office of continuing education, I have to hope the same could be done
for UC.

Just an FYI, when I checked my bill this morning, the charge for
insurance had been removed.  So I would guess everyone's should be
there in the next couple of days.
