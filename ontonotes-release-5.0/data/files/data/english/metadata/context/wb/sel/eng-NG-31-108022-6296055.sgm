Shaker Applesauce (with dried apples)
Shaker Applesauce (with fresh apples)

This is absolutely the best applesauce. You can mash the apple slices a
little bit if you want it more mushy. It is kind of labor intensive,
what with boiling down the cider, but it is so worth it.

Shaker Applesauce (with dried apples)

2 pounds dried apple slices
1/3 gallon water
2/3 gallon cider, which has been boiled down from 2 gallons fresh cider
1/2 pound sugar (optional)
2 cinnamon sticks (optional)

Soak the apples overnight in the water. In the morning, add the boiled
down cider to the soaked apples. Add sugar and/or cinnamon if using.
Cover tightly and simmer over low heat for 3 1/2 hours, or until apples
are tender but not falling apart. Do not stir. The apple slices should
remain whole. Â Makes about 4 - 5 pints of applesauce

Shaker Applesauce (with fresh apples)

4 pounds apples, peeled and sliced thick
1/3 gallon cider, boiled down from 1 gallon fresh cider.
1 cup sugar (optional)
1 cinnamon stick (optional)

In a large pan, add apple slices to the boiled down cider. Add sugar
and/or cinnamon if using. Simmer about 2 hours, or until apples are
tender but not falling apart. Do not stir. The apple slices should
remain whole. Makes about 2 pints of applesauce.
