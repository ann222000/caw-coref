Should Bruce live or die?

I am a 38 year old man.  I receive CPP Disability (Canadian Pension Plan
Disability), and AISH (Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped,
[Alberta, Canada]).  They have been my main income for 10 years, along
with a very small income gained in the last two years by helping people
fix their computer problems.  No matter how I try, though, I cannot work
for very long without getting stressed out, and suicidal.

I have suffered from depression since the age of eight (30 years), along
with anxiety, stress, and low self esteem.  I have never had a girlfriend,
due to being shy (and my low self-esteem), and I have long since given up
on the dream of having a family of my own.  I am alone.  I also have
problems with my physical health: ulcerative colitis, constant back pain
and problems, sciatica, gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), an inner ear
problem that causes me to be dizzy and nauseous, and a benign brain tumor
which has contributed to migraine headaches.

As a child, I was bullied and picked on.  I was taught to be a pacifist,
and ignore those who did me harm.  I continue to abhor violence, and I try
to ignore those who do me harm.  I've never been a people person.

I grew up in a small town (Hardisty, Alberta).  When I finished High
School, I immediately left home, moving to Edmonton, Alberta.  I had
planned to change my life, to be everything I wanted to be.  I figured
that if I acted outgoing, friendly, and successful, that I would
eventually become that.  I was wrong.  After a ten years of prentending in
the city, (four of which I gained a BSc. in University), my mind broke.  I
had graduated from private suicide attempts, to a public one, which could
not be ignored by others.

My first suicide attempt was when I was 16.  I have attempted suicide
innumerable times in the past ten years.  It seems that I am more afraid
of the oblivion of death, than of continued life.  In the past 5 years,
I've only tried to kill myself once, and that was recently.  I am a
coward.  I just can't seem to kill myself.  This final option is denied
me.

I'm drinking more, to try to obliterate everything.  Logically, I know
that alcohol will not help, but for some reason I continue to drink.

Part of me wants to die, but the animal part of me clings to life, despite
my pointless existence.  I'm a financial drain on society, and my
depression almost always affects people around me.  I'm also a financial
and emotional drain on my family.  They would be much better off without
me.  Don't bother to automaically deny that.  There are just some people
in this world that the world and human society are better off without.

I survive financially through the tax dollars of everyone around me.  No
matter what I do, I cannot work consistently enough to earn my own living.
I try to help my community by doing volunteer jobs like garbage picking,
but I know that it is not enough.

My existence is pointless.  I cannot work.  I have no real friends.  I am
unable and undeserving to have a girlfriend, much less than a wife and
family.  What do I have to live for?  More years of this misery?

What do you think?  Should I live or die?

You don't sound happy and when your so ill I know it makes you depressed
and makes life feel not worth living.

Only you can make the decision to live or die.  Your only 38, my advice
would be to find something you really enjoy and try to do that to take
your mind off your other problems.

I have had crohn's since 14 so I know what your struggling with.

start addressing the childhood issues; if you know why you were so
depressed at age 8 you can try to find others who had/ have similar

GERD might be part of IBD

Bruce,

You have already been offered some sound advice from previous posters.   In
addition, why not try the MoodGym? http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/ - a free
multiple-session online CBT course.

For more background reading I suggest that you read the following:
http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/html/CBT.html
http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/checkup_tr_20061221.shtml
http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/mind/tas_cbt.html

Believe you me, I think I can say with confidence that everyone here (apart
from the odd delobed spammer) has been where you are currently and we do
empathise and understand.

Perhaps, you should also think about a hobby. I have just started painting
and can direct you to this site should you (or anyone else) be interested:
http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthread.php?t=310721 Have a look at the
monthly painting classes and the learning demos in particular.

Wishing you all the best,

Vanny

<POSTDATE> 2007-08-22T04:18:00 </POSTDATE>
Several messages &amp; ideas to respond to, regarding my stupid posting in
several newsgroups, &quot;Should Bruce live or die?&quot;

&quot;Quit drinking&quot;: Drinking helps me cope with stress, while other things
(exercise, work, music, reading), don't.  I don't think I'm an alcoholic,
since I have stopped drinking weeks or months at a time, and never had a
problem with stopping.

&quot;Get a pet&quot;: I hate cats, and don't like dogs much better.  I don't like
the hair and other messes I would have to clean up, plus I'm allergic.  I
can barely take care of myself, much less a pet of any kind.  A pet would
deserve better care than I could give them.

&quot;Get a hobby&quot;: I've tried several, and always get stressed out by them
eventually.

&quot;Find something you really enjoy and try to do that to take your mind off
your other problems&quot;: This goes along with the hobby question and answer.
I've tried several things, and usually end up hating them eventually
because I got stressed out by it.  Reading, watching TV &amp; movies helps
some, but even they can stress me out, as well as affecting my mood
negatively through their story lines.  Those are just methods of escapism,
which don't help in the long run.

&quot;Get exercise/do sports&quot;: Did that, and it doesn't help.  I just get
physically tired, on top of the depression.

&quot;Get therapy/talk to somebody&quot;: I see my psyrink every few months.
Doesn't help.  Talking to family doesn't help, and makes things worse for
them.

&quot;Get cognitive behavioral therapy&quot;: Tried that, and it doesn't work.
Repeating positive thoughts to myself gets boring, and feels dishonest.  I
spent 10 years lying to myself like that (&quot;You are a good person, you
deserve good things, you deserve success, you deserve love.)  The end
result of that was a mental breakdown.  Trying to stop negative thoughts
as they happen is impossible for me.  It's like trying to get a broken
computer to fix itself.  It doesn't work properly in the first place, so
it's impossible to fix itself.  All in all, cognitive behavioral therapy
struck me as just more lying to myself, which I already know doesn't work.

&quot;Get hospitalized&quot;: Did that, it didn't help.  In fact, it made things
worse, having to deal with so many people so closely.  I've learned not to
ask for help, or I get stuck in such a situation.

&quot;Get medicated&quot;: My psyrink has had me try many meds, most not working
much.  Even when meds DO help, my outlook on life doesn't change.

&quot;Get group therapy&quot;: Did that, hated it.  I don't like groups of people,
and they always seem to have much worse problems than I do, which I really
don't want to hear about.

&quot;Use one of &quot;these sites&quot; online to get help&quot;: I've tried some free ones
already, and they don't help.  I'm certainly not going to try any paid
sites.

&quot;Address the childhood issues&quot;: Short of searching out the bullies and
beating them up, what am I supposed to do?  Talking about it hasn't
helped.  I still let people bully me sometimes, like my new neighbor, who
physically pushed me around, and likes to scream at me.  Talking about
these childhood issues has done nothing for me either.  One of these days,
I will lose my cool, and fight back.  When that happens, I will probably
end up locked up in a hospital or jail.

&quot;Forget about the money&quot;: I hear that pride is a sin, but I liked being
able to support myself, when I was.  It bothers me a great deal to not be
able to support myself.  Before I stopped working, my life revolved around
work.  Healthy or not, I worked hard, and liked the feeling of
accomplishment work gave me.  But then, I never thought I was doing a good
enough job, which made me work harder and harder, until I started getting
burnt out, and then screwing up everything.

&quot;At least you have a pension and don't have to face the threat of eviction
every month&quot;: That's true, but I'm constantly worried about what will
happen if the governmental powers-that-be decide that I'm &quot;better&quot; and
don't deserve the pensions.

&quot;Don't worry about not having a girlfriend or wife, it will come in time&quot;:
I've been shy with women my whole life, tried my whole life to fix that.
I'm old enough now to know that I will never change that.

&quot;Not undeserving but not ready at this time (for relationship with a
woman)&quot;: I yearn for it.  I dream of it.  I miss it, even though I've
never had it.  I've tried hard to push aside my shyness, so I could try to
gain it.  Now, after so many years, I have accepted that I will never have
a girlfriend or wife.  Also, when I look at myself objectively, I see an
unemployable mental defect, who either depresses or pisses off everyone
around me.  It's not just a emotionally clouded conclusion that I'm
undeserving, but an objective conclusion as well.  A woman would have to
be insane to want me, and I would not want such a woman.

&quot;Don't try to be what I should be, but what I want to be / Don't compare
myself to others&quot;: I've never cared much about what is &quot;conventional&quot; and
what others think of me.  I care about what I want in life, not what the
rest of society thinks my life should be.

&quot;Quit feeling so sorry for yourself&quot;: That's about as helpful as saying,
&quot;Stop being depressed&quot;.  Pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps
doesn't work.

&quot;Help myself by helping others who are also depressed&quot;: You ever hear of
&quot;the blind leading the blind&quot;?  I have no answers to give them, and my
mood unintentionally affects everyone around me.  I would only make them
worse.  I like to help people if and when I can, but I'm certainly no help
in this area.

&quot;Define my beliefs, and work with them to make myself happy (ie. Religion,
life purpose, karma, life after death, etc): I find it hard to believe
that people could avoid doing that in the first place.  But for the sake
of argument, I will define what I &quot;believe&quot;.  I'm an atheist, I don't
believe that we are judged at death, I think that death is oblivion, and
the only reason why I should be a good person (decent, honest, helpful,
charitable, etc.), is that it would make me feel good.  Being a good
person is it's own reward.  I try to help people, be a good person, do
charitable things, but like I said, my depression unintentionally affects
everyone around me, undoing any good I can do.  Because of that, they
generally prefer that I didn't help in the first place.  Also, it seems
that whenever I try to do something positive for my community as a whole,
my efforts are either ignored, or result in ridicule.  I know I've already
said that I generally don't care what others think, but in these
instances, when I'm trying to make an effort to help, I seem to leave
myself open to criticism.

&quot;Use humor to lift my spirits&quot;: Obviously this is from someone who has
never experienced depression.  The sky can be blue, the temperature just
right, the joke really funny, but while I can objectively perceive all
that, it does not affect me positively like everyone else.

&quot;You can't kill yourself, not because you are a coward, but because you
don't really want to die&quot;: That's been nagging me my whole life also.  I
figure that the animal instinct to survive overpowers my pain and misery.
That makes me even more miserable.  Of course I want to live the life that
I WANT, but I can't have that life.  I'm stuck with this one, that I
figuratively and literally, don't want.

&quot;Post your thoughts to the appropriate newsgroups&quot;: I wanted the opinions
of my peers.  I figured that I would be much more likely to find my peers
in newsgroups of subjects that interest me.  Of course, it is off-topic,
which pisses people off, and I can understand that.  I've already heard
what the professionals have said, and it didn't do me any good.  After ten
years of seeing him, even my psyrink now admits that I may never
&quot;recover&quot;.

Thanks for your responses.

Damn I'm slow.  And stupid.  It's taken me many hours to compose this
message.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Several messages &amp; ideas to respond to, regarding my stupid posting in
&gt; several newsgroups, &quot;Should Bruce live or die?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Quit drinking&quot;: Drinking helps me cope with stress, while other things
&gt; (exercise, work, music, reading), don't.  I don't think I'm an alcoholic,
&gt; since I have stopped drinking weeks or months at a time, and never had a
&gt; problem with stopping.

&gt; &quot;Get a pet&quot;: I hate cats, and don't like dogs much better.  I don't like
&gt; the hair and other messes I would have to clean up, plus I'm allergic.  I
&gt; can barely take care of myself, much less a pet of any kind.  A pet would
&gt; deserve better care than I could give them.

&gt; &quot;Get a hobby&quot;: I've tried several, and always get stressed out by them
&gt; eventually.

&gt; &quot;Find something you really enjoy and try to do that to take your mind off
&gt; your other problems&quot;: This goes along with the hobby question and answer.
&gt; I've tried several things, and usually end up hating them eventually
&gt; because I got stressed out by it.  Reading, watching TV &amp; movies helps
&gt; some, but even they can stress me out, as well as affecting my mood
&gt; negatively through their story lines.  Those are just methods of escapism,
&gt; which don't help in the long run.

&gt; &quot;Get exercise/do sports&quot;: Did that, and it doesn't help.  I just get
&gt; physically tired, on top of the depression.

&gt; &quot;Get therapy/talk to somebody&quot;: I see my psyrink every few months.
&gt; Doesn't help.  Talking to family doesn't help, and makes things worse for
&gt; them.

&gt; &quot;Get cognitive behavioral therapy&quot;: Tried that, and it doesn't work.
&gt; Repeating positive thoughts to myself gets boring, and feels dishonest.  I
&gt; spent 10 years lying to myself like that (&quot;You are a good person, you
&gt; deserve good things, you deserve success, you deserve love.)  The end
&gt; result of that was a mental breakdown.  Trying to stop negative thoughts
&gt; as they happen is impossible for me.  It's like trying to get a broken
&gt; computer to fix itself.  It doesn't work properly in the first place, so
&gt; it's impossible to fix itself.  All in all, cognitive behavioral therapy
&gt; struck me as just more lying to myself, which I already know doesn't work.

&gt; &quot;Get hospitalized&quot;: Did that, it didn't help.  In fact, it made things
&gt; worse, having to deal with so many people so closely.  I've learned not to
&gt; ask for help, or I get stuck in such a situation.

&gt; &quot;Get medicated&quot;: My psyrink has had me try many meds, most not working
&gt; much.  Even when meds DO help, my outlook on life doesn't change.

&gt; &quot;Get group therapy&quot;: Did that, hated it.  I don't like groups of people,
&gt; and they always seem to have much worse problems than I do, which I really
&gt; don't want to hear about.

&gt; &quot;Use one of &quot;these sites&quot; online to get help&quot;: I've tried some free ones
&gt; already, and they don't help.  I'm certainly not going to try any paid
&gt; sites.

&gt; &quot;Address the childhood issues&quot;: Short of searching out the bullies and
&gt; beating them up, what am I supposed to do?  Talking about it hasn't
&gt; helped.  I still let people bully me sometimes, like my new neighbor, who
&gt; physically pushed me around, and likes to scream at me.  Talking about
&gt; these childhood issues has done nothing for me either.  One of these days,
&gt; I will lose my cool, and fight back.  When that happens, I will probably
&gt; end up locked up in a hospital or jail.

&gt; &quot;Forget about the money&quot;: I hear that pride is a sin, but I liked being
&gt; able to support myself, when I was.  It bothers me a great deal to not be
&gt; able to support myself.  Before I stopped working, my life revolved around
&gt; work.  Healthy or not, I worked hard, and liked the feeling of
&gt; accomplishment work gave me.  But then, I never thought I was doing a good
&gt; enough job, which made me work harder and harder, until I started getting
&gt; burnt out, and then screwing up everything.

&gt; &quot;At least you have a pension and don't have to face the threat of eviction
&gt; every month&quot;: That's true, but I'm constantly worried about what will
&gt; happen if the governmental powers-that-be decide that I'm &quot;better&quot; and
&gt; don't deserve the pensions.

&gt; &quot;Don't worry about not having a girlfriend or wife, it will come in time&quot;:
&gt; I've been shy with women my whole life, tried my whole life to fix that.
&gt; I'm old enough now to know that I will never change that.

&gt; &quot;Not undeserving but not ready at this time (for relationship with a
&gt; woman)&quot;: I yearn for it.  I dream of it.  I miss it, even though I've
&gt; never had it.  I've tried hard to push aside my shyness, so I could try to
&gt; gain it.  Now, after so many years, I have accepted that I will never have
&gt; a girlfriend or wife.  Also, when I look at myself objectively, I see an
&gt; unemployable mental defect, who either depresses or pisses off everyone
&gt; around me.  It's not just a emotionally clouded conclusion that I'm
&gt; undeserving, but an objective conclusion as well.  A woman would have to
&gt; be insane to want me, and I would not want such a woman.

&gt; &quot;Don't try to be what I should be, but what I want to be / Don't compare
&gt; myself to others&quot;: I've never cared much about what is &quot;conventional&quot; and
&gt; what others think of me.  I care about what I want in life, not what the
&gt; rest of society thinks my life should be.

&gt; &quot;Quit feeling so sorry for yourself&quot;: That's about as helpful as saying,
&gt; &quot;Stop being depressed&quot;.  Pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps
&gt; doesn't work.

&gt; &quot;Help myself by helping others who are also depressed&quot;: You ever hear of
&gt; &quot;the blind leading the blind&quot;?  I have no answers to give them, and my
&gt; mood unintentionally affects everyone around me.  I would only make them
&gt; worse.  I like to help people if and when I can, but I'm certainly no help
&gt; in this area.

&gt; &quot;Define my beliefs, and work with them to make myself happy (ie. Religion,
&gt; life purpose, karma, life after death, etc): I find it hard to believe
&gt; that people could avoid doing that in the first place.  But for the sake
&gt; of argument, I will define what I &quot;believe&quot;.  I'm an atheist, I don't
&gt; believe that we are judged at death, I think that death is oblivion, and
&gt; the only reason why I should be a good person (decent, honest, helpful,
&gt; charitable, etc.), is that it would make me feel good.  Being a good
&gt; person is it's own reward.  I try to help people, be a good person, do
&gt; charitable things, but like I said, my depression unintentionally affects
&gt; everyone around me, undoing any good I can do.  Because of that, they
&gt; generally prefer that I didn't help in the first place.  Also, it seems
&gt; that whenever I try to do something positive for my community as a whole,
&gt; my efforts are either ignored, or result in ridicule.  I know I've already
&gt; said that I generally don't care what others think, but in these
&gt; instances, when I'm trying to make an effort to help, I seem to leave
&gt; myself open to criticism.

&gt; &quot;Use humor to lift my spirits&quot;: Obviously this is from someone who has
&gt; never experienced depression.  The sky can be blue, the temperature just
&gt; right, the joke really funny, but while I can objectively perceive all
&gt; that, it does not affect me positively like everyone else.

&gt; &quot;You can't kill yourself, not because you are a coward, but because you
&gt; don't really want to die&quot;: That's been nagging me my whole life also.  I
&gt; figure that the animal instinct to survive overpowers my pain and misery.
&gt; That makes me even more miserable.  Of course I want to live the life that
&gt; I WANT, but I can't have that life.  I'm stuck with this one, that I
&gt; figuratively and literally, don't want.

&gt; &quot;Post your thoughts to the appropriate newsgroups&quot;: I wanted the opinions
&gt; of my peers.  I figured that I would be much more likely to find my peers
&gt; in newsgroups of subjects that interest me.  Of course, it is off-topic,
&gt; which pisses people off, and I can understand that.  I've already heard
&gt; what the professionals have said, and it didn't do me any good.  After ten
&gt; years of seeing him, even my psyrink now admits that I may never
&gt; &quot;recover&quot;.

&gt; Thanks for your responses.

&gt; Damn I'm slow.  And stupid.  It's taken me many hours to compose this
&gt; message.

If you prefer to so tenaciously adhere to the negative mind set you so
graciously display here, you'll successfully attract more of the same
negativity in your life.

Perhaps then you only want confirmation from someone who will tell you how
hopeless you seem.

&gt; Should Bruce live or die?

&gt; I am a 38 year old man. I receive CPP Disability
&gt; (Canadian Pension Plan
&gt; Disability), and AISH (Assured Income for the
&gt; Severely Handicapped,
&gt; [Alberta, Canada]). They have been my main
&gt; income for 10 years, along
&gt; with a very small income gained in the last two
&gt; years by helping people
&gt; fix their computer problems. No matter how I
&gt; try, though, I cannot work
&gt; for very long without getting stressed out, and
&gt; suicidal.

&gt; I have suffered from depression since the age of
&gt; eight (30 years), along
&gt; with anxiety, stress, and low self esteem. I
&gt; have never had a girlfriend,
&gt; due to being shy (and my low self-esteem), and I
&gt; have long since given up
&gt; on the dream of having a family of my own. I am
&gt; alone.  I also have
&gt; problems with my physical health: ulcerative
&gt; colitis, constant back pain
&gt; and problems, sciatica, gastroesophageal reflux
&gt; (GERD), an inner ear
&gt; problem that causes me to be dizzy and nauseous,
&gt; and a benign brain tumor
&gt; which has contributed to migraine headaches.

&gt; As a child, I was bullied and picked on. I was
&gt; taught to be a pacifist,
&gt; and ignore those who did me harm. I continue to
&gt; abhor violence, and I try
&gt; to ignore those who do me harm. I've never been
&gt; a people person.

&gt; I grew up in a small town (Hardisty, Alberta).
&gt; When I finished High
&gt; School, I immediately left home, moving to
&gt; Edmonton, Alberta. I had
&gt; planned to change my life, to be everything I
&gt; wanted to be. I figured
&gt; that if I acted outgoing, friendly, and
&gt; successful, that I would
&gt; eventually become that. I was wrong. After a ten
&gt; years of prentending in
&gt; the city, (four of which I gained a BSc. in
&gt; University), my mind broke. I
&gt; had graduated from private suicide attempts, to
&gt; a public one, which could
&gt; not be ignored by others.

&gt; My first suicide attempt was when I was 16. I
&gt; have attempted suicide
&gt; innumerable times in the past ten years. It
&gt; seems that I am more afraid
&gt; of the oblivion of death, than of continued
&gt; life. In the past 5 years,
&gt; I've only tried to kill myself once, and that
&gt; was recently. I am a
&gt; coward. I just can't seem to kill myself. This
&gt; final option is denied
&gt; me.

&gt; I'm drinking more, to try to obliterate
&gt; everything. Logically, I know
&gt; that alcohol will not help, but for some reason
&gt; I continue to drink.

&gt; Part of me wants to die, but the animal part of
&gt; me clings to life, despite
&gt; my pointless existence. I'm a financial drain on
&gt; society, and my
&gt; depression almost always affects people around
&gt; me. I'm also a financial
&gt; and emotional drain on my family. They would be
&gt; much better off without
&gt; me. Don't bother to automaically deny that.
&gt; There are just some people
&gt; in this world that the world and human society
&gt; are better off without.

&gt; I survive financially through the tax dollars of
&gt; everyone around me. No
&gt; matter what I do, I cannot work consistently
&gt; enough to earn my own living.
&gt; I try to help my community by doing volunteer
&gt; jobs like garbage picking,
&gt; but I know that it is not enough.

&gt; My existence is pointless. I cannot work. I have
&gt; no real friends. I am
&gt; unable and undeserving to have a girlfriend,
&gt; much less than a wife and
&gt; family. What do I have to live for? More years
&gt; of this misery?

&gt; What do you think? Should I live or die?

Depression or suicidality is a serious medical/psychological illness.
Until your depression is under better control your ability to &quot;get a
hobby&quot; or what ever will be grossly limited.  Depression can be caused
by medical problems but the way you describe it, I tend to doubt
that.  Likely that your medical problems exacerbate your depression.
I am not familiar with the Canadian mental health system, but I would
recommend you seek treatment.  As you know as a suicide survivor-
there is no guarantee that your attempt will work so perhaps you may
want to think about contingency plans such as how do you want to live
your life.  I have known people who have survived being run over by
trains,  elaborate asphixation buildings,  you name it- no guarantee
that your method will work- so have a plan b for survival.  Do you
want to feel this way?  Maybe you get something out of it,  if not
pursue better treatment.  With the number of suicide attempts you list
I wonder if Depression is truly your diagnosis- perhaps you have
bipolar disorder or borderline personality  both of which require a
different sort of treatment.  CBT as Vanny mentioned is one of the
most effective tools for borderline personality and borderline
personality disorder is often fatal.  There is no way that your death
will not negatively impact someone.  Even if it is only the paramedic
or police officer that finds you-  these things stay with a person.
Your death may seem an easy way out for you,  but someone will be left
to pick up the mess,  and in all likelyhood your impact on the world
as an alive person surviving the depths of mental illness will have a
much more positive impact even on strangers then your death ever
could.    All I'm saying is that Depression and suicidality of
whatever cause are very treatable in North America 2007.  Start with
seeking treatment,  pharmacological combined with talk therapy- then
consider the next step.

gotten depressed in their lives because of their illnesses and
considered suicide at least fleetingly.  thus, most here are survivors
of a depression similar to yours--and feel very strongly about your
future.

i have little to add other than a suggestion of a book.  read
&quot;steppenwolf&quot; by herman hesse--the first part of the book mirrors your

Hi--josh is doing ok--he says that he gets sick about once a week,
assumes it's from eating incorrectly, and accepts the hurt as payment
for the pleasure.  i wouldn't &quot;play&quot; it that way, but he has a great
wife, job, and life, so he knows what's best for him.

hope you and your son are okay, and i will again become more active on
