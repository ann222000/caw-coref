Last night was the best Ratdog show I have ever seen. It was a totally
refreshed band.

I wish nothing but the best for Mark Karan, but Kimock raised the bar
bigtime.
I don't have time to post a review, but John, Neil, Nick, and I and
our non RMGD friends had a splendid time hanging out together

indeed.
now, here is my nickels worth

this year marks the 50th year since we were graced with &quot;On the Road&quot;,
by Jack.  A book like no other...and one that I just can't follow long
enough to read.
but hearing it read, it doesn't come across as so much strung out
gibberish..more like poetry..or an E.A.Poe story about the strange
places a strung out mind can take you when you are trying to describe
someone as deep as Neil Cassidy apparently was.

I didn't know that the entire book was just a collection of stories
about being &quot;on the road&quot; with Cowboy Neil at the wheel.  Interesting
stuff.

So to celebrate the event, Bobby, Dennis McNally and the original
manuscript (mentioned as the most valuable manuscript on earth, and
owned by that dude who has Tiger and a sports team or two) , came out
on stage to talk smack about Neil and tell stories...answer questions
from the crowd..etc.  Bobby was pretty funny w/these
stories...especially the &quot;Neil taught me to drive&quot; ones.  Man..those
must have been some wierd times indeed@!

So after all of that, and with readings from the book being broadcast
over the PA during intermissions...Ratdog came out to the stage and
laid down one of *the best* performances I've seen out of them.
Of course...there were songs carefully selected to honor all those
pranksters.  A nice Cassidy opener.  1st set was a little mellow...if
not hypnotic, but the closing Sailor &gt; Saint &gt; DoughKnees was
stupendous.   Kimock, still sitting in for our ailing brother Marc,
ripped the shit out of a few of the guitar solos.  Especially the
doughknees, where his bright, twangy, playful licks ripped through the
mix, the night air...my brain....et. all.

2nd set was also spectacular.  Standard acoustic openers (kudos to
Mexicalli Blues which was executed perfectly) lead into He's
Gone ...which ...as everyone knew, was heading into a major Other ONE
melt down.  Ratdogs arrangement of this classic is so juicy.  All the
various textures added by Kenny's sax, Jeffs Hammond, Bobby's
&quot;gargling&quot; rhythmic guitar and Steve's various tones..from sparkling
clean to snarling and nasty..., just makes for a lot of interesting
dynamics.  Jay was awesome (he's really opened up his playing in the
last couple years, IMO) and Robin's thunderous bass lines...well, it
made for a convincing rendition, to say the least.  Kimock was just
plain awesome...all night long.
&quot;Stuff&quot; was great, I really enjoy that now w/Steve there.  They jammed
out for quite some time before Bobby came back out and they slowly
eased into the best Wharf Rat I've heard from any band...since
probably 1994 or so (as I wont comment on the last time I heard ol'
Jer do it in Giants Stadium on that dreadful last summer tour so many
years ago).  Steve ...again...was really, really good.
What came out of this was a very cool jam that had flavors of every
song they started and didn't finish.  A little T.O.O., a little
Birdsong...a little Cassidy...a little more birdsong...a little more
cassidy, you just couldn't tell what they were going to do.  They
ended up doing both, finishing the birdsong first and then falling
into the climax jam of Cassidy and w/a flight of the seabird..closed
the set.
Being Sunday, the Samson encore was appropriate.  I was hoping it was
going to be a little nastier than it was, but i'm not complaining.
How could I, after what I had just heard for the previous 2.5 hours.

the band's vocals are seriously diminished w/o Karan.  Nobody could
harmonize at all..and it was painful to listen to at times.  Steve's
guitar playing made up for it...on soooo many levels.  He is just such
a wonderful fit to the band, the music...the essence of what they are
after.  Bobby walks right over and plays with him, so that they can
lock into the moment.  A few times, Steve lead some jams that got
funky..almost like older SKB jams...with his searing, snarling guitar
sailing through the mix, tearing at the air it seemed.
I saw a monstrous shooting star go flying over the stage.
I wondered who sent it.  Maybe it was a group effort.

What they said!

It was , officially , wicked pissah!

When I caught the June show, curious about how kimcok would fit into
the mix, I was sold-- when they are &quot;on&quot; with SK in the mix, they are
on in a  big way.

There are moments you got to thinking you'd never experience again-
big Bobby Grateful Dead moments. And I've been to some Ratdog shows
when it was not happening, but two so far, and I'm born again.
For those keeping score at home:

I: Jam &gt; Cassidy &gt; Stagger Lee &gt; Bird Song &gt; Shade of Grey &gt; Hell in a
Bucket &gt; Lost Sailor &gt; Saint of Circumstance &gt; Don't Ease Me In
II: On the Road Again@, Mexicali Blues@, When I Paint My Masterpiece@

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He's Gone &gt; The Other One &gt; Stuff &gt; Wharf Rat &gt; Bird Song (reprise)
&gt; Cassidy (reprise)
">

E: Samson and Delilah

almost every tune had a Kerouac or Cassady allusion; the McNally
reading from The Other One is a GD gem, like when the late great Kesey
read EE Cummings during a Dark Star at the Bill Graham memorial show.

and how wierd, and synchronistic, to finally put faces to those rmgd
posters, after all these years, right at the moment Weir is rambling
on about synchronicity &amp; Neal.

a long strange trip indeed, and Bob &amp; the band were fully present at
this chapter!

Amen!!

It is kind of funny to me, as I am a big Bobby and Ratdog fan, and
this past Saturday's show at the Gathering of the Vibes made me
believe that Ratdog was on a single handed mission to put the entire
crowd that was attending the festival to sleep. There was PLENTY of
interesting playing, but everything was played soooo SLOW.

It was indeed, not even close, the best Ratdog show I've ever seen
Truly stupendous.  Below I've pasted my comments in response to Nick's
review that he and sent to another forum.

Peace,
Neil X.

I've heard many folks describe Cassidy as &quot;being able to see around
corners,&quot;
and &quot;being able to conduct 6 conversations simultaneously.&quot;   It was
fun to hear Bobby talking about that kind of thing.  He also had some
great stories about the acid tests.  I love the story of McNally's
about Cassidy typing--if he typed the wrong letter at the beginning of
a word, he would stop and think if there was a word that started with
the typoed letter that would work instead of the word he had intended
to type.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Ratdog came out to the stage and laid

That was, no doubt, the most stupendous Ratdog performance I've ever

great as is.

Does anyone have any perspective on why Ratdog's characteristic
performances of Masterpiece involves a chord change before the final
verse?  It sure is an unusual rendering, and I've heard them do this
before.  I don't have anything like perfect pitch, so I cant tell you
what key they were playing, and what they moved to  (G to A maybe?),
but Ratdog's version of this song is the only version I've heard that
does this.

Well, I still find Jay to be the weakest link, I wish someone would
vote him off
of the island.  But Kimock really is interesting, he's got it goin' on
with the
Dog right now, he adds a lot of the textural complexity that one
expects from
good Grateful Dead-like music.

Weir's voice is growing weaker by the day.  Ain't his fault, Father
Time is a
harsh master.  Nonetheless, it didn't diminish the fun at all.

The harmonies were the most jarringly bad on Wharf Rat.  Horrendous.

But this show was the first time in years that I can remember being
able to
dance and completely lose myself in the music in that timeless way
that made
going to see the Grateful Dead so much fun.  The show lasted for an
eternity and was over in a second.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

The nuDead did a very similar thing at Jones Beach during their final
tour in
2004--finished the set with the missing final verses of the Cassady
and Birdsong that they began in the first set.  So I was kind of
expecting this to happen last night when those songs were unfinished
earlier.  And, of course, opening and closing this particular show
with Cassady is something that was highly appropriate.  I told the
guys next to me that the would surely open with Cassady, but they
said, no, Ratdog never did that, it wouldn't happen.  But this wasn't
your usual Ratdog show, not by a mile.

Peace,
Neil X.

Yeah...the whole song modulates up to A from G.

Bob Dylan's version does the same thing.

I assume Ratdog does it to stay true to the song as written.

I completely agree. However last night made me a true believer. Kimock
was channelling Garcia in a big way last night.

&quot;The Other One&quot; with McNally reading the end of &quot;On The Road&quot; between
the first and second verses was absolutely brilliant. Perhaps the
single best &quot;Other One&quot; I have ever heard, and with out question the
best since the late 80's.

The modulation occurred in the bridge from what I recall (major to a
minor).  The Dead did not play the song's original bridge, which occurs
right before the last verse.  I think Bobby put the bridge back in.  I
can't remember any modulation beyond that.

No kidding. The harmonies were .... awful. Reminds me of Phil at his worst,
but Phil usually has at least one person in the band who can sing.

It's too bad, because the rest of the music was spectacularly good, certainly

This is like no Ratdog show I've seen or heard before. This is the
*real* thing, boys and girls. Definitely a dose-worthy show. I've
always kinda liked Kimock's stuff, but I LOVE his playing here. Among
many, many other highlights, Bird Song is off the charts and Bucket is
breathtaking. Even Brewster might like this version of Lost Sailor.
And I haven't gotten to the 2nd set yet.

Heh. Wait until you hear the vox on Wharf Rat and the Bird Song coda
and tell me if you still think you'd like to be dosed for that. The
mountains of competition notwithstanding, simply the single worst vox
I have ever heard on anything related to the Dead in any way, shape,
or form.

I listened to this the night after listening to the lastest Phil gig
in SF. While I certainly think the jams are way better than what Phil
is up to, and think there were moments that were really cool (the Bird
Song in the first set is definitely the high point of the show), I'm a
little puzzled by the degree of salivating going on, especially in
regards to Kimock.

You had to be there. It was a fucking barnburner from beginning to
end, weak vocals not withstanding. Instrumentally it was fucking
smoking.

I went with no expectations other than looking forward to hanging out
with friends and listening to some music on a nice August evening in a
cool venue. I left completely blown away by how good the show was

Both Neil and I stated numerous times during the course of the evening
that this was the best RD show either of us had ever seen

Both Jerry and Neal's presence were in evidence all night long. This
version of &quot;The Other One&quot; is a version for the ages IMO. McNally's
between verse reading the final chapter of &quot;On the Road&quot; (and
substituting Neal's name for Dean Moriarty) was a stroke of brilliance

And if the vocals were a little rough during Wharf Rat, I don't think
that anybody in the place cared.

If they can continue to play at this level, I will make an effort to
see more shows

Fred, I really hope you have the opportunity to catch one of these
shows with Steve Kimock. I think he's approaching the leads from left
field, so to speak - it takes a little getting used to, but the
results are very much of the &quot;transportation&quot; variety. Being a dancer,
I think you would &quot;get it&quot; quickly.

But then, of course, there's the discordancy of &quot;stuff&quot; - I can't
remember which show I was listening to earlier today (maybe 7/11) but
Robin was doing some really strange percussive noises on bass, and
Kenny and Steve were scatting back and forth, and it was completely
crazy.

And then Weir slowed the pace wa-a-ay down, and the next song was like
wading through molasses.

Anyway, it's really been fun listening to the streams of the shows and
I'm hoping copies of audience recordings will be circulating soon. I'm
thinking of springing for the sbd of the Cleveland show.

Well, you do tend to be a contrarian, Fred. NTTAWWT. Personally, while
I certainly prefer it when the vocals shine, it's never really
bothered me that much if they don't as long as the music is hot. With
the exception of a few Jerry ballads, I don't think you hear too many
deadheads raving on about the great vocals when they discuss their
favorite shows.

No worries, K. I got it just fine. I enjoyed the show quite a bit, in
fact, and thought the jams were far more interesting than the Phil
show I'd just listened to the night before. Kimmie did have some
interesting touches, and had I been there, I'm sure I'd have enjoyed
it like others have said they did.

I just thought the superlatives and characterizations being put forth
weren't in line with what I was hearing.

Funny, but I almost ended my post with &quot;I guess you had to be there.&quot;
And I fully understand that.

Like I said to Jim, I wouldn't have mentioned the vox (or at least
wouldn't have made them a prominent feature of the post) except for
his comments about dosing and the second set, so I don't want to trip
on them. I like Bobby's singing of Jer's songs just fine, his weakened
voice and odd phrasing notwithstanding. The backup guys, well, that's
a different story, but apparently it's a temporary thing because of
Karan's not being there.

As for it being a barnburner, well, I guess you had to be there, and I
guess you have to ask compared to what.

&gt; I went with no expectations other than looking forward to hanging out
&gt; with friends and listening to some music on a nice August evening in a
&gt; cool venue. I left completely blown away by how good the show was
">

As I said, I enjoyed it a *lot* more than the Phil show I listened to
the evening before. I just thought the superlatives were not in line
with what I was hearing. It was a solid affair, certainly. I just
didn't agree with the &quot;studpendous&quot; bits, nor did I think Kimmie was
nearly as smokin' as some said. I think he was quite good and they
were certainly into it, but that's as far as my ears will let me go,
cause I wasn't there for the vibe.

But as usual when I hear Kimock, I often had the impression that he
was doing his usual thing of driving with the emergency brake on. He
gets in that mid-tempo zone of his and rarely really opens it up. It's
weird. I used to go to scads of Zero shows, back when STFU was still
just &quot;shaddup,&quot; and used to call Kimock &quot;my favorite living
guitarist.&quot; But from KVHW on, everything I heard seemed to have that
gas pedal/brake thing going.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Both Neil and I stated numerous times during the course of the evening

Well, you said you went in without expectations, which means you
couldn't have been expecting much, so that's a very lowered bar right
there. You don't go and see Jorma or Grisman without any expectations,
do ya?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I understand this sentiment, and without a doubt, Neal scooped Kerouac
completely, which was kind of odd, given the location and timing of
the event. But he's so indelibly linked to GD history, that this is
certainly understandable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

They do seem to be an up and down affair, given the comments about
them in general. I certainly hope that they do stay at this level and
certainly hope lots of folks go and see them. And Phil, too, for that
matter, even though what he's up to doesn't work for me in the least.
I fully support both guys and wish them all the best.

However, on top of the biweekly Deadnight, I go and see Workingman's
Ed and JGB whenever they pass through and every time I fully expect
them to rip the roof off the joint. And every time they do. Compared
to what I'm hearing on a regular basis, nothing I heard from that show
would qualify as a &quot;barnburner&quot; so I'm not inclined to pay three times
as much and roll the dice and hope for a good show *this* time.

Ratdog's vocal harmonies were beautiful when Mark was in the band,
with a few notable exceptions. Never could figure out, previously,
which one of the singers was so far off key.

Now that I've figured out who's who in the vocals, it seems to me that
Jay is the one who's been WAY off in the recent shows. (Maybe he
depends on hearing Mark's vocals to stay on key? Mark's basso voice
does carry very well.)

Anyway, I think the big problem is that Jay's mic is turned UP because
he's been singing some of the verses in the songs. One of the techie
people needs to turn Jay's mic DOWN on the songs where he's only
singing harmonies. Or Jay needs to practice (a LOT) singing harmonies
and staying on key.

Just my opinion,

&gt; &gt; &gt; ALL the vocals had been that bad, I'd be singing a different tune, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; I can easily forgive this, since the rest of the playing had such a
&gt; &gt; &gt; remarkable creative spark.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Peace,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Neil X.

&gt; &gt; Ratdog's vocal harmonies were beautiful when Mark was in the band,
&gt; &gt; with a few notable exceptions. Never could figure out, previously,
&gt; &gt; which one of the singers was so far off key.

&gt; &gt; Now that I've figured out who's who in the vocals, it seems to me that
&gt; &gt; Jay is the one who's been WAY off in the recent shows. (Maybe he
&gt; &gt; depends on hearing Mark's vocals to stay on key? Mark's basso voice
&gt; &gt; does carry very well.)

&gt; &gt; Anyway, I think the big problem is that Jay's mic is turned UP because
&gt; &gt; he's been singing some of the verses in the songs. One of the techie
&gt; &gt; people needs to turn Jay's mic DOWN on the songs where he's only
&gt; &gt; singing harmonies. Or Jay needs to practice (a LOT) singing harmonies
&gt; &gt; and staying on key.

&gt; &gt; Just my opinion,

&gt; &gt; katrinka-

&gt; How about turning his mic off completely?

LOL

I don't really when he sings a verse or two in a song, but he doesn't
seem to be able to hear himself in the harmonies.

Which reminds me, didn't someone post that Jay is now doing the Donna
Jean howls in Ratdog's version of PITB? I haven't heard any yet, but
it sounds plausible in a weir'd sort of way.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for it being a barnburner, well, I guess you had to be there, and I

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my case, saying it was the best Ratdog show I ever saw isn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily the greatest complement in the world.  But this show was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better than even many (most?) of the Phil shows I've seen.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is where I jumped onboard for the live stream, and I enjoyed it a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lot. Went and listened to the rest of the show the next day and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoyed that a lot as well. So please don't take this as my ragging on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the show.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if the vocals were a little rough during Wharf Rat, I don't think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that anybody in the place cared.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, Neil was the one that said they were &quot;horrendous.&quot; I was just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; echoing that.

Even Donna thinks that the howls were a giant mistake.
