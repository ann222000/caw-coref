OAKLAND -- Lane Kiffin has already earned a reputation for being
meticulous, so much so the first-year Raiders coach admitted the other
day, &quot;Some people think I do too many walk-throughs.&quot;

It stems from Kiffin's wish to predetermine the outcome as much as
possible, anticipating all the potential successes and pitfalls before
the ball is snapped.

If the Raiders didn't have to actually play, things would be far less
complicated.

There is no bigger decision Kiffin has to make than to select his first
quarterback, a call that didn't get any easier Saturday night when the
Raiders beat the Arizona Cardinals 27-23 at McAfee Coliseum.

Josh McCown, working with the first team against the Cardinals first
team, didn't seize the day but didn't lose ground either. Andrew Walter,
last year's tackling dummy, finished with a quarterback rating of 111.9.

If that wasn't enough, Daunte Culpepper fumbled his first snap then
showed flashes of the quarterback who threw 39 touchdown passes and had
11 interceptions in 2004 for the Minnesota Vikings.

&quot;It's going to make a tough decision for Kiff to see who is going to be
the head guy opening up against Detroit,&quot; wide receiver Jerry Porter
said. &quot;But it sure beats having three guys who don't know what the hell
they're doing.&quot;

At least Kiffin doesn't have to concern himself with the pressure of
whether or not to start the No. 1 draft choice. JaMarcus Russell has
removed himself from the equation for the foreseeable future by not
having agreed to a contract.

With Russell out of the picture, and no way to meld his three
quarterbacks into a single Andrew McCulpepper, Kiffin is looking for a
man who can stay away from turnovers.

Erase Culpepper's fumbled exchange, and the Raiders had no turnovers.

Kiffin is looking for a man who can create points.

It happened against Arizona in triplicate.

Kiffin wants someone to be a leader.

All three got their team in and out of the huddle and played with poise
and presence.

Thank goodness Jeff Otis didn't get in and throw a touchdown pass.

Given that the Raiders host Detroit in Week 1 and Cleveland in Week 3,
picking the right quarterback could mean a fast start which could
catapult a moribund franchise to mediocrity and beyond.

It's instant credibility for a 32-year-old head coach in charge of his
own team for the first time.

On the other hand, with Denver on the road in Week 2, picking the wrong
quarterback means the potential for 0-3, the possibility of another
laughing stock, and the local and national press pointing to Kiffin as
evidence that Al Davis hired the only guy that would take the job.

The guess here is that in his mental &quot;walk-through,&quot; Kiffin envisions
McCown as his Week 1 starter. McCown throws a decent pass and is the
best of the three operating the bootlegs and reverse rolls which will
involve backs and tight ends and keep drives alive.

McCown would be ideal for an offensive line which is new to zone
blocking -- a line which had an encouraging debut Saturday night across
the board. He was 5-for-9 for 42 yards, missing at least two passes he
could have completed. With the help of some Arizona penalties, McCown
left with a 7-0 lead after a 12-play, 80-yard march that consumed 7:05
of clock time.

&quot;After that first series, I felt good about what we were doing,&quot; McCown
said. &quot;It was good to have a long drive. Especially with your first-team
offense, you put together a long drive in the preseason and finish it
off with a touchdown, it helps build confidence.&quot;

Said Kiffin: &quot;I thought Josh did OK. (He) got the ball to the right
places, got us in and out of plays. I would have liked for him to be a
little more accurate at times.&quot;

Walter, 8-for-11 for 50 yards, had drive-sustaining completions of 14
yards to Zach Miller and 13 yards to John Madsen. He was conservative,
precise, and totally unwilling to offer an I-told-you-so after a single
exhibition game.

&quot;Nothing to hang your hat on,&quot; Walter said. &quot;Time to go back to work
tomorrow.&quot;

Kiffin lauded Walter's presence and command.

Logic suggests Walter remains the long shot here, given the Raiders'
desire to put an entirely new face on their 2006 offense.

Culpepper, given the ovation when he came in and the breathtaking nature
of a 50-yard strike to Johnnie Lee Higgins, will be the people's choice
even if he's not the choice of Kiffin.

More impressive than Culpepper's deep throw were a pair of roll-out
passes which were dropped -- one by Will Buchanon and another by
Higgins. They were precisely the kind of plays Culpepper was incapable
of running last year in four games with the Miami Dolphins, coming off a
serious knee injury.

&quot;It felt really good to be able to roll out in the pocket and make an
accurate throw,&quot; Culpepper said. &quot;That's kind of what I wanted to see,
if I could get out and do it against a defense in a game. It felt good.
It's a starting point. It's something to build on.&quot;

So now what? Kiffin said he's not sure how to best go about the
remainder of training camp. Does he give Walter and Culpepper shots with
the first team? Does he try and get McCown running smoothly and trust
his first instinct? No walk-through is going to give him the answer.
Kiffin will have to come up with that on his own.

Thats why it adds to the suckage of Rhodes being out for the first four.

Unless Jordan miraculously learns to hit holes in the off-season, having
no running game only adds to the pressure of the QB.

I think Fargas will have to have an opportunity if Jordan isn't
healthy.  Look for the &quot;E&quot; man to back him up.  May a couple of plays
for Lamont.

We are going to see a lot more action from our FB and TE positions I
think this season.

My ultimate joy will be watching Rhodes and Bush in the backfield
together..
