"Better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer," says English jurist William Blackstone. The ratio 10:1 has become known as the "Blackstone ratio" and seems to be the most frequently cited figure in discussions of the mathematics of tolerable error in the administration of criminal justice. But, as Alexander Volokh points out, the Blackstone ratio as not gone unchallenged:Maimonides, for example, thought that 1000:1 was right; Benjamin Franklin plumped for 100:1 and so on. (Feliks Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Soviet secret police, had a different view of things : "Better to execute ten innocent men than to leave one guilty man alive.")

How about this ratio: 25,999,999,999,999,999,999:1. That's quintillions, friend:

Although the odds that DNA evidence found at a crime scene will match by chance the DNA of a person who was not there are infinitesimal, controversy continues about DNA identification and its use in criminal investigations, says Carnegie Mellon University Statistics Professor Kathryn Roeder. Roeder will present a historical overview of the use of DNA identification on Tuesday, April 25, during the Annual Symposia of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. .

Some controversy remains concerning the so-called "cold hit" technique, in which investigators search a DNA database to find a match of DNA found at a crime scene and then collect other evidence to build their case -- as opposed to first identifying a suspect through other evidence and then using DNA to confirm their case. Some critics claimed that this practice could snag an innocent person, but Roeder has demonstrated through her own research that the likelihood of a false hit are miniscule -- in one case, for example, it was about 1 in 26 quintillion , a probability so slight it needn't be shared with juries, Roeder said.

"The jury can't handle such small numbers. We would do them a service to simply tell them it matches or it doesn't match," Roeder said.
