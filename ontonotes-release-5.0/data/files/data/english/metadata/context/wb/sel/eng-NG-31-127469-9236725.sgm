I was told by God to stay away from the group for one week. And so I
have. Apparently the inundation of bad feelings on the group focused
towards me, is something that God does not appreciate and thinks may
be doing me harm. So I have said I would stay away until Monday. Which
I did. This will be sent out after Midnight on Sunday. And I won't be
fighting with anyone about the contents of this post. And no, I won't
be getting reading  or writing lessons, especially from the failed
readers and writers of this NG.

Because some people demand I have a spell checker handy, I am writing
this in my MSN mail so that I can spell check it. It would seem that
if a person misspells a word here on the NG, they cannot be a PROPHET!
LOL!

What really gets me is how these people cannot tell when they are
getting their chains pulled. For crying out loud! I am no prophet,
anymore than anyone is. I said right out &quot;Prophet in his own mind.&quot; I
pointed out that I was not a Biblical Prophet. That I only met the
criteria for the most general definitions. But believe me, since I am
the ONLY person who actually delivered a couple of prophecies here,
one being that Y2K would end up being nothing at all and the other
that No Meteor or Asteroid would hit the earth in August 2006, and
another that the world would not end in 2001...well I think I can
safely say I was one hundred percent accurate. This was after others
came on the NG and swore that these things were going to devastate the
country.

We have another local prophet who tried to warn us last year that the
deflated dollar would cause financial ruination and to watch the Gold
commodities markets! Well gold sells high, but the economy still goes
on, people still go to work, do banking, buy and sell real estate,
etc. etc. So what of that minor prophecy?

We had another crazy visionary transsexual from Canada who used to go
on about how every time America worked on the HAARP project that some
huge earthquake or tsunami would destroy somewhere (somewhere other
than America of course! LOL!) &quot;The Earth Moves&quot; He or She would scream
at us! Of course it does, you could predict a major earthquake any day
of the week and find one somewhere. But guess what? The world is not
at an end just yet. And for all the crazy prophecies and parables and
weird poetic visions this person had, not one of them was even
understandable to most of us, let alone true. And of course He/She is
gone from the board...most likely shot in the head by the person she
said was stalking her on account of her/his prophetic utterances! She
was after all one of the Two Witnesses mentioned in St. John's
Revelations! Wonderful how the self-aggrandizing, pompous and just
plain weird can get on this NG, say anything they want and yet it is
my obvious joke of a post that gets the heat.

Let's see, we have another one on board who says they deal with Djinn!
Gee whiz! Didn't Solomon the King of Israel have that secret magical
power!? Imagine, some truck driving contractor now has the SAME
CAPABILITIES! Wow! I'm impressed. And the more he swears at harmless
newbies, the more I want to believe his words about God. Not.

Then we have a guy who lords it over this board telling us that
because we do not have pure hearts we cannot understand, see or know
his angels! Not only that, he disallows us from even talking about
other angels by twisting everything around to it being about HIS
angels! His angels play baseball and basketball, they protect us from
the dark by flying to heaven to bring back light...he tells these
obviously made-up fairy tales about angels with wings and then tells
us we are impure because we do not believe in angels having
wings...well gee, Superman doesn't have wings, but he flies! And so
does a Boeing pilot. So does James Bond with his jet-pack! LOL! Lot's
of people flying around without wings. A rocket goes to outerspace, it
doesn't have wings! And people float around up there free from all
gravitational restraint...where this one says Heaven is...and still,
no wings! Yet no bird with wings, nor any airplane or helicopter, can
actually make it into outer space! You know why? Wings need support of
the AIR. If outerspace is heaven, then there is NO NEED FOR WINGS and
wings will NOT GET YOU THERE because there is no air. This is science
fact. Of course we get our scientific facts about the Sun being
composed of heavy metals, from this so-called Angel Master who thinks
he sees angels on every street corner. He doesn't even know how his
own television works! And we are supposed to listen to his words??? I
guess if we all want to live in the Dark Ages, we could do that.

The point is, if these are the facts in this awfully stupid case, then
you could do no worse than to listen to me as your prophet! I gave
three genuine prophecies. Each one true. I talk to God. I talk to
angels. I see visions. I dream dreams. I had past lives where I knew
famous people! Come on, get on board my bandwagon!!!

And let's get real here for one moment. For 300 years now scholars of
the Bible have understood that none of the stories in it are &quot;true.&quot;
Even the true ones cannot be wholly accurate, because it has been two
thousand long years since they were written down and the writings have
been changed. Even the worst curser among us believes that now! Yet
everyone here wants to use the Bible as their basis for maligning me
and my beliefs! I'm New Age. I'm a P. T. Barnum. I'm a slimy &quot;writer&quot;
who is trying to &quot;con&quot; people into believing....what? That everything
is One? That God is Love, unconditional love? That you don't have to
be &quot;pure of heart&quot; or even a Christian influenced person to know and
speak with God? Wow! I am really a giant con-artist! Maybe as big a
con artist as &quot;Saint&quot; Paul or Buddha Gautama! I say you can all speak
with God, that you are all part of God and that God wants us to do
well, prosper, be healthy and joyous! And for this I am lambasted
because I chose to swear at a couple of people who swore at me. Or
because I out did them on some idiotic &quot;test&quot; they set up...or worse,
because I told one of these sock-puppets that he was lying about his
&quot;mother!&quot; (again I say prove you even had a mother by revealing your
true identity, name and history...) For that they rake me over what
they think are their hot coals of derision. PLEASE! Pull the other leg
people!

Ask yourselves why anyone would listen to you who bark at others for
being a liar before they get a word out? Why would they believe you
who swear at innocent people? Who attack people who have not harmed
you? You who accuse EVERYONE here of being my sock-puppets or
disciples, when you say you can actually read computer codes and can't
figure out WHO ANYONE IS!?

Do you understand yet the joke is on you? When you dismiss me. YOU
DISMISS YOURSELVES. When you make the NG about me and how much you
think you can cajole me, you denigrate (and no, that word does not
have anything to do with the word &quot;nigger!&quot;) the entire NG and your
own designs! When you flatly deny me my freedom of speech (which I
used liberally against that very person which one of you now rails on
a daily basis yourself!) you deny it to yourselves. When you yell
&quot;Liar&quot; you are yelling at yourselves, all of you who have lied against
me from the first day you came on this NG! How could you NOT lie? You
KNOW NOTHING about me! NOTHING but what I have told you! You don't
know if I am really married, if I am really as old as I say I am, if I
am a man or a woman, you don't know where I live or what I do for a
living, unless and until I tell you something...and then how do you
know I am not lying??? After all to you I am already a liar. So maybe
everything you think is true about me is nothing but lies. Point is,
you don't know. You're prophets only in your own minds as well. As are
we all. But you stick with your boxed in minds and I'll stick with my
open one.

So in other words, you took a week off and still haven't learned to
be nice to other people. That figures. Your post is also now reaching
the length of a book, is boring, and hasn't mentioned either anything
new, nor angels. So i just scanned down to see the rest of the
extreme length of your normal trash, noticed it was (again) all about
how you are great and everyone else is bad, and reckon you didn't
learn anything at all in an entire week. That figures.

&gt;&gt;fighting with anyone about the contents of this post. And no, I won't
&gt;&gt;be getting reading  or writing lessons, especially from the failed
&gt;&gt;readers and writers of this NG.

&gt;&gt;Because some people demand I have a spell checker handy, I am writing
&gt;&gt;this in my MSN mail so that I can spell check it. It would seem that
&gt;&gt;if a person misspells a word here on the NG, they cannot be a PROPHET!
&gt;&gt;LOL!

&gt;&gt;What really gets me is how these people cannot tell when they are
&gt;&gt;getting their chains pulled. For crying out loud! I am no prophet,
&gt;&gt;anymore than anyone is. I said right out &quot;Prophet in his own mind.&quot; I
&gt;&gt;pointed out that I was not a Biblical Prophet. That I only met the
&gt;&gt;criteria for the most general definitions. But believe me, since I am
&gt;&gt;the ONLY person who actually delivered a couple of prophecies here,
&gt;&gt;one being that Y2K would end up being nothing at all and the other
&gt;&gt;that No Meteor or Asteroid would hit the earth in August 2006, and
&gt;&gt;another that the world would not end in 2001...well I think I can
&gt;&gt;safely say I was one hundred percent accurate. This was after others
&gt;&gt;came on the NG and swore that these things were going to devastate the
&gt;&gt;country.

&gt;&gt;We have another local prophet who tried to warn us last year that the
&gt;&gt;deflated dollar would cause financial ruination and to watch the Gold
&gt;&gt;commodities markets! Well gold sells high, but the economy still goes
&gt;&gt;on, people still go to work, do banking, buy and sell real estate,
&gt;&gt;etc. etc. So what of that minor prophecy?

&gt;&gt;We had another crazy visionary transsexual from Canada who used to go
&gt;&gt;on about how every time America worked on the HAARP project that some
&gt;&gt;huge earthquake or tsunami would destroy somewhere (somewhere other
&gt;&gt;than America of course! LOL!) &quot;The Earth Moves&quot; He or She would scream
&gt;&gt;at us! Of course it does, you could predict a major earthquake any day
&gt;&gt;of the week and find one somewhere. But guess what? The world is not
&gt;&gt;at an end just yet. And for all the crazy prophecies and parables and
&gt;&gt;weird poetic visions this person had, not one of them was even
&gt;&gt;understandable to most of us, let alone true. And of course He/She is
&gt;&gt;gone from the board...most likely shot in the head by the person she
&gt;&gt;said was stalking her on account of her/his prophetic utterances! She
&gt;&gt;was after all one of the Two Witnesses mentioned in St. John's
&gt;&gt;Revelations! Wonderful how the self-aggrandizing, pompous and just
&gt;&gt;plain weird can get on this NG, say anything they want and yet it is
&gt;&gt;my obvious joke of a post that gets the heat.

&gt;&gt;Let's see, we have another one on board who says they deal with Djinn!
&gt;&gt;Gee whiz! Didn't Solomon the King of Israel have that secret magical
&gt;&gt;power!? Imagine, some truck driving contractor now has the SAME
&gt;&gt;CAPABILITIES! Wow! I'm impressed. And the more he swears at harmless
&gt;&gt;newbies, the more I want to believe his words about God. Not.

&gt;&gt;Then we have a guy who lords it over this board telling us that
&gt;&gt;because we do not have pure hearts we cannot understand, see or know
&gt;&gt;his angels! Not only that, he disallows us from even talking about
&gt;&gt;other angels by twisting everything around to it being about HIS
&gt;&gt;angels! His angels play baseball and basketball, they protect us from
&gt;&gt;the dark by flying to heaven to bring back light...he tells these
&gt;&gt;obviously made-up fairy tales about angels with wings and then tells
&gt;&gt;us we are impure because we do not believe in angels having
&gt;&gt;wings...well gee, Superman doesn't have wings, but he flies! And so
&gt;&gt;does a Boeing pilot. So does James Bond with his jet-pack! LOL! Lot's
&gt;&gt;of people flying around without wings. A rocket goes to outerspace, it
&gt;&gt;doesn't have wings! And people float around up there free from all
&gt;&gt;gravitational restraint...where this one says Heaven is...and still,
&gt;&gt;no wings! Yet no bird with wings, nor any airplane or helicopter, can
&gt;&gt;actually make it into outer space! You know why? Wings need support of
&gt;&gt;the AIR. If outerspace is heaven, then there is NO NEED FOR WINGS and
&gt;&gt;wings will NOT GET YOU THERE because there is no air. This is science
&gt;&gt;fact. Of course we get our scientific facts about the Sun being
&gt;&gt;composed of heavy metals, from this so-called Angel Master who thinks
&gt;&gt;he sees angels on every street corner. He doesn't even know how his
&gt;&gt;own television works! And we are supposed to listen to his words??? I
&gt;&gt;guess if we all want to live in the Dark Ages, we could do that.

&gt;&gt;The point is, if these are the facts in this awfully stupid case, then
&gt;&gt;you could do no worse than to listen to me as your prophet! I gave
&gt;&gt;three genuine prophecies. Each one true. I talk to God. I talk to
&gt;&gt;angels. I see visions. I dream dreams. I had past lives where I knew
&gt;&gt;famous people! Come on, get on board my bandwagon!!!

&gt;&gt;And let's get real here for one moment. For 300 years now scholars of
&gt;&gt;the Bible have understood that none of the stories in it are &quot;true.&quot;
&gt;&gt;Even the true ones cannot be wholly accurate, because it has been two
&gt;&gt;thousand long years since they were written down and the writings have
&gt;&gt;been changed. Even the worst curser among us believes that now! Yet
&gt;&gt;everyone here wants to use the Bible as their basis for maligning me
&gt;&gt;and my beliefs! I'm New Age. I'm a P. T. Barnum. I'm a slimy &quot;writer&quot;
&gt;&gt;who is trying to &quot;con&quot; people into believing....what? That everything
&gt;&gt;is One? That God is Love, unconditional love? That you don't have to
&gt;&gt;be &quot;pure of heart&quot; or even a Christian influenced person to know and
&gt;&gt;speak with God? Wow! I am really a giant con-artist! Maybe as big a
&gt;&gt;con artist as &quot;Saint&quot; Paul or Buddha Gautama! I say you can all speak
&gt;&gt;with God, that you are all part of God and that God wants us to do
&gt;&gt;well, prosper, be healthy and joyous! And for this I am lambasted
&gt;&gt;because I chose to swear at a couple of people who swore at me. Or
&gt;&gt;because I out did them on some idiotic &quot;test&quot; they set up...or worse,
&gt;&gt;because I told one of these sock-puppets that he was lying about his
&gt;&gt;&quot;mother!&quot; (again I say prove you even had a mother by revealing your
&gt;&gt;true identity, name and history...) For that they rake me over what
&gt;&gt;they think are their hot coals of derision. PLEASE! Pull the other leg
&gt;&gt;people!

&gt;&gt;Ask yourselves why anyone would listen to you who bark at others for
&gt;&gt;being a liar before they get a word out? Why would they believe you
&gt;&gt;who swear at innocent people? Who attack people who have not harmed
&gt;&gt;you? You who accuse EVERYONE here of being my sock-puppets or
&gt;&gt;disciples, when you say you can actually read computer codes and can't
&gt;&gt;figure out WHO ANYONE IS!?

&gt;&gt;Do you understand yet the joke is on you? When you dismiss me. YOU
&gt;&gt;DISMISS YOURSELVES. When you make the NG about me and how much you
&gt;&gt;think you can cajole me, you denigrate (and no, that word does not
&gt;&gt;have anything to do with the word &quot;nigger!&quot;) the entire NG and your
&gt;&gt;own designs! When you flatly deny me my freedom of speech (which I
&gt;&gt;used liberally against that very person which one of you now rails on
&gt;&gt;a daily basis yourself!) you deny it to yourselves. When you yell
&gt;&gt;&quot;Liar&quot; you are yelling at yourselves, all of you who have lied against
&gt;&gt;me from the first day you came on this NG! How could you NOT lie? You
&gt;&gt;KNOW NOTHING about me! NOTHING but what I have told you! You don't
&gt;&gt;know if I am really married, if I am really as old as I say I am, if I
&gt;&gt;am a man or a woman, you don't know where I live or what I do for a
&gt;&gt;living, unless and until I tell you something...and then how do you
&gt;&gt;know I am not lying??? After all to you I am already a liar. So maybe
&gt;&gt;everything you think is true about me is nothing but lies. Point is,
&gt;&gt;you don't know. You're prophets only in your own minds as well. As are
&gt;&gt;we all. But you stick with your boxed in minds and I'll stick with my
&gt;&gt;open one.

I wish he told me that.
So Saint can you prove he talks to you? I asked another nutcase I meet last
weekend to prove God talks to him by telling him to say something about me I
havnt told him and he said God cant give signs. I guess thats what your
answer is going to be as well.

&gt; &gt; being a liar before they get a word out? Why would they believe you
&gt; &gt; who swear at innocent people? Who attack people who have not harmed
&gt; &gt; you? You who accuse EVERYONE here of being my sock-puppets or
&gt; &gt; disciples, when you say you can actually read computer codes and can't
&gt; &gt; figure out WHO ANYONE IS!?

&gt; &gt; Do you understand yet the joke is on you? When you dismiss me. YOU
&gt; &gt; DISMISS YOURSELVES. When you make the NG about me and how much you
&gt; &gt; think you can cajole me, you denigrate (and no, that word does not
&gt; &gt; have anything to do with the word &quot;nigger!&quot;) the entire NG and your
&gt; &gt; own designs! When you flatly deny me my freedom of speech (which I
&gt; &gt; used liberally against that very person which one of you now rails on
&gt; &gt; a daily basis yourself!) you deny it to yourselves. When you yell
&gt; &gt; &quot;Liar&quot; you are yelling at yourselves, all of you who have lied against
&gt; &gt; me from the first day you came on this NG! How could you NOT lie? You
&gt; &gt; KNOW NOTHING about me! NOTHING but what I have told you! You don't
&gt; &gt; know if I am really married, if I am really as old as I say I am, if I
&gt; &gt; am a man or a woman, you don't know where I live or what I do for a
&gt; &gt; living, unless and until I tell you something...and then how do you
&gt; &gt; know I am not lying??? After all to you I am already a liar. So maybe
&gt; &gt; everything you think is true about me is nothing but lies. Point is,
&gt; &gt; you don't know. You're prophets only in your own minds as well. As are
&gt; &gt; we all. But you stick with your boxed in minds and I'll stick with my
&gt; &gt; open one.

Why use other words? God said don't come back until Monday. it is now
Monday. God was not defied. God cannot be &quot;defied&quot; since we have free

You keep wanting to use other words. What really is this immature
thing you have about lying, getting &quot;caught&quot; and trying to make people
feel guilty? You lie all the time. In fact you are a lie yourself. So
what? Why would I apologize to a lie? Do I know you? Have I offended
the &quot;real you&quot; somehow? I doubt that sincerely. Why don't you
apologize ot me for lying about me? You know I do not drink, smoke or
gamble. And yet you accuse me of things I do not do. So apologize this
minute you drunken wife beater! LOL!

If you had any money, you wouldn't be on this NG. But this is your
little way of making a guy supposedly feel bad, telling him  he
doesn't have any money, like you are rich and you are what? Powerful,
influential? You are nothing but a mad sock puppet. And you have no
gold, nor any money. And whomever it was was simply trying to pretend
to know something about economics when he literally knows nothing. His
prophecy was negative and did not come true. Hence he was no prophet.
Nor even a profit.

There's those other words again...I really don't need an interpreter.

Well, let's see I was gone a week and you haven't learned to be nice

So I guess that means you didn't even get the joke. Which was on you.

&gt; &gt;&gt;I was told by God to stay away from the group for one week. And so I
&gt; &gt;&gt;have. Apparently the inundation of bad feelings on the group focused
&gt; &gt;&gt;towards me, is something that God does not appreciate and thinks may
&gt; &gt;&gt;be doing me harm. So I have said I would stay away until Monday. Which
&gt; &gt;&gt;I did. This will be sent out after Midnight on Sunday. And I won't be
&gt; &gt;&gt;fighting with anyone about the contents of this post. And no, I won't
&gt; &gt;&gt;be getting reading  or writing lessons, especially from the failed
&gt; &gt;&gt;readers and writers of this NG.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Because some people demand I have a spell checker handy, I am writing
&gt; &gt;&gt;this in my MSN mail so that I can spell check it. It would seem that
&gt; &gt;&gt;if a person misspells a word here on the NG, they cannot be a PROPHET!
&gt; &gt;&gt;LOL!

&gt; &gt;&gt;What really gets me is how these people cannot tell when they are
&gt; &gt;&gt;getting their chains pulled. For crying out loud! I am no prophet,
&gt; &gt;&gt;anymore than anyone is. I said right out &quot;Prophet in his own mind.&quot; I
&gt; &gt;&gt;pointed out that I was not a Biblical Prophet. That I only met the
&gt; &gt;&gt;criteria for the most general definitions. But believe me, since I am
&gt; &gt;&gt;the ONLY person who actually delivered a couple of prophecies here,
&gt; &gt;&gt;one being that Y2K would end up being nothing at all and the other
&gt; &gt;&gt;that No Meteor or Asteroid would hit the earth in August 2006, and
&gt; &gt;&gt;another that the world would not end in 2001...well I think I can
&gt; &gt;&gt;safely say I was one hundred percent accurate. This was after others
&gt; &gt;&gt;came on the NG and swore that these things were going to devastate the
&gt; &gt;&gt;country.

&gt; &gt;&gt;We have another local prophet who tried to warn us last year that the
&gt; &gt;&gt;deflated dollar would cause financial ruination and to watch the Gold
&gt; &gt;&gt;commodities markets! Well gold sells high, but the economy still goes
&gt; &gt;&gt;on, people still go to work, do banking, buy and sell real estate,
&gt; &gt;&gt;etc. etc. So what of that minor prophecy?

&gt; &gt;&gt;We had another crazy visionary transsexual from Canada who used to go
&gt; &gt;&gt;on about how every time America worked on the HAARP project that some
&gt; &gt;&gt;huge earthquake or tsunami would destroy somewhere (somewhere other
&gt; &gt;&gt;than America of course! LOL!) &quot;The Earth Moves&quot; He or She would scream
&gt; &gt;&gt;at us! Of course it does, you could predict a major earthquake any day
&gt; &gt;&gt;of the week and find one somewhere. But guess what? The world is not
&gt; &gt;&gt;at an end just yet. And for all the crazy prophecies and parables and
&gt; &gt;&gt;weird poetic visions this person had, not one of them was even
&gt; &gt;&gt;understandable to most of us, let alone true. And of course He/She is
&gt; &gt;&gt;gone from the board...most likely shot in the head by the person she
&gt; &gt;&gt;said was stalking her on account of her/his prophetic utterances! She
&gt; &gt;&gt;was after all one of the Two Witnesses mentioned in St. John's
&gt; &gt;&gt;Revelations! Wonderful how the self-aggrandizing, pompous and just
&gt; &gt;&gt;plain weird can get on this NG, say anything they want and yet it is
&gt; &gt;&gt;my obvious joke of a post that gets the heat.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Let's see, we have another one on board who says they deal with Djinn!
&gt; &gt;&gt;Gee whiz! Didn't Solomon the King of Israel have that secret magical
&gt; &gt;&gt;power!? Imagine, some truck driving contractor now has the SAME
&gt; &gt;&gt;CAPABILITIES! Wow! I'm impressed. And the more he swears at harmless
&gt; &gt;&gt;newbies, the more I want to believe his words about God. Not.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Then we have a guy who lords it over this board telling us that
&gt; &gt;&gt;because we do not have pure hearts we cannot understand, see or know
&gt; &gt;&gt;his angels! Not only that, he disallows us from even talking about
&gt; &gt;&gt;other angels by twisting everything around to it being about HIS
&gt; &gt;&gt;angels! His angels play baseball and basketball, they protect us from
&gt; &gt;&gt;the dark by flying to heaven to bring back light...he tells these
&gt; &gt;&gt;obviously made-up fairy tales about angels with wings and then tells
&gt; &gt;&gt;us we are impure because we do not believe in angels having
&gt; &gt;&gt;wings...well gee, Superman doesn't have wings, but he flies! And so
&gt; &gt;&gt;does a Boeing pilot. So does James Bond with his jet-pack! LOL! Lot's
&gt; &gt;&gt;of people flying around without wings. A rocket goes to outerspace, it
&gt; &gt;&gt;doesn't have wings! And people float around up there free from all
&gt; &gt;&gt;gravitational restraint...where this one says Heaven is...and still,
&gt; &gt;&gt;no wings! Yet no bird with wings, nor any airplane or helicopter, can
&gt; &gt;&gt;actually make it into outer space! You know why? Wings need support of
&gt; &gt;&gt;the AIR. If outerspace is heaven, then there is NO NEED FOR WINGS and
&gt; &gt;&gt;wings will NOT GET YOU THERE because there is no air. This is science
&gt; &gt;&gt;fact. Of course we get our scientific facts about the Sun being
&gt; &gt;&gt;composed of heavy metals, from this so-called Angel Master who thinks
&gt; &gt;&gt;he sees angels on every street corner. He doesn't even know how his
&gt; &gt;&gt;own television works! And we are supposed to listen to his words??? I
&gt; &gt;&gt;guess if we all want to live in the Dark Ages, we could do that.

&gt; &gt;&gt;The point is, if these are the facts in this awfully stupid case, then
&gt; &gt;&gt;you could do no worse than to listen to me as your prophet! I gave
&gt; &gt;&gt;three genuine prophecies. Each one true. I talk to God. I talk to
&gt; &gt;&gt;angels. I see visions. I dream dreams. I had past lives where I knew
&gt; &gt;&gt;famous people! Come on, get on board my bandwagon!!!

&gt; &gt;&gt;And let's get real here for one moment. For 300 years now scholars of
&gt; &gt;&gt;the Bible have understood that none of the stories in it are &quot;true.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Even the true ones cannot be wholly accurate, because it has been two
&gt; &gt;&gt;thousand long years since they were written down and the writings have
&gt; &gt;&gt;been changed. Even the worst curser among us believes that now! Yet
&gt; &gt;&gt;everyone here wants to use the Bible as their basis for maligning me
&gt; &gt;&gt;and my beliefs! I'm New Age. I'm a P. T. Barnum. I'm a slimy &quot;writer&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;who is trying to &quot;con&quot; people into believing....what? That everything
&gt; &gt;&gt;is One? That God is Love, unconditional love? That you don't have to
&gt; &gt;&gt;be &quot;pure of heart&quot; or even a Christian influenced person to know and
&gt; &gt;&gt;speak with God? Wow! I am really a giant con-artist! Maybe as big a
&gt; &gt;&gt;con artist as &quot;Saint&quot; Paul or Buddha Gautama! I say you can all speak
&gt; &gt;&gt;with God, that you are all part of God and that God wants us to do
&gt; &gt;&gt;well, prosper, be healthy and joyous! And for this I am lambasted
&gt; &gt;&gt;because I chose to swear at a couple of people who swore at me. Or
&gt; &gt;&gt;because I out did them on some idiotic &quot;test&quot; they set up...or worse,
&gt; &gt;&gt;because I told one of these sock-puppets that he was lying about his
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;mother!&quot; (again I say prove you even had a mother by revealing your
&gt; &gt;&gt;true identity, name and history...) For that they rake me over what
&gt; &gt;&gt;they think are their hot coals of derision. PLEASE! Pull the other leg
&gt; &gt;&gt;people!

&gt; &gt;&gt;Ask yourselves why anyone would listen to you who bark at others for
&gt; &gt;&gt;being a liar before they get a word out? Why would they believe you
&gt; &gt;&gt;who swear at innocent people? Who attack people who have not harmed

Hmm, seems to me Jesus said: You ask for signs and miracles and I tell
you none shall be given unto you...I guess he was just an asshole too.
But if you had read my post you would have heard me tell you three
things that God told me about you. One was you weren't hurt by Y2K,
the others were you wern't killed by a meteor in 2006 and the world
wasn't facing an apocalypse in 2001 so God didn't rapture you. Now
what you want is personal information. Like your what? Your atm pin
number? How about your social security number? Do you want me to tell
everyone when the last time you masturbated or picked your nose was?
Do you think God doesn't know these things? But you would like me to
tell everyone here on the NG secret and important things about
yourself so they can know you as well as God does! And then maybe
you'll believe I speak with God.

Get a grip, Seon. We have RULES about INFORMATION for a reason. If God
needed to get a message to you through me for something important I
would invite you to a PRIVATE conversation. I get important messages
for people all the time. I tell them PERSONALLY. Not publically. Now,
since you want to play this carnival game of &quot;Guess My Weight&quot; and
then you'll believe in my version of God or my abilities to speak with
God, then you are being a fool. And I don't care for fools. Psychic
abilities are not to be used as a game for NGs. If you don't believe I
have any, so what? All it really means is you haven't the nerve to
speak with me in private and to commune with God in faith, rather than
in skepticism. You already have no faith in me. Nor in God, Which is
why you are still searching, still researching. As I said, keep
researching. God knows the path you seek.

&gt;&gt; &gt; thousand long years since they were written down and the writings have
&gt;&gt; &gt; been changed. Even the worst curser among us believes that now! Yet
&gt;&gt; &gt; everyone here wants to use the Bible as their basis for maligning me
&gt;&gt; &gt; and my beliefs! I'm New Age. I'm a P. T. Barnum. I'm a slimy &quot;writer&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; who is trying to &quot;con&quot; people into believing....what? That everything
&gt;&gt; &gt; is One? That God is Love, unconditional love? That you don't have to
&gt;&gt; &gt; be &quot;pure of heart&quot; or even a Christian influenced person to know and
&gt;&gt; &gt; speak with God? Wow! I am really a giant con-artist! Maybe as big a
&gt;&gt; &gt; con artist as &quot;Saint&quot; Paul or Buddha Gautama! I say you can all speak
&gt;&gt; &gt; with God, that you are all part of God and that God wants us to do
&gt;&gt; &gt; well, prosper, be healthy and joyous! And for this I am lambasted
&gt;&gt; &gt; because I chose to swear at a couple of people who swore at me. Or
&gt;&gt; &gt; because I out did them on some idiotic &quot;test&quot; they set up...or worse,
&gt;&gt; &gt; because I told one of these sock-puppets that he was lying about his
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;mother!&quot; (again I say prove you even had a mother by revealing your
&gt;&gt; &gt; true identity, name and history...) For that they rake me over what
&gt;&gt; &gt; they think are their hot coals of derision. PLEASE! Pull the other leg
&gt;&gt; &gt; people!

&gt;&gt; &gt; Ask yourselves why anyone would listen to you who bark at others for
&gt;&gt; &gt; being a liar before they get a word out? Why would they believe you
&gt;&gt; &gt; who swear at innocent people? Who attack people who have not harmed
&gt;&gt; &gt; you? You who accuse EVERYONE here of being my sock-puppets or
&gt;&gt; &gt; disciples, when you say you can actually read computer codes and can't
&gt;&gt; &gt; figure out WHO ANYONE IS!?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you understand yet the joke is on you? When you dismiss me. YOU
&gt;&gt; &gt; DISMISS YOURSELVES. When you make the NG about me and how much you
&gt;&gt; &gt; think you can cajole me, you denigrate (and no, that word does not
&gt;&gt; &gt; have anything to do with the word &quot;nigger!&quot;) the entire NG and your
&gt;&gt; &gt; own designs! When you flatly deny me my freedom of speech (which I
&gt;&gt; &gt; used liberally against that very person which one of you now rails on
&gt;&gt; &gt; a daily basis yourself!) you deny it to yourselves. When you yell
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Liar&quot; you are yelling at yourselves, all of you who have lied against
&gt;&gt; &gt; me from the first day you came on this NG! How could you NOT lie? You
&gt;&gt; &gt; KNOW NOTHING about me! NOTHING but what I have told you! You don't
&gt;&gt; &gt; know if I am really married, if I am really as old as I say I am, if I
&gt;&gt; &gt; am a man or a woman, you don't know where I live or what I do for a
&gt;&gt; &gt; living, unless and until I tell you something...and then how do you
&gt;&gt; &gt; know I am not lying??? After all to you I am already a liar. So maybe
&gt;&gt; &gt; everything you think is true about me is nothing but lies. Point is,
&gt;&gt; &gt; you don't know. You're prophets only in your own minds as well. As are
&gt;&gt; &gt; we all. But you stick with your boxed in minds and I'll stick with my

&gt;&gt; So Saint can you prove he talks to you? I asked another nutcase I meet
&gt;&gt; last
&gt;&gt; weekend to prove God talks to him by telling him to say something about
&gt;&gt; me I
&gt;&gt; havnt told him and he said God cant give signs. I guess thats what your
&gt;&gt; answer is going to be as well.

&gt; Hmm, seems to me Jesus said: You ask for signs and miracles and I tell
&gt; you none shall be given unto you...I guess he was just an asshole too.
&gt; But if you had read my post you would have heard me tell you three
&gt; things that God told me about you. One was you weren't hurt by Y2K,
&gt; the others were you wern't killed by a meteor in 2006 and the world
&gt; wasn't facing an apocalypse in 2001 so God didn't rapture you. Now
&gt; what you want is personal information. Like your what? Your atm pin
&gt; number? How about your social security number? Do you want me to tell
&gt; everyone when the last time you masturbated or picked your nose was?
&gt; Do you think God doesn't know these things? But you would like me to
&gt; tell everyone here on the NG secret and important things about
&gt; yourself so they can know you as well as God does! And then maybe
&gt; you'll believe I speak with God.

&gt; Get a grip, Seon. We have RULES about INFORMATION for a reason. If God
&gt; needed to get a message to you through me for something important I
&gt; would invite you to a PRIVATE conversation. I get important messages
&gt; for people all the time. I tell them PERSONALLY. Not publically. Now,
&gt; since you want to play this carnival game of &quot;Guess My Weight&quot; and
&gt; then you'll believe in my version of God or my abilities to speak with
&gt; God, then you are being a fool. And I don't care for fools. Psychic
&gt; abilities are not to be used as a game for NGs. If you don't believe I
&gt; have any, so what? All it really means is you haven't the nerve to
&gt; speak with me in private and to commune with God in faith, rather than
&gt; in skepticism. You already have no faith in me. Nor in God, Which is
&gt; why you are still searching, still researching. As I said, keep
&gt; researching. God knows the path you seek.

&gt; Be well.

&gt;&gt;So, in other words, you were so impatient that you couldn't wait to
&gt;&gt;defy your God. That figures.

&gt; Why use other words?

Because by the time you finish dancing around what you mean to say,
a guy could grow a beard. You're a blow hard. I could sum up your entire
long post in a single sentence (and i did).

Now when are you going to tell us all about Jebeezus? What kind of
prophet are you? You sound more like Mark every time you post.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; God said don't come back until Monday. it is now
&gt; Monday. God was not defied. God cannot be &quot;defied&quot; since we have free
&gt; will and are God anyway. I just took His advice to see what would
&gt; happen to me. It was refreshing.

&gt;&gt;So, in other words, you lied, got caught, and now your trying to
&gt;&gt;weasel out of it without an apology. That figures.

&gt; You keep wanting to use other words. What really is this immature
&gt; thing you have about lying, getting &quot;caught&quot; and trying to make people
&gt; feel guilty? You lie all the time. In fact you are a lie yourself. So
&gt; what? Why would I apologize to a lie? Do I know you? Have I offended
&gt; the &quot;real you&quot; somehow? I doubt that sincerely. Why don't you
&gt; apologize ot me for lying about me? You know I do not drink, smoke or
&gt; gamble. And yet you accuse me of things I do not do. So apologize this
&gt; minute you drunken wife beater! LOL!

&gt;&gt;Prophecy? Whomever it was simply knew their stuff since the dollar is
&gt;&gt;at an all time low and still headed in that direction. If you had any
&gt;&gt;money to begin with then you might be singing a different tune. lol

&gt; If you had any money, you wouldn't be on this NG. But this is your
&gt; little way of making a guy supposedly feel bad, telling him  he
&gt; doesn't have any money, like you are rich and you are what? Powerful,
&gt; influential? You are nothing but a mad sock puppet. And you have no
&gt; gold, nor any money. And whomever it was was simply trying to pretend
&gt; to know something about economics when he literally knows nothing. His
&gt; prophecy was negative and did not come true. Hence he was no prophet.
&gt; Nor even a profit.

&gt;&gt;So in other words,

&gt; There's those other words again...I really don't need an interpreter.

&gt;&gt;you took a week off and still haven't learned to
&gt;&gt;be nice to other people.

&gt; Well, let's see I was gone a week and you haven't learned to be nice
&gt; to me. Where does that leave us? LOL!

&gt; So I guess that means you didn't even get the joke. Which was on you.

Hey now! Prophets aren't supposed to lie! Don't you read your own
stuff before you plop it out onto Usenet?  I swear you are getting
to be more like Mark every day.

Now let's hear about Jebeeezus, prophet! Tell us all about Jebeezus
and teach us all the things you taught to him and John and tell us
where the tent is at so we can praise the load!

&gt; &gt;&gt;I was told by God to stay away from the group for one week. And so I
&gt; &gt;&gt;have. Apparently the inundation of bad feelings on the group focused
&gt; &gt;&gt;towards me, is something that God does not appreciate and thinks may
&gt; &gt;&gt;be doing me harm. So I have said I would stay away until Monday. Which
&gt; &gt;&gt;I did. This will be sent out after Midnight on Sunday. And I won't be
&gt; &gt;&gt;fighting with anyone about the contents of this post. And no, I won't
&gt; &gt;&gt;be getting reading  or writing lessons, especially from the failed
&gt; &gt;&gt;readers and writers of this NG.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Because some people demand I have a spell checker handy, I am writing
&gt; &gt;&gt;this in my MSN mail so that I can spell check it. It would seem that
&gt; &gt;&gt;if a person misspells a word here on the NG, they cannot be a PROPHET!
&gt; &gt;&gt;LOL!

&gt; &gt;&gt;What really gets me is how these people cannot tell when they are
&gt; &gt;&gt;getting their chains pulled. For crying out loud! I am no prophet,
&gt; &gt;&gt;anymore than anyone is. I said right out &quot;Prophet in his own mind.&quot; I
&gt; &gt;&gt;pointed out that I was not a Biblical Prophet. That I only met the
&gt; &gt;&gt;criteria for the most general definitions. But believe me, since I am
&gt; &gt;&gt;the ONLY person who actually delivered a couple of prophecies here,
&gt; &gt;&gt;one being that Y2K would end up being nothing at all and the other
&gt; &gt;&gt;that No Meteor or Asteroid would hit the earth in August 2006, and
&gt; &gt;&gt;another that the world would not end in 2001...well I think I can
&gt; &gt;&gt;safely say I was one hundred percent accurate. This was after others
&gt; &gt;&gt;came on the NG and swore that these things were going to devastate the
&gt; &gt;&gt;country.

&gt; &gt;&gt;We have another local prophet who tried to warn us last year that the
&gt; &gt;&gt;deflated dollar would cause financial ruination and to watch the Gold
&gt; &gt;&gt;commodities markets! Well gold sells high, but the economy still goes
&gt; &gt;&gt;on, people still go to work, do banking, buy and sell real estate,
&gt; &gt;&gt;etc. etc. So what of that minor prophecy?

&gt; &gt;&gt;We had another crazy visionary transsexual from Canada who used to go
&gt; &gt;&gt;on about how every time America worked on the HAARP project that some
&gt; &gt;&gt;huge earthquake or tsunami would destroy somewhere (somewhere other
&gt; &gt;&gt;than America of course! LOL!) &quot;The Earth Moves&quot; He or She would scream
&gt; &gt;&gt;at us! Of course it does, you could predict a major earthquake any day
&gt; &gt;&gt;of the week and find one somewhere. But guess what? The world is not
&gt; &gt;&gt;at an end just yet. And for all the crazy prophecies and parables and
&gt; &gt;&gt;weird poetic visions this person had, not one of them was even
&gt; &gt;&gt;understandable to most of us, let alone true. And of course He/She is
&gt; &gt;&gt;gone from the board...most likely shot in the head by the person she
&gt; &gt;&gt;said was stalking her on account of her/his prophetic utterances! She
&gt; &gt;&gt;was after all one of the Two Witnesses mentioned in St. John's
&gt; &gt;&gt;Revelations! Wonderful how the self-aggrandizing, pompous and just
&gt; &gt;&gt;plain weird can get on this NG, say anything they want and yet it is
&gt; &gt;&gt;my obvious joke of a post that gets the heat.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Let's see, we have another one on board who says they deal with Djinn!
&gt; &gt;&gt;Gee whiz! Didn't Solomon the King of Israel have that secret magical
&gt; &gt;&gt;power!? Imagine, some truck driving contractor now has the SAME
&gt; &gt;&gt;CAPABILITIES! Wow! I'm impressed. And the more he swears at harmless
&gt; &gt;&gt;newbies, the more I want to believe his words about God. Not.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Then we have a guy who lords it over this board telling us that
&gt; &gt;&gt;because we do not have pure hearts we cannot understand, see or know
&gt; &gt;&gt;his angels! Not only that, he disallows us from even talking about
&gt; &gt;&gt;other angels by twisting everything around to it being about HIS
&gt; &gt;&gt;angels! His angels play baseball and basketball, they protect us from
&gt; &gt;&gt;the dark by flying to heaven to bring back light...he tells these
&gt; &gt;&gt;obviously made-up fairy tales about angels with wings and then tells
&gt; &gt;&gt;us we are impure because we do not believe in angels having
&gt; &gt;&gt;wings...well gee, Superman doesn't have wings, but he flies! And so
&gt; &gt;&gt;does a Boeing pilot. So does James Bond with his jet-pack! LOL! Lot's
&gt; &gt;&gt;of people flying around without wings. A rocket goes to outerspace, it
&gt; &gt;&gt;doesn't have wings! And people float around up there free from all
&gt; &gt;&gt;gravitational restraint...where this one says Heaven is...and still,
&gt; &gt;&gt;no wings! Yet no bird with wings, nor any airplane or helicopter, can
&gt; &gt;&gt;actually make it into outer space! You know why? Wings need support of
&gt; &gt;&gt;the AIR. If outerspace is heaven, then there is NO NEED FOR WINGS and
&gt; &gt;&gt;wings will NOT GET YOU THERE because there is no air. This is science
&gt; &gt;&gt;fact. Of course we get our scientific facts about the Sun being
&gt; &gt;&gt;composed of heavy metals, from this so-called Angel Master who thinks
&gt; &gt;&gt;he sees angels on every street corner. He doesn't even know how his
&gt; &gt;&gt;own television works! And we are supposed to listen to his words??? I
&gt; &gt;&gt;guess if we all want to live in the Dark Ages, we could do that.

&gt; &gt;&gt;The point is, if these are the facts in this awfully stupid case, then
&gt; &gt;&gt;you could do no worse than to listen to me as your prophet! I gave
&gt; &gt;&gt;three genuine prophecies. Each one true. I talk to God. I talk to
&gt; &gt;&gt;angels. I see visions. I dream dreams. I had past lives where I knew
&gt; &gt;&gt;famous people! Come on, get on board my bandwagon!!!

&gt; &gt;&gt;And let's get real here for one moment. For 300 years now scholars of
&gt; &gt;&gt;the Bible have understood that none of the stories in it are &quot;true.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Even the true ones cannot be wholly accurate, because it has been two
&gt; &gt;&gt;thousand long years since they were written down and the writings have
&gt; &gt;&gt;been changed. Even the worst curser among us believes that now! Yet
&gt; &gt;&gt;everyone here wants to use the Bible as their basis for maligning me
&gt; &gt;&gt;and my beliefs! I'm New Age. I'm a P. T. Barnum. I'm a slimy &quot;writer&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;because I chose to swear at a couple of people who swore at me. Or
&gt; &gt;&gt;because I out did them on some idiotic &quot;test&quot; they set up...or worse,
&gt; &gt;&gt;because I told one of these sock-puppets that he was lying about his
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;mother!&quot; (again I say prove you even had a mother by revealing your
&gt; &gt;&gt;true identity, name and history...) For that they rake me over what
&gt; &gt;&gt;they think are their hot coals of derision. PLEASE! Pull the other leg

&gt; &gt;&gt;Ask yourselves why anyone would listen to you who bark at others for
&gt; &gt;&gt;being a liar before they get a word out? Why would they believe you
&gt; &gt;&gt;who swear at innocent people? Who attack people who have not harmed

&gt; came on the NG and swore that these things were going to devastate the
&gt; country.

&gt; We have another local prophet who tried to warn us last year that the
&gt; deflated dollar would cause financial ruination and to watch the Gold
&gt; commodities markets! Well gold sells high, but the economy still goes
&gt; on, people still go to work, do banking, buy and sell real estate,
&gt; etc. etc. So what of that minor prophecy?

&gt; We had another crazy visionary transsexual from Canada who used to go
&gt; on about how every time America worked on the HAARP project that some
&gt; huge earthquake or tsunami would destroy somewhere (somewhere other
&gt; than America of course! LOL!) &quot;The Earth Moves&quot; He or She would scream
&gt; at us! Of course it does, you could predict a major earthquake any day
&gt; of the week and find one somewhere. But guess what? The world is not
&gt; at an end just yet. And for all the crazy prophecies and parables and
&gt; weird poetic visions this person had, not one of them was even
&gt; understandable to most of us, let alone true. And of course He/She is
&gt; gone from the board...most likely shot in the head by the person she
&gt; said was stalking her on account of her/his prophetic utterances! She
&gt; was after all one of the Two Witnesses mentioned in St. John's
&gt; Revelations! Wonderful how the self-aggrandizing, pompous and just
&gt; plain weird can get on this NG, say anything they want and yet it is
&gt; my obvious joke of a post that gets the heat.

&gt; Let's see, we have another one on board who says they deal with Djinn!
&gt; Gee whiz! Didn't Solomon the King of Israel have that secret magical
&gt; power!? Imagine, some truck driving contractor now has the SAME
&gt; CAPABILITIES! Wow! I'm impressed. And the more he swears at harmless
&gt; newbies, the more I want to believe his words about God. Not.

&gt; Then we have a guy who lords it over this board telling us that
&gt; because we do not have pure hearts we cannot understand, see or know
&gt; his angels! Not only that, he disallows us from even talking about
&gt; other angels by twisting everything around to it being about HIS
&gt; angels! His angels play baseball and basketball, they protect us from
&gt; the dark by flying to heaven to bring back light...he tells these
&gt; obviously made-up fairy tales about angels with wings and then tells
&gt; us we are impure because we do not believe in angels having
&gt; wings...well gee, Superman doesn't have wings, but he flies! And so
&gt; does a Boeing pilot. So does James Bond with his jet-pack! LOL! Lot's
&gt; of people flying around without wings. A rocket goes to outerspace, it
&gt; doesn't have wings! And people float around up there free from all
&gt; gravitational restraint...where this one says Heaven is...and still,
&gt; no wings! Yet no bird with wings, nor any airplane or helicopter, can
&gt; actually make it into outer space! You know why? Wings need support of
&gt; the AIR. If outerspace is heaven, then there is NO NEED FOR WINGS and
&gt; wings will NOT GET YOU THERE because there is no air. This is science
&gt; fact. Of course we get our scientific facts about the Sun being
&gt; composed of heavy metals, from this so-called Angel Master who thinks
&gt; he sees angels on every street corner. He doesn't even know how his
&gt; own television works! And we are supposed to listen to his words??? I
&gt; guess if we all want to live in the Dark Ages, we could do that.

&gt; The point is, if these are the facts in this awfully stupid case, then
&gt; you could do no worse than to listen to me as your prophet! I gave
&gt; three genuine prophecies. Each one true. I talk to God. I talk to
&gt; angels. I see visions. I dream dreams. I had past lives where I knew
&gt; famous people! Come on, get on board my bandwagon!!!

&gt; And let's get real here for one moment. For 300 years now scholars of
&gt; the Bible have understood that none of the stories in it are &quot;true.&quot;
&gt; Even the true ones cannot be wholly accurate, because it has been two
&gt; thousand long years since they were written down and the writings have
&gt; been changed. Even the worst curser among us believes that now! Yet
&gt; everyone here wants to use the Bible as their basis for maligning me
&gt; and my beliefs! I'm New Age. I'm a P. T. Barnum. I'm a slimy &quot;writer&quot;
&gt; who is trying to &quot;con&quot; people into believing....what? That everything
&gt; is One? That God is Love, unconditional love? That you don't have to
&gt; be &quot;pure of heart&quot; or even a Christian influenced person to know and
&gt; speak with God? Wow! I am really a giant con-artist! Maybe as big a
&gt; con artist as &quot;Saint&quot; Paul or Buddha Gautama! I say you can all speak
&gt; with God, that you are all part of God and that God wants us to do
&gt; well, prosper, be healthy and joyous! And for this I am lambasted
&gt; because I chose to swear at a couple of people who swore at me. Or
&gt; because I out did them on some idiotic &quot;test&quot; they set up...or worse,
&gt; because I told one of these sock-puppets that he was lying about his
&gt; &quot;mother!&quot; (again I say prove you even had a mother by revealing your
&gt; true identity, name and history...) For that they rake me over what
&gt; they think are their hot coals of derision. PLEASE! Pull the other leg
&gt; people!

&gt; Ask yourselves why anyone would listen to you who bark at others for
&gt; being a liar before they get a word out? Why would they believe you
&gt; who swear at innocent people? Who attack people who have not harmed
&gt; you? You who accuse EVERYONE here of being my sock-puppets or
&gt; disciples, when you say you can actually read computer codes and can't
&gt; figure out WHO ANYONE IS!?

&gt; Do you understand yet the joke is on you? When you dismiss me. YOU
&gt; DISMISS YOURSELVES. When you make the NG about me and how much you
&gt; think you can cajole me, you denigrate (and no, that word does not
&gt; have anything to do with the word &quot;nigger!&quot;) the entire NG and your
&gt; own designs! When you flatly deny me my freedom of speech (which I
&gt; used liberally against that very person which one of you now rails on
&gt; a daily basis yourself!) you deny it to yourselves. When you yell
&gt; &quot;Liar&quot; you are yelling at yourselves, all of you who have lied against
&gt; me from the first day you came on this NG! How could you NOT lie? You
&gt; KNOW NOTHING about me! NOTHING but what I have told you! You don't
&gt; know if I am really married, if I am really as old as I say I am, if I
&gt; am a man or a woman, you don't know where I live or what I do for a
&gt; living, unless and until I tell you something...and then how do you
&gt; know I am not lying??? After all to you I am already a liar. So maybe
&gt; everything you think is true about me is nothing but lies. Point is,
&gt; you don't know. You're prophets only in your own minds as well. As are
&gt; we all. But you stick with your boxed in minds and I'll stick with my
&gt; open one.

Bob,

His problem is, he thinks he is a god, a prophet, etc.  This shows he has a
problem with multiple personalities.  It has been getting worse over the
years, but it seems to have gotten worse in the past 3 months.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So Saint can you prove he talks to you? I asked another nutcase I meet

&gt;&gt;&gt; me I
&gt;&gt;&gt; havnt told him and he said God cant give signs. I guess thats what your
&gt;&gt;&gt; answer is going to be as well.

&gt;&gt; Hmm, seems to me Jesus said: You ask for signs and miracles and I tell
&gt;&gt; you none shall be given unto you...I guess he was just an asshole too.
&gt;&gt; But if you had read my post you would have heard me tell you three
&gt;&gt; things that God told me about you. One was you weren't hurt by Y2K,
&gt;&gt; the others were you wern't killed by a meteor in 2006 and the world
&gt;&gt; wasn't facing an apocalypse in 2001 so God didn't rapture you. Now
&gt;&gt; what you want is personal information. Like your what? Your atm pin
&gt;&gt; number? How about your social security number? Do you want me to tell
&gt;&gt; everyone when the last time you masturbated or picked your nose was?
&gt;&gt; Do you think God doesn't know these things? But you would like me to
&gt;&gt; tell everyone here on the NG secret and important things about
&gt;&gt; yourself so they can know you as well as God does! And then maybe
&gt;&gt; you'll believe I speak with God.

&gt;&gt; Get a grip, Seon. We have RULES about INFORMATION for a reason. If God
&gt;&gt; needed to get a message to you through me for something important I
&gt;&gt; would invite you to a PRIVATE conversation. I get important messages
&gt;&gt; for people all the time. I tell them PERSONALLY. Not publically. Now,
&gt;&gt; since you want to play this carnival game of &quot;Guess My Weight&quot; and
&gt;&gt; then you'll believe in my version of God or my abilities to speak with
&gt;&gt; God, then you are being a fool. And I don't care for fools. Psychic
&gt;&gt; abilities are not to be used as a game for NGs. If you don't believe I
&gt;&gt; have any, so what? All it really means is you haven't the nerve to
&gt;&gt; speak with me in private and to commune with God in faith, rather than
&gt;&gt; in skepticism. You already have no faith in me. Nor in God, Which is
&gt;&gt; why you are still searching, still researching. As I said, keep
&gt;&gt; researching. God knows the path you seek.

&gt;&gt; Be well.
