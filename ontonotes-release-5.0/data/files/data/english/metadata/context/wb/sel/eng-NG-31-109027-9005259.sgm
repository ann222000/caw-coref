Dear John ~

Regarding the matter of the parentage of Cecily Bardolf (died 1386),
wife of Sir William de Morley, Knt., 3rd Lord Morley, Marshal of
Ireland, there is good evidence which indicates that Cecily was a
member of the baronial Bardolf family.

For starters, the will of her husband, Sir William de Morley, dated 26
April 1379, proved 6 Feb. 1379/80, leaves a bequest to &quot;Sir Thomas
Morley, Knt. my son and heir... the plate belonging to Cecily, my wife,
marked with the arms of Bardolph.&quot;  [Reference: Nicolas, Testamenta
Vetusta 1 (1826): 104-105].

Sir William de Morley's will may be viewed at the following weblink:

http://books.google.com/books?id=7_wmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg;=RA1-PA105&amp;dq;=Cecily+...

There are also in existence two ancient embroideries which apparently
bear the Morley and Bardolf arms.  These embroideries are discussed in
the book, Women, Art and Patronage from Henry III to Edward III: 1216-
1377, by Loveday Gee (2002), pages 66-67as follows:

&quot;Another embroidery, the life of the Virgin apparels in the Victoria
and Albert Museum, has been identified from the heraldry as having
belonged to William, Lord Morley, and his wife, Cicely Bardolf.  The
same arms appear in the Escorial Psalter, which has an Austin Friars
calendar, where the female owner is shown on fol. 14v with her Austin
Friar confessor.  These two embroideries each represent the patronage,
identified by heraldry, of a husband and wife who shared the same
devotional aspirations and allegiance to a particular church or order
... the Austin Friars ... there is evidence of the wife's piety ... Cecily
Bardolf is shown as the donor of the Escorial Psalter.&quot;).

As for Cecily Bardolf's specific placement in the Bardolf family,
Complete Peerage, 9 (1936): 215 (sub Morley) identifies her as the
daughter of Thomas Bardolph [Lord Bardolph].   It states: &quot;Her
father's name is given by Dugdale, citing Glover.&quot;

Cecily herself left a will dated 20 Sept. 1386, proved 7 Feb. 1386/7.
An abstract of this will can be found in Nicolas, Testamenta Vetusta 1
(1826): 121, which may be viewed at the following weblink:

http://books.google.com/books?id=7_wmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg;=RA1-PA105&amp;dq;=Cecily+...

The only clue to Cecily's place in the Bardolf family provided by her
will is a bequest she makes to her sister, Dame Margaret Kerdeston.

In a footnote, the editor, Nicolas, identifies Cecily as the &quot;daughter
of Thomas Lord Bardolph.&quot;

Elsewhere, I find that Cecily is likewise identified as the &quot;daughter
of Thomas lord Bardolph&quot; in the account of the Morley family found in
Banks, The Dormant &amp; Extinct Baronage of England, 2 (1808): 356-358.

I assume that Nicolas and Banks are quoting either Glover or Dugdale
who identified Cecily's father as &quot;Thomas lord Bardolph,&quot; rather than
his cousin, Sir Thomas Bardolf, of Spixworth, Norfolk.  If so, then it
would seem that you have latched onto the wrong branch of the Bardolf
family.  As a general rule, people like Glover or Dugdale would be
careful to distinguish between Thomas Lord Bardolf (a baron) and his
cousin, Sir Thomas Bardolf (a mere knight).

As you have noted, Complete Peerage, 9 (1936): 215, footnote g (sub
Morley) states that &quot;as early as in 1327 and 1328&quot; Robert de Morley
(presumably Sir William de Morley's father) &quot;settled the reversion of
the manor of Roydon, &amp;c., on Cicely, da. of Thomas Bardolph.&quot;  It
cites as its source Feet of Fines, Norfolk, Edw. III, no. 37, which
document was evidently actually viewed.

However, you have upended the citation provided by Complete Peerage by
assuming that the fine was between two adults, which it need not be.
Instead, you have alleged the person receiving the reversion in
question was not Cecily, daughter of Thomas Bardolph, at all, but a
different woman, Cecily, widow of Sir Thomas Bardolf, of Spixworth.
Yet, this is not what Complete Peerage says.

Beyond this, I have nothing further to offer in the way of evidence of
Cecily Bardolf's parentage, except to note that there are apparently
deeds relating to the Morley family which are discussed in the
Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries, 2nd series, vol. 1, pg.
153, which I haven't yet seen.  Cecily Bardolf is also mentioned in
2nd ser., Vol. 1, pg. 153, and Thomas Bardolf, Lord Bardolf, of
Wormegay is mentioned in 2nd ser., Vol. 1, pg. 152-153.   I assume
these deeds involve Cecily Bardolf, wife of Sir William de Morley.  If
so, they may well provide contemporary evidence of her parentage.

On a final note, I should mention that Complete Peerage spells the
name &quot;Cicely&quot; in its account of the Morley family.  This name is the
female version of the man's name, Cecil.  As such, the correct
standardized modern form should be Cecily rather than Cicely.  I'm
well aware that you can find both Cecily and Cicely in the
contemporary records, but the more common form even back then was
Cecily.  I see that the historian Gee spells it both ways in the same
paragraph.  Now that's consistency!

Dear John ~

In a subsequent post, I note that you've presented a record which
states that in 1402 the unnamed heir of Thomas Bardolf of Spixworth,
Norfolk held 1 knight's fee in West Winch and South Lynne, Norfolk of
Thomas Morley, who in turn held these these properties of the king, it
being parcel of the barony of Rye.  You've theorized that the Morley
family's interest in West Winch and South Lynne came through the
marriage of Thomas Morley's mother, Cecily Bardolf.

However, the record itself makes that virtually impossible.  First, if
these estates were Cecily Bardolf's maritagium as you have suggested,
normally her son and heir would be holding her maritagium of her
family, not the other way around.  Second, the record states that
these properties were held by Thomas Morley direct of the king as
parcel of the barony of Rye.  If correct, then this can only mean that
the Morley family's interest in these properties arose not through
Thomas Morley's mother, Cecily Bardolf, but rather through Thomas
Morley's paternal grandmother, Hawise Marshal, who was the heiress of
the barony of Rye.

This in turn means that the Bardolf family of Spixworth were likely
tenants of Hawise Marshal's family before 1402.  If so, that would
explain the record you found in which Thomas Bardolf, of Spixworth,
Norfolk, served as a surety in 1279 for John le Marshal, which person
was Hawise (Marshal) Morley's paternal grandfather.  Thomas Bardolf
would have been one of the tenants of John le Marshal.

All in all, the evidence indicates that the properties at West Winch
and South Lynne can not have been the maritagium of Cecily Bardolf.

Best always, Douglas Richardson, Salt Lake City, Utah.

Thanks for your reply of yesterday.  My comments are interspersed

The will of 'Cecily de Morley, Lady of Aldeby' is likewise in
print, in the same volume you mention [Testamenta Vetusta I:121].  It
is unfortunate (but typical) that, beyond the reference to 'the arms
of Bardolph' in Sir William de Morley's will, neither made mention of
Cecily's parentage or landholdings (that is, an identifiable
maritagium).

I see no mention of Cecily's arms in the foreoing extract.  Was
there any such mention in a footnote or other part of the work you

find something identifiable as Cecily's arms, impaled or otherwise,
that would provide useful evidence, one way or the other.

To date, other than this 'sisterly' reference in Cecily's will, I
have seen nothing helpful in records relating directly to Margaret, or
the Kerdeston family.  I assume from the foregoing there is as yet no
direct evidence on the matter.

If your assumptions as to uncited evidence by either Glover
(possible) or Banks (less likely) are correct, your statement would be

are back to square one on the long-standing presumption of a
relationship between Cecily and the Lords Bardolf, no?

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

we are some 600+ years too late to chide Great-Grandmother Cicely (er,
Cecily) on the matter........

Dear Doug,

The landholdings in West Winch, Norfolk are complicated, hence my
suggestion that these 'may have been part of the maritagium of
Cecily'.  At the time of the Testa de Nevill, Ernald de Torley held a
half a knight's fee in 'Westweniz' of Simon fitz Richard fitz Simon,
which was of the fee of the 'Earl of Clare' [&quot;comitis de Clara&quot; -
Eller, Memorials of West Wimnch, p. 76].  Subsequently, as I noted in

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
my post, Eller wrote:
">

' At a very early period it belonged to the family of the
Bardolphs, of Spixworth, of whom it is stated by
Blomefield, vol. x., p. 417 and 454, that Thomas,
son of William Bardolph, on his purchase in the
52nd Henry III., A.D. 1268, of the Manor of
Frettenham of Robert le Poure, charged his Manors of
Spixworth and West Winch with an annuity to the said
Robert, of 20 marks per annum. In the succeeding
reign, he, with James de Beauvais, occurs in the
feodary books as holding one fee in West Winch, of
Richard Fitz-Simon, (see page 76.) .'
[Eller, Memorials of West Winch, pp. 117-1181]

By what process the lands of West Winch came later to be held of
Morley, of the barony of Rye, it not clear.  This presumes they were
in fact the same lands in West Winch.  It is however, not clear at
this point at all that the Morleys had any interest in West Winch
prior to the marriage of Cecily Bardolf and William de Morley - hence
my suggestion.

Cheers,

John

Dear John ~

If the Morley family held West Winch and Lynn direct of the king as
part of the honour of Rye, they surely did not get these properties
through the marriage of Sir William de Morley to Cecily Bardolf.
Rather, the Morley family would have received these properties as part
of the inheritance of Sir William de Morley's mother, Hawise Marshal,
who was the heiress of the honour (or barony) of Rye.  I'm sure that
if you check the history of the honour of Rye, you'ill find that these
properties were part of that honour long belong Cecily Bardolf's
time.

I believe if you check out Complete Peerage's reference to Dugdale,
you will find that Dugdale stated that Cacily Bardolf, wife of William
de Morley, was the daughter of Thomas, Lord Bardolf, as does his
source Glover.  These gentlemen would have been fully aware that when
they identified Cecily's father as &quot;Thomas Lord Bardolf,&quot; that they
were referring to Thomas Bardolf, 2nd Lord Bardolf, who died in 1328,
not some other person or a distant kinsman.  Since we have good
evidence that Cecily was in fact a Bardolf, and we also have a fine
which refers to her as the &quot;daughter of Thomas Bardolf,&quot; I think we
can be certain that Cecily was in fact the daughter of Thomas, 2nd
Lord Bardolf, just as Dugdale and Glover state.  I'm assuming for the
present that Dugdale and Glover refer to Cecily's father as &quot;Thomas
Lord Bardolph,&quot; not just &quot;Thomas Bardolph.&quot;  I'm sure one or the other
source can be easily checked by you as to the specific language.

If you're unsatisfied that Complete Peerage correctly translated the
fine involving Cecily, daughter of Thomas Bardolf, you might want to
view a copy of the fine in question and verify it for yourself.  I
personally have no doubt that Complete Peerage got it right.  That
would mean, of course, that your alleged alternative pedigree of
Cecily Bardolf would be disproven.   Perhaps Chris Phillips can track
down this fine for you.

All the same, unless you have evidence to show otherwise, I believe
the current evidence indicates that Cecily was the daughter of Thomas
Bardolf, 2nd Lord Bardolf, not the daughter of John Bardolf, of
Spixworth, Norfolk.

The arms of Cecily Bardolf and those of her husband are evidently
found on the two embroideries cited by Gee.  In fact, the historian
Gee specifically states that these two items were &quot;identified by
heraldry.&quot;  Heraldry usually means coats of arms.  And, unless the
colors have faded badly, the tinctures of Cecily Bardolf's arms should
be present on both pieces.  In any event, my guess is that the
tinctures and the arms of the Lords Bardolf would differ slightly from
the tinctures and the arms of the Bardolf family of Spixworth,
Norfolk.  If so, you might want to have an archivist give you a
description of the arms on the two embroideries.  If the arms on these
pieces match the known tinctures and arms of the Lords Bardolf, then
you would have good evidence that Cecily Bardolf was a daughter of a
contemporary Lord Bardolf.  If the tinctures and arms vary from those
of the Lords Bardolf, then you would have good evidence that Cecily
was not the daughter of a Lord Bardolf.

Gee indicates that the two embroideries are presently held by the
following museums/archives:

http://books.google.com/books?id=TWXq344tmPoC&amp;pg;=PA67&amp;dq;=Gee+Bardolf+...

1. Manuscript, Escorial Psalter, Escorial Library, Q.II.6

2. Embroidery, Life of the Virgin Apparels, Victoria and Albert Museum

By the way, I'm somewhat confused by Gee on this point, as in her main
text on page 67, she refers to two embroideries which involve Cecily
Bardolf.  Yet on page 142, she refers to one manuscript (the Escorial
Psalter) and one embroidery.  Be that as it may, you may be able to
find a description of the arms on the two embroideries in the
published sources which Gee has cited on page 142.

Actually no.  We have the fine in which Cecily is called the &quot;daughter
of Thomas Bardolf.&quot;   This fine completely upends the alternative
pedigree you have set forth for Cecily Bardolf.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Beyond this, I have nothing further to offer in the way of evidence of
&gt; &gt; Cecily Bardolf's parentage, except to note that there are apparently
&gt; &gt; deeds relating to the Morley family which are discussed in the
&gt; &gt; Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries, 2nd series, vol. 1, pg.
&gt; &gt; 153, which I haven't yet seen.  Cecily Bardolf is also mentioned in
&gt; &gt; 2nd ser., Vol. 1, pg. 153, and Thomas Bardolf, Lord Bardolf, of
&gt; &gt; Wormegay is mentioned in 2nd ser., Vol. 1, pg. 152-153.   I assume
&gt; &gt; these deeds involve Cecily Bardolf, wife of Sir William de Morley.  If
&gt; &gt; so, they may well provide contemporary evidence of her parentage.

I believe the citation above which I provided you should prove useful,
as it involves deeds of the Morley family and it refers to Cecily
Bardolf and Thomas, Lord Bardolf, of Wormegay.  Do you have access to

Dear Newsgroup ~

A pedigree of the Rye family which is ancestral to the Lords Morley
can be found in the following source:

The Norfolk Antiquarian Miscellany 3(1) (1885): 248-249

These pages may be viewed at the following weblink:

Aline de Rye, daughter and co-heiress of Hubert de Rye, married John
le Marshal (le Marescall).  Their lineal heir and descendant was
Hawise Marshal (died pre-1329), wife of Robert de Morley, Knt., 2nd
Lord Morley, Admiral of the Fleet north of Thames, Constable of the
Tower of London.

The surname derive from the Welsh surname Seisyll, Seisyllt - the etymology

Dear Newsgroup ~

As a followup to my last post, I find that Brault, Rolls of Arms
Edward I (1272-1307) 2 (1997): 29 shows that Hugh Bardolf, 1st Lord
Bardolf (died 1304) bore the following arms:

Azure three cinquefoils or.

He also shows that Hugh's son and heir, Thomas Bardolf (died 1328),
during his father's lifetime bore these arms:

Azure crusilly and three cinquefoils or.

After Thomas succeeded Hugh, he omitted the crosslets.  His arms then
would have been Azure three cinquefoils or.

Thus, the arms of the Lords Bardolf in this time period were Azure
three cinquefoils or.

Brault, Rolls of Arms Edward I (1272-1307) 2 (1997): 29 also provides
the arms of John Bardolf, of Spixworth, Norfolk, who John Ravilious
has advanced as the father of Cecily (Bardolf) Morley.  They are:

Gules, three cinquefoils argent.

We see that while the charges [three cinquefoils] are the same, the
tinctures are different between the two branches of the Bardolf
family.  Thus, it should be relatively easy to determine if Cecily
(Bardolf) Morley was the daughter of Thomas Bardolf, Lord Bardolf, or
John bardolf, of Spixworth, simply by viewing the arms on either of
the two embroideries connected to Cecily (Bardolf) Morley.  If
Cecily's arms are blue and gold, then she was the daughter of a Lord
Bardolf.  And, if her arms are red and silver, then she is a daughter
of a Bardolf of Spixworth.

The locations of the two embroideries are known.  Both of them have
also been discussed in print.  This is certainly an interesting use of
heraldry to prove a genealogical point.

Dear Doug, Rosie, Todd, Will, et al.,

I have had the opportunity to read the article you mentioned by
L. F. Sandler on the Escorial Psalter, and have found it very
illuminating.

I am providing below a quote from the text which has direct
bearing on the Bardolf issue [1].  What I find particularly
interesting is that having read this article, Gee had unfortunately
leapt to the conclusion that the psalter's Bardolf patron (evidently
of the Wormegay family) was Cecily Bardolf.  There is no support for
this in the text: in fact, the inference drawn by Sandler herself is,

' Indeed, the repeated juxtaposition of the arms of the Bardolfs
and the Busseys may itself refer to a marriage and this occasion may
have inspired the production of the Escorial Psalter.  If so, the left-
hand or Bardolf shield would refer to the male partner; and the right-
hand Bussey shield to the female.' [2]

If this is correct, there may be an identifiable marriage of a
male Bardolf to a lady of the Bussey family.  If so, this would likely
mean the marriage of a younger son, as (except for the 'foreign-born'
Agnes usually called Agnes de Grandison) the 13th and 14th century
wives of the Lords Bardolf are identified.

You can electronically 'validate' the foregoing via Google.  If
you query &quot;Escorial Psalter Bardolf&quot;, among other items you will bring
up a link to the Sandler article (via JSTOR).  If you attempt another
potentially useful query, such as &quot;Escorial Psalter Cecily Bardolf&quot;,
&quot;Escorial Psalter Cicely Bardolf&quot; or even &quot;Escorial Psalter Bardolf
Morley&quot; the JSTOR reference will not appear, for a very good reason:
Sandler makes no mention anywhere in the article to any specific
Bardolf other than Margaret, whom Sandler identifies (incorrectly by a
generation, I think) as a daughter of John, Lord Bardolf (p. 71, note
&lt;24&gt;).

Beyond the fact that Cecily Bardolf and the Lords Morley have
nothing to do with the Escorial Psalter, there is another interesting
Bardolf identification that can be made (or better, inferred).  The
association of the Wells and Bardolf arms appear to point to Margaret
Bardolf, wife of Adam de Welles as being of the Wormegay family [see
p. 71, and esp. note &lt;24&gt;].  This tends to solidify my earlier
contention re: Cecily (Bardolf) de Morley, as her sister Margaret or
Margery (wife of Kerdeston) could then be identified with the
Spixworth family, and not readily with the Bardolfs of Wormegay.

If access to a very good copy (or excellent description) of the
apparel in the V&amp;A in London can be obtained, that would hopefully
resolve the question as to Cecily (Bardolf) de Morley's parentage.

Cheers,

John

NOTES

[1] Lucy Freeman Sandler, An Early Fourteenth-Century English Psalter
in the Escorial (Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes,
1979), 42:65-80.  The following is from pages 70-71:

' Five coats-of-arms fill the side and bottom margins of the
Beatus page of the psalter(Pl. 29a).  Incorporated into the border,
they are part of the original design and appear to have been painted
by the original artist in colours which have not been retouched
although they have oxidized so badly that they are difficult to
blazon.  Across the bottom of the page are azure three cinquefoils or
- Bardolf; and barry of ten argent and sable - most probably Bussey.
Along the right-hand margin are three more shields, from top to
bottom, azure semy fleurs de lis a lion rampant guardant argent  -
Holland; or a lion crowned rampant sable - Wells; as well as argent
floretty a lion crowned rampant sable - probably Buckminster.  The
Bardolf and Bussey arms are repeated on all the bordered pages marking
the liturgical divisions of the psalter, but by a later hand; the
Bardolf arms alone recur on the garment of a kneeling woman in the
Crucifixion at the end of the Office of the Cross (Pl. 29c).
The families identified with these coats-of-arms all held lands
in Lincolnshire during the fourteenth century.  The Bardolfs and the
Busseys had adjoining manors in Kesteven close to the Nottinghamshire
border.  Other Bussey holdings in Kesteven were near those of the
Buckminster family.  In Holland - the eastern part of the county - the
Holland and the Wells holdings were adjacent, and indeed passed in
part from one family to the other.  Moreover, the Bardolf and the
Wells were related by marriage &lt;24&gt;.  Indeed, the repeated
juxtaposition of the arms of the Bardolfs and the Busseys may itself
refer to a marriage and this occasion may have inspired the production
of the Escorial Psalter.  If so, the left-hand or Bardolf shield would
refer to the male partner; and the right-hand Bussey shield to the
female.
The lady, now presumably wearing her Bardolf husband's arms, is
shown in the miniature at the end of the Office of the Cross (Pl.
29c).  She kneels in prayer to the left of the crucified Christ.  On
the right is a kneeling cleric, an Austin Friar, wearing the black
habit and white tunic of the order.  The Bardolfs are not recorded as
patrons or any Austin Friars house, nor are the other families
represented by the coats-of-arms in the book, at least not up to the
middle of the fourteenth century.  It seems likely therefore that the
Bardolf woman shown in the picture was the owner of the Escorial
Psalter; that the Austin Friar shown with her was her confessor or
chaplain; and that as her spiritual adviser he was responsible for the
introduction into her prayer book of the liturgical features of the
Austin Friars. '

&gt; &gt; Dear Doug,

&gt; &gt;      Thanks for your reply of yesterday.

&gt; &gt;      Actually, that Cecily was of _a_ Bardolf family I think is
&gt; &gt; certain.  The longstanding presumption, and statements to the effect,
&gt; &gt; that she was of 'the baronial Bardolf family' appear to be only that.

&gt; I believe if you check out Complete Peerage's reference to Dugdale,
&gt; you will find that Dugdale stated that Cacily Bardolf, wife of William
&gt; de Morley, was the daughter of Thomas, Lord Bardolf, as does his
&gt; source Glover.  These gentlemen would have been fully aware that when
&gt; they identified Cecily's father as &quot;Thomas Lord Bardolf,&quot; that they
&gt; were referring to Thomas Bardolf, 2nd Lord Bardolf, who died in 1328,
&gt; not some other person or a distant kinsman.  Since we have good
&gt; evidence that Cecily was in fact a Bardolf, and we also have a fine
&gt; which refers to her as the &quot;daughter of Thomas Bardolf,&quot; I think we
&gt; can be certain that Cecily was in fact the daughter of Thomas, 2nd
&gt; Lord Bardolf, just as Dugdale and Glover state.  I'm assuming for the
&gt; present that Dugdale and Glover refer to Cecily's father as &quot;Thomas
&gt; Lord Bardolph,&quot; not just &quot;Thomas Bardolph.&quot;  I'm sure one or the other
&gt; source can be easily checked by you as to the specific language.

&gt; If you're unsatisfied that Complete Peerage correctly translated the
&gt; fine involving Cecily, daughter of Thomas Bardolf, you might want to
&gt; view a copy of the fine in question and verify it for yourself.  I
&gt; personally have no doubt that Complete Peerage got it right.  That
&gt; would mean, of course, that your alleged alternative pedigree of
&gt; Cecily Bardolf would be disproven.   Perhaps Chris Phillips can track
&gt; down this fine for you.

&gt; All the same, unless you have evidence to show otherwise, I believe
&gt; the current evidence indicates that Cecily was the daughter of Thomas
&gt; Bardolf, 2nd Lord Bardolf, not the daughter of John Bardolf, of
&gt; Spixworth, Norfolk.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There are also in existence two ancient embroideries which apparently
&gt; &gt; &gt; bear the Morley and Bardolf arms.  These embroideries are discussed in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the book, Women, Art and Patronage from Henry III to Edward III: 1216-
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1377, by Loveday Gee (2002), pages 66-67as follows:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Another embroidery, the life of the Virgin apparels in the Victoria
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Albert Museum, has been identified from the heraldry as having
&gt; &gt; &gt; belonged to William, Lord Morley, and his wife, Cicely Bardolf.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; same arms appear in the Escorial Psalter, which has an Austin Friars
&gt; &gt; &gt; calendar, where the female owner is shown on fol. 14v with her Austin
&gt; &gt; &gt; Friar confessor.  These two embroideries each represent the patronage,
&gt; &gt; &gt; identified by heraldry, of a husband and wife who shared the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; devotional aspirations and allegiance to a particular church or order
&gt; &gt; &gt; ... the Austin Friars ... there is evidence of the wife's piety ... Cecily
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bardolf is shown as the donor of the Escorial Psalter.&quot;).

&gt; &gt;      I see no mention of Cecily's arms in the foreoing extract.  Was
&gt; &gt; there any such mention in a footnote or other part of the work you
&gt; &gt; cite?  The tinctures of the arms of Lord Bardolf are known; should we
&gt; &gt; find something identifiable as Cecily's arms, impaled or otherwise,
&gt; &gt; that would provide useful evidence, one way or the other.

&gt; The arms of Cecily Bardolf and those of her husband are evidently
&gt; found on the two embroideries cited by Gee.  In fact, the historian
&gt; Gee specifically states that these two items were &quot;identified by
&gt; heraldry.&quot;  Heraldry usually means coats of arms.  And, unless the
&gt; colors have faded badly, the tinctures of Cecily Bardolf's arms should
&gt; be present on both pieces.  In any event, my guess is that the
&gt; tinctures and the arms of the Lords Bardolf would differ slightly from
&gt; the tinctures and the arms of the Bardolf family of Spixworth,
&gt; Norfolk.  If so, you might want to have an archivist give you a
&gt; description of the arms on the two embroideries.  If the arms on these
&gt; pieces match the known tinctures and arms of the Lords Bardolf, then
&gt; you would have good evidence that Cecily Bardolf was a daughter of a
&gt; contemporary Lord

That is because of its alleged derivation from the Welsh Seisyll, Seisyllt.
But it could also be from the diminutives of Cecilia: Cesse, Cissot, Sissot,

&gt; 1979), 42:65-80.  The following is from pages 70-71:

&gt;     ' Five coats-of-arms fill the side and bottom margins of the
&gt; Beatus page of the psalter(Pl. 29a).  Incorporated into the border,
&gt; they are part of the original design and appear to have been painted
&gt; by the original artist in colours which have not been retouched
&gt; although they have oxidized so badly that they are difficult to
&gt; blazon.  Across the bottom of the page are azure three cinquefoils or
&gt; - Bardolf; and barry of ten argent and sable - most probably Bussey.
&gt; Along the right-hand margin are three more shields, from top to
&gt; bottom, azure semy fleurs de lis a lion rampant guardant argent  -
&gt; Holland; or a lion crowned rampant sable - Wells; as well as argent
&gt; floretty a lion crowned rampant sable - probably Buckminster.  The
&gt; Bardolf and Bussey arms are repeated on all the bordered pages marking
&gt; the liturgical divisions of the psalter, but by a later hand; the
&gt; Bardolf arms alone recur on the garment of a kneeling woman in the
&gt; Crucifixion at the end of the Office of the Cross (Pl. 29c).
&gt;       The families identified with these coats-of-arms all held lands
&gt; in Lincolnshire during the fourteenth century.  The Bardolfs and the
&gt; Busseys had adjoining manors in Kesteven close to the Nottinghamshire
&gt; border.  Other Bussey holdings in Kesteven were near those of the
&gt; Buckminster family.  In Holland - the eastern part of the county - the
&gt; Holland and the Wells holdings were adjacent, and indeed passed in
&gt; part from one family to the other.  Moreover, the Bardolf and the
&gt; Wells were related by marriage &lt;24&gt;.  Indeed, the repeated
&gt; juxtaposition of the arms of the Bardolfs and the Busseys may itself
&gt; refer to a marriage and this occasion may have inspired the production
&gt; of the Escorial Psalter.  If so, the left-hand or Bardolf shield would
&gt; refer to the male partner; and the right-hand Bussey shield to the
&gt; female.
&gt;       The lady, now presumably wearing her Bardolf husband's arms, is
&gt; shown in the miniature at the end of the Office of the Cross (Pl.
&gt; 29c).  She kneels in prayer to the left of the crucified Christ.  On
&gt; the right is a kneeling cleric, an Austin Friar, wearing the black
&gt; habit and white tunic of the order.  The Bardolfs are not recorded as
&gt; patrons or any Austin Friars house, nor are the other families
&gt; represented by the coats-of-arms in the book, at least not up to the
&gt; middle of the fourteenth century.  It seems likely therefore that the
&gt; Bardolf woman shown in the picture was the owner of the Escorial
&gt; Psalter; that the Austin Friar shown with her was her confessor or
&gt; chaplain; and that as her spiritual adviser he was responsible for the
&gt; introduction into her prayer book of the liturgical features of the
&gt; Austin Friars. '

&gt; &gt; &gt; certain.  The longstanding presumption, and statements to the effect,
&gt; &gt; &gt; that she was of 'the baronial Bardolf family' appear to be only that.

&gt; &gt; I believe if you check out Complete Peerage's reference to Dugdale,
&gt; &gt; you will find that Dugdale stated that Cacily Bardolf, wife of William
&gt; &gt; de Morley, was the daughter of Thomas, Lord Bardolf, as does his
&gt; &gt; source Glover.  These gentlemen would have been fully aware that when
&gt; &gt; they identified Cecily's father as &quot;Thomas Lord Bardolf,&quot; that they
&gt; &gt; were referring to Thomas Bardolf, 2nd Lord Bardolf, who died in 1328,
&gt; &gt; not some other person or a distant kinsman.  Since we have good
&gt; &gt; evidence that Cecily was in fact a Bardolf, and we also have a fine
&gt; &gt; which refers to her as the &quot;daughter of Thomas Bardolf,&quot; I think we
&gt; &gt; can be certain that Cecily was in fact the daughter of Thomas, 2nd
&gt; &gt; Lord Bardolf, just as Dugdale and Glover state.  I'm assuming for the
&gt; &gt; present that Dugdale and Glover refer to Cecily's father as &quot;Thomas
&gt; &gt; Lord Bardolph,&quot; not just &quot;Thomas Bardolph.&quot;  I'm sure one or the other
&gt; &gt; source can be easily checked by you as to the specific language.

&gt; &gt; If you're unsatisfied that Complete Peerage correctly translated the
&gt; &gt; fine involving Cecily, daughter of Thomas Bardolf, you might want to
&gt; &gt; view a copy of the fine in question and verify it for yourself.  I
&gt; &gt; personally have no doubt that Complete Peerage got it right.  That
&gt; &gt; would mean, of course, that your alleged alternative pedigree of
&gt; &gt; Cecily Bardolf would be disproven.   Perhaps Chris Phillips can track
&gt; &gt; down this fine for you.

&gt; &gt; All the same, unless you have evidence to show otherwise, I believe
&gt; &gt; the current evidence indicates that Cecily was the daughter of Thomas
&gt; &gt; Bardolf, 2nd Lord Bardolf, not the daughter of John Bardolf, of
&gt; &gt; Spixworth, Norfolk.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are also in existence two ancient embroideries which apparently
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear the Morley and Bardolf arms.  These embroideries are discussed in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the book, Women, Art and Patronage from Henry III to Edward III: 1216-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1377, by Loveday Gee (2002), pages 66-67as follows:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Another embroidery, the life of the Virgin apparels in the Victoria
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Albert Museum, has been identified from the heraldry as having
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; belonged to William, Lord Morley, and his wife, Cicely Bardolf.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same arms appear in the Escorial Psalter, which has an Austin Friars
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calendar, where the female owner is shown on fol. 14v with her Austin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Friar confessor.  These two embroideries each represent the patronage,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identified by heraldry, of a husband and wife who shared the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devotional aspirations and allegiance to a particular church or order
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ... the Austin Friars ... there is evidence of the wife's piety ... Cecily
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bardolf is shown as the donor of the Escorial Psalter.&quot;).

&gt; &gt; &gt;      I see no mention of Cecily's arms in the foreoing extract.  Was
&gt; &gt; &gt; there any such mention in a footnote or other part of the work you
&gt; &gt; &gt; cite?  The tinctures of the arms of Lord Bardolf are known; should we
&gt; &gt; &gt; find something identifiable as Cecily's arms, impaled or otherwise,
&gt; &gt; &gt; that would provide useful evidence, one way or the other.

&gt; &gt; The arms of Cecily Bardolf and those of her husband are evidently
&gt; &gt; found on the two embroideries cited by Gee.  In fact, the historian
&gt; &gt; Gee specifically states that these two items were &quot;identified by
&gt; &gt; heraldry.&quot;  Heraldry usually means coats of arms.  And, unless the
&gt; &gt; colors have faded badly, the tinctures of Cecily Bardolf's arms should
&gt; &gt; be present on both pieces.  In any event, my guess is that the
&gt; &gt; tinctures and the arms of the Lords Bardolf would differ slightly from

Dear John ~

Thank you for your good post.  Much appreciated.

The article by Sandler you checked is a bit of a disappointment.
Instead of verifying that the Escorial psalter was owned by Cecily
(Bardolf) Morley as implied by the historian Gee, Sandler's comments
indicate that the psalter had nothing to do with Cecily (Bardolf)
Morley at all.  Ugh!!

Reading Gee's comments again, I understand now what she is actually
saying.  On page 67, she refers to an embroidery entitled &quot;Life of the
Virgin Apparels&quot; in the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Gee states that
the embroidery &quot;has been identified from the heraldry as having
belonged to William, Lord Morley, and his wife, Cecily Bardolf.&quot;  So
far, so good.  She then says that &quot;the same arms appear in the
Escorial Psalter.&quot;

I initially took this to mean that the Bardolf AND Morley arms were
both found on the embroidery and in the psalter.  Gee certainly
associates both pieces with Cecily (Bardolf) Morley on page 142.
However, Gee is evidently referring only to the Bardolf arms being
found with both pieces.  Regardless, if she is correct, then this
means that Cecily (Bardolf) Morley would have to have been a daughter
of Lord Bardolf, as Sandler describes the arms on the Escorial psalter
as being  &quot;Azure three cinquefoils or.&quot;   Brault indicates that these
arms belonged to the Lords Bardolf, but not to the Bardolf family of
Spixworth, Norfolk.

Gee indicates that the Life of the Virgin Apparels embroidery
associated with Cecily (Bardolf) Morley has been discussed in a Ph.D.
dissertation, as well as in Michael, 1990, pg. 61, 104 note 44, and in
Williamson, 1986, pp. 204-205.   Thus the arms found on the embroidery
should be described somewhere in print.

I believe the first reference to Michael, 1900, is to an article by
M.A. Michael entitled &quot;Destruction, Reconstruction, and Invention&quot;
which was published in the book, English Manuscript Studies 1100-1700,
edited by Peter Beal &amp; Jeremy Griffiths, volume 2 (1990), pp. 32-107,
which source I haven't seen.  The second reference to Williamson,
1986, appears to be to Paul Williamson, The Medieval Treasury: The Art
of the Middle Ages in the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1986.  I also
haven't seen this source.  Neither work appears to be available at our
local university library, nor is either work available in Google Book
Search as best I can tell.

As for as Sandler's comments about the various arms found with the
Escorial Psalter, she is probably correct in assuming that the arms
she describes for the Bardolf family are for that family.  However,
slips off the beam at that point.  She says the next arms, barry of
ten argent and sable, are &quot;most probably Bussey.&quot;  However, these arms
belong to more than one family.  She identifies the next set of arms,
azure semy fleurs de lis a lion rampant guardant argent, as being for
Holland.  She is correct about the arms, but the family name was
Holand, not Holland.  The third set of arms, or a lion crowned rampant
sable, could be for various families.  But I seriously doubt it is for
Welles, as it is lacking the double forked tail and the Welles lion is
not crowned.  The Welles arms are correctly described as: &quot;Or, a lion
rampant double queued sable, langued, etc., gules.&quot;  So your idea that
the Escorial Psalter provides support for the Bardolf identification
of Margaret, wife of Adam de Welle(s), comes crashing to the ground.
As far as I know, there is NO evidence whatsoever to indicate the
parentage or family of Lady Welles, in spite of Complete Peerage's
comments.  I'm not familiar with the the last set of arms, argent
floretty a lion crowned rampant sable, which Sandler thinks is
Buckminster.

So it would appear that some more investigation work needs to be done
on the remaining embroidery.  If the arms on the embroidery are found
to be those of Morley and those of the Lords Bardolf, then it would
seem certain that Cecily Bardolf, wife of William de Morley, was a
daughter of Lord Bardolf.

Thank you again for checking the Sandler article.

Dear Newsgroup ~

I do want to take the historian Loveday Lewes Gee partly off the hook
for associating the Escorial psalter with Cecily Bardolf, wife of Sir
William de Morley.  Before Gee's book was published, I find that the
historian, Michael Camille, in his book, Mirror in Parchment: The
Luttrell Psalter and the Making of Medieval England (1998), page 326,
made a similar identification as follows:

&quot;The decorator ... also illuminated a psalter for another Lincolnshire
client, Cecily Bardolf, who presented it to the Austin friars' house
at Norwich (Escorial Library, MS Q.II.6.&quot;

On Page 392, Camille cites as his sources the following two works:

Sandler &quot;An Early Fourteenth-Century English Psalter in the Escorial,&quot;
Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 48 (1979): 65-80;
Sandler, Gothic Manuscripts 1285-1385, A Survey of Manuscripts
Illuminated in the British Isles II: Catalogue, no. 80.

I have not seen the latter source, but John Ravilious' comments
regarding the former source do not suggest that Sandler associated the
psalter with Cecily Bardolf at all, only with the Bardolf family.

On page 392, after citing his sources, Camille inserts the word
&quot;although&quot; and the rest of his comments are found on page 393 which
I'm unable to see on Google Book Search.  Hopefully Camille modified
his statement about Cecily Bardolf and the Escorial psalter on page
393.

Dear Mr. Michael,

Many thanks for your post yesterday.  In fact, the muddying of
the waters was due to the fragmented text in the printed Feet of
Fines.  I am sending a copy of my next post to you, in which solid
evidence is presented that Cecily Bardolf was in fact a daughter of
Thomas, Lord Bardolf (of Wormegay) and not of the cadet family I had
theorized.

This does have some import as regards the Escorial Psalter and
the arms portrayed.  There is some discussion by W. S. Walford (1860)
concerning the Morley arms on two deeds (1335 and 1363) which may well
bear on interpreting the Psalter and the accuracy of the arms as
shown.  I will send this on either later today or tomorrow, as soon as
time allows.

Cheers,

John

&gt; &gt; Dear Doug, Rosie, Todd, Will, et al.,

&gt; &gt;      I have had the opportunity to read the article you mentioned by
&gt; &gt; L. F. Sandler on the Escorial Psalter, and have found it very
&gt; &gt; illuminating.

&gt; &gt;      I am providing below a quote from the text which has direct
&gt; &gt; bearing on the Bardolf issue [1].  What I find particularly
&gt; &gt; interesting is that having read this article, Gee had unfortunately
&gt; &gt; leapt to the conclusion that the psalter's Bardolf patron (evidently
&gt; &gt; of the Wormegay family) was Cecily Bardolf.  There is no support for
&gt; &gt; this in the text: in fact, the inference drawn by Sandler herself is,

&gt; &gt;      ' Indeed, the repeated juxtaposition of the arms of the Bardolfs
&gt; &gt; and the Busseys may itself refer to a marriage and this occasion may
&gt; &gt; have inspired the production of the Escorial Psalter.  If so, the left-
&gt; &gt; hand or Bardolf shield would refer to the male partner; and the right-
&gt; &gt; hand Bussey shield to the female.' [2]

&gt; &gt;      If this is correct, there may be an identifiable marriage of a
&gt; &gt; male Bardolf to a lady of the Bussey family.  If so, this would likely
&gt; &gt; mean the marriage of a younger son, as (except for the 'foreign-born'
&gt; &gt; Agnes usually called Agnes de Grandison) the 13th and 14th century
&gt; &gt; wives of the Lords Bardolf are identified.

&gt; &gt;      You can electronically 'validate' the foregoing via Google.  If
&gt; &gt; you query &quot;Escorial Psalter Bardolf&quot;, among other items you will bring
&gt; &gt; up a link to the Sandler article (via JSTOR).  If you attempt another
&gt; &gt; potentially useful query, such as &quot;Escorial Psalter Cecily Bardolf&quot;,
&gt; &gt; &quot;Escorial Psalter Cicely Bardolf&quot; or even &quot;Escorial Psalter Bardolf
&gt; &gt; Morley&quot; the JSTOR reference will not appear, for a very good reason:
&gt; &gt; Sandler makes no mention anywhere in the article to any specific
&gt; &gt; Bardolf other than Margaret, whom Sandler identifies (incorrectly by a
&gt; &gt; generation, I think) as a daughter of John, Lord Bardolf (p. 71, note
&gt; &gt; &lt;24&gt;).

&gt; &gt;      Beyond the fact that Cecily Bardolf and the Lords Morley have
&gt; &gt; nothing to do with the Escorial Psalter, there is another interesting
&gt; &gt; Bardolf identification that can be made (or better, inferred).  The
&gt; &gt; association of the Wells and Bardolf arms appear to point to Margaret
&gt; &gt; Bardolf, wife of Adam de Welles as being of the Wormegay family [see
&gt; &gt; p. 71, and esp. note &lt;24&gt;].  This tends to solidify my earlier
&gt; &gt; contention re: Cecily (Bardolf) de Morley, as her sister Margaret or
&gt; &gt; Margery (wife of Kerdeston) could then be identified with the
&gt; &gt; Spixworth family, and not readily with the Bardolfs of Wormegay.

&gt; &gt;      If access to a very good copy (or excellent description) of the
&gt; &gt; apparel in the V&amp;A in London can be obtained, that would hopefully
&gt; &gt; resolve the question as to Cecily (Bardolf) de Morley's parentage.

&gt; &gt;      Cheers,

&gt; &gt;                               John

Dear Doug, Rosie, Todd, Will, John, et al.,

In the course of pursuing the facts of Cecily Bardolf's
ancestry, I had planned to obtain what might be available
concerning the textiles at the V&amp;A.  I have meanwhile found
the necessary documentation (short of having a charter in
hand) to substantiate that Cecily Bardolf was the daughter
of Thomas Bardolf, Lord Bardolf (d. 1328).

The following is taken from observations made by W. S.
Walford, Esq., F.S.A. concerning a group of 14th century
deeds provided to the Society of Antiquaries of London by
J. J. Howard, Esq., F.S.A. in May 1860:

&quot;  The first deed, which is in French, and dated
at Wormegay on Monday the Feast of the Conception
of our Lady, 20 Edw. II. (8 Dec. 1326), in an
agreement between Monsire Thomas Bardolf, Lord of
Wormegay, and Monsire Robert de Morlee, Marshal
of Ireland, for the marriage of William de Morlee,
son of the latter, with Cecilia, daughter of the
former.  Robert de Morlee covenanted to enfeoff
his intended daughter-in-law of lands to the
value of 100l. (i.e. per annum, it is presumed);
and Thomas Bardolf undertook to find William
and Cecilia with board and clothing at his own
hostel until William should be twenty years of
age, if Thomas Bardolf should so long live.
Immediately after his decease William and
Cecilia were to have the 100l. in land, though
Robert de Morlee might be still living.  In
some event not clearly stated (probably owing
to the accidental omission of a few words),
and also after the death of her intended
husband, Cecilia was to have the 100l. in
land during her life for her maintenance.  In
case William should be made a knight, or wish
to enter the profession of arms (ou voille
aler entre les gentz au fait darmes) before
he was twenty years of age, Thomas Bardolf
was not to be bound to furnish him with
anything out of his own hostel.  For such
marriage and feoffment Thomas Bardolf agreed
to pay Robert Morlee 666l. 13s. 4d., in five
years, by equal portions; and if Cecilia
happened to die before the whole was paid,
he was not to pay any more after her death.
A formal instrument was to be prepared,
under the advice of the counsel of both
parties.
The two seals are unfortunately missing:
they were appended each by a slip cut
partially from the bottom of the
parchment.&quot; [1]

This serves I think to firmly establish Cecily's
parentage, at least with regard to her father (the
Grandison controversy will I think continue),and also
serves to place Margaret (Bardolf) Kerdeston
in the correct (Wormegay) family.

Should anyone wish to have the entirety of the
French text of the agreement (a portion of which
is given below), I will be happy to provide it.

Cheers,

John *

&gt; Dear Newsgroup ~

&gt; I do want to take the historian Loveday Lewes Gee partly off the hook
&gt; for associating the Escorial psalter with Cecily Bardolf, wife of Sir
&gt; William de Morley.  Before Gee's book was published, I find that the
&gt; historian, Michael Camille, in his book, Mirror in Parchment: The
&gt; Luttrell Psalter and the Making of Medieval England (1998), page 326,
&gt; made a similar identification as follows:

&gt; &quot;The decorator ... also illuminated a psalter for another Lincolnshire
&gt; client, Cecily Bardolf, who presented it to the Austin friars' house
&gt; at Norwich (Escorial Library, MS Q.II.6.&quot;

&gt; On Page 392, Camille cites as his sources the following two works:

&gt; Sandler &quot;An Early Fourteenth-Century English Psalter in the Escorial,&quot;
&gt; Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 48 (1979): 65-80;
&gt; Sandler, Gothic Manuscripts 1285-1385, A Survey of Manuscripts
&gt; Illuminated in the British Isles II: Catalogue, no. 80.

&gt; I have not seen the latter source, but John Ravilious' comments
&gt; regarding the former source do not suggest that Sandler associated the
&gt; psalter with Cecily Bardolf at all, only with the Bardolf family.

&gt; On page 392, after citing his sources, Camille inserts the word
&gt; &quot;although&quot; and the rest of his comments are found on page 393 which
&gt; I'm unable to see on Google Book Search.  Hopefully Camille modified
&gt; his statement about Cecily Bardolf and the Escorial psalter on page
&gt; 393.

Dear Dr. Michael ~

Thank you for your good post.  Much appreciated.

In your post, you left it unclear if just the Bardolf arms are found
on the embroidery in the Victoria and Albert Museum, or both Bardolf
AND Morley.  Can you please be more explicit about that point?  Or,
perhaps I should ask a different question: Exactly what arms are
displayed on the embroidery?

Regarding the parentage of Cecily Bardolf, wife of Sir William de
Morley, 3rd Lord Morley, Marshal of Ireland, the evidence is excellent
that she is the daughter of Thomas Bardolf, Knt., 2nd Lord Bardolf,
whose principal seat was at Wormegay, Norfolk.

As for the identification of the barry arms, I suspect that when
further research is done that you might find that these are the arms
of Cecily's second husband, or possibly of her mother or even a son-in-
law.  Cecily Bardolf was a widow for the last six years of her life.
She could easily have contracted a second marriage, even though she
left a will in which she called herself Cecily Lady Morley.  What name
a woman used in her will in the medieval period does not necessarily
reflect the name, number, or order of her marriages.

I have one other thought.  If the Morley arms are not associated with
either the embroidery or the psalter, perhaps I should ask you if
these items might have been instead created for Cecily Bardolf's
mother, Agnes.  Agnes was a Bardolf widow between 1328 and 1357.  Her
lifetime overlapped that of her daughter, Cecily.  Agnes could easily
have remarried to a man who had the barry arms.  Or, the barry arms
could be her own arms.  Agnes's family name has never been proven.
All we know for certain is that Agnes was a native of Germany.

As far as it goes, I usually associate barry with the baronial Grey
family.  However, other families bore these arms.   Probably the best
place to check for the barry arms in question is Gerald Brault's book,
Rolls of Arms Edward I (1272-1304).  Perhaps you have already checked
Brault.

As I stated yesterday, I strongly doubt the arms of the Welles family
occur with Escorial Psalter, as alleged by Lucy Sandler.  Sandler
described this set of arms as follows:  Or a lion crowned rampant
sable.  Since we are dealing with a crowned lion rampant, I can't help
but wonder if these are not the Morley arms which are supposed to be:

Argent a lion rampant sable crowned or [Reference: Moor, Knights of
Edward I, volume 3, pg. :202].

The color of the field is different, bit otherwise everything else is
the same.  In contrast, the lion on the standard Welles coat of arms
is not crowned.  The Welles lion also has a distinctive double forked
tail.

Once again, thank you for sharing your thoughts with the newsgroup.

&lt; Dear John et al
&lt; I stumbled on your conversation and fear I may have caused the
problem
&lt; through my re-interpretation of the armorials in my article in
Eglish
&lt; Manuscripts Sudies, vol 2, 1990 pp.33-108 at note 44.  I quote it
here
&lt; to save everyone trouble - but I may of coure be wrong in my
&lt; interpretation:
&lt;
&lt; 'Athough it has been suggested that the Escorial Psalter may have
been
&lt; made for a marriage between the Bussey family and the Bardolfs
&lt; (Sandler, 'An early fourteenth-century English Psalter', pp. 65-8),
a
&lt; very good case can be made for associating the shields, which are
&lt; paired at the bottom of the page at each Psalter division, with the
&lt; patronage of Cecily Bardolf and Robert de Morley of the Austin
Friars
&lt; of Norwich. Cecily is depicted kneeling before the Cross with a
friar
&lt; (fol. 14). She wears a surcoat of her arms (Azure three cinquefoils
&lt; or) and he a black habit. The unidentified shield which is paired
with
&lt; hers at the Psalter divisions (a Barry of ten argent and sable),
may,
&lt; therefore, refer to the Austin Friars' House which was the subject
of
&lt; her patronage (almost certainly Norwich). The same pairing of
shields
&lt; occurs on a fragment of Opus Anglicanum (Victoria and Albert Museum
&lt; 8218-1863; see Opus Anglicanum, English Medieval Embroidery,
&lt; exhibition held at the Victoria and Albert Museum (London, 1963),
no.
&lt; 73; (the black thread has largely been worn away to give the false
&lt; impression of bars of red). The will of Robert de Morley states that
&lt; such gifts were given to the Austin Friars of Norwich and he and
&lt; Cecily were both buried there (see The Complete Peerage, vol. 9
&lt; (London, 1945), p. 215 n. m). The Escorial Psalter itself has a
&lt; colophon in the original hand of the text which suggests it was made
&lt; for an Austin Friars' house. Although the exact place has been
erased,
&lt; this may have been Norwich. The arms which appear in the margins of
&lt; the 'Beatus' page may refer to him rather than the Barry of ten.
&lt; Robert was in dispute over his arms with Lord Lovell (see A. Wagner,
&lt; Heralds and Heraldy in the Middle Ages (Oxford, 1956), pp. 20-2).
Both
&lt; claimed the right to bear: 'dargent ove un leon rampant de sable
&lt; corone et enarme dore'. This may account for the similarity of the
&lt; shields displayed on the 'Beatus' page, but their inexact colouring.
&lt; For a fuller discussion, see Michael, Thesis, p. 881 n. 326, and
&lt; appendix 6c, nos 11-15 for the shields.'
&lt;
&lt; I would be delighted if we could pin down the barry of ten.

Dear Newsgroup ~

Below is a revised an expanded account of Sir William de Morley, Knt.,
3rd Lord Morley, Marshal of Ireland, and his wife, Cecily Bardolf.
The account below reaffirms Cecily Bardolf's placement as the daughter
of Sir Thomas Bardolf, Knt., 2nd Lord Bardolf.  Sir William de Morley
is a lineal descendant of William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury, the
bastard son of King Henry II of England, by his mistress, Ida de
Tony.   Sir William de Morley's wife, Cecily Bardolf, is twice a
lineal descendant of Robert Fitz Roy, the bastard son of King Henry I
of England.

For interest's sake, the following a list of the 17th Century New
World immigrants that descend from Sir William de Morley and his wife,
Cecily Bardolf.

Account of Sir William de Morley, 3rd Lord Morley, and his wife,
Cecily Bardolf

I. WILLIAM DE MORLEY, Knt., 3rd Lord Morley, Marshal of Ireland, son
and heir by his father's 1st marriage, born 24 June 1319.  He married
by agreement dated 8 Dec. 1326 CECILY BARDOLF, daughter of Thomas
Bardolf, Knt., 2nd Lord Bardolf, of Wormegay, Norfolk, by Agnes, said
to be daughter of William de Grandison (or Graunson), Knt., 1st Lord
Grandison.  They had two sons, John and Thomas, Knt., K.G. [4th Lord
Morley].  In 1327-1328 William's father, Robert de Morley, Knt.,
settled the reversion of the manor of Roydon, Norfolk on Cecily
Bardolf, in accordance with the previous agreement he reached in 1326
with Cecily's father.  In 1345 William settled the manor of Aldeby,
Norfolk on himself, his wife Cecily, and his heirs.  In 1353 he owed
£100 to William de Middleton.  He served in Gascony in 1354, and took
part in the expedition of Prince Edward to Carcassonne and Narbonne in
1355.  He was summoned to Parliament from 4 Dec. 1364 to 16 Feb.
1378/9.  In 1370 he was prepared to lead 20 men-at-arms overseas in
the retinue of the King.  SIR WILLIAM DE MORLEY, 3rd Lord Morley,
Marshal of Ireland, died at Hallingbury, Essex 30 April 1379.  He left
a will dated 26 April 1379, proved 6 Feb. 1379/80.  His widow, Cecily,

Dear Newsgroup ~

Further evidence which conclusively establishes the parentage of
Cecily Bardolf (died 1386), wife of Sir William de Morley, 3rd Lord
Morley, Marshal of Ireland, can be found in the book, A Calendar of
the Cartularies of John Pyel and Adam Fraunceys, edited by S.J.
O'Connor (Camden 5th Ser. 2), published in 1993.  On page 139, there
is a certain memorandum which was recorded with respect to the sale of
various tenements and a watermill in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire
in1352 by Sir Robert de Morley, Marshal of Ireland, to Adam Fraunceys
and John Pyel, citizens and merchants of London.  This document
specifically states that the wife of Sir Robert de Morley's son and
heir, Sir William de Morley, was &quot;Cecily, the daughter of Sir Thomas
Bardolf.&quot;

Page 139:

&quot;And memorandum that the said tenements in Wellingborough with all
appurtenances descended to Sir William de Morlee as his right
inheritance, and after his death they descended to Sir Robert de
Morlee, knight, son and heir of Sir William.  And when Robert's own
son and heir William married Cecily, the daughter of Sir Thomas
Bardolf, he promised to grant to William his son and Cecily for their
sustenance, for the term of the life of Cecily, land totalling £100
per annum, to revert after her death to Robert and his heirs, and by
way of surety Sir Robert made a bond to Sir Thomas Bardolf, father of
Cecily, of £2,000.  And it was agreed between them that the tenements
in Wellingborough should be a parcel of the £100 per annum.  But Sir
Robert had not at any time enfeoffed Sir William or Cecily his wife in
anything before the date of the above charter and release, nor had Sir
Robert ever been out of possession of the said tenements in
Wellingborough before he enfeoffed Adam Fraunceys and John Pyel.
