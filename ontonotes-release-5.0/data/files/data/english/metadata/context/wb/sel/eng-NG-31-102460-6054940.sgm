Polls as Prologue

A former Army intelligence and public affairs officer, Captain May,
delves into the dark issue of whether the Bush admininstration has
already planned its October surprise in the form of a war with Iran --
and whether the American Establishment is going along with the idea.
Is War with Iran the October Surprise?

By Captain Eric H. May

Polls as Prologue

According to current polls, if the mid-term elections were held today,
President George W. Bush and his Republican Party would lose badly. He
would then face an opposition Congress in 2007, one bound and
determined to reassert its oversight duties. Investigations, an
inevitability, could easily lead to his impeachment, and in that event
the two-thirds of the United States who don't trust him could ask
troubling questions about his presidency, all the way back to the
still-murky events of 9/11.

If they're up to their duty, a new Congress could impeach him as a man
who was brought to power by a war cabal for the sole purpose of
starting a war in the Middle East. They could say that his allegiances
are not -- and never were -- to the American People. Rather, he has
been bought and paid for by the Oil Lobby, the Military-Industrial
Lobby and the Israel Lobby.

An American Armada

As I write, the U.S. Navy's Second Fleet has dispatched the aircraft
carrier Eisenhower, attended by a strike group of subordinate ships,
from its Norfolk home to the Persian Gulf, where it is due to arrive on
Oct. 21. The strike group will link up with other pre-positioned
military assets, and could easily start a war with Iran, making it part
of the ultimate October Surprise.

Officers from the Eisenhower have reached out to the government,
military and media ever since the orders came, protesting that they
don't want to be used to initiate a war with Iran. They assert that
this is against their service oath to the Constitution, which clearly
states that only the Congress -- not the president -- can start a war.
Their distress signal has reached official circles, thanks to a
September article by The Nation magazine. It's a confirmation of a New
Yorker story in the spring, by Seymour Hersh, alleging that the
Pentagon was then putting the brakes on a Bush administration itching
for a war with Iran.

Congress pretends not to notice what is happening, though, either too
scared, too involved or too implicated to do its duty. It shamelessly
gave away its authorization to an Iraq War in 2002, six months before
Bush began the attack, and hasn't said a word against what may be the
preparation for an Iran War in 2006. It's been many months since I've
heard Congress say it doesn't think Bush has the right to start a new
war -- and that means it thinks he does.

False Flags and False Friends

A false flag attack is one in which you or your war partners attack
your own forces while pretending to be someone else -- then blame it on
that someone else. As a lifelong soldier and military historian, it
seems quite possible to me a false flag attack on a U.S. ship in the
Persian Gulf could be planned to alter the upcoming U.S. elections. The
war would be blamed on Iran, of course.

The U.S. has often gone to war after Navy incidents that were dubious
at best, and false flag at worst. The Spanish-American War began after
the U.S.S. Maine conveniently blew up as it lay anchored in Havana
Harbor, where a jingoistic U.S. government had sent it as a provocation
to a senile Spain that was trying to put down a Cuban revolution. Our
government immediately called the explosion an attack, and blamed it on
Spain, against whom we afterward declared a patriotic imperial war.
Decades later we admitted to Spain that we knew they had not attacked
us. The explosion was officially called an "accident" -- but just how
accidental was it?

More and more evidence says that in the months before World War II, the
Navy and White House worked together to allow the Pearl Harbor attack
their own officers saw coming, the better to rouse the public for what
was to come. Have the same powerful officials decided that a Persian
Gulf Pearl Harbor is what we must suffer to start World War III?

If we don't want to do the unsavory job of a performing a false flag
attack on ourselves, we can always count on Israel to do anything
necessary to keep us fighting against their Middle Eastern enemies. In
1967, they launched an unsuccessful day-long assault against our U.S.S.
Liberty, then sailing well outside its territorial waters in the
Eastern Mediterranean. They intended to scuttle the ship, kill its
survivors, then blame the attack on Egypt, against whom they wanted us
to go to war. Not one in a hundred Americans know about the event; both
media and government have colluded to keep the fact silent.

The Devil's Delight

In the aftermath of a successful false flag attack, blamed on Iran,
Bush would have an easy answer to his current political and military
woes: a new enemy. Iran would certainly fight back against our Navy and
Air Force forces over its own territory, and would probably attack Army
and Marine forces in Iraq. In both cases it could inflict heavy
casualties, and thereby generate war rage in the United States. The
same cooperative media that led the American People against Afghanistan
in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 could lead it against Iran in 2006. The United
States would mobilize the economy and initiate the draft.

Bush could then use the war as a perfect excuse to sign the Detainee
Treatment Bill -- the torture bill -- that Congress delivered to his
desk two weeks ago. Thus empowered, he could suspend civil rights --
going back to habeas corpus -- from anyone he chooses, whether they are
foreigners or U.S. citizens. That would go a long way toward silencing
his domestic critics, whom he considers traitors, and who are the
greatest single impediment to the world war plan he has served.

All this would mean an American dictatorship, of course, but Bush came
into office saying he wouldn't mind one -- if he could be the dictator.
Funny, how the media never repeats the words that we really need to
hear to understand who Bush really is. Just a day ago he said that loss
in Iraq would mean the loss of the Middle East, and the loss of the
Middle East would mean the loss of the world's foremost strategic
resource, oil. He said we'd be condemned by distant posterity. He is a
man bent on war, and he doesn't care at all what we think of his means
or ends.

May God protect the United States of America.
