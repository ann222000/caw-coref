Why Is The Bible Different? 7

The Bible, the Word of God, is fundamentally different from all other
books for several reasons:

7. No other book describes man as realistically as does the Bible.
There are no comic exaggerations, no touched -up biographies an no
glorified heroism, which hides or veils the negative aspects of man.
This is why the sins of the patriarchs in the Bible (Gen. 12:11-13),
the adultery of David (2 Sam. 11) and the disorder of the churches (I
Cor. 1:11; 2 Cor. 2:1-4) are not omitted.

Every nation prepares archives telling of their own greatness, never
of their errors or blunders.  Yet, in the Bible, the history of God' s
own chosen people is given &quot;warts and all&quot;.  Truly the Bible, God's
own Word, is absolute truth and deals with reality.

Thank you for your _Lie of the Day_.

If you go back and re-read the comment, he didn't say the Bible is
&quot;the history of man.&quot;
He said, the Bible STARTS with the  history of God's chosen people
(the Jews).
And the histories began to be kept (memorized) orally CENTURIES
before being committed to writing!

What of the previous few million years that

And you know man has been around for millions of years because...

The bible is man made myth.

Actually, you couldn't be more wrong!  There is demonstratable
history (artifact evidence and all/ documented-- thanks to National
Geographic no less), there is sociology (how people interact), there
is law, there is morality (Do not murder your neighbor; do not lust
for or commit adultery with his wife)
There is science (anatomy, reproduction, digestion, astronomy,
metrology)

Good stuff!
And what's wrong with this command?  &quot;Do unto others as you would

There's NOTHING wrong with those words!

Which of course, it is not.  In reality, it's two history's.  The first
one, the creation of the universe, the second one, their creation of the

You were there?  Of course not.  The current evidence indicates that almost
all social histories were derived from oral traditions.  Traditions do not

Jewish bible.

An infantile non sequitur, a trademark of the natural poser.
You have the inability to understand the claim made by your mythology.  The
one that indicates that he was around long before humanity.  Geology
informs us, along with astronomy, that our planetary system has been around
for at least 10 billion years, and humanity in a much cleaner form,
approximately 5 million years.  It's a pity that you are paralyzed from the
eyebrows up and cannot understand these obvious things.

None of which support the claim of a god.  Sociology, a theme you aren't
concerned and lack knowledge about.  Law, predates the Judaic society.
Morality, predates the Judaic society.  Everything you claim support your
bible, which is only the Greek Testament, predates your claims.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There is none in the Hebrew bible, nor the Greek Testament.  What you do is
take a passage out of context, which of course is dishonest and does not

A lot of things, if you stop and think about it.  Not to mention that
command, predates the Greek Testament by no less than 50 years.  If you
want to discount everybody else's, Golden rule.  It's a remake of the
golden rule of several societies, to include the Judaic one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There's quite a bit, but you have to be able to think beyond your personal

Anybody else, maybe half an hour.

Then back it up, providing historical and sociological evidence, to back
your big, diarrheatic, unbounded mouth.

As usual, you're big on words, little on information.  Primarily due to
your lack of information and ability to process what little information
you have.

which wannabe this time, Jonny, the little foot stomper that can scream
with the best of them and whine because nobody else agrees with them?  Are
you going to lay down the floor and throw a tantrum now, or are you so the
going to push out your lips and hold your breath until they turn blue &amp;
someone suddenly picks you up and, tells you it's all right, dream on.

walksalone who would not mind, Jonny being paralyzed from the eyebrows up,
but he wants everybody to imitate him and tell them what a wonderful jolly
Charlie he really is.  Unfortunately for him, and in spite of his need of a
narcissistic fix, the majority of the audience, if not all, is not that
stupid.

And here's Jonny during one of his finer moments where he plays the role of
John seeks, bible scholar™ at large.

Bible and &quot;mythology&quot;

The Bible is true because we find truth in it.
We don't find any lies or distortions.
WE find prophesies that have been fulifilled. Prophesies that refer to
events
that have
occurred within the lives of people who are alive today.
I have seen fulfillments of prophesy, as have others.
If you are truly seeking, ask me.
I won't waste my energy writing about stuff no one is truly interested in
reading.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glorified heroism, which hides or veils the negative aspects of man.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is why the sins of the patriarchs in the Bible (Gen. 12:11-13),
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the adultery of David (2 Sam. 11) and the disorder of the churches (I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cor. 1:11; 2 Cor. 2:1-4) are not omitted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every nation prepares archives telling of their own greatness, never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of their errors or blunders.  Yet, in the Bible, the history of God' s
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own chosen people is given &quot;warts and all&quot;.  Truly the Bible, God's

One particular race of people were chosen?  Correct.
God examined all mankind, and found the one group (tribe) of nomads
who were essentially mono-theistic (most tribes were not), and who had
a moral law ALREADY. They didn't murder or eat unwanted children, they
didn't copulate with relatives (siblings, parents, children, 1st
cousins, in-laws), etc.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why Is The Bible Different? 7

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Bible, the Word of God, is fundamentally different from all other
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books for several reasons:

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. No other book describes man as realistically as does the Bible.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are no comic exaggerations, no touched -up biographies an no
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glorified heroism, which hides or veils the negative aspects of man.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is why the sins of the patriarchs in the Bible (Gen. 12:11-13),
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the adultery of David (2 Sam. 11) and the disorder of the churches (I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cor. 1:11; 2 Cor. 2:1-4) are not omitted.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every nation prepares archives telling of their own greatness, never
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of their errors or blunders.  Yet, in the Bible, the history of God' s
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own chosen people is given &quot;warts and all&quot;.  Truly the Bible, God's
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own Word, is absolute truth and deals with reality.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;*** Again arse over tit. How can the bible be man's history when written
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      only 2000 years ago?

&gt; &gt;&gt; If you go back and re-read the comment, he didn't say the Bible is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;the history of man.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  He said, the Bible STARTS with the  history of God's chosen people
&gt; &gt;&gt; (the Jews).

&gt; &gt;*** I gets to be even worse,

&gt; ?????  &quot; I gets to be even worse...&quot; ?

&gt;   Am I to guess English is not your primary tongue?

&gt;  are you telling me that this God chose one

&gt; &gt;particular type of humananity to be his/her favorite?

&gt;  One particular race of people were chosen?  Correct.
&gt;   God examined all mankind, and found the one group (tribe) of nomads
&gt; who were essentially mono-theistic (most tribes were not), and who had
&gt; a moral law ALREADY. They didn't murder or eat unwanted children, they
&gt; didn't copulate with relatives (siblings, parents, children, 1st
&gt; cousins, in-laws), etc.
">

Abraham did, he shagged his half-sister. And then this paragon of
virtue raped her maid whom he then turned out along with the child
that resulted from this unsavoury episode into the desert to survive
as best they could. Or not.

Leave it to an atheist who doesn't believe one word of the Bible to
begin with, but to &quot;disprove&quot; it, he'll find story after story HE
DOESN'T BELIEVE to begin with!

What's with THAT?

And you won't read it for Truth, but you'll spend HOURS looking for
something you can object to!

Do you read Shakespeare for the laughs, the INCREDIBLE poetry, and
for his astonishing knowledge (as a non-professional) of human nature?
Or do you skim it looking for the dirty words?

We normally will get out of our efforts what we put into them!

Or, to quote a recently invented pith, &quot;Garbage in, garbage out.&quot;

As usual, you are in error.  The god, él, was the senior god of the
Canaanite society.  Unfortunately for you, other people do know this.
What this means to your claims, is that the original population and the
Judean highlands were not chosen by any god.  They were part and parcel
of Canaanite society.

&gt;   God examined all mankind, and found the one group (tribe) of nomads

As usual, you are making things up.  The original story indicates that
one Abraham, who was a member of the society that worshiped él, was
hunted down by él and selected for special treatment.  According to this
official rumor, he had to be bribed.  Even in this most basic portion of
your myth, your ignorance shines through.

In case you don't understand the implications, the Canaanite society was
a rather moral society in a day and age, and had a rich history of legal

I don't know what you are smoking, but you're damn sight tripping.  As to
the sexual more's, males were allowed to &amp; expected to screw anything
they get away with.  This was typical of society that had a high loss of
men due to warfare, it is not unique to the ANE.  They were quite
familiar with, and commanding to provide their firstborn to be ample for
sacrifice.  They were so commanded, after the so-called Egyptian

&gt; &gt;&gt; Why Is The Bible Different? 7

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Bible, the Word of God, is fundamentally different from all other
&gt; &gt;&gt; books for several reasons:

&gt; &gt;&gt; 7. No other book describes man as realistically as does the Bible.
&gt; &gt;&gt; There are no comic exaggerations, no touched -up biographies an no
&gt; &gt;&gt; glorified heroism, which hides or veils the negative aspects of man.
&gt; &gt;&gt; This is why the sins of the patriarchs in the Bible (Gen. 12:11-13),
&gt; &gt;&gt; the adultery of David (2 Sam. 11) and the disorder of the churches (I
&gt; &gt;&gt; Cor. 1:11; 2 Cor. 2:1-4) are not omitted.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Every nation prepares archives telling of their own greatness, never
&gt; &gt;&gt; of their errors or blunders.  Yet, in the Bible, the history of God' s
&gt; &gt;&gt; own chosen people is given &quot;warts and all&quot;.  Truly the Bible, God's
&gt; &gt;&gt; own Word, is absolute truth and deals with reality.

&gt; &gt;*** Again arse over tit. How can the bible be man's history when written
&gt; &gt;      only 2000 years ago?

&gt;  If you go back and re-read the comment, he didn't say the Bible is
&gt; &quot;the history of man.&quot;
&gt;   He said, the Bible STARTS with the  history of God's chosen people
&gt; (the Jews).
">

Strictly speaking, Apobetics says that the Bible GIVES or RECOUNTS the
history of God's chosen people (which I assume he construes to include
Christians as well as Jews), not that it STARTS with the history of
the Jews.  Let us give credit where credit is due: he does not
overlook the fact that the Bible purports to START with the origins
and early history of the entire human species, not just the ones who
followed God.

Sorry, I'm in a pedantic mood right now.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;    And the histories began to be kept (memorized) orally CENTURIES
&gt; before being committed to writing!
">

Given your own remarks below, how do you know that?  Were you around
when they were first composed and memorized?  Perhaps more to the
point (since I'm not really interested in disputing the point that the
stories are older than the texts that record them), how do you know
that the stories were not modified in the course of transmission?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; What of the previous few million years that  he's been around?

&gt;   And you know man has been around for millions of years because...
&gt;   let me guess... you're millions of years old yourself?
">

How do you know that anything has been around for longer than you,
personally, have been alive?  You take note of evidence that supports
a certain age (or at least a certain minimum age) for it.  In the case
of humans, this is in the form of fossils and human artifacts that
are, for more recent specimens, radiometrically datable themselves,
and in more ancient specimens, dating using igneous rocks in the
strata in which they are found.

Now, you will perhaps argue that these methods are unreliable, in that
they assume &quot;uniformitarianism&quot; and overlook the possibility that
radiometric decay rates have changed (perhaps you will also say that
the methods overlook the possibility of parent isotopes or daughter
isotopes leaching into or out of the sample, but in that case you
would be simply wrong: isochron dating allows for these possibilities
to be checked).  But is this not the case for any sort of evidence of
age?  Eyewitness accounts, for example, rely both on the assumption
that the eyewitnesses are honest (one thing we know about human beings
is that they can lie -- even about being eyewitnesses -- or be
mistaken, or be misunderstood), and on the assumption that human
nature has not changed over time (i.e. uniformitarianism as applied to
human psychology during historical times).   The assumptions used to
justify the inference that, e.g. _Homo sapiens_ is a couple of hundred
thousand years old, and genus _Homo_ a couple of million years old),
are no more arbitrary and unsupported than the assumptions used to
justify any inference about past events, whether historical or
prehistoric.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;  The bible is man made myth.

&gt;   Actually, you couldn't be more wrong!  There is demonstratable
&gt; history (artifact evidence and all/ documented-- thanks to National
&gt; Geographic no less), there is sociology (how people interact), there
&gt; is law, there is morality (Do not murder your neighbor; do not lust
&gt; for or commit adultery with his wife)
&gt;   There is science (anatomy, reproduction, digestion, astronomy,
&gt; metrology)
">

Surely in another context, you would bring up the &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; hoax
that fooled _National Geographic_ (but not actual peer-reviewed
scientific journals).  _National Geographic_ is a good magazine, but
there are journals whose documentation of some artifact would be more
impressive and compelling (sorry, more pedantry).  But in any case,
certainly there are accurate references in the Bible to actual
historical events.  There are, to be sure, accurate references to
historical events in many fictional works, and also in many non-
fiction works that also contain serious inaccuracies.  Showing that
various cities and personages mentioned in the Bible existed in fact,
does not show even that the Bible is correct about all historical
matters that it discusses, much less that it is correct on matters of
human and planetary prehistory.  And yes, the Bible is full of details
of anatomy, physiology, astronomy, and so forth that could have been
discovered by ordinary human beings in the times in which it was
written.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   Good stuff!
&gt;   And what's wrong with this command?  &quot;Do unto others as you would
&gt; like them to do unto you.&quot;

But is that evidence that those words have a supernatural origin?

Nice strawman, where has he said he does not believe one word of the bible,
to begin with.  Where has he said that that will restore it will disprove
the entire thing.  What he has done, has shown you to be the ignorant

slavery and other things which are today, considered immoral and unethical.

Nice strawman, but again, you don't know at.  You can only prance around
wringing your hands as you piss and moan about having been shown up in your
ignorance.  By the way, their particular set of passages, is near the very
beginning of the saga.  Hours are not required.  Now if you want to get to
the mass murder and destruction of property of others, you can skip Joshua
and read judges, as well as the beloved king Joshiah , that fired up by the
priesthood, killed all the other priesthoods, such as those gods in the
highlands, and destroyed or desecrated their altars.  It's a very nasty
piece of work.  When examined with an open mind.  Typical of the society's
back then, I agree, but not a book I would use for ethical or moral
guidance.  Life and society give me the input I need for those two
particular studies or ways of life.  However, it is you want to call it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why Is The Bible Different? 7

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Bible, the Word of God, is fundamentally different from all other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books for several reasons:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. No other book describes man as realistically as does the Bible.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are no comic exaggerations, no touched -up biographies an no
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glorified heroism, which hides or veils the negative aspects of man.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is why the sins of the patriarchs in the Bible (Gen. 12:11-13),
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the adultery of David (2 Sam. 11) and the disorder of the churches (I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cor. 1:11; 2 Cor. 2:1-4) are not omitted.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every nation prepares archives telling of their own greatness, never
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of their errors or blunders.  Yet, in the Bible, the history of God' s
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own chosen people is given &quot;warts and all&quot;.  Truly the Bible, God's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own Word, is absolute truth and deals with reality.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;*** Again arse over tit. How can the bible be man's history when written
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      only 2000 years ago?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you go back and re-read the comment, he didn't say the Bible is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;the history of man.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  He said, the Bible STARTS with the  history of God's chosen people
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (the Jews).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;*** I gets to be even worse,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ?????  &quot; I gets to be even worse...&quot; ?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Am I to guess English is not your primary tongue?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  are you telling me that this God chose one

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;particular type of humananity to be his/her favorite?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  One particular race of people were chosen?  Correct.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   God examined all mankind, and found the one group (tribe) of nomads
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; who were essentially mono-theistic (most tribes were not), and who had
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a moral law ALREADY. They didn't murder or eat unwanted children, they
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; didn't copulate with relatives (siblings, parents, children, 1st
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cousins, in-laws), etc.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Abraham did, he shagged his half-sister. And then this paragon of
&gt;&gt; &gt;virtue raped her maid whom he then turned out along with the child
&gt;&gt; &gt;that resulted from this unsavoury episode into the desert to survive
&gt;&gt; &gt;as best they could. Or not.

&gt;&gt;   Leave it to an atheist who doesn't believe one word of the Bible to
&gt;&gt; begin with, but to &quot;disprove&quot; it, he'll find story after story HE
&gt;&gt; DOESN'T BELIEVE to begin with!

&gt;Right, leave it to an atheist. What has that got to do with my point,
&gt;is the atheist going to address it as you obviously have no intention
&gt;of doing so?

&gt;&gt;   What's with THAT?

&gt;What's with WHAT?

&gt;&gt;   And you won't read it for Truth, but you'll spend HOURS looking for
&gt;&gt; something you can object to!

&gt;Sorry to disillusion you but I have better things to do with my time.
">

Your loss entirely!  I've known of Presidents and I've known of
Kings, I've known of generals, and I've known of scientists, who would
not commit themselves to ANY serious endeavor without considerable
time spent in Bible reading/ study and prayer.

Dr Martin Luther, the famous religious leader from another century,
once said he wouldn't get a thing done all day if he didn't devote the
first hour or two of his day to Bible reading and prayer.

So you just don't know the TREASURES that would fill your life
(countless Christians can testify to that FACT) when you leave the
Bible / and God out of it!

&gt;&gt;   We normally will get out of our efforts what we put into them!

&gt;&gt;   Or, to quote a recently invented pith, &quot;Garbage in, garbage out.&quot;

&gt;Well that's only too evident.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Does he/she lord

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;over the whole world or just the biblical part e.g.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  ???  He is Lord of the universe.  (Genesis 1)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   He rules all men, all women, all animals, all nature. Whether you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; like it or not. At LEAST He is benevolent. When we are obedient (we
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; follow the owner's manual), He is good to us.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  the Palestinian end

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;of the Mediterranean sea?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   And the histories began to be kept (memorized) orally CENTURIES
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; before being committed to writing!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;*** A century is 100 years. A million is 1,000,000 years.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   I'm not going to debate with you how far back &quot;man&quot; goes.  You
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; weren't there, so you are merely accepting the GUESSES of others who
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; were also not there.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   I prefer the guesses of other scientists.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What of the previous few million years that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      he's been around?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  And you know man has been around for millions of years because...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  let me guess... you're millions of years old yourself?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;*** A childish question not worthy of an answer.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    A bone-headed reply not worthy of further discussion.  All you have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; said is that if I or others disagree with you, we're all wrong.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   You're all wrong.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Prove it.

&gt;&gt;   I have no need to prove ANYTHING to you!

&gt;You made a statement of fact therefore the onus is on you to PROVE IT
&gt;(see, I can use upper case too).

&gt;&gt;    YOu are absolutely free to believe what you wish.

&gt;Right on.

&gt;&gt;    As am I.

&gt;True. But this does not entitle you to present your beliefs as truth
&gt;while declaring the beliefs of others to be false without also
&gt;presenting the required proof.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The bible is man made myth.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Actually, you couldn't be more wrong!  There is demonstratable
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; history (artifact evidence and all/ documented-- thanks to National
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Geographic no less), there is sociology (how people interact), there
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is law, there is morality (Do not murder your neighbor; do not lust
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for or commit adultery with his wife)

&gt;&gt; &gt;Where are the bits that say do not enslave others, do not roger your
&gt;&gt; &gt;female relations (or was this one on the tablets and no one remembered
&gt;&gt; &gt;to tell Abraham?), do not hump your slaves/servants etc.

&gt;&gt;   The Bible accurately records the behavior / misbehavior of our
&gt;&gt; ancestors of the DISTANT past.

&gt;Never said otherwise. You claimed there is morality, I see only
&gt;selective morality which equates to no morality at all.

&gt;&gt;    Do you really want your great-great-great-great-great-great-great
&gt;&gt; grandchildren in 500 years to have to answer for YOUR behavior?

&gt;As I will not have any your question is irrelevant. Anyway why should
&gt;people have to answer for the behaviour of their great-great-great-
&gt;great-great-great-great grandparents?

&gt;&gt;  I don't!

&gt;Bully for you.

&gt;&gt;   How about we focus ourselves on your behavior / misbehavior this
&gt;&gt; past week.

&gt;I'm up for it. Where would you like to start?

&gt;&gt;  Or is that hitting too close?

&gt;To what?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  There is science (anatomy, reproduction,

&gt;&gt; &gt;Sure was a lot of that. Those patriarchs knew what they liked.

&gt;&gt;   I  note you are incapable (oh &quot;intellectual&quot;) of staying on topic.

&gt;Oh I'm right on topic. Not my fault if your fundamentalist blinkers
&gt;prevent you from seeing this.

&gt;&gt;   Have you considered having yourself tested for AADD?

&gt;Don't know what it is.

&gt;&gt;   Or if you're under 15 (which you seem to be),

&gt;Actually we're of the same generation. It's just that I managed to
&gt;mature along the way. Probably because of all the evolution literature
&gt;I avidly read.

&gt;&gt;you should be looked
&gt;&gt; at for possible ADD.

&gt;Don't know what it is.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;digestion, astronomy,

&gt;&gt; &gt;Like a stationary earth and an orbiting sun.

&gt;&gt;   The Bible does not describe a stationary earth or an orbiting sun.

&gt;Yes it does.

&gt;&gt; You are now confusing the Bible with some other ancient document.

&gt;No I'm not.

&gt;&gt;   That's what happens when you critique a book you have not actually

Hi walksalone.
I've a shameful confession to make re. Jolly John.
I only go after him because he takes it upon himself to defend
IKnowIFillPeopleWithTotalRevulsion who, as everyone knows, is a
cowardly lying piece of human garbage who posts and then crawls back
into the sewer. I've gotta take it out on someone and John apparently
never heard the old adage &quot;hold your hand out and you'll get it
smacked&quot;. In all fairness I try to cut him some slack as he is
bipolar, I don't actually know what that is but I believe it is some
type of mental disorder and as a lifelong sufferer from depression I
can appreciate that it cannot be much fun. However as long as he
persists in allying himself with human garbage and in trying to
denigrate those who do not agree with him I reserve the right to kick
his hairy arse and then hand it to him. Anyway his feeble attempts to
establish some sort of intellectual high ground amuse me.
Thanks for your support.
Cornelius.

&quot;I am in favour of animal rights as well as human rights. That is the
way of a whole human being.&quot; (Abraham Lincoln).

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  One particular race of people were chosen?  Correct.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   God examined all mankind, and found the one group (tribe) of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   nomads
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; who were essentially mono-theistic (most tribes were not), and who
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; had a moral law ALREADY. They didn't murder or eat unwanted
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; children, they didn't copulate with relatives (siblings, parents,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; children, 1st cousins, in-laws), etc.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Abraham did, he shagged his half-sister. And then this paragon of
&gt; &gt;&gt;virtue raped her maid whom he then turned out along with the child
&gt; &gt;&gt;that resulted from this unsavoury episode into the desert to survive
&gt; &gt;&gt;as best they could. Or not.

&gt; &gt;   Leave it to an atheist who doesn't believe one word of the Bible to
&gt; &gt; begin with, but to &quot;disprove&quot; it, he'll find story after story HE
&gt; &gt; DOESN'T BELIEVE to begin with!

&gt; Nice strawman, where has he said he does not believe one word of the bible,
&gt; to begin with.  Where has he said that that will restore it will disprove
&gt; the entire thing.  What he has done, has shown you to be the ignorant
&gt; blowhard you are.  The Hebrew bible is rife with rape, pillage, killing,
&gt; slavery and other things which are today, considered immoral and unethical.

&gt; &gt;   What's with THAT?

&gt; What's with what, you being shown up as a blowhard, that's perfectly
&gt; routine for anybody that knows the Hebrew or Greek Testaments.

&gt; &gt;   And you won't read it for Truth, but you'll spend HOURS looking for
&gt; &gt; something you can object to!

&gt; Nice strawman, but again, you don't know at.  You can only prance around
&gt; wringing your hands as you piss and moan about having been shown up in your
&gt; ignorance.  By the way, their particular set of passages, is near the very
&gt; beginning of the saga.  Hours are not required.  Now if you want to get to
&gt; the mass murder and destruction of property of others, you can skip Joshua
&gt; and read judges, as well as the beloved king Joshiah , that fired up by the
&gt; priesthood, killed all the other priesthoods, such as those gods in the
&gt; highlands, and destroyed or desecrated their altars.  It's a very nasty
&gt; piece of work.  When examined with an open mind.  Typical of the society's
&gt; back then, I agree, but not a book I would use for ethical or moral
&gt; guidance.  Life and society give me the input I need for those two
&gt; particular studies or ways of life.  However, it is you want to call it.

&gt; &gt;  Do you read Shakespeare for the laughs, the INCREDIBLE poetry, and
&gt; &gt; for his astonishing knowledge (as a non-professional) of human nature?

&gt; Don't read Shakespeare, never did particularly like it.  However, I
&gt; suspect, the list of authors I have read and do read exceeded dealers by a
&gt; rather obviously large quantity.  And they will be on more than one
&gt; subject.

&gt; &gt;   Or do you skim it looking for the dirty words?

&gt; Neither, I would leave it to somebody like you to look for the dirty words
&gt; and complain about them.

&gt; &gt;   We normally will get out of our efforts what we put into them!

&gt; Apparently, the effort you put into much of anything is minimal at best.
&gt; Of course, you pretend to study, only one subject.  But your inability to
&gt; read and comprehend what you have read is well-known.

&gt; &gt;   Or, to quote a recently invented pith, &quot;Garbage in, garbage out.&quot;

&gt; I have read the Hebrew bible as well as the Greek Testament, are you
&gt; calling them garbage now.  Are you pretending that you understand what I
&gt; read, as well as what others read, and that is garbage.  Either way, it's
&gt; your strawman.

&gt; snip

&gt; &gt;&gt;Where are the bits that say do not enslave others, do not roger your
&gt; &gt;&gt;female relations (or was this one on the tablets and no one remembered
&gt; &gt;&gt;to tell Abraham?), do not hump your slaves/servants etc.

&gt; &gt;   The Bible accurately records the behavior / misbehavior of our
&gt; &gt; ancestors of the DISTANT past.

&gt; No, it does not.  That would require myself and others to have a direct
&gt; lineage to archaic Judea.

&gt; &gt;    Do you really want your great-great-great-great-great-great-great
&gt; &gt; grandchildren in 500 years to have to answer for YOUR behavior?

&gt; You johnnie, are perfectly willing to have your great great great great
&gt; grand children answer for your behavior.  You certainly don't answer for it
&gt; now.

&gt; &gt;  I don't!

&gt; But you do, the

&gt; &gt;   How about we focus ourselves on your behavior / misbehavior this
&gt; &gt; past week.  Or is that hitting too close?

&gt; Nice strawman, nice attempted evasion, what does last week have to do with
&gt; what is recorded in your grimorie?  Your claim was that only the ethically
&gt; and morally pure were selected to follow your gods, a claim based on a
&gt; falsehood, on your part in shown to be false.  By using the Hebrew bible,
&gt; it was shown you know not of what you speak.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  There is science (anatomy, reproduction,

&gt; &gt;&gt;Sure was a lot of that. Those patriarchs knew what they liked.

&gt; &gt;   I  note you are incapable (oh &quot;intellectual&quot;) of staying on topic.
&gt; &gt;   Have you considered having yourself tested for AADD?

&gt; Another strawman, but that's all you have to offer.  Not to mention the
&gt; attempted attendant putdown of somebody who has shown you to be the phony
&gt; scholar™ you are.
&gt; He's as on topic is you ever have been, and of course, more knowledgeable.

&gt; &gt;   Or if you're under 15 (which you seem to be), you should be looked
&gt; &gt; at for possible ADD.

&gt; Again, with the camps, putting somebody else down, who has handed you your
&gt; ass.  Something you are rather famous for, because you have to do it so
&gt; frequently.
&gt; Weren't you the one saying that intellectuals don't do this, or was that
&gt; your evil twin brother.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;digestion, astronomy,

&gt; &gt;&gt;Like a stationary earth and an orbiting sun.

&gt; &gt;   The Bible does not describe a stationary earth or an orbiting sun.
&gt; &gt; You are now confusing the Bible with some other ancient document.

&gt; Oh but it does, and it doesn't wait around to get that job done either.

&gt; &gt;   That's what happens when you critique a book you have not actually
&gt; &gt; READ.

&gt; How do you know, the other person has not actually read the Hebrew bible.
&gt; Just because you have not read or understood it does not mean anybody else
&gt; has your limitations.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I am in favour of animal rights as well as human rights. That is the

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why Is The Bible Different? 7

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Bible, the Word of God, is fundamentally different from all other
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books for several reasons:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. No other book describes man as realistically as does the Bible.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are no comic exaggerations, no touched -up biographies an no
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glorified heroism, which hides or veils the negative aspects of man.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is why the sins of the patriarchs in the Bible (Gen. 12:11-13),
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the adultery of David (2 Sam. 11) and the disorder of the churches (I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cor. 1:11; 2 Cor. 2:1-4) are not omitted.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every nation prepares archives telling of their own greatness, never
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of their errors or blunders.  Yet, in the Bible, the history of God' s
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own chosen people is given &quot;warts and all&quot;.  Truly the Bible, God's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own Word, is absolute truth and deals with reality.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;*** Again arse over tit. How can the bible be man's history when written
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      only 2000 years ago?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you go back and re-read the comment, he didn't say the Bible is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;the history of man.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  He said, the Bible STARTS with the  history of God's chosen people
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (the Jews).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;*** I gets to be even worse,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ?????  &quot; I gets to be even worse...&quot; ?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Am I to guess English is not your primary tongue?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  are you telling me that this God chose one

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;particular type of humananity to be his/her favorite?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  One particular race of people were chosen?  Correct.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   God examined all mankind, and found the one group (tribe) of nomads
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; who were essentially mono-theistic (most tribes were not), and who had
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a moral law ALREADY. They didn't murder or eat unwanted children, they
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; didn't copulate with relatives (siblings, parents, children, 1st
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cousins, in-laws), etc.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Abraham did, he shagged his half-sister. And then this paragon of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;virtue raped her maid whom he then turned out along with the child
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that resulted from this unsavoury episode into the desert to survive
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;as best they could. Or not.

&gt; &gt;&gt;   Leave it to an atheist who doesn't believe one word of the Bible to
&gt; &gt;&gt; begin with, but to &quot;disprove&quot; it, he'll find story after story HE
&gt; &gt;&gt; DOESN'T BELIEVE to begin with!

&gt; &gt;Right, leave it to an atheist. What has that got to do with my point,
&gt; &gt;is the atheist going to address it as you obviously have no intention
&gt; &gt;of doing so?

&gt; &gt;&gt;   What's with THAT?

&gt; &gt;What's with WHAT?

&gt; &gt;&gt;   And you won't read it for Truth, but you'll spend HOURS looking for
&gt; &gt;&gt; something you can object to!

&gt; &gt;Sorry to disillusion you but I have better things to do with my time.

&gt;   Your loss entirely!  I've known of Presidents and I've known of
&gt; Kings, I've known of generals, and I've known of scientists, who would

Actually what I meant was that I have better things to do with my time
than &quot;spend HOURS looking for
something I can object to&quot;. If I indeed want something I can object
to all need do is log on to some of the bible-debunking websites out
there.

Luther was an excellent theologian who gave the Roman Catholic Church

Believe it or not I do appreciate the Bible, as a child I used it to
teach myself to read. I particularly enjoy Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.

&gt; &gt;&gt;    YOu are absolutely free to believe what you wish.

&gt; &gt;Right on.

&gt; &gt;&gt;    As am I.

&gt; &gt;True. But this does not entitle you to present your beliefs as truth
&gt; &gt;while declaring the beliefs of others to be false without also
&gt; &gt;presenting the required proof.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The bible is man made myth.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Actually, you couldn't be more wrong!  There is demonstratable
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; history (artifact evidence and all/ documented-- thanks to National
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Geographic no less), there is sociology (how people interact), there
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is law, there is morality (Do not murder your neighbor; do not lust
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for or commit adultery with his wife)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Where are the bits that say do not enslave others, do not roger your
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;female relations (or was this one on the tablets and no one remembered
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;to tell Abraham?), do not hump your slaves/servants etc.

&gt; &gt;&gt;   The Bible accurately records the behavior / misbehavior of our
&gt; &gt;&gt; ancestors of the DISTANT past.

&gt; &gt;Never said otherwise. You claimed there is morality, I see only
&gt; &gt;selective morality which equates to no morality at all.

&gt; &gt;&gt;    Do you really want your great-great-great-great-great-great-great
&gt; &gt;&gt; grandchildren in 500 years to have to answer for YOUR behavior?

&gt; &gt;As I will not have any your question is irrelevant. Anyway why should
&gt; &gt;people have to answer for the behaviour of their great-great-great-
&gt; &gt;great-great-great-great grandparents?

&gt; &gt;&gt;  I don't!

&gt; &gt;Bully for you.

&gt; &gt;&gt;   How about we focus ourselves on your behavior / misbehavior this
&gt; &gt;&gt; past week.

&gt; &gt;I'm up for it. Where would you like to start?

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Or is that hitting too close?

&gt; &gt;To what?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  There is science (anatomy, reproduction,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Sure was a lot of that. Those patriarchs knew what they liked.

&gt; &gt;&gt;   I  note you are incapable (oh &quot;intellectual&quot;) of staying on topic.

&gt; &gt;Oh I'm right on

&gt; Hi walksalone.
&gt; I've a shameful confession to make re. Jolly John.
&gt; I only go after him because he takes it upon himself to defend
&gt; IKnowIFillPeopleWithTotalRevulsion who, as everyone knows, is a
&gt; cowardly lying piece of human garbage who posts and then crawls back
&gt; into the sewer. I've gotta take it out on someone and John apparently
&gt; never heard the old adage &quot;hold your hand out and you'll get it
&gt; smacked&quot;. In all fairness I try to cut him some slack as he is
&gt; bipolar, I don't actually know what that is but I believe it is some

I have my doubts about him being bipolar, he is quick to grab any excuse
to excuse his conduct.  Narcissistic, now that I can except, his conduct
supports that claim.

&gt; his hairy arse and then hand it to him. Anyway his feeble attempts to

They are rather feeble attempts, aren't they, but then when you consider
the source, how could he be otherwise.  What is funny to me, is he
complains about others being less than competent or intellectual when
they resort to insult, but that's his preferred method of communication.
One could say, almost his only method.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thanks for your support.

You were not given support, what you saw was the fact, you happen to have
been correct.  And as usual, Jonny, the resident self-proclaimed
scholar�, was wrong.  It's nothing unusual to see him being wrong, and in
this case you were right.  Unfortunately for him, he demanded I pay
attention to him, somewhere around November of 2004, and he's too stupid
to realize then or now, exactly how he did it, but he sure wishes he had
not done it.
The bad part, I would probably feel obliged to correct his many errors,
whether or not he has demanded I pay attention to him.  Small errors are
meaningless, but his are anything but small.

I don't know about that, is jw animal or human and does he deserve any
rights.  Rights normally have to be earned and defended, he has failed in
the first, and cannot accomplish the second.

walksalone who appreciates knowing that on occasion, he gets it right.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why Is The Bible Different? 7

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Bible, the Word of God, is fundamentally different from all other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books for several reasons:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. No other book describes man as realistically as does the Bible.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are no comic exaggerations, no touched -up biographies an no
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glorified heroism, which hides or veils the negative aspects of man.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is why the sins of the patriarchs in the Bible (Gen. 12:11-13),
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the adultery of David (2 Sam. 11) and the disorder of the churches (I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cor. 1:11; 2 Cor. 2:1-4) are not omitted.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every nation prepares archives telling of their own greatness, never
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of their errors or blunders.  Yet, in the Bible, the history of God' s
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own chosen people is given &quot;warts and all&quot;.  Truly the Bible, God's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own Word, is absolute truth and deals with reality.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;*** Again arse over tit. How can the bible be man's history when written
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      only 2000 years ago?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you go back and re-read the comment, he didn't say the Bible is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;the history of man.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  He said, the Bible STARTS with the  history of God's chosen people
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (the Jews).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;*** I gets to be even worse,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ?????  &quot; I gets to be even worse...&quot; ?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Am I to guess English is not your primary tongue?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  are you telling me that this God chose one

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;particular type of humananity to be his/her favorite?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  One particular race of people were chosen?  Correct.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   God examined all mankind, and found the one group (tribe) of nomads
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; who were essentially mono-theistic (most tribes were not), and who had
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a moral law ALREADY. They didn't murder or eat unwanted children, they
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; didn't copulate with relatives (siblings, parents, children, 1st
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cousins, in-laws), etc.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Abraham did, he shagged his half-sister. And then this paragon of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;virtue raped her maid whom he then turned out along with the child
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that resulted from this unsavoury episode into the desert to survive
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;as best they could. Or not.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Leave it to an atheist who doesn't believe one word of the Bible to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; begin with, but to &quot;disprove&quot; it, he'll find story after story HE
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; DOESN'T BELIEVE to begin with!

&gt;&gt; &gt;Right, leave it to an atheist. What has that got to do with my point,
&gt;&gt; &gt;is the atheist going to address it as you obviously have no intention
&gt;&gt; &gt;of doing so?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   What's with THAT?

&gt;&gt; &gt;What's with WHAT?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   And you won't read it for Truth, but you'll spend HOURS looking for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; something you can object to!

&gt;&gt; &gt;Sorry to disillusion you but I have better things to do with my time.

&gt;&gt;   Your loss entirely!  I've known of Presidents and I've known of
&gt;&gt; Kings, I've known of generals, and I've known of scientists, who would
&gt;&gt; not commit themselves to ANY serious endeavor without considerable

&gt;Actually what I meant was that I have better things to do with my time

instrumental in the HUGE success the Allies had in removing Saddam's
forces from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War?
General Colin Powell, who MANY believe should run for President, and
General Norman Schwarzkopf.  Both are devoted, outspoken Christians.
Both have said they devote much time to Bible study and prayer.

General Schwarzkopf was ORDERED to not take a Bible to the Gulf. He
took his Bible ANYWAY. Said he would not go into battle without it!

Bi-polar disorder is a category of &quot;mental illness&quot; that carries a
HOST of symptoms. If you are curious, you can look it up on the web.
It's called &quot;bi-polar&quot; disorder because some of the major
characteristics are mood swings, or &quot;ups&quot; and &quot;downs.&quot;
Used to be called &quot;manic&quot; (ups) &quot;depression&quot; (downs).
Accompanying symptoms are lack of concentration, lack of focus,
difficulty in communicating with others, difficulty in
establishing/maintaining relationships.  Other symptoms run the gamut
from eating disorders (reflux) to insomnia.
Bi-polar people tend to be EXTREMELY intelligent (though not always)
and also HIGHLY creative.

&gt;Thanks for your support.
&gt;Cornelius.

&gt;&quot;I am in favour of animal rights as well as human rights. That is the
&gt;way of a whole human being.&quot; (Abraham Lincoln).

&gt;&gt; snip

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  One particular race of people were chosen?  Correct.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   God examined all mankind, and found the one group (tribe) of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   nomads
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; who were essentially mono-theistic (most tribes were not), and who
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; had a moral law ALREADY. They didn't murder or eat unwanted
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; children, they didn't copulate with relatives (siblings, parents,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; children, 1st cousins, in-laws), etc.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Abraham did, he shagged his half-sister. And then this paragon of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;virtue raped her maid whom he then turned out along with the child
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;that resulted from this unsavoury episode into the desert to survive
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;as best they could. Or not.

&gt;&gt; &gt;   Leave it to an atheist who doesn't believe one word of the Bible to
&gt;&gt; &gt; begin with, but to &quot;disprove&quot; it, he'll find story after story HE
&gt;&gt; &gt; DOESN'T BELIEVE to begin with!

&gt;&gt; Nice strawman, where has he said he does not believe one word of the bible,
&gt;&gt; to begin with.  Where has he said that that will restore it will disprove
&gt;&gt; the entire thing.  What he has done, has shown you to be the ignorant
&gt;&gt; blowhard you are.  The Hebrew bible is rife with rape, pillage, killing,
&gt;&gt; slavery and other things which are today, considered immoral and unethical.

&gt;&gt; &gt;   What's with THAT?

&gt;&gt; What's with what, you being shown up as a blowhard, that's perfectly
&gt;&gt; routine for anybody that knows the Hebrew or Greek Testaments.

&gt;&gt; &gt;   And you won't read it for Truth, but you'll spend HOURS looking for
&gt;&gt; &gt; something you can object to!

&gt;&gt; Nice strawman, but again, you don't know at.  You can only prance around
&gt;&gt; wringing your hands as you piss and moan about having been shown up in your
&gt;&gt; ignorance.  By the way, their particular set of passages, is near the very
&gt;&gt; beginning of the saga.  Hours are not required.  Now if you want to get to
&gt;&gt; the mass murder and destruction of property of others, you can skip Joshua
&gt;&gt; and read judges, as well as the beloved king Joshiah , that fired up by the
&gt;&gt; priesthood, killed all the other priesthoods, such as those gods in the
&gt;&gt; highlands, and destroyed or desecrated their altars.  It's a very nasty
&gt;&gt; piece of work.  When examined with an open mind.  Typical of the society's
&gt;&gt; back then, I agree, but not a book I would use for ethical or moral
&gt;&gt; guidance.  Life and society give me the input I need for those two
&gt;&gt; particular studies or ways of life.  However, it is you want to call it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  Do you read Shakespeare for the laughs, the INCREDIBLE poetry, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; for his astonishing knowledge (as a non-professional) of human nature?

&gt;&gt; Don't read Shakespeare, never did particularly like it.  However, I
&gt;&gt; suspect, the list of authors I have read and do read exceeded dealers by a
&gt;&gt; rather obviously large quantity.  And they will be on more than one
&gt;&gt; subject.

&gt;&gt; &gt;   Or do you skim it looking for the dirty words?

&gt;&gt; Neither, I would leave it to somebody like you to look for the dirty words
&gt;&gt; and complain about them.

&gt;&gt; &gt;   We normally will get out of our efforts what we put into them!

&gt;&gt; Apparently, the effort you put into much of anything is minimal at best.
&gt;&gt; Of course, you pretend to study, only one subject.  But your inability to
&gt;&gt; read and comprehend what you have read is well-known.

&gt;&gt; &gt;   Or, to quote a recently invented pith, &quot;Garbage in, garbage out.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I have read the Hebrew bible as well as the Greek Testament, are you
&gt;&gt; calling them garbage now.  Are you pretending that you understand what I
&gt;&gt; read, as well as what others read, and that is garbage.  Either way, it's
&gt;&gt; your strawman.

&gt;&gt; snip

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Where are the bits that say do not enslave others, do not roger your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;female relations (or was this one on the tablets and no one remembered
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;to tell Abraham?), do not hump your slaves/servants etc.

&gt;&gt; &gt;   The Bible accurately records the behavior / misbehavior of our
&gt;&gt; &gt; ancestors of the DISTANT past.

&gt;&gt; No, it does not.  That would require myself and others to have a direct
&gt;&gt; lineage to archaic Judea.

&gt;&gt; &gt;    Do you really want your great-great-great-great-great-great-great
&gt;&gt; &gt; grandchildren in 500 years to have to answer for YOUR behavior?

&gt;&gt; You johnnie, are perfectly willing to have your great great great great
&gt;&gt; grand children answer for your behavior.  You certainly don't answer for it
&gt;&gt; now.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  I don't!

&gt;&gt; But you do, the

&gt;&gt; &gt;   How about we focus ourselves on your behavior / misbehavior this
&gt;&gt; &gt; past week.  Or is that hitting too close?

&gt;&gt; Nice strawman, nice attempted evasion, what does last week have to do with
&gt;&gt; what is recorded in your grimorie?  Your claim was that only the ethically
&gt;&gt; and morally pure were selected to follow your gods, a claim based on a

&gt;&gt; smacked&quot;. In all fairness I try to cut him some slack as he is
&gt;&gt; bipolar, I don't actually know what that is but I believe it is some

&gt;I have my doubts about him being bipolar, he is quick to grab any excuse
&gt;to excuse his conduct.  Narcissistic, now that I can except, his conduct
&gt;supports that claim.

You have YET to post your medical / psychiatric credentials,

&gt;But you have learned how to deal with your problems, you have learned
&gt;that if medication is required, you take it.  You are willing to accept
&gt;responsibility for yourself.  And he is not.  There is a major
&gt;difference.

&gt;&gt; persists in allying himself with human garbage and in trying to
&gt;&gt; denigrate those who do not agree with him I reserve the right to kick
&gt;&gt; his hairy arse and then hand it to him. Anyway his feeble attempts to
&gt;&gt; establish some sort of intellectual high ground amuse me.

&gt;They are rather feeble attempts, aren't they, but then when you consider
&gt;the source, how could he be otherwise.  What is funny to me, is he
&gt;complains about others being less than competent or intellectual when
&gt;they resort to insult, but that's his preferred method of communication.
&gt;One could say, almost his only method.

&gt;&gt; Thanks for your support.

&gt;You were not given support, what you saw was the fact, you happen to have
&gt;been correct.  And as usual, Jonny, the resident self-proclaimed
&gt;scholar™, was wrong.  It's nothing unusual to see him being wrong, and in
&gt;this case you were right.  Unfortunately for him, he demanded I pay
&gt;attention to him, somewhere around November of 2004, and he's too stupid
&gt;to realize then or now, exactly how he did it, but he sure wishes he had
&gt;not done it.
&gt;The bad part, I would probably feel obliged to correct his many errors,
&gt;whether or not he has demanded I pay attention to him.  Small errors are
&gt;meaningless, but his are anything but small.

&gt;&gt; &quot;I am in favour of animal rights as well as human rights. That is the
&gt;&gt; way of a whole human being.&quot; (Abraham Lincoln).

&gt;I don't know about that, is jw animal or human and does he deserve any
&gt;rights.  Rights normally have to be earned and defended, he has failed in
&gt;the first, and cannot accomplish the second.
