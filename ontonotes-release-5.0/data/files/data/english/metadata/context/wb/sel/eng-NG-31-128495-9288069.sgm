&gt;&gt; Ex-Commander Says Iraq Effort Is ~a Nightmare

&gt;&gt; By DAVID S. CLOUD

&gt;&gt; WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 &quot; In a sweeping indictment of the four-year effort
&gt;&gt; in Iraq, the former top commander of American forces there called the
&gt;&gt; Bush administrations handling of the war incompetent and said the
&gt;&gt; result was a nightmare with no end in sight.

&gt;&gt; Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, who retired in 2006 after being replaced
&gt;&gt; in Iraq after the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal, blamed the Bush
&gt;&gt; administration for a catastrophically flawed, unrealistically
&gt;&gt; optimistic war plan and denounced the current addition of American
&gt;&gt; forces as a desperate move that would not achieve long-term stability.

&gt;&gt; After more than four years of fighting, America continues its
&gt;&gt; desperate struggle in Iraq without any concerted effort to devise a
&gt;&gt; strategy that will achieve victory in that war-torn country or in the
&gt;&gt; greater conflict against extremism, General Sanchez said at a
&gt;&gt; gathering of military reporters and editors in Arlington, Va.

&gt;&gt; He is the most senior war commander of a string of retired officers who
&gt;&gt; have harshly criticized the administrations conduct of the war. While
&gt;&gt; much of the previous condemnation has been focused on the role of
&gt;&gt; former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, General Sanchezs was an
&gt;&gt; unusually broad attack on the overall course of the war.

&gt;&gt; But his own role as commander in Iraq during the Abu Ghraib scandal
&gt;&gt; leaves him vulnerable to criticism that he is shifting the blame from
&gt;&gt; himself to the administration that ultimately replaced him and declined
&gt;&gt; to nominate him for a fourth star, forcing his retirement.

&gt;&gt; Though he was cleared of wrongdoing in the abuses after an inquiry by
&gt;&gt; the Armys inspector general, General Sanchez became a symbol &quot; with
&gt;&gt; civilian officials like L. Paul Bremer III, the head of the Coalition
&gt;&gt; Provisional Authority &quot; of ineffective American leadership early in the
&gt;&gt; occupation.

&gt;&gt; General Sanchez said he was convinced that the American effort in Iraq
&gt;&gt; was failing the day after he took command, in June 2003. Asked why he
&gt;&gt; waited until nearly a year after his retirement to voice his concerns
&gt;&gt; publicly, he responded that it was not the place of active-duty
&gt;&gt; officers to challenge lawful orders from the civilian authorities.

&gt;&gt; General Sanchez, who is said to be considering writing a book, promised
&gt;&gt; further public statements criticizing officials by name.

&gt;&gt; There has been a glaring and unfortunate display of incompetent
&gt;&gt; strategic leadership within our national leaders, he said, adding that
&gt;&gt; civilian officials have been derelict in their duties and guilty of a
&gt;&gt; lust for power.

&gt;&gt; White House officials would not comment directly on General Sanchezs
&gt;&gt; remarks. We appreciate his service to the country, said Kate Starr, a
&gt;&gt; White House spokeswoman.

&gt;&gt; She noted that Gen. David H. Petraeus, the current top commander in
&gt;&gt; Iraq, and Ryan C. Crocker, the American ambassador to Baghdad, said in
&gt;&gt; their testimony to Congress last month that theres more work to be
&gt;&gt; done, but progress is being made in Iraq. And thats what were focused
&gt;&gt; on now.

&gt;&gt; General Sanchez has been criticized by some current and retired
&gt;&gt; officers for failing to recognize the growing insurgency in Iraq during
&gt;&gt; his year in command and for failing to put together a plan to unify the
&gt;&gt; disparate military effort, a task that was finally carried out when his
&gt;&gt; successor, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., took over in mid-2006.

&gt;&gt; General Sanchez included the military and himself among those who made
&gt;&gt; mistakes in Iraq, citing a failure by top commanders to insist on a
&gt;&gt; better post-invasion stabilization plan. He offered a tepid compliment
&gt;&gt; to General Petraeus. The general, he said, could use American troops to
&gt;&gt; gain time in Iraq but could not achieve lasting results.

&gt;&gt; Michael E. OHanlon, a military analyst at the Brookings Institution,
&gt;&gt; criticized General Sanchez for implying in his speech that the current
&gt;&gt; military strategy of relying on additional troops and on protecting the
&gt;&gt; Iraqi people is little different than the strategy employed when he was
&gt;&gt; in command.

&gt;&gt; Noting that calls by members of Congress for troops were rebuffed by
&gt;&gt; the Bush administration in 2003, Mr. OHanlon said, Sanchez was one of
&gt;&gt; the top military people who condoned that, if not directly, then by his
&gt;&gt; silence.

&gt;&gt; General Sanchezs main criticism was leveled at the Bush
&gt;&gt; administration, which he said failed to mobilize the entire United
&gt;&gt; States government, not just the military, to contribute meaningfully to
&gt;&gt; reconstructing and stabilizing Iraq.

&gt;&gt; National leadership continues to believe that victory can be achieved
&gt;&gt; by military power alone, he said. Continued manipulations and
&gt;&gt; adjustments to our military strategy will not achieve victory. The best
&gt;&gt; we can do with this flawed approach is stave off defeat.

&gt;&gt; Asked after his remarks what strategy he favored, General Sanchez
&gt;&gt; ticked off a series of steps&quot;from promoting reconciliation among Iraqs
&gt;&gt; warring sectarian factions to building effective Iraqi army and police
&gt;&gt; units &quot; that closely paralleled the list of tasks frequently cited by
&gt;&gt; the Bush administration as the pillars of the current strategy.

&gt;&gt; General Sanchez, now a Pentagon consultant who trains active-duty
&gt;&gt; generals, said the administrations biggest failure had been its lack
&gt;&gt; of a detailed strategy for achieving those steps and synchronizing
&gt;&gt; the military and civilian contributions.

&gt;&gt; The administration, Congress and the entire inter-agency, especially
&gt;&gt; the State Department, must shoulder responsibility for the catastrophic
&gt;&gt; failure, and the American people must hold them accountable, he said.

&gt;&gt; His talk on Friday at the annual convention of the Military Reporters
&gt;&gt; and Editors Association was not the first time that General Sanchez has
&gt;&gt; been critical of the administration.

&gt;&gt; He said in an interview in June with Agence France-Presse that the best
&gt;&gt; the United States could achieve in Iraq would be stalemate. And he drew
&gt;&gt; a standing ovation at a gathering of veterans last month when he argued
&gt;&gt; that the countrys problems in Iraq were the result of a crisis in
&gt;&gt; national political leadership.

&gt;&gt; Though General Sanchez remained on active duty after leaving Iraq in
&gt;&gt; 2004, he never received a fourth star, in part because, though he was
&gt;&gt; popular with Mr. Rumsfeld, the Bush administration feared that his
&gt;&gt; nomination hearings in the Senate would turn into a bitter partisan
&gt;&gt; fight and a public replay of the details of the Abu Ghraib scandal.
