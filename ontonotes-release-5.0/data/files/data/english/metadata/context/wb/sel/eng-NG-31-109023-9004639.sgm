The Nuremberg Trials and the Holocaust
Do the 'war crimes' trials prove extermination?
by Mark Weber
A common response to expressions of skepticism about the Holocaust story is
to say something like &quot;What about Nuremberg? What about the trials and all
the evidence?!&quot; This reaction is understandable because the many postwar
&quot;war crimes&quot; trials have given explicit, authoritative judicial legitimacy
to the Holocaust extermination story.

By far the most important of these was the great Nuremberg trial of
1945-1946, officially known as the International Military Tribunal (IMT).
The governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France
put on trial the most prominent surviving German leaders as &quot;Major War
Criminals&quot; for various &quot;war crimes,&quot; &quot;crimes against peace,&quot; and &quot;crimes
against humanity.&quot; In the words of the Tribunal's Charter, these &quot;Nazi
conspirators&quot; carried out their crimes as part of a great &quot;Common Plan or
Conspiracy.&quot;

In addition, twelve secondary Nuremberg trials (NMT) organized by the US
government alone were conducted between 1946 to 1949. Similar trials were
also conducted by the British at Lüneburg and Hamburg, and by the United
States at Dachau. Since then, many other Holocaust-related trials have been
held in West Germany, Israel and the United States, including the
highly-publicized trials in Jerusalem of Adolf Eichmann and John Demjanjuk.

Germany's wartime treatment of the Jews figured prominently in the Nuremberg
trials. In their condemnation of the defendants, the Allies gave special
emphasis to the alleged extermination of six million European Jews. Chief US
prosecutor Robert H. Jackson, for example, declared in his opening address
to the Tribunal: (note 1)

The most savage and numerous crimes planned and committed by the Nazis were
those against the Jews ... It is my purpose to show a plan and design, to
which all Nazis were fanatically committed, to annihilate all Jewish
people.... The avowed purpose was the destruction of the Jewish people as a
whole... The conspiracy or common plan to exterminate the Jews was ...
methodically and thoroughly pursued... History does not record a crime ever
perpetrated against so many victims or one ever carried out with such
calculated cruelty.

Echoing these words, chief British prosecutor Sir Hartley Shawcross declared
in his final address to the Tribunal: (note 2)

There is one group to which the method of annihilation was applied on a
scale so immense that it is my duty to refer separately to the evidence. I
mean the extermination of the Jews. If there were no other crime against
these men [the defendants], this one alone, in which all of them were
implicated, would suffice. History holds no parallel to these horrors.

How compelling was the evidence presented at Nuremberg to substantiate such
damning words? How did the defendants respond to the charges?

While much of the specific testimony and documentation presented in these
trials has been dealt with in other Journal articles, here we take a closer
look at the general trustworthiness of the evidence cited at Nuremberg and
elsewhere for the Holocaust extermination story. This chapter also focuses
on the basic character of these trials, which have played such an important
role in &quot;legitimizing&quot; the Holocaust story.

Political justice
The Nuremberg enterprise violated ancient and fundamental principles of
justice. The victorious Allies acted as prosecutor, judge and executioner of
the German leaders. The charges were created especially for the occasion,
and were applied only to the vanquished. (note 3) Defeated, starving,
prostrate Germany was, however, in no position to oppose whatever the Allied
occupation powers demanded.

As even some leading Allied figures privately acknowledged at the time, the
Nuremberg trials were organized not to dispense impartial justice, but for
political purposes. Sir Norman Birkett, British alternate judge at the
Nuremberg Tribunal, explained in a private letter in April 1946 that &quot;the
trial is only in form a judicial process and its main importance is
political.&quot; (note 4)

Robert Jackson, the chief US prosecutor and a former US Attorney General,
declared that the Nuremberg Tribunal &quot;is a continuation of the war effort of
the Allied nations&quot; against Germany. He added that the Tribunal &quot;is not
bound by the procedural and substantive refinements of our respective
judicial or constitutional system ...&quot; (note 5)

Judge Iola T. Nikitchenko, who presided at the Tribunal's solemn opening
session, was a vice-chairman of the supreme court of the USSR before and
after his service at Nuremberg. In August 1936 he had been a judge at the
infamous Moscow show trial of Zinoviev and Kamenev. (note 6) At a joint
planning conference shortly before the Nuremberg Tribunal convened,
Nikitchenko bluntly explained the Soviet view of the enterprise: (note 7)

We are dealing here with the chief war criminals who have already been
convicted and whose conviction has been already announced by both the Moscow
and Crimea [Yalta] declarations by the heads of the [Allied] governments...
The whole idea is to secure quick and just punishment for the crime...

The fact that the Nazi leaders are criminals has already been established.
The task of the Tribunal is only to determine the measure of guilt of each
particular person and mete out the necessary punishment -- the sentences.

Indicative of the largely political nature of the Nuremberg process was the
important Jewish role in organizing these trials. Nahum Goldmann, one-time
president of both the World Jewish Congress and the World Zionist
Organization, reported in his memoir that the Nuremberg Tribunal was the
brain-child of World Jewish Congress officials. Only after persistent effort
were WJC officials able to persuade Allied leaders to accept the idea, he
added. (note 8)

The World Jewish Congress also played an important but less obvious role in
the day to day proceedings. Above all, the powerful but secretive
organization made sure that Germany's persecution of the Jews was a primary
focus of the trials, and that the defendants were punished for their
involvement in that process. (note 9)

Two Jewish officers in the US Army -- Lieutenant Colonel Murray Bernays and
Colonel David &quot;Mickey&quot; Marcus -- played key roles in the Nuremberg
enterprise. In the words of historian Robert Conot, Bernays was &quot;the guiding
spirit leading the way to Nuremberg.&quot; Bernays, a successful New York
attorney, persuaded US War Secretary Henry Stimson and others to accept the
idea of putting the defeated German leaders on trial. (note 10)

Marcus, a fervent Zionist, became the &quot;number three man in making American
policy&quot; in occupied Germany. As chief of the US government's War Crimes
Branch in 1946 and 1947, he selected almost all of the judges, prosecutors
and lawyers for the Nuremberg NMT Trials. (He later became a commander of
Zionist &quot;Haganah&quot; military forces in Palestine.) (note 11)

Some of the Americans who participated in the Nuremberg trials became
disillusioned with the entire business. One of the few to make public his
feelings was Charles F. Wennerstrum, an Iowa Supreme Court justice who
served as presiding judge in the Nuremberg trial of German generals. &quot;If I
had known seven months ago what I know today, I would never have come here,&quot;
he declared immediately after sentences were pronounced. &quot;The high ideals
announced as the motives for creating these tribunals have not been
evident,&quot; he added. (note 12)

Wennerstrum cautiously referred to the extensive Jewish involvement in the
Nuremberg process. &quot;The entire atmosphere here is unwholesome ... Lawyers,
clerks, interpreters and researchers were employed who became Americans only
in recent years, whose backgrounds were imbedded in Europe's hatreds and
prejudices.&quot; He criticized the one-sided handling of evidence. &quot;Most of the
evidence in the trials was documentary, selected from the large tonnage of
captured records. The selection was made by the prosecution. The defense had
access only to those documents which the prosecution considered material to
the case.&quot; He concluded that &quot;the trials were to have convinced the Germans
of the guilt of their leaders. They convinced the Germans merely that their
leaders lost the war to tough conquerors.&quot; Wennerstrum left Nuremberg &quot;with
a feeling that justice has been denied.&quot;

America's leading jurist was dismayed by the Nuremberg process. US Supreme
Court Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone remarked with irritation: &quot;[Chief US
prosecutor] Jackson is away conducting his high-grade lynching party in
Nuremberg. I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the
pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law.
This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas.&quot;
In a private letter he wrote: &quot;... I wonder how some of those who preside at
the trials would justify some of the acts of their own governments if they
were placed in the status of the accused.&quot; On another occasion Stone
specifically wondered &quot;whether, under this new [Nuremberg] doctrine of
international law, if we had been defeated, the victors could plausibly
assert that our supplying Britain with fifty destroyers [in 1940] was an act
of aggression ...&quot; (note 13)

In Congress, US Representative Lawrence H. Smith of Wisconsin declared: &quot;The
Nuremberg trials are so repugnant to the Anglo-Saxon principles of justice
that we must forever be ashamed of that page in our history ... The
Nuremberg farce represents a revenge policy at its worst.&quot; (note 14) Another
Congressman, John Rankin of Mississippi, stated: &quot;As a representative of the
American people I desire to say that what is taking place in Nuremberg,
Germany, is a disgrace to the United States... A racial minority, two and a
half years after the war closed, are in

The Nuremberg Trials and the Holocaust
(continued from part 1)

Torture
Allied prosecutors used torture to help prove their case at Nuremberg and
other postwar trials. (note 72)

Former Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss was tortured by British officials
into signing a false and self-incriminating &quot;confession&quot; that has been
widely cited as a key document of Holocaust extermination. His testimony
before the Nuremberg Tribunal, a high point of the proceeding, was perhaps
the most striking and memorable evidence presented there of a German
extermination program. (note 73) Höss maintained that two and half million
people had been killed in Auschwitz gas chambers, and that another 500,000
inmates had died there of other causes. No serious or reputable historian
now accepts either of these fantastic figures, and other key portions of
Höss' &quot;confession&quot; are now generally acknowledged to be untrue. (note 74)

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn has cited the case of Jupp Aschenbrenner, a Bavarian
who was tortured into signing a statement that he had worked on mobile gas
chambers (&quot;gas vans&quot;) during the war. It wasn't until several years later
that he was finally able to prove that he had actually spent that time in
Munich studying to become an electric welder. (note 75)

Fritz Sauckel, head of the German wartime labor mobilization program, was
sentenced to death at the main Nuremberg trial. An important piece of
evidence presented to the Tribunal by the US prosecution was an affidavit
signed by the defendant. (Nuremberg document 3057-PS.) It turned out that
Sauckel had put his signature to this self-incriminating statement, which
had been presented to him by his captors in finished form, only after he was
bluntly told that if he hesitated, his wife and children would be turned
over to the Soviets. &quot;I did not stop to consider, and thinking of my family,
I signed the document,&quot; Sauckel later declared. (note 76)

Hans Fritzsche, another defendant in the main Nuremberg trial, was similarly
forced to sign a self-damning confession while he was a prisoner of the
Soviet secret police in Moscow. (Nuremberg document USSR-474.) (note 77)

Nuremberg defendant Julius Streicher, who was eventually hanged because he
published a sometimes sensational anti-Jewish weekly paper, was brutally
mistreated following his arrest. He was badly beaten, kicked, whipped, spat
at, forced to drink saliva and burned with cigarettes. His genitals were
beaten. Eyebrow and chest hair was pulled out. He was stripped and
photographed. Fellow defendant Hans Frank was savagely beaten by two black
GIs shortly after his arrest. August Eigruber, former Gauleiter of Upper
Austria, was mutilated and castrated at the end of the war. (note 78)

Josef Kramer, former commandant of both the BergenBelsen and
Auschwitz-Birkenau camps, and other defendants in the British-run &quot;Belsen&quot;
trial, were reportedly also tortured, some of them so brutally that they
begged to be put to death. (note 79)

Although most of the defendants at the main Nuremberg trial were not
tortured, many other Germans were forced to sign affidavits and give
testimony against their former colleagues and superiors. A simple threat to
turn the subject over to the Soviets was often enough to persuade him to
sign an affidavit or provide testimony needed in court. Threats against the
subject's wife and children, including withdrawal of ration cards, delivery
to the Soviets or imprisonment, often quickly produced the desired results.
If all else failed, the subject could be placed in solitary confinement,
beaten, kicked, whipped or burned until he broke down. (note 80)

The testimony of the prosecution's chief witness in the Nuremberg
&quot;Wilhelmstrasse&quot; trial was obtained by threat of death. The American defense
attorney, Warren Magee, had somehow obtained the transcript of the first
pretrial interrogation of Friedrich Gaus, a former senior official in the
German Foreign Office. Despite frantic protests by prosecuting attorney
Robert Kempner, the judge decided to permit Magee to read from the document.
During the pretrial interrogation session, Kempner told Gaus that he would
be turned over to the Soviets for hanging. Tearfully pleading for mercy,
Gaus begged Kempner to think of his wife and children. Kempner replied that
he could save himself only by testifying in court against his former
colleagues. A desperate Gaus, who had already endured four weeks in solitary
confinement, agreed. When Magee finished reading from the damning
transcript, Gaus sat with both hands to his face, totally devastated. (note
81)

American soldiers repeatedly beat former SS captain Konrad Morgen in an
unsuccessful effort to force him to sign a perjured affidavit against Ilse
Koch, a defendant in the US military's 1947 &quot;Buchenwald&quot; case. American
officials also threatened to turn Morgen over to the Soviets if he did not
sign the false statement. (note 82)

Luftwaffe General Field Marshal Erhard Milch was warned by a US Army Major
to stop testifying on behalf of Hermann Göring in the main Nuremberg trial.
The American officer told Milch that if he persisted, he would be charged as
a war criminal himself, regardless of whether or not he was guilty. (note
83) Milch did not back down and was indeed charged. In 1947 a US Nuremberg
court sentenced him to life imprisonment as a war criminal. Four years
later, though, the US High Commissioner commuted his sentence to fifteen
years, and a short time after that Milch was amnestied and released. (note
84)

Reports of widespread torture at the postwar American-run &quot;war crimes&quot;
trials at Dachau leaked out, resulting in so many protests that a formal
investigation was eventually carried out. A US Army Commission of inquiry
consisting of Pennsylvania Judge Edward van Roden and Texas Supreme Court
Judge Gordon Simpson officially confirmed the charges of gross abuse. German
defendants, they found, were routinely tortured at Dachau with savage
beatings, burning matches under fingernails, kicking of testicles, months of
solitary confinement, and threats of family reprisals. Low ranking prisoners
were assured that their &quot;confessions&quot; would be used only against their
former superiors in the dock. Later, though, these hapless men found their
own &quot;confessions&quot; used against them when they were tried in turn. High
ranking defendants were cynically assured that by &quot;voluntarily&quot; accepting
all responsibility themselves they would thereby protect their former
subordinates from prosecution.85

One Dachau trial court reporter was so outraged at what was happening there
in the name of justice that he quit his job. He testified to a US Senate
subcommittee that the &quot;most brutal&quot; interrogators had been three German-born
Jews. Although operating procedures at the Dachau trials were significantly
worse than those used at Nuremberg, they give some idea of the spirit of the
&quot;justice&quot; imposed on the vanquished Germans.

Virtually all of the US investigators who brought cases before American
military courts at Dachau were &quot;Jewish refugees from Germany&quot; who &quot;hated the
Germans,&quot; recalled Joseph Halow, a US Army court reporter at the Dachau
trials in 1947. &quot;Many of the investigators gave vent to their hated by
attempting to force confessions from the Germans by treating them brutally,&quot;
including &quot;severe beatings.&quot;86

The case of Gustav Petrat, a German who had served as a guard at the
Mauthausen, was not unusual. After repeated brutal beatings by US
authorities, he broke down and signed a perjured statement. He was also
whipped and threatened with immediate shooting. Petrat was prevented from
securing exonerating evidence, and even potential defense witnesses were
beaten and threatened to keep them from testifying. After a farcical trial
by a US military court at Dachau, Petrat was sentenced to death and hanged
in late 1948. He was 24 years old.87

Use of torture to produce incriminating statements has not been limited to
postwar Germany, of course. Such techniques have been systematically used by
governments around the world. During the Korean War, American airmen held as
prisoners by the Communist North Koreans made detailed statements
&quot;confessing&quot; to their roles in waging germ warfare. Under physical and
psychological torture, 38 US airmen &quot;admitted&quot; dropping bacteriological
bombs that caused disease epidemics and claimed many Korean civilian lives.
These statements were later shown to be false, and the airmen repudiated
them after returning to the United States. Their phony confessions were the
same kind of evidence given by Rudolf Höss and others at the Nuremberg
trials. Under similar circumstances, Americans proved at least as ready to
&quot;confess&quot; to monstrous but baseless crimes as Germans.88

One of the most important and revealing Nuremberg cases is that of Oswald
Pohl, the wartime head of the vast SS agency (WVHA) that ran the German
concentration camps. After his capture in 1946, he was taken to Nenndorf
where British soldiers tied him to a chair and beat him unconscious. He lost
two teeth in repeated beatings.89 He was then transferred to Nuremberg,
where American military officials intensively interrogated him for more than
half a year in sessions that lasted for hours. Altogether there were about
70 such sessions. During this period he had no access to an attorney or any
other help. He was never formally charged with anything, nor even told
precisely why he was being interrogated.

In a statement written after he was sentenced to death at Nuremberg in
November 1947 by the American military court (&quot;Concentration Camp&quot; Case No.
4), Pohl described his treatment.90 He reported that although he was
generally not physically mistreated in Nuremberg as he had been at Nenndorf,
he was nevertheless subjected to the less noticeable but, as he put it, &quot;in
their own way much more brutal emotional tortures.&quot;

American interrogators (most of them Jews) accused Pohl of killing 30
million people and of condemning ten million people to

Branch in 1946 and 1947, he selected almost all of the judges, prosecutors

Mr. Weber exaggerates. This &quot;confession&quot; was never even entered in
any

has been dealt with many times before. No evidence has been shown

it influenced the testimony he gave at Nuremberg, or later at his own

Hoess maintained no such thing. He clearly stated that these were

He got a date wrong, and incorrectly remembered the name of Sobibor.
Otherwise, the extensive testimony he provided was devastating.

&gt; Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn has cited the case of Jupp Aschenbrenner, a Bavarian
&gt; who was tortured into signing a statement that he
&gt; had worked on mobile gas chambers (&quot;gas vans&quot;) during the war. It wasn't
&gt; until several years later that he was finally able to
&gt; prove that he had actually spent that time in Munich studying to become an
&gt; electric welder. (note 75)

This example has nothing to do with Nuremberg. One wonders why Weber
included it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Fritz Sauckel, head of the German wartime labor mobilization program, was
&gt; sentenced to death at the main Nuremberg trial.
&gt; An important piece of evidence presented to the Tribunal by the US
&gt; prosecution was an affidavit signed by the defendant.
&gt; (Nuremberg document 3057-PS.) It turned out that Sauckel had put his
&gt; signature to this self-incriminating statement, which had
&gt; been presented to him by his captors in finished form, only after he was
&gt; bluntly told that if he hesitated, his wife and children
&gt; would be turned over to the Soviets. &quot;I did not stop to consider, and
&gt; thinking of my family, I signed the document,&quot; Sauckel
&gt; later declared. (note 76)
">

Weber's footnote refers to Sauckel's testimony in which he makes
these
claims. Contrary to Weber's assertion, the affidavit was not an
important piece of evidence, since the Tribunal discounted it based
solely on the defendent's charge. Of course, it is another matter
entirely to assert as fact that which is supported only by the charge
of a defendent on trial for his life. As with most deniers, the
burden
of proof demanded of Holocaust history is high, while that for their
denial is minimal.

&gt; Hans Fritzsche, another defendant in the main Nuremberg trial, was similarly
&gt; forced to sign a self-damning confession while he
&gt; was a prisoner of the Soviet secret police in Moscow. (Nuremberg document
&gt; USSR-474.) (note 77)
">

The footnote refers to Fritzsche's IMT testimony. Nowhere in the
testimony does Fritzsche claim he was tortured or coerced. In fact
what
he said was this:

http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/06-28-46.htm

FRITZSCHE: I gave that signature after very severe solitary
confinement
which had lasted for several months; and I wrote that signature
because
one of my fellow prisoners, with whom I came into contact once, had
told me that once every month a court was pronouncing sentences based
merely on such records and without interrogation; and I hoped that in
this manner I would at least achieve being sentenced and thus
terminate
my confinement.

So as not to be misunderstood I should like to emphasize that no
force
was used and that I was treated very humanely, even if my detention
was
very severe.

(end quote)

Doesn't exactly support Weber's charge that, &quot;Allied prosecutors used
torture to help prove their case at Nuremberg and other postwar
trials.&quot;  One wonders why Weber left out this rather important piece
of
evidence when dealing with Fritzsche's testimony.

By the way, Fritzsche was found not guilty of all charges.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nuremberg defendant Julius Streicher, who was eventually hanged because he
&gt; published a sometimes sensational anti-Jewish
&gt; weekly paper, was brutally mistreated following his arrest. He was badly
&gt; beaten, kicked, whipped, spat at, forced to drink
&gt; saliva and burned with cigarettes. His genitals were beaten. Eyebrow and
&gt; chest hair was pulled out. He was stripped and
&gt; photographed. Fellow defendant Hans Frank was savagely beaten by two black
&gt; GIs shortly after his arrest. August Eigruber,
&gt; former Gauleiter of Upper Austria, was mutilated and castrated at the end of
&gt; the war. (note 78)

The only evidence of torture being used against Streicher is
Streicher's allegation.  Again, Mr. Weber states it as fact on that
basis alone.

&gt; Josef Kramer, former commandant of both the BergenBelsen and
&gt; Auschwitz-Birkenau camps, and other defendants in the
&gt; British-run &quot;Belsen&quot; trial, were reportedly also tortured, some of them so
&gt; brutally that they begged to be put to death. (note 79)

&quot;Reportedly&quot; huh. I'll check this reference when I get a chance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Although most of the defendants at the main Nuremberg trial were not
&gt; tortured, many other Germans were forced to sign
&gt; affidavits and give testimony against their former colleagues and superiors.
&gt; A simple threat to turn the subject over to the
&gt; Soviets was often enough to persuade him to sign an affidavit or provide
&gt; testimony needed in court. Threats against the
&gt; subject's wife and children, including withdrawal of ration cards, delivery
&gt; to the Soviets or imprisonment, often quickly
&gt; produced the desired results. If all else failed, the subject could be placed
&gt; in solitary confinement, beaten, kicked, whipped or
&gt; burned until he broke down. (note 80)
">

No evidence offered for any of this. The footnote refers to judicial
notice being taken of &quot;claims&quot; of threats and duress alleged by some
defendants. Apparently when it comes to denier scholarship, the mere
assertion of a charge is sufficient to accept it as proven.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The testimony of the prosecution's chief witness in the Nuremberg
&gt; &quot;Wilhelmstrasse&quot; trial was obtained by threat of death. The
&gt; American defense attorney, Warren Magee, had somehow obtained the transcript
&gt; of the first pretrial interrogation of Friedrich
&gt; Gaus, a former senior official in the German Foreign Office. Despite frantic
&gt; protests by prosecuting attorney Robert Kempner,
&gt; the judge decided to permit Magee to read from the document. During the
&gt; pretrial interrogation session, Kempner told Gaus
&gt; that he would be turned over to the Soviets for hanging. Tearfully pleading
&gt; for mercy, Gaus begged Kempner to think of his
&gt; wife and children. Kempner replied that he could save himself only by
&gt; testifying in court against his former colleagues. A
&gt; desperate Gaus, who had already endured four weeks in solitary confinement,
&gt; agreed. When Magee finished reading from the
&gt; damning transcript, Gaus sat with both hands to his face, totally devastated.

&gt; American soldiers repeatedly beat former SS captain Konrad Morgen in an
&gt; unsuccessful effort to force him to sign a perjured
&gt; affidavit against Ilse Koch, a defendant in the US military's 1947
&gt; &quot;Buchenwald&quot; case. American officials also threatened to turn
&gt; Morgen over to the Soviets if he did not sign the false statement.

The reference is Toland's Hitler biography. The information is found
in
a footnote. Toland offers no citation for the information, and
provides
no hint where the charge originates, or what evidence supports it.
Hardly the kind of firm evidence on which to base such a bald
assertion
of fact.

&gt; Luftwaffe General Field Marshal Erhard Milch was warned by a US Army Major to

&gt; himself, regardless of whether or not he was guilty. (note 83)

The evidence for this, once again, is Milch's allegation, and nothing
else. Mr. Weber needs little convincing when it fits his preconceived
notions.
