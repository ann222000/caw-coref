Tim,

I carry a complete list of meds, and also hospitalisations with diagnosis
and treatments. Â  I'm going to have to amend it to add this last
hospitalisation, and then i am going to laminate the whole thing.

I found it Grace it was a while back. It was part of her story. I will re-post it for those who have not read it.

Dear friends,

Well.where to begin. Some of you I know quite well, others not well at
all,
and still others know me and I don't know you! I must say, Devic's can
be a
bit pesky in terms of allowing me to stay up to date on my
correspondence.

Fortunately, because many of you receiving this letter already know
that I
am recovering from a recent relapse I'm sure you will be understanding
regarding my dismal communication skills at the moment. In fact, this
letter may be a little interesting as well, considering I am still
under the
influence of countless drugs. Regardless, I am going to make my best
attempt at an update for all of you. Please forgive misspellings,
run-ons
and grammatical mishaps. It is very late and I can't sleep, so now is
as
good a time as any.

Let me begin by saying what many of you already know about me, I tend
to
bite off more than I can chew at times. Thus, I have committed myself
to
purging any feelings of guilt due to my lack of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; powers.
For
some reason I really thought I had them for awhile. What does that mean
you
ask? Well, simply put, it means I am forcing myself to stop stressing
out
and feeling as though I have failed somehow if I don't quite get around
to
everything I had planned on accomplishing and instead focus on what I
am
getting done. So.no, I haven't read anyone's emails yet, I haven't
returned
multiple phone calls, I am behind in my reading for class and I have a
pile
of laundry and paperwork that are rivaling one another in height. Wow!
As
odd as it sounds, it feels really great to share that with you!

Unbeknownst to most, I have secretly escaped LA and am hiding out in a
surreal place called &quot;Bakersfield.&quot; I know what you are all thinking,
&quot;Bakersfield.hmmm.wouldn't have picked that as a paradise set aside for

physical/mental recovery.&quot; Well, you would typically be right, except
for
the fact that I am surrounded by two amazing and loving parents who
whisked
me away early Friday morning, my powerhouse of a sister and
brother-in-law
and four perfect little sprite-like creatures (my nieces and nephews)
who
keep me completely entertained via songs, trampoline tricks, cartoons
and
kisses. I plan on staying at this &quot;Rehab Facility&quot; for about a week,
upon
which I will then return Los Angeles before I turn into either a
pumpkin or
a Republican (he he he, sorry had to slip that one in).

Now then, back to my update. The two questions to be addressed, at
least
they are the ones with which I am most often inundated:

1. Why did I relapse?
Well, I burned the candle at both ends. I was about to celebrate my
three
year anniversary of being relapse-free on April 17 (quick side note:
that
date is now February 11, 2006 and counting). I guess I started taking
my
health for granted, which is extremely regrettable and stupid. At this
point I really should know better. The past few years have been very
exciting for me. I have been blessed with amazing opportunities:
graduate
school, speaking on stem cell research, developing a bit of an acting
career. All of these experiences are wonderful, but clearly life is
about
balance, appreciating and respecting your weaknesses and living each
moment
as it comes. I know this and I preach it, but I guess I forgot to apply
it
to myself. Working several jobs, cramming in homework, managing a
bustling
social calendar, volunteering, attempting to date, etc., etc. is a full

plate for anyone, especially a young lady with two chronic diseases. I
mean
really, what was I thinking.
So, this past Saturday, February 11, 2006 to be exact, I woke up
feeling
numbness in my left foot. I thought maybe it was because I had worn
stilettos the night before. Men; that sounds silly to you, but ladies,
you
are well aware of the havoc a hot pair of shoes can wreak on you feet.
After about a half hour, I was growing anxious. I called my best
friend,
Cara Mae, (I believe some of you may have received an email from her
last
week) and let her know that I needed her to be on high alert for a
possible
relapse.
Hearing those words come out of my mouth were just bizarre. After all,
it
had been almost three years! I just did not see this coming. I was in a

state of disbelief, trying to wander around my bedroom, seeing if
anything
in my leg was changing. Change it most certainly did. The numbness
began
to spread up the front of my left leg and then the right began to
follow.
My left leg was feverish and the right was very cold. For those of you
reading this with Devic's, you know these bizarre symptoms well.
Basically
your body just starts going haywire. At that point, I called Cara Mae
again
and she was on her way to whisk me to the emergency room.
Before I continue with my update, I would like to point out that the
main
reason for all the detail in this particular portion of the story is
because
my emergency plan was put to the test and consequently, proved to work.
I
am what my doctors call, a &quot;Professional Patient.&quot; That means that I
have
educated myself on my disease and have planned my life in such a way
that
Devic's is something I manage, not something that manages me. That
being
said, if any of you do not have your emergency plan in place..DO IT!
Though
I was anxious, I knew that I had to keep functioning before it got to
the
point where I could no longer walk:

1. My ride to the ER was already scheduled with someone who was aware
of my
disease and was committed to be my emergency contact should it be
necessary.

2. I gathered my medical records from my filing cabinet which contain
all of
my physicians / specialists' information and were labeled as such in
manila
folders.

3. In the glove compartment of my car in a waterproof pouch, as well as
in
my file cabinet and with my family is a concise, clearly typed,
understandable breakdown of my disease, my history, my current Rx
regime
and, most importantly, the appropriate emergency treatment procedures
during
relapse. This document was written for me by Dr. Dean Wingerchuck, whom

some of you have had the pleasure of meeting at the Mayo Clinic in
Arizona.
This may sound extreme, but I recently learned that it was one of the
best
precautions I have ever taken.

4. During the car ride over, I called the emergency room to prepare
them
for my arrival. ERs are so busy, they won't even blink at you unless
you
are gushing blood or in the throws of a heart attack. Devic's, of
course,
is an extremely time sensitive disease and I knew I had to somehow
communicate this to the ER so that I would not be abandoned in the
hallway
for hours as I gradually became more paralyzed.
I bet you didn't know that if you call the ER in a very educated and
authoritative manner and demand to speak to the neurologist on call,
you can
get further than you realize. Of course, a few tears don't hurt either.

Regardless, the ER was no picnic. The triage nurse insisted that I was
&quot;a
little anxious and looked fine.&quot; I'm a pacifist for the most part, but
was
close to changing my political stance at that point, had I not been in
a
wheelchair.

5. OK, I made it through the ER, and they finally had some basic
understanding of what my disease was (most doctors have never even
heard of
it. Talk about frustrating!) and I was scheduled to get my IV steroid
treatment soon. Breath, relax, pass out!

6. Being the Professional Patient that I am, I made sure to grab a few
comforts from home while awaiting my ER chariot: My medications (Just
in
case the hospital didn't have them all, which they did not because
there is
no generic drug for my fatigue meds. and they don't see fatigue
medication
as an absolute necessity in the hospital. So again, a good choice). I
also
stashed my teddy bear, cleverly called &quot;Bear,&quot; my cell phone and
charger,
and of course my wallet and health insurance information. I knew I was
going to be in for at least five days, and I was right.
I know the last portion of this letter was a bit dry for many of you,
but it
might be of use for others living with Devic's or any chronic disease
for
that matter. Now, on with the update.
My week in the hospital was filled with beautiful flowers, wonderful
friends and hazy drug induced slumbers. I managed a few walks around
the
hospital corridors and even made it outdoors. IV steroids and the
symptoms
of Devic's are no walk in the park, which is why the sooner you can
catch a
relapse, the better. Fortunately, I caught mine early. I am still
walking
quite well, though at the moment, I look like I am shuffling along like
a
salty old sailor. Everyday will hopefully be a stronger one for me.
With
Devic's, the damage to the myelin sheath is done rapidly and the repair

takes months. So, I don't expect any miracles in the next day or two in

terms of getting the feeling in my legs back and calming the tingling,
buzzing and temperature changes shooting around my body. And yes, the
headaches are bad and the fatigue tests my already present lack of
patience.
The side effects are numerous, but not worth the detail. (Although, if
you're brave you can always ask me to tell you one of my
steroid/vicodin
induced dreams. Just plain weird). The good news: typically, (I mean
when
I am not in relapse) I am a very active young lady and an avid gym
goer. I
lift a substantial amount of weights and do a good deal of cardio,
nearly 5
times a week, if not more. I also pride myself on my prowess as a
dancer
when I venture out with my girlfriends.
I CAN NOT SAY THIS ENOUGH! The key to successfully managing Devic's is
how
you treat your body prior to a relapse. If you keep it strong,
muscular,
lean, heart-healthy and free of too many pollutants (we all have some
