Synvisc, Orthovisc experience?

Saw my orthopedist today.  Both of my knees have been hurting for
about six months.  One knee started hurting about a year ago.
Diagnosed with chondromalasia and mild wearing of meniscus.  At first
only the one knee hurt, and only when I sat down, stood up or used
stairs.  Now it aches any time I'm on my feet.  Same with other knee.
I cannot take any of the NSAIDS - makes my stomach hurt too much.

My ortho said he was sure the problem was that the cartiladge was
wearing out.  He suggested I have shots of Synvisc or Orthovisc.  Not
sure which he uses.  It sounded good to me.  I also have a very
serious back condition which makes surgery out of the question.

He didn't think my knees were very bad.  It doesn't hurt to bend or
twist them when I'm sitting.

Have any of you had good luck with these shots?  I've read the blurb
on the pharmacy web sites.  If they work is it really OK to keep
getting them every 6 months?

I've been in constant pain from my back for five years.  This knee
pain has depressed my more than I can say.  I'm praying this will
help.  Even some relief will make me happy.  Right now just walking
around the store is a big deal and by the end of the day I can't wait
to go to bed.

Hi Jane,
I've been getting Synvisc shots for 4 years now. One knee gets them
every 18 months and the other every 8-10 months.  For me, Synvisc
works better then Othrovisc.  Ymmv of course.   The idea is to replace
the synovial fluid in the knee and protect the damaged cartiledge,
which reduces the pain.  If you haven't had the shots before it might
take a few weeks before you notice an improvement, esp if you
currently have alot of inflamation, but you will notice an improvement
sooner with each following set of shots.  These days I feel a
difference within 48 hours of the first treatment.

I want to be honest here - the literature makes the shots sound as
easy as licking a stamp.   Everyone is different and getting an
injection under the kneecap can range from extremely easy to extremely
queasy.  For the first and second series of shots, I do recommend
using an icepack, combined with a local freezing before the Syvisc
shot.  Again, this is personal and should be discussed with your
doctor.

Are the shots fun? No. Would I recommend them?  Absolutely. They won't
get rid of every ache but it's a small trade for increased mobility.
And sleeping though the night, waking up rested, which will help your
mood so you can go to physio and rebuild muscles, which helps you feel
better, which helps your mood so you can go for a short walk.........

hth
Cinnamin.

I've had different versions of them for the last three years, mostly in my
left knee which causes me the problems.  They are great.  The last one was
Supartz - most of the difference is the manufacturer.  Try to get the doctor
to use some lidocaine befor he/she puts the Synvisc or equivalent in.  Ice
when you get home fifteen minutes on, and fifteen minutes off.  I had
improvement almost immediately.  The last series of shots were fine until I
got the last one.  The doctor found out I had bursitis and after she shot
that with a steroid, I have felt great ever since.  Mine usually last about
18 months or so.  Good luck.

Thanks.  I had my first shot yesterday with Orthovisc.  He did use
Lidocaine first.  In fact he sprayed my knee with something to freeze
the skin and then the Lidocaine.  The shots hurt a little, but not too
much.

I was wondering if I should ice it.  I forgot to ask doctor.

My knees are already feeling a little better.  Can I expect them to
improve a little more with each shot?

Yes, if I remember rightly.  The doctor told me not to expect complete
relief for a couple of weeks after the last shot.

I plan on starting my shots soon. My dr says he'll also inject a small
amount of steroid along with the first shot to help things along.

Looks like I was a bit too optimistic when I thought my knees felt
better.  Probably was the Lidocaine lasting longer than I expected.

Anyway - I'll be getting my second Orthovisc shots this week and third
the next.  If it allows me to take a short walk with my husband and
stand for more than five minutes without wanting to cry it will be
more than worth it.

The shots weren't as bad as I had expected.  Didn't really matter
though.  If it helps a few seconds of pain is more than worth it.

That's the spirit!  It is worth it and your knees will hopefully start
feeling better soon,  usually right after you realize you did
something you haven't done in awhile lol!

Just had my second round of shots.  Haven't noticed much difference
yet.  I know I shouldn't, but I'm getting discouraged.

The main problem is I cannot have surgery.  I have a VERY bad back
problem.  I've had it for five years and there is no prospect that it
will ever get better.  For one thing I cannot sit.  I can recline in a
special chair for about 15 minutes but then I have to either get up
for a while or lie down.  I spend a lot of time lying down.  Also, any
major change in the way I walk would put my back into spasms for
sure.  Finally I would not be able to do the PT necessary to
strengthen my knees.  I've already had PT for chondromalasia.  There
wasn't much they could do that did not make my back worse.

So I'm very nervous about these shots not working.  My ortho did
mention cortisone if these don't work but I  know you can't take those
kind of shots for years.

Are there any minimally invasive cartilage replacement surgeries?

Hi Jane,,,,,  It makes me hurt to just read how it is with you.  Nothing can
be done for your back??  Nothing can be done for your knees because of your
back??  Please tell me why you can't take a cortisone shot and the time line
is for years??   Everything seems to be tied up around your back.   I  just
wanted to tell you that you are prayed for today and I pray that answers can
be found and may God give you the courage to act on things that will make
your life better,,,, we all need that.

Thank you Harv.

I can take a cortisone shot but as I understand it they are not shots
you can continue to take for any length of time without causing
further damage.  Maybe I'm wrong??

you can take 3 - 4 cortisone shots per year per joint in most doctor's
opinions.  That might stave off some of the pain.

No minimally invasive cartilae replacement surgeries that I know of but I am
not an expert on that.  Someone should be around to help with that.

In a way,  The size of the shot and how many times a year a person uses it
to make life better.   Do you want to live the rest of your life this way?
Talk with your RD about can be done.   I have a good friend that has had 3
major operations on his neck and lower back.    All very successful and if
he would just stop having accidents in his car,,,, his doctor would say this
job is done.
