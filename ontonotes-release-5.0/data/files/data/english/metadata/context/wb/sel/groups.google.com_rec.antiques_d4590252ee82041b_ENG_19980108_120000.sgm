If ANYONE is even THINKING of doing business with
such an agency, check the web first. In fact, a simple
search on AltaVista or Yahoo will bring up much interesting
info on Woodside.

"/> Great catch, Kris-
Hope everyone reads all of this and sees that spammers can be much more than
just annoying jerks looking for a cheap way to lure suckers to look at the
trash they're peddling. Sadly, they're like roaches; for every one you actually
see, there are thousands more hiding nearby.

"/> Thanks, Charley -
Actually, this is a long-term situation I've been following
on Prodigy - so it wasn't so much a &quot;great catch&quot; as a
&quot;ka-ching&quot;&lt;g&gt;

"/> aka Woodside Literary Agency

For immediate release from the Jayne Hitchcock H.E.L.P. Fund:

The New York State Attorney General's Office announced on Nov. 27th
they filed charges against The Woodside Literary Agency, et al
(available at  http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/nov97/nov27_97.html .
The case includes charges of fraud, deceptive business practices and
false advertising based on &quot;Woodside's&quot; operation of a Literary agency
as well as their harassment of Jayne Hitchcock. This &quot;agency&quot;
allegedly charged would-be writers &quot;reading and other fees&quot; amounting
to hundreds of dollars, then failed to present the writers work to any
publisher for potential sale-- they essentially collected fees while
failing to perform any representative services.
