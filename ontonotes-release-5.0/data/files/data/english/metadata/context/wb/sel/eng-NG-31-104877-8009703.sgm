The facts are that Lynne &quot;Ms Mouse&quot; Kositsky initiated reverse sexual
harassment in May by inserting a limerick that inappropriately and
with malice made reference to my sexual privacy, in a non-hyperbolic
and therefore meant to be serious way. This initiated a chain of posts
in which I repeatedly had to ask Lynne &quot;Ms. Mouse&quot; Kositsky to remove
the post. In what I took to be an implicit admission that she was at
fault, but without explicitly admitting fault, this poster withdrew
the post in another post that discourtesly objectified me by speaking
of me to others in the third person. She did not apologise per se,
instead posed as a person whose delicacy of feeling is such that she
cannot hurt another, even if he's a crazy man who should take sexual
harassment like a man, and suck it up.

However, I accepted this as an implicit admission of some wrongdoing
and accepted it. I undertook at that point, to spare Ms. Mouse further
stress and myself a waste of time and my own stress, not to post
anymore on Google Groups, and I confirmed this decision in a moderated
post on my moderated blog site, developerdotstar.

However, when I followed up this month, I discovered posters,
including Ms. Mouse, replicating what I believe to be a lie, and this
was that I was &quot;banned&quot; from Google. Her participation was a message
&quot;look at his [my] profile&quot; posted June 9th, implying that at that
date, I was marked as banned, although this is not Google practice to
the best of my knowledge, and, I received no notice from Google
concerning a ban. This week she compounded the lie by denying the
clear import of what she had said.

Encouraged by messages from some posters, I decided to return to set
the record straight by replying to posters including Bob Grumman who
were claiming that I had been permanently banned. I decided that I was
ready to return to constructive criticism of the weird practice, here,
of &quot;Shakespeare denial&quot; and explicating its social-psychological
roots.

Since Lynne &quot;Ms Mouse&quot; Kositsky initiated a hate-fueled mob action in
May with an inappropriate, off-topic, malicious and non-hyperbolic
reference to my sexual privacy, I conclude that she is not here the
victim of harassment.

One example of &quot;harassment&quot; about which she has complained was the use
of her name. However, this was outed by her last April in describing
her authorship activities, and she certainly had no compunction
whatsover in using my unprefixed patronymic in the sexually harassing
post, which potentially at least brought shame and embarassment on all
members of my extended family, including minor children.

Her behavior, and that of other posters who self-identify as female,
indicates that they unfairly discriminate between the sexual rights of
a male poster versus those of a female poster. The sympathy expressed
here for Elizabeth, and the rather knee-jerk description of my conduct
as in any way &quot;harassment&quot;, indicates that the unwritten rules are
that &quot;a male poster's sexual privacy is of considerably less value
than that of a female poster&quot;, &quot;the name including patronymic of a
female poster may not be used, to spare her the consequences of
surveillance EVEN WHEN she without compunction uses the broadest
possible name, the patronymic, in a context of malicious sexual
harassment&quot;, and that in general women have delicate feelings, whereas
men, like black men in the age of Dred Scott, have no rights a woman
may respect.

Indeed, Ms. Mouse's behavior directly fostered a climate of
metaphorical &quot;Uncle Tomming&quot; in which male posters, anxious themselves
to avoid the vicious and soul-destroying bullying meted out with a
nasty sexual undertone from the self-appointed thought leaders of this
community (including Messrs. Kennedy and Farey), join an electronic
Lynch mob, resulting in a cybernetic hounding which caused me
considerable time, and stress.

I am however encouraged by this putative pledge, because I entered
this newsgroup in January of this year to exchange information and
opinion concerning the teaching of Shakespeare, one of my educational
tasks. I was almost immediately sprayed with a foul and toxic brew of
bullying and the discredited &quot;opinion&quot; that despite the documentary
record, Shakespeare didn't write the corpus, an opinion without
certiorari amongst professional Shakespeare scholars.

I went to work, and I appear to have cleansed this group of a poster,
one Mark Houlsby, who was according to most others using the ng to
harass and &quot;troll&quot; (their word, not mine: I have found that word
problematic) by confronting Houlsby without the usual cowardice
evinced by most posters. My reward? To be classed by people who don't
read posts for the most part, and for this reason are ignorant on the
facts, with Houlsby.

I was surprised to discover that despite the high levels of mob
action, Lynch law, and bullying on technical groups, this behavior
here was far more egregious, and I also was shocked to discover that
the self-appointed thought leaders of this group, including Kositsky,
Kennedy, and Farey, actually had considerable theater and scholarly
chops. Although in most cases the self-appointed thought leaders
necessarily showed even in their professional views elements of
professional pathology (such as Shakespeare denial in Ms. Mouse's
case), most of their views and thoughts on high culture seemed to
betray the ability to appreciate high culture.

However, I've also come to believe that Fascism works this way.
Members of elites and thought leaders learn to selectively brutalize
parts of their personality in response to Fascist pressures in
society, and to seek out evidence of a vulnerability or enthusiasm
coded as retrograde by a culture which, far from being Fascist,
celebrates a Bohemian or &quot;alternative&quot; style.

Strategic and goal-seeking brutality emerges in such a surprising way
and in such pear-shaped tones that it's dangerous not to analyze this
phenomenon. It is hard to distinguish from hyperbolic satire and
mockery, so over the top as to be meant in jest, and one discovers,
often after the fact, that the brutality was there for a purpose.

Indeed, the thought leader is using the newsgroup to further
professional ends and can be expected for this reason to be
strategically brutal and to make jokes with a purpose, not as any kind
of Happy Warrior.

I'm going to stay here until this shit stops. I'm going to post until
the thought leaders, working in part through their Brownshirts, cease
using this ng as their own personal fiefdom in which they can inflate
what seem to be distinctly provincial accomplishment into something
more, by abusing Michael, Phil Innes, myself, and indeed any entrant
who enters here thinking that this ng is for the discussion of
Shakespeare in a collegial atmosphere.

Shakespeare denial, in and of itself, as a central theme of this ng,
is used to exclude the work of scholars since 1708 and Nicholas Rowe
as at best the work of naifs, and at worst a &quot;conspiracy so immense&quot;
and it sends a message to the outside real world that this ng isn't
for discussing &quot;Shakespeare&quot; at all, and that the lonely and isolated
&quot;Shakespeare nerd&quot; best keep the fuck out of this sinister compound,
decorated as it is with skulls. It's for DENYING Shakespeare with
superficial and unprofessional sourcing so as to have the cake and eat
it to, to destroy a zone of &quot;alles schon undt gute&quot;, to remind men
that they are scum without rights that women need respect, and to trip
up, undercut, harass, tease and bully anyone who doesn't defer, toady,
and kow-tow to, flatter, inflate, congratulate and in general suck off
the dogs obeyed in office.

&quot;The great image of Authority&quot; in other word looms over this group.
When actual creativity occurs *ex nihilo* and from either a newbie, or
a person with an inner motor like Innes or like Michael, is used to
place these people, like Kent, into the stocks and if necessary the
eye gouging starts.

The modal personality knows exactly where his bread is buttered and is
Oswald in Lear who smirks at Kent, knowing that within a diseased
community, a serving man can be superior to a duke in disgrace and in
hiding. Don't bother reading the Histree plays, they don't have to be
your fortay. Stumble on a line from Sonnet 129, misrecognize it, and
then tell people you knew it all along. Mock a compound sentence as
ungrammatical.

If this doesn't work, you can ascend to the register of moral advice-
giving, and preach to people about being a &quot;mensch&quot;, even as Israel
tells the increasingly diminished crowd of people who believe them
that it represents justice and mercy and Tikkun...while children
starve on the Gaza strip as Israel gangs up with its former enemies to
confront, not a superior power, not the Assyrians, but starving
children and their stone-throwing older siblings. The hypocrisy in
both registers is world-historical and gives a whole new meaning to
*chutzpah*.

A fundamental, and pre-Abrahamite, crime is committed, because default
assumption of good faith, in a word hospitality, is missing. Hamlet
encouraged Horatio, when Horatio thought the Ghost strange, to &quot;as a
stranger give it welcome&quot;. But increasingly today, people in the
developed world, terrorised by their governments' use of terrorism to
marshal loyalty, conclude from any outlier phenomenon that they are
under threat, and they reason from an inflated sense of self-
importance that it's better safe to be sorry, and tease,

&gt; &gt; than that of a female poster&quot;, &quot;the name including patronymic of a
&gt; &gt; female poster may not be used, to spare her the consequences of
&gt; &gt; surveillance EVEN WHEN she without compunction uses the broadest
&gt; &gt; possible name, the patronymic, in a context of malicious sexual
&gt; &gt; harassment&quot;, and that in general women have delicate feelings, whereas
&gt; &gt; men, like black men in the age of Dred Scott, have no rights a woman
&gt; &gt; may respect.

&gt; &gt; Indeed, Ms. Mouse's behavior directly fostered a climate of
&gt; &gt; metaphorical &quot;Uncle Tomming&quot; in which male posters, anxious themselves
&gt; &gt; to avoid the vicious and soul-destroying bullying meted out with a
&gt; &gt; nasty sexual undertone from the self-appointed thought leaders of this
&gt; &gt; community (including Messrs. Kennedy and Farey), join an electronic
&gt; &gt; Lynch mob, resulting in a cybernetic hounding which caused me
&gt; &gt; considerable time, and stress.

&gt; &gt; I am however encouraged by this putative pledge, because I entered
&gt; &gt; this newsgroup in January of this year to exchange information and
&gt; &gt; opinion concerning the teaching of Shakespeare, one of my educational
&gt; &gt; tasks. I was almost immediately sprayed with a foul and toxic brew of
&gt; &gt; bullying and the discredited &quot;opinion&quot; that despite the documentary
&gt; &gt; record, Shakespeare didn't write the corpus, an opinion without
&gt; &gt; certiorari amongst professional Shakespeare scholars.

&gt; &gt; I went to work, and I appear to have cleansed this group of a poster,
&gt; &gt; one Mark Houlsby, who was according to most others using the ng to
&gt; &gt; harass and &quot;troll&quot; (their word, not mine: I have found that word
&gt; &gt; problematic) by confronting Houlsby without the usual cowardice
&gt; &gt; evinced by most posters. My reward? To be classed by people who don't
&gt; &gt; read posts for the most part, and for this reason are ignorant on the
&gt; &gt; facts, with Houlsby.

&gt; &gt; I was surprised to discover that despite the high levels of mob
&gt; &gt; action, Lynch law, and bullying on technical groups, this behavior
&gt; &gt; here was far more egregious, and I also was shocked to discover that
&gt; &gt; the self-appointed thought leaders of this group, including Kositsky,
&gt; &gt; Kennedy, and Farey, actually had considerable theater and scholarly
&gt; &gt; chops. Although in most cases the self-appointed thought leaders
&gt; &gt; necessarily showed even in their professional views elements of
&gt; &gt; professional pathology (such as Shakespeare denial in Ms. Mouse's
&gt; &gt; case), most of their views and thoughts on high culture seemed to
&gt; &gt; betray the ability to appreciate high culture.

&gt; &gt; However, I've also come to believe that Fascism works this way.
&gt; &gt; Members of elites and thought leaders learn to selectively brutalize
&gt; &gt; parts of their personality in response to Fascist pressures in
&gt; &gt; society, and to seek out evidence of a vulnerability or enthusiasm
&gt; &gt; coded as retrograde by a culture which, far from being Fascist,
&gt; &gt; celebrates a Bohemian or &quot;alternative&quot; style.

&gt; &gt; Strategic and goal-seeking brutality emerges in such a surprising way
&gt; &gt; and in such pear-shaped tones that it's dangerous not to analyze this
&gt; &gt; phenomenon. It is hard to distinguish from hyperbolic satire and
&gt; &gt; mockery, so over the top as to be meant in jest, and one discovers,
&gt; &gt; often after the fact, that the brutality was there for a purpose.

&gt; &gt; Indeed, the thought leader is using the newsgroup to further
&gt; &gt; professional ends and can be expected for this reason to be
&gt; &gt; strategically brutal and to make jokes with a purpose, not as any kind
&gt; &gt; of Happy Warrior.

&gt; &gt; I'm going to stay here until this shit stops. I'm going to post until
&gt; &gt; the thought leaders, working in part through their Brownshirts, cease
&gt; &gt; using this ng as their own personal fiefdom in which they can inflate
&gt; &gt; what seem to be distinctly provincial accomplishment into something
&gt; &gt; more, by abusing Michael, Phil Innes, myself, and indeed any entrant
&gt; &gt; who enters here thinking that this ng is for the discussion of
&gt; &gt; Shakespeare in a collegial atmosphere.

&gt; &gt; Shakespeare denial, in and of itself, as a central theme of this ng,
&gt; &gt; is used to exclude the work of scholars since 1708 and Nicholas Rowe
&gt; &gt; as at best the work of naifs, and at worst a &quot;conspiracy so immense&quot;
&gt; &gt; and it sends a message to the outside real world that this ng isn't
&gt; &gt; for discussing &quot;Shakespeare&quot; at all, and that the lonely and isolated
&gt; &gt; &quot;Shakespeare nerd&quot; best keep the fuck out of this sinister compound,
&gt; &gt; decorated as it is with skulls. It's for DENYING Shakespeare with
&gt; &gt; superficial and unprofessional sourcing so as to have the cake and eat
&gt; &gt; it to, to destroy a zone of &quot;alles schon undt gute&quot;, to remind men
&gt; &gt; that they are scum without rights that women need respect, and to trip
&gt; &gt; up, undercut, harass, tease and bully anyone who doesn't defer, toady,
&gt; &gt; and kow-tow to, flatter, inflate, congratulate and in general suck off
&gt; &gt; the dogs obeyed in office.

&gt; &gt; &quot;The great image of Authority&quot; in other word looms over this group.
&gt; &gt; When actual creativity occurs *ex nihilo* and from either a newbie, or
&gt; &gt; a person with an inner motor like Innes or like Michael, is used to
&gt; &gt; place these people, like Kent, into the stocks and if necessary the
&gt; &gt; eye gouging starts.

&gt; &gt; The modal personality knows exactly where his bread is buttered and is
&gt; &gt; Oswald in Lear who smirks at Kent, knowing that within a diseased
&gt; &gt; community, a serving man can be superior to a duke in disgrace and in
&gt; &gt; hiding. Don't bother reading the Histree plays, they don't have to be
&gt; &gt; your fortay. Stumble on a line from Sonnet 129, misrecognize it, and
&gt; &gt; then tell people you knew it all along. Mock a compound sentence as
&gt; &gt; ungrammatical.

&gt; &gt; If this doesn't work, you can ascend to the register of moral advice-
&gt; &gt; giving, and preach to people about being a &quot;mensch&quot;, even as Israel
&gt; &gt; tells the increasingly diminished crowd of people who believe them
&gt; &gt; that it represents justice and mercy and Tikkun...while children

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I write:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you, because you are clearly being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harassed in this forum and it really hurts me
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to see it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The facts are that Lynne &quot;Ms Mouse&quot; Kositsky initiated reverse sexual
&gt; &gt; &gt; harassment in May by inserting a limerick that inappropriately and
&gt; &gt; &gt; with malice made reference to my sexual privacy, in a non-hyperbolic
&gt; &gt; &gt; and therefore meant to be serious way. This initiated a chain of posts
&gt; &gt; &gt; in which I repeatedly had to ask Lynne &quot;Ms. Mouse&quot; Kositsky to remove
&gt; &gt; &gt; the post. In what I took to be an implicit admission that she was at
&gt; &gt; &gt; fault, but without explicitly admitting fault, this poster withdrew
&gt; &gt; &gt; the post in another post that discourtesly objectified me by speaking
&gt; &gt; &gt; of me to others in the third person. She did not apologise per se,
&gt; &gt; &gt; instead posed as a person whose delicacy of feeling is such that she
&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot hurt another, even if he's a crazy man who should take sexual
&gt; &gt; &gt; harassment like a man, and suck it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I accepted this as an implicit admission of some wrongdoing
&gt; &gt; &gt; and accepted it. I undertook at that point, to spare Ms. Mouse further
&gt; &gt; &gt; stress and myself a waste of time and my own stress, not to post
&gt; &gt; &gt; anymore on Google Groups, and I confirmed this decision in a moderated
&gt; &gt; &gt; post on my moderated blog site, developerdotstar.

&gt; &gt; &gt; However, when I followed up this month, I discovered posters,
&gt; &gt; &gt; including Ms. Mouse, replicating what I believe to be a lie, and this
&gt; &gt; &gt; was that I was &quot;banned&quot; from Google. Her participation was a message
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;look at his [my] profile&quot; posted June 9th, implying that at that
&gt; &gt; &gt; date, I was marked as banned, although this is not Google practice to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the best of my knowledge, and, I received no notice from Google
&gt; &gt; &gt; concerning a ban. This week she compounded the lie by denying the
&gt; &gt; &gt; clear import of what she had said.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Encouraged by messages from some posters, I decided to return to set
&gt; &gt; &gt; the record straight by replying to posters including Bob Grumman who
&gt; &gt; &gt; were claiming that I had been permanently banned. I decided that I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; ready to return to constructive criticism of the weird practice, here,
&gt; &gt; &gt; of &quot;Shakespeare denial&quot; and explicating its social-psychological
&gt; &gt; &gt; roots.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Since Lynne &quot;Ms Mouse&quot; Kositsky initiated a hate-fueled mob action in
&gt; &gt; &gt; May with an inappropriate, off-topic, malicious and non-hyperbolic
&gt; &gt; &gt; reference to my sexual privacy, I conclude that she is not here the
&gt; &gt; &gt; victim of harassment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; One example of &quot;harassment&quot; about which she has complained was the use
&gt; &gt; &gt; of her name. However, this was outed by her last April in describing
&gt; &gt; &gt; her authorship activities, and she certainly had no compunction
&gt; &gt; &gt; whatsover in using my unprefixed patronymic in the sexually harassing
&gt; &gt; &gt; post, which potentially at least brought shame and embarassment on all
&gt; &gt; &gt; members of my extended family, including minor children.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Her behavior, and that of other posters who self-identify as female,
&gt; &gt; &gt; indicates that they unfairly discriminate between the sexual rights of
&gt; &gt; &gt; a male poster versus those of a female poster. The sympathy expressed
&gt; &gt; &gt; here for Elizabeth, and the rather knee-jerk description of my conduct
&gt; &gt; &gt; as in any way &quot;harassment&quot;, indicates that the unwritten rules are
&gt; &gt; &gt; that &quot;a male poster's sexual privacy is of considerably less value
&gt; &gt; &gt; than that of a female poster&quot;, &quot;the name including patronymic of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; female poster may not be used, to spare her the consequences of
&gt; &gt; &gt; surveillance EVEN WHEN she without compunction uses the broadest
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible name, the patronymic, in a context of malicious sexual
&gt; &gt; &gt; harassment&quot;, and that in general women have delicate feelings, whereas
&gt; &gt; &gt; men, like black men in the age of Dred Scott, have no rights a woman
&gt; &gt; &gt; may respect.

Dear Michael,

Again, thank you for your suggestion that we let bygones be bygones. I
think it was a good and courageous thing for you to suggest.

Please note that on May 31 I said the following:

&quot;I withdraw my remark in the limerick, have removed the offending
post, and ask [Spinoza's] pardon. I see this as a position of
strength, not weakness, as there always has to be someone capable of
making the first move, and I hope he understands it as such.&quot;

I did this without asking for a reciprocal apology despite the fact
that he had compared me and my beliefs--which I hardly speak of here--
to Hitler, to Nazis, to Cho the murderer, etc. before I ever posted
the limerick, and used insulting, crude, and defamatory language
against me and others. He had absolutely refused to stop, despite the
fact that I said on several occasions that I was Jewish and found the
comparisons to Nazis and Holocaust Deniers very painful. That is what
prompted my posting the limerick in the first place. But I am a
forgiving and (usually) peaceful person, and  was willing to do just
about anything to stop the arguing.

Spinoza replied:

&quot;Thank you for your somewhat gracious apology. In return, I am going
to
leave this newsgroup and usenet permanently, neither lurking nor
posting after I send this message.&quot;

If you'll read his last post in answer to yours--I only read the
beginning of it--he is apparently now

1. back and in fine fettle
2. demanding I apologise all over again for the same action,

which means his promises and his forgiveness mean nothing. If I
apologise a second time--and what is the point after I've already done
so--who's to say he won't be back in a month castigating me in the
most vicious terms and demanding an apology all over again?

By the way, while I'm explaining, I should reiterate that it was not I
who said he was banned. Several others told me it was in his profile,
and when Bob asked, I pointed out where he could find the information
rather than saying anything myself. That way there was no chance of
people thinking I had made up a story. Unlike some, I made no further
comment nor spoke about Spinoza at any other time, and yet it is I he
is now abusing again. If he has a problem with what Bob, many others
and I could clearly read, he should take it up with Google, not get
angry with me.

I hope you now understand (if you have any humanity, and I believe you
do) that though I wish for peace and quiet, especially as my health is
so frail, the situation is hopeless. I prefer to speak no more about
it. I am here to discuss the plays and poems.

Best wishes,
Lynne

Oh yes, there it is, the word &quot;pardon&quot;. But in the third person. In a
post, which never admitted wrong.

This was then followed by her participation in the lie that I'd been
banned, so, times have changed. The &quot;apology&quot; was insincere if you

This would be an admission of malice, I'm afraid.  I hadn't &quot;called&quot;
you a &quot;Nazi&quot;. I said that people evinced Fascist and authoritarian
tendencies when they found it necessary to deny Shakespeare, because
it allows them to become false &quot;authorities&quot; and replace real academic
authorities, who are implicitly exposed as a consipracy. Therefore,
you weren't being humorous in the limerick but attending to do harm in

I'd refrain, if your health is as you say &quot;frail&quot; from the give and
take here. However, I suspect this is more manipulation where you say
one or two extremely harmful things, from a limerick to &quot;look at his
profile&quot;, and then sit back and allow the male posters to Uncle Tom by
piling on the person you dislike because he &quot;called&quot; you a &quot;Nazi&quot;,
which of course I didn't.

Men and women have equal rights here. If I had posted a reference to
your private sexual attributes and concerns, I would have rightfully
been called to account. Likewise, we all have our health problems and
are responsible for using this network responsibly. If we feel
stressed out, we have the option of not replying, an option which I
took in May.

Posing as the &quot;weak and feeble woman&quot; is really beneath contempt, for
apparently when you composed the limerick, you were in what can only
be termed rude good health, whereas I MIGHT have been at death's door
owing to dick dropoff cancer or something like that. I wasn't, but you
exercised no caution in doing so, whereas in the posts I &quot;called&quot; you
a &quot;Nazi&quot; I was very careful to qualify what it was I meant by
references to sources including T. W. Adorno's &quot;The Authoritarian
Personality&quot;, Hannah Arendt's &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot;, and
William Shirers &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;.

I'd shown how these sources indicated how Fascism in its incubation
stage is wedded to revisionary causes without certiorari amongs actual
scholars, and how prototype Fascist intellectuals explain this lack by
formulating conspiracy theories which necessarily charge the scholar
with standing of having his position in a corrupt fashion. I made
reference to sources which find the genesis of Fascism not at the top
or the working class but in some measure amongst embittered poetasters
and writers-for-hire who at one and the same time need the status and
authority of *Kultur* while nursing considerable resentment against
the way in which Kultur, in the form of nonpayment for intellectual
product, turns against them, not in the world of *alles schon undt
gute* which is just out of reach as in the torments of Tantalus, but
in the real world of editors, money, and checks.

You reduced this, narcissistically, to &quot;calling&quot; you a &quot;Nazi&quot;, and
your response was sexual harassment, followed, in June, by snide
participation in a lie about my standing.

Here you are in denial about the consequences of your actions.

And since we don't know what is Truth anymore, since any number of
documents might seem to indicate that The Earl of Oxford could write
actable plays and that whales speak French at the bottom of the sea,
all that is left for us is to cry that we are the real victims-of-the-
victim, who is bothering us.

No, you prefer to deny the existence of Shakespeare as an inconvenient
real person and in effect steal his achievement through denial. Then
you kick back and watch &quot;politically incorrect&quot; reality TV which
confirms you in your false belief that the group knows more than the
individual.

&gt; Dear Michael,

&gt; Again, thank you for your suggestion that we let bygones be bygones. I
&gt; think it was a good and courageous thing for you to suggest.

&gt; Please note that on May 31 I said the following:

&gt; &quot;I withdraw my remark in the limerick, have removed the offending
&gt; post, and ask [Spinoza's] pardon. I see this as a position of
&gt; strength, not weakness, as there always has to be someone capable of
&gt; making the first move, and I hope he understands it as such.&quot;

&gt; I did this without asking for a reciprocal apology despite the fact
&gt; that he had compared me and my beliefs--which I hardly speak of here--
&gt; to Hitler, to Nazis, to Cho the murderer, etc. before I ever posted
&gt; the limerick, and used insulting, crude, and defamatory language
&gt; against me and others. He had absolutely refused to stop, despite the
&gt; fact that I said on several occasions that I was Jewish and found the
&gt; comparisons to Nazis and Holocaust Deniers very painful. That is what
&gt; prompted my posting the limerick in the first place. But I am a
&gt; forgiving and (usually) peaceful person, and  was willing to do just
&gt; about anything to stop the arguing.

&gt; Spinoza replied:

&gt; &quot;Thank you for your somewhat gracious apology. In return, I am going
&gt; to
&gt; leave this newsgroup and usenet permanently, neither lurking nor
&gt; posting after I send this message.&quot;

&gt; If you'll read his last post in answer to yours--I only read the
&gt; beginning of it--he is apparently now

&gt; 1. back and in fine fettle
&gt; 2. demanding I apologise all over again for the same action,

&gt; which means his promises and his forgiveness mean nothing. If I
&gt; apologise a second time--and what is the point after I've already done
&gt; so--who's to say he won't be back in a month castigating me in the
&gt; most vicious terms and demanding an apology all over again?

&gt; By the way, while I'm explaining, I should reiterate that it was not I
&gt; who said he was banned. Several others told me it was in his profile,
&gt; and when Bob asked, I pointed out where he could find the information

&gt; people thinking I had made up a story. Unlike some, I made no further
&gt; comment nor spoke about Spinoza at any other time, and yet it is I he
&gt; is now abusing again. If he has a problem with what Bob, many others
&gt; and I could clearly read, he should take it up with Google, not get
&gt; angry with me.

What sort of peace and quiet have you left me? I can't post here

Key/buzz words, tone and rhetoric are important. However, overemphasis
on this type of reading blinds the soul to content. Ms. Mouse is
evading the central talking points:

(1) Isn't it the same evil for a woman here to refer to the private
parts of a man as it would be for a man to refer to the private parts
of a woman in this forum?

(2) Was it not a lie, fostered in part by Ms Mouse following posts
that seemed concilatory, for her to say &quot;look at his profile&quot; on June
9 when, as far as I know, my profile did not indicate a ban?

No, I guess I'm not ready to meet Mouse halfway and to count out
change in some sort of bargain. For someone so targeted so globally
this would be a dumb thing to do, for my willingness to compromise is
willingness to depart from the principles expressed in the above
talking points (don't sexually harass people where context and
hyperbole has to be accounted for, don't lie or risk lying when you
think something negative has occured to someone else, something
discreditable...especially after issuing in May, honey'd words which
seemed at the time, to express a resolution to change behavior).

It's my impression that some persons
get a kind of perverse erotic gratification by
talking about their genitals, inducing others
to talk about their genitals and then taking that opportunity to
complain about others talking about their genitals ad infinitum. The
only way to stop is to just stop.  It feels somehow inhumane to shun
people but try being on the receiving end of over four hundred posts
on a certain English peer's dress.  Sooner or later you run out of

Here's to women, cards, and dice
Blue-balled bastards, syph, and lice
I've had them all, once or twice
Lift up your skirt and I'll take a slice

Born in a whorehouse and raised in a cave
Fucking and fighting is all that i crave
When I get older I'll marry a cow
Someone I can fuck, suck, milk, and plow

Cheers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's my impression that some persons
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get a kind of perverse erotic gratification by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking about their genitals,

&gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; I don't know if Ms. Kositsky was challenging Spinoza's machismo?  I
&gt; &gt; guess if you claim to be the Alpha Male, you'd better be ready to
&gt; &gt; unzip your pants and prove it.  LOL

&gt; &gt; inducing others

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk about their genitals and then taking that opportunity to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complain about others talking about their genitals ad infinitum.

&gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; Ms. Kositsky dangled the bait.  Spinoza took it, hook, line, and
&gt; &gt; sinker.  Now he's telling us that his penis is a good one.  LOL  I
&gt; &gt; don't know if he's mentioned the length of it, but he did mention that
&gt; &gt; he's fathered a couple of children.  Maybe Ms. Kositsky was just
&gt; &gt; challenging the Alpha Male?  Maybe Spinoza took it way too seriously?
&gt; &gt; Spinoza sort of asked for just such a challenge, IMO.  Since Spinoza
&gt; &gt; claims to be the Alpha Male, I don't know what a woman might think,
&gt; &gt; but I can just imagine.  I'm not about to say what Ms. Kositsky might
&gt; &gt; have been thinking.  I believe she is married, too, so she can write
&gt; &gt; what she was thinking.

Tomcats around here are always fighting each other to have the
females.  They look like they've been through hell with bite wounds
and scratches, yet they keep on fighting for lust's sake.  I hope HLAS
doesn't descend to that level.  I mean if Spinoza gets all the girls,
then what will we do?  LOL

That reminds me of something I saw on tv in England years and years
ago. A council notice stated that there would to be &quot;a pubic erection
on this site.&quot;

That was rather like the gaffe on the side of a cake mix box pointed
out by David Frost:

The mixture made &quot;a cake for four persons or twelve small tarts.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's my impression that some persons
&gt; &gt; &gt; get a kind of perverse erotic gratification by
&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about their genitals,

&gt; MM:
&gt; I don't know if Ms. Kositsky was challenging Spinoza's machismo?  I
&gt; guess if you claim to be the Alpha Male, you'd better be ready to
&gt; unzip your pants and prove it.  LOL
">

Actually, the readiness to fuck anything that moves is not
characteristic of alpha male humanity. It might be something called
self-restraint and the ability to express love, and to act in a
respectful fashion while at the same time calling a spade a spade and
potential Fascism, potential Fascism. Furthermore, I have nothing to
prove to any of you people. Finally, this is a Shakespeare group, not
a group for sex talk.

What's happened to all your fine words, Michael? They have been
flushed down the toilet, haven't they, and although you've been
bullied repeatedly because your ideas are jejune and silly, and not
worthy of a man your age, you now scent an opportunity to run with the
pack, because your ideas, jejune, silly, and based on Swedenborg's
nonsense as they are, were like most of the fine words expressed here,
nearly all of the noble sentiments, mere ghosts in the machine, ghosts
that is to say of a lost humanity.

This is a lost humanity after centuries of alpha males, including
Neighbor Shakespeare of Stratford on the river Avon, who realized
circa 1600 that he didn't have to &quot;fuck anything that moves&quot; in an
expense of spirit in a waste of shame, and who set about trying to
save his character's lives because he saw right through the views of
people who &quot;fuck anything that moves&quot;, including Goneril and Regan,
who take a break from fucking in eye gouging.

After you finish with expressing your fine words, you drop the mask
and you line up like beasts to gang rape anything that moves, or that
reminds you of what you are not. Like Nazis, disturbingly reminiscent
in fact, you turn from speaking of Millay and gurus to saying, or
encouraging other posters to say, FOUL THINGS that either have nothing
to do with my complaint, or mean that the victim of sexual harassment
has to shut the fuck up or be shamed.

No, I am not taking it &quot;too&quot; seriously. On May 9, during a lull during
which civility was increasing because Bob Grumman admitted he was
wrong, Ms. Kositsky INTRODUCED the subject with a malicious intent,
because she had her pantyhose in a tangle, because I'm not supposed to
&quot;call&quot; a Jew a &quot;Nazi&quot;, which I didn't. You faggots might be used to
this treatment at the hands of self-appointed female thought leaders,

As I have said more than once, the only reason I am the alpha male is
that you fagboys sit here scared out of your wits against abuse by the
self-appointed thought leaders and are ignorant of the subject you
came in to discuss. You're at best summer stock and community actors

What the woman thinks doesn't control. In my experience, there are all

and most of their opinions don't control me.

No it does not, except in the dream world of sexual shame. I made
appropriate reference to the incident because it was UNACCEPTABLE
sexual harassment. You're trying to shame the victim so he doesn't
report. It won't work here, so knock it off.

Nobody's sexual tittilation interests me in the slightest here. I find
most of you highly unattractive people, in part because you condone
unacceptable behavior on the part of thought leaders because YOU are
afraid of being targeted in your turn.

This isn't erotica. Erotica is &quot;naked, she sucked his cock&quot;. Erotica
affirms life and it doesn't expose people to shame, except when
masochists willingly agree to be shamed.

There is something VERY WRONG with people who find this erotic.

I've been suspecting this for some time, but now I'm sure of it.
Nil-jest (the fact that he chooses to refer to his surname as a
&quot;patronymic&quot; is also telling -- an absent or ineffectual father, I dare
say) is a latent homosexual in deep denial. Thus his obsessive need to
degrade women,* combined with his obvious insecurities where that
masculinity is concerned. He will obviously not be capable of
integrating into polite society until he accepts that he, himself, is
one of the &quot;faggots&quot; [sic] that he attacks above.

Dear John

You're a clever, clever man. See if you can use your cleverness to get
Spinoza talking about Shakespeare rather than stuff that is ugly and
offensive.

Best wishes

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's my impression that some persons
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get a kind of perverse erotic gratification by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking about their genitals,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know ifMs. Kositsky was challenging Spinoza's machismo?  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guess if you claim to be the Alpha Male, you'd better be ready to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unzip your pants and prove it.  LOL

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inducing others

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk about their genitals and then taking that opportunity to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complain about others talking about their genitals ad infinitum.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ms. Kositsky dangled the bait.  Spinoza took it, hook, line, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sinker.  Now he's telling us that his penis is a good one.  LOL  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't know if he's mentioned the length of it, but he did mention that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he's fathered a couple of children.  MaybeMs. Kositsky was just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; challenging the Alpha Male?  Maybe Spinoza took it way too seriously?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spinoza sort of asked for just such a challenge, IMO.  Since Spinoza
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claims to be the Alpha Male, I don't know what a woman might think,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I can just imagine.  I'm not about to say whatMs. Kositsky might
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been thinking.  I believe she is married, too, so she can write
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what she was thinking.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only way to stop is to just stop.  It feels somehow inhumane to shun
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people but try being on the receiving end of over four hundred posts
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on a certain English peer's dress.  Sooner or later you run out of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; studies on OCD in parakeets.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, talking about your private parts makes them public.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it has become public, and it has added some erotica to HLAS.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wonder what the next episode of this will be?  Stay tuned?  LOL  It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all God's creation.  We might as well be open, sometimes.  Too much
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suppresion is not good.  It's no secret that men have sexual thoughts,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and women do, too.  I don't know who's winning this battle of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sexes, but maybe we'll find out?  LOL

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here's to women, cards, and dice
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blue-balled bastards, syph, and lice
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've had them all, once or twice

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ooh, I'd never have sat near you if I'd a known you had lice. Come to
&gt; &gt; &gt; think of it, I'm itching badly. :(

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lift up your skirt and I'll take a slice

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fucking and fighting is all that i crave

&gt; Well, the Lynch mob has certainly been mobilized tonight. In the

&gt; You can't even do my extended family the courtesy of refraining from

Be quiet, Spinoza, and let them lift those skirts.  LOL  What a combo,

No, it's not absurd. This newsgroup is a fucking joke because every
time things settle down and tend towards an ontopic civility, a
thought leader, filled with resentment over fancied slights or
spelling errors, deliberately verbally assaults a subaltern. The
subaltern poster then defends himself which causes the mob, fearful of
being individually exposed, to turn on the subaltern *en masse*, as
you have been turned on in the past.

The process starts with insecure thought leaders, insecure because
they have little access to other forums, who know exactly what they
are doing. They are mobilizing Brown Shirts to do their dirty work for
them so that they can continue to pose as civilized people. Oh, and
this is what the German elite did during the Nazi era.

Yes, I am soooooooo victimized. On May 9th, Ms. Lynne &quot;Ms Mouse&quot;
Kositsky published a limerick based on my penis length which had it
been a limerick about a female's pudenda, would have been recognized
even by you clowns as extremely offensive. I am currently being
psychoanalyzed by amateurs, and although there is nothing wrong with
this in the abstract (I have engaged in informed speculation on
psychodynamics myself), the purpose of the psychoanalysis is the pure
insult.

I am genuinely concerned with very disturbing features of North
American communities, starting with my concern in the 1980s with the
increasing ineffectuality of people my age and younger in software
development team formation. I realized, at Bell Northern Research in
1985, that many people were entering the field and adult life so
saturated with individualistic and competitive values that they would
do and say anything to win.

Complementary to their magical (and typically underinformed in a
technical register) belief in the precision of technology and the
unquestionable nature of mathematics was a belief, sadly fostered by
lazy English teachers of the 1960s, that statements about human
affairs can be selected and delivered a la carte and without any
responsibility to theory and the truth.

Therefore, they felt no compunction in &quot;structured walkthroughs&quot; to
consistently speculate on the motives and character of others because
&quot;winning isn't everything&quot;, it had become as early as 1985, in an
Amerikkka entering longterm decline, the only thing.

I see no tact here. I see what Fromm recognized in the 1960s as a mass

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; challenging the Alpha Male?  Maybe Spinoza took it way too seriously?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spinoza sort of asked for just such a challenge, IMO.  Since Spinoza

&gt; willing to drink bleach so I've been a little

Sorry to hear that you were unwell, and I understand you were under
the weather. I will REMOVE the post that you mention right now.

See how easy that was, people?

What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?

Kennedy, do you NOW see what you do when you speculate that I offend
women because of latent homosexuality, a hackneyed and second-hand
thought that you snatch from the air without reason, as opposed to a
painful effort to EXPLAIN what might be going on in a group based on
the authoritarian model?

Michael wants reconciliation, but Nelson Mandela realized that
reconciliation without truth is just an invitation to more war. Last
May, I failed to see that Ms. Mouse offered to remove the post because
her self-image was in play, not because she thought she was wrong, and
this was evident when after I left she joined the whispering campaign.

This is a Shakespeare discussion group. According to Ted Hughes
recently, Germaine Greer in the 1970s, and Robert C. Goddard in 1954,
THE MAN Shakespeare was no aristocrat who walked the streets with a
sword and a crew of bullyboys to exact revenge for slights real and
fancied. No, according to Hughes he was trying to solve the tragic
equation (I harm you and you harm me and we are all together locked in
a deadly embrace). According to Greer he had a capacity for suffering
in an era when &quot;to suffer&quot; was almost cognate to &quot;to experience&quot;, a
world lit only by fire. According to Goddard he wanted to avoid what
would happen if humanity devour'd itself like monsters of the deep.

NOT ONE of us, I'd hazard, actually kicks back to Shakespeare, and
EVERY ONE of us, I'd wager, demands different fare when we really kick
back from the stress of corporate jobs that every year become more and
more meaningless and more and more stressful, because those corporate
jobs have less to do with productivity and more to do with crowd
control in an era when automation has alienated the tools of
production. This is because Shakespeare's last plays, almost
incomprehensibly to some critics, try to open the door to a green
world, in which Katherine of Aragon can forgive Henry, in which
Leontes can ask for forgiveness, and in which Prospero can give up his
magic powers.

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Pretty sappy stuff, but vastly preferable to the constant speculation
that the Beast walks in human form in the form of the Stranger, a
speculation that we now use at-will to spare ourselves the burden of
thought. Even Charles Manson has to be forgiven once you read, in
Wikipedia, that he grew up in the nightmare world of the 1940s in
America, when parents DID try to sell their children for a pitcher of
beer, an Amerikkka, the experience of which caused Ibn Qutb to form
the basic ideals of al Qaeda, an America in which people would use
Puritan sexual shame to accomplish their narcissistic goals.

Germaine agrees, from the same article cited a few moments ago:

&quot;Senechal has claimed that until she came along no one had had the balls to
expound all of Shakespeare's double entendres. As her contributions mostly
consist in identifying all cylindrical objects from candles to cannons as
penises and virtually everything else as a vagina, Senechal's contributions
have not much advanced our understanding.

We do not need to believe that when Angelo cries &quot;What's this? What's this?&quot;
in Act II, Scene ii of Measure for Measure he is referring to his erection.
It is on evidence of this order that Senechal has decided that Shakespeare
is filthy. The editors have also apparently agreed that the filth was
injected to please the working classes. The historic truth is that sexual
innuendo was a principal amusement of the literate classes, that is to say,
those who could read Latin. The working classes took their obscenities
neat.&quot; //GG, Australian

Quite. If the bloke wants to put his peer in a dress, pft, we are as liberal
as all get-out here!

--Intermission--

To be less peerious, more serious, a moment; what happens when so many
allusions are collated, as in the Work, or in typical writing and
'interpretations' of the Work which are singular, is to see not an active
and passive principle in operation, in all its compexity - but instance of
dicks and cunnies as all wot the Awfer was gettin' at.

And that might be what coy Victorian editors wanted to suppress [to
paraphrase Greer], or other Victorians to /shock-you!/  as contrast to the
repressives.

But in any work generally admitted to be multi-dimensional, it fails to
understand the scope of the whole thing. I mean, we are not reading DH
Lawrence who wrote directly of sex, but without metaphor.

And we are talking of an age far more frank than the late-Victorian scene
[GG/ ibid].

Another good analyst of this penomenological interpretation is Antonia [A.
S.] Byatt, who pursues aspects of it in her 4 novels, especially Babel's
Tower, were a parallel to the Chatterly trial is examined.

Cordially, Phil Innes

between Spinoza and Mouse, then he will get back to normal, hopefully,
but maybe with a little more tact?  :-)  He and Elizabeth are on
better terms, so we can hope that he and Mouse will do likewise.

Spinoza is like Shakespeare.  The predominance of the evidence points
to Spinoza's heterosexuality.  J W Kennedy talks about latent

Lust usually desires sexual intercourse.  One thing leads to another.

&gt; Germaine agrees, from the same article cited a few moments ago:

&gt; &quot;Senechal has claimed that until she came along no one had had the balls to
&gt; expound all of Shakespeare's double entendres. As her contributions mostly
&gt; consist in identifying all cylindrical objects from candles to cannons as
&gt; penises and virtually everything else as a vagina, Senechal's contributions
&gt; have not much advanced our understanding.

&gt; We do not need to believe that when Angelo cries &quot;What's this? What's this?&quot;
&gt; in Act II, Scene ii of Measure for Measure he is referring to his erection.
&gt; It is on evidence of this order that Senechal has decided that Shakespeare
&gt; is filthy. The editors have also apparently agreed that the filth was
&gt; injected to please the working classes. The historic truth is that sexual
&gt; innuendo was a principal amusement of the literate classes, that is to say,
&gt; those who could read Latin. The working classes took their obscenities

Shakespeare, as all Masters, knew how to get people's attention.  He
had to write about sinning to get their attention, then he wrote about
the Muses, which can save us from all sin.  If he only wrote spiritual
ALL THE TIME, then there would have been a lack of grassroots
communication, let's say.  If people give more importance to the
sexual innuendos, then they miss his main message.  He was not trying

baiting both social levels.  He was collecting sheep from all walks of

It is not so easy to give up lust.  Lust is considered the most potent

&gt; &gt; &gt; I write:

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you, because you are clearly being
&gt; &gt; &gt; harassed in this forum and it really hurts me
&gt; &gt; &gt; to see it.

&gt; &gt; But when she was harassed by someone else here, harassed and betrayed, no
&gt; &gt; call for the Black List? Phil Innes

&gt; I don't know what happened with Houlsby but Reedy et al
&gt; dealt with the first attack and that person has since become
&gt; a civil participant.  The question is how Nilges got back in after
&gt; he was banned (and he *was* banned because I went into his
&gt; profile page and read Google's notice).  I suppose cleaning off
&gt; the cookies or switching computers and altering a letter or two
&gt; in one's email address would do it but we really ought to look
&gt; into it because I suspect Nilges is banned as I write this.
&gt; Lynne should not be forced into a position in which she has
&gt; to leave for the sake of her health.

MM:
Is it possible that the Alpha Male is doing what he didn't want to
do?  Chase the ladies away?  I'm glad you're still here, Elizabeth.

Stone age Alpha Males are depicted dragging females around by their
hair and with a club in the other hand.  So much for Alpha Males.
This particular Alpha Male was so persistent, it makes you wonder.
