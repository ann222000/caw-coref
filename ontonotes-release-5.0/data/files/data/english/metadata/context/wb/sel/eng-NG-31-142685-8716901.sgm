&gt; The Crying Mexican
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

&gt; Last week, I went to a local shopping store around 10am. I pulled into a
&gt; parking space and as I sat there getting my list together, a nice new
&gt; Dodge Ram pulled in and parked opposite me. It wasn't surprising to see a
&gt; couple of Hispanic men staring back at me from the truck (there's plenty
&gt; in my town), but what was surprising is that they both drained a couple of
&gt; beers as they sat there....at 10am! I took the liberty to let my eyes pass
&gt; into their cab as I walked by and noted the brand of beer was from mexico,
&gt; and there were several.

&gt; All I could think was: that by 3pm when the local kids are walking home
&gt; from school, these two middle aged immigrants would still be drinking and
&gt; driving.
&gt; I stood behind their truck, taking the license plate and the two men
&gt; sauntered by, paying no attention to me and speaking loudly in spanish.
&gt; I waited about 20 minutes for the police and the immigrants were just
&gt; pulling out of the lot as I flagged the officer and pointed to the
&gt; departing truck.

&gt; 30 seconds later, the truck was stopped and it's occupants were pleading
&gt; their case. 2 minutes later, another cruiser arrived and one of the
&gt; occupants was taken away. The other man (who was the driver), stood with
&gt; his blue baseball capped head hung down, hands in his pockets and a look
&gt; like the tears were close at hand. A few minutes later, a tow truck
&gt; arrived and as it secured its' load...I saw the immigrant wiping his eyes.
&gt; Too bad, so sad.

&gt; Better him, than the parents of innocent American school children.
&gt; What makes these people think our laws are optional?

Good call!

My present apartment is rather lax on towing  cars from its outdoor
parking. So most of us don't bother to complain about the occasional car
that does not have its authorized parking sticker.

Last week about mid-week, as I went out to my car in the morning, I saw
2 police cars in our driveway with a tow truck nearby and the cops were
out of their cars talking to 2 very dejected looking men (( probably
black immigrants))

I understand from neighbor tenants that cars were being towed from 9 AM
till after 2 O'CLOCK in the afternoon, about 30 cars in all.

When I inquired of management &quot;what was going on?&quot; the property manager
simply told me &lt;&lt;&lt; Oh it was a police matter. We were told not to
discuss it! &lt;&lt;&lt;

I am sure that it was Something Good. A  bunch of miscreants in our
building were probably getting away with Serious DMV infractions, such
as driving Untitled cars for too long.

As is usual around here, we are a &quot;citizen minority&quot; among the renters.
It was not the minority renters I feel quite sure, getting their cars
towed..
