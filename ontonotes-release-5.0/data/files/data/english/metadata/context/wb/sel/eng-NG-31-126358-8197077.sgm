A bit stale to be called news http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/13/1340215
and I certainly don't want to start a fight but I did wonder?
I am a linux noob but so far my limited experience leads me to prefer
kde as the text looks clearer. Not sure if I can change it on gnome
but don't see why I'd bother if kde works better.
So why do you use what? apart from shell terminal of course.

I am not averse to the shell just not too well versed in commands.

I change too often to reside in either camp. I was using Gnome while
testing Ubuntu Gutsy Tribe 3, but I reinstalled to test a fresh
version of Gutsy Tribe 4 and thought I'd use KDE this time.  Kubuntu
always takes a little longer to get polished in the Ubuntu dev cycle,
so that means more breakage and more bugs to report :) Ah sweet
breakage..

From my own experience a lot of the obvious confgiuration options on KDE are
hidden on Gnome rather than missing. As for my own favourite it is Gnome. If
you'd asked last year I would have said KDE. A few months down the line it
might be KDE again. I also have machine running Xfce, which isn't bad if you
want something light that'll load up before the next general election.

Personally,  I don't find it causes /too/ much of a hassle to have both KDE
and Gnome installed, so I can switch as the mood takes me... if you use
applications using libraries from one on the other then you'll have half the
thing installed anyway. May as well go the whole hog until you find yourself
settling on one of them.

I use KDE because when I first started using Linux eight years ago, it
seemed more user-friendly, and I have been too lazy to check Gnome out
since, as I am happy with it!

You don't have to be averse to the shell to want a GUI based browser!!!

I like fluxbox, personally.

XFCE is also achieving some popularity as a 'third candidate'. There are
ubuntu install images (Xubuntu and Fluxbuntu) for both. When running one
of the big, heavy desktops I usually end up with Gnome, though I've no
strong feelings about the K vs. G question.

Personally, I would now choose Gnome from between the two. When I
started using Linux in 2001 when I was 11, Mandrake was popular, and
KDE was the desktop. For years I used KDE and disliked GNOME, but
recently GNOME really took off for me with UbuntuStudio, which I made
my entire Moving Image Arts AS coursework on and got an A. That'll
show my teacher up his doubts that Cinelerra isn't as good as Final
Cut :)

I now know why Gnome works, and will help people moving to Linux from
Windows, they're right - KDE has too many dials and buttons to twirl
and push :P but overall, KDE will give you your real personal desktop.
It's only opinion when people choose, there's no right answer :) If I
got a Tablet PC, I'd probably use a custom KDE, and I'm still a lover
of Fluxbox when done properly - an impressive show can be put on my
old Panasonic Toughbook CF-27 (32MB RAM) something neither KDE or
GNOME will ever achieve.

KDE or not, who's looking forward to KDE4?

Personally I prefer Gnome over KDE.

Both are good in what they do and it's just a matter of personal
preferences.

KDE offer much more accessible options to change the GUI to suit what you
need.

In my case, Gnome GUI provide me with what I need - easy way of getting to
the application, I'm not bothered about the &quot;look&quot; of the GUI itself,
since I only focus on the application themselves to do my work and for a
browser - it doesn't matter what GUI you use, the websites all look the
same!

Sorry J, I have to argue there :P

Websites can look incredibly different depending on what's doing the
