NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comedian Whoopi Goldberg (news) will no longer
appear in ads for diet aid maker Slim-Fast following her lewd riff on
President Bush (news - web sites)'s name at a fund-raiser last week,
the company said on Wednesday.

Florida-based Slim-Fast said it was &quot;disappointed&quot; in Goldberg's
remarks at last Thursday's $7.5 million star-studded fund-raiser at
Radio City Music Hall in New York.

&quot;Ads featuring Ms. Goldberg will no longer be on the air,&quot; Slim-Fast
General Manager Terry Olson said in a statement, adding that the
company regrets that Goldberg's remarks offended some customers.

Republicans have expressed outrage over the fund-raiser for
presumptive Democratic nominee John F. Kerry and his vice presidential
running mate, John Edwards (news - web sites), in which entertainers
lined up to skewer the president.

The New York Post said of Goldberg's appearance at the event: &quot;Waving
a bottle of wine, she fired off a stream of vulgar sexual wordplays on
Bush's name in a riff about female genitalia.&quot;

A spokesperson for Goldberg declined immediate comment.

Slim-Fast is a unit of Anglo-Dutch food-to-detergent group Unilever
Plc .

&gt;&gt;What ties?
&gt;You're joking, right? Nobody could be that fucking stupid.

a large commercial aircraft, moving at cruising
speed at an altitude of ten feet, struck that
building. And the hole's about the right size.&quot;

&quot;Demonstrate that Flight 77 struck the Pentagon.
Explain how a 757 could sustain level flight just ten

explain how the plane could utterly vanish, leaving
only an unburned but crumpled engine cowling, in a
twenty foot hold.&quot;

I count at least five errors in spelling and grammar, which almost,

Modern Conservative: Someone who can take
time out from praising the politics of actors
Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwartzenegger and
Bruce Willis to tell us that actors (Baldwin,
Streisand, Sarandon, Robbins, Asner) know nothing
about politics and should keep their mouths shut.

&gt;&gt; NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comedian Whoopi Goldberg (news) will no longer

&gt;&gt; President Bush (news - web sites)'s name at a fund-raiser last week,
&gt;&gt; the company said on Wednesday.

&gt; Yup, she dare treadith on supreme ruler Bush's name, and now has
&gt; to pay the piper. She's fortunate that she wasn't labled an
&gt;&quot;enemy combatant&quot; (seriously :\

&gt; another reason to vote Bush out of office come November.

"/> What I don't understand is why Whoopi Goldberg was hired to
be a spokesperson for Slim Fast anyway. Isn't she very overweight?
Wouldn't it make more sense to find a spokesperson for a weight
loss product who was actually thin after losing weight by using
that product? I haven't seen Whoopie Goldberg in ages so perhaps
she did lose weight. If that's that case ... never mind!

"/> Really? You mean all those rabid conservatives complaining about Ronald
Reagan, Arnold Swartzenegger, and Sony Bono using their celebrity status
to gain political advantage? You mean all those conservatives who talk
about a smaller and less restrictive federal government who then vote
for a man who enlarges government to record levels and attempts to use
government force to dictate how people express their religious beliefs,
their sexual preferences, and tell people how to love each other? Nah!
Conservatives are not hypocrites, at least that's what they claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comedian Whoopi Goldberg (news) will no longer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appear in ads for diet aid maker Slim-Fast following her lewd riff
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on President Bush (news - web sites)'s name at a fund-raiser last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; week, the company said on Wednesday.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Florida-based Slim-Fast said it was &quot;disappointed&quot; in Goldberg's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remarks at last Thursday's $7.5 million star-studded fund-raiser at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Radio City Music Hall in New York.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Ads featuring Ms. Goldberg will no longer be on the air,&quot; Slim-
Fast
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; General Manager Terry Olson said in a statement, adding that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company regrets that Goldberg's remarks offended some customers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Republicans have expressed outrage over the fund-raiser for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presumptive Democratic nominee John F. Kerry and his vice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presidential running mate, John Edwards (news - web sites), in
which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entertainers lined up to skewer the president.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Funny we didn't hear about Republican outrage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when their own candidates do the same thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Conservatives can be such hypocrites, you know?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They are high and pious, and bitch about morals......untill it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;comes to their wallets

&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess that anyone who supported Clinton isn't too concerned with
&gt;&gt;&gt; morality.

&gt;&gt; What does Clinton have do with the current
&gt;&gt;spate of GOP double standards?

&gt; What spate?

"/>  Bush supported the war in Vietnam - as long as
he didn't have to go there himself. He campaigns
regularly on the success his occupation of Iraq -
but censors press coverage of the human cost. He
claims to support the military - but ignores the
advice of military leaders. He got out of his Guard
committment early, but is now compelling soldiers
to stay in Iraq after their enlistments are up. He
campaigned on a theme of personal responsibility,
but holds no one accountable for any failure on his
watch. He supports veterans but closes VA hospitals.

It takes a lot to make veterans to turn their backs
on a Republican, but Bush is just the Republican to do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't recall any worries on his part.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You know, the Senate

&gt;&gt;&gt; What became of that proble from the leftist Senate?

&gt;&gt;Huh? The Senate is majority Republican. Are you saying

&gt; The Senate is liberal.

&gt; Look at their voting record.

"/>  You mean their &quot;liberal&quot; voting record of
approving every one of Bush's cabinet appointees?
Their &quot;liberal&quot; voting record of approving all
but 4 of his 140 judicial nominees? Their &quot;liberal&quot;
voting record of approving the Iraq war, the Patriot
Act, and everything else Bush wanted?

PS: Name one bill from the &quot;liberal&quot; Congress

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Huh? The Senate is majority Republican. Are you saying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that Republicans are now leftist?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Senate is liberal.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Look at their voting record.

&gt;&gt; You mean their &quot;liberal&quot; voting record of
&gt;&gt;approving every one of Bush's cabinet appointees?
&gt;&gt;Their &quot;liberal&quot; voting record of approving all
&gt;&gt;but 4 of his 140 judicial nominees?

&gt; HUH?! Seems like every damn time I hear the news, they knock down a
&gt; judicial appointee. Name the 136 new Bush judges.

"/>  Actually I misspoke. The lastest count:

&quot;The Senate has confirmed 198 of Bush's judicial
nominees, bringing the vacancy rate to its lowest
level in years. Nevertheless, in a campaign trip to
Senator John Edwards' home state of North Carolina
and to Michigan, Bush claimed that Democrats were
unfairly obstructing his judicial nominations.&quot;

www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0407/S00123.htm

And that doesn't include 2 &quot;recess&quot; appointments
that Bush made without Senate approval. He gets
is way with 200 judges and whines that the Senate
failed to approve four of them? What a crybaby.

"/> Speaking of hate crimes:

When James Byrd of Jasper Texas was dragged by rednecks, the big media
ran with it for weeks. The perps were convicted of a hate crime.

In that same Jasper Texas, blacks dragged to death white, penniless
hitchhiker Ken Tillery. In Alexandria VA, 8-year-old Kevin Shiflett
had his throat slashed by black Gregory Murphy who shouted racial
hatred while performing the act. Murphy even left a note in his room:
&quot;Kill them raceass whyte kids anyway.&quot; In SC, 17 blacks beat
bicyclist Troy Knapp into a vegetable. At UVA Charlottesville, roving
packs of blacks targetted and beat white and Asian kids. Some of the
perps frankly admitted targetting them because of race. In Alton,
Illinois, a white male, Richard Skelton was attacked and stomped to
death by a group of 25 blacks while black onlookers yelled, &quot;Kill the
cracker&quot;. In Cleveland, 14 animals beat a white girl on &quot;Beat A
White&quot; day.

No hate crime charges were filed in these cases AND the major media
ignored these incidents. Imagine if the races had been reversed.

In Idaho, a Mr. Manley, a black football referee, ripped the camera
from the neck of a white woman who photographed him as he left the
field, injuring her in the process. Her husband, Lonnie Rae, ran from
the stands and called the man &quot;nigger.&quot; Rae was charged with a hate
crime, which carried a max of 5 years and $5,000 fine. Manley who
committed a battery was charged with nothing!

You were saying something about unequal enforcement.

And of course when the Carr Bros. denigrated, raped, tortured, and
executed the five white divinity school students in Wichita, it was
called a &quot;crime of convenience.&quot;

After a black man in Pittsburgh opened fire on a group of white
strangers, Dan Rather said, &quot;Just because he opened fire on a group of
strangers while shouting racial epithets, we musn't jump to the
conclusion that this was a hate crime.&quot;

Oh well, at least one of the big media outlets reported that one.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Kill them raceass whyte kids anyway.&quot; In SC, 17 blacks beat
&gt;&gt; bicyclist Troy Knapp into a vegetable. At UVA Charlottesville, roving
&gt;&gt; packs of blacks targetted and beat white and Asian kids. Some of the
&gt;&gt; perps frankly admitted targetting them because of race. In Alton,
&gt;&gt; Illinois, a white male, Richard Skelton was attacked and stomped to
&gt;&gt; death by a group of 25 blacks while black onlookers yelled, &quot;Kill the
&gt;&gt; cracker&quot;. In Cleveland, 14 animals beat a white girl on &quot;Beat A
&gt;&gt; White&quot; day.

&gt;&gt; No hate crime charges were filed in these cases AND the major media
&gt;&gt; ignored these incidents. Imagine if the races had been reversed.

&gt;&gt; In Idaho, a Mr. Manley, a black football referee, ripped the camera
&gt;&gt; from the neck of a white woman who photographed him as he left the
&gt;&gt; field, injuring her in the process. Her husband, Lonnie Rae, ran from
&gt;&gt; the stands and called the man &quot;nigger.&quot; Rae was charged with a hate
&gt;&gt; crime, which carried a max of 5 years and $5,000 fine. Manley who
&gt;&gt; committed a battery was charged with nothing!

&gt;&gt; You were saying something about unequal enforcement.

&gt;&gt; And of course when the Carr Bros. denigrated, raped, tortured, and
&gt;&gt; executed the five white divinity school students in Wichita, it was
&gt;&gt; called a &quot;crime of convenience.&quot;

&gt;&gt; After a black man in Pittsburgh opened fire on a group of white
&gt;&gt; strangers, Dan Rather said, &quot;Just because he opened fire on a group of
&gt;&gt; strangers while shouting racial epithets, we musn't jump to the
&gt;&gt; conclusion that this was a hate crime.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Oh well, at least one of the big media outlets reported that one.

Judicial Nominee Gets Pre-Convention Push

By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON - Just before the political conventions, Senate Republicans
on Monday pushed forward one of President Bush (news - web sites)'s
court nominees to remind voters that Democrats have blocked some of
the White House's most-desired judicial nominees.

The Senate will vote Tuesday on William Myers' nomination to the 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, but Republicans are not
expected to get the 60 votes needed to get past Democrats' objections.

&quot;Some senators apparently believe that nominees who do not think like
they do, and will not advocate their pet causes while on the bench,
deserve nothing more than to be filibustered,&quot; Senate Judiciary
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Monday.

But Republicans aren't the only ones hoping to get a boost from Myers'
nomination. Democrats say a vote on Myers gives them an opportunity to
publicize how bad the Bush administration has been for the environment
and the federal judicial system.

&quot;This nomination brings the environment to the front burner as the
Senate ends this summer session,&quot; said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont,
the Judiciary Committee (news - web sites)'s top Democrat. &quot;William
Myers epitomizes the anti-environmental tilt of so many Bush
nominees.&quot;

If Myers is blocked Tuesday, he would be the seventh of Bush's appeals
court nominees to be halted by Democrats on the Senate floor, a figure
Republicans and Democrats are sure to tout at their political
conventions.

&quot;The public hasn't really heard much about judicial nominations since
November&quot; when Republicans staged an all-night debate on Bush's
blocked nominees, said Sean Rushton of the Committee for Justice, a
conservative group set up to help Bush get his nominees on the courts.

&quot;We think it is a very, very important issue after the two most
obvious issues (war and the economy), and it does resonate,&quot; Rushton
said. &quot;If it is put out there and explained properly, it becomes a
proxy for several matters for swing voters,&quot; including gay marriage
and the Pledge of Allegiance court decision.

Liberals complain about Myers' opposition to environmental protections
when he was Interior Department solicitor, 2001-2003, and his work as
a private lawyer and lobbyist for cattle and mining interests.

&quot;William Myers is one of the least qualified and most problematic
judicial nominees the Bush administration has brought forward,&quot; said
Ralph Neas, president of the liberal People For the American Way.
&quot;It's not that easy to stand out among Bush's bad nominees, but Myers
does.&quot;

Senators also may vote on another nomination likely to be contested:
Henry Saad, who was tapped for the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals (news - web sites). Michigan's Democratic senators,
Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, want Saad blocked in part because
Republicans would not allow votes on two of President Clinton (news -
web sites)'s nominees for that court.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now would you care to name - since you are big

&gt;&gt;&gt;rejected?

&gt;&gt; which are especially needed in the communistic 9th Circuit.

&gt;&gt; Judicial Nominee Gets Pre-Convention Push

&gt;&gt; 1 hour, 1 minute ago Add Politics - U. S. Congress to My Yahoo!

&gt;&gt; By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer

&gt;&gt; WASHINGTON - Just before the political conventions, Senate Republicans
&gt;&gt; on Monday pushed forward one of President Bush (news - web sites)'s
&gt;&gt; court nominees to remind voters that Democrats have blocked some of
&gt;&gt; the White House's most-desired judicial nominees.

&gt;&gt; The Senate will vote Tuesday on William Myers' nomination to the 9th
&gt;&gt; Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, but Republicans are not
&gt;&gt; expected to get the 60 votes needed to get past Democrats' objections.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Some senators apparently believe that nominees who do not think like
&gt;&gt; they do, and will not advocate their pet causes while on the bench,
&gt;&gt; deserve nothing more than to be filibustered,&quot; Senate Judiciary
&gt;&gt; Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Monday.

&gt;&gt; But Republicans aren't the only ones hoping to get a boost from Myers'
&gt;&gt; nomination. Democrats say a vote on Myers gives them an opportunity to
&gt;&gt; publicize how bad the Bush administration has been for the environment
&gt;&gt; and the federal judicial system.

&gt;&gt;&quot;This nomination brings the environment to the front burner as the
&gt;&gt; Senate ends this summer session,&quot; said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont,
&gt;&gt; the Judiciary Committee (news - web sites)'s top Democrat. &quot;William
&gt;&gt; Myers epitomizes the anti-environmental tilt of so many Bush
&gt;&gt; nominees.&quot;

&gt;&gt; If Myers is blocked Tuesday, he would be the seventh of Bush's appeals
&gt;&gt; court nominees to be halted by Democrats on the Senate floor, a figure
&gt;&gt; Republicans and Democrats are sure to tout at their political
&gt;&gt; conventions.

&gt; Wow. The Senate you blast as &quot;liberal&quot; has
&gt;confirmed all but 7 of Bush's 200 + nominations?

"/> Those are pinkos, quite liberal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And you guys are whining about that being
&gt;somehow unfair, after blocking over 60 of Clinton's?

"/> That's another lie.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do explain.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm talking about the judicial nominees.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So am I. So explain how voting to approve 198 of

&gt;&gt;Why would anyone want to financially hurt a company that is on their side with a boycott just
&gt;&gt;because they dislike having a crude drunk with a filthy mouth and no class as a company

&gt;&gt;It's just business.

&gt; Are you under the impression that we should welcome a company that

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush has gotten every cabinet appointee and virtually
&gt;&gt;&gt; every judicial nominee confirmed by the &quot;liberal&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Senate?

&gt;&gt; What a liar you are. The liberals have held religious tests on almost every
&gt;&gt; one of Bush's nominations, especially the ones for the courts.

&gt; So explain why the &quot;liberals&quot; approved 198 of
&gt;Bush's 204 judicial nominations. It that the best
&gt;case you can make for &quot;obstructionism?

"/> Which &quot;liberals&quot; are you talking about? Did they have the votes?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which are especially needed in the communistic 9th Circuit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Judicial Nominee Gets Pre-Convention Push

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 hour, 1 minute ago Add Politics - U. S. Congress to My Yahoo!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WASHINGTON - Just before the political conventions, Senate Republicans
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on Monday pushed forward one of President Bush (news - web sites)'s
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; court nominees to remind voters that Democrats have blocked some of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the White House's most-desired judicial nominees.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Senate will vote Tuesday on William Myers' nomination to the 9th
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, but Republicans are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expected to get the 60 votes needed to get past Democrats' objections.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Some senators apparently believe that nominees who do not think like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they do, and will not advocate their pet causes while on the bench,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deserve nothing more than to be filibustered,&quot; Senate Judiciary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Monday.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But Republicans aren't the only ones hoping to get a boost from Myers'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nomination. Democrats say a vote on Myers gives them an opportunity to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; publicize how bad the Bush administration has been for the environment
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the federal judicial system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This nomination brings the environment to the front burner as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Senate ends this summer session,&quot; said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Judiciary Committee (news - web sites)'s top Democrat. &quot;William
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Myers epitomizes the anti-environmental tilt of so many Bush
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nominees.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If Myers is blocked Tuesday, he would be the seventh of Bush's appeals
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; court nominees to be halted by Democrats on the Senate floor, a figure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Republicans and Democrats are sure to tout at their political
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conventions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow. The Senate you blast as &quot;liberal&quot; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;confirmed all but 7 of Bush's 200 + nominations?

&gt;&gt; Those are pinkos, quite liberal.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And you guys are whining about that being
&gt;&gt;&gt;somehow unfair, after blocking over 60 of Clinton's?

&gt;&gt; That's another lie.

&gt; No, only your denial is.

&gt;&quot;Republicans used other tactics to thwart 63 of Clinton's nominations.&quot;
&gt;www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/7267394.htm

&gt;&quot;Even less 'straightforward' were the numerous secret holds that
&gt;were used to prevent a large number of Mr. Clinton's 63 blocked
&gt;nominees from ever receiving hearings in the Judiciary Committee,
&gt;much less votes in that committee, or on the Senate floor.&quot;
&gt;saveourcourts.civilrights.org/newsletter/?uid=845

&gt;&quot;Republicans had thwarted 63 Clinton nominees while confirming 248.&quot;
&gt;www.ajc.com/news/content/news/1103/07judges.html

&gt;&quot;Republicans used Senate rules to torpedo 63 judicial nominations
&gt;made by President Clinton.&quot;
&gt;www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/11/13/senate.nominees/

&gt; Do you really enjoy being proven wrong?

"/> Don't know; it never happens.

At any rate, the Senate blocked Bush's judges who would have helped
prevent the slide of America into a Marxist shithole.

Fascists control the White House. They control both houses

Supreme Court.

This November's election is the American people's last chance
before the descent into totalitarianism becomes irreversible.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;conservatively biased media&quot;. Such a beast is by definition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing more than a politically correct name for fascism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, I see.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the media is biased to the left, it's &quot;art&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I said journalism is a liberal art.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So all you've done is take a profession and label it an art in order to
&gt;&gt;&gt; justify any liberal bias that might rear its ugly head.

&gt;Clueless. Journalism by definition (at least in a free society)
&gt;has a liberal bias. &quot;Liberal bias&quot; has absolutely nothing to do
&gt;with &quot;left-wing bias&quot; -

"/> It does inthe American media, most of the UK media, and Reuters.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nice try if you can find someone stupid enough to fall for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, by its very definition. Do you know what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; definition of fascism is?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I looked it up just to be sure. Guess what? It didn't say &quot;conservative
&gt;&gt;&gt; media bias&quot;.

&gt;fascism - a political theory advocating an authoritarian hierarchical
&gt;government (as opposed to democracy or &gt;&gt;liberalism&lt;&lt;)
&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Fascism

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, I do know what &quot;hypocrite&quot; means. Among other things, it means
&gt;&gt;&gt; people who think liberal bias is acceptable but conservative bias is
&gt;&gt;&gt; fascism.

&gt;Learn what these words mean, not what Rush tells you
&gt;they mean. You can't separate liberal bias from journalism.
&gt;Trying to do so is the very definition of fascism.
