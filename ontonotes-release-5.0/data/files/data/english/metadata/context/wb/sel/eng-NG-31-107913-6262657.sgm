Bought a 2006 conv in July with the 5 cylinder engine.  MPG stinks!  Only getting about 14-16 mpg city.  Anyone else doing any better?

How many miles on it so far and how are you measuring the mileage?

And the next part of the question is how far do you drive in your
average trip? And then where do you live? 5 mile commutes in San
Francisco or Pittsburgh might produce worse mileage than a 5 mile
commute in Phoenix.

Some basic assumptions here:

Your commute is the 'typical' sort of thing, ~15 miles of mixed highway
and city.
Other trips are mostly pretty short. Shopping/neighborhood sort of
stuff.
You are in a northern-tier location burning winter-formulated gasoline.
You are likely burning 87 octane 10% ethanol fuel.

Under these conditions, your MPG is pretty damned good. Even if you
were burning 93 octane, that would be very good.

My 2.5-liter 5-cyl Volvo XC-70 gets ~18mpg overall-average based on my
typical mixed roads driving patterns. If I take a long trip on highways
where I can set the cruise-control at ~72mph (65 posted limits around
here), that jumps to 28-30mpg. My wife's 3-liter LPT 6 Saab 9.5
averages 14mpg for her typical near-home use. We just took a trip to
Washington DC last week (300 mile R/T). We averaged 31mpg including the
local driving about in DC. All of the above on 87 octane regular.

Our 99 Eurovan Camper averages 22 mpg on the highway. Around town,
~18mpg. It is a VR6 and driven gently. Lead-foot drivers pay a huge
penalty.

Just goes to show that size does not necessarily equate to good gas mileage.
I drive my V-8 powered 1995 Buick Roadmaster on level roads, at legal
speeds, and with gradual changes in speed (no rapid acceleration). My
overall combined gas mileage since I bought this car new has been at least
22 mpg using 87 octane fuel. It has a 23 gallon tank, and it has always
taken me 500 miles or more between fillups  (I don't let it get completely
empty).

Considering the pathetic gas mileage being offered with most of today's new
cars, I think the gas mileage achieved by my Roadmaster is great. Its a
"keeper", for sure.

Did you know Outlook Express can be configured to NOT post html to usenet.
I know a shock to think usenet is not the world wide web, but it is true,
usenet predates the WWW and html formated text. That of course is why
Outlook Express can be configured to post plain text, allow you to almost
look like you know what you are doing in usenet.

Might want to consider giving in a try.
