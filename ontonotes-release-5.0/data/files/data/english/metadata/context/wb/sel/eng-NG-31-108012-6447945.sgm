Peter, have you tried asking about rolling the dough in
rec.food.cooking?  The yanks and/or other readers of that group may
have some tips that would restore the job to legitimacy for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm trying to find a tortilla press in Brisbane.  I can buy one online if
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have to but I prefer to see what I'm buying before I part with the cash.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've tried a swag of deli's and kitchen supply shops but no luck.

Yep, tried all the tricks.  Wrapped it in plastic, tried rolling it,
pressing between 2 plates, added more water if dry and cracking etc.

I keep telling myself that if we were meant to roll masa dough, God wouldn't
have invented the tortilla press.

The way things are going, it will probably be quicker and easier for me to
get a Mexican housekeeper and get them to bloody do it for me!!

Thanks

Good Eats had a show on tortilla making not too terribly long ago.  Maybe
you can find a rerun or info on the replay on the Food Network web site.

I've never seen that in Mexico or in Southern California.  Usually I
see tortilla presses, which I recommend you try.  At one of my
favorite little restaurants the tortillas are hand made by patting
them between two hands.  Start with a small ball of dough, about a
ping pong ball size, pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat, and repeat
until you have a disk of the desired thickness, about 1/8th of an
inch.  Plop onto a hot griddle/comal/dry heavy skillet for 30 seconds
or so, turn, finish, serve.     -aem

I think the dough would be too dry to spin or to put through a pasta
machine.  I think the press is the go.

If I can't find one locally I'll just have to bite the bullet and order one
online.  I've seen them advertised at a couple of places in Sydney so the
freight shouldn't be too prohibitive.

For you possibly , but in the markets I have seen it done although the
rolling pin was a little different as it appeared slightly tapered to
the ends

Peter, I've made corn tortillas most of my adult life. Trust me,
biting the bullet and buying a tortilla press is the only way to make
uniform, proper tortillas.

Word of wisdom: I took an old bed sheet (years ago) and cut it into
about 6" squares, which I dampen, squeeze the excess out of, then use
the damp squares, top and bottom, with the roll of masa dough as the
"sandwich filler." It makes it so much easier to squash out with the
tortilla press. I press the dough once, then lift the top square and
smooth it over the dough, then press it again. Makes a nice, smooth
round of masa dough. Heat some cooking oil to the depth of about 3/4"
- I "test" the oil by running water over my hand and shaking some
water into the oil. If it sizzles smartly, it's ready, then I turn the
heat down to medium high. Sliding the masa round into the oil, I use
tongs and a wooden spoon and "feel" the underside of the round until
it feels just undercooked and still pliable, then turn it over and,
using the wooden spoon to "bend" the round, with the tongs to fold
half the round over itself, keeping the wooden spoon in the middle to
keep it from sticking to itself. Once the submerged side is cooked, I
roll it over and do the other. I drain the tortilla shells on an old
towel.

Mexican (okay, okay, Tex-Mex) recipes upon request :-)

Just curious which type of tortilla you're attempting to make... corn
or flour?  Have you googled for information yet?  There's a lot of
good information on the net.

Now *that's* certainly a detailed "how to do it". :-)  [But for flour,
not masa, tortillas.]

Also some quite interesting plant info and images on the blog.
(For example, I discovered my clump of _Costus speciosus_ is now
_Cheilocostus speciosus_.  Bloody taxonomists at it again! ;-)
