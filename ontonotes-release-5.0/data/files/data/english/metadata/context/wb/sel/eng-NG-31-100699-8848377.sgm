If you don't believe me or if you are skeptical (which I was and I know many people are), simply do a Google search on &quot;youripodtouch4free&quot; or search on the company actually running the program, &quot;Transcendent Innovations&quot;. Search links are provided below to make this even easier for you:

So, you can get your very own Apple iPod Touch 16GB or 8GB for free, $0.00! A brand NEW, factory sealed iPod Touch for FREE!!!

I learned about this offer from someone else (on eBay actually...someone else was doing the same thing there) and determined that it is real, so I am in the process of trying to get a free iPod as well. Just follow these four simple steps and you can be well on your way to getting yourself an iPod Touch for free as well. This is not a joke, spam, chain e-mail, or anything else like that.

STEP 1: Follow this link (click it or copy and paste it into your browser). The registration process is very simple and quick!!!

STEP 2: Read everything first of course, and then enter the required information. (They are totally a legit site. If you want, check the testimonials on the site if you don't believe me).

STEP 3: (THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART, YOU HAVE TO DO THIS TO GET YOUR FREE iPod) Complete just 1 offer. A lot of the offers are free or $1. You have to do 1 credit worth of offers. (I recommend you do Stamps.com...its FREE, easy to do, counts as 1 full credit and credits to your account instantly! Just remember, sign up for Stamps.com, download the stamp-printing software, install it, and receive your $5 worth of free stamps to be used during the 30-day free trial. After 25 days, be sure to cancel your membership with Stamps.com if you don't think you want to continue to printing your own stamps, otherwise you begin the normal membership of $15 per month.)

STEP 4: Finally, refer the required amount of people and -- once they have all registered -- simply order your iPod. It will be shipped right out for you free of charge! Enjoy your free iPod!

iPod Touch 16gb is 8 referrals

iPod Touch 8gb is 5 referrals

$350 is 7 referrals

$350 Apple Card is 7 referrals

Remember, I am not selling an iPod or charging for this information. All the information you need to obtain your free iPod is provided above and for free.

Thanks in advance for helping me earn a free iPod!!!!
