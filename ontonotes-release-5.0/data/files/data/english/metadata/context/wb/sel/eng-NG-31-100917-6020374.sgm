A FAMILY AFFAIR, by Ganymede.

Chapter 1.  2.15 p.m.  November 6th.

The wheels of my slide grate loudly on the  concrete  as  I
scoot out from under the car.  With a greasy palm  I  brush
the hair from my eyes, oblivious to the  dark  oily  streak
that came to  my  brow.   Silently,  I  curse  myself,  the
weather, life in general, just about  everything,  until  I
find the three-eighths socket.   It  is  less  than  a  few
inches from  where  I  had  left  it,  and  I  should  have
remembered.  Tiredly, I lie back  down  on  the  slide  and
begin to guide myself back under the car.  Working  on  the
transmission is nowhere near as much fun as the engine,  if
only because of the inhuman contortions required underneath
the car.

His voice comes out of nowhere.  It is not the  first  time
that I hear his voice.  The last time, in  fact  the  first
time was Halloween.  he came to my house for candy  on  All
Hallow's Eve.  Then he was dressed in virginal  white  from
head to foot.  A tee shirt that was X-X-L and came  to  his
mid-thighs, covered a white sweat shirt  and  pants,  white
sneakers, white gloves.  He was like some vague apparition,
perhaps an arab  terrorist,  perhaps  some  current  action
hero, but he was as  beautiful  as  an  angel.   His  upper
attire was not long enough to be a  robe,  but  it  was  so
loose that his form  was  all  but  concealed.   Without  a
flowing gown, he could not be a ghost, so he was  no  vague
apparition.  Nonetheless, white suited him, and  I  settled
for an angel because it was entirely appropriate for him.

In the darkness, he loomed mysteriously until he came  into
the pool of  light  from  my  lantern.   Then  his  tousled
golden-blond hair came  alive,  and  the  loose  snow-white
clothes gave him an aura of innocence and purity  that  was
out of place on a night of hob-goblins and ghosts.   For  a
moment I wondered whether he had simply dressed in his judo
or karate outfit, but the trousers were tighter  and  there
was no belt to be seen.  The brilliant white of his clothes
illuminated the porch even as his pretty  face  ignited  my
desire.  Although his clothes  communicated  the  unsullied
purity of a virgin, my heart and  my  imagination  shrieked
lust.  Like alchemy, I was drawn to  him  instinctively,  a
base metal turning to the purest gold in his presence.

There were two friends with him, and after even  a  cursory
comparison, they went largely unappreciated in his company.
Those boys simply did not interest me, at  least  not  like
the blond, curly-haired boy dressed all in white.   He  was
beautiful.  He was polite.  He had a graceful body and  the
nicest butt of any boy I've seen, even if  it  was  largely
hidden by his white robe.

By contrast, his friends, while very  good-looking  by  any
standard, were  relatively  plain.   One  was  also  blond,
straight-haired and  nicely  proportioned,  but  he  lacked
something that the other boy had in abundance.  I could not
look away from his startling  blue  eyes.   His  eyes  were
liquid magnets, and they attracted and held my gaze until I
felt my neck and cheeks flushing from the  mere  thrill  of
looking at the young Adonis standing on my doorstep.

"It's your turn to ask this time, Adam," one  of  the  boys
prompted.

"Um,...   Trick  or  treat?"   he  asked   with   uncertain
eagerness.

"Hm,...  I won't try to guess what you're supposed to  be,"
I pretended to ponder.  "Trick or  treat,  huh?   You  boys
look like you could get up  to  some  tricks.   I'd  better
settle for the treat, I suppose?"

The boy called Adam grinned sheepishly and glanced back  at
his two companions in candy-larceny for moral support.   He
hit the jackpot at my house and his two  friends  benefited
by their mere acquaintance with the golden-haired  boy  and
his musical still-unbroken voice.  What candy I  had  left,
about a pound of various bars and packets,  I  split  among
the three of them, and then  threw  in  a  few  of  my  own
reserved-for-later treats for good measure.  They scampered
off into the darkness, shrieking their good fortune as they
went with boyish excitement.

Adam could not know how much he had affected me.  I had the
distinct feeling that I had  seen  him  before,  somewhere,
sometime in my past.  In my eyes, he was  the  perfect  boy
who I would never forget.  No one could know  the  pounding
of my heart and the relentless desire that had  immediately
hardened and grew outward into the  tight  confines  of  my
jeans.  I closed my eyes after they were no longer in sight
and pictured him, still standing on  my  porch,  committing
every detail to memory for later.  I could barely  wait  to
relieve my burning urge.

Not until they were gone several minutes, and there was  no
chance of their return, did I close the door and  turn  off
the outside lights.  I retreated upstairs  to  my  bedroom.
There, I masturbated feverishly as I fantasized  about  the
perfect specimen of boyhood who had graced my doorstep  for
a few minutes that night.  In secret fantasy, I emptied  my
balls into Adam's pretty mouth and  then  into  his  sweet,
firm buttocks before I  finally  succumbed  to  watching  a
video I  had  smuggled  home  from  Thailand.   The  brown-
skinned boys engaged in obscene coupling  did  little  more
than relieve my hunger temporarily.  By then, my penis  was
only minutes from becoming red raw and I  nearly  regretted
my earlier frenzied jerking.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From that first acquaintance onwards  I  chose  to  believe
">

that  fate,  or  some  mysterious  force,  had  brought  us
together.  That chance meeting left  me  emptied  of  human
emotion as my energy was depleted in unrequited desire.   I
masturbated again and again that  night  before  I  finally
fell  asleep.   My  fantasy  was  fixed  on  Adam  with   a
single-mindedness that was disturbing.  What detail of  his
remarkable body did I fail to imagine?  There was  no  part
of him left untouched by my depraved mind.

His voice brings me back to reality, or  is  it  merely  an
extension of the dream that has plagued me ever  since  the
night of a week ago.  I scoot forward until my face  is  no
longer hidden under the car.  From the ground, I  stare  up
two slender legs hidden in the faded denim of old jeans.  A
small, finely featured face looks down at me, and the  hint
of a smile  flashes  across  his  mouth  to  leave  dimpled
cheeks.  Perfectly blue eyes seem to pour into mine with an
openness  that  is  disconcerting.   I  feel  that  he   is
revealing his soul to me and  I  am  blessed.   His  blond,
curling hair, is even blonder in the afternoon  light  that
enters the garage.  I feel as if I have known him for years
instead of a matter of mere seconds.

"Hi!"  I gush ebulliently.

"Hi yourself!  Cool car!"  His voice gives me shivers.   It
is so high- pitched that he sounds feminine.  If he sang he
would be a soprano.

"Thanks!"

"I'm not bugging you am I?"  Again, my eyes and ears belong
to him.  I bask in his precious tones.

"No!  hardly!  You're cool kid!"  I wonder whether  he  can
hear my heart pounding for him.   To  me,  my  voice  seems
distant and very strained.

"My bike chain came off," he says to explain his  presence.
"I was going to my friend's place.  He lives  over  there,"
he adds with a vague gesture towards the  woods  behind  my
house.

"Do you want me to  look  at  it?   I'm  pretty  good  with
mechanical things.  Your chain probably  needs  adjustment,
especially if it has gears."

"It's a 21 speed," he answers with pride.  "I just got it a
few weeks ago."

"I'll take a look at it in a few minutes when I've finished
with this."

"You don't mind an audience?"  He asks.  "My mom says I can
be a pest sometimes?"

"You're not!"  I shake my head, enchanted by his soft tones
and continual inflection so that he turns a statement  into
a question.

"I always wanted to learn about cars.  What are  you  doing
to it?"

"Replacing the clutch."

"Cool!  Is it expensive?  It sure looks it."

I swallow.  His voice has penetrated to the very center  of
my brain just as his clear, large eyes  have  absorbed  and
held my gaze until my soul seems to be sucked into him.  It
is an idea that holds distinct fascination for me.  I  drag
my eyes away and down to his sneakers, to  ankles  so  thin
and  insubstantial  that  they  belie  the  very   act   of
supporting him.  His jeans taper to  stope-pipe  legs,  the
outline of small knees as my eyes begin to lift up  to  his
groin.  I stop and stare, fully aware of what  lies  behind
his  petit  bulge.   There  is  merest  hint  of  impending
manhood, a fold  in  the  aged  blue  denim,  the  slightly
asymmetrical fullness of a young penis and still childishly
small scrotum.  From the size of the bump, I doubt that  he
is sexually mature, but I have  no  way  of  being  certain
short of tearing his jeans off.  It is another  fascinating
idea.

Again our  eyes  meet.   Another  radiant  smile  flickers,
lingers on his full red lips until his dimples form  again.
He has a beautiful smile, that lights on me  and  makes  my
day brighten.  His eyebrows raise slightly as  if  to  form
another question, issuing a  silent  challenge  to  my  now
continuous gaze.

"What?  The clutch?  It cost about a thousand bucks for the
set.  That's the clutch assembly over there in the box."

"No, I was asking about the car.  It's a Lotus, right?"

"Hey,  the  kid  actually  knows  his  cars!"    I   tease.
"Actually its an Esprit Turbo."

He grins impishly.  "I thought it was.  The kid knows a lot
things!"

"I'm sure he can.  The kid can make himself useful too,  it
he wants.  Could you pass me the screwdriver, please Adam?"
I feel a thrill as I address  him  by  his  given  name,  a
feeling that I have known him since I was a boy myself.

He follows my gesture and he stoops to the side to pick  it
up.  As he reaches to pass it to me, he suddenly hesitates.

"How do you know my name?"

"Adam?  It is Adam isn't it?  You were here  for  candy  on
Halloween, if I'm  not  mistaken.   That's  what  your  two
friends called you."

"Not wrong!  You must have a  great  memory.   My  name  is
Adam.  I live over there."  He gestures vaguely to the back
of the garage.  "Mostly my friends call me Canada.  I guess
because I used to live there before my mom got divorced."

"Hi Canada," I joke.

He smiles weakly.  "I'd  rather  you  called  me  Adam.   I
haven't lived in Canada for ages.  Not  since  my  mom  got
divorced."

"Okay, Adam.  My name is Chris.  It's  nice  to  meet  you.
I'd shake hands except I'm covered with grease."

"That's okay!  Later man!  So what's it  worth,  Chris?   A
lot I bet!"

I laugh and shrug good humoredly at  the  overt  youngster.
He exudes precocious maturity.  "You only get what you  pay
for," I answer deliberately.

"You sound like my mom!  You really don't mind if  I  watch
you work on it, do you?  I can be kind of a pain sometimes,
at least that's what she says when I pester people."

I laugh again and answer as I shake my head.  "You  already
said that.  You're not bothering me in the slightest."

I am dumbfounded, so engrossed in the delightful young male
that words escape me.  His voice has  a  melodious  quality
with clear high notes that penetrate  the  dullness  in  my
head and  leave  my  senses  whirling  like  a  dervish  in
ecstatic abandon.  Under my cover-alls, under my briefs,  I
can feel the rock-hard heat of  my  engorged  penis  as  it
throbs mercilessly to  the  frenetic  beats  of  my  heart.
Fortunately, he either cannot see it, or has not  seen  it,
assuming that he recognizes what it is or why it  is.   The
youngster, mere stripling, still several years from being a
teenager, has excited me in a  way  that  I  never  dreamed
possible.

Unable able to stand the strain of being so close, of being
so far away from the untouchable boy, of being so intensely
aroused in a child's presence, I push  myself  forward  and
slide under the car again.  I try to dismiss  the  thoughts
that overwhelm  my  reason  as  he  leaves  my  sight.   My
thoughts are in turmoil as I realize the absolute  futility
of it.  Society forbids what I am thinking, yet  I  can  no
more stop the thoughts as I can ask  him  to  leave  me  in
peace.  It is no different to the first  time  I  saw  him,
just as impossible to maintain control of my desires on All
Hallow's Eve.

I want to, need to take my penis out and  masturbate  until
my climax relieves my hungry urge.  Under the car,  in  the
under-world existence of the machine, there is privacy.   I
grope myself with greasy fingers on the grey  cloth  of  my
coveralls.  My rigid member aches, throbbing urgently.

I am tortured by unrequited love for a boy who  can  be  no
more  than  ten  or  eleven  years  old.   I   squeeze   my
blood-filled flesh as I  imagine  his  young  slender  body
trembling hungrily as he discovers passion.  I imagine  his
lips stretched wide,  a  thin  pale  line  of  nerve-filled
tissue as he takes my shaft into him.  No matter whether it
is his mouth or anus that holds me.  I am  not  particular,
either end would suffice to hold my love  and  the  seed  I
want so desperately to share with him.   I  have  forgotten
the three-eighths socket.

"Hey Adam?"

"Yeah, Chris," comes his unseen sing-song voice.

"There's a socket on the floor next to my  feet.   Can  you
push it to me?

"A socket?  What's it look like?  Is it  like  this  chrome
tube thing with holes in it?"

"Yep!  You got it, kid!  Just push it to me will you?"

With difficulty I rotate my shoulders and look out into the
space beside the car.  I watch  Adam's  feet  as  he  steps
forward.  When he squats, I  see  the  slenderness  of  his
ankles again, and as his knees came apart, I stare at  what
has suddenly become a small  yet  prominent  bulge  in  the
crotch of his jeans.  Is  it  my  imagination  that  it  is
bigger now?  Perhaps  it  is  merely  exaggerated  in  size
because of his position?

I watch his hand, his fingers scooping up the  socket,  and
then he comes to his knees.  His  face  beams  at  me  with
visible enthusiasm at being included in an adult world.  My
mechanical toy has  justified  itself  again.   Thirty-five
thousand dollars of secondhand automobile, with  mechanical
repairs of astronomical cost, but of undeniable interest to
any red-blooded boy with an interest in cars.  With  little
more than a wriggle of his narrow hips, Adam  scoots  under
the car beside me.  He grins ebulliently as  he  holds  out
the socket in  his  small  palm  like  a  treasure  for  my
inspection.

"Thanks!"

"I told you already, The fact is this kid can do a  lot  of
things," he teases.

"Maybe I should just teach you how to work on my car.  Then
I can leave it up to you to fix things  from  now  on."   I
laugh.  "There's a lot more room for  you  to  move  around
under here than I have."

Adam giggles softly.  He wriggles closer until his head  is
next to mine.  "It's probably the only advantage  there  is
to being small for my age."

"How old are you?"

"I'll be eleven in two months."

"Huh?  Oh, okay so you were born during  the  holidays.   I
expect you made your mom  a  great  Christmas  present,"  I
chuckle as I reach up under the car.

"What's that?  The silver thing up there?"  Adam inquires.

His hand moves up to the transmission and for a second, his
fingers slide along my arm.  I shiver.  The sensation is at
once incredibly exciting and very frightening.  I have been
touched by this very handsome boy.  I freeze, thinking hard
and fast as  my  skin  is  tantalized  by  his  soft  small
fingers.  Did his fingers linger just a moment longer  than
an accidental touch would justify?  My mind reels with  the
thought.  I am too  sacred  to  say  anything  for  several
seconds.  My mind is turned upside down.  My  thoughts  are
jumbled and I blurt out my answer.

"Oh!  That!  I think that's the starter motor."  My  sanity
returns slowly.  "Actually, I don't think it is, I know  it
is because I put a new one on  the  car  a  month  ago  and
that's it."

"Unless it fell off," Adam giggles  playfully.   "But  then
the car wouldn't start would it?  Can I help?"  he offers.

"Help?  Yes, I guess.  It's kind of hard for  you  to  help
because I'm not even sure what I'm  supposed  to  be  doing
myself.  If you really want to help, I'd appreciate  it  if
you could pass me the shop manual.  It's right beside you."

"Sure!  So where did this come from?"  Adam demands.

"England!  Just about every part of  this  car  comes  from
England.  See there," I said as I pointed my grease stained
finger at the center of the open  page.   "Could  you  read
from there for me?  I know you can read."

Adam giggles boyishly, feels a sudden thrill  from  helping
an adult, and begins to read aloud.   "Each  of  the  bolts
securing the housing has two nuts.  Completely  remove  the
lock nuts.  The bolts should be loosened consecutively  one
half-turn while the rear flange is supported in the  frame.
Once the assembly is  loose,  the  upper  bolts  should  be
removed while the two lower bolts are left in place."  Adam
giggles again.  "Why do the bolts have two nuts?"

I grin cheekily and say something  that  I  would  normally
never say.  It is a risk, but I am so light-headed  that  I
do not care.  "For the same reason you do, I expect."

"Huh?"

"One nut would be lonely wouldn't it?  And if you only  had
one nut, well you might lose it and then  where  would  you
be?  With two nuts there's a safety factor."

Adam's blush is immediate and  very  obvious  even  in  the
relative darkness  under  the  car.   "You  mean,..   Yeah,
kinda, I guess...."  he answers with juvenile  awkwardness.
"But that really isn't the reason, is it?"

"I wouldn't lie to ya, Adam."  I tease with a  mock  accent
of unknown origin.  "One  nut  keeps  the  other  one  from
coming loose.  It locks it in place, hence the  name,  lock
nut.  Like I said, it's a safety factor.  Which is probably
a good idea when you think about it."

"Does every bolt have two nuts?"

"Not always, in fact on a car  it's  something  you  almost
never see, but its a good idea!  You have  two  nuts  don't
you?"  I boldly tease again.

I wonder what is making me so daring besides being sexually
aroused by the beautiful boy beside me.  It cannot be  that
I have nothing to loose.  By nature, I  am  not  impetuous.
It is his presence alone, and the sense I have  that  tells
me he is not easily offended.

Adam smirks knowingly.  He  clearly  enjoys  the  innuendo,
childish though it is.  "Does it depend on the size of  the
bolt?"  he asks sweetly, as he avoids my question adroitly.

I stifle a laugh.  I like him a lot.  He  is  adventuresome
and he rises to the challenge of our  word  play.   "A  big
bolt probably needs two nuts more than a  little  one,  but
these bolts here are a bit one the small side."

"I guess it must depend on what you use the bolt  for,"  he
smirks,  no  longer  able  to  hold  back.   His  restraint
vanishes as his mirth bubbles into  an  infectious  puerile
giggle.  After all, he is still very much a boy.

"These bolts are under a lot of stress."   I  grin  in  the
semi-darkness and turn  to  face  him.   "The  greater  the
stress, the more you need two nuts.  Even small  bolts  can
be under a lot of pressure sometimes.   You  wouldn't  want
the bolt to come loose at a bad time, now would you?"

"If you use it a lot, you'd need two balls.  Ooops, I  mean
two nuts."  He giggles even more as he tries to repair  his
error.  "You'd need two nuts on  a  bolt  then,  especially
when it was being used a lot."

I swallow as I try to avoid laughing out aloud.  He is very
good.  He is not only intelligent and  full  of  precocious
wit, but he is also incredibly sexy.

"I  expect  so,"  I  say  seriously.   I  pause   and   add
fearlessly, "Do you think that's why you  have  two  balls,
oops I mean two nuts on your bolt?"

His eyebrows lift up as his eyes widen in disbelief that an
adult could  be  so  brazenly  vulgar.   "Because  it  gets
stressed,  or  because  it  gets  used  a  lot?"   he  asks
cheekily.

I nod anyway.   "Both,  in  some  cases.   Some  bolts  get
stressed a lot when they are being used a lot."  He giggles
knowingly, telling me without words that he is no  stranger
to self-abuse.  "I imagine it's only normal at your age," I
tease with a slight glance downward.

My meaning is obvious and for a  second,  his  eyes  follow
mine to his crotch.  There is no  mistake  when  he  smiles
slightly upon looking up again.

"Yeah!  I guess some bolts get stressed if they get used  a
lot.  Only, I don't know what's a lot."

"Oh, I don't know.  I'd say normal is a couple of  times  a
day,...  when you're about eleven or twelve."

He grins with lewd curiosity.  The  pretense  is  abandoned
and he comes right out with his next  inflected  statement.
After the innuendo it does not sound  lewd  to  my  burning
ears.  "You mean it's normal to get a stiffy  a  couple  of
times every day at my age?"

"Yes, it's normal to get stiff," I chuckle.  "What did  you
think?  Every boy gets  them.   Every  man  too,  for  that
matter.  It's natural, kid!"

Adam laughs.  "I get a stiffy all the time.   Do  you  have
one now?"  he asks without hesitation.

I smile ambiguously and shrug, a difficult action under the
car but one that is intended to  raise  his  curiosity.   I
wonder how far he will go.  It is hard to believe  that  we
are having this conversation.  My penis is as  hard  as  it
has ever been, but I cannot admit that  to  this  beautiful
child lying beside me for he alone has caused it.

"I bet you do," Adam giggles.  "You sure  are  acting  like
you're horny."

"I'm not the only one, am I?"   I  grin  at  him  and  wink
obscenely.

"Do you want to do stuff?"  he asks softly.

"Stuff?"  I ask in disbelief.

'Stuff' cannot mean the same thing to Adam that it does  to
me.  I swallow as my mind races.  I try to maintain control
of my physical urge  to  grasp  his  crotch  and  find  out
whether his penis is  as  hard  as  mine.   He  studies  me
nervously.  I sense that he knows  he  has  gone  too  far.
Innuendo has ended and neither of us is prepared to  accept
what lurks immediately under  the  surface  of  the  veiled
words.  His suggestion is impossible to ignore.

"What do you  mean  by  'stuff'?"   I  repeat  with  sudden
intensity.

There is a shy smile on his face as  he  blinks,  swallows,
licks his  bottom  lip  nervously.   "You  know,  Chris,...
STUFF!"

I realize  his  erect  penis  must  be  caught  up  in  his
underpants as he reaches down to his crotch and shamelessly
grasps the front of his jeans to rearrange himself.

"So, I'm not the only  one  with  that  problem,"  I  smirk
knowingly.

"We've both got boners, haven't we?"  Adam asks.  "You  did
say it's normal," he adds with a grin.

It is impossible to look away.  His eyes absorb me, hold my
attention, silently communicating that he wants only what I
want.  He licks his bottom lip nervously.   I  think  back,
remembering my own first time with a  man  I  admired  more
than my own father.

If I  tried  hard,  I  fancied  I  could  still  smell  the
lingering odor of chlorine from the  pool  at  the  country
club.  The setting then was no less inappropriate than now.
It was certainly public, but it was private  enough  if  we
were careful.  For no reason other than we were in the pool
together, we had raced.  I had been swimming as hard  as  I
could, barely managing to stay a length ahead.  Even as  he
allowed me to win, he pushed me to the  very  limit  of  my
endurance.  Excelling for him was something I  became  used
to doing.  Later, I followed him out of the  pool.   I  was
still wet when we stood face to face in  the  change  room.
Just from the ravenous look in his  eyes  I  knew  what  he
wanted.  He wanted me, as much as I wanted him!  I  grinned
stupidly as I peeled my Speedo off, pulling the  red  nylon
down until the brief covering was halfway to my knees.  His
eyes never left mine.  I felt his strong hand cup  over  my
penis and testicles.  Even though I was physically  drained
from the race, I felt full of life and bursting  excitement
as he contained all of me.  His fingers gently  fondled  my
sex organs until I became  aroused.   Only  seconds  passed
before my penis was rigid.  I felt his thumb stroke over my
short pre-teen organ,  caressing  my  hairless  flesh  with
loving touches.  For the first time in  my  eleven-year-old
life I felt complete and truly happy.  It lasted less  than
a minute before someone came into the change  room  to  use
the urinal and we were forced to stop.

"Well, DO YOU?"  Adam asks persistently.

"Do I what?"  I ask as I am returned to the present and  my
memories of my own youth depart in the immediacy of  Adam's
demand.

"Nothing!"  he replies angrily.

I have rejected him.  He confuses me.  At one moment he  is
brim full of confidence, the next second  he  is  insecure.
All logic tells me to be careful, but reason is distant now
that I have risen to the occasion with the hardest erection
I can remember having for many years.  I  know  right  from
wrong as well as any person, however I also know  that  all
moral standards are  relative.   One  society  can  deny  a
child's sexuality while another can celebrate it with rites
of initiation and passage to manhood.  Some  cultures  even
sanction the love of men  and  boys.   This  beautiful  boy
presents a dilemma,  and  my  rampart  lust  competes  with
ingrained morality.

"There's no need to get mad," I retort argumentatively.

"Who's mad?  It's cool!  I thought you were into it, that's
all!"

"Tell me how old you again," I say.

"I already told you.  I'm nearly  eleven.   Why?   Does  it
matter how old I am?  I'm old enough to do what I want."

I grin at him.  He is so beautiful that  I  cannot  imagine
why he is attracted to me.  I wonder why he is offering his
perfect body to a man who he has known only for a matter of
minutes.  Surely there are others who are more appropriate,
including a large selection of boys closer to his own  age.
Merely knowing this  wonderful  boy  is  far  more  than  I
deserve.  I bask in his presence.  I am happy just be close
to him, but the thought that he wants to do soemthing of  a
sexual nature with me sends a thrill through me unlike  any
I have known since I was a boy myself.  I have a feeling of
deja vu, and muse silently that Adam  could  be  me  twenty
years ago.  I want to tell him that I think  how  beautiful
he is, how much I adore  his  perfect  body,  how  I  would
worship him if I was given  a  chance  to  be  his  friend.
Words fail me.  I am love sick.

"Well?"  he demands abruptly.

I sense fear  is  setting  in.   He  wavers  again  between
confidence  and  insecurity.   Too  soon  he  will   be   a
self-assured  young  man,  sanguine  and  fearless  as   he
expresses  his  adolescent  sexuality.   For  now,  he   is
apprehensive, not even beginning to understand what  it  is
that drives him to adult males, knowing only that I possess
something that is essential to make him whole.  I begin  to
laugh.

"What's so  funny?"   he  demands  again.   The  cocky  boy
returns.

"Do you want me to put grease all over your nuts and bolt?"
I ask as I hold my right hand up for him to see.

He sees the black grease and dirt and he grins as he shakes
his head.  "Gross man!  You're not wrong!  Don't you  dare!
Your hands are filthy!"

"I guess I'm too dirty to tighten  your  nuts?"   I  smirk.
"But then, I bet they're probably already pretty tight."

Adam giggles.  He sounds a lot like a girl.   He's  at  the
perfect age when his testosterone levels are still  at  the
entry-level.   From  what  I  can  observe,  the  essential
characteristics of manhood have not started to appear.   Up
close, I see that his skin is  as  smooth  and  soft  as  a
baby's.  The masculine side of him is  nearly  balanced  by
feminine attributes that persist from childhood.  He is not
effeminate, but there are clear signs that he  is  not  all
boy,  and  a  considerable  distance  from  being  a   man.
Physically, he is in excellent shape, and  without  knowing
why, I suspect that he is better at individual sports  than
those requiring team effort.

It is  impossible  not  to  make  the  obvious  comparisons
between us.  At Adam's age I was a daring  and  adventurous
youngster who  was  eager  to  experiment  with  life.   My
interest in athletic pursuits  was  not  encouraged  by  my
father.  My motivation to succeed in school was  even  less
aggressive, a problem compounded by fifth-generation wealth
and parents who did not care to focus my efforts with stern
words.  My performance was satisfactory in  most  subjects.
Only Art held my interest, yet it was still  surprising  to
my parents and their exclusive  friends  that  I  chose  to
pursue sculpture as a career.  The need  to  secure  income
and job security was tempered by the trust fund I inherited
from my grandfather, but  even  then  I  needed  more  than
occasional commissions to  maintain  my  self-respect.   My
ideal vocation  was  discovered  by  accident  when  I  was
requested by a gay friend to cover his graduate  course  in
sculpture while he attended to the imminent  death  of  his
lover.  Not only did I enjoy teaching and a  steady  income
for  remarkably  little  effort,  but  it   gave   me   the
opportunity to practice my art without  the  need  to  find
patrons.

"Maybe I better go wash  first,"  I  suggest  lightly.   "I
wouldn't want to get you dirty."

"It doesn't matter," he says with building uncertainty.

Adam's big eyes meet mine.  The vibes are overpowering, his
pretty face is irresistible.  There is nothing manly  about
him.  His features are delicate and soft, and  again  I  am
reminded again of a girl, a very attractive girl.  My  mind
soars as I engage his eyes and contemplate a face  that  is
more beautiful that words can describe.   Perhaps  that  is
why I am interested in boys.  It is a matter  of  aesthetic
preference.  Adam, like all boys prior to puberty, does not
have the flowing full curves of a  woman  or  the  muscular
angularity of a man.  Yet  he  possesses  form  in  perfect
measure.  I smile inwardly as I  remember  why  the  Greeks
admired boys.  I have no doubts that the boys who  affected
the Hellenistic poets and artists to immortalize them  were
no different to Adam.  The idea comes to me  of  preserving
his flawless perfection in bronze.   I  picture  his  naked
body in various poses, imagine the dull burnished luster of
green, gold, and brown metal, each detail  of  his  anatomy
recreated with superb accuracy, until model  and  copy  are
all but identical.  One boy is living flesh given  form  by
divine inspiration, the other boy is metal  wrought  by  my
hands with all the skill I possess.

With racing thoughts I imagine Adam in  classic  poses,  as
the 'Boy with a Shell to his Ear', as 'Ganymede Astride the
Eagle',  as  the  'Boy  with  a  Dolphin',  as  a   dancing
Dionysius, as Hermes, as a young Satyr  proudly  displaying
his thin but very stiff penis.  Adam  is  unequalled  as  a
model, superior to any boy of the great  sculptors  of  the
Renaissance and or Neo- Classical era.  I conceive of  Adam
in a  new  way.   It  will  be  an  original  and  powerful
expression of form and material that transcends all that  I
know.  A new work that will depart from  my  own  style  in
disturbing ways.  Purity and  innocence  will  emerge  from
depravity and base desires, something that is vile and ugly
transformed to become Adam's physical perfection.  Even  as
a  vague  concept,  the  idea  is   evocative,   surpassing
everything that I had undertaken so far.

I slide from under the car without speaking  to  Adam.   My
heart is pounding rapidly, as much from thinking about  the
possibility of having sex with the  startlingly  attractive
youngster as by the potential of having him as a  model  in
my studio.  He follows me eagerly, no different to  when  I
followed another man.  He stands up and suddenly I  realize
how much taller I am than he is.  The top of  his  head  is
below my breast.  His  golden-blond  hair  is  tousled  and
tangled like the uncombed silk of corn.  He looks up at me,
his green-tinted blue eyes imploring me not to deny him the
affection he seeks.  I smile  at  him  fondly  and  try  to
convey  my  feelings.   He  watches  as  I  rub  my   hands
vigorously with orange-scented hand cleaner, turning  cream
to grey thick paste as the grease is removed.   I  wipe  my
hands.  We have not spoken for more than a minute.  I  feel
my excitement accelerating with  each  passing  second.   I
cannot take my eyes away from him.

I feel like I am in love, and wonder whether it  is  merely
infatuation.  Space and time seem to stop while we stare at
each other in silence.  I cannot help but hope that  he  is
feeling the same thing that I am feeling, thinking the same
thoughts.  Suddenly I am gripped by a sense that everything
is  happening  too  quickly.    Reason   intervenes.    The
attraction between us is like two poles of the same magnet.
We are held apart  at  the  same  time  as  we  are  pulled
together.  His eyes seem to sparkle as his smile lingers.

"I think I need a shower," I say absently.

Adam grins and shrugs his thin shoulders.   His  eyes  meet
mine and I stare into his gaze, meeting such intense beauty
that I am awed.  I am  reminded  of  a  pure  white  marble
sculpture of Antinous, the boy loved by the Roman  Emperor,
Hadrian.

"Mom said I didn't have to be home until five,"  Adam  says
out of the blue.

I wonder what the time is.  It cannot be  much  after  2.00
p.m., I guess.  Three hours!  It is more than  enough  time
to get better acquainted with this marvellous  specimen  of
boyhood.  I know what I  will  say  even  without  thinking
about it.

"Well,...  uh,...  why don't you um,....  come  up  to  the
house with  me,...   and  er,...   you  can  wait  while  I
shower," I mutter nervously.  "We can fix your bike after I
clean up a bit."

My  heart  is  pounding  from  the  stress  of  issuing  an
invitation to the youngster.  I am like the spider  in  its
web, luring its prey closer until  I  can  embrace  it.   I
hunger to taste his innocence, my urgent desire now  beyond
my control.  Adam nods, and then brushes his  golden  locks
back  from  his  forehead.   He  is  so  different  to  the
late-teenage boys I have known that I am powerless to  stop
myself as the inevitable moment of truth approaches.

Adam meekly follows me out of the garage and up the stairs.
He trots behind me like an  obedient  servant  obeying  his
master's wish.  The loft above the garage is my studio  and
I stop  there  and  turn  to  face  my  companion.   Adam's
questioning eyes move around the room as if he is searching
for something.

"You're  an  artist!"   he  says  with  animated  interest.
"That's really cool."

I smile at him and observe the  same  bric-a-brac  that  he
sees.  My work is scattered everywhere it seems.   Most  of
it are marquettes for sculptures and detailed pieces that I
have been studying for my  latest  project.   The  complete
work, or rather the work in progress, is in the far  corner
of the loft and covered with dusty sheets.

"I'm a sculptor," I say.  "Although you might  not  realize
it in this mess."

I walk towards the sheets.  I lift them away and lower them
to the floor before  I  step  back.   The  afternoon  light
grazes the waxy surface of the work.  The  figure  is  nude
and is twisted among the coils of what at first appears  to
be a huge  python.   Only  later,  does  the  snake  become
recognized for what it is.  The man's penis  is  seen  only
when one studies the beginning and ending of the serpent.

"It's,...  it's his dick," Adam  bursts  out  hysterically.
"The snake is really his dick!  That's wild!"

"I certainly can't fool you," I reply with  mock  severity.
"It's supposed to be a serious work so you  aren't  allowed
to laugh.  It's  a  modern  interpretation  of  an  ancient
myth."

"Oh!  I'm sorry," Adam answers apologetically.  "It's  just
that,...  it's so big, it's weird."  He takes a breath.  "I
didn't mean to laugh.  I'm sorry."

Now it is my turn to laugh.  "I'm joking, Adam.  It's  okay
to laugh, especially when you have such a nice laugh."

"Oh!  You're not mad at me?"  he asks guiltily.

"Hardly!"

"Why,...  um,...  why is his  dick  that  big  for?"   Adam
grins cheekily.

I return his smile.  "Isn't yours that big?"  I tease.   He
shakes his head.  "Maybe you need to exercise it  more,"  I
suggest playfully.

He raises his eyebrows with an unspoken question  a  moment
before he averts his eyes.

"Who wants one THAT big, anyway?"  he jests.   "You'd  have
to drag it around behind you or  put  it  out  front  in  a
wheelbarrow.  You didn't answer my question," he adds.

"I didn't, did I?  You want to know why his cock is so big?
Well, it's called "The Last Man on Earth",...  and the idea
is that because he is the last man all he has left  is  his
penis, so he makes love to it.  It finally kills him."

Adam turns to look at the sculpture again.  This  time  his
eyes follow the curving thick pipe as it twists around  the
man's body.  The snake's head, the swollen glans  confronts
the human face, both sets of lips are parted and  ready  to
exchange a kiss.

"He's about to kiss his dick," Adam giggles.  "If I  really
scrunch up, sometimes I can just lick the end of mine."

I swallow and stare at him in surprise.  I  am  shocked  at
his lack of inhibition.

"Um, well when you're all alone, it's fun to try stuff like
that," I say weakly.

Adam continues to smile knowingly.   "That's  his  problem,
right?"  I nod slightly  at  this  beautiful  creature  who
graces my studio and admires my  work.   "If  he  does  it,
he'll probably drown."

My mind reels.  Adam is outrageous.  It is as if  he  knows
he is exciting me and wants to  arouse  me  even  more.   I
decide to play along with the little  extrovert.   He  does
not seem old  enough  to  know  about  semen  but  physical
development  and  sexual  curiosity  are  not   necessarily
related.

"What is IT?"  I  ask  teasingly.   "How  would  he  drown,
Adam?"

He grins and plays along.  We have progressed  a  long  way
beyond innuendo.  "You know!  If  he  cums  on  himself,...
Man, there'd have to be gallons of it."

"Oh, that!  You mean he wouldn't be able to swallow all  of
it?"  I ask.

Adam nods.  I am taken back  for  a  few  seconds  while  I
wonder what to say next.  It is impossible to believe  that
an eleven-year-old boy knows about swallowing.

"I'm surprised you know about that sort of  thing  at  your
age.  When I was eleven I had no  idea  what  cum  was,"  I
blurt out.

Adam shrugs and gives me a look of feigned amusement.   His
expression is one of worldly experience and not the curious
innocence that one should expect to see in a young boy.

"Well I do."

"You can't do it yet, can you?"  I add without meeting  his
eyes.  I am afraid he will see how nervous I am.

He shakes his tousled golden head  slightly.   However,  in
the space of just a few seconds his expression has  changed
completely.  Gone is the provocative youth.  A petulant boy
stands in his  place  with  pouting  uncertainty.   I  have
offended him by calling into question his maturity.

"I was twelve before I could do it," I continue.  "The real
fun is in practicing.  I think I used to jerk off every day
trying to cum.  I'm surprised I didn't wear it out."

Adam's smile returns in a flash.   "So  do  I,"  he  admits
without hesitation.

"Don't worry, you can't wear it out," I laugh.  "Enjoy what
you have, I always say."

"I do," he smirks.

I return his smile and we share a knowing look.  I feel his
eyes penetrate my mind, reading my thoughts as  if  he  was
reading a book.  His eyes are impossible to resist.   I  am
falling more in  love  with  him  with  every  second  that
passes.  With difficulty I endeavor to change  the  subject
away from where we are headed.

"You'd make a great model," I observe.  "Maybe I could talk
you into posing for a sculpture one day."

Adam smirks.  "Like him?"  he asks as he points at the work
in the corner of the loft.

"Not quite!  You wouldn't even have to  take  your  clothes
off unless you wanted to,"  I  suggest.   "Of  course  most
sculpture uses a nude model because the purpose is to  show
the human body."

"Um,..."  Adam hesitates.  "I guess I wouldn't mind,...  if
you never told anyone.  You'd have to promise?"

He has agreed and my heart rate soars as I contemplate  the
possibilities.  Again, I conceive of him as a young Adonis,
his perfect young body arched into a bow as he  leaps  into
his lover's arms.  Perhaps he is  Hyacinth,  regarding  his
own beauty as it is reflected back at  him.   And  then  my
image of a different form of sculpture returns in my  mind.
Adam's refined and graceful beauty is of such classic style
that he is eminently suited to a traditional expression  in
bronze.  However, I realize that there is much more  to  be
expressed through his body than mere  physical  appearance.
I am presented by an opportunity  to  challenge  my  normal
work with something new and exciting.

"What's wrong?"  Adam asks.  He interrupts my thoughts  and
I look up, startled by the idea that has formed again in my
mind.

"Nothing!  I was thinking of something," I mumble.  I  take
a deep breath.  "Contrast, Adam!  We communicate  ideas  by
contrast.  Did you know that?   Um,...   like  we  see  the
color white, actually we know white, only because  we  know
about black.  There's rough and smooth, fat and thin, young
and old, beautiful and ugly..."  I take another breath  and
interrupt my lecture.  He looks slightly confused.  "Do you
understand?  There is one thing and the  other  thing  that
sets it apart.   We  only  know  the  one  because  of  the
existence of the other."

"I guess," Adam equivocates as if the simple philosophy  is
beyond him.
