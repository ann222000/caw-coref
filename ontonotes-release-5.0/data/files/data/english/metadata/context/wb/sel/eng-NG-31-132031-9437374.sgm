My Hacker will be here Friday but I am already thinking about
something that will soar. . .

My first inclination is to put that NEU motor in a Cheezy with 4S.
This would of course mean that I would have to add 30$ worth of carbon
fiber and it wouldn't glide for chit.  I dont want another heavy
plane.

So how about the opposite:  Cheezy Star Light

I want to make a cheezy that is powerful yet gives up none of its
floaty appeal.

I keep thinking back to my very first flight *(as in -- first electric
flight ever --)* with the cheezy.  I was scared to land it so I caught
it right out of the air.  SWEET!  I want that slow flying, graceful,
floaty feeling again.  I want to be able to float the plane right into
my hands.

Maybe a small 4S TP Extreme pack and a 400 type inrunner that is
severely over powered.  Say. . .  Sub 50g motor and sub 150g pack.

I want the AUW to be less than the bone stock setup but I want a burst
power of over 100W / lb.

That should do it.

I hope you're not thinking of putting the Nue motor for this
application.  It will work, but no high G maneuvers.  That motor will
work to bring you up to altitude fast and just soar and glide, but
that's about it.  I can tell you though.  I have lots of carbon on my
plane, and that thing still glides and floats forever.  My neck gets
tired sometimes watching it float in the air.  I've seen EZs fly with
only 2s on the stock motor and the wing still flexes like crazy.  Your
idea of 50g motor with 150g pack will work if all you want to do is
fly slow and float.

Dave, how's the EZ coming along?

JT, that's why you need a slouching lawn chair to sit on while you
fly :)

hopefully I can get out there by this weekend, I basically had to
rebuild the motor mount on my ME109 and I think I'm about done for
now...

Yeh, that would be cool, but people might look at me funny.  Sometimes I fly the EZ so high that I'm afraid to run into a real plane.  Literally a speck in the sky.

Let me know when your plane is done, so we can go fly.

Planes fly over here as low as 100' (not an exaggeration)

All of Livermore is in the flight path.  Our old house was 1 mile from
the airport and some times even the jets would come over so low that
you could feel the washout.

Hey Patrick,
Are you still gonna pursue this gig?  Here's the reason I'm asking.
Yesterday I flew with Tom, and he claims his EZ or Kamikaze if you'd
like can stay in the air longer than mine on one pack.  Well, we all
know the Cheesy can stay in the air forever giving some wind, so one
pack is way too much as I'm not gonna stare at it for over 30 mins.
So, here's the dealio.  I was thinking of having an informal
competition to see who's Cheesy can stay up the longest, but here's
the catch.  You only get one 15 secs. burst to climb to altitude and
then cut the motor.  The time starts the moment the plane leaves your
hand and stops when it touches the ground.  What do you think?  We
have about 4 Cheesies in the group if you're in.  No one has committed
yet, so I'm just gauging interest.  Any motor and battery combo
allowed as this only for fun.  And what do you win???  Bragging
rights.......LOL.

I like the competition idea too.  BUT I think JTs EZ would be the
favorite because it can go vertical to reach altitude quickly while my
little 2cell banger has to claw its way up there.  But it would be fun
to have 4 5 6 EZs up there going for max air time.
