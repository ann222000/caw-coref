Pumpkin Creme Brulee

Yield: 4 servings

2 cups heavy cream
4 large egg yolks
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
Pinch ginger
Pinch nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup fresh pumpkin
1/2 cup sugar, plus 1/3 cup for the topping

Directions:

The creamy texture and crispy burnt sugar crust are a winning combination.
You can make the custard the day before and brulee the top just before serving.

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a medium saucepan heat the cream,
cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg over medium heat, stirring occasionally until it
begins to boil. Remove from the heat and allow to sit for 10 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the yolks with 1/2 cup sugar. Whisk
until light in color and the sugar has dissolved. Pour in the warm cream,
whisking continually. Whisk in the pumpkin and vanilla.

3. Place 4 6-ounce ovenproof ramekins in a large roasting pan. Fill the
ramekins with the pumpkin mixture. Place the roasting pan on the center shelf of
the oven. Carefully pour hot water into the roasting pan, being careful not to
get any into the ramekins. Add enough water to come halfway up the ramekins.
Bake for 25 to 35 minutes until the custard is set but still jiggles slightly.
Remove from the oven and cool. Refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight.

4. Sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup sugar over the tops of the chilled
custards. Use a pastry torch to brown the sugar; or, place the ramekins on a baking
sheet under a broiler about 4 inches from the heat until the tops brown and
bubble, about 1 to 3 minutes. Let cool for 3 minutes and serve.
