We've been unschooling (in the academic sense) for about a year now; during
that time, we've also been moving more toward radical, whole-life
unschooling.  All in all, things are going well:  I have curious, vibrant,
polite boys, ages 9, 7, 4, and 1 1/2.  But every so often, I have doubts,
and today seems to be one of those days.

The boys have been on the computer a lot lately.  When they're not on the
computer, they're frequently watching TV.  Today, lunch consisted of a box
of Sponge Bob cheese crackers washed down with drinkable yogurt. These are
the kinds of things that make me feel uneasy sometimes:  When I realize that
other kids their ages can write and read and spell, and they're spending
days mostly on the computer or watching TV. (I know these are my own issues,
and hold overs from what I was taught was normal, was right).

To be fair, my kids do other things as well -- one's working on a scrapbook
of what he wants for Christmas, one submitted his 4-H Reporter article
yesterday; we play games, read, etc.  The oldest can read; they're all
experimenting with letters and numbers in their own way.

But I worry that the computer and TV have become &quot;easy&quot; for them -- the
fallback thing to do.  I worry that they've fallen into the habit of getting
on the computer in the morning, and do it out of habit, rather than out of
conscious choice.

I worry too about my toddler.  He's the first one who's been this age when
we've been more relaxed about TV, and I worry that unlimited access is
making it a habit for him too (if, for instance, I turn the TV on and put in
Bob the Builder or Elmo every time he wants me to).  I have been, but that's
now the first thing he asks for in the morning when we come downstairs, when
he gets out of the high chair and many other times during the day as well.
Previously, my parenting style would have been to leave it off most of the
time, to redirect him, to help him find more &quot;productive' things to do.  I
realize that that style negates his inherent desires, and says I'm better at
finding useful things to do than he is (and that some things are useful and
some are not), but I guess I wonder how this all works out.  I guess I lack
confidence, yet, in this new style, and am looking for some advice, support
and encouragement.

-=-But I worry that the computer and TV have become &quot;easy&quot; for them

Puritan ethics say easy equals sin.

Writing is easy for me; should I stop doing it?

Are they learning?  Are they content, calm, joyful?

&quot;Fallback&quot; meaning what?  When one uses an idiom in expressing vague
confusion, it's very useful to try to rephrase the statement.  It's
easy to parrot the concerns of others by using their words.  If you
can paraphrase yourself to yourself sometimes you catch that you were
speaking to yourself in someone else's voice--voices in your head,
guilt, habit...   Maybe that's the fallback message within you. &lt;g&gt;

-=-I worry that they've fallen into the habit of getting on the
computer in the morning, and do it out of habit, rather than out of
conscious choice. -=-

One of the first things I do in the morning is check my e-mail.
The first thing my husband does when he gets to work is check his e-
mail, and then his web comics and the Norsefolk discussion list or
some such thing.  He gets in earlier than anyone else, and by the
time the rest get there, he's ready to brief them on meeting changes
and news of the project.  That's a GOOD habit!  It's also a
consciously chosen habit.    He also goes to bed by 10:30 each night,
so he can consistently get up at 5:00 to get to work early enough to
do all that.  That's pretty conscious, but it's also easy for him.
It's also &quot;fallback&quot; and it's also habit.

But your redirection could (probably would) be toward something he
wanted and liked less, something less inspiring for him, something
less musical and less colorful.

Look at them as full instead of empty, and as rich instead of lacking.
That might be the only tweak you need.

Don't say stuff like this.

I'm saying that bluntly so people will really get the point.

Don't even talk/think about &quot;being on the computer&quot; or &quot;watching tv&quot;
as if whatever they are actually, in fact, DOING, is unimportant.

You really cannot provide the kind of support and encouragement
unschooling kids need unless you get past thinking of &quot;being on the
computer&quot; or &quot;watching tv&quot; as the thing they're doing.

Instead, look at the reality. What are they DOING? Are they playing
games? What kinds of games? Any game in particular? Watching what?
Game shows? Movies? Anime? Cartoons? Sitcoms from the 70's?

Support their interests. Encourage their passions. Don't discount or
ignore those interests and passions because they look, to you, like
just being &quot;on the computer&quot; or &quot;watching tv.&quot;

When you look at what REALLY interests them, what they are passionate
about, you'll then be able to see the connections between what they
are doing and many other things in the world and you'll be able to
help them see those connections. One thing will lead to another,
naturally, and you'll help them expand their experience of the world.

Get into it. Play. Watch. Encourage them to tell you all about it.
Look for connections.

Stop counting the hours. Stop waiting for them to lose interest in
the thing they are interested in.

Support their interests and, in doing so, expand their world.

What do you mean by write? Read? Spell?

We have adult visions of what those mean, but the definitions they
use in school are different. Reading in school doesn't mean being
able to pick up any book and read the words. It doesn't mean being
able to spell any word you feel like writing.

At 2 my daughter could say Pachycephalosaurus before she could say
Kathryn. If she'd been tested she would have failed since
Pachycephalosaurus wouldn't have been on any pronunciation test for 2
yos.

Are all kids their ages doing all of those things even by school
standards?

How do the ones who can't feel about themselves when &quot;everyone&quot;
around them can do what they're &quot;supposed&quot; to?

Kids learn to read and write and spell at various ages. When allowed
to learn when they're developmentally ready they pick it up just
fine. Kids in school feel ashamed that there's something wrong with
them when the only difference is they won't be ready to understand
until later. Often they decide the skills are dumb (to protect
themselves) or something to avoid because of all the negative
associations with it.

It's really helpful to your kids not to compare them to some ideal
that even schools don't achieve. See your kids as individuals who
will blossom when they're ready. Schools don't have that luxury so
they pressure kids to conform to some standard.

Do those who can read and write and spell do it because they enjoy
it? Or are they jumping through hoops because they have to? Is that
what you want? How would they be better at being 9 and 7 if they
could read and write and spell? Do you want your kids to perform
academic tricks to make you feel better? It's a good question to ask
yourself!

Pam's advice was good, and maybe an analogy would be &quot;reading a book.&quot;

There are all KINDS of things in books--fantasy, romance, adventure,
mysteries, history, anthropology, archeology, astronomy, recipes,
sewing patterns, leatherwork, cars, motorcycles, birds, dinosaurs,
viruses, plumbing, games, puzzles, art, mummification, bridge
construction and failure, maps, religion, fairies, museum displays,
weaving, knitting, crochet, tatting, naillbinding, netting, welding,
Japanese swords, icebergs, ships, imagined star ships, reclaimed
sailing ships with all their cargo...

The range of what's on TV and in the computer is the same and more.
Books don't really have music (to hear) or moving images (not
counting some kind of tab-pulling pop-up situations, which are VERY
cool in themselves too, or moiree figures, also cool, which are in
books).

I could say more, and I have!

It's because of posts like Pam's which I've read gazillions of times
that I've been able to love seeing ds playing.  And that means I don't
feel any worse about a tv or a computer than I do about an action
figure or toy soldier or legos; nor any worse about a comic book than
a coloring book.

Automatically when I view all the above I see how wide ds'
opportunities are and there's a lot of joy in that.  I love to hear
what he says about those things, to see him engrossed in them and
watch him happily being.  I like knowing he's rich in interests and
I'll only know it when I'm not ignoring who he is right now.

This made me laugh out loud.

My husband's family are builders by trade. To them, &quot;working&quot; means
swinging a hammer, hauling lumber, working with your hands to make
material objects in the world.

Grandpa, who is still building houses at nearly 75 years of age, does
not understand computers *at all*. They are not part of his world. And
he doesn't think I'm working when I'm sitting at the computer. I am a
technical editor at a large technology company. My immediate team of
coworkers are scattered all the way around the globe, and so my
computer is on and chat program is up for long stretches of time, so
that people can ping me from where they are, from when they are, about
whatever projects we're working on, collaboratively.

To Grandpa, it looks like I'm goofing off on the computer all day,
chatting with my friends. He has said as much to my husband. He is
genuinely baffled that I can make money, and even support the family,
by sitting on my butt, doing emails, chats, and phonecalls all day.
That isn't work, to him, and he does not respect it as such. I've
tried to explain what I do to him, once or twice, but he's simply not
interested. At his age, &quot;work&quot;=&quot;hammers&quot; and anything else just goes
through him.

It doesn't offend me; it's an interesting statement about preconceived
notions about the value of another person's activity. And I'm a
grown-up, with a fairly solid sense of my own value, and a paycheck
which reflects the value my employer places on my activity, so it's
not crushing.

But you can believe me, that I *never* look at my child, flopped out
in front of the screen playing games, and think he's doing nothing.
Not ever.

Maybe the discomfort lies in not whether something is easy or not, but the difference between consuming and producing. Watching tv is passive, writing about what you watched is active.

&quot;Fallback&quot; meaning it takes less energy, ie. it's passive. Thats where the puritanical work ethics come in, it feels right to just do something, anything, even if it's the wrong thing.
Or maybe I'm mixing my puritans up with my germans? lol

I think it's an instinct for parents to try for a balance environment (a healthy workable mix of active and passive)  so kids can learn the secret of keeping their lives in balance. But it's like teenagers learning to drive a car, you have to sit in the passenger seat and let them have a go at it or they'll never ever learn.

If someone is reading a book, the &quot;action&quot; is just sitting, eyes moving.
That might be producing, within them, all KINDS of new thoughts and
connections and the ability and inspiration to go out and DO
something wonderful.

If that same person were painting vegetable cans as pencil boxes,
that would be productive, in the sense that they're rearranging
elements in the world to create new things, but honestly, no one ever
has or ever will need a painted can to keep pencils in.

Much of what is &quot;produced&quot; is more than worthless.  It's a blight.
The very ugly, very cheap baby dolls and stuffed animals that fill
thrift store will eventually be in landfills and incinerators.  All
those factory workers and owners might have been more destructive
than constructive in the long run.

I bet the father of the 3rd grader that was choking to death and was saved by the friend who learned the Heimlich maneuver on TV would beg to differ. There is a lot of learning in watching TV.
Learning is productive.

&quot; to go out and DO something wonderful.&quot;

Exactly! Is learning without any accomplishments worthwhile?

I'm not expressing my own personal opinion, just trying to piece together the what and why of that collective cultural standard called work ethic.

We value the action of the man who saved the child. He was able take information, process it and make it useful.

If my son painted a can for me I would be thrilled out of my shoes. It has high value for me. Each person has a choice to make, go forward or hold back. Some people make bad decisions, some people make evil decisions. Overall I think the mind set of our culture values doing more than holding back. Is this a good thing? I don't really know. But I think it's short sighted to only look at the bad that comes from going out and trying.

My brain is tingling, after four hours of housework, I thought I might have permanently lost sensation up there.

Yes.

-=-We value the action of the man who saved the child. He was able

What about all the people who know the Heimlich maneuver but haven't
used it.  Is that worthwhile?
What if my whole life goes by and I never need to use the Heimlich
maneuver on anyone?

-=-If my son painted a can for me I would be thrilled out of my

What if your son mastered Final Fantasy X?  Would you be less thrilled?

What if your son painted a can because someone suggested that was a
better use of his time than playing a game?

Let's not be short sighted, heaven forfend.

Let's talk about our real experiences with real life, though, and not
hypotheticals, whenever we can.

I have three children:  16, 18 and 19.  They don't make evil
decisions.  They might not be &quot;productive&quot; by a definition that
values painted pencil cans over curiosity and making connections
between the movie we saw this afternoon and other movies and music
and stories.   Marty and Holly were talking about Beowulf, and the
changes, and Marty was talking about the religious interests of the
[director? screenwriter?] who also wrote American Gods, a book Marty
likes.  I didn't see Beowulf, but Holly and Marty did, last night.

We didn't &quot;produce&quot; anything by watching those movies.  In January
we're having a two and a half hour discussion of Beowulf (not the
movie, the original writing and how it's been oddly used as English
literature), with eight or a dozen other people.  My kids will be
more prepared for that discussion, but the discussion itself won't be
&quot;productive.&quot;  They won't get college credit.  They'll just be
discussing Beowulf for fun.
