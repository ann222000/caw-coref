So you're leaving the house again at O dark hundred, I see!

I'll let others know and if I'm not up too late on Friday myself, I may join you.

See you then!

Jackie

Hi Jackie,

I had a great time flying with Tim today. My head is still spinning a
bit!

I spoke to him about the several issues we discussed.

He wants to do the practice day on the 26th at Delano. He thinks most
of the noise complaints originated from some low level practice by Bill
Cornick and a few other pilots who used the low level waiver to fly
jets. He's trying to get them to use the concrete plant box in APV so
they don't make the relationships around Delano any worse than they
are. He thinks one day of practice in preparation for the contest will
be OK.

He didn't offer his hangar for storage of Chap 49 stuff but suggested
we might use a storage thing called a POD? He can tell you more about
it. It sounds like a portable container that can be moved when we need
it. Sounds economical too.

As far as future Delano chapter issues, he's interested in joining
forces for collaborative meetings and events. We should talk more about
that at the practice day.

That's it for my reporter skills. It sounds like we should post the
practice day at Delano on the Google group. If you still feel
uncomfortable about the 26th, call him directly and let me know if you
want me to post something.

Best,
Margo

Awesome Margo,

I'm glad that Tim thinks that it is OK! It was not because I did not want to have it, but wanted to be careful about the whole noise situation. Thanx for speaking with him!!

So glad you had a GREAT ride with Tim -- I am so happy for you!

If I can't make it to the practice session (which I would love to do, but don't know if I will be flying at the contest myself) I will see you guys later that week!

I do know about PODs but don't know the cost -- we will look into it.

Again, thanx so much!!
