Burrt is due a colour change,  as the red paint Tim painted it with is
not so hot finish wise, and is starting to flake.  S for the past two
days I have been sanding back the roof (which never got painted and
had just a couple of layers of olive drab) and the nearside.

You may remember Tim spent ages prepping the body for repainting when
he first got burrt, but even he admittied he got bored spraying.

Both the roof and nearside have been sprayed with etch primer, and
then rollered with high build primer.  The roof has had 3 layers of
white gloss on it.  I have a cunning plan that the white gloss may
help to keep summer sun heat down through reflection (you don't see
caravans or motor homes with anything other than roofs that are white,
or allied shades.)

I think I may upset a few rivet counters with our chosen scheme.  The
idea is that we (father and I) will be able to rock up to vintage
shows with one of these on the back, and a 101 painted to match....

we used to have one before we sold it along with farm, and its younger
brother

had the live drive setup.

I prefer the darker blue of the earlier major, always have done!

Dawn has got some work to do this week because I go back to work
tomorrow, although the little bugers aren't back until friday, or else
it could well end up going to peterborough in primer grey down one
side with the rest of the panels just sanded!!!!!!

Harry like helping too, he managed to find the primer tray, so we have
little grey baby handprints everywhere!!

good luck!

I cant see how blue will upset anybody anymore than red! ;)

I wouldnt worry too much about the roof finish - nobody ever seeis it
closely anyhow!

painting mine silver made it much cooler inside. my roof is half
shiney silver chequer plate and half brush painted silver hammerite.

Why do you think Tims paint has flaked? he did etch prime it didnt he
so it shouldnt have done?

It does take a lot of painting to do a whole ambi! I think i managed
one side per day when doing mine (spraying etch, primer then top)

Not so keen on the white top idea myself, never mind the rivet counters
you'll have the fashion police kicking the door in.

The roof will stand out like a sore thumb when you greenlane and be on
nearly every photo that anyone takes. My still Camo'd one was bad enough..
soom walloped it the same as the rest after seeing photos as above.

Personally I'd cover the roof with some ally strips or box section then add
sheets of chequre plate on the top. the stips / box section provide an air
flow between the real roof and the chequre plate. If you really went to town
then get some scrap safari vents and install them, there is 4 in the back of
a LWB and SWB safari. The truck can then be left with the vents open even in
the rain as they are cunningly sheltered by the chequre plate above - Also
the draught generated under the chequre plate even when stationary will draw
all the hot air (ok maybe not all it's a 101!) out of the vehicle. I was
going to go down this route possibly using a 109 roof hinged to make a roof
tent / room.

Colours are very garish - good choice!  ;-)

I know many 101 were painted odd colours so as not to get shot at when
driving anywhere their may be an American military unit.... but some colours
may get you declined entry to the country at the border. :-)

Could you not bolt an actual Safari top on - size can't be that far
off.

Neat idea. I may have to nick it.

I can't claim it as mine though as LR have been doing it for donkeys years.

It really does make a big difference too as I experienced on my IIa.

the eventual idea is to have some of the fancy tie down channel that
you see on the back of pickup trucks where you insert a little buckle
thing, twist it and then fix ratchet straps onto that.  That way I can
fix some storage boxes up the top, so being able to walk on the roof
will be essential.  Lack of space when travelling as a family is an
issue unless we take the small trailer, and the ferry charges less for
a vehicle the height of a 101 with roof boxes, than for a 101 with a
trailer!

Cant remember the name of the stuff, but Martyn has some on his roof.

Chequer plate the thing ;) good for walking on and the shinyness seems
to help!

My Stage One had a safari roof - it really does work. Cheaper than aircon
