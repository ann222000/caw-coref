Thoreau speaks about the need to have simple, functional clothes.
Skinner, as well, speaks to the clothing and fashion of Walden Two.
Skinner's Walden is a little more fashion conscious than is Thoreau's
Walden.

A line that stands out for me is Thoreau's:

&quot;No man ever stood the lower in my estimation for having a patch in
his clothes; yet I am sure that there is greater anxiety, commonly, to
have fashionable, or at least clean and unpatched clothes, than to
have a sound conscience.&quot;

Which echoes the Confucian notion of how people appreciate beauty more
than they appreciate benevolence. Which seems to be akin to Skinner's
point about how the push-pull causality of physics and chemistry are
very conspicuous forces. Evolution, or similar selective mechanisms
like operant conditioning, are less conspicuous.

Clothing, and beauty, are conspicuous. A sound conscience and
benevolence are less so.

The kind of changes or adaptation we should make to have a sound
conscience is definitely different from that of shopping at a store or
making sure our clothes are clean and unpatched.

Walden Two, I think, is Skinner's attempt at having a community which
has both clean, unpatched clothes and a sound conscience. That Thoreau
chooses to contrast a conscience and clothes seems somewhat strained,
although the history of textile production is one that has often
involved the exploitation of labor. The role of slavery in cotton
production was definitely known to Thoreau and might have been subtly
a part of this passage.

The over-riding message is clearly that we should be willing to
tolerate some lowering of our aesthetics to allow for the more
important moral imperatives to have their way. That we should be more
keen on respecting the wealthy - honest or not - over the poor who may
have committed no crimes against their fellow person is cause for
alarm.

Thoreau's point seems to be about class differences as much as
clothing as such. Skinner's Walden is essentially a society with
classes. There is no group in Skinner's Walden that has clean clothes
while others are dirty. No group in Skinner's Walden has patched
clothes while others have new ones. No group in Skinner's Walden
acquired wealth while others go poor. No group is respected while
others are scorned.

The original:
&quot;[14]    As this business was to be entered into without the usual
capital, it may not be easy to conjecture where those means, that will
still be indispensable to every such undertaking, were to be obtained.
As for Clothing, to come at once to the practical part of the
question, perhaps we are led oftener by the love of novelty and a
regard for the opinions of men, in procuring it, than by a true
utility. Let him who has work to do recollect that the object of
clothing is, first, to retain the vital heat, and secondly, in this
state of society, to cover nakedness, and he may judge how much of any
necessary or important work may be accomplished without adding to his
wardrobe. Kings and queens who wear a suit but once, though made by
some tailor or dressmaker to their majesties, cannot know the comfort
of wearing a suit that fits. They are no better than wooden horses to
hang the clean clothes on. Every day our garments become more
assimilated to ourselves, receiving the impress of the wearer's
character, until we hesitate to lay them aside without such delay and
medical appliances and some such solemnity even as our bodies. No man
ever stood the lower in my estimation for having a patch in his
clothes; yet I am sure that there is greater anxiety, commonly, to
have fashionable, or at least clean and unpatched clothes, than to
have a sound conscience. But even if the rent is not mended, perhaps
the worst vice betrayed is improvidence. I sometimes try my
acquaintances by such tests as this — Who could wear a patch, or two
extra seams only, over the knee? Most behave as if they believed that
their prospects for life would be ruined if they should do it. It
would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken leg than with
a broken pantaloon. Often if an accident happens to a gentleman's
legs, they can be mended; but if a similar accident happens to the
legs of his pantaloons,(10) there is no help for it; for he considers,
not what is truly respectable, but what is respected. We know but few
men, a great many coats and breeches. Dress a scarecrow in your last
shift, you standing shiftless by, who would not soonest salute the
scarecrow? Passing a cornfield the other day, close by a hat and coat
on a stake, I recognized the owner of the farm. He was only a little
more weather-beaten than when I saw him last. I have heard of a dog
that barked at every stranger who approached his master's premises
with clothes on, but was easily quieted by a naked thief. It is an
interesting question how far men would retain their relative rank if
they were divested of their clothes. Could you, in such a case, tell
surely of any company of civilized men which belonged to the most
respected class? When Madam Pfeiffer,(11) in her adventurous travels
round the world, from east to west, had got so near home as Asiatic
Russia, she says that she felt the necessity of wearing other than a
travelling dress, when she went to meet the authorities, for she &quot;was
now in a civilized country, where ... people are judged of by their
clothes.&quot; Even in our democratic New England towns the accidental
possession of wealth, and its manifestation in dress and equipage
alone, obtain for the possessor almost universal respect. But they who
yield such respect, numerous as they are, are so far heathen, and need
to have a missionary sent to them. Beside, clothes introduced sewing,
a kind of work which you may call endless; a woman's dress, at least,
is never done.&quot; http://thoreau.eserver.org/walden1b.html
