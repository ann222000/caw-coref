So he could entrap him with a complaint because at some point in the

BINGO!

I never had any intention of answering him. Aside from the entertainment value furnished
by his delusions of grandeur, and his masochistic need to be as offensive as possible so
as to have scorn heaped on him from all corners (thereby feeding his martyr complex), I
have no use for the guy.

I resisted even commenting to the group about his latest wackiness, simply to avoid
contributing to his delusional malady. But since the thread has continued this far, I
feel obliged to acknowledge the entertaining and insightful commentary. Further silence
would just be rude, after all.

Say what you will about the UberKook, he is entertaining. It's a bit of a guilty pleasure
to witness his ongoing self-debasement. But God help me, it's funny as hell. And since it
obviously makes him happy too, where's the harm in taking in the show?

I appreciate what you're saying, Bob. But this is a collaborative public service effort. In
its Usenet incarnation, this was originally a collaboration between Tees Reitsma and myself.
(Before that, she labored alone in print and fax distribution.) After her untimely death last
year (August 8), her Dutch colleague Janneke Maat has taken up Tees' end of the work, and I
continue at this end as before. And the whole idea is not to be proprietary, but to be a
public service. Rather than try to control networking among astrologers and other interested
parties, the objective is to distribute information as freely and as far and wide as possible.

&gt; Great!  Maybe we can get to the bottom of this.  Would you please be
&gt; kind enough to supply the names of a couple psychologists and
&gt; academicians who find you to be a &quot;respected couselor [sic]&quot;  I'd

it.

You can find many books on Pluto by astrologers--if you were really
interested that is, just search amazon.com.
No one said that Pluto represents the transformed ego--it CAN reflect a
transformation of ego, but one cannot tell the level of transformation
just by Pluto unless they are:
A) A skilled astrologer with complete data or
B) They have thoroughly inteviewed the client in question.

You are welcome, however, I do not reveal clients or colleagues names
or identities as it would be unethical and all the spinics would do is
harass them like all the clients they DID know I had online who
revealed themselves.

In the Movie Excalibur, Merlin the magician said after victory by King
Arthur over evil throughout the land;

"Be silent,  be still, that's it. And look upon this moment. Savor it.
Rejoice with great gladness, great gladness. Remember it always, for
you are joined by it, you are one under the stars! Remember it well
then, this night, this great victory. So that in the years ahead you
can say, 'I was there that night, with Arthur the King!

For it is the doom of men that they forget."

The archives still evidence who is the King around here.

I agree, which is why I have long appended the following text at the bottom of
the conference agenda:

For details on astrological Newsgroups, Mailinglists, Newsletters, "Astrologie in
Nederland" &amp; "Agenda voor Nederland" go to:

Thanks for the tip, Bob. Honestly, I wouldn't feel right prohibiting anyone -
even the most outrageous kook - from networking this information. No one has
exclusive ownership of a collaborative volunteer public service project. Anyone
who tries to claim ownership will thereby kill off the volunteer collaboration.

&gt;&gt;That is an interesting claim, Mr. Wollmann. Perhaps you would be
&gt;&gt;so kind as to supply evidence of your high marks and graduation?

&gt; Claim?? Bwahahahahahahahahahaahahahaha!

Indeed; it is a VERY silly claim. There is no evidence to support it.
You see now why no one believes you?

Why ON EARTH would you be so reluctant to simply post evidence of your
alleged degrees, unless you don't really have them?

There's nothing harassing in asking you to simply show your credentials.
That's what credentials are for, dumbfuck.

Yes. What is it about astrology that has made you so fucking insane that
you call everyone who questions you a "stalker"?

Liar. You claimed you still had course work to make up months later.

As to the plagiarism thang, it was reported to SDSU and suddenly you're
persona non grata there. I guess that double major included that BA in
clinical psych that SDSU never offered. while you're at it, let's talk
about that Masters Track at Kepler that didn't exist and probably never
will, you fucking phony.
