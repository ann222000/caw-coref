*ZooLib Cookbook* &lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1211 &gt;
ZooLib is a cross-platform application framework. What it allows you to do
is to write a single set of C++ sources and compile for different operating
systems and microprocessors to produce native executable applications with
very little need for platform-specific client code. This is of great benefit
to a developer, as it allows you to support your application on a variety of
platforms without a lot of extra work developing parallel codebases. It also
allows you to spend the bulk of your time developing on whatever platform
you enjoy the most while delivering for the platforms your users need, even
if they're not the same.

*Reusable Software Components* &lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1212 &gt;
This book introduces you to new and useful techniques of programming
microcontrollers with the high level language C. The concept of reusable
components evolved from research aimed at object oriented programming for
microcontrollers in C. It was found that classes written in C can be
packaged as components for easy reuse and modification needed to extend
their capability. In this book you will learn how to create classes in C.
Instances of these classes are objects, and within the limites of the
microcontroller and other peripherals, as many instances of these objects as
are needed can be created. We call these classes components. Such software
components have advantages over the corresponding hardware components. In
the construction of components, we can apply the concepts of inheritance and
polymorphism. Inheritance allows extension of the basic component to meet
new requirements without modification of the basic class code. Polymorphism,
or late bindig, permits the program to select one of several alternative
functions or methods, the choice of which to execute cannot be determined
until run time. It will be found that careful application of polymorphism
can allow a savings of program code.

*C++ in action* &lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1213 &gt;
My work at Microsoft gave me the unique experience of working on large
software projects and applying and developing state of the art design and
programming methodologies. Of course, there are plenty of books on the
market that talk about design, programming paradigms, languages, etc.
Unfortunately most of them are either written in a dry academic style and
are quite obsolete, or they are hastily put together to catch the latest
vogue. There is a glut of books teaching programming in C, C++ and, more
recently, in Java. They teach the language, all right, but rarely do they
teach programming.
http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1213

*Optimizing C++* &lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1214 &gt;
Optimizing C++ provides working programmers and those who intend to be
working programmers with a practical, real-world approach to program
optimization. Many of the optimization techniques presented are derived from
my reading of academic journals that are, sadly, little known in the
programming community. This book also draws on my nearly 30 years of
experience as a programmer in diverse fields of application, during which I
have become increasingly concerned about the amount of effort spent in
reinventing optimization techniques rather than applying those already
developed.

*Who's Afraid of C++?* &lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1215 &gt;
Whether you are using this book on your own or in school, there are many
good reasons to learn how to program. You may have a problem that hasn't
been solved by commercial software; you may want a better understanding of
how commercial programs function so you can figure out how to get around
their shortcomings and peculiarities; or perhaps you're just curious about
how computers perform their seemingly magical feats. Whatever the initial
reason, I hope you come to appreciate the great creative possibilities
opened up by this most ubiquitous of modern inventions.

*Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days* &lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1216 &gt;
Computer languages have undergone dramatic evolution since the first
electronic computers were built to assist in telemetry calculations during
World War II. Early on, programmers worked with the most primitive computer
instructions: machine language. These instructions were represented by long
strings of ones and zeroes. Soon, assemblers were invented to map machine
instructions to human-readable and -manageable mnemonics, such as ADD and
MOV. In time, higher-level languages evolved, such as BASIC and COBOL. These
languages let people work with something approximating words and sentences,
such as Let I = 100. These instructions were translated back into machine
language by interpreters and compilers. An interpreter translates a program
as it reads it, turning the program instructions, or code, directly into
actions. A compiler translates the code into an intermediary form. This step
is called compiling, and produces an object file. The compiler then invokes
a linker, which turns the object file into an executable program. Because
interpreters read the code as it is written and execute the code on the
spot, interpreters are easy for the programmer to work with. Compilers,
however, introduce the extra steps of compiling and linking the code, which
is inconvenient. Compilers produce a program that is very fast each time it
is run. However, the time-consuming task of translating the source code into
machine language has already been accomplished. Another advantage of many
compiled languages like C++ is that you can distribute the executable
program to people who don't have the compiler. With an interpretive
language, you must have the language to run the program.

*Programming in C: UNIX System Calls and Subroutines using
C*&lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1217 &gt;
In order to use Solaris and most other Unix Systems you will need to be
familiar with the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). Before embarking on
learning C with briefly introduce the main features of the CDE. Most major
Unix vendors now provide the CDE as standard. Consequently, most users of
the X Window system will now be exposed to the CDE. Indeed, continuing
trends in the development of Motif and CDE will probably lead to a
convergence of these technologies in the near future. This section
highlights the key features of the CDE from a Users perspective.
http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1217

*Numerical Recipes in C* &lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1218 &gt;
The new and greatly expanded second edition of the highly popular Numerical
Recipes in C features over 100 new routines and upgraded versions of the
original routines. The book remains the most practical, comprehensive
handbook of scientific computing available today.
http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1218

*How to Think Like a Computer Scientist
(C++)*&lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1219 &gt;
The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. I
like the way computer scientists think because they combine some of the best
features of Mathematics, Engineering, and Natural Science. Like
mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas
(specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling
components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like
scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses,
and test predictions. The single most important skill for a computer
scientist is problem-solving. By that I mean the ability to formulate
problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly
and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an
excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That's why this
chapter is called 'The way of the program.' Of course, the other goal of
this book is to prepare you for the Computer Science AP Exam. We may not
take the most direct approach to that goal, though. For example, there are
not many exercises in this book that are similar to the AP questions. On the
other hand, if you understand the concepts in this book, along with the
details of programming in C++, you will have all the tools you need to do
well on the exam.

*Writing Bug-Free C Code* &lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1220 &gt;
This book describes an alternate class methodology that provides complete
data hiding and fault-tolerant run-time type checking of objects in C
programs. With it, you will produce code that contains fewer bugs. The class
methodology helps to prevent bugs by making it easier to write C code. It
does this by eliminating data structures (class declarations) from include
files, which makes a project easier to understand (because there is not as
much global information), which makes it easier to write C code, which helps
to eliminate bugs. This class methodology, which uses private class
declarations, is different from C++, which uses public class declarations.
The class methodology helps detect bugs by providing for both compile-time
and run-time type checking of pointers (handles) to class objects. This
run-time type checking catches a lot of bugs for you since invalid object
handles (the cause of a lot of bugs) are automatically detected and
reported. We have all, at some point in our programming careers, spent
several hours or days tracking down a particularly obscure bug in our code.
Have you ever stepped back and wondered how following a different
programming methodology might have prevented such a bug from occurring or
have automatically detected it? Or have you tracked down the same type of
bug several times?
http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1220

*The C Book* &lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1221 &gt;
This is not a tutorial introduction to programming. The book is designed for
programmers who already have some experience of using a modern high-level
procedural programming language. As we explain later, C isn't really
appropriate for complete beginnersâthough many have managed to use itâso the
book will assume that its readers have already done battle with the notions
of statements, variables, conditional execution, arrays, procedures (or
subroutines) and so on. Instead of wasting your time by ploughing through
tedious descriptions of how to add two numbers together and explaining that
the symbol for multiplication is *, the book concentrates on the things that
are special to C. In particular, it's the way that C is used which is
emphasized.
http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1221

*Data Structures and Algorithms with Object-Oriented Design Patterns
in C++*&lt; http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/1222 &gt;
This book was motivated by my experience in teaching the course E&amp;CE 250:
Algorithms and Data Structures in the Computer Engineering program at the
University of Waterloo. I have observed that the advent of object-oriented
methods and the emergence of object-oriented design patterns has lead to a
profound change in the pedagogy of data structures and algorithms. The
successful application of these techniques gives rise to a kind of cognitive
unification: Ideas that are disparate and apparently unrelated seem to come
together when the appropriate design patterns and abstractions are used.
