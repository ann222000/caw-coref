I mean no disrespect to the fundamentalists, but there are numerous
very beautiful and inspiring creation myths, some none more beautiful
than from socalled tribal or native people with long and time-honored
traditions.  No disrespect in the least to the western and Biblical
creation story.  But why is it that other accounts and creation
narratives get by-passed, over looked, sometimes just plain
IGNORED ???

Anyone have an answer?

Um, because fundamentalists, by nature, tend to be ignorant by
choice?

The problem with fundamentalists is, they can't be satisfied with the
lessons taught by the nice stories in the Bible. They have to believe
they're TRUE! Absolutely true, with no variation whatsoever. Forget
the fact that God actually created man and woman twice, using two
different methods, in the first two chapters... the whole thing is
TRUE, dammit!

If evolution is a fact, then Gawd couldn't possibly have created man
out of the dust and woman out of either dust or a rib, take your pick,
just 6000 years ago. Evolution would have taken millions of years, and
gosh... that's just impossible...

NOW do you know why so many other stories get ignored?

Yes. Christians are not the center of attention of those other
gods. It's all about ego. They need to be the center of the Universe.

Evolution IS theory!

They like to say &quot;Evolution is only a THEORY,&quot; but the fact is that,
as a theory, it is by far the most ACCURATE explanation that we have.
The &quot;Creationist explanation&quot; is so old and out of date, hence far
less accurate, as to be obsolete and useless.  Thus, it should be
labeled &quot;false.&quot;

Creationism is still around only because it was considered to be quite
accurate when it was adopted by Judaism and later Christianity some
two to four thousand years ago. Then, it was a more accurate then the
polytheistic mythology it replaced---such as that the world was
created by sexual relations between one of the Father Gods and the
Mother Goddess and was born out in her amniotic fluids, etc. etc.
Such earlier beliefs or theories were, in turn, more accurate than the
ones they, in turn, replaced.

What mankind comes to understand in life is all in a slow evolution---
social evolution.  It grows in accuracy over the centuries.  We have a
far more accurate understanding of ourselves and the world and
universe about us now than we did in the past.  We need to keep on
improving the accuracy that way, and one way is to keep investigating
nature so we can keep improving the accuracy of our understanding of
evolution.
This is the way reality and the universe are; the way science works.
