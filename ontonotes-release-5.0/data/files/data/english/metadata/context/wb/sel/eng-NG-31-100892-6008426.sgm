The problem is not with noisy channels. Information theory deals with the
quantitative aspects of information transfer, including how *data* can be
extracted from background noise. But *data* is not, strictly speaking,
information. Before data can become information it must be interpreted. A
string of bits is not, *per se*, information. It only becomes information
when it is decoded, using the same algorithm at the sink that was used to
encode it at the source. Often one can discover that encoding algorithm by
trial and error, and hypothesis testing (provided one has *some* information
about the source). But the message may remain permanently (for human
purposes) indecipherable. Unless the sink can decode the message (using the
same algorithm as the source), there will be *no* correlation in behavior.
Public key cryptography depends upon this intrinsic ambiguity in any string
of bits. Any longish string of bits can represent millions of possible
messages. Without the Rawlinson text (or something similar) the Sumerian
tablets would remain meaningless (and even with it much of the "meaning"
imputed is guesswork). They would contain data, but no information.

&gt;&gt; No, no! Can't make that move. All languages, all of their syntax and

&gt;&gt; carry on any kind of interpersonal communication) one must assume some
&gt;&gt; common fund of semantics and syntax exists between speaker and hearer.
&gt;&gt; That includes some logical rules. Suggesting that the LOC can be
&gt;&gt; interpeted differently cannot be used to invalidate any argument which
&gt;&gt; assumes it. It can only render communication between those speakers
&gt;&gt; impossible.

&gt; this is mathematically incorrect

&gt; communication is still possible

*Data* is still transferred. *Information* is not (because the data is not
being decoded using the encoding algorithm). You can discuss and challenge
the rules of an object language using a metalanguage. But then you and your
hearer must agree on the rules of that metalanguage, or you will not
communicate (you will not transfer information).

No disagreement there. As far as I can recall (and I haven't scoured Kant
today to verify this) Kant never says that *a priori* intuitions are
"infallible." Indeed, that sounds very un-Kantian. He only says that we
cannot conceive them to be false. He is making a claim about us, not the
universe. Nor is he making a claim about eternity, but only about present
humans contemplating present problems.

As I've suggested in other posts, I think the best way to think of the
synthetic *a priori* is as conceptual models of a set of low-level (and some
not so low-level) encoding routines ("microcodes") which have evolved in
tandem with our nervous systems. They can change in time. They can be
overridden for any given dataset by higher-order routines. The aim
throughout is to encode some dataset with an algorithm --- to compress it,
to extract order from chaos. And that requires arranging that data into some
kind of deductive structure, so that it becomes manageable and predictable.

Are axioms necessary? Yes, for any deductive structure. But there is always
a choice of structures to apply to a dataset. We adopt the simplest one with
the most predictive power (until we devise a better one). When such a
structure collapses we retreat to the simplest structures we have, and begin
building anew. Those simplest structures are the built-in "microcodes" which
we represent conceptually as various SAPs. Below those we cannot go.

Sure; supporters of some kind of a posteriori fundamentalism could
defend their radical empiricism by simply proclaiming that experience
follows lawful patterns in brute fashion. There's no need for normally
undetected substrates of neurons, atoms, and etc to actually be real,
which would undermine the phenomenal world in human perception as mere
appearances. Nature would only act as if everything emerged from such
microchemistry and Democritean entities (in fact, this seems to have
been the position of the Machian neutral monists, who were inspired by
Hume).

Yet, while they might be able to defend their views, they still
couldn't eliminate the a priori slash metaphysical folks. As Bertrand
Russell once pointed-out (but not at all in these exact words), naive
realism eventually screws itself by leading to things like
neuroscience, particle physics, and general relativity --providing
direct or indirect evidence for such. One can still assert naive
realism is possible, but naive realism traitorously allows indirect
realism to be possible too.

Your question is (*ahem*) question-begging. You implicitly define "reality"
as meaning knowledge gained from sensory experience ("things existing and not
requiring imagination"). Then you ask "What knowledge of reality is gained *a
priori*?"

Well, none, of course, because *a priori* knowledge is not gained via the
senses. Hence, by your definition, any knowledge known *a priori* would not
be knowledge of "reality."

However, much knowledge of "reality" (by your definition) existed in the
imagination long before it was encountered empirically. E.g., Riemannian
Geometry existed as an *a priori* construct of the imagination long before it
was found to describe the universe as portrayed by General Relativity.
Indeed, every invention exists in someone's imagination before it is ever
instantiated in the physical world.

Yes it is indeed so used. But unless we had that concept *a priori* we could
not recognize those relationships. It is what allows us to distinguish
present from past. Likewise with "space."

Nope other way round, I define knowledge as man's grasp of reality, and
sensory reality exists as it exists independent of man's mind, and it
exists in reality without contradiction, therefore non-contradictory
*identification* of what exists is an excellent standard to have to
determine man's knowledge of what is real.

I say that reason is man's only means of knowledge, reason I have
defined as, *non-contradictory identification and integration of the
perceptions of man's senses,*

(note I realize you Kantians all say that is not the definition of
reason and yet you all fail to give one, and also note, that IS the
meaning of reason I use)

There has to be something existing to experience, to gain the knowledge
of, you cant gain knowledge of nothing in reality.

Which is the fact of reality that Kant's expression *man's knowledge
comes from experience* ignores, e.g. the mystics claim knowledge of god
by claiming they have experienced it, and the mere fact they have had
an *experience* qualifies it as knowledge, according to Kant's silly
standard.

Knowledge is always the ***result*** of a *process*, I am saying that
*process*, to claim real knowledge, must be, non-contradictory
indentification of what exists in sensory reality as it exists, without
contradiction anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Thats just silly, man cant claim knowledge of nothing in reality,
mystics and Kantians excluded of course.

Knowledge doesn't result from imagination it results from
identification of reality.

Rubbish, geometry is a branch of mathematics, mathematics is the use of
numbers, numbers started out as a way to measure the quantity of
existent units, see if you can define the meaning and origin of
geometry without any link to sensory existence to test that idea.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Indeed, every invention exists in someone's imagination before it is ever

">

Nonsense, you are confusing imagination with a deliberate conscious
intent to identify and solve problems existing in sensory reality, each
and every invention starts out as man endevouring to solve a problem
existing originating in sensory reality.

The invention of numbers to measure existing units is a classic
example, the invention of the clock is another.

Existence is the axiom / primacy, then perceptions / experience, and
then non-contradictory identification and intergration of those
perceptions form knowledge, there are no short cuts, unless of course
you are Kantian, mystic, Zeno, Poppereen Bertran Russell, to name but a
few POC twits.

one thing i notice
is a fear of formalism

one of those "cues"
is that jos and knucmo and you, publius
have been reluctant to post to sci.math
or even sci.logic

but that is where this is formalised
and a well-developed theory is practised by some in those groups

so if you mistrust any formalism
do not fear putting it to the greatest inspection

it increases the chance of everyone learning something new

^^^^^%%%%%%%

the operationalist approach
looks to answer certain meaningful forms of questions:

WHAT CAN ONE LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE?

WHAT

it explores possible ontologies
-*  what can we name?

CAN
possible

ONE LEARN

it studies the process of learning
what does it mean to learn something?

FROM EXPERIENCE

sensation
the source

?

!!!!!!#########

there appears process

one can describe the acquisition of information structures
there are very good models of
channels of information acquisition (sensory systems)
how these can be learned by various algorithms

our internal manipulations appears highly symbolic
with symbols of muscle awareness and sensory forms
very good models connect these with a central system of processing

we map our internal symbologies
allowing us to metaphorically associate category errors

categories of utterance
and categories of sight

or

categories of smell
and categories of action

or

...

-------++++++++++++==

this system of transformation
is our decision process
it is our rationality

the symbols it forms
the information it receives

is well formalised

information is

every information transformation
is noise in the channel

that is extremely important to stress
information transformation is noise

you speak of interpretation and insist an a priori

yet

every neuron to neuron transmission
every dynamic of ion potentials

is contingent
it varies over time
and among all animals with the system

our symbols vary even in our own understanding

we can form meanings in contradiction

and often do

%%%%^*    @@@@@@$$)    %%%%^*

we find the noise helps

we don't need to maintain all the information
we can abstract
lie
distort into some symbolic form
and conceive a predictive model

symbols change
meanings change
but we can play games to agree on external symbols

this is the origin of language, economics, mathematics...

this is what kant wanted to do
he wanted to explain all of this

but all of this is contingent

you can go all the way down to the fundamental transfer
that is the information channel of our cognitions
and attempt to claim
this ontology is necessary
but that fails

every transformation could be otherwise

large scale regional structures still give structure
to this transformation process
and give the contingency tendencies towards usefulness

but there is no teleology
no necessity
no purpose

every transformation
is an accident of history
a result of evolutionary process
in a local thermodynamic cascade

there is no ground
no base absolute

in our cognitions
our perceptions
our epistemology

all a matter of error and learning
noise and transformation

this is actually wrong

information is transmitted in either case
and this is a very simple and fundamental result
in the formalisation of information theory

predictability is still possible

models of finite kolmogorov complexity
help us improve expectations even without interpretation

this is why the operationalist approach meaning in the way they do

meaning is possible with error

if an interpretation fails to bisimulate experience
we may still have had good prediction

newton?

the a priori is not even "microcode"
it is not this statement against the a priori

i have been wrong many times
and will be wrong many more

that does not support your position

finite information is on the tablet

i do not understand how one can be certain of things
one admits may be wrong

kant certainly says he is certain of particular statements
universal truths

they are apodictically certain

some of the other kantian positions in these discussions
are defending that interpretation of kant

kant himself goes into this certainty of the a priori
in his ethics
and even explores teleology in his "critique of judgement"

in pure reason
though
he says

(A104-5)
" We find, however, that our thought of the relation of all cognition
to its object carries something of necessity with it, since namely
the latter is regarded as that which is opposed to our cognitions
being determined at pleasure or arbitrarily rather than being
determined _a_priori_, since insofar as they are to relate to an
object our cognitions must also necessarily agree with each
other in relation to it, i.e., they must have that unity that
constitutes the concept of an object. "

concepts do not necessarily agree

people can be self-contradictory

over time
there might be a reinterpretation of the term "a priori"
to mean something like "a posteriori"
and maybe "necessary" comes to be better understood as "contingent"

it is possible that kant's mathematical examples
can be reinterpreted in this new understanding
and my objections to his philosophy might be shown misguided

but even this supports my position
and not kant's

admitting error is not a slippery slope into relativism

there are still metrics
prediction
health
things to base decisions off of

1. a priori:

2. a posteriori:

That bachelor is tall.
This triangle is blue.

The terms "a priori" and "a posteriori" are used in philosophy to
distinguish between two different types of propositional knowledge.
Thus, attempts to define clearly or explain a priori and a posteriori
knowledge are part of a central thread in epistemology, the study of
knowledge. Since the definitions and usage of the terms are disputed
and have evolved in the history of philosophy, it is difficult to
provide proper definitions of them.

Rough and oversimplified explanations are as follows:

a priori knowledge is independent of experience,
while a posteriori knowledge is dependent
on experience.

Lawyers sometimes use "a priori" to describe a step in an argument the
truth of which can be deduced entirely from the truth of the premises.
"A posteriori", on the other hand, requires a bit more evidence.

The intuitive distinction

Although definitions and usage of the terms have varied in the history
of philosophy, they have been consistently intended to demarcate two
separate epistemological notions. The intuitive distinction between a
priori and a posteriori knowledge can be seen in examples of what is
supposed to fall under each concept. To borrow from Jerry Fodor (2004),
take, for example, the proposition expressed by the sentence, "George V
reigned from 1910-1936". This is something that one must come to know a
posteriori (assuming that it is knowledge), because it expresses an
empirical fact that one cannot come to know of by reason alone. By
contrast, consider the proposition expressed by the sentence, "If
George V reigned at all, then he reigned for a while". This is
something that one knows a priori, because it expresses a fact that is
non-empirical and that one can come to know by reason alone.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori_%28philosophy%29

APRIORI  [B:xvii] Kant opposes  a priori and empirical knowledge. He
distinguishes between pure theoretical reason, pure practical reason,
and mathematics, all of which are sources of a priori knowledge, and he
also claims that we have a peculiar kind of a priori knowledge of the
self. For Kant, a priori knowledge is certain, and the possibility of a
priori knowledge about concepts and intuitions is grounded on his
so-called "Copernican Revolution", according to which "we suppose that
objects must conform to our knowledge"--Kant argues that the "rules" of
sensibility and the understanding are "in me prior to being given to
me, and therefore as given a priori". It is the possibility of such a
priori knowledge, he thinks, that "promises to metaphysics...the secure
path of a science". His programme involves (1) "explaining how there
can be knowledge a priori" and (2) "furnishing satisfactory proofs of
the laws which form the a priori basis of nature" (thereby showing in
what sense objects must conform to our knowledge). He insists that a
priori speculative (theoretical) knowledge is limited to possible
experience  (and thus to the realm of appearances, and their
construction by the faculties of our minds); however, it is possible
through practical a priori knowledge to "pass beyond the limits of all
possible experience"

[A2/B3] Kant gives the general definition of a priori knowledge as
"knowledge absolutely independent of all experience. Opposed to it is
empirical knowledge, which is knowledge possible only a posteriori ,
that is, through experience. A priori modes of knowledge are entitled
pure when there is no admixture of anything empirical [but not all a
priori propositions are pure, e.g., the causal maxim is a priori but
not pure]".

--------------------------

D. Rationalism vs. Empiricism

Theories of knowledge divide naturally, theoretically and historically
into the two rival schools of rationalism and empiricism. Neither
rationalism nor empiricism disregards the primary tool of the other
school entirely. The issue revolves on beliefs about necessary
knowledge and empirical knowledge.

1. Rationalism

Rationalism believes that some ideas or concepts are independent of
experience and that some truth is known by reason alone.

a. a priori

This is necessary knowledge not given in nor dependent upon experience;
it is necessarily true by definition. For instance "black cats are
black." This is an analytic statement, and broadly, it is a tautology;
its denial would be self-contradictory.

2. Empiricism

Empiricism believes that some ideas or concepts are independent of
experience and that truth must be established by reference to
experience alone.

b. a posteriori

This is knowledge that comes after or is dependent upon experience. for
instance "Desks are brown" is a synthetic statement. Unlike the
analytic statement "Black cats are black", the synthetic statement
"Desks are brown" is not necessarily true unless all desks are by
definition brown, and to deny it would not be self-contradictory. We
would probably refer the matter to experience.

Since knowledge depends primarily on synthetic statements -- statements
that may be true or may be false -- their nature and status are crucial
to theories of knowledge. The controvercial issue is the possibility of
synthetic necessary knowledge -- that is, the possibility of having
genuine knowledge of the world without the need to rely on experience.
Consider these statements:

1) The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.

2) Parallel lines never meet.

3) A whole is the sum of all its parts.

Rationalism may believe these to be synthetic necessary statements,
universally treu, and genunie knowledge; i.e., they are not merely
empty as the analytic or tautologous statemenst (Black cats are black)
and are not dependent on experience for their truth value.

Empiricism denies that these statements are synthetic and necessary.
Strict empriicism asserts that all such statements only appear to be
necessary or a priori. Actually, they derive from experience.

Logical empiricism admits that these statements are ncessary but only
because they are not really synthetic statements but analytic
statements, which are true by definition alone and do not give us
genuine knowledge of the world.

GENUINE KNOWLEDGE

Rationalism includes in genuine knowledge synthetic necessary
statements (or, if this term is rejected, then those analytic necessary
statements that "reveal reality" in terms of universally necessary
truth; e.g., "An entity is what it is and not something else.")

Empiricism limits genuine knowledge to empirical statements. Necessary
statements are empty (that is, they tell us nothing of the world).

Logical empiricism admits as genuine knowledge only analytic necessary
(Black cats are black) or synthetic empirical statements (desks are
brown). But the anyalytic necessary statements or laws of logic and
mathematics derive from arbitrary rules of usage, definitions, and the
like, and therefore reveal nothing about reality. (This is the
antimetaphysical point of view).

&gt; &gt; kant is often brought into discussions of axiomatics
&gt; &gt;   for precisely this reason

&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt;   are axioms necessary?

&gt; Good question! I'll give my answer later, but first:

&gt; &gt; the only thing necessary for information exchange

&gt; &gt;   is correlation

&gt; &gt; -*-*-   -*-*-   -*-*-

&gt; &gt; the &quot;noisy channel theorem&quot;
&gt; &gt;   is crucial to understand how this is possible
&gt; &gt; how information can be transferred with imperfect correlation

&gt; &gt; shannon's fundamental theorem
&gt; &gt;   provides a foundation for evolutionary theory
&gt; &gt; by explaining how metadynamic symbols are possible

&gt; The problem is not with noisy channels. Information theory deals with the
&gt; quantitative aspects of information transfer, including how *data* can be
&gt; extracted from background noise. But *data* is not, strictly speaking,
&gt; information. Before data can become information it must be interpreted. A
&gt; string of bits is not, *per se*, information. It only becomes information
&gt; when it is decoded, using the same algorithm at the sink that was used to
&gt; encode it at the source. Often one can discover that encoding algorithm by
&gt; trial and error, and hypothesis testing (provided one has *some* information
&gt; about the source). But the message may remain permanently (for human
&gt; purposes) indecipherable. Unless the sink can decode the message (using the
&gt; same algorithm as the source), there will be *no* correlation in behavior.
&gt; Public key cryptography depends upon this intrinsic ambiguity in any string
&gt; of bits. Any longish string of bits can represent millions of possible
&gt; messages. Without the Rawlinson text (or something similar) the Sumerian
&gt; tablets would remain meaningless (and even with it much of the &quot;meaning&quot;
&gt; imputed is guesswork). They would contain data, but no information.

&gt; &gt;&gt; No, no! Can't make that move. All languages, all of their syntax and
&gt; &gt;&gt; semantics, are contingent. But in order to make an argument (or to
&gt; &gt;&gt; carry on any kind of interpersonal communication) one must assume some
&gt; &gt;&gt; common fund of semantics and syntax exists between speaker and hearer.
&gt; &gt;&gt; That includes some logical rules. Suggesting that the LOC can be
&gt; &gt;&gt; interpeted differently cannot be used to invalidate any argument which
&gt; &gt;&gt; assumes it. It can only render communication between those speakers
&gt; &gt;&gt; impossible.

&gt; &gt; this is mathematically incorrect

&gt; &gt; communication is still possible

&gt; *Data* is still transferred. *Information* is not (because the data is not

We don't know that, Galathaea. We only know that many of them are. But even
if it is the case, it doesn't settle the question of *a priori* knowledge.
That is because knowledge (concepts, and the truth or falsity of
propositions constructed from those concepts), is not identifiable with any
particular neural structures or ensembles. So the stability or instability
of any particular structures does not imply stability or instability of any
particular knowledge. Indeed, the neural plasticity to which you refer

No ontologies are necessary. Kant's claims regarding the synthetic *a
priori* are not ontological claims. Only the noumena (about which we can
know nothing) is ontologically necessary. What is necessary are some
methodologies. And even those are contingent in the long run (that latter is
my take, not Kant's). (I'd argue that even the ontological necessity of the
noumena is a methodological claim. But that is another issue.)

Well, we have a philosophical disagreement. I think. Information is
transmitted *as information theorists now use that term*. But that is not
the ordinary use of that term, and it is not the philosophically important
one.

Information is data:

1) From which *knowledge can be extracted*, and

2) The knowledge extracted relates to states of affairs *beyond the data*.

If all we can learn from a datastream is the sequence of bits that compose
it, and perhaps some mathematical or statistical properties of that stream,
we have extracted no information from it. It is merely a sequence of bits
with certain properties. It is (per a paper I read years ago) an
"information-formation," i.e., a physical or mathematical structure capable
of conveying information.

A message (say, "Paris is the capital of France") conveys information
because it tells me something about Paris and France. It also tells me that
message is composed of several distinct symbols arranged in a particular
way, etc. But I am interested in those facts only instrumentally, if at all.

It is interesting that Shannon's original paper was entitled "A Mathematical
Theory of Communication" --- not a "theory of information". It dealt with
*communicating* information-formations over channels with various
parameters. Whether that communication carries any information (in the above
sense) is a separate question, and cannot be decided by examining the
datastream alone.

Just did (above). The units of information *per se* are various types of
propositional structures, e.g., R(x) ("x is red"), xLy ("x is to the left
y"), a&gt;b ("a is greater than b"), etc. That information is then mapped onto
some information-formation in order to be expressed, stored, or
communicated. The information-formation has units and a metric. Bits are the
simplest and most general unit we're likely to come up with.

You *almost* seem to be implying that datastreams carry intrinsic meaning.
You're not, are you?

All datastreams must be interpreted to extract information from them. Even
DNA is not information, but an information-formation. Insert human DNA in a
frog ovum and nothing will happen. The machinery in that cell (the sink)
lacks the tools (enzymes) required to decode that message. It is meaningless

the correlations are already in the literature

to a very real and meaningful extent
these questions already have good models

this timidity about accepting models
is a good and cautious first response

but do acknowledge what our correlations appear to be today

we have very good models on how our nervous system originated

muscular structures originally rhythmic
forming organisational coordination
to control locomotion and other muscular activities

this model fits the observation
that plants and fungi do not have muscular systems
and also did not organise nervous systems
in the manner of neurons

they do appear to have growth organised to sense
so they do appear to have active information processing
but not the rhythmic muscular locomation
or the complex conceptual models

we can model what starfish normally do
over 99% of their time

these models already describe concept formation

we have models of how frogs visually locate prey
or pattern recognise larger fearful action schemas
of possible predators
and if prey
to launch the activity off the tongue
in a learned accuracy of use

these models have concept formation
as something they already interpret

the models understand much of ring processing
and correlate with experiment quite well

mRNA expression techniques
and the various near-field and NMR-based imaging
have given us very strong experminetal techniques
that justify much of the neuroarchitectonic models

-+-+-+-+_

the concepts that these brain models form
though
are not the kantian concepts

they do not obey a strict logic
they are influenced by sense
to learn a good concept model

in this formalism concepts are attractor basins
in dynamics over the neural state space

the neural state space is often just some linear vector space
in these models

recursive feedback loops
allow iterative processing

concept strings and steps of logical modelling

and it is here local languages
grow
compete
and integrate
to our fractured world views

unlike the kantian notion
these senses sense information
_real_information_
in the sense of information theory
in units of threshold signalling

it appears that possibly early
in the evolution of the brain
some modularisation of reflexivity

in order to reflect on movements
and utterances

the mirror neurons are one form

that refers to our metaphysical models of science
but i insist this is the only meaningful way to do epistemology

we learn how we learn from everything we learn

not just the blurry sunsets and dull warm heat of the summer night
not just the smell of salt flats
the taste of the cherry pits
but all the symbols of information we process

including the scientific experiments

i insist this is epistemology
that kant himself proposed ontological models
but his ontology included very vague notions
like intuitions and transcendental ideas
with very little predictive power

but that is all we are talking about here

ontologies of concepts

how do they play?

looking at the explanation of perception and conception
found in the modern models
and how it explains so many meaningful questions of the process
with such good prediction
in earlier systems

i am more likely to trust experimental predictions
from a mathematical neuroarchitectonicist
than from a kantian

Hm. Sounds like Mike is a closet Kantian.

Mike is definitely defending (consciously or not) Ayn Rand's view of
'axiomatic' knowledge - knowledge that did not depend on any particular
experience - and I don't see it as anything but a silly semantic game
to refuse to call that type of knowledge a priori, to distinguish it
from knowledge dependent on specific experiences.  However, I'd dispute
your conclusion (possibly wrt to him, and definitely wrt myself) that a
belief in a priority makes one even a closet Kantian.

There are significant differences in Rand's 'axiomatic knowledge' and
Kant's 'a priori.'  Here is a short summary, from an Objectivist point
of view:

&lt;quote&gt;
Answered by William Thomas

I am not a Kantian, nor an expert on Kantianism. But the common
understanding of "a-priori" is knowledge that can be established prior
to experience. As Bertrand Russell puts it in discussing Kant in his
"History of Western Philosophy": "An 'a-priori' proposition... is one
which, though it may be elicited by experience, is seen, when known, to
have a basis other than experience." (pp. 706-707) Traditionally, it is
thought that the a-priori has no necessary bearing on experience, which
is radically "contingent."

Rand's axiomatic concepts and her axioms are self-evident on the basis
of the content of any particular experience. Thus, the Objectivist
axioms are known by experience, but can be known from any experience.
They cannot be known prior to or independent of experience, however. It
is a contradiction in terms to posit consciousness with nothing to be
conscious of. Consciousness is an active faculty of awareness: it
exists to be aware of objects, and has no contents without them.

One sign of the difference between Objectivist axioms and Kantian
"a-priori" is that Kantian "a-priori" concepts are claimed based on
characteristics of language, mathematics, and logic. They are described
formalistically or based on appeal to an intuition about the necessary.
This basic approach thus examines the contents of a well-educated mind,
ignoring the world around it, to try to establish the "apriori."

The Objectivist axioms, by contrast, are established based the
characteristics of the objects of experience. That they exist, that
they are what they are, that one is aware of them, (which is the basis
of the axiomatic concepts of existence, identity, and consciousness)
are all statements that presuppose a relation between reality and the
mind of the knower, a relation that is self-evident in every
experience. Rand's most fundamental axiom is "Existence exists."
Non-contradiction, the point of logic that features prominently in
theories of the "a-priori," is a kind of corollary of what we observe
in existence. Thus logic is derived from our experience of existence.
&lt;/q&gt;

Kant says much the same thing. In order to become aware of the a priori, or
to grasp its form, we must have some sensory experience to work with. I.e.,
we can't grasp the form without something to serve as content. Rand presumes
the form is deduced from the content; Kant says it is there all along.

Might check my response in the "Kant - metaethics [etc.]" thread. Covers the
same ground.

There is no inconsistency there with Kant. Kant does not suggest that our
world models are innate. They are constructed from the data of experience.
But the methodologies for building them (the most primitive ones) are
innate. The theoretical models for neural processing have similar *a priori*
features. The data do not write the program which processes it (although the
program evolved within the constraints of prior data).

be extracted from those signals after processing. That information then
generates a change in the world model. Without the processing there is no

I think this is an important point --- probably the key to our disagreement.
Here is a *gedankenexperiment*:

The first astronauts arrive on Mars, and after exploring for several months,
they discover a labyrinth of deep caves. In some of those caves they find
some stone tablets, not unlike those of the Sumerians. Further exploration
yields more caves, scattered widely over the planet, many with similar stone
tablets. A very few other artifacts are also found, all formed from various
species of stone found on Mars. The tablets themselves have been cut from
thin layers of Martian shale (the discovery of which confirms that Mars had
surface water for an extended period). Because of the scarcity of other
artifacts, the explorers surmise that the caves were dedicated information
repositories, rather than habitations or other general use shelters.

Via various techniques the tablets are dated to between 800 million to 1
billion years old. Nothing on the surface of Mars survives from that era,
which we know was vastly different from today --- Mars had a much denser
atmosphere, surface water, almost constant tectonic and volcanic activity.

The tablets are inscribed with what appears to be an alphabetic language
having 41 symbols. The same symbol set is used on all the tablets, which
together bear over 100 million characters. Of course, none of the symbols
resemble any used in any Earth language.

Let us assume that the tablets are indeed written records of some kind (and
that is an assumption), and that they record the same general range of
information humans would record --- histories, myths, laws, descriptive
scientific texts, stories and plays, biographies, recipes, "how-tos", poems,
etc.

I'd agree that we should be able to divine the syntax of that written
language (and perhaps even discover that the tablets record a few different
languages which use the same symbol set). But I'd argue that we would never
be able to translate a *single word*.

Do you disagree?

You talk about Kant.

You say: "one thing i notice  is a fear of formalism"

May I remind you to the fact that Kant himself defined (his)
transcendental philosophy as:

" [Transzendentalphilosophie] ist die von allem Inhalt (d.i. allen
Gegenständen) abstrahierende synthetische Erkenntnis a priori
aus Begriffen, also bloß das _Formale_ des theoretisch spekulativen
und moralisch praktischen sich selbst bestimmenden Subjekts"
(OP XXI 92). OP stands for Opus Posthumum (Vittorio Mathieu)

I will try to translate that (Neither German nor English is my
mother tongue, maybe someone feels the need to make some
additional remarks):

Transcendental philosophy is the a priori synthetic knowledge/in-
sight of our notions that abstracts from all content (that is: all
objects), that is (only) the pure _formal_ part of the theoretical
speculative and praktical moral subject that defines/determines
him/herself.

Newtonian physics is NOT wrong. This misconception is due to a limited
understanding of physics. It can be said that Newtonian physics is not
complete enough to describe the entire universe, but that in no way
makes it wrong. The law of gravity is not 'the good idea of gravity',
it is the law of gravity. And to my knowledge no one has disproved it
yet.

The same goes for euclidean geometry. There are no geometries that
nullify the arguments of euclidean geometry to my knowledge. Euclidean
geometry is not wrong, just not entirely complete.

Newtonian (classical) mechanics is galilean invariant. Velocities add.
This is not the way the world works. That is why locally Lorentzian
Invariant physics has taken its place.

In addition to the invariance being incorrect the Newton concept of
space and time are just plain wrong, as Einstein has demonstrated.

Getting past the physics, Kant was dead wrong about Euclidean Geometry
being an apodictic synthetic a priori. There are an infinite number of
consistent non-Euclidean geometries.

As to Kant's assertion that 5 + 7 = 12 is synthetic a priori, this
equation can be trivially derived from the Peano Axioms which are
neither synthetic nor analytic. They are just conventional assumptions,
in the sense that Poincare' defined convention.

Kant struck out with his synthetic a priori nonsense. Hume was dead on
right.

That is your kind of metaphysics. It is Kants "intellectus ectypus"
and you are still into that. But Kants purpose was to get rid of the
scepticism of empirism (and it was his purpose to get rid of the
dogmatism of the "intellectus archetypus as well)

If you try to understand Kant than you must know that all natural
things are conditioned. In Kants morals this comes back as the
"hypothetical imperative" (because it rests on our -scientific-

No. It is well understood that Newtonian mechanics is a limiting case

Newtonian mechanics are approximately correct. As the speeds approach

At speeds small compared to light in a vaccumm (most speeds), time

i think there is plenty of literature
which can start to form a full description
for your preferences in cheese-sensations

the olfactory system is well analysed

the key to understanding the olfactory system
is the "basic circuit" in the olfactory bulb
which is the basic abstraction conceptualiser

the main pathway passes from olfactory nerves
through mitral or tufted cells to their output axons

there are two cross-talk levels
the first level is the olfactory glomeruli
whose interaction selects primary classification of sense
commonly called "input processing"
the second level consists of the directed interpretation
as requested by central olfactory system process
commonly called "output control"

once processed by the bulb
the signal represents an attractor in mostly typical form
and then becomes a computational signal

the characterisation done in the system is learned
through a mainly long-term potentiation mechanism
( though there may be some other learning mechanisms
in interacting pathways )

so your preference may be strongly a consequence of history

sometimes it may be a very immediate defiant act
though

and every now and then you might go for swiss

these are controlled by systems of drives
that perform the calculational manipulations of desire

all of this structure is actually in
books i have referenced in past posts with you
but i would like to also point to
" drive: neurobiological and molecular mechanisms
of sexual motivation "
by donald pfaff

the caption on figure 4.3 ( p43 ) reads
( as a representative sample ):
" Neuroanatomy of two-component drives.  As discovered at the
Karolinska Institute during the 1960s, groups of noradrenergic
neurons (A) and dopaminergic neurons (B) located in the
hindbrain and midbrain give rise to widely distributed axonal
trajectories and terminations in the forebrain.  Excitations and
activity of such neurons are likely to comprise the
mechanisms of generalised drive states (G sources).  Their
concerted actions are at the basis of electrophysiological
and behavioral arousal, the general component of drive.  By
comparison, for the particular sources (P) of activation of
particular drives serving individual biological needs, humoral
stimuli, including hormones, act at specific forebrain
locations.  In each case, their specific actions determine
individualised motivational states.  Together, the effect of
generalised arousal (G) and particular biological need states
(P) energise and direct motivational behavior. "

&gt; Here is a *gedankenexperiment*:

&gt; The first astronauts arrive on Mars, and after exploring for several months,
&gt; they discover a labyrinth of deep caves. In some of those caves they find
&gt; some stone tablets, not unlike those of the Sumerians. Further exploration
&gt; yields more caves, scattered widely over the planet, many with similar stone
&gt; tablets. A very few other artifacts are also found, all formed from various
&gt; species of stone found on Mars. The tablets themselves have been cut from
&gt; thin layers of Martian shale (the discovery of which confirms that Mars had
&gt; surface water for an extended period). Because of the scarcity of other
&gt; artifacts, the explorers surmise that the caves were dedicated information
&gt; repositories, rather than habitations or other general use shelters.

&gt; Via various techniques the tablets are dated to between 800 million to 1
&gt; billion years old. Nothing on the surface of Mars survives from that era,
&gt; which we know was vastly different from today --- Mars had a much denser
&gt; atmosphere, surface water, almost constant tectonic and volcanic activity.

&gt; The tablets are inscribed with what appears to be an alphabetic language
&gt; having 41 symbols. The same symbol set is used on all the tablets, which
&gt; together bear over 100 million characters. Of course, none of the symbols
&gt; resemble any used in any Earth language.

&gt; Let us assume that the tablets are indeed written records of some kind (and
&gt; that is an assumption), and that they record the same general range of
&gt; information humans would record --- histories, myths, laws, descriptive
&gt; scientific texts, stories and plays, biographies, recipes, &quot;how-tos&quot;, poems,
&gt; etc.

&gt; I'd agree that we should be able to divine the syntax of that written
&gt; language (and perhaps even discover that the tablets record a few different
&gt; languages which use the same symbol set). But I'd argue that we would never
&gt; be able to translate a *single word*.

&gt; Do you disagree?
">

i think the word translate is vague here

obviously those symbols will not usually correspond
to anything we have ever experienced

many of the symbols will be of ephemera lost to time
so all of the symbols available to "translate into"
would be only weakly relevant

but the point is that information is still transmitted

we cannot play the game to negotiate referent
but we can predict what we will find on future tablets found
and we can even analyse the evolution of the symbols
over the time span discovered
and we can form hypotheses of meaning
which could be tested by future observations

if our models can predict more
information has been transferred
no matter how foreign or unassociated with experience
no matter how primitive

it is still structural

if one martian was trapped falling into a black hole
and we used our advanced technology to save it
before it crosses the event horizon

even it though it gets horribly damaged in extraction
we might be able pour its brain-like organ
into our ubernet and "communicate"

the information acquired would allow us
to much more quickly comprehend this communication
and if the game of association is possible
we can agree to experience and translate

without access to the game
and a martian to communicate with

we have still hypothesis and correlation

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

More likely not. Most preferences are revealed upon first presentation of
the alternatives. There is no learning involved (not all, of course. There
are "acquired tastes").

Most preferences seem to be innate but not hereditary. You are born with
them, but they are not coded in DNA. They are the result of numerous
algorithms settling on discrete solutions during prenatal development. The
DNA codes the algorithms, but the values of variables depend on the
microchemistry of the ovum and micro factors in the interuterine
environment --- maybe what Mom had for lunch yesterday. Others are "purely
chance" (meaning we'll never trace them to specific factors). So you get a
"protopreference hierarchy" over the range of stimuli the organism is
equipped to recognize. The preferences are crystallized when the choices are
presented. It is as unique and unpredictable as the fingerprints you
mentioned.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes. When a preference is satisfied, procurement behavior is redirected to
the next lower preference in the hierarchy.

And what information is that? Suppose some segment of that text is a recipe
for baking Martian bread. A Martian reading it would learn something ---
namely, how to bake bread. That string of symbols would equip him (her/it)
with a new skill. He would then exhibit a behavioral sequence not hitherto
observed, and which would never have been manifested without the new
programming acquired from that text. *That* is information. That is the
information the text was written to convey.

I agree we can extract some information from the text. We can learn
something about the structure of Martian languages. But we cannot learn how
to bake Martian bread. Even if all the ingredients and utensils were still
available or Mars, we would still be unable to bake bread, or at least, we
could not learn how via that text. We'd have to learn how on our own.

A string of symbols contains within itself only information about itself.
But strings of symbols are used to convey information about something else.

information.

Disagree. The tablets would not help us a bit in communicating with the
Martian. We'd have to extract from his brain the associations of concepts
with symbols. But then we have decoded the text.

And even then we could not be sure. Tidal forces may have distorted all the
associations is such a way that the tablets translate into gibberish.

&gt;of &quot;Verstand&quot; and &quot;Vernunft&quot; - for both there's only the English word
&gt;&quot;reason&quot;.&quot;
&gt;I've seen them translated as Reason and Understanding which melds
&gt;the meanings in English, so that one is not the &quot;higher&quot; faculty,
&gt;but are two parts contributing to a whole.
">

Sure. Thats correct. But Kant explicitly works toward a "system" or
a "whole". Your quote go's  on, saying that "verstand" is the pre-
condition for our "empirical part of our vernuft".

Concerning the human intellect as  a whole, Kant distinguishes be-
tween the "intellectus ectypus" and the "intellectus archetypus".
"Vernunft" has to to with the (transcendental) union of both of them
while "verstand" primaraly has to do with the ectypus-part.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, I'm very skeptical of that. Certain types or classes of knowledge
&gt; &gt;&gt; *depend upon* certain brain structures being intact. But that is not
&gt; &gt;&gt; saying much more than that the brain has to be in working order for us
&gt; &gt;&gt; to know anything. There is no identifiable neural structure or ensemble
&gt; &gt;&gt; that represents my knowledge that Paris is the capital of France, or my
&gt; &gt;&gt; preference for sharp Cheddar over Swiss.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm fairly familiar with the neurophys literature. Do you have a cite?

&gt; &gt; i think there is plenty of literature
&gt; &gt;   which can start to form a full description
&gt; &gt; for your preferences in cheese-sensations

&gt; &gt; the olfactory system is well analysed

&gt; &gt; the key to understanding the olfactory system
&gt; &gt;   is the &quot;basic circuit&quot; in the olfactory bulb
&gt; &gt; which is the basic abstraction conceptualiser

&gt; &gt; the main pathway passes from olfactory nerves
&gt; &gt;   through mitral or tufted cells to their output axons

&gt; &gt; there are two cross-talk levels
&gt; &gt;   the first level is the olfactory glomeruli
&gt; &gt;     whose interaction selects primary classification of sense
&gt; &gt;     commonly called &quot;input processing&quot;
&gt; &gt;   the second level consists of the directed interpretation
&gt; &gt;     as requested by central olfactory system process
&gt; &gt;     commonly called &quot;output control&quot;

&gt; &gt; once processed by the bulb
&gt; &gt;   the signal represents an attractor in mostly typical form
&gt; &gt;   and then becomes a computational signal

&gt; &gt; the characterisation done in the system is learned
&gt; &gt; through a mainly long-term potentiation mechanism
&gt; &gt; ( though there may be some other learning mechanisms
&gt; &gt;   in interacting pathways )

&gt; Read that back to yourself, g. So far you have sketched a neuromodel of how
&gt; I discriminate between Cheddar and Swiss. You have not explained why I
&gt; *prefer* Cheddar to Swiss.
">

yes but with an "outer" connection in the second level
which is the point of the latter reference to drives

in particular
our neurocomputational system has these boundaries
where an external net learning process of sensual categorisation
interacts with internal processing loops

drives are these internal processing loops

they control the origins of arousal and motivation towards act
through manipulation of instances in attractors

the study of boundary cases
leads naturally to catastrophe theory
which is: the study of boundaries in attractor dynamics
( so its pretty well suited to the cause )

but this is not simply dynamics

this is computational dynamics
and response plasticity provides the state transition capability
of an event driven architecture

event driven computational architectures
allow internal dialogue with self-events

or loops

-*-*-

this is the key to drive mechanisms

whether the internal scan-wave of the retinal loops
or the lordosis behavior studied by pfaff

we are learning what drives us to focus on objects
reach for objects
or prepare for more intimate encounters

Of course not. But that is not the problem. If we had the referent for a
certain Martian morpheme then we could coin an English word for it and
define that word: "A Martian monument having such-and-such characteristics
and erected for so-and-so purpose." We do that when translating human
languages, often by just importing the foreign word, e.g., "siesta." But for
the Martian text we don't have the referent, and cannot retrieve it from the
text.

By "what we discourse with" do you mean what symbols and combinatorial

I agree that meaning is discursive, and that is why we cannot translate the
Martian tablets. We have not been involved in discourse with the Martians in
their environment (or some common environment). And their mappings of
symbols to referents is arbitrary, like all other such mappings.

Because we are in a continuing dialog with the universe. It speaks to us
(via the senses) with a constant syntax, and we have erected a semantics
upon that syntax. That semantics is our model of the universe. We can
validate our semantics by testing the universe and observing the universe's
response. But we can't do that with the Martians. We could perhaps construct
a semantics for that text, but we will get no feedback.

Quite rightly so.  Logical inferences (or what Leibniz called 'truths

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The intuitive distinction

&gt; Although definitions and usage of the terms have varied in the history
&gt; of philosophy, they have been consistently intended to demarcate two
&gt; separate epistemological notions. The intuitive distinction between a
&gt; priori and a posteriori knowledge can be seen in examples of what is
&gt; supposed to fall under each concept. To borrow from Jerry Fodor (2004),
&gt; take, for example, the proposition expressed by the sentence, &quot;George V
&gt; reigned from 1910-1936&quot;. This is something that one must come to know a
&gt; posteriori (assuming that it is knowledge), because it expresses an
&gt; empirical fact that one cannot come to know of by reason alone. By
&gt; contrast, consider the proposition expressed by the sentence, &quot;If
&gt; George V reigned at all, then he reigned for a while&quot;. This is
&gt; something that one knows a priori, because it expresses a fact that is
&gt; non-empirical and that one can come to know by reason alone.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori_%28philosophy%29

&gt; APRIORI  [B:xvii] Kant opposes  a priori and empirical knowledge. He
&gt; distinguishes between pure theoretical reason, pure practical reason,
&gt; and mathematics, all of which are sources of a priori knowledge, and he
&gt; also claims that we have a peculiar kind of a priori knowledge of the
&gt; self. For Kant, a priori knowledge is certain, and the possibility of a
&gt; priori knowledge about concepts and intuitions is grounded on his
&gt; so-called &quot;Copernican Revolution&quot;, according to which &quot;we suppose that
&gt; objects must conform to our knowledge&quot;--Kant argues that the &quot;rules&quot; of
&gt; sensibility and the understanding are &quot;in me prior to being given to
&gt; me, and therefore as given a priori&quot;. It is the possibility of such a
&gt; priori knowledge, he thinks, that &quot;promises to metaphysics...the secure
&gt; path of a science&quot;. His programme involves (1) &quot;explaining how there
&gt; can be knowledge a priori&quot; and (2) &quot;furnishing satisfactory proofs of
&gt; the laws which form the a priori basis of nature&quot; (thereby showing in
&gt; what sense objects must conform to our knowledge). He insists that a
&gt; priori speculative (theoretical) knowledge is limited to possible
&gt; experience  (and thus to the realm of appearances, and their
&gt; construction by the faculties of our minds); however, it is possible
&gt; through practical a priori knowledge to &quot;pass beyond the limits of all
&gt; possible experience&quot;
">

To do that, of course, Kant has to show that it's possible to squeeze
new knowledge out of the /a priori/ - which can't be done
analytically, by definition - and therefore, he comes up with a new
classification, the synthetic /a priori/.

&gt; [A2/B3] Kant gives the general definition of a priori knowledge as
&gt; &quot;knowledge absolutely independent of all experience. Opposed to it is
&gt; empirical knowledge, which is knowledge possible only a posteriori ,
&gt; that is, through experience. A priori modes of knowledge are entitled
&gt; pure when there is no admixture of anything empirical [but not all a
&gt; priori propositions are pure, e.g., the causal maxim is a priori but
&gt; not pure]&quot;.

&gt; --------------------------

&gt; D. Rationalism vs. Empiricism

&gt; Theories of knowledge divide naturally, theoretically and historically
&gt; into the two rival schools of rationalism and empiricism. Neither
&gt; rationalism nor empiricism disregards the primary tool of the other
&gt; school entirely. The issue revolves on beliefs about necessary
&gt; knowledge and empirical knowledge.

&gt; 1. Rationalism

&gt; Rationalism believes that some ideas or concepts are independent of
&gt; experience and that some truth is known by reason alone.

&gt; a. a priori

&gt; This is necessary knowledge not given in nor dependent upon experience;
&gt; it is necessarily true by definition. For instance &quot;black cats are
&gt; black.&quot; This is an analytic statement, and broadly, it is a tautology;
&gt; its denial would be self-contradictory.

&gt; 2. Empiricism

&gt; Empiricism believes that some ideas or concepts are independent of
&gt; experience and that truth must be established by reference to
&gt; experience alone.

&gt; b. a posteriori

&gt; This is knowledge that comes after or is dependent upon experience. for
&gt; instance &quot;Desks are brown&quot; is a synthetic statement. Unlike the
&gt; analytic statement &quot;Black cats are black&quot;, the synthetic statement
&gt; &quot;Desks are brown&quot; is not necessarily true unless all desks are by
&gt; definition brown, and to deny it would not be self-contradictory. We
&gt; would probably refer the matter to experience.

&gt; Since knowledge depends primarily on synthetic statements -- statements
&gt; that may be true or may be false -- their nature and status are crucial
&gt; to theories of knowledge. The controvercial issue is the possibility of
&gt; synthetic necessary knowledge -- that is, the possibility of having
&gt; genuine knowledge of the world without the need to rely on experience.
&gt; Consider these statements:

&gt; 1) The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.
">

True by logical implication of the definition of a degree.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) Parallel lines never meet.
">

False.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3) A whole is the sum of all its parts.
">

True by definitions of 'part' and 'whole.'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Rationalism may believe these to be synthetic necessary statements,
&gt; universally treu, and genunie knowledge; i.e., they are not merely
&gt; empty as the analytic or tautologous statemenst (Black cats are black)
&gt; and are not dependent on experience for their truth value.

&gt; Empiricism denies that these statements are synthetic and necessary.
&gt; Strict empriicism asserts that all such statements only appear to be
&gt; necessary or a priori. Actually, they derive from experience.

&gt; Logical empiricism admits that these statements are ncessary but only
&gt; because they are not really synthetic statements but analytic
&gt; statements, which are true by definition alone and do not give us
&gt; genuine knowledge of the world.
">

That last is my view (in case anyone hasn't noticed. 8)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; GENUINE KNOWLEDGE

&gt; Rationalism includes in genuine knowledge synthetic necessary
&gt; statements (or, if this term is rejected, then those analytic necessary
&gt; statements that &quot;reveal reality&quot; in terms of universally necessary
&gt; truth; e.g., &quot;An entity is what it is and not something else.&quot;)

&gt; Empiricism limits genuine knowledge to empirical statements. Necessary
&gt; statements are empty (that is, they tell us nothing of the world).

&gt; Logical empiricism admits as genuine knowledge only analytic necessary
&gt; (Black cats are black) or synthetic empirical statements (desks are
&gt; brown). But the anyalytic necessary statements or laws of logic and
&gt; mathematics derive from arbitrary rules of usage, definitions, and the
&gt; like, and therefore reveal nothing about reality. (This is the
&gt; antimetaphysical point of view).
