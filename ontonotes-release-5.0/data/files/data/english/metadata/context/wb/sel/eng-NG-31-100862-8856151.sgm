It all started when I was scrolling
through an online classified site.     I normally just conduct a
search by typing COLLIE in the search
bar. On this day, I had the time and decided to scroll through all the
ads when an ad titled DOG LEFT TO DIE, in a neighboring town, caught me
attention, so I click on it.
The ad was posted by a concerned
citizen who for days had watched a Collie standing or laying on the side
of the road waiting for his owners, who had obviously dumped him, to
come back for him. She stated he was mangy and very emaciated and that
they should be ashamed of themselves for leaving such a devoted, loyal,
forgiving dog to fend for himself.
She had tried several times to catch
him but every time she got close he took off. I emailed the poster to
find out the specifics.
The very kind lady emailed me back
to say that she had posted the ad the day before and thought that he had
not survived the terrible storms the night before because she had not
seen him. She had searched several times that morning and around noon.
I emailed her back and told her most
strays will come out of hiding in the early morning or late evening
hours when it is cooler. At 8pm that night she replied to say she had
seen him again on a different street but he was obviously on the move
now, looking for food.
This was wonderful news. Now we knew
he was still alive.     By 8:30 that night two other Houston Collie
Rescue volunteers
and I had come up with a plan -- we would meet the next morning and
scour the neighborhood.
We met the next morning and decided
to take one vehicle. We turned down the street where he was last seen. I
was looking on one side of the street, and the two other volunteers,
Barb and Virginia were searching the other side.
All the sudden, Virginia spotted him
standing on an empty lot. We all get out of the vehicle and formulated a
plan to catch him.
When we first got out of the car he
took off running from us. So, I went straight toward him while Virginia
and Barb came at him from the very far side of the empty lot. I had
canned dog food on the plate and Barb said, &quot;Call him Laddie.&quot; (For some
reason, everyone names their Collies Laddie or Lassie.)
I started calling him, telling him
what a wonderful, pretty, precious boy he was. I sat down on the ground
with the food at arm's length and kept calling him in my baby, happy
voice. When he got a foot away, he slinked down to the ground and
crawled to the plate on his belly.
I then gently touched the top of his
head and with the other hand slipped the leash over his head. Once he
finished eating he pranced to the car. I was almost in tears.
This was my first stray dog rescue
and I know they won't always be that easy. He was tired of running and
was so hungry I think he was ready to be caught. He gave us all Collie
kisses before we loaded him in the kennel for the ride to Virginia's,
who will foster him.
I believe it was God's will that we
rescued this baby. Why did I scroll through the ads, instead of
narrowing my search? Why was it so easy to catch him with the kind
citizen couldn't?
He will have to complete heartworm
treatment before he is adopted, but we will see him through that.
From this day on he will have the
life that every dog should have but unfortunately, far too many don't.
