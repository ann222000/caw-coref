Hi,

Can anyone assist with how to strip chrome parts? I am building a Tamiya
1/12 scale motorcycle and I want to strip the frame and repaint using
Alclad. I've never done it before. I've heard oven cleaner is good. Will any
one do? And how to apply? I wasn't sure if I just cover the whole thing in
it and leave it for a while (if so - how long) or if I work it on with a
toothbrush? And if not oven cleaner what else will work?

I have a real fear of melting the frame so any help gratefully received.

Thanks, Mark.

DOT 3 brake fluid and an old toothbrush works pretty well.  Soak the part
for 10 or 15 minutes and use the toothbrush as the plating loosens.

I've used fume free Easy Off and placed the items in a zip lock bag,
spray liberally and leave aside for a while, as long as overnight.
Some chrome comes off easier than others. Sometimes a toothpick is
needed to get the chrome out of the nooks and crannies. I wash with a
toothbrush and some dishwashing liquid soap afterwards.

Mark,
just in case you don't know this: Usenet groups are archived. And you
probably don't imagine that you're the first person asking this
question, do you?

Well, in that case do a simple search. You'll learn what types of
"chrome" might be used on plasitc and about a dozen different ways of
stripping it.

Here is a good search for you:

group=rec.models.scale&amp;q=stripping+chrome&amp;qt_g=Search+this+group

...and start reading!
Most methods will not damage your plastic pieces. :-)  IMO, stay away
from brake fluid.

Another simple and safe method is to mix up water and Tide (or a
similar detergent) to a consistency slightly less thick than
toothpaste and soak the parts in it for a couple of days. Then like
other methods using an old toothbrush rinse and polish off the plating
down to its plastic base. It takes a little longer but is certainly
one of the safest methods.

Common household bleach works best and quickest for me.  You can almost
watch the process as it happens.  Inexpensive, too...

My personal favorite is vinegar.  It takes a couple of days, but it is
completely environmentally friendly and it has not failed me yet.

But AFAIK, Westley's Bleach-White, Simple Green, bleach or vinegar
only get rid of the "chrome" (aluminum) layer. Neither of those takes
care of the clear coar under it.  To fully strip the parts clear coat
needs to also be removed.

Thanks to everybody who took the trouble to reply to this. Lots of good
suggestions there. I feel some experimentation coming on at the weekend!

Happy modelling.

And if you're really not sure about any method...

try it on a part you don't need or a bit of sprue first.

But I'm sure you didn't need to be told that :-)

I did exactly that. I settled on bleach in the end. Nothing to do with how
well it worked (although it did work well), just that it was easy to
convince my wife I was cleaning the bathroom :-))))

All the chrome is now stripped and will be painting tonight.

Thanks again everyone, really appreciate your help.

I find that if I just leave it out unprotected in what passes for
breathable atmosphere in these parts, in a while it strips itself.
