Hello Doctors & others,
I'm 48 and I've been diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma several times.
Biopsies are always positive and mohs($$) is recommended. I suspect I'm being
scammed. The doctor excises the biopsy and doesn't stitch up the wound site
to preserve healthy tissue for a week or more before he gives me the results
of HIS exam. During this time he has me cleanse the wound (biopsy) site twice
daily with hydrogen peroxide to prevent infection. However, it seems to me
that another effect of cleansing exposed, blood deprived, but otherwise
living, healthy tissue is that it kills it and the depth and parameter of the
biopsy wound site gradually expands. Thus, either a much larger excision or
mohs is required to remove the dead tissue whether or not it's actually
cancerous. It ultimately become irrelevant whether I really have cancer
because the procedure is needed even if I don't. Anyone know of this scam or
something like it? Please reply!

(the technique) Sounds familiar, but we don't discuss Mohs much here.
What was the size of the lesion?  Steph might be able to say if shave biopsy
would have been better or RT.

If you're implying that you're going to a surgeon and it was not cancer to begin
with, then why go to that doctor?  Things work differently in each country. In
our country, (Canada), we usually see a GP (primary care physician) who are
usually pretty good at identifying skin lesions/lumps that need referral.
Isn't there one in your area?
