I ran out of black and went to three Dollar Stores within a three mile
radius.  All of them were out of Black too and only one had White.
Weird.

For a buck one gets 35 ml of acrylic paint that I find is even better
than the brand name hobby acrylics.  It has an eggshell finish I find
very suitable for armor and dioramas.  For example the black when
painted as  tire rubber looks like what rubber should be, not glossy
and not matte either.  I also find Dollar Store acrylics excellent for
mixing the various shades of olive green and Russian armor green. The
shade looks better than any of the hobby paint standard shades.   Mix
dark green with medium brown.  Add black to darken.  Dollar Store
acrylics are so cheap and plentiful that I dare to experiment freely
to get the desired shade.  I also like their viscosity in that when
brushed on the paint doesn't run and bleeding between two wet paints
is limited.

I am always using the WalMart acrylic paints; they also cost around a
buck or so each, come in hundreds of colors, and are cheap enough that
you can mix specific colors to match your project's paint scheme at low
cost that often seem to be a better match than the commercially
available ones.
By finishing the model with conventional enamel, and adding wear and
highlights using the acrylics via dry brushing and washes (if the washes
bead up, an bit of liquid dish soap added to the mixture will make it
lay down smoothly), good results can be achieved.
The advantages to this approach are that the acrylics won't affect the
underlying enamel unlike thinner-based enamel washes can, and if you
completely botch it, you can get the  acrylic off with a toothbrush
after soaking the model in hot water.
This works particularly well for simulating mud on tank models; the
acrylic can be mixed with flour to thicken it, and stipple-brushed on
the model to make convincing dried mud splatters that protrude slightly
from the surface.
In fact, if you thickened it enough, you might have a good basis for
Zimmerit paste.

Maybe so. But being a Dollar Store paint, it'll probably decompose and
melt off your model in a year or two.  And it is probably loaded with
nasty toxic chemicals :-)

And only if you swallow the toothpaste after brushing.

Your fortune? &quot;General MacArthur returned, but soon you will be

Okay.  No more cookies and don't brush your teeth.  Just stick to
Trumpy and Dragon models.
