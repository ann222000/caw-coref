Enjoy The Silence
A film festival devoted to comedies from the silent film era is coming to
Arlington.
By David Schultz

When &amp; Where
Slapsticon 2007 will take place from Thursday, July 19 to Sunday, July 22 at
the Rosslyn Spectrum Theatre. More than 60 short and feature-length films
will be shown throughout the festival. Single-day tickets cost $30 while
four-day tickets cost $99. Call Rob Farr at 703-228-3271.

For silent film fans, Slapsticon is like Christmas, Thanksgiving and
Woodstock all rolled into one.
A four-day smorgasbord of more than 60 comedies from the pre-sound era of
film, Slapsticon can be a lot to take in, even for the most ardent fan.
&quot;It takes a few days to recover after the festival,&quot; silent film buff Steve
Massa said.
Massa, who lives in New York and has been attending Slapsticon in Arlington
since its inception five years ago, said that he loves the festival because
of its unique specialty.
&quot;Every festival has their own theme,&quot; he said, &quot;[But Slapsticon is] the only
one that's devoted to just early comedies.&quot;

SLAPSTICON, named after the exaggerated physical comedy style of Slapstick
used frequently in films from the 20s and 30s, is the brain child of
Arlington County employee Rob Farr.
A self-described &quot;film geek,&quot; Farr was disappointed that there were no
silent film festivals devoted solely to comedies.
&quot;At other festivals, the comedy guys would get together in ballrooms [and
socialize],&quot; he said.
Based on this network of slapstick fans, Farr believed that there would be
significant interest in a silent comedy film festival. He pitched the idea
to Arlington's Cultural Affairs Department and &quot;They said 'Try to break
even,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;We broke even the first year because everyone was
working for free.&quot;
Thanks to an ever-growing audience, as well as a partnership with the
Library of Congress and the UCLA film department, Farr said that the
festival has stayed pretty close to recouping its costs every year since
then.

FESTIVAL PROGRAMMER Richard Roberts, a film collector who said his personal
stash numbers somewhere in the quadruple digits, makes sure that Slapsticon
caters towards true film connoisseurs.
Rather than showcase well-known classics by masters of the medium such as
Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton, the festival focuses on obscure films that
had been lost for decades.
&quot;The thing most people don't realize,&quot; Roberts said, &quot;Is that when you start
talking about silent comedy, you think about Chaplin, Keaton or Harold
Lloyd. But there were literally hundreds of comedians who get no attention
at all today.&quot;
One of those comedians is Larry Semon. A contemporary of Charlie Chaplin,
Semon starred in silent films for years but some of his work has been lost
forever. His last feature film, &quot;Spuds,&quot; hasn't been shown anywhere since
1927.
&quot;The film just disappeared,&quot; Farr said.
But &quot;Spuds&quot; was recently discovered and restored by the UCLA film department
and will be having its &quot;world re-premiere&quot; at this year's Slapsticon.

BECAUSE A FILM would be nothing without a soundtrack, Slapsticon employs its
own pianists to accompany all of its silent films.
At this year's festival, Ben Model and Philip Carli will be providing the
scores for all of the dozens of short and feature-length films.
In a finger-testing feat of stamina, Slapsticon requires the two pianists to
play for hours on end, all of it made up on the spot.
&quot;I haven't seen any of [the films] before, [so I'm] working mentally in
overdrive to constantly anticipate where story or gags are going,&quot; Model
said. &quot;I do the composing during the show.&quot;
&quot;They're just amazing,&quot; Linda Shaw, Roberts' wife and the chair of this year's
Slapsticon, said about Model and Carli. &quot;I don't know how they do it.&quot;
So how does Model improvise on a piano for hours at a time, all the while
providing contextual accompaniment for a film he's never seen?
&quot;I'm in a zone where I'm fused with the film,&quot; he said. &quot;People say 'How do
you do this' and I just say 'I'm not sure.'&quot;

WHILE SLAPSTICON'S expressed purpose is to show rare and restored silent
comedies, it also acts as a de facto reunion for silent film fanatics across
the globe.
Because many of the festival's out-of-town attendees stay in the same hotel,
Massa said that it is not uncommon for impromptu after-screening discussions
to last until the wee hours of the morning.
&quot;It's like anything, [the fans are] slightly nerdy,&quot; he said.
But Roberts said that it's all in good fun. &quot;This is one of few places that
[film] academics get to meet face to face,&quot; he said. Shaw added that, &quot;Some
people have been corresponding for 20 years and never met [until
Slapsticon].&quot;
So while the festival is assured to be a boon for anyone interested in early
film comedies, casual fans may want to skip the post-film repartee.
&quot;My wife is there and she sometimes gets glazed over pretty quickly,&quot; Massa
said. &quot;It gets pretty intense.&quot;
