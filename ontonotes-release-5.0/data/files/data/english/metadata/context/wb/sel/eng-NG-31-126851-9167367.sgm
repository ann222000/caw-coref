Pass the towels! Plans for coed locker rooms
'I cannot put to rest concerns girls might share facilities with
'woman' who is physically male'

The governing council in Montgomery County, Md., is considering
adopting an &quot;open doors&quot; policy to its public restrooms, locker rooms
and other facilities to meet the demands of a transgender
&quot;non-discrimination&quot; plan, which would allow men into women's lockers
and vice versa, a support group reports.

A similar federal non-discrimination plan proposed by homosexual Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., includes a provision that would prevent
&quot;transgenders&quot; from using opposite-sex public facilities in which
being seen &quot;fully unclothed&quot; was unavoidable, according to Peter
Sprigg, a spokesman for Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays &amp; Gays.

But he said correspondence with the county staff shows that such a
provision was considered, and deliberately rejected, in the county
plan, which is scheduled for a vote Nov. 13.

&quot;Montgomery County is unwilling to make any such exception,&quot; he told
WND. &quot;It's very extreme.&quot;

According to notes from city council meetings, Sprigg said, the only
requirement will be that the person using the public facilities,
including showers and locker rooms, be of the gender they present in
public.

&quot;Gender identity disorders exist in the diagnostic statistics manual,&quot;
added PFOX Director Regina Griggs. &quot;Why would we want to promote
cross-dressing, changing your sex. You're not a man's brain in a
woman's body and vice versa.&quot;

She noted the testimony from Dr. Renee Richards, the poster person for
the transgender crowd who was a pace-setter in the man-turned-woman
movement.

&quot;I wish that there could have been an alternative way, but there
wasn't back in 1975. If there was a drug that I could have taken that
would have reduced the pressure, I would have been better off staying
the way I was – as a totally intact person,&quot; Richards is quoted on the
Reality Resources website.

&quot;I know deep down that I'm a second-class woman. I get a lot of
inquiries from would-be transsexuals, but I don't want anyone to hold
me out as an example to follow. Today there are better choices,
including medication, for dealing with the compulsion to cross-dress
and the depression that comes from gender-confusion,&quot; Richards wrote.

The county plan, Bill 23-07, specifically would augment the state's
non-discrimination plan by adding &quot;gender identity&quot; as a protected
class.

&quot;In addition to prohibiting discrimination in the areas of employment
and housing, Bill 23-07 adds 'public accommodation' to the list,
causing many to question the judgment of allowing men who merely claim
they feel female to have complete access to women's restrooms, showers
and locker rooms in schools, and other places of public accommodation
such as health clubs, swimming pools, and store dressing rooms,&quot; PFOX
said in its statement about the issue.

&quot;The council defines 'gender identity' as 'an individual's actual or
perceived gender…,' meaning biological males who see themselves as
females, including cross-dressers, would obtain the right to use
facilities now designated solely for women or girls,&quot; PFOX continued.

&quot;The Montgomery County Council has voiced callousness and arrogance to
the concerns of parents who object. When asked by a mother concerned
about her 10-year-old daughter who swims at the Germantown Indoor
Pool, where she must undress in front of women since there are no
separate changing rooms, if under this law she could be changing next
to a person with male genitals, Council member George Leventhal
responded via email: 'I cannot absolutely put to rest your concern
that girls might find themselves in a locker room or dressing room in
the presence of a person who expresses or asserts herself as a woman
but who still has male genitals, but based on my own sense of the
prevalence of that condition in the population, I think the likelihood
of that occurring is remote,'&quot; PFOX said.

&quot;We are endangering children,&quot; Griggs told WND. &quot;We are trying to
normalize mental illness. We're supposed to help these people.&quot;

The organization noted Leventhal's opinion is that &quot;we should not
worry if a child comes face to face with a nude male stranger (who
merely has expressed he feels he is a woman) seems nothing short of
condescending.&quot;

Griggs said the county response to requests by cross-dressers to use
women's public facilities should be &quot;full access to mental health
services.&quot;

The bill was sponsored by Council members Duchy Trachtenberg, Valerie
Ervin, and Marc Elrich with the support of Equality Maryland, an
organization promoting &quot;gay,&quot; lesbian, bisexual and transgender
issues, PFOX said.

A protest has been scheduled Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon at the
Germantown Indoor Swim Center, said PFOX.

Not only would the proposal govern facilities such as restrooms and
locker rooms in public buildings, other public facilities such as
those in McDonald's, Chucky Cheese and others would be as opened as
well.

This is just the latest battle Griggs and PFOX have encountered in the
region. The pro-homosexual group Truth Wins Out earlier accused her of
fabricating a report that a &quot;gay&quot; assaulted a volunteer at a county
fair booth. Police later confirmed for WND that the incident did
happen as Griggs reported.

In fact, police said they located the suspect based on the victim's
description and ended up escorting him off the fairgrounds.

PFOX also is engaged in a fight in Montgomery County seeking a court
order to halt a public school sex curriculum because it contains
&quot;scientifically flawed and politically biased&quot; information.

The organization joined with Citizens for a Responsible Curriculum and
the Family Leader Network in filing the request for the court-ordered
stay of the program targeting middle school and high school students
in the district.

The organizations said the local board, headed by Nancy Navarro,
adopted the curriculum that teaches anal sex as unexceptional and
&quot;intentionally excludes&quot; warnings issued by the Centers for Disease
Control and the National Institutes of Health of the high medical
dangers related to those behaviors.

&quot;The curriculum also teaches students that homosexuality is 'innate,'
a controversial and unproven theory advanced by gay advocacy groups
serving on the Montgomery County School Board's curriculum advisory
committee,&quot; the groups' statement said.

Edward L. White III, trial counsel with the Thomas More Law Center, a
prominent public interest law firm based in Ann Arbor, Mich., is
assisting PFOX and the pro-family groups in their lawsuit against the
school board.

The curriculum includes lessons intended for eighth-graders and adopts
the language and points of emphasis employed by promoters of
homosexuality. Also, 10th-graders will be taught about making
announcements that they are homosexual and how to use a condom.
