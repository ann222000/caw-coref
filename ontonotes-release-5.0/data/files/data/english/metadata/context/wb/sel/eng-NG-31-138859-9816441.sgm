*HEPATITIS C*

Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by infection with the hepatitis C
virus. The liver becomes swollen and tender (inflamed) and may develop
permanent damage, such as scarring or liver cancer.

Initial symptoms of hepatitis C are mild and include fatigue, headache, sore
muscles, abdominal pain, and sometimes dark urine. Hepatitis C is diagnosed
with blood tests, but the disease can go unnoticed until years later after
liver damage develops.

Hepatitis C is spread through sharing contaminated needles, infected blood,
and very rarely through unprotected sex with an infected partner.

Treatment for hepatitis C includes antiviral medications and supportive
therapy. A liver transplant is sometimes needed.

Home Treatment Some people with hepatitis
C&lt; http://health.yahoo.com/hepatitis-living/hepatitis-c/healthwise--sth1... &gt;do
not notice a huge difference in the way they feel. Others feel tired,
sick, or depressed. The following are steps you can take at home that may
help you feel better both physically and emotionally.
Slow down It is very common to feel tired if you have hepatitis C. If you
feel tired, give yourself permission to do less and rest more. If possible,
ask others to help out around your home or ask your employer for a shorter
or more flexible work schedule.
Exercise Exercise if you feel up to it. Aerobic exercise can help you have
more energy and may also improve depression. It is best to avoid any
strenuous activities on the day after you receive peginterferon.
Eat regular, nutritious meals Sometimes, people with hepatitis C have a hard
time eating. You may have no appetite, feel nauseated, or have different
tastes than you are used to. Even if you do not feel like eating, it is very
important to eat small meals throughout the day. Some people experience
nausea in the afternoon; if this is the case, try to eat a big, nutritious
meal in the morning.

If you have cirrhosis, it may not be a good idea to eat salty foods or foods
that are high in protein. If you want to know more about which foods to
avoid and which foods are good to eat, ask your doctor about meeting
with a registered
dietitian&lt; http://health.yahoo.com/hepatitis-living/registered-dietitian/healthw... &gt;to
discuss a healthy eating plan.
Avoid alcohol and drugs One of the most important jobs of your liver is to
break down drugs and alcohol. If you have hepatitis C, one of the best
things you can do is to avoid substances that may harm your liver such as
alcohol and illegal drugs. If you have cirrhosis, you also may need to avoid
certain medicines.

If you use illegal drugs or alcohol, it is important to stop. Being honest
with your doctor about your drug and alcohol use will help you deal with any
substance abuse problems. If you do not feel that you can talk openly with
your doctor, you may want to find a doctor you feel more comfortable with.
If you want to stop using drugs or alcohol and need help to do so, ask your
doctor or someone else you trust about drug and alcohol treatment options.

Because many medicines can stress your liver, talk to your doctor before you
take any medicines, either prescription or over-the-counter. This includes
herbal remedies as well.
Control itching If you develop itchy skin, ask your doctor about taking
nonprescription medicines, such as diphenhydramine (for example, Benadryl)
or chlorpheniramine (for example, Chlor-Trimeton), to relieve itching. If
you do take these medicines, be sure to follow the instructions and to stop
using the medicine if you have any side effects.
Seek help for depression
Depression&lt; http://health.yahoo.com/hepatitis-living/depression/healthwise--std12... &gt;may
develop in anyone who has a long-term illness. It also can be a side
effect of antiviral medicines for hepatitis C. If you are feeling depressed,
talk to your doctor about antidepressant medicines or counseling. For more
information, see the topic
Depression&lt; http://health.yahoo.com/article/healthwise--hw30711/ &gt;
.
Learn about the disease Learning about hepatitis C may help you feel more in
control of the disease. The more you understand, the better you can make
decisions about treatment and lifestyle changes that may help you feel
better, both physically and emotionally.

Alternative Treatments for Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is a serious
communicable (contagious) disease of the liver that is caused by the
hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C and its implications were identified
only recently. There still is much to learn about the disease, the virus
that causes it, and treatment options—both conventional and alternative.

About 3 million Americans are infected with HCV, and many of them do not
even know they have it. Other forms of viral hepatitis usually resolve
without treatment. But most people with HCV—85 percent—develop chronic
(frequent or long-lasting) hepatitis C. The majority of people infected with
HCV show no symptoms for up to 20 to 30 years. During that time, though, the
infection may be slowly damaging the person's liver.
The virus can be found in a number of organs of the body. However, the
infection is spread mainly by contact with the blood of an infected person.
Once a person is infected, the body's immune (disease-fighting) system
cannot combat the virus very well.

Most people with chronic hepatitis C develop long-term liver disease, which
interferes with the liver's ability to work properly. Some patients
eventually develop cirrhosis (scarring of the liver); some get liver cancer;
and some even die from liver disease.
Repeated injections of regular (&quot;conventional&quot;) drugs, like interferon,
currently available to treat chronic hepatitis C get rid of the virus only
in approximately 30 to 40 percent of infected people. In addition, these
drugs can produce unbearable side effects. So, many people are looking to
complementary and alternative therapies for help.
Alternative Care No complementary medicine or alternative medicine therapies
have been scientifically proven to cure or even ease symptoms of hepatitis
C.

However, some people are turning to herbs for relief. They use herbs either
to help with hepatitis itself or to deal with side effects of interferon.
These harmful side effects can include: sudden hearing loss; anemia and
other forms of low blood cell counts; headaches; heart, eye, liver, or
kidney problems; and disorders of the mind, including depression. Among
potential herbal therapies (including licorice root, ginseng, ginger, and
St. John's wort) for hepatitis C, the most promising alternative treatment
seems to be the herb commonly called milk thistle.

Preliminary studies in animals show that milk thistle may help protect the
liver from injury by a variety of toxins (&quot;poisons&quot; such as drugs, viruses,
alcohol, radiation, and poisonous mushrooms) and limit the damage from them.
To date, the most reliable, and also quite preliminary, studies on people
show that milk thistle does not cure liver disease, but that it may improve
the way the liver works in patients with cirrhosis. However, there is no
current evidence to indicate that milk thistle directly affects HCV.

In Germany, where many herbs are regulated and prescribed like drugs, health
authorities have approved milk thistle as a complementary treatment (given
in addition to conventional drugs) for cirrhosis, hepatitis, and similar
liver conditions. But a great deal of research still is needed before this
alternative therapy could be considered a standard treatment option in the
United States.
Milk Thistle Milk thistle originally is from Europe, but now it also is
grown in the United States. Its scientific name is *Silybum marianum*. The
ingredient that experts believe is responsible for its medicinal qualities
is called silymarin. Silymarin is found in the fruits of the milk thistle
plant. Studies in animals have shown that this active ingredient promotes
the following activities:

*Liver Cell Growth*—Silymarin appears to promote the growth of some types of
cells in the liver.

*Antioxidation*—Silymarin may be an effective &quot;antioxidant,&quot; which means it
may help fight a destructive chemical process in the body known as
&quot;oxidation.&quot; In oxidation, harmful substances produced in the body (called
free radicals) can damage cells. Some studies suggest that silymarin can
prevent these substances from damaging liver cells.

*Antihepatotoxic Activity*—Studies suggest that silymarin can block various
types of toxins from entering and injuring liver cells.

*Inflammation Inhibition*—Silymarin is thought to prevent inflammation
(swelling) of the liver; this may be described as displaying
anti-inflammatory properties.
Milk thistle is not used to prevent HCV from causing liver disease. Rather,
it is used with the hope that it would minimize the damage to the liver that
HCV can cause.
Studies of Milk Thistle in People Although studies in animals provide a good
deal of information on potential new treatments, studies in humans are
needed before it can be determined if these therapies are appropriate, safe,
and effective in people. The most rigorous type of study to establish a
scientific basis for use of a new therapy in people is a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled (RDBPC) trial.

Although not focused primarily on HCV disease, the most relevant existing
research data regarding milk thistle's use as a therapy for hepatitis comes
from two RDBPC trials of silymarin's effects on cirrhosis. The two studies
produced conflicting results.
The first, reported in 1989, examined 170 patients with cirrhosis from
various causes, including alcohol abuse. Approximately half (87) of the
patients received silymarin (140 milligrams 3 times a day for 2 years). The
others (83 patients) received a placebo. Because 24 patients dropped out of
the study, a total of 146 patients (73 in each group) finished the 2-year
study.

The doctors in this study noted that the number of patients who died in the
4 years after the study was 31 percent lower in the group that received the
silymarin than in the group of patients who received the placebo. The
beneficial effects of silymarin were especially seen in the patients who had
cirrhosis as a result of alcohol abuse. The doctors did not report that any
patients experienced side effects from silymarin treatment.

A more recent RDBPC trial, however, did not find silymarin to have any
significant benefits for patients with cirrhosis. In this study, reported in
1998, doctors examined 200 patients with cirrhosis caused by alcohol abuse.
Approximately half (103) of the patients received silymarin (150 milligrams
3 times a day for 2 years). The other half (97) received a placebo. A total
of 125 patients (57 in the treatment group and 68 in the placebo group)
finished the 2-year study. To measure effectiveness, the doctors measured
(1) time to death and (2) the worsening of the disease.

Survival was similar in both the silymarin and placebo groups, and silymarin
did not seem to improve the course of the disease in the treatment group.
The doctors who performed the experiment did not note side effects in any of
the patients.
Although small, one randomized controlled trial on hepatitis patients
suggests that a specific component in silymarin may be beneficial in
managing chronic hepatitis. In this study, reported in 1993, 10 patients
with chronic hepatitis were assigned to the treatment group and 10 others
were assigned to the placebo group. The treatment group received 240
milligrams of silybin, a component of silymarin, two times a day for 1 week.
The results of tests that measure how well the liver is functioning showed
significant improvement in the treatment group, suggesting that silybin may
help treat chronic hepatitis.

Milk thistle in the treatment of liver disease needs to be studied further.
Fortunately, negative side effects have not yet been reported, and this
herbal therapy may be much less expensive than conventional drug therapies.
Yet, it should be mentioned that conventional therapies have been proven to
work in a substantial portion of patients.
Because milk thistle does not dissolve well in water, the herb is not
effective in the form of a tea. It currently is marketed in the United
States as a dietary supplement in the form of capsules containing 200
milligrams of a concentrated extract with 140 milligrams of silymarin.
Other Herbs That May Help *Licorice Root*—Herbalists use tea made with
licorice root to manage some of the effects hepatitis has on the liver. The
scientific name for licorice root is *Glycyrrhiza glabra*, and its active
component is called glycyrrhizin. Studies suggest that licorice root
displays antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties.

Licorice root does come with a warning, however. If taken regularly (more
than 3 grams of licorice root a day for more than 6 weeks, or more than 100
milligrams of glycyrrhizin a day), this herb can cause the following
conditions in some people: high blood pressure, sodium and water retention,
low potassium levels in the bloodstream, and disturbance of an important
electrolyte balancing system in the body.
Signs and symptoms of excessive licorice root consumption may include
headache, sluggishness, puffiness and swollen ankles, and even heart failure
or cardiac arrest (when the heart suddenly stops beating).

Glycyrrhizin has been used in Japan for more than 20 years as a treatment
for chronic hepatitis.  In a 1998 review of several randomized controlled
trials, researchers reported that treatment with glycyrrhizin is effective
in easing liver disease in some people. Several of the trials reviewed
indicated improvements in liver tissue that had been damaged by hepatitis.
Some of them also showed improvements in how well the liver does its job.

A 1997 experiment suggested that glycyrrhizin also may help prevent the
development of liver cancer in patients with chronic hepatitis C.  The use
of glycyrrhizin as a complementary therapy (in addition to conventional use
of interferon drugs) has been studied, but no significant benefit has been
found yet.

*Ginseng*—Tests on animals and on human tissues suggest that ginseng may
help the body's disease-fighting and glandular systems. Tests in small
animals also suggest that ginseng may help improve the way the liver works
and reduce damage to liver tissue caused by hepatitis and similar
conditions.  However, a search of the current literature shows no studies in
people that test ginseng's helpfulness for hepatitis. Only one study,
conducted in Italy, shows that ginseng may be helpful for elderly people
with liver conditions similar to hepatitis.

There are two true ginsengs—American ginseng (*Panax quinquefolius*) and
Asian ginseng (*Panax ginseng*), which includes Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean ginseng. Siberian ginseng (*Eleutherococcus senticosus*) is not a
true ginseng. It is hard to get authentic ginseng products. Companies that
market herbs for sale have poor quality control, so the quality of the
different brands varies widely. A 1990 analysis of 54 available ginseng
products revealed that 85 percent of them contained little or no ginseng at
all! Ginseng most often is taken as a tea.
Herbs That May Ease Interferon's Effects *Ginger*—For 2,500 years, the
Chinese have used ginger (*Zingiber officinale*) to treat nausea. Some, but
not all, research studies confirm that ginger may reduce nausea. This herb
may relieve nausea and vomiting caused by interferon drug therapy in some
patients with hepatitis C. Ginger generally is recognized as safe and is not
known to cause any serious side effects. Ginger is relatively inexpensive
and readily available. It most commonly is taken in the form of a tea.

*St. John's Wort*—Some patients with hepatitis C take the herb St. John's
wort (*Hypericum perforatum*) to treat depression caused by interferon drug
therapy. Although St. John's wort is not a proven treatment for depression,
studies have shown that it does have antidepressive effects over the short
term. Although research largely has been done using capsules of this herb,
St. John's wort also is taken as a tea. There is no proof yet that St.
John's wort is effective and safe over the long term.
St. John's wort does not require a prescription, and it is less expensive
and may have fewer side effects than prescription antidepressant drugs.
Tests in people reveal it may cause side effects such as fatigue, dry mouth,
dizziness, digestive tract symptoms, and increased sensitivity to sunlight.
If You Have Hepatitis C

- Get an accurate diagnosis from your doctor. Hepatitis C infection
can be diagnosed only by using sophisticated blood tests available to all
doctors.

- Tell your doctor about all of the medications you are taking, even
any over-the-counter drugs or herbs or other alternative therapies you may
be using. Because the liver plays a key role in processing drugs, alcohol,
and toxins in the bloodstream, medications, alcoholic beverages, and certain
herbs can make the disease worse.

- Consider being vaccinated against hepatitis A and B. Unlike
hepatitis A and B, previous infection with HCV does not make you immune to
it in the future. Infection with HCV also does not prevent you from becoming
infected with other types of hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, D, E, and G).

- Do not try to treat the disease yourself.

- Do not donate blood.

- Do not drink alcohol, because it can further damage your already
diseased liver.

- Do not share needles if you use injection drugs.

Important Terms *Active Treatment*  The treatment being tested by the
experiment.

*Alternative Medicine*  Medical systems, therapies, and techniques that
mainstream Western (conventional) medicine does not commonly use, accept,
study, understand, or make available. Alternative medicine includes
practices usually used instead of conventional medical practices.
Alternative health care practices include a vast array of treatments and
beliefs, which may be well-known, exotic, mysterious, or even dangerous.
They are based on no common or consistent philosophy or school of thought. A
few of the many alternative medicine practices include the use of
acupuncture, homeopathy, herbs, therapeutic massage, and traditional
oriental medicine to promote well-being or treat health conditions.
*Complementary Medicine*  Alternative medical systems used in conjunction
with or in addition to conventional medicine to further promote health. For
example, a person may use herbal remedies to ease some of the side effects,
such as nausea, of certain conventional drugs.

*Controls*  Patients who do not receive the treatment being studied; the
experimental group is compared to the control group to objectively evaluate
the treatment's effectiveness.

*Double-Blind*  A type of study in which neither the participants nor the
doctors giving the treatments know who is getting the active treatment and
who is getting the placebo.

*Liver*  A large gland in the upper abdomen that is essential to life.
Important liver functions include: helping the body produce or make use of
the fats, sugars, proteins, vitamins, and most other compounds it needs; and
reducing the ill effects of poisons, such as alcohol and nicotine, in the
body.

*Placebo*  A presumably pharmacologically inactive or &quot;fake&quot; treatment. If
in the form of a pill, a placebo sometimes is referred to as a &quot;dummy pill&quot;
or &quot;sugar pill.&quot;

*Placebo-Controlled*  A type of study of usually one group of subjects to
distinguish the specific and nonspecific effects of the active treatment.
Randomized Study participants are assigned without bias to particular arms
of a study.

*Side Effects*  Unintended, and usually undesirable, reactions that result
from a treatment.

*Virus*  A tiny organism that can only grow in the cells of an animal or a
person. Several hundred viruses have been found to cause diseases in people.
