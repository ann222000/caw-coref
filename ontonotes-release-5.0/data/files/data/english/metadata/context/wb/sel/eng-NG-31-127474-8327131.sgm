Here is a review by Roger Ebert of _September Dawn_, which probably is
a pretty crappy movie but Ebert's review is largely a defense of
religion. Since Del seems to be gone, we need a relatively smart
theist to speak out so I will simply reply to Ebert's review and let
those of you who agree with him speak up.

---EBERT---
On Sept. 11, 1857, at the Mountain Meadows Massacre, a group of
fanatic Mormons attacked and slaughtered a wagon train of about 120
settlers passing through Utah on their way to California. Can we all
agree that the date has no significance? No, we cannot, because
&quot;September Dawn&quot; is at pains to point out that on another Sept. 11,
another massacre took place, again spawned by religion.

But hold on. Where did I get that word &quot;fanatic&quot;? In my opinion, when
anybody believes their religion gives them the right to kill other
people, they are fanatics. Aren't there enough secular reasons for
war? But there is no shortage of such religions, or such people. The
innocent, open-faced Christians on the wagon train were able to
consider settling California, after all, because their some of their
co-religionists participated in or benefitted from the enslavement of
Africans and the genocide of Native Americans.

---DEV---
Yes, there _are_ enough secular reasons for war. This is why we don't
need religion. By Ebert's definition of &quot;fanatic&quot; anyone who believes
The Bible or The Q'uran is a fanatic because both books say with no
ambiguity that you should kill certain people in the name of God.

---EBERT---
Were there fanatics among those who ran the Salem Witch Trials or the
Inquisition or the Crusades? Or the Holocaust? No shortage of them.
Organized religion has been used to justify most of the organized
killing in our human history. It's an inescapable fact, especially if
you consider the Nazis and communists as cults led by secular gods.
When your god inspires you to murder someone who worships god in a
different way or under another name, you're barking up the wrong god.

---DEV---
Why bark up any god at all? I've been reading Ebert's reviews for
years and he's basically a very liberal Catholic and now he's probably
about to die (he still writes good reviews but hasn't been on TV for
about a year because he can't talk because his cancer has gotten so
bad) which probably makes him more desperate for God. For the record,
Hitler should not be classified as simply a &quot;secular god&quot; like Stalin
because he did say on a regular basis that he was speaking for the
Christian God and prayed to him publicly.

---EBERT---
The vast majority of the members of all religions, I believe and would
argue, don't want to kill anybody. They want to love and care for
their families, find decent work that sustains life and comfort, live
in peace and get along with their neighbors. It is a deviant streak in
some humans, I suspect, that drives them toward self-righteous
violence, and uses religion as a convenient alibi.

---DEV---
Most hardcore racists don't want to kill anybody either. But they
perpetuate racism that will inevitably lead certain people to
violence. Since we obviously don't need racism, let's just drop it.
Same for religion. Ebert here implies that people simply kill because
people have killing built into them. They do, but religion clearly
causes them to kill more and for stupider reasons.

Ebert is also making the mistake of mixing up theists and theism.
Theists, on their own, probably don't want to kill people but they are
guilty of perpetuating theism--which does unnecessarily kill people.
If only killers believed in God religion would probably vanish in a
few generations because their beliefs would no longer be justified by
society in general. Even if society frowns on many of the violent
actions committed by theists, it still encourages the beliefs that
fuel these actions by encouraging faith as a good thing.

---EBERT---
That is true, wouldn't you agree, about Mormons, Christians, Muslims,
Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and so on? No, not all of you would agree,
because every time I let slip the opinion that most Muslims are
peaceful and nonviolent, for example, I receive the most extraordinary
hate mail from those assuring me they are not. And in a Muslim land,
let a newspaper express the opinion that most Christians and Jews are
peaceful and nonviolent, and that newspaper office is likely to be
burned down. The worst among us speak for the best.

---DEV---
Again, Ebert tries to seperate theists from theism. You can't do that.
Theists perpetuate theism, and they are partially responsible for the
repercussions of what they perpetuate. It's true that most Muslims
aren't _directly_ violent, but for every Muslim that gets caught
killing in the name of Islam there are at least twenty cheering him
on. Christians are often the same way, as literally thousands cheered
on the homophobic murder of Matthew Shepard. The Westboro Baptist
Church even had a cute little animation of him burning in fire after
picketing his funeral.

---EBERT---
Which brings us back to Sept. 11, 1857, when a crazy Mormon zealot
named Bishop John Samuelson (Jon Voight) ordered the massacre of the
visiting wagon train, after first sending his spokesman to lie that if
they disarmed, they would be granted safe passage. Whether the leader
of his church, Brigham Young (Terence Stamp), approved of this action
is a matter of much controversy, denied by the church, claimed by
&quot;September Dawn.&quot;

What a strange, confused, unpleasant movie this is. Two theories have
clustered around it: (1) It is anti-Mormon propaganda to muddy the
waters around the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, or (2) it is
not about Mormons at all, but an allegory about the 9/11/01
terrorists. Take your choice. The problem with allegories is that you
can plug them in anywhere. No doubt the film would have great impact
in Darfur.

---DEV---
Religious violence is comparable to religious violence. It is never
drastically different. People take this thing that has no point or
evidence or sanity to back it up, and it unites them to kill and it
never would have happened if they just reserved judgment instead of
having faith because they read a book or (more likely) someone told
them something and they simply chose to believe it against all reason.

---EBERT---
There isn't anything to be gained in telling this story in this way.
It generates bad feelings on all sides,

--DEV---
Sounds like The Bible, which is why I won't watch it.

---EBERT---
and at a time when Mormons are at pains to explain they are
Christians, underlines the way that these Mormons consider all
Christians to be &quot;gentiles.&quot;

---DEV---
The nicest thing that can be said about Mor(m)ons is that you could
argue that they aren't Christians.

---EBERT---
The Mormons are presented in no better light than Nazis and Japanese
were in Hollywood's World War II films. Wasn't there a more thoughtful
and insightful way to consider this historical event? Or how about a
different event altogether? What about the Donner Party? They may have
been cannibals, but at least they were nondenominational.

---DEV---
Even if this was an awful film, and I believe it probably was, more
movies need to made about how much religion sucks. I hear Bill Maher
is involved in a documentary about this exact topic.

While Ebert is generally a great film critic, and I do believe this
movie is probably pretty lame, I can't help but feel his sensibilities
are simply getting offended and I think the last paragraph proves it.

---EBERT---
If there is a concealed blessing, it is that the film is so bad. Jon
Voight, that gifted and versatile actor, is here given the most
ludicrous and unplayable role of his career, and a goofy beard to
boot. Stamp, as Brigham Young, comes across as the kind of man you'd
find at the back of a cave in a Cormac McCarthy novel. The Christians
are so scrubbed and sunny, they could have been teleported in time
from the Lawrence Welk program.

---DEV---
Why would a film critic _want_ a movie to be bad unless he felt
vulnerable and defensive about something? I want a good version of
this movie to be made. I want a good, sweeping epic history of
religion from day one in two hours. Bring the barf bag--it would be
the goriest horror film of all time.

This is a good point that needs to be emphasized over and over until
people finally get it.  Liberal or moderate theists have blood on
their
hands for perpetuating this idea that religion and faith are wonderful
things to be respected and tolerated.

Since a lot of people who go to church are good people, then religion
must be a good thing, right?  I mean, if those people didn't have
religion,
then they'd all be out raping and killing, right?  Thank God for
religion!

Right. Theists are playing the handicap card in so many ways. Not only
do atheists have to be reasonable and have proof whereas they do not
(according to them), but evidently atheists are just these freaks of
nature that can live moral lives without fairy tales.
