Hi Jeisea!

Great idea, as the list gets larger, recreating and reposting as a new
Revision list.

Hi All!

If anyone else can come up with more idea's please shout out this is
the time.

Normally the group focus is our health, but Jeisea, and myself feel
that this is so important for the group to continue to stay up and
running that we need to focus on this for the time being.  Please stay
very aware of these posts until we have brushed them out.

Thanks for your patience and idea's pertaining to this discussion!

Hugs

Rain

Jeisea and Rain,

Thank you for taking time to nurture our group from the ground up.
These foundational tidy ups will only make our group stronger and able
to support further growth.

Hugs to you both,
