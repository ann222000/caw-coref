Yep -- no anime Armageddon to see here...  Move along...

The long boom is petering out, and it will get worse as the
mainstreaming continues where only mainstream anime will get licensed
and sold because if it can't air on Cartoon Network etc. it probably
won't make it legally over here.

In the last couple of years, I've bought nearly all of my ADV product
after seeing them pimped on  &quot;DVD Dojo&quot; or sampling one or two episodes
via &quot;Anime Network&quot; VOD on Comcast.  Our VOD offerings were restructured
recently, and &quot;AN&quot; moved up to a pricier package.  I'm not upgrading my
cable service - that cash is better spent on shipping my Japanese orders -
so now that Utawarerumono's complete, I have no ADV titles on my release
calendar, and little prospect of adding any.  I suppose I could watch DVD
Dojo online, but I don't find the reduced size/sound appealing enough to
bother looking for it.  Dunno what Comcast's strategy is, but ADV's
marketing impact suffered as a result.  Just a lonely data point.

The base has been expanding thus the boom.  The only way they can move

out there can do that.  I just don't have the faith that the rest of you

I share the same concern as you.  I have tried to encourage my friends to
watch some of the less objectionable shows and they still have a hard time
with it.   A friend of my Wife exclaimed that Anime was Japanese porn when
she said she was going to an Anime convention.  Fighting the stereo types
that prevent acceptance will be hard.

The challenge with anime series is trying to convince someone who's never
seen any of it to purchase it.  This is further complicated by the problem
that ADV does single-disc releases first, then does a complete boxset once
the series is finished.  The boxset is like 60% less than the individual
discs - thus screwing the diehard fans who bought the single discs in the
first place.  This is why I never buy ANY anime until I get that
discounted boxset.  But, then, what about shows I've never heard of?  It's
one thing to take a gamble on a $20 disc, but a whole series for $60-80?

The other thing I don't understand the reason I would  buy on DVD is to
get the show in its original format - that being uncut, spoken Japanese (with
English subtitles).  If ADV starts hawking editted-for-the-US-market DVDs,
then they'll lose me entirely as a customer.

Airing on Cartoon Network, et.al., may not be as great as it sounds for
one simple reason: why pay for DVDs when you get it for free (less the
monthly cable bill) on TV?  That has to adversely affect retail sales.

ADV has had some marketing issues.  Most notable is releasing thinpacks
within a couple of months of finishing up regular runs at steeply
discounted prices.  I'm all for repackaging older shows?  But if I know
that a publisher is going to do a budget repack within 6 months of the
last &quot;premium&quot; DVD of the set then I am going to seriously consider
waiting for the repack.

Frankly, I could consider that a win.  One of the reasons I like fansubs is
that a DVD of 26 episodes (or 20, the way fansubbers are encoding, anymore)
takes a lot less space in my Case Logic than six DVDs do on my shelf.  As
long as I could acquire the license, and the price was right, I would LOVE
for the industry to go with that model.

Highly improbable, since 90% of anime fans - myself included - are primarily

As much as science-fiction-type shows are making it mainstream, like
&quot;Heroes&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot; and the like, surely someone could manage to
market some SF genre anime to a larger audience.  If GitS:SAC and
2nd Gig can make it to mainstream in Japan, it ought to make it here,
if it was sold correctly.  Probably have to try it out on HBO or one
of the premium cable channels, something to get it out of the &quot;fringe&quot;
ghetto.

Ah, well, not likely to happen.  But it would be nice.

Well, if you cover enough of the image with a squirming ad banner, cut
the opening and ending credits, trim important plot points for
commercial breaks, and show the episodes out of order and with long
midseason hiatuses... by that point it looks suspiciously like the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep -- no anime Armageddon to see here...  Move along...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the even-bigger story could be the &quot;shifting priorities&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proposed in this article as well...

&gt;&gt;&gt; The long boom is petering out, and it will get worse as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; mainstreaming continues where only mainstream anime will get licensed
&gt;&gt;&gt; and sold because if it can't air on Cartoon Network etc. it probably
&gt;&gt;&gt; won't make it legally over here.

&gt;&gt; Or at least as they start to realize that fans, even paying ones, don't have
&gt;&gt; infinite bank accounts.  We can't afford to buy every release anymore, like
&gt;&gt; we did in 1996.

&gt;    And maybe they need to expand the base of fans, instead of just trying
&gt;    to sell to us in the existing base.  After all, once you buy the
&gt;    series' that you like, there's no reason to buy them again, they need
&gt;    to try to sell those series' to people who don't yet know they'll like
&gt;    anime.  Now, how they do that is another question, but it's a matter
&gt;    of marketing.
">

That's a good point.  It's hard for somethig to become mainstream if it's
not marketed as such.  Pokemon is a case in point.  It quickly became
mainstream but it was marketed quite differently from other anime.

Actually, just about every technology or innovation requires early adopters.
It's just that, in many cases, the early adopter is the government (ie,
technology that starts out with military use).  Another issue is often the

">

That doesn't appear to be what's happening.  It just looks like the US
companies have overextended themselves a little bit.  Not only has that
created a supply/demand imbalance but it has driven up the license fees.
As a result of this, the market is going through a readjustment phase.

The Japanese are not translating and subbing their works.  They generally
rely on the foreign market to localize the properrties.  A good indication
of this is the practice of the Japanese anime satellite channel, Animax,
when operating in non-Japanese markets.  For example, the preponderence of
Animax's Southeast Asia and South Asia English language broadcasts rely
either on officially licensed English language versions or outsourcing the
localization to a company in the target market.

The point you raise about the Japanese offering anime for legal download
over the net is worth considering.  The Japanese are, in fact,
experimenting with delivery of TV and other media content over the
internet.  However, this is restricted to the Japanese market.  The most
ambitious undertaking, for example, is GyaO.  It's a broadcast model that
delivers a broad spectrum (including anime) of high quality internet video
on demand that you can watch on a PC or PC hooked to a TV through a device
provided by GyaO.  However, it's available only to Japanese IP addresses
and there are no immediate plans to expand to foreign markets.

The bottom line is that Funimation and ADV bit off a little more than they
could chew and now they have to adjust accordingly - at least, they don't
have quite the uphill battle facing Geneon and Bandai.  Significantly, many
of the Funimation layoffs were in the online area which would argue against
web-based delivery affecting DVD sales.  Even if, as you suggest, the
online impetus were to come from Japan, it would stand to reason that North
American companies would beef up in their online departments to assist in
the localization.  The evidence indicates that, although there have been
some small experiments, it'll be a while before we see a mature online
anime distribution business model in North America.

Couldn't agree more.  Even when anime was first becoming available in North
America, VHS dub tapes would outsell VHS sub tapes by an order of

Well, that's not quite right :) There was a standard $5 price
difference when a company released a dub and sub of the same title,
regardless of the price level. Thus Blue Seed TV cost $25 dubbed and
$30 subbed from ADV (two episodes), while You're Under Arrest OAV cost
$15 dub and $20 sub from AnimEigo (one episode). This goes back to the
earliest days of US anime, when Streamline charged $30 for its dubbed
movies and everyone else charged $35 for their subbed OAVs. When they
later entered the dub market, they had to match Streamline's lower
prices but could keep sub prices up as they were targeted at a
different fan base.

ADV does have some marketing issues but, judging from my buying practices,
their thinpack policies is not one of them.  The series I've bought on
thinpack are ones that I had not planned on purchasing - Chrono Crusade,
Aquarian Age, etc.  I buy them because they are great deals.  In contrast,
there are shows that I eagerly anticipate and buy as soon as they are
released - Chevalier, Utawarerumono, etc.  When I'm interested in a series
and buy the releases as they come out, I'm also interested in the thinpack
sets that I buy as gifts.

Couldn't agree more on both counts.  The organization doing the
localization needs to be in touch with its market arguing for a local firm.
On the topic of distribution, even though it did not come to fruition, the
Geneon/ADV deal illustrated that a company in the local market is better
situated to distribute properties than a local branch of a foreign company.

&gt; &gt; earliest days of US anime, when Streamline charged $30 for its dubbed
&gt; &gt; movies and everyone else charged $35 for their subbed OAVs. When they
&gt; &gt; later entered the dub market, they had to match Streamline's lower

&gt; &gt; different fan base.

&gt; My recollection is that subs like Plastic Little, Devil Hunter Yohko, etc.
&gt; were $35.

For clamshell packaged subs, yes that was the going price at the start
(as I noted above ^_^) Once they dropped the expensive packaging ADV
dropped prices down to the $30 everyone else was then charging.
Pioneer's Tenchi was also $35 for a sub in a clamshell.

That came later. When Manga entered the US market, they priced their
tapes much lower then others and forced prices down. Remember, that $15
was for a 25 minute episode :) Streamline, on its last gasp with its
Orion deal, also had rock bottom prices and I'm pretty sure AnimEigo
had $15 dubs for You're Under Arrest and later the re-release of OMG
dubbed.

Yup. Naturally, it helped that it was in fact a good fun dub. That's

Software Sculptors was great for the fans.  They had a very aggressive
pricing policy - $19.99 per tape and quite a few episodes per tape.  They
didn't dub many titles like Miku and Zenki although they were later dubbed
for the DVD releases.  However, Slayers demonstrated that they were capable
of exceptional dubs.  Lisa Ortiz playing Lina Inverse was phenomenal - all
the more so because of the inevitable comparisons with Hayashibara Megumi
who was the Japanese seiyuu.

&gt; &gt; I think you're right -- but for a different reason.

&gt; &gt; I think what's going to happen is that you're going to see the

&gt; &gt; figures.
&gt; That doesn't appear to be what's happening.  It just looks like the US

&gt; As a result of this, the market is going through a readjustment phase.

Uh, guys, you do know that in the recent ADV case, they also hired
7 new staff positions when they layed off the 13 positions being
discussed.  They restructured a bit, which suggests to me at least
one of their experiments may have worked.  I'm wondering if that
would be one of their online experiments.

I imagine quite a lot of buyers are like me.  I assume that ADV analyzes
its sales performance and determines when best to release the thinpacks.
If their sales strategy was flawed, it would be quickly apparent in a drop
in the sale of singles and a corresponding rise in the sale of box sets.  I
talked to a couple of ADV executives a couple of years ago on the topic.
They said their goal was to make ADV the company of choice for anime
buyers.  In other words, all else being equal, they wanted consumers to
feel better about ADV than their competitors.

IMHO I think ADV has succeeded.  Consumers can count on ADV for providing
reasonably priced products with high quality localization (subs and dubs)
and attractive packaging.  Consumers are provided choices in formats.  Avid
collectors will buy versions with all the goodies and casual buyers will go
for bargain offerings.

At least ADVs practice of providing high quality releases followed by

It's pure profit for them. The American companies give them money and
they don't have to do anything else for it. If the Japanese companies
were to sub their own stuff, they wouldn't get that money/lumpsum and
they'd have to hire translators and the like to staff the endeavor and
sell it themselves, etc. A lot of work/effort.

Also, I suspect the Japanese companies wouldn't have much of a clue of
what to market in the US (or Europe or whatever) show-wise, that would
end up being worth their time and money to localize (well, barring
things like Naruto -- but there are only so many of these shows to
sell).

And then, there was Toei. *shudder*

&gt;experiments, it'll be a while before we see a mature online anime

For me, here is my ideal world wrt US companies and their anime
distribution policies (esp online anime).

- The first four episodes of any given TV series are offered on an
online service for free (free subscription is fine). Smallish and VHS
quality (watchable, but not great). I wouldn't ever use bit torrent
for anime again if they would ever offer some kind of reasonable
*preview* of their properties (1.5min music videos don't count).

- Then, if you like the show, you can:
1) buy the DVDs (or HD or Blu, whatever) off the shelf, or
2) you can pay a % fee of the DVD (or whatever) cost to watch it
online instead. Or whatever black-box hardware the service would
provide you when you subscribe to it -- select an episode and the
hardware spits out a freshly burned DVD or whatever

I personally like the hard copies. I want the nicely packaged DVD case
in my hand to look at with the pretty box art. I could do without the
plushies and t-shirts and the like though. I'm on the fence about
soundtracks. Really, I just want an artbox to put all of the series DVDs
in with no extra physical bonus items to increase the price/cost of the
Artbox (on-disc extras are fine).

I would also prefer that series be released in slim cases, ESPECIALLY
for ones unendingly long like Detective Conan, Kodocha (100+ eps), One
Piece, Inu Yasha, etc. 30 normal sized DVDs can take up quite a bit of
space. Card Captor Sakura I think is my largest single-series DVD
collection, at 17 TV series plus the two DVD Movies, so 19 total.

I have lately been gravitating more toward boxsets because of space
concerns, rather than cost savings. I actually don't mind that ADV
strips the extras -- if you pay more you should get something extra
(sorry Dave!). However given my desire to save on space and Dave's anger
at the on-disc extras-stripping, perhaps they could release two boxsets
-- the economy slimbox ($40 usd) for the people who just want the series
and don't care about extras and the premium slimbox ($100 usd) for the
people who want all the extras and bonuses too (Media Blasters did this
with Twelve Kingdoms and I find that I kind of like it -- I don't have
the second box yet but even with the &quot;economy box&quot; out I think I will
still get the premium box for the second set).

I'm not really sure any more where I was going with this so I'll just
stop. :P

Same here.  My wife and I are going through Inuyasha (again for me,
mostly for the first time for her).  I watched it first on CN in the
(very good) English dub, but this time around, if she's seen the disc
first, I'll watch it by myself in subs occasionally.  I find I enjoy
them both, and while I really like Richard Cox's Inuyasha better than
Kappei Yamaguchi's, I still like Satsuki Yukino's Kagome better than
Moneca Stori's.  So there's good things to be had from both versions.

As long as Steven Foster and Lowell Bartholomee are working for them,
they don't have high-quality localization.

Sorry.  The 'sub only' comment threw me and made me think of DYRL that I
believe was released as a sub only tape.  I don't remember what I paid for
the Macross Plus movie - unlike the OAV tapes, the price is not on it.
Back when it came out, Macross Plus was one of my favorite shows (actually
it still is) and I participated in quite a few discussions on it including
comparisons between the movie and the OAV series.  ISTR that the price of
the movie was reasonable possibly even less than I paid for an individual
episode.  What I remember most about the OAV series is that the first three
volumes came out on a regular schedule but we had to wait for a long time
before ME released volume 4.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The long boom is petering out, and it will get worse as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mainstreaming continues where only mainstream anime will get licensed

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; won't make it legally over here.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you're right -- but for a different reason.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think what's going to happen is that you're going to see the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Japanese basically decide that they will translate and sub the stuff
&gt;&gt;&gt; and offer it for legal download over the Net.  Nothing but the real
&gt;&gt;&gt; popular stuff would see American DVD anymore -- since the industry has
&gt;&gt;&gt; badly overestimated how many people would buy that kind of stuff,
&gt;&gt;&gt; including the download-exclusives and fansub-exclusives in their
&gt;&gt;&gt; figures.

&gt;&gt; That doesn't appear to be what's happening.  It just looks like the US
&gt;&gt; companies have overextended themselves a little bit.  Not only has that
&gt;&gt; created a supply/demand imbalance but it has driven up the license fees.
&gt;&gt; As a result of this, the market is going through a readjustment phase.

&gt; ...

&gt;&gt; The bottom line is that Funimation and ADV bit off a little more than they
&gt;&gt; could chew and now they have to adjust accordingly - at least, they don't
&gt;&gt; have quite the uphill battle facing Geneon and Bandai.  Significantly, many
&gt;&gt; of the Funimation layoffs were in the online area which would argue against
&gt;&gt; web-based delivery affecting DVD sales.  Even if, as you suggest, the
&gt;&gt; online impetus were to come from Japan, it would stand to reason that North
&gt;&gt; American companies would beef up in their online departments to assist in
&gt;&gt; the localization.  The evidence indicates that, although there have been
&gt;&gt; some small experiments, it'll be a while before we see a mature online
&gt;&gt; anime distribution business model in North America.

&gt; Uh, guys, you do know that in the recent ADV case, they also hired
&gt; 7 new staff positions when they layed off the 13 positions being
&gt; discussed.  They restructured a bit, which suggests to me at least
&gt; one of their experiments may have worked.  I'm wondering if that
&gt; would be one of their online experiments.
">

That's certainly in line with my feeling.  Geneon may be trying to resolve
a crisis but ADV is just responding to market conditions.  ADV is certainly
more profitable today than they were in the late nineties.  So, whatever
circumstances forced them to lay off employees should not be construed as
an approaching apocalypse.

&gt; It's pure profit for them. The American companies give them money and

&gt; Also, I suspect the Japanese companies wouldn't have much of a clue of
&gt; what to market in the US (or Europe or whatever) show-wise, that would
&gt; end up being worth their time and money to localize (well, barring

&gt; And then, there was Toei. *shudder*
&gt; (talk about worst, most unprofessional DVD release ever? My poor Air

Considering that the Japanese animation studios outsource a lot of their
work to South Korea in order to cut costs, it wouldn't make sense for them
to do localizations in house especially with the lower availability of
foreign language voice actors compared to the target market area.

Every so often, Japanese region 2 anime DVDs will come with English subs.
Usually, they are major properties like the FMA movie (limited edition only
- the standard edition didn't have them).  One exception that comes to mind
is Saikano - She, the Ultimate Weapon.  The region 2 Jp release was put out
by a company called TFC and had English subs.

Dubs are a different matter altogether.  It is significant that the voice
tracks for the occasional Japanese produced English language anime like
Armitage Poly-matrix, Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, Afro Samurai, and
Highlander were recorded in the US.

&gt;&gt;The evidence indicates that, although there have been some small

&gt;&gt;distribution business model in North America.

&gt; For me, here is my ideal world wrt US companies and their anime
&gt; distribution policies (esp online anime).

&gt; - The first four episodes of any given TV series are offered on an
&gt;   online service for free (free subscription is fine). Smallish and VHS
&gt;   quality (watchable, but not great). I wouldn't ever use bit torrent
&gt;   for anime again if they would ever offer some kind of reasonable
&gt;   *preview* of their properties (1.5min music videos don't count).

&gt; - Then, if you like the show, you can:
&gt;   1) buy the DVDs (or HD or Blu, whatever) off the shelf, or
&gt;   2) you can pay a % fee of the DVD (or whatever) cost to watch it
&gt;      online instead. Or whatever black-box hardware the service would
&gt;      provide you when you subscribe to it -- select an episode and the
&gt;      hardware spits out a freshly burned DVD or whatever

&gt; I personally like the hard copies. I want the nicely packaged DVD case
&gt; in my hand to look at with the pretty box art. I could do without the
&gt; plushies and t-shirts and the like though. I'm on the fence about
&gt; soundtracks. Really, I just want an artbox to put all of the series DVDs
&gt; in with no extra physical bonus items to increase the price/cost of the
&gt; Artbox (on-disc extras are fine).

&gt; I would also prefer that series be released in slim cases, ESPECIALLY
&gt; for ones unendingly long like Detective Conan, Kodocha (100+ eps), One
&gt; Piece, Inu Yasha, etc. 30 normal sized DVDs can take up quite a bit of
&gt; space. Card Captor Sakura I think is my largest single-series DVD
&gt; collection, at 17 TV series plus the two DVD Movies, so 19 total.

&gt; I have lately been gravitating more toward boxsets because of space
&gt; concerns, rather than cost savings. I actually don't mind that ADV
&gt; strips the extras -- if you pay more you should get something extra
&gt; (sorry Dave!).
">

I'm with you on that.  I don't even watch the extras on a lot of DVDs that
may be packed with them.  The prices on the thin-packs are so attractive
that I'm hardly in the position to complain about the removal of the
extras.

Well, that was partly due to the Japanese losing the audio tracks
within days of finishing part 4, thus Manga had to re-create all the
music and sound effects for the dub. This delayed it, and thus also
delayed the sub.
