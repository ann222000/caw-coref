Since I got half a day off to vote today, I took the rest of the day as vacation
time and my wife and I headed up to Williamstown, WV, for one last tour of the
Fenton Art Glass factory before it closes later this year, barring a financial
miracle.

The route up: KY 11 north, KY 715 north, KY 15 south, Mountain Parkway east, US
460 east, US 23 north, I-64 east, WV 193 north, WV 2 north, I-77 north, WV 14
south.

The route back: WV 14 south, US 50 east, I-77 south, I-64 west, KY 7 south, US
460 west, KY 205 south, Mountain Parkway west, KY 15 north, KY 715 south, KY 11
south.

Normally I take the KY 7 route when I'm heading east, but since my wife is prone
to carsickness, I opted for the better route over the shorter and faster route.
Not a whole lot new to report on the trip up, especially along WV 2. I wish
WVDOT would install some mileage signs between Huntington and Pt. Pleasant,
though. I don't know that I have ever officially seen a designation of how far
it is between those towns.

Some work's been done on I-77, including bridge rebuilding, resurfacing, and
three-laning of a short portion around Parkersburg.

After the visit to Fenton, I drove back to Parkersburg along WV 14, which of
course is the old routing of US 21. The streets in Parkersburg are a bit
confusingly laid out, but kudos to WVDOT for excellent signage for US 50, WV 14
and WV 68, especially since it's changed the past few years as stages of the new
US 50 have opened.

Who owns Memorial Bridge? It's the first bridge I can ever remember seeing with
a sign out in front like a retail store, and advertising too -- &quot;Fastest Route
to US 50 west to Ohio&quot; or something similar.

I-77 could use some truck climbing lanes on some of the steeper grades. When a
truck doing 65 gets in the left lane to pass a truck going 55 and passenger
traffic is trying to stay at 70 or faster, things clog up.

Did I ever mention how I hate rush hour traffic in Charleston when I'm trying to
head west on I-64? Yes, probably several times and it was just as bad today but
with no thunderstorm to knot it up as the last time I was through there. Traffic
was heavy all the way to Hurricane, thinned out a bit after than, but picked
back up at Milton and was heavy all the way to Grayson.

Looks like they may be getting ready to shift two lane traffic to the eastbound
lanes of I-64 near the construction zone in Kentucky at Exit 185?

Why did I pass by there tonight? Well, force of habit is for me to use KY 7 to
connect with I-64 and it takes a conscious decision on my part to use US 23
instead. I was cruising along in the left lane when I got to the US 23 exit and
could not get over into the right lane because of traffic I was passing, when I
realized that my wife would probably prefer US 23 over some of the curves on the
unimproved portions of 7. She was asleep but when I got off at the Grayson exit,
she woke up.

It was a good thing she did. This is deer mating season and the cervids are a
hazard on the roadway. On KY 7 in Morgan County, on the new portion on Wrigley
Hill north of West Liberty, several crossed the road in front of us. She spotted
them first and gave me ample warning to get whoa-ed up after the first two ran
out and before the others did.

Looks like there might be lots to explore road-wise in the Parkersburg area.
When the new US 50 bridge opens, I'm definitely going to check out the state
routes in Parkersburg and vicinity.

The city of Parkersburg.  That is how the toll is maintained.  Federal
law requires that if federal aid is used on a new construction, then
all tolls must be taken off all crossings of the same body of water
when paid off, if these are owned by the same jurisdiction.  When I-77
was built, WV had to commit to taking the tolls off all of the other
Ohio River bridges, since these were DOT (state) owned.  Same with the
former Dunbar Toll Bridge over the Kanawha (old people still call it
that).  This bridge is city owned and can maintain its tolls forever.

I'm sure you remember the old privately owned toll bridge north of
Williamson over the Tug Fork, before Corridor G was built to cross the
river several times.  Had a similar sign that read, IIRC, &quot;DETOUR-
Shortest distance to Pikeville and US 23&quot;.  Ran by this weird old lady
and had this toll system of so much for the car and so much for each
passenger.

Remember this is among the oldest interstates in the state.  If it was
being built today, it would have these.

Welcome to my life.

The bottleneck, well at least the main one, is the shrinking down to
two lanes each way for the mis-designed Dunbar-South Charleston
bridge.  This bridge was built, in 1973, in 15 months.  Because they
were motivated.  The parallel twin bridge project has been under
construction since 1998, and, counting the near complete teardown of
the old (to be west bound) bridge, will be done in four more years.
Because they are not motivated, and have spent the money on other
projects in places with one-tenth the traffic volume.  This is the
busiest road in WV.

They actually started on the actual bridge this July.  You can see
some construction on the SC side.

Yes, I crossed it a time or two before it closed. I don't remember the
advertising sign, though. It's always been privately owned, though, hasn't it? I
am assuming Memorial Bridge was an early routing of US 50.

The problem with the bridge at Nolan is that it was hard to locate off of old US
52. No signs or anything out on the road. Once the four-lane was built, it was
even harder to find.

Another problem spot is the &quot;weave&quot; on the downtown river crossing, where
traffic coming onto I-64 WB from downtown has to fight to merge onto the
interstate with traffic getting ready to exit onto US 119 at the Oakwood Drive
exit on the other side of the bridge. Couple that with the 50 mph curve at the
end of the bridge, and it's always a mess when I have been through there during
afternoon rush.

If it'd been up to me, I'd have come back down WV 2 but my wife got a little
carsick on the way up that morning.

Yep, I remember seeing a crane in place.
