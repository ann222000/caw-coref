Journey Through Loss and Change

We all feel that the world is stable and secure, that
change and loss will not come into our lives. When it does,
not only do we experience deep shock and sorrow, but our
normal anchors disappear. Confusion, numbness, and
helplessness can arise.  Needless to say, it takes time to
absorb these changes. Along with a sense of abandonment and
sorrow, anger and struggle often replace the comfort and
strength an individual needs. Most have little
understanding of what they are going through, or what to
expect in the future.

Yet crisis means opportunity. This period can become a time
of growth and inspiration when handled properly. There are
many ways in which loss and change can be dealt with so
that an individual can benefit and grow as a result of it.
When the journey of  loss and change is properly understood
and handled, much later grief and difficulty can also be
forestalled.

The Dynamics of Loss And Change

When change or loss comes into our lives we see that we are
not in control. Some have depended greatly upon a person,
job or situation and have not gotten in touch with their
own inner strength. Others have not paused to consider
where their true security lay. When familiar supports are
taken from them, they often have to re-evaluate their
entire lives.

Different Ways Of Reacting To Change and Loss

Each person reacts differently. These differences must be
respected. Some feel alone and abandoned. Others feel
cheated by life, angry and threatened. Some reach out for
love and comfort, others take time to be alone or withdraw.
For some the need arises to maintain stability at all
costs. They may go into denial and pretend that nothing
much has gone on. (These individuals are just doing their
best to maintain the semblance of normalcy). They do not f
eel ready to react as yet.

The way we respond at a crucial point in life is the result
of how we have lived our entire lives. Of course, sooner or
later, reactions do arise. Reality will set in. When an
individual feels more able to deal with their feelings,
the repressed feelings arise to the forefront. It is
important not to judge yourself or others for their way of
reacting. When the individual is accepted for who they are
at the moment, it is easier for them to let go, and move on.

Relating With Loss Directly

As time passes, it is important to allow oneself to
experience what happened directly. In order to do so there
is a fundamental assumption that must be questioned. It is
the idea that pain is terrible and must be avoided at all
costs. Instead, it is necessary to realize that pain is
natural and change is an inevitable part of life. Once we
stop fearing and fighting our feelings, once we learn to
listen to them closely, we find that the pain itself has a
meaning, it's there to be listened to.

As we become willing to experience our feelings as they
arise, not only do we grow stronger, but the pain is then
able to dissolve. We are then involved in the process of
acceptance, of making friends with all of life. In this way
we are actually healing and developing new strength.

Exercise: Do Not Resist Feelings

Feelings that are repressed indefinitely, come out later in
different ways, including various physical symptoms,
phobias and unwanted behaviors. If we do not address our
feelings in one mode, they will appear in another -
physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. It takes
courage and strength to face our situation directly, and
come to terms.

Do not try to control or resist feelings. They do not mean
that something is wrong with you. When they arise be gentle
with yourself, kind and patient. When these feelings are
not resisted, they pass more easily. Not only will you find
new comfort, but you will then become able to move forward,
start again and relate with all of life.
