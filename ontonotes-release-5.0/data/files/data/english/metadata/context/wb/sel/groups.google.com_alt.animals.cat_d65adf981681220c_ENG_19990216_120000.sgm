Ok, just let me say for the record that Miss Kitty started out as the
tinniest kitten I think I've ever had. She was the only kitten I've ever
bought from a nasty pet store (she was an impulse buy, I couldn't resist
her. I went to a pet store on my lunch break one day and saw her in a cage.
She had conjuncivitis so bad she could hardly open her eyes and her two
brothers who were twice her size were beating her up. I had to take her home
with me!), and she's turned into the greatest cat! She's huge now. Friends
and family affectionately refer to her as &quot;The Barrel&quot;. She's also *my*
baby. She won't love on or cuddle with anyone but me, to the point of being
a bit smug and aloof towards other people.

So, back to the topic of my post. Miss Kitty is one of those cats that HAS
to be in the same room as me. She's sitting right next to me (I'm surprised
she's not on me) as I type this. A few months after I had her she started
exhibiting a behavior I've never seen in all my years of cat ownership. She
guards me! It started when we lived in our old apartment. She's be asleep on
my lap, and the neighbors would walk up the stairs by us. Miss Kitty would
hear them, run to the door and start growling! Then she'd run back and sit
on my lap and keep growling real low. Then it got to the point that if
someone she didn't know came into our apartment she would sit between me and
the stranger and growl at them! And she only did this with me, not my
husband! If I wasn't home, she wouldn't do it. She's a very sweet cat, she's
great with my 1 1/2 year old son, and she's very tolerant of people she
knows. But she still growls when people come to the door, or a loud truck
goes by even though we have a house now. She's also decided that it's her
personal mission in life to guard me from the dreaded slobbery invader (our
new Lab pup that we got last month) when we go to bed at night. Miss Kitty
usually sleeps half on me, or right next to me head. Lately though, she's
taken up a guard position at the end of the bed. If Freja (the dog) dares to
come into the room Miss Kitty launches herself off the bed and runs Freja
out. The rest of the time Miss Kitty just ignores Freja.

Does anyone else have a cat that does this? I think it's kind of funny, but
very endearing. Miss Kitty would never hurt anyone, but she's very
protective of me. I think she appreciates the fact that I rescued her.
Although, she'd never come right out and admit it! :) She's a VERY proud
cat.

Pooh Bear does this too! What scares me
is when hubby is out of town, the house
will settle or creak, and Pooh jumps up
and starts growling! (The other two
cats run under the bed when she does
this!) Oh, and my Basset Hound, he just
keeps on snoring.... !

I have a similar story about guard cats. I thought this was strange when
it happened to me, but now I see it does exist in some cats.

I got my cat Euphrates (Euphy) about 7 years ago and she was the most
unintelligent (not dumb- just unaware) kitten. But as she grew up and
watched other cats she became more aware and just out and out quick and
sharp. I have 2 other cats (Cleopatra, China) but Euphy has always
remained &quot;MY CAT&quot; (she thinks so too).

Well anyhow,a few years ago I was taking care of my mother's Siamese
(originally was mine, raised him from a kitten, but when I went away for
summer employment he went to my Mother and over 2 summers became HER
CAT). He was suffering from dementia and he was becoming very
unpredictable and violent. We were getting some help from out vet who
was hoping he could be settled down with medication.

One day he turned on me--really, really bad. He lunged at my face
(never, ever did that before), he clawed my arm and bite my hand. I
screamed and Euphy came flying out of nowhere and put herself between me
and Mishka. She was in full form (she's a long, long haired bi-colour
(black and white)) growling, hissing and spatting. She fought him back
and made him retreat. (I felt so bad for Mishka, he was really not well
mentally). She stayed by me and followed me to the bathroom and made
sure I was okay while I cleaned up and then she went back to her
sleeping place. I had to get a tetanus shot, and later the bite got
infected pretty bad. Not a good thing.

I didn't trust him after that. I was never afraid of him before, but the
way he turned on me really shook me up. I never had experienced being
attacked by a cat before and he was strong and scary. A couple of days
later Mishka attacked me again, only this time I was a bit more
prepared, but he still scared me enough for me to scream again. Euphy
did it again. She put herself between me and him and fought him down.

A few days later we had to put Mishka to sleep. He wasn't responding to
any sort of medications and was becoming more unpredictable with
everything.

I had never had an animal come to my defense before. Especially a cat!
She still remains to be my protector and friend. SHe comes to greet me
every day after work, telling me of her day and giving me heck for not
being home all day to keep her company--.

It was really sad about Mishka because he was my Mother's dearest pet.

That was almost 2 1/2 years ago. My Mom still gets upset when she thinks
of him, but I have another installment to add to the Mishka story, but
before I do, does anybody believe in kitty reincarnation?

Wow-

What a neat, but sad story. Euphy sounds like a really neat cat! Now that
you mentioned it, Miss Kitty has responded similarly. I used to have a kitty
named Abbey. Abbey and Miss Kitty were best friends. One day I was taking a
bath and both cats were in the bathroom with me, of course. Ab was sitting
on the side of the tub and fell in! Oops! She howled and splashed and I
screamed because she of course sunk her claws into me in an attempt to find
something OUT of the water! Miss Kitty who was snoozing came to full
attention, raced over to the tub, jumped INTO the water to get on my leg and
started whacking Abbey! When she first started charging I though she was mad
at me. But after the waves settled and everyone was back out of the tub,
Miss Kitty sat right there beside me and watched me very intently. Every
time Abbey would try to come back into the bathroom Miss Kitty would growl
at her! Poor Abbey cat!

I think cats are both more intelligent and more social than a lot of people
think. I've had several cats that formed very secure attachments to me. I
think Miss Kitty was way to young to be away from her mother when I bought
her. I feel like she's always thought of me more as her two legged Mommy
than a goofy human!

And for what it's worth, I almost do believe in cat reincarnation! I'd love
to hear the continuing tails &lt;hehehe tales&gt; about your kitty!

My current cat Kya launched herself at a labrador that got too close to me
in the front yard. She knows I'm terrified of dogs, and I was going to
*her* rescue when she did the &quot;full fluff&quot; and started snarling at this
dog - who never knew what it had done wrong - once she'd chased it off the
property she started preening like no one's business.

Theara my last cat was renowned for all kinds of bizarre behaviour - but on
one occasion, while we were living with a cat breeder, a desexed male was
allowed in with one of the girls on heat - to make sure she didn't get
pregnant while relieving some of her....anxiety. Theara when she saw Tocki
mounting the girl raced over, beat the snot out of him and bailed him up
under a nearby chair - I had to go rescue him which was rather unusual as he
was a real snarler himself - the poor girl in heat had no idea what was
going on, just lying there, wailing in confusion. Theara spent the rest of
the afternoon in another room.

I am writing this from my computer at home, hence the different email
address. I am still c ... @bc.sympatico.ca

Okay. This story is about Mishka, a seal-point Siamese cat with a white
turtle neck bib (called a dickey???) and a white star on his belly.

He was originally my cat. He was the last kitten (runt of the litter really
homely looking) that his mother had --Quika (cat in Ukrainian), she passed
away and while I was at my first year of college. Mishka (Misha -- mouse,
Quika -- cat) was abandoned at 3 weeks of age and I was homesick at college
so I took him back with me. He lived in a 5 X 10 dorm room with me for the
first year of his life. He was the hit of the dorm. Everybody loved him and
he was a sweetie.

We went home that summer and it took a while for everybody to get used to
him because he was a rambunctious playful kitten. My brother didn't really
like him because too much because Mishka had taken Jason's wild salamander
and played with it until it dried up!. Boy was Jason angry. Mishka was not a
hit with him.

I went away to work at a summer camp 4 hours away. He became attached to my
Mother but when I finished work and returned home, he came back to me so to
speak. We lived at home that year and I went away to work again in the
summer only I didn't come home all summer. When I came back he totally
ignored me. He was no longer my cat. My Mother loved him and he followed her
around. I guess I left him one too many times. But that was okay. I returned
to school and was unable to have a cat, and I knew he was still in our
family.

SO as the years went on (at least 7) he was so devoted to my Mother, he
completely ignored me!

My parents moved around a lot in those years (financial troubles) and they
eventually settled in the lower mainland of British Columbia. I in the mean
time was still in school and got another cat (Euphy and then 2 years later
Cleo) so I was happy that I had a cats that loved me!

My parents had moved 6 times in 6 years and each time Mishka moved he took
longer and longer to get settled. He began spraying (never did that before)
and peeing on couches and on blankets. We tried everything to get him to
stop. He was put in the basement, he was on medication, he was not allowed
in certain areas of the house, he was tranquilized, but nothing worked. He
was never put outside because he had always been an inside cat. My Mother
would clean up after him, but the house was starting to permeate with the
horrid smell and my Father was getting really upset. And they were having
problems because my Mom loved Mishka so and Dad was really upset that the
house was getting ruined (not just furniture, but the smell was in the house
and it was not going away--- as well, my Father was raised on the farms and
he distinctly remembers the cat urine smell that was around his home growing
up--kinda a mental thing I guess)

As a last resort my Mother was going to have him to be an outside cat in a
last attempt to keep him. But I knew that he would not survive. I told her
that I would take him and maybe I could get him better. He lived with me for
about 3 months before he started to really get really sick. Then he attacked
me twice and he had to be put down so he wouldn't suffer more. It was really
sad. He was put into a new household of cats and he didn't fit in and had
nowhere to go. So he couldn't get better. I still get really upset thinking
about him because I feel so sorry that he was so lost. Things happen though.
And he is in a much better place right now. That was almost 2 years ago

The reincarnation part comes in now.

A few months ago I started fostering cats for a local non-kill adoption
agency. At one point I had my two cats and 2 foster kitties in my house. The
foster cats were living in my bathroom and the other two were ignoring me
for disturbing their habits. A friend of my landlord's came by and told me
that I was really good with cats and how she knew I loved them alot. She
asked me if I wanted one more cat to take care of. It seemed that her
daughter had returned from college with a friend who was moving to China and
could not keep her Siamese cat. Would I be interested in taking her? I am
never one to turn away animals in need, but I really wondered what I was
doing.

Before I could think I said yes! When I got her I almost, and I mean, almost
dropped in a dead faint! China (her name) was the EXACT SPITTING IMAGE of
Mishka. Not just a faint resemblance, but exactly the same facial makeup,
build, colour. The only differences were that China did not have 4 white
feet. She did have the same dickey markings on her neck, and star on her
belly! I am not fooling. She is 2 years old, she has the same voice and
meows the same way (Mishka was a little bit feminine in his voice, we all
say that he should have been a girl with his meow).

I took her home and she took a few days to settle down. She had 2 different
owners in 2 years (now three). But when she began to relax certain qualities
became apparent and these same qualities are what Mishka had.

Now these things could be just normal in certain cats, but its a little too
close for comfort for me and my other two cats don't do these things!

She was acting just like Mishka in so many ways:
1. She takes each piece of food out of her dish and eats it on the floor one
piece at a time.
2. When her litter box is too dirty (she likes a fresh litterbox I have
since learned), her tail twitches and she chases it. and bites it.
3. She has an itchy skin condition that makes her back twitch at times and
then she races around the house trying to relieve the itch. Same thing as
Mishka.
4. When she lays down on her belly she puts her back legs straight out (I
call it dislocated hip syndrome!),
5. She loves my Mother!
6. And the thing that really got me thinking that this is the reincarnation
or spirit of Mishka is during the first week she was with me: I was doing
some work in another part of my living room and I heard a low growl. I
thought it was the two cats just testing each other's territory so I ignored
it. Well, this went on for about 2 minutes. No fighting, just a low growl. I
went to the kitchen and passed over China and her face was about 1&quot; from the
floor and she was growling at something. I looked and it and could not
believe what I was seeing. It was a Salamander! She was growling at a
salamander.

I have NEVER EVER seen a salamander here where I live and I have never seen
one again. Where did it come from? How did it get inside the house? Why did
she find it? Again, why did she find it? How could two unique things happen
to two different cats at different times, different locations? I don't feel
its just chance. Things like that happen for a reason!

Now I am going to get philosophical here.

It was almost like she was acting out the major events in Mishka's life. And
I feel it was a second chance for me, and his way of saying he forgives me
for having to put him to sleep and that everything is okay.

Now some may say that its purely by chance that all this has happened. But I
believe it is a second chance for me. My Mother says its her second chance,
but I believe it is my second chance at taking care of him/her.

She is a wonderful cat and she does have her own personality. She loves to
pick things up and drop them just to see them fall. She once took the disk
out of the disk drive in my computer. She follows me around everywhere. Even
to the bathroom! She is a real sweetheart and I am so lucky that she found
me!

Thats my story! She has been coming up every so often to stand in front of
the computer screen. I guess its time to go to bed now!

I hope I didn't bore you with this story! I love my cats! Each has their own
personalities and character traits. I have so many stories about these guys.
I took Euphy camping once when I was in college and I'll have to tell you
about Cleo's habits. I enjoy reading about pet stories so I hope that others
will post their stories too!

Animals are amazing creatures!
Tanya

So thats my story of reincarnation! I do believe in it. She's proof! If I
ever get a scanner, I will scan a picture of her and a picture of him. You
would swear that they are the same cat.

Well, here is where the reincarnation comes in

That was such a neat story! I think you did the right thing in putting
Mishka to sleep if he was getting sick and attacking people. I know that
must have been so hard for you to do. China sounds like a really neat cat.
I'd love to see the pictures of the two of them if you ever get a scanner! I
love pet stories too, so everyone keep posting them!

&gt;completely ignored me!

&gt;My parents moved around a lot in those years (financial troubles) and they
&gt;eventually settled in the lower mainland of British Columbia. I in the mean
&gt;time was still in school and got another cat (Euphy and then 2 years later
&gt;Cleo) so I was happy that I had a cats that loved me!

&gt;My parents had moved 6 times in 6 years and each time Mishka moved he took
&gt;longer and longer to get settled. He began spraying (never did that before)
&gt;and peeing on couches and on blankets. We tried everything to get him to
&gt;stop. He was put in the basement, he was on medication, he was not allowed
&gt;in certain areas of the house, he was tranquilized, but nothing worked. He
&gt;was never put outside because he had always been an inside cat. My Mother
&gt;would clean up after him, but the house was starting to permeate with the
&gt;horrid smell and my Father was getting really upset. And they were having
&gt;problems because my Mom loved Mishka so and Dad was really upset that the
&gt;house was getting ruined (not just furniture, but the smell was in the
house
&gt;and it was not going away--- as well, my Father was raised on the farms and
&gt;he distinctly remembers the cat urine smell that was around his home
growing
&gt;up--kinda a mental thing I guess)

&gt;As a last resort my Mother was going to have him to be an outside cat in a
&gt;last attempt to keep him. But I knew that he would not survive. I told her
&gt;that I would take him and maybe I could get him better. He lived with me
for
&gt;about 3 months before he started to really get really sick. Then he
attacked
&gt;me twice and he had to be put down so he wouldn't suffer more. It was
really
&gt;sad. He was put into a new household of cats and he didn't fit in and had
&gt;nowhere to go. So he couldn't get better. I still get really upset thinking
&gt;about him because I feel so sorry that he was so lost. Things happen
though.
&gt;And he is in a much better place right now. That was almost 2 years ago

&gt;The reincarnation part comes in now.

&gt;A few months ago I started fostering cats for a local non-kill adoption
&gt;agency. At one point I had my two cats and 2 foster kitties in my house.
The
&gt;foster cats were living in my bathroom and the other two were ignoring me
&gt;for disturbing their habits. A friend of my landlord's came by and told me
&gt;that I was really good with cats and how she knew I loved them alot. She
&gt;asked me if I wanted one more cat to take care of. It seemed that her
&gt;daughter had returned from college with a friend who was moving to China
and
&gt;could not keep her Siamese cat. Would I be interested in taking her? I am
&gt;never one to turn away animals in need, but I really wondered what I was
&gt;doing.

&gt;Before I could think I said yes! When I got her I almost, and I mean,
almost
&gt;dropped in a dead faint! China (her name) was the EXACT SPITTING IMAGE of
&gt;Mishka. Not just a faint resemblance, but exactly the same facial makeup,
&gt;build, colour. The only differences were that China did not have 4 white
&gt;feet. She did have the same dickey markings on her neck, and star on her
&gt;belly! I am not fooling. She is 2 years old, she has the same voice and
&gt;meows the same way (Mishka was a little bit feminine in his voice, we all
&gt;say that he should have been a girl with his meow).

&gt;I took her home and she took a few days to settle down. She had 2 different
&gt;owners in 2 years (now three). But when she began to relax certain
qualities
&gt;became apparent and these same qualities are what Mishka had.

&gt;Now these things could be just normal in certain cats, but its a little
too
&gt;close for comfort for me and my other two cats don't do these things!

&gt;She was acting just like Mishka in so many ways:
&gt;1. She takes each piece of food out of her dish and eats it on the floor
one
&gt;piece at a time.
&gt;2. When her litter box is too dirty (she likes a fresh litterbox I have
&gt;since learned), her tail twitches and she chases it. and bites it.
&gt;3. She has an itchy skin condition that makes her back twitch at times and
&gt;then she races around the house trying to relieve the itch. Same thing as
&gt;Mishka.
&gt;4. When she lays down on her belly she puts her back legs straight out (I
&gt;call it dislocated hip syndrome!),
&gt;5. She loves my Mother!
&gt;6. And the thing that really got me thinking that this is the reincarnation
&gt;or spirit of Mishka is during the first week she was with me: I was doing
&gt;some work in another part of my living room and I heard a low growl. I
&gt;thought it was the two cats just testing each other's territory so I
ignored
&gt;it. Well, this went on for about 2 minutes. No fighting, just a low growl.
I
&gt;went to the kitchen and passed over China and her face was about 1&quot; from
the
&gt;floor and she was growling at something. I looked and it and could not
&gt;believe what I was seeing. It was a Salamander! She was growling at a
&gt;salamander.

&gt;I have NEVER EVER seen a salamander here where I live and I have never seen
&gt;one again. Where did it come from? How did it get inside the house? Why did
&gt;she find it? Again, why did she find it? How could two unique things happen
&gt;to two different cats at different times, different locations? I don't feel
&gt;its just chance. Things like that happen for a reason!

&gt;Now I am going to get philosophical here.

&gt;It was almost like she was acting out the major events in Mishka's life.
And
&gt;I feel it was a second chance for me, and his way of saying he forgives me
&gt;for having to put him to sleep and that everything is okay.

&gt;Now some may say that its purely by chance that all this has happened. But
I
&gt;believe it is a second chance for me. My Mother says its her second chance,
&gt;but I believe it is my second chance at taking care of him/her.

&gt;She is a wonderful cat and she does have her own personality. She loves to
&gt;pick things up and drop them just to see them fall. She once took the disk
&gt;out of the disk drive in my computer. She follows me around everywhere.
Even
&gt;to the bathroom! She is a real sweetheart and I am so lucky that she found
&gt;me!

&gt;Thats my story! She has been coming up every so often to stand in front of
&gt;the computer screen. I guess its time to go to bed now!

&gt;I hope I didn't bore you with this story! I love my cats! Each has their
own
&gt;personalities and character traits. I have so many stories about these
guys.
&gt;I took Euphy camping once when I was in college and I'll have to tell you
&gt;about Cleo's habits. I enjoy reading about pet stories so I hope that
others
&gt;will post their stories too!

&gt;Animals are amazing creatures!
&gt;Tanya

&gt;So thats my story of reincarnation! I do believe in it. She's proof! If I
&gt;ever get a scanner, I will scan a picture of her and a picture of him. You
&gt;would swear that they are the same cat.

&gt;Well, here is where the reincarnation comes in

&gt;&gt;My current cat Kya launched herself at a labrador that got too close to me
&gt;&gt;in the front yard. She knows I'm terrified of dogs, and I was going to
&gt;&gt;*her* rescue when she did the &quot;full fluff&quot; and started snarling at this
&gt;&gt;dog - who never knew what it had done wrong - once she'd chased it off the
&gt;&gt;property she started preening like no one's business.

&gt;&gt;Theara my last cat was renowned for all kinds of bizarre behaviour - but
on
&gt;&gt;one occasion, while we were living with a cat breeder, a desexed male was
&gt;&gt;allowed in with one of the girls on heat - to make sure she didn't get
&gt;&gt;pregnant while relieving some of her....anxiety. Theara when she saw
Tocki
&gt;&gt;mounting the girl raced over, beat the snot out of him and bailed him up
&gt;&gt;under a nearby chair - I had to go rescue him which was rather unusual as
&gt;he
&gt;&gt;was a real snarler himself - the poor girl in heat had no idea what was
&gt;&gt;going on, just lying there, wailing in confusion. Theara spent the rest
of
&gt;&gt;the afternoon in another room.

Hi
This is my first time here. I have a Siamese cat that really does not like
my brother. When she see him come up the drive she will jump to the top of
the cupboard by the door and leap on his head as soon as he walks in. It
has been kind of a joke but if she did it to someone else it might not be so
funny.

I realize the pain you feel at having to put Miska to sleep, but it was the
best thing you could do for him. This is an important thing to keep in mind
any time we are faced with this terrible decision, which I have had to go
thru 4 times.
