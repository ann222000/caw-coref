New basic system uses as little as nine watts power.

The Zonbu, a new kind of computer that uses a fraction of the
electricity of a standard PC, is shown in this handout photo. The
Zonbu heralds a growing interest in energy-efficient computers.

If you feel a pang of guilt whenever you see one of those public-
service commercials urging you to replace your prehistoric
incandescent light bulbs with fluorescents, your idling computer
should make you downright remorseful.

A desktop PC with its cooling fans and whirring disk drives uses
enough power to light up to three 100-watt bulbs, more if you count
the monitor.

With North American homes averaging two or more computers each, that
adds up to a lot of electricity, a lot of greenhouse gas-producing
power generation even when they're not being used.

The information-technology sector has started waking up to the fact it
gobbles energy at prodigious rates, says Jeff Omelchuk, managing
director of the Portland, Ore.-based Green Electronics Council.

&quot;Just in the last less than year or so there seems to be just an
explosion of people's recognition of the power consumption of the IT
infrastructure,&quot; says Omelchuk.

It's one reason Omelchuk is intrigued by the Zonbu, a basic computer
that sells for $99 US and uses as little as nine watts of power,
enough to run a couple of nightlights.

&quot;From an environmental perspective it's an excellent way to go,&quot; says
Omelchuk, whose organization operates EPEAT, which rates IT hardware
for its overall Earth-friendliness.

EPEAT - which stands for Electronic Product Environmental Assessment
Tool (epeat.net) and is used by an increasing number of U.S. and
Canadian government agencies as a purchasing guideline - gave the
Zonbu a gold star rating for its low power consumption and overall
design.
