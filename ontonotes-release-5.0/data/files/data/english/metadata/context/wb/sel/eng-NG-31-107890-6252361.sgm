Opinion on a tube tester

I've been shopping for a tube tester and know the difference in the various types.
I'd like to find an I-177, mainly because I had one for many years and am familiar
with it. They're going for ~$160 or so. I can do that, but I'm always up for a bargain
or the chance for one. I tripped across this one on the auction site: item #110074404275
He says it "doesn't power up". My first fear is that the power transformer is toast.
Mine had a very flaky on\off switch when I bought it though and was a simple repair.
I'm tempted to take a chance as long as I can get it at the opening bid price. How
unobtanium is the power transformer used, just in case? Is it fused in some way that
if, say, the rectifier shorted it would open the fuse? I guess I'm asking what the
chance is that the problem is something simple, as opposed to a fried power tranny.
What do you all think?

Did you let the seller know that he had the wrong model number listed?

Good for old radio work, but does not test later tubes without an
adaptor. Not necessarily a bad thing, but just keep it in mind. As you
had one, you likely knew that already.

These use the notoriously wonky 83 mercury rectifier (you knew that
too?). It could be as simple as that, or the other rectifier tube.
Could also be that the pilot lamp burnt out as there is no other
visible sign that the thing is "ON" when the switch is thrown.

The chances of its being something simple are pretty good as these
things are pretty rugged by design and by execution. It is made on the
Hickok pattern, but it would also be nice to know which of many various
sub-contractors actually made this one. If it was made by one of the
"name" makers (Hickok, Simpson, Arvin, Motorola) it would be a better
bet than if made by any of several other jobbers whose pre-war relation
to radios and electronics was the one playing in reception. That
information should be on the military name-plate on the case.

Lastly, ignore the empty barrel. Lots of echo, little substance, no
content.

You would be better off holding out for one of the TV-7 series.  The I-177
does not have a 9 pin miniature socket.  There was an adapter which could be
used, but they are a pain to use and they're hard to find anyway.

Of the TV-7 testers, the one to get is a TV-7D.  The nice feature that only
(?) the D model has are ferrite beads on all the socket leads to prevent
parasitic oscillations which give false readings (have noticed this testing
6L6's on a TV-7).

Least desirable (but still good) are the original TV-7's (harder to
calibrate than the later ones).  Some (if not all) have phenolic switches,
rather than the ceramic ones used on the later versions.

Many of the TV-7's (and the I-177 as well) have sealed meters without an
external zero adjust screw.  Try to find one with the external screw.

The I-177 meters are calibrated in actual transconductance numbers
(micro-mhos), while the TV-7's are calibrated in a 0-120 scale.  This is not
a drawback, and the TV-7 scheme is actually much easier to use.  Tables have
been published to convert from the TV-7 number to actual transconductance
numbers, if that is really needed.

All the military testers are built like the proverbial brick shit house, but
they are hard to work on if there are problems (due to their compact size).
On the other hand, the small size is an advantage when it comes to clearing
bench space to use the tester!

If he is having problems affording a 177 then a TV-7 is out of the
question for him. Don't even go near a TV-2. Here is a good tube tester
that might be in his price range.

Tom,
If you don't mind paying abit more, you'd be better off
with a TV-7. A 'D' version is best.

There is an adaptor set for the I-177 which allows it to test
later tubes. I've got one of these (forgot the p/n), so if
you do get an I-177, and want the adaptor set. let me know.

Tom:

Just a random question. Do you do any audio work, or do you do any work
that makes you want to do actual qualitative testing of tubes? This
might include ham, audio or boat anchor work where there are perhaps
not-so-subtle performance differences based on actual tube quality.

If not, you may be perfectly happy and get perfectly adequate service
from a decent emissions-type tester with "shorts" and "gas"
capabilities. These run far less than decent GM-type testers, which in
turn run much less than "Name Brand" testers such as the Mil.Spec.
versions and Hickoks. For well over 90% of the work I do, my little
Simpson tester is just fine. The only time I bring out the big Hickok
is when I am indulging in my Audio vice and matching tubes or testing
tubes that are already supposedly "matched" (and they rarely are).

BTW, if there are ham-fests or vintage radio swaps around you, you will
find a range of testers there where you can actually kick the tires.
Last Kutztown, decent testers could be had from $25 to $1500, the
latter being a Hickok Card-O-Matic with a near-complete set of cards.
And the range in between. If you are anywhere near the east coast and
can wait that long, you might postpone a purchase until Spring
Kutztown. And I bet Rick Yerke will be there as well with his usual mix
of goods and radios.

Bidders get it on their "daily status". If it boosts the bidding
(thereby creating higher fees for eBay), they will share it for sure.

If one uses e-snipe, not bidding until the last several seconds (or the
functional equivalent), then one will never see it.

&gt; Bidders get it on their &quot;daily status&quot;. If it boosts the bidding
&gt; (thereby creating higher fees for eBay), they will share it for sure.

&gt; If one uses e-snipe, not bidding until the last several seconds (or the
&gt; functional equivalent), then one will never see it.

Sounds like he has no idea what it is supposed to do when plugged in. It
does not have a pilot light and unless you push the line test it will do
nothing. Ask him to press the line test button and report back to you.

No. But when you bid/sell something with days to go, you get a 'daily
status' e-mail each day. One of the items is "number of watchers".

&gt; Tom:

&gt; Just a random question. Do you do any audio work, or do you do any work
&gt; that makes you want to do actual qualitative testing of tubes? This
&gt; might include ham, audio or boat anchor work where there are perhaps
&gt; not-so-subtle performance differences based on actual tube quality.

&gt; If not, you may be perfectly happy and get perfectly adequate service
&gt; from a decent emissions-type tester with &quot;shorts&quot; and &quot;gas&quot;
&gt; capabilities. These run far less than decent GM-type testers, which in
&gt; turn run much less than &quot;Name Brand&quot; testers such as the Mil.Spec.
&gt; versions and Hickoks. For well over 90% of the work I do, my little
&gt; Simpson tester is just fine. The only time I bring out the big Hickok
&gt; is when I am indulging in my Audio vice and matching tubes or testing
&gt; tubes that are already supposedly &quot;matched&quot; (and they rarely are).

&gt; BTW, if there are ham-fests or vintage radio swaps around you, you will
&gt; find a range of testers there where you can actually kick the tires.
&gt; Last Kutztown, decent testers could be had from $25 to $1500, the
&gt; latter being a Hickok Card-O-Matic with a near-complete set of cards.
&gt; And the range in between. If you are anywhere near the east coast and
&gt; can wait that long, you might postpone a purchase until Spring
&gt; Kutztown. And I bet Rick Yerke will be there as well with his usual mix
&gt; of goods and radios.

I do some audio work but not a lot. The reason I've always liked the I-177 it's
ruggedness, compact size, and reliability. I would very seldom use it to its full
potential, but it's there if I need it. I do prefer the I-177 for early battery tubes
like x99, WD-11 and such. Most of my interest is in pre WW-II radio so it can do just
about everything I need it to do.
I'll likely pick up a newer tester for the tubes the I-177 doesn't cover, but right
now I don't have a tube tester at all.
I'd really like to go to Kutztown and many of the other popular meets. It's mostly a
matter of finding the time to go and justifying the expense of a trip. There aren't
many meets close to me (Cleveland) but Dayton and Lansing are within a reasonable
distance. I'm already planning for Lansing this summer.

&gt; Tom,
&gt; If you don't mind paying abit more, you'd be better off

&gt; There is an adaptor set for the I-177 which allows it to test
&gt; later tubes. I've got one of these (forgot the p/n), so if
&gt; you do get an I-177, and want the adaptor set. let me know.

If I buy an I-177, I'll certainly be interested. I had the adapter set with the
I-177 that I sold a few years ago.

With tongue firmly in cheek, it sounds like those "tube extenders"
offered by the empty barrel might be just what you need to adapt the
I-177 for audio purposes ;-b But I would suggest you go to Bill Turner
as his material is always first-class and he backs it 100%.

Yes, it is a nice *little* tester, rugged and well made. With the
adaptor set for the later tubes, it is as good as and as useful as
about anything short of the monster Hickoks (539 &amp; Card-types) and
AVOs.

Absolutely. I do a good bit of business with Bill. Top notch stuff.

I had the adapter set with my old I-177. It worked very well.
I think the tester and adapter were civilian versions. Both were in wooden
(mahogany?) cases. I've seen a couple of I-177s with the wood case, but that was the
only adapter that I've ever came across. I often kick myself for selling them.
