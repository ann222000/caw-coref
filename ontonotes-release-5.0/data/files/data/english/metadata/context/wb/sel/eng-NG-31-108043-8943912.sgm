With no time to think, the characters go on the offensive.  Vrim shifts,
his body growing tougher and hairier, and he charges while yelling a
lusty roar.  A kobold falls in twain under his sweeping blade.  Debir
urges several of the kobolds to go to &quot;Sleep&quot; as they attempt to enter
the room, which they obligingly do.  Bot unlimbers his trusty morning
star and lumbers towards the intruders, while Lore quickly imbues his
crossbow with a Bane effect.  Lyrial climbs up on top of the crate and
whips out her mind blade.

More kobolds spill into the vault and engage the characters in melee.
Speartips flash and javelins fly, but the javelins miss and the spears
just glance off the armor of Bot and Lore, or fail to penetrate Vrim's
thick hide.  In the background, the party sees a kobold in a red robe
hold up something that looks like a large rock and shake it vigorously,
chanting in Draconic something that sounds like a chihuahua yapping.

Vrim tries to advance through the hole in the wall but is kept back by
the spears of the kobolds on the other side and he growls in
frustration.  Debir aims a &quot;Magic Missile&quot; at the kobold in the red
robe, causing it to wince but not fall.  Bot reaches and engages one of
the kobolds that entered through the hole, barely missing it.  Lore
fires his now-energized crossbow at the kobold in the red robe but also
misses.  Lyrial moves across the crate and jumps down to flank the
kobold fighting with Bot, managing to score a hit and felling it with
her glowing mind blade.

On their turn, the kobold renew their assault on the party.  None of
them manage to cause any damage, but two of their number are able to
wriggle in and make their way over to one of the lockers, where they
begin banging on the lock with iron bars, attempting to break it.  The
kobold in the red robe hurls the sphere at the crate, but misses and it
bounces off the top of the opening and lands in the middle of a clot of
kobolds, where it explodes with a loud bang and a cloud of smoke.
Several kobolds are converted to kobold cutlets, unfortunately.

Now that the hole is unguarded, Vrim leaps through the opening and
charges the kobold in the red robe, but is stopped by a spear-wielding
guard who stands in his path and stabs him, drawing first blood.  Vrim
replies by chopping the little fellow into the afterlife.  Debir fires a
&quot;Ray of Frost&quot; at the red-robed kobold but misses.  Bot moves over to
the lock-breaking kobolds and attacks them, felling one.  Lore reloads
and fires again, missing for a second time.  Lyrial moves into the
antechamber and also tries to take down the kobold in the red robe, but
is swarmed by more kobolds and has to fight them off.

As the battle continues, the tide turns against the scaly little fellows
and one of them calls out in Draconic for a general retreat.  Like rats,
they pour down a hole in the floor of the antechamber and disappear into
the sewers.  Vrim and Lyrial try to follow, but in the darkness they
lose track of the fleeing critters and forced to return before going too
far, lest they get lost in the dirty maze.

But there are some survivors:  the kobold in the red robe and a few of
his fellows are captured and trussed up.  Bot tends to the wounded of
the party while Debir and Lore take stock of the situation.

In the antechamber, the doorguard is struggling to free itself from a
plethora of tanglefoot bags, which have immobilized its arms.  Bot helps
it scrape the sticky goo off.  He asks what happened and the doorguard
in its halting way says that a hole just appeared in the floor and that
the kobolds crawled out and began flinging sacks of goo.  Then one of
them shook up a rock and threw it at the wall, which collapsed.

The party then examines the locker the kobolds were attacking and find
it is one of those that had an invisible &quot;Arcane Mark&quot; over it.
Intrigued, Bot suggests finishing off the kobold's job and completing
the destruction of the lock.  Despite misgivings from Lore, they do so
and find a locker full of artwork:  statues, paintings, documents, and
trays of jewelry as  well as some unidentifiable objects.  They also
notice an inventory sheet that is compared with the objects present, and
Debir notices that there is an item in the vault not present on the
inventory form:  a small statuette of a kobold trampling on the head of
a gnome.  It is shoved into a corner as if someone attempted to hide it
there, and seems to be made of an unusual material (osmium).

Bot then interrogates the captured kobolds, whimpering and lashing their
tails in frustration.  All that they are able to extract from the little
beasts is that they were trying to retrieve a statue that had been
stolen from them, and they knew it was here.  How did they know that?
Because their leader saw who stole the statue, and he claims it was
Kessen d'Kundarak, manager of the vault!

Naturally the party is shocked at this news, and thinks the kobold is
lying to them.  But, having no way to ascertain the truth, they decide
to wait until morning when the bank opens and relay this to Kessen.  He
is still more trustworthy in their eyes than the vault-breaker.  Still,
just to cover themselves, they make the decision to move all the artwork
to another, empty locker and secure it with the remains of the shattered
lock, which Lore hammers shut.

When Kessen undoes the wards and sees the damage to the vault, he is
naturally upset.  Stonemasons are summoned and repairs are undertaken
immediately, while the Watch leads the kobolds off to the Sharn gaol.
Exhausted, the party gives a summary (leaving out their hocus-pocus with
the artworks) and goes home to sleep--except the warforged.

Time:  3:00 PM

After refreshing themselves, the party returns to the vault and meets
with Kessen d'Kundarak.  They ask for more information on how and when
the thefts have been taking place.  The kobolds are dismissed as
possible thieves because they used such an obvious and damaging means to
enter the vault, which is not in character with how the thefts have been
taking place.  This seems almost to have been some sort of coincidence
or distraction, and points to an inside job.

Kessen details the normal security procedures, which are as follows:

1.  Only one customer is allowed in the vault at a time.
2.  The customer is always accompanied by a guard.
3.  The guard stays in the main vault to make sure the customer only
enters his own locker, not anyone else's.  He stays there while the
customer does their business in the locker, then escorts the customer
out and the vault is closed.

No one seems to have varied from this routine at all.

The party then spends time discussing this sequence, and Debir asks who
is the customer for the locker which the kobolds attacked.  It turns out
to be Yuzz'n Nakha, hobgoblin director of security for Morgrave
University.  Apparently he rented the locker to hold certain specimens
until a place could be found in the regular collections on campus.  He
has only visited the locker a few times since it was established.

The question is, who told the kobolds that their missing statue was in
the locker?  If the hobgoblin stole it, why would he tip them off?  If
Kessen really stole it, why would he hide it in a customer's locker?
This all sounds like a complex frame job to the PCs, and so they decide
to visit the kobolds in gaol and see if some time in the dungeons hasn't
loosened their lips a little.

Time:  5:00 PM

Bribes are paid and access secured to the dark, deep cells where the
kobolds await their sentencing.  In this level of the tower, barely
above the Cogs, scummy water sits ankle deep (or shin deep if you're a
kobold) and the heat is harsh.  Still, the party is only visiting and so
they are able to sweat and tolerate it.

Bot and Lore, who have the highest Charismas, take turns trying to
influence the reluctant kobolds, attempting to use their nascent
Diplomacy to good effect.  Eventually, they have a break-through, which
is that one of the dwarven guards told them where to find the statue.
They don't know why he decided to do it, since dwarves and kobolds are
not on particularly good terms, but he proved his words by submitting to
a &quot;Zone of Truth&quot; that the kobold clerics used on him.  He even told
them of a sewer line that ran close to the vault and how it represented
a weak point in the vault that not many knew about.

The party would like to have talked to them further, but at that point
the guards ushered them out, telling them that &quot;the kobolds were now to
be taken to court and sentenced to hard labor--whoops, I mean *if* they
are convicted,&quot; the guard winks.  Hoping they do not have to face such a
judge, the party makes their way back to the Red Hammer to discuss this.

Date:  11 Nymm, 998
Place:  The Drunken Monkey, Tavick's Landing
Time:  5:00 PM

At the Red Hammer on the previous evening, the party had decided that
they would check out the kobold's story by doing a little checking up on
the guard they mentioned as the traitor, a warrior named Harkhun
Rausmauer.  At the end of the work day, the party trails him at a
distance when he gets off work and watches him roll into a dwarven dive
bar, The Drunken Monkey.  Going in, they quickly notice that (aside from
Debir) they are almost the only non-dwarves in the bar, and that the
patrons seem to notice.  The only other exception is a half-ogre and a
halfling, a curious couple, sitting together in one corner while the
traitor plops down at another table with what appear to be his buddies
and begins drinking.

Bot and Debir approach him and try to strike up a friendly conversation.
Bot offers to clean &amp; repair Harkhun's chain shirt while Debir asks
him about typical local dwarven rumors.  He offers to buy Harkhun and
his friends several rounds of drinks, but he does not drink himself, as
he is trying to get the traitor drunk to better interrogate him.  This,
of course, takes a lot a patience since dwarves do not get drunk easily,
but the party has time.

However, their plan is interrupted by the half-ogre in the corner, who
keeps tossing out remarks about what poor fighters dwarves are, and how
they are all little bowling pins to him.  He particularly seems to
direct these remarks at the traitor Harkhun, who begins to throw
aspersions back.  It is a short time later that the two head outside to
scrap.

The party decides to watch and not interfere.  As you would expect, the
half-ogre wins the fist-fight handily and sneers at Harkhun, then
leaves.  The party wakes him up and buys him a beer to congratulate his
courage, if not his success.  Now that he's soused, he starts to stumble
home, singing old dwarven war ballads and the party follows along.  When
he reaches a small, dirty flat he invites them all in for a drink, so
they accept.

Inside, there doesn't seem to be much furniture, and what there is seems
dirty and covered with litter.  Only a liquor cabinet seems solid, and
the lock is even more so.  It takes Harkhun a minute of fumbling to get
the key in, but he does so and extracts a bottle of greenish liquid like
none they've ever seen.  Harkhun takes a big swig and offers it to them,
but they pass.  He then relocks the cabinet after returning the bottle,
tells them he's tired and going to bed but they can crash on the couch
if they like, and retires to what looks to be an even more disheveled
bedroom before the door shuts.  There is a jingling of mail being
removed, and then dwarven snoring.

Lore decides he will try to pick the lock on the liquor cabinet and does
so.  The party checks out the mysterious bottle, and find a note inside
the cabinet that seems to have fallen off it.  In Common, it says &quot;This
is the last freebie.  The next one you'll have to pay for.&quot;  Debir tries
to determine what it is, and realizes it is contraband--dreamlilly.

Next time:  The party reports in, House Kundarak is threatened with a
lawsuit by a very angry hobgoblin whose artwork turns up missing, Vrim
and Debir get their butts handed to them by midgets, and one last night
in the vault proves entertaining as matters reach a climax.
