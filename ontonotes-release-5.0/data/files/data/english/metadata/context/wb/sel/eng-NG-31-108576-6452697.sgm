Where are the leaders?

In his March 18 column, Editor Bob Ashley talks about
a problem that exists worldwide, not just in North Carolina.
The problem is that our medical technology is much more
advanced than the other technologies necessary to
support the increasing population.

The uneven application of technologies is what happens
when we allow specialists to influence public policy.
Specialists are blissfully unaware of the "big picture."
Dr. Fauci of the NIH and Dr. Gerberding of the CDC
are perfect examples.

Then, too, there are the elected officials who act on the
specialists' policy recommendations. I think we can all see
that being good at getting elected is also a specialty and
does not translate into being good at solving problems.

So, basically, we're leaderless.

They tend go where they are appreciated. They are not appreciated in
politics.

Voters don't want problems solved. They only want. They want laws to
force other people to give them  what they want. Mostly they want
other people's bacon.

Thank the diety of your choice for that. Leaders are what cause wars and
international chaos.

No, power addicts are the troublemakers.

No, it's just that you have a strong need to tell
everyone else what to do, always in ways that cannot
possibly work. How, except by "big government",
would you possibly enforce such a prohibition?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We need to follow the Golden Rule everywhere.
">

No, it's just that you have a strong need to preach
what you refuse to practice; your violations of the
golden rule occur with each posting you create, each
letter you send to an editor.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Mo, it's just that you haven't recovered from your
resentment of the medical science that kept your
father alive and delayed your access to your
inheritance, and still want to kill off all the aged
to gain your revenge on your (deceased) father for
living longer than you wanted him to live.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No, power addicts are the troublemakers.
">

Yes, that would be you, addicted to "power" no sane
person would ever grant to a brain-burned former
alcoholic, trying to run an entire world when you
can't even keep your postings to appropriate
newsgroups.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They're not leaders.
">

Yes, you are not a leader, just a blue-butted
baboon, dancing your little endlessly repeated
ritual mincing idiocies for the amusement of the
onlookers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They're sick.
">

Yes, there is no question that what you have is a
disease, a mental illness curable only by your
demise. You could help reduce the surplus population
by one by subtracting one heartbeat. Too bad about
all that booze, and how little of your brain it left
operational, none of your common sense at all, for
example, but the damage is unrecoverable, and the
sooner you face that, the sooner you'll take your
own advice and depart, your first and only lifetime
experience with practicing The Golden Rule.

Sufficit.

That's strange. Hitler was addressed as Der Fueher. He sure was the
Leader and he lead Germany to destruction.

The latest telephone poll taken by the Gov. of Calif.
yielded results on whether or not people who live in
Calif. think illegal immigration is a serious problem:

a) 31% of people answered: "Yes, it's a serious problem."
b) 69% of people answered: "Kent sucks."
