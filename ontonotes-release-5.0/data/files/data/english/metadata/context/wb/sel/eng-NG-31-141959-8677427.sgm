MESSAGE TO REPUGLYKKKANS - YOU'RE *ALWAYS* WRONG!!!

You people are the exact same people that claimed Iraq had Weapons of
Mass Destruction (&quot;WMDs&quot;), and that the now free people of Iraq would
throw flowers and chocolates.  (WMDs is one of many warmongering
phrases/words invented by warmongering RepuglyKKKans -- like &quot;Surge&quot;
and &quot;Mission Accomplished!&quot;)

AmeriKKKA and the world would collectively like to tell you people
that are always wrong about everything you say and that we don't care
what the hell you say will happen.... you have been wrong about
everything else, so why don't you just SHUT THE F*** UP?

Only an idiot gives a damn what someone that is always wrong has to
say.  AmeriKKKa and the world are done listening to you morons.  One
thing is for sure, if you really want to know what is going to happen,
ask a RepuglyKKKan, then just know the opposite is going to happen.

- They are against gays?  You know they want a man in a bathroom.

- They are put in charge of the Committee on Missing and Exploited
Children?  Expect Foley to want to exploit the children.

- They are against abortions?  You know if they win, abortion rates go
up.

- They are compassionate?  Just know they will screw you over until
you die.

- They claim they will get Osama?  Just know he will remain free.

- They say they will lower gas prices?  Expect gas prices to do
exactly what they did.

- They say they want peace and expect flowers at our feet?  Really
expect endless war and IED's (another creative RepuglyKKKan
warmongering phrase!) at your feet.

- They say they are better at spending?  Expect world record deficits
and trillions of debt.

- They claim they will save you from the rising waters?  Expect death.

- They say they hate big government?  Expect to have them listening in
on your phone calls, going through your medical records and credit
card records, and giving themselves the right to search without a
warrant.

We already mentioned WMDs and the Surge -- more RepuglyKKKan bullshit!

FEEL FREE TO ADD TO THE LIST!  IT'S ENDLESS -- LIKE REPUGLYKKKAN
LIES!!!

These are simple-minded dummycrats.

&quot;One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to
develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.
That is our bottom line.&quot;
President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998

&quot;If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is
clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction program.&quot;
President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998.

&quot;Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a
great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will
use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies
is the greatest security threat we face.&quot;
Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998.

&quot;He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten
times since 1983.&quot;
Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18,1998.

&quot;[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with
the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including,
if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to
respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its
weapons of mass destruction programs.&quot;
Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom
Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998

&quot;Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass
destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region
and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.&quot;
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998.

&quot;Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass
destruction and palaces for his cronies.&quot;
Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999.

&quot;There is no doubt that ... Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his
weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and
nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War
status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and
is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop
longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our
allies.&quot;
Letter to President Bush, Signed by Joe Lieberman (D-CT), John
McCain (Rino-AZ) and others, Dec. 5, 2001

&quot;We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a
threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the
mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass
destruction and the means of delivering them.&quot;
Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002.

&quot;We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical
weapons throughout his country.&quot;
Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.

&quot;Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible
to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as
Saddam is in power.&quot;
Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.

&quot;We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and
developing weapons of mass destruction.&quot;
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002.

&quot;The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are
confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and
biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course
to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities.
Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons...&quot;
Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002.

&quot;I will be voting to give the President of the United States the
authority to use force-- if necessary-- to disarm Saddam Hussein
because I b elieve that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.&quot;
Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002.

&quot;There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working
aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear
weapons within the next five years ... We also should remember we have
always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of
weapons of mass destruction.&quot;
Sen. Jay Rockerfeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002.

&quot;He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years,
every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and
destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity.
This he has refused to do&quot;
Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002.

&quot;In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports
show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and
biological weap ons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his
nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to
terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that
if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his
capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying
to develop nuclear weapons.&quot;
Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002.

&quot;We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that
Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing
capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass
destruction.&quot;
Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002.

&quot;[W]ithout question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal,
murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a
particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to
miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to
his contin ued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass
destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass
destruction is real ...&quot;
Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003.

What more?

LISBON (AFP) Jan 09, 2004
Former US president Bill Clinton said in October during a visit to
Portugal that he was convinced Iraq had weapons of mass destruction up
until the fall of Saddam Hussein, Portuguese Prime Minister Jose
Manuel Durao Barroso said late Thursday.

&quot;When Clinton was here recently he told me he was absolutely
convinced, given his years in the White House and the access to
privileged information which he had, that Iraq possessed weapons of
mass destruction until the end of the Saddam regime,&quot; he said in an
interview with Portuguese cable news channel SIC Noticias.

Clinton, a Democrat who left office in 2001, met with Durao Barroso on
October 21 when he travelled to Lisbon to give a speech on
globalization.

As Clintoon also said, &quot;I did not have sex with that woman&quot;.

The REST of the world DOESN'T agree with you, ChuKKKles......:

A Frenchman said:

&quot;For Sarkozy, a sometimes fawning French press compares him and his
young, attractive family to the Kennedys. He has never disguised his
admiration for America. As he said at the Daughters of the American
Revolution Hall in Washington a year ago, &quot;No one in France dares deny
the truth. The United States is the premier economic, military and
monetary power in the world. Your economy is flourishing, your
intellectual life is rich, research in the United States is organized
such that the best researchers in the world work in your universities
and quickly become American patriots.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From Iberia to the Russian border, European governments are rebuilding
">

transatlantic bridges. Remarkably, the continent's political elites
are embracing pro-Americanism at a time when people on the street are
as anti-American as they've been since Coalition forces rolled across
Iraq. By going against the public grain at obvious political risk,
Europe's leaders are demonstrating just how determined they are to
bury anti-Americanism. Thus an iconic moment last week: ensconced in
the onetime capital of un-America, speaking in effect for a new
generation of European leaders, French President Nicolas Sarkozy told
a meeting of his ambassadors in Paris, &quot;I am among those who believe
that the friendship between the United States and France is as
important today as it has been over the course of the past two
centuries.&quot;

Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are on the leading edge of
the New Atlanticism. The two of them behave as if Chancellor Gerhard
Schröder and President Jacques Chirac belonged to another era, with
Sarkozy attempting to revive an alliance that dates back to the
American War of Independence and Merkel, as the leader of the world's
largest exporter, championing what her officials call &quot;a larger common
market&quot; with the United States.

Similarly, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are exhibiting
such rampant pro-Americanism that Moscow, their old master, is growing
restive. Even Spain under Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero,
whose first big foreign-policy initiative was to pull his country's
troops out of Iraq, is warming to Washington-cooperating, for example,
on counterterrorism matters.

There is also a hunger for transatlantic economic cooperation at a
time when China and India are on the move; a growing European dread of
Al Qaeda's terrorism; a resurgence of the European center-right,
combined with the growing dominance of pragmatism over ideology, be it
American neoconservatism or old-style Continental socialism. Then
there's a yearning, particularly in the old Soviet bloc, to seek U.S.
protection as Vladimir Putin's Russia flexes its muscles, giving rise
to loose talk about a new cold war. Finally, there's an understanding,
however grudging, that major international challenges, from Darfur to
climate change, cannot be met without Washington's collaboration.&quot;

&gt; &gt; - They claim they will save you from the rising waters?  Expect death.

&gt; &gt; - They say they hate big government?  Expect to have them listening in
&gt; &gt; on your phone calls, going through your medical records and credit
&gt; &gt; card records, and giving themselves the right to search without a
&gt; &gt; warrant.

&gt; &gt; We already mentioned WMDs and the Surge -- more RepuglyKKKan bullshit!

&gt; &gt; FEEL FREE TO ADD TO THE LIST!  IT'S ENDLESS -- LIKE REPUGLYKKKAN
&gt; &gt; LIES!!!

&gt; This is Walgreens calling Mr. Nemo.  Your prescription refill is ready.

&gt; &gt; MESSAGE TO REPUGLYKKKANS - YOU'RE *ALWAYS* WRONG!!!

&gt; &gt; You people are the exact same people that claimed Iraq had Weapons of
&gt; &gt; Mass Destruction (&quot;WMDs&quot;), and that the now free people of Iraq would
&gt; &gt; throw flowers and chocolates.  (WMDs is one of many warmongering
&gt; &gt; phrases/words invented by warmongering RepuglyKKKans -- like &quot;Surge&quot;
&gt; &gt; and &quot;Mission Accomplished!&quot;)

&gt; &gt; AmeriKKKA and the world would collectively like to tell you people
&gt; &gt; that are always wrong about everything you say and that we don't care
&gt; &gt; what the hell you say will happen.... you have been wrong about
&gt; &gt; everything else, so why don't you just SHUT THE F*** UP?

&gt; &gt; Only an idiot gives a damn what someone that is always wrong has to
&gt; &gt; say.  AmeriKKKa and the world are done listening to you morons.  One
&gt; &gt; thing is for sure, if you really want to know what is going to happen,
&gt; &gt; ask a RepuglyKKKan, then just know the opposite is going to happen.

&gt; &gt; - They are against gays?  You know they want a man in a bathroom.

&gt; &gt; - They are put in charge of the Committee on Missing and Exploited
&gt; &gt; Children?  Expect Foley to want to exploit the children.

&gt; &gt; - They are against abortions?  You know if they win, abortion rates go
&gt; &gt; up.

&gt; &gt; - They are compassionate?  Just know they will screw you over until
&gt; &gt; you die.

&gt; &gt; - They claim they will get Osama?  Just know he will remain free.

&gt; &gt; - They say they will lower gas prices?  Expect gas prices to do
&gt; &gt; exactly what they did.

&gt; &gt; - They say they want peace and expect flowers at our feet?  Really
&gt; &gt; expect endless war and IED's (another creative RepuglyKKKan
&gt; &gt; warmongering phrase!) at your feet.

&gt; &gt; - They say they are better at spending?  Expect world record deficits
&gt; &gt; and trillions of debt.

&gt; &gt; - They claim they will save you from the rising waters?  Expect death.

&gt; &gt; - They say they hate big government?  Expect to have them listening in
