No, not as in &quot;I'm going to be institutionalized Tuesday.&quot;  More like
&quot;institutionalized racism&quot; (or sexism, or ageism, or whatev.)

The article below, from the New York Times, reiterates the depressing
conclusion that women are screwed no matter what they do, because if
they act like men they're perceived as strident and abrasive, but if
they don't they're perceived as weak and ineffectual.

Many people would characterize this problem as institutionalized sexism.
I think that's a mistake.  &quot;Institutionalized sexism&quot; should be
reserved for stuff like rules that require a wife to get her husband's
signature before she can get a library card.  The stuff described below
is sexism at the individual level.  If you told any of the people in the
studies that they are sexist (or racist, or whatever) they'd probably
fix you with a glittering eye and, with self-righteous indignation,
denounce you as a liar, sirrah!  So my theory is that this gets called
&quot;institutionalized sexism&quot; because it sounds less like a personal
insult.

This is the theory that is mine, and what it is too.  What's your theory?

Life’s Work
The Feminine Critique
By LISA BELKIN

DON’T get angry. But do take charge. Be nice. But not too nice. Speak
up. But don’t seem like you talk too much. Never, ever dress sexy. Make
sure to inspire your colleagues — unless you work in Norway, in which
case, focus on delegating instead.

Writing about life and work means receiving a steady stream of research
on how women in the workplace are viewed differently from men. These are
academic and professional studies, not whimsical online polls, and each
time I read one I feel deflated. What are women supposed to do with this
information? Transform overnight? And if so, into what? How are we
supposed to be assertive, but not, at the same time?

“It’s enough to make you dizzy,” said Ilene H. Lang, the president of
Catalyst, an organization that studies women in the workplace. “Women
are dizzy, men are dizzy, and we still don’t have a simple
straightforward answer as to why there just aren’t enough women in
positions of leadership.”

Catalyst’s research is often an exploration of why, 30 years after women
entered the work force in large numbers, the default mental image of a
leader is still male. Most recent is the report titled “Damned if You
Do, Doomed if You Don’t,” which surveyed 1,231 senior executives from
the United States and Europe. It found that women who act in ways that
are consistent with gender stereotypes — defined as focusing “on work
relationships” and expressing “concern for other people’s perspectives”
— are considered less competent. But if they act in ways that are seen
as more “male” — like “act assertively, focus on work task, display
ambition” — they are seen as “too tough” and “unfeminine.”

Women can’t win.

In 2006, Catalyst looked at stereotypes across cultures (surveying 935
alumni of the International Institute for Management Development in
Switzerland) and found that while the view of an ideal leader varied
from place to place — in some regions the ideal leader was a team
builder, in others the most valued skill was problem-solving. But
whatever was most valued, women were seen as lacking it.

Respondents in the United States and England, for instance, listed
“inspiring others” as a most important leadership quality, and then
rated women as less adept at this than men. In Nordic countries, women
were seen as perfectly inspirational, but it was “delegating” that was
of higher value there, and women were not seen as good delegators.

Other researchers have reached similar conclusions. Joan Williams runs
the Center for WorkLife Law, part of the University of California
Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. She wrote the book
“Unbending Gender” and she, too, has found that women are held to a
different standard at work.

They are expected to be nurturing, but seen as ineffective if they are
too feminine, she said in a speech last week at Cornell. They are
expected to be strong, but tend to be labeled as strident or abrasive
when acting as leaders. “Women have to choose between being liked but
not respected, or respected but not liked,” she said.

While some researchers, like those at Catalyst and WorkLife Law, tend to
paint the sweeping global picture — women don’t advance as much as men
because they don’t act like men — other researchers narrow their focus.

Victoria Brescoll, a researcher at Yale, made headlines this August with
her findings that while men gain stature and clout by expressing anger,
women who express it are seen as being out of control, and lose stature.
Study participants were shown videos of a job interview, after which
they were asked to rate the applicant and choose their salary. The
videos were identical but for two variables — in some the applicants
were male and others female, and the applicant expressed either anger or
sadness about having lost an account after a colleague arrived late to
an important meeting.

The participants were most impressed with the angry man, followed by the
sad woman, then the sad man, and finally, at the bottom of the list, the
angry woman. The average salary assigned to the angry man was nearly
$38,000 while the angry woman received an average of only $23,000.

When the scenario was tweaked and the applicant went on to expand upon
his or her anger — explaining that the co-worker had lied and said he
had directions to the meeting — participants were somewhat forgiving,
giving women who explained their anger more money than those who had no
excuse (but still less money than comparative men).

Also this summer, Linda C. Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie
Mellon University, looked at gender and salary in a novel way. She
recruited volunteers to play Boggle and told them beforehand that they
would receive $2 to $10 for their time. When it came time for payment,
each participant was given $3 and asked if that was enough.

Men asked for more money at eight times the rate of women. In a second
round of testing, where participants were told directly that the sum was
negotiable, 50 percent of women asked for more money, but that still did
not compare with 83 percent of men. It would follow, Professor Babcock
concluded, that women are equally poor at negotiating their salaries and
raises.

There are practical nuggets of advice in all this data. Don’t be shy
about negotiating. If you blow your stack, explain (or try). “Some of
what we are learning is directly helpful, and tells women that they are
acting in ways they might not even be aware of, and that is harming them
and they can change,” said Peter Glick, a psychology professor at
Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis.

He is the author of one such study, in which he showed respondents a
video of a woman wearing a sexy low-cut blouse with a tight skirt or a
skirt and blouse that were conservatively cut. The woman recited the
same lines in both, and the viewer was either told she was a secretary
or an executive. Being more provocatively dressed had no effect on the
perceived competence of the secretary, but it lowered the perceived
competence of the executive dramatically. (Sexy men don’t have that
disconnect, Professor Glick said. While they might lose respect for
wearing tight pants and unbuttoned shirts to the office, the attributes
considered most sexy in men — power, status, salary — are in keeping
with an executive image at work.)

But Professor Glick also concedes that much of this data — like his 2000
study showing that women were penalized more than men when not perceived
as being nice or having social skills — gives women absolutely no way to
“fight back.” “Most of what we learn shows that the problem is with the
perception, not with the woman,” he said, “and that it is not the
problem of an individual, it’s a problem of a corporation.”

Ms. Lang, at Catalyst, agreed. This accumulation of data will be of
value only when companies act on it, she said, noting that some are
already making changes. At Goldman Sachs, she said, the policy on
performance reviews now tries to eliminate bias. A red flag is expected
to go up if a woman is described as “having sharp elbows or being
brusque,” she said. “The statement should not just stand,” she said.
“Examples should be asked for, the context should be considered, would
the same actions be cause for comment if it was a man?”

In fact, Catalyst’s next large project is to advise companies on ways
they can combat stereotypical bias. And Professor Glick has some
upcoming projects, too. One looks at whether women do better in sales if
they show more cleavage. A second will look at the flip side of gender
stereotypes at work: hostility toward men.

It needs to be part of the original rant - that the NYT, even when
talking about sexism in the workplace - and especially right now when
a woman is trying to get a major party nomination for the presidency -
the NYT relegates it to the &quot;ladies room.&quot;

Fuck them. Really.   I have to go in and see if anyone commented on
this placement.

Of course, Belkin usually winds up there, and I don't always think she
takes a strong feminist stand, nevertheless....

I do think this sort of sexism is institutionalized. It permeates the
private sector workforce, government appointments, academia,
entertainment - name someplace where it doesn't show up. One could say
that all these places are made up of individuals, but I think this is
quite broad, not unexpected and  is firmly entrenched, based on some
of the research indicated in the article (and I have not investigated
that, nor seen answers broken out by gender, to see if women and men
answer similarly).

I agree completely that it is widespread, entrenched, and, as Firestone
said, &quot;so deep as to be invisible.&quot;  My reasons for objecting to the
characterization &quot;institutionalized&quot; are:

1. Instutitionalized practices are usually reified in some kind of law,
regulation, or formal practice.  The president of the U.S. has to be
over 40 and a natural-born U.S. citizen.  That's not just a
generally-held attitude; it's written down in the law.  That's genuinely
institutionalized.

2. Calling the sexism &quot;institutionalized&quot; lets people off the hook.  A
startling number of people will get outraged and offended if you suggest
that they are racist, or that they hold racist attitudes.  But they
should stuff their outrage back down their own throats, because the
studies like the ones in the article show that they DO have racist and
sexist attitudes.  Saying soothingly that the sexism or racism is
&quot;institutionalized&quot; means that people don't have to introspect and fix
their own attitudes.  In fact, when the official laws and rules and
institutions have all be fixed, as many of them have, and these
practices and attitudes persist, I'm not sure how anyone thinks they're
ever going to be resolved since we aren't holding individuals
responsible for their own prejudices.

I agree.  Another way of looking at the terminology is that
&quot;institutionalised -ism&quot; is really used to mean an -ism that is so
ingrained individuals do not realize that they possess, act up or
perpetuate it.

I don't think anyone is let off the hook, at least not to my way of
thinking, but I do see the pervasiveness and &quot;yeah, so?&quot; sort of
acceptance of deeply entrenched sexism in many places.

The parental classic &quot;and if everyone else jumped off a bridge, would
you jump off, too?&quot; doesn't really relieve anyone of responsibility
from his or her actions, but sometimes gets them to re-think the
stance and almost automatic acceptance of what might be considered
normative behavior and attitudes.

If sexism is fought individual by individual, we'll get nowhere in
attempts to modify or eliminate it. It has to be assumed to be
institutionalized and rooted out in society as a whole. We've gotten
laws passed about racism and disabilities and these laws help each
generation be more and more accepting of proper behavior. We failed
miserably getting the ERA through. Maybe we need an executive order
instead.

Do we?  I'm willing to look at other definitions of &quot;institutionalized&quot;
and to be talked out of my narrow definition.  But I don't think I do
call people &quot;institutionalized&quot; unless they're, y'know, in an
institution.  I know the syndrome you're talking about but I don't call
that person &quot;institutionalized&quot;.

I've heard it the way you describe, but I've also certainly heard it
used for people who have effectively become non-functional outside of
the institution.

Might be a UK/US usage thing;  dunno.

&gt; &gt;Many people would characterize this problem as institutionalized sexism.
&gt; &gt; I think that's a mistake.  &quot;Institutionalized sexism&quot; should be
&gt; &gt;reserved for stuff like rules that require a wife to get her husband's
&gt; &gt;signature before she can get a library card.  The stuff described below
&gt; &gt;is sexism at the individual level.  If you told any of the people in the
&gt; &gt;studies that they are sexist (or racist, or whatever) they'd probably
&gt; &gt;fix you with a glittering eye and, with self-righteous indignation,
&gt; &gt;denounce you as a liar, sirrah!  So my theory is that this gets called
&gt; &gt;&quot;institutionalized sexism&quot; because it sounds less like a personal
&gt; &gt;insult.

&gt; I agree.  Another way of looking at the terminology is that
&gt; &quot;institutionalised -ism&quot; is really used to mean an -ism that is so
&gt; ingrained individuals do not realize that they possess, act up or
&gt; perpetuate it.

Red in &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; used it in the sense you (HVS)
described above.  :-)

I consulted several online dictionaries.  Both definitions are
associated with the word, so as far I can tell you and Dover are both
right.  Wikipedia has a pretty good discussion of it, too:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutionalized

institutionalized

American Heritage Dictionary:
1.
a. To make into, treat as, or give the character of an
institution to.
b. To make part of a structured and usually well-established
system: a society that has institutionalized injustice.
2. To place (a person) in the care of an institution.

WordNet 3.0, Princeton University.
1.      officially placed in or committed to a specialized institution;
&quot;had hopes of rehabilitating the institutionalized juvenile
delinquents&quot; [ant: noninstitutionalised]
2.      given the character of an institution or incorporated into a
structured and usually well-established system; &quot;institutionalized
graft&quot;; &quot;institutionalized suicide as practiced in Japan&quot;
