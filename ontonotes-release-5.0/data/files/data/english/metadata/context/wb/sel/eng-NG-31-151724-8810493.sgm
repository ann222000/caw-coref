Maybe we need to present this as a war on evil, terrorist bridges.
That way, W and his neo-cons might understand it before they veto it.

Saturday, August 4, 2007 by CommonDreams.org Minneapolis Bridge Collapse: A Sign of Things to Come by David Masciotra
The recent bridge collapse in
Minneapolis is the latest in a series of ominous warnings of
infrastructural meltdown and inadequate maintenance that will lead to
more death and destruction in the United States.
The most memorable and tragic signal of structural demise was the
thunderous blast that provided the soundtrack for the breaking of New
Orleans’s levees, which despite pleas from city activists, officials,
and workers in the US Army Corps of Engineers never received the repair
and renovation that was so desperately needed. Many of the deaths of
New Orleans residents fall partially on the heads of state and federal
politicians who consistently wrote off protecting one of America’s most
treasured cities from a disaster that was inevitable. The reasons for
this varied from well-meaning, but misplaced priorities to flat
indifference.
The sordid and sad story of Hurricane Katrina has been thoroughly
told in great detail. But, unfortunately governmental negligence does
not end on the bayou.
One woman died, and forty five people were injured (two of them
critically) on July 18 when a 24 inch underground steam pipe exploded
in New York City. This now defunct pipe was installed in 1924, and had
not been significantly monitored or renovated since then. Even if
something is ingeniously crafted, over a period of 83 years it may very
well become outdated, rusty, and rotting. Elementary logic this simple
appears to evade many members of the US government.
This is the second recent, personal confrontation New Yorkers had
with political priorities of infrastructure, or lack there of. The
first being the Northeast Blackout of 2003 that also adversely affected
millions of residents in New Jersey, Baltimore, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Michigan and Ohio.
The cause of the biggest blackout in North American history was
quite pale in comparison to the epic consequences. Apparently, a couple
of trees brushed against a transmission wire in Ohio, which was like
wind to a candle for almost the entire Eastern Seaboard and parts of
the Midwest that saw their lights go out. Jason Makansi reflects on the
peculiarly pathetic weakness of the American electrical system in
Lights Out, and eventually asks, “How did a First World country end up
with a Third World grid?”
Although, the answer is intricately complex, one important aspect is
once again the lack of care, concern, and attention that structural
problems are given by policymakers.
The consequences of this political
indifference to infrastructure
will continue to manifest themselves in ways that range from
inconvenient swipes with potholes to horrific and surreal scenarios
like the breakdown of the sewage system in San Diego that has been
predicted for years by experts and journalists in the San Diego
Union-Tribune. Also, one could face many sleepless nights after
speculating about what may happen as a result of our antiquated rails
public transportation that lags behind most of Europe and Asia.
None of this seems to be on the minds of commentators and analysts
in the media, whose only reaction to the Minneapolis bridge collapse
seems to be, “We don’t know what the causes are. We’re just glad it’s
not terrorism.”
They are correct. The problem is not terrorism; it is decades of
governmental neglect. While that may not seem like a great story or
thrilling tag line, it makes no difference to the victims and their
families. The belief that the only catastrophes
worth preventing are
those caused by terrorists, must not only end, but dramatically reverse
course.
Since 9/11, more Americans in the United
States have died from
infrastructural failure than at the hands terrorists. The solution is
not to stop fighting terrorism, but we cannot continue to ignore dire
domestic needs. Otherwise, many more will become victimized and
potentially pay with their lives.
In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt instituted a massive public
policy program that sought relief, recovery, and reform during the
Great Depression. The Public Works Administration employed thousands of
people to build bridges, schools, and hospitals, along with many other
vital entities. The Rural Electrification agency was established to
electrify many parts of the South that were still in the dark, because
utility companies refused to serve farmsteads.
Almost a century later it is time to resurrect the vision of FDR to
repair what is broken, create what is lacking, and provide America with
a brand New Deal.
David Masciotra was awarded with the first ever “Roosevelt Rabblerouser Award” by the
Political Science/History Department of the University of St. Francis
in Joliet, Ill, where he received a Bacherlor’s Degree in Political
Science in May of 2007. He has written a series of essays on the
Midwest for PopandPolitics.com ,
is a member of the PopMatters DVD Review Staff, and is currently
working on a full length, book version of his independently published
pamphlet, “Lower Learning: Notes and Comments on the American
University” ( http://nailthemuppress.blogspot.com ). He lives in
Dyer, Ind.
