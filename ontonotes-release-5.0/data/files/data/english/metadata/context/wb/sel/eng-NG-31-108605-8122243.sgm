In the US Navy, my guess would be the Iowas:  Iowa and New Jersey carried 60
and Missouri and Wisconsin carried 49.

One wonders just how effective they actually were.  Belonging to the
school which thinks that throwing everything including the ship's cat
at incoming is wise, I don't decry the things - but having fired a
20mm Oerlikon myself at close range (800 to a 1000 yards) drifting
surface targets and not even being able to put any of the shells
within reasonable commuting distance of the target I am fairly
sceptical of their use in the AA role.  Also having watched a fair
number of films - especially of incoming kamikaze - with the skies
literally alight with tracer and the antagonist chugging through to
hit the target I've always had grave doubts about the value of eyeball
Mk 1 guided AAA.  I know every gunner in the business would like to
see me hung drawn and quartered but would you swap a couple of 20 mm
Oerlikons for a radar guided 40mm mount?  Come to think of that I've
seen herds of gunnery types trying to hit aerial targets with 40/60
pedal Bofors mounts and making complete idiots of themselves too.

The major drawback of the 20 mm is that was really only effective against a/c
that had completed an attack. Bofors L40/60 with a gyro sight, alerted and
cued by radar, would be more effective and could even be fired in barrage in
reduced visibility (AFAIK, few such mounts were radar directed, but I don't
know much about guns outside the Commonwealth).

The course training plan for the 40 mm as I knew it ran 10 training days. It
included procedure (weapons control orders, fire control orders, target
selection criteria and hostile act criteria, including a/c recognition) gun
drill (engagement of aerial targets) and maintenance. Live firing was usually
not on the schedule for a course because of the resources required; two
practice camps per year would re-unite all the trainees in Canada where the
ranges and a/c time was cheap, or at least under NDHQ control. (A practice
camp would typically run two weeks including the deployment of the guns and
generators to the range, their installation and inspection, gunnery, the
return of the guns and generators to garrison and subsequent maintenance.)
Engagement of surface targets was rarely allowed because it was too easy and
not seen to be an effective means of improving gunnery. Almost all engagements
were against a T-33 towed drogue at about 250 knots from head-on to full
crossing profiles to practice detachments in lead, fly-through and
sweep-through techniques. Emphasis was placed on calculating a lead, applying
it and correcting it as necessary. All the time the 40s were firing,
detachments not on the guns would be shooting skeet to keep up lead
calculation skills.

The guys out here used to use a parachute flare during initial
training as a target.  Nothing in the sky was safe bar the parachute
flare.  Every year during Navy Week they still do a night shoot with
40mm's for the public's delectation.  Tracer and parachute flare
making for lots of ooh's and aah's but few, if any, hits.  Aboard the
frigates the best gunnery team always seemed to be the stokers and
chefs crew who often did a lot better than the gunners.

True, but what if you don't have one? (like 1942 time frame) And the
next best thing is a water-cooled 0.5&quot; MG? I wonder too about the
effectiveness, and what proportion of aircraft were downed by calibres
above 40mm, 40mm, and 20mm or less. I am pretty sure though that for
the case of torpedo bombers, the 20mm was probably able to get some
hits, in which case there could be a chance that the other guy
wouldn't get home in one piece even if the attack could not be stopped
completely. I also wonder what would have happened if the VT fuse had
not been manufactured for use in the Pacific (South Dakota at the
Battle of Santa Cruz IIRC, downing two dozen aircraft by virtue of
this new technology...)

The argument there needs to differentiate between a manned bomb
delivery vehicle whose driver can be somewhat deterred by their
wish to stay alive, v/ a manned or unmanned delivery vehicle whose
manned operator does not have sufficient motivation in that area
to be deterred by nearby A/A fire.

So, 20MMs were useful in the Channel and Med in 40-43, while not
really against Kamikaze types.

Not likely due to overall mount weights. A pair of 20 MM mounts would
likely be substitutable by weight by one single 40MM. Note that the
USN, post war, replaced quad 40MM mounts with twin 3 inch/50 mounts.

Sure. One can imagine that 40MM shells landing nearby could throw
off the aims of either slow air or waterborne terrorist delivery
systems, though. Surely a Cole type attack boat having 40MM shells
going off close by in the water would not help the driver's work.

From Campbell's &quot;Naval Weapons of WW2&quot;, between 1 October 1944 and 31
Jan 1945 the US had the following figures:-

5&quot; VT, 20079 rounds fired, 44.5 kills (451 rounds per kill)
5&quot; time fuze, 54233 rounds for 52.5 kills (1033 rounds / kill)
3&quot;/50, 7627 fired for 10.5 kills (726 rounds/kill)
40mm, 413684 rounds for 160 kills (2586 rounds/kill)
20mm, 921953 rounds for 113 kills (8159 rounds/kill)
.50&quot;, 115588 rounds fired for 5.5 kills (21,016 rounds/kill)

So the 40mm accounted for 41% of the aircraft kills over that period,
compared to 29% for the 20mm.

I remember coming across the quote &quot;That when the 20mm started to fire
it was time to shut down the engine room ventilators&quot;. Certainly the
Germans developed a quad 20mm mount as a way of making it effective.

Looking at Janes, it's notable that the RN didn't have many 20mm..
Vanguard had 60 x 40mm and 4-3pdr (saluting),

KGVs had 60-64 x 2pdr AA, 2-14 40mm bofors, 8-14 20mm..

Mind, you can put 20mm places you can't put 40mm..

But they all need crew...

Mmmmm.  8159 rounds.  That's 136 drums of ammo.  Pity the poor sod who
had to wind that in!  I wonder about the above statistics - if
everything from the 16 inch down to the chef's water pistol is being
fired how does one know which shell killed the incoming?  Looking at
shell weight for kills I'd say the 40mm was the way to go.  At around
6 kg per 3&quot; shell,  25kg for the 5&quot; and 1 kg for the 40 mm then it
took 11.275 tons of 5 inch VT per kill, 4.356 tons of 3 inch and 2.586
tons of 40mm.

Where the 40 mm mounts of that era powered?  IIRC the 40/60 mounts of

Of course VT is not possible (maybe now) on calibres like 20mm.

I can recall the problems we had with the 76mm OTO guns if they were
suddenly needed for surface action and were loaded with VT-fuzed.  One
would have to fire a complete 80 round loader off before getting to
the next type of shell.  And VT fired at surface targets tended to
explode long before getting to the target.  Some bright spark came up
with the idea of a powerful electro-magnet which could be used just
before the shell was rammed into the breach and which destroyed the VT
fuze thus allowing the shell to reach a surface target unexploded.
Not ideal, but some sort of solution.

Ah yes that would be the RN's Oerlikon Mk IV of 1940.  I would have
thought that by 1944 the USN was using the type A41/804 Oerlikon (or
it's US equivalent) which was rated at 800 rpm and which is the model
I'm familiar with.  I have BR224/45 open at the Oerlikon right now -
the section on loading the drums.  The nostalgia!  I remember a
particular incident where one of the Oerlikon's had a stoppage with a
round stuck in the barrel and the gunner, as per instructions,
immediately unmounted the barrel and chucked it overboard - to the
horror of a bunch of army types who were visiting.  Explosive 20mm
round stuck in hot barrel is apparently a not very inviting combo!

I thought it was just a local solution one of the gunnery types here
had dreamed up in 76/77!  I can remember the initial trial we ran with
a rather Heath Robinson lash up to prove the concept.  Later a very
neat device that consisted of two semicircles that when activated
clamped together to form a ring through which the shell had to pass
and by connecting automatically activated the power was implemented.

Yes but the K was the majority (I don't remember seeing numbers,

I think non-K was still the standard attack through the end of the war.
The big shots were husbanding planes to be used for the predicted home
island landings.  Kamikaze took quite a while to gain acceptance and
ramp up, though there were some almost-exclusively k individual
operations.  Much of the non-K also went to night operation after 1944,
though not to my memory much in the way of massed attacks at night.

Of course, this could be just faulty memory of books long past.

&gt;Ah yes that would be the RN's Oerlikon Mk IV of 1940.  I would have

The 804 was a modified Hispano, though developed and manufactured in
Switzerland, according to a quick check of a couple of books (which
means someone will probably prove me wrong).

The wartime naval 20mm were all the same basic Oerlikon with minor
modifications (fluted chambers came in to get away from greased cases,
for example) as far as I can tell: it worked and the lines were set up,
so why risk changing?

&gt;Yes - I should have made it clear I wa speaking of single mounts.

Twins, quads, and proposals for sextuple &quot;blizzard buggy&quot; 20mm mounts.
Impressive volume of fire but not necessarily a viable act of warfare...
it's interesting that the RN's powered twin 20mm was often converted to
take a single 40mm Bofors. An attraction of the 20mn seems to have been
its endurance and independence, compensating somewhat for its limited
effect: putting it on a powered mount meant it had all the drawbacks of
a heavier weapon as well as its inherent limitations.

Actually it's against both.

Splitting that out, 40mm needed 2272 rounds per kill for kamikazes and
3361 for non-kamikazes, while 20mm fired 8972 rounds per kamikaze killed
and 7152 per non-kamikaze kill.

(Same caveat as previously - as well as identifying &quot;who got that one?&quot;
there's also the &quot;was that a kamikaze or just a pilot pressing his
attack close?&quot; question)

&gt; The 20mm and 40mm both had to fire flat out for about twenty gun-minutes
&gt; to get a kill, with 5&quot; VT needing half an hour, to put a different spin
&gt; on it.

&gt; &gt;I wonder about the above statistics - if
&gt; &gt;everything from the 16 inch down to the chef's water pistol is being
&gt; &gt;fired how does one know which shell killed the incoming?

&gt; Oh, come now, Griessel, how can you doubt the keen-eyed observation and
&gt; faultless judgement of the men on the spot?

&gt; (I recall a detailed analysis of air defence in the Falklands, which
&gt; produced several &quot;multi-kill&quot; events: one Skyhawk, quite definitely
&gt; splashed, was claimed by six different units: three Rapier fire units,
&gt; one frigate's Sea Cat, an LPD's 40mm gun, and a Type 21's mainmast...)

&gt; &gt;Looking at
&gt; &gt;shell weight for kills I'd say the 40mm was the way to go.  At around
&gt; &gt;6 kg per 3&quot; shell,  25kg for the 5&quot; and 1 kg for the 40 mm then it
&gt; &gt;took 11.275 tons of 5 inch VT per kill, 4.356 tons of 3 inch and 2.586
&gt; &gt;tons of 40mm.

&gt; Other factors - and a reason the 20mm lingered - are issues like &quot;what
&gt; happens when you lose power?&quot; where the 20mm retained more of its
&gt; capability, and &quot;what else can you use the gun for&quot;? which gave the 5&quot;
&gt; advantages if enemy destroyers were expected.

&gt; General opinion seems to have been to bin the 20mm, and go for 40mm with
&gt; fire control as a minimum with automatic 3&quot; guns firing VT-fuzed shells
&gt; the ideal solution.

D K Brown in &quot;Nelson to Vanguard&quot; cites 2314 Kamikaze sorties of which
1228 are described as &quot;Expended&quot; - presumably shot down or attacked,
rather than aborted for weather or target not found.

Sinkings number 35 (two escort carriers, 13 destroyers and 20 smaller
vessels) with 277 ships damaged to varying degree but surviving.

Numbers of course subject to the inevitable errors, but that's what I've
got to hand (and Brown is generally good with his data, so it's likely
to be approximately right)

Thank you very much for your response.  I certainly accept above sentence.

Knocking 300 ships out of action for the loss of 2000 planes and pilots
etc is a very good trade

Total casualties I have seen are about 3000 japanese dead and about
10-12000 Allies (half dead)

No idea - she was firing everything she had but the book I'm currently
perusing only says &quot;her anti-aircraft fire drove off many of the later

Aloha EugeneLGriessel, et al,
The above e-mail is now outdated and I must update the file
somehow...to: Pearl Harbor History AT Hotmail DOT com

The 40 year quest continues to locate, ID, and hopefully recover the
BNR US and Japanese airmen of 7 Dec 1941. &quot;MIA&quot; is a US Government pay
rating for the next of kin...as long as that US deceased person is
tagged &quot;MIA&quot; the family gets a check. Once the deceased is declared
BNR (Body not recoverable), the check ceases. The &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;
deceased airmen are thus BNR.

This BNR quest has meant that every crash had to be located, the unit
identified and hopefully the crew identified. US aircraft that crashed
were identified as &quot;Japanese&quot; in most reports. Sorting duplicate
claims is a nightmare. Over 70 planes shot down in the harbor alone
reeks of duplicity. To begin to give credit to one particular gun crew
or one machine gun also reeks of duplicity.

Yes, sorting what planes were shot down may help. We must learn how
many were in the air. How many US aircraft were kin the air during the
attack? &quot;During&quot; means between 0755 to 0945 ...IF we take the 'times
of the attack' by which the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association uses to
limit membership.

That is over 70 US aircraft...many shot up by US ship fire. Do you add
this into the talley for the US ships?

Let us make a check of the US aircraft airborne during the attack:

We had some fighters in the air...a rare few:
Taylor got two VALs on his first flight; then two more VALs on his
second but got credit for only two. Read &quot;Ghosts of Pearl Harbor&quot;,
FLIGHT JOURNAL, June 2007 for the details.

Welch claimed two VALs on his first flight, but Taylor actually got
one of those two, and two planes (one was a VAL) on his second mission
and got credit for four.

John Dains got in the air next and about ten years ago we learned he
shot down a VAL. He was killed on his third flight by Schofield
Barracks fire (ala the scene in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY) as he was
trying to land at nearby Wheeler Field.

Harry Brown and Bob Rogers attacked a VAL, both put in claims but the
plane went down.

Brown joined up with Mike Moore to attack two planes, years later we
find they were Zeros. Both Zeros never returned to their carriers.
Read &quot;Pearl Harbor's Lost P-36&quot; FLIGHT JOURNAL, Oct 1993 for the P-36
combats over Oahu.

George Whiteman got his wheels off the ground just as Zeros hit the
airfield. He crashed at the end of the runway. Whiteman AFB, MO is in
his memory.

Sam Bishop was able to get in the air immediately after Whiteman, with
the attacking Zeros diverted by Whiteman. However, he did not make it
far as the Zeros caught up with him. Wounded he crashed off shore and
waded ashore.

Four P-36s [Lew Sanders, John Thacker, Gordon Sterling, Phil
Rasmussen] got in the air from Wheeler and were vectored to Kaneohe,
where they bounced SIX Zeros! Two MORE Zeros joined the fray! Gordon
Sterling was lost and is STILL MIA.

John Webster attacked a pair of fighters with his P-40, but was
wounded for the effort.

Fred Shifflet made a circle of Pearl Harbor to seek out enemy
aircraft, flew over Hickam Field and was filled with AA fire. He
deadsticked the P-40 back to Wheeler Field to land on flat tires.

William Haney got hit by Pearl Harbor fire on BOTH of his sorties and
had to return to Wheeler each time with a dead engine.

Woodrow Willmot, Aaron Tyer, Francis Gabreski, and Henry Lawrence
avoided Pearl Harbor fire, but never saw the enemy. Gabreski ended
WWII as the highest European Theater of Operations ace.

A sortie of 25 fighter pilots got airborne at 0930 just after Wheeler
was strafed. Names are sought.

Well, I outlined above the fighters. Add to that 18 SBDs from USS
Enterprise that flew into war (six were lost, of which ground fire got
one) and a dozen B-17s came in from California...(two were lost).

Then comes the movie TORA-TORA-TORA ...remember the lady instructor
that joined up with a Japanese formation? ...she was depicting SEVERAL
storys combined into one character. There were actually EIGHT light
single engined civilian planes in the air, ALL but one came under
attack...THREE were shot down [of the three, two are still missing].

Also coming from California to arrive during the attack was the PanAm
Clipper ship ANZAC. Fortunately, they got news of the attack as they
neared the Oahu coast and made it to Hilo, Hawaii. The Ambassador to
the US from Burma [and his sectretary] was aboard.

At 0620 three PBYs got in the air to do anti-sub searching. One found
a midget sub and helped USS Ward sink it. These were diverted to
search for the Japanese carriers.

At 0700 four PBYs got in the air to do a &quot;problem&quot; with submarine USS
Gudgeon off the island of Lanai. They were diverted to search for the
Japanese carriers...one flew into a Japanese VAL formation for an air-
to-air battle.

At 0915-0930, while USS Nevada was being hit by VALs, a PBY got into
the waters off Ford Island and got airborne down the main channel
toward the entrance with the intent to search for the Japanese
carriers.

PBY pilot Ted Marshall got so mad at the loss of his PBY that he went
to the old Luke Field side of Ford Island and got into a few aircraft
until he found a TBD that operated. He followed and attacked a
Japanese unit until the fuel guage said &quot;return&quot;.

A B-18 was on Molokai. The crew were told to &quot;return to their duty
base&quot; at Wheeler. They arrived over Oahu to be fired on by Ft Ruger
fire, then Hickam fire, and landed at Wheeler just after a Japanese
strafing attack.

Within three hundred miles of Oahu, USS Enterprise put up a four plane
combat air patrol, and an inner air patrol of two bombers...

then more planes got in the air after the attack, some to contact the
enemy, which are listed in &quot;Ghosts of Pearl Harbor&quot;, FLIGHT JOURNAL,
June 2007.

&quot;Torpedoing Pearl Harbor&quot;, MILITARY HISTORY, Dec 2001 gave the demise
of five B5Ns by crew and crash location, along with details of every
torpedo attack -in order of attack- by target and crew. As to the rest
of the Japanese planes...that complete story has yet to be published.

Hope this helps, Cheers,

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for your response.  I certainly accept above

&gt;&gt; Other thought from &quot;Blood on the Water&quot; (depressing kinda book, gives
&gt;&gt; number of pages info on every USN DD sunk in WWII) one DD took
&gt;&gt; four hits before it sank.  So, with above odds, shoot downs, misses,
&gt;&gt; etc., sure a lot of planes for one ship.

&gt; Knocking 300 ships out of action for the loss of 2000 planes and pilots
&gt; etc is a very good trade

&gt; Total casualties I have seen are about 3000 japanese dead and about
&gt; 10-12000 Allies (half dead)

Compared to sitting on islands and being blown up, burned to death and shot
it's a good trade, maybe. But it's still not an efficient use of manpower or
planes. As stretched as the Japanese were, you'd think that by '43 or so
they maybe could have reorganized pilot training and started turning out
much larger numbers of competent pilots - maybe not excellent pilots, but
competent ones. That would have been more of a threat than kamikazes.

snip lots of good stuff.

Hmm, maybe I reignited something, or maybe just spontanious combustion.

But a thought on &quot;effective&quot;.
Obviously, that varies so much with type of ship/boat and
time in the war.

Harking back to a read about the fishing/trawlers around
UK early in WWII, just after Fall of France.

The fishing fleet and the coastal cargo ships started to
come under attack by German planes.
ANY gun on them helped.  Any machine gun really improved
their odds of survival.  Obviously when there was no &quot;AA&quot;
fire the german planes could come in real low and slow and
get pretty good percentage number of hits on target.
With AA fire, they higher, faster, more evasive, and missed
more.  So for that stage, number of planes shot down
is not the important / useful figure.

Mid-war, it would not take too big (size) a 'lucky shot'
(in pilot, engine, fuel tanks etc.) to greatly decrease
the odds of that plane getting back to base, refueling,
rearming, and coming back at you again.

But late in war &quot;incoming kamikaze&quot; somewhat like
a close in crazy armed with a knife (better get serious
center of mass hits, and prefer one to brain housing group).
Want a good volume times percentage hits out a ways,
if not, better have serious heavy duty hits.

So dah!, while the &quot;20mm Oerlikon&quot; may not be very useful
against a Mig with rockets, it might be very useful against
crazy in Cessna, or crazys in small boat with RPGs &amp; AK47s.

Meanwhile, one size not mentioned in all above discussion
is the ships main battery.
I've found some bits and pieces in my reading &quot;interesting&quot;.
Tirpitz is reported to have fired it's 15&quot; (shotgun type shell?)
at some of the attacking UK high level bombers.
The Yamamoto/Mushashi 18.2&quot; and/or other IJN BB 15&quot;
is also reported to have had a 'shotgun type shell'.
Also reports of USN firing main guns at water in front
of level flying kamikazi, and reports of water spout
bringing down some planes.
Anyone care to discuss?

I am reminded of the legendary response of the lat H. L. Hunt to media
questioning that in the first year of operations his son Lamar's pro
football team, the Dallas &quot;Texans&quot;, later/now the Kansas City &quot;Chiefs&quot;, had
lost the grand sum of $1,000,000.00, a lot for the times...

H. L., a crusty old wildcatter and political extremist is claimed to have
said:  &quot;Well, the boy's only got a hundred more years to see if it works
out.&quot;

The USN (plus the Allies) could afford several seasons of losses on that
scale, while the Japanese larder and tarmac would soon be empty.  Fortune
favors the gambler with the most resources.  War is not like &quot;No Limit&quot;
Texas Hold'em, where the rules help protect the short-stacked players.

&gt; What about those guns that all the lone cooks out of the deepest

In retrospect and under careful scrutiny, pretty much hype.....
On Monday morning and in the months after, the USN needed heroes, and
without belittling the courageous effort of my &quot;Homey&quot;, Doris Miller, an
African American hero was a godsend to the PIOs.

Although the same retrospective/revisionist view holds that a goodly number
of Japanese pilots seemed to treat the exercise as a Sunday lark and
observed less than adequate caution in flying low and slow in the &quot;beaten
zone&quot;.  It was there first time against opposition too.....

I can't imagine that either the .50 Brownings or the 3&quot; AA did much,
although VT a/c flying at slow speed below mast height were well within
.50s' kill zone.  Manual fuse setting on the 5&quot;/25s made anything they hit
close to luck.

I'd like to see an actual objective analysis (with notes from both sides) on
Japanese a/c losses.

They ran out of GED equivalent educated people who could be
trained as piolots, navigators, radar technicians etc., used in
manufacturing roles or to support research. (They had a cavity
magnetron in 1938, abandoned that line of development because
they couldn't make the tuning circuits in quantity.) Pilots were
a small aspect of the problem.

There's a reason they went in for education in a big way after
the war.
