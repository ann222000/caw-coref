The code hating losers were too stupid and lazy to learn and use CW,
they're also probably going to be too stupid and lazy to solve TVI
and interference problems with their neigbhors.  There will be more
amateur to amateur and amateur to non-amateur conflicts.  Hams will look
bad and the FCC will regulate the service more because of all the retards
we let have HF privledges.   CQ Breaker, CQ Breaker.

Welcome to CB everybody.

Wow. I was thinking about getting into HAM because I heard it was a
"friendly community". I guess it isn't much different than USENET itself
from what I read here. Here's one less newbie you have to worry about.

HAM has its factions just like any hobby.  People feel free to come here and
complain, but this is something you will rarely ever hear on the air.
Usually it gets a person banned from repeaters or licenses taken by the FCC.
But its so rare that one never really hears about it unless they go looking
for info on it.

A friendly community it is, far more so than I expected when I got into HAM
in 2001.  Ignore the jerk-offs you see here in usenet and contact your local
HAM club.  You will find as I did just how friendly they really are.

Good, if you are naive enough to believe that a few hams on usenet
represent over 600,000 hams in real life, then maybe you don't have
enough sense to become one.

Tell those Hams to gather around this newsgroup and make posts. Within
seconds, Mark Morgan will respond not once, not twice, but several times and
he will, while doing, change the topic headers several times to suit his
purposes. Mark lives to pounce on posts and change the topic line.

Next? Change the topic line back to your original post and watch Mark whine
that you "hijacked" the post.

Or, as Mark is known to do, he will goad you with an absuridty such as, "I
Punce". Mark eschews proper spelling in that he is incapable of doing same.

He is lazy.
at what point if any do we those asked for comets get to know some
about some the proposed modartors of this proposed gruop?

does not matter wether they aprove or not if they want to complain
about the NG they should not mistated twhat action they have taken wrt

What is amazing that some of these coded hams act worse than any of the
newbies. Scheissman was a grand example but also the ones around the
middle part of 20 meters 14.275 and 14.313 over the years. If you want
to talk about bad hams you should look there. Not to mention some of the
attitudes you get from the allegedly higher class hams. You know, the
ones who get mad because someone is operating on their frequency when
they havent talked on it for ten minutes yet get pissed when a newbie
operates.
