In this interview from April 15th, 1994, Dick Cheney reveals the reasons why invading
Baghdad and toppling Saddam Hussein wouldn't be a great idea. He also stipulates that &quot;not
very many&quot; American soldiers' lives were worth losing to take out Saddam during the Gulf
War.

Yes, he said that in 1994.  He also said it in 1992.  And in 1996.

And, in 2002 the NYT, WSJ, CNN, NBC, etc, etc, pretended that he'd never said
any such thing.

There's plenty of evil to go around, we don't need to heap it all on Cheney.

That was the first time I had ever seen that video.

I still like the video of Cheney at a meeting of the CFR, with Rockefeller in the
audience.  He chuckles to the group as he relates that he had been a longtime member, but
forgot to mention that to his constituents when running for congressman.  Ha ha.

I remember when I was young, maybe in my young 20s, and becoming quite the conservative, I
remember viewing the voting records of Congress and always noticed Cheney from Wyoming.
At the time he seemed fairly conservative.  I had no idea he was in the CFR, nor that
someday he would be what he is.  That guy's been a key player in the sabotage of
America for decades.  Fucker!

best of them.

Nine is the square of a prime number and eleven is itself a prime number.  Their
sum is an even number, divisible by both two and ten.

I think the relationship to Saddam is obvious.

The people that deserve it are the reporters that actually pretended his fucking
nonsense about them greeting us as liberators was something besides an insane
delusion.

Voters should have known better also, but when the reporters kept pretending he
knew what he was talking about many otherwise rational voters developed
self-doubt.

Iraq attacked us on 9/11.  We had to go to war and stay there for
years.
