Abstract -

Hazardous waste management is the most challenging task before the
different technologies. Although efforts are continuously on to improve
upon the raw material usage, processes and search for alternative
eco-friendly products, the generation of hazardous wastes and their
quantitative contribution requires to be tackled. The area of
xenobiotic degradation and hazardous waste management has still
remained a challenge to biotechnology. Although there is some success
in development of organisms, processes to attack and remove these
wastes, the limitations are obvious. The mere reason for this is, that
the chemical nature of recalcitrant man-made compounds is found
foreign/unfamiliar, and hence difficult to digest by micro-organisms.

What are xenobiotic compounds ?

Industrial revolution has resulted in many materials which are man-made
and not resembling the natural ones. The term 'Xenobiotic' (stranger to
life) is derived from Greek word 'xenon' - a strange and bios - life.
For the environmental chemist, xenobiotic implies foreign to the
biosphere. 'Anthropogenic' is another term which is used for &quot;man-made&quot;
materials. These materials may be products, intermediates or wastes of
our industrial production activities. These materials can not become
part of the cycles of matter in nature. This is because micro-organisms
do not find any resemblance between these materials and their normal
food habits. However all the man-made and foreign materials need not be
non-degradable. Those compounds which are not degraded in nature
following their release into environment even when the conditions
appear to be adequate for microbial growth, are termed as
'recalcitrant'. There may be several reasons for, why biodegradation
does not occur in a given set of conditions. Recalcitrant compounds
persist in all natural environments regardless of whether they are
inherently biodegradable or not.

Major sources of xenobiotic compounds are agrochemical and
petrochemical industries. Xenobiotic compounds, toxic chemicals,
hazardous wastes also come from chemical industry, mining, metal
processing, canning , tanning industry. The list of categories of such
compounds itself is very big. To name few of them, it includes :
solvents, wood preservative chemicals, coaltar wastes, plasticizers,
refrigerants, biocides, pesticides, insecticides, halocarbon
propellants, polychlorinated and polybrominated biphenyls, synthetic
fibres, detergents, polyethylene, polystyrene, PVC, oils, surfactants
etc. These toxic chemicals form significant percentage of recalcitrant
compounds. It is estimated that 150 x 106 tonnes of recalcitrant
organic chemicals are produced per annum which find their way into
soil, water and underground waters as constituents of industrial
wastes. Aromatic compounds and pesticides are the most significant of
them. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) lists
over 60000 chemicals currently marketed in USA, and more are added
every year. There are thousands of landfills and dumpsites and
hazardous wastes sites which are posing a problem today of clean-up or
remediation.

Recalcitrance of compounds can be due to :

Unusual substitutions such as with chlorine, bromine etc.;
Unusual bonds or bond sequences such as tertiary and quaternary carbon
atoms and highly condensed aromatic rings;
Excessive molecular size as in case of polyethylene and polyvinyl
plastics;
Failure to induce degradative enzymes;
Difficulty in transport into cell due to lack of permease enzymes;
Insolubility;
Adsorption on to clays;
Excessive toxicity of the parent compound or its metabolic products.
Why biological detoxification is preferred ?

Biological detoxification methods are preferred for degradation of
toxic organic substances for the following reasons :

(1) These methods have economic advantage over other methods.
(2) Diversity of degradation action is the ability of biological
treatment methods.
(3) These methods are robust and have a large capacity for degrading
toxic and hazardous materials.

Information necessary before application of biological treatment method
-

(a) Is pollutant concentration inhibitory or toxic ?
(b) Will pollutant concentration affect the biodegradation rate of
other pollutants ?
(c) Is pollutant concentration reduced to acceptable levels by the
treatment ?
(d) Whether any toxic byproducts are produced .
(e) Whether toxic substances accumulate in sludge.

What are hazardous wastes ?

Although WHO has tried to define hazardous wastes, there is no
satisfactory definition of hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are also
referred to as 'difficult wastes', 'special wastes', 'toxic wastes' and
include both persistent and non-persistent organic wastes. Hazard
implied may be toxicity caused to human, animals, plants, other biotic
systems or environment in general. Hazards caused may be short-term
effects ( toxicity, corrosivity, explosive etc.) or long-term ones
(chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity etc.) and it may be even in form of
aesthetically objectionable properties such as offensive smell.

List of options, with order of preference, for hazardous waste
management :

Eliminate hazardous waste generation at production process stage.
Do recovery of constituents of hazardous wastes.
See if landfill is suitable and economical.
Decompose the waste by physical/chemical/biological means.
Immobilise the wastes by solidification or encapsulation so that
landfill becomes acceptable.
Marine disposal.
Treatment technologies for hazardous wastes available under option (iv)
are :

(a) Physical - Soil washing, Air or steam stripping, carbon adsorption,
solidification, vitrification etc.
(b) Thermal - Incineration.
(c) Chemical - Solvent extraction, oxidation, ozonolysis, electro
kinetic removal etc.
(d) Biological - Land farming, composting, bioreactor processes,
bioenrichment, bioaugmentation landfill etc.

Microorganisms involved in biodegradation of xenobiotics -

Biodegradation will occur successfully if conditions (in terms of pH,
temperature, oxygen availability, redox potential, carbon/energy
source, nutrient availability etc.) are suitable for growth of relevant
micro-organisms. Many a times, industrial wastes may contain more
unfavourable factors simulataneously (e.g. effluent from pesticide
industry may have alkaline pH, high salt contents, very low carbon
source of easily degradable nature, high ammonical concentration etc.
together). In such circumstances it is illogical to expect that
potential micro-organisms will attack the xenobiotics. Here integrated
approach will be required to eliminate problematic conditions like pH,
high ammonia, high salts etc. (by alternate methods like
neutralisation, ion exchange or membrane techniques) and then complex
organics can be degraded by potential micro-organisms. Also, if mixing
of effluents from different point sources with respect to products or
steps of manufacturing is responsible for such conditions, then due
care can be taken to avoid mixing of different waste-streams to reduce
difficulties in biodegradation.

In very few cases pollutant attacked by micro-organisms is used for
energy or carbon source. In most of the cases it is cometabolism -
growth occurring at cost of some suitable, easily degradable,
substrate-food and attack on toxic chemical due to some general
enzymes. Biological detoxification may be carried out using pure
cultures or mixed cultures. Mixed cultures have a potential advantage
over pure cultures in the degradation of toxic compounds in hazardous
wastes. Mixed cultures are particularly useful when complete
degradation of toxic organics to CO2, Ch4, H2S, N2 etc. is required.
Pure cultures, on the contrary, face limitation of nutrients,
limitation of adaptive enzymes and produce toxic intermediates which
may accumulate. Enrichment and selection procedures are useful in
selecting mixed cultures carrying out degradation. But use of
genetically engineered organisms is also increasing which have specific
capacity to degrade such tough chemical substances. Genetically
engineered organisms have been developed especially to degrade aromatic
compounds and highly chlorinated compounds.

Biostimulation (makes use of existing micro-organisms and makes
conditions favourable for them) and bioaugmentation (externally
introduced cultures with degradation capacities used) are the two main
ways of initiating biotreatment, particularly in land treatment for
hazardous wastes. Methanogens are important in xenobiotic degradation.
Many of them can degrade chloroethanes, trichloroethylene, common
industrial solvents, benzoate. By anaerobic degradation methanogens can
produce methane.
Packaged micro-organisms (genetically engineered or otherwise useful
mixtures) are available for improving the efficiency of existing waste
treatment processes. Companies are marketing products of packaging
micro-organisms for a range of treatment including BOD removal,
degradation of toxic wastes, attack on oil spillage, improvement in
methane generation, eliminating filamentous bulking in activated sludge
process.

The 'Polybac' company in US for example specialises in engineered
micro-organisms for waste treatment of food processing, chemical
manufacturing, petroleum refining, paper &amp; pulp industry. Lignobac,
Oleobac, Petrobac, Hydrobac (hydrocarbon degrading), Phenobac (degrade
phenols, cresols, naphthalenes, benzene derivatives, synthetic
detergents, surfactants, gasoline, cyanide), oxybac (detoxify acidicarb
insecticides), Agrigest are the different names of the products
indicating the types of wastes handled. The Sybron Corp (US) produces
microbial cultures for industries ranging from food industry to steel
coking. They have the patented microbe to degrade Arochlor 1260 (most
polychlorinated biphenyl). The ICI though not in the pollution control
business has products (cyanide degrading fungi) to degrade cyanide.

There are difficulties in maintaining desired characteristics of
genetically engineered micro-organisms (GEMs). Genetically engineered
micro-organisms should be used for small volume of wastes. GEMs should
be preferably used for attached growth systems to avoid their release
in environment in general. Multistage treatment should be used so that
other biodegradables are removed by conventional mixed cultures and
only a second stage is used for recalcitrant wastes.

Reactor systems used in biodegradation of xenobiotics -

Aerobic as well as anaerobic systems are used to attack various toxic
chemicals. Suspended growth and fixed film are both widely used in
treatment of hazardous wastes. Immobilised systems are less sensitive
to toxicity and have a higher efficiency in degradation. Fixed film
systems are also more stable due to higher biomass concentration and
resistance to mass transfer. In fixed film systems no wash-out
micro-organisms occurs even if growth rate is greatly reduced. Biofilms
are suitable for slowly degradable compounds since a large biomass
absorbs the compounds and then slowly degrades or detoxifies the
substance. Land treatment is the most widely used option to treat toxic
wastes like refinery wastes, wood, paper and textile wastes. Land
treatment itself is a typical example of fixed film systems but there
are a variety of reactors used for waste-waters which also use
biofilms.
Newer bioreactor systems like upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor
(UASB), fluidised bed systems, fluidised bed with granular activated
carbon, activated sludge with powdered activated carbon added (PACT),
Rotating Biological Contactors (RBC) etc. are widely used.

Examples of reported biodegradation -

Various organic reagents used in mineral processing and other
impurities from the ore make the process water unsuitable for reuse.
These organic compounds tend to interfere with the flotation circuit.
If the organic compounds could be microbially degraded, a significant
portion of the process water could be recycled. The use of an RBC to
biologically treat mine process waters is currently being investigated.
The following organisms that could be used in an RBC based system have
been isolated from a sample of mine process water: Pseudomonas cepacia,
Klebsiellaoxytoca, Enterobacter agglomerans , Acinetobacter lwoffii,
Proteusmirabilis andProvidencia stuartii.

Triethylene glycol is used as a cooling coil anti-freeze and as a
heat-exchange agent in the industrial operation. However, it enters the
waste stream due to washing, cleaning, or leakages of coils and waste
stream may contain up to 200 ppm of triethylene glycol which is ponded
at waste treatment facility. As triethylene glycol results in a very
high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in the waste lagoon and is fairly
toxic, the company is not allowed to discharge their waste into the
environment. CANMET's process for the biodegradation of ethylene glycol
(airport deicing agent) is used by the client companies.

Similarly, CANMET (Canada) has helped another company with the best
method for environmentally safe disposal of 8500 cubic meters of coal
tar which had been produced during the company's earlier coking
operations. CANMET conducted a feasibility study on the biodegradation
of the coal tar. CANMET has been supporting very successful contract
work by Nova-Husky Research Corporation on the biodegradation of oil
refinery sludges. By utilizing their experimental protocol CANMET has
obtained very promising results on the biodegradation of the coal tar.

During the production of aluminum by the Bayer process, organic
components of the ore are degraded to toxic components such as oxalate.
CANMET, in cooperation with ALCAN, has developed an RBC based process
for the degradation of the oxalate to CO2 and H2O. Ninety-nine per cent
of the pollutant is degraded within the RBC with an influent
concentration of 12 g/L and a 5 hour retention time. This process is
currently being tested on an industrial scale.

Microbial degradation of ethylene glycol has been reported. During the
winter, airport runoff contains urea, ethylene glycol and/or propylene
glycol from de-icing operations. The high biological oxygen demand
(BOD) of the airport runoff causes problems in the municipal waste
water treatment facilities. Thus it is desirable that most of the
glycol be degraded before the runoff can be released to surface waters.

Ethylene glycol degrading bacteria were first isolated from two areas
near airports. An RBC reactor was then inoculated with a mixed culture
of these isolates. Colonization of the RBC discs by the bacteria was
very slow for the first two weeks, but some growth was observed in the
third week. The degradation rate of ethylene glycol in the RBC was
fairly low but as the biomass continued to accumulate the degradation
rate increased.

Polychlorinated benzene (PCB), Benzopyrene, Polystyrenechlorinated
hydrocarbons, sulfonated aromatics like sulfonated naphthalenes
(emulsifiers, wetting agents), nitrotoluenes are reported to be
undergoing biodegradation.

A strain of bacteria has been engineered by researchers at the
University of Minnesota to express two enzymes that enable it to
decompose highly halogenated compounds. Bacteria are known to
metabolise many organic compounds, but attempts to culture bacteria
that metabolise polyhalogenated pollutants have been largely
unsuccessful. Polyhalogenated compounds can be broken down by bacteria
but only in a two step process -anaerobic bacteria must first
metabolise them by reductive dehalogenation, and then aerobic bacteria
must degrade the compounds by using oxygenases. However, seven genes
encoding two multi-component oxygenase enzymeshave now been engineered
into Pseudomonas putida, enabling it to metabolise polyhalogenated
compounds by sequential reductive and oxidative steps. One of the
enzymes, cytochrome p450 monoxygenase, reduces the polyhalogenated
compounds under low oxygen conditions, and the other, toluene
dioxygenase, oxidises the products to non-toxic compunds.

A bioprocess developed in Wales to remove unwanted contaminants in the
manufacture of Kynene ULX used in the paper making process has been
commercialised by Hercules in two plants, one in France and the other
in Sweden. Carbury Herne(UK) and Hercules(USA) are collaborating on the
use of biocatalysts to detoxify halo-alcohols, a byproduct in the
reaction between epichlorohydrin and aqueous solution of
polyaminoamide. The reaction produces polymers which are then used to
give extra strength to paper. Halo-alcohols produced as byproduct
however have no value and are carcinogenic.

So far two different strains of bacteria have been developed to degrade
the halo-alcohols. These work through hydrolysis reaction which
effectively restructures the molecule to form an epoxide. Of the two
principle form of halo-alcohols, 1,3 dichloropropan-2-01 (DCP) and
3-chloropropanediol(CPD). DCP is first converted to epichlorohydrin and
then into CPD. The CPD is then converted to glycidol then glycerol,
which is finally broken down into carbon dioxide, water and chloride
ions. Hercules claims the process reduces the level of DCP and CPD by a
factor of 10 and to level of 1 ppm of DCP and 5 ppm of CPD.

Recycling of rubber is possible with the help of biotech process.
Sulfur-loving microbes such as Rhodococcus, Sulfolobus and
Thiobacillus, may provide in future an economical way to recycle the
mountains of used tyres. Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory is
developing a process in which bacteria attack the sulfur that binds
together a tyre's basic rubber polymers. The bacteria leave
carbon-rubber backbone intact for reuse. From 2.5 to 3 billion used
tyres are stored in USA and 200 to 300 million are added each year.
Some are burnt causing pollution, while the recovery of hydrocarbons by
pyrolysis is uneconomical. In Battlelle's process, tyres are ground to
about 75 mm then mixed with bacteria in aqueous solution along with
nutrients for the microbes. After several days, the rubber is recovered
from the solution. Three different bacteria produce rubber of different
surface chemistry. The process has been tested at 4 l scale. and
scale-up at 20-40 l is planned.

Cyanide present in aqueous wastes can be effectively detoxified using
immobilised mycelia of Stemphylium loti in which cyanide hydrolase has
been induced. Cyanide is converted to formamide. Flocculation by
polyelectrolytes is the method used, for immobilisation of fungal
mycelium.

Chemical pesticides is major group of xenobiotic compounds which is a
challenge for biodegradation. There are some successes at application
level although there are many reports of biodegradation of pesticide
residues or effluents from pesticide industries.
Parathion hydrolase isolated from Pseudomonas spp can remove 94-98% of
residual parathion from pesticide container in 16 hours at substrate
level of 1%. Immobilised parathion hydrolase used for wastewater
containing pesticide is reported. It reduced parathion level from 10
ppm to 500 ppb in just 1 min and enzyme remained active under
continuous use for over 70 days. Hydrolases for other pesticides are
also reported. Parathion hydrolase enzyme is reported to be degrading
97% of the 1000 ppm of Diazinon in 24 hours. Parathion hydrolase
produced by Flavobacteriumspp. can rapidly hydrolyse organophosphate
insecticide 'Coumaphos' to less toxic products.

Fusarium solani can be immobilised in a column and can be used to act
on herbicide 'Propanil' (3,4 dichloro propionanilide) to form 3,4
dichloroaniline. Similarly enzymes from Trichoderma viridae can
hydrolyse the insecticide 'Malathion'. Chrysosporium lingorum, Trametus
versicolor, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Sternum hirsutum can
mineralise 3,4 dichloroaniline, dieldrin, phenethrene. Better
mineralisation occurs when minerals and vitamins are added in the
medium.

Pseudomonas putida, Candida tropicalis, Fusarium flocciferum,
Aureobasidium pullulans, can degrade herbicides of chlorobenzoate
class.

Phanerochaete chrysosporium mineralises all of the sulfonated azo dyes.
Streptomyces chromofuscus mineralises modified dyes containing lignin.
Lignocellulolytic fungi and bacteria can be used for biodegradation of
anionic azo dyes which are considered to be resistant xenobiotics.

Conclusion -

Thus, though there are many reports of biodegradation potential of
different micro-organisms, commercial successes are relatively few. The
same degradation potential can also be exploited for bioremediation
activities to bring about degradation of these xenobiotic compounds in
soil, ground-water and other environments. Still, advantages of
biodegradation (like less costly, complete degradation and not mere
conversion etc.) make them attractive for further work.
