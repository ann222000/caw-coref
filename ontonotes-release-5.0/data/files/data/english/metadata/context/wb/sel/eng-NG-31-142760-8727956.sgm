LIPA Electrifies Crowd In Hewlett At YOSS BBQ

It was a beautiful summerâ€™s night as guests gathered on the beautiful
lawn at the summer home of Melly and Rochelle Lifshitz for the benefit
of the Heller Resource Center. As the crowd enjoyed the lavish
buffet-style barbecue prepared and served by Scott Fagan of Oasis
Caterers, they looked expectantly toward the stage, awaiting the
arrival of Lipa, the Chassidic star who was set to entertain the
benefit event. The ten-piece Neshoma Orchestra band struck up the
music, but the MC, Neil Wallin, was in a true quandary as Lipa was
nowhere to be found.
Suddenly a beautiful yacht glided down the bay and there he was! Indeed
the stealthy surprise landing by boat set the stage for a wonderful
evening that was entertaining, heartzig, and lebedig!
The Yeshiva of South Shore would like to thank Melly and Rochelle
Lifshitz for hosting the Fourth Annual Tom and Judy Raskin Concert on
the Lawn endowed by dear friends Tom and Judy Raskin, who are
distinguished and ardent supporters of Jewish education. Of course the
producer, the incomparable Dov Herman, made sure that everything went
smoothly and beautifully.
Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky, rosh yeshiva of South Shore, would like to
thank all of the supporters and guests.
