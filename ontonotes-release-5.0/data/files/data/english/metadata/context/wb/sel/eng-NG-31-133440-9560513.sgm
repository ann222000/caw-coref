Non-experts Can (and Should) Create Information Products, Too
Copyright (c) 2008 Judy Murdoch

If you have been thinking about creating an information product
but hesitate because you don't consider yourself enough of an
expert, this month's ezine was written with you in mind.

======================================= True Story: the $50
Challenge =======================================

Dana was a client of mine who was working with me to fund a
non-profit she was starting: a private school for local at-risk
kids. She had years of experience working with these kids as an
elementary school teacher and was confident she could help. But
raising money to fund her new school was very intimidating. One
day we were talking about the idea of creating and selling
information products to help her fund her school. She loved the
idea of selling information products but balked at the idea of
selling ones she created. Why? Because she was *just* a school
teacher. She didn't have a Ph.D. in her field. She hadn't
written any important papers that were published in scholarly
journals. Why in the world would anyone want to hear what she had
to say, let alone PAY to hear it.

I disagreed with Dana and gave her a challenge: &quot;I bet you know
something that I would happily pay you to teach me.&quot; I picked up
my checkbook, &quot;I bet you could help me with a problem that's
worth at least $50.&quot;

Dana was intrigued by the challenge and to get started, we made a
list of her teaching accomplishments. One accomplishment that
piqued my interest was how she had taught her first grade class
to keep their classroom tidy.

I was interested because getting my own first grader to pick up
after himself was a constant struggle. I felt like I had tried
everything; nagging, bribes, and threats. Nothing worked.

&quot;Dana,&quot; I said, &quot;If you could teach me how to teach my son to
clean up after himself, that would easily be worth $50 to me.&quot;

My offer amazed Dana. She never imagined that anyone would value
something that, to her, was so ordinary.

She took me up on it and wrote a great article on training kids
to pick up after themselves. I still apply her advice now and
then when my son, now eleven, forgets to tidy up. Dana got $50
which she applied as a donation to her new school (now the Park
Hill Preparatory School in Denver, Colorado).

======================================= The Lesson Learned
=======================================

Like Dana, most of us know how to do things that are almost
second nature TO US. And that's the problem. When you're good
at something and have been doing it for a long time, there's a
tendency to devalue it. We assume that it's easy for us so
isn't it easy for everyone else?

NO! IT ISN'T EASY FOR EVERYONE ELSE.

I had been doing everything I could think of to get my son to
clean up after himself and it wasn't working. Dana had spent
years with kids and through her own training plus lots of trial
and error she had developed a simple, straightforward process for
teaching kids to take responsibility for keeping their classroom
clean.

A neater, more peaceful home was worth at least $50 to me.

======================================= 3 Steps to Developing an
Information Product (Even if You're Not a Famous Expert)
=======================================

I'm willing to bet there's a $50 information product in you.
Maybe more than one.

Try this:

Step #1

Write down at least 10 things that you know how to do. It's
easiest to look at what you've accomplished recently but that
doesn't mean you can't go back further. Your list items can be
related to your current business but it's not a requirement.
Please don't get stuck because you can't think of anything
grand you accomplished in your business this year. Jot down what
comes to mind.

Step #2

Pick one item on your list that you enjoyed doing and that
you're pretty sure you could teach someone else to do.

Step #3

For the item you picked, write a very short story about what you
did, how you did it, and what you would do differently to improve
your results.

======================================= Ta-DAH! You have an
information product =======================================

Is it rough around the edges? Yes, probably. Are you going to put
it out to the marketplace? Probably not. But that's not the
point. The point is you don't need to be an acclaimed expert to
know something others value.

======================================= Bottom Line
=======================================

The main requirement to create an information product is
experience doing something others would like to learn. If you own
a small business, I have no doubt that you have at least two or
three valuable information products based on your experience,
know-how, and knowledge. My client, Dana, didn't think anyone
would pay her $50 for what she knew about getting kids to clean
up. Little did she know!
