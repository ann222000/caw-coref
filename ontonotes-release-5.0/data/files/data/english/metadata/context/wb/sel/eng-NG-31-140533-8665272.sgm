Ok, so the next time you see me, whether its our first meeting or not,
feel free to throw sticks and rocks at me! Quail Run Park is Closed on
Thursday's and had I read my own page more completely I would have
seen it. I'm sorry! I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy!!

SO...let's just change the park venue right now. Head to Shawnee Park
tomorrow night (barring any torential downpours) at 7 pm. It is open
and a beautiful park to boot!

Dee and I got a few nice pics of this park. But if anyone has a camera
with them, feel free to take more!!

Sorry again!

Cool, my own personal stomping grounds.... even if it isn't raining,
though, be prepared for MUD!!!!  There is quite a bit of grass at
Shawnee but there are low areas that have been created by the dogs
digging.  So bring a towel!
