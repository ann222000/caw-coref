Why Are So Many Americans in Prison?

Race and the transformation of criminal justice

by Glenn C. Loury
July/August 2007

The early 1990s were the age of drive-by shootings, drug deals gone
bad, crack cocaine, and gangsta rap. Between 1960 and 1990, the
annual number of murders in New Haven rose from six to 31, the number
of rapes from four to 168, the number of robberies from 16 to
1,784Â­all this while the city's population declined by 14 percent.

Crime was concentrated in central cities: in 1990, two fifths of
Pennsylvania' s violent crimes were committed in Philadelphia, home
to one seventh of the state's population. The subject of crime
dominated American domestic-policy debates.

Most observers at the time expected things to get worse. Consulting
demographic tables and extrapolating trends, scholars and pundits
warned the public to prepare for an onslaught, and for a new kind of
criminalÂ­the anomic, vicious, irreligious, amoral juvenile
&quot;super-predator. &quot; In 1996, one academic commentator predicted a
&quot;bloodbath&quot; of juvenile homicides in 2005.

And so we prepared. Stoked by fear and political opportunism, but
also by the need to address a very real social problem, we threw lots
of people in jail, and when the old prisons were filled we built new
ones.

But the onslaught never came. Crime rates peaked in 1992 and have
dropped sharply since. Even as crime rates fell, however,
imprisonment rates remained high and continued their upward march.

The result, the current American prison system, is a leviathan
unmatched in human history.

According to a 2005 report of the International Centre for Prison
Studies in London, the United StatesÂ­with five percent of the world's
populationÂ­houses 25 percent of the world's inmates.

Our incarceration rate (714 per 100,000 residents) is almost 40
percent greater than those of our nearest competitors (the Bahamas,
Belarus, and Russia).

Other industrial democracies, even those with significant crime
problems of their own, are much less punitive: our incarceration rate
is 6.2 times that of Canada, 7.8 times that of France, and 12.3 times
that of Japan.

We have a corrections sector that employs more Americans than the
combined work forces of General Motors, Ford, and Wal-Mart, the three
largest corporate employers in the country, and we are spending some
$200 billion annually on law enforcement and corrections at all
levels of government, a fourfold increase (in constant dollars) over
the past quarter century.

Never before has a supposedly free country denied basic liberty to so
many of its citizens. In December 2006, some 2.25 million persons
were being held in the nearly 5,000 prisons and jails that are
scattered across America's urban and rural landscapes.

One third of
inmates in state prisons are violent criminals, convicted of
homicide, rape, or robbery. But the other two thirds consist mainly
of property and drug offenders.

Inmates are disproportionately drawn from the most disadvantaged
parts of society. On average, state inmates have fewer than 11 years
of schooling. They are also vastly disproportionately black and brown.

How did it come to this? One argument is that the massive increase in
incarceration reflects the success of a rational public policy: faced
with a compelling social problem, we responded by imprisoning people
and succeeded in lowering crime rates. This argument is not entirely
misguided. Increased incarceration does appear to have reduced crime
somewhat. But by how much?

Estimates of the share of the 1990s reduction in violent crime that
can be attributed to the prison boom
range from five percent to 25 percent.

Whatever the number, analysts of all political stripes now agree that
we have long ago entered the zone of diminishing returns. The
conservative scholar John DiIulio, who coined the term &quot;super-
predator&quot; in the early 1990s, was by the end of that decade declaring
in The Wall Street Journal that &quot;Two Million Prisoners Are Enough.&quot;
But there was no political movement for getting America out of the
mass-incarceration business. The throttle was stuck.

A more convincing argument is that imprisonment rates have continued
to rise while crime rates have fallen because we have become
progressively more punitive: not because crime has continued to
explode (it hasn't), not because we made a smart policy choice, but
because we have made a collective decision to increase the rate of
punishment.

One simple measure of punitiveness is the likelihood that a person
who is arrested will be subsequently incarcerated.

Between 1980 and 2001, there was no real change in the chances of
being arrested in response to a complaint: the rate was just under 50
percent. But the likelihood that an arrest would result in
imprisonment more than doubled, from 13 to 28 percent. And because
the amount of time served and the rate of prison admission both
increased, the incarceration rate for violent crime almost tripled,
despite the decline in the level of violence.

The incarceration rate for nonviolent and drug offenses increased at
an even faster pace: between 1980 and 1997 the number of people
incarcerated for nonviolent offenses tripled, and the number of
people incarcerated for drug offenses increased by a factor of 11.

Indeed, the criminal-justice researcher Alfred Blumstein has argued
that none of the growth in incarceration between 1980 and 1996 can be
attributed to more crime:  The growth was entirely attributable to a
growth in punitiveness, about equally to growth in prison commitments
per arrest (an indication of tougher prosecution or judicial
sentencing) and to longer time served (an indication of longer
sentences, elimination of parole or later parole release, or greater
readiness to recommit parolees to prison for either technical
violations or new crimes).

This growth in punitiveness was accompanied by a shift in thinking
about the basic purpose of criminal justice.

In the 1970s, the sociologist David Garland argues, the corrections
system was commonly seen as a way to prepare offenders to rejoin
society. Since then, the focus has shifted from rehabilitation to
punishment and stayed there.

Felons are no longer persons to be supported, but risks to be dealt
with. And the way to deal with the risks is to keep them locked up.

As of 2000, 33 states had abolished limited parole (up from 17 in
1980); 24 states had introduced three-strikes laws (up from zero);
and 40 states had introduced truth-in-sentencing laws (up from
three). The vast majority of these changes occurred in the 1990s, as
crime rates fell.

This new system of punitive ideas is aided by a new relationship
between the media, the politicians, and the public. A handful of
cases ­in which a predator does an awful thing to an innocent ­get
excessive media attention and engender public outrage. This attention
typically bears no relation to the frequency of the particular type
of crime, and yet laws ­such as three-strikes laws that give mandatory
life sentences to nonviolent drug offenders ­and political careers are
made on the basis of the public's reaction to the media coverage of
such crimes.

* * *

Despite a sharp national decline in crime, American criminal justice
has become crueler and less caring than it has been at any other time
in our modern history. Why?

The question has no simple answer, but the racial composition of
prisons is a good place to start. The punitive turn in the nation's
social policy ­intimately connected with public rhetoric about
responsibility, dependency, social hygiene, and the reclamation of
public order ­can be fully grasped only when viewed against the
backdrop of America's often ugly and violent racial history: there is
a reason why our inclination toward forgiveness and the extension of
a second chance to those who have violated our behavioral strictures
is so stunted, and why our mainstream political discourses are so
bereft of self-examination and searching social criticism.

This historical resonance between the stigma of race and the stigma
of imprisonment serves to keep alive in our public culture the
subordinating social meanings that have always been associated with
blackness. Race helps to explain why the United States is exceptional
among the democratic industrial societies in the severity and extent
of its punitive policy and in the paucity of its social-welfare
institutions.

Slavery ended a long time ago, but the institution of chattel slavery
and the ideology of racial subordination that accompanied it have
cast a long shadow. I speak here of the history of lynching
throughout the country; the racially biased policing and judging in
the South under Jim Crow and in the cities of the Northeast, Midwest,
and West to which blacks migrated after the First and Second World
Wars; and the history of racial apartheid that ended only as a matter
of law with the civil-rights movement. It should come as no surprise
that in the post–civil rights era, race, far from being peripheral,
has been central to the evolution of American social policy.

The political scientist Vesla Mae Weaver, in a recently completed
dissertation, examines policy history, public opinion, and media
processes in an attempt to understand the role of race in this
historic transformation of criminal justice. She argues ­persuasively,
I think ­that the punitive turn represented a political response to
the success of the civil-rights movement. Weaver describes a process
of &quot;frontlash&quot; in which opponents of the civil-rights revolution
sought to regain the upper hand by shifting to a new issue. Rather
than reacting directly to civil-rights developments, and thus
continuing to fight a battle they had lost, those opponents ­consider
George Wallace's campaigns for the presidency, which drew so much
support in states like Michigan and WisconsinÂ­shifted attention to a
seemingly race-neutral concern over crime:

Once the clutch of Jim Crow had loosened, opponents of civil rights
shifted the &quot;locus of attack&quot; by injecting crime onto the agenda.
Through the process of frontlash, rivals of civil rights progress
defined racial discord as criminal and argued that crime legislation
would be a panacea to racial unrest. This strategy both imbued crime
with race and depoliticized racial struggle, a formula which
foreclosed earlier &quot;root causes&quot; alternatives. Fusing anxiety about
crime to anxiety over racial change and riots, civil rights and
racial disorder ­initially defined as a problem of minority
disenfranchisement­ were defined as a crime problem, which helped
shift debate from social reform to punishment.

Of course, this argument (for which Weaver adduces considerable
circumstantial evidence) is speculative. But something interesting
seems to have been going on in the late 1960s regarding the
relationship between attitudes on race and social policy.

Before 1965, public attitudes on the welfare state and on race, as
measured by the annually administered General Social Survey, varied
year to year independently of one another: you could not predict much
about a person's attitudes on welfare politics by knowing their
attitudes about race.

After 1965, the attitudes moved in tandem, as welfare came to be seen
as a race issue. Indeed, the year-to-year correlation between an
index measuring liberalism of racial attitudes and attitudes toward
the welfare state over the interval 1950–1965 was .03.

These same two series had a correlation of .68 over the period 1966–
1996. The association in the American mind of race with welfare, and
of race with crime, has been achieved at a common historical moment.

Crime-control institutions are part of a larger social-policy
complex ­they relate to and interact with the labor market, family-
welfare efforts, and health and social-work activities. Indeed,
Garland argues that the ideological approaches to welfare and crime
control have marched rightward to a common beat: &quot;The institutional
and cultural changes that have occurred in the crime control field
are analogous to those that have occurred in the welfare state more
generally.&quot;

Just as the welfare state came to be seen as a race issue, so, too,
crime came to be seen as a race issue, and policies have been shaped
by this perception.

Consider the tortured racial history of the War on Drugs.

Blacks were twice as likely as whites to be arrested for a drug
offense in 1975 but four times as likely by 1989.

Throughout the 1990s, drug-arrest rates remained at historically
unprecedented levels. Yet according to the National Survey on Drug
Abuse, drug use among adults fell from 20 percent in 1979 to 11
percent in 2000. A similar trend occurred among adolescents. In the
age groups 12–17 and 18–25, use of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin all
peaked in the late 1970s and began a steady decline thereafter.

Thus, a decline in drug use across the board had begun a decade
before the draconian anti-drug efforts of the 1990s were initiated.

Of course, most drug arrests are for trafficking, not possession, so
usage rates and arrest rates needn't be expected to be identical.

Still, we do well to bear in mind that the social problem of illicit
drug use is endemic to our whole society.

Significantly, throughout the period 1979–2000, white high-school
seniors reported using drugs at a significantly higher rate than
black high-school seniors. High drug-usage rates in white, middle-
class American communities in the early 1980s accounts for the
urgency many citizens felt to mount a national attack on the problem.
But how successful has the effort been, and at what cost?

Think of the cost this way: to save middle-class kids from the threat
of a drug epidemic that might not have even existed by the time that
drug incarceration began its rapid increase in the 1980s, we
criminalized underclass kids. Arrests went up, but drug prices have
fallen sharply over the past 20 years ­suggesting that the ratcheting
up of enforcement has not made drugs harder to get on the street.

The strategy clearly wasn't keeping drugs away from those who sought
them. Not only are prices down, but the data show that drug-related
visits to emergency rooms also rose steadily throughout the 1980s and
1990s.

An interesting case in point is New York City. Analyzing arrests by
residential neighborhood and police precinct, the criminologist
Jeffrey Fagan and his colleagues Valerie West and Jan Holland found
that incarceration was highest in the city's poorest neighborhoods,
though these were often not the neighborhoods in which crime rates
were the highest.

Moreover, they discovered a perverse effect of incarceration on
crime: higher incarceration in a given neighborhood in one year
seemed to predict higher crime rates in that same neighborhood one
year later. This growth and persistence of incarceration over time,
the authors concluded, was due primarily to the drug enforcement
practices of police and to sentencing laws that require imprisonment
for repeat felons. Police scrutiny was more intensive and less
forgiving in high-incarceration neighborhoods, and parolees returning
to such neighborhoods were more closely monitored.

Thus, discretionary and spatially discriminatory police behavior led
to a high and increasing rate of repeat prison admissions in the
designated neighborhoods, even as crime rates fell.

Fagan, West, and Holland explain the effects of spatially
concentrated urban anti-drug-law enforcement in the contemporary
American metropolis. Buyers may come from any neighborhood and any
social stratum. But the sellers ­at least the ones who can be readily
found hawking their wares on street corners and in public
vestibulesÂ­come predominantly from the poorest, most non-white parts
of the city. The police, with arrest quotas to meet, know precisely
where to find them.

The researchers conclude:  Incarceration begets more incarceration,
and incarceration also begets more crime, which in turn invites more
aggressive enforcement, which then re-supplies incarceration. .. three
mechanisms.. . contribute to and reinforce incarceration in
neighborhoods: the declining economic fortunes of former inmates and
the effects on neighborhoods where they tend to reside, resource and
relationship strains on families of prisoners that weaken the
family's ability to supervise children, and voter disenfranchisement
that weakens the political economy of neighborhoods.

The effects of imprisonment on life chances are profound.

For incarcerated black men, hourly wages are ten percent lower after
prison than before. For all incarcerated men, the number of weeks
worked per year falls by at least a third after their release.

So consider the nearly 60 percent of black male high-school dropouts
born in the late 1960s who are imprisoned before their 40th year.

While locked up, these felons are stigmatized ­they are regarded as
fit subjects for shaming. Their links to family are disrupted; their
opportunities for work are diminished; their voting rights may be
permanently revoked. They suffer civic excommunication.

Our zeal for social discipline consigns these men to a permanent
nether caste. And yet, since these men ­whatever their shortcomings ­
have emotional and sexual and family needs, including the need to be
fathers and lovers and husbands, we are creating a situation where
the children of this nether caste are likely to join a new generation
of untouchables.

This cycle will continue so long as incarceration is viewed as the
primary path to social hygiene.

* * *

I have been exploring the issue of causes: of why we took the
punitive turn that has resulted in mass incarceration. But even if
the racial argument about causes is inconclusive, the racial
consequences are clear. To be sure, in the United States, as in any
society, public order is maintained by the threat and use of force.

We enjoy our good lives only because we are shielded by the forces of
law and order, which keep the unruly at bay. Yet in this society, to
a degree virtually unmatched in any other, those bearing the brunt of
order enforcement belong in vastly disproportionate numbers to
historically marginalized racial groups. Crime and punishment in
America has a color.

In his fine study Punishment and Inequality in America (2006), the
Princeton University sociologist Bruce Western powerfully describes
the scope, nature, and consequences of contemporary imprisonment. He
finds that the extent of racial disparity in imprisonment rates is
greater than in any other major arena of American social life: at
eight to one, the black–white ratio of incarceration rates dwarfs the
two-to-one ratio of unemployment rates, the three-to-one ration of
non-marital childbearing, the two-to-one ratio of infant-mortality
rates and one-to-five ratio of net worth.

While three out of 200 young whites were incarcerated in 2000, the
rate for young blacks was one in nine. A black male resident of the
state of California is more likely to go to a state prison than a
state college.

The scandalous truth is that the police and penal apparatus are now
the primary contact between adult black American men and the American
state. Among black male high-school dropouts aged 20 to 40, a third
were locked up on any given day in 2000, fewer than three percent
belonged to a union, and less than one quarter were enrolled in any
kind of social program. Coercion is the most salient meaning of
government for these young men.

Western estimates that nearly 60 percent of black male dropouts born
between 1965 and 1969 were sent to prison on a felony conviction at
least once before they reached the age of 35.

One cannot reckon the world-historic American prison build-up over
the past 35 years without calculating the enormous costs imposed upon
the persons imprisoned, their families, and their communities. (Of
course, this has not stopped many social scientists from pronouncing
on the net benefits of incarceration without doing so.)

Deciding on the weight to give to a &quot;thug's&quot; well-being ­or to that of
his wife or daughter or son ­is a question of social morality, not
social science.

Nor can social science tell us how much additional cost borne by the
offending class is justified in order to obtain a given increment of
security or property or peace of mind for the rest of us. These are
questions about the nature of the American state and its relationship
to its people that transcend the categories of benefits and costs.

Yet the discourse surrounding punishment policy invariably discounts
the humanity of the thieves, drug sellers, prostitutes, rapists, and,
yes, those whom we put to death. It gives insufficient weight to the
welfare, to the humanity, of those who are knitted together with
offenders in webs of social and psychic affiliation.

What is more, institutional arrangements for dealing with criminal
offenders in the United States have evolved to serve expressive as
well as instrumental ends. We have wanted to &quot;send a message,&quot; and we
have done so with a vengeance. In the process, we have created facts.

We have answered the question, who is to blame for the domestic
maladies that beset us? We have constructed a national narrative.

We have created scapegoats, indulged our need to feel virtuous, and
assuaged our fears. We have met the enemy, and the enemy is them.

Incarceration keeps them away from us. Thus Garland: &quot;The prison is
used today as a kind of reservation, a quarantine zone in which
purportedly dangerous individuals are segregated in the name of
public safety.&quot; The boundary between prison and community, Garland
continues, is &quot;heavily patrolled and carefully monitored to prevent
risks leaking out from one to the other. Those offenders who are
released 'into the community' are subject to much tighter control
than previously, and frequently find themselves returned to custody
for failure to comply with the conditions that continue to restrict
their freedom.

For many of these parolees and ex-convicts, the 'community' into
which they are released is actually a closely monitored terrain, a
supervised space, lacking much of the liberty that one associates
with 'normal life'.&quot;

Deciding how citizens of varied social rank within a common polity
ought to relate to one another is a more fundamental consideration
than deciding which crime-control policy is most efficient. The
question of relationship, of solidarity, of who belongs to the body
politic and who deserves exclusion ­these are philosophical concerns
of the highest order.

A decent society will on occasion resist the efficient course of
action, for the simple reason that to follow it would be to act as
though we were not the people we have determined ourselves to be: a
people conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that we
all are created equal. Assessing the propriety of creating a racially
defined pariah class in the middle of our great cities at the start
of the 21st century presents us with just such a case.

My recitation of the brutal facts about punishment in today's America
may sound to some like a primal scream at this monstrous social
machine that is grinding poor black communities to dust.

And I confess that these brutal facts do at times incline me to cry
out in despair. But my argument is analytical, not existential. Its
principal thesis is this: we law-abiding, middle-class Americans have
made decisions about social policy and incarceration, and we benefit
from those decisions, and that means from a system of suffering,
rooted in state violence, meted out at our request. We had choices
and we decided to be more punitive. Our society ­the society we have
made ­creates criminogenic conditions in our sprawling urban ghettos,
and then acts out rituals of punishment against them as some awful
form of human sacrifice.

This situation raises a moral problem that we cannot avoid. We cannot
pretend that there are more important problems in our society, or
that this circumstance is the necessary solution to other, more
pressing problems ­unless we are also prepared to say that we have
turned our backs on the ideal of equality for all citizens and
abandoned the principles of justice.

We ought to ask ourselves two questions: Just what manner of people
are we Americans? And in light of this, what are our obligations to
our fellow citizens ­even those who break our laws?

* * *

To address these questions, we need to think about the evaluation of
our prison system as a problem in the theory of distributive
justice ­not the purely procedural idea of ensuring equal treatment
before the law and thereafter letting the chips fall where they may,
but the rather more demanding ideal of substantive racial justice.

The goal is to bring about through conventional social policy and
far-reaching institutional reforms a situation in which the history
of racial oppression is no longer so evident in the disparate life
experiences of those who descend from slaves.

And I suggest we approach that problem from the perspective of John
Rawls's theory of justice: first, that we think about justice from an
&quot;original position&quot; behind a &quot;veil of ignorance&quot; that obstructs from
view our own situation, including our class, race, gender, and
talents.

We need to ask what rules we would pick if we seriously imagined that
we could turn out to be anyone in the society.

Second, following Rawls's &quot;difference principle,&quot; we should permit
inequalities only if they work to improve the circumstances of the
least advantaged members of society. But here, the object of moral
inquiry is not the distribution among individuals of wealth and
income, but instead the distribution of a negative good, punishment,
among individuals and, importantly, racial groups.

So put yourself in John Rawls's original position and imagine that
you could occupy any rank in the social hierarchy. Let me be more
concrete: imagine that you could be born a black American male
outcast shuffling between prison and the labor market on his way to
an early death to the chorus of nigger or criminal or dummy.

Suppose we had to stop thinking of us and them. What social rules
would we pick if we actually thought that they could be us? I expect
that we would still pick some set of punishment institutions to
contain bad behavior and protect society. But wouldn't we pick
arrangements that respected the humanity of each individual and of
those they are connected to through bonds of social and psychic
affiliation?

If any one of us had a real chance of being one of those faces
looking up from the bottom of the well ­of being the least among us-­
then how would we talk publicly about those who break our laws? What
would we do with juveniles who go awry, who roam the streets with
guns and sometimes commit acts of violence?

What weight would we give to various elements in the deterrence-
retribut ion-incapacitati on-rehabilitatio n calculus, if we thought
that calculus could end up being applied to our own children, or to
us? How would we apportion blame and affix responsibility for the
cultural and social pathologies evident in some quarters of our
society if we envisioned that we ourselves might well have been born
into the social margins where such pathology flourishes?

If we take these questions as seriously as we should, then we would,
I expect, reject a pure ethic of personal responsibility as the basis
for distributing punishment.

Issues about responsibility are complex, and involve a kind of
division of labor ­what John Rawls called a &quot;social division of
responsibility&quot; between &quot;citizens as a collective body&quot; and
individuals: when we hold a person responsible for his or her
conduct ­by establishing laws, investing in their enforcement, and
consigning some persons to prisons ­we need also to think about
whether we have done our share in ensuring that each person faces a
decent set of opportunities for a good life. We need to ask whether
we as a society have fulfilled our collective responsibility to
ensure fair conditions for each person ­for each life that might turn
out to be our life.

We would, in short, recognize a kind of social responsibility, even
for the wrongful acts freely chosen by individual persons. I am not
arguing that people commit crimes because they have no choices, and
that in this sense the &quot;root causes&quot; of crime are social; individuals
always have choices.

My point is that responsibility is a matter of ethics, not social
science. Society at large is implicated in an individual person's
choices because we have acquiesced in ­perhaps actively supported,
through our taxes and votes, words and deeds ­social arrangements that
work to our benefit and his detriment, and which shape his
consciousness and sense of identity in such a way that the choices he
makes, which we may condemn, are nevertheless compelling to himÂ­an
entirely understandable response to circumstance.

Closed and bounded social structures ­like racially homogeneous urban
ghettos ­create contexts where &quot;pathological&quot; and &quot;dysfunctional&quot;
cultural forms emerge; but these forms are neither intrinsic to the
people caught in these structures nor independent of the behavior of
people who stand outside them.

Thus, a central reality of our time is the fact that there has opened
a wide racial gap in the acquisition of cognitive skills, the extent
of law-abidingness, the stability of family relations, the attachment
to the work force, and the like.

This disparity in human development is, as a historical matter,
rooted in political, economic, social, and cultural factors peculiar
to this society and reflective of its unlovely racial history: it is
a societal, not communal or personal, achievement.

At the level of the individual case we must, of course, act as if
this were not so. There could be no law, no civilization, without the
imputation to particular persons of responsibility for their wrongful
acts. But the sum of a million cases, each one rightly judged on its
merits to be individually fair, may nevertheless constitute a great
historic wrong. The state does not only deal with individual cases.
It also makes policies in the aggregate, and the consequences of
these policies are more or less knowable. And who can honestly say
who can look in the mirror and say with a straight face ­that we now
have laws and policies that we would endorse if we did not know our
own situation and genuinely considered the possibility that we might
be the least advantaged?

Even if the current racial disparity in punishment in our country
gave evidence of no overt racial discrimination­ and, perhaps needless
to say, I view that as a wildly optimistic supposition ­it would still
be true that powerful forces are at work to perpetuate the
consequences of a universally acknowledged wrongful past. This is in
the first instance a matter of interpretation­ of the narrative
overlay that we impose upon the facts.

The tacit association in the American public's imagination of
&quot;blackness&quot; with &quot;unworthiness&quot; or &quot;dangerousness&quot; has obscured a
fundamental ethical point about responsibility, both collective and
individual, and promoted essentialist causal misattributions: when
confronted by the facts of racially disparate achievement, racially
disproportionate crime rates, and racially unequal school
achievement, observers will have difficulty identifying with the
plight of a group of people whom they (mistakenly) think are simply
&quot;reaping what they have sown.&quot;

Thus, the enormous racial disparity in the imposition of social
exclusion, civic ex-communication, and lifelong disgrace has come to
seem legitimate, even necessary: we fail to see how our failures as a
collective body are implicated in this disparity. We shift all the
responsibility onto their shoulders, only by irresponsibly­ indeed,
immorally ­denying our own. And yet, this entire dynamic has its roots
in past unjust acts that were perpetrated on the basis of race.

Given our history, producing a racially defined nether caste through
the ostensibly neutral application of law should be profoundly
offensive to our ethical sensibilities­ to the principles we proudly
assert as our own. Mass incarceration has now become a principal
vehicle for the reproduction of racial hierarchy in our society.

Our country's policymakers need to do something about it. And all of
us are ultimately responsible for making sure that they do.
