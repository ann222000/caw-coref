I agree with Southwest's decision, even though I also agree with
Ms. Heasley's t-shirt. The rules in this country are simple: If you
want to make a political statement, do it on public or your own
property, not on other people's private property.

&gt; Southwest boots woman for shirt

&gt; Lorrie Heasley to sue for being asked to leave a flight because of her
&gt; politically charged T-shirt.
&gt; October 6, 2005

&gt; NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Southwest Airlines kicked a woman off one of
&gt; its flights over a political message on her T-shirt, the airline
&gt; confirmed Thursday, and published reports say the passenger will sue.

&gt; Lorrie Heasley, of Woodland, Wash., was asked to leave her flight from
&gt; Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., Tuesday for wearing a T-shirt with
&gt; pictures of President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary
&gt; of State Condoleezza Rice and a phrase similar to the popular film
&gt; title &quot;Meet the Fockers.&quot;

&gt; A spokesman for Southwest Airlines (up $0.24 to $15.25, Research) told
&gt; CNN that the airline used the &quot;common sense&quot; approach when they
&gt; decided to escort Heasley from the plane in Reno, Nevada, during a
&gt; stopover between Los Angeles and Portland, Ore.

&gt; The airline felt that the T-shirt was offensive and that other
&gt; passengers would be outraged by it, the spokeswoman said, adding that
&gt; the incident is about &quot;decency.&quot;

&gt;&quot;I have cousins in Iraq and other relatives going to war,&quot; Heasley
&gt; told the Reno Gazette-Journal. &quot;Here we are trying to free another
&gt; country and I have to get off an airplane in midflight over a T-shirt.
&gt; That's not freedom.&quot;

&gt; According to the airline spokeswoman, Heasley was asked to leave after
&gt; she refused to cover up her T-shirt, an account that conflicts with
&gt; Heasley's version in the Gazette-Journal.

&gt; Heasley told the newspaper that she agreed to cover her shirt with a
&gt; sweatshirt, but it slipped as she slept. After she was ordered to wear
&gt; her T-shirt inside-out or leave, she and her husband chose to leave,
&gt; the paper said.

&gt; The 32-year-old lumber saleswoman said in the report that no one from
&gt; Southwest said anything about the shirt while she waited near the gate
&gt; at Los Angeles International Airport, nor did anyone mention the shirt
&gt; as she boarded the aircraft.

&gt; Southwest Airlines (up $0.24 to $15.25, Research) spokeswoman Marilee
&gt; McInnis told the Gazette-Journal that the airline's contract with the
&gt; Federal Aviation Administration contains rules that say the airline
&gt; will deny boarding to any customer whose conduct is offensive,
&gt; abusive, disorderly or violent or for clothing that is &quot;lewd, obscene,
&gt; or patently offensive.&quot;

&gt; FAA spokesman Donn Walker told the newspaper that no federal rules
&gt; exist on the subject.

&gt;&quot;It's up to the airlines who they want to take and by what rules,&quot; he
&gt; was quoted as saying. &quot;The government just doesn't get into the
&gt; business of what people wear on an aircraft.&quot;

&gt; Heasley wants Southwest to reimburse her and her husband for the last
&gt; leg of their trip and pay for her gasoline, a $68 rental car from Avis
&gt; and a $70 hotel bill, according to reports.

We all know that &quot;freedom of speech&quot; only goes so far (as in the
proverbial shouting fire in a crowded theater scenario....)
Personally I love the &quot;F word&quot; but I would never display it on a shirt
in front of people I don't know because I KNOW that that word can be
quite offensive to many others and they have rights too, and really,
this is what this is really all about..........the rights of others NOT
to be offended, not the rights of someone who has no regard for how her
behavior affects others. We live in such a selfish, &quot;it's all about
me&quot; society that it's just sickening. Good for Southwest Airlines for
not looking the other way.

She can't sue me as a result for a 1st ammendment violation. I'm not

true for an Airlines flight. They have the right to refuse business
from anyone so long as they are not discriminating based on protected
status.

which obviously meant it read 'Meet the Fuckers'. That can
easily be construed as obscene regardless of one's political
beliefs.

As for our founding fathers, when did they ever advocate the
violation of your private property to accomodate someone
else's political free speech?

Southwest Airlines is a profitable airline and has paid all it's own

other airlines, it would not matter. We don't have state owned airlines
in the US.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with Southwest's decision, even though I also agree with
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ms. Heasley's t-shirt. The rules in this country are simple: If
&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; want to make a political statement, do it on public or your own
&gt;&gt;&gt; property, not on other people's private property.

&gt;&gt; Way to piss on your founding fathers.

&gt; The article said her t-shirt was /similar/ to Meet the Fockers,
&gt; which obviously meant it read 'Meet the Fuckers'. That can
&gt; easily be construed as obscene regardless of one's political
&gt; beliefs.

&gt; As for our founding fathers, when did they ever advocate the
&gt; violation of your private property to accomodate someone
&gt; else's political free speech?

"/> In my days at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom, we were told that if we saw
someone with a improper shirt, we were to call security. Reason being, if
they were stupid enough to wear a shirt like that, then they were to be
stupid enough to beat a worker up. Security agents would get the guest
aside and tell them that they cannot wear a shirt with profanity or sexual
suggestive comments on them. Either get a different shirt if they had one,
get them a shirt which the guest would pay for or have them escorted from
the property. One said he had the freedom of speech to wear a shirt with
the words, &quot;I suck cock!&quot;, he had to be told that a shirt like that is
improper at a amusement park where they are kids. Tough shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Southwest boots woman for shirt

&gt;&gt;&gt; Lorrie Heasley to sue for being asked to leave a flight because of her
&gt;&gt;&gt; politically charged T-shirt.
&gt;&gt;&gt; October 6, 2005

&gt;&gt;&gt; NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Southwest Airlines kicked a woman off one of
&gt;&gt;&gt; its flights over a political message on her T-shirt, the airline
&gt;&gt;&gt; confirmed Thursday, and published reports say the passenger will sue.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Lorrie Heasley, of Woodland, Wash., was asked to leave her flight from
&gt;&gt;&gt; Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., Tuesday for wearing a T-shirt with
&gt;&gt;&gt; pictures of President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary
&gt;&gt;&gt; of State Condoleezza Rice and a phrase similar to the popular film
&gt;&gt;&gt; title &quot;Meet the Fockers.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; A spokesman for Southwest Airlines (up $0.24 to $15.25, Research) told
&gt;&gt;&gt; CNN that the airline used the &quot;common sense&quot; approach when they
&gt;&gt;&gt; decided to escort Heasley from the plane in Reno, Nevada, during a
&gt;&gt;&gt; stopover between Los Angeles and Portland, Ore.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The airline felt that the T-shirt was offensive and that other
&gt;&gt;&gt; passengers would be outraged by it, the spokeswoman said, adding that
&gt;&gt;&gt; the incident is about &quot;decency.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I have cousins in Iraq and other relatives going to war,&quot; Heasley
&gt;&gt;&gt; told the Reno Gazette-Journal. &quot;Here we are trying to free another
&gt;&gt;&gt; country and I have to get off an airplane in midflight over a T-shirt.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's not freedom.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; According to the airline spokeswoman, Heasley was asked to leave after
&gt;&gt;&gt; she refused to cover up her T-shirt, an account that conflicts with
&gt;&gt;&gt; Heasley's version in the Gazette-Journal.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Heasley told the newspaper that she agreed to cover her shirt with a
&gt;&gt;&gt; sweatshirt, but it slipped as she slept. After she was ordered to wear
&gt;&gt;&gt; her T-shirt inside-out or leave, she and her husband chose to leave,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the paper said.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The 32-year-old lumber saleswoman said in the report that no one from
&gt;&gt;&gt; Southwest said anything about the shirt while she waited near the gate
&gt;&gt;&gt; at Los Angeles International Airport, nor did anyone mention the shirt
&gt;&gt;&gt; as she boarded the aircraft.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Southwest Airlines (up $0.24 to $15.25, Research) spokeswoman Marilee
&gt;&gt;&gt; McInnis told the Gazette-Journal that the airline's contract with the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Federal Aviation Administration contains rules that say the airline
&gt;&gt;&gt; will deny boarding to any customer whose conduct is offensive,
&gt;&gt;&gt; abusive, disorderly or violent or for clothing that is &quot;lewd, obscene,
&gt;&gt;&gt; or patently offensive.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; FAA spokesman Donn Walker told the newspaper that no federal rules
&gt;&gt;&gt; exist on the subject.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;It's up to the airlines who they want to take and by what rules,&quot; he
&gt;&gt;&gt; was quoted as saying. &quot;The government just doesn't get into the
&gt;&gt;&gt; business of what people wear on an aircraft.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Heasley wants Southwest to reimburse her and her husband for the last
&gt;&gt;&gt; leg of their trip and pay for her gasoline, a $68 rental car from Avis
&gt;&gt;&gt; and a $70 hotel bill, according to reports.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We all know that &quot;freedom of speech&quot; only goes so far (as in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; proverbial shouting fire in a crowded theater scenario....)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally I love the &quot;F word&quot; but I would never display it on a shirt
&gt;&gt;&gt; in front of people I don't know because I KNOW that that word can be
&gt;&gt;&gt; quite offensive to many others and they have rights too, and really,
&gt;&gt;&gt; this is what this is really all about..........the rights of others
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be offended, not the rights of someone who has no regard for how
&gt;&gt;&gt; her
&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior affects others. We live in such a selfish, &quot;it's all about
&gt;&gt;&gt; me&quot; society that it's just sickening. Good for Southwest Airlines
&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; not looking the other way.

&gt;&gt; Freedom of speech does not apply to privately held entities. If she
&gt;&gt; wore that shirt to my house, I have every right to throw her ass out.
&gt;&gt; She can't sue me as a result for a 1st ammendment violation. I'm not
&gt;&gt; preventing her from exercising her rights somewhere else. The same is
&gt;&gt; true for an Airlines flight. They have the right to refuse business
&gt;&gt; from anyone so long as they are not discriminating based on protected
&gt;&gt; status.

&gt; Yes, but the airlines suck up so much government subsidy money it is
&gt; like they are public services. As such, freedom of speech does apply.

"/> ==============================

Then you have no problem having a homless street bum, getting a free ticket
to his mothers funeral and who has not showered or changed clothes in 12
months sit next to you on your next flight . It is his &quot; Free Speech &quot;
rights to smell like a rotting garbage dumpster and you have no right to
tell him he cant fly.

But after re-reading the article, I realized that the article was very

that the passenger was booted because the t-shirt was anti-Bush.

However, if you read the article carefully, they wrote, &quot;a phrase
similar to the popular film title Meet the Fockers&quot; and the picture of
the shirt was censored. Southwest booted her because of the obscenity
on her shirt, which I think is reasonable. She was in a public place
where there were children around.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Southwest boots woman for shirt

&gt;&gt;&gt; Lorrie Heasley to sue for being asked to leave a flight because of her
&gt;&gt;&gt; politically charged T-shirt.
&gt;&gt;&gt; October 6, 2005

&gt;&gt; As far as the fockers on the shirt, I wouldn't piss on them if they were
&gt;&gt; on fire. As far as the woman wearing the shirt goes, she is white trash
&gt;&gt; and needs her ass kicked for wearing a shirt like that in public in the
&gt;&gt; first place.

&gt; The words are the title of the most successful comedy movie of last year.

&gt; It wasn't the 'F' word.

&gt; You dumbass hillbillies don't even know the difference between 'Fockers'
and
&gt; 'Fuckers'.

&gt; Losers.

"/> =====================================

Hey Sphincter face, do you always make an ass of yourself like this, or is
it just an natural problem form your family inbreeding?

Lorrie Heasley, of Woodland, Wash., was asked to leave her flight from Los
Angeles to Portland, Ore., Tuesday for wearing a T-shirt with pictures of
President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice and a phrase similar to the popular film title &quot;Meet the
Fockers.&quot;

They exercise those rights every day. Many people are refused service
because they are too drunk. However, a passenger on a flight has no
&quot;rights&quot; to refuse service to someone else.

Most people here seem to be confusing what the government must do with
what a business entity must do. I can understand the confusion since
major corporations are running our government, but amazingly enough the
two things are still different.

with the word &quot;Fuck&quot; on it, which is in violation of Southwest's
written policies.

It's right in Southwest's Contract of Carriage, to which she agreed
when she bought her ticket. Here's the relevant passage:

===
10. Refusal to Transport
Carrier will refuse to transport, or will remove from an aircraft at
any point, any passenger in the following circumstances:
...
F. Comfort and Safety - Carrier may refuse to transport or remove from
the aircraft at any point any passenger in the following categories as
may be necessary for the comfort or safety of such passenger or other
passengers:
...
(1) Persons whose conduct is or has been known to be disorderly,
abusive, offensive, threatening, intimidating, or violent, or whose
clothing is lewd, obscene, or patently offensive.
===

She refused to abide by the terms of her contract, and Southwest was
perfectly within its rights to remove her from the plane.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We all know that &quot;freedom of speech&quot; only goes so far (as in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proverbial shouting fire in a crowded theater scenario....)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally I love the &quot;F word&quot; but I would never display it on a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shirt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in front of people I don't know because I KNOW that that word can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quite offensive to many others and they have rights too, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is what this is really all about..........the rights of others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be offended, not the rights of someone who has no regard for how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior affects others. We live in such a selfish, &quot;it's all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me&quot; society that it's just sickening. Good for Southwest Airlines
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not looking the other way.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Freedom of speech does not apply to privately held entities. If she
&gt;&gt;&gt; wore that shirt to my house, I have every right to throw her ass out.
&gt;&gt;&gt; She can't sue me as a result for a 1st ammendment violation. I'm not
&gt;&gt;&gt; preventing her from exercising her rights somewhere else. The same
&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; true for an Airlines flight. They have the right to refuse business
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anyone so long as they are not discriminating based on protected
&gt;&gt;&gt; status.

&gt;&gt; Yes, but the airlines suck up so much government subsidy money it is
&gt;&gt; like they are public services. As such, freedom of speech does apply.

&gt;Non sequitur. If you take a tax deduction for your home, does that mean
&gt;the government has the authority to tell you who you can and can't order
&gt;to leave your property?

"/> Be patient; this administration isn't over yet.

&gt;Southwest Airlines is a profitable airline and has paid all it's own

&gt;other airlines, it would not matter. We don't have state owned airlines

&gt;&gt; As far as the fockers on the shirt, I wouldn't piss on them if they were
&gt;&gt; on fire. As far as the woman wearing the shirt goes, she is white trash
&gt;&gt; and needs her ass kicked for wearing a shirt like that in public in the
&gt;&gt; first place.

&gt;Was she a danger to aircraft operations ?
&gt;Was she preventing crew from doing their work ?
&gt;Was she refusing security related requirements ?

&gt;One theme that has arisen from the &quot;Airline&quot; documentary about Southwest
&gt;(even if events are staged, they still reflect corporate policy) is that
&gt;the ariline has gotten quite picky about what passengers wear, and has
&gt;gotten very strict about alchool to a point of barring people based only
&gt;on intuition that the pax had a few drinks.

&gt;But being barred because she was wearing a political t-shirt goes beyond
&gt;what I expected, but am not surprised at all because of what the USA has
&gt;turned itself into in recent years. Remember radio stations who refused
&gt;to air songs from artists who criticised the USA invasion of Iraq ?

&gt;Southwest may have worked very hard to gain an image of reliability. But
&gt;now, it seems they are gaining am image of being very picky about
&gt;barring passengers, and if WN employees will barr you because they see
&gt;you from a wrong angle, you might wish to choose another airline if you
&gt;really must be at destination on time.

"/> I happen to live in Reno where this took place, so it has some local
interest to me personally.

The whole incident is interesting, actually.

Taken to the extreme, if I tried to get on a flight and sat next to
you and your ten year old daughter with my shirt that said:

&quot;George W. Bush Is A Drunken Cocksucker&quot;

You'd certainly have a legitimate point when you complained, in my
opinion. I ask you what your problem is and you say you're offended.
I'm sure others on the plane would agree with you. So, they kick me
off.

Now, suppose when I sat down I had a shirt on that said:

&quot;Jesus Christ Is A Loving Savior&quot;

and you happen to be an atheist. Due to your honest beliefs you are
truly offended by my shirt. In this case, you might have a problem
getting others on the plane to agree with you, but that shouldn't
matter.

So, should they kick me off now? I don't think so, but that's just me.

My point is, who gets to decide what is offensive and what is not? If
it comes down to &quot;local standards&quot;, then what is &quot;local&quot;? Where the
plane is taking off? Where it's going to land? Or the plane itself?

And, if it's the plane itself, and the plane happens to be completely
full of atheists, THEN should they kick me off for my Jesus shirt?

The airline opened a huge can of worms as the vast majority of people
can't be objective. People that hate bush wouldn't have a problem with
the lady's shirt; those who approve of bush would. Change the shirt to
&quot;Kerry Is A Foucker&quot; and the groups would be reversed in their
opinions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with Southwest's decision, even though I also agree with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ms. Heasley's t-shirt. The rules in this country are simple: If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want to make a political statement, do it on public or your own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; property, not on other people's private property.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Way to piss on your founding fathers.

&gt;&gt; The article said her t-shirt was /similar/ to Meet the Fockers,
&gt;&gt; which obviously meant it read 'Meet the Fuckers'. That can
&gt;&gt; easily be construed as obscene regardless of one's political
&gt;&gt; beliefs.

&gt;&gt; As for our founding fathers, when did they ever advocate the
&gt;&gt; violation of your private property to accomodate someone
&gt;&gt; else's political free speech?

&gt; Some people think the 1st ammendment gives them the right to say
&gt; anything anywhere they want. They need to go read it. It just says
&gt; Congress will make no law preventing free speech.

"/> No kidding. I have even encountered morons who claimed
that refusing to listen to them (killfiling them on the
net), magically violated their &quot;right&quot; to free speech.

And one time, during a three-person, online discussion,
I had...

a UK resident accuse...

me (an NZ resident)...

of violating the (US Constitutional) &quot;First Amendment
Rights&quot;...

of a Canadian resident...

because I dared to suggest that he might *not* know
everything about the topic.

Yes, that's right, kids... the world really is full of
people who are *that* stupid...

&gt;&gt;&gt;The woman was interviewed on Hannity this afternoon. She sounds like an

&gt;&gt; That's sounds better then.

&gt;&gt; No way ignorant twits should have any constitutional protection.

"/> I was being sarcastic.

When I first saw this story about the T-Shirt lady on MSNBC.com, the
story said the shirt had the pictures of cheney, rice and bush and it
said &quot;Meet The Fockers&quot; under it. It seemed to me that if they can
have movie billboards and TV advertising with that phrase it would be
unfair to exclude someone for having it on a shirt regardless of whose
picture it's under.

However, I just saw on the local news (I live in Reno) where it was
explained the shirts actually said &quot;Meet The Fuckers&quot;.

Somewhere in all that fine print on an airline ticket it apparently
says that they can exclude anyone dressed in a &quot;sexually suggestive or
offensive manner&quot;.

I guess you can't get any more &quot;sexually suggestive&quot; than a shirt with
FUCKER on it.

The airline was within their rights, I believe.

&gt;&gt; October 6, 2005

&gt;&gt; NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Southwest Airlines kicked a woman off one of
&gt;&gt; its flights over a political message on her T-shirt, the airline
&gt;&gt; confirmed Thursday, and published reports say the passenger will sue.

&gt;&gt; Lorrie Heasley, of Woodland, Wash., was asked to leave her flight from
&gt;&gt; Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., Tuesday for wearing a T-shirt with
&gt;&gt; pictures of President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary
&gt;&gt; of State Condoleezza Rice and a phrase similar to the popular film
&gt;&gt; title &quot;Meet the Fockers.&quot;

&gt;I hope SW is ready to pay a huge lawsuit bill. This country is getting
&gt;more and more fucked up by the minute.
&gt;-L.

"/> Problem is, CNN and MSNBC got the story wrong.

In fact, the shirt said &quot;Meet The FUCKERS&quot; (caps added by me), not
&quot;FOCKERS&quot;.

In other words, the shirt actually had the &quot;F&quot; word on it.

They just ran the story down on the local news; I live in Reno.

When the story was first reported and I thought it said &quot;Fockers&quot;, I
agreed with you...SW was dead wrong and better get the check book out.

But, it did indeed say &quot;Fuckers&quot;. As to whether or not it should be
legal to wear a shirt in public with &quot;Fucker&quot; on it is a different
discussion. On the airline ticket, in the fine print, it says you
can't wear &quot;sexually suggestive or offensive&quot; clothing.

Can't get much more &quot;sexually suggestive&quot; than using the &quot;F&quot; word.

the entire article very carefully, that is not stated anywhere.
Southwest simply objected to the profanity, which happened to be on a
political t-shirt. This article misconstrued the incident, which should
have been entirely unnewsworthy.

Just because legally WN is allowed to kick a passenger out because they

And that women was exercising a form of protest to refuse to adhere to
the victorian-era mentality that is developping in the USA. WM staff

Ironic that the Taliban's berka woudl be the perfect answer to flying on

Which word is obscene to you, commie?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; One theme that has arisen from the &quot;Airline&quot; documentary about
&gt;&gt; Southwest
&gt;&gt; (even if events are staged, they still reflect corporate policy) is
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; the ariline has gotten quite picky about what passengers wear, and has
&gt;&gt; gotten very strict about alchool to a point of barring people based
&gt;&gt; only
&gt;&gt; on intuition that the pax had a few drinks.

&gt; Alcohol at airports is a very bad example if you're trying to make some
&gt; sort of point here. How would you like it if you got up to 30,000 feet
&gt; and some asshole pukes all over himself and other passengers. How would
&gt; you like it if some dumb bastard got liquored up and starts assaulting
&gt; passengers and crew at 30,000 feet? It happens every day. You'd be
&gt; suprised at all the alcohol related problems at airports. Airlines have
&gt; an obligation to their employees and passengers to prevent this sort of
&gt; thing.

&gt;&gt; But being barred because she was wearing a political t-shirt goes
&gt;&gt; beyond
&gt;&gt; what I expected, but am not surprised at all because of what the USA
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; turned itself into in recent years. Remember radio stations who
&gt;&gt; refused
&gt;&gt; to air songs from artists who criticised the USA invasion of Iraq ?

&gt; It's not the same thing. It's not even in the same ballpark. She
&gt; wasn't barred for wearing a political t-shirt.

&gt;&gt; Southwest may have worked very hard to gain an image of reliability.
&gt;&gt; But
&gt;&gt; now, it seems they are gaining am image of being very picky about
&gt;&gt; barring passengers, and if WN employees will barr you because they see
&gt;&gt; you from a wrong angle, you might wish to choose another airline if
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt; really must be at destination on time.

&gt; Now you're going way out of line. If I pay $300 per ticket for myself
&gt; and my family for a flight, and I have some hillbilly with the word
&gt;&quot;Fuck&quot; on her t-shirt sitting next to me, I'm going to expect the
&gt; airline to do something about it. I'm as liberal as they come. This
&gt; issue has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with class
&gt; and self-respect.

"/> No matter what the shirt said, since the airline had reason to believe other
paying customers might be offended, they have a good case in asking the
individual to remedy the situation. In addition, the aircraft commander
(pilot) can legally kick someone off his plane if he/she feels there may be
something disruptive about the individual. As far as the plaintiff's asking
for compensation for expenses incurred in order to finish her trip as well
as a refund, I suspect it's either a lost cause or she will be found to
share fault. She could have remained on the plane merely by covering or
changing her shirt as asked but refused, thereby making a deliberate and
voluntary choice to leave.....Just my opinion

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We all know that &quot;freedom of speech&quot; only goes so far (as in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proverbial shouting fire in a crowded theater scenario....)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally I love the &quot;F word&quot; but I would never display it on a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shirt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in front of people I don't know because I KNOW that that word can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quite offensive to many others and they have rights too, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is what this is really all about..........the rights of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be offended, not the rights of someone who has no regard for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior affects others. We live in such a selfish, &quot;it's all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me&quot; society that it's just sickening. Good for Southwest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Airlines
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not looking the other way.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Freedom of speech does not apply to privately held entities. If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wore that shirt to my house, I have every right to throw her ass
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She can't sue me as a result for a 1st ammendment violation. I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preventing her from exercising her rights somewhere else. The same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; true for an Airlines flight. They have the right to refuse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; business
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from anyone so long as they are not discriminating based on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; status.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but the airlines suck up so much government subsidy money it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; like they are public services. As such, freedom of speech does
&gt;&gt;&gt; apply.
&gt;&gt; ==============================

&gt;&gt; Then you have no problem having a homless street bum, getting a free
&gt;&gt; ticket
&gt;&gt; to his mothers funeral and who has not showered or changed clothes in
&gt;&gt; 12
&gt;&gt; months sit next to you on your next flight . It is his &quot; Free Speech
&gt;&gt;&quot;
&gt;&gt; rights to smell like a rotting garbage dumpster and you have no right
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; tell him he cant fly.

&gt; He wouldn't have that right either. You're just as confused. The
&gt; airlines have a right to refuse to provide service in most instances.
&gt; They exercise those rights every day. Many people are refused service
&gt; because they are too drunk. However, a passenger on a flight has no
&gt;&quot;rights&quot; to refuse service to someone else.

"/> I think it is obvious that I would not have the authority to tell the
homeless man he can not fly. If it really bothered me that much, I
have the right to choose not to fly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Most people here seem to be confusing what the government must do with
&gt; what a business entity must do. I can understand the confusion since
&gt; major corporations are running our government, but amazingly enough the
&gt; two things are still different.

"/> Yes, this is a difficult area. The line between business entity and
government is not clear.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as the fockers on the shirt, I wouldn't piss on them if they
&gt;&gt;&gt; were
&gt;&gt;&gt; on fire. As far as the woman wearing the shirt goes, she is white
&gt;&gt;&gt; trash
&gt;&gt;&gt; and needs her ass kicked for wearing a shirt like that in public in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; first place.

&gt;&gt;Was she a danger to aircraft operations ?
&gt;&gt;Was she preventing crew from doing their work ?
&gt;&gt;Was she refusing security related requirements ?

&gt;&gt;One theme that has arisen from the &quot;Airline&quot; documentary about
&gt;&gt;Southwest
&gt;&gt;(even if events are staged, they still reflect corporate policy) is
&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;the ariline has gotten quite picky about what passengers wear, and has
&gt;&gt;gotten very strict about alchool to a point of barring people based
&gt;&gt;only
&gt;&gt;on intuition that the pax had a few drinks.

&gt;&gt;But being barred because she was wearing a political t-shirt goes
&gt;&gt;beyond
&gt;&gt;what I expected, but am not surprised at all because of what the USA
&gt;&gt;has
&gt;&gt;turned itself into in recent years. Remember radio stations who
&gt;&gt;refused
&gt;&gt;to air songs from artists who criticised the USA invasion of Iraq ?

&gt;&gt;Southwest may have worked very hard to gain an image of reliability.
&gt;&gt;But
&gt;&gt;now, it seems they are gaining am image of being very picky about
&gt;&gt;barring passengers, and if WN employees will barr you because they see
&gt;&gt;you from a wrong angle, you might wish to choose another airline if
&gt;&gt;you
&gt;&gt;really must be at destination on time.

&gt; I happen to live in Reno where this took place, so it has some local
&gt; interest to me personally.

&gt; The whole incident is interesting, actually.

&gt; Taken to the extreme, if I tried to get on a flight and sat next to
&gt; you and your ten year old daughter with my shirt that said:

&gt;&quot;George W. Bush Is A Drunken Cocksucker&quot;

&gt; You'd certainly have a legitimate point when you complained, in my
&gt; opinion. I ask you what your problem is and you say you're offended.
&gt; I'm sure others on the plane would agree with you. So, they kick me
&gt; off.

&gt; Now, suppose when I sat down I had a shirt on that said:

&gt;&quot;Jesus Christ Is A Loving Savior&quot;

&gt; and you happen to be an atheist. Due to your honest beliefs you are
&gt; truly offended by my shirt. In this case, you might have a problem
&gt; getting others on the plane to agree with you, but that shouldn't
&gt; matter.

&gt; So, should they kick me off now? I don't think so, but that's just me.

&gt; My point is, who gets to decide what is offensive and what is not? If
&gt; it comes down to &quot;local standards&quot;, then what is &quot;local&quot;? Where the
&gt; plane is taking off? Where it's going to land? Or the plane itself?

&gt; And, if it's the plane itself, and the plane happens to be completely
&gt; full of atheists, THEN should they kick me off for my Jesus shirt?

&gt; The airline opened a huge can of worms as the vast majority of people
&gt; can't be objective. People that hate bush wouldn't have a problem with
&gt; the lady's shirt; those who approve of bush would. Change the shirt to
&gt;&quot;Kerry Is A Foucker&quot; and the groups would be reversed in their
&gt; opinions.

"/> Airlines, or any other business for that matter, are not governed by
&quot;local standards&quot;. That term refers to illegal obscene material.
Airlines are going to apply reasonable standards before deeming
something offensive enough to remove a passenger. Which means they are
going to consider whether a reasonable person would consider something
offensive. Airlines will actually bend over backwards to keep from
removing people. Doing anything else is just not good for business all
the way around.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with Southwest's decision, even though I also agree with
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ms. Heasley's t-shirt. The rules in this country are simple: If you
&gt;&gt;&gt; want to make a political statement, do it on public or your own
&gt;&gt;&gt; property, not on other people's private property.

&gt;&gt;Way to piss on your founding fathers.

&gt; You need to take several classes in constitutional law. Because the
&gt; founding fathers you think would be pissed off indeed thought of this
&gt; kind of situation and made accommodations for it. Hence, freedom of
&gt; speech -- like EVERY OTHER RIGHT in the Constitution -- IS NOT
&gt; ABSOLUTE.

&gt; There's a difference between the language &quot;shall not be infringed&quot; and
&gt; extrapolating that to believe that anyone has the right to say
&gt; anything they want.

"/> Umm, I didn't think the issue was about guns. ;-) &quot;Shall not be infringed&quot;
part of the wording of the second amendment. The first is &quot;congress shall make
no law&quot;, meaning that others could restrict &quot;free speech&quot;, but the federal
government could not (though the meaning has changed through the years).

Article [I.]

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or
of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition
the Government for a redress of grievances.

Article [II.]

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as the fockers on the shirt, I wouldn't piss on them if they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on fire. As far as the woman wearing the shirt goes, she is white
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trash
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and needs her ass kicked for wearing a shirt like that in public in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Was she a danger to aircraft operations ?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Was she preventing crew from doing their work ?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Was she refusing security related requirements ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;One theme that has arisen from the &quot;Airline&quot; documentary about
&gt;&gt;&gt;Southwest
&gt;&gt;&gt;(even if events are staged, they still reflect corporate policy) is
&gt;&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;&gt;the ariline has gotten quite picky about what passengers wear, and has
&gt;&gt;&gt;gotten very strict about alchool to a point of barring people based
&gt;&gt;&gt;only
&gt;&gt;&gt;on intuition that the pax had a few drinks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But being barred because she was wearing a political t-shirt goes
&gt;&gt;&gt;beyond
&gt;&gt;&gt;what I expected, but am not surprised at all because of what the USA
&gt;&gt;&gt;has
&gt;&gt;&gt;turned itself into in recent years. Remember radio stations who
&gt;&gt;&gt;refused
&gt;&gt;&gt;to air songs from artists who criticised the USA invasion of Iraq ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Southwest may have worked very hard to gain an image of reliability.
&gt;&gt;&gt;But
&gt;&gt;&gt;now, it seems they are gaining am image of being very picky about
&gt;&gt;&gt;barring passengers, and if WN employees will barr you because they see
&gt;&gt;&gt;you from a wrong angle, you might wish to choose another airline if
&gt;&gt;&gt;you
&gt;&gt;&gt;really must be at destination on time.

&gt;&gt; I happen to live in Reno where this took place, so it has some local
&gt;&gt; interest to me personally.

&gt;&gt; The whole incident is interesting, actually.

&gt;&gt; Taken to the extreme, if I tried to get on a flight and sat next to
&gt;&gt; you and your ten year old daughter with my shirt that said:

&gt;&gt;&quot;George W. Bush Is A Drunken Cocksucker&quot;

&gt;&gt; You'd certainly have a legitimate point when you complained, in my
&gt;&gt; opinion. I ask you what your problem is and you say you're offended.
&gt;&gt; I'm sure others on the plane would agree with you. So, they kick me
&gt;&gt; off.

&gt;&gt; Now, suppose when I sat down I had a shirt on that said:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Jesus Christ Is A Loving Savior&quot;

&gt;&gt; and you happen to be an atheist. Due to your honest beliefs you are
&gt;&gt; truly offended by my shirt. In this case, you might have a problem
&gt;&gt; getting others on the plane to agree with you, but that shouldn't
&gt;&gt; matter.

&gt;&gt; So, should they kick me off now? I don't think so, but that's just me.

&gt;&gt; My point is, who gets to decide what is offensive and what is not? If
&gt;&gt; it comes down to &quot;local standards&quot;, then what is &quot;local&quot;? Where the
&gt;&gt; plane is taking off? Where it's going to land? Or the plane itself?

&gt;&gt; And, if it's the plane itself, and the plane happens to be completely
&gt;&gt; full of atheists, THEN should they kick me off for my Jesus shirt?

&gt;&gt; The airline opened a huge can of worms as the vast majority of people
&gt;&gt; can't be objective. People that hate bush wouldn't have a problem with
&gt;&gt; the lady's shirt; those who approve of bush would. Change the shirt to
&gt;&gt;&quot;Kerry Is A Foucker&quot; and the groups would be reversed in their
&gt;&gt; opinions.

&gt;Airlines, or any other business for that matter, are not governed by
&gt;&quot;local standards&quot;. That term refers to illegal obscene material.
&gt;Airlines are going to apply reasonable standards before deeming
&gt;something offensive enough to remove a passenger. Which means they are
&gt;going to consider whether a reasonable person would consider something
&gt;offensive. Airlines will actually bend over backwards to keep from
&gt;removing people. Doing anything else is just not good for business all
&gt;the way around.

"/> Certainly true; they don't want to stop people from flying.

According to the news last night, the SW policy for attire is you
can't wear anything that's &quot;sexually suggestive or offensive&quot;.

Moreover, the first reports on CNN and MSNBC were incorrect:

The shirt did NOT say: &quot;Meet The Fockers&quot;, like the movie name. It
said &quot;Meet The Fuckers&quot;.

SW deems the &quot;F&quot; word as sexually suggestive and/or offensive
obviously.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with Southwest's decision, even though I also agree with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ms. Heasley's t-shirt. The rules in this country are simple: If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want to make a political statement, do it on public or your own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; property, not on other people's private property.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Way to piss on your founding fathers.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You need to take several classes in constitutional law. Because the
&gt;&gt;&gt; founding fathers you think would be pissed off indeed thought of this
&gt;&gt;&gt; kind of situation and made accommodations for it. Hence, freedom of
&gt;&gt;&gt; speech -- like EVERY OTHER RIGHT in the Constitution -- IS NOT
&gt;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTE.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There's a difference between the language &quot;shall not be infringed&quot; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; extrapolating that to believe that anyone has the right to say
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything they want.

&gt;&gt;Umm, I didn't think the issue was about guns. ;-) &quot;Shall not be infringed&quot;
&gt;&gt;part of the wording of the second amendment. The first is &quot;congress shall make
&gt;&gt;no law&quot;, meaning that others could restrict &quot;free speech&quot;, but the federal
&gt;&gt;government could not (though the meaning has changed through the years).

&gt; That's not true either. There are limits to everything. You have the
&gt; freedom of speech and freedom to assemble, but if you express yourself
&gt; in a manner that's not peaceful, you can be arrested and such arrests
&gt; are totally legal.

"/> Sure. The point is that *congress* cannot make a law limiting speech, but it
can make laws restricting actions. Sometimes the need for one overrides the
other. SCotUS constantly paints this edge.

OTOH, the first amendment, in itself, doesn't preclude the states from making
such laws. It *certainly* doesn't apply to individuals. Very little of the
constitution restricts individuals (13th amendment noted).

&gt;Southwest simply objected to the profanity, which happened to be on a

&gt;have been entirely unnewsworthy.

"/> On our local news last night (I live in Reno) they showed a copy of a

The shirt had the word &quot;Fucker&quot; on it. Seems reasonable that most
people would find &quot;Fucker&quot; on a shirt &quot;sexually suggestive or
offensive&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Actually the shirt said &quot;Meet the Fuckers&quot;. Now can you guess which
&gt;&gt; word was obscene?

&gt;No matter what the shirt said, since the airline had reason to believe other
&gt;paying customers might be offended, they have a good case in asking the
&gt;individual to remedy the situation. In addition, the aircraft commander
&gt;(pilot) can legally kick someone off his plane if he/she feels there may be
&gt;something disruptive about the individual. As far as the plaintiff's asking
&gt;for compensation for expenses incurred in order to finish her trip as well
&gt;as a refund, I suspect it's either a lost cause or she will be found to
&gt;share fault. She could have remained on the plane merely by covering or
&gt;changing her shirt as asked but refused, thereby making a deliberate and
&gt;voluntary choice to leave.....Just my opinion

"/> Fortunately, in this case, SW had a written policy against passengers
wearing &quot;sexually suggestive or offensive&quot; attire, so it would appear
they're covered legally.

But I can see where the issue could get sticky...

Suppose I put on a shirt that said &quot;Jesus Christ Is Lord&quot; and got on a
plane. As luck would have it, the plane was full of satan worshipers
who were offended by my shirt. Maybe the situation got very vocal and
disruptive with all these satan people screaming they want me to take
it off, but I refuse.

On the one hand, the pilot could determine I was being a &quot;disruptive
influence&quot; and kick me off. But, if he did I'm sure I'd end up a
wealthy man.

"/> Southwest was seen as a Greyhound replacement. You have to accept to be
seated amongst all sorts of people. If you're not happy with that, fly
first class on a legacy airline and choose only wide body aircraft where
you are seated ahead of the door used to board cattle class.

And since people choose where they sit on WN, if you're not happy with
what a t-shirt says, why don't you sit elsewhere ?

If the lady comes and sits next to you, you might just ask that she find
another seat instead of making such a huge fuss about requiring her to
deplane. Whether it said fuckers or fockers is irrelevant. The context
of the t-shirt was clearly not sexual. It was a take on a movie title
with a political statement.

The lady may have pushed the boundary a bit by wearing such a t-shirt on
a plane. But the people who complained about it deserve equal
criticism. They need to learn to be tolerant or people with different
opinions and lifestyles. Gessh, making such a big fuss about a t-shirt ?
Excuse me, but once seated, just how many people would get a full view
of her t-shirt ? Even if you walked back toward the lavatory, you
probably wouldn't get to see the full text of the t-shirt. And even if
seated next to her, would you really see the text from your point of
view unless you looked really har ? (at which point you'd be expelled
for being a pervert).

I guess World Weekly News t-shirts such as &quot;Teenage virgin gives birth
to black sheep&quot; (shows a teenage girl holding a baby black sheep in her
arms) or &quot;Space aliens made my daughter pregnant&quot; would also be
considered totally unacceptable ?

People need to grow up. If you don't like some t-shirt, the best thing
to do is to not bring ANY attention to it.

Consider that WN does no interlining. So when they barr you from a
flight (especially if it is midway in a journey), you are now stuck
paying last minute walk up fares which are exhorbitant on another
airline. Is it worth choosing Southwest if there are risks of some
employee will dislike what you wear, resulting in very expensive last
minute ticket purchases on another airline and schedule disruptions ?

I can understand WN wishing to improve its image from greyhound bus to
serious business-traveler airline. But such stories of indscriminate
denied boarding (especially midway in a journey) greatly remove the
feeling that WN will get you there reliably. There are smarter ways to
send a message that people should dress up when flying southwest. And WN
has its &quot;Airline&quot; PR machine it could use to get this done more
intelligently isntead of using it to constantly show WN staff denying
boarding to passengers. But I guess producers don't think that making an
intelligent show would work, so they go as low as they can.

&gt;&gt;Southwest boots woman for shirt

&gt;&gt;Lorrie Heasley to sue for being asked to leave a flight because of her
&gt;&gt;politically charged T-shirt.
&gt;&gt;October 6, 2005

&gt;&gt;NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Southwest Airlines kicked a woman off one of
&gt;&gt;its flights over a political message on her T-shirt, the airline
&gt;&gt;confirmed Thursday, and published reports say the passenger will sue.

&gt;&gt;Lorrie Heasley, of Woodland, Wash., was asked to leave her flight from
&gt;&gt;Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., Tuesday for wearing a T-shirt with
&gt;&gt;pictures of President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary
&gt;&gt;of State Condoleezza Rice and a phrase similar to the popular film
&gt;&gt;title &quot;Meet the Fockers.&quot;

&gt;&gt;A spokesman for Southwest Airlines (up $0.24 to $15.25, Research) told
&gt;&gt;CNN that the airline used the &quot;common sense&quot; approach when they
&gt;&gt;decided to escort Heasley from the plane in Reno, Nevada, during a
&gt;&gt;stopover between Los Angeles and Portland, Ore.

&gt;&gt;The airline felt that the T-shirt was offensive and that other
&gt;&gt;passengers would be outraged by it, the spokeswoman said, adding that
&gt;&gt;the incident is about &quot;decency.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&quot;I have cousins in Iraq and other relatives going to war,&quot; Heasley
&gt;&gt;told the Reno Gazette-Journal. &quot;Here we are trying to free another
&gt;&gt;country and I have to get off an airplane in midflight over a T-shirt.
&gt;&gt;That's not freedom.&quot;

&gt;&gt;According to the airline spokeswoman, Heasley was asked to leave after
&gt;&gt;she refused to cover up her T-shirt, an account that conflicts with
&gt;&gt;Heasley's version in the Gazette-Journal.

&gt;&gt;Heasley told the newspaper that she agreed to cover her shirt with a
&gt;&gt;sweatshirt, but it slipped as she slept. After she was ordered to wear
&gt;&gt;her T-shirt inside-out or leave, she and her husband chose to leave,
&gt;&gt;the paper said.

&gt;&gt;The 32-year-old lumber saleswoman said in the report that no one from
&gt;&gt;Southwest said anything about the shirt while she waited near the gate
&gt;&gt;at Los Angeles International Airport, nor did anyone mention the shirt
&gt;&gt;as she boarded the aircraft.

&gt;&gt;Southwest Airlines (up $0.24 to $15.25, Research) spokeswoman Marilee
&gt;&gt;McInnis told the Gazette-Journal that the airline's contract with the
&gt;&gt;Federal Aviation Administration contains rules that say the airline
&gt;&gt;will deny boarding to any customer whose conduct is offensive,
&gt;&gt;abusive, disorderly or violent or for clothing that is &quot;lewd, obscene,
&gt;&gt;or patently offensive.&quot;

&gt;&gt;FAA spokesman Donn Walker told the newspaper that no federal rules
&gt;&gt;exist on the subject.

&gt;&gt;&quot;It's up to the airlines who they want to take and by what rules,&quot; he
&gt;&gt;was quoted as saying. &quot;The government just doesn't get into the
&gt;&gt;business of what people wear on an aircraft.&quot;

&gt;&gt;Heasley wants Southwest to reimburse her and her husband for the last
&gt;&gt;leg of their trip and pay for her gasoline, a $68 rental car from Avis
&gt;&gt;and a $70 hotel bill, according to reports.

&gt;&gt; The words are the title of the most successful comedy movie of last

Here's the sentence - Read it carefully.

&quot;a shirt bearing the pictures of President Bush, Vice President Dick
Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice along with a phrase
using a swear word that mimicked the recent film, Meet the Fockers&quot;

No photos necessary, though maybe a class in reading comprehension.

"/> 1. Dictionary definitions are neither as exhaustive nor as accurate as they
used to be. The word &quot;usually&quot; leaves a lot to be desired, especially since
they don't offer the &quot;occasional&quot; definition. &quot;Sometimes used in the present
participle as a meaningless intensive&quot; seemed appropriate, but their
definition of 'fucker' is spot on: &quot;often used as a generalized term of
abuse&quot;

2. &quot;Profane&quot; involves some sort of reference to a god. Nothing in the quoted
article mentions profanity.

Suppose it was this t-shirt:  http://www.cafepress.com/venganza.27628941

I think it's pretty damn suggestive as well as profane. I'd buy one if I saw
it for a buck at a yard sale.

A stopover between Los Angeles and Portland? Was that a regular stop, or did
they stop just for her? Either way is disgusting.

"/> That's not exactly right. It was apparently because they were afraid somebody
WOULD complain:

&quot;A spokesman for Southwest Airlines (up $0.24 to $15.25, Research) told CNN
that the airline used the &quot;common sense&quot; approach when they decided to escort
Heasley from the plane in Reno, Nevada, during a stopover between Los Angeles
and Portland, Ore. The airline felt that the T-shirt was offensive and that
other passengers would be outraged by it, the spokeswoman said, adding that
the incident is about &quot;decency.&quot;

Other passengers? No mention of an actual complaint, so where did the 'other'
come from?

No wonder we're the laughingstock of the world when we're not downright

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We all know that &quot;freedom of speech&quot; only goes so far (as in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proverbial shouting fire in a crowded theater scenario....)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally I love the &quot;F word&quot; but I would never display it on a shirt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in front of people I don't know because I KNOW that that word can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quite offensive to many others and they have rights too, and really,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is what this is really all about..........the rights of others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be offended, not the rights of someone who has no regard for how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior affects others. We live in such a selfish, &quot;it's all about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me&quot; society that it's just sickening. Good for Southwest Airlines
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not looking the other way.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Freedom of speech does not apply to privately held entities. If she
&gt;&gt;&gt; wore that shirt to my house, I have every right to throw her ass out.
&gt;&gt;&gt; She can't sue me as a result for a 1st ammendment violation. I'm not
&gt;&gt;&gt; preventing her from exercising her rights somewhere else. The same is
&gt;&gt;&gt; true for an Airlines flight. They have the right to refuse business
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anyone so long as they are not discriminating based on protected
&gt;&gt;&gt; status.

&gt;&gt; Yes, but the airlines suck up so much government subsidy money it is
&gt;&gt; like they are public services. As such, freedom of speech does apply.
&gt;==============================

&gt;Then you have no problem having a homless street bum, getting a free ticket
&gt;to his mothers funeral and who has not showered or changed clothes in 12
&gt;months sit next to you on your next flight . It is his &quot; Free Speech &quot;
&gt;rights to smell like a rotting garbage dumpster and you have no right to
&gt;tell him he cant fly.

"/> Congratulations. You passed the simple reading test - you can now
apply for your GED.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you really think an Airline will divert a flight because of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;T-shirt?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You people crack me up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Didn't they make a special landing because somebody shat in the drinks cart?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Regarding nail clippers or a tiny eyeglass-repair kit

&gt; The Hong Kong airport took the eyeglass-repair kit (tiny screwdriver, screws,
&gt; magnifying glass) from her, promising to return it when she returned from
&gt; Taipei. They did, too. She didn't bring any nail clippers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;as dangerous is just as
&gt;&gt;&gt;dumb. Sending a little kid home, possibly in handcuffs, and suspending her
&gt;&gt;&gt;from school because she had a plastic knife to spread peanut butter on
&gt;&gt;&gt;crackers is just as dumb. Dumb people do dumb things, and if you're surprised
&gt;&gt;&gt;by that it just means you haven't been around very long.

&gt;&gt;Yes, dumb people do dumb things. TSA is on top of my &quot;dumb&quot; list, but
&gt;&gt;honestly, I'm unaware of any flight diversions for the reasons you
&gt;&gt;list. Any cites on these?

&gt; None at all. Don't you remember when some drunk climbed onto the drinks cart
&gt; and shat in it when the stewardess refused to serve him any more? Maybe a
&gt; year ago. Maybe they just duct-taped him into a seat...

&gt;&gt;&gt; she and her husband chose to leave, the paper said.

&gt;&gt; Note that she *chose* to leave, all she had to do was turn

is getting this much attention. I think this woman has picked a really

&gt;&gt; That's not true either. There are limits to everything. You have the
&gt;&gt; freedom of speech and freedom to assemble, but if you express yourself
&gt;&gt; in a manner that's not peaceful, you can be arrested and such arrests
&gt;&gt; are totally legal.

&gt; Sure. The point is that *congress* cannot make a law limiting speech, but
&gt; it
&gt; can make laws restricting actions. Sometimes the need for one overrides
&gt; the
&gt; other. SCotUS constantly paints this edge.

&gt; OTOH, the first amendment, in itself, doesn't preclude the states from
&gt; making
&gt; such laws. It *certainly* doesn't apply to individuals. Very little of
&gt; the
&gt; constitution restricts individuals (13th amendment noted).

"/> Right. Whatever the details, the restriction/limiting in this case is being
done by Southhwest Airlines, in their private property. The plaintiff will
have to prove that she was faced with a discriminatory denial of public
accommodation (on a common carrier).

1. Who is JF Mezei?

Jean-Francois Mezei is the worst netkook and megatroll to have ever
hit rec.travel.air and various other usenet newsgroups. He is also
one of the longest running trolls in usenet history.

***WARNING: JF MEZEI IS A ROGUE CANCELLER. HE FORGES THE NAME AND
E-MAIL ADDRESS OF USENET POSTERS HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH AND CANCELS
THEIR MESSAGES.***

If you participate in the same newsgroups he does, you should monitor
the control.cancel newsgroup. If you find that he has cancelled your
messages, forward a copies of them to:

a b u s e @ a s t r a w e b . c o m
a b u s e @ t e r a n e w s . c o m

See also  http://www.usenetabuse.com

2. How long has he been trolling?

For well over a decade.

3. Where does he live?

Montreal, Quebec, Canada

Jean-Francois Mezei
86 Harwood Gate
Beaconsfield, QC H9W3A3
(514) 992-0474
(514) 695-8259

His current e-mail addresses are:
j f m e z e i @ t e k s a v v y . c o m
j f m e z e i @ v a x i n a t i o n . c a

His website is  http://www.vaxination.ca  .

4. What makes him such a malicious troll?

His trolling is constant, repetitious, relentless. Once he invades
your newsgroup he will stay for decades, troll around the clock, day
in and day out, every day of the year, for years and years on end. He
does not listen to pleas to stop, he does not listen to anything
anyone tells him, he does not pay attention when the
misinformation/disinformation he posts is corrected, he just goes
right on trolling year in, year out like a little child holding his
ears closed while yelling &quot;I can't hear you, I can't hear anything you
say!&quot;

5. What does he troll about?

His favorite subjects are USA-bashing and anything to do with sex. He
hates the USA and Americans and will hijack any thread and turn it
into a USA-bashing fest. If he can't do that then he'll just start
making lewd posts.

6. What does he hate about the USA?

Everything! He is part of a larger group of Canadian trolls who have
a visceral hatred of the USA, motivated by envy mostly. The USA is a
happier, better, more successful version of their country and they
can't stand it. Some of JF's favorite troll bait is &quot;the Bush
Regime&quot;, &quot;the Cheney/Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz axis of evil&quot;, &quot;Americans are
brainwashed&quot;, &quot;Cars are evil&quot;, &quot;SUVs are evil&quot;, &quot;all Americans are
stupid&quot; etc.

7. What about his sexual trolling?

Ah, that is JF at his trolling best. No sexual topic is too bizarre.
Among his favorites are child sexuality, masturbation, women's
genitalia, sex toys, circumcision, the sex lives of Americans (of
course) ... the list is endless.

8. Circumcision???

Yes, JF trolled the circumcision newsgroups for years. He still likes
to insert circumcision into his trolling every now and then.
Apparently, JF was traumatized as a child because his parents, poor
Hungarian immigrants to Canada, left him uncircumcised when he was
born, as is the custom in most of the world. Growing up in Canada
where male infant circumcision was prevalent at the time, he was
psychologically scarred (so he claims). As soon as he could he
arranged to get himself snipped, and then joined the brigades of
circumcision proselytizers in the newsgroups advocating the joys of a
free willy. His main argument is how much better he was able to
masturbate after getting circumcised without that &quot;pesky foreskin&quot;
getting in the way of his enjoyment, and he has made it his mission in
life to spread the circumcision gospel.

9. What's his interest in child sexuality? That sounds kind of
freaky.

Well, everything having to do with Mezei *is* freaky. Among the
subjects dear to his heart are the genitals of little boys and girls,
especially little boy's foreskins (and how tight they are) and little
girls' hymens. He is also a tireless activist and advocate that
children should be taught to masturbate early on so that they don't
grow up &quot;sexually repressed like Americans&quot;.

He also counsels all parents of boys that they constantly check their
little boys' penises and foreskins frequently to ensure a good fit,
proper movement, and that they be able to masturbate with no problems.
Utopia for JF would be a world full of parents manipulating their
little boys' penises.

10. Ewww! This guy is sounding more and more disgusting by the
minute! Are you sure about all this stuff?

Yes, you can check the google archives for yourself. There's over a
decade full of Mezei trolling in there.

11. How can I find all that out, doesn't he change aliases all the
time like all trolls do?

Of course! See the appendix below for a list of many of his known
trolling aliases.

12. So where does this guy get so much time to troll, doesn't he
work?

Ha ha ha! JF hasn't worked a day in his life! He's an adult baby, a
grown man who still lives at home with mommy and sleeps all day and
trolls the newsgroups all night. In his free time when he isn't
trolling he likes to ride his bike down to Dorval Airport and race the
planes down the runway in his bike.

13. That seems strange, is he mentally ill or something?

Bingo! JF is a boy in a grown man's body. Psychologically he never
got past the age of 13 and got stuck in a world of bathroom humor
(i.e. &quot;pull my finger!&quot;) and locker room antics that he has never been
able to outgrow.

14. Speaking of locker rooms, I heard he has a sexual fetish about
them, is that true?

Yes! JF goes to the gym not to work out but to watch men in the
locker room. He loves to post about the male sexual organs he has
seen in locker rooms over the years, especially his unnatural
obsession with foreskins. He stalks the men in locker rooms trying to
measure how much foreskin they have, or how little is left if they
have been circumcised. He gets extremely excited when he spots a case
of phimosis.

15. Oh my Gawd, this guy is nuts! He should be locked up in an
insane asylum!

Yep, JF is certifiably insane. He lives in a black helicopter / tin
foil hat world where others are out to get him. The key to
understanding JF is that he sees himself as a VICTIM. To JF the world
is out to get him, especially the USA. Victimhood is what JF is all
about.

What seems to have sent him over the edge was when the Canadian rail
system was &quot;killed&quot;, in his words. He used to be a major train nut,
spotting trains, writing down their numbers and chasing them down at
the train yard like a good freak. Then he turned his attention to
aviation. Major events that made him fall head first deep into the
abyss were the bankruptcy of Canadian Airlines and their subsequent
takeover by Air Canada (whom he sees as evil). So paranoid is he that
when an Air Canada plane crashed he claimed that Air Canada employees
went lurking about in the night with buckets of white paint to cover
up the Air Canada markings. He saw that as symbolic of a cover up of
the crash investigation. He has never recovered from this.

16. Where else does he hang out, I want to avoid him!

His main haunt on usenet is comp.os.vms, a newsgroup dedicated to some
ancient, arcane, obsolete piece of vax crapware that nobody has taken
seriously for decades. JF hangs out there with other misfits and
social dropouts who share his psychological traumas, crying for the
good old vax days of yore. It's really pathetic!

17. Where else does he hang out?

can.internet.highspeed, alt.cellular.fido, and a few other geeky
computer groups. For a while after the Shuttle Columbia disaster he
invaded the sci.space groups, sci.space.shuttle in particular, and
trolled it relentlessly with the anti-American, conspiracy theory crap
he's so famous for. But they ran him off that group and he had to go
crawling back to comp.os.vms with his tail between his legs, licking
his wounds.

18. It sounds like comp.os.vms is the only group he respects and
doesn't troll.

Pretty much. For a megatroll like JF it's impossible not to troll, so
he slips in troll bait every now and then, but by and large he
respects comp.os.vms, and, more importantly, he tries to hide his
trolling activities from them so they won't find out what a major
netkook he is.

19. Wow, sounds like he should be exposed so they will know what kind
of psycho he is!

Exactly. Feel free to post all his trolls to comp.os.vms. And while
you're at it post them to can.internet.highspeed and alt.cellular.fido
too. And to alt.usenet.kooks, a group for the likes of JF, and
news.admin.net-abuse.usenet.

20. What else can I do? Is there an abuse address?

Yes, you should send complaints along with copies of his troll posts
to:

authorities to cover it up, turn it inside out, or leave. Now, it may
be something a person would like to argue, but, you're not going to get
a ruling that says it's okay to wear a t-shirt that says &quot;Fuck&quot;.

The fact that the woman's shirt had pictures of the Bush administration
or whatever, is a red herring. It's not okay according to the airline
to wear a shirt that says &quot;Fuck&quot; in their terminal or on their planes
-- and most reasonable people in society would take their side of the
argument; even liberals like me.

&gt; I thought it just said &quot;Fockers&quot; at first too, so I thought it was

&gt; But after re-reading the article, I realized that the article was very
&gt; misleading. It made it sound like the t-shirt just read &quot;Fockers&quot; and
&gt; that the passenger was booted because the t-shirt was anti-Bush.

&gt; However, if you read the article carefully, they wrote, &quot;a phrase
&gt; similar to the popular film title Meet the Fockers&quot; and the picture of
&gt; the shirt was censored. Southwest booted her because of the obscenity
&gt; on her shirt, which I think is reasonable. She was in a public place

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Southwest boots woman for shirt

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lorrie Heasley to sue for being asked to leave a flight because of
her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; politically charged T-shirt.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; October 6, 2005

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Southwest Airlines kicked a woman off one of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; its flights over a political message on her T-shirt, the airline
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confirmed Thursday, and published reports say the passenger will sue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lorrie Heasley, of Woodland, Wash., was asked to leave her flight
from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., Tuesday for wearing a T-shirt with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pictures of President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of State Condoleezza Rice and a phrase similar to the popular film
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; title &quot;Meet the Fockers.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A spokesman for Southwest Airlines (up $0.24 to $15.25, Research)
told
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CNN that the airline used the &quot;common sense&quot; approach when they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decided to escort Heasley from the plane in Reno, Nevada, during a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stopover between Los Angeles and Portland, Ore.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The airline felt that the T-shirt was offensive and that other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; passengers would be outraged by it, the spokeswoman said, adding that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the incident is about &quot;decency.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I have cousins in Iraq and other relatives going to war,&quot; Heasley
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; told the Reno Gazette-Journal. &quot;Here we are trying to free another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country and I have to get off an airplane in midflight over a
T-shirt.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's not freedom.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; According to the airline spokeswoman, Heasley was asked to leave
after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she refused to cover up her T-shirt, an account that conflicts with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Heasley's version in the Gazette-Journal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Heasley told the newspaper that she agreed to cover her shirt with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sweatshirt, but it slipped as she slept. After she was ordered to
wear
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her T-shirt inside-out or leave, she and her husband chose to leave,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the paper said.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The 32-year-old lumber saleswoman said in the report that no one from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Southwest said anything about the shirt while she waited near the
gate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at Los Angeles International Airport, nor did anyone mention the
shirt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as she boarded the aircraft.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Southwest Airlines (up $0.24 to $15.25, Research) spokeswoman Marilee
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; McInnis told the Gazette-Journal that the airline's contract with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Federal Aviation Administration contains rules that say the airline
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will deny boarding to any customer whose conduct is offensive,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abusive, disorderly or violent or for clothing that is &quot;lewd,
obscene,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or patently offensive.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FAA spokesman Donn Walker told the newspaper that no federal rules
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exist on the subject.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;It's up to the airlines who they want to take and by what rules,&quot; he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was quoted as saying. &quot;The government just doesn't get into the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; business of what people wear on an aircraft.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Heasley wants Southwest to reimburse her and her husband for the last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leg of their trip and pay for her gasoline, a $68 rental car from
Avis
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and a $70 hotel bill, according to reports.

It isn't &quot;political&quot; as some of the people have tried to make out,

but as a paying passenger I would strongly object to be stuck
in a small place (Economy class in a present day aircraft)

BTW, I thought the name of the Hollywood film &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; was
already of a doubtful taste; they could have called the family by any other

advertise the film for them.

&quot;Indeed, it has apparently become illegal in Canada to advocate
traditional Christian opposition to homosexual sex. For example,
the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission ordered the Saskatoon
Star Phoenix and Hugh Owens to each pay $1,500 to each of three
gay activists as damages for publication of an advertisement,
placed by Owens, which conveyed the message that the Bible
condemns homosexual acts.

In another incident, after Toronto print-shop owner Scott Brockie
refused on religious grounds to print letterhead for a gay-activist
group, the local human-rights commission ordered him to pay the
group $5,000, print the requested material, and apologize to the
group's leaders. Brockie, who always accepted print jobs from
individual gay customers, and even did pro-bono work for a local
AIDS group, is fighting the decision on religious-freedom grounds.&quot;

&quot;Indeed, it has apparently become illegal in Canada to advocate

If you knew your history, you'd know &quot;traditional Christian
opposition to homosexual sex&quot; includes stoning to death,
burning at the stake and a long list of other atrocities and
torture. The Catholic Church even managed to turn a
blind eye to the Nazi's mass exterminations of gay people.

Not surprising, considering the Catholic Church is by far
the largest organized group of homosexuals and pedophiles
on the planet today, and has been for 1500 years.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We all know that &quot;freedom of speech&quot; only goes so far (as in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; proverbial shouting fire in a crowded theater scenario....)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally I love the &quot;F word&quot; but I would never display it on a
&gt;&gt;&gt; shirt
&gt;&gt;&gt; in front of people I don't know because I KNOW that that word can be
&gt;&gt;&gt; quite offensive to many others and they have rights too, and really,
&gt;&gt;&gt; this is what this is really all about..........the rights of others
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be offended, not the rights of someone who has no regard for how
&gt;&gt;&gt; her
&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior affects others. We live in such a selfish, &quot;it's all
&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt; me&quot; society that it's just sickening. Good for Southwest Airlines
&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; not looking the other way.

&gt;&gt; It wasn't the 'F' word.

&gt;&gt; You dumbass hillbillies don't even know the difference between
&gt;&gt; 'Fockers' and
&gt;&gt; 'Fuckers'.

&gt;&gt; Losers.

&gt; It was the F word you softheaded moron. The word on the shirt didn't
&gt; say &quot;Fockers&quot;, it said &quot;Fuckers&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with Southwest's decision, even though I also agree with
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ms. Heasley's t-shirt. The rules in this country are simple: If you
&gt;&gt;&gt; want to make a political statement, do it on public or your own
&gt;&gt;&gt; property, not on other people's private property.

&gt;&gt; Way to piss on your founding fathers.

&gt; The article said her t-shirt was /similar/ to Meet the Fockers,
&gt; which obviously meant it read 'Meet the Fuckers'. That can
&gt; easily be construed as obscene regardless of one's political
&gt; beliefs.

&quot;Indeed, it has apparently become illegal in Canada to advocate
traditional Christian opposition to homosexual sex. For example,
the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission ordered the Saskatoon
Star Phoenix and Hugh Owens to each pay $1,500 to each of three
gay activists as damages for publication of an advertisement,
placed by Owens, which conveyed the message that the Bible
condemns homosexual acts.

Like anybody reads the National Review anymore.

In another incident, after Toronto print-shop owner Scott Brockie
refused on religious grounds to print letterhead for a gay-activist
group, the local human-rights commission ordered him to pay the
group $5,000, print the requested material, and apologize to the
group's leaders. Brockie, who always accepted print jobs from
individual gay customers, and even did pro-bono work for a local
AIDS group, is fighting the decision on religious-freedom grounds.&quot;

&gt; Southwest boots woman for shirt

&gt; Lorrie Heasley to sue for being asked to leave a flight because of her
&gt; politically charged T-shirt.
&gt; October 6, 2005

&gt; NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Southwest Airlines kicked a woman off one of
&gt; its flights over a political message on her T-shirt, the airline
&gt; confirmed Thursday, and published reports say the passenger will sue.

&gt; Lorrie Heasley, of Woodland, Wash., was asked to leave her flight from
&gt; Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., Tuesday for wearing a T-shirt with
&gt; pictures of President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary
&gt; of State Condoleezza Rice and a phrase similar to the popular film
&gt; title &quot;Meet the Fockers.&quot;

&gt; A spokesman for Southwest Airlines (up $0.24 to $15.25, Research) told
&gt; CNN that the airline used the &quot;common sense&quot; approach when they
&gt; decided to escort Heasley from the plane in Reno, Nevada, during a
&gt; stopover between Los Angeles and Portland, Ore.

&gt; The airline felt that the T-shirt was offensive and that other
&gt; passengers would be outraged by it, the spokeswoman said, adding that
&gt; the incident is about &quot;decency.&quot;

&gt;&quot;I have cousins in Iraq and other relatives going to war,&quot; Heasley
&gt; told the Reno Gazette-Journal. &quot;Here we are trying to free another
&gt; country and I have to get off an airplane in midflight over a T-shirt.
&gt; That's not freedom.&quot;

&gt; According to the airline spokeswoman, Heasley was asked to leave after
&gt; she refused to cover up her T-shirt, an account that conflicts with
&gt; Heasley's version in the Gazette-Journal.

&gt; Heasley told the newspaper that she agreed to cover her shirt with a
&gt; sweatshirt, but it slipped as she slept. After she was ordered to wear
&gt; her T-shirt inside-out or leave, she and her husband chose to leave,
&gt; the paper said.

&gt; The 32-year-old lumber saleswoman said in the report that no one from
&gt; Southwest said anything about the shirt while she waited near the gate
&gt; at Los Angeles International Airport, nor did anyone mention the shirt
&gt; as she boarded the aircraft.

&gt; Southwest Airlines (up $0.24 to $15.25, Research) spokeswoman Marilee
&gt; McInnis told the Gazette-Journal that the airline's contract with the
&gt; Federal Aviation Administration contains rules that say the airline
&gt; will deny boarding to any customer whose conduct is offensive,
&gt; abusive, disorderly or violent or for clothing that is &quot;lewd, obscene,
&gt; or patently offensive.&quot;

&gt; FAA spokesman Donn Walker told the newspaper that no federal rules
&gt; exist on the subject.

&gt;&quot;It's up to the airlines who they want to take and by what rules,&quot; he
&gt; was quoted as saying. &quot;The government just doesn't get into the
&gt; business of what people wear on an aircraft.&quot;

&gt; Heasley wants Southwest to reimburse her and her husband for the last
&gt; leg of their trip and pay for her gasoline, a $68 rental car from Avis
&gt; and a $70 hotel bill, according to reports.

how do you know she's &quot;white&quot;?
what does her color have to do with it, in any event??
doesn't &quot;trashy&quot; behavior transcend a person's perceived &quot;race&quot;?

Theoretically she could claim Southwest's policy violated her

"/> I understand that. So, did they refund her fare? If they did, she has
no grounds to sue for damages. If they did not, they may find
themselves defending an embarrassing lawsuit. It's one thing to refuse
service to someone, it's another thing entirely if you charge them for a
service and then refuse.

Please note, I'm not arguing that anyone has a right to wear a shirt
that says &quot;Fuck&quot; on that airplane. But I am saying that SWA has no
right to charge people for a service that they then refuse to provide
for whatever reason. They had a good reason to refuse service, but they
have no reason to keep the fare.

I cannot find this detail in any of the reports. My guess is, when she
didn't check on the connecting flight in Reno, the fare was
automatically credited to the account under the same confirmation
number, by a system that is ignorant of the controversy. I make a dozen
SWA flights a year, and that's how their system works. I'll bet they
have a credit minus the service charges, and their Rapid Rewards points
accrued for the flight from Burbank to Reno

Story says they are suing for a car rental fee and a hotel room. I
don't believe they have a leg to stand on there. But if they are suing
for a refund for the flight they paid for and were not allowed to take,
they may have a case. They could probably take it to Claims and get a
summary judgement for the fare, especially since it would be easy to
show that the usual procedure for bumping a passenger is to credit the
account so that future travel can be purchased, even on nonrefundable
fares. And if there is some reason for them to keep the money for the
woman with the shirt, there is no such argument for the guy she was
travelling with.

I suspect that if they didn't refund the fares, they may actually have a
lawsuit they could lose. If they didn't handle it right, it's even
possible for the whole T-Shirt detail to be suppressed at the trial.
Of course, the full price fare from Reno to PDX is $116, and if you plan
even slightly ahead, it's $65. I'll bet you a dollar the computer
system credited their account automatically, that they have no case for
damages because of this, and that's what their lawyer will tell them.

The only question I have about the SWA T-Shirt story, is, was the fare
refunded, or credited to the account (normal for SWA, I do it all the
time) for the flights not taken?

I'm willing to bet that the travel credit went through automatically
when they didn't check in for the next flight. And if that's the case,
the couple has no grounds to sue, since the airline will have already
remedied the damage.

But if they *did not* refund the fare, that could be sticky. They can't
keep the fare when they bump you, and when you cancel (even a
non-refundable fare), they credit your account, and as long as you know
the confirmation number, you can use the credit for a year. If they
made an exception to their policy based on the t-shirt incident, they
might have some explaining to do for a judge -- especially since they
*also* kicked the woman's boyfriend off.

This could actually be interesting, but I'm betting it won't be, because
I am sure the system credited their account and they have a $65 credit
from teh RNO-&gt;PDX flight they didn't take.

The rules for airlines aren't any different than any other
private enterprise. E.g. if you go to a ballgame, get drunk
and start throwing things, you'll be ejected from the park,
and don't count on getting any refunds.

Once one party is in breach of a contract, it absolves the
other party from fulfilling the terms of that contract. In this
case Southwest asked the woman to follow their policy,
and she refused. As soon as she did this, the loss of her
airfare was no longer Southwest's problem.

"/> If they had refused boarding in point of origin, I agree. But leaving
her stranded in some 3rd city where she may be forced to pay for hotel
room and then make arrangements to either go back home or get to
destination is different.

Considering her attire was deemed acceptable for first leg of journey,
I'd say her attire wasn't that clear cut &quot;unacceptable&quot; and that it
depended on staff attitude/interpretation.

If during the first leg her behaviour and attire did not raise any
problems, she had no reason to believe that it would cause he to be
denied boarding on second leg.

"/> I think they do, for the simple reason that WN left them stranded in
some city that was not on their itinerary as departure or arrival city.

I am sure that in legalese, WN's contract allows them to do what they
did and strand the passenger for whatever reason they can concuct. On
the &quot;Airline&quot; TV show, they always show WN staff denying boarding to
passengers who SEEM to have had a few drinks without giving them a
breathalizr test to get a objective measurement. In fact, I think that
show is devoted to showing how WN constantly denies boarding for various reasons.

The message is quite clear in both this incident, as well as what they
constantly protray in &quot;Airline&quot;. WN does not want leasure passengers
unless they are clean cut, well dressed, shut up and never complain.
Anything else and the staff can subjectively deny you boarding and you
get 0 compensation because they are a low cost airline.

The big question is whether publicity generated by such incidents will
turn off &quot;proper&quot; customers or whether it will just turn off undesirable
customers from flying WN.

"/> There is a big difference with the baseball park analogy. When you are
ejected mid-game from the baseball park, you are put on the street at
the same spot where you entered the stadium, and your costs to go home
are the same then if you had been allowed to stay until end of game.

But leaving a pax stranded in some connecting city is quite different
since it imposes serious hardships to the passenger who must then find
alternate transportation to either go back home or reach destination.
And because WN does this litterally at last minute, last minute
alternate transportation on another airline is extremely costly.

And this isn't a case of the passenger suddently becoming unruly
midflight and requiring he/she be deboarded at the next airport.
Passenger showed up at A in the guilty attire and was allowed to board
without problem and first segment was uneventful.

One could argue that at that the first boarding point, WN accepted the
full responsability to carry her to destination assuming she did not
change attire or behaviour in flight. The refusal based on attire
should have been made at first point of boarding. Not at some
intermediate point.

This is a bit similar to the lugagge system. If you board a
New-York-Paris-Athens flight, you are given the north american &quot;2
pieces&quot; for luggage allowance to Athens. Is it fair if at Paris, they
decide your luggage is no longer 2PC and that Paris-Athens is will bases
on the european system and they'll charge you extra for your luggage or
worse, only load the suitcase that fits the european domestic standards ?

Once you you check in at New York and they accept your luggage to
Athens, you have every right to expect your luggage to make it to Athens
without any fuss about european luggage standards being different.

Once the lady checked-in in departure city and was allowed to board, the
passenger had the right to assume that her attire had passed WN's strict
clothing standards and that there wouldn't be problems later on. The
crew at the midpoint should have bitten their tongue and allowed her to
continue to destination on principle, and perhaps phoned the departure
point staff to ask them to be more vigilant of passenger clothing standards.

Frequently Asked Questions

About

Michael Voight

The &quot;mrtravel&quot; psychopath of Usenet.

[NOTE: The idiot was finally fired by Cisco in early 2005. Since then, he has
been unemployed and unable to find a job, so he's been trolling furiously.
Basically, he is now unemployable for the rest of his life.]

(Last Revised May 25, 2005)

1. Who is Michael Voight?

Michael Voight is a troll, netkook, pedophile, psychopath/sociopath who has been
trolling usenet, flooding and spamming newsgroups, and harassing posters for
decades.

2. This guy sounds dangerous! Does he post under his real name? Most trolls
and netkooks don't!

Correct. He usually posts as &quot;mrtravel&quot;, an idiotic alias he came up with to
disguise his psychopathic self. He trolled under his real name for years (he's
not the brightest bulb), until people got sick of his trolling, kooking,
flooding, and harassment, and started complaining to his ISP and his employer,
Cisco. As a result, he stopped using his real name and switched to &quot;mrtravel&quot;
and many variations thereof.

3. Why did he chose &quot;mrtravel&quot;?

Because the idiot fancies himself some sort of authority on travel. And because
his main trolling/kooking home base is rec.travel.air and, from time to time,
other travel related newsgroups.

4. Does he have other aliases? Most trolls and netkooks have lots.

Yes, he has no shortage of trolling/kooking aliases. See the appendix below for
many of them.

5. Where does he live?

Michael D. Voight
111 Bean Creek Rd, No. 118
Scotts Valley, CA 95066-4148
(831) 438-2485
m r t r a v e l @ s b c g l o b a l . n e t

[REMOVE ALL SPACES IN E-MAIL ADDRESSES]

6. Where does he work?

At Cisco Systems in Scotts Valley, CA, in their Technical Assistance Center,
doing tech support.

His work e-mail address is m v o i g h t @ c i s c o . c o m.

The e-mail address of his department is t a c @ c i s c o . c o m.

7. You mean a serious company like Cisco would hire scum like him?

Well, technically they didn't recruit him. He came as baggage when they
acquired the company he used to work for, TGV Software. His e-mail address
there used to be m v o i g h t @ t g v . c o m and you can still read some of
his early troll posts under that address at  http://groups.google.com .

8. They can't possibly be happy with this guy if he is doing all these things!
Do they know what he is up to?

Oh yeah, they know. They are investigating him and word is he will be fired
shortly.

10. If they are about to fire him, they must have a lot of dirt on him. What
else has he done?

Well, apart from spending over a decade trolling and flooding usenet newsgroups
and harassing posters and nitpicking their posts endlessly, all day long from
work, and all night long from home, he is also involved in a series of crimes.

11. Crimes too?

Yep, he's been preying on children in the pen pal and personals newsgroups for
many years. He himself has admitted that the police are investigating him for
pedophilia and for being a sexual predator.

12. That's disgusting! I hope this child molester isn't married and has
children!

That's the sad part. He's been married many times and has children all over the
place.

13. What is this loser's problem? Why has he been married so many times?

Well, if it isn't obvious already, this guy has major mental and social
problems. He fits the classical definition of a psychopath and sociopath. A
sociopath is simply a psychopath who acts in anti-social ways, usually
committing crimes against society.

This psychopath/sociopath has been in trouble with the law since he was very
young. He has publicly admitted that he grew up in a Catholic orphanage in
Philadelphia where he had major disciplinary problems, culminating in running
away several times and dropping out of high school twice. He has posted that
during his teens he was placed under the care of the courts, which ordered him
to finish high school. As soon as he finished, he tried to join the military,
but all major branches of the military rejected him, not surprisingly, except
the Marines, who as we all know, take in the dregs of society.

There he proceeded to start spreading his obviously defective seed, marrying
women and scattering children around the globe.

14. That is scary! What kind of woman would want to be with a guy like this?

Not very decent ones, as you can imagine. Mostly drifters, whores, alcoholics,
drug junkies, and other failures like him. That's why he's had to turn to
importing his women from Eastern Europe, since even the lowest of the low at
home are not interested in him.

15. Eastern Europe?

Yep, he's found a little gold mine selling green cards to women from Eastern
Europe, mostly Russia, who want to move to the U.S. These women, commonly known
as Russian mail order brides, count on losers like &quot;mrtravel&quot; who can't get
women at home, and use them as stepping stones to migrate to the U.S. Once they
get their green cards, they usually leave the guy and proceed to help their old
boyfriends, lovers, or husbands migrate from Russia to the U.S.

He has been hanging out in alt.visa.us.marriage-based for years swapping stories
and information on how to defraud the U.S. government with other criminals
involved in the same illegal immigration scams.

16. Serves him right if she leaves him! How many children does he have?

Who knows?! He won't admit to how many, only that he has several with his first
wife from his days in the Marines, who are now grown, and several younger ones
with more recent wives. He says he has a young daughter in the Los Angeles area
whom he visits almost every weekend. He has been accused of molesting her, and
the police and the appropriate agencies are investigating.

17. This guy is absolute scum, total trash! How does he get away with all of
this? And shouldn't his employer have fired him by now?

Both his employer and various law enforcement and government agencies are
investigating him. But it takes time to gather the evidence, and they must
protect themselves very well. Kooks, pedophiles, criminals, and
psychopaths/sociopaths like Michael Voight are known for bringing lots of
frivolous lawsuits and tying up the court systems for years, so they must really
be meticulous in collecting their evidence during their investigations.

18. Why does his employer tolerate him using company time and resources to
troll usenet and harass others?

Cisco Systems has a very liberal policy on employee Internet use, which
unfortunately does get abused from time to time by psycho employees like Voight.

19. What can I do? I really don't think this guy should be allowed to troll
and flood usenet newsgroups and harass others, much less on company time! How
can I help stop this?

You can contact his ISP and his employer. Contact his ISP by e-mailing a b u s
e @ p r o d i g y . n e t and a b u s e @ s b c g l o b a l . n e t.

See the appendix below for Information on contacting his employer.

20. Do you think his employer will do anything? Do they care?

Oh, they do care! Absolutely they care. They are watching him very closely.
All the executives know about him and are watching him like a hawk and
monitoring his computer use and collecting evidence for his termination.

That is why it is so important that people keep sending in those complaints.
The more complaints about him they receive, the fatter his termination file will
be. :-)

&gt;&gt; There is a big difference with the baseball park analogy. When you are
&gt;&gt; ejected mid-game from the baseball park, you are put on the street at
&gt;&gt; the same spot where you entered the stadium, and your costs to go home
&gt;&gt; are the same then if you had been allowed to stay until end of game.

&gt;&gt; But leaving a pax stranded in some connecting city is quite different
&gt;&gt; since it imposes serious hardships to the passenger who must then find
&gt;&gt; alternate transportation to either go back home or reach destination.
&gt;&gt; And because WN does this litterally at last minute, last minute
&gt;&gt; alternate transportation on another airline is extremely costly.

&gt;Best of luck convincing a court that it was the airline's
&gt;responsibility to take this into account. The woman could
&gt;have easily avoided this expense by simply fulfilling her end
&gt;of the contract.

"/> Self-serving. Whether she breached her contract, and if so, in such a
major way as to warrant the airline in ejecting her mid-trip IS the
question, not the answer.

It plays out this way. She sues, alleging that she paid for a ticket,
boarded, and was thrown off for no lawful excuse, and that she
suffered damages. She does not allege why they threw her off because
her position is that it's irrelevant to her complaint, and it's their
burden to show lawful excuse. That's a prima facie case against the
airline. Their move. They have to answer with an affirmative defense
to this. They will allege that -- whatever they think their defense
is. Their burden. I want to hear what it is. If it's what I've been
hearing here -- &quot;Oh, we always have the right to throw anyone off we
don't think is following our rules&quot; I think they are going to pay her
damages.

&gt;Yes that's correct. Buy a Southwest ticket, live by their rules.
&gt;If you don't want to live by their rules, choose another airline.

&gt;Simple, no?

"/> Yes, simple. A contract provision that gives one party the unilateral
right to make up additional contract provisions, e.g., &quot;rules,&quot; lacks
mutual assent and must be disregarded or at least strictly construed
against that party -- unless, of course, you know of something in the
&quot;rules&quot; about what t-shirts can say. but I'm not buying the argument
that the contract allows the airline to decide what a t-shirt must
say.

Remember that we are talking about allegedly offensive written
expression, not disruptive CONDUCT. It wasn't litter, it wasn't
noise, it wasn't physical violence. The only complaint seems to be
about it's POLITICAL CONTENT. I'm alarmed by that.

Frequently Asked Questions

About

Michael Voight

The &quot;mrtravel&quot; psychopath of Usenet.

[NOTE: The idiot was finally fired by Cisco in early 2005. Since then, he has
been unemployed and unable to find a job, so he's been trolling furiously.
Basically, he is now unemployable for the rest of his life.]

(Last Revised May 25, 2005)

1. Who is Michael Voight?

Michael Voight is a troll, netkook, pedophile, psychopath/sociopath who has been
trolling usenet, flooding and spamming newsgroups, and harassing posters for
decades.

2. This guy sounds dangerous! Does he post under his real name? Most trolls
and netkooks don't!

Correct. He usually posts as &quot;mrtravel&quot;, an idiotic alias he came up with to
disguise his psychopathic self. He trolled under his real name for years (he's
not the brightest bulb), until people got sick of his trolling, kooking,
flooding, and harassment, and started complaining to his ISP and his employer,
Cisco. As a result, he stopped using his real name and switched to &quot;mrtravel&quot;
and many variations thereof.

3. Why did he chose &quot;mrtravel&quot;?

Because the idiot fancies himself some sort of authority on travel. And because
his main trolling/kooking home base is rec.travel.air and, from time to time,
other travel related newsgroups.

4. Does he have other aliases? Most trolls and netkooks have lots.

Yes, he has no shortage of trolling/kooking aliases. See the appendix below for
many of them.

5. Where does he live?

Michael D. Voight
111 Bean Creek Rd, No. 118
Scotts Valley, CA 95066-4148
(831) 438-2485
m r t r a v e l @ s b c g l o b a l . n e t

[REMOVE ALL SPACES IN E-MAIL ADDRESSES]

6. Where does he work?

At Cisco Systems in Scotts Valley, CA, in their Technical Assistance Center,
doing tech support.

His work e-mail address is m v o i g h t @ c i s c o . c o m.

The e-mail address of his department is t a c @ c i s c o . c o m.

7. You mean a serious company like Cisco would hire scum like him?

Well, technically they didn't recruit him. He came as baggage when they
acquired the company he used to work for, TGV Software. His e-mail address
there used to be m v o i g h t @ t g v . c o m and you can still read some of
his early troll posts under that address at  http://groups.google.com .

8. They can't possibly be happy with this guy if he is doing all these things!
Do they know what he is up to?

Oh yeah, they know. They are investigating him and word is he will be fired
shortly.

10. If they are about to fire him, they must have a lot of dirt on him. What
else has he done?

Well, apart from spending over a decade trolling and flooding usenet newsgroups
and harassing posters and nitpicking their posts endlessly, all day long from
work, and all night long from home, he is also involved in a series of crimes.

11. Crimes too?

Yep, he's been preying on children in the pen pal and personals newsgroups for
many years. He himself has admitted that the police are investigating him for
pedophilia and for being a sexual predator.

12. That's disgusting! I hope this child molester isn't married and has
children!

That's the sad part. He's been married many times and has children all over the
place.

13. What is this loser's problem? Why has he been married so many times?

Well, if it isn't obvious already, this guy has major mental and social
problems. He fits the classical definition of a psychopath and sociopath. A
sociopath is simply a psychopath who acts in anti-social ways, usually
committing crimes against society.

This psychopath/sociopath has been in trouble with the law since he was very
young. He has publicly admitted that he grew up in a Catholic orphanage in
Philadelphia where he had major disciplinary problems, culminating in running
away several times and dropping out of high school twice. He has posted that
during his teens he was placed under the care of the courts, which ordered him
to finish high school. As soon as he finished, he tried to join the military,
but all major branches of the military rejected him, not surprisingly, except
the Marines, who as we all know, take in the dregs of society.

There he proceeded to start spreading his obviously defective seed, marrying
women and scattering children around the globe.

14. That is scary! What kind of woman would want to be with a guy like this?

Not very decent ones, as you can imagine. Mostly drifters, whores, alcoholics,
drug junkies, and other failures like him. That's why he's had to turn to
importing his women from Eastern Europe, since even the lowest of the low at
home are not interested in him.

15. Eastern Europe?

Yep, he's found a little gold mine selling green cards to women from Eastern
Europe, mostly Russia, who want to move to the U.S. These women, commonly known
as Russian mail order brides, count on losers like &quot;mrtravel&quot; who can't get
women at home, and use them as stepping stones to migrate to the U.S. Once they
get their green cards, they usually leave the guy and proceed to help their old
boyfriends, lovers, or husbands migrate from Russia to the U.S.

He has been hanging out in alt.visa.us.marriage-based for years swapping stories
and information on how to defraud the U.S. government with other criminals
involved in the same illegal immigration scams.

16. Serves him right if she leaves him! How many children does he have?

Who knows?! He won't admit to how many, only that he has several with his first
wife from his days in the Marines, who are now grown, and several younger ones
with more recent wives. He says he has a young daughter in the Los Angeles area
whom he visits almost every weekend. He has been accused of molesting her, and
the police and the appropriate agencies are investigating.

17. This guy is absolute scum, total trash! How does he get away with all of
this? And shouldn't his employer have fired him by now?

Both his employer and various law enforcement and government agencies are
investigating him. But it takes time to gather the evidence, and they must
protect themselves very well. Kooks, pedophiles, criminals, and
psychopaths/sociopaths like Michael Voight are known for bringing lots of
frivolous lawsuits and tying up the court systems for years, so they must really
be meticulous in collecting their evidence during their investigations.

18. Why does his employer tolerate him using company time and resources to
troll usenet and harass others?

Cisco Systems has a very liberal policy on employee Internet use, which
unfortunately does get abused from time to time by psycho employees like Voight.

19. What can I do? I really don't think this guy should be allowed to troll
and flood usenet newsgroups and harass others, much less on company time! How
can I help stop this?

You can contact his ISP and his employer. Contact his ISP by e-mailing a b u s
e @ p r o d i g y . n e t and a b u s e @ s b c g l o b a l . n e t.

See the appendix below for Information on contacting his employer.

20. Do you think his employer will do anything? Do they care?

Oh, they do care! Absolutely they care. They are watching him very closely.
All the executives know about him and are watching him like a hawk and
monitoring his computer use and collecting evidence for his termination.

That is why it is so important that people keep sending in those complaints.
The more complaints about him they receive, the fatter his termination file will
be. :-)

ticket, either the terms and contract were not honoured by the woman
in which case she doesn't have any right to a refund, or the terms of
the contract weren't honoured by WN, which means she has the right to

&gt;&gt;My surmise at this point is that Cam will file a section 995 motion to

&gt;&gt;evidence presented to the grand jury, &quot;taken together, if unexplained or
&gt;&gt;uncontradicted, provide[s] sufficient cause to believe that a public
&gt;&gt;offense was committed and the person accused is guilty of it,&quot; Cummiskey v.
&gt;&gt;Superior Ct., 839 P.2d 1059 (Cal. 1992), that's basically the end of the
&gt;&gt;ballgame. The &quot;grand jury is not required to hear evidence for the
&gt;&gt;defendant,&quot; id., so it really doesn't matter what you might have in your
&gt;&gt;quiver.

&gt; Once all the facts come out, it will become abundantly clear to everyone why
&gt; there are serious questions about Ken Smith's psychological fitness to
&gt; practise law. And also why it would have been a wise move on Ken's part to
&gt; have kept his mouth shut and just let things play out to see where this case
&gt; is going.

"/>  Sorry, Ted, but that tired old dog won't hunt. Remember, you are the
idiot who told us that he *had to* shut up about the case, on account of
the fact that new information would be coming out soon. But getting you
to shut up is like asking a Republican leader to praise Fahrenheit 9/11.

To not put too fine a spin on it, Ted, up to this point, you've been
all hat and no cattle. You told us that this would be &quot;a political hot
potato for Steve Cooley.&quot; You alleged that Craig Hum was prosecuting
the case to help his campaign for District Attorney, until it was found
that he wasn't even running. You claimed that they incarcerated Cam on
information because Hum &quot;knew [he] would draw a No Bill,&quot; but he got an
indictment. You claimed that when everyone from KABC to the L.A. Times
to the Torrance Daily Breeze got hold of this story, we'd &quot;REALLY&quot; see
some fireworks. Another dud. Not even a fizzle. And then, there was
your preposterous assertion that the L.A. Sheriff's office worked under
a bounty system. More dry holes than a George W. Bush-run oil drilling
operation. :)

Even Court TV had no interest.

The grand jury only has to see a few facts to reach a conclusion that
there is probable cause that Cam murdered his illegitimate four-year-old
daughter Lauren. First, all we have to do is listen to Ted Kaldis, who
admitted that &quot;NO sane parent&quot; would let a four-year-old kid out of his
or her sight while walking up a path on the edge of a cliff. (As far as
I can recall, Cam isn't invoking an insanity defense.) That, given the
probable testimony of Lauren's mother -- which we don't have access to,
but I don't think anyone needs slides! -- the reportedly contradictory
testimony given by Cam, and the simple fact that she was either thrown
or fell from one of the few spots on the trail where her death was near
certain, and for the grand jury, it was a veritable slam-dunk.

Remember, Ted, they don't have to listen to exculpatory evidence in a
grand jury hearing.

Still, the most amusing part of all this is that you are supporting
Cam at &quot;great personal and financial cost.&quot; Ted Kaldis can &quot;expect to
reap as he has sown,&quot; and his interminable effort to harass and defame
me is coming back to haunt him, in the person of Cameron Brown. Does
Patty like the big, BLACK dildo you must have gotten her to take Cam's
place? Inquiring minds want to know.

You kept telling me that I was going to &quot;eat crow,&quot; but it seems as
if you have been gorging on it yourself, and haven't been able to serve
it even once. Eight months after you proclaimed Cam's innocence, we are
no closer to hearing anything that would exonerate him of the charges
than we were when you first boasted about the impending bombshell.

All hat and no cattle, Ted.

You've accused pretty much *everyone* who disagrees with you of being
insane (e.g. Karen Gordon), wacky (e.g., jls), and any other defamatory
adjective you can find, including fellow Christians (e.g., Chas). Your
personal obsessive vendetta against me is well-known to all, as further
evidenced by the absurd assertion that my commenting on Cam's case is
somehow indicative of mental instability; don't look now, but everyone
has been commenting on the Kobe Bryant case....

In my view -- and I am NOT saying this out of malice, or to injure,
or because I don't like you [I find you hilarious, kind of like Jim
Carrey in Dumb and Dumber], or because I don't agree with you [remember
that I said that it was more likely than not that Cam would be acquitted
-- but only at the trial], or anything of that nature -- it truly
appears to me that you have some serious psychological problems. I know
that that's not what you want to hear. But do you realise what a
bizarre spectacle you present when you incessantly post your obviously
malicious messages? Unfortunately, probably not. And I *already* know
that you hate me for saying this, but please get immediate psychiatric
help.

&gt;&gt;It's the one single detail of the story that I have not

&gt;&gt;the most important element.

&gt;No it's not, you don't void the contract by refunding the cost of the
&gt;ticket, either the terms and contract were not honoured by the woman
&gt;in which case she doesn't have any right to a refund, or the terms of
&gt;the contract weren't honoured by WN, which means she has the right to
&gt;be put in the position as if it was - so WN have to pay any of her
&gt;additional costs to get to the destination.

&gt;Because it was half way through a journey and the dress was accepted
&gt;initially, I would be surprised if WN had much hope of winning.

"/> Well, that wouldn't be my contract analysis. A minor breach of a
contract, all by itself, may entitle the non breaching party to
certain rights, like the right to suspend counter-performance, and to
damages for that breach, but it does not entitle the breaching party
to end the contract., and it certainly doesn't entitle them to inflict
avoidable damages to the breaching party.

Remember that there's a tort analysis too.

&gt;The T-Shirt had the F-word printed on it. A resonable person would
&gt;comply with a reasonable request to cover it up. It's that simple, and
&gt;she won't prevail in court against that position.

"/> She may not prevail in court at the end of the day, but not for the
reasons you insist on. The short story is that she was thrown off a
flight she had bought and paid for en route.

However much I might agree with you that use of the &quot;F-word&quot; is
inherently offensive, I do not reach the conclusion that it
automatically confers rights on the persons offended by it. Something
more is needed. I haven't seen that something else articulated yet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;It seems to be okay when Cheney said &quot;Go fuck yourself&quot; to a
&gt;&gt;Democratic senator on the Senate floor.

&gt;It wasn't okay, and in case you have forgotten, it sparked a significant
&gt;outrage. But was it actionable? And if so, in what venue?

"/> Why couldn't Leahy just have him thrown off the Senate floor? I think
I know why, but you're not having it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;That was just political
&gt;&gt;humor, right? Your political bias is showing.

&gt;I wear it on my shirt sleeve; I'm a moderate Democrat, with centrist
&gt;leanings that will allow me to support a few conservative planks.
&gt;I completely reject the Bush administration, for the most part.

&gt;I think the issue was that she didn't consider it to be a reasonable
&gt;request. She thought she was right and knew what the 1st Amendment
&gt;meant. Obviously, she didn't. For the few that don't know it, the 1st
&gt;Amendment is about GOVERNMENT regulation of speech. It has nothing to do
&gt;with what an individual or corporation can do. This has NOTHING to do
&gt;with whether is a &quot;free&quot; country or not, despite arguments to the contrary.

"/> You have the right answer to the wrong question. Nobody is saying
that the Constitution forbids the airlines from contracting with their
passengers concerning the mode or manner of expression of their
religious or political views on board a plane. The question is
whether, in the absence of any specific contractual provision, use of
the &quot;F-word&quot; INHERENTLY gives the airlines the right to do what would
otherwise be wrongful, perhaps even criminal, conduct.

Frequently Asked Questions

About

Michael Voight

The &quot;mrtravel&quot; psychopath of Usenet.

[NOTE: The idiot was finally fired by Cisco in early 2005. Since then, he has
been unemployed and unable to find a job, so he's been trolling furiously.
Basically, he is now unemployable for the rest of his life.]

(Last Revised May 25, 2005)

1. Who is Michael Voight?

Michael Voight is a troll, netkook, pedophile, psychopath/sociopath who has been
trolling usenet, flooding and spamming newsgroups, and harassing posters for
decades.

2. This guy sounds dangerous! Does he post under his real name? Most trolls
and netkooks don't!

Correct. He usually posts as &quot;mrtravel&quot;, an idiotic alias he came up with to
disguise his psychopathic self. He trolled under his real name for years (he's
not the brightest bulb), until people got sick of his trolling, kooking,
flooding, and harassment, and started complaining to his ISP and his employer,
Cisco. As a result, he stopped using his real name and switched to &quot;mrtravel&quot;
and many variations thereof.

3. Why did he chose &quot;mrtravel&quot;?

Because the idiot fancies himself some sort of authority on travel. And because
his main trolling/kooking home base is rec.travel.air and, from time to time,
other travel related newsgroups.

4. Does he have other aliases? Most trolls and netkooks have lots.

Yes, he has no shortage of trolling/kooking aliases. See the appendix below for
many of them.

5. Where does he live?

Michael D. Voight
111 Bean Creek Rd, No. 118
Scotts Valley, CA 95066-4148
(831) 438-2485
m r t r a v e l @ s b c g l o b a l . n e t

[REMOVE ALL SPACES IN E-MAIL ADDRESSES]

6. Where does he work?

At Cisco Systems in Scotts Valley, CA, in their Technical Assistance Center,
doing tech support.

His work e-mail address is m v o i g h t @ c i s c o . c o m.

The e-mail address of his department is t a c @ c i s c o . c o m.

7. You mean a serious company like Cisco would hire scum like him?

Well, technically they didn't recruit him. He came as baggage when they
acquired the company he used to work for, TGV Software. His e-mail address
there used to be m v o i g h t @ t g v . c o m and you can still read some of
his early troll posts under that address at  http://groups.google.com .

8. They can't possibly be happy with this guy if he is doing all these things!
Do they know what he is up to?

Oh yeah, they know. They are investigating him and word is he will be fired
shortly.

10. If they are about to fire him, they must have a lot of dirt on him. What
else has he done?

Well, apart from spending over a decade trolling and flooding usenet newsgroups
and harassing posters and nitpicking their posts endlessly, all day long from
work, and all night long from home, he is also involved in a series of crimes.

11. Crimes too?

Yep, he's been preying on children in the pen pal and personals newsgroups for
many years. He himself has admitted that the police are investigating him for
pedophilia and for being a sexual predator.

12. That's disgusting! I hope this child molester isn't married and has
children!

That's the sad part. He's been married many times and has children all over the
place.

13. What is this loser's problem? Why has he been married so many times?

Well, if it isn't obvious already, this guy has major mental and social
problems. He fits the classical definition of a psychopath and sociopath. A
sociopath is simply a psychopath who acts in anti-social ways, usually
committing crimes against society.

This psychopath/sociopath has been in trouble with the law since he was very
young. He has publicly admitted that he grew up in a Catholic orphanage in
Philadelphia where he had major disciplinary problems, culminating in running
away several times and dropping out of high school twice. He has posted that
during his teens he was placed under the care of the courts, which ordered him
to finish high school. As soon as he finished, he tried to join the military,
but all major branches of the military rejected him, not surprisingly, except
the Marines, who as we all know, take in the dregs of society.

There he proceeded to start spreading his obviously defective seed, marrying
women and scattering children around the globe.

14. That is scary! What kind of woman would want to be with a guy like this?

Not very decent ones, as you can imagine. Mostly drifters, whores, alcoholics,
drug junkies, and other failures like him. That's why he's had to turn to
importing his women from Eastern Europe, since even the lowest of the low at
home are not interested in him.

15. Eastern Europe?

Yep, he's found a little gold mine selling green cards to women from Eastern
Europe, mostly Russia, who want to move to the U.S. These women, commonly known
as Russian mail order brides, count on losers like &quot;mrtravel&quot; who can't get
women at home, and use them as stepping stones to migrate to the U.S. Once they
get their green cards, they usually leave the guy and proceed to help their old
boyfriends, lovers, or husbands migrate from Russia to the U.S.

He has been hanging out in alt.visa.us.marriage-based for years swapping stories
and information on how to defraud the U.S. government with other criminals
involved in the same illegal immigration scams.

16. Serves him right if she leaves him! How many children does he have?

Who knows?! He won't admit to how many, only that he has several with his first
wife from his days in the Marines, who are now grown, and several younger ones
with more recent wives. He says he has a young daughter in the Los Angeles area
whom he visits almost every weekend. He has been accused of molesting her, and
the police and the appropriate agencies are investigating.

17. This guy is absolute scum, total trash! How does he get away with all of
this? And shouldn't his employer have fired him by now?

Both his employer and various law enforcement and government agencies are
investigating him. But it takes time to gather the evidence, and they must
protect themselves very well. Kooks, pedophiles, criminals, and
psychopaths/sociopaths like Michael Voight are known for bringing lots of
frivolous lawsuits and tying up the court systems for years, so they must really
be meticulous in collecting their evidence during their investigations.

18. Why does his employer tolerate him using company time and resources to
troll usenet and harass others?

Cisco Systems has a very liberal policy on employee Internet use, which
unfortunately does get abused from time to time by psycho employees like Voight.

19. What can I do? I really don't think this guy should be allowed to troll
and flood usenet newsgroups and harass others, much less on company time! How
can I help stop this?

You can contact his ISP and his employer. Contact his ISP by e-mailing a b u s
e @ p r o d i g y . n e t and a b u s e @ s b c g l o b a l . n e t.

See the appendix below for Information on contacting his employer.

20. Do you think his employer will do anything? Do they care?

Oh, they do care! Absolutely they care. They are watching him very closely.
All the executives know about him and are watching him like a hawk and
monitoring his computer use and collecting evidence for his termination.

That is why it is so important that people keep sending in those complaints.
The more complaints about him they receive, the fatter his termination file will
be. :-)

"/> I'm not going to debate an analogy. I will speak to the actual
incident.

The woman had ample chances to comply with the airline's policies.
Those policies were stated on the ticket she had in her hand before she
boarded the airplane. Obviously she thought she had a &quot;right&quot; to wear
her profanity laced shirt anywhere she wanted even though she knew it
would most likely offend many people. So her claim is simply her vain
attempt to prove she was right. She could have easily complied with the
airlines request, and then made her case for a civil rights violation
later. So regardless of whether she was right or wrong, she did have
the opportunity to complete her flight and obviously felt the need not
to do so. I'm not going to feel sorry for her because she was kicked
off the plane against her will when that's not really the situation.

"/> Here's another analogy. There are hundreds of laws on the books that go
unenforced every day, even when the police observe the violation.
However, when someone complains, the police are obligated to enforce the
law as it is written. The same situation existed here. Airlines don't
do checks to make sure every passenger is wearing non-offensive
clothing. Had no one complained, the woman probably would have made her
trip to Portland uneventfully. When someone does complain, the airlines
are obligated to enforce their own policies which do allow for a
passenger to be removed at a connecting airport. Had the airlines not
enforced their policies, they would have to face the possibility of
getting sued from one of the other passengers for being forced to be
exposed to profanity. There are some situations in which you can't
please everyone. That's why airlines have written policies to begin
with.

someone I knew came to my door with that t-shirt, I wouldn't let them in
my house. I don't think most people would. I don't expect the airlines
to behave any differently. The reality is, as long as your money is
green, I don't think the airlines really care. The problem comes in
when other people's money is just as green as yours. So from a moral
prospective, I can't fault them. From a business prospective, I can't
fault them either.

"/> It was my understsnding that Southwest had no restrictions due to Wright
when flying between 2 cities outside of Texas. Since the itinerary in
question does not pass through Texas, Wright would not apply.

Also, looking at the WN web site, when I ask for Los-Angeles-Portland, I
am given one set of fares which apply to any routing. This indicates
that it isn't a constructed far for each segment, but rather a published
fare between 2 cities irrespective of where one connects.

If the fare was between A and B (as opposed to a fare constructed of A-C
and C-B), then WN giving some discount based on C-B fare is not
appropriate. But I suspect WN's rules give it the right to do so.

In the car analogy, once they began to drain your oil, if they decide to
refuse service for whatever reason, they should not only refund what you
paid entirely, but also pay for the towing service to bring your
unusable car to another garage.

Being left stranded in Reno is the equivalent of the unusable car.
Southwest's actions forced the passenger to disburse money that would
not have been needed had WN either refused carriage totally or fulfill
its obligation to carry passenger to destination once travel began. In
essence, the end result is that Southwest caused harm to the passenger
by leaving him/her/it stranded in some random city.

Legally, I suspect WN had every legal right to do what they did in terms
of the refund policy and leaving passengers stranded in some random city
and claiming no responsability. However, just because a company writes
some rules in some obscure document nobody sees doesn't make such policy
legal.

For instance, many states/countries have warrantee/refund policies which
override written policies by some manufacturer and the manmufacturer
must abide by the local laws.

&gt;of the refund policy and leaving passengers stranded in some random city
&gt;and claiming no responsability. However, just because a company writes
&gt;some rules in some obscure document nobody sees doesn't make such policy
&gt;legal.

"/> That's a good point.

When you park your car in a garage, your receipt states that the
garage owner is not responsible for your car or the things in it.

The wording on such a receipt has not held up in court.

The gargage owner is responsible.

"/> This has much more to do with Southwest's ability to set arbirtraty
rules than freedom of expression issues.

If this t-shirt was considered suitable for use in public streets (where
there are laws against indecent exposure etc), then any restrictions
imposed by Southwest are arbritary.

What would happen if Southwest were to add a rule that it will refuse
any passenger wearing a red shirt ?

Based on many arguments made here, WN would have the right to do so.
Heck, it could decide to refuse carriage to anyone wearing underwear not
made in the USA. Or it could strike some marketing deal with Hanes and
require all its passengers to wear Hanes underwear and show the
waisteband at the time of boarding.

Where do restrictions go from being normal/expected/acceptable to
exagerated ? Do these restrictions remain strictly legal or do they
become illegal at one point ?

When a line is drawn, it should be done such that personal
interpretation does not come into play. There are attires that are
considered perfectly acceptable by some and unacceptable by others.

What happens when you have a extremely religious staff who decides that
a passenger's dress is lewd because it shows too much of the breasts
and/or legs ?

If the airline wants a dress code, so be it. But code should be strictly
defined and not open to personal interpretation.

If you are two business travelers discussing how they lost a contract
and one sayd &quot;Jesus, we're really fucked&quot;, and a diligent flight
attendant hears this conversation, would that FA then be able to use
Southwest rules and eject the passengers ?

words on the t-shirt violate the terms of the contract.

Neither you nor the airline get to decide what the passenger's
complaint is. Her prima facie case is that she bought a ticket, made
travel plans on reliance on it, boarded the plane, traveled to an
intermediate destination, and they threw her off mid-trip. The
question is whether the words on the t-shirt gave them the right to DO
THAT, not whether it's a defense to some cockamamie civil rights case
over whether she has the right to say &quot;fuck&quot; that they'd like to
defend. Now, your defense on their behalf, it seems, is that the
words on the t-shirt fall within the contractual prohibition against
&quot;lewd&quot; or &quot;obscene&quot; attire. I'd like to know what authority you have
for that besides your bare assertion. In addition, I'd like to see
what your contractual analysis is for concluding that this minor
breach of a contract justifies what is otherwise a tortious, perhaps
even criminal, act.

&quot;This thread is about two months old now. I'm just wondering. Did
this
woman ever sue?&quot;

She might have had a consultation with a lawyer, who gave her an honest
appraisal of the merits of her case going forward, which were limited,
to say the least. Didn't she accept compensation for her fare? That
would have been the extent of damages anyway!
