Any comments, and does it say something about NASA and current space
access?

Has NASA lost its way in trying to be many things, but ... From its
early days as the I remember the Civilian Space .. what was it called,
and its bylaws and reasons for being in the beginning?

Wait a minute... we're talking about a Billybob Thornton movie, for crying
out loud! It says nothing about NASA. It may be based, BASED, on a story
about an actual person, but a screen play, which is an adaptation of the
story is what we are seeing. Just as The Right Stuff said nothing about NASA
it was a book turned into a movie. I read the book, saw the movie, and
gleaned very little actual knowledge. Reading Alan Shepard's biography shows
me that The Right Stuff is a very sensationalized work.

...You have to understand what Tom Wolfe was trying to do with his
book. He wasn't writing the authoritative book about the dawn of the
Space Age, he was writing the definitive book about the *myths*
surrounding the dawn of the Space Age. The film is nothing but a
condensed film about the book about the myths, with too much of an
attempt to bogusly portray Gus as a "squirming little hatch blower".
To be honest, Tom Hanks need to do another space docu series, this

Benedict and Barbree's book was complete and utter crap, and it's one
of the rare occasions where the tv version was more accurate than the

my archives before 2000 were toasted a while back, I haven't been able

I don't get that from the movie. Just the opposite, in fact.

The movie isn't about NASA or the astronauts. It's about Real Men doing Real

No, not Moon Shot,although I have that too, it is the authorized bio. We
just moved, and it is packed away somewhere (moving, big PIA), but it was
the real thing. A very good read BTW. And I understand what you're saying
about Wolfe's book, oddly I didn't realise his real intent. I just thought
he tried a bit too hard to romantize the beggining of the program. Thanks
for the insight.

...There's really nothing wrong with romaticizing the Glory Days, so
long as you show the good and the bad and the myth in the proper
context. Wolfe came to the wrong conclusion where Gus and LB7 were
concerned, and the film's scriptwriters took the whole thing out of
the wrong context, even though they threw in one oft-missed line about
Gus not getting the White House treatment because JFK was in a Bay of
Pigshit and didn't want his Astronaut pals getting any of it on them
by association.

...However, if you *really* want to read a book that's nothing but
whining, bitching, and nothing but sour grapes from a worthless
pudnocker lacking any Stuff at all, much less the *Right* kind, read
Brian O'Leary's book. It's almost as deplorable as a certain
Challenger conspiracy book written by an ex-Lockheed janitor claiming
ot be an engineer.

I'd still love to know what caused that; I'm sure Gus didn't blow the
hatch intentionally, and the lack of a bruise on his hand shows he
didn't blow it unintentionally either while moving around in the capsule
and seeking something to grab to move himself around after landing.
When they found the capsule, they stated that the hatch opening appeared
to be deformed by impact... so my best guess is that some impact force
on touchdown led to the hatch setting itself off, in much the same way
the X-15 once started to extend its nose gear at full speed due to heat
expansion on the wire controlling it.
This really needs to be thoroughly investigated to completely clear his
name in regard to the incident, because that's a undeserved spot on his
record.

...My own theory is similar. The reentry heat and subsequent rapid
cooling caused by splashdown caused the external firing system - the
one used by the frogmen - to either contract or somehow fire. What
I've never been able to pull up was whether or not this system was
retained for the orbital Mercury versions, or if any modifications
were made after LB7. As for the hatch deformity, I wouldn't be
surprised if that happened due to impact on the bottom of some sort,
or perhaps one of those unseen giant squids got a bit turned on.

The hatch jettison control had a protective guard above it to prevent it
from being accidentally struck by the astronaut in flight.
Every one of the other Mercury astronauts who fired it after being
brought aboard the recovery vessel found the handle recoiled backwards,
causing the back of their hands to strike the guard, leaving a
distinctive bruise on the back of their hands.
No bruise means he didn't fire it.

I absolutely agree with Pat in this case, now that the spacecraft has been
recovered, there is no reason to fully investigate and fully exonerate Gus
Grissom, arguibly the finest of the fine.
The fact that Gus was picked to launch the Geminii and Apollo program shows
that Deke Slayton had complete faith in Gus' abilities. It is inconceivible
in my mind that he panicked and blew the hatch, and he or his memory deserve
to be unyoked from the myth.

Speaking as a disinterested foreigner, I would hope that you would only want
his name cleared if the facts (whatever they were) warrant it, and not

&gt;&gt; Gus Grissom was a great astronaut... but let's face it, he wasn't a

&gt;&gt; probably no finer than the rest.

Sig seperator or no, I stand behind my original statement that Gus was the
finest of the fine, while just a man, he was a great and brave explorer.
Without him, and his kind we never would've gone to space. One other thing,
Gus was religated to second fiddle between Sheppard and Glenn and he didn't
flinch. Betty may have been boo whooing all over the place, but Gus was
taking care of business. I wonder how you would have handled what Gus had to
deal with? And he couldn't hide behind a "well behaved news reader.

Pat, it's really simple.

Either we *know* Grissom was not culpable in the incident or we do
*not know* he was not culpable in the incident.

If we do know then no investigation is necessary. All we have to do
is educate any doubters.

If we do not know then the issue of Grissom's culpability is still
on the table and any investigation launched must reflect this
otherwise it is a dishonest sham which will convince no one.

I opt for the former. I think the investigations done immediately
after the incident came to the correct conclusions in the matter,
that Grissom was not culpable.

Perhaps you feel the issue hasn't been settled to your satisfaction
and that's why you want an investigation?

First off, I'd like to find out what exactly _did_ cause the hatch to
blow all on its own.
Having it happen in the water was bad enough, but imagine it blowing at
some point before reentry.
Both Shepard's and Grissom's capsules were basically pre-production
versions of the Mercury, and probably had some bugs that still needed to
be worked out in their design.
The other thing is that although we know he didn't do it, particularly
after "The Right Stuff" and "Moonshot" there's some doubt in the general
public's mind about the incident.

You've got no idea what it's like; type in a misspelled word, and it
will sometimes give you a list of around twenty possibilities to replace
it; most of which don't even start with the same letter, and in no
particular order as to which is the most common in usage.
I've got a huge vocabulary, but it pops up words I've never heard of at
times.
Its AI sucks.
The old Netscape spell check was far better. It arranged the alternate
spellings by which words are most commonly used, and that would give the
correct choice as #1 around 90% of the time.
Then it's got its other problem...it sees single words as two words at
times.
Case in point was "bruised", which it saw as "b ruised" and then  gave a
list of words to replace "ruised"
These being cruised, bruised, guised, raised, ruined.
If you don't keep an eye on it, you assume you dropped the "b" and
correct it, and end up with "bbruised"

Actually, I kind of like that part.
Most of the time when it does it, I'll just fix the spelling as I go
rather than check it at the end.
I'd like to find some rhyme or reason as to why it sometimes sees a
single word as two words though.
I get a feeling that when they do a updated version the spellcheck
program is going to get some major revisions.

...The fact that it didn't blow says to me that it wasn't heat-related
with regards to the heat blowing the charges directly. I'm convinced
to this day that the conductive salt water somehow caused a connection
to form that bypassed the plunger and set off the charges. Without
that actual hatch - ah, if only Curt had found that next to LB7 - I
suspect we'll never know for certain.

...On a side note, what's embarassing to me is that when I took all
those photos of LB7 while she was at JSC last year or so back, I plumb
forgot to pay attention and look for the deformation in the hatchway.
I probably should look at those photos and see if it's actually as
noticeable.

sorting features are disabled, but if you're too scared of trojans and
viruses to search for a crack, you simply set your system clock to the

back to normal. It only checks for the 30-day trial when it loads,
although when they released one of the 3.x betas they tried to have it

an Astronaut beating his wife would be career suicide even before it

...Not necessarily. If the findings came about due to incomplete
research and/or data relating to the findings, then such an inquiry
may be required to change a ruling according to the new data and
resultant findings.

Is it electrical though? The drawings made it look like it operates in a
mechanical manner by firing some sort of percussion cap via the plunger
that fires the primacord charges.

&gt; Any comments, and does it say something about NASA and current space
&gt; access?

It says that Hollywood thinks spaceflight is easy.  After all, if one guy
could build a rocket in his barn...

Spaceflight shouldn't be quite as hard as NASA makes it out to be.  Witness
the flip-flop NASA keeps making with respect to launching people on EELV's.
The fact is that Ares I preserves more of the shuttle "infrastructure" than
an EELV.  In this case, infrastructure is code for jobs and high costs in
general.
