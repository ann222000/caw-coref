Magic Loop or 2 needles

I was just interested.

Do you use the 4 or 5 needles, 2 circulars, or the magic loop?

I use the 2 circulars or the magic loop more than I do the 4 or 5
needles.  I prefer the Magic Loop.

I use the 2 Boye needle sets I have until I have need for a smaller
needle than I has.  If I have a heavier yarn use the Denise set for the
40" Magic Loop.  I was lucky and caught the smaller long circulars when
a local store was closing.

It took me a while to get used the the 2 circulars and the Magic Loop.
I use them both for sweater sleeves once and a while.  The author of the
Magic Loop book mentioned it, no seam. :)

Right now I am making leg warmers for Gail.  When she is up her legs get
cold setting in the wheel chair all the time, she keeps a blanket over them.

I know we have a few ladies and gents that make socks.  I wonder how
many we have?

Hugs &amp; God bless,

Five needles, or two circulars.  Magic Loop just looks like too damned
much work.

I did at first Wooly until I go used to it.

I find it easier for me than 5 needles.  My hands are slowly becoming
more numb do to the nerve disorder.  The magic loop is easier for me to
handle.

I go back and forth.  I loved Magic Loop when I first learn it and will use
it still when I'm doing a standard plain stockinette sock.  For sock
patterns that are new to me I prefer to use 4 dpns.  I have to admit that I
also like ending up with one larger ball of leftovers that you get when
knitting one sock at a time than the 2 smaller balls you get w/ 2 at a time.
Does that make me weird?!?  (I know, I know, it wouldn't be the only thing!)

If I'm working in small circles, I use 4 dpn.  I tried 5 once; they
kept folding up and falling everywhere.  Nearly all my dpn are
aluminum; all the ones I bought for myself are Boye.  If I'm working in
large circles, or flat, I'm probably using my Boye Needlemaster.
Unless it's a really narrow piece, in which case I'm probably using a
couple of dpn.

Magic Loop all the way for me too Dennis, just finished a top down roll neck
jumper for a 6 year old, using Denise Interchangeable needles and did the
sleeves using Magic Loop.  Really Magic!!  I find that using the
circulars(either 1 or 2) much easier, although I do love the look of those
yummy wooden dpns.  Same as I love the look of wooden crochet hooks, but
they slow me down something alarming!

Dennis,

A whole pile of swatches later!

There are at least 3 methods of using a knitting sheath, used with three
different kinds of knitting sheaths.

For socks, tuck the knitting sheath loosely into your waist band or belt so
that it can pivot. For socks, use shorter needles.  These days, for socks
and cuffs, my DPN are 8"  - 10" long. I think I sent you some 11", and those
will work, particularly if you are a big guy.   The right (working) needle
is moved in an almost horizontal motion to insert it into the stitch, throw
the yarn over it with your right forefinger, and use the base of your right
thumb to push the working needle horizontally to the right with the knitting
sheath acting as the fulcrum. (A knitting needle is a lever for moving
yarn.)

While not as sustainable as the vertical spring action achieved with gansey
needles, the horizontal motion using the right thumb to return the working
needle is very fast and has the same physics as a knitting pouch.

The Yorkshire "goose wing" (which you have) is one of the best knitting
sheath designs for such knitting.
Knitting sheaths tame DPN.

Saturday, I spent a few hours with lady who learned to knit in Siberia a
young girl.  She has always been very proud of how very fast she knits.  She
watched me knit for a few minutes and started muttering, "That is fast!
That is fast!!"
Remember, I came to this group a few years ago because I knit so slowly, and
wanted help knitting faster.

Also, the tighter you knit, the warmer the fabric. For serous leg warmers, I
would use a worsted weight wool knit on 5 # 1 needles. That will give you 7
or 8 spi and ~ 10 rpi, so about 30 K stitches per leg warmer. The is a lot
of knitting unless I am using my knitting sheath. With # 3 needles, it would
be some 15 K stitches per leg warmer, and they would still be very warm.
With # 8 needles and worsted yarn,  they would not be warm enough to be
worth the bother. It is better to buy machine knit and be warm, than to have
hand knit and be cold! With # 8 needles and Lopi or some other bulky yarn
they would be too warm for a centrally heated house. Because I really hate
fixing holes in knee socks, I would knit a bunch of really soft socketts,
some heavier outer socks or slippers, and the leg warmers to wear with the
short socks.

Only with a knitting sheath, can one knit fast, tight, and sustainable. If
one's hands are both the fulcrum and the effort on a knitting needle, then
there is a torque on your wrist.  Then, if you knit tight, or if you knit
enough, then you WILL end up at the doctor's office. It is the way biology
reacts to physics.

Moreover, some stitch patterns are warmer than others.  The warmest stitch
pattern I have tested so far is Lizard Lattice:

*
kkkkkkkkkkkk
kkkpppkkkppp
kkkkkkkkkkkk
kkkpppkkkppp
kkkkkkkkkkkk
kkkpppkkkppp
kkkkkkkkkkkk
kkkkkkkkkkkk
pppkkkpppkkk
kkkkkkkkkkkk
pppkkkpppkkk
kkkkkkkkkkkk
pppkkkpppkkk
kkkkkkkkkkkk*

However, it works better for dry cold than for damp cold.  Lucky you have
dry cold.

And, it is back to the salt mines for me.

Magic Loop is a method of using a very long circular needle
for a small circle by pulling out a loop of the circular between
two stitches.  When you get to that place, you have to pull out
a loop between two other stitches.  It's just a way of getting
the extra length of the long circular needle out of the way.

If you know the system for using two circulars, just imagine
that they are hitched together into one - the dangling ends
become the loop.

I also use 5 needles (4 only if I don't have a 5th needle).
I tried magic loop and didn't like it at all, but I wonder whether
it was because I had an old, stiff needle and maybe newer ones are
more flexible.  I haven't really given two circulars a serious try.
I have lots of sets of dpns and I like them for most things, though
I have used circulars for doubleknitting and for large projects
that will be carried around.

I've knit caps and mittens with DPs (5 needles, I think).  This summer I
learned to use two circs and then learned to do socks on two circs.  I
really like that method.  I used it when knitting the sleeves on my NYCO
sweater.

I'm not getting rid of my DPs.  I want to be versatile!

Thank you Tamar ,, so to quote that famous character from Molliere
according to you , i Made the Magic loop all my life and didn`t know
it ,, of course one pulls up a loop to advance in knitting on the
circulars if they aren`t full  with stitches ,,, You have to
understand that many years [and even now with certain items] , we
don`t have all the lengthes , sizes of all knitting things , we are
used to make do with what we have ,,, thus if we had one circular , it
would never have occured to us that one could get shorter or longer
ones ,,,
ps , since i wasn`t happy with having only 4 needles i usually buy 2
sets of 4. this became an advantage when knitting mittens and sleeves
at times i knit on both together,

&gt;&gt;Mirjam,

&gt;&gt;This URL will explain the &quot;Magic Loop&quot; in a video.

&gt;&gt; http://www.knittinghelp.com/knitting/advanced_techniques/

&gt;Magic Loop is a method of using a very long circular needle
&gt;for a small circle by pulling out a loop of the circular between
&gt;two stitches.  When you get to that place, you have to pull out
&gt;a loop between two other stitches.  It's just a way of getting
&gt;the extra length of the long circular needle out of the way.

&gt;If you know the system for using two circulars, just imagine

Hello Dennis and All,
I only make single socks, lose interest after one.  I knit with five
bamboo or wood DPs, will mix and match on sizes when I cannot find
enough of same size.
I, too, have neuropathies and RA, so my hands are often too stiff and
painful to manipulate small needles.
But the yarns always tempt me to try one more time, and off we go.
Another single sock is born!

It's near freezing today , but not to worry, tomorrow's low temps will
be 5 deg.Fahrenheit.
Greetings from NY State's Winter Wonderland!

&gt; Dennis,

&gt; A whole pile of swatches later!

&gt; There are at least 3 methods of using a knitting sheath, used with three
&gt; different kinds of knitting sheaths.

&gt; For socks, tuck the knitting sheath loosely into your waist band or belt so
&gt; that it can pivot. For socks, use shorter needles.  These days, for socks
&gt; and cuffs, my DPN are 8&quot;  - 10&quot; long. I think I sent you some 11&quot;, and those
&gt; will work, particularly if you are a big guy.   The right (working) needle
&gt; is moved in an almost horizontal motion to insert it into the stitch, throw
&gt; the yarn over it with your right forefinger, and use the base of your right
&gt; thumb to push the working needle horizontally to the right with the knitting
&gt; sheath acting as the fulcrum. (A knitting needle is a lever for moving
&gt; yarn.)

&gt; While not as sustainable as the vertical spring action achieved with gansey
&gt; needles, the horizontal motion using the right thumb to return the working
&gt; needle is very fast and has the same physics as a knitting pouch.

&gt; The Yorkshire &quot;goose wing&quot; (which you have) is one of the best knitting
&gt; sheath designs for such knitting.
&gt; Knitting sheaths tame DPN.

&gt; Saturday, I spent a few hours with lady who learned to knit in Siberia a
&gt; young girl.  She has always been very proud of how very fast she knits.  She
&gt; watched me knit for a few minutes and started muttering, &quot;That is fast!
&gt; That is fast!!&quot;
&gt; Remember, I came to this group a few years ago because I knit so slowly, and
&gt; wanted help knitting faster.

&gt; Also, the tighter you knit, the warmer the fabric. For serous leg warmers, I
&gt; would use a worsted weight wool knit on 5 # 1 needles. That will give you 7
&gt; or 8 spi and ~ 10 rpi, so about 30 K stitches per leg warmer. The is a lot
&gt; of knitting unless I am using my knitting sheath. With # 3 needles, it would
&gt; be some 15 K stitches per leg warmer, and they would still be very warm.
&gt; With # 8 needles and worsted yarn,  they would not be warm enough to be
&gt; worth the bother. It is better to buy machine knit and be warm, than to have
&gt; hand knit and be cold! With # 8 needles and Lopi or some other bulky yarn
&gt; they would be too warm for a centrally heated house. Because I really hate
&gt; fixing holes in knee socks, I would knit a bunch of really soft socketts,
&gt; some heavier outer socks or slippers, and the leg warmers to wear with the
&gt; short socks.

&gt; Only with a knitting sheath, can one knit fast, tight, and sustainable. If
&gt; one's hands are both the fulcrum and the effort on a knitting needle, then
&gt; there is a torque on your wrist.  Then, if you knit tight, or if you knit
&gt; enough, then you WILL end up at the doctor's office. It is the way biology
&gt; reacts to physics.

&gt; Moreover, some stitch patterns are warmer than others.  The warmest stitch
&gt; pattern I have tested so far is Lizard Lattice:

&gt; *
&gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk
&gt;   kkkpppkkkppp
&gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk
&gt;   kkkpppkkkppp
&gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk
&gt;   kkkpppkkkppp
&gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk
&gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk
&gt;   pppkkkpppkkk
&gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk
&gt;   pppkkkpppkkk
&gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk
&gt;   pppkkkpppkkk
&gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk*

&gt; However, it works better for dry cold than for damp cold.  Lucky you have
&gt; dry cold.

&gt; And, it is back to the salt mines for me.

Christine,

I agree, I love the bamboo and rosewood needles I have.  The crochet
woods slow me down also.  I am a fairly fast crocheter for a guy and
noticed the woods also.

I just made some leg warmers for Gail with the "Magic Loop", it worked
great.  I love the for sleeves in sweater and such.

Hugs &amp; God bless,
Dennis &amp; Gail

Sue,

I guess I am not so strange then. I did not think I would get this many
responses about the magic loop and so many people that use or use it and
love it.

Yes,I have neuropathies and RA also.  "My RA is so bad it shows up in my

Dennis and Wooly,

For the gansey needles,  try a heavy leather belt worn very low on the hips.
Tuck the sheath into the belt over the right buttock. Before you start
knitting, the right needle is just in front of your right arm pit, and the
tip is just below chin level. Then, push the working needle forward and you
rest your right forearm on it. Thus, the working needle is flexed 60 or 70
degrees! You push it down with your forearm and it springs back to finish
the stitch motion. This spring action is the difference between a knitting
sheath and a knitting pouch.  A leather knitting pouch will not stand up to
the force of a steel needle being flexed against it.

The needle holding the stitches is held almost vertical. You push down with
your right arm, release, and the needle springs into the stitch.  The right
hand flips yarn over the needle point (this is really all the right hand
does) then the right forearm pushes the needle down, out of the old stitch
as the right hand moves back (This also pushes stitches down the right
needle.) Then spring of the needle, lifts the knitting up, pulling the old
stitch off of the left needle. The process actually gets faster, when there
is some weight of completed fabric hanging off to your right to pull the
knitting foreword. Until then, you may need to move stitches down the right
needle with the fingers of the right hand.  The knitting speed provides the
yarn tension, and when you are going good, you must make sure that there is
loose yarn available, because the tension of pulling yarn off a ball or out
of center pull skein will stop the process. This is how you knit tight all
(day, week, month, year) without damaging your wrists,

3.25 mm steel needles (with their very high spring constant) allow very fast
knitting, but are a lot of effort.  The 2.25 mm needles that you have  are a
good compromise between speed and effort, and really fine needles require
another method to achieve good speed.

Spring action gansey needles are such a perfect knitting tool, that I try
knitting every new yarn on them, and ask myself if I can live with the
fabric. It is fast, so the standard size for my swatches now is cast-on 60
stitches and do 50 rows. The swatch on my desk right now is 9" by 10" and
weighs 54 gm. (Compare that to the 2" squares that I knit 3 years ago for my
first thermodynamic tests, and the time to knit those and these is about the
same : D ) Remember, I do not have any SPN these days, so I do my back and
forths on 2 gansey needles.  Swatches knit in the round get knit on sock
needles as previously discussed.  Mostly, I get something between 6 &amp; 10
stitches per inch, but even the lighter fabrics knit from baby and lace
weight yarns have excellent body and drape, even if they are loosely enough
knit that they are not particularly warm.   It is one of those things that
when you try it, you realize that those old timers really knew what they
were doing.

Half way through the first gansey, the needles will no longer be quite
straight, but then they seem to work harden a bit and stabilize.  Used
gansey needles are bent and ugly.  No wonder we do not see them around.

While I like the goose wing sheaths for socks and small objects, (knitting
sheaths do tame DPN)  I have moved to a Cornish Fish design that clips onto
a heavy leather belt for serious gansey knitting.  If you like, I will send
you one at no charge.  (Part of my warranty service!) If so, send me an
email.

&gt; &gt; Dennis,

&gt; &gt; A whole pile of swatches later!

&gt; &gt; There are at least 3 methods of using a knitting sheath, used with three
&gt; &gt; different kinds of knitting sheaths.

&gt; &gt; For socks, tuck the knitting sheath loosely into your waist band or belt
so
&gt; &gt; that it can pivot. For socks, use shorter needles.  These days, for
socks
&gt; &gt; and cuffs, my DPN are 8&quot;  - 10&quot; long. I think I sent you some 11&quot;, and
those
&gt; &gt; will work, particularly if you are a big guy.   The right (working)
needle
&gt; &gt; is moved in an almost horizontal motion to insert it into the stitch,
throw
&gt; &gt; the yarn over it with your right forefinger, and use the base of your
right
&gt; &gt; thumb to push the working needle horizontally to the right with the
knitting
&gt; &gt; sheath acting as the fulcrum. (A knitting needle is a lever for moving
&gt; &gt; yarn.)

&gt; &gt; While not as sustainable as the vertical spring action achieved with
gansey
&gt; &gt; needles, the horizontal motion using the right thumb to return the
working
&gt; &gt; needle is very fast and has the same physics as a knitting pouch.

&gt; &gt; The Yorkshire &quot;goose wing&quot; (which you have) is one of the best knitting
&gt; &gt; sheath designs for such knitting.
&gt; &gt; Knitting sheaths tame DPN.

&gt; &gt; Saturday, I spent a few hours with lady who learned to knit in Siberia a
&gt; &gt; young girl.  She has always been very proud of how very fast she knits.
She
&gt; &gt; watched me knit for a few minutes and started muttering, &quot;That is fast!
&gt; &gt; That is fast!!&quot;
&gt; &gt; Remember, I came to this group a few years ago because I knit so slowly,
and
&gt; &gt; wanted help knitting faster.

&gt; &gt; Also, the tighter you knit, the warmer the fabric. For serous leg
warmers, I
&gt; &gt; would use a worsted weight wool knit on 5 # 1 needles. That will give
you 7
&gt; &gt; or 8 spi and ~ 10 rpi, so about 30 K stitches per leg warmer. The is a
lot
&gt; &gt; of knitting unless I am using my knitting sheath. With # 3 needles, it
would
&gt; &gt; be some 15 K stitches per leg warmer, and they would still be very warm.
&gt; &gt; With # 8 needles and worsted yarn,  they would not be warm enough to be
&gt; &gt; worth the bother. It is better to buy machine knit and be warm, than to
have
&gt; &gt; hand knit and be cold! With # 8 needles and Lopi or some other bulky
yarn
&gt; &gt; they would be too warm for a centrally heated house. Because I really
hate
&gt; &gt; fixing holes in knee socks, I would knit a bunch of really soft
socketts,
&gt; &gt; some heavier outer socks or slippers, and the leg warmers to wear with
the
&gt; &gt; short socks.

&gt; &gt; Only with a knitting sheath, can one knit fast, tight, and sustainable.
If
&gt; &gt; one's hands are both the fulcrum and the effort on a knitting needle,
then
&gt; &gt; there is a torque on your wrist.  Then, if you knit tight, or if you
knit
&gt; &gt; enough, then you WILL end up at the doctor's office. It is the way
biology
&gt; &gt; reacts to physics.

&gt; &gt; Moreover, some stitch patterns are warmer than others.  The warmest
stitch
&gt; &gt; pattern I have tested so far is Lizard Lattice:

&gt; &gt; *
&gt; &gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk
&gt; &gt;   kkkpppkkkppp
&gt; &gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk

&gt; &gt;   pppkkkpppkkk
&gt; &gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk
&gt; &gt;   pppkkkpppkkk
&gt; &gt;   kkkkkkkkkkkk*

&gt; &gt; However, it works better for dry cold than for damp cold.  Lucky you
have
&gt; &gt; dry cold.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you use the 4 or 5 needles, 2 circulars, or the magic loop?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I use the 2 circulars or the magic loop more than I do the 4 or 5

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I use the 2 Boye needle sets I have until I have need for a smaller

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the 40&quot; Magic Loop.  I was lucky and caught the smaller long
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; circulars when a local store was closing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It took me a while to get used the the 2 circulars and the Magic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Loop. I use them both for sweater sleeves once and a while.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; author of the Magic Loop book mentioned it, no seam. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right now I am making leg warmers for Gail.  When she is up her legs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get cold setting in the wheel chair all the time, she keeps a blanket
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know we have a few ladies and gents that make socks.  I wonder how

&gt;&gt; Great Aaron,

&gt;&gt; I get the sheath out at least one day a week and test with different
&gt;&gt; yarns.  I am still learning.  I never thought of socks.

&gt;&gt; Thanks for the info on gage, I saved it.

&gt;&gt; Hugs &amp; God bless,

Aaron,

Thanks for the info on the spring action and the proper position of the
sheath and needle.  I printed out the post.  I will use it soon.  I have
a request for a wool sweater knit tight.

Most of all, it is nice to see you posting again.

Hugs &amp; God bless,
Dennis &amp; Gail

Several of you passed information on to me about European knitting sheaths
and knitting sticks.  I believe that I have thanked you all, but in case I
have not - thanks!

Two interesting virtues of those European knitting sticks were

1)  That many of them could support quite short sock needles up into a
comfortable working zone.  This made knitting socks super low effort.  They
work real well with a set of birch or bamboo or -- rosewood needles.

2 ) If you knit your socks on 5 needles, then the knitting folds up neatly
with the 4 needles forming a nice bundle. For travel, one then lays the
(fragile) needles along the knitting sheath, wraps the completed knitting
around the needles and sheath. Most of the sheaths of this style that I make
are 9 or 10 inches long and easily protect 8" needles. A few of turns of
yarn around the whole package allows it to be dropped into a knitting bag,
tool box, or glove compartment without fear of breaking a precious needle.

I have had some problems with bad needles poking through the knitting bag.
Thus, I have started making needle end protectors out of short sections of
bamboo (including the joint.)  The green bamboo works easily, but is much
harder when dry.  I cut a slot in bamboo that my knit fabric slips into so
that I can put the protectors on needles that have knitting on them. I use
these for ganseys in progress on 18" needles, but they would work for socks
and would even protect fine rosewood needles on a mule ride into the Grand
Canyon.  I hold them on the needles with a loop of cord threaded through
holes in the pieces of bamboo.  (Why not the little rubber point protectors?
Because they do not make rubbers in the size I need!)  Sadly, I have not
been able to make a good knitting sheath out of bamboo.

Yesterday, I saw the fist blooming fruit tree of the season.  That means
sheep shearing season is not far away.  Let me be the first to wish everyone
safe "Stash Enhancement Expeditions!"

&gt; Dennis and Wooly,

&gt; For the gansey needles,  try a heavy leather belt worn very low on the
hips.
&gt; Tuck the sheath into the belt over the right buttock. Before you start
&gt; knitting, the right needle is just in front of your right arm pit, and the
&gt; tip is just below chin level. Then, push the working needle forward and
you
&gt; rest your right forearm on it. Thus, the working needle is flexed 60 or 70
&gt; degrees! You push it down with your forearm and it springs back to finish
&gt; the stitch motion. This spring action is the difference between a knitting
&gt; sheath and a knitting pouch.  A leather knitting pouch will not stand up
to
&gt; the force of a steel needle being flexed against it.

&gt; The needle holding the stitches is held almost vertical. You push down
with
&gt; your right arm, release, and the needle springs into the stitch.  The
right
&gt; hand flips yarn over the needle point (this is really all the right hand
&gt; does) then the right forearm pushes the needle down, out of the old stitch
&gt; as the right hand moves back (This also pushes stitches down the right
&gt; needle.) Then spring of the needle, lifts the knitting up, pulling the old
&gt; stitch off of the left needle. The process actually gets faster, when
there
&gt; is some weight of completed fabric hanging off to your right to pull the
&gt; knitting foreword. Until then, you may need to move stitches down the
right
&gt; needle with the fingers of the right hand.  The knitting speed provides
the
&gt; yarn tension, and when you are going good, you must make sure that there
is
&gt; loose yarn available, because the tension of pulling yarn off a ball or
out
&gt; of center pull skein will stop the process. This is how you knit tight all
&gt; (day, week, month, year) without damaging your wrists,

&gt; 3.25 mm steel needles (with their very high spring constant) allow very
fast
&gt; knitting, but are a lot of effort.  The 2.25 mm needles that you have  are
a
&gt; good compromise between speed and effort, and really fine needles require
&gt; another method to achieve good speed.

&gt; Spring action gansey needles are such a perfect knitting tool, that I try
&gt; knitting every new yarn on them, and ask myself if I can live with the
&gt; fabric. It is fast, so the standard size for my swatches now is cast-on 60
&gt; stitches and do 50 rows. The swatch on my desk right now is 9&quot; by 10&quot; and
&gt; weighs 54 gm. (Compare that to the 2&quot; squares that I knit 3 years ago for
my
&gt; first thermodynamic tests, and the time to knit those and these is about
the
&gt; same : D ) Remember, I do not have any SPN these days, so I do my back and
&gt; forths on 2 gansey needles.  Swatches knit in the round get knit on sock
&gt; needles as previously discussed.  Mostly, I get something between 6 &amp; 10
&gt; stitches per inch, but even the lighter fabrics knit from baby and lace
&gt; weight yarns have excellent body and drape, even if they are loosely
enough
&gt; knit that they are not particularly warm.   It is one of those things that
&gt; when you try it, you realize that those old timers really knew what they
&gt; were doing.

&gt; Half way through the first gansey, the needles will no longer be quite
&gt; straight, but then they seem to work harden a bit and stabilize.  Used
&gt; gansey needles are bent and ugly.  No wonder we do not see them around.

&gt; While I like the goose wing sheaths for socks and small objects, (knitting
&gt; sheaths do tame DPN)  I have moved to a Cornish Fish design that clips
onto
&gt; a heavy leather belt for serious gansey knitting.  If you like, I will
send
&gt; you one at no charge.  (Part of my warranty service!) If so, send me an
&gt; email.

&gt; &gt; &gt; For socks, tuck the knitting sheath loosely into your waist band or

&gt; socks
&gt; &gt; &gt; and cuffs, my DPN are 8&quot;  - 10&quot; long. I think I sent you some 11&quot;, and
&gt; those
&gt; &gt; &gt; will work, particularly if you are a big guy.   The right (working)
&gt; needle
&gt; &gt; &gt; is moved in an almost horizontal motion to insert it into the stitch,
&gt; throw
&gt; &gt; &gt; the yarn over it with your right forefinger, and use the base of your
&gt; right
&gt; &gt; &gt; thumb to push the working needle horizontally to the right with the
&gt; knitting
&gt; &gt; &gt; sheath acting as the fulcrum. (A knitting needle is a lever for moving
&gt; &gt; &gt; yarn.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; While not as sustainable as the vertical spring action achieved with
&gt; gansey
&gt; &gt; &gt; needles, the horizontal motion using the right thumb to return the
&gt; working
&gt; &gt; &gt; needle is very fast and has the same physics as a knitting pouch.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The Yorkshire &quot;goose wing&quot; (which you have) is one of the best
knitting
&gt; &gt; &gt; sheath designs for such knitting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Knitting sheaths tame DPN.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Saturday, I spent a few hours with lady who learned to knit in Siberia
a
&gt; &gt; &gt; young girl.  She has always been very proud of how very fast she
knits.
&gt; She
&gt; &gt; &gt; watched me knit for a few minutes and started muttering, &quot;That is
fast!
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is fast!!&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, I came to this group a few years ago because I knit so
slowly,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted help knitting faster.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, the tighter you knit, the warmer the fabric. For serous leg
&gt; warmers, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; would use a worsted weight wool knit on 5 # 1 needles. That will give
&gt; you 7
&gt; &gt; &gt; or 8 spi and ~ 10 rpi, so about 30 K stitches per leg warmer. The is a
&gt; lot
&gt; &gt; &gt; of knitting unless I am using my knitting sheath. With # 3 needles, it
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; be some 15 K stitches per leg warmer, and they would still be very
warm.
&gt; &gt; &gt; With # 8 needles and worsted yarn,  they would not be warm enough to
be
&gt; &gt; &gt; worth the bother. It is better to buy machine knit and be warm, than
to
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; hand knit and be cold! With # 8 needles and Lopi or some other bulky
&gt; yarn
&gt; &gt; &gt; they would be too warm for a centrally heated house. Because I really
&gt; hate
&gt; &gt; &gt; fixing holes in knee socks, I would knit a bunch of really soft
&gt; socketts,
&gt; &gt; &gt; some heavier outer socks or slippers, and the leg warmers to wear with
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; short socks.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Only with a knitting sheath, can one knit fast, tight, and
sustainable.
&gt; If
&gt; &gt; &gt; one's hands are both the fulcrum and the effort on a knitting needle,
&gt; then
&gt; &gt; &gt; there is a torque on your wrist.  Then, if you knit tight, or if you
&gt; knit
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough, then you WILL end up at the doctor's office. It is the way
&gt; biology
&gt; &gt; &gt; reacts to physics.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, some stitch patterns are warmer than others.  The warmest

Dennis,
This morning,  I got package from London that reminded of a sock knitting
system that I developed last fall.

Then, I made a set of 5 steel 6.3" long US #1 knitting needles. I cut a
gansey needle down to 12" long and soldered a 1" length of  brass tubing
that fit the needle snugly on one end of the 12" gansey stub so as to form a
socket into which the tips of the sock needles would fit snugly. I placed
the knitting sheath behind me as for gansey knitting and inserted the piece
of gansey needle into the knitting sheath so that the brass socket was just
in front of my armpit.  Then, I inserted the sock needles into the brass
socket.  This gives the power of the vertical spring action from the gansey
knitting system and the convenience of  working with short sock needles.
This is possibly not as fast on a stitch per stitch basis as allowing the
sheath to pivot at one's side, but it is more ergonomic and it is the system
I would use if I were knitting socks on size 1 needles.

When I first made the tool, my gansey knitting technique was poor so that
the sock needles kept falling out of the brass socket, slowing me down and
causing great frustration - so I put it aside as unworkable.  Now, my
technique is much better and the sock needles do not fall out.  Now, I see!

This way of knitting socks is like old Irish Ale, very intoxicating.  I
would not give it up - not even if a Leprechaun offered me a "Magic Loop"
for it.

A while back, I bought new circular needles and I put maybe 50 hours into
learning "Magic Loop and 2 needles" techniques for socks.  Sure it worked,
but it has the same physics as DPN, so it might be a little faster or a
little easier, but it is not a life changing event like coming up eyeball to
eyeball with a Leprechaun.  Then,  I put a thousand hours into learning to
use a knitting sheath and my productivity has gone up 10 times. Knitting
sheaths do have different physics. That is like being eyeball to eyeball
with a Leprechaun.  It is nothing less than a vision of  "Old Magic"!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; many we have?

&gt; &gt;&gt; I can do on two circs, I can do on one circ too, but I end up using 5
&gt; &gt;&gt; DPN's 99 percent of the time! :D

&gt; Great Aaron,

&gt; I get the sheath out at least one day a week and test with different
&gt; yarns.  I am still learning.  I never thought of socks.

&gt; Thanks for the info on gage, I saved it.

&gt; Hugs &amp; God bless,
&gt; Dennis &amp; Gail

When I knit them, I use two circulars.  When I crochet them...  Ah, you
know!

A while back, I posted about increasing the amount of stitches for the
peasant heel on my crocheted socks.  It worked!  I used about 66% of
them (due to the nature of the pattern stitch I like to use) and it
works just fine.

Great Louise,

Nice to hear you some one was able to help you.  What a great group of
dear friends we have here.

Nice to see another knitter and crocheter.

Hugs &amp; God bless,
