UK 'needs clear space strategy'

By Paul Rincon

Science reporter, BBC News*

The UK government needs to develop a more coherent strategy on space, or
risk falling behind other countries, a House of Commons committee has
warned.

But MPs did not support calls for the creation of a UK Space Agency.

Many scientists say a space agency would give Britain more influence in
determining international space policy.

The committee also said there should be no policy block on the UK fielding
astronauts, or on developing its own rockets for launching satellites.

See how much the UK has invested in the space industry

Observers say that despite having many leading space scientists and some of
the best industry expertise, the UK remains a bit-part player on the
international stage.
In order to stay in the game and ahead of the game we now have to take some
very hard decisions, both in research terms and in commercial terms.
Phil Willis MP, Science &amp; Technology Committee chairman

Britain's lack of influence means that it misses out on lucrative contracts
to build science instruments and spacecraft, they argue.

Many scientists believe this is because individual space programmes are
overseen by several different government departments, resulting in a lack of
coherency when it comes to overall space policy.

The report by the House of Commons Science &amp; Technology Committee agrees
that there are many problems with the current situation.

The British National Space Centre (BNSC) was set up to oversee the UK's
space activities.

But the report said the BNSC lacked leadership and co-ordination. It said
that a low profile and poor resources contributed to the current problems.

Evidence to the committee suggested the worldwide perception of the BNSC was
of an organisation with &quot;no budget and therefore no power, whose
consultative nature renders it ineffectual in the promotion of UK space
interests&quot;.

Trading on past?

Phil Willis MP, the committee's chairman commented: &quot;There is no doubt that
UK space is a big success story, but there is no doubt either that we are
living on past investments.&quot;

He added: &quot;In order to stay in the game and ahead of the game we now have to
take some very hard decisions, both in research terms and in commercial
terms. First of all, we need focus.

&quot;If the European Space Agency [Esa] is to be our main vehicle, then we need
a far tougher approach to negotiations with them, and that is where the BNSC
can play such an important role.&quot;

The report stopped short of endorsing the call, from the UK's Royal Society
among others, for a full UK space agency with overall authority for British
space activities.

It opted instead to recommend strengthening the BNSC's role, a decision
which will disappoint many in the space community.

However, the committee said such an agency would not be able to shoulder the
accompanying responsibilities based on current levels of funding.

In 2005-6, the UK spent £207.61m on space, far less than the sums invested
by France, Italy and Germany during the same period.

'Comprehensive work'

George Fraser, director of the University of Leicester's Space Research
Centre, called the Science &amp; Technology Committee's report a comprehensive
and detailed work.

But he added: &quot;They have set themselves a difficulty in that they've assumed
that there won't be any large-scale increase in funding so the status quo
will be perpetuated.

&quot;The select committee might have been more minded to agree with us had there
been a budget there to make radical change, and I guess they anticipate
there won't be, so BNSC has got to be encouraged and adapted.&quot;

The committee also criticised the UK's traditional rejection of involvement
in manned spaceflight and launcher systems.

Although a member state of Esa, the UK gives no funds to the space agency's
astronaut corps.

The report recommended that the UK leave the option of such missions open,
to be considered like other proposals and judged according to the best
science.

But, ultimately, the £150m annual cost of joining astronaut programmes could
prove prohibitive.

Giving evidence to the committee, Dr David Tsiklauri from the University of
Salford argued that the absence of space vehicle launching capability had
reduced the UK's competitiveness in the global market.

Andrew Weston from the University of Warwick told the committee the UK could
reap significant economic and technological benefits from developing its own
launch capability.

The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has said it is exploring a dialogue with
industry and others on developing a low-cost launcher for small satellites.

The prospect raises the possibility of a British version of the X-Prize -
the US competition to develop the first private space vehicle.

Funds working harder

&quot;We heard plenty of evidence to say there was a sufficient supply of
launchers, either from the US, or Russia, or Europe through Ariane,&quot; Mr
Willis told BBC News.

&quot;But we then heard other evidence that getting the right launcher at the
right time was not quite as easy as had been suggested.

&quot;It may well be that in the future, we need that technology either in a
military sense or in a civil sense, which is why we have recommended that
there ought to be a closer link between the MOD and civilian space in order
to develop launcher technology if that is what we want to do.&quot;

Industry believes one of the best ways limited government funding can be
made to work harder is by backing Esa's technology &quot;seedcorn&quot; fund known as
Artes (Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems).

The programme puts money into basic research and product development.
Industry says it provides a 7:1 return, and has called for the UK
contribution to be significantly increased to £30m (approximately 44m
euros).

David Williams runs Avanti Screenmedia PLC which will soon launch the Hylas
satellite to deliver broadband internet services to rural Europe. He said
Britain and Europe needed to work smarter.

&quot;The Chinese and the Indians are overtaking us in space; they are spending
billions and we can't compete with that,&quot; he told BBC News.

&quot;What we can do is maintain a cutting edge by always being at the very
zenith of new technology. What I did with Hylas was take some government R&amp;D
money and marry it with City money and deploy it in real time. If the
government picks winners and gets technology into space quickly, we can
maintain a competitive advantage.&quot;

The Commons committee supports this view and has called on government to
review its Artes contributions.

The BNSC is currently drafting a new UK space strategy, which is due for
publication later in the year.
