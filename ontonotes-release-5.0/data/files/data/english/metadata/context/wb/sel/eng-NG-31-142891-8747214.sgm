I read recently that there exists a 2006 revised edition of the WTS book
entitled &quot;Life-How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? Is this
correct?

If so, has anyone studied it and compared it to the 1985 edition?

I'm wondering if their new book still has the same obfuscation of the facts,
sneaky tactics and outright falsehoods of their old one. Are they still
misquoting scientists? Deliberately quoting them out of context?
Misunderstanding science terminology? Deliberatley omitting relevant facts?
Presenting flawed scientific information? Are they still portaying science
in an unfair way?

In short, have they learned anything at all about science (or honesty)
between their first attempt and this latest one? If so, what have they done
to keep themselves abreast of the latest (and older) discoveries of science
and what have they changed in this book for the better? Or is it just more
of the same old crap?

Regards

What makes you think they'd stop using those tactics?  You know the GB
believes themselves above the rest of us and so can do anything in the name
of god. They self-serving GB needs to be replaced with people of good morals
and values.   It is after all a MONEY making business, not a real religion.

Yes, it does seem that they are in a bit of a pickle. The more the years
advance the more scientists find out about life and the more left in the
dark the JW's become. They are already out of touch with reality but I'm
wondering how long it will be before a sizable percentage of people in the
congs realise they have got it wrong about evolution (among other things).
Eventually I think there will come a big decision point somewhere in time.
Either the WTS will have to change it's ludicrous faith in the creation myth
and start accepting the overwhelming evidence of reality or decide to remain
in total and utter denial of the facts.

If the WTS changes it's view and teaches evolution then their detractors
will simply point and laugh at how Jehovah keeps changing his mind about
what he wants the WTS to teach the JW's. Some members might leave the org if
they suddenly adopt &quot;Satanic teachings&quot; like evolution. Others could be
thankful that the org is coming into line with the discoveries of science
and remain. Other creationist fundies might choose not to convert to JW-ism
if the WTS doesn't teach that Genesis is an actual account of the creation
of everything. On the other hand more cerebral and logical types might be
more inclined to listen to what the JW's have to say (not by much though,
evolution is only one part of the JW jigsaw). Confused neutrals will wonder
why the WTS keeps changing their minds about things (especially when they
claim to have a private channel to speak with God) They will probably stay
well away.

Or....the WTS can choose to remain stuck in the dark ages and be completely
left behind by an advancing world which gains in the knowledge of the
reality around us as the JW's flail around in the darkness of ignorance.
This might please the ultra-hardcore (and misinformed) JW. And it could
tempt some other creationists to join. But this could harm the potential for
new converts. Some JW's might also leave since the fact of evolution will
have been slowly dawning on them over the years (unless the mind control is
too effective) What person in their right mind wants to join or remain with
a religion which is not prepared to accept the findings of science? And I
mean real science not their cherry picked version. This will become more
important as time goes on and as humans learn more and more about the
natural world.

So, soon it's deciding time. They could admit that the GB isn't really
communicating with God and that they got it wrong about evolution, which
raises further questions of course (after all if they aren't communicating
with Jah and have been lying all this time then why should anybody listen to
them anymore about anything?)

Or they could claim that the GB communicates with God, keep teaching scary
pseudoscience and become frighteningly even more out of touch with reality
as we march forward into the future. That won't look good to outsiders who
are in supposed need of being saved.

As a third alternative they could still claim they are lead by Jah's holy
spirit or whatever but somehow the message about evolution just got
confused. But it's ok to teach evolution now. How they could say this one
with a straight face and get away with it I don't know, but I wouldn't put
it past them.

If they stick to their current teachings I imagine the WTS will lose a lot
of publishers over this issue eventually and struggle to find new converts
because their lunacy will become more and more clear in future years by
sticking to fairy tales while the world moves on. This issue and others will
diminish their membership to the point where the WTS is no longer making
enough money. What will happen then? It's obvious to me that if this happens
there will be a total overhaul of the org. However, if they catch up with
the rest of the world and stop living in a bubble in a last ditch effort to
remain economically viable then they will have to disregard huge chunks of
their current belief system, which will have a knock on effect on other
beliefs that they have. In the end the JW's eyes would be opened to the real
truth and the WTS will probably lose lots of members anyway while gaining
very few.

Either the WTBTS will disappear into the mists of time or they will save
themselves and cling to survival by desperately changing their teachings. In
the case of the latter it wouldn't be the first time would it?

But here is the solution for them:

If they do the following, everything I wrote earlier is not such a
formidable problem. Evolution is a big one to change, so it will have to be
done very very gradually so as not to freak out too many publishers. Years
if not decades. Just slowly accept more and more of what the real scientists
are saying and ease back on the creationist stuff. Eventually after many
moons the transition will be made, the JW's will accept anything if it comes
in bite sized chunks over a long time. As long as Jah is still the
originator of life and the guider of evolution then they could argue that he
still made the universe and everything in it, just by a different method.
Other bible &quot;truths&quot; may also eventually be called into question however
such as the Flood, etc...but that's for another day! ;) The WTS is hoping
that in 30 years from now nobody will care what the WTS used to teach. As
long as the JW's have a dream and the WTS says they can help fulfill it then
the continuation of the org is possible. I imagine that the big-wigs at HQ
are already thinking about this and are having this very conversation as I
type.

They will never realize it unless they break out of the psychological box
the WTS puts them in and seek answers on their own.   Some of them will
after reading what ex-JWs have to say.   Some slowly come to realize it on
their own. Some people are more intelligent than others.  As a group the JWs
are not in the high IQ range.

But if they do (and they know this), people will start asking what else in
the bible is myth and fable.  It opens Pandora's box and too many would have
their eyes opened and flee the WTS.  That can be costly for the Society. No

They're already doing that in a very sneaky manner by suggesting that Jah
used evolution as a tool of creation.

Basically they're starting to do that now.  There is too much evidence for

&gt;&gt; with reality as we march forward into the future. That won't look
&gt;&gt; good to outsiders who are in supposed need of being saved.

&gt;&gt; As a third alternative they could still claim they are lead by Jah's
&gt;&gt; holy spirit or whatever but somehow the message about evolution just
&gt;&gt; got confused. But it's ok to teach evolution now. How they could say
&gt;&gt; this one with a straight face and get away with it I don't know, but
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't put it past them.

&gt;&gt; If they stick to their current teachings I imagine the WTS will lose
&gt;&gt; a lot of publishers over this issue eventually and struggle to find
&gt;&gt; new converts because their lunacy will become more and more clear in
&gt;&gt; future years by sticking to fairy tales while the world moves on.
&gt;&gt; This issue and others will diminish their membership to the point
&gt;&gt; where the WTS is no longer making enough money. What will happen
&gt;&gt; then? It's obvious to me that if this happens there will be a total
&gt;&gt; overhaul of the org. However, if they catch up with the rest of the
&gt;&gt; world and stop living in a bubble in a last ditch effort to remain
&gt;&gt; economically viable then they will have to disregard huge chunks of
&gt;&gt; their current belief system, which will have a knock on effect on
&gt;&gt; other beliefs that they have. In the end the JW's eyes would be
&gt;&gt; opened to the real truth and the WTS will probably lose lots of
&gt;&gt; members anyway while gaining very few.

&gt; Someone posted an article here last year showing their membership
&gt; hasn't increased in the past few years.  At least not in the
&gt; industrialized nations.  Eventually the sect will die out.

Ummmm...I disagree.  I've seen those statistics that indicate flat or
declining membership in the industrialized nations, but take a look at the
Russellites, they're still here.  Also Mennonites,Shakers,Amish, etc.
There will always be those who find something desirable in the teachings of
JW's.

&gt;&gt; Either the WTBTS will disappear into the mists of time or they will
&gt;&gt; save themselves and cling to survival by desperately changing their
&gt;&gt; teachings. In the case of the latter it wouldn't be the first time
&gt;&gt; would it?

&gt;&gt; But here is the solution for them:

&gt;&gt; If they do the following, everything I wrote earlier is not such a
&gt;&gt; formidable problem. Evolution is a big one to change, so it will have
&gt;&gt; to be done very very gradually so as not to freak out too many
&gt;&gt; publishers.

&gt; They're already doing that in a very sneaky manner by suggesting that
&gt; Jah used evolution as a tool of creation.

&gt; Years
&gt;&gt; if not decades. Just slowly accept more and more of what the real
&gt;&gt; scientists are saying and ease back on the creationist stuff.
&gt;&gt; Eventually after many moons the transition will be made, the JW's
&gt;&gt; will accept anything if it comes in bite sized chunks over a long
&gt;&gt; time. As long as Jah is still the originator of life and the guider
&gt;&gt; of evolution then they could argue that he still made the universe
&gt;&gt; and everything in it, just by a different method.

&gt; Basically they're starting to do that now.  There is too much evidence
&gt; for evolution for the self-serving GB to keep denying it like idiots.

&gt;&gt; Other bible &quot;truths&quot; may also eventually be called into question
&gt;&gt; however such as the Flood, etc...but that's for another day! ;) The
&gt;&gt; WTS is hoping that in 30 years from now nobody will care what the WTS
&gt;&gt; used to teach. As long as the JW's have a dream and the WTS says they
&gt;&gt; can help fulfill it then the continuation of the org is possible. I
&gt;&gt; imagine that the big-wigs at HQ are already thinking about this and
&gt;&gt; are having this very conversation as I type.

&gt;&gt; I read recently that there exists a 2006 revised edition of the WTS
&gt;&gt; book entitled &quot;Life-How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?
&gt;&gt; Is this correct?

&gt;&gt; If so, has anyone studied it and compared it to the 1985 edition?

&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if their new book still has the same obfuscation of the
&gt;&gt; facts, sneaky tactics and outright falsehoods of their old one. Are
&gt;&gt; they still misquoting scientists? Deliberately quoting them out of
&gt;&gt; context? Misunderstanding science terminology? Deliberatley omitting
&gt;&gt; relevant facts? Presenting flawed scientific information? Are they
&gt;&gt; still portaying science in an unfair way?

&gt;&gt; In short, have they learned anything at all about science (or honesty)
&gt;&gt; between their first attempt and this latest one? If so, what have they
&gt;&gt; done to keep themselves abreast of the latest (and older) discoveries
&gt;&gt; of science and what have they changed in this book for the better? Or
&gt;&gt; is it just more of the same old crap?

&gt; One way to find out.  Why don't you ask the nearest JW for a copy?
">

Yes, that might be the easiest way to get a hold of one. But the local JW's
here know me and would think I'm interested again. They would try to
convince me to come back to the meetings, It's a frightening experience to
watch their eyes glaze over whilst they parrot quotes from their literature
and the bible and completely reject reality. Not to mention the fact that
when challenged they come across in an extremely rude manner. To be honest
personal contact with JW's gives me the willies these days.

Some of these sects are so small as to be all but invisible.  There is
nothing desirable in the teachings of the WTS, a sect that destroys
families, marriages and old friendships.
