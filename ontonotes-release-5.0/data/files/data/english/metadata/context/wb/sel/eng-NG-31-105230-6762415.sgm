COST : Security Breaches
Cost $90 To $305 Per Lost Record
Forrester
Research surveyed 28 companies that had some type of data breach and found it
difficult to calculate the expenses that resulted .

While
security breaches can cost a company dearly when it comes to a marred public
image and a loss in customer confidence, the actual financial costs can be
staggering.

The
average security breach can cost a company between
$90 and $305 per lost record , according to a new study from Forrester Research.
The research firm surveyed 28 companies that had some type of data breach.

"After
calculating the expenses of legal fees, call centers, lost employee
productivity, regulatory fines, stock plummets, and customer losses, it can be
dizzying, if not impossible, to come up with a true number," wrote senior
analyst Khalid Kark in the report. "Although studies may not be able to
determine the exact cost of a security breach in your organization, the loss of
sensitive data can have a crippling impact on an organization's bottom line,
especially if it is ill-equipped, and it's important to be able to make an
educated estimate of its cost."

Kark
said calculating the cost of a breach is murky territory and he did the survey
to shed some light on the costs associated with breaches, which seem to be
reported with increasing frequency.

A
recent Forrester survey found that 25% of respondents do not know, or do not
know how to determine, the cost of data security breaches. Kark said the
majority of organizations will incur a wide array of associated costs,
sometimes significant enough to even put them out of business

Kark
noted in the report that "it may seem like an impossible task to put a
dollar value to your data breach exposure, given the variance in the numbers
reported in the media," he wrote. "You will be doing a service to
your business if you are able to make reasonable assumptions about your business
and develop an estimate."

He
reported that discovery, response, and notification costs can be substantial.
He averaged them out to be about $50 per lost record. These costs generally
include outside legal fees, notification costs, increased call center costs,
marketing and PR costs, and discounted product offers. "Forrester has seen
a slight increase in this cost due to the increasing number of jurisdictions
and circumstances to which breach disclosure applies, but we estimate this cost
to be somewhere in this ballpark in the next few years," Kark added.

Lost
employee productivity also is a significant cost. When employees are diverted
from their normal duties, or contractors are hired to respond to data breaches,
the company incurs additional expenses, according to Kark, who noted that the
Ponemon Institute calculated that this cost had increased 100% in 2006, going
from $15 per record in 2005 to $30 per record in 2006.

Kark
also added that the increased public attention to security breaches is contributing
to this price increase. "Forrester surmises that the two primary reasons
for this increase have been the distractions caused by press coverage of data
disclosures and the growing number of regulations and contractual obligations
organizations must satisfy," he said. "Previously, when a company had
a data breach, a response team would fix the problem and test the mitigation,
then the company would resume normal activities. Now we have to spend time on
public relations efforts, as well as assuring both customers and auditors that
new processes are in place to guard against such breaches in the future."

The
report also noted that managers need to plan ahead for possible regulatory
fines, loss in the company's customer base, restitution fees, and additional
security and audit requirements.

LOSSES : Online Calculator
Helps Assess Financial Cost of Data Theft
Darwin
Professional Underwriters Launches Tech//404(R) Data Loss Cost Calculator
PRNewswire
10
April 2007
http://sev.prnewswire.com/banking-financial-services/20070410/NETU12210042007-1.html

FARMINGTON,
Conn. : Darwin Professional Underwriters, Inc. (Darwin), (NYSE: DR) , a leading
specialty insurance company and provider of technology liability insurance
coverage, today announced the immediate availability of an online calculator
that allows companies to estimate their financial risk from data theft.

The
Tech//404(R) Data Loss Cost Calculator provides companies, with a no- cost,
easy-to-use, interactive tool to assess the impact of a data breach or identify
theft data loss incident. Darwin analyzed data from published media reports as
well as several well-known industry resources, including the Ponemon
Institute's 2006 self-reporting security breach survey and cost analysis of
thirty-one (31) companies spanning twenty-five (25) industry segments, to
develop the tool's proprietary algorithms. The calculator can be accessed at http://www.tech-404.com/calculator.html .
Information on recently reported data losses is also available in the site's
data loss archive at http://www.tech-404.com/rss/data_loss.aspx .

"Until
now, organizations have struggled to assess the scope of their financial risk
should they be hit with a data loss incident," according to Adam Sills,
lead underwriter for Darwin's technology and information liability initiatives.
"Meanwhile, the explosion of corporate data collection and storage is
putting nearly every organization at risk.

"Major
data losses in health care, financial services, and retail industries are
reported almost weekly," said Sills, "and the financial consequences
can be severe. Affected companies can be hit with very substantial costs both
from regulatory compliance and from liability issues. We believe it's
imperative that organizations have a clear understanding of the bottom-line
impact of data theft and that's why we created the Tech//404 Data Loss Cost
Calculator. The quantification of business risk -- even a best estimate -- is
often the quickest path to building awareness for CEOs and CFOS alike."

Estimates in
Three Major Categories

Organizations
can use the Tech//404 Data Loss Cost Calculator to immediately estimate their
financial exposure in three major categories:

-- Internal investigation expenses;
-- Customer notification/crisis management expenses; and
-- Regulatory/compliance expenses

Darwin's
proprietary formula instantly calculates an average cost and a plus/minus 20%
range for such expenses as:

-- Cybercrime consulting
-- Customer notification (certified mail)
-- Crisis management consulting
-- Credit monitoring
-- State/Federal fines or fees
-- Regulatory investigation defense
-- Attorney fees

The Tech//404 Data Loss Cost Calculator also has graphical capabilities to
vividly display the impact of loss expenses by major category and individual
line items. Due to scarcity of data, however, the economic impact of potential
civil lawsuits (individual or class action) cannot currently be calculated.

Important
Information (Disclaimer) -

UNSECURE : US-IRS Fails
Security Audit, 490 Computers Missing In 3 Years alongwith Taxpayer Data
By
Sharon Gaudin ,

After
undergoing its own audit, the government has reported that the IRS lost 490
computers between 2003 and 2006, and is not adequately protecting sensitive
taxpayer information.

The
Treasury's Inspector General said in a report last month that the IRS is not
only losing hundreds of computers and storage devices, but is failing to
encrypt data and is using weak passwords.

The
audit also reported that because of the missing computers, personal information
was compromised for at least 2,359 U.S. taxpayers, but the total can't be
calculated because records don't list what information was stored on many of
the machines.

"As
a result, it is likely that sensitive data for a significant number of taxpayers
have been unnecessarily exposed to potential identity theft and/or other
fraudulent schemes," said Michael R. Phillips, deputy inspector general,
in the report. He added that he believes it is very likely that a large number
of the missing computers contain sensitive, unencrypted information.

The
IRS, which has 100,000 employees, annually handles 220 million tax returns,
which contain personal financial and identifying information, like addresses
and Social Security numbers. The agency has issued 47,000 laptops to employees.

The
report showed that it was unclear what information was on many of the missing
computers and if any of it had been encrypted. Phillips, however, said his
investigators did their own analysis of 100 laptops currently in use and 44 of
them contained unencrypted, sensitive data on taxpayers and agency employees.

According
to the report, 15 of those 44 laptop computers with unencrypted data had
security weaknesses, such as weak passwords and user names, which also could be
exploited.

"As
a result, we believe it is very likely a large number of the lost or stolen IRS
computers contained similar unencrypted data," Phillips wrote.
"Employees did not follow encryption procedures because they were either
unaware of security requirements, did so for their own convenience, or did not
know their own personal data were considered sensitive. We also found other
computer devices, such as flash drives, CDs, and DVDs, on which sensitive data
were not always encrypted."

Phillips
noted that a 2003 audit found similar problems but the IRS has not taken
corrective actions to secure critical data.

IRS
employees, according to the report, are allowed to take computers holding
taxpayer information, out of the agency's offices. A "large number"
of laptops were reported stolen from employees' vehicles and homes.

Just
as sobering, 111 of the missing computer incidents occurred inside IRS offices.

The
agency has reported losing an increasing number of computers every year since
2003.

The
report is part of the government's annual 2006 Audit Plan.

Top CONTROL : Malaysia Signals Crackdown On Bloggers

Malaysian
authorities plan to make bloggers register with the government, according to a
group that monitors bloggers' rights.

Reporters
Without Borders, which advocates for free press and free speech, said a
government minister announced the plan last week to stop the "spread of
negative or malicious content."

"While
claiming they do not intend to censor bloggers, they have warned that bloggers
are not above the law when they 'disturb peace and harmony,'" Reporters
Without Border said in a prepared statement. "This measure could
jeopardize online free expression. It could push many bloggers to opt for
anonymity or censor themselves out of fear of reprisals."

The
group said that recent statements reveal intent to "exercise improper
control over the online flow of information."

The
statements come as bloggers and journalists face an increasingly difficult
climate in Malaysia.

Two
journalists in Malaysia were harassed, insulted, threatened, and beaten during
clashes between activists and party supporters preparing for elections last
week, Reporters Without Borders reported.

Separately,
two Malaysian bloggers face libel suits over posts that challenge government
and state-controlled media. Reporters without Borders is representing the
bloggers -- Jeff Ooi and Ahiruddin Attan.

Sixty-two
cyberdissidents have been imprisoned this year, according to statistics from
the watchdog group.
