Non-Collapsable Side Mirrors

I have had to replace both side mirrors several times. It's gotten so that
when I replace one, i immediately go to ebay and buy another, knowing it
will soon be needed. Ford really screwed the pooch making the side mirrors
non-collapsable. Anyone know if after-market, collapsable side mirrors are
available? I haven't seen them.

Have to park in the street (live in Germany...very narrow lanes). Came out
yesterday morning and the driver side mirror had been knocked off,no doubt
by a driver in the night. That's pretty typical. Of course, being good, law
abiding Germans, no note was left...

Sorry to hear that. It seems that your current technique of keeping
spares--or maybe getting a different car or a different parking place--is
the only solution.

I will confess to a problem I had with my Focus shortly after buying it. I
was filling up with gas and as I walked alongside the car with it's fuel
filler door open, I brushed up against it in a way that made it want to try
to open even more than in the full open position. Well, the filler door is
all plastic so I snapped it off--the whole door! Boy, was I angry.
Amazingly, with a brass strap that I bought at a hardware store, a lot of
epoxy glue, and some tape to hold things in place as the glue dried, the
repaired door continues to hold now about four years later. Quite amazing as
the break required a sort of butt joint reattachment, not the easiest thing
to put back together for strength. I wouldn't be surprised if my repair has
given me a stronger filler door than when it was new.

Anyone else snap off a gas filler door?

It's a common Focus problem. A metal replacement is available. check out:

Strange, side mirrors on my Focus (1999) are easily collapsible
per default.

LMAO!  Are you the same bozo that bitched how badly designed the Focus is
when he mashed his mirror into his carport a couple years back?  Heh, heh

This guy (I'm assuming, it was) started posting a couple years ago on every

mirror when he should have taken note with his bad driving skills.

Hi Andy!

Thx for acknowledging. Mine are although collapsible per default,
which made me curious about the thread. The above URL
"fordpartsuk" suggests at least that it's European.

&gt; The only American Focus I've aware of with the collapsibe mirrors is
&gt; the SVT Focus.  This is through the '04 model year.  I don't know if
&gt; any of the American '05/'06 models have them or not.
">

Seems you can be glad if you get a driver seat in an US model per
default? ;-)

Anyway, looks like the OP is from Europe? Perhaps this depends on
the model?

Now I'm really curious - do the European mirrors have the heater function?
or is this a North American and specifically a Canadian design option?

I have heated seats (standard in my ZX5 and higher level packages) - the
switch is also connected to the heaters in the mirrors.  I suppose they
could have designed them with both functions but the Ford bean counters may
have said they didn't want to spend the extra pennies.

&gt;That's interesting.  On my '04 SVT Focus with the heated mirrors and
&gt;the heated leather Recaro seats (courtesy of the Euro package) it
&gt;states in the owner's manual that the heated mirrors are turned on
&gt;when you turn on the rear window defogger.  I have verified on mine
&gt;that the seat heaters have nothing to do with the mirror heaters.

I've always wondered if that was a misprint or not.  It makes sense to link
it with the defrost instead of the seat heaters - may it was a misprint in
'03?  In any case, the heated mirrors and collapsible mirrors may have been
mutually exclusive.

May be model specific, mine has them probably per default, it's
switched on together with the heating of the rear window. You can
move the mirrors electrical in addition.

Unlike the heated windscreen washer system, which is iirc turned
on automatically after outside temperature drops below 4C.

collapsed them a few times. That is the problem ;-).
