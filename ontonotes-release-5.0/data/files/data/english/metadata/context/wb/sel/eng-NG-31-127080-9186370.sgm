Your post inspired me to write this parody:

Ice cream on fruit pies and whipped cream on pumpkin
Trans fats and carbos all doughy and lumped in
Potatoes and ketchup and fried onion rings
These &quot;were&quot; a few of my favorite things

Fresh bakery cream puffs and crisp apple streudels
Cheesy lasagna with big chewy noodles
A big bag of cheese puffs and the orange fingers it brings
These were a few of my favorite things

Hot cakes and waffles with syrup that's dripping
Fried appetizers and sauces for dipping
Gorging myself on Whoppers served at Burger King
These were a few of my favorite things

When the test results come back great and Doc says &quot;Not bad!&quot;
I simply remember I no longer crave these old things
And then I just feel real glad!

Good dessert makes me hungrier (ie want more) and that lets me know it
was good :-)

Once again easy to compare the VATs of  the 2 pound diet with hunger
versus other diets without hunger.  That is the way doctors function
today, when Dr Chung was trained as a doctor and for decades before.
The fact that it has not been done by Dr, Chung means he knows it is
not true or he has ceased to function as the way he was trained and no
longer practicing medicine in the standard and acceptable way.  The
smart person should avoid medically unproven treatments.

And the thought of a medical doctor ignoring the medical scientific
way in which he was taught and is used today as it has been used for
decades and what parients expect of their DOCTOR, makes me lose my
appetite and therefore less hungry, which according to Chung, is
therefore bad that Chung does that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Jason (J666) may be too upset to have an appetite for anything even
&gt; &gt; &gt; ice cream cake from Carvel's.

&gt; &gt; Good Jupiter.

&gt; Jupiter is a dead planet.

&gt; &gt;  Did you even _look_ at Cookie Puss?

&gt; Yes.

&gt; May we, who are Jesus' brethren, continue to pray for you:

If he liked you and had &quot;infinite power&quot;, he would restore your
sanity.

Therefore, either he doesn't have infinite power, or else he hates you
and wants you to continue in your anxiety ridden state.

You equate what God will do in terms of what you expect Him to do. Enjoy
that delusion.
