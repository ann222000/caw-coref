On a slightly different subject - how is one considered a member of
&quot;Confessing Christ&quot;?  Is it just the Steering Committee?  Posting
here? Or is there something else to do?

I figured after over 5 years of posting here on and off, I'd ask!

On your topic: I'd like to suggest a way to make Confessing Christ 1)
more visible and 2) less threatening in terms of people feeling that
they need to be extremely educated/fluent in the whole breathe of
theology.  It be nice to see it become more useful as an entry point
into deeper theological discussion and further education in theology.

Thanks!

God's grace and peace,
Deb Kunkel

Dear Deb,

Thanks very much for your inquiry. I am writing you from the midst of
our steering committee meeting. We are not a formal membership
organization--we are an informal community. Have you registered on our
website? If you do, then you will receive our mailings. We have
appreciated your contributions to our email listserv. We appreciate
your concerns around the nature of the discussions. As this is an open
forum the level of discourse is determined by those who happen to
participate--sometimes I don't know what's being talked about! So
we're all learning. Thanks again for your interest and participation.

All the best,

Clifford

Dear CC

I attended  Brevard Child's memorial service  yesterday (9/25 ) at Yale Divinity School.

Leander Keck delivered a wonderful tribute to him.  He said among other things that Child's helped us to
see Scripture as more than a list of laws or even a collection of inspirational verses.
He never separated scripture from interpretation,  and he never removed it from the community of faith
that humbly shaped its telling and retelling....(whew)  I was happy to remember the
lesson of Professor Childs who challenged us to take theology seriously and to never neglect
to study and struggle with the words and Word of God in scripture and how it must shape our own
communities of faith.
my best to the Steering Community gathered in Cleveland now.
I'm sorry I'm not with you!

Thanks, Barbara!

We never did get Childs to a Craigville Colloquy, but we did get Keck.

Child's BIBLICAL THEOLOGY OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS was not among the
1,000s of books we did not bring with us on my second retirement.  He took a
lot of flak for his radical canonicalism but stuck to it, thank the Lord.

Grace and peace--
Willis

Deb Kunkel

Deb,

I want to emphasize what Cliff said on this one point. As I recall there are about 100 or so who are somewhat involved in this list serve. There are many differing gifts involved among these confessors. Richard has been led into dealing with clergy in crisis, Cliff's work has been on Barth and Kuyper, Herb has had years of pastoral experience, Rick has worked a lot on the atonement, etc. Each of these 100 participants have had various experiences and differing backgrounds that gives them depths in certain fields and weaknesses in other fields. Do not feel badly if you do not know as much as certain people do in theri fields of interests. There are obviously areas where you have expertise and we want to benefit from your gifts and experiences.

It might also be helpful to know that many of us do not read every thread but only those where we have particular interests. All of us often find that we are out of our leagues but then these times can be &quot;teaching moments&quot; where we begin to learn about a differing league. You certainly have offered much to our discussions in the past and we want to continue to hear from you. In the next weeks the Steering Committee will be sharing some new ideas that speak to some of your other concerns about having more exposure and basic teaching.

Dear Deb,  What wonderful questions that kept the Steering Committee up all
night.  We did not come up with a good answer and I would hope other members
of the committee would respond. I would suggest the following answer to
your questions  we are not a membership organization in the sense that you
sign up, get a card.  We have a list of people and I assume you must be on
the list that have a gift for joyful (Gabe and Fred and Lee and others would
insist serious) conversation.    I think that is a gift in our time which
doesn't solve problems but keeps us aware of idols and captivity to the
earthly spirits.  Confession Christ has always had a gift of memory with
special interest our founding documents, the texts in the Preamble and
Purpose of Union because we believe we are always living in a new time and
there is a tendency if you don't know where you came from you can get lost
in the new place.  If you forget who you are you might we in trouble. So we
have a gift of memory in an age when memory is seen as oppressive and
something we should cast off.  We really want to include the whole people of
God in our memory so we in conservation with a lot of brothers and sisters
who are in the church triumphant (dead)   and we keep finding new voices,
that we welcome.  We long for a deep relationship with Jesus Christ &quot;our
only comfort in life and in death&quot; and we seek to exalt him.   We are not
people who win battles but who do witness to our gifts for the love of the
UCC.  These are some of my thoughts.  If you can own these gifts and I think
you do.  If you are comfortable with being a witness (we did say we are not
the leaven in the church since that would say too much but we are
confessors, we are not our own, we belong to our blessed savior.....Heid.
#1)  then you are a confessor.  I hope others would correct me on this and
we need to work more carefully on Deb's question.  The other questions you
raised we also struggled with and I will try to share some of my thoughts.

Dear Cliff and Chris;

Thank you for your consideration of my post. Please note that the
following are purely my thoughts,suggestions and reflections.  As
those who know me would tell you, if you ask, I'm not shy about
sharing my thoughts.... even sometimes when I'm not asked I'm still
not shy about it!

It is true that this is an open forum, and that level of discourse is
determined by those who happen to participate; and it is also true
that each of us have our own gifts in certain areas (many, for
instance, on this forum have the gift of grasping and understanding
the whole breathe of the history of our eccumenical movement and how
it came to be for instance.) And if we all had the same gifts, well,
we wouldn't need to be here to learn from each other as well as hold
these matters in joyful theological discussion,

Yet isn't there also the need to provide entry points into these
joyful theological discussions?  If one is not familar with the
jargon, terminology or even the names of the people often used here,
what is posted can often look like garbely-gook.  The assumption that
I think can be safely made is that most who would regularly
participate here are those who want a level of deeper, joyful, Chirst-
centered theological discussion than that which might be available to
them either on-line or even in isolated communities where they serve.
Some of the discussions will interest people more than others, and
some will hold no interest and will be ignored. But there is also
those that I've tried to follow that would have been of interest to me
that I finally give up on - I'm not familar enough with the theology
of some of the people being referenced, the $5.00 words that permeate
each sentence and/or the reference to the events that the writers have
participated in themselves, so just end up giving up.  If I'm going to
have to spend 1 hour or more looking up these things to understand
each post, I'm probably not going to do it for I don't have the time
at this point in my schedule.

I'm wondering how many others have come here, signed up, and either
don't post or eventually give up  even lurking because of similar
feelings?  I see this forum especially as a great instrument for the
discussion of theology - but it can only be that tool if it is
accessible and usable by the majority of those who seek it out.  There
is a balance between dumbing something down or making it mush that can
easily be swallowed but doesn't give much nutrition and the use and
display of one's depth of education and knowledge that others can't
get use of it because it is to &quot;smarted up&quot; or too foreign looking to
even think it's edible.  Jesus displayed this balance often - working
with the most uneducated in his society, he still discussed and taught
about heavy theological matters without using words like &quot;vicarious
satisfaction&quot;, soteriology, immanent and economic guards, and refering
to the theology of  Henrich Heppe, Nietzche, Marcus Bucer, and/or the
Niebhur brothers all in the same paragraph. What good are such
references in a forum such as this without giving any sort of even
short explanation of what these might entail/mean to those who are not
as familar with these as the writer?  There is a way of writing that
shares the knowledge and gifts, yet also allows others to access and
reap the benefits from sharing in that knowledge and those gifts
without dumbing down or appearing elitist.  That is the balance I'm
referring to in this forum.

If the purpose of Confessing Christ is to foster joyful serious
theological discussion, then shouldn't the enviroment  be fostered
that allows the  many who seek just that the ability to enter into the
conversation, and not just watch it from the sidelines like a
professional sport where one can admire the skill but know one really
doesn't have the ability to be a part of the game at that level?   If
the purpose is to provide for those of a certain level within the
field  of theology a place where they are able to 'meet' and discuss
theological issues at that level, there is nothing wrong with that.
But that isn't the impression I've gotten over the year.  Instead I've
seen this is a place that seeks to provide for serious yet joyful
theological discussion, not only for those of a certain post-graduate
level, but for those in the wider UCC who are seeking, needing that
discussion.  What good is sharing one's gifts if others can't open it,
or like that strange wedding present that you have no clue about, open
it, stare at it with a fake smile and say &quot;Oh, how nice! Thank you!&quot;
while thinking to themselves 'what the heck is this?&quot;.  I'm not
referring to &quot;dumbing down&quot; the conversation, but instead seeking ways
to make it more accesible in terms both of entry and deepening
knowledge for those who seek out places of joyful theological
discussions.  Not all of us are near theologically diverse and deep
communities and resources such as seminary libraries, nor have we
developed a deep and wide network of colleagues with whom we can share
in such regular pursuits.

If the steering committee of  Confessing Christ is seeking ways to be
a more pervasive presence within the UCC, I would suggest that being
even more concious of providing a place where a wide range of people
with different backgrounds, gifts and education levels can enter into
joyful theological discussion is a vitally needed and potentially
denomination shaping role for them/us to take. (Checked and I am
registered on the blog so I have to include myself in this.)

God's grace and peace,
Deb K.

Deb,

Your thoughts need further thought on my part but I do have one immediate thing to say. In the past there was one such person who felt that he/she/it was out of their league in the discussion and this person wrote to me personally to ask such questions.  I at first tried to steer them another way but this person was insistent. I am not offering my services to everyone but I think people who do have this same issue might feel comfortable picking out one of the contributors to this group to ask what they believe are simple questions. It is my belief that I did help this person and I am sure that others on this list might offer themselves for such personal &quot;tutoring&quot; if asked personally. I realize that this does not solve the problem completely but I think it has helped one person.

&gt; Niebhur brothers all in the same paragraph. What good are such
&gt; references in a forum such as this without giving any sort of even
&gt; short explanation of what these might entail/mean to those who are not
&gt; as familar with these as the writer? There is a way of writing that
&gt; shares the knowledge and gifts, yet also allows others to access and
&gt; reap the benefits from sharing in that knowledge and those gifts
&gt; without dumbing down or appearing elitist. That is the balance I'm
&gt; referring to in this forum.

&gt; If the purpose of Confessing Christ is to foster joyful serious
&gt; theological discussion, then shouldn't the enviroment be fostered
&gt; that allows the many who seek just that the ability to enter into the
&gt; conversation, and not just watch it from the sidelines like a
&gt; professional sport where one can admire the skill but know one really
&gt; doesn't have the ability to be a part of the game at that level? If
&gt; the purpose is to provide for those of a certain level within the
&gt; field of theology a place where they are able to 'meet' and discuss
&gt; theological issues at that level, there is nothing wrong with that.
&gt; But that isn't the impression I've gotten over the year. Instead I've
&gt; seen this is a place that seeks to provide for serious yet joyful
&gt; theological discussion, not only for those of a certain post-graduate
&gt; level, but for those in the wider UCC who are seeking, needing that
&gt; discussion. What good is sharing one's gifts if others can't open it,
&gt; or like that strange wedding present that you have no clue about, open
&gt; it, stare at it with a fake smile and say &quot;Oh, how nice! Thank you!&quot;
&gt; while thinking to themselves 'what the heck is this?&quot;. I'm not
&gt; referring to &quot;dumbing down&quot; the conversation, but instead seeking ways
&gt; to make it more accesible in terms both of entry and deepening
&gt; knowledge for those who seek out places of joyful theological
&gt; discussions. Not all of us are near theologically diverse and deep
&gt; communities and resources such as seminary libraries, nor have we
&gt; developed a deep and wide network of colleagues with whom we can share
&gt; in such regular pursuits.

&gt; If the steering committee of Confessing Christ is seeking ways to be
&gt; a more pervasive presence within the UCC, I would suggest that being
&gt; even more concious of providing a place where a wide range of people
&gt; with different backgrounds, gifts and education levels can enter into
&gt; joyful theological discussion is a vitally needed and potentially
&gt; denomination shaping role for them/us to take. (Checked and I am

&gt; &gt; Deb,

&gt; &gt; I want to emphasize what Cliff said on this one point. As I recall there are
&gt; about 100 or so who are somewhat involved in this list serve. There are many
&gt; differing gifts involved among these confessors. Richard has been led into
&gt; dealing with clergy in crisis, Cliff's work has been on Barth and Kuyper, Herb
&gt; has had years of pastoral experience, Rick has worked a lot on the atonement,
&gt; etc. Each of these 100 participants have had various experiences and differing
&gt; backgrounds that gives them depths in certain fields and weaknesses in other
&gt; fields. Do not feel badly if you do not know as much as certain people do in
&gt; theri fields of interests. There are obviously areas where you have expertise
&gt; and we want to benefit from your gifts and experiences.

&gt; &gt; It might also be helpful to know that many of us do not read every thread but
&gt; only those where we have particular interests. All of us often find that we are
&gt; out of our leagues but then these times can be &quot;teaching moments&quot; where we begin
&gt; to learn about a differing league. You certainly have offered much to our
&gt; discussions in the past and we want to continue to hear from you. In the next
&gt; weeks the Steering Committee will be sharing some new ideas that speak to some
&gt; of your other concerns about having more exposure and basic teaching.

Deb (Cliff, Chris):

As I see it: if CC had three fora--beginner's, intermediate, advanced--you'd
like to be in intermediate.  But as it is, we can barely keep ONE forum
going.  It's difficult.  Reminds me of my mother-in-law's teaching for some
years (before marriage) in a one-room schoolhouse, eight grades
simultaneously taught!  (Chris's suggestion to you brought this analogy to
mind.)  Of course, though she was the only adult in the room, she was not
the only teacher.  The advanced helped teach the intermediates, who helped
teach the beginners.  (I do occasionally carry on side-conversations with CC
Open Forum members--at my suggestion, when I think the general membership
wouldn't be--or shouldn't be!--interested.)

A specific suggestion, Deb.  Instead of being frustrated by a post I'd like
to think more about but don't have time for at the moment, I print it &amp; slot
it in &quot;Later.&quot;

And a general comment:  I've written technical stuff for technical
journals--never in our CC Open Forum.  CCOF should not go higher than
semi-technical.  Even at that, some of the CC participants could do with a
glossary of theological terms (of which several have been on the market).
Even easier, I've been impressed with Google-Wikipedia's handling of termini
technici in theology, philosphy, etc.

Grace and peace--
Willis

Deb,

Your thoughts need further thought on my part but I do have one immediate
thing to say. In the past there was one such person who felt that he/she/it
was out of their league in the discussion and this person wrote to me
personally to ask such questions.  I at first tried to steer them another
way but this person was insistent. I am not offering my services to everyone
but I think people who do have this same issue might feel comfortable
picking out one of the contributors to this group to ask what they believe
are simple questions. It is my belief that I did help this person and I am
sure that others on this list might offer themselves for such personal
&quot;tutoring&quot; if asked personally. I realize that this does not solve the
problem completely but I think it has helped one person.

Chris Anderson

&gt; Dear Cliff and Chris;

&gt; Thank you for your consideration of my post. Please note that the
&gt; following are purely my thoughts,suggestions and reflections. As
&gt; those who know me would tell you, if you ask, I'm not shy about
&gt; sharing my thoughts.... even sometimes when I'm not asked I'm still
&gt; not shy about it!

&gt; It is true that this is an open forum, and that level of discourse is
&gt; determined by those who happen to participate; and it is also true
&gt; that each of us have our own gifts in certain areas (many, for
&gt; instance, on this forum have the gift of grasping and understanding
&gt; the whole breathe of the history of our eccumenical movement and how
&gt; it came to be for instance.) And if we all had the same gifts, well,
&gt; we wouldn't need to be here to learn from each other as well as hold
&gt; these matters in joyful theological discussion,

&gt; Yet isn 't there also the need to provide entry points into these
&gt; joyful theological discussions? If one is not familar with the
&gt; jargon, terminology or even the names of the people often used here,
&gt; what is posted can often look like garbely-gook. The assumption that
&gt; I think can be safely made is that most who would regularly
&gt; participate here are those who want a level of deeper, joyful, Chirst-
&gt; centered theological discussion than that which might be available to
&gt; them either on-line or even in isolated communities where they serve.
&gt; Some of the discussions will interest people more than others, and
&gt; some will hold no interest and will be ignored. But there is also
&gt; those that I've tried to follow that would have been of interest to me
&gt; that I finally give up on - I'm not familar enough with the theology
&gt; of some of the people being referenced, the $5.00 words that permeate
&gt; each s entence and/or the reference to the events that the writers have
&gt; participated in themselves, so just end up giving up. If I'm going to
&gt; have to spend 1 hour or more looking up these things to understand
&gt; each post, I'm probably not going to do it for I don't have the time
&gt; at this point in my schedule.

&gt; I'm wondering how many others have come here, signed up, and either
&gt; don't post or eventually give up even lurking because of similar
&gt; feelings? I see this forum especially as a great instrument for the
&gt; discussion of theology - but it can only be that tool if it is
&gt; accessible and usable by the majority of those who seek it out. There
&gt; is a balance between dumbing something down or making it mush that can
&gt; easily be swallowed but doesn't give much nutrition and the use and
&gt; display of one's depth of education and knowledge that others can't
&gt; get use of it because it is to &quot;smarted up&quot; or too foreign looking to
&gt; even think it's edible. Jesus displayed this balance often - working
&gt; with the most uneducated in his society, he still discussed and taught
&gt; about heavy theological matters without using words like &quot;vicarious
&gt; satisfaction&quot;, soteriology, immanent and economic guards, and refering
&gt; to the theology of Henrich Heppe, Nietzche, Marcus Bucer, and/or the
&gt; Niebhur brothers all in the same paragraph. What good are such

Dear Deb,  Thanks for your concerns about theological dialogue in this
forum.  I share many of your concerns and I am not sure how to address them.
I there a group lurking that would be interested in studying one of the
theological text in the Preamble?  Is there a theological question that
someone would like to suggest that we could address. Larry does this
occasionally and he get some responses?  Does reading a book help to get
everyone on the same focus?  I would appreciate any suggestions you have and
would be glad to work with you.

I hope I am wrong but I sense in our time that for many theology is not an
important aspect of our life together.  For some Christianity is something
you catch or a religious experience that is personal and private which
cannot be critically discussed.  Theology is important not just for the
clergy but for congregational life so that we understand what we do and why
we have done it. To discuss theology there has to be a honest commitment to
the discipline and one needs to know some of the language, history and
doctrines.  I think most of us including laity can learn if it is important.

I recently learned that a church signed a contract with a clergy in which he
was to receive a % of all new monies that came into the church.  The clergy
insisted on this clause and the congregation assumed it must be o.k.  What
does this do to pastoral theology, the office of preaching, the pastoral
office?  If there is no theological substance then all sorts of new role can
be forced on congregations.

I know you are committed to joyful theological conversation.  What would you
suggest?  Herb

Chris, Willis, Herb etc.

My suggestion is simple and two fold.  If another word can adequately
be used other than jargon or post-graduate level, use it!  Second, if
one is using a word that there is a good chance is not one that is
familar to those outside of a higher level of either education or
experience give at least a brief explaination or if referring to
someone's theology, expand a little on what it is meant by that, not
just Barth's theology supports ......  For instance, when I preach, if
I use jargon, I give a short definition of it the first time I use it.
(i.e - repentance,which means to turn around and walk/face God) that I
hope gives those who don't know or understand the term at least a
small piece to hang on in trying to listening to the rest of the
sermon.

I'm not suggesting a need for a separate forum or for Confessing
Christ to necessarily provide beginner educational theology fourms
(though that might be a thought if there was both time and interest).
What I'm suggesting is a greater awareness by those who post of those
who may not be at the level of education/knowledge they are.  Willis
says he hasn't written technical postings for this forum; I think what
is techncial is in the eye of the beholder, for there have been many
times I've felt that Willis and others have gone beyond semi-technical
into not only technical but a specialized technical that only an elite
few are able to parse and participate.  Putting a post aside to
consider later won't help if it is written at this specialized
level.

Why is there so little discussion or concern seemingly about
theology?  Because theology and theologians has become perceived and
promoted as a specialized field that only the relativiely few who have
special education can enter into and who are to spend time considering
these things.  It's become like brain surgery - something only the few
trained and qualified should do. Theology, as Dr. Bob Sherman taught
us, is merely the knowledge of God.  So whatever level of familarity
and understanding with the jargon of the field or the acadamia
language, all people should be engaged in the study of theology who
are in relationship with God.  Instead it is presented as something
&quot;beyond' the person in the pew, the country parson or those who do the
hands on part of ministry for it requires time/resources beyond
them.

Confessing Christ in the midst of joyfully discussing theology could
also be providing teaching moments of joyful theology, and in a way
that is befitting of the model we are given by the One we say we are
confessing.

God's grace and peace,
Deb K.

Herb:
I should have thought of that 40 years ago; perhaps I could retire.
Seriously, though, this is a concern for me also. Serious and joyful
theological conversation in the local church will only happen when
pastors push it. We make sure that it happens in our Christian formation
programs for adults. While we do some &quot;lite stuff&quot; once in a while, we
make sure that other conversations happen.

This past three weeks, I have been preaching on the UCC and its first 50
years: past, present and future and in all these sermons and in the
adult class following, have stressed things like our Preamble and &quot;what
this faith&quot; is. Church growth folks don't often like to talk abut this
kind of thing, because it is &quot;over the people's heads&quot;, whatever that
means. I have never believed that you talk down to people or don't
engage them in conversation about the core of our faith.

This is an excellent suggestion on one level. Yet there are some problems. The first is that some of those involved in this meeting are scholars and might have difficulty changing their vocabulary on certain issues because they do not have the gift of simplicity. Secondly, words are important. Nuances, historical uses, uses by theological schools make certain words very powerful. It is not always easy to change these without losing much of their meaning.
I recommend that every one in this meeting purchase either:
1) POCKET DICTIONARY OF THEOLOGICAL TERMS by Stanley Grenz on IVP
or
2) A HANDBOOK OF THEOLOGICAL TERMS by Van Harvey on Collier Books.
Keep these volumes near one's computer and force yourself to look up the various words.
Second, if

This is again a good point. We should try to do this but it is also time consuming for those who see something they want to respond to but are quickly on their way to teach a class etc.
There are also times when two confessors are in the midst of a heated debate and many of the rest of us are in reality mere spectators. I guess I would stick to their First Amendment rights to debate or discuss in the manner that they feel most effective. Because of this point I assume that there will always be times when certain aspects of the conversation go over many of our heads. My defense of this would be that children learn the language when adults speak to them as adults. This venue therefore gives many of us who are pastors or interested lay people the opportunity to hear conversations that are usually not within our reach. Such conversations do give us the opportunity for growth. And as has most probably been your experience many of our sharpest thinkers do have difficulty speaking in simple language.

...... For instance, when I preach, if

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

One thought I have had after I put in the Ten Commandments sermon was that I would enjoy weekly listing a question from Lee Barrett's new translation of THE HEIDELBERG CATECHISM and opening discussion on this profound yet simple doctument that has teaching for both confirmands and for pastors and lay people.

Willis is a wonderful thinker but I find him very hard to follow on line because of his unique background. I enjoy his comments much better in person than in print. In person his face gives cues as to whether he is joking or serious. Truly there are very few who are like him. Concerning him I recall the statement in I or II Peter that Paul was often hard to understand. You are not alone in you thoughts on Willis because his studies and life experiences are beyond even our imaginations. His logic often relates to his use of languages which he himself processed and did not find in a book of theology. Yet trying to read him is an amazing experience.

Again you have half the truth. Cetain people are gifted in bring the fruit of 2,000 years of discussion of the faith in many sundery languages into simple terms but first it is not easy to do and secondly nuances are missed if we do not use terms that are historic theological terms. Truthfully there is an aspect of &quot;brain surgery&quot; in theology. Just as I would not want the dish washer at the local diner to cut open my brain I also would not want someone who has not studied the depths and theology to teach me theology.

&gt; and understanding with the jargon of the field or the acadamia

As you recall St Paul does talk about there being a difference between &quot;milk and meat.&quot; Paul had discussions with Barnabus that he did not have with brand new converts or disiples who were not intellectually gifted. Yes we are always challenged to make the gospel accessible to everyone who hears but we are also charged to teach the teachers the depths of the faith. Sometimes this pushes us beyond our normal vocabulary. And sometimes our gifted teaches do not have the gifts of simplicity but that does not mean that we give up tryiing to learn from them.
I hope this (personal) way of looking at this might be helpful in some way. You are on to something but it needs to be more thoroughly thought out.
Thank you again for chalenging us to speak the word in a way that it might be understood.

Yours in Christ,

&gt; &gt; Dear Deb, Thanks for your concerns about theological dialogue in this
&gt; &gt; forum. I share many of your concerns and I am not sure how to address them.
&gt; &gt; I there a group lurking that would be interested in studying one of the
&gt; &gt; theological text in the Preamble? Is there a theological question that
&gt; &gt; someone would like to suggest that we could address. Larry does this
&gt; &gt; occasionally and he get some responses? Does reading a book help to get
&gt; &gt; everyone on the same focus? I would apprec iate any suggestions you have and
&gt; &gt; would be glad to work with you.

&gt; &gt; I hope I am wrong but I sense in our time that for many theology is not an
&gt; &gt; important aspect of our life together. For some Christianity is something
&gt; &gt; you catch or a religious experience that is personal and private which
&gt; &gt; cannot be critically discussed. Theology is important not just for the
&gt; &gt; clergy but for congregational life so that we understand what we do and why
&gt; &gt; we have done it. To discuss theology there has to be a honest commitment to
&gt; &gt; the discipline and one needs to know some of the language, history and
&gt; &gt; doctrines. I think most of us including laity can learn if it is important.

&gt; &gt; I recently learned that a church signed a contract with a clergy in which he
&gt; &gt; was to receive a % of all new monies that came into the church. The clergy

&gt; &gt; Chris, Willis, Herb etc.

&gt; &gt; My suggestion is simple and two fold. If another word can adequately
&gt; &gt; be used other than jargon or post-graduate level, use it!

&gt; This is an excellent suggestion on one level. Yet there are some problems. The first is that some of those involved in this meeting are scholars and might have difficulty changing their vocabulary on certain issues because they do not have the gift of simplicity. Secondly, words are important. Nuances, historical uses, uses by theological schools make certain words very powerful. It is not always easy to change these without losing much of their meaning.
&gt; I recommend that every one in this meeting purchase either:
&gt; 1) POCKET DICTIONARY OF THEOLOGICAL TERMS by Stanley Grenz on IVP
&gt; or
&gt; 2) A HANDBOOK OF THEOLOGICAL TERMS by Van Harvey on Collier Books.
&gt;  Keep these volumes near one's computer and force yourself to look up the various words.

I have to say that I am really surprised by the responses to my
suggestions to Cliff's request &quot;The members of the committee invite
your comments for discussion. Is there anything that you think we
should be thinking about as we discuss our future role within the
United Church of Christ?&quot;  Chris, I'm using your post as the outline
for my reply, but I am not limiting my response to yours.

Among many of the responses posted, I'm getting the impression that
there seems to be an unwritten, until now, understanding that
Confessing Christ is intended only for those who can grasp the highest
level of theological concepts and discussion.  It sounds to me that
there is the commonly heald belief here that this is the level where
theological discussion belongs, and that those who post here regularly
are unable to be &quot;simple&quot; in their writings nor should they consider
striving to become more conscious of accessibility to those not at
this level.  Instead, suggestions are made to buy Theological
Dictionaries for those who are having trouble, or to accept that this
is a stretch but that thestretch and reach is good for those not at
the highest level.  I also must say that I am hearing a slightly
patroning tone in some of the responses: either I don't lay out my
thought process  clearly enough for those of us who are beyond
&quot;simple&quot; language and terms, or I'm going to thank you all later for
being stretched to enter into  this highest echelon of theological
company.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Second, if&gt; one is using a word that there is a good chance is not one that is
&gt; &gt; familar to those outside of a higher level of either education or
&gt; &gt; experience give at least a brief explaination or if referring to
&gt; &gt; someone's theology, expand a little on what it is meant by that, not
&gt; &gt; just Barth's theology supports

&gt; This is again a good point. We should try to do this but it is also time consuming for those who see something they want to respond to but are quickly on their way to teach a class etc.
&gt; There are also times when two confessors are in the midst of a heated debate and many of the rest of us are in reality mere spectators. I guess I would stick to their First Amendment rights to debate or discuss in the manner that they feel most effective. Because of this point I assume that there will always be times when certain aspects of the conversation go over many of our heads. My defense of this would be that children learn the language when adults speak to them as adults. This venue therefore gives many of us who are pastors or interested lay people the opportunity to hear conversations that are usually not within our reach. Such conversations do give us the opportunity for growth. And as has most probably been your experience many of our sharpest thinkers do have difficulty speaking in simple language.
">

Ok, let me ask for clarification for myself:  What EXACTLY is the
purpose of Confessing Christ. Or perphas a better question is WHO
exactly is Confessing Christ intended for?  For as I read the
&quot;about&quot;: portion of the Confessing Christ web page as stated by the
Steering Committe, nowhere does it states it is targeted at a certain
theological knowledge level.
.
&quot;CONFESSING CHRIST is an invitation to joyous theological reflection
and serious theological work throughout the United Church of Christ.&quot;
If it is to be work throughout the United Church of Christ, then
shouldn't the work be within the reach of most who would seek it out?
Or is serious theological work a code word for &quot;post-graduate&quot;?

&quot;CONFESSING CHRIST affirms faithfulness to the one Word of the triune
God, Jesus Christ, which we are to hear and which we have to trust and
obey in life and in death.

CONFESSING CHRIST is committed to listen for God's Word in the Holy
Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments and in our rich theological
heritage. Central to the United Church of Christ, which baptizes in
the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, is its faith in Jesus
Christ as Lord and Savior. This faith is grounded in the authority of
Scripture and is expressed in the ecumenical creeds, in the
confessions and covenants of our Reformation traditions, in the
Preamble of its Constitution, and in the prayers, worship and public
witness of the Church.

CONFESSING CHRIST embraces the responsibility of every generation in
the Church to make this faith its own.&quot;
Does Confessing Christ merely embrace this responsibility, or does it
see itself as helping in that process?

It's fine to say &quot;the level of discussion is good because it will
stretch people, help them to grow theologically and/or learn more&quot;
But  (to use the analogy that Willis uses in another post) - if the
trainer/instructer assumes that a beginner class will be able to keep
up with the advanced level that he/she is at and only pushes/teaches
them at that level, then one of two things happens to the students.
Either they are injured for pushing too far above their current
condition, or they drop out because they can't keep up and the gap is
just too great to see any chance of getting there.  I believe that
based on my own experience and some conversations, there are many
potential participants here who fall into this later catergory, and
who drop out of these sort of dsicussions because the bar is set too
high.  A good instructer will lead at the level just slightly out of
reach of the class, or modify the program to be able to allow
different entry points for different levels of fitness.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  ...... For instance, when I preach, if&gt; I use jargon, I give a short definition of it the first time I use it.
&gt; &gt; (i.e - repentance,which means to turn around and walk/face God) that I
&gt; &gt; hope gives those who don't know or understand the term at least a
&gt; &gt; small piece to hang on in trying to listening to the rest of the
&gt; &gt; sermon.

&gt; &gt; I'm not suggesting a need for a separate forum or for Confessing
&gt; &gt; Christ to necessarily provide beginner educational theology fourms
&gt; &gt; (though that might be a thought if there was both time and interest).

&gt; One thought I have had after I put in the Ten Commandments sermon was that I would enjoy weekly listing a question from Lee Barrett's new translation of THE HEIDELBERG CATECHISM and opening discussion on this profound yet simple doctument that has teaching for both confirmands and for pastors and lay people.

&gt; &gt; What I'm suggesting is a greater awareness by those who post of those
&gt; &gt; who may not be at the level of education/knowledge they are. Willis
&gt; &gt; says he hasn't written technical postings for this forum; I think what
&gt; &gt; is techncial is in the eye of the beholder,

&gt; Willis is a wonderful thinker but I find him very hard to follow on line because of his unique background. I enjoy his comments much better in person than in print. In person his face gives cues as to whether he is joking or serious. Truly there are very few who are like him. Concerning him I recall the statement in I or II Peter that Paul was often hard to understand. You are not alone in you thoughts on Willis because his studies and life experiences are beyond even our imaginations. His logic often relates to his use of languages which he himself processed and did not find in a book of theology. Yet trying to read him is an amazing experience.

&gt; for there have been many&gt; times I've felt that Willis and others have gone beyond semi-technical
&gt; &gt; into not only technical but a specialized technical that only an elite
&gt; &gt; few are able to parse and participate. Putting a post aside to
&gt; &gt; consider later won't help if it is written at this specialized
&gt; &gt; level.
">

I used Willis as an example because he specifically said he did not
post technical posts here.  But as I stated above, he is not the only
one that I could say that regularlly posts at this specialized
technical level.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Why is there so little discussion or concern seemingly about
&gt; &gt; theology? Because theology and theologians has become perceived and
&gt; &gt; promoted as a specialized field that only the relativiely few who have
&gt; &gt; special education can enter into and who are to spend time considering
&gt; &gt; these things. It's become like brain surgery - something only the few
&gt; &gt; trained and qualified should do. Theology, as Dr. Bob Sherman taught
&gt; &gt; us, is merely the knowledge of God.

&gt; Again you have half the truth. Cetain people are gifted in bring the fruit of 2,000 years of discussion of the faith in many sundery languages into simple terms but first it is not easy to do and secondly nuances are missed if we do not use terms that are historic theological terms. Truthfully there is an aspect of &quot;brain surgery&quot; in theology. Just as I would not want the dish washer at the local diner to cut open my brain I also would not want someone who has not studied the depths and theology to teach me theology. Theology was once considered the Queen of the Sciences but now anyone who is on a radio show is infallible.

Deb,

I have two short responses since I think I am on my third note for the day. I have erased everything because it was getting too difficult to understand who was writing what.
1) The invitation does speak of  &quot;SERIOUS&quot;  theological discussion. I would interpret this as involving effort and being stretched.
2) Your note dismissed my (personal, I have no idea what help others would want to offer) recommendation of having one of two theological dictionaries on hand. POCKET DICTIONARY OF THEOLOGICAL TERMS by Stanley Grenz is only 120 pages and literally can be put in your pocket.  (Harvey's is 253 pages and can also can go in most pockets.) If one is to do &quot;serious&quot; theological discussion an investment in a 120 page book does not seem unreasonable.

Chris:

Let me start out by reassuring you and others that I own several
theological dictionaries, some more extensive then others. :D (YOU
don't think I got out of Bob Sherman's classes without having to buy
at least one, did you ?;)  )  I don't have a problem with looking up a
word or two in them to help me understand a post.  But it can be
discouraging to have to look up large volumes of the words in a post
(and I'm referring to individual posts, not discussion threads) in
order to understnad the writers meaning.  In addition, my personality/
call/fault (depending on where I'm using it or who I'm addressing)
tends to be to see things from the so called underdog position and
from the point of one who may be easily ignored or intimidated by
someone in a more authoritive position.  And so my suggestions are not
only for my benefit, but for those who may puruse here without an
M.Div. like many have who post here.

Let me just ask one more time - WHO exactly is Confessing Christ
intended for? Who is the intended audience and participants of this
forum? I'm not asking this rhetorically, but as a sincere question.

If Confessing Christ is considered a place to foster serious
theological converation in the UCC, then would it not be applicable to
have as one of its concerns the need to be accessible to those without
advance degrees? I am talking about entry points into the discussions,
not a dumbing down of the topics or subjects.  Nor am I suggesting
that every single discussion needs to be at an intermediate/beginner
level.  However, it might be helpful in fostering discussion in the
UCC of theological matters to have those higher echalon discussions be
in the minority, not the majority of our discussion.    However, if
Cofessing Christ is considered the place for those who want a certain
level of theological discussion, be it at the graduate, post-graduate
or other level, then my concerns about accessiblility to a wider
audience in the UCC are less pressing.  But if that is the case,
perhaps there should be another word added to the description of this
being a place for joyful and serious theological reflection?

God's grace and peace,
Deb K.
