I found this recipe on the net last week and have tried it twice,
without success. The problem is it never cooks properly. The first time
I didn't use any baking powder so I assumed that was the reason for the
gooey middle. This time I used baking powder and let the mixture cook
for a full 30 minutes before doing the cocktail stick test. The mixture
was too gooey for my liking so I baked for another 5 minutes before
playing the cake tin on wire rack and leaving it too cool for 20
minutes. When I came back to the cake it's arse fell out i.e. the middle
collapsed. I flipped the brownie over and the middle looked patchy
compared to the rest of the mixture. I cut the brownie into pieces, it
tastes great but the middle part is gooey, though not as gooey as last
time. What am I doing wrong? Can someone recommend an alternative recipe
and please not one that uses those whacky American ingredients that we
can't get hold of in the UK!!!

Here's the recipe :

Frosted Fudge Brownies

BROWNIES
250g flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
200g sugar
125g butter or margarine, softened
2 eggs
85g chocolate
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
100g chopped nuts

* I assume self raising?
** I used about 30g of chopped walnuts

FROSTING
42g butter or margarine, softened
28g chocolate
2 teaspoons milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
200g cup sifted powdered sugar

BROWNIES : COMBINE flour, baking powder and salt in a small bowl. Beat
sugar, butter, eggs, chocolate and vanilla extract in a small mixing
bowl until creamy. Gradually beat in flour mixture. Stir in nuts. Spread
into a greased 8-inch-square baking pan.

BAKE in preheated oven (180C?) for 25 to 30 minutes or until wooden pick
inserted in center comes out still slightly sticky. Brownies will darken
on cooling. Spread with Fudge Frosting.

FROSTING: BEAT butter, chocolate, milk and vanilla extract in a small
mixing bowl until well blended. Gradually beat in powdered sugar until
thick and creamy.

I'm dying to know what a whacky American ingredient is that can't be
gotten in the UK, one that might commonly be used in baking brownies.
Enlighten me, please.  (I might be glad to send it to you if I knew what
it was.)

As for the brownies not cooking in the middle, I recommend thicker
smaller baking pans and more of them.  Lower the baking temperature to
350 degrees and bake longer.   Shoot for a fairly flat brownie which
means putting less batter into each pan.

This particular mix is very heavy, sticky and difficult to spread in the

I had to google on choco bake to find out what it was and got a giggle
out of it when I did.  Pre-melted chocolate "ends the hassles of melting
chocolate."  I suppose "hassle" is one way of looking at it, but I
rather enjoy the steps involved with home baking.

Can you get this product in the U.K?
http://www.kraftfoods.com/BakersChocolate/BakersBrands.htm

The chocolate itself is adequate.  I like it fine, but others on this
list say it's not wonderful.  I mention it because the recipe on the box
of unsweetened chocolate makes easy brownies.  You melt the butter and
chocolate in the microwave, add the flour, sugar, eggs and vanilla, then
pour the batter into a greased brownie pan.  There's little clean-up,
and I can testify to the middle of the pan baking through.

Are you using the right size pan.  I use the brownie recipe from Joy of

use a larger pan they the recipe calls for.

I've never seen that particular brand though our supermarkets have
excellent ranges of Belgium cooking chocolate.

Brownies are =supposed= to be dense and gooey in the middle. They're
not like cake, they're much moister than regular cake. They're really
halfway to fudge. Don't overbake them, or they'll be too dry. And
don't use self-rising flour, use regular bread flour (or whatever you
call it in England - flour without any baking powder, baking soda or
salt added to it).

It's easier, and I like the flavor -- although last time I made them I

No. Use regular white flour.

I have a hard time assessing this recipe without converting the grams to
ounces, which is too much work at this hour of the night.

I would suggest melting the butter before adding the sugar, eggs, and
chocolate, though. And don't overbeat after adding the flour.

&gt; I found this recipe on the net last week and have tried it twice,
&gt; without success. The problem is it never cooks properly. The first time
&gt; I didn't use any baking powder so I assumed that was the reason for the
&gt; gooey middle. This time I used baking powder and let the mixture cook
&gt; for a full 30 minutes before doing the cocktail stick test. The mixture
&gt; was too gooey for my liking so I baked for another 5 minutes before
&gt; playing the cake tin on wire rack and leaving it too cool for 20
&gt; minutes. When I came back to the cake it's arse fell out i.e. the middle
&gt; collapsed. I flipped the brownie over and the middle looked patchy
&gt; compared to the rest of the mixture. I cut the brownie into pieces, it
&gt; tastes great but the middle part is gooey, though not as gooey as last
&gt; time. What am I doing wrong? Can someone recommend an alternative recipe
&gt; and please not one that uses those whacky American ingredients that we
&gt; can't get hold of in the UK!!!

These are good.  You can make half and put it into an 8" square pan -
bake about 30 minutes.

Barb Schaller's Famous Orgasmic Chocolate Brownies

Recipe By:  Barb Schaller, posted again to rfc 3-27-2007
Serving Size:  24
Preparation Time: 0:45

1  cup   unsalted butter   (8 oz.)
4  ounces   unsweetened baking chocolate
2  cups  granulated sugar  (15 oz.)
4     eggs
2  teaspoons   vanilla extract
1  teaspoon almond extract
1  cup   chopped nuts, optional (walnuts or pecans)
1 1/3 cups  cake flour  (6 oz.)
1  teaspoon baking powder
1/2   teaspoon salt

Move oven rack to center and preheat oven to 350° F.  Line a 9x13" metal
baking pan with parchment paper.

In microwave oven, on medium-high power, melt butter and chocolate in
2-quart microwave-safe bowl, about 3 minutes.  Stir until smooth.  Mix
in granulated sugar, then beat in eggs, one at a time, with wire whisk.

Mix in vanilla and almond.  Stir in nuts.  Combine cake flour, baking
powder, and salt and fold into chocolate.  Spread batter in 9x13" pan
lined with baking parchment and bake in preheated oven at 350°F for
about 33-35 minutes.  Do not overbake; toothpick may have fudgy crumbs
on it, but not wet batter.
Cool pan on wire rack for 15 minutes before removing (if you wish)
brownies from pan.
‹‹‹‹‹
Notes:   Please, keep the moaning down; it annoys the neighbors.  I use
the baking parchment so the whole can be removed from the pan for easy
transport to a lucky recipient.  You may want to support the bottom with
cardboard.

First Place (Plain or a variation, depending on year), 1997 and 2002,
2005 Minnesota State Fairs.  Adapted from recipe in Cook's Illustrated
magazine, March/April 1994.   Please note that I do use real chocolate,
unsalted butter and cake flour and a flat wire whisk.  If you do not,
don't complain to me about it.   In fact, don't complain to me about it
anyway.

Have you tried the Hershey's semi sweet dark cocoa? It makes excellent
brownies- I also add a cup or so of semi sweet chips to the batter

Calumet is a brand name for double-acting baking powder.  I'd guess that
the UK has something similar.  Some brownie recipes don't use any
leavening ingredients at all.   Maybe you need a different recipe.  :-)

I could be wrong, but I was under the impression that all baking powder
these days is double acting.

I use the Cockaigne Brownie recipe from Joy of Cooking, so I probably
shouldn't be writing it out. It has no leavening agent at all.  You melt
unsweetened chocolate and butter together and that gets mixed with 4 eggs
and cups sugar and only a small amount of flour.  They are out of this
world delicious.

&gt; Here's my recipe.  Do not use self-rising flour, use plain (all purpose)
&gt; flour.  I usually double the recipe and make in a 9x13" pan, or triple
&gt; it and make in a 4 liter lasagna pan.  They don't need frosting.

&gt; (1 cup = about 235 ml, 1 tsp = 5 ml.  I really should convert the whole
&gt; thing to grams sometime)

&gt; Bob's Brownies
&gt;
&gt; 1/3 C cocoa
&gt; 1/2 C flour
&gt; 1 C sugar
&gt; 1/2 C salted butter or margarine, softened
&gt; 2 eggs
&gt; 1 tsp vanilla
&gt; 1/2 C chopped walnuts or pecans
&gt;
&gt; Peheat oven to 325°F. Sift dry ingredients into mixing bowl.  Add
&gt; remaining ingredients and beat until the mixture lightens in color. Bake
&gt; in greased 8x8x2" pan for 35 minutes.

I just made a batch. I only used about 50g of walnuts.  I made some
frosting to go on top but next time I'll use milk chocolate for that
instead to counter the rich taste of the brownies. They taste great.

Thanks again.

I'm going to say something that seems sort of obvious to me but noone
else has yet thought to bring it up. Have you ever used melted
chocolate in anything else?

Chocolate has this nasty habit of doing something called "seizing".
I'll let you look up how to seize chocolate, I don't bake much with it
so I look it up each time. Seizing is when the chocolate crystalizes
in a certain way. At that point the chocolate will not mix with
anything. My one experience with seized chocolate is that it will stay
mixed with the stuff it was already mixed with, but not with the stuff
that is added after. I wouldn't be suprised if your recipe turned out
the way it did because a lot of the chocolate that didn't mix migrated
to the center.

Seizing chocolate happens when you mix liquids with the chocolate. In
your recipe you don't even melt the chocolate. You let it and the
butter melt in the mixing process. What I do is put the chocolate and
the butter in a bowl. Then I microwave it ten seconds at a time,
thoroughly but slowly mixing between between microwavings.
At first you can do fifteen seconds, but once it is clear that the
mixture is starting to melt, drop down to ten seconds and DO NOT
GO ANY LONGER THEN 10 seconds. I mix everything else together,
then I add the CHOCOLATE TO THE REST. Don't add the rest to
the chocolate.

As to using cocoa powder, I believe it is a lot harder to make cocoa
powder seize, and certainly you were mixing it differently.

Now you have two choices, you can just decide to keep using
cocoa powder, or you can try chocolate one more time. Me I would try
chocolate for two reasons. First I would want to see if I was really
seizing the chocolate. Second I would want to  see which tastes better
chocolate or cocoa powder.

PS Beleive me, it would not be to make another batch of brownies :)
You have two choices

I've only been cooking for about 2 weeks so the only thing I used melted

&gt; Think twice, code once.

I've made the original recipe three times. The first batch with milk
chocolate and the second and third with plain chocolate, the first was,
naturally the sweetest. The problem with all three batches is that they
didn’t taste like brownies, the texture was crumbly instead of being
dense, the brownies were too gooey in the middle and had the same colour
as light brown sugar. They tasted like mild chocolate cake. Bob's
brownies had a rich chocolaty flavour.
