Made by local firms. Failed quality tests
by Apiradee TREERUTKUARKUL

Seven locally produced heart drugs have been removed from hospitals
after they failed to pass quality tests, health authorities said
yesterday. The findings came from a study of 137 samples of 11 drug
categories used in 39 hospitals accredited by the Institute of
Hospital Quality Improvement and Accreditation.

Researcher Wongwiwat Tassaneeyakul, of Khon Kaen University's faculty
of pharmaceutical sciences, said seven drugs used to treat heart and
artery ailments were found to be substandard. The ingredients did not
meet requirements, and the disintegration time and dosage limits were
different from details given to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
during the registration period. Mr Wongwiwat refused to reveal the
brands or manufacturers, merely saying they were made by two local
pharmaceutical companies.

&quot;The result of the study reflects the need to develop a surveillance
system and database of both patented and generic drugs registered with
the Food and Drug Administration,&quot; he said.
&quot;We need to ensure that mistakes do not occur in the production
process and affect consumer health in the long run,&quot; he said.
Mr Wongwiwat, who specialises in pharmacology and toxicology, is
heading a study of the quality of locally produced drugs. It is
supported by the FDA, the Medical Sciences Department and the National
Health Security Office. He said the project was now focussing on 11
categories of antibiotics because the drugs were widely used and often
caused side-effects. The drugs were also competitive in terms of
price.

The study was expected to conclude later this year.
Mr Wongwiwat believed it would encourage local drug firms to pay
closer attention to the manufacturing process.
''The quality of the drugs should not be traded off for a cheap
price,'' he said.

He said he planned to expand the programme to cover other categories
of drugs. In total, about 60% of drugs were used in hospitals and the
rest distributed to pharmacies. Sukanya Jiarapong, a health specialist
at the drug bureau, said the FDA had removed all stocks of the seven
drugs from hospitals.

This article perfectly illustrates the difficulty of making complex
drugs in Thailand.
In the case of heart drugs, it is not a national disaster... except
for the people with heart disease, of course.
But it's a quiet different story when you want to deal with
communicable disease like AIDS, despite all the rantings of the
junta's minions and other Pelfessol in trolling from NJ!!!

Hey Deckard,

Can you shade a light on all this?

Your &quot;fag&quot; habit, your drug habit ......

(Hope that the Thai Cyberpolice is not watching).

&quot;I don't, but he seems like he's attractive. I don't mean that in a gay
way....&quot;
&quot;I wasn't high when that pic was taken...&quot;
&quot;I didn't say that, I just asked you if you think she's pretty&quot;... and on it
goes, you can imagine with him being nine years-old&quot;
&quot;She babysits my monsters once in a while and they both are crazy about her.
My oldest has a crush on her....&quot;
&quot;I tell my closest male friends that I love them, and they do the same, but
it's a &quot;guy&quot;

POTSIE?! Ahhhhhhhhh! Dammit! (hehehe) Luke Perry... ok... that was nice. He
is a good looking guy, I mean... I bet women think he's handsome. I don't,
but he seems like he's attractive. I don't mean that in a gay way, just that
he... &lt;grin&gt;

I wasn't high when that pic was taken, but the person that took it was
pissing me off. She kept taking the picture *right before* I was ready. We'd
taken about eight and I was so ready to stop. My two boys can be seen in the
background, hugging each other in a picture on the wall. It isn't my office,
it's hers, she loves my two boys. She took that pic too, and hung it on her
wall all without me knowing. She babysits my monsters once in a while and
they both are crazy about her. My oldest has a crush on her, but you'd never
get him to admit that. He just says things like &quot;Do you think she's pretty
dad?&quot; To whit I'll say, &quot;Sure, she's pretty. You think she's pretty, huh?&quot;
He gets that 'look' on his face and says &quot;I didn't say that, I just asked
you if you think she's pretty&quot;... and on it goes, you can imagine with him
being nine years-old.

On the gay fear thing. It probably happens because when guys are in their
teens, *any* comment that is even a little bit &quot;gay&quot; sounding is met with
mass ridicule from your peers. I'm sure the Deluxe One and Durt have tons of
stories, which aren't a bit funny about that little bit of hatefulness.
This kind of conditions you to respond in a zealous (sometimes homo-phobic)
manner when things get &quot;mushy&quot;. Yea, it's stupid, and I try not to act that
way, but sometimes those deep habits surface.

I tell my closest male friends that I love them, and they do the same, but
it's a &quot;guy&quot; kind of comment - something like &quot;Alright, I'll see you at the
clubhouse at 4:00. Love ya bro.&quot; Or if someone is really hurting I might get
more intense and say &quot;I love you, and I'll do anything I can to help you get
though this shit&quot;. Well, I'm sure that's way more than you cared to know on
that subject.

Blacky, you should wash your eyes sometimes.
The article's sentence is quite clear:
&quot;The ingredients did not meet requirements, and the disintegration

ineffective!
It's worth noting that they are talking of *official* drugs taken from
the shelves of *accredited* hospitals. I let the Scters with good

drugs you find in the small pharmacy of Ban Nowhere in the remote

This should have been done long ago!!! Substandart and ineffective

diseases like malaria, bird flu and tuberculosis that become
extensively drug-resistant diseases.

Pathetic excuse and E-dogsh*t that we are used to read here from your

Thailand. The quality deficiency of locally produced drugs has been

No, it's just the plain truth that brings out your verbose ignorance.
The excellent article from The Nation that VB posted here in May 2007
said that locally made drugs were inadequate for sale outside Thailand
but CONTINUED to be used on Thai patients. Your beloved senile
dictators encourage this stupid policy. The Fascist morons and their
Farang aficionados don't only show complete disregard for patients but
their anti-western populism is getting criminal.

Blacky, I suspect you miss me and my posts but I'm not reading SCT
every hour of the day!
Indeed, I have a life and I confess that I lately do the same thing as
the normal Scters, the Gang and you certainly do: deleting 90% of the

But I did reply to your noisy barking about the Thai drugs. There is

Wrong again.
Actuallly the main cause(s) are:
1. Patients who do not complete and/or take regularly their course of
medications.
2. Doctors who indiscriminately prescribe drugs absent definitive diagnoses.
A common example is the dispensing of antibacterials for viral conditions.
3. Bacterial and viral mutations that occur even *absent* selection
pressures such as the previous.
4. What you said--a cause, one of several, and not the main cause.

Interesting that you mention tuberculosis, which is provenly selected for

Interesting also that you mention bird flu, in which not only is
'non-responsiveness' to medication an ongoing problem being worked on, but
one which (like all influenza viruses) is highly mutable with or without any
medication, good or otherwise.
Well, not so interesting, actually, as 'tis merely a reminder of the level

I and another ADHer are planning a meeting of Dallas/Ft. Worth...
well...
ADHers. Since one of the folks (who already has agreed to this meeting)
lives in Ft. Worth, we will probably try to do something between the cities,
maybe somewhere near D/FW airport. We'll try to shoot for something in late
July, or early August, when it's still really hot and a cold drink sounds
like a good idea. ;-)

We'll coordinate this in email, via my address. I'm open to suggestions on
the place we meet. All anonymity will be respected, and of course it will be
a good idea to come CLEAN (not carrying any, ah, substances) , in case some
mole decides to fuck up our little shindig. Whether you are clean (i.e.,
under some influence) is your own choice.

I am offering to buy the first two rounds of drinks for everyone, after
that, you're on your own. I have, in the past, gotten some positive response
to a meeting of this type, I hope those in the woodwork (lurking) who live
near Big D, will come out of hiding for this &quot;event&quot;.

May has graciously posted a new photo of me at her site
( http://www.geocities.com/sowildaboutharry/ ), more current than the pic that
was there, so when we meet you'll at least have one face to recognize.

Those interested, please email me and let me know if that time of the month
would be agreeable.

See you soon,

P.S. Those willing, please let me know in email if you want to be named as
an attender in the ADH NG, under your handle, of course.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Made by local firms. Failed quality tests

&gt;&gt;&gt; Seven locally produced heart drugs have been removed from hospitals
&gt;&gt;&gt; after they failed to pass quality tests, health authorities said
&gt;&gt;&gt; yesterday. The findings came from a study of 137 samples of 11 drug
&gt;&gt;&gt; categories used in 39 hospitals accredited by the Institute of

&gt;&gt;&gt; Researcher Wongwiwat Tassaneeyakul, of Khon Kaen University's faculty

&gt; No, it's just the plain truth that brings out your verbose ignorance.
&gt; The excellent article from The Nation that VB posted here in May 2007
&gt; said that locally made drugs were inadequate for sale outside Thailand
&gt; but CONTINUED to be used on Thai patients. Your beloved senile

&gt; their anti-western populism is getting criminal.

paid by the cattle industry that invented this story to distract
people's attention from the content of their food.
I don't want to go further on with your off topic trolling but I've
had a good laugh with your suggestion that the Thai researcher could
have found that the locally-produced drugs were BETTER than the
standards!
555555! Your insincerity is reaching a Chaboonesque profoundness.

My point to the sensible Scters is quite simple.
If you need to take indispensable drugs in Thailand, bring your own
medication from your country or asked your embassy for a reliable
pharmacy...
and avoid the self-proclaimed &quot;experts&quot;

Michael Blum, M.D., medical officer of the U.S. FDA's division of
anti-infective drug products:
&quot;Many consumers have an expectation that when they're ill, antibiotics are
the answer. They put pressure on the physician to prescribe them. Most of
the time the illness is viral, and antibiotics are not the answer. This
large burden of antibiotics is certainly selecting resistant bacteria.&quot;

Certainly--on that point I am as stupid as Dr. Blum, while to you all are
stupid who do not agree with your trollish drivel.
You have nearly the intellectual integrity of a common shill--at least on
your better days.

LOL !
Yah, I neglected to mention antibiotic residues in slaughtered livestock,
though as the three mechanisms (plus your false claim of: &lt;q&gt;Substandart and
ineffective drugs against communicable disease are the MAIN [[&lt;emphasis
added]] cause of drug-resistant epidemics&lt;/q&gt;) that I mentioned are
ubiquitous to human and other animal populations, both carnivorous and
herbivorous, pray tell what the f*ck is your problem?
(besides the voices in your head, of course  ;~)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't want to go further on with your off topic trolling but I've

Aha, those voices in your head again?
Poor thing, not that you'll go back in my posts and find such an actual

Thank you; from what I know of Chabon he is a most sincere fellow.

really sincere when feeding trolls? ;~)

&gt; My point to the sensible Scters is quite simple.
&gt; If you need to take indispensable drugs in Thailand, bring your own
&gt; medication from your country or asked your embassy for a reliable
&gt; pharmacy...

Not only are there a great MANY reliable pharmacies in Thailand, but
counterfeit and substandard drugs are a GLOBAL problem, and with the
expertise of modern day counterfeit producers, many a totally legitimate
pharmacist is hoodwinked by distributors, and/or the distributors themselves
may be taken.
Bringing one's own pharmaceuticals is fine providing they're fine, and
embassies *may* well know good sources in Thailand (or anywhere), but your
implication that neither Thai doctors nor hospitals have proper knowledge or
good pharmaceuticals, nor that the vast majority of better pharmacies do not
stock good medicines in Thailand can best be explained by your own
colonialist condescensions.
Fact is that the article you 'just couldn't wait' to post as 'evidence of
inferiority' was both the opposite (it showed bad drugs found and removed
from stocks--that's proactive diligence, dummy!) as well as an admission
that the oversight process needs much improvement.
(sorry, but the 86-ing of bad meds from stocks IS AN OVERSiGHT PROCESS)

Perhaps if you find time between trolling however many boards are 'blessed'
wiith your 'contributions,' you can scare up some mentions during your
favorite PM's regime to show how much better his Greatness's ministries did
their job and how much more open the news was *then*?
. .providing the voices in your head permit this, of course  ;~)

So, with all these fantastic things, when are you going to come over

show your REAL COWARD pedo face?

Dont bother, I will get your true identity ine way or another, coward.

When are you planning your next trip to Thailand?
Latest news goes around that the Thai Immigration is waiting for you
to
explain some things in &quot;Hotel Bangkok&quot;.

So, can you now read the Thai numbers?
The well travelled and high educated pedo Frenchman?

You sound every day more and more boring.
Is this what staying in France do to peeple?

Of course you know Thai politics by what &quot;a few Thai ladies (whores)&quot;
have
told you.................

Care to tell the newsgroup how you remain seated, nipping on your beer
as a
&quot;ba ba boo boo fahrang supremacist&quot; while the reastaurant was on fire?

Care to tell the newsgroup your pedo story about how you seduced a
choirboy
carrying 13 condoms?

BTW, you are posting jewels of anti-Thai propaganda lately in here.
Do you plan to come back to Thailand in the near future?
Wonder if the current government know all this and &quot;lesse majeste&quot; you
show
in your posts?
Like the one where you were holding a subversive speech in an
University
.....
