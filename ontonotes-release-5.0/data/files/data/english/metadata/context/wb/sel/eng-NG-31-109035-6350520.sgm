This is my vision of Olympiada in digital charcoal.  I spent a few
hours visualizing how I imagined her to look, and found a photograph
that reminded me of my fantasy.  She has been encouraging me lately to
focus on my art, and fantasies.  So I got out my charcoal set, and drew
the photo as large as I was able to on a huge sheet of paper.  I tride
my best to think about the photo as hard as I could and visualize
myself drawing it in my mind.  But as usual my art is never good
enough.  So what I did next created something I hope will be adaquet to
show you how I actually imagine okay.

Once I scanned the image in I used an artistic technique I've created
to create a digital copy of it in photoshop.  Then I blended in the
real photo with my artistic charcoal, so you can't tell there even was
a real photo.  It looks like truly digitally inspired artwork, they a
real artist may as well have created.  I just love this technique and I
hope you all take a look here: http://www.ckoogle.com/atlanta.gif

If you have any GOOD criticisms let me know so I can continue to work
on my methods, and create even better works of interactive fantasy in
the future.

Tell me what you think especially Atlanta.  Does it look like you? ?

I will send you my photographs. I expect them to stay personal and
confidential. I will send you my photographs from Christmas at my
parents house. I am very photogenic. As I have sent them to another
member of ssbb, you shall be the second. My hair is not that long, I cut
it at my grandma's recommendation last year. You will see me, and I want
you to draw what I send you and post that, but not my photograph. My
photographs are on my parish website, so I will send you those first,
and then my private ones next from my parents.
I am reading alt.gothic again, so you may post to me there.

It might be more interesting if I put some clothes on her, and did
another drawing of her as a portrait, so you could see her face.  But
I'm finding out now that I have her photos, once I go to all of this
trouble modeling the charcoal drawing, I can look at that and draw it
again on paper and it is 10x better than what I started with.  :)

Beauty, beauty, beauty.  I've been working on your portrait since
before 10:00 AM my time (EST).  It is 7:30 now, and I've shown you a
few drafts of my artwork, and tride to correct the changes and
suggestions to it that you have made.  In the end I thought it was one
of the very best drawings I've ever done.  But you aren't happy with
it?

I have failed, and it doesn't look like anyone will ever get to see my
drawing.  It is such a dissapointment because I will be working all day
tomorrow trying to reproduce what I made by hand, and then will be
bringing it back onto the computer to blend with the digital image.
But in my gut I know you still won't like my art anymore than what I
made today.

It is so shameful for me to even try.  I've always wanted to become an
artist, and it is such a tired frustrating road.  But it always has
been.  I do hope that you can appreciate all of the love &amp; energy I
have put into this.  And I will be saving this portrait for times to
come.  So thanks for sending me the photos.  At least it gave me
something constructive to do with my time.

But I don't see where this relationship is going if you only loved me
for my art, and now you say it is no good.  I don't even know what a
femdom is...  And I don't think I will be buying anyone a television.
Although my stocks grew 8% today.  The Apple company is doing great.
Maybe I will send some to fight aids in africa.

Corey, it is best worked out in private. Take it off the Internet. I

immediately.

If you want a model, then find a professional one. I have decided this
violates my Master's authority over me and I do not wish to displease
him. Please stop. My naked body and my visage are his and his alone to
do with as he wishes. I am sorry I allowed you to take it this far.

I love you for who you are. Your art is good. But it is not proper for
your fantasy of my naked body to be on the Internet. Your portrait is
good. I may allow that. Take the naked drawing off the Internet and we
shall see. I am sorry I hurt your feelings. People are criticizing your
work. Never mind about the femdom. Mentor is a better word. I do not
need a television. A man in my real life offered me one today. I do need
a digital camera though. Mine broke. You can support this man's mission:

Give me a break! I am about to go stand in Church for a hierarchal
liturgy, in a long dress and high heels. He got my breasts wrong. And I
have never posed nude for a man. I gave him fully clothed pictures of me
so he can change my image. That was his fantasy, not entirely off, but
not entirely correct either.

I gave you the clothed pictures. Do those and repost them. My nipples
are not that big and I never stand naked for men to draw me. That was
your fantasy, pretty good, but not entirely correct. My hair is below my
shoulders. I cut it off when I divorced as a symbol of my mourning. It
used to be that long.

Please show me what you come up with. Let us talk about drawing with
colored pencils this afternoon. I need to produce a line of greeting
cards for work and I need a lot of help. I am far behind in my
production due to joining the team late.

I have been working on this drawing more tonight, and finally I have
something that Atlanta and I are both happy with.  It may not explore
her beauty in its entirety, but it is much better than the last work of
fiction I did exploring my fantasies about her.  It is now hosted at
the same link, so I hope you all can enjoy, even if you aren't able to
comment on how well it looks like our lovely.  But she has taken me on
under her as my femdom now, so I know I must have done well enough with
this to impress her.  But she helped me throughout the entire process.

That is not me. I do not have a "droopy butt" and I am not going to show
him a picture of my butt because I do not allow pictures of my butt.
He is currently working on a portrait of me and he has the nose wrong. I
have a Roman nose.

The face on me in that first portrait is wrong. The bone structure in my
face is more defined, I have higher cheek bones. Give him credit for
trying.

I am honored that he would do this for me, of his own volition, as my
name is getting smeared across the Internet.

BTW I told TDVForum that you had defiled two of my nyms on my space, and
they thought I was promoting my My Space site. I don't have one!

People out there are spreading lies about me and then accusing me of
lying. People are hostile, mean and nasty and when I call them on the
carpet they attack me!!!

What a battleground...

There is a lot of gossip about me out there on the Internet, and none of
it is true. The people that are gossiping about me are not members of my
community and do not know me in real life. I am astounded at the bad
press that is being generated about a woman. I have never ever seen such
a thing in all my life.

Again, you misjudged and you assume you are correct. I gave him a

I do not post lies all over the Internet. The lot of you, the ones who

about myself. You tell your version of what you think I am saying and it
is usually false. Communication takes time and effort, much back and
forth, mirroring, repeating, asking for clarity. You do none of that.

Actually I did not announce. I misjudged that group. I will not state my
feelings about it publicly, but I have gone web mail. It might not be a
healthy place for me. Rather than ask me about my self, one of the
moderators has dragged in issues from another group.

I am not sure who first demanded to know who my Master was or if I had
one, but that is where things went astray. I have recovered from that
attack. From here on out any one who derides or tries to pry into my
affairs with my Master will get the cold shoulder from me.

I am far from stupid. Everyone in my community knows this for a fact,
everyone in my real life would be the first to tell you how smart I am.

You are invested in making me out to look like a troll. Why, I do not
know, but I have an idea.

It is you who makes yourself look petty to the people who know me in
real life.

You do not listen to me. You only hear your own derisive laughter. Did

&gt;&gt;&gt; Tell me what you think especially Atlanta.  Does it look like you? ?

&gt;&gt; I will send you my photographs. I expect them to stay personal and
&gt;&gt; confidential. I will send you my photographs from Christmas at my
&gt;&gt; parents house. I am very photogenic. As I have sent them to another
&gt;&gt; member of ssbb, you shall be the second. My hair is not that long, I cut

Actually, Corey, I am only your mentor. And I was wrong, I have no
master. Truly Clooful played tricks with my mind. He said he was not
someone, then he said he was, and then he gave me a choice, and I chose
but I made a mistake. Truly Clooful expects perfection of me, and I can
not give that to him.

So, I take back my assertion, Truly Clooful is not my master, I never
knew him outside of soc.subculture.bondage-bdsm.

I will tell you something. I can not get involved with a man who has a
woman. That violates my moral principles.

I have your portrait of me before me, and it reminds me of who I really
am, not these ugly words that are hurled at me like missiles.

And I know I have a sweet voice.

I am really hurt that people would say such vile things about me, but
what do I know about sadism? Nothing. I really do not think I am a
masochist. I know I must strive to be submissive as a Christian, first
and foremost to God. Then if God sees it fit to deliver a Master to me
in the future to me, then I shall strive to submit to him.

But that is not now.

I can send you the hi resolution photo. It might help your work better.

Thanks, it's nice to have a "face" to go with the posts. At this point
I think I prefer an artistic rendering to an actual photo. For me it
probably has something to do with the "artistic" (surreal?) nature of
Atlanta's posts. It's an interesting image.

I am happy to serve as a muse for you. You have a lot of talent and
energy. However, in the future, I would recommend you channeling it into
to something productive like a class. You would probably really enjoy
figure drawing. That is a great medium for charcoal. I still have my
charcoal from my figure drawing classes from a decade ago! I treasure
all my art supplies like jewels and have kept much of my art and my
supplies half my life.

I don't know where you work at night, but the other night I was trying
to work at my desk and the light was all wrong, I was using this little
red lamp that is for a nightstand. I am either going to have to
rearrange my room or work in the dining room. I am _so_ frustrated!

Perhaps if you are good with interior design we could talk about the
measurements of the furniture in my room and how best to arrange
everything for working at night.

I don't like drawing on the computer. I  used to work in a media lab at
a children's museum and learned to do all that and teach kids how to do
all that, but I still prefer pencil, eraser, sharpener, paper and I
probably always will. I like digital photography for capturing an image
to work off of, but that is about as far as it goes for now in terms of
technology that I choose to use.

I like writing to you because you are another artist and you can accept
my artistic writing. I really don't like engaging in argument and you
never argue with me and I  really appreciate this.

I am happy to be your artistic mentor. I started taking art classes as a
young child at the De Young Museum and never stopped. If you ever come
out here, that would be a fun place to go to together. I love art
museums and have not been to one since I left the city over two years ago.

It has been said that I might like to teach art formally in a decade. I
have taught art to children at a children's museum, and a family
shelter. We shall see what the future holds.

I'll see if I can't audit a class next term.  I'm not in school right
now, the difficulty level at my college might as well be MIT, except
they just teach liberal alternative stuff.  It is amazing how think and
wordy philosophy textbooks can be.  And that's the emphasis at Antioch.

But as for drawing I came up with a great idea.  I'm going to buy some
clear sheets of plastic for drawing on, and by some grease pencils or
other media that can print out on the clear plastic.  Just like
animators use in holywood.  That way it will be like I have a green
screen for my artwork, and the scanner won't pick up the paper.  Plus I
will be able to trace things even better than using tracing paper.
Have you ever heard of this kind of stuff?  Because I'm not sure where
to even by these sorts of supplies, but they will be perfect!

In article &lt;1168309322.024014.181 ... @51g2000cwl.googlegroups.com&gt;,
CoreyWhite took the hamburger meat, threw it on the grill, and I said
"Oh Wow"...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This is my vision of Olympiada in digital charcoal.  I spent a few
&gt; hours visualizing how I imagined her to look, and found a photograph
&gt; that reminded me of my fantasy.  She has been encouraging me lately to
&gt; focus on my art, and fantasies.  So I got out my charcoal set, and drew
&gt; the photo as large as I was able to on a huge sheet of paper.  I tride
&gt; my best to think about the photo as hard as I could and visualize
&gt; myself drawing it in my mind.  But as usual my art is never good
&gt; enough.  So what I did next created something I hope will be adaquet to
&gt; show you how I actually imagine okay.

&gt; Once I scanned the image in I used an artistic technique I've created
&gt; to create a digital copy of it in photoshop.  Then I blended in the
&gt; real photo with my artistic charcoal, so you can't tell there even was
&gt; a real photo.  It looks like truly digitally inspired artwork, they a
&gt; real artist may as well have created.  I just love this technique and I
&gt; hope you all take a look here: http://www.ckoogle.com/atlanta.gif

&gt; If you have any GOOD criticisms let me know so I can continue to work
&gt; on my methods, and create even better works of interactive fantasy in
&gt; the future.

&gt; Tell me what you think especially Atlanta.  Does it look like you? ?

Shadowville Speedway Blues

In a taxi watching a sporting house
Beside a Linwood vacant lot
Silverdollar moon portspotting
Constellation like a sailor's knot.

The sky was black, ink and glitter in the night
Train whine saxophone out beyond the light
I'm in love with a ghost blue turns to grey
Put a pyramid on my head to take my pain away.

Hazel knew the karma, she kept it in a bottle
Now I'm here on the receiving end
At least I still know how to take a joke
And laugh with none of my friends.

Brown Reculse magic drifting around the shed
Someone has it in for me I must not lose my head
Moving with the speedo life several with me left behind
Burned too many bridges defragmented my time.

Somewhere in time I've seen all this before
In a magazine or a dream of a distant war
Manifested destiny a manifesto and a part
All the actors still agree that ever had a heart.

The good book and the fortune telling lady
Black tooth mojo marked index cards
Bundles over the side of Dillingham Bridge
Splashing as ripples reflect from the stars.

Hazel knew the karma she kept it in a bottle
Now I'm here on the receiving end
At least I still know how to take a joke
And laugh with none of my friends.

Never. I had him take it down, never to put it up again. I do not want

Look if you want to know about mysteries, hop on over to
alt.religion.christian.east-orthodox and learn about the Holy Mysteries,
ok? I write there. You can talk with me about God and Mystery there. I
am no mystery. I am a human being. God is the Mystery. Read The Orthodox
Way by Bishop Kallistos (Ware) published by Saint Vladimir's Seminary
Press. It has a whole chapter about God as  Mystery. I think I will read

I will research your writing as time allows. What is "Hasty Pudding"?
What is Docker-Conley? What are Will Dockery videos? I  have a child and
do not have much time to research so I need you to explain things to me
before I go to the web and look them up. My newsgroups are more
important to me then the web right now.

Are you flattering me or teasing me or leading me on? I have not been
very popular on newsgroups up until this point in time and it is also
hard for me to trust anybody. Perhaps we could get to know each other
offline first. I am not saying that to lead you on but to simplify
things for myself. Having a public conversation is much more revealing
than a private conversation. And if you do choose to email me I ask for
personal confidentiality with our correspondence before I reply to your
initial email. I have had huge problems with a particular man in the
past and want to make sure I do not make the same mistake with you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on my methods, and create even better works of interactive fantasy in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the future.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tell me what you think especially Atlanta.  Does it look like you? ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 404

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's nothing there... after all this build-up, let's see the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; art!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Never. I had him take it down, never to put it up again. I do not want
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my visage plastered all over the Internet. It is gone now, never to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; return. It was an error to allow him to do that. I must retain what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little shred of anonymity I have left. As an Orthodox laywoman I am not

Shadowville Speedway Blues

In a taxi watching a sporting house
Beside a Linwood vacant lot
Silverdollar moon portspotting
Constellation like a sailor's knot.

The sky was black, ink and glitter in the night
Train whine saxophone out beyond the light
I'm in love with a ghost blue turns to grey
Put a pyramid on my head to take my pain away.

Hazel knew the karma, she kept it in a bottle
Now I'm here on the receiving end
At least I still know how to take a joke
And laugh with none of my friends.

Brown Reculse magic drifting around the shed
Someone has it in for me I must not lose my head
Moving with the speedo life several with me left behind
Burned too many bridges defragmented my time.

Somewhere in time I've seen all this before
In a magazine or a dream of a distant war
Manifested destiny a manifesto and a part
All the actors still agree that ever had a heart.

The good book and the fortune telling lady
Black tooth mojo marked index cards
Bundles over the side of Dillingham Bridge
Splashing as ripples reflect from the stars.

Hazel knew the karma she kept it in a bottle
Now I'm here on the receiving end
At least I still know how to take a joke

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that reminded me of my fantasy.  She has been encouraging me lately to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; focus on my art, and fantasies.  So I got out my charcoal set, and drew
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the photo as large as I was able to on a huge sheet of paper.  I tride
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my best to think about the photo as hard as I could and visualize
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; myself drawing it in my mind.  But as usual my art is never good

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Once I scanned the image in I used an artistic technique I've created
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to create a digital copy of it in photoshop.  Then I blended in the

Shadowville is a small town in the south, creepy and gothic yet
littered with the cheesy claptrap of modern times... an alternate
reality with you find yourself asking:

"Is this the movie or the dream, or someplace in between?"

Literally, it refers to the old racetrack on what used to be the
outskirts of town, where even the ruins are covered by fast food joints
and houses... a "phantom" place that somehow still exists on another
level.

The heyday was late 1940s-early 1950s, when the "prehistoric" NASCAR
held some races there... by 1957 or so the Speedway was already history
in that way, and many years as nature reclaimed the space it was a
"lover's lane" and general meetup spot for teenagers and assorted
weirdos.

The Brown Recluse is a particularly vicious spider, the lead character
in the poem suspects Hazel (who sometimes takes her practice of natural
and practical magick to obsessive extremes) may have "sent" them in one
way or another.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_recluse_spider

"The brown recluse spider is a venomous spider, Loxosceles reclusa, of
the family Sicariidae (formerly of the family Loxoscelidae). It is
usually between ¼ and ¾ inch (6-20mm) but may grow larger. It is
brown and usually has markings on the dorsal side of its cephalothorax,
with a black line coming from it that looks like a violin with the neck
of the violin pointing to the rear of the spider, resulting in the
nickname "fiddleback spider" or "violin spider". [...] The brown
recluse spider is native to the United States from the southern Midwest
south to the Gulf of Mexico [2] The native range lies roughly south of
a line from southeastern Nebraska through southern Iowa, Illinois, and
Indiana to southwestern Ohio. In the southern states, it is native from
central Texas to western Georgia. They are generally not found west of
the Rocky Mountains.[3] A related species, the brown violin spider
(Loxosceles rufescens), is found in Hawai'i.[4]"

Hasty Pudding

Moving fast but never going anywhere.
Snakeoil barker with no fixed address
Moving fast but going nowhere.
Took a vacation to Shadowville
But nobody ever seen him there.

Mad Hatter in a dunkin' booth
Sneering insults and jeers.
Poet-clown of ill repute
swilled a few too many beers.
He co-opted Lord Byron's swagger
hiding behind crocodile tears.

[interlude]
Doc's talking to himself again
But he never listens.
Just waiting for the night to come
The moon lies but he likes the way she glistens.

Indian Batter's at the plate
Swinging high and wide.
Freakshow escapee
He strikes out and he swallows his pride.
Calls out for another boilermaker
Invisible Rat Pack at his side.

Doolittle ripped up the poem
Threw it into the creek.
Holding conversations with snakes and spiders
And things that never sleep.
They said what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
So he breathes a sigh of relief.

[interlude]
Doc's walking through the same alley again
But this time with good humor.
His crest is a big blue question mark
As he launches this weeks rumor...

Hasty Pudding
Making one last delivery around the horn.
Signpainter for the underworld
He was created but never born.
Jesus turned his tapwater to George Dickel
It keeps him safe and warm.

I was excommunicated by the ruling bishop and reinstated at my request

reinstate me. I had wished him to reinstate me, and he has not yet,
although the Church has. People are fomenting for the Church to
excommunicate me again. I am struggling with the Church right now and
her rules and authority. If you wish to discuss this further, please
strip the cross posting and keep it to alt.gothic.
I have no need to troll. Someone has captured my heart much to my
consternation and I have given it to him and can not take it back and he
has not released me from his service. Furthermore I do not believe women
should troll for men, that's not proper.
Can you please introduce yourself to the group? Thanks.

Which group? It looks like the prior message was cross-posted
all over the place... generally best not to respond in all the
groups; sometimes such x-posting is an attempt (successful or
not) to stir up inter-group flamewars!
