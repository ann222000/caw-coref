HI, I usually just lurk here, but I picked up a Stickley Bros. chair
at a yard sale today and am dying to know if I stumbled onto something
really good or not.

the bottom says Stickley Bros. Grand Rapids and the numbers 1472 1/2.

it has tan nogahyde (sp?) cushions. the frame is wood with four
horizontal slats on the back (is this morris style?). it has straight
slat arms with three spindles. It is a three position chair, I guess
you could call it a recliner except that it really doesn't recline all
that far back. the position is changed by sliding a wooden dowel into
a three position metal bracket located on the back of the arms.

I hope I did an ok job at describing it. I was wondering if anyone
out there had a stickley book and could help me nail the exact style
name so I can do further research on it to determine what it might be
worth. Now for a related question:

the Nogahyde (sp) is sticky on the edges and no matter how much
cleaning I do, it remains sticky. I have only tried soapy water and a
brush. is there something else I can use that won't harm the cushion?
is this something that happens to older nogahyde that cannot be
avoided?

thanks so much!! Sue

Dear Sue,
Someone who knows the ins and outs of Stickleydom would be
a better replyer, but for the moment...
Look at it this way- I am not Mr. Right, but I AM Mr. Right Now. ;)

This sounds like a Morris chair to me. What wood is it made of?
Is it oak, perhaps? Do you think, just from your own personal opinion, that it
has ever been refinished? Please describe in excruciating detail
the origins of this phrase &quot;the bottom says Stickley Bros.&quot;

There is some late, general type, used furniture made by the company
when it was in it's doteage that is priced like used furniture.
(Careful, Trance old boy, one foot in front of the other. Steady, Lad.)
Then there are the many incarnations of the company from Gustave
Stickley to L and, is it JG, Stickley. (
If you find an old scone underneath held on my a sticky bit of jam,
that would be Smuckers. S-m-u-c-k-e-r-s.

So, it isn't Gustave. What came after L and JG or whatever.....

Idle hands are the devil's workshop. Perhaps we shall learn.

And don't sweat the naugahyde (sp?) Your chair originally came with leather.
Turn on Spanish accent, &quot;Rich Corinthian leather!&quot;

&quot;dee plane, dee plane!&quot;

Way to go, Sue. You go girl!
T.

Fayetteville, NY, and as far as I know are still producing furniture,
mainly cherrywood. Guess that really doesn't help at all - sorry!

Sue,
Read the tag on your chair again. I'm afraid that what you have is a
chair by the ' Sticky Brothers'
,an pair that incessantly ingested peanut butter and bubblegum
sandwiches. Not as collectible as Stickley,but once you've acquired
one,they're hard to let go of........... IMO

Try a little lighter fluid on a small spot. Shouldn't hurt the material,
should remove the sticky.
