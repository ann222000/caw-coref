Opps

Did anyone watch Rudds acceptance speech today and cringe a little? he
looked like a stunned mullett too scared to say what he wanted to say and
stuck with the stupid pre-approved phrases.

Maybe he was just nervous and needs some time to get over the spin-speak.
Shit, if he goes on like this for long Jullia will be there to take over

By the sound of it, Rudd is going to bring about &quot;interesting times.&quot;
http://www.theolympian.com/national/story/279769.html

] Rudd, a 50-year-old former diplomat who speaks fluent Chinese,

All the better to serve his true masters.

] Howard, 68, was out of touch with modern Australia and ill-equipped
] to deal with new-age issues such as climate change.

Hell, anyone 68 and older is probably ill-equipped to deal with climate
change.  Crikey, I'm not that old yet but still when the weather is cold
my joints ache.

] fueled by China's and India's hunger for Australia's coal and other
] minerals, and that Rudd could not be trusted to maintain prosperous times.

Those times last as long as you have resources to ship back to China.

] ...few in Rudd's team - including him - has any government experience
] at federal level. His team includes a former rock star - Midnight Oil
] singer Peter Garrett - a television journalist and former union officials.

hmm...

The political reincarnation of a Vegemite sandwich.

Well I hope all you Aussies are happy now.

Befoar too long, you'll be whipped into propar Uighurs.  Chinese speaking
moslems.  But you'll all have nice jobs extracting gold out of smashed up
last year's iPhones in your apartments once they've sucked up all your
natural resources.

Wondar if they will continue making movies down there that try to pass off
Melbourne as Chicago?  Certainly there is some form of leftist logic which
declares that as a sin on some level or othar!

U.S. dollar I'm sure they many fine moving pictures will continue to be made
in your great nation.

onward, forward and beyond

Your friend

I don't agree, personally.  I know, I've seen all the web pages that
say the above.  But the suffix s used in the possessive is a
contraction, from the earlier form &quot;Richard his duck&quot;, meaning the
duck belonging to Richard.  Why is &quot;Richard's duck&quot; right but &quot;it's

&gt; I don't agree, personally.  I know, I've seen all the web pages that
&gt; say the above.  But the suffix s used in the possessive is a
&gt; contraction, from the earlier form &quot;Richard his duck&quot;, meaning the
&gt; duck belonging to Richard.  Why is &quot;Richard's duck&quot; right but &quot;it's
&gt; bill&quot; wrong?
">

Okay, to further conceptualize this idea you've brought forth, it's not
&quot;it his dick,&quot; but rather &quot;its dick.&quot;  I'm assuming that since the
gender specification of &quot;it&quot; is neutral, one cannot imply any sort of
gender without further identifying what &quot;it&quot; is, ergo the lack of an
apostrophe.

&gt;&gt; In the case of the possessive pronoun &quot;its,&quot; it's (notice the
&gt;&gt; contraction of &quot;it is&quot;) not too fucking difficult. Never use an
&gt;&gt; apostrophe with the possessive pronoun &quot;its.&quot; If you see an apostrophe,
&gt;&gt; it had best be the contracted &quot;it is,&quot; otherwise the writer is a retard.

&gt; ..... except when it's a contraction of &quot;it has,&quot; as in &quot;It's been a
&gt; long time.&quot;

&quot;It is,&quot; &quot;it has,&quot; &quot;it was,&quot; who gives a shit? If it's a contraction of
one of the verb forms of &quot;to be&quot; used with the gender-neutral pronoun
&quot;it,&quot; then the apostrophe is appropriate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Remembering that exception ruined a perfectly glorious song I was
&gt; writing on the subject.  Chorus (imagine a boy soprano's voice,
&gt; soaring over a classical arrangement): &quot;I ... T ... apostrophe S means
&gt; 'It i.i.is,' 'It i.i.is.'&quot;

&gt; Favorite line: &quot;Once you have mastered the ways of IT, the world is
&gt; your antecedent!&quot;

Then why wouldn't it be &quot;Susan'r duck&quot; or something?  It isn't, it's
&quot;Susan's duck&quot;.

Anyway the point, to me, is just that the rule of thumb all those web
sites cite, &quot;if it isn't a contraction, there shouldn't be an
apostrophe&quot;, which sounds nice and obvious and common-sense, doesn't
hold up if you think about it.
