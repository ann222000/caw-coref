So, my nan got out of hospital last night and this morning I went
round to help her out round the house.

When I'm round at hers, I often chuck kitchen scraps out front for the
local black-backed gulls. This of course hasn't been happening for
over a week because I've had no reason to go round there.

Went today and one of these cheeky larine fuckers spotted me and
followed me all the way from the bus stop to the house, hanging in the
air directly above me and squawking. Then it sat on the roof and began
bobbing its head up and down (like a baby gull) whilst whining loudly
and sounding very miserable.

I went inside and I could still hear the gull begging. It carried on
for an hour or so until I threw it a couple of crusts to shut it up.

You've got to admire his/her persistence.

Of course I did. It's a seagull. :)

My nan loves to see them up close too.

I'm not planning on it. I'm way too ill-tempered, irresponsible and
maladjusted - *and* I have several bad habits that I don't really want
to give up. I also find babies and young children very annoying.

Don't disrespect the gulls. Sure, they *do* fly in, make a lot of
noise and shit all over everything too - but they also have the common
sense to fuck off afterwards...

over the Ohio River from Kentucky to Ohio

Ever see them riding the slipstreams of cars and lorries, swooping
sideways down the white line in the middle of the road or using the
wind/thermals/updrafts in order to glide backwards without even
flapping their wings once? They are incredibly impressive fliers...

There's also something very noble and stately about the way gulls
carry themselves - until they open their mouths or get close to
another gull, that is. :)

Still, the black-backs are magnificent birds. Check out the size of
them!
