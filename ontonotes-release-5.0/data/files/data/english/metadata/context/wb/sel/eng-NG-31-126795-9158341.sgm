*Mining squad*

BHUBANESWAR, Oct. 3: A mining squad christened as State Mining Enforcement
squad will be formed, with in a month, to check smuggling and illegal
trading of minerals, announced steel and mines minister Mr. Padmanav Behera
here today. The squad, to be headed by a mining officer, will comprise of 12
police officers and one forest range officer. Presiding over a meeting to
discuss this issue, Mr. Behera informed that funds have been allocated in
the budget for the squad. n sns

&gt; *Dark side of mining *

&gt; TEXT AND PHOTOGRAPHS BY AMAN SETHI

&gt;   *The reality of Orissa's iron ore mines, where the promise of prosperity
&gt; is just empty rhetoric. *

&gt;   *FRONTLINE* *Volume 24 - Issue 9 :: May. 05-18, 2007
&gt; *INDIA'S NATIONAL MAGAZINE

&gt; *Hundreds of hectares of forests have been lost to mining over the years
&gt; in a situation where encroachments are impossible to monitor. The most
&gt; common illegality is to continue mining long after the lease has ended. *

&gt; AS the shadows lengthen on Keonjhar's main street, the tube-lit sign above
&gt; Hotel Arjun flickers to life, illuminating both the entrance to the hotel
&gt; and the cigarette seller next to it. A traffic policeman walks up to the
&gt; crossing right outside the hotel and assumes his position at what is the
&gt; most significant crossing in town.

&gt; Fifteen kilometres down the road, the ground shivers as a queue of trucks,
&gt; over a kilometre long, shudders to life. Engine after engine revs up as
&gt; several hundred trucks begin the next stage of their 325-km journey from the
&gt; iron-rich Keonjhar district in north Orissa to Paradip port on the east
&gt; coast. This has been the practice ever since the District Magistrate issued
&gt; orders prohibiting truck movement between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Further up,
&gt; the highway narrows into the first of many bottlenecks, and branches off,
&gt; capillary-like, into un-metalled paths that lead into the heart of the
&gt; district's iron ore mines.

&gt; Across the Baitarani river, in Joda, Barbil, Deojhar and Thakurani, the
&gt; low mountains are illuminated by high-powered halogens, as work continues at
&gt; a relentless pace in the mines - visible as raw, red gashes on the otherwise
&gt; thickly forested mountainside.

&gt; The source of an estimated 35 per cent of India's total reserves of
&gt; haematite, Orissa produced more than 46 million tonnes of iron ore in
&gt; 2004-05, of which three quarters came from Keonjhar. Almost all of it was,
&gt; and still is, carted away in nearly 30,000 trucks from the 119 mines that
&gt; dot the district.

&gt; The trucks move north from Joda, to the Jharkhand border where they supply
&gt; ore to Jharkhand's rapidly expanding steel industry, and northwest to Haldia
&gt; port. But the majority move south through Keonjhar town towards Cuttack and
&gt; cut through to Paradip port, from where the ore is shipped in containers to
&gt; one of the few countries that have a bigger appetite for steel than India -
&gt; China.

&gt; Initially seen as the engine of an independent India - the first
&gt; &quot;swadeshi&quot; steel mill was completed in 1920 by the Tata Iron and Steel
&gt; Company at Jamshedpur in present-day Jharkhand just across the border with
&gt; Orissa - it was cast into the shadows by the shining &quot;new economy&quot; of the
&gt; 1990s.

&gt; A five-year rally in international prices has seen the iron and steel
&gt; sector make a strong return on the business pages of newspapers.

&gt; Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pointed out in his keynote address at the
&gt; India Steel Summit 2007: &quot;In the last five years, the production and
&gt; consumption of steel has grown at rates exceeding 9 per cent per annum. The
&gt; pace of growth has further accelerated in the current year to over 10 per
&gt; cent.&quot;

&gt; The recently formulated national steel policy has set the production
&gt; target for 2020 at 110 million tonnes of steel, and a doubling of the
&gt; present capacity from around 40 million tonnes to 80 million tonnes by 2012.

&gt; A buoyant national economy and a booming construction sector are expected
&gt; to add to the optimism in the steel sector, and nowhere is this felt more
&gt; than in the office of Padmanabha Behera, Orissa's Minister of Steel and
&gt; Mines and Planning and Coordination. &quot;We have signed 45 MoUs [Memoranda of
&gt; Understanding] till date,&quot; he told this correspondent, &quot;and production has
&gt; already started in 23.&quot;

&gt; The Minister foresees a resurgent Orissa, propelled forward by his party's
&gt; mantra of &quot;progress through industrialisation&quot;. Behera believes that
&gt; Orissa's future lies in using its vast mineral wealth to generate employment
&gt; and, of course, create wealth. However, not everyone in the State shares
&gt; this vision.

&gt; Privilege and corruption

&gt;  AMAN SETHI

&gt; *Work apace on Jindal's 9-km-long pipeline along the road to Deojhar to
&gt; draw water from the Baitarani river. The State Water Department had asked
&gt; the company to stop the work and government officials initially insisted
&gt; that all work had stopped. But later they said the matter was under
&gt; litigation. *

&gt; To understand Orissa's trucks is to understand how privilege and
&gt; corruption operate along dense, intricate networks where the legal and the
&gt; illegal often overlap, making it impossible to make a concrete accusation.
&gt; After all, what is an illegal mine? How can it be identified?

&gt; &quot;It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that
&gt; the Union should take under its control the regulation of mines and the
&gt; development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided,&quot; states the
&gt; preamble to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, one of
&gt; a raft of laws and bylaws passed to govern the mining sector.

&gt; First enacted in 1957, and amended almost every four years up to 1999, the
&gt; MMDR Act serves as the central axis on which mining law is framed. The Act
&gt; classifies minerals into &quot;minor&quot; and &quot;major&quot; lists, lays down procedures for
&gt; the granting of reconnaissance permits, prospecting licences and mining
&gt; leases, and classifies violations and encroachments. While States have
&gt; complete control over all minor minerals such as clay, gravel, sand and
&gt; building stones, major minerals such as iron ore come under the purview of
&gt; the Central government. For such minerals, Central permission is required
&gt; prior to the granting of licence.

&gt; Apart from the MMDR Act, mining is subject to The Mines Act of 1952, the
&gt; National Mineral Policy (amended in 1994), and a slew of laws concerning
&gt; land acquisition and environmental assessment.

&gt; Acquiring a mining lease for a major mineral like iron ore or coal for a
&gt; particular area is relatively easy now. The process has been simplified over
&gt; the last 10 years, a development that has coincided with the liberalisation
&gt; of the mining sector. Mining leases are granted on a `first-come,
&gt; first-serve' basis, and the foreign direct investment (FDI) policy of 1999
&gt; allows for &quot;up to 100 per cent foreign direct investment&quot; in the mining and
&gt; processing of minerals other than diamond, precious stones and atomic
&gt; minerals. Thus, mining occupies a unique governmental space that is
&gt; simultaneously highly legislated yet remarkably free of constraints for mine
&gt; operators.

&gt; Under the laws governing mining, mines could be declared &quot;illegal&quot; on a
&gt; number of grounds, the most obvious being that of mining in an area without
&gt; applying for a lease. However, the pressure of rapid industrialisation has
&gt; forced State governments to curb such practices.

&gt; Illegal mines

&gt; &quot;No illegal mining is possible without political patronage,&quot; says a senior
&gt; officer in the Directorate of Mines, &quot;and local politicians have realised
&gt; that the land occupied by illegal miners can just as easily be handed over
&gt; to giant corporations for similar favours.&quot; This is not to say that outright
&gt; capture of areas for mining has stopped entirely in the iron belt. The most
&gt; common examples of illegal mining occur on the boundary of legality, where
&gt; the violator can claim a degree of innocence on the basis of ignorance of
&gt; the law.

&gt; The most common form of illegality is to continue mining long after the
&gt; lease has expired. A document obtained from the Directorate of Mines under
&gt; the Right to Information Act provides a complete list of mining leases in
&gt; Keonjhar. According to the Directorate's own figures, dated December 31,
&gt; 2005, as many as 52 out of 119 mines, or more than 40 per cent of all mines
&gt; in Keonjhar district covering 52 per cent of leased area, operate illegally
&gt; on expired licences. Of these 52 mines, 10 belong to the Orissa Mining
&gt; Corporation (OMC), a government-owned enterprise, and operate on 7,051
&gt; hectares (1 hectare = 2.47 acres) or a fifth of the total area under
&gt; mining in the district.

&gt; Many in the industry argue that the issue of expired licences is not an
&gt; indication of corruption *per se* as the government has been dragging its
&gt; feet for years over their renewal. The failure to renew leases, particularly
&gt; those held by a State-owned corporation, seems inexplicable until one
&gt; unpacks the terms of the mining lease.

&gt; As pointed out by Ritwick Dutta in a compilation titled &quot;Undermining
&gt; India&quot;, the renewal of mining leases in forested areas has been the subject
&gt; of much litigation since the enactment of the Forest Conservation Act of
&gt; 1980. Given that most mines, including those in Keonjhar, fall within the
&gt; purview of this Act, the key question was whether the renewal of a mining
&gt; lease required fresh permission of the Central government. The Supreme
&gt; Court, in successive judgments, particularly in *State of Tamil Nadu vs
&gt; Hind Stones* in 1981 and *Samatha vs State of Andhra Pradesh* in 1997, has
&gt; ruled that the renewal of a mining lease is actually the grant of a fresh
&gt; lease. Thus, a good reason for mining companies and associated State
&gt; officials to go slow on the renewal of leases could be that, theoretically,
&gt; the company shall have to reapply at the time of renewal and would be
&gt; subject to monitoring by the Central Pollution Control Board, the Ministry
&gt; of Environment and Forests and a host of other agencies.

&gt; Forest Act and mining

&gt; The Forest Conservation Act mandates that the Central government shall
&gt; after careful examination of the proposal denotify forest land earmarked for
&gt; mining and the mining company shall be subject to a series of restrictions
&gt; to minimise the ecological footprint of the mine. It is also a useful tool
&gt; to ensure that the mining companies stay within the areas allotted to them.
&gt; Of course, the Forest Act, like any other Act, is only as good as its
&gt; implementation.

&gt; Another document from the Directorate of Mines lists 40 mines in Keonjhar
&gt; that are operating without clearance from the Forest Department; the OMC,
&gt; once more, is one of the worst violators. District Forest Officer P.N.
&gt; Karat says that as of February 2006 all such cases have been dealt with.
&gt; However, this assessment is impossible to verify independently. In the
&gt; absence of firm leases, many companies have been granted temporary licences,
&gt; most of which are issued without guidelines or monitoring.

&gt; The absence of adequate monitoring is probably the most disturbing feature
&gt; of the industry in Orissa. The highly technical language adopted by both the
&gt; mining companies and the state effectively silences any local articulation
&gt; of opposition by people directly affected by the projects. Thus, people's
&gt; testimonies of a change in the colour of groundwater, an increase in the
&gt; cases of asthma and respiratory conditions and a drop in the fertility of
&gt; their fields are discounted in favour of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM)
&gt; readings collected by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) and the
&gt; findings of groundwater studies conducted by the State Groundwater Board
&gt; that pollution is present but is within the mandated safety limit.

&gt; Barbil, to cite just one example, is a small town in the heart of the
&gt; mining belt where it is difficult to breathe freely even during the day when
&gt; the trucks do not run. But a study obtained from the SPCB states that the
&gt; SPM readings in Barbil are &quot;only&quot; 456 micrograms per cubic metre against a
&gt; reference value of 500 micrograms per cubic metre for mining areas, and so
&gt; is acceptable. However, the Central Pollution Control Board reference value
&gt; for &quot;residential and rural areas&quot; - which villages outside the mines are -
&gt; is 200 micrograms per cubic metre and for a reserve forest, which could be
&gt; classified as a &quot;sensitive area&quot; under the SPCB guidelines, it is 100
&gt; micrograms per cubic metre. Thus, the same arbitrarily fixed &quot;standards&quot;
&gt; used to declare mining areas &quot;pollution free&quot; can just as easily be used to
&gt; declare them unfit for human habitation.

&gt; Similarly, the only way to verify if a mining area corresponds to the area
&gt; mentioned in the mining lease is to either refer to detailed contour maps in
&gt; the possession of the government (and hence unavailable to the general
&gt; public) or physically plot the coordinates of the mine using a global
&gt; positioning system (GPS), which no one in Orissa has access to. Such opacity
&gt; on the part of all privilege-holders in the system makes its impossible to
&gt; level definite accusations against any party. But, as in all camouflaged
&gt; sites, in Orissa, too, the veil slips occasionally to offer a glimpse of the
&gt; arrogance of mining corporations *vis-à-vis* the law.

&gt; Road to nowhere

&gt; *Ferrous dust, one of the biggest polluters in Keonjhar. *

&gt; The road to Deojhar, as with most roads to hell, is paved with the best of
&gt; intentions. Ostensibly built to connect Deojhar village to the highway under
&gt; the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana Scheme, it has turned out to be a
&gt; useful way to connect the mines to the national highway.

&gt; Few villagers use this road; there are too many trucks. Of late, the
&gt; trucks plying on the Deojhar-NH 215 route have had to contend with more than
&gt; just crater-size potholes - a fleet of bright orange earthmovers engaged in
&gt; digging deep trenches along the road. These vehicles have been employed by
&gt; the Jindal company, a consortium of companies with interests primarily in
&gt; iron, steel and power, to supply water to their 2,000-hectare iron ore mine
&gt; in the hills above Deojhar village.

&gt; &quot;Jindal is laying a nine-kilometre pipeline to draw water from the
&gt; Baitarani river,&quot; says Arjun Saraswat, deputy general manager of Sarda Mines
&gt; Private Ltd., the company that possesses the lease for the Jindal land.
&gt; &quot;This water will be made available through the soon-to-be-completed Kanpur
&gt; dam project.&quot; At the time of this article going to print, the digging was
&gt; almost complete and pipes two feet ( 0.61 metre) in diameter had been laid
&gt; along a stretch of 4.5 km.

&gt; But has Jindal acquired the necessary permissions for this pipeline?

&gt; &quot;The Jindal company's demand for water has been approved `in principle',&quot;
&gt; says Harish Behera, Engineer-in-Chief (Water Resources) for Orissa. &quot;But the
&gt; technical parameters are to be worked out. No permission has been granted
&gt; for any pipeline and, as of now, no project work has begun.&quot; Behera is
&gt; responsible for the allocation of water resources for the entire State, but
&gt; seems to be unaware that the pipeline work has not only begun but is nearing
&gt; completion. When confronted with photographs on the project work taken by
&gt; this correspondent, he said &quot;the matter is currently under litigation&quot;.

&gt; What sort of litigation? For answers, one is directed to C.V. Prasad,
&gt; Chief Engineer, Project Planning and Formulation, of the Orissa Water
&gt; Department (Irrigation). Prasad is more forthcoming. &quot;Jindal has been
&gt; allotted 1,500 cubic metres of water an hour, drawn in a phased manner, from
&gt; the Baitarani river project, but the project is still awaiting technical
&gt; clearance. As of now, the construction is in violation of the law,&quot; he says.
&gt; Prasad adds that his office has written to the company several times asking
&gt; it to stop construction, most recently on January 16. &quot;We were under the
&gt; impression that construction had stopped.&quot;

&gt; Granting a project approval &quot;in principle&quot; is no indication of its merits
&gt; or demerits; those are only evaluated in the technical approval stage when a
&gt; detailed project report (DPR) is submitted. &quot;In principle&quot; approval only
&gt; indicates that the company may go ahead and prepare a DPR. If Jindal's
&gt; pipeline does not pass muster the company will be forced to remove it. In
&gt; going ahead with the project, it believes, perhaps, that government approval
&gt; is a foregone conclusion or that such approval is of little importance.

&gt; The Baitarani pipeline also begs another question. At present, where is
&gt; Jindal drawing its water from? Deputy general manager Arjun Saraswat admits
&gt; that Jindal is currently drawing water from borewells in their area, but is
&gt; unwilling to quantify the volume of water drawn every day. &quot;It is only used
&gt; for domestic purposes,&quot; he says. However, officials at the SPCB office in
&gt; Keonjhar reveal that Jindal uses a 10-kilolitre truck to carry out water
&gt; sprinkling three times a day in the mining area, that is, 30,000 litres of
&gt; water a day just for sprinkling.

&gt; Apart from this, the scale of the mining operation, with most of the
&gt; permanent workers living in the mining area, suggests a reasonably high rate
&gt; of water consumption even for domestic purposes. Even Jindal probably does
&gt; not know how much water it uses because none of its tubewells is metered.
&gt; However, one group of people has a fair idea.

&gt; Deojhar's sorrow

&gt; Down the road from the mines, the residents of Deojhar have seen their
&gt; streams dry up, the water table fall and the soil lose its fertility in the
&gt; six years since Jindal began operations. &quot;The very basis of village life has
&gt; fallen apart since the project began,&quot; says Sridhar Nayak, a leader in
&gt; Deojhar. The crops have died, there is no place to graze cattle, people
&gt; cannot collect firewood in the project area and the handpumps yield foul,
&gt; yellowish water. Nayak says the inevitable dust that any project breeds has
&gt; severely affected the health of the residents, particularly the young, among
&gt; whom the number of cases of lung congestion has increased.

&gt; When the project first began, protests were quelled by a combination of
&gt; cajoling and coercion. A significant police presence was backed by promises
&gt; of jobs, economic regeneration, security and &quot;progress&quot;. Needless to say,
&gt; none of it has materialised except, of course, the police, who regularly
&gt; show up in impressive numbers to threaten `errant' residents.

&gt; The promise of prosperity - schools, hospitals, jobs - is usually the
&gt; classic argument used to justify the well-documented horrors of mining.
&gt; Minerals are a country's natural wealth, a gift from Mother Nature, a
&gt; precious resource crucial to a nation's progress. The booming international
&gt; market for metals has also cast mines and minerals as earners of valuable
&gt; foreign exchange. It is hard to unpack the cold, hard logic of capital and
&gt; corporations without sounding like a hopeless rural idealist. However, the
&gt; people of Orissa are now asking who the beneficiaries of the mining sector
&gt; really are. What if mining did not benefit the people it affected the worst?
