The story line was more realistic in this one, and the acting was
better!

Quentin Tarantino wrote this exchange between two movie buffs:
Sid: You want subversion on a massive level. You know what one of the
greatest fucking scripts ever written in the history of Hollywood is?
Top Gun.
Duane: Oh, come on.
Sid: Top Gun is fucking great. What is Top Gun? You think it's a story
about a bunch of fighter pilots.
Duane: It's about a bunch of guys waving their dicks around.
Sid: It is a story about a man's struggle with his own homosexuality.
It is! That is what Top Gun is about, man. You've got Maverick, all
right? He's on the edge, man. He's right on the fucking line, all
right? And you've got Iceman, and all his crew. They're gay, they
represent the gay man, all right? And they're saying, go, go the gay
way, go the gay way. He could go both ways.
Duane: What about Kelly McGillis?
Sid: Kelly McGillis, she's heterosexuality. She's saying: no, no, no,
no, no, no, go the normal way, play by the rules, go the normal way.
They're saying no, go the gay way, be the gay way, go for the gay way,
all right? That is what's going on throughout that whole movie... He
goes to her house, all right? It looks like they're going to have sex,
you know, they're just kind of sitting back, he's takin' a shower and
everything. They don't have sex. He gets on the motorcycle, drives
away. She's like, "What the fuck, what the fuck is going on here?"
Next scene, next scene you see her, she's in the elevator, she is
dressed like a guy. She's got the cap on, she's got the aviator
glasses, she's wearing the same jacket that the Iceman wears. She is,
okay, this is how I gotta get this guy, this guy's going towards the
gay way, I gotta bring him back, I gotta bring him back from the gay
way, so I'll do that through subterfuge, I'm gonna dress like a man.
All right? That is how she approaches it.  All right, but the REAL
ending of the movie is when they fight the MIGs at the end, all right?
Because he has passed over into the gay way. They are this gay
fighting fucking force, all right? And they're beating the Russians,
the gays are beating the Russians. And it's over, and they fucking
land, and Iceman's been trying to get Maverick the entire time, and
finally, he's got him, all right? And what is the last fucking line
that they have together? They're all hugging and kissing and happy
with each other, and Ice comes up to Maverick, and he says, "Man, you
can ride my tail, anytime!" And what does Maverick say? "You can ride
mine!" Swordfight! Swordfight! Fuckin' A, man!

Is it true the chick was a transsexual?  I know... don't ask, don't tell.

When I saw "Top Gun" at the theater I got hassled for pointing out to
my friend how there were no even MiG designations (MiG-28) and that
the plane was a painted US a/c. I also laughed mockingly at the
"inverted" picture taking scene. I was going, "WTF???!!!"

The back row wanted to kill me.

This was in the Reagan era and the crowd was filled with patriots.
Although I was a firm right-winger myself... I was more of an avid
movie fan, so I nit-picked anyway.

Same shit happened to me in "Rambo" when he dropped the AK in the mud
with the safety on!

&gt; I happen to agree with Quentin - I kept expecting to see all the body-
&gt; builder RIOs suddenly soap up and back into each other.  The movie
&gt; couldn't have been gayer if it tried.  All the chest-puffing and
&gt; strutting made me a bit queasy.  I spent my career in the same hangar
&gt; as hundreds of Navy pilots and I didn't see a single one of them
&gt; represented in that movie.  Anybody that acted like those cardboard
&gt; actors would have been grounded and reassigned for behaving like
&gt; that.  In my experience, 95% of Navy airmen were complex thinking
&gt; machines with fast reflexes and amazingly quick powers of decision.
&gt; The other 5% didn't meet that standard, but they were usually easy to
&gt; spot and avoid.

&gt; For my $6, there should have been 120 minutes of Turkeys yankin' and
&gt; bankin' with Scooters, followed by a mass shoot down of black F-5s,
&gt; with the grand finale being, of course, an F9F crashing on the fantail
&gt; of an old straight deck carrier...

&gt; _that's_ entertainment...

I remember being surprised about the Top Gun reference in Ward
Carroll's "Punk's Wing" where, IIRC, a  RIO instructor says something
like "Top Gun changed my life" without a trace of irony. I believe the
point was  seeing the movie had led to his choosing naval aviation.

It's fiction of course, but Carroll did spend 15 years as a RIO.

If you get the DVD and listen to the commentary version of the movie, the
director comes right out and says that was his goal.

Ya know guys ........I've seen that movie several times since it was
released and I missed all of that.

Even took the girlfriend,  (who eventually became the wife)  under the 'one
movie for him, one for her' rule.

I swear if I have to see any more remakes of "Pride &amp; Predjudice" or movies
with Johnny Depp,  I'll be wanting to take it up the bum.      I wonder if
that's what Tarantino really meant ?
