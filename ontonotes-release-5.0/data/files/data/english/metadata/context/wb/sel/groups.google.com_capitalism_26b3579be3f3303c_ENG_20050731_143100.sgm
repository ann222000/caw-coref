Dear Dave and other respondents to &quot;Honest money,
A red herring for Americans?&quot;

The keynote of that post, which no one addressed,
was as follows:

&quot;Only the English speaking publics seem to find
the attached (Fig8d.gif) geometric view of a
shortage of purchasing power incomprehensible.&quot;

Thanks again Dave for your thoughtful analysis
forwarded below, and for consulting the Curtiss
Priest web site to conclude that my understanding
of subsidiarity is nonsense. Below your current
analysis I have copied your response of 11-06-2005
to my earlier explanation of how the principle of
subsidiarity is used by the English speaking WHIPs
to steal 3-5% of GDP in purchasing power from
US parenting families. Your earlier response
seemed more nearly in accord with the goals of
Distributism and RERUM NOVARUM, while
your current response might have been formulated
by Chatham House, Pratt House, or the White House.

At the foot of this post, I'll take another shot at
sharpening the focus of Fig8d.gif as applied to
non-competitive pricing in the US labor market,
and to perfectly competitive pricing of US
corporate products and services. Please find
[WSB comment WSB] inserted where helpful for
connecting things together.

Dear Wes

Having looked at your explanatory text via the Curtiss Priest web site, I
have to say you are talking nonsense about Subsidiarity, and where you
got it from I can't imagine, given that original (1931) statement of it
is available at  www.papalencyclicals.net .

[WSB I am sure that the definition in that web
site agrees with the definition of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops in #4 below. WSB]

&gt;But the positive &quot;gap,&quot; or deficiency of &quot;purchasing &gt;power&quot; among low
income parenting households is
&gt;created by the &quot;Christian Principle of Subsidiarity&quot;
&gt;which prohibits the issue of social credit to families
&gt;with an income higher than the break-even point for
&gt;the family size, as illustrated on Fig8 of the attached
&gt;file. This positive &quot;gap,&quot; a &quot;shortage of purchasing
&gt;power;&quot; creates the rat race of intense competition,
&gt;diminishes profitable capital investments, and
&gt;combines with the minimum wage to increase
&gt;unemployment.

[WSB Subsidiarity has my whole hearted support
when it argues for the benefits of decentralization
in the government, the corporation, or any other association. But the
technical requirements for
achieving effective decentralization which must
be satisfied may be read in P. A. Samuelson's books
but are never acknowledged in our public debate. WSB]

&gt;The negative &quot;gap,&quot; on the other hand, is a surplus
&gt;of &quot;purchasing &gt;power&quot; among high income families,
&gt;with or without dependent children. All monetary
&gt;and political reformers see the positive 'gap.&quot; But
&gt;the negative &quot;gap&quot; is transparent to reformers,
&gt;because the surplus money from the negative &quot;gap&quot;
&gt;inflates the prices of existing wealth and creates
&gt;the delusion of growth.

Subsidiarity has nothing to do with money. It is the principle that
policy decisions should be made at the lowest practicable level of the
political hierarchy, i.e. by the persons directly affected by and/or
responsible for them. The rationale of this is that when policies are
wrong (as some inevitably will be) the policymaking community will be
directly affected and so motivated and have the information to correct
itself. However, international and infra-structure decisions in
particular depend on non-local knowledge, so that here the appropriate
decision-makers are those with access to relevant information and
monitoring facilities. The point of &quot;subsidiarity&quot; is to insist that the
right of authorities to make these &quot;high level&quot; decisions does not imply
any right to make the innumerable lower-level decisions where locals will
necessarily be better informed than the government. The functions and
&quot;powers&quot; of government should be seen as specialist, not all-embracing.

[WSB Subsidiarity has my whole hearted support
when it argues for the benefits of decentralization
in the government, the corporation, or any other association. But the
technical requirements for
achieving effective decentralization have not
changed since Henry Carter Adams discussed
them in his 1887 essay &quot;Relation Of The State
To Industrial Action. These technical requirements
were first brought to my attention in 1953 by
engineers in the electric power industry. As
suggested on Fig8d,gif, effective decentralization,
requires the fixed costs of development to be
charged to a higher level of the organization
(corporation or government) to prevent parenting
families or start-up product lines from being
priced out of the market. WSB]

The point you are making in the second paragraph here is interesting,
although I think you are oversimplifying the final &quot;because&quot;. Some of
the surplus money is reinvested to increase real wealth-making capacity
and hence real growth. What drives the process, however, is &quot;interest&quot;
or &quot;profit&quot; on merely financial investment, which under present
legislation continues even when there is no real need for further
wealth-making capacity. (The only continuing need, which is not a
necessary one but arises from the way we currently conduct our affairs,
is for traders to be able to acquire a living). Without increasingly
unnecessary production and consumption of wealth, the only ways of paying
interest are to increase &quot;the prices of existing wealth&quot; or to incur
further debt. On the evidence, both mechanisms are operative.

[WSB I agree. The traders will have to look
for honesr work. WSB]

&gt;Since I opened this inquiry in 1969 I have been
&gt;keenly aware that the monetary system and the
&gt;voluminous monetary data collected by the F.R.B.
&gt;and banking industry is the only window we
&gt;have for seeing how the economy operates. If
&gt;the US taxpayers decided tomorrow to extend the
&gt;standard financial policies of corporations to their
&gt;government, the consequences would be seen by the
&gt;public, the media, and the economics profession
&gt;as monetary reform.

I don't agree with this point from your latest letter, either, Wes. As I
see it, pure theory is independent of its applications, and applied
theory amounts to asserting that A is of type B, eg. money is a
representation of whole numbers and hence of countable quantities, not a
function of differentiable value. There is thus another, more open and
productive window on the operations of the economy in analogous
applications of the same pure theory. If one is prepared to consider
that the economy is a control system, one can examine how electrical
control systems work or go wrong, and thereby both recognise and explain
patterns in the operation of the economy.

[WSB The pure theory was discovered by H. C.
Adams and again by P. A. Samuelson and has not
changed since Moses wrote it down as the first
tithe for development and local government.
The second tithe, for the law makers, supports the
principle of Subsidiarity only when the lawmakers
contribute towards the first tithe. WSB]

Best wishes

Dave

On Leavitt's Diamond (Dave's reply to #3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~ Snip by Wes Burt ~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Before we get to the above mentioned &quot;faulty
&gt;application&quot; of the Christian Principle of
&gt;Subsidiarity, here is the way &quot;Subsidiarity&quot;
&gt;is defined by the National Conference of
&gt;Catholic Bishops, Washington, D.C., in their
&gt;book, ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR ALL, 1986:

&quot;Just as it is gravely wrong to take from
individuals what they can accomplish
by their own initiative and industry and
give it to the community, so also it is an
injustice and at the same time a grave
evil and disturbance of right order to
assign to a greater and higher association
what lesser and subordinate organizations
can do. For every social activity aught of
its very nature to furnish help (subsidium)
to the members of the organization, and
never destroy and absorb them.&quot;

The one defence I will make of this is that it
is true if taken in the &quot;all or nothing&quot; sense of
Aristotelian logic. The context is rejection
of both Russian-style communism and
Western-style &quot;bread and circuses&quot; imperialism.

[WSB No comment made in this post WSB]

&gt;When taken at face value, without serious
&gt;consideration of the prerequisites for a
&gt;profitable and stable corporate structure,
&gt;the above definition of &quot;Subsidiarity&quot; does
&gt;two things:

&gt;a, It turns the public mind against taxes or
&gt;tithes, thereby negating Louis Blanc's
&gt;&quot;governing principle of the state,&quot; which
&gt;added the two moral Commandments needed
&gt;to change the Ten Commandments (Decalogue)
&gt;into the Whole Divine Law as illustrated
&gt;in Fig7-9h.gif.

Yes.

&gt;b, It makes the concept of a &quot;supplement to
&gt;earned income from the public revenue;&quot; as
&gt;proposed by Thomas Paine, P. M. Pitt-the
&gt;younger, Pope Leo X III, Bertrand Russell,
&gt;Sir John Wally KBE CB, and Pope John
&gt;Paul II &quot;a grave evil and disturbance of
&gt;right order.&quot;

Yes. Lots of naive clerics have been taken in
by neo-Conservative propaganda. The &quot;grave
evil&quot; is in fact to take this out of the context
of &quot;the reciprocity of rights and duties&quot; and
thus ignore the need for leaders to provide
or facilitate suitable types of mutual service.

[WSB No comment made in this post WSB]

&gt;Now Dave, the seventh of our thirty-nine
&gt;articles of religion reads, in part:

&quot;no Christian man whatsoever is free from
the obedience of the Commandments
which are called Moral.&quot;

Your 39 Articles, but yes, including that which I have snipped.

[Relevant introduction brought forward]
Following Dave's #2 post, I'll try again to
effectively present my understanding of that
part of the Whole Divine Law which was
withheld from the public three thousand years
ago by the &quot;Folly of Rehoboam&quot; (I Kings 12), and
is not yet restored to our public debate.

I am not a person who thinks in stories, Wes,
but I do appreciate a good one. Thanks for
this. As one of your &quot;elders&quot; I continue trying
to offer the good advice because if it isn't
offered it can't be taken. If it is still not taken,
the matter is (as in your story) in God's hands.

[WSB No comment made in this post WSB]

&gt;Tell me where this model is in error, Dave,
&gt;so I'll know why it is unacceptable to the
&gt;comfortable class who are not yet convinced
&gt;that poor folks are of the same species as
&gt;themselves.

I'm not saying your models are in error, Wes,
just that they are limited (dare I say, not
&quot;catholic&quot;?). I entirely agree the significance
of the problem you pose, but unfortunately I
am as much in the dark as you are about
how to resolve it. Pray?

Kind regards,

Dave

Visualize, if you can, the attached Fig8d.gif with
a continuous flow of recent graduates entering
the work force from the left of the chart. Each
one is deep in debt. They owe $6,500X12 =
$78,000 to their local community for 12 years
of public education. They owe $100,952 to
their parents for 17 years of subsistence and
health care. That's $178,962 just for High
School grads. University grads will owe an
additional $60,000 to their parents or some
Shylock institution for a four year degree.
Casting a Jew as Shylock nicely serves the
purposes of the larger number of Shylocks
in every other religion or nationality.
For the purpose of this discussion, a Shylock
is a smart fellow who evaded his taxes and
consequently has a lot of extra money in his
carpet bag with which to buy up the property
of folks caught in a financial bind or a caught
in a nation that lost a war. The Shylocks would
collapse the real economy by withholding M0
if they hoarded their money, so they keep it
circulating in the real economy by lending it
to parenting families and students or using it
for speculation. Any serious monetary reformer
would notice that public education is an interest-
free loan. Subsistence and medical care for
dependent children should also be an interest-
free loan, as the 1942 G. I. Bill was an interes-
free loan of tuition and subsistence to veterans
of World War II.

As a non-Catholic, I am embarassed to admit that
the Church Of Rome has clearly spelled out in
their literature both the driving mechanism of the
century old US status quo (means tested welfare
and prisons) and the 4,000 year old alternative to
the status quo which the Shylocks say does not exist.

Why arn't the Catholics beating down the doors of
Congress to get the &quot;Family Wage&quot; or C. H. Douglas'
Social Credit Dividend established in the US?

Kind regards,

Wes Burt
