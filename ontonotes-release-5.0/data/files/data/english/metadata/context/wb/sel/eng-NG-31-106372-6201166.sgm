Hi,
I was wondering if someone could tell me more about "Jury
Nullification".  Another juror was telling us it is a "defacto" jury
power, and we can decide what we feel is right.  Is this right?
Quick reply appreciated.

Jury nullification is one of those cultural myths that survives not
because it has any validity, but because some people just want to
believe in it no matter what, like crop circles and the hollow-earth
theory.

There is a tremendous amount of literature which purports to prove
that jury nullification is a valid legal principle.  Some of it sounds
very legalistic and therefore convincing.  All of it is smoke and
mirrors.

I'm not going to go into why the whole concept of the rule of law
would collapse if the logical consequences of jury nullification were
allowed to work themselves out.  You can search this newsgroup in
DejaNews.com for my posts on that topic if you are interested.

Here's the bottom line: the jury's function in a jury trial to make
findings on those issues of fact where reasonable doubt exists.  The
judge's function is to make findings on issues of law, and to
determine which issues of fact require decisions by the jury.

This principle has been part of common-law jurisprudence since the
common law developed in Norman England around the 12th century.  It is
about as deeply embedded in our modern legal system as anything can
be.

In practical terms, there is usually not much that the losing party or
the court can do about a jury verdict, because the jury does not have
to explain itself.  In that sense jury nullification is a "de facto"
jury power.  That does not make it legitimate, unless you accept the
principle that an act is legitimate if you can get away with it.

If a jury exercises its "de facto power" to return a verdict based on
its own interpretation of law, and the judge somehow finds out, she
will either enter the verdict she believes the jury SHOULD have
returned, or declare a mistrial.

There have been cases where jurors were subjected to contempt of court
rulings for returning a verdict based on jury nullification.  I have
not researched how such cases have turned out, but considering the
nature of the action, I think a contempt ruling is a natural and
justifiable response.

Of course you can vote as you care to- with no justification or explanation
to anyone about your decision.
You are not only voting about the guilt or not-guilt of the Defendant,
you're voting about whether the law was applied correctly to the
circumstances, and whether the law itself is just.
If you have the time, look at the Fully Informed Jury Association (FIJA)
http://www.fija.org/
Obviously, the idea of a fully informed jury is disturbing to some,
attractive to others.

The fact is that if you acquit, nobody can change that and
you can't be punished for it (assuming you didn't like on
your jury questionnaire or take a bribe or the like.)

Many people, myself included, believe that this is intentional
and is a feature, not a bug.  Even in situations where a blind
automaton would see the evidence and listen to the instructions
and then convict, according to the belief the jury provides a
check, that if the result would be unjust or immoral, the law
not be strictly applied to the particular solution.

This can also be used to cause injustice -- if the accused is
likable, or represents a point of view favorable to the juror,
he might get away with what ought to be punished.

In either case, when a jury does not convict because they
decide that a conviction or the punishment that would follow
would be unjust or immoral or otherwise wrong, even if the
accused has technically met all the points of the crime
accused; when the only rational explanation for the jury
acquitting is "We didn't want to convict" -- that is called
Jury Nullification.

I'll assume you're asking about the United States.

Jury nullification is when jurors decide their verdict in accordance
with the facts, as they find them, but contrary to the law.

The way trials work today, juries are given instructions by the judge
to follow the law, and they are sworn to do so.  They are told that
their verdict must be according to the law (as the judge explained
the law to them), and their job is to determine the facts of the case.
They decide who they think is lying, for example.  But since nobody can
really know what's inside a juror's head, and the juror can try to
make up any explanation that the judge will accept if questioned,
they can really vote any way they want.  Judges don't like this.
Historically, this power of the jurors has been important in some
cases, delivering what was widely viewed as proper justice, but it
is in conflict with the principle of the rule of law.  The fact that
you can't read the minds of jurors has always been a basic underlying
assumption in our system of trial by peers.

See U.S. v. Moylan 1969.

Jury nullification is a de facto power of the jury, and is not ordinarily
described as a right. The power of jury nullification derives from an
inherent quality of most modern common law systems-a general unwillingness
to inquire into jurors' motivations during or after deliberations. A jury's
ability to nullify the law is further supported by two common law
precedents: the prohibition on punishing jury members for their verdict, and
the prohibition on retrying criminal defendants after an acquittal (see
related topic double jeopardy).

Jury nullification is the source of much debate. It is maintained that it is
an important safeguard of last resort against wrongful imprisonment and
government tyranny. It is also viewed as an abuse of the right to a Jury
trial that undermines the law and violates the oath sworn to by jurors.
There are fears that nullification could be used to permit violence against
women or unpopular minorities. It can be argued that jury nullification
could be used to nullify important defendants' rights, such as the Fifth
Amendment right not to testify or the right of self-defense. While
supporters argue that jury nullification can be used only to acquit and not
to convict because a judge must set aside a conviction that is clearly at
odds with the law and the facts, the fact that jury verdicts are treated
with great deference in United States courts means that the safeguards are
not absolute and a jury that dislikes a defendant has the ability to convict
an innocent defendant through nullification. Jury nullification may also
occur in civil suits, in which this distinction between acquittal and
conviction is of course irrelevant.

Nevertheless, there is little doubt as to the ability of a jury to nullify
the law. Today, there are several issues raised by jury nullification.

a.. First, whether juries can or should be instructed or informed of their
power to nullify.
b.. Second, whether a judge may remove jurors "for cause" when they refuse
to apply the law as instructed.
c.. Third, whether a judge may punish a juror for exercising their power
of jury nullification.
In recent years, courts seem to like jury nullification less and less. While
unable to take away the power of nullification, they have done much to
prevent its use.

The 1895 decision in Sparf v. U.S. held that a trial judge has no
responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws. This
decision, often cited, has led to a common practice in United States
courtrooms in which juries are instructed to find guilt or innocence
according to the letter of the law. Jurors are likely to be struck from the
panel during voir dire if they reveal awareness of the concept of jury
nullification.

A 1969 Fourth Circuit decision, U.S. v. Moylan, affirmed the right of jury
nullification, but also upheld the power of the court to refuse to permit an
instruction to the jury to this effect.

We recognize, as appellants urge, the undisputed power of the jury to
acquit, even if its verdict is contrary to the law as given by the judge,
and contrary to the evidence. This is a power that must exist as long as we
adhere to the general verdict in criminal cases, for the courts cannot
search the minds of the jurors to find the basis upon which they judge. If
the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused, is unjust,
or that exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for
any reason which appeals to their logic of passion, the jury has the power
to acquit, and the courts must abide by that decision. U.S. vs Moylan, 417 F
2d 1002, 1006 (1969)

Some people claim that Jury Nullification is an inherent right of
juries.  Others believe that it is an indication of "out of control
juries".

Probably the most famous case of Jury Nullification in the US is
Crown vs. Peter Zenger.  Zenger was accused of seditious libel for
criticizing the (English) governor of New York colony in his
newspaper.  The facts were not in dispute, nonetheless the jury
brought in a verdict of "not guilty".

For a defense of Jury Nullification, see

and especially

A jury can vote however it wishes.  Therefore it has the *power* to
nullify a law in the particular case it's hearing ("The law says doing
X is illegal, and it was proven that the defendant did X, but we don't
think he should be punished for it so we vote to acquit.")

Whether or not the exercise of that power in that way is proper is the
subject of argument.

Your friend was quoting the Wikipedia. Here is the entire article:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification

I think that covers it better than most folks here will take the time go
to into. While technically part of our legal system, most of what people
think about this concept, given reality, is closer to urban legend.

Good luck getting the jury to side with you and against the judge.

It can be done, but it's not lawful.  And another juror specifically
mentioning it in those terms is probably juror misconduct.

However, if you're currently seated on a jury, you asking this

If you are in deliberations then this is an improper communication.

Your fellow juror is advocating breaking the oath that you took when
you were sworn in as jurors and is compromising the jury process. You
should inform the judge about this.

Jury nullification is when the jury ignores the facts in the case and
finds a defendant not guilty. This is different from finding reasonable
doubt. There is a long history of jury nullification in the US going
back to before the Revolutionary war (many of the rebels who violated
the law were acquitted by juries). The Fugitive Slave Law, before the
Civil War was a favorite for jury nullification.

An interesting take, but almost as one-sided as the FIJA site -- just
on the other side of the question.  Which is why I referred OP to the
Wikipedia article as well.

Let me ask you a loaded question: consider the seminal case (in the
US) Crown vs. Peter Zenger.  Do you think the jury should have found
Zenger guilty?

You either don't know about or ignore the writings of John Adams,
Thomas Jefferson, and John Jay.  Even the rather extreme conservative
Antonin Scalia wrote that juries "function as circuitbreaker[s] in the
State's machinery of justice" (Blakely v. Washington).  I'll also note
that some states _do_ have a rule that explicitly allows JN and allows
defense attornies to argue for it.

AFAIK, those contempt citations were overruled on appeal.  The basic
principle that a jury _must not_ be punished for a verdict the judge
disapproves of is strongly embedded in US Jurisprudence, and for good
reason.  Jurors are to be free to decide the case without fear of
legal consequences, lest juries become rubber stamps for the judge.
That would be a Very Bad Thing, IMHO -- the framers embedded the right
of trial by jury in the Bill of Rights precisely because people did
_not_ trust judges to do the Right Thing(TM).

In the UK, JN played a part in the gradual reduction of types of crime
for which the death penalty could be applied.  When stealing a loaf of
bread was punishable by hanging, juries refused to convict -- and the
law had to be changed lest thieves go free entirely.

Mind you, I'm not arguing that JN is necessarily a good thing.  Only
that your categorical dismissal of it is not more valid than
categorically embracing it.

Presumably, you took an oath to decide the case according to the
judge's instructions.  I advise you to follow them.  To do otherwise
will expose you to penalties for contempt of court and possibly a
criminal conviction, depending on your state's law.

As to your friend's view on jury nullification, there is no clear
answer.  The fact is that there is nothing that can be done about a
"not guilty" verdict which flies in the face of the evidence.  The jury
has complete discretion to choose which witnesses to believe and which
to disbelieve.  The jury can even disbelieve uncontradicted testimony.
Since the burden of proof is on the state, a failure of proof means an
acquittal.  In a civil trial, the judge can enter a judgment opposite
to the jury's verdict.  But not in a criminal trial.  The judge can
change a "guilty" to a "not guilty", but not vice-versa.

Whether the resulting "jury nullification power" was intentionally
built into our justice system is a topic of debate.  Most authorities
have concluded that it was.  But most authorities have also concluded
that nullification cannot be requested or suggested to the jury, and
that the jury cannot be informed of its "power".  But I have heard tell
of judges that sneak it into the jury instructions, such as telling the
jury that if it finds beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant committed
the crime, the jury may convict (i.e., not the the jury "must"
convict).

Does jury nullification occur?  You bet it does.  Most people would
probably argue that the OJ Simpson verdict was a nullification.  There
was a locally famous case (in my area) in which it was undisputed that
the defendant started a bar fight and beat up the other guy.  The
defense attorney's entire closing argument was "it is UNAMERICAN to
convict the winner of a barroom brawl".  Verdict?  Not guilty.

Why do you call these issues raised by jury nullification?  They've all

A) They should not be so instructed - the law is clear.  Although it is
within their power to nullify, it is not a proper exercise of their
responsibility.

B) Of course.  This is also well established by the law.  And even if a
judge didn't strike the juror for cause, you bet one side would use a
peremptory challenge on the juror.

C) A judge can punish a juror by holding them in contempt, if it can be
proven they nullified.  Of course, proving this will be extremely
difficult unless the juror admits it.

A little more care with the facts, please.

The Zenger case no doubt had a role in the adoption of the First Amendment,
but Zenger was tried only once.  The crown attempted to indict him twice
through a grand jury.  The grand juries refused to return a true bill, so
Cosby (the governor in question) went to the Supreme Court (of NY) and
obtained a bench warrant.  (Cosby had installed a compliant Chief Justice.)

In any case, the rule against double jeopardy was a long-standing part of
English common law and predated the Zenger case.

The rule that truth is a defense against libel is a construct of subsequent
state tort laws.  Truth was *not* a defense against seditious libel,
although Hamilton, Zenger's lawyer, argued the contrary.  That's why this
case is an example of jury nullification.  Zenger committed the act -- the
truth of the published statements was irrelevant -- but the jury refused to
convict.

That is not so much a loaded question as an irrelevant one, because
the trial was conducted in a context where the rule of law had already
been destroyed by the government.  The entire action was manipulated
to produce a predetermined result, rather than to reach a legitimate
verdict.  The authorities went so far as to create a special court
whose makeup was intended to guarantee conviction.  Accordingly, the
jury's verdict was a political response to a political offensive.

This is a perfect example of the sort of "smoke and mirrors" that the
jury nullification people indulge in.  They cite this case over and
over as if it proved their point.  It proves nothing of the sort.

some pilgrim who, being cited for, frex, a traffic offense, believes
that he'll prevail on the concept of jury nullification (even if he

In general that's right.  But if there was jury tampering, for exemple,
the verdict can be thrown out and the defendant retried on the basis
that he never was really in "jeopardy" in the first place.

I've never heard of anyone being charged with failure to carry out his
duties for bringing in a verdict the judge thought unjustified.  But I
imagin that if it was proven that the juror had a predetermination from
the beginning that he would vote not-guilty irrespective of the
evidence, not only could he be charged but the verdict thrown out.

Yes.  The only exception I'm aware of is one case where the defendant
had bribed the entire panel in advance.  An appelate court ruled that
there the defendant had been in no danger of being convicted by such a
panel, and hence there was no "jeopardy", and the defendant was
retried -- and presumably also tried for bribing the original panel, a
separate crime.

True.  In a civil case, the judge can overrule the jury (although he

A judge can also overturn a "guilty" verdict and find for the
defendant in a criminal case.  _That_ can be appealed, I think, and if
the appellate court finds it wrong, the defendant can be retried.

(*) The usual reason is that the facts as presented didn't allow the
verdict, even if given the interpretation most favorable to the party

In a civil trial that's a possibility.

But with respect to a "not guilty" verdict in a criminal trial,
you're dead wrong. Once a jury returns a "not guilty" verdict, that's

guilty verdict, but not the other way around.

That's generally true, but if they don't like the outcome, they may just
retry the case in a different jurisdiction under a different charge.

Remember the Rodney King case?  In the first trial the cops were found
not guilty, and that triggered riots in LA.  Many said the not guilty
verdict was the result of jury nullification based on race.

In the second trial, in Federal Court, rather than State Court, charged
with civil rights violations, rather than the original State charges,
they were found guilty.

The claim was that this was not double jeopardy because of the different
charges.  In reality, that was the reason and method used to change a
not guilty verdict to a guilty verdict for the same event with the same
witnesses and testimony.  The only difference was a different jury.

Legally I guess it wasn't double jeopardy, but if it walks like a duck,

I defined it in my original response to the OP:

"In practical terms, there is usually not much that the losing party
or the court can do about a jury verdict, because the jury does not
have to explain itself.  In that sense jury nullification is a "de
facto" jury power.  That does not make it legitimate  [or "proper"],
unless you accept the principle that an act is legitimate if you can
get away with it.

One of the reasons I find the notion of jury nullification so
troubling is that debates about it so often require me to explain
this.  The advocates' arguments often turn on a more-or-less hidden
assertion that an act IS legitimate if you can get away with it.  That
assertion is antithetical to the rule of law.  Not to common law, or
to American Constitutional law; to law itself.

If the defendant is found guilty by the jury, then any
appeal/overturn/etc. can only result in his situation being ether
unchanged or for the better, thus it'd make sense why they'd allow for
the judge overturning the verdict and also allow for appeals of that
overturning.

I.e., basically, the defendant can't be made worse off than the jury
puts him by the prosecution appealing the verdict or trying him again
but he can be made better off or left in the same shape by the judge
overturning the verdict or him appealing it.

We could really get into mincing finely here. As I remember it, some
said the jury claimed it didn't believe the evidence due to racial
motives. White cop - non-white defendant.

That's a form of jury nullification because the evidence was accepted
(Daubert) into the trial. Most of the others I heard about who commented
on the trial simply said that no evidence would cause a black jury to
convict a black man of killing white people as payback for what the
blacks saw as previous injustices. That's a nullification plain and
simple - at least in the common term.

As has been the role of the jury for centuries: to resolve factual

The key factor here is that each "sovereign" can separately try the
defendant, because those are different "offenses".  the language is:
nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice
put in jeopardy of life or limb

If you stand on the California side of, say, Cal-Neva (a city on the
shore of Lake Tahoe) and shoot somebody on the Nevada side, you can be
tried twice:
. Once by California, for committing the murder there (firing the
shot)
. Once by Nevada, for committing the murder there (hitting and
killing the victim).

In addition, if the victim was a US Government Employee on duty, you
can be tried in Federal Court.  Similarly if you and the victim are of
different races or religions and the prosecution can prove to a jury
that you did it because of that difference.

I don't much like it either, but it's long-standing law, not something

The circumstances might have been the same but the one charge wasn't a
lesser included offense of the first so it was perfectly valid to have
two trials. I could shoot an FBI agent and be charged with murder under
the federal law (and maybe be found it was accidental or otherwise be
found innocent) AND be charged with weapons possession under a state (or
even a federal) law and be found guilty of that. It was two separate
charges stemming from the same actions.

Perhaps I'm missing something here because I'm not familiar with the
case, but that doesn't make sense.  Admitted evidence is not
necessarily true as a matter of law; it is admitted because it meets
the legal standards required to present it to the jury for their
consideration.  It is precisely the jury's function to weigh such
evidence and accept or reject it.

I agree that such cases are de facto double jeopardy and should be
judged unconstitutional.  I accept that there may be a need to move such
a case to the federal level, but IMO the decision to do so must be made
prior to, and precluding, a criminal trial at the state level.

Sorry, but I have to disagree. Whether you're in favor of jury
nullification or not, that is not an example of it, not even
remotely.

"I don't believe the evidence" is a completely proper exercise of a
juror's function, because the Constitution and hundreds of years of
tradition make the jury the trier of facts. Whether a witness was
telling the truth is a matter of fact, not of law, and is up to the
jury to decide.

When the witness's testimony is allowed by the judge, that does not
mean it is accurate and must be accepted as accurate by the jury. It
*couldn't* mean that, since many trials contain witnesses who
contradict each other. It means it is relevant and the witness is
competent to present it, and then the jury, observing the witness,
must decide on the witness's credibility.

Jury nullification would be "I believe the evidence, and I conclude
beyond a reasonable doubt that he did the deed, but I'm still voting
not guilty."

In Massachusetts, if the jury convicts court rules permit the
defendant to make a combined motion for acquittal or in the
alternative a new trial.  The judge may (must?) conditionally
grant or refuse a new trial at the same time that he enters
an appealable verdict of not guilty.  Both orders are subject
to simultaneous appellate review under their respective
standards.  In murder cases it is also common for the appeal
of conviction to be delayed until the defendant's first posttrial
motion for a new trial has been decided, and the appeals from
both actions decided together.

In general response to the thread, one might consider jury
nullification to be the counterpart of the prosecutor's power
to bring baseless or improperly motivated charges from
behind the shield of official immunity.

Generally, a juror's duty to the state is to assess the facts and accept
the law, and he affirms his willingness to this.  But his promise is
given upon supposition that the state has done its duty to make the law
proper and acceptable to a reasonable person.  If the state has failed
in its duty to make the law acceptable to a reasonable person, the
juror's duty to accept the law is null and his promise is void.

It's quite common (I've heard, in big cases) for witnesses to
contradict each other.  It can't be nullification for a juror to
decide which of them to believe (for one thing, in states that claim
not to allow nullification, the judge still tells the jury it has to
decide how much credibility each witness has).

Just because evidence is accepted doesn't make it _credible_.  Only
the jurors can decide whether a given witness is lying, telling the
truth, or some of each -- and if a mixture, which parts to believe.

Remember, acceptance into the trial just means that the court has
decided that the evidence meets certain standards, in particular being
"generally accepted" in the Scientific Community.  But there still
needs to be a "foundation": testimony that connects the evidence to
the defendant.  And that testimony can be credible -- or not.

So if they decided that the (white) cop lied about finding the
evidence (on Simpson or at the crime scene), they would quite rightly
decide that there was not "proof beyond a reasonable doubt".  Of
course, if the jurors had that attitude a priori, it was the
responsibility of the DA and/or the judge to find it and excuse them
for cause.

Most of the others I heard about who commented

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;on the trial simply said that no evidence would cause a black jury to
&gt;convict a black man of killing white people as payback for what the

I agree with Stan, and this is not inconsistent with believing that
race and racialism issues played some role in the jury's decision.
But there are times when such issues are properly relevant.   Such
could have been the case, if, for instance, the deliberating jurors
said, "I don't believe the evidence because the detective was shown to
be a racist and he had not only opportunity, but motive, to plant
false evidence implicating the defendant.   And that defense lawyer
was right when he said, 'If the glove don't fit, you must acquit.'"

In fact, I personally refuse to believe that there exists a jury of 12
good people of ANY race who would vote against their OWN strongly held
belief that a defendant was guilty of a crime THEY recognized as a
serious threat to society, such as murder, and thus acquit someone
they believed had been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, just
to "send a message" that had nothing to do with their belief in the
validity of the law itself.  The lazy and racist detective, far from
making a potentially solid case an open-and-shut one by tampering with
evidence (IF that's what happened)*, instead opened the door to
reasonable doubt when his alleged shortcuts were brought to light by
the defense.

Of course, nobody can say one way or the other for sure, and the
jury's decision to acquit cannot constitutionally be challenged
afterward, thus giving rise to endless speculation that it was simply
a "slap in the face at white society" for oppressing blacks.  But
those who accept that easy explanation are conveniently forgetting all
the warts and problems with the prosecution's case in this rambling,
over-long, out-of-control coutroom melodrama.

I do also think that, in a society where seriously unjust laws are
themselves the oppressors of the people, the people are justified in
voting against enforcement of those unjust laws, as in the Peter
Zenger case.  But no one seems to be arguing that's the same thing as
what happened in the Simpson case.

(*) I am NOT applying for a trademark on this phrase, as it's already
been used in commerce.

In this case I am more concerned for the way our justice system works
today, and the effect that accepting this principle would have on it.

When you evaluate the writings of the founders (or anyone else outside
your own time and place), it's important to consider the context in
which they lived.

The founders planned, prosecuted and justified a revolt against duly
constituted authority, and many of the ideas they expressed were
conditioned by that.  Consequently it's impossible to apply some of
their ideas to the modern world without accepting the proposition that
a similar revolt against our own duly constituted authority would be a
legitimate political act.  I can imagine circumstances in which I
would accept that proposition, but as things are now, I emphatically
do not.
