To the parade of ecological infamy, alongside Eugene Schieffelin
(who introduced the starling to the Americas), we can add
Dr. Warwick Kerr:

Dr. Kerr became world famous with his research on the hybridization
of the African bee and the Italian bee (Apis mellifera ligustica),
which initially created a national and international stir when several
African bee queens escaped inadvertently from Kerr's research apiary
in Rio Claro, and colonies of African bees, which are much more aggressive
than its European cousin, spread throughout the whole continent,
in the process causing many attack and biting accidents (and a few deaths),
until it was thoroughly intermixed with the local bee populations;
the descendants are now known as Africanized bees.

Others? I can think of kudzu, the zebra mussel.

How about the extinction of Partula snails in Moorea?

Long story short, and I can't be bothered to Google right now, but the
South Pacific island of Moorea was host to a number of Partula
species, and of particular interest to evolutionary biologists because
the terrain on that island isolated populations of snails - they
couldn't cross the ridges between valleys - and provided a fine
example of parallel evolution.

In other words, snails with a common ancestry, with very similar
environments, couldn't interbreed and the various populations were
diversifying by themselves, almost completely due to minor or random
factors.

One man, whose name I can't recall, devoted his lifetime to studying
the Partula snails on Moorea, collecting them, measuring their shells,
and writing it all down.  For posterity.  His idea was that a similar
study, perhaps a century later, would show significant morphological
differences that might throw light on how evolution works.

Then some guy brought some edible snails to the region, because he
liked to eat snails.  Yes, he was French.  You can stop laughing at
the back now.

Some of his edible snails escaped.  I don't know how.  How hard can it
be to stop snails escaping?  Anyway, they thrived in their newfound
environment, and the indigenous Partula snails were elbowed out.  Not
that snails have many elbows.

The French government, who controlled the island, had the wizard idea
of introducing a third snail - an African Land Snail, IIRC - which was
a predator of other snails.  The idea was that these would eat the
edible snails and then die out, leaving the region free for Partula to
roam.  Can snails really be said to roam?

The scientists advised against it, but you know politicians: they
don't often listen to scientists.

So, the African snails turned out to prefer the taste of Partula over
the taste of the imported &quot;edible&quot; snails.  Partula quickly became
extinct.

Yeah, but on the other hand the entire 'killer bee' thing was bullshit.
Yeah, those escaped bees got into the wild and bred with 'tame' bees.  But
for years before that bee people were crossing 'tame' bees with African bees
anyway to improve honey yields or something.  The actual impact was about
zero.

A bit of the same thing, at least with escaped edible snails
introduced by edible snail-eaters, happened locally. And yes, there
are native snails that are slowly being edged out (but not, I don't
think, eaten by a third introduced species.)

Bermuda vis spiders, toads, and one other animal, all of which are
thriving splendidly together to the detriment of the native fauna.

Kudzu, in the American South.

Vis bees, honeybees are non-natives themselves. The Africanized bees
have not been as affected with the bee death as the Italian honeybees
(which are the ones we think of as &quot;bees&quot;) and I believe are the only
wild honeybee populations now.  There are native bees, but they are
not domesticated.

&gt; &gt; (who introduced the starling to the Americas), we can add
&gt; &gt; Dr. Warwick Kerr:

&gt; &gt; Dr. Kerr became world famous with his research on the hybridization
&gt; &gt; of the African bee and the Italian bee (Apis mellifera ligustica),
&gt; &gt; which initially created a national and international stir when several
&gt; &gt; African bee queens escaped inadvertently from Kerr's research apiary
&gt; &gt; in Rio Claro, and colonies of African bees, which are much more aggressive
&gt; &gt; than its European cousin, spread throughout the whole continent,
&gt; &gt; in the process causing many attack and biting accidents (and a few deaths),
&gt; &gt; until it was thoroughly intermixed with the local bee populations;
&gt; &gt; the descendants are now known as Africanized bees.

&gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Estevam_Kerr

&gt; &gt; Others? I can think of kudzu, the zebra mussel.

&gt; The Brown Tree snake in Guam.  Not deliberately imported but it was
&gt; brought in by people.

Here in Michigan we have the Emerald Ash Borer. Came in from Asia in
2002 and has killed millions of ash trees. Has spread to Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois and Canada.

Interesting.  In Oregon, my neighborhood used to have grey squirrels.
They disappeared and after a while squirrels of a ruddy hue moved into
the vacancy.

In So. California, for the past 15 or so years, I've only seen the

Gray squirrels come in three color varieties, plus albino. Regular
gray, a dark melanistic version (I know they're common around the
Washington DC area, don't know where you live), and a whitish version
that lives in downtown Washington DC near the White House (of course.)
The whitish versions are not true albinos, although albinos occur as
well but much, much more rarely (we had a thread about one and its
unfortunate demise a little while ago.)

They're the same species. The dark phase looks dark brown or black. Yes,
those are the ones you're seeing in East Van. I believe they've spread
from the west side over the last 20-30 years, possibly because much of
East Van didn't have many big trees before that.

Here's one of the dark ones:

Speaking of forests, I heard that foxes won't eat chickens if there's
a forest nearby where they can hunt voles. True?

&gt; The whitish versions are not true albinos, although albinos occur as

I'm used to the local skunks showing lots of pattern variation,
from almost all black, through traditional black and white to
almost pure white [looks like a ghost when drifting through the
back yard in the pale moonlight. But last week I saw a skunk
which was dark gray and white, at least at the tail end [it was
moving away from me at the time, and moving faster than skunks
usually do].

I just read that koalas have small brains because they
don't have to think about what to eat. We have large brains,
because we're omnivores (like rats). You might think that not
worrying about what to eat would free your mind up for
other tasks.

I though that koalas were sort of like pandas in that they spend all
their time eating and sleeping, as their food source is pretty low in
nutrition. Oh, and both have a testy temperament, too.

I had to pop up a level, then browse the galleries.

There's something about you I just like. The first date my now-wife and I
had was to the P-Funk All-Stars concert. I have a &quot;Clinton for President&quot;
