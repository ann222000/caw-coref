Does DMSO oxidize terpenes?

I blended dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with tea tree oil (TTO). Both
liquids were clear-transparent before they were combined, but the
mixture has a blurry refraction; not cloudy though.

I do not wish to oxidize TTO's various terpenes. Would DMSO be expected
to oxidize terpenes? How can I tell whether or not oxidation has occurred?

I'm guessing that the two liquids are not completely miscible or that
you have water in your DMSO and that isn't miscible with the other
two.  If you let them sit undisturbed for a period of time (hours /
overnight), do they separate into distinct layers?

I think that DMSO is relatively inert.

And in answer to your original question: oxidation typically results
in clear organics developing color as unsaturated bonds are
introduced, starting with pale yellow and progressing to darker as
more oxidation occurs.

For something as complex as I suspect tea tree oil is, you would
likely have to do a very careful GC/MS or LC/MS analysis of the
before and after to determine the presence and chemical identity of
oxidized products.

But my money is on water in the DMSO or something else that isn't
miscible with the DMSO / oil solution.

Yes there was a separation into distinct layers several hours later.
They were both clear an colorless and appeared to be present at about
the same volumetric proportions of the DMSO and the TTO. So I conclude
that they was little if any miscibility between them.

Thanks for the detailed replies. Based on your description, there was no
visible evidence of oxidation of the top layer (TTO).

In fact the stock DMSO solution was 70% (30% water). However the volume
of the separated bottom layer appeared to be about equal to the volume
of the stock DMSO solution; not 30% of that volume. So apparently little
if any DMSO diffused out of the water and into the TTO. I conclude then
that the DMSO is far more strongly polar than nonpolar.

I was hoping that DMSO would be a coupling agent suitable for use with TTO.

If you still want to use DMSO, you may need to add a surfactant to
encapsulate the TTO and bring it into the polar phase.  DMSO is a
very polar solvent, as is water.

Alternatively, if you develop this as a skin lotion, you might omit
the DMSO entirely and use water and surfactant alone to create an
emulsion.
