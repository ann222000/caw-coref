convert PAL video to NTSC video

Hi, in an older iMovie manual I found that after importing a VIDEO_TS
folder in iMovie (analogue &gt; digital) I can export the digital file to
an analogue NTSC file iDVD can handle to create a NTSC disc.

Right now, I have iMovie08 and I have been able to import the PAL
VIDEO_TS folder and it is converted to MPEG4.

Using 'Share &gt; Export to Movie' no longer gives the option NTSC or am I
missing something here?

iDVD08 doesn't have the PAL&gt;NTSC conversion - right?

Would reinstalling iMovie06 help?
Does anyone have a working solution?

Basically I want to convert a PAL DVD to a NTSC DVD to show it to a
friend of mine in the US. No piracy, my legal PAL DVD won't play on his
NTSC player so I need a NTSC copy.

Any suggestions are welcome.

Cheers - Robert

MPEG4/h.264 doesn't care about PAL or NTSC, other than the aspect ratio,
I guess. It's not what was in your VIDEO_TS folder. Send your friend the
MPEG4 file. Other than that, there was a discussion of Toast being able
to convert PAL DVDs to NTSC around these parts recently.

It's Apple, so it's prob'ly:

I haven't been able to absolutely verify this, but from my endless
experiments over the last 3 weeks my conclusion is that PAL/NTSC means
nothing in this environment.   Hunt about in this newsgroup if you want
all the bloody details--you don't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't think it does, but I'm not sure it matters. If you're friend is
content to play this on a computer, then, as Warren said, send your
friend the MPEG4.

Assuming your friend has no computer and/or simply wants a playable
DVD, you can throw the mpg4 into iMovie and burn a DVD.  Sometimes
(inexplicably) it shaves the sides by about an 8th or 16th.  I avoided
this in tests by ensuring the screen geography was 4:3. The next time I
did the full movie, though, it cropped it again. I haven't nailed the
cropping down yet. Again this is drag-a-mpg4 into iDVD.

But most importantly for your needs, iDVD (iLife '08) has an indicator
in preferences for NTSC and PAL.

I did this, neither piracy nor person, I just wanted to view a
commercial disc on my DVD player with an NTSC TV.  The disc was
purportedly PAL and region 3. I ripped it to disk with MacTheRipper. I
then drug the VIDEO_TS into Toast Titanium and it spit out a bona-fide
DVD. Toast, too, has a switch for NTSC or PAL.

It worked perfectly.

Ain't no such thing...

I sell videos commercially (see my link before to access them).  When I
sold in VHS format, I had to supply different format for Europe (PAL) vs
US (NTSC).  However, now that I only sell DVD, there is no such
distinction.  The same DVD plays fine on a US TV or a European one.

Yes, the disks can be coded per region, and Big Name Hollywood disks
often are.  If you are reading it on a Mac/PC, then you need to change
the region code.

On the Mac (and probably PC), there is a maximum of 5 times you can
change the code, but there are freeware solutions out there that reset
the count, giving you unlimited changes if needed.

There is no difference between NTSC, PAL, SECAM (France and Russia) or
ther other variants for DVD.  Fortunately those were resolved when we
left VHS tape behind.

VLC and MPLAYER both work fine. They don't use the drive to decrypt
the video files, they read them as encrypted data and do the decryption
with the CPU. This adds more overhead, but a 600mHz or faster processor
will do fine.

This avoids the whole region protection code (RPC) mechanism.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Because your DVD player is set to play on a multistandard TV. Check your
setup options.

OK, I stand partially corrected.  But note the comment

&quot;Almost all DVD players sold in PAL countries play both kinds of discs.&quot;

I have never yet had a DVD returned from Europe because it failed to
play for them, and I only made the DVDs in a single format (NTSC).

Not sure how you come to the first conclusion after stating the
subsequent fact.  If I only produce videos in NTSC, and most PAL players
will also play NTSC, I think the market is well covered...

However, I will agree that I forgot that little fact about the
Asian/Euopean players being multiformat rather than US players.  It has
been several years since I made the study and decision to go DVD, and it
has simply been a cash cow since then.

----------

BTW, for anyone wanting to produce and sell DVDs, I started with
CustomFlix back when they were brand new.  They got bought out by
Amazon, and now call themselves CreateSpace.  Personally I liked their
initial name better, but the service is better now...

http://www.createspace.com

I already had 52 commercial videos that we produced in the mid 90's and
were selling in VHS format, when CustomFlix came on the scene.  I used
DVD Studio Pro to create NTSC DVD versions of each of the videos, and
Photoshop to create covers based on the VHS covers.  Back then
CustomFlix charged $50 per video to set up, but gave them to me free
because of the volume I was producing, and they were just starting up.

I sell all my videos on my site, plus Amazon carried about half of them
for the past 12 years.  Once CustomFlix was bought out by Amazon, they
started carrying all of my videos.  When someone orders the video on my
site, the order goes directly to CreateSpace.  I have zero work to do.

At the end of each month, CreateSpace deposits money into my account and
sends me an email saying what was sold, and to whom.  My only work is to
ask Quicken to download my statement, and to look at the extra pile of
money that came in.  Pretty nice :-)

I get to set the price of my videos, and CustomSpace charges me a
sliding fee based on the number of videos I sell.  Since I have made no
new videos since 1999, sales have dropped off, as you would imagine.  Of
course that does mean that I have been making money for the last  8
years with zero new work.

At this point, the profit check put into my account is down to about $2K
per month.  Not enough to change my life or let me quit my job, but a
nice little extra amount to have each month. :-)

First effort on my part: rip PAL DVD to get rid of Region Code in

Second effort: after MacTheRipper conversion to MPEG4 in Handbrake.
Forget to mention that in first article. Imported MPEG4 in iMovie and it
plays in iMovie.

Apperently he needs an analogue VIDEO_TS folder containing disc to watch
the movie. There is no way to go over to his place to check things :-(

I know there are apparently brand new hobbies I could acquire in a

Instead I simply play the DVD via VLC instead of DVD Player.  If I need

In the past week I've ordered a few old movies from Amazon.co.uk in an
attempt to get to films that are otherwise unavilable.  Hopefully in
the next few days bona-fide PAL format DVD's will arrive and I'll be
able to find out if conversion, just on a straight-ahead Mac with a few
utilities, is possilble.

I thought I had done it already only because the guys at Facets TOLD me
they were European discs, which is true, and they would then likely be
PAL dvd's. I've seen a few in other locations that point out the DVD's
themselves are apprently multi-standard.  Is that possible on the DVD
proper, I wonder.  That they be wholly operable in either format?

Here we go AGAIN. First of all, the video is encoded as component video
YBCR, not PAL, NTSC or SECAM. So in reality there is no such thing as a
PAL or NTSC DVD. However there are 4 allowed frame rates, which come from
the original video. FILM (23.96 FPS for NTSC and 24 FPS for PAL/SECAM) and
VIDEO (25 FPS for PAL/SECAM and 29.97 FPS for NTSC).

The disks do have information in the header that says the disk is either
derived from PAL or NTSC video and the aspect ratio. However there is no
requirement for the video on the disk to match the headers and mixed
DVD's are possible.

Theoreticaly players sold in the U.S. and other NTSC countries should
always display their encoded video (composite and S-video) as NTSC, with
the frame rate converted to 29.97 FPS. Component video output should be
left alone.

Players for the PAL market should do the same, except their encocded
output would always be PAL and 25 FPS.

However many players have a setup option for TV set type, either NTSC,
PAL or multisystem (switches depending upon frame rate). The one U.S.
player (bought at Radio Shack) that found it's way to me in a suitcase
was like this.

The ones I have bought here, except for a Sansui that I bought around
2000, all had the setup option. The Sansui had a switch on the back with
the choice of PAL or Multisystem.

In fairness, and in appreciation of your attempts, you have been
successful in educating. But information doesn't always provide
solutions.  I've managed, this time, to get some use of your
information regarding frame rates. But my current situation remains:

I have a PAL dvd that I want to convert to NTSC in order to view on DVD
player and television which don't do PAL.  I believe this is the same
goal as Robert had when he started this thread.  After re-reading your
post a few times and the activities described below I believe my real
goal is to convert from 25fps to 29.97fps.  That's a guess.

Specifically: I purchased a British DVD and when it arrived, it would
not read in my DVD Player since the player is Region 1 (USA) and the
disc is presumably Region 2. MTR strips that and so the region aspect
is not a problem.

After ripping with MTR, I drug the video_ts to Toast and indicated
output format NTSC.  Once burned playing on my Panasonic DVD-F85
presented an image endlessly scrolling vertically, as if ye olde
&quot;vertical hold&quot; was way off. There are no method of changing PAL/NTSC
options on the F85, nor method of toggling PAL/NTSC on my Sanyo
television.

I'm back to attempting to correct the situation at my Mac.

as you mention.  How would you suggest analyzing a DVD?  Any preferred
utilities?

My next non-preferred attempt at a solution is to run the video_ts
through handbrake and re-encode the entire thing in MP4. It takes
something on the order of 20+ hours or so to produce an mp4, which
makes it a less than desirable option. Additionally when burning the
mp4 via iDVD I find no way to avoid cropping the last 8th or so on each
side of the frame.  So that &quot;solution&quot; sucks, but I'm trying it
nonetheless.  I still have between 8 and 12 hours to go.

In Handbrake there are a jillion parms there, the only ones that
apparently worth mention are:

Video settings tab:

Output: Format=Mp4, Codecs=AVC/H.264 / AAC Audio
Framerate=&quot;Same as Source (25)&quot;
-- **AHA** here is my frame rate implying (from above) that this is
VIDEO 25 FPSfor PAL/SECAM!
Encoder=x264 (h.264 Main)
Quality=1500
Toggles: Greyscale=Off, 2-pass encoding=On, Turbo first pass=On

In the Audio/Subtitles tab I've only changed subtitles to English, as
the film is Japanese.

I'm not sure if this means anything to me. I erased the initial tests
with Toast, but realize now I could have fed them to Handbrake to see
if they were *still* 25 frames or whether in the process they had been
converted to 29.97, which seems dubious to me, since toast burned the
disc in about 30 minutes.  It seems that if it were converting frame
rates alone it would have taken quite a bit longer.

I have two recent Panasonic DVD players: an F85 which supports no

for NTSC v. PAL. But of course my TV is NTSC only.

The region code is used in decryption. It does not mean anything to anyone,
EXCEPT the microcode in the player. If you use a stand alone player,
or a computer's DVD drive to decrypt the files, it checks the region
code.

Programs that use the DCSS code written for Linux, read the data as
it is from the DVD drive and use the CPU to decrypt it.

There were a few (less than 10) RCE, region code enhanced DVD's,
notably Gladiator, but someone figured out how to get around the
RCE on a regular unodified player using the remote control, so it
was dropped.

This really does suck.

The best way to do it is to recode the video with MENCODER. It's command
line only but the flags are well documented and you really only need
to specify them once. The command line interface supports shell scripts,
so you can set one up and keep using it.

Mencoder is very well documented, there is a page which describes
exactly what video resolution, etc to use.

Mencoder will read the encrypted DVD files directly, which eliminates
MTR, and create a DVD format MPEG file. You then use DVDAuthor to create
the VOB and other files needed to make a DVD.

Once you have those files, you can use your favorite burning program
to burn them.

(sample Mencoder parameters)

mencoder
-mc 0 -noskip -oac lavc -ovc lavc -of mpeg -mpegopts format=dvd:tsaf
-vf scale=720:576,harddup -srate 48000 -af lavcresample=48000
-lavcopts vcodec=mpeg2video:vrc_buf_size=1835:vrc_maxrate=9800:
vbitrate=5000:keyint=15:acodec=ac3:abitrate=192:aspect=4/3
-ofps 30000/1001 dvd:// -o out.mpg

These are a good starting point. Note that it is all one long line. This
will fix the video to the correct size and frame rate, and fix the
possible problem that some PAL DVD's use audio encoding which is not
compatible with NTSC DVD's.

These options were chosen carefully because many DVD player programs
and the Chinese/Eastern European cheap DVD players will play almost
any file. The more expensive players (and Windows Media Player)
enforce these standards.

(sample DVDauthor control file)

&lt;dvdauthor dest=&quot;dvdfiles/&quot;&gt;
&lt;vmgm /&gt;
&lt;titleset&gt;
&lt;titles&gt;
&lt;video aspect=&quot;4:3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;pgc&gt;
&lt;vob file=&quot;out.mpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/pgc&gt;
&lt;/titles&gt;
&lt;/titleset&gt;
&lt;/dvdauthor&gt;

That is difficult to say as there is nothing in the front-end
(warnings, and distrubtion companys), nor the movie itself that isn't
B&amp;W. And right now, I've already erased those (DVD+RW) disks. I have no
mechanism on my &quot;more-modern&quot; TV to modify vertical hold anyway.  It
has a total of five buttons, one for setup with a very slim series of
options.

on to the video image, disallowing any future use of frame selection in
which you could remove them, say for a jpeg reference image.

Additionally, though this disk has only English as a potential
subtitle, others have 2 or 3 languages, so a simple &quot;subtitles on&quot;
might provide the wrong subtitle.  It would need to be subtitle=English

You need to know which subtitle number it is, because they can change with

&gt;&gt; clipping, re-encoding and other video tasks (handbrake, mpegstreamclip,
&gt;&gt; ffmpegx, etc.) I have found only handbrake provides options for the
&gt;&gt; selection of subtitles. Of course it then burns the subtitles directly
&gt;&gt; on to the video image, disallowing any future use of frame selection in
&gt;&gt; which you could remove them, say for a jpeg reference image.

&gt; Subtitles are a problem. I have only used mencoder to burn them into
&gt; the image, I'm not sure how they would be added otherwise.

&gt; I'm not saying it can't be done another way, just that I've never done it.
">

At this point I won't complain about subtitles to take them hard-coded,
otherwise the DVD is worthless.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Additionally, though this disk has only English as a potential
&gt;&gt; subtitle, others have 2 or 3 languages, so a simple &quot;subtitles on&quot;
&gt;&gt; might provide the wrong subtitle.  It would need to be subtitle=English
&gt;&gt; or some such.

&gt; You need to know which subtitle number it is, because they can change with
&gt; each disk. You can check it out with mplayer first. :-)
">

I just went snooping for Mencoder and the only one I can put my hands
on, via versiontracker, is Mencoder OS X (v 0.7.7).  And it does have a
GUI interface. Is this the one you are speaking of?  It does have a CLI
entry location for &quot;additional parms&quot; but then also has a number of
other parms pre-set.  If not, a pointer to it's location would be
appreciated.

DVD Author I found at sourceforge.net and v 06.14 game as a tar.gz.
Uncompressed it looks like a unix installation of some kind.  Is this
what I'm looking for?

Both programs are developed by their authors for Linux. Third parties
take their programs and ported them to OSX. You can find the Mplayer and
Mencoder programs by going to the Mplayer (linux) web site. There
you will find the programs under downloads, and the documentation
in a set of web pages. AFAIK, there is no GUI for it, but I may be
wrong.

DVDAuthor is similar, but I don't know where to find the MacOS version
of it. If you have the Apple Developer Toolkit, you can compile your
own copy, but in this case it would be much easier to find one already
compiled (set up) for OSX.

Get ffmpegx, it is a GUI front end for mencoder and mpeg2enc which make
life a whole lot easier.

Is THAT what that dang thing is?!?  I had some real problems setting
ffmpegx up and confusion in operation. And the idea of compiling stuff
from Unix.  Ick.  Though willing to do it, at least until I get a
Pal&lt;&gt;NTSC, Region-free player/Recorder with a hard disk I can access
from my Mac.

I'll have to re-investigate that for ease of access...

You can get binaries of mencoder and mpeg2enc for most platforms,
setting up ffmegx is as simple as pointing to the binaries. I think it
even tells you where to get them. It really is very good at converting
almost anything, video or audio.

No they don't, not with that particular Matsushita drive.  VLC, at

has been discussed here before IIRC. There's no known workaround at this
