Why Do We Smoke Cigarettes?
from
The Psychology of Everyday Living
by Ernest Dichter

None of the much flaunted appeals of cigarette advertisers, such as superior
taste and mildness, induces us to become smokers or to choose one brand in
preference to another. Despite the emphasis put on such qualities by
advertisers, they are minor considerations. This is one of the first facts we
discovered when we asked several hundred people, from all walks of life, why
they liked to smoke cigarettes. Smoking is as much a psychological pleasure as
it is a physiological satisfaction. As one of our respondents explained: &quot;It is
not the taste that counts. It's that sense of satisfaction you get from a
cigarette that you can't get from anything else.&quot;

Smoking is Fun

What is the nature of this psychological pleasure? It can be traced to the
universal desire for self-expression. None of us ever completely outgrows his
childhood. We are constantly hunting for the carefree enjoyment we knew as
children. As we grew older, we had to subordinate our pleasures to work and to
the necessity for unceasing effort. Smoking, for many of us, then, became a
substitute for our early habit of following the whims of the moment; it becomes
a legitimate excuse for interrupting work and snatching a moment of pleasure.
&quot;You sometimes get tired of working intensely,&quot; said an accountant whom we
interviewed, &quot;and if you sit back for the length of a cigarette, you feel much
fresher afterwards. It's a peculiar thing, but I wouldn't think of just sitting
back without a cigarette. I guess a cigarette somehow gives me a good excuse.&quot;

Smoking is a Reward

Most of us are hungry for rewards. We want to be patted on the back. A cigarette
is a reward that we can give ourselves as often as we wish. When we have done
anything well, for instance, we can congratulate ourselves with a cigarette,
which certifies, in effect, that we have been &quot;good boys.&quot; We can promise
ourselves: &quot;When I have finished this piece of work, when I have written the
last page of my report, I'll deserve a little fun. I'll have a cigarette.&quot;

The first and last cigarette in the day are especially significant rewards. The
first one, smoked right after breakfast, is a sort of anticipated recompense.
The smoker has work to do, and he eases himself into the day's activities as
pleasantly as possible. He gives himself a little consolation prize in advance,
and at the same time manages to postpone the evil hour when he must begin his
hard day's work. The last cigarette of the day is like &quot;closing a door.&quot; It is
something quite definite. One smoker explained: &quot;I nearly always smoke a
cigarette before going to bed. That finishes the day. I usually turn the light
out after I have smoked the last cigarette, and then turn over to sleep.&quot;

Smoking is often merely a conditioned reflex. Certain situations, such as coming
out of the subway, beginning and ending work, voluntary and involunatary
interruptions of work, feelings of hunger, and many others regulate the
timetable of smoking. Often a smoker may not even want a cigarette particularly,
but he will see someone else take one and then he feels that he must have one,
too.

While to many people smoking is fun, and a reward in itself, it more often
accompanies other pleasures. At meals, a cigarette is somewhat like another
course. In general, smoking introduces a holiday spirit into everyday living. It
rounds out other forms of enjoyment and makes them one hundred per cent
satisfactory.

Smoking is Oral Pleasure

As we have said, to explain the pleasure derived from smoking as taste
experience alone, is not sufficient. For one thing, such an explanation leaves
out the powerful erotic sensitivity of the oral zone. Oral pleasure is just as
fundamental as sexuality and hunger. It functions with full strength from
earliest childhood. There is a direct connection between thumbsucking and
smoking. &quot;In school I always used to chew a pencil or a pen,&quot; said a journalist,
in reply to our questions. &quot;You should have seen the collection I had. They used
to be chewed to bits. Whenever I try to stop smoking for a while, I get
something to chew on, either a pipe or a menthol cigarette. You just stick it in
your mouth and keep on sucking. And I also chew a lot of gum when I want to cut
down on smoking....&quot;

The satisfied expression on a smoker's face when he inhales the smoke is ample
proof of his sensuous thrill. The immense power of the yearning for a cigarette,
especially after an enforced abstinence, is acknowledged by habitual smokers.
One of our respondents said: &quot;When you don't get a cigarette for a long time and
you are kind of on pins, the first drag goes right down to your heels.&quot;

The Cigarette -- A Modern Hourglass

Frequently the burning down of a cigarette functions psychologically as a time
indicator. A smoker waiting for someone who is late says to himself, &quot;Now I'll
smoke one more cigarette, and then I am off.&quot; One person explained, &quot;It is much
easier to watch a cigarette get smaller and smaller than to keep watching a
clock and look at the hands dragging along.&quot;

In some countries, the farmers report distances in terms of the number of pipes,
as, for example, &quot;It's about three pipes from here to Smithtown.&quot;

A cigarette not only measures time, but also seems to make time pass more
rapidly. That is why waiting periods almost autuomatically stimulate the desire
to smoke. But a deeper explanation of this function of smoking is based on the
fact that smoking is ersatz activity. Impatience is a common feature of our
times, but there are many situations which compel us to be patient. When we are
in a hurry, and yet have to wait, a cigarette gives us something to do during
that trying interval. The experience of wanting to act, but being unable to do
so, is very unpleasant and may even, in extreme cases, cause attacks of nervous
anxiety. Cigarettes may then have a psychotherapeutic effect. This helps to
explain why soldiers, waiting for the signal to attack, sometimes value a
cigarette more than food.

&quot;With a Cigarette I Am Not Alone&quot;

Frequently, our respondents remarked that smoking cigaretees is like being with
a friend. Said one, &quot;When I lean back and light my cigarette and see the glow in
the dark, I am not alone any more....&quot; In one sense, a cigarette seems to be
something alive. When it is lighted it appears to be awakened, brought to life.
In a French moving picture (Daybreak) the hunted criminal, played by Jean Gabin,
holds out as long as he has his cigarettes. He barricades himself against the
police and stands siege courageously for some time -- until his last cigarette
is gone. Then he gives up.

The companionable character of cigarettes is also reflected in the fact that
they help us make friends. In many ways, smoking has the same effect drinking
has. It helps to break down social barriers. Two smokers out on a date light up
a cigarette as soon as they get into their car. &quot;It's just the right start for
an evening,&quot; they say. Immediately they feel at ease, for they have found an
interest they both share.

We could report many true anecdotes to illustrate how cigarettes bring people
together. One such story was related by a middle-aged lady: &quot;A long time ago, on
a steamer, there was a boy I was quite eager to meet... but there was no one to
introduce us.... The second day out, he was siting at a table right next to me,
and I was puffing away at my cigarette. The ashes on my cigarette were getting
longer and longer, and I had no ash tray. Suddenly he jumped up and brought me
one. That's how the whole thing started. We are still happily married.&quot;

&quot;I Like to Watch the Smoke&quot;

In mythology and religion, smoke is full of meaning. Its floating intangibility
and unreal character have made it possible for imaginative man to see therein
mystery and magic. Even for us moderns, smoke has a strong fascination. To the
cigarette smoker, the clouds he puffs out seem to represent a part of himself.
Just as most people like to watch their own breath on cold winter days, so they
like to watch cigarette smoke, which similarly makes one's breath visible. This
explains the emotional attitudes of many toward smoke. &quot;Smoke is fascinating,&quot;
said one of the people we interviewed. &quot;I like to watch the smoke. On a rainy
day, I sort of lie in a haze in the middle of the room and let my thoughts
wander while I smoke and wonder where the smoke goes.&quot;

The desire to make things is deep-rooted -- and smoke is manufactured by the
smoker himself. Smoking provides satisfaction because it is a playful, creative
activity. This fact was well stated by one cigarette devotee as follows: &quot;It's a
fascinating thing to watch the smoke take shape. The smoke, like clouds, can
form different shapes.... You like to sit back and blow rings and then blow
another rings through the first ones. You are perfectly relaxed.&quot;

&quot;Got a Match?&quot;

Some of the appeals of a lighted cigarette derive from the appeals of fire in
general. Fire is the symbol of life, and the idea of fire is surrounded by much
superstition. In this connection, it is interesting to note that traces of
superstition can be seen in the smoking habits of modern man. For instance some
people never will light three cigarettes on one match. It is said that this
superstition is based on experiences during World War I. As three soldiers were
lighting up the third man was hit when the light of a match flared up for the
last time. Our custom of lighting another smoker's cigarette for him may
sometimes have an erotic significance, or it may serve as a friendly gesture.
Match and cigarette are contact points.

Smoking Memories

Certain moments in our lives are closely linked with cigarettes. These
situations often leave on people's memories an important imprint never to be
forgotten. Here is such an occasion, described by

Well they're definitely compulsive.  Which is why Las Vegas allows smoking
everywhere, including in supermarkets, because almost all compulsive
gamblers are also compulsive tobacco smokers, and they won't (can't) gamble
unless they can smoke.

Complaining to the supermarket or convenience store manager gets a response
along the lines above, and a claim that the poker machines are necessary
to compete and that grocery stores can't make a profit selling food to people
who need to eat.  And a state whose politicians babble on incessantly about
the right of adults to choose to smoke tobacco and gamble their paychecks
away until recently punished marijuana possession as a felony with up to 5
years in prison.

I'm a huge fan of various recreational drugs, and the one drug I can't
stand is nicotine.  The taste is so vile, then it is a major nervous
system stimulant which makes me sweat, my heart pound, and vomit.  It
makes me dizzy, but other than that there is no psychoactive sensation
at all except for feeling sick and nauseous.

I don't even like inhaling marijuana smoke, but it is so much less
harsh and doesn't smell too offensive.  I can also go for an hour
without smoking it, something most tobacco addicts have trouble doing
without beginning to foam at the mouth.  Anyone who smokes as many
crack rocks per day as nicotine addicts smoke cigarettes would be
forcibly committed to a drug rehab facility on the grounds that they
were hopeless drug addicts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why Do We Smoke Cigarettes?
&gt;&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt; The Psychology of Everyday Living
&gt;&gt;&gt; by Ernest Dichter
&gt;&gt;&gt; (essay by a chain-smoking psychology student)
&gt;&gt; &gt; ...
&gt;&gt; &gt; Cigarette Taste Has to Be Acquired

&gt;&gt;&gt; Most people like the smell of tobacco but dislike the taste of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; cigarette. Frequently we were reminded that &quot;a cigarette never tastes as
&gt;&gt;&gt; good as it smells.

&gt;&gt; This is hilarious, the guy who wrote it must be a consultant for Las
&gt;&gt; Vegas
&gt;&gt; casinos.  &quot;Most people&quot; like the smell of tobacco so much that
&gt;&gt; anti-smoking
&gt;&gt; laws are almost universal these days.  I actually dislike it immensely,
&gt;&gt; 11
&gt;&gt; years of living in the ashtray known as Las Vegas means I get almost
&gt;&gt; homicidal when I catch a whiff of the vile narcotic.

&gt;&gt; I also know that the reference to &quot;taste&quot; is actually the tingling
&gt;&gt; sensation
&gt;&gt; the nicotine causes on the tongue and back of throat.  The actual taste
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; worse than the smell.  I often wonder why anyone smokes tobacco at all,
&gt;&gt; since
&gt;&gt; the technology to produce pure nicotine doses has existed for at least a
&gt;&gt; century.  I suspect that most nicotine addicts are sociopaths and get a
&gt;&gt; sort
&gt;&gt; of sadistic pleasure in forcing bystanders to ingest their drug exhaust
&gt;&gt; fumes.

&gt;&gt; ==================================================================
&gt;&gt; &quot;I don't believe in cigarettes, in fact when people smoke, I can't
&gt;&gt; hear what they're saying.  I've fine tuned myself to shut out the
&gt;&gt; words of smokers.  So I miss out on a lot of conversations.&quot;
&gt;&gt; -- Marilyn Manson
&gt;&gt; ==================================================================

&gt; I suspect people who think that much of Marilyn Manson should face the
&gt; truth about that tingling sensation on their tongue and back of their
&gt; throat. I doubt very much it has anything to do with nicotine. Most
&gt; anti-smokers are neurotic compulsives who wish they could rule society and
&gt; sob and blubber when they can't.
">

Sob and blubber? That's not what I notice...
I notice a lot of hateful words
He is a detriment to the cause of ridding society of cigarettes.

Element 115 , if you want to end the plague of tobacco, shut the fuck up.
YOU are the sociopath. Your own unjustified accusations indicate that.
My accusations? JUSTIFIED
What an idiot.

&gt; Smoking is a Reward

&gt; The first and last cigarette in the day are especially significant rewards. The
&gt; first one, smoked right after breakfast, is a sort of anticipated recompense.
&gt; The smoker has work to do, and he eases himself into the day's activities as
&gt; pleasantly as possible. He gives himself a little consolation prize in advance,
&gt; and at the same time manages to postpone the evil hour when he must begin his
&gt; hard day's work.

hmm, at least in mine case the first ciggarette is just to digest the
stuff in my stomach taken right after the breakfast and  I never
thought that I have work to do. I dont consider why should one gives
himself prize for what he has not performed &quot;in advance&quot;. As far my
experience is concearned I always urge for cigerrate whenever there is
something in my stomach. Specially after having a cup of tea or coffe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The last cigarette of the day is like &quot;closing a door.&quot; It is
&gt; something quite definite.

Most of the smokers will finish their day by emptying their bowls in
washrooms.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;One smoker explained: &quot;I nearly always smoke a
&gt; cigarette before going to bed. That finishes the day. I usually turn the light
&gt; out after I have smoked the last cigarette, and then turn over to sleep.&quot;
">

He must be facing some other psychological troubles and I am sure that
the day would still be not finished for him untill after moving around
in bed he would not take another cig for re-closing the door of the
day.
