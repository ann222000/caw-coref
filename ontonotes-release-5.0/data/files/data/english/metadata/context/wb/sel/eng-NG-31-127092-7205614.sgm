Today DH and I drove up to Gettysburg to meet his mother and sister
for lunch.  Then we did a little outlet shopping, then came home.  I
didn't get any exercise, other than walking around the outlet mall.  I
probably could have gotten out before we left (not until around 9:30)
but it was very cold and I wasn't feeling very well.  I've had a fair
bit of trouble sleeping this week -- I fall asleep okay but then wake
up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep -- been
awake today since around 3:00 a.m., though much of that was lying in
bed reading.  I decided I'd better try cutting out the Diet Pepsi for
a bit -- and have substituted a bit more wine than usual :-).

Food:

* 6:00 (home): 1 serving instant oatmeal w/ 22g peanut butter & 5g
flax seed
* 9:15 (home): 2 multigrain crackers w/ 2 slices f/f cheese
* 12:30 (restaurant): 8 oz. wine; 1 1/2 cups crab & corn bisque;
sandwich w/ 3 oz. turkey breast, 1 oz. melted brie, lettuce, & tomato
on Italian bread; 1 cup mixed greens w/ 1 tbsp vinaigrette; 1 bite of
DH's carrot cake
* 3:00 (candy shop in outlet mall): 1 chocolate covered caramel
* 8:30 (home): 2 cups beef barley soup; 8 oz. wine

Totals: 1608 calories (302 from alcohol), 43g fat (24%), 156g carbs
(39%),  76g protein (19%)

Exercise:  none

Going to bed now :-)
