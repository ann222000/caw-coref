I have a '95 Miata, purchased a couple years ago with what was reportedly a complete top from a 2000.
I now need to replace the top and want to make sure I order the right thing.  Anyone tell me a sure method of determining if I have an NB top frame?

Thanks.

Very easy to determine. A 1999 - 2005 top frame uses springs to
automatically fold the glass window down.
If your top has been retrofitted to the original 1995 frame, it will
require a slight push on the upper part of the window to get it started
down unless the springs were also swapped, which is unlikely.

There will also be visible straps connecting the frame to the rain rail
bolts in two places so that the window will pull up if the conversion
has been done.
