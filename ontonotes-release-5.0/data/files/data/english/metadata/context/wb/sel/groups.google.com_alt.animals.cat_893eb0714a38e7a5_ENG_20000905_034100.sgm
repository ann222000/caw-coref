Obviously you have nothing to do with cats, freedom of speech or any other
sensible argument. You are just here to cause trouble. My guess is you
were a part of that site and not your feeling sorry for yourself because
your such a failure.

Oh well. No harm done. We still won and they, or you lost.

only
&gt;&gt; what it wants them to. This action was taken by the free people for a
&gt; free

&gt; And what about the webmasters right to have the site up? Does one right
&gt; outweigh the other? If so, why?

&gt;&gt; Why should we as a free people be forced to accept such material in our
&gt;&gt; world?

&gt; Simple fact is that you are not FORCED to accept such material, you don't
&gt; need to go to the site, but like voyeurs all the cat lovers saw the post
and
&gt; just *had* to go and have a look and then a whinge, what a farce.

&gt;&gt; The other thing about this, we weren't censoring truthful and
&gt;&gt; legitimate information. That site contained straight out blatant lies
and
&gt;&gt; untrue statements. This ultimately leads to more people believing
invalid
&gt;&gt; information which further propagates the lies.

&gt; So to the uninformed we must believe you simply because you say so?

&gt;&gt; If they had put up valid information with reasonable and sensible
options

Cats being housebound is fine. If that site promoted cats being kept
indoors I would have supported them. And I agree that the feral cats are a
big problem in both the U.S. and Australia. I went to the site to be sure I
knew what was happening. Since you did not, you have no argument as to
whter it should be left up or not, in it's original form. Or do you make it
a habit of butting into conversation that you have no knowledge of? If we
had all taken your pathetic week and worthless effort and NOT visited the
site to see what it was, that site would still be up. It's only because
some of us care enough about the world we live in, this includes the
internet world, we took the time to clean out some garbage, which you seem
quite willing to live in.

The site came down, got changed into a more meaningful and sensible site to
promotes it's cause. That was MY desire and it happened. I\WE WON!!. In
fact, if I were to have seen this site now and not know what it originally
stood for, I would support it all the way. But knowing what they originally
stood for make me still doubt their good faith intentions and it will be
sometime before I will say &quot;yes&quot; to support them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Yes it is, because the remainder of people either do not have an opinion on
the subject or know that they do not have anything valid to support their
argument. So they stay smart and stay shut up, just like you should do.

Obviously you and I are going to be at odds over this. To keep bickering
back and forth will not change anything. Go ahead and post a follow up.
Call me names, insult my intellegence say whatever you want, you know, that
whole freedom of speech thingy. You can have the last word, I won't follow
up to it.

Sorry, you are wrong!!! Encouraging someone to perform an illegal act
by describing it in detail is not allowed on *most* ISP's. There are
some &quot;pollitically incorrect&quot; sites that specifically host these types
of things and I'm not sure how they get away with it.

Consider a paedophile who writes about how to have sex with a minor.
No pictures, just the written word. Most sensible people would object
to this just as strongly as if there had been pictures. And so they
should!! Paedophillia is an illegal activity and should not be
promoted anywhere. So is the inhuman treatment of animals.

:)responsibility and if they're so stupid (and anyone that takes action based
:)on what they read on a website they must really be stupid) then they're the
:)sort of people that will take action based on anything. There are heaps of
:)web sites out there that I would consider offensive such as the ones that
:)say the holocaust never happened. I don't visit those sites, I don't post

I have come across many sites that I considered offensive, but have
never felt the need to complain before this. Again, saying that the
holocaust didn't happen isn't illegal (BTW, I know that it did). The
difference is that this site was promoting illegal activity.

:)about them on newsgroups, I simply ignore them. That's what freedom is
:)about. The vocal minority are annoying but in the end the silent majority
:)will win.

Vocal yes, minority - don't be so sure! Not from the indications I
have had through email and on the newsgroups. Also the RSPCA didn't
seem to think it was a &quot;minority&quot; either! And I bet the site owner
had an inkling of the trouble he was in or he wouldn't have pulled the
site. Those who truly believe they are right don't back down.

:)Actually, my arguement becomes all the more valid. I believe in the right
:)to post what you want, it's called freedom of expression. I am against the
:)vocal minority trying to take that away with their rancid behaviour. I have
:)seen no proof on this NG that the information was incorrect, only what

Go back over my posts (if you care to, of course) and you prove me
wrong in any thing I have said. All of my facts regarding the
misinformation posted on the original site are correct. I have a
medical and animal welfare background and I know what I'm talking
about. You just try to prove me wrong.

:)people say. I KNOW cats spread disease and that they do a lot of damage to
:)the environment in various ways and that they can be pretty damn annoying.
:)I also know that I actively pick them up off the streets and take them to
:)the RSPCA/Pound on a regular basis (thus ensuring they are returned to their
:)neglectful owners DESEXED). I consider this being responsible, others may
:)consider that abusive. It's all a matter of opinion.

That is in no way abusive!! That's exactly what I would do if I found
a cat and couldn't take it in myself. You are doing that absolute
correct thing.

:)As it should be. It is weak and worthless to get all offended and jack up
:)about something that you didn't have to go and visit in the first place.
:)You guys remind me of the Fred Niles of the world who have to watch
:)pornography whilst being offended by it. Pretty stupid attitude.
:)Considering the opinions we all have it's pretty damn stupid too. Should we
:)remove all sites where the facts aren't provable? How about we burn all the
:)fictional books, because they aren't true.....

Pornography is not illegal. Offensive in lots of cases I'm sure, but
not illegal (well in most Australian states to some degree). And
fiction is a totally different matter. But this site told you how to
kill a cat - not an obviously fictional way of killing a cat, but an
actual real llife inhumane way of killing a cat. Promoting an illegal
activity.

:)Or they RESPECT anothers persons right to have and post an opinion. Why
:)should I shut up? Because *you* want me to? Are you now trying to remove
:)my right to have an opinion on the newsgroups? People like you are a real
:)threat to the rest of us because of your selfishness and narrowmindedness
:)and you would entice me to hurt cats more than any web page would.

Opinions are what the internet is all about. I am having one right
now. But if, in expressing my opinion, I intice you to perform an
illegal act then I have done something wrong. There is nothing you
have said in this letter that promoted illegal activity. Some of it
is ill-informed, but that is why I'm replying :)

A non offensive way is to:

drive down the road, if a cat runs on the road do not swerve, for if you
have an accident swerving to avoid a cat you may well cause injury to a
person and you will find yourself at fault as the law is quite specific
about that fact that if you swerve to avoid a cat and have an accident it is
your fault. In fact, it is in your best interests to continue over the cat
without swerving at all, unless you have enough time to fully assess the
situation and your swerving options. Personally I don't swerve as I won't
put my kids, myself, my car or others at risk over a cat that shouldn't be
outside anyway.

Have I enticed you to kill a cat? My guess is NO.

I was just read an Australian Geo Magazine , by Dick Smith. He is talking about
getting koala hospitals going and about them dying. It says that cats pass
koala chlamydia more rapidly than through koala mating. This is due to the
koala passing it on after an infected koala escapes. It talks about how cats
frequently attack koalas, but rarely does the cat make a meal of them.
Thought you would be interested.

I don't have statistics on keeping cats in at night, only anectodal
evicence from cat owners I know all around the world - and by far the
majority keep their cats indoors at least at night.

As for spaying, that's another issue. There are several research
papers available on the net. In Australia, one study in the early
90's showed that 72% of cats were desexed. A more recent study puts
it at closer to 90% - although even *I* doubt that that would be
entirely accurate. Even taking 72% that's still a clear majority.

Actually Vicki,

You made the statement. YOU find a RESEARCH paper that shows that 90% are
desexed because not only didn't you use a research paper, you misquoted the
page that you found.

I don't need to disprove your statement, you need to prove it.

Actually Bron

I was responding to someone saying that the majority of cats were
outdoors. *I* didn't even bring up spaying/neutering.

But just to show you that I back up what I say with checkable research
here's a link you might like to try:

http://www.petnet.com.au/People_and_Pets/52UAMR.HTML

The following is a quote from that page:

START QUOTE

3.4 CATS AS COMPANION ANIMALS
Some features of cats
Some features of cats as companion animals are:

57% are female

90% are desexed

55% are described as 'energetic'

50% are mostly indoors but 61% are said to be inside at night

While domestic or 'moggie' is by far and away the most common type of
cat-83%-Persian is a popular pedigree

Ownership of (or by) cats is spread evenly across families and
non-partnered individuals

Reflecting this different mix of owners (to dog ownership), 31% leave
their cats without company for more than 40 hours a week (cf dogs,
only 4%).

END QUOTE

You'll note the two interesting points in this - 90% of cats are
desexed and 61% are kept inside at night. Exactly as I said, a
majority in both cases.

Now would you like to find me a relevant, checkable reference that
differs from this?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As for spaying, that's another issue. There are several research

&gt;90's showed that 72% of cats were desexed. A more recent study puts
&gt;it at closer to 90% - although even *I* doubt that that would be

flawed. Surveys like this required effort and people willing to put in the
effort generally care for their pets. Therefore all you have there is a
survey of responsible people, excluding the irresponsible (majority) and the
feral or non owned cats. Specifically, it's crap and in addition to being
crap, it's missing the major factors of demographics.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Vicki, I conceed that 90% of INSIDE cats may be desexed, however INSIDE cats
do not make up that large a proportion of the cats in Australia. This is
where your information is incorrect. I am curious as to how many cats there
are in Australia and how many of the TOTAL are desexed. Crowing over the
actions of responsible cat owners is, in itself, irresponsible because it
does not bring attention to the irresponsible people who allow their cats to
roam free rooting and breeding unchecked.

I thought my feelings on inside cats was quite plain. I don't see the
inside cat owners as being any problem at all, it's the others and the feral
cats that are the issue.

&gt; When, oh when, will people accept that different countries bring with

&gt; others presume to tell people in other countries that they should keep
&gt; their cats inside when you clearly have absolutely no idea what it's
&gt; like here?

&gt; For the hundred and fifty-first time (well, it feels like that), here we
&gt; do not have &quot;indigenous animal life&quot; that threatens our cats.

&gt; The last time I read the instructions on all the garden herbicides and
&gt; insecticides on sale in the garden centre there wasn't a single one that
&gt; didn't say something like &quot;Safe for children and pets&quot;. You'd have to
&gt; search very hard to find one that was dangerous to cats in this country,
&gt; and then I'm not sure you'd actually find one in the end. You'd
&gt; probably have to deliberately use some other substance that you knew was
&gt; harmful, and I assure you that British cats are not dying in droves - or
&gt; even singles - from this cause. One thing I know without doubt is that
&gt; if a product had ever proved to be harmful to cats there'd have been an
&gt; absolute uproar here and that product would have been withdrawn. The
&gt; British simply wouldn't accept a product that harmed their pets.

&gt; Anti-freeze does not lie in puddles all over our streets the way it
&gt; appears to lie all over yours, and someone else recently posted that our
&gt; manufacturers put something in it that stops animals wanting to drink it
&gt; anyway. The vets at our practice tell us that they've never in their
&gt; careers seen a cat made ill by anti-freeze, because we asked them after
&gt; reading about it on these NGs.

&gt; The fact is that where *you* live it's dangerous for a cat to be
&gt; outside, but where millions of others live it isn't. And as much as
&gt; most of what Bob/Sally/Frank posts is crap, what he says about this is
&gt; true. Most people worldwide *do* allow their cats outside during the
&gt; day and most of those cats live long, happy and healthy indoor/outdoor
&gt; lives - because their conditions are very, very different from yours.

&gt; As for the supposed environmental effect of cats? Even the bird
&gt; societies here concede that domestic cats make little or no impression
&gt; on the British bird population. In fact we, and most of our cat-owning
&gt; friends, are members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,
&gt; which is one of Britain's major charities.

&gt; Please, before you start lecturing someone on how dangerous it is for
&gt; them to let their cats outside, look to see where they're posting from.
&gt; It DOES make a big difference.

"/> It really must be cool to live in a country with no cars, no trucks, no mean
people, no open sheds or garbage that cats can get caught in, no pesticides
or herbicides. I'd personally love to live in a country filled with cat
loving neighbours who invite them to their gardens, and a country that
relies on organic gardening, with streets filled with walking citizens
looking out for each other's cats....

err... I forgot. Which country is that again? Cause that IS different!

&gt; Could it be that car drivers seem to hit animals more at night than

&gt; In the UK we have a large cat population but I do not hear people
&gt; going on about this animals, or that bird, is in danger of extinction
&gt; due to cats.

"/> Yes, cats have had an impact on mirgatory bird populations in North America.
Of course, in your country apart from house sparrows, starlings, and
pigeons... the indiginous species are already gone. No doubt partially due
to the long history of cats eating them, combined with habitat destruction.
Granted, you guys have nothing to lose anymore, except rats and starlings.

&gt; What you say may be true - but how often is a cat likely to come

"/> Often enough for myself to lose a cat to antifreeze poisoning before I got
smart about the outside issue. Even if you only get a hose leak once a year
in your neighbourhood, a cat only dies once. If the chances of your cat
finding this once a year leak are only 1 in 5, that gives your cat an
average lifespan of 5 years. Not acceptable, nor responsible. All of these
are avoidable risks, and there is no excuse.

You know you've lost an arguement when you critize a person's language. In the
States here it's not *arse* it's plain old ass..... But that is probably too
hard for you to understand now isn't it?

&lt;hands Bron a simple english comprehension book, hoping it'll help him&gt;

&gt;&gt; Bron,

&gt;&gt; You have done nothing of the sort. You have proven that you are not a cat
&gt;&gt; loving individual and are only here to stir up sh*t so why don't you take
&gt;&gt; your fat ass and leave Vicki the hell alone? Don't let the door hit you
&gt; in
&gt;&gt; the ass on your way out!

&gt; Ass? Ass? Obviously your as stupid as you sound. Why don't you f.ck off
&gt; and don't let the door hit your fat ARSE on the way out.

&gt; Vicki may be wrong, but she's in no way as stupid as you are.

&gt; Yeah folks, only let your cats outdoors during the day.
&gt; Because everyone knows that cars and indigenous animal
&gt; life always sleep during day time!
&gt; Even the herbicide your neighbours spray on their lawns
&gt; only wakes at night. Antifreeze leaking from cars always
&gt; stops before morning, then continues in the evening.

"/> When, oh when, will people accept that different countries bring with
them different conditions? I wouldn't presume to tell you that it's
safe to let your cats out where you live, so why do you and so many
others presume to tell people in other countries that they should keep
their cats inside when you clearly have absolutely no idea what it's
like here?

For the hundred and fifty-first time (well, it feels like that), here we
do not have &quot;indigenous animal life&quot; that threatens our cats.

The last time I read the instructions on all the garden herbicides and
insecticides on sale in the garden centre there wasn't a single one that
didn't say something like &quot;Safe for children and pets&quot;. You'd have to
search very hard to find one that was dangerous to cats in this country,
and then I'm not sure you'd actually find one in the end. You'd
probably have to deliberately use some other substance that you knew was
harmful, and I assure you that British cats are not dying in droves - or
even singles - from this cause. One thing I know without doubt is that
if a product had ever proved to be harmful to cats there'd have been an
absolute uproar here and that product would have been withdrawn. The
British simply wouldn't accept a product that harmed their pets.

Anti-freeze does not lie in puddles all over our streets the way it
appears to lie all over yours, and someone else recently posted that our
manufacturers put something in it that stops animals wanting to drink it
anyway. The vets at our practice tell us that they've never in their
careers seen a cat made ill by anti-freeze, because we asked them after
reading about it on these NGs.

The fact is that where *you* live it's dangerous for a cat to be
outside, but where millions of others live it isn't. And as much as
most of what Bob/Sally/Frank posts is crap, what he says about this is
true. Most people worldwide *do* allow their cats outside during the
day and most of those cats live long, happy and healthy indoor/outdoor
lives - because their conditions are very, very different from yours.

As for the supposed environmental effect of cats? Even the bird
societies here concede that domestic cats make little or no impression
on the British bird population. In fact we, and most of our cat-owning
friends, are members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,
which is one of Britain's major charities.

Please, before you start lecturing someone on how dangerous it is for
them to let their cats outside, look to see where they're posting from.
It DOES make a big difference.

&gt; How do work that out Bron?

"/> Cats allowed outside very rarely damage their owners property. They go next
door and shit in the &quot;cat hater/garden lover&quot;s garden, they eat the budgie
down the street who was put out for a bit of fresh air, they then jump on a
neighbours car, with the new sloped type cars they then find themselves
sliding down the bonnet and as all good cats know, when that happens just
extend your claws and go with it - result major scratch marks down the
bonnett (want to see the pictures?)

Cat owners on the whole (with the exception of myself and a limited number
of others) are selfish and unthinking. They fail to understand that no one
else loves their cat as they do and they believe that a cat has every right
to be outside. That's simply crap. No &quot;introduced&quot; animal has any right to
wander the streets. I've read the cat lovers literature about how they
supposedly don't kill the wildlife. But having lived in a semi rural
environment, I can vouch for the fact that they do. Claims that they only
eat rabbits and birds make sense too, but only because they've already
pushed all the native animals out of their habitat. In Australia alone we
have made hundreds (or thousands) of native species extinct by introducing
vermin such as rabbits, mice and cats.

Don't get me wrong..... cats are great critters (especially when the
subwoofer is on :-), but they have no place outside in a country that they
are not native to. I keep mine inside or in a run. I do that no only
because they're expensive and my kids would be really upset if they became
road pizza, but also because I respect my neighbours and I respect my
environment and I LOVE the native wildlife (my current house backs onto a
reserve).

I have a blue tounged lizard living in my back yard who is at risk from the
neighbours cat. But as I am VERY STRICT on outside cats (I trap them in my
yard), he has survived for 2 years so far (and yes, he can come and go as he
pleases, I removed the bottom of some pailings). Native animals rock,
outside cats suck.

People who allow their cats to roam free are cheap and selfish, they allow
their pets to inconvenience others and they show their neighbours no
respect, they then have the nerve to whinge and whine when the neighbours
get so annoyed they take action.

That's how I worked it out.

much longer than here, we've only had cats since we were illegally populated

In Australia they are trying to clone the thylacine to re introduce it into
the &quot;wild&quot;, it will be a natural preditor to the cat :-) But this move
towards repopulating extinct species is a good one and fully supported by
many people here. Personally, I can't wait. I think we should erradicate

"/> Interesting. In our country we have laws not only regarding the labelling
of herbicidal/pesticide products, but when applications are applied in
populated areas, little signs must be placed on the edge of your property
that warn people that herbicide or pesticides are in use. All popular
herbicides (including the less lethal kill alls, such as organic-phospherous
Monsato kind), as well as the &quot;weed&amp;feed&quot; killex (Organo-cloride 2-4D based
fertilizers) tell us not to allow the chemical to come into contact with
skin while being applied. Because of the dangers inherent in using these
substances to people, wildlife, and the environment, the use of such
chemicals are now very controversial in North America and has spawned
something called the &quot;Organic Movement&quot; and tougher laws regarding when and
where such chemicals can be used.

selective herbicides, including such brand names as &quot;Killex&quot;, and the

related chemicals generally have no effective replacement when it comes to
selective weed killers. It's use is very controversial for reasons beyond
the subject of this newsgroup, but let us say that it's use in parks and
other public areas was banned long ago. For this reason the &quot;grass&quot; in our
public parks is a rather diverse mix of grass, dandilions, and other weeds

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Antifreeze leaking from cars always stops before morning, then

&gt;&gt;&gt; What you say may be true - but how often is a cat likely to come
&gt;&gt;&gt; across spilt antifreeze?

&gt;&gt;Often enough for myself to lose a cat to antifreeze poisoning before I
got
&gt;&gt;smart about the outside issue. Even if you only get a hose leak once a
year
&gt;&gt;in your neighbourhood, a cat only dies once. If the chances of your cat
&gt;&gt;finding this once a year leak are only 1 in 5, that gives your cat an
&gt;&gt;average lifespan of 5 years. Not acceptable, nor responsible. All of
these
&gt;&gt;are avoidable risks, and there is no excuse.

&gt; I will reverse that. Not acceptable, nor responsible, to drive/own a
&gt; car that represents a danger to wildlife.

"/> I like that. Now your gaining a tiny glimmer of environmental consciousness
(suggest you read about herbicide and pesticide use and dangers however). I
encourage you to spread the word, since cars are not only a danger to cats,
but will impact the quality of life or survival of the future generations of
all life. While we *both* work on convincing people of your excellent
suggestion, we both realize that it is much easier to protect our cat
tomorrow morning than it is to eliminate the use of cars tomorrow morning.
We control and protect what we can today, while working to influence others
our entire lives. But again, I agree good suggestion. Hope the planet read
that last statement of yours. My great-great grandchildren to be born will
thank you.

Well, its just basic fact, manners, and proper care.
No one's pet has the right to do as they please on
another person's property unless the property owner is OK with it.
Responsible pet owners don't allow it.
Its not necessary to the animal in the least.
Its proper with both dogs and cats, they are entitled
to their owners property, nothing else.
We only have a couple here who think otherwise, and
their &quot;logic&quot; is not logic, or right.
Which of course never stops them from endless posts,
which in turn never changes the truth.

&gt;&gt; How do work that out Bron?

&gt; Cats allowed outside very rarely damage their owners property. They go next
&gt; door and shit in the &quot;cat hater/garden lover&quot;s garden, they eat the budgie
&gt; down the street who was put out for a bit of fresh air, they then jump on a
&gt; neighbours car, with the new sloped type cars they then find themselves
&gt; sliding down the bonnet and as all good cats know, when that happens just
&gt; extend your claws and go with it - result major scratch marks down the
&gt; bonnett (want to see the pictures?)

&gt; Cat owners on the whole (with the exception of myself and a limited number
&gt; of others) are selfish and unthinking. They fail to understand that no one
&gt; else loves their cat as they do and they believe that a cat has every right
&gt; to be outside. That's simply crap. No &quot;introduced&quot; animal has any right to
&gt; wander the streets. I've read the cat lovers literature about how they
&gt; supposedly don't kill the wildlife. But having lived in a semi rural
&gt; environment, I can vouch for the fact that they do. Claims that they only
&gt; eat rabbits and birds make sense too, but only because they've already
&gt; pushed all the native animals out of their habitat. In Australia alone we
&gt; have made hundreds (or thousands) of native species extinct by introducing
&gt; vermin such as rabbits, mice and cats.

&gt; Don't get me wrong..... cats are great critters (especially when the
&gt; subwoofer is on :-), but they have no place outside in a country that they
&gt; are not native to. I keep mine inside or in a run. I do that no only
&gt; because they're expensive and my kids would be really upset if they became
&gt; road pizza, but also because I respect my neighbours and I respect my
&gt; environment and I LOVE the native wildlife (my current house backs onto a
&gt; reserve).

&gt; I have a blue tounged lizard living in my back yard who is at risk from the
&gt; neighbours cat. But as I am VERY STRICT on outside cats (I trap them in my
&gt; yard), he has survived for 2 years so far (and yes, he can come and go as he
&gt; pleases, I removed the bottom of some pailings). Native animals rock,
&gt; outside cats suck.

&gt; People who allow their cats to roam free are cheap and selfish, they allow
&gt; their pets to inconvenience others and they show their neighbours no
&gt; respect, they then have the nerve to whinge and whine when the neighbours
&gt; get so annoyed they take action.

&gt; That's how I worked it out.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OLD STUFF SNIPPED

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Once diluted for application I don't think weed killer is very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dangerous - unless drunk direct.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh is that right? You don't think? hmm...read the directions of any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;herbicide and they ALL SAY: Keep kids and pets from walking in
treated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;areas for a few days after application.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just looked, neither of the week killer I have say anything like that.

&gt;&gt;Interesting. In our country we have laws not only regarding the
labelling
&gt;&gt;of herbicidal/pesticide products, but when applications are applied in
&gt;&gt;populated areas, little signs must be placed on the edge of your property
&gt;&gt;that warn people that herbicide or pesticides are in use.

&gt; We also have very strict laws, many I think implemented before other
&gt; countries followed suit.

&gt; But putting signs up!!! I don't think they allow us to have chemicals
&gt; that bad.

&gt;&gt;All popular
&gt;&gt;herbicides (including the less lethal kill alls, such as
organic-phospherous
&gt;&gt;Monsato kind), as well as the &quot;weed&amp;feed&quot; killex (Organo-cloride 2-4D
based
&gt;&gt;fertilizers) tell us not to allow the chemical to come into contact with
&gt;&gt;skin while being applied.

&gt; Most of ours say wash off skin.

&gt;&gt;Because of the dangers inherent in using these
&gt;&gt;substances to people, wildlife, and the environment, the use of such
&gt;&gt;chemicals are now very controversial in North America and has spawned
&gt;&gt;something called the &quot;Organic Movement&quot; and tougher laws regarding when
and
&gt;&gt;where such chemicals can be used.

&gt; I can see what you are saying if it was a case of prolonged exposure,
&gt; or exposure to concentrated stuff. But the only advise on ours is
&gt; usually to keep the bottle (the concentrated form) away from children
&gt; and pets. Once diluted the only warning it not to spray near ponds.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hope your roaming cats read the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;directions well. How about you drink some diluted 24D and tell me how
&gt;&gt;*you*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;feel after? Actually, just wipe your hand on treated grass and lick.
I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;want to watch.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What is 24D? Any relation to WD40?

&gt;&gt;2-4D is the most popular organo-chloride based chemical used in a variety
of
&gt;&gt;selective herbicides, including such brand names as &quot;Killex&quot;, and the
&gt;&gt;&quot;weed&amp;feeds&quot; that commonly obtainable in local garden centeres. 2-4D and
&gt;&gt;related chemicals generally have no effective replacement when it comes
to
&gt;&gt;selective weed killers. It's use is very controversial for reasons
beyond
&gt;&gt;the subject of this newsgroup, but let us say that it's use in parks and
&gt;&gt;other public areas was banned long ago. For this reason the &quot;grass&quot; in
our
&gt;&gt;public parks is a rather diverse mix of grass, dandilions, and other
weeds
&gt;&gt;:-)

&gt; Has been here for years, but that is because such a mix is more hard
&gt; wearing and requires less maintenance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Antifreeze leaking from cars always stops before morning, then
&gt;&gt;continues
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the evening.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What you say may be true - but how often is a cat likely to come
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; across spilt antifreeze?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Often enough for myself to lose a cat to antifreeze poisoning before I
&gt;&gt;got

a
&gt;&gt;year
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in your neighbourhood, a cat only dies once. If the chances of your
cat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;finding this once a year leak are only 1 in 5, that gives your cat an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;average lifespan of 5 years. Not acceptable, nor responsible. All of
&gt;&gt;these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are avoidable risks, and there is no excuse.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I will reverse that. Not acceptable, nor responsible, to drive/own a
&gt;&gt;&gt; car that represents a danger to wildlife.

&gt;&gt;I like that. Now your gaining a tiny glimmer of environmental

I
&gt;&gt;encourage you to spread the word, since cars are not only a danger to
cats,
&gt;&gt;but will impact the quality of life or survival of the future generations
of
&gt;&gt;all life.

&gt; This, if you have read it, it what Bob has been saying quite often. If
&gt; you elect to treat your cats like babies and keep them in to safeguard
&gt; them then that is all you do - safeguard the cat. But if you take
&gt; action against the dangers that can befall a cat, you also save a lot
&gt; of other wildlife.

&gt;&gt;While we *both* work on convincing people of your excellent
&gt;&gt;suggestion, we both realize that it is much easier to protect our cat
&gt;&gt;tomorrow morning than it is to eliminate the use of cars tomorrow
morning.

&gt; Wrong. I cannot protect my cats from cars unless I do the unacceptable
&gt; and keep them in. Sorry, but I am not prepared to see one of God's
&gt; most wonderful creatures deprived of its right to go out. You may be,
&gt; if you are I feel very sorry for your cats, but that is your choice.

&gt; However, please remember that this is not necessarily what is best for

"/> Don't you think we care about our cats?

The difference is that we want to give out cats one aspect of life
that is VERY important to their physical and metal well being - access
to the outside world.

Of course having a cat die is very sad, but we all go through it at
some time - they don't live forever. And I would rather a cat had 15
years of good life than 17/18 years locked inside.

If you can't let your cats out because of excessive dangers (something
that I think rarely exists except in the imagination of the owner)
then really you have to say to yourself &quot;should I keep cats&quot;.

A cat is a wild animal that has condescended to live with us, we have
NO right to deprive it of the freedom to go outside. This is something
that I, and most people outside North America seem to be able to
understand - why is it so difficult for you?

If that were the case, very few people in Australia would be able to

In Australia cat lovers are definately leaning towards keeping their
animals indoors - at least at night. This is not a North American
phenomenem.

You've given no good reason to let cats go out, but many people have
given extremely valid reasons to keep them inside. While it's fine to
have an opinion, it's always better to be able to actually back it up.

:)&gt;:)Don't you think we care about our cats?
:)&gt;
:)&gt;I know that you do care about cats, Bob. You really do believe that
:)&gt;you are doing the right thing by the cat. But are you doing the right
:)&gt;thing by the environment and other people as well?
:)
:)Yes, because I believe that a cat is part of the environment and that
:)is does little harm to it.
:)&gt;
:)&gt;:)The difference is that we want to give out cats one aspect of life
:)&gt;:)that is VERY important to their physical and metal well being - access
:)&gt;:)to the outside world.
:)&gt;
:)&gt;Where do you get the idea that being outside is *very* important to
:)&gt;cats? I have never seen a cat that suffered any ill effect whatsoever
:)&gt;form being inside, but I have seen *many* suffer by being outdoors.
:)&gt;Tell me in what way do cats suffer by being indoors only?
:)
:)Just spend one week reading the cat newsgroups. The number of cases of
:)disturbed cats (if the groups are remotely representative) is
:)astronomical. Cats are still wild animals, very friendly wild animals
:)I'll agree - but they need their freedom to go outside.
:)&gt;
:)&gt;:)If you can't let your cats out because of excessive dangers (something
:)&gt;:)that I think rarely exists except in the imagination of the owner)
:)&gt;:)then really you have to say to yourself &quot;should I keep cats&quot;.
:)&gt;
:)&gt;If that were the case, very few people in Australia would be able to
:)&gt;keep cats. The damage to the environment here is enourmous and some
:)&gt;of it is directly attributable to cats (although not as much as
:)&gt;cat-haters would like to make out).
:)
:)That may be true. It is not for me to say what happens in Australia -
:)except to point out that the Australian cat is not different from the
:)UK cat or the American cat of the Russian cat - and they ALL need
:)access to the outdoors.
:)&gt;
:)&gt;:)A cat is a wild animal that has condescended to live with us, we have
:)&gt;:)NO right to deprive it of the freedom to go outside. This is something
:)&gt;:)that I, and most people outside North America seem to be able to
:)&gt;:)understand - why is it so difficult for you?
:)&gt;
:)&gt;In Australia cat lovers are definately leaning towards keeping their
:)&gt;animals indoors - at least at night. This is not a North American
:)&gt;phenomenem.
:)
:)At night yes, the old Fred Flintstone job of putting the cat out for
:)the night is now the reverse.
:)&gt;
:)&gt;You've given no good reason to let cats go out, but many people have
:)&gt;given extremely valid reasons to keep them inside. While it's fine to
:)&gt;have an opinion, it's always better to be able to actually back it up.

&gt;Actually, selfish cats owners LET cat's outside (they don't just &quot;go

I got a kitten a few weeks back. He sat crying with his nose plastered
to the front door until I started letting him out. He and the others
run in to use the litter tray, then back out to carry on playing. I
also got a rescue last December who behaved in a similar manner with the
addition of puddles until I let him out.

Both of these cats would be very unhappy to be kept inside for good. I
try to get them in a night because of the traffic dangers, and three of
them know how to go round the back of the house (it's a mid-terrace) to
get in via the cat flap, so they can come in whenever they want. They
can't get out that way.

So what do you suggest those of us with cats which are determined to go
out and unhappy if they can't, do?

If you want your cats to be truly safe, you persist. I have a cat,
Lottie, that does just this. She sits at the door (screened)
sometimes and meows. But she gets over it! It only goes on for a few
minutes and then she's back cuddling on my lap. And I'm safe in the
knowledge that she's not going to get run over, poisoned or hurt the
environment.

As I've said *many* times before on this ng, I've never seen an
indoors only cat that suffered any long term damage from being
indoors. But I've seen many outdoors cats killed or badly hurt by
being outdoors.

I know what I'd rather.

Absolutely!! But we cut the danger down immeasurably by not giving
them access to outdoors dangers as well.

:)But what about all the dangers in the house?

And I might add, even with dangers in the home, I've never heard of a
cat actually being killed by being in the house. Sure there are the
dangers of poisoning (which can be averted by putting chemicals up
high) and electrocution (also avoidable if you care for your
electrics) (to name just two). Most of these dangers, however, can be
minimised if not eliminated. Oh, and then there's the little matter
of chocolate :))

:)And as I've said before, a lot of the cats whose owners post here
:)looking for help with behaviour problems would not have developed
:)those problems if the had been let out.

The only behavioural problems that I've heard of are furniture
scratching and spraying. Unfortunately both things can occur even if
the cat is let out for some of the time. So letting them outdoors
doesn't garuantee that it won't happen.

:)You are, I'm sad to say, putting your interests before that of your
:)cat's.

In fact, I'm putting the life of the cat before my own interests. It
would be *so* much easier for me to let them out every morning and not
let them back in until dinner time. No litter trays to clean for one!
But instead I keep them inside for *their* protection.

Guess this is another case of agree to disagree. But I think it's
good for others in this ng to see both sides of the argument before
making a decision.

&gt;Absolutely!! But we cut the danger down immeasurably by not giving
&gt;them access to outdoors dangers as well.

"/> Do we? The can only be subject to one set of dangers at a time. That
is like saying I will go by ship on holiday this year because that way
I will not subject myself to the dangers of flying.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;:)But what about all the dangers in the house?

&gt;And I might add, even with dangers in the home, I've never heard of a
&gt;cat actually being killed by being in the house. Sure there are the
&gt;dangers of poisoning (which can be averted by putting chemicals up
&gt;high)

"/> Cats climb.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and electrocution (also avoidable if you care for your electrics)
&gt;(to name just two).

"/> A real problem with a bored cat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Most of these dangers, however, can be
&gt;minimised if not eliminated. Oh, and then there's the little matter
&gt;of chocolate :))

"/> But so can the dangers outside - most of which are actually very small
anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;:)And as I've said before, a lot of the cats whose owners post here
&gt;:)looking for help with behaviour problems would not have developed
&gt;:)those problems if the had been let out.

&gt;The only behavioural problems that I've heard of are furniture
&gt;scratching and spraying. Unfortunately both things can occur even if
&gt;the cat is let out for some of the time. So letting them outdoors
&gt;doesn't garuantee that it won't happen.

"/> As I've said before, I've never know an indoor/outdoor cat spray in
the house unless there was something very seriously wrong with it
either mentally of physically. The odd scratching I expect, people who
don't do not know cats. But that it reduced greatly by allowing a cat
outside.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;:)You are, I'm sad to say, putting your interests before that of your
&gt;:)cat's.

&gt;In fact, I'm putting the life of the cat before my own interests. It
&gt;would be *so* much easier for me to let them out every morning and not
&gt;let them back in until dinner time. No litter trays to clean for one!
&gt;But instead I keep them inside for *their* protection.

"/> No, I still believe you are putting your interests ahead of the cats.
The cat needs to go out, it is part of its nature. Sadly a small
percentage of cats let out will die, your choice is to avoid the
heartbreak that such a death brings to you by depriving your cats of
an essential part of their lives.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Guess this is another case of agree to disagree. But I think it's
&gt;good for others in this ng to see both sides of the argument before
&gt;making a decision.

"/> Very true. Air the facts, give reasons, balance the argument, then
like any good debate it is up to the listeners(readers) to make their
choice.

Aw yes Alley Cat, and before you go about insulting me in relation to the
USA... perhaps you should learn to check the &quot;address&quot; of my posts. This
will help prevent you from looking like a much bigger fool than myself.
And from my visits to both countries, there are certainly simularities that
our country does not share with either of you. However, it seems you want
to get into a country bashing and &quot;mine is better than yours&quot; argument. I
suggest the following newsgroup:

"/> The address of your posts shows that you are either in the USA, Canada,
Australia, Netherlands or Japan. My news server is down for
maintenance, so I'm having to read through Deja which means the source
code of your post isn't available. If it was I'd know exactly which
country you're posting from. It matters little which it is because they
all mean that you are not British, and are not, therefore, in a position
to tell those of us who are that you know our country better than we do.

The only one of those countries I haven't visited is Japan, and I
wouldn't presume to tell Americans, Canadians, Australians or the Dutch
that what they're saying about their own countries isn't true. Nor
would I presume to tell them whether it's safe for their cats to go
outside where they live. Because I don't know where they live, just as
you have absolutely no idea where anybody on this NG lives.

You could tell me you live in Amsterdam and I still wouldn't be able to
judge. I know Amsterdam well, and I know that parts of it would be
dangerous for outside cats and parts wouldn't. The fact is I'm not in a
position to judge others' situations, and neither are you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; it seems you want to get into a country bashing and &quot;mine

"/> Which yet again shows that you have not made any attempt to research
what you're talking about or the person you're talking to. It also
shows that you don't read what people are saying to you. Had you done
so you would know that I have continually posted to the effect that as
our countries are so different, none of us is in a position to judge the
other.

The only thing I do say, and many non-Brits here would agree - and have
in the past agreed during various discussions - is that the British
treat their animals better than many other nations treat theirs. We're
not perfect, but we're a damned sight better than most. That's not
country-bashing, it's a fact.

It has been you, not me, who has been so anxious to make snap (and
unfounded) judgements about other countries. It has been you, not me,
who has bashed anybody who tells you that because of the environment
where they live they make a different choice from the one you make as to
the care of their cats. It has been you, not me, who has point blank
refused to accept that other people are better able to judge what is and
isn't safe for their cats when you don't have the faintest idea of the
environment those people are living in. It has been you, not me, who
has consistently tried to impose your belief and viewpoint on anyone who
disagrees with you, regardless of your lack of information about their
situation.

It has been me who has posted when other Brits have made anti-American,
anti-anything-not-British remarks, trying to get them to accept that
they are also not in a position to judge.

Have I once told you that you should let your cats outside? Have I once
told you that the choices you make for them are wrong? No, and nor
would I, because while I have visited your country I have no knowledge
of your personal environment and would not presume to be so arrogant.

You, on the other hand, presume to be so arrogant to everyone who
happens to disagree with your completely unfounded viewpoint.

"/> You've been here? You've visited? Oh well, that makes all the

the whole of the UK then? From John O'Groats to Lands End? Both sides
of the Pennines? The Orkneys? The Isle of Man? The Scillies? Yep, a
visitor. Well that surely does mean that you know this country so much
better than we Brits do then.

I've been to Sydney and Perth, does that mean I know Australia? Does
that mean I can judge the situation of anyone who lives anywhere in Oz?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's just like it is on TV.
&gt; As crowded, cooky,

"/> Ah yes, if it's on TV it must be true. Parts of the UK are crowded,
certainly. Parts of it are wide open empty spaces. But then surely you
should know that, as you've visited?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and dangerous as any country.

"/> Dangerous? I guess that depends on your definition. Are you talking
about pollution? Disease control? Road traffic fatalities/accidents?
Murders? Danger is a relative term and needs to be more tightly defined
before we can be compared with other countries. It would depend on
which area you're referring to as to whether Britain's more or less
&quot;dangerous&quot; than other individual countries.

Certainly I have no worries walking along the streets where I live at
night. Certainly our crime rate is low compared with many other
countries. Even our police, when appearing on television to try to
catch certain criminals, tell us not to worry and not to get things out
of proportion because it's really a pretty safe country.

Let me ask you a question. How dangerous is it in St Mary's? For me
and for my cats?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In fact, much more so than ours just because
&gt; of your drastically higher population density.

"/> Like any country we have densely populated areas. We also have sparsely
populated areas. Your problem with logical debate is that you assume
that everyone you're talking to is living in precisely the situation you
envisage, when in fact you have absolutely no idea.

You haven't a clue whether my cats are going outside in the middle of
London or on the remotest island of the Hebrides. You don't know
whether the neighbours I refer to are in an apartment block in Docklands
or whether they're crofters. Yet you cast your judgement regardless.
Not the most intelligent way to attempt to conduct an adult discussion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And your pesticides and herbicides are ....
&gt; just like the pesticides and herbicides sold to any other
&gt; country.

"/> Clearly they're not, as you tell us that your cats would die instantly
if they came into contact with them, yet ours don't. Because they're
&quot;Safe for children and animals&quot;, but we've already established that you
don't understand what that means.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I do participate in organic gardening clubs with many uk
&gt; citizens who are more environmentally conscious than their
&gt; neighbours (who they complain about constantly).

"/> By which you prove my point and disprove your own. I'm sure some people
don't like cats and I'm sure they complain. But they're not going
round killing other people's cats are they? They're complaining. The
Brits are actually extremely good at complaining, we do it a lot.
And that's all people do here where cats are concerned, which is why
it's safe for cats to go outside. Happily, where I live, virtually
everyone has at least one cat and those who don't have them like them,
so nobody complains.

I don't like other people's kids much, but I have to put up with them
when I go outside because that's life. I complain about them, but I
don't kill them. That's the way we do things here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And I suspect that you are in the minority in the
&gt; uk, having to walk to your house miles from a road.

"/> Dear oh dear, you do like to throw yourself at conclusions don't you?
You *do* like to put words into people's mouths to fit your own
preconceptions. Did I say I had to &quot;walk to my house miles from a
road&quot;? Most certainly not. There's a road not far away, but is it a
busy main road or is it a lane? Is it a dual carriageway or is it
a mere track?

I said I don't have a road running outside my house and you leap to the
conclusion that I claimed to be &quot;miles from a road&quot;. With leaps of
illogic like that it really is impossible to have any kind of logical
debate with you.

It's been like having a boy-band (without the income) this summer!
There have been groups of 10-year old girls wandering outside my house
so they can see the cats. They each have their favourite and pick them
up and cuddle them. The cats &amp; the girls all love it. However I do
keep a weather eye open to make sure they don't fall too much in love
with a cat and try to take it home.

I have one neighbour who thinks I have trained my cats to cr*p in his
garden (egocentric). My secret is that I'm planning on training the
slugs to eat his plants not mine!

purred the following:

:)A cat should never be kept in all the time - it is very cruel.

You keep saying this, but you never say *why*. There are lots of
reasons not to let a cat out:

No risk from cars
No risk from nasty neighbours
Cat won't hurt native animals
Cat won't upset neighbours (even the nice ones)
Cat won't run away
Cat won't get stolen (yes this is a problem for purebreds)
Little risk from disease (if the cat can't come into contact with it
it can't get it)

Now you give me similar sensible reasons to let them go out and tell
me why it is &quot;cruel&quot; to keep them in.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd personally love to live in a country filled with

&gt;&gt;Then come and live here. There are now getting on for 20 cats in the
&gt;&gt;surrounding houses here (more seem to arrive every day!), and every
&gt;&gt;neighbour welcomes ours not only into their gardens, but into their
&gt;&gt;houses, as we welcome theirs. It's been the same everywhere I've ever
&gt;&gt;lived.

&gt;&gt;All my life my cats have visited the neighbours. Ours regularly come
&gt;&gt;home smelling of other people's perfumes around their necks where
&gt;&gt;they've been kissed and cuddled. Our neighbour opposite tells me that
&gt;&gt;her little girl adores our cats visiting, and plays with them in their
&gt;&gt;garden every day. The only reason they're not invited inside is because
&gt;&gt;the husband suffers from asthma.

&gt;&gt;FACT: The British love cats.
&gt;&gt;FACT: Those British who don't actually love cats don't harm them.

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; It's been like having a boy-band (without the income) this summer!
&gt; There have been groups of 10-year old girls wandering outside my house
&gt; so they can see the cats. They each have their favourite and pick them
&gt; up and cuddle them. The cats &amp; the girls all love it. However I do
&gt; keep a weather eye open to make sure they don't fall too much in love
&gt; with a cat and try to take it home.

&gt; I have one neighbour who thinks I have trained my cats to cr*p in his
&gt; garden (egocentric). My secret is that I'm planning on training the
&gt; slugs to eat his plants not mine!

a person is posting from you ignore the email address and instead look at
the properties in the header which actually give you the address from where
it was posted (if not faked). If you bother to look at mine, it gives away
not only my country, but the area of the country in which I reside. You can

What makes you say it's a cats nature to be outside? Humans used to
live outside too, but now we've adapted to living indoors. Sure we go
out sometimes, but we know the risks involved in going out and are
prepared to take it. Cats often don't know how to avoid the risks
that they come across in the outside world and so we should protect
them. Sure, take your cat outside on a lead or make a run for them so
that they can enjoy the sunshine - I have no problem with that. But
purposely putting them in danger when it's not necessary is just
foolhardy.

Actually, your isp is .com or .com.au

They've done that to stop some enterprising sod from registering the name,
your ISP aspires to be a multinational.

At work we have a .com / .com.au / .co.nz etc to ensure that no one else
grabs the name....

Anyone ever made a typo on major websites and seen what happens?

Sounds much more like someone who once met someone from that country

I mean, I've visited Australia and I certainly wouldn't say &quot;I once met

Ok, my own email address (the real one that is) had a Dot COM
extension, but then I would not run down someone who thought I

an easy mistake that 'I' will have led them to make.

some dogs that are let wander (against UK law) and probably urban foxes

you seem to have been using a newsserver called rdc1.on.home.ca. As a

enough to take responsibility for it. Without totally resorting to cliches,
I do believe that we should all work toward changing the things we can (i.e.
undoing and reparing past mistakes made by those like Bob), and accepting
that which we cannot change. We cannot change Bob. We can however try to
change the attitudes toward the environment in which we live of those who
are more open minded and intelligent. At the same time, we can all find
ways to contribute both our voices, our votes, and our resources to
repairing things that are due to human irresponsibility in our past.

Interesting about the highway. We had a similar case here in Canada where
the 101 was re-routed during initial construction because a university
biology graduate student discovered a rare fern hybrid that had been missed
during the original environmental assessment for that area. Now the area is
under *total* protection. All because of a rare little fern ;-)

&gt; You keep saying this, but you never say *why*. There are lots of

&gt; No risk from cars
&gt; No risk from nasty neighbours
&gt; Cat won't hurt native animals
&gt; Cat won't upset neighbours (even the nice ones)
&gt; Cat won't run away
&gt; Cat won't get stolen (yes this is a problem for purebreds)
&gt; Little risk from disease (if the cat can't come into contact with it
&gt; it can't get it)

"/> I think it was agreed long before the advent of the internet and WWW.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually does anybody know *why* the uk has gone against what everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;else has done and used two letter codes (.co.uk .ed.uk etc) rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;than three letters? Just because they could, or was there another
&gt;&gt;&gt;reason?

&gt;&gt;Oh we are not the only ones, but because of our size it is more
&gt;&gt;noticeable on the web.

&gt;I noticed you weren't the only ones, I guess it's just having different
&gt;countries organise themselves differently, they will do just that :)

"/> Very true.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually you can only get a .com.au domain if it is your business
&gt;&gt;&gt;name, eg telstra.com.au I couldn't, for example get quentin.com.au
&gt;&gt;&gt;unless I registered a business here in aus called Quentin :) which is
&gt;&gt;&gt;kind of impractical for most people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If I was going to try and get a domain (for whatever purpose) I'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;probably try and get .com address rather than a .com.au because, for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;start it *is* cheaper, and has less restrictions, and it's easier for
&gt;&gt;&gt;people to type/remember...

&gt;&gt;In the UK a .co domain is half the price of a .com.

&gt;That differs in various places, here in Australia, for example, it is cheaper
&gt;(by at least half) to get a US registered .com address than to register a
&gt;.com.au address - and you don't have to spend the $100AUD (or thereabouts) to
&gt;register it as a business.

"/> In the UK a .co.uk will cost about £10 for two years. A .com is about
twice as much depending on who you register though.

There is a .ltd and a .plc which is reserved for private limited and
public limited companies. We also have the .org.uk of course, and .gov
for government bodies.

There is talk of more but they are a long time coming.

There is also .uk.com and .gb.com (and their .net and .org variations)
of which were registered by a very enterprising company
( www.nomination.com ) who now sell sub domains at great profit.

&gt;&gt; If the f.cking poms hadn't emigrated (or been sent) to Oz most f.cking
&gt;&gt; Ozzies wouldn't exist, since most f.cking Ozzies are descended (wholly
&gt;&gt; or partly) from f.cking poms. Now can we stop using the F word please?

&gt;Hmm... lets look at the errors in this statement...

&gt;1. Most Aussies ARE NOT decendants of the poms (there are other places in
&gt;the world ....)

"/> The last figures I say showed over 75% of Aussies were of British

this year). The fog burns off very quickly to a cold but beautifully blue
day without a hint of smog or grunge in the air. The springs are superb,
the weather drifts as low as 5 in the mornings and up to 20 in the day ...
the sun shines and even when it rains it's quite pleasant. In the summer
here it is very hot, moving from 13 to 40 and back in one day, the
perfection of that is that it cools down in the evening making an evening
BBQ quite a pleasant thing, sitting outside in the evening with the kids

over the past few days. They're all available on the net. Let's start

GOLD GIVES REDGRAVE FITTING FINAL FAREWELL

STEVEN Redgrave - history's greatest oarsman - has added an extra, and
probably final, chapter to his phenomenal rowing resume with a fifth
consecutive Olympic gold medal as part of Great Britain's coxless four
victory.... Australia trailed Great Britain from the start........

TOMKINS UPSTAGED BY LEGEND
By RON REED

Australia’s most decorated rower has been upstaged by the best one the
world has ever seen..... Redgrave, 38, completed the near-miraculous
feat of winning gold at five successive Olympics when he helped Great
Britain's coxless four to an emphatic win. Tomkins knows now that any
hope he had of emulating Redgrave's astonishing record disappeared twice
over yesterday.

GOLDEN RECORD FOR REDGRAVE
23sep00

Great Britain's Steven Redgrave won his fifth Olympic gold medal when
his men's coxless four crew triumphed at the regatta centre at Penrith
today. The 38-year-old Briton won his first gold in the coxless
four at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 before switching to the coxless
pair, where he claimed a further three at successive Games, the last two
with a crewmate in the current four Matthew Pinsent.

AUSTRALIA WINS THREE MEDALS BUT NO GOLD

AUSTRALIA finished the first day of Olympic rowing finals with three
medals, but gold proved elusive. The men's coxless four of Geoff and
James Stewart, Bo Hansen and Ben Dodwell attempted to thwart British
legend Steve Redgrave's attempt to win his fifth successive gold medal.

However, the Australians could only manage bronze behind the Redgrave
Four and the fast-finishing Italians.

Four-time gold medallist Steve Redgrave and his British crew gave the
ambitious Australian coxless four a reality check on the water and a
backhander off it when they imposed their big-occasion quality on the
opening day of competition at Penrith Lakes today.

The Australian team said &quot;Redgrave is the sort of competitor the team
wants to be measured against&quot;.

Four-time gold medal-winning legend Steve Redgrave and the British
coxless four defeated the new Australian crew on the opening day of
competition at Penrith Lakes this morning.

Looking to continue the golden legacy of the Oarsome Foursome they
replaced, the Australian crew of Geoff and James Stewart, Ben Dodwell
and Bo Hanson finished more than one and a half boat lengths behind
the Britons.

The US networks and newspapers reported it pretty extensively too:

REDGRAVE EXTENDS LEGACY WITH FIFTH GOLD
Latest: Friday September 22, 2000 10:29 PM

PENRITH, Australia (AP) --
British rower Steven Redgrave was already among the all-time great
Olympic champions. Now he stands at a level shared by only two others.

Redgrave led the Brits to victory Saturday (Friday night EDT) in the
men's coxless fours. It marked his fifth straight Olympics with a gold
medal, something done just twice before and never in a sport as grueling
as pulling a boat 2,000 meters.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I found it on the  www.olympics.com  site ..

"/> You know, this attempt to dismiss what Redgrave did as unimportant
anywhere but at home sounds remarkably like sour grapes, particularly
when a simple search reveals just how much coverage Redgrave got in
Australia.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; guess that's what happens when you win gold in the
&gt; same breath as Grant Hackett, a race that stopped a nation.....

"/> No doubting that was a great race, but there's room for more than one
hero and most Australians other than yourself have happily acknowledged
that it happens that this time *we* have the superhero in the eyes of
most of the sportsmen and spectators of the world.

If it wasn't for the fact that I've seen and heard a lot of your media
coverage of Redgrave's bid for his fifth, you'd be making us all believe
that your country is totally insular and horribly jingoistic.
Thankfully not all Australians are as blinkered as you appear to be.
Certainly the ones who've left messages of congratulations on all the
message boards today have a good sense of sportsmanship, and of what the
Olympics is really about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I do respect his victories, he certainly is one in a
&gt; billion (a winning pom :-)

"/> The President of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio
Samaranch, described Steve Redgrave as &quot;possibly the greatest Olympian
of all time&quot;, so I guess you could say he's a winner.

How much nicer it would have been if you'd been a big enough person to
acknowledge Redgrave's achievements honestly, instead of pursuing this
compulsion to denigrate anything British with these tired one-liners.
You add emoticons but they're obviously completely insincere. That kind
of racist sniping really should be behind us in this day and age.

deadly and bites around 500 people in the Sydney area every year. And
don't forget the white-tailed spider. The saltwater crocodile grows up
to 7 metres and will attack and kill humans unfortunate enough to be in
their water. They'll do for starters I think.... but then you knew
that already, didn't you? Don't make the mistake of believing that
others don't.

complete rubbish and since you're now giving every reason under the sun
why you hadn't seen the paper or tv, it was dishonest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Because you're racist. Virtually every post you've written has
contained racist remarks. You judge people almost entirely on their
nationality and you appear to be incapable of writing anything that
doesn't denigrate people on the grounds of that nationality. The words
you choose to describe people's nationality are those which are
generally considered to be insulting, and you've made no secret of the
fact that you particularly hate the British.

And how can you best demonstrate that? By denying that Australia has
even noticed Steve Redgrave. Because he's British. And he's the best.
And he, Matthew, Tim and James left your crew standing. And that just
kills you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Credit where it is due, he has won one of your _3_ gold

with such obvious disdain. You're a congenital point scorer. To you,
taking part is worth nothing. The ideal of the Olympics completely

achievements didn't make the news in Australia when he made every

&gt;Hmm... lets look at the errors in this statement...

&gt;1. Most Aussies ARE NOT decendants of the poms (there are other places in
&gt;the world ....)

"/> Depends probably on when they arrived. However there's no getting away
from the fact that the white Aussies (I have noted your third point) are
all descended from immigrants and a great many of those immigrants (it's
not so long since there was the £10 assisted trips to Australia from the
UK) are from the UK &amp; Ireland.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;2. There were people here BEFORE the poms arrived ...

"/> I am aware of that. However they now form a small percentage of the
population partly because of the racism practised against them since
whites arrived in Australia. Many Aboriginals would probably say it
still goes on. And for some reason I don't think you are an Aboriginal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;3. It's spelt AUSSIE .. Ozzie is an Ostrich

&gt;and it could be considered a term of endearment :-)-

"/> It's whatever you want it to be.

As it happens I agree with you that cats are a great danger to what's
left of the native wildlife in Australia. Not to mention dingoes, rats,
mice, rabbits and sheep which all damage the environment. So lets get
rid of all the nasty foreign species and make Australia a land fit for
marsupials. And maybe we should get rid of the whites as well and let
the Aboriginals have their land back.

&gt;&gt; I guess that depends on your definition of &quot;paradise&quot;. As someone who
&gt;&gt; burns to a crisp if I so much as look at the sun, your idea of paradise
&gt;&gt; would be my definition of hell.

&gt;I utilise something that we Aussies call &quot;sunscreen&quot; (factor 30+)

&gt;Then we have the &quot;slip, slop, slap&quot; slogan ... (slip on a hat, slop on
&gt;suncreen, and slap on a hat). In Canberra we get the whole range of
&gt;weather. What we don't get is that dank, wet, miserable british weather.

&gt;We get the -9 frosty/foggy mornings in winter... a splattering of snow (9cm
&gt;this year). The fog burns off very quickly to a cold but beautifully blue
&gt;day without a hint of smog or grunge in the air. The springs are superb,
&gt;the weather drifts as low as 5 in the mornings and up to 20 in the day ...
&gt;the sun shines and even when it rains it's quite pleasant. In the summer
&gt;here it is very hot, moving from 13 to 40 and back in one day, the
&gt;perfection of that is that it cools down in the evening making an evening
&gt;BBQ quite a pleasant thing, sitting outside in the evening with the kids
&gt;jumping about in the pool :-)

&gt; In article &lt;39cc7 ... @iridium.webone.com.au&gt;, Bron &lt;m ... @where.am.i&gt; writes

&gt; Depends probably on when they arrived. However there's no getting away
&gt; from the fact that the white Aussies (I have noted your third point) are
&gt; all descended from immigrants and a great many of those immigrants (it's
&gt; not so long since there was the £10 assisted trips to Australia from the
&gt; UK) are from the UK &amp; Ireland.

"/> People from Scotland and Ireland are not from Britain and therefore aren't
to be counted. But by the theory of ancestry the question really is, which
do you &quot;claim&quot;. When your ancestry is mixed, do you claim all or just one
country? And how far back do you go? After all, most British are from
somewhere else originally anyway. Me, I consider myself to be wholey
Australian. I was born &amp; bred here, I have lived here all my life and only
leave the country when work requires or periodically I get dragged around to
some airshow or other :-( As for &quot;white&quot; Aussies, ever seen one of those?
*grin* .. i'm not sure of the demographics but many of our immigrants post
war have been from countries other than England. There have been an influx
of British I know, because we all remember the &quot;A Current Affair (TV Show)&quot;
articles of the classing whinging pom going home because Australia &quot;sux like
a hoover&quot; :-) .....

I guess i'd have to have a look at the stats, but with regards to my
workplace &amp; the area where I live, the mix is most definitely not majority
caucasion (which I assume you mean by &quot;white&quot;).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;2. There were people here BEFORE the poms arrived ...

&gt; I am aware of that. However they now form a small percentage of the
&gt; population partly because of the racism practised against them since
&gt; whites arrived in Australia. Many Aboriginals would probably say it
&gt; still goes on. And for some reason I don't think you are an Aboriginal.

"/> Lets address this. 2% of our population is Aboriginal, and yes they have
suffered greatly since the British arrived in Australia. The whole of the
Tasmanian aboriginal population was wiped out by the British Colonists in
the 1700/1800's until there were none left. From what I know of history,
Britain is the only country that can claim complete genocide of a race of
people

The majority of Aborigines do not claim racist goes on. Charles Perkins and
his pack of publicity hunters do moan long &amp; loud about the problem and
there certainly are problems as there are in the United States with the
negro population and Britain has a racial problem also. Our redeeming
quality is that we are working towards reconcilliation, but it is difficult
when the goalposts continue to be moved by splinter groups with their own
agendas. Much of the history against the aboriginals was by the British and
then continued on by the Australian Government under the control/guidance of
the British.

We could get into a discussion about the &quot;furfies&quot; about racism in
Australia, there are times and places for that (drop it into eMail ...
b ... @webone.com.au). All I will say is that Australia's history of racism
isn't as bad as some, and is worse than others... we, like Britain and the
USA suffer from ignorance and a blind arrogance in believing that Britain is
the &quot;mother country&quot; and that the Queen is god, and that all other beings
are &quot;lesser&quot;. This is changing but with all things, it is quite slow.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As it happens I agree with you that cats are a great danger to what's
&gt; left of the native wildlife in Australia. Not to mention dingoes, rats,
&gt; mice, rabbits and sheep which all damage the environment.

"/> They have built a whopping great dingo fence to keep them out of some
places, unfortunately the cats can jump that fence. Dingoes are also useful
for keeping the human population down :-). Discount sheep also because they
don't run wild.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So lets get
&gt; rid of all the nasty foreign species and make Australia a land fit for
&gt; marsupials. And maybe we should get rid of the whites as well and let
&gt; the Aboriginals have their land back.

"/> Oh sarcasm is the lowest form of wit. Some would say that the aborigines
have much of their land back, and much of it was not taken from them in the
first place, just goes to show the ignorance of some doesn't it. Your idea
is good but not workable as it would displace many people with no &quot;home&quot; to
go back to.... however, lets lay blame where it belongs, at the feet of the
British who &quot;invaded&quot; this land and slaughtered it's inhabitants.

Then lets get to the issue of the land they can't have back. Maralinga ..
remember that one or do I need to remind you of the atomic bombs that the
BRITISH dropped, thus making a huge amount of aboriginal land uninhabitable
(but didn't bother to tell the aborigines that).

down or molested happy in the knowledge that medical treatment if required
is free and that the best hospital for kids in the southern hemisphere is a
mere (free) helicopter ride away (god forbid that I would ever need it). At

get the Aussie summer (45 deg) and the brilliant winters (-9 deg) .. I've

go rollerblading and iceskating ... After school they play to their hearts

&gt;&gt; Depends probably on when they arrived. However there's no getting away
&gt;&gt; from the fact that the white Aussies (I have noted your third point) are
&gt;&gt; all descended from immigrants and a great many of those immigrants (it's
&gt;&gt; not so long since there was the £10 assisted trips to Australia from the
&gt;&gt; UK) are from the UK &amp; Ireland.

&gt;People from Scotland and Ireland are not from Britain and therefore aren't
&gt;to be counted.

"/>&lt;snip&gt;

Scotland is most definitely part of Britain, as is Wales.

The UK includes Ulster (North Ireland), but before 1922 (?) included the
whole of Ireland.

PS it looked remarkably like really heavy rain in the Olympic Stadium in
Sydney last night. I though that sort of thing was banned in Australia.

&gt;&gt; Yep, a lot do come back. The thought they were going to a country that

&gt;&gt; and then they did not want to be part of that future. In short, they
&gt;&gt; had brains.

&gt;All a matter of opinion, we are glad they are gone. Perhaps they're like
&gt;you and live by their own set of &quot;rules&quot; which means that they do not

purred the following:

:)How come the cat is so much more destructive in your part of the world
:)than elsewhere?

It's not that cats are any *more* destructive - I'm sure your cats
catch just as many native birds and animals as an Australian one. But
because cats have only been introduced here in the last 200 odd years,
our environment has yet to be able to absorb the impact. Species
(like the desert rat, the bilby) that had few if any predators now has
cats (among other things) that prey on it. Much as I hate to admit
it, owned cats (this is not ferals, but a study on owned cats only)
bring home an average of 3 - 4 wild animals per week. That's not
including other introduced species like rabbits but only native birds,
marsupials, lizards etc.

Very sad situation and something every Australian cat owner needs to
be aware of.

Yes it was rain, beautiful heavy Sydney rain that comes along, greens the
grass and buggers off. Apparently they use that water to wash down the
stadium walls at the Olympic park. Pity if fell during the athletics
though .. But still, many events went of really well before the big fall. I
think it has another 2 days to fall and then it buggers off again :-)

Please answer this question. The cat has been native to europe for
centuries. Why has it not done the damage in europe you claim is done in
australia ? This is a serious question. IF you can answer this, you may find
an answer to the problem you claim you face.

BTW : wild cats (i.e outdoors) don't scratch car paintwork. If you want
compensation have a word with the cats owners, instead of killing them, or
maybe you lack the b@lls to do this ? Perhaps you'd like to face some of the
larger wild cats ? I'm sure they will show you the contempt you show cats
that are not your pets....

For the record, our friends are master of everything. You WILL be hopelessly
outwitted, both in terms of your jaundiced viewpoint, and your severe
underestimation of the cat.

Sorry to say this Bron. You are full of sh1t. Instead of whinging on here,
do something, or shut up.

"/> Actually you have answered your own question in a way. The damage they do
was done much earlier on. The species are already extinct and those that
are not have no need to fear the cats. It's a time factor. Our country has
only had cats for 200 years (since the british brought them over here). The
time factor is the issue. Additionally it would seem that the poms are not

&gt;&gt; As it happens I agree with you that cats are a great danger to what's
&gt;&gt; left of the native wildlife in Australia. Not to mention dingoes, rats,
&gt;&gt; mice, rabbits and sheep which all damage the environment.

&gt;They have built a whopping great dingo fence to keep them out of some
&gt;places, unfortunately the cats can jump that fence. Dingoes are also useful
&gt;for keeping the human population down :-). Discount sheep also because they
&gt;don't run wild.

&gt;&gt; So lets get
&gt;&gt; rid of all the nasty foreign species and make Australia a land fit for
&gt;&gt; marsupials. And maybe we should get rid of the whites as well and let
&gt;&gt; the Aboriginals have their land back.

&gt;Oh sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.

"/> I'm not being sarcastic in suggesting that all introduced mammals should
be removed from Australia. And I forgot to include cattle, goats &amp;
squirrels on the above list. The phrase 'a land fit for marsupials'
could be taken as sarcasm by the thin-skinned.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Some would say that the aborigines
&gt;have much of their land back, and much of it was not taken from them in the
&gt;first place, just goes to show the ignorance of some doesn't it. Your idea
&gt;is good but not workable as it would displace many people with no &quot;home&quot; to
&gt;go back to.... however, lets lay blame where it belongs, at the feet of the
&gt;British who &quot;invaded&quot; this land and slaughtered it's inhabitants.

&gt;Then lets get to the issue of the land they can't have back. Maralinga ..
&gt;remember that one or do I need to remind you of the atomic bombs that the
&gt;BRITISH dropped, thus making a huge amount of aboriginal land uninhabitable
&gt;(but didn't bother to tell the aborigines that).

"/> Maralinga is not most of Australia. What parts have the aboriginals
regained their land rights over? The parts whites don't want to live in
perchance?

I'm beginning to think that if you are truly representative of the
Australian psyche that it's really well balanced - it's got two socking
great chips, one on each shoulder.

&gt;&gt;I'll take that as an inability to answer the question as you've now said
&gt;&gt;that twice.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So there is not much wildlife about in your area. Next I suppose you
&gt;&gt;&gt; will claim it has all been wiped out by cats.

&gt;&gt;Much of it has.

&gt; How come the cat is so much more destructive in your part of the world
&gt; than elsewhere?

&gt;&gt;&gt; They are all wildlife, just like a cat.

&gt;&gt;I'll take that as your inability to comprehend basic facts.

&gt; Your mind is very small isn't it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well I, as a thinking person, did.

&gt;&gt;You think like a child, my 7 year old has a wider thought process than
you
&gt;&gt;do and can differentiate facts a lot better than you can.

&gt; Oh, well having inherited some of your genes I somehow doubt that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I posted my answer.

&gt;&gt;Rubbish, you posted a childish, factless response.

&gt; I posted my answer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Very funny, the child like thought processes seem to come from your
&gt;&gt;&gt; direction.

&gt;&gt;:-) can't even think of a good comeback can you?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am a person with over 40 years experience with cats

&gt;&gt;Dear god, and yet you still cannot put any more thought into issues than
a
&gt;&gt;small child!

&gt; Well I lest I put a lot more than you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;(an a lot of
&gt;&gt;&gt; other animals as well). I have a scientific background, by that I mean
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was taught to thing about things a put things in context.

&gt;&gt;In other words you are not qualified to make the statements that you
have,
&gt;&gt;you are merely posting OPINION.

&gt; No, that is not what I said.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe that to have any animal simply so that you can bend it to
&gt;&gt;&gt; your rules is wrong. And yes, the same can apply to children.

&gt;&gt;Yes, an opinion. Are you unlawful? Because if you abide by the law then
&gt;&gt;you are &quot;bending to a set of rules&quot; thus making your statement utter crap
&gt;&gt;(as usual in your posts).

&gt; Laws are made for man and by man. There is a concept in law that
&gt; ignorance of a law is not defense - but ignorance itself is.

&gt; As a cat is by its nature its own master, and as it can neither read
&gt; nor talk, it cannot be bound by the laws of man.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But a cat, deprived of something that makes it a cat, is no longer
&gt;&gt;&gt; really a cat.

&gt;&gt;But we now know that you are not qualified to make that judgement.

&gt; It is not my judgement. It is a statement of fact. Try reading a
&gt; little bit about animals.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Looking at the headers the cross posting is mostly to cat groups. As
&gt;&gt;&gt; we are talking about cats it is easy to assume the other person is on
&gt;&gt;&gt; a cat group. It matters little.

&gt;&gt;Agreed, but you brought it up .. I was just qualifying the facts for you.
&gt;&gt;Regardless of how many &quot;cat groups&quot; are in the header, I am still in a
pet
&gt;&gt;group and I didn't cross post the thread.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep, a lot do come back. The thought they were going to a country that
&gt;&gt;&gt; had a future. Then they found out what so many of its people were like
&gt;&gt;&gt; and then they did not want to be part of that future. In short, they
&gt;&gt;&gt; had brains.

&gt;&gt;All a matter of opinion, we are glad they are gone. Perhaps they're like
&gt;&gt;you and live by their own set of &quot;rules&quot; which means that they do not
&gt;&gt;conform to the community standards. The ones I've seen expected to be
&gt;&gt;treated like the &quot;gods&quot; they believed themselves to be and were terribly
&gt;&gt;upset when they found out that we no longer consider the British to be
&gt;&gt;&quot;gods&quot;, they are ordinary people just like us and are expected to act
that
&gt;&gt;way. Narrowminded, opinionated, self centered ... hmmm... sounds just
like
&gt;&gt;you!!

&gt;&gt;Australia is one of the most pleasant places in the world to be. All the
&gt;&gt;advantages and few of the disadvantages.

&gt; One very large disadvantage, it has people like you living there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't think

&gt;&gt;Yes, we've noticed that

&gt;&gt;&gt;of a single medical breakthrough you have had that has
&gt;&gt;&gt; not been based on British or American research. Better athletes, well
&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose you got some training chasing the sheep :)

&gt;&gt;There are lots, the breakthroughs with IVF,

&gt; First done in the UK.

&gt;&gt;the treatment of HIV/AIDS... to

&gt; Well it does seem to be more of a problem in your country. But still
&gt; the leading research is UK/USA led.

&gt;&gt;many and numerous to go into. As for sheep, I wouldn't know I've never
been
&gt;&gt;close to one except when it's rotating over a hot flame :-) *hmmmm
yummy*
&gt;&gt;... And 2nd in the world for percapita olympic victories :-) Much
higher
&gt;&gt;than I would have thought. 2nd to your 38th. And that's before we get
&gt;&gt;into cricket .... :-)

&gt; Could be that most people in the UK have better things to do with they
&gt; time than playing sport.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As for the Military, when was the last time an overseas government
&gt;&gt;&gt; called on you crack military?

&gt;&gt;It will NEVER happen again, we learnt our lesson when we allowed the
British
&gt;&gt;to use our men as cannon fodder whilst they cowardly stood back and
watched.

&gt; Your view of history is a disgraceful indictment of the Australian
&gt; school system.

&gt;&gt;Britain will find that the Australian (and New Zealand) Armies are no
longer
&gt;&gt;at their beck and call and that next time they have a problem they'll
need
&gt;&gt;to send their own troops.

&gt; We usually do, we play our part in keeping the world a free place for
&gt; you to have beach parties in.

&gt;&gt; (and whilst we're at it .. what DID happen to the
&gt;&gt;harriers in the Gulf ... seemed to me they simply fell out of the
sky....)

&gt; If I remember we lost how many was it? Oh yes, ONE, due to engine
&gt; failure. For hours spent in combat missions that put our air force in
&gt; an enviable position.

&gt; But then you see, we often went to our friends in the gulf to fly
&gt; joint exercises so we knew what to expect.

&gt;&gt;Have you hear of East Timor? Somalia? Kuwait? Our soldiers do their
jobs
&gt;&gt;brilliantly, even with the abyssmal record of foreign leadership (oh,
that'd
&gt;&gt;be YOU again :-)

&gt; East Timor? Somalia? Yes I seem to remember seeing Australian troops
&gt; land when it was safe to do so.

&gt; And how many did you sent to the Gulf? Wow, that big force really made
&gt; the news :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; And Diana and he friend died in a car accident.

&gt;&gt;Popular, non British opinion, is that there is more to that car accident
&gt;&gt;than will ever be released to the public.

&gt; Of course there was, nobody could possible believe that the driver was
&gt; that drunk. Must have been one of the Ozzie photographer tipping booze
&gt; down the driver while his mate took the sick pics.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I seem to remember
&gt;&gt;&gt; that at least two of the chasing photographers, almost certainly the
&gt;&gt;&gt; real cause of the accident, were Australian.

&gt;&gt;Actually, you'd be wrong. French officials have ruled that the &quot;chasing
&gt;&gt;papparazzi&quot; were too far behind to be the cause of that accident.... :-)
&gt;&gt;But nice try.

&gt; And you believe that.....

&gt;It's not that cats are any *more* destructive - I'm sure your cats
&gt;catch just as many native birds and animals as an Australian one. But
&gt;because cats have only been introduced here in the last 200 odd years,
&gt;our environment has yet to be able to absorb the impact. Species
&gt;(like the desert rat, the bilby) that had few if any predators now has
&gt;cats (among other things) that prey on it. Much as I hate to admit
&gt;it, owned cats (this is not ferals, but a study on owned cats only)
&gt;bring home an average of 3 - 4 wild animals per week. That's not
&gt;including other introduced species like rabbits but only native birds,
&gt;marsupials, lizards etc.

"/> We had one cat that used to bring home the odd mouse or bird, but even
if she caught 10 times what she brought home it would only amount to
about 30 a year.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As it happens I agree with you that cats are a great danger to what's
&gt;&gt;&gt; left of the native wildlife in Australia. Not to mention dingoes, rats,
&gt;&gt;&gt; mice, rabbits and sheep which all damage the environment.

&gt;&gt;They have built a whopping great dingo fence to keep them out of some
&gt;&gt;places, unfortunately the cats can jump that fence. Dingoes are also useful
&gt;&gt;for keeping the human population down :-). Discount sheep also because they
&gt;&gt;don't run wild.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So lets get
&gt;&gt;&gt; rid of all the nasty foreign species and make Australia a land fit for
&gt;&gt;&gt; marsupials. And maybe we should get rid of the whites as well and let
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Aboriginals have their land back.

&gt;&gt;Oh sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.

&gt;I'm not being sarcastic in suggesting that all introduced mammals should
&gt;be removed from Australia. And I forgot to include cattle, goats &amp;
&gt;squirrels on the above list. The phrase 'a land fit for marsupials'
&gt;could be taken as sarcasm by the thin-skinned.

"/> Yep, you can't take away their sheep can you, they would have nothing
to do at night if you did :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Some would say that the aborigines
&gt;&gt;have much of their land back, and much of it was not taken from them in the
&gt;&gt;first place, just goes to show the ignorance of some doesn't it. Your idea
&gt;&gt;is good but not workable as it would displace many people with no &quot;home&quot; to
&gt;&gt;go back to.... however, lets lay blame where it belongs, at the feet of the
&gt;&gt;British who &quot;invaded&quot; this land and slaughtered it's inhabitants.

&gt;&gt;Then lets get to the issue of the land they can't have back. Maralinga ..
&gt;&gt;remember that one or do I need to remind you of the atomic bombs that the
&gt;&gt;BRITISH dropped, thus making a huge amount of aboriginal land uninhabitable
&gt;&gt;(but didn't bother to tell the aborigines that).

&gt;Maralinga is not most of Australia. What parts have the aboriginals
&gt;regained their land rights over? The parts whites don't want to live in
&gt;perchance?

Actually every one of the laws Bron mentinoed is being considered by
every local council and animal welfare organisation in Australia. The
RSPCA and Canberra council have already introduced compulsory desexing
- and it's apparently working well. Registration is required in
Brisbane where I live - the first step towards a Pet licence and
compulsory microchipping IMHO. Then there are the curfews that are
becoming more common every day. I myself have worked towards these
and other measures in my voluntary involvement with cat groups. And

&gt; many species of animal are now extinct because of man? Too many, it's
time
&gt; to put a halt to it by taking the matters that we can into our hand now
&gt; before it is too late. The cat issue isn't the only issue that Australia
is
&gt; facing, there are pollution issues and the whole &quot;ozone layer&quot; issue, we
are
&gt; a world leader in being responsible.

&gt;&gt; BTW : wild cats (i.e outdoors) don't scratch car paintwork.

&gt; Sure they do. I saw it happen, couldn't do much about it until AFTER it
had
&gt; occurred.

"/> What was it ? One of your neighbours cats that is pissed off with you for
kicking it ? All cats would be wild with you for doing that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; If you want
&gt;&gt; compensation have a word with the cats owners, instead of killing them,

"/> For the sake of clarity : I meant the cats, not the owners here. I trust
this was your understanding.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Good point, except that there are too many people out there like Bob who
&gt; believe cats have more rights than humans. Better to acknowledge the
&gt; situation and remove the cause, that way it wont happen again. Might I

&gt; the bonnet slopes downwards and (b) allow me to catch it after damaging
the
&gt; bonnet of my car :-)

"/> Not stupid at all. Just sees cars for what they are - a means from A to B.

&gt; Yes, I could cause a neighbourhood dispute that leads to violence by

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;Perhaps you'd like to face some of the
&gt;&gt; larger wild cats ?

&gt; Actually I don't think I would. However the relevance to this

&gt; is beyond my grasp. Are you suggesting that we keep larger cats as pets
or
&gt; that we have larger cats natively wandering Australia?

"/> Wild cats are outdoor cats are they not ? This is your gripe isn't it ?
INSIDE vs OUTSIDE cats. Personally, I think a 'discussion' with a big nasty
wild cat might be good therapy for you. I'm sure you'd let it off for
scratching your car after it had explained it's point of view.......

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;I'm sure they will show you the contempt you show cats
&gt;&gt; that are not your pets....

&gt; A really stupid comment, go back and read the thread before you butt in.

"/> It seems to me reading this thread, that you're pissed off because a
neighbours cat scratched your car. Oh and maybe crapping in your garden too

environment, but I wonder just how much you really do - please see
discussion below for expansion of this point - points 1-7 at the end.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; For the record, our friends are master of everything. You WILL be
&gt; hopelessly
&gt;&gt; outwitted, both in terms of your jaundiced viewpoint, and your severe
&gt;&gt; underestimation of the cat.

&gt; Cats must be really smart, thats why they tend to lie, stationary on the
&gt; side of the road with their insides dripping out onto the street... yep,
&gt; smart smart smart. Mind you, the inside variety are cute to lookat.

"/> You just show yourself to be blatantly cruel by this statement. If I ever
see you lying in the road after being hit by a vehicle, bleeding slowly and
painfully to death, remind me to just drive on, after I've of course had a
good look - as you must have done to describe this. I still maintain my
point above. You will be hopelessly outwitted. There are way too many cats
for anything but a nuclear strike to make any difference to the final
outcome. Rumour has it you've been working on this solution (a nuke) for
quite some time now, employing remote detonation from 100ft. You know, I
think you really might make the New Darwin Awards (awards posthumously made
to those who remove themselves from the human gene pool by acts of
mindnumbing stupidity).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Sorry to say this Bron. You are full of sh1t. Instead of whinging on
here,
&gt;&gt; do something, or shut up.

&gt; Like what? Asking you to get your facts straight before posting shit? I
am
&gt; doing something... i'm working with my local government to ensure the
legal
&gt; requirement to keep cats inside at all times or they will be caught and
&gt; euthenased. I'm working for legislation to require them to be
microchipped
&gt; and a yearly fee be paid to keep them. I'm working for the compulsary
&gt; sterilisation of all cats kept outside registered breeding facilities.

"/> Several points here :-

1) BIG DEAL ! SO WHAT ? At least we know whats causing global warming now -
the plume of hot air rising from your house.
2) Legislation ? Are you so STUPID as to believe that this is practical to
implement ? Think again. Politicians will take the next 1000 years sitting
on the fence and angling for votes .... and nothing will happen.
3) Legislation again ? Against what ? Outside cats in general - no chance !
Or is it really legislation to stop your car getting scratched - which I
think is your real issue here.
4) As in 3), are you STUPID enough (yet again) to believe that domestic pets
are the main problem. THINK AGAIN. What about the masses of feral cats that
live around man, but we rarely see ? HOW will you control them ? Again - no
chance.
5) So from 4), you must choose another approach. Isolation of a reasonable
size section of land, that native wildlife have as a sanctuary might be
practical, but how much are you prepared to pay ? I don't know what the
answer is. I know legislation and politics isn't. It is neither aimed at the
right issues, nor will it be quick enough.
6) Sterilisation of all domestic cats ? Be real. Give me the genuine
'blended' domestic moggy anyday. No gripes against decent breeding
facilities, but this is my preference. Sterilisation will solve nothing. The
feral population cannot be sterilised in it's entirety, and will continue to
multiply to match the available food supply. True, if you can catch enough,
and sterilise them it will buy you some time, so your point is not
irrelevant. It's just not realistic.
7) Or put your car in the garage, so the cats can't scratch it, and none of
this will be an issue to you anymore.

but at $6.99 a kilo I don't eat that much of it, small amounts of meat per

:-)

Our land would be fit for marsupials without the cats, rabbits, foxes and
mice. In New Zealand their Kiwi and other native animals are at risk from
non native preditors as well, and to lose the Kiwi would be a great tragedy.

&quot;But life for kiwi was about to get much worse. The Europeans were on their
way&quot;
&quot;More and more Europeans arrived, bringing cats, dogs, stoats, weasels and
ferrets. The introduced animals wreaked havoc on kiwi&quot;

&gt; an accident you are at fault (ie, dont' swerve), it's already law in
places

&gt;&gt; I dispute this. We are concerned about our ecosystem. But get this :
this
&gt;&gt; PLANET is our ecosystem, as it is yours, and everyone elses. If time is
a
&gt;&gt; factor, then it doesn't say very much for Australia does it ? 200 years,
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; you've screwed up a perfectly good country, if the issues you say are a
&gt;&gt; problem are so relevant.

&gt; The problems we suffer now are minor compared to an old country such as
&gt; yours where you have had 1000's of years to stuff it up, we are learning
our
&gt; lessons quickly and trying to stop a repeat of your mistakes. However,
&gt; there are people here (as everywhere) who refuse to acknowlege the
problems
&gt; and who (like bob) believe that their right to their own selfish existance
&gt; outweighs the right of the greater good.

&gt; We are also fighting a losing battle with problems such as the introduced
&gt; vermin that runs unchecked through the vast unpopulated wilderness
wreaking
&gt; their havoc as they go. By the way, of those 200 years, britian remains
&gt; responsible for the worst 100.

"/> Britain is responsible for sending people to Australia full stop. Until then

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; What was it ? One of your neighbours cats that is pissed off with you

&gt; No .. hadn't touched it (until then). I've never kicked a cat by the way

"/> Hmmmmmmm OK. I believe you...................but not totally convinced

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ...

&gt;&gt; For the sake of clarity : I meant the cats, not the owners here. I trust
&gt;&gt; this was your understanding.

&gt; I am aware cats do not have human thought processes as such and that the
&gt; responsibility lies with the owners, but with irresponsible owners such as
&gt; Bob what is the answer? To give them their own way and let their cats
&gt; continue to roam or take action against the cats? Action against the
owners
&gt; isn't possible, much as i'd love to there are laws against that sort of
&gt; stuff :-)

&gt;&gt; Not stupid at all. Just sees cars for what they are - a means from A to
B.
&gt;&gt; Probably can't see why you're so mad either - it's just a bloody lump of
&gt;&gt; metal. It probably thought : 'shit respray job' too......

&gt; Na, I'm thinking it was thinking 'oooooh' as it extended it's claws to
stop
&gt; it's downward slide. I don't see my car in quite the same light .. given
&gt; the choice on a road between swerving around a cat and potentially
damaging
&gt; the &quot;lump of metal&quot; and rolling over the cat, I choose over the cat every
&gt; time. The &quot;lump of metal&quot; is mine, i've worked long and hard to get it ..
&gt; the cat is vermin ... easy choice really, and i'm obviously not the only
one
&gt; that thinks that way given the number of little furry &quot;road pizzas&quot; I pass
&gt; to and from work each day.

&gt;&gt; Perhaps a bit of rational discussion would solve the problem ? Doh !

&gt; Bwahahaaaaaaaa If they were capable of rational thought, their cat would
&gt; be indoors. By the way, just to clear it up. I did discuss it with them,
&gt; they told me to fuck off because their cat had every right to roam free,
&gt; it's the same shit I hear from Bob and as for fixing the bonnet, they
&gt; couldn't even comprehend why I was upset, after all &quot;cats will be cats&quot;
...
&gt; !!!

&gt;&gt; Wild cats are outdoor cats are they not ? This is your gripe isn't it ?

&gt; Erm .... they're also native .. seems you have touble following the thread
&gt; ... my problem is with introduced vermin, not native .. and we don't have
&gt; big cats in Australia.

"/> Errrrrm white australians are introduced vermin too, and I bet they're
responsible for far more damage to the ecosystem than your monumental
shortsightedness can let you see. What do you suggest ? Mass extermination
of them too ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; INSIDE vs OUTSIDE cats. Personally, I think a 'discussion' with a big
&gt; nasty
&gt;&gt; wild cat might be good therapy for you. I'm sure you'd let it off for

&gt; I'm sure I would given the circumstances, however it is quite irrelevant
to

the

I'm actually a cat person, but I wouldn't consider it out of line if
someone crawled into their garden one day and got catshit all over
their leg, and responded by hurling some shit at the cat owner's
house.

The damage to the car is a bit more major - Perhaps there are some
people who feel that cats should be allowed to damaged whatever takes
their fancy, regardless of its value (monetary OR sentimental - in the
case of an automobile it's usually both). I strongly disagree with
this viewpoint.

I also have a friend who owns no cats, and yet his front doorway has
an overpowering smell of cat urine when you walk up to it - is that
fair to him?

The Egyptian culture died millenia ago. It is no longer ok to hate
people just because they don't enslave themselves to a feline as we
do. We experience relaxation when we pet our cats in the morning.
Others experience relaxation when they look in their backyard and see
a pretty bird in their birdbath. When they come home from work and
find 2 dead bluejays floating in it (true story), they get a bit
upset, same way we do when some cretinous mullet gets his kicks by
torturing the neighbourhood cats.

The quarrel here is not with the people who just want to live a
cat-free life. The problem here is the people who refuse to take the
steps to be good neighbours, and help them acheive this.

It puts the cat through an ordeal, especially in winter here where it
easily hits -20C on a regular basis. It costs the owner money and
mental anguish. And it works - only people who don't care about their

I missed Andy's original post on this (don't know how) but I agree
with Thad. It is already legal in Australia to hire human traps and
trap any animal that comes into your garden at any time. Whether it's
law to keep them in or not. Not many people know of this law. There
are special restrictions to it - you must letterbox drop a certain
number of houses in the area advising the days and times you will be
setting the trap and once a cat is caught you must do the same
letterbox drop advising the colour and type of cat caught and that
you're taking it to the RSPCA (the only place you are allowed to take
it).

&gt;&gt; Wales is being given back to the Welsh, and Scotland to the Scottish.
&gt;&gt; Wales has it's own Assembly now (a small but significant step - remember
&gt;&gt; the quote 'every journey starts with a single step') and Scotland has
&gt;&gt; it's own Parliament with some control over revenue.

&gt;Well that is good news, I wonder if they'll then move to a republic? :-)
&gt;The Republic of Wales .. has a nice ring to it ....

&gt;&gt; NI is a problem as there are a lot of extremists there devoted to

&gt;&gt; We had one cat that used to bring home the odd mouse or bird, but even
&gt;&gt; if she caught 10 times what she brought home it would only amount to
&gt;&gt; about 30 a year.

&gt;30 x 3 million cats = 90 million a year

&gt;How many cats in britain?

"/> And how many mice and other small rodents? The real problem facing
native wildlife in many countries (not just Australia, not just the UK)
is loss of habitat and the introduction of non-native grazers to
Australia such as sheep and rabbits has had far more impact on the

urban areas are becoming crucial habitats for many species.

This just shows the difference between Australia and the UK. A recent
survey here showed that the average Aussie back yard contained 1500
different species (both plant and animal). In my backyard I've seen
at least 10 different types of birds and too many different kinds of
lizards to mention let alone any nocturnal animal that I don't even
get to see. Just yesterday when I went to get the mail I saw a tiny
little Bearded Lizard (Frilly Lizard) - it was only about 8 cm long
(that's 3' in the old money). My first thought was &quot;if my kitties
were out here, he'd be a gonner&quot;.

Can't you understand how important it is for Australians to try to
keep the balance of this delicate ecosystem?

&gt; I'm actually a cat person, but I wouldn't consider it out of line if

&gt; The damage to the car is a bit more major - Perhaps there are some
&gt; people who feel that cats should be allowed to damaged whatever takes
&gt; their fancy, regardless of its value (monetary OR sentimental - in the
&gt; case of an automobile it's usually both). I strongly disagree with
&gt; this viewpoint.

"/> Cars are just lumps of metal, glass, rubber and plastic for getting from A
to B. If you don't want it damaged, don't drive it ! What about stonechips ?
Do you have AAA to shoot down any birds that come near too ? I've had a car
nigh on written off by a drunk driver. I was snug in bed. My car was parked
in the street overnight. Guess who ended up paying because the police
couldn't catch the guy who did it due to overstrained resources ? It's just
a lump of metal, so who really cares ? I don't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I also have a friend who owns no cats, and yet his front doorway has
&gt; an overpowering smell of cat urine when you walk up to it - is that

&gt; The Egyptian culture died millenia ago. It is no longer ok to hate
&gt; people just because they don't enslave themselves to a feline as we
&gt; do. We experience relaxation when we pet our cats in the morning.
&gt; Others experience relaxation when they look in their backyard and see
&gt; a pretty bird in their birdbath. When they come home from work and
&gt; find 2 dead bluejays floating in it (true story), they get a bit
&gt; upset, same way we do when some cretinous mullet gets his kicks by
&gt; torturing the neighbourhood cats.

"/> I don't hate people who have different views. They are entitled to them.
However, I am a realist. When I feel people are not realistic, I tell them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The quarrel here is not with the people who just want to live a
&gt; cat-free life. The problem here is the people who refuse to take the
&gt; steps to be good neighbours, and help them acheive this.

"/> Bron has 2 cats, or have you missed that ? The other issue is this : to be a
good neighbour, you have to be tolerant to a degree at least of your
neighbours needs too. What about kids playing in the street ? What about
people having parties, dogs barking, etc ? I agree with you on the subject
of good neighbours - I am very lucky where I live. I hope it stays that way.

As a point of reference, way back in the 17th century over here, we had a
massive plague, just before the great fire of London. The cats were actually
helping to keep the rats at bay, as is there predatory role, but they were
our allies. The rats and their fleas were spreading the plague, not the
cats. And who did we end up persecuting, and why ? The cats, through
ignorance and fear. So I ask people to just for once be absolutely certain
of the facts before they embark on programs of eradication. We scarcely know
anything about this planet. We know how to wipe ourselves out as a race,
indeed we hold the inventory of weapons necessary to do this. Science keeps
meddling with genetics, as we've meddled with so much of nature in the past.
Already there are whispers in the wind of GM crop trials in this country
leading to cross contamination. So are we THAT sure the cat IS the problem ?
I doubt it. I for one think that WE are the problem.

&gt;&gt;3) Legislation again ? Against what ? Outside cats in general - no chance
!

&gt; Not true. Here in Winnipeg, anyone who is annoyed by an outside cat
&gt; for any reason can rent a &quot;humane&quot; trap from the city and catch the
&gt; feline. They then return the cat to the pound, where the owner must
&gt; come and pay to get the cat back, just like an impound lot.

&gt; It puts the cat through an ordeal, especially in winter here where it
&gt; easily hits -20C on a regular basis. It costs the owner money and
&gt; mental anguish. And it works - only people who don't care about their
&gt; cats neglect to either put their cats on a leash outside or just keep
&gt; them inside. I hate this law and the people who rent the traps, in
&gt; winter especially, but sadly, humans have rights too.

&gt;&gt;Or is it really legislation to stop your car getting scratched - which I
&gt;&gt;think is your real issue here.

&gt; And how exactly is this not a legitimate issue? Presumably, he works
&gt; his arse off at his job to pay for that car. Maybe it's a collector
&gt; car that he restored himself. Either way, that car is as important to
&gt; him as our cats are to us, and he is legally entitled to take steps to
&gt; prevent damage to it.

&gt;&gt;4) As in 3), are you STUPID enough (yet again) to believe that domestic
pets
&gt;&gt;are the main problem. THINK AGAIN. What about the masses of feral cats
that
&gt;&gt;live around man, but we rarely see ? HOW will you control them ? Again -
no
&gt;&gt;chance.

&gt; Are feral cats somehow smarter than domestic cats? No chance they'll
&gt; stop all of them, perhaps, but they're just as likely to go for the
&gt; meat in a trap as domestics. And if people start controlling the
&gt; travels of their domestic cats, then only the ferals will be trapped.

&gt;&gt;6) Sterilisation of all domestic cats ? Be real. Give me the genuine
&gt;&gt;'blended' domestic moggy anyday. No gripes against decent breeding
&gt;&gt;facilities, but this is my preference. Sterilisation will solve nothing.
The
&gt;&gt;feral population cannot be sterilised in it's entirety, and will continue
to
&gt;&gt;multiply to match the available food supply. True, if you can catch
enough,
&gt;&gt;and sterilise them it will buy you some time, so your point is not
&gt;&gt;irrelevant. It's just not realistic.

&gt; Be careful there. If you convince them that sterilization won't work,
&gt; it won't win them over to your side, it will push them further.

&gt;&gt;7) Or put your car in the garage, so the cats can't scratch it, and none
of
&gt;&gt;this will be an issue to you anymore.

&gt; Ahh yes, he should adapt to the habits of others. Of course.

"/> I ask you this : In a country with a sparse population density such as
Australia, and the destruction (supposedly due to cats) to wildlife being so
rife, what percentage of it is down to domestic pets ? I suspect very
little. Either there are huge numbers of cats, or something else is doing
the damage. If there are huge numbers of cats, unless every household has a
huge number of pets, most of them will be feral. Get my drift ? Right,
leading on from here, if just say 10% of the problem is down to domestic
cats, how much effect will legislation have ? Little to none is the answer,
oh, and lots of taxpayers money wasted at the same time. THIS is the root of
my scepticism, exposed, bare, vulnerable, whatever, but in the open for all
to see. I haven't seen or heard any arguments that are strong enough to
destroy my scepticism, but I remain open to them if they exist. Bron
certainly has the energy - see the amount of material she posts on here - I
just think she's about an infinite number of miles off the mark. I don't
think she's looking to find the solutions to the real issues - I really
don't. Now if she really put her energy into dealing with the real
issues..........

The REAL causes of the problems we face must be found. I suspect most, if
not all of them will be down to man. ONLY when we have armed ourselves with
the FACTS, can we begin finding a true answer. Please don't take this to
mean don't do anything now - there's plenty we can do already, for example,
controlling and recycling of waste. But at the same time, bear in mind that
things tend to be cyclic, examples are day/night, sun/rain, tides, etc. Some
cycles take a lot longer. The after effects of Krakatoa were still evident ~
100 years on. Ice ages took even longer. Who's to say that global warming
isn't just a natural cycle of earth climate, and we just haven't been
collecting data long enough to be certain ? As I've said before, there is so
much we DON'T know about this planet. Only this week I read in New Scientist
about deep sea coral being damaged off Scotland - I'd never have expected it
there; apparently it was only only discovered in 1998.

So you will see, given my discussion above, I feel my scepticism is well
justified. It also saddens me to think of our good friends fattus furryus
lumpus (the cat) getting a raw deal of it, yet again due to mans ignorance
and fear. Maybe it's justified, maybe not. My view is there is room for
doubt. Maybe someday the cat will get a public appology from mankind.

For the record, we ALL have to adapt to the habits of others ! This is how
we get along, keep to the law, etc.

&gt; As a general rule, people don't like acknowledging their idiocy .. you are

&gt;&gt; Try asking the typical Aboriginal what he thinks.

&gt; Have you ever done that yourself. I know heaps of Aborigines and I'm
fully
&gt; aware of that they think. How do you come by the knowledge that you have?
&gt; Ever been to outback NT and talked to the Aborigines there or do you get
&gt; your information from the minority of them on TV?

&gt;&gt; I used to think the
&gt;&gt; American Indian was hard done by - but hells-bells I feel sorry for
&gt;&gt; the native Australians.

&gt; You are ignorant of the issues and believe only what you see on TV. The
&gt;&quot;native&quot; Australians are something that you have never come across before.

&gt;&gt; Full racial equality enshrined in law..

&gt; Yes

&gt;&gt; The last figures I saw (around 94 IIRC) showed over 60% of deaths in
&gt;&gt; custody were non-white.

&gt; bwahahahaaaa.... caught you in a lie there... your dishonesty has been
&gt; noted.

&gt;&quot;Aboriginal people account for 19 per cent of deaths in prison custody&quot; ..

&gt; Gosh that would mean that 81% of people who die in prison AREN'T
Aboriginal
&gt; ...

&gt; But still, regardless of how many suicide in the prisons, we still cannot
&gt; match your history of genocide.

&gt;&gt; Exactly my question. The could not have done it themselves - so....

&gt; sorry, your ignorance cracks me up .. they're not dying of beatings of any
&gt; sort you idiot .. go and look it all up, perhaps then you wouldn't need to
&gt; make it up as you went along :-)

&gt; Back to your reports:

&gt;&quot;Thirty-seven of the 99 deaths investigated by the Royal Commission were
due
&gt; to illness, just over one-third compared with over two-thirds in 1993-94.&quot;

&gt; Is it time by the way to point out about the british treatment of the
scots,
&gt; the welsh &amp; the irish? Your history just dates back further than ours but
&gt; the atrocities are far worse than anything we have ever inflicted.

:)just think she's about an infinite number of miles off the mark. I don't
:)think she's looking to find the solutions to the real issues - I really
:)don't. Now if she really put her energy into dealing with the real
:)issues..........

You have made a couple of valid points. There are many other factors
that affect the environment in Australia - the two most destructive
are urbanisation (through the progressive increase of city owned land
into rural districts) and pasturalisation (the increased use of land
to run sheep, cattle etc). These two factors have destroyed more
species in Australia than the cat ever could.

However, due to the numbers of people coming in from overseas and the
increased births we now see, urbanisation is a reality. Australians
don't want their cities to look like New York - people like their own
back yard - how else can we have a barbie? So as long as we continue
to let immigrants into the country and continue to have babies our
cities will grow and this will impact on the environment.

Also, people will not complain about pasturalisation because their
food comes from it. It is justifiable (and I don't necessarily agree)
that if the land is being used for food production, then it's okay to
destroy whole species.

Then we come to the cat. Yes, the majority of cats are feral or
semi-feral, meaning that they rely on an external (not human) source
for food. This means the wild (and introduced) species in Australia.
There are programmes to eliminate ferals - the Army does regular
sweeps and shoots them. Not an ideal solution, but better than
poisoning or seeing them die from disease. I personally don't think
the feral cat problem will *ever* be controlled in Australia -
particularly when there are people who hold onto the mistaken belief
that cats have to have a litter before being desexed (yes, I know it's
a stab at Bob, but unfortunately he's not the only one). The more
litters that are born, the less homes can be found, the more cats are
let go in suburban and rural areas and the more ferals are created.

So, now we finally come to the owned or domestic kitty. This is
something we can take charge over. We aren't depriving people of
homes or food by keeping our kitties indoors. There are approximately
4 million owned cats in Australia - if each outdoors one takes an
average of 3 - 4 native animals per week (which has been shown by some
surveys) then that's about 8 million native animals per week (assuming
that half are outdoors cats - and that's probably conservative). That
has surely got to have an impact on the environment. And it's totally
preventable - keep the cat inside and it can't hunt. It's so simple!

So, yes, you are right. There are other factor besides cats that harm
the environment. But by controlling domestic cats (something we can
do easily and without hurting them) we start to aleviate the problem
somewhat.

&gt; to be counted. But by the theory of ancestry the question really is,
which
&gt; do you &quot;claim&quot;. When your ancestry is mixed, do you claim all or just one
&gt; country? And how far back do you go? After all, most British are from
&gt; somewhere else originally anyway. Me, I consider myself to be wholey
&gt; Australian. I was born &amp; bred here, I have lived here all my life and
only
&gt; leave the country when work requires or periodically I get dragged around
to
&gt; some airshow or other :-( As for &quot;white&quot; Aussies, ever seen one of
those?
&gt; *grin* .. i'm not sure of the demographics but many of our immigrants post
&gt; war have been from countries other than England. There have been an
influx
&gt; of British I know, because we all remember the &quot;A Current Affair (TV
Show)&quot;
&gt; articles of the classing whinging pom going home because Australia &quot;sux
like
&gt; a hoover&quot; :-) .....

&gt; I guess i'd have to have a look at the stats, but with regards to my
&gt; workplace &amp; the area where I live, the mix is most definitely not majority
&gt; caucasion (which I assume you mean by &quot;white&quot;).

&gt;&gt;&gt;2. There were people here BEFORE the poms arrived ...

&gt;&gt; I am aware of that. However they now form a small percentage of the
&gt;&gt; population partly because of the racism practised against them since
&gt;&gt; whites arrived in Australia. Many Aboriginals would probably say it
&gt;&gt; still goes on. And for some reason I don't think you are an Aboriginal.

&gt; Lets address this. 2% of our population is Aboriginal, and yes they have
&gt; suffered greatly since the British arrived in Australia. The whole of the
&gt; Tasmanian aboriginal population was wiped out by the British Colonists in
&gt; the 1700/1800's until there were none left. From what I know of history,
&gt; Britain is the only country that can claim complete genocide of a race of
&gt; people

&gt; The majority of Aborigines do not claim racist goes on. Charles Perkins
and
&gt; his pack of publicity hunters do moan long &amp; loud about the problem and
&gt; there certainly are problems as there are in the United States with the
&gt; negro population and Britain has a racial problem also. Our redeeming
&gt; quality is that we are working towards reconcilliation, but it is
difficult
&gt; when the goalposts continue to be moved by splinter groups with their own
&gt; agendas. Much of the history against the aboriginals was by the British
and
&gt; then continued on by the Australian Government under the control/guidance
of
&gt; the British.

&gt; We could get into a discussion about the &quot;furfies&quot; about racism in
&gt; Australia, there are times and places for that (drop it into eMail ...
&gt; b ... @webone.com.au). All I will say is that Australia's history of
racism
&gt; isn't as bad as some, and is worse than others... we, like Britain and the
&gt; USA suffer from ignorance and a blind arrogance in believing that Britain
is
&gt; the &quot;mother country&quot; and that the Queen is god, and that all other beings
&gt; are &quot;lesser&quot;. This is changing but with all things, it is quite slow.

&gt;&gt; As it happens I agree with you that cats are a great danger to what's
&gt;&gt; left of the native wildlife in Australia. Not to mention dingoes, rats,
&gt;&gt; mice, rabbits and sheep which all damage the environment.

&gt; They have built a whopping great dingo fence to keep them out of some
&gt; places, unfortunately the cats can jump that fence. Dingoes are also
useful
&gt; for keeping the human population down :-). Discount sheep also because
they
&gt; don't run wild.

&gt;&gt; So lets get
&gt;&gt; rid of all the nasty foreign species and make Australia a land fit for
&gt;&gt; marsupials. And maybe we should get rid of the whites as well and let
&gt;&gt; the Aboriginals have their land back.

&gt; Oh sarcasm is the lowest form of wit. Some would say that the aborigines
&gt; have much of their land back, and much of it was not taken from them in
the
&gt; first place, just goes to show the ignorance of some doesn't it. Your
idea
&gt; is good but not workable as it would displace many people with no &quot;home&quot;
to
&gt; go back to.... however, lets lay blame where it belongs, at the feet of
the
&gt; British who &quot;invaded&quot; this land and slaughtered it's inhabitants.

&gt; Then lets get to the issue of the land they can't have back. Maralinga ..
&gt; remember that one or do I need to remind you of the atomic bombs that the
&gt; BRITISH dropped, thus making a huge amount of aboriginal land
uninhabitable
&gt; (but didn't bother to tell the aborigines that).

Thanks for that Vicki. Very well put. I agree control of domestic pets will
have some effect directionally. Also like you, I really doubt the cat issue
will ever be brought under control (I just acn't see ALL cats being caught).
So another tack must be taken. Control of urbanisation, plus control
pasturalisation will give your native species far more chance than the cat
issue surely ?

&gt; to run sheep, cattle etc). These two factors have destroyed more
&gt; species in Australia than the cat ever could.

&gt; However, due to the numbers of people coming in from overseas and the
&gt; increased births we now see, urbanisation is a reality. Australians
&gt; don't want their cities to look like New York - people like their own
&gt; back yard - how else can we have a barbie? So as long as we continue
&gt; to let immigrants into the country and continue to have babies our
&gt; cities will grow and this will impact on the environment.

&gt; Also, people will not complain about pasturalisation because their
&gt; food comes from it. It is justifiable (and I don't necessarily agree)
&gt; that if the land is being used for food production, then it's okay to
&gt; destroy whole species.

&gt; Then we come to the cat. Yes, the majority of cats are feral or
&gt; semi-feral, meaning that they rely on an external (not human) source
&gt; for food. This means the wild (and introduced) species in Australia.
&gt; There are programmes to eliminate ferals - the Army does regular
&gt; sweeps and shoots them. Not an ideal solution, but better than
&gt; poisoning or seeing them die from disease. I personally don't think
&gt; the feral cat problem will *ever* be controlled in Australia -
&gt; particularly when there are people who hold onto the mistaken belief
&gt; that cats have to have a litter before being desexed (yes, I know it's
&gt; a stab at Bob, but unfortunately he's not the only one). The more
&gt; litters that are born, the less homes can be found, the more cats are
&gt; let go in suburban and rural areas and the more ferals are created.

&gt; So, now we finally come to the owned or domestic kitty. This is
&gt; something we can take charge over. We aren't depriving people of
&gt; homes or food by keeping our kitties indoors. There are approximately
&gt; 4 million owned cats in Australia - if each outdoors one takes an
&gt; average of 3 - 4 native animals per week (which has been shown by some
&gt; surveys) then that's about 8 million native animals per week (assuming
&gt; that half are outdoors cats - and that's probably conservative). That
&gt; has surely got to have an impact on the environment. And it's totally
&gt; preventable - keep the cat inside and it can't hunt. It's so simple!

&gt; So, yes, you are right. There are other factor besides cats that harm
&gt; the environment. But by controlling domestic cats (something we can
&gt; do easily and without hurting them) we start to aleviate the problem
&gt; somewhat.

Hey Bron, given the amount of material you post on here, plus all the stuff
you say is being posted elsewhere about us brits (that I guess you're

&gt;&gt; In article &lt;39d08 ... @iridium.webone.com.au&gt;, Bron &lt;m ... @where.am.i&gt; writes

&gt;&gt; Wales is being given back to the Welsh, and Scotland to the Scottish.
&gt;&gt; Wales has it's own Assembly now (a small but significant step - remember
&gt;&gt; the quote 'every journey starts with a single step') and Scotland has
&gt;&gt; it's own Parliament with some control over revenue.

&gt; Well that is good news, I wonder if they'll then move to a republic? :-)
&gt; The Republic of Wales .. has a nice ring to it ....

&gt;&gt; NI is a problem as there are a lot of extremists there devoted to
&gt;&gt; knocking five bells out of each other. However it will happen in time,
&gt;&gt; but that's a long time.

&gt; A problem that britain created for itself :-( which is different for
the
&gt; problems they generally created for others ... it's a pity too because
&gt; Ireland is such a nice place to visit (wouldn't want to live there right
now
&gt; :-) ... and there is a country that would certainly want to be a Republic
&gt; ...

&gt;&gt; However it seems to be OK to say that being an Australian makes you
&gt;&gt; superior.

&gt; Superiour? Na, different, proud .. and NOT british in any way shape or
&gt; form ... By the way, there is some serious pommy bashing going on in
other
&gt; NG's at the moment (that i'm simply reading ....) Wonder what woke that
all
&gt; up :-)

&gt;&gt; Just what is a 'fuck up fairy visit' - just so I can check *my* past,
&gt;&gt; about which you and other people on this NG know nothing.

&gt; The countries past rather than your own. Some have been listed already.

&gt;&gt; PS what about a land fit for marsupials? No sheep? Are the stories
&gt;&gt; (told me by a Kiwi) of sheep-shagging in Australia true?

&gt; :-) The Kiwis have you conned, there are more sheep per head of
population
&gt; in New Zealand. Do you know that they're not allowed to bring their
&gt; girlfriends to Rugby matches, because the keep jumping the fence and
eating
&gt; the grass :-).

&gt; Sheep remain &quot;penned&quot; prior to ending up on the dinner plate. I'm not big
&gt; on lamb/hoget myself and only ever eat the leg (hmmmm... roast lamb
......)
&gt; but at $6.99 a kilo I don't eat that much of it, small amounts of meat per
&gt; day but that's it. There are also more cliffs per capital in NZ than here
&gt; :-)

&gt; Our land would be fit for marsupials without the cats, rabbits, foxes and
&gt; mice. In New Zealand their Kiwi and other native animals are at risk from
&gt; non native preditors as well, and to lose the Kiwi would be a great
tragedy.

&gt;&quot;But life for kiwi was about to get much worse. The Europeans were on
their
&gt; way&quot;
&gt;&quot;More and more Europeans arrived, bringing cats, dogs, stoats, weasels and
&gt; ferrets. The introduced animals wreaked havoc on kiwi&quot;

&gt; Although by far their biggest preditor was European man .. gosh that'd be
&gt; you again :-)

&gt; Do you have AAA to shoot down any birds that come near too ? I've had a

&gt; couldn't catch the guy who did it due to overstrained resources ? It's
just
&gt; a lump of metal, so who really cares ? I don't.

&gt;&gt; I also have a friend who owns no cats, and yet his front doorway has
&gt;&gt; an overpowering smell of cat urine when you walk up to it - is that
&gt;&gt; fair to him?

&gt; Hmmmmmmmm - I have to ask you if he came home drunk one night, and
couldn't
&gt; get his keys out ? Nowhere else to pee, so the porch it is.....

&gt;&gt; The Egyptian culture died millenia ago. It is no longer ok to hate
&gt;&gt; people just because they don't enslave themselves to a feline as we
&gt;&gt; do. We experience relaxation when we pet our cats in the morning.
&gt;&gt; Others experience relaxation when they look in their backyard and see
&gt;&gt; a pretty bird in their birdbath. When they come home from work and
&gt;&gt; find 2 dead bluejays floating in it (true story), they get a bit
&gt;&gt; upset, same way we do when some cretinous mullet gets his kicks by
&gt;&gt; torturing the neighbourhood cats.

&gt; I don't hate people who have different views. They are entitled to them.
&gt; However, I am a realist. When I feel people are not realistic, I tell
them.

&gt;&gt; The quarrel here is not with the people who just want to live a
&gt;&gt; cat-free life. The problem here is the people who refuse to take the
&gt;&gt; steps to be good neighbours, and help them acheive this.

&gt; Bron has 2 cats, or have you missed that ? The other issue is this : to be
a
&gt; good neighbour, you have to be tolerant to a degree at least of your
&gt; neighbours needs too. What about kids playing in the street ? What about
&gt; people having parties, dogs barking, etc ? I agree with you on the subject
&gt; of good neighbours - I am very lucky where I live. I hope it stays that
way.

&gt; As a point of reference, way back in the 17th century over here, we had a
&gt; massive plague, just before the great fire of London. The cats were
actually
&gt; helping to keep the rats at bay, as is there predatory role, but they were
&gt; our allies. The rats and their fleas were spreading the plague, not the
&gt; cats. And who did we end up persecuting, and why ? The cats, through
&gt; ignorance and fear. So I ask people to just for once be absolutely certain
&gt; of the facts before they embark on programs of eradication. We scarcely
know
&gt; anything about this planet. We know how to wipe ourselves out as a race,
&gt; indeed we hold the inventory of weapons necessary to do this. Science
keeps
&gt; meddling with genetics, as we've meddled with so much of nature in the
past.
&gt; Already there are whispers in the wind of GM crop trials in this country
&gt; leading to cross contamination. So are we THAT sure the cat IS the problem
?
&gt; I doubt it. I for one think that WE are the problem.

:)So another tack must be taken. Control of urbanisation, plus control
:)pasturalisation will give your native species far more chance than the cat
:)issue surely ?

Oh, sure you're right! But as I said in my post, so long as more
people want to live here and eat food, no one is going to stand for a
decrease in either urbanisation or pasturalisation.

IMHO all these factors (including cats) need to be addressed
*together* for the good of the environment.

No, of course not! I know my cats are perfectly happy inside. That's
what's so strange about this thread. I have no proof that
Bob/Sally/Franks cats are unhappy outside. I think they need to be
aware of the dangers around them, but if they feel that it's safe, who
am I to argue? But it should go both ways. They don't know my cats.
They've never met my cats. My cats have never needed to go to a pet
psychologist and so no one really knows what's going on in their
brains. But they're happy and contented. I think the decision has to
be made on an individual basis according to the safety to the cats,
the environment and the cats themselves.

And BTW, indoors is the *only* place to be in Canberra in winter! I
lived there for six months about 15 years ago. I absolutely loved it
but after Brisbane the cold was a little much to take! I lived in
Queanbeyan first then right near Woden shopping centre. What part do

&gt; :)Thanks for that Vicki. Very well put. I agree control of domestic pets
will
&gt; :)have some effect directionally. Also like you, I really doubt the cat
issue
&gt; :)will ever be brought under control (I just acn't see ALL cats being
caught).
&gt; :)So another tack must be taken. Control of urbanisation, plus control
&gt; :)pasturalisation will give your native species far more chance than the
cat
&gt; :)issue surely ?

&gt; Oh, sure you're right! But as I said in my post, so long as more
&gt; people want to live here and eat food, no one is going to stand for a
&gt; decrease in either urbanisation or pasturalisation.

&gt; IMHO all these factors (including cats) need to be addressed
&gt; *together* for the good of the environment.

:)Well, start dealing with the OTHER issues as well. Then and only then can
:)what you &amp; bron say about cats be justified.

Isn't it better that people deal with what they can, as they can, one
issue at a time, than do *nothing* because the problem might appear to
be too big? I do lots of things to help the environment - I recycle,
don't litter etc and another way I am helping is by not allowing my
cats to destroy it further.

I also live on a small block of land (reducing urbanisation) and I eat
very little meat (not quite a vegetarian, but nearly). That of course
doesn't reduce grain or orchard crops, and I really don't know how to
go about helping that situation.

But I will continue to help where I can - and at the moment that
included keeping my kitties inside.

&gt;This just shows the difference between Australia and the UK. A recent

&gt;at least 10 different types of birds and too many different kinds of

&gt;get to see. Just yesterday when I went to get the mail I saw a tiny
&gt;little Bearded Lizard (Frilly Lizard) - it was only about 8 cm long
&gt;(that's 3' in the old money). My first thought was &quot;if my kitties

&gt;Can't you understand how important it is for Australians to try to
&gt;keep the balance of this delicate ecosystem?

"/> You have just show the difference between yourself and myself. I can
actually take the crap some people publish and interpret it

Yes, there may be 1500 different plants and animals in the average
back garden, if you include all the birds, insects and invertebrate.
But I was talking about normal animals.

Before the trees got big we used to have a bird table (we don't know
because there is nowhere safe enough for it) and I think our record
was over 40 different birds in a year.

In Britain we have a diverse ecology, with more introduced species
that I expect Australia has. I've seen listed things like the rabbit,
fox and cat, well only the fox is native to the UK - both rabbits and
cats were not native until man introduced them.

&gt;the following:

&gt;:)I ask you this : In a country with a sparse population density such as
&gt;:)Australia, and the destruction (supposedly due to cats) to wildlife being so
&gt;:)rife, what percentage of it is down to domestic pets ? I suspect very
&gt;:)little. Either there are huge numbers of cats, or something else is doing
&gt;:)the damage. If there are huge numbers of cats, unless every household has a
&gt;:)huge number of pets, most of them will be feral. Get my drift ? Right,
&gt;:)leading on from here, if just say 10% of the problem is down to domestic
&gt;:)cats, how much effect will legislation have ? Little to none is the answer,
&gt;:)oh, and lots of taxpayers money wasted at the same time. THIS is the root of
&gt;:)my scepticism, exposed, bare, vulnerable, whatever, but in the open for all
&gt;:)to see. I haven't seen or heard any arguments that are strong enough to
&gt;:)destroy my scepticism, but I remain open to them if they exist. Bron
&gt;:)certainly has the energy - see the amount of material she posts on here - I
&gt;:)just think she's about an infinite number of miles off the mark. I don't
&gt;:)think she's looking to find the solutions to the real issues - I really
&gt;:)don't. Now if she really put her energy into dealing with the real
&gt;:)issues..........

&gt;You have made a couple of valid points. There are many other factors
&gt;that affect the environment in Australia - the two most destructive
&gt;are urbanisation (through the progressive increase of city owned land
&gt;into rural districts)

"/> True of all countries, including the UK.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and pasturalisation (the increased use of land
&gt;to run sheep, cattle etc).

"/> no, can't give you that. Bron has stated clearly that sheep are kept
penned at all times - and she would not have made that up would she?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;These two factors have destroyed more
&gt;species in Australia than the cat ever could.

"/> Actually, I don't agree. They may have displace species from some
areas, but then they provide opportunities for others. In a country as
bi as Oz I can't see how you have managed to destroy any animal/bird.
Plants yes, that is a problem the world over.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;However, due to the numbers of people coming in from overseas and the
&gt;increased births we now see, urbanisation is a reality. Australians
&gt;don't want their cities to look like New York - people like their own
&gt;back yard - how else can we have a barbie? So as long as we continue
&gt;to let immigrants into the country and continue to have babies our
&gt;cities will grow and this will impact on the environment.

"/> Now correct me if I'm wrong(I don't have my stats like on this machine
so I can't check myself) but I thought Bron gave the population of
Australia as 18 million. Seems to me, especially when I look at a map,
that you have a long way to go before you have a problem of
overcrowding.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Also, people will not complain about pasturalisation because their
&gt;food comes from it. It is justifiable (and I don't necessarily agree)
&gt;that if the land is being used for food production, then it's okay to
&gt;destroy whole species.

&gt;Then we come to the cat. Yes, the majority of cats are feral or
&gt;semi-feral, meaning that they rely on an external (not human) source
&gt;for food. This means the wild (and introduced) species in Australia.
&gt;There are programmes to eliminate ferals - the Army does regular
&gt;sweeps and shoots them. Not an ideal solution, but better than
&gt;poisoning or seeing them die from disease. I personally don't think
&gt;the feral cat problem will *ever* be controlled in Australia -
&gt;particularly when there are people who hold onto the mistaken belief
&gt;that cats have to have a litter before being desexed (yes, I know it's
&gt;a stab at Bob, but unfortunately he's not the only one). The more
&gt;litters that are born, the less homes can be found, the more cats are
&gt;let go in suburban and rural areas and the more ferals are created.

&gt;So, now we finally come to the owned or domestic kitty. This is
&gt;something we can take charge over. We aren't depriving people of
&gt;homes or food by keeping our kitties indoors. There are approximately
&gt;4 million owned cats in Australia - if each outdoors one takes an
&gt;average of 3 - 4 native animals per week (which has been shown by some
&gt;surveys) then that's about 8 million native animals per week (assuming
&gt;that half are outdoors cats - and that's probably conservative). That
&gt;has surely got to have an impact on the environment.

"/> Hardly, just try to work it out. 4 animals a week from your 1500 per
back garden.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And it's totally
&gt;preventable - keep the cat inside and it can't hunt. It's so simple!

"/> So, don't have cats. That is the simple answer. But being cruel and
keeping them in is NOT the answer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;So, yes, you are right. There are other factor besides cats that harm
&gt;the environment. But by controlling domestic cats (something we can
&gt;do easily and without hurting them) we start to aleviate the problem
&gt;somewhat.

"/> But it does hurt them, it deprives them of some of the rights you want
to protect in the other wild animals.

right do I have to say different? So what right do you have to say
I'm wrong?

&gt;&gt;the following:

&gt;&gt;:)I ask you this : In a country with a sparse population density such as
&gt;&gt;:)Australia, and the destruction (supposedly due to cats) to wildlife being so
&gt;&gt;:)rife, what percentage of it is down to domestic pets ? I suspect very
&gt;&gt;:)little. Either there are huge numbers of cats, or something else is doing
&gt;&gt;:)the damage. If there are huge numbers of cats, unless every household has a
&gt;&gt;:)huge number of pets, most of them will be feral. Get my drift ? Right,
&gt;&gt;:)leading on from here, if just say 10% of the problem is down to domestic
&gt;&gt;:)cats, how much effect will legislation have ? Little to none is the answer,
&gt;&gt;:)oh, and lots of taxpayers money wasted at the same time. THIS is the root of
&gt;&gt;:)my scepticism, exposed, bare, vulnerable, whatever, but in the open for all
&gt;&gt;:)to see. I haven't seen or heard any arguments that are strong enough to
&gt;&gt;:)destroy my scepticism, but I remain open to them if they exist. Bron
&gt;&gt;:)certainly has the energy - see the amount of material she posts on here - I
&gt;&gt;:)just think she's about an infinite number of miles off the mark. I don't
&gt;&gt;:)think she's looking to find the solutions to the real issues - I really
&gt;&gt;:)don't. Now if she really put her energy into dealing with the real
&gt;&gt;:)issues..........

&gt;&gt;You have made a couple of valid points. There are many other factors
&gt;&gt;that affect the environment in Australia - the two most destructive
&gt;&gt;are urbanisation (through the progressive increase of city owned land
&gt;&gt;into rural districts)

&gt;True of all countries, including the UK.

&gt;&gt;and pasturalisation (the increased use of land
&gt;&gt;to run sheep, cattle etc).

&gt;no, can't give you that. Bron has stated clearly that sheep are kept
&gt;penned at all times - and she would not have made that up would she?

&gt;&gt;These two factors have destroyed more
&gt;&gt;species in Australia than the cat ever could.

&gt;Actually, I don't agree. They may have displace species from some
&gt;areas, but then they provide opportunities for others. In a country as
&gt;bi as Oz I can't see how you have managed to destroy any animal/bird.
&gt;Plants yes, that is a problem the world over.

&gt;&gt;However, due to the numbers of people coming in from overseas and the
&gt;&gt;increased births we now see, urbanisation is a reality. Australians
&gt;&gt;don't want their cities to look like New York - people like their own
&gt;&gt;back yard - how else can we have a barbie? So as long as we continue
&gt;&gt;to let immigrants into the country and continue to have babies our
&gt;&gt;cities will grow and this will impact on the environment.

&gt;Now correct me if I'm wrong(I don't have my stats like on this machine
&gt;so I can't check myself) but I thought Bron gave the population of
&gt;Australia as 18 million. Seems to me, especially when I look at a map,
&gt;that you have a long way to go before you have a problem of
&gt;overcrowding.

&gt;&gt;Also, people will not complain about pasturalisation because their
&gt;&gt;food comes from it. It is justifiable (and I don't necessarily agree)
&gt;&gt;that if the land is being used for food production, then it's okay to
&gt;&gt;destroy whole species.

&gt;&gt;Then we come to the cat. Yes, the majority of cats are feral or
&gt;&gt;semi-feral, meaning that they rely on an external (not human) source
&gt;&gt;for food. This means the wild (and introduced) species in Australia.
&gt;&gt;There are programmes to eliminate ferals - the Army does regular
&gt;&gt;sweeps and shoots them. Not an ideal solution, but better than
&gt;&gt;poisoning or seeing them die from disease. I personally don't think
&gt;&gt;the feral cat problem will *ever* be controlled in Australia -
&gt;&gt;particularly when there are people who hold onto the mistaken belief
&gt;&gt;that cats have to have a litter before being desexed (yes, I know it's
&gt;&gt;a stab at Bob, but unfortunately he's not the only one). The more
&gt;&gt;litters that are born, the less homes can be found, the more cats are
&gt;&gt;let go in suburban and rural areas and the more ferals are created.

&gt;&gt;So, now we finally come to the owned or domestic kitty. This is
&gt;&gt;something we can take charge over. We aren't depriving people of
&gt;&gt;homes or food by keeping our kitties indoors. There are approximately
&gt;&gt;4 million owned cats in Australia - if each outdoors one takes an
&gt;&gt;average of 3 - 4 native animals per week (which has been shown by some
&gt;&gt;surveys) then that's about 8 million native animals per week (assuming
&gt;&gt;that half are outdoors cats - and that's probably conservative). That
&gt;&gt;has surely got to have an impact on the environment.

&gt;Hardly, just try to work it out. 4 animals a week from your 1500 per
&gt;back garden.

&gt;&gt;And it's totally
&gt;&gt;preventable - keep the cat inside and it can't hunt. It's so simple!

&gt;So, don't have cats. That is the simple answer. But being cruel and
&gt;keeping them in is NOT the answer.

&gt;&gt;So, yes, you are right. There are other factor besides cats that harm
&gt;&gt;the environment. But by controlling domestic cats (something we can
&gt;&gt;do easily and without hurting them) we start to aleviate the problem
&gt;&gt;somewhat.

&gt;But it does hurt them, it deprives them of some of the rights you want
&gt;to protect in the other wild animals.

&gt;--
&gt;Bob.

&gt;Looking forward to the start of the new millennium on January 1st
&gt;2001.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Any wildlife in the area.

&gt;&gt;I'll take that as an inability to answer the question as you've now said
&gt;&gt;that twice.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So there is not much wildlife about in your area. Next I suppose you
&gt;&gt;&gt; will claim it has all been wiped out by cats.

&gt;&gt;Much of it has.

&gt;How come the cat is so much more destructive in your part of the world
&gt;than elsewhere?

&gt;&gt;&gt; They are all wildlife, just like a cat.

&gt;&gt;I'll take that as your inability to comprehend basic facts.

&gt;Your mind is very small isn't it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well I, as a thinking person, did.

&gt;&gt;You think like a child, my 7 year old has a wider thought process than you
&gt;&gt;do and can differentiate facts a lot better than you can.

&gt;Oh, well having inherited some of your genes I somehow doubt that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I posted my answer.

&gt;&gt;Rubbish, you posted a childish, factless response.

&gt;I posted my answer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Very funny, the child like thought processes seem to come from your
&gt;&gt;&gt; direction.

&gt;&gt;:-) can't even think of a good comeback can you?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am a person with over 40 years experience with cats

&gt;&gt;Dear god, and yet you still cannot put any more thought into issues than a
&gt;&gt;small child!

&gt;Well I lest I put a lot more than you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;(an a lot of
&gt;&gt;&gt; other animals as well). I have a scientific background, by that I mean
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was taught to thing about things a put things in context.

&gt;&gt;In other words you are not qualified to make the statements that you have,
&gt;&gt;you are merely posting OPINION.

&gt;No, that is not what I said.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe that to have any animal simply so that you can bend it to
&gt;&gt;&gt; your rules is wrong. And yes, the same can apply to children.

&gt;&gt;Yes, an opinion. Are you unlawful? Because if you abide by the law then
&gt;&gt;you are &quot;bending to a set of rules&quot; thus making your statement utter crap
&gt;&gt;(as usual in your posts).

&gt;Laws are made for man and by man. There is a concept in law that
&gt;ignorance of a law is not defense - but ignorance itself is.

&gt;As a cat is by its nature its own master, and as it can neither read
&gt;nor talk, it cannot be bound by the laws of man.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But a cat, deprived of something that makes it a cat, is no longer
&gt;&gt;&gt; really a cat.

&gt;&gt;But we now know that you are not qualified to make that judgement.

&gt;It is not my judgement. It is a statement of fact. Try reading a
&gt;little bit about animals.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Looking at the headers the cross posting is mostly to cat groups. As
&gt;&gt;&gt; we are talking about cats it is easy to assume the other person is on
&gt;&gt;&gt; a cat group. It matters little.

&gt;&gt;Agreed, but you brought it up .. I was just qualifying the facts for you.
&gt;&gt;Regardless of how many &quot;cat groups&quot; are in the header, I am still in a pet
&gt;&gt;group and I didn't cross post the thread.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep, a lot do come back. The thought they were going to a country that
&gt;&gt;&gt; had a future. Then they found out what so many of its people were like
&gt;&gt;&gt; and then they did not want to be part of that future. In short, they
&gt;&gt;&gt; had brains.

&gt;&gt;All a matter of opinion, we are glad they are gone. Perhaps they're like
&gt;&gt;you and live by their own set of &quot;rules&quot; which means that they do not
&gt;&gt;conform to the community standards. The ones I've seen expected to be
&gt;&gt;treated like the &quot;gods&quot; they believed themselves to be and were terribly
&gt;&gt;upset when they found out that we no longer consider the British to be
&gt;&gt;&quot;gods&quot;, they are ordinary people just like us and are expected to act that
&gt;&gt;way. Narrowminded, opinionated, self centered ... hmmm... sounds just like
&gt;&gt;you!!

&gt;&gt;Australia is one of the most pleasant places in the world to be. All the
&gt;&gt;advantages and few of the disadvantages.

&gt;One very large disadvantage, it has people like you living there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't think

&gt;&gt;Yes, we've noticed that

&gt;&gt;&gt;of a single medical breakthrough you have had that has
&gt;&gt;&gt; not been based on British or American research. Better athletes, well
&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose you got some training chasing the sheep :)

&gt;&gt;There are lots, the breakthroughs with IVF,

&gt;First done in the UK.

&gt;&gt;the treatment of HIV/AIDS... to

&gt;Well it does seem to be more of a problem in your country. But still
&gt;the leading research is UK/USA led.

&gt;&gt;many and numerous to go into. As for sheep, I wouldn't know I've never been
&gt;&gt;close to one except when it's rotating over a hot flame :-) *hmmmm yummy*
&gt;&gt;... And 2nd in the world for percapita olympic victories :-) Much higher
&gt;&gt;than I would have thought. 2nd to your 38th. And that's before we get
&gt;&gt;into cricket .... :-)

&gt;Could be that most people in the UK have better things to do with they
&gt;time than playing sport.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As for the Military, when was the last time an overseas government
&gt;&gt;&gt; called on you crack military?

&gt;&gt;It will NEVER happen again, we learnt our lesson when we allowed the British
&gt;&gt;to use our men as cannon fodder whilst they cowardly stood back and watched.

&gt;Your view of history is a disgraceful indictment of the Australian
&gt;school system.

&gt;&gt;Britain will find that the Australian (and New Zealand) Armies are no longer
&gt;&gt;at their beck and call and that next time they have a problem they'll need
&gt;&gt;to send their own troops.

&gt;We usually do, we play our part in keeping the world a free place for
&gt;you to have beach parties in.

&gt;&gt; (and whilst we're at it .. what DID happen to the
&gt;&gt;harriers in the Gulf ... seemed to me they simply fell out of the sky....)

&gt;If I remember we lost how many was it? Oh yes, ONE, due to engine
&gt;failure. For hours spent in combat missions that put our air force in
&gt;an enviable position.

&gt;But then you see, we often went to our friends in the gulf to fly
&gt;joint exercises so we knew what to expect.

&gt;&gt;Have you hear of East Timor? Somalia? Kuwait? Our soldiers do their jobs
&gt;&gt;brilliantly, even with the abyssmal record of foreign leadership (oh, that'd
&gt;&gt;be YOU again :-)

&gt;East Timor? Somalia? Yes I seem to remember seeing Australian troops
&gt;land when it was safe to do so.

&gt;And how many did you sent to the Gulf? Wow, that big force really made
&gt;the news :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; And Diana and he friend died in a car accident.

&gt;&gt;Popular, non British opinion, is that there is more to that car accident
&gt;&gt;than will ever be released to the public.

&gt;Of course there was, nobody could possible believe that the driver was
&gt;that drunk. Must have been one of the Ozzie photographer tipping booze
&gt;down the driver while his mate took the sick pics.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I seem to remember
&gt;&gt;&gt; that at least two of the chasing photographers, almost certainly the
&gt;&gt;&gt; real cause of the accident, were Australian.

&gt;&gt;Actually, you'd be wrong. French officials have ruled that the &quot;chasing
&gt;&gt;papparazzi&quot; were too far behind to be the cause of that accident.... :-)
&gt;&gt;But nice try.

&gt;And you believe that.....

Every year, we'd get blackbirds nesting in it. My cats never bothered
them BUT, I'll never forget one year in particular. The poor blackbirds
were hounded *mercilessly* by a magpie and what a defence those
blackbird parents put up. Sadly, after a week, it was too much and the
magpie not only overcame the adult blackbirds, but it killed every
single blackbird chick. To me, what made it even worse was that the
magpie didn't eat a single chcik, it simply killed every single one and
left them scattered across the lawn. Talk about cold blooded,
pre-meditated murder - it was *awful*. Since then, I have had a dislike
of magpies, due to the cold-blooded nature of what I saw. It wasn't
killing for food - it was almost killing for fun.

Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on Mon, 02 Oct 2000
06:48:07 +1130, greg &lt;g ... @pinegap.com&gt; purred the following:

:)&gt; Here's a new cat killing web site..
:)
:) www.feral-cat.com

Well, I looked at it. It has been put up by The Australian Society of
Cat Haters (anyone can check deja to see that they themselves said
this is one of their last posts). They don't say this on the site,
however, and have a .com domain name - probably thinking that they
can't be got at by Australian authorities (which isn't true).

Oh, and more lies. It clearly stated on their old page that they
wouldn't put that site or anything similar up again. Very sad that
cat haters are such liars.

I have read the whole site. Content? What content? There are a few
nasty pictures of dead cats and comments on why they don't like cats.
They are also rather derogatory when it comes to cat lovers.

But I have to say that there's no misinformation and they don't
describe how to kill cats - the two things that I asked them to take
down from their last site. Thanks for listening guys (I have to say
guys because, another trait of cat haters, they never put their name
to anything).

I think the only thing that is really bad about the site are the
pictures. Not sure if it's actually breaking any law though.

If you think they are you are free to complain again - of course this
time they've been clever enough (well, not clever exactly, you see
from what happened last time they learnt - and even dogs can learn)
not to give out their ISP, but you can still complain to the RSPCA of
Australia. Also I found an interesting web address in the book &quot;Net
Guide&quot; - a computer magazine. It is for the Australian Broadcasting
Authority and the content of all Australian based web pages comes
under their jurisdiction. So if you think that they are breaking some
kind of law you can complain to them at:

www.aba.gov.au/what/online/compaints.htm

As I said before I'm not really sure that there's anything *to*
complain about. I really think right now that they are best left to
their own sad little cat hating world.

Vicki,

If you are going to bag them out, be clever about it. I am absolutely

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> I read this and CHOSE not to pursue it by hitting the site. You had that
option but like most anti people, you just had to go and have a look &quot;for

By the way, what lies? I skimmed the site and found nothing unusual

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> There are no laws. If you want &quot;horrible&quot; go to  http://www.rotten.com ,
feral-cats is tame (lame) and i'm not sure why you looked. I finally had a
look because of your post and I wonder why you bothered. It reminds me of
kids looking at porn found under their big brothers bed....

"/> Oh Vicki, everyone leaves a trail.... but the question is. Where is the
server? If the server is OS then you can't touch them, even if they are
Australians. Sorry, but facts are facts. Many Aussie porn sites faced the
same problem from the anti porn equivalent of yourself, people who vocally
abhor porn but under the guise of the &quot;greater good&quot; continued to peruse the
sites non stop .. they simply packed up their porn and bought space on a US
server. Can't be touched.

They are cleverer than you give them credit for :-)

But I definately don't agree about UK bashing. Yes, I have a sense of

operate that way and, generally, people on this ng realise this I

&gt;&gt; You've got some good points in here, food for thought.........

&gt;&gt; Cars are just lumps of metal, glass, rubber and plastic for getting from
A
&gt;&gt; to B.

&gt; and cats are simply lumps of gooey stuff wrapped in a little fur coat,
&gt; what's your point?

So are your 2 cats. What's your point ?

&gt;&gt; If you don't want it damaged, don't drive it !

&gt; and if you don't want your cat euthenased, don't let it outside. BTW I
&gt; bought my car to drive, not for cats to troll over.

&gt;&gt;What about stonechips ?

&gt; It's got a carbra

What's one of those ? A massive perspex shield ?

&gt;&gt; Do you have AAA to shoot down any birds that come near too ?

AAA? Actually when a bird poops on my car (and I'm assuming that's what
&gt; you're referring to?) I simply wash it &amp; polish it .. no lasting damage.
&gt; Can't polish out cat scratches.

&gt;&gt; I've had a car
&gt;&gt; nigh on written off by a drunk driver. I was snug in bed. My car was
&gt; parked
&gt;&gt; in the street overnight. Guess who ended up paying because the police
&gt;&gt; couldn't catch the guy who did it due to overstrained resources ? It's
&gt; just
&gt;&gt; a lump of metal, so who really cares ? I don't.

&gt; Your insurance company? I got rearended by a young lad once, lots of
damage
&gt; but him &amp; his panelbeater dad took full responsiblity for the accident and
&gt; fixed my car up better than new .. so what's your point?

Yeah ! Right Bron........... Money really does grow on trees you
know..................... sigh....................... I take it HUBBY sorts
out all stuff financial in your house. There are such things as insurance
excess, and no claims bonus. In this case, it was a close run thing between
repair costs, and sum of excess, plus increased premiums over the next few
years due to lost no claims bonus. But because plod (the police) couldn't
get the drunk driver, I ended up paying. But who cares ?

&gt;&gt; I don't hate people who have different views. They are entitled to them.
&gt;&gt; However, I am a realist. When I feel people are not realistic, I tell
&gt; them.

&gt; Yes, we should all accept the superiority of cats and the imminent demise
of
&gt; our native wildlife.

Errrrrrrrrm lets say our ultimate demise shall we ? Until man started
fiddling with nature/changing the environment, this planet was doing fine by
itself. Whilst I feel there needs to be more data collected on environmental
issues, I remain convinced that we, the human race (yes ! I include myself,
but my g/f thinks I'm an alien), will ultimately ruin this planet, and
obviously our ecosystem. We must be careful to take the RIGHT actions.

&gt;&gt; Bron has 2 cats, or have you missed that ? The other issue is this : to
be
&gt; a
&gt;&gt; good neighbour, you have to be tolerant to a degree at least of your
&gt;&gt; neighbours needs too. What about kids playing in the street ? What about
&gt;&gt; people having parties, dogs barking, etc ? I agree with you on the
subject
&gt;&gt; of good neighbours - I am very lucky where I live. I hope it stays that
&gt; way.

&gt; Actually, all that is true and simply goes to prove my point. Cat owners
&gt; who let their cats outside are not good neighbours. I despise barking
dogs
&gt;&amp; loud parties but there is legislation to cover both in Australia.

&gt;&gt; As a point of reference, way back in the 17th century over here, we had
a
&gt;&gt; massive plague, just before the great fire of London. The cats were
&gt; actually
&gt;&gt; helping to keep the rats at bay, as is there predatory role, but they
were
&gt;&gt; our allies. The rats and their fleas were spreading the plague, not the
&gt;&gt; cats.

&gt; Now we don't need cats, we have doctors and medicine :-)

So why do we have them as pets ? As ornaments ? In which case, why do you
have them ? I have them because they are loving, I love them too, and they
are good fun.

&gt;&gt;And who did we end up persecuting, and why ? The cats, through
&gt;&gt; ignorance and fear. So I ask people to just for once be absolutely
certain
&gt;&gt; of the facts before they embark on programs of eradication.

&gt; The facts are well known &amp; continued to be studied by those with an
&gt; interest.

Reading between the lines : you have no valid references to cite ?

Dearest Bron,

how can something be 41% out ? Do you mean 59% made up ? In which case,
please explain for the rest of us how you came up with this figure, which
is, I suspect inaccurate to 10 significant figures (i.e. 100% bullshit) ?

&gt;&gt;Might I suggest that you have posted NOTHING based on facts except some

"/> it's not being a loser to accept that what's done is done. the past

pointless and counterproductive.

What on earth do you say to Germans and Japanese? The Japanese by our
lights treated hundreds of thousands of allied POWs appallingly, and a
great many died in their concentration and work camps. However Japanese
are now one of the largest groups of tourists in Australia. The people
visiting Australia (and the UK and US) are *not* the ones who killed,
tortured and maimed. Ditto Germany and the Jews. Millions were killed
in the concentration camps, but to carry on treating all Germans as if
they personally herded Jews into the gas chambers would be to start the
kind of blood feud which is still the curse of some parts of Europe.

way of doing it. In fact it is usually counter-productive. It's also
rather hopeful to suggest that Australia is a 'nice place' for it's
native animals. The sheep walks are not. Neither are the built-up
areas (of course some people will have gardens containing only native
plants appropriate to the bit of Australia they live in), the banana
plantations, the mines and so on. Not to mention Maralinga. But
bashing poms (or people from any other country) bashing will not help

&gt;&gt; operate that way and, generally, people on this ng realise this I
&gt;&gt; think. In fact I love the UK and really want to visit someday :))

&gt;:-) Well, I do have to admit that there are parts that interest me. Wales,
&gt;Scotland, Stonehenge ... but I think if you've photographed them once, thats
&gt;all you really need to remind yourself ... plenty of other countries to go.
&gt;I think i'd like to visit Canada, or perhaps Russia again ......

If you want to visit a country with fantastic scenery &amp; people, go
trekking in Nepal. They even like children!

&gt;&gt; ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR Bron - YOU have 2 cats. Do you hate them too ?

&gt;Oooops ... retract &amp; replace &quot;cats&quot; with &quot;outside cats&quot;. My apologies.

&gt;&gt; LEARN from your mistakes ? Ahem ! Time you started dealing with the real
&gt;&gt; issue - i.e. man. But as Surfer says, we have to get along. You really do
&gt;&gt; present such inconsistent arguments Bron, it's laughable. You lose
&gt;&gt; credibility at every turn.

&gt;Andy, there isn't much we can do about man except educate him. Cats and
&gt;other vermin are a problem we can address in a more positive way. Hopefully
&gt;when the irresponsible see how much better the ecosystem is doing without
&gt;the vermin, they may think twice about their attitude. But it might be a
&gt;moot point here if the legislation passes and cat owners are FORCED to leave
&gt;their cats indoors.

"/>&lt;snip&gt;

IMHO the biggest threat to ecosystems all over the world is currently
global warming, and the only species which has caused that is man. Not
cats - man. It will probably cause considerable damage to the Great
Barrier Reef as ocean levels rise, and also make more likely the kind of
storm which decimated the Sydney-Hobart race recently, killing several
competitors.

damage to a car I would simply have to live with that as their right to leap
about outweighs my right to drive. By the way, Kangaroo v car generally
leaves the kangaroo as the winner :-) I've never seen a Koala road pizza
although I understand that it does occur. By the way, the chances of a
Kangaroo or a Koala sitting on the bonnet of my car in my driveway is 0%.
The Kangaroos prefer to wait by the side of the highway until it is dusk and
you can't see them, then they bound along and (in my case) slam into the
side of your car, causing damage and the loss of a pair of underpants, only
to then bound away into the bushes again ;-) I sometimes wonder whether
it's a revenge attack :-)

the effect of turning people off to her message.

Thankfully, every single Australian I've come across in real life
(here in the UK) is not anything like Bron in her hatred and are
actually very warm, friendly people, rightfully proud of their country
but not xenophobes as she is - after all, Australia today is a melting
pot of people and cultures and has a lot it can teach many other
places about tolerance and working together. Like anywhere else, it
has problems, but I think the advantages definitely outweigh the
disadvantages.

I'd love to visit Australia, one day, but I hope I don't run into Bron

I suspect Bron works for the Australian tourist board !

Nice post Helen. You've said some things that really needed to be said.
Also, it's a relief to hear the sample of 1 is not representative of the

&gt;&gt; Some of the dead were Australians. So were some of the captains. How
&gt;&gt; heartless you are.

&gt; Heartless? Heartless? Like ALL Australians I sat glued to the TV,
&gt; horrified at what was going on, but you need to remember that the Captains
&gt; were FOREWARNED about the weather, and chose to go ahead. The first 2
&gt; yachts missed the weather, the ones behind it knew what the weather was
like
&gt; and chose NOT to warn the other boats (which is legal) and chose to sail
on.

&gt; Other Captains sailed into the weather without being warned about what
they
&gt; were sailing into.

&gt; I have immense sympathy for the families of the dead, but really feel that
&gt; if the first few Captains to hit that storm had been more responsible and
&gt; less &quot;tactical&quot; there would have been less dead. Many lives were put at
&gt; risk because of the race, it should have been called off when the BoM
first
&gt; put out the storm warning.

&gt; It's not heartless, it's a fact.

"/> What happened in the Yacht race was tragic. I do not dispute that. However,
weather forecasting is an inexact science. As a result, any forecast should
be taken with a pinch of salt. For example, where I live, NW 6 as a forecast
on a hot summers day usually means NW 6 until just before high tide, then ~
1 hour of light variable winds, followed by N-NE 2-3. If you don't know it's
going to happen, and you're a long way out in a dinghy, it's not nice, as
the outgoing current can run at ~ 4 knots. I believe the technical term is
'ringtwitcher'. Coming back to the race, the guys in the lead pressed on.
The guys just behind them got the rough weather, but probably just thought
'bit bumpy, but not too bad', until things were too late. I don't for a
minute accuse anyone of irresponsibility. Race organisers will not run a
race if they truly believe the conditions to be dangerous. Nor will crews be
negligent of warning others if they believe conditions are dangerous.
Sailing is an outdoor sport. We don't control the weather. Therefore we take
whatever gets thrown at us. We accept the inherent risk that the previous
statement implies. Any responsible sailor checks weather forecasts,
maintains their boat in good order, and has other contingency plans right
down to the gear you wear/flares you carry. Sometimes it all goes horribly
wrong, and lady luck is not on your side. Just the same as the rest of life.
However, you get a wide variation in perception of acceptable conditions.
For example, I was at the Laser nationals here in the UK one year. It blew
up force 7 offshore. The race was abandoned after several boats capsized and
broke masts, etc. I went for a brief sail as those are my best conditions
(force 5-7, as I am quite heavy !), while waiting for the queue of boats
trying to get ashore dissipated. The rescue boat came chasing after me and
told me to go back in. So you see, with the wide range of experience/ability
comes a variation in perspective; the guys in the lead were almost certainly
very skilled (why else would they be there ?), and did not consider the
conditions excessive or dangerous. Other examples of extreme weather :
Fastnet race in 1979 (I think it was that year), the storm in southern UK in
1987, tornadoes in US, etc........

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Industrial waste &amp; global warning are not the same issue, since
&gt;&gt; industrial waste does not directly correlate to the production of
&gt;&gt; greenhouse gases.

&gt; Are you saying that the white stuff that pumps out of those hugh towers
does
&gt; NOT contribute to global warming?

"/> Errrrrrrm Surfer is right here. It is entirely dependent on the industrial
process. Some produce solid waste. Some produce liquid waste. Some produce
gaseous waste Some produce varying combinations of all 3. If you're
referring to the plumes from cooling towers at power stations or industrial
sites, it's just condensing water vapour.

Hey Bron, I don't think you're being fair here. You guys did send a lot of
people to help us in WW2. We and the Americans also sent a lot of people
overseas to various theatres of the war. It was a case of 'needs must' at
the time. I will point out that this was only possible due to the presence
of several large liners available for troop transport duties.

Further to what you've said in other postings; I choose to comment here if
that's OK, the Americans did help us win the war. Did you know that the
Americans were helping us long before they 'officially' entered the war ? My
Father in law told me (he used to serve in the navy in WW2) of large numbers
of American sailors who were killed in this capacity on destroyers, etc,
escorting our convoys. These men never got recognition for their
service/bravery. But he recognised it and he told me of it.

Now onto Bletchley Park, which is what you're digging at. I don't recall all
the facts, but I seem to remember that the decision was taken on numerous
occasions not to reveal the knowledge of the Germans codes; the fact that
we'd broken the 'enigma', and incur the losses (i.e. men, etc) that this
entailed. I do not envy the people who had to make those decisions, nor will
I question their actions. I do however ask you to consider that WW2 was a
long drawn out war of attrition, and the information these people based
their decisions on was at best incomplete at times, if not guesswork.
However you cut it, it was a choice of the lesser of the evils. Ours is not
the place, nor is yours to question decisions made in the heat of war years
ago.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR Bron - YOU have 2 cats. Do you hate them too ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Oooops ... retract &amp; replace &quot;cats&quot; with &quot;outside cats&quot;. My apologies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LEARN from your mistakes ? Ahem ! Time you started dealing with the real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue - i.e. man. But as Surfer says, we have to get along. You really do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; present such inconsistent arguments Bron, it's laughable. You lose
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; credibility at every turn.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Andy, there isn't much we can do about man except educate him. Cats and
&gt;&gt;&gt;other vermin are a problem we can address in a more positive way. Hopefully
&gt;&gt;&gt;when the irresponsible see how much better the ecosystem is doing without
&gt;&gt;&gt;the vermin, they may think twice about their attitude. But it might be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;moot point here if the legislation passes and cat owners are FORCED to leave
&gt;&gt;&gt;their cats indoors.

&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;IMHO the biggest threat to ecosystems all over the world is currently
&gt;&gt;global warming, and the only species which has caused that is man.

&gt;Mmmm. Actually, at the age of 46, I'm old enough to remember when most
&gt;climatologist agreed we were fast heading towards another ice age.
&gt;True, climate is just at this moment in history warming up - but it is
&gt;not as warm as it was in Roman times, and there is evidence that we
&gt;are actually just coming out of a cool spell and things are really
&gt;just returning to normal.

"/> It still means goodbye to winter climbing in Scotland!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Not
&gt;&gt;cats - man. It will probably cause considerable damage to the Great
&gt;&gt;Barrier Reef as ocean levels rise, and also make more likely the kind of
&gt;&gt;storm which decimated the Sydney-Hobart race recently, killing several
&gt;&gt;competitors.

&gt;Actually, the present predicted rise in sea level does not endanger
&gt;the GBR, it just rises with it.

"/> So long as the coral can grow upwards as fast as the sea level rises?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;What is more worrying is the change in oceanic currents which may mean
&gt;that Britain will no longer be warmed by the golf stream.

horrified at what was going on, but you need to remember that the Captains
were FOREWARNED about the weather, and chose to go ahead. The first 2
yachts missed the weather, the ones behind it knew what the weather was like
and chose NOT to warn the other boats (which is legal) and chose to sail on.

Other Captains sailed into the weather without being warned about what they
were sailing into.

I have immense sympathy for the families of the dead, but really feel that
if the first few Captains to hit that storm had been more responsible and
less &quot;tactical&quot; there would have been less dead. Many lives were put at
risk because of the race, it should have been called off when the BoM first
put out the storm warning.

Australia sent a lot of troops, and in our present day meaning of

the committment given by the Australian troops in the name of freedom. In

&gt; occasions not to reveal the knowledge of the Germans codes; the fact that
&gt; we'd broken the 'enigma', and incur the losses (i.e. men, etc) that this
&gt; entailed. I do not envy the people who had to make those decisions, nor
will
&gt; I question their actions. I do however ask you to consider that WW2 was a
&gt; long drawn out war of attrition, and the information these people based
&gt; their decisions on was at best incomplete at times, if not guesswork.
&gt; However you cut it, it was a choice of the lesser of the evils. Ours is
not
&gt; the place, nor is yours to question decisions made in the heat of war
years
&gt; ago.

"/> It is documented that the decision was specifically made NOT to inform
America of the impending attack on Pearl Harbour specifically to draw them
into the war. It was NOT an issue of code breaking. A very risky maneouver
and tantamount to murder :-( In hindsight, the Japanese were to declare
war on America anyway, and the lives could have been saved. I do not think
that the families of those american sailors would share Churchill's (it was
Churchill wasn't it?) views on this issue. I certainly wouldn't have, but
then how many of your relatives lie buried in Turkish soil?

And no Andy, it's not really fair as there were many issues, but to type it
all out would be too long and too hard, needless to say my point of view is
shared by many in Australia and America. We (Australia) do not rely on
Britain for protection were someone to threaten us, we would rely on our
American neighbours, they have Pine Gap and various other establishments and
we maintain an excellent rapport with them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; What happened in the Yacht race was tragic. I do not dispute that.
However,
&gt; weather forecasting is an inexact science. As a result, any forecast
should
&gt; be taken with a pinch of salt. For example, where I live, NW 6 as a
forecast
&gt; on a hot summers day usually means NW 6 until just before high tide, then
~
&gt; 1 hour of light variable winds, followed by N-NE 2-3. If you don't know
it's
&gt; going to happen, and you're a long way out in a dinghy, it's not nice, as
&gt; the outgoing current can run at ~ 4 knots. I believe the technical term is
&gt; 'ringtwitcher'.

"/> maybe so. However when someone forecasts gale force winds and whatever
metre waves (10?) you should seriously consider your options with regards to
sailing on the ocean. If you are sailing and come up against this weather
you have a moral responsibility to warn others, the leading boats did NOT do
that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Coming back to the race, the guys in the lead pressed on.

"/> Bridabella and Kookaburra? didn't get the bad weather, they skimmed past
it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The guys just behind them got the rough weather, but probably just thought
&gt; 'bit bumpy, but not too bad', until things were too late.

"/> That information is contrary to the information presented at the inquest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't for a
&gt; minute accuse anyone of irresponsibility.

"/> I understand that the coroner did, and he is in a far better position than
you to judge. Were you getting the 15 minute updates that we were getting
as the drama enfolded, the rescue was run from here in Canberra as are all
sea recues.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Race organisers will not run a
&gt; race if they truly believe the conditions to be dangerous.

"/> This is contrary to the comments made by the coroner (from what I remember).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nor will crews be
&gt; negligent of warning others if they believe conditions are dangerous.

"/> They admitted that they did not forwarn the other sailors, it's in their
tactical best interests not to do so. It wasn't until people started dying
that the gravity of the situation was uncovered. That, in my opinion, is
too late.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sailing is an outdoor sport. We don't control the weather. Therefore we
take
&gt; whatever gets thrown at us. We accept the inherent risk that the previous
&gt; statement implies.

"/> Therefore you cannot point the finger at me when I am less than sympathetic
for the sailers putting the lives of a multitude of other sailers, rescue
personnel. The whole thing was a debacle and for quite a while there was
talk of criminal charges being laid against the race organisers and the lead
captains (the ones who knew about the storm but did not warn the others).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Any responsible sailor checks weather forecasts,
&gt; maintains their boat in good order, and has other contingency plans right
&gt; down to the gear you wear/flares you carry. Sometimes it all goes horribly
&gt; wrong, and lady luck is not on your side. Just the same as the rest of

"/> life.

Yes, and other times the desire to race means that other factors are
ignored. Sailors ADMITTED that at the time. The BoM DID indeed issue a
weather warning, it was ignored.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, you get a wide variation in perception of acceptable conditions.
&gt; For example, I was at the Laser nationals here in the UK one year. It blew
&gt; up force 7 offshore. The race was abandoned after several boats capsized
and
&gt; broke masts, etc. I went for a brief sail as those are my best conditions
&gt; (force 5-7, as I am quite heavy !), while waiting for the queue of boats
&gt; trying to get ashore dissipated. The rescue boat came chasing after me and
&gt; told me to go back in. So you see, with the wide range of
experience/ability
&gt; comes a variation in perspective; the guys in the lead were almost
certainly
&gt; very skilled (why else would they be there ?), and did not consider the
&gt; conditions excessive or dangerous. Other examples of extreme weather :
&gt; Fastnet race in 1979 (I think it was that year), the storm in southern UK
in
&gt; 1987, tornadoes in US, etc........

"/> Then they made a tragic error in judgement that cost the lives of their
crewmen, and in at least one case their captain. I also understand that one
boat zipped past another who had issued a mayday without stopping and
assisting, certainly strikes me as the thing to do in the circumstance
(not).

And whilst we are on sailing, what about that idiot woman who got into
trouble below Australia, costing us millions (5 million wasn't it?) to
rescue her, international agreements say we cannot recoup that loss and then
the bitch went and did it again. Sorry, but I say once fair enough, twice
she's idiot and Australia has far better things to do with it's money than
continue to save the same idiot time and time again.

Yes, I know that's not very sympathetic, but $5 million dollars would go a
long way towards reconcilliation or resolving domestic violence or any
number of other, more legitimate requirements.

&gt; Errrrrrrm Surfer is right here. It is entirely dependent on the industrial

&gt;&gt;You want cats out because you see them as not native (even after

&gt;&gt; well.

&gt;I certainly didn't say that. You cannot compare man to cats so whilst you
&gt;may be right, and certainly a small percentage of indigineous australians
&gt;believe so, but you cannot remove an Australian from Australia. Regardless

Clear. If the Aboriginal people want cats out as well then that will
be up to them.

Your problem is that you think there is a difference between a non

purred the following:

:)Of course there is always the odd psycho who gets hold of a gun, but
:)it is rare and it is very hard to get a licence to have a gun in the
:)UK.

Firstly let me say I *hate* guns. My sister was accidently shot on a
property a few years back (someone hadn't checked whether the gun was
loaded before starting to clean it) and so personally I'd like to see
them all banned.

But ...

Recently figures released here in Queensland showed that the number of
gun deaths (per year) had dropped significanlty since the introduction
of new gun laws following the Port Arthur Massacre. Unfortunately,
the total number of deaths remained almost exactly the same.

So it just shows that while less people are dying at the hands of
guns, they are still dying! So murderers aren't not killing, they are
just using different methods.

So I don't believe tougher gun laws actually means a safer place to
be.

"/> I'm not disputing that Vicki. If you read some of my other posts, you will
see my concerns for the environment are just as real as yours. But as I've
said before in other posts to this ng, we must be sure the right course of
action is taken. Reading between what both you and Bron say on here, my
impression is that it is easier for you Australians to tackle something that
really can't fight back - yes the cat - rather than tackle some of the more
awkward issues, drugs, for example as Brons post seems to suggest is rife
(syringes - what else ?).

So you see, my 'harsh' response to Bron, really is a dig at the ever
changing field on which she choses to play. I for one am sick of it. I am
sick of her poor grasp of reality. I am sick of idealistic bullshit,
especially when it is founded in soft mud.

Brons solution to lifes problems is akin to a SWAT team getting a callout to
a bank robbery, and rather than go there, they just shoot ten people dead in
the street - people who are just bystanders. Time she grew up, and learnt to
think things through.

the following:

:)I'm not disputing that Vicki. If you read some of my other posts, you will
:)see my concerns for the environment are just as real as yours. But as I've
:)said before in other posts to this ng, we must be sure the right course of
:)action is taken. Reading between what both you and Bron say on here, my
:)impression is that it is easier for you Australians to tackle something that
:)really can't fight back - yes the cat - rather than tackle some of the more
:)awkward issues, drugs, for example as Brons post seems to suggest is rife
:)(syringes - what else ?).

I know lots of people on here are accused of being each other, but
Bron and I aren't the same either :)

I've worked with community organisations. And some drug addicts. It
is a terrible problem here in Australia (and I don't think we're
unique in that but I do believe that it's a bigger problem here than
in the UK). I recycle. I try to conserve energy. I support captive
breeding programmes for endangered species. I think DNA research to
enable the Tasmanian Tiger to perhaps be brought back to life is
fantastic. There are many things that I do other than keeping my cats
in that also contribute to making the environment better.

But keeping my cats indoors is doing something on a very personal,
basic level.. I think I told the story of recently when I was looking
out my (large glass) back door and wondering whether all of you are
really right. Should I let my kitties out? (See you are all invading
my time *away* from the computer now :) Then I noticed in one of my
(not yet so large) native trees in the back garden a whole extended
family of native finches (at least I think that's what they were -
very tiny and very pretty to say the least). It was then that I
realised that I was probably saving those 12 or so lives by keeping my
cats indoors. The same day I saw a small frill necked Lizard in my
front garden. Considering that they can't hear so bells don't stop
them being caught and in my younger foolish days when my first cat did
go out she used to bring in lizards about 18 inches long, I knew that
he would definately be a gonner if I let my babies out.

This of course, is besides the miriad of other arguments for not
letting my cats out - including their safety and my responsibility not
to annoy the neighbours with my pets.

I know Bron can get a little overheated at times. I think we almost
all do. But her genuine concern for the Aussie environment is a view
shared by many, many Australians now and more so every day. The laws
are changing to reflect this too and it's something we have to accept,
and as cat lover move on.

"/> Again, why? In the UK dogs are expected to be kept under control by
their owner. They are not meant to be left to room the streets with no
owner around, so if they cause an accident the owner is clearly not
keeping control of them. If a farmer finds a dog worrying sheep they
can shoot that dog, again for the same reason.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Actually here if you swerve to avoid a pet and have an

&gt;effectively destroys the front of the car). And yes, I know this for a
&gt;fact.

&gt;&gt; Here, legally, it's up to me to humanely keep cats
&gt;&gt; out of my garden if I don't want them there, it's not up to the cats'

&gt;Jeeezus .... oh well, what are the laws on discharging a fire arm in public?

"/> Depends on why &amp; where. Any discharge at people is clearly illegal
(unless a plea self-defence is accepted in court), and shooting pets
would also land you in trouble. However it's OK to hunt game (deer and
birds) during the correct season and farmers are allowed to shot some
species classified as vermin - pigeons for example.

However shooting cats with water pistols is just fine! (so long as you
only use water in them, not something noxious).

&gt;&gt; I certainly don't think atrocities were the sole preserve of Germans &amp;
&gt;&gt; Japanese (or Australians). I was looking for examples which involved
&gt;&gt; nations other than the UK.

&gt;But you used an example that does involve the UK.

&gt;&gt; They also killed many Jews, but something like 1,000 years ago. Get
&gt;&gt; back to the point. Many Australians were killed &amp; tortured by the
&gt;&gt; Japanese in WW2. Does that mean you are as unpleasant to them as you
&gt;&gt; are to the British?

&gt;You have an unnatural focus on the Japanese, why is that? Have they not
&gt;been punished enough for their crimes? Look at what happened to them after
&gt;the war whilst England skited about how good they were (because the
&gt;Americans won the war for them).

"/> Why can you forgive one nation and not another? I'm starting to think
of you as a racist. A cynic would suggest it's because the Japanese are
possibly quite important to the Australian economy - I gather they form
the largest group of tourists to Australia, and probably spend plenty of
money while they are there.

It seems you think it your job to punish the British for their crimes,
as you see them. You also seem to be forgetting that if we judge what
people were doing 50 or 100 years ago by today's standards there is then
not a nation in the world in which heinous crimes were not committed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; That discussion is only happening because you persist in blaming Britain
&gt;&gt; for everything in Australia's past you don't like. And in a quite rude
&gt;&gt; manner.

&gt;That's the bit you see, ignoring the rest. Shows you how sensitive you are
&gt;to how people feel about you and how insensitive you are to the ecological
&gt;problems around you.

"/> Or insensitive to *your* view of the ecological problems around you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Now what about global warming? That seems to have vanished off the
&gt;&gt; bottom. What are you personally doing about it to protect your beloved
&gt;&gt; Australia? After all, you have one of the natural wonders of the world
&gt;&gt; (Barrier Reef) which is very vulnerable to it.

&gt;And what do YOU do?

"/> Turn down the heating. Not take the car when I can walk. Turn of
lights in rooms I'm not using. Turn the TV off instead of leave it on
standby. Use low-energy light bulbs. Showers not baths. Use a
microwave to reheat food. Insulate the house. Abhor air conditioning.
Work at home quite often (no need to drive to work then). Use public
transport where possible. In short lots of things which add up to
saving energy, which is what the whole developed world has to do. When
the time comes to buy a new fridge I will look for an energy-efficient
one, and also get the old one correctly disposed of so the CFCs (which I
presume it has in it's cooling system) don't end up in the atmosphere.

I also tend to stick to 'in season' food and buy most of my meat in
local butchers. Things like strawberries and asparagus are available
most of the year in the supermarkets, but they are air-freighted which
not good (except for air-freight companies). They are also not a patch
on fresh-picked in-season food.

&gt;&gt; Some of the dead were Australians. So were some of the captains. How
&gt;&gt; heartless you are.

&gt;Heartless? Heartless? Like ALL Australians I sat glued to the TV,
&gt;horrified at what was going on, but you need to remember that
&gt;the Captains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;were FOREWARNED

"/> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; about the weather, and chose to go ahead. The first 2
&gt;yachts missed the weather,
&gt; the ones behind it knew what the weather was like
&gt;and chose NOT to warn the other boats (which is legal) and chose to sail on.

&gt;Other Captains sailed into the weather without being warned

"/>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Not quite sure how to reconcile the two. Unless the first one should
read 'some captains were forewarned'. Who (in your view) did the
warning? How was it done? Yacht racing these days is a very close-
fought business, and all top crews (including Australians I expect,
since some of the top crews are Australians) will have their own
meteorologists. They will not share their information as they are
seeking to gain tactical advantage. However was this storm forecast on
the TV? On radio? In the newspapers? On the Internet? These are all
freely available sources of information. BoM - something like Board of
Meteorology presumably, and publicly available. In which case I think
it's hard to suggest that some captains did not know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; about what they
&gt;were sailing into.

&gt;I have immense sympathy for the families of the dead, but really feel that
&gt;if the first few Captains to hit that storm had been more responsible and
&gt;less &quot;tactical&quot; there would have been less dead. Many lives were put at
&gt;risk because of the race, it should have been called off when the BoM first
&gt;put out the storm warning.

"/> However the race committee choose not to do so. The IYRU rules make it
quite clear that the onus of deciding whether or not to compete (or
continue to compete) is on each vessel, not on the race committee.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;It's not heartless, it's a fact.

&gt;&gt; Industrial waste &amp; global warning are not the same issue, since
&gt;&gt; industrial waste does not directly correlate to the production of
&gt;&gt; greenhouse gases.

&gt;Are you saying that the white stuff that pumps out of those hugh towers does
&gt;NOT contribute to global warming?

"/> The white stuff is water vapour which does *not* contribute to global
warming. Since it's water vapour it's also not industrial waste.

we did mine it for YOUR use, the aboriginals are trying to get that land

:-) Lets revisit this. Australia doesn't own nuclear weapons nor have we
discharged any. When Britian discharged theirs it was on our soil, on land
that was historically used by the indigineous populations and they didn't
even bother to warn them, apart from a few signs written in English.
These Aborigines got ill, they died ... and you sit there and make nuclear
jokes at me? Hmmm.... when does britain plan to compensate those
Australians for the illness, death and the loss of their land?

&gt; Firstly let me say I *hate* guns. My sister was accidently shot on a
&gt; property a few years back (someone hadn't checked whether the gun was
&gt; loaded before starting to clean it) and so personally I'd like to see
&gt; them all banned.

penis extensions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Recently figures released here in Queensland showed that the number of
&gt; gun deaths (per year) had dropped significanlty since the introduction

"/> However that figure is quite low.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I am not going to get into a long involved Aboriginal rights debate
here, but you have *no* idea of how Aborigines are treated until you
have lived in this country. There are a few, very vocal, Aborigines
who complain long and hard about their lot in life, while most realise
that they are treated *better* than white people. They get more in
welfare, assistance, everything. Whenever you fill out a form in this
country you have to specify if you are of Aboriginal descent. If
that's not racism I don't know what is. And before you call *me*
racist, I am not. I know and am friends with Aborigines and most are
great people. There are just a few that make it difficult for
everybody.

"/> Doh... hate it when that happens. *I* know what I was trying to say... let
me try again.

The bureau of meterology issued a severe storm warning. The captains should
have been forewarned and in reality, the race should have been called off.
However, as you say, the BoM isn't always accurate, and the race went ahead.
Brindabella and Kookaburra? missed the bad weather and sailed on ok. Behind
them were a number of &quot;just behind the lead&quot; boats. They encountered
extreme weather conditions that put them and their boats at risk. At that
stage, they (knowing the weather conditions) failed to warn the boats behind
them.

Is that clearer?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; meteorologists. They will not share their information as they are

"/> This was discussed as the reason for not putting out warnings, and the
coroner was quite scathing about that, considering the extreme weather
conditions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However was this storm forecast on
&gt; the TV? On radio? In the newspapers? On the Internet? These are all
&gt; freely available sources of information. BoM - something like Board of
&gt; Meteorology presumably, and publicly available. In which case I think
&gt; it's hard to suggest that some captains did not know.

"/> Bureau of Meteorology issued the extreme weather warnings to the Sydney
Yacht Club and anyone else who wanted to be interested. I assume that ALL
participants were given this information. It is my understanding that the
SYC ignored the warnings, I assume now that they think as you do about the
Weather reports.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; However the race committee choose not to do so. The IYRU rules make it
&gt; quite clear that the onus of deciding whether or not to compete (or
&gt; continue to compete) is on each vessel, not on the race committee.

you can't legislate against stupidity.

Bron, your mouth IS your butt. So instead of discharging raw sewage onto
here all the time, why don't you do your bit for the environment ? Treat the
sewage before discharging it. Oh, but the treatment process will remove ALL
traces of what you say. Deary me, what will we do ? Have a party perhaps ?

Time to unsubscribe this ng, and find one without you on it. I am tired of
your bullshit. You are so lost in your own sea of contradiction, racism,
bitterness, misunderstanding, ignorance, arogance and hypocrisy......it's
sad. You claim to be modern, but in fact you are a dinosaur. Perhaps it is
you that should be extinct ?

We all get fed up with stuff in our lives; shit happens. To me it seems that
you are fed up with everything, and seek to alleviate this feeling by hating
everyone who does not measure up to your values. As you have said, this
starts with your neighbours, and your hatred seems to spread from there. You
claim to be one who supports others having their own opinions. I only see
you doing this as long as they don't clash with yours. I pity you if your
life is this pathetic and shallow.

Stuff has happened in the past. History books are full of it. It is the
petty vindictivness of certain people today that maintains some of the
worlds troublespots. And on what basis ? Oh yeah, it happened a couple of
generations ago, so and so did this........ So lets just get this straight
for the record : the people who did that stuff are DEAD. They are GONE. What
has happened is HISTORY. NOTHING can go back and change this. So for the
sake of MANKIND, and this PLANET, we must learn from history, and put it
BEHIND us. UNDERSTANDING is the order of today. Todays generation is NOT
responsible for the past. Believe me, there are way too many problems that
will rise in the next 40 years or so. This is our FUTURE. It is not set. To
a degree, we can do something to steer that future. There are also many
factors outside our control. Only time will tell; who knows how it will all
pan out ?

I make no dispute about the fact that we all need to do our bit. But we must
do the right things. The stuff you want done, legislation on cats, etc. will
achieve little. This will not be through lack of effort, but because you are
not tackling the real issues. The real issue is man.

So Bron, please try and see some sense.

now history. Bob and yourself even go so far as to point out the aboriginal
suffering. Yes some of them continue to suffer, and yes we need to find a
way to resolve that. But to wipe your hands of your responsibility simply

species which I think is a great idea also. There are many different
groups with different agendas here, and I support ALL of the ones that
support the ecosystem. The fact that the focus at the moment is on cats is
simply because this was a cat discussion. If it were a dog discussion, i'd

&gt;&gt; Why can you forgive one nation and not another?

&gt;Huh? The Japanese apologised for their crimes, they suffered for their
&gt;mistakes and continue to do so. Should we continue to punish them when they
&gt;were so willing to take responsibility for their actions? Granted some will
&gt;continue to do so as memories are long and the actions of the Japanese at
&gt;times was extremely brutal, but I think if a country is willing to take
&gt;responsibilites for their actions then that's a good thing. Why do you have
&gt;a problem with the difference between someone seeking forgiveness and
&gt;someone who simply doesn't care what others think?

"/> So what you want is for British people alive now, who in many cases are
immigrants or the children of recent immigrants, to seek forgiveness for
what they didn't do and might well not approve of.

Britain, like Australia, is a land of immigrants. What is 'being
British' or 'being Australian'? The only satisfactory answer is that is
either being born here, or choosing to live and work here. Presumably
these are the same things which make people Australian. It can't be
anything to do with ethnic origin as otherwise both countries would have
a tiny population of true Aussies or Brits, and a vast sea of 'temporary
inhabitants'.

How can I apologise for anything except that which is in *my* control?
In other words for my own actions, and (if I had children) their actions
while they are young enough not to be able to know right &amp; wrong
themselves. I can't apologise for the actions of the people (not my
ancestors as it happens) who originally settled Australia, took land
from the Aboriginals, caused many of the to die by either direct action
or introduced disease, and who took foreign species to Australia such as
sheep, cattle, camels, rabbits, rats, mice and yes! cats! None of the
'whining poms' in this thread were there AFAIK!

IMHO it would be meaningless, just as if I asked today's Germans to
apologise for the actions of those who shot and tortured some of my
ancestors. What I do ask is that the Germans ensure it never happens
again. The only people I have an issue with over this is the people who
claim that the holocaust never happened, or those who attempt to defend
it.

The British as colonialists did do terrible things which can't be
defended, as did the Dutch, Spanish &amp; Portuguese colonialists. However
I feel can no more apologise for the British than I can for the Dutch.

I mentioned in another post that the Japanese have not apologised for
their actions during the war. Soon there will be none of that
generation of Japanese left alive, and come to that none of their
victims. Age will have claimed them all. However it's not only the
PoWs (not all British) who are furious because those left alive refuse
to apologise, but also the 'comfort women' of various nationalities.
The PoWs often have warm relations with individual Japanese, including
(in some cases) their former prison guards. Presumably these relations
are based on apology and forgiveness. Their argument is with the
Japanese government.

&gt;&gt; I am not going to get into a long involved Aboriginal rights debate
&gt;&gt; here, but you have *no* idea of how Aborigines are treated until you
&gt;&gt; have lived in this country. There are a few, very vocal, Aborigines
&gt;&gt; who complain long and hard about their lot in life, while most realise
&gt;&gt; that they are treated *better* than white people. They get more in
&gt;&gt; welfare, assistance, everything.

"/> Poorer people would get more welfare etc. Are you saying they are
getting more than white people of a similar economic status?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Whenever you fill out a form in this
&gt;&gt; country you have to specify if you are of Aboriginal descent. If
&gt;&gt; that's not racism I don't know what is.

"/> In the UK such forms have lots of boxes as we have lots of different
ethnic groups. I saw a housing application form for a large council and
they had about 20 different boxes. It was also available in several
Asian languages. However there is always one where you can withhold the
information if you so wish.

If there is no information on where different ethnic groups live, what
they earn, how long they live, what universities and professions bodies
they gain entry to and so on how can any country have the information to
know if they, as a country, have casual or institutional racism? How,
for example, can a council know if they are putting all the afro-
caribeans into the sink estates? And so on. Guessing isn't good enough
as it will be influenced by the prevailing culture of the times. In the
UK newspapers and magazines have talked about the 'post feminist' era.
Now since women still earn much less (per hour or any other way you care
to measure it) than men, how valid is that claim? But if we don't
record the information the statistics won't be there.

At the moment IMHO the evidence is that Britain is still a sexist and
racist society. It would not surprise me if Australia was as well.
Aboriginals are certainly not living as long as white Australians (ABS
figures), and since in the UK and other countries life expectancy is
quite strongly associated with income &amp; education, they are probably
much poorer and less well educated as well, in general. I'm not in
favour of quotas and so on. However if woman has to be much better than
a man to get a job, or a non-white than a white, then that country is
sexist or racist.

Sexism &amp; racism don't have to be the nasty thuggish behaviour that
springs to mind. Outwardly everything can be very polite, very kind
etc. but while women &amp; blacks still have to get better degrees etc. than
white men to get the same job, or to be paid the same as a white man,
they exist.

Other forms of racism are using stereotypes. Such as 'thick Irish'
which in fact the Irish are a very well educated nation which is
currently one of the most dynamic in Europe. The best comment on that
was Dave Allan's. He is Irish and a comedian (very funny IMHO) and once
asked on his TV show 'what is black &amp; blue &amp; floats in the Irish Sea'.
The answer was 'an Englishman who makes Irish jokes'. Another racist
stereotype, dare I suggest it, is 'whining poms'. There is one here for
Australians. They are all called Bruce or Sheila, and a stereo-typical
chat-up line is 'Do ya fuck?' The answer is either 'only for a cool-
talking b*st*ard like you' or 'baaaaa' (think sheep). Now I'm sure
that's not true!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And before you call *me*
&gt;&gt; racist, I am not. I know and am friends with Aborigines and most are
&gt;&gt; great people. There are just a few that make it difficult for
&gt;&gt; everybody.

"/> Sadly the fact that some white people are friends with black people
doesn't mean there is no racism in a country.

Of course I don't know Vicki and am NOT trying to say she is a racist.
I have no idea but prefer to think that she isn't.

Most men count women amongst their friends - but sexism is not dead yet,
is it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;:-) Hmmm... well said. And not only do they need to visit here, but they
&gt;need to visit outback Australia, not just the cities.

"/> Nobody *needs* to visit Australia any more than they *need* to visit the
UK, or any other country. I have an acquaintance who was in the Navy
(Merchant, Royal &amp; Merchant again). He has been to many countries and
it hasn't made him a better person in any way. Or if it has he was
totally beyond the pale in the first place, which seems unlikely.

:)&gt;&gt; I am not going to get into a long involved Aboriginal rights debate
:)&gt;&gt; here, but you have *no* idea of how Aborigines are treated until you
:)&gt;&gt; have lived in this country. There are a few, very vocal, Aborigines
:)&gt;&gt; who complain long and hard about their lot in life, while most realise
:)&gt;&gt; that they are treated *better* than white people. They get more in
:)&gt;&gt; welfare, assistance, everything.
:)
:)Poorer people would get more welfare etc. Are you saying they are
:)getting more than white people of a similar economic status?

Absoluetely that's what I am saying! Welfare benefits for Aborigines
are higher than any other group (not just whites) for almost every
type of payment. One example is AUSTUDY, the benefit paid to
students. The Aboriginal equivalent is ABSTUDY and is approximately
*three times* what someone receives on AUSTUDY - same circumstances,
same courses.

:)&gt;:-) Hmmm... well said. And not only do they need to visit here, but they
:)&gt;need to visit outback Australia, not just the cities.
:)
:)Nobody *needs* to visit Australia any more than they *need* to visit the
:)UK, or any other country. I have an acquaintance who was in the Navy
:)(Merchant, Royal &amp; Merchant again). He has been to many countries and
:)it hasn't made him a better person in any way. Or if it has he was
:)totally beyond the pale in the first place, which seems unlikely.

No but basing your ideas on Aborigines soley on what you learnt on the
internet during a five minute search is not the way to go. You cannot
become an expert on *anything* through the internet. And, trust me,
you *cannot* understand what *some* Aborigines really are like here in
Australia unless you have *lived* here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;:-) How arrogant. You weren't &quot;saving the world&quot;, nor do you have the
&gt;capacity to do so. But that was quite funny :-) Britain never once tried
&gt;to &quot;save&quot; Australia (Papua New Guinnea, East Timor) etc.

"/> You seem to have this difficulty with your own history dear. Australia
was not under threat until April 1942 following the fall of the
Philippines, so until then Australian troops went to the European
theater of war. That effectively stopped in May 1942. By the end of
January 1943 a joint forces operation including Australia, New
Zealand, Canada and of course the USA was mounted to capture the
southeaster tip of New Guinea from Japanese troops, to protect
Australia from a Japanese invasion.

So, in less than 9 months Allied forces (and remember that even though
there may not have been British troops on that mission, we were one of
the leaders of the Allies) had removed the threat of invasion from
Australia - if indeed one really existed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; None, we have not been asked to provide troops for a UN force.

&gt;None, you were not asked because your help was not required.

"/> In that area you are correct, but where ever we have been called upon
we have responded. In the Gulf and Yugoslavia in particular, but in
many other places as well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Many.

&gt;Pah!

&gt;&gt; Oh yes they are, there was a very large group in Aldershot the last
&gt;&gt; time I was over there (little earlier than this last year) doing a
&gt;&gt; course on anti-tank warfare.

&gt;A FEW of our OFFICERS go over to britain and many other countries to study

"/> Untrue, until we started withdrawing troops from Germany Australian
troops were often involved in exercises there.

&gt;for the harbour facilities. Each time a US ship comes into harbour it makes

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Only got your call up last week then :)

&gt;&gt; Seriously, most of the free world comes to the UK for training,
&gt;&gt; because we are so good at it. If it was not for our training we would
&gt;&gt; not be able to keep quite such a large army on the go.

&gt;How arrogant. We do not consider britain to be &quot;so good at it&quot;, Australia
&gt;utilises the skills of the Americans because they are &quot;so good at it&quot;. In
&gt;war games, the Australian soldiers generally win. Our pilots outfly the
&gt;Americans and our Adgies outfight them. However, that being said, our armed
&gt;forces are smaller than the new york police force.

:)Bron says that she is Australian because she was born and raised there

Yes, I am seventh generation Australian - but that doesn't make white

:)Although, you do raise the interesting point of how long is long
:)enough for an animal to be classed as native. In the UK we have

:)now. And the British were the master collectors when it came to plants
:)in the 17/18/19 hundreds.
:)
:)Where do you draw the line, when does an animal become native?

This is a good point and I don't know. But an animal that's been
around almost 2000 years would be considered pretty native.

Perhaps the indicator we should be looking at is whether the animal
has fitted into the ecology in such a way that they aren't damaging
any other species. Once an animal does that then they could be
considered native.

&gt; In the UK such forms have lots of boxes as we have lots of different

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If there is no information on where different ethnic groups live, what

&gt; for example, can a council know if they are putting all the afro-
&gt; caribeans into the sink estates? And so on. Guessing isn't good enough
&gt; as it will be influenced by the prevailing culture of the times. In the
&gt; UK newspapers and magazines have talked about the 'post feminist' era.
&gt; Now since women still earn much less (per hour or any other way you care
&gt; to measure it) than men, how valid is that claim? But if we don't
&gt; record the information the statistics won't be there.

"/> We have Census for that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; At the moment IMHO the evidence is that Britain is still a sexist and
&gt; racist society. It would not surprise me if Australia was as well.

"/> All countries are, because not only does racism exist, there is also the
reverse of racism which is, in my view, also racism. However, Australia has
very strong laws against racist &amp; sexist behaviour and if racism is anything
like sexual discrimination then I would have to say as a female in a male
oriented work environment, it is not as widespread as we are lead to
believe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Aboriginals are certainly not living as long as white Australians (ABS
&gt; figures),

"/> But then, how many white Australians choose to live out in the outback, away
from medical facilities and so on? Have you also gone on to study the life
expectancy of our Asian, european etc immigrants? Do the ABS figures also
include geographic location, compare it to the medical facilities available
or does it take into account living conditions etc? Statistics tell us
nothing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and since in the UK and other countries life expectancy is
&gt; quite strongly associated with income &amp; education, they are probably
&gt; much poorer and less well educated as well, in general.

"/> I agree with you there, however be aware that social security payments and
free education are available to all. If they choose not to utilise the free
education system, then who's fault is that? If we are to honour their
customs and beliefs we cannot force them into our schools system (or our
&quot;society&quot; as such), they are invited and are allowed to choose. There are
certainly a fair number of well educated Aboriginal Australians working and
succeeding within society.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm not in
&gt; favour of quotas and so on. However if woman has to be much better than
&gt; a man to get a job, or a non-white than a white, then that country is
&gt; sexist or racist.

"/> Actually, right now it works the other way. If a woman/aboriginal misses
out on a job, they can claim discrimination. A white man cannot do so. In
Canberra I have not seen this sexism/racism in the work force and have
certainly seen jobs open to only Aboriginal applicants. Mind you, it is
against the law to advertise for men only or white people only, but you can
advertise legally for women only or aboriginal only.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sexism &amp; racism don't have to be the nasty thuggish behaviour that
&gt; springs to mind. Outwardly everything can be very polite, very kind
&gt; etc. but while women &amp; blacks still have to get better degrees etc. than
&gt; white men to get the same job, or to be paid the same as a white man,
&gt; they exist.

"/> You really need to put more study into the issue. It's about society, some
aboriginals choose to live within society as we understand it, others choose
not to, others still choose to live outside society within society, and
that's where some of the problems seem to occur. Certainly, it is against
the law to discriminate on basis of race. You need to remember too, that
there are a huge number of non aboriginal, non white Australians as well,
many of whom cry racism constantly. It seems an issue you can't win.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Other forms of racism are using stereotypes. Such as 'thick Irish'
&gt; which in fact the Irish are a very well educated nation which is
&gt; currently one of the most dynamic in Europe. The best comment on that
&gt; was Dave Allan's. He is Irish and a comedian (very funny IMHO) and once
&gt; asked on his TV show 'what is black &amp; blue &amp; floats in the Irish Sea'.
&gt; The answer was 'an Englishman who makes Irish jokes'. Another racist
&gt; stereotype, dare I suggest it, is 'whining poms'. There is one here for
&gt; Australians. They are all called Bruce or Sheila, and a stereo-typical
&gt; chat-up line is 'Do ya fuck?' The answer is either 'only for a cool-
&gt; talking b*st*ard like you' or 'baaaaa' (think sheep). Now I'm sure
&gt; that's not true!

"/> Not true, but amusing enough. It's a matter of perception. In Australia a
friend may walk up and say &quot;How are you going you fat old bastard&quot; and
that's not an insult, the sheep shagging is what our over the Tasman friends
do. The problem here is that immigrants (and poms) cannot accept our sense
of humour and run of screaming &quot;racism&quot; whereas we are just being ourselves,
and we have had to modify our behaviour to suit these whiners. Hence,
Australia as I know it, no longer exists and people are screeching 'racism'
all the time. Then a downhill spiral occurs where we feel we can't be
ourselves so we don't socialise with people we might offend, that they
causes an invisible wall which is interpreted as racism. It's all pretty
sad, but it's a fact of life.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sadly the fact that some white people are friends with black people
&gt; doesn't mean there is no racism in a country.

"/> Of course there is racism, just as you have racism and EVERY other country
in the world has racism, but it's being addressed (as in most countries).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Of course I don't know Vicki and am NOT trying to say she is a racist.

so she must be, mustn't she?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Most men count women amongst their friends - but sexism is not dead yet,
&gt; is it?

"/> No, but it is certainly being overaddressed here in Australia.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nobody *needs* to visit Australia any more than they *need* to visit the

&gt; it hasn't made him a better person in any way. Or if it has he was

2nd May 1945: London, Tues: When advancing American forces captured a
concentration camp yesterday they found 50 railway trucks crammed with the
bodies of victims of Nazi atrocities. Forty two thousand prisoners were
liberated. The concentration camp was replete with gas chamber, whipping
posts and crematorium. The hundred SS troops guarded the prisoners who were
found in an emanciated condition. British Forces also liberated 20,000
prisoners, including 8000 policical prisoners at a concentration camp
between Bremen and Hamburg. Disease was rampant at the camp and men and
women were dying hourly from starvation.

Given the size of the atrocity, I don't understand why the government in
britain refused to give credence to the information being brought out of

&gt; Absoluetely that's what I am saying! Welfare benefits for Aborigines

marriage married an aboriginal lady with kids and her kids got heaps more
financial assistance than his kids did. He made a big complaint about it

&gt;This is a good point and I don't know. But an animal that's been
&gt;around almost 2000 years would be considered pretty native.

&gt;Perhaps the indicator we should be looking at is whether the animal
&gt;has fitted into the ecology in such a way that they aren't damaging

&gt;considered native.

"/> Well..... I spent a lot of time last night reading to try and find an
answer, and couldn't. Some people take the establishment of a
non-captive group of sufficient genetic variety to ensure good
breeding to be a guide. Clearly the cat fits that bill.

Your suggestion regarding fitting into the ecology seems to fit a
couple of things I read - and here again, in most habitats, the cat
could now claim native status as it is no longer impacting on overall
animal numbers (I know there may be a few areas where this is not
true, but lets not fall out over those).

The main criteria seems to be &quot;has the animal adapted to its new
environment&quot;. Now of course, as cats are such adaptable animals this
would be true in most places around the world.

Nowhere, not once, could I find any reference to time scales. I admit
that seemed strange to me as well, I thought there would be.

Still, until we can get a zoologist to comment I suppose we will have
to agree to disagree as to whether the cats is native or not.

No, no need to &quot;fall out&quot; but I can tell you unequivocely that cats
have a *very large* impact on *many many* native species in this
country. With approximately 5 million cats (*not* including &quot;true&quot;
ferals) bringing home on average 3 - 4 prey per week, that's at least
10 million animals (considering half might be indoors cats and that's
overestimated) per week. Not all of them native of course.

Whether or not the British knew and believed in the holocaust before the

period between the withdrawal at Dunkirk and the Normandy beach
landings. Whilst not actually invaded the country was only just
standing. There was no way a successful invasion could have been
launched until the US joined in, and also Hitler helped by heading off

&lt;snip&gt;

The only reason this follows one of Bron's postings is that all the sub-
threads seem to currently end with stuff from her.

All the politics are completely off topic for all the groups this is
getting cross-posted to, though I guess we are providing plenty of
entertainment - flames are great at a safe distance! They are also
going nowhere as all parties involved are convinced of the rightness of
their viewpoints, and nothing (at least nothing as presented earlier in
the thread) is going to change their minds. And they are not going to
be seen to change their minds if they do! We have learnt something from
the Japanese - we all love to 'keep face'.

I never saw the original site, but suspect it might have said something
reasonable in a totally unreasonable manner.

Caveat:
ONLY NEUTERED CATS SHOULD BE ALLOWED OUT. I hope to breed
Oriental cats at some time in the future, but part of the requirements
is that I have moved to a house where I can provide a decent-size
enclosed outside run and the outer doors are cat-proof e.g. they all
have a porch &amp; therefore are double doors.

There are two issues here:

1) Are outdoor cats a danger to the native wildlife?

In the UK, generally no. We have had cats for hundreds of years
and they have been cosseted and valued for their ability to control mice
&amp; rats, considered vermin as they eat winter food stores, and also in
some places rabbits (introduced by the Romans) who compete with sheep
for pasture. Mine are also quite keen on catching and eating flies, and
so long as they don't get ill that's just fine with me, as is the rodent
deterrent as I live in an old house and had a mouse problem until I was
adopted by a cat. IMHO the biggest problem facing UK wildlife is the
loss of habitat since WW2 due to changes in farming methods, prompted in
part by the realisation that we were far from being able to feed
ourselves. We still are.

In other countries the answer is sometimes. There are some
islands in the S. Atlantic where cats are being eliminated because they
prey on very vulnerable ground-nesting birds. Ditto Australia, some
wildlife will be very vulnerable to cats. Not, I suspect, Kangaroos,
Wallabies &amp; Koalas.

2) Are outdoor cats a danger to themselves?

Again, generally not in the UK unless one happens to live by a
busy road in which case many have a fatal accident in their first 2
years of life. There is no native (or introduced) wildlife here which
is a danger to an adult cat except possibly mink - but that's a guess.

It's true that outdoor cats are more likely to get infections
and so on - but they rarely succumb (unless they've not had their
inoculations) unless they are very young, old, already ill or are
neglected so that they are already very ill when they arrive at the
vets.

Most cats in the UK die at the vets, and most of those because
they are old and/or terminally ill with (for example) cancer.

Also, unless one has a house with a porch on every door and is
willing to keep windows almost shut whatever the weather it's hard to
keep a cat in.

In the rest of the world the answer will vary according to what
native (or introduced) wildlife is present.

However there is little doubt (according to the books I've read
and my vets) that indoor cats are more likely to have behaviour problems
than outdoor cats. Most of the cats presented at the vets for
misbehaving are pedigrees, but in the UK it's rare to keep cross-bred
cats in. Some breeders demand cats they sell be kept in, but there are
plenty who don't mind so long as due care is taken - not next to busy
roads and so on.

3) Are outdoor cats a nuisance to other people?

That depends entirely on the other people. One persons nuisance
is another persons delight. People who live near me have small children
who 'play out' and they are very noisy at times. To me that constitutes
a nuisance but clearly one it's best to try to ignore, along with the
over-excited dogs they play with which are barking. It all happens
during the day and doesn't keep me awake if I'm ill.

Some (most) of my neighbours love my cats, know them and stop to
stroke them and talk to them. There are bands of small girls who are
besotted - it's like owning a boy-band (without the income!). However
one of them doesn't like the cats and I think they sense it as they pick
his paving slabs to roll on! On balance, where I live, they are not a
nuisance. They are certainly keen to run in, use the litter tray and
run out again. However it would be good if I could find a better way to
dispose of the used litter than leaving it out (well wrapped) for the
bin man.

Maybe it also depends on the legal situation. In the UK cats
are not owned like dogs so there is no legal requirement to control
them. It's not compulsory to stop to report if one runs one over, but
people who are cruel to cats can be prosecuted and are. Advice to those
who want to keep cats out of their gardens: get a powerful water
pistol. It won't hurt the cat and is probably great fun.

4) Are outdoor cats dangerous to people?

Here I think the answer is clearly no.

They certainly don't have the potential to hurt people in the
way that even small dogs do. Plenty of people get attacked and
sometimes killed by dogs in the UK every year (they are often but not
always doing something silly), but I can't think of a single case where
a domestic cat has been the culprit. Feral cats are another matter if
cornered, but most cats are rather like snakes - they are rather good at
avoiding trouble in the first place.

Some people are very allergic to cats but avoiding a cat when
out of doors is not difficult.

Now if the Beast of Bodmin Moor is ever cornered the story might
change! There are persistent rumours that we have some large cats at
liberty in the UK. clearly they could be dangerous to people, but the
Wild Boar (and various crosses) running around parts of the UK (New
Forest for one) are much more dangerous animals, especially a sow with
young. Now that's an interesting story - wild boar used to be native
but were hunted to extinction quite some time ago. Wild boar has become
a fashionable (and tasty) thing to eat, so some farmers have got some to
breed and farm, and being highly intelligent pigs it was inevitable that
some have escaped. Not all the escapees are 100% wild boar - quite a
few are crosses with Tamworth pigs (the closest in looks to a wild boar
with a long snout and ginger hair) but they all love to dig, can run
jolly fast and are aggressive. They are also fantastic at vanishing.
If you doubt that consider that an elephant can vanish at 3 metres in
the right environment.

Summary:

There is no answer which is right or wrong in all countries and all
situations. If, however, the original web site was using offensive
language then it was right that it was removed. Not sharing the same
views as one's neighbour is not an excuse to offend them.

This is my last work on the subject. Bron hasn't changed my views. I'm
sure I haven't altered hers (though I hope she has reconsidered feeding
the Magpies), and enough is enough. I have an OU exam in 2 weeks and
really need to be revising instead of reading off-topic (to my exam)
newsgroups.

Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on Sun, 8 Oct 2000
17:11:50 +0100, Surfer! &lt;nevis-v ... @nospam.demon.co.uk&gt; purred the
following:

:)There are two issues here:

Well, there were more than two, but let's not get picky :)

:)1) Are outdoor cats a danger to the native wildlife?
:)
:) In the UK, generally no. We have had cats for hundreds of years
:)and they have been cosseted and valued for their ability to control mice
:)&amp; rats, considered vermin as they eat winter food stores, and also in
:)some places rabbits (introduced by the Romans) who compete with sheep
:)for pasture. Mine are also quite keen on catching and eating flies, and
:)so long as they don't get ill that's just fine with me, as is the rodent
:)deterrent as I live in an old house and had a mouse problem until I was
:)adopted by a cat. IMHO the biggest problem facing UK wildlife is the
:)loss of habitat since WW2 due to changes in farming methods, prompted in
:)part by the realisation that we were far from being able to feed
:)ourselves. We still are.
:)
:) In other countries the answer is sometimes. There are some
:)islands in the S. Atlantic where cats are being eliminated because they
:)prey on very vulnerable ground-nesting birds. Ditto Australia, some
:)wildlife will be very vulnerable to cats. Not, I suspect, Kangaroos,
:)Wallabies &amp; Koalas.

That, I must say, is a fairly typical answer from someone overseas
(and that's not picking on the British in particular). Most os people
seem to think that the only wildlife in Australia are Kangaroos,
Wallabies and Koalas. Our wildlife is one of the most diverse on the
face of the earth (perhaps only outdone by Africa).

In Australia the danger to wildlife from cats is *always* there, not
just sometimes and not just in some places (except perhaps the central
business districts of the largest cities where the *only* &quot; wildlife&quot;
left are the pigeons :).

There are too many animals at risk in Australia (mostly due to cats
and foxes) to mention but there are many mammals/marsupials (the
desert mouse and bilby but two), birds and lizards are in real danger.

:)2) Are outdoor cats a danger to themselves?
:)
:) Again, generally not in the UK unless one happens to live by a
:)busy road in which case many have a fatal accident in their first 2
:)years of life. There is no native (or introduced) wildlife here which
:)is a danger to an adult cat except possibly mink - but that's a guess.

Perhaps a more accurate way of saying this is that most accidents with
cats occur in their first two years of being exposed to roads. If a
cat lives an indoor life for five years and then is let out, it has
the same road sense as a kitten. They only learn how to deal with
cars by being out there.

And you've not taken into account total idiots (and whether they exist
in the UK I cannot say) who swerve purposely to *hit* cats (or cane
toads which is the kind of catagory many people put cats into). No
matter how good the road sense of a cat it's a bit hard to avoid a car
speeding at you at 100km/hr (60 mph)!

:) It's true that outdoor cats are more likely to get infections
:)and so on - but they rarely succumb (unless they've not had their
:)inoculations) unless they are very young, old, already ill or are
:)neglected so that they are already very ill when they arrive at the
:)vets.

This is partially true. My grandmothers cats are very well cared for.
But they come home quite often with infected bites and scratches from
the strays they come into contact with. These infections are tended
daily, sometimes twice daily, until they have cleared - only to have
the cat go out and get them again. They are not very young, very old,
already ill or neglected.

Then there are the diseases that any cat, even ones of good health,
will *always* succomb to. I am talking about FIV, FeLV and Rabies to
name but three. We are very lucky here in Australia that because of
our strict quarantine laws we have an extremely low incidence of FIV
and FeLV and Rabies is non-existant. But I do not believe that is the
case in the UK and it certainly *isn't* the case in the USA.

Then there's the (generally) non-life threatening diseases such as cat
'flu. Some cats have been known to die from this and although there
is a vaccine, cats can still get some forms of it.

So disease is a definate risk no matter where you live (unless there
are no other cats or other animals in the area).

:) Most cats in the UK die at the vets, and most of those because
:)they are old and/or terminally ill with (for example) cancer.

I would hazard a guess (and it's only a guess) that most cats in
Australia die either at home or the Vets. But I would also say, from
my own experience, that outdoors cats die much more often from disease
(not including cancer) and accident than indoors cats.

:) Also, unless one has a house with a porch on every door and is
:)willing to keep windows almost shut whatever the weather it's hard to
:)keep a cat in.

I have my windows and doors security screened which means I can have
them open at any time and the cats cannot escape.

:) In the rest of the world the answer will vary according to what
:)native (or introduced) wildlife is present.

This is very true and a very good reason why it should be up to the
individual in whatever country they are in to decide what is best for
their cats. And they should also have the right not to be labelled
&quot;cruel&quot; for choosing an option that may save the life of the cat and
help the environment in some small way.

:) However there is little doubt (according to the books I've read
:)and my vets) that indoor cats are more likely to have behaviour problems
:)than outdoor cats. Most of the cats presented at the vets for
:)misbehaving are pedigrees, but in the UK it's rare to keep cross-bred
:)cats in. Some breeders demand cats they sell be kept in, but there are
:)plenty who don't mind so long as due care is taken - not next to busy
:)roads and so on.

I am on a cat mailing list. The majority of people on that list keep
their cats indoors only (I think we only have one person on the list
from the UK and one from France and that's about it for Europe). And
behavioural problems don't seem to be all that significant (and trust
me we talk about *everything* to do with our cats, so if the problem
was there, we would know about it).

From a personal point of view, my four babies are perfectly happy.
Tonight I spent the evening playing fetch with Augie. He is like a
little puppy and just retrieves anything and everything you throw and
returns it to you to do it again. Issy is asleep right now on top of
my monitor. The only behavioral &quot;problem&quot; Lottie has is that she
talks too much! And Siani is such a lady that she'd never complain :)

:)3) Are outdoor cats a nuisance to other people?
:)
:) That depends entirely on the other people. One persons nuisance
:)is another persons delight. People who live near me have small children
:)who 'play out' and they are very noisy at times. To me that constitutes
:)a nuisance but clearly one it's best to try to ignore, along with the
:)over-excited dogs they play with which are barking. It all happens
:)during the day and doesn't keep me awake if I'm ill.

Unfortunately the former is definately the norm here in Australia.
Whilst there are many, many more cat lovers than cat haters here
(thank goodness) even people who love cats can't tolerate other
peoples cats coming into their gardens. I personally couldn't care
less but I'm in the minority.

Friends of mine (who don't exactly love cats, but don't hate them
either) recently asked my advice on keeping cats out of their garden.
They had put a mulch layer of pine bark down over the weekend and when
they came out on Monday morning the neighbours cats had dug the whole
lot up! They know it was these two cats because they are the only
ones in the neighbourhood. They have tried talking to the neighbours
about them but they refuse to do anything. Now my friend is
considering setting humane traps to catch these cats and take them to
the RSPCA because they are such a nuisance.

:) Some (most) of my neighbours love my cats, know them and stop to
:)stroke them and talk to them. There are bands of small girls who are
:)besotted - it's like owning a boy-band (without the income!). However
:)one of them doesn't like the cats and I think they sense it as they pick
:)his paving slabs to roll on! On balance, where I live, they are not a
:)nuisance. They are certainly keen to run in, use the litter tray and
:)run out again. However it would be good if I could find a better way to
:)dispose of the used litter than leaving it out (well wrapped) for the
:)bin man.

Again, that's great if that's the way it is where you live. But where
I live it's not the case.

:) Maybe it also depends on the legal situation. In the UK cats
:)are not owned like dogs so there is no legal requirement to control
:)them. It's not compulsory to stop to report if one runs one over, but
:)people who are cruel to cats can be prosecuted and are. Advice to those
:)who want to keep cats out of their gardens: get a powerful water
:)pistol. It won't hurt the cat and is probably great fun.

Cats in Australia are definately owned. The legislators are realising
more and more that cats *can* and *should* be controlled by their
owners. I don't believe it's compulsory to let someone know if you
run over *any* animal in this country, but of course any decent human
being would do so if the animal was clearly owned.

Water guns don't always work. Firstly you have to be able to hide
well enough so that the cat doesn't see you before you can use it
effetively (in an open front garden this is almost impossible).
Secondly you have to have a fairly powerful water gun that is going to
truly frighten away a cat. And thirdly the most damage done by

:)&gt;
:)&gt;On this basis, rabbits, cane toads, rodents and foxes could also now
:)&gt;be considered native. But you ask *any* farmer in Australia and
:)&gt;they'll tell you the five biggest pests are rabbits, cane toads,
:)&gt;rodents, foxes and cats. They impact on farming more than any native
:)&gt;animal (with the possible exception of kangaroos).
:)
:)Maybe they should farm kangaroos instead of sheep?

Trust me they do!!! Kangaroo meat has long been the staple for the
&quot;beef&quot; content of cat and dog food. And all the best restaurants in
Australia serve Kangaroo steaks!

BTW it tastes very gamey ...

:)&gt;
:)&gt;Of course, sheep, cattle and pigs have &quot;adapted to its new

:)I suspect they also have a huge impact, but not in the most populated

Pasturalisation of land is the single most destructive influence on
the environment in Australia. But seeing as it provides our food and
clothing it's not something most people are willing to compromise on.
Unlike cats.

&gt;liberated. The concentration camp was replete with gas chamber, whipping
&gt;posts and crematorium. The hundred SS troops guarded the prisoners who were
&gt;found in an emanciated condition. British Forces also liberated 20,000
&gt;prisoners, including 8000 policical prisoners at a concentration camp
&gt;between Bremen and Hamburg. Disease was rampant at the camp and men and

like that was so unbelievable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; You seem to have this difficulty with your own history dear. Australia
&gt;&gt; was not under threat until April 1942 following the fall of the
&gt;&gt; Philippines, so until then Australian troops went to the European
&gt;&gt; theater of war. That effectively stopped in May 1942. By the end of
&gt;&gt; January 1943 a joint forces operation including Australia, New
&gt;&gt; Zealand, Canada and of course the USA was mounted to capture the
&gt;&gt; southeaster tip of New Guinea from Japanese troops, to protect
&gt;&gt; Australia from a Japanese invasion.

&gt;As the Japanese didn't come into the war until December (7th?) 1941, that
&gt;makes perfect sense.

&gt;&gt; So, in less than 9 months Allied forces (and remember that even though
&gt;&gt; there may not have been British troops on that mission, we were one of
&gt;&gt; the leaders of the Allies) had removed the threat of invasion from
&gt;&gt; Australia - if indeed one really existed.

&gt;&quot;there may not have been british troops&quot; .... hmm.. I think an attack on
&gt;our cities would constitute a threat of invasion. Particularly in light of
&gt;the fact that the Japanese were working down towards Australia, or do you
&gt;believe they were merely after PNG?

"/> But long before there was a real threat our allies, and your's, were
sent to your aid. Do you think we should have sent British troops to
fight on the shores of Australia and then move US troops to take their
place in Europe. Of course not, you moved things the shortest possible
distance.

&gt;Trust me they do!!! Kangaroo meat has long been the staple for the

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; The only reason this follows one of Bron's postings is that all the sub-
&gt; threads seem to currently end with stuff from her.

&gt; All the politics are completely off topic for all the groups this is
&gt; getting cross-posted to, though I guess we are providing plenty of
&gt; entertainment - flames are great at a safe distance! They are also
&gt; going nowhere as all parties involved are convinced of the rightness of
&gt; their viewpoints, and nothing (at least nothing as presented earlier in
&gt; the thread) is going to change their minds. And they are not going to
&gt; be seen to change their minds if they do! We have learnt something from
&gt; the Japanese - we all love to 'keep face'.

&gt; I never saw the original site, but suspect it might have said something
&gt; reasonable in a totally unreasonable manner.

&gt; Caveat:
&gt; ONLY NEUTERED CATS SHOULD BE ALLOWED OUT. I hope to breed
&gt; Oriental cats at some time in the future, but part of the requirements
&gt; is that I have moved to a house where I can provide a decent-size
&gt; enclosed outside run and the outer doors are cat-proof e.g. they all
&gt; have a porch &amp; therefore are double doors.

&gt; There are two issues here:

&gt; 1) Are outdoor cats a danger to the native wildlife?

&gt; In the UK, generally no. We have had cats for hundreds of years
&gt; and they have been cosseted and valued for their ability to control mice
&gt;&amp; rats, considered vermin as they eat winter food stores, and also in
&gt; some places rabbits (introduced by the Romans) who compete with sheep
&gt; for pasture. Mine are also quite keen on catching and eating flies, and
&gt; so long as they don't get ill that's just fine with me, as is the rodent
&gt; deterrent as I live in an old house and had a mouse problem until I was
&gt; adopted by a cat. IMHO the biggest problem facing UK wildlife is the
&gt; loss of habitat since WW2 due to changes in farming methods, prompted in
&gt; part by the realisation that we were far from being able to feed
&gt; ourselves. We still are.

&gt; In other countries the answer is sometimes. There are some
&gt; islands in the S. Atlantic where cats are being eliminated because they
&gt; prey on very vulnerable ground-nesting birds. Ditto Australia, some
&gt; wildlife will be very vulnerable to cats. Not, I suspect, Kangaroos,
&gt; Wallabies &amp; Koalas.

&gt; 2) Are outdoor cats a danger to themselves?

&gt; Again, generally not in the UK unless one happens to live by a
&gt; busy road in which case many have a fatal accident in their first 2
&gt; years of life. There is no native (or introduced) wildlife here which
&gt; is a danger to an adult cat except possibly mink - but that's a guess.

&gt; It's true that outdoor cats are more likely to get infections
&gt; and so on - but they rarely succumb (unless they've not had their
&gt; inoculations) unless they are very young, old, already ill or are
&gt; neglected so that they are already very ill when they arrive at the
&gt; vets.

&gt; Most cats in the UK die at the vets, and most of those because
&gt; they are old and/or terminally ill with (for example) cancer.

&gt; Also, unless one has a house with a porch on every door and is
&gt; willing to keep windows almost shut whatever the weather it's hard to
&gt; keep a cat in.

&gt; In the rest of the world the answer will vary according to what
&gt; native (or introduced) wildlife is present.

&gt; However there is little doubt (according to the books I've read
&gt; and my vets) that indoor cats are more likely to have behaviour problems
&gt; than outdoor cats. Most of the cats presented at the vets for
&gt; misbehaving are pedigrees, but in the UK it's rare to keep cross-bred
&gt; cats in. Some breeders demand cats they sell be kept in, but there are
&gt; plenty who don't mind so long as due care is taken - not next to busy
&gt; roads and so on.

&gt; 3) Are outdoor cats a nuisance to other people?

&gt; That depends entirely on the other people. One persons nuisance
&gt; is another persons delight. People who live near me have small children
&gt; who 'play out' and they are very noisy at times. To me that constitutes
&gt; a nuisance but clearly one it's best to try to ignore, along with the
&gt; over-excited dogs they play with which are barking. It all happens
&gt; during the day and doesn't keep me awake if I'm ill.

&gt; Some (most) of my neighbours love my cats, know them and stop to
&gt; stroke them and talk to them. There are bands of small girls who are
&gt; besotted - it's like owning a boy-band (without the income!). However
&gt; one of them doesn't like the cats and I think they sense it as they pick
&gt; his paving slabs to roll on! On balance, where I live, they are not a
&gt; nuisance. They are certainly keen to run in, use the litter tray and
&gt; run out again. However it would be good if I could find a better way to
&gt; dispose of the used litter than leaving it out (well wrapped) for the
&gt; bin man.

&gt; Maybe it also depends on the legal situation. In the UK cats
&gt; are not owned like dogs so there is no legal requirement to control
&gt; them. It's not compulsory to stop to report if one runs one over, but
&gt; people who are cruel to cats can be prosecuted and are. Advice to those
&gt; who want to keep cats out of their gardens: get a powerful water
&gt; pistol. It won't hurt the cat and is probably great fun.

&gt; 4) Are outdoor cats dangerous to people?

&gt; Here I think the answer is clearly no.

&gt; They certainly don't have the potential to hurt people in the
&gt; way that even small dogs do. Plenty of people get attacked and
&gt; sometimes killed by dogs in the UK every year (they are often but not
&gt; always doing something silly), but I can't think of a single case where
&gt; a domestic cat has been the culprit. Feral cats are another matter if
&gt; cornered, but most cats are rather like snakes - they are rather good at
&gt; avoiding trouble in the first place.

&gt; Some people are very allergic to cats but avoiding a cat when
&gt; out of doors is not difficult.

&gt; Now if the Beast of Bodmin Moor is ever cornered the story might
&gt; change! There are persistent rumours that we have some large cats at
&gt; liberty in the UK. clearly they could be dangerous to people, but the
&gt; Wild Boar (and various crosses) running around parts of the UK (New
&gt; Forest for one) are much more dangerous animals, especially a sow with
&gt; young. Now that's an interesting story - wild boar used to be native
&gt; but were hunted to extinction quite some time ago. Wild boar has become
&gt; a fashionable (and tasty) thing to eat, so some farmers have got some to
&gt; breed and farm, and being highly intelligent pigs it was inevitable that
&gt; some have escaped. Not all the escapees are 100% wild boar - quite a
&gt; few are crosses with Tamworth pigs (the closest in looks to a wild boar
&gt; with a long snout and ginger hair) but they all love to dig, can run
&gt; jolly fast and are aggressive. They are also fantastic at vanishing.
&gt; If you doubt that consider that an elephant can vanish at 3 metres in
&gt; the right environment.

&gt; Summary:

&gt; There is no answer which is right or wrong in all countries and all
&gt; situations. If, however, the original web site was using offensive
&gt; language then it was right that it was removed. Not sharing the same
&gt; views as one's neighbour is not an excuse to offend them.

&gt; This is my last work on the subject. Bron hasn't changed my views. I'm
&gt; sure I haven't altered hers (though I hope she has reconsidered feeding
&gt; the Magpies), and enough is enough. I have an OU exam in 2 weeks and
&gt; really need to be revising instead of reading off-topic (to my exam)
&gt; newsgroups.

Look I've avoided this whole thread because it is so off-topic ...

Sydney was bombed during WWII - and I know this because my Grandmother
served in the Army from 1941 - 1945 and her regiment was taken from
where they were near Sydney to a safe place at the time of the attack.

Dear Cat-Debaters :))

Can I ask a HUGE favour of everyone posting on this thread?

When I first posted about the terrible web site (a loooong time ago) I
x-posted it to several newsgroups that I believed were relevant. One
of these was rec.pets.cats.community. I hadn't really read very much
in that ng before and didn't realise that it was a fun newsgroup used
to let cats &quot;talk&quot; to one another. There are very few, if any, other
kinds of cat posts on that ng.

Several people from that group have posted to the other x-posted
groups asking that we all take out the rpcc references. I have
*tried* to remember to do it, but, admittedly, have not always done
so.

In essence, PLEASE could everyone replying to this thread (or any
other that isn't relevant to rpcc) take that ng out before hitting the
&quot;send&quot; button? It will only take a few moments to do and it will stop
a lot of ill feeling.

I should let you know too that some people on rpcc have reported
posters to their ISPs - so some of us may be getting reports from them
about what's been said (those of us that have bothered to give our
real addresses out that is).

In the interests of a happier cat community, I ask you to please do
this.

Thanks.

&gt; In other countries the answer is sometimes. There are some
&gt; islands in the S. Atlantic where cats are being eliminated because they
&gt; prey on very vulnerable ground-nesting birds. Ditto Australia, some
&gt; wildlife will be very vulnerable to cats. Not, I suspect, Kangaroos,

"/>&quot;some wildlife ARE very vulnerable&quot;, present tense is required here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Also, unless one has a house with a porch on every door and is
&gt; willing to keep windows almost shut whatever the weather it's hard to
&gt; keep a cat in.

"/> Interesting, I can keep my doors and windows fully open (as you must in the
heat) and my cats are kept inside.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However there is little doubt (according to the books I've read
&gt; and my vets) that indoor cats are more likely to have behaviour problems
&gt; than outdoor cats. Most of the cats presented at the vets for
&gt; misbehaving are pedigrees, but in the UK it's rare to keep cross-bred
&gt; cats in. Some breeders demand cats they sell be kept in, but there are
&gt; plenty who don't mind so long as due care is taken - not next to busy
&gt; roads and so on.

"/> Seems to me that sounds more like problems due to misbreeding than
environment.

&gt; Now if the Beast of Bodmin Moor is ever cornered the story might

&gt; There is no answer which is right or wrong in all countries and all

&gt; language then it was right that it was removed. Not sharing the same

"/> Hypocrite. You will offend your neighbour with your self richeous belief

By the way, the site appears to reside in the UK.

&gt; This is my last work on the subject. Bron hasn't changed my views. I'm
&gt; sure I haven't altered hers (though I hope she has reconsidered feeding
&gt; the Magpies), and enough is enough. I have an OU exam in 2 weeks and
&gt; really need to be revising instead of reading off-topic (to my exam)

&gt; On this basis, rabbits, cane toads, rodents and foxes could also now

&gt; Hmm.. I think that was the Germans.

"/>&quot;Why No Japanese Apology?
Lee Wha Rang
August 24, 1999 - Seattle, WA USA

&quot;Last night, the HistoryChannel aired The Rape of Nanjing - a film
documentary on the Japanese war crimes in Nanjing (Nanking), one-time
capital of China. The Japanese occupiers of the ancient city went on a
rampage killing more than half of the citizens and raping some 20,000
women - some as old as 80 and as young as 4.

Shots of Japanese soldiers laughing while decapitating their victims.
Bayonets were stuck into genitals of young rape victims. Infant girls
too young for rape were split open and then raped anyway. These barbaric
beastly acts went on unabated for several weeks.

Ironically and fortunately, the German Nazis smuggled out and preserved
a great deal of the film footage of the war crimes made by the Nazis and
the Japanese themselves. Unbelievably only one Japanese was hanged for
this crime of the century. All other perpetrators were untouched and
have remained unrepentant.&quot;

I'm not one for the sins of the fathers and I would never blame today's
Japanese for the crimes of previous generations, but please don't even
try to suggest that the Japanese weren't the most brutal during the
war. If you try to claim that then you obviously haven't got a clue
what went on, which is why those who suffered the brutality aren't able
to move on the way so many POWs did with Germany. My grandfather was a
POW under the Japanese and his brother was a POW under the Germans. His
brother and his companions came back and got on with their lives. My
grandfather and those who were imprisoned with him never, ever got over
it to the day they died. What their captors did was so unspeakable he
couldn't talk about it with anyone who wasn't also there and if you talk
to ex-POWs of both the Japanese and the Germans you'll find that was
almost always the case. Yes, the Germans perpetrated the biggest crime
against humanity in history, but the Japanese military were sadistic in
their torture and their brutality was beyond belief. Just to kill
wasn't enough.

Hey, Bron, lets get this back on track. Please provide a full cost-benefit
analysis of solving ALL of Australias current environmental issues,
including the supposed cat problem. Since you are so knowledgeable in these
areas, it should present you with no problems whatsoever to list out all the
data you have to hand. Please reply to this newsgroup; it will make
interesting reading.

So Bron, I challenge you to justify your arguments.

I'm merely asking you to justify your arguments. This is a perfectly
reasonable request. If you do not have the facts to hand, then you shouldn't
be posting stuff about culling cats. If you do not have the facts to hand,
then you haven't researched all the avenues a properly conducted
cost-benefits analysis would have taken you down. So you haven't really
looked into it properly have you ?

Suddenly, because you know you can't present arguments that hold water, you
try to defend yourself by scurrying behind the argument of me being
unreasonable. Yes you are correct - I KNOW it's a lot of work to put that
information together. But you have to have all the facts to hand to base
decisions on. So my request to you is perfectly reasonable. Decisions like
these are not made lightly. Hence you must do your homework.

If you present the information requested, then it shows you have put the
effort in, and are reasonably well informed to comment. It will also serve
as a starting point for a proper discussion on this thread. Only if you can
do this can you expect to gain credibility for your arguments. Time and time
again I've seen the blind lead by the misinformed. And how much needless
suffering has it caused ? Way too much. I'm just asking you to make sure of
the facts, and demonstrate that you have looked into this thread in
sufficient depth.

So I ask you Bron, am I being unreasonable ?

speaks for sensible Australians. We are losing millions of our native
wildlife every year due to both owned and feral cats. It has been shown in
areas where there is active culling of true ferals (and I'm not talking

That's the beauty of usenet - anybody can post an opinion. Of course,
anybody reading it is fully within their rights not to believe it. But in

Bron but I *have* researched this matter in a fair amount of depth. I've
read research papers and also seen first hand the effect that true ferals
can have on property in the outback.

Please don't be so quick to judge Australians, Andy. We are trying to do
our best to reverse the effects of *all* introduced animals. And I can do
my little bit by making sure that none of my cats breed and that they can
never catch any native wildlife.

*because* you've had them for longer. All of the species that cats would
have preyed on in their earlier days have already died out, while other
small mammals etc have evolved to be able to cope with the cat as a
predator. Two hundred years is not long enough for this to happen yet in
Australia. And we don't want to sit idley by and watch species become
extinct right now.

Bron &amp; Vicki

I give up ! Read the original question asked of you, instead of turning it
round.

For those of you who aren't intelligent enough to work out what I'm asking
for, a cost-benefit analysis examines ALL possible options, and is standard
business practice. That includes, but is NOT restricted to cats, man,
climate change cycles, loss of habitat, other species, etc. Got it ? ONLY if
you have looked at all the issues in this light, and give evidence that you
have done so, can you expect to be taken seriously.

I leave you with one last thought :-

Politicians have to be seen to be doing something. Has it ever ocurred to
you that the culling of animals (not just cats) who incidentally don't vote,
and therefore can't really voice an objection, is a very easy way of winning
votes, especially if the correct propaganda is applied simultaneously ? It
also avoids the need to address, at least for now, some of mans undesirable
activities, urbanisation, pasturalisation, etc.

Quite frankly, I am disapointed. I make a reasonable request, and you can't
even read the question, let alone give a reasoned answer. I expected far
more intelligence to be evident in the answers posted.

I am not trying to say that what you're doing is right or wrong, but given
the stuff you post on here, I suspect it is not based on a proper
all-encompassing analysis of the situation. Therefore, I invite you, again,
to prove me wrong, and give a proper analysis of ALL issues, not just the
cats, which are only part of the story.

I trust the situation is clear now ?

IIRC, you are against declawing (as am I). What you have asked us to do is
the equivalent of saying to you &quot;you can't prove that declawing is barbaric
unless you research and understand every other surgical proceedure that
cats undergo&quot;. Of course you don't have to be a Vet to know that declawing
is a horrible procedure. It stands alone in that. Just as our
environmental attitude to cats stands alone from all other environmental

not!

particular needs of this country, then I challenge *you* to prove me wrong.
Until you can investigate all the issues you have raised and can provide
checkable references I will continue to believe what I believe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think this is a bit harsh. I, too, think that it's important to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what I can for the environment - and that includes keeping my cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;indoors where they can't harm the native wildlife. Of course, being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;just your average &quot;Joe&quot; I don't have at my fingertips the cost of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;helping the environment by keeping cats in - I mean can you really put
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a dollar value on saving lives?

&gt;&gt;&gt;The thing is, so far anyway, I've not seen any evidence for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;environment being harmed by cats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It hasn't happened in Europe, and we have had cats far longer.

&gt;&gt;There have been many studies done that show that owned cats, as well as
&gt;&gt;ferals, have had a significant impact on the Australian environment.

&gt;&gt;The point is that the reason cats aren't as big a problem in Europe is
&gt;&gt;*because* you've had them for longer.

&gt;Right. So settle back and relax, in a few hundred more years
&gt;everything will sort itself out.

&gt;&gt; All of the species that cats would
&gt;&gt;have preyed on in their earlier days have already died out,

&gt;Have they? I don't think so.

&gt;&gt;while other
&gt;&gt;small mammals etc have evolved to be able to cope with the cat as a
&gt;&gt;predator.

&gt;Evolution take time my dear, lots of time. You would be right in
&gt;saying that animals have learnt to evade cats, even to live in balance
&gt;with them, but not to cope with them.

&gt;&gt; Two hundred years is not long enough for this to happen yet in
&gt;&gt;Australia. And we don't want to sit idley by and watch species become
&gt;&gt;extinct right now.

&gt;And I doubt very much if there will ever be a species wiped out by a
&gt;predator - other than man. Removal of habitat is what is responsible
&gt;for the endangered species of Australia - NOT cats.

"/> Bob

You are *so* wrong. Many of our smaller marsupials like bilbies and desert
mice are already in great danger. If we don't control cats (and foxes)
then we are going to wipe out these animals. I cannot help it if you do
not believe me, but I am telling the truth.

After all, you can't compare Australia to England, by your (bob perhaps) own

Given my salary, and my existing commitments - 8 cats (until recently 9),
dog, g/f, g/f's 3yr old daughter, bills, mortgage, etc. , there is not much
left to fund a study. I will not even attempt to insult you with a below

small difference keeping cats in will make to your environment it is
too much to ask that cats become prisoners in your homes.

Spare a blood thought for the cats for once.

If you genuinely feel that you cannot let your cats out THEN DON'T
BLOODY HAVE THEM.

It really is as simple as that.

Bron &amp; Vicki,

Thank you for your replies. Please see mine below.

At the same time, I apologise to both of you (and any other readers, if
there are any) for the harshness of some of my postings, especially Vicki. I
must confess that at times Bron, I have found you offensive, and very
frustrating. However, I am sure you can say the same of me !

&gt;&gt; I give up ! Read the original question asked of you, instead of turning
it
&gt;&gt; round.

&gt; So you say ... then you post below *sigh*

&gt;&gt; For those of you who aren't intelligent enough to work out what I'm
asking
&gt;&gt; for, a cost-benefit analysis examines ALL possible options, and is
&gt; standard
&gt;&gt; business practice.

&gt; Do you really understand the size of the project that would be and the
cost
&gt; of putting it together? Get real andy.

"/> Yes I do. I also knew right from the start that it was completely
unreasonable, but elected to continue with that approach to try and get my
point across. Of course you can't be expected to be aware of every issue. As
you say there are too many. I apologise for persisting with this line. I
sincerely hoped to hear you saying such as you have said. I was looking for
a sign that the overall situation was being considered, instead of just a
few issues. You have given this in this post, whereas previously I had not
really got this impression.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; That includes, but is NOT restricted to cats, man,
&gt;&gt; climate change cycles, loss of habitat, other species, etc. Got it ?
ONLY
&gt; if
&gt;&gt; you have looked at all the issues in this light, and give evidence that
&gt; you
&gt;&gt; have done so, can you expect to be taken seriously.

&gt; Rubbish. Some problems have a scope simply to large for the ordinary
&gt; Australian (or pommie or whatever), those problems are best left for those
&gt; with the inclination and education to fully study them. They take years
and
&gt; generally are biased based upon their opinion to begin with (ie, they set
&gt; out to prove something).

"/> That's fair comment in some cases, but I would hope there are still SOME
people with integrity too. But, yes, I agree you are certainly right to take
a sceptical view.

So instead of simply sitting back and saying &quot;the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; problem is to large to face&quot; and letting it go, we look at the information
&gt; we have on hand, we use a bit of common sense, we make a decision and go
&gt; with it.

"/> I hope I have not given this impression. I am just concerned to see the best
decisions made. Does my caution really stand out as apathy ? Your point
about making a decision and going with it is valid, but so is exercising
caution. It is a trade off between the two. Appraising ourselves of all the
issues (ok - as many as is reasonable) is important here as it gives us more
confidence that a decision is the 'correct' one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; After all, you can't compare Australia to England, by your (bob perhaps)
own
&gt; admission, the cats have been in britain for many generations, the damage
&gt; was done decades (perhaps centuries) ago, so you cannot compare the two
&gt; countries. Additionally, we can use history from your country to ensure
&gt; that ours doesn't go the same way.

"/> Good point. Your country as we know it is quite a 'young' country - no
offence to native Australians - and so is likely to have a well documented
history of change. Maybe this can help you as you say.

We don't share the &quot;not our fault&quot; and

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;it's too late&quot; apathy that you guys exhibit.

"/> I think this is unfair. As I've said before, it is not fair to blame the
generation of today for past generations mistakes and misdemeanours. Also,
please do not mistake caution for apathy on my part (as I've said above).
However I do not speak for everyone.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Politicians have to be seen to be doing something. Has it ever ocurred
to
&gt;&gt; you that the culling of animals (not just cats) who incidentally don't
&gt; vote,
&gt;&gt; and therefore can't really voice an objection, is a very easy way of
&gt; winning
&gt;&gt; votes, especially if the correct propaganda is applied simultaneously ?

&gt; In principle this is correct, however the politicians are the voice of the
&gt; people and I would suggest that a decision to cull cats would be a career
&gt; limiting move if the public as a majority didn't agree. Our government
are
&gt; adressing many forms of ecological issues, this is simply one of them.

"/> Fair comment, provided the government isn't influencing public opinion with
'inaccurate' propaganda.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; It
&gt;&gt; also avoids the need to address, at least for now, some of mans

&gt; You appear to think that there is a unilateral vendetta against cats.
&gt; That's untrue, it's what the thread is about, the other issues you mention
&gt; are all being addressed in some way or other.

"/> No I don't think for a minute that it is a unilateral vendetta. I was
however concerned that misinformation was an issue. It appears, given what
you have posted here that this is not the case.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I am disapointed. I make a reasonable request, and you
&gt; can't
&gt;&gt; even read the question, let alone give a reasoned answer. I expected far
&gt;&gt; more intelligence to be evident in the answers posted.

&gt; No, you made an unreasonable request. I notice you fail to address my
&gt; issue. Can you do it for your own country?

"/> No. I'm an engineer. I'm not a biologist, naturalist, botanist, etc.
However, as an engineer, I do have to evaluate suppliers proposals, plant
performance, etc. Scepticism goes with the turf. I have learnt the hard way
over the years. I have to represent the company I work fors interests.
However, I do feel I have the right to say when I don't think things have
been looked into properly. This was my impression here. I'm pleased to say
this latest post of yours has done much to dispel that impression.

Simple

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; where I'm making statements like bob does about how cats are native, and
&gt; there is no native wildlife for the cats to kill. They're nice critters

In reality, cats are *never* going to be eradicated from Australia. That's
what those cat-haters wanted. Ferals can be culled, and with over 42,000
being euthanaised at the RSPCA every year, it still doesn't make much of an
impact on the total numbers of cats.

So what do we do? According to you we have two options - let our cats out
to hurt the environment and possibly get hurt themselves, or kill them.

Sounds like the words of cat-hater, not lover.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You are *so* wrong. Many of our smaller marsupials like bilbies and

"/> Cats live in almost every area of Australia - including the desert.

Anyway, I can see that this is just one of those cases of &quot;never the twain
shall meet&quot;. If you have read my RSPCA articles on alt.cats (and I'm sure
you have) then you'll see that even they agree that keeping cats indoors is
for the good of native fauna.

I'm really glad that you live in a country that no longer feels the impact
of cats on native animals. Sorry, but I don't.

Not really.

Every year 2 AFL teams get 'volunteered' to play a game or two in London
and there is an amateur American league that is nation wide, though I think
they play in divisions so travel is not too onerous. Recently in Oz there
was a tv story on the USA national championships, where all the teams
travelled to one state(in the south USA, I think) for a week long carnival.
The league there has apparently moved to only 40/50% Aussies allowed in each
team *S*. They imported a Melbourne umpire for the finals and he commented
that the players called him &quot;Sir&quot; (which had *never* happened before) and he
thought they were &quot;taking the piss&quot; LOL.

There is also a British amateur league, though its small.
