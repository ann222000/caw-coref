Muslims may be portrayed world over as religious and devout but they are
widely detached from the teachings of their own faith. The first word of the
Holy Quran was not *Namaaz*, *Roza*, *Hajj, Zakat*, and certainly not* Jihad
*, which is bringing unwanted infamy to them. But, it was *Iqra*, which
means Read.  The number of Muslims in India rank second highest in the
world, only next to Indonesia , and almost equal to the population of the
United States , if their population is tallied properly (Muslim leaders
allege that Indian Muslims are deliberately undercounted). Dozens of
countries have less population than Muslims in India , including next door
neighbors Pakistan and Bangladesh . But what do Muslims feel about
themselves – a rudderless boat or critical mass - a drop in the Ganges or
violin notes in one of AR Rahman's thrilling musicals?
At the beginning of the 21st Century, India is becoming the cynosure of
nanotechnology development. The stories of India 's success are reported as
wildly as the celebration of New Year's Eve in the Madison Garden in New
York . But Muslims of India seem to be nearer to the mosque and farther to
the heaven. Paraphrasing Charles Dickens, I can state that it is the best of
the time for India , but it is the worst of the time for Indian Muslims.
They are suffering from the hellishly helpless syndrome, which is leading
them to the current state of colossal intellectual inertia and nudging them
to radicalism and extremism.
Who is to blame?  State and central governments, Hindus, creation of
Pakistan syndrome, discrimination, Islamophobia, Sangh Parivar? The litany
of negative excuses will go on as they are recounted at most of the
uninspiring sermons of Muslims' Friday prayers.
In my view, nobody should be blamed but Muslims themselves. If Muslims had
any respect for the first word of the Quran, they would have had sent their
children to study at the nearest government schools, pathshalas, madarsas,
colleges, or universities, where almost free education was available,
whether they were giving in Urdu or Hindi, Kannada or Bangla, Tamil or
Telugu. Although these schools might not have had good chairs to sit on or
clean sheets on the floor to squat on, the graduating students would have
had the ability to move on further and mentor their next generations as the
parents of Dalits and Backward groups have been doing.
My parents did the same thing. They sent me to several schools that did not
have proper desks. In some schools, we were sitting on the jute mats, under
a thatched roof. When I was in high school, I learned Hindi and Urdu with
the same passion. Due to the lack of the tutoring privilege, I was very poor
in English. In fact, I failed in English in my secondary examination, and
had to reappear in one subject. A humiliating experience? No. This failure
could not humiliate me, because I believed in Iqra. I proceeded to college,
where I met a mentor named Dr Kritya Nand Singh, who taught me how to write
good essays; of course in Hindi because I was growing up in Bihar . I still
loved Urdu Ghazals but I immersed myself in Hindi by reading Dinman and
Hindustan Samachar like my Islamic books. By the time I earned my bachelor's
degree, I was as fluent in Hindi as a kavi. In fact, my Hindu friends used
to inquire about my gotra, because they were thinking that I was a Brahmin.
In Bihar , Khan is one of the titles of Brahmins.
My addiction to the* Iqragiri *led me to appear at the Bihar Public
Service Commission's deputy collector's examination. I aced it on my first
attempt, but got thrown out because, that year, the state government
implemented a huge quota reservation for backward castes with retrospective
effect. Although I was one of the most economically backward persons who
passed the test, the system bypassed me. Did it make me bitter and prompt me
to hate all the backward castes, or all the Hindus, or the Bihar government
or India ? Not at all. Yes, I got depressed, felt helpless for a while. Then
I realized prayers and curses would not bring prosperity; it's the hard work
that counts.
Excellence is the best peaceful revenge. I took a detour, went to Saudi
Arabia , saved some money and did not waste it on building a big house back
home, but started preparing for the Test of English as a Second Language
(TOEFL) and Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) and finally landed in the
United States . Here again, I went for another master's degree, and more
certifications, and more education - Iqragiri.
What I did can be imitated by millions of Muslims in one way or another.
After all, did not Azim Premji, APJ Abdul Kalam, Shahrukh Khan, AR Rahman,
Irfan Pathan, Sania Mirza do the same thing in their own way?  In addition,
are not members of the upper caste Hindus going through the same crucible?
Did Ambani brothers excel in their endeavors by simply offering pujas and
waiting for quotas?
Instead of campaigning for Urdu to be the second language, fighting to
retain the word &quot;Muslim&quot; in the Aligarh Muslim University , and waging
agitation to save Muslim Personal Law, Muslims should spend their entire
energy in imparting education to their kids, in all humanly possible ways
and languages. If it is Sanskrit, so be it. In the sprit of the Iqragiri,
they should adopt all languages as Islamic and all academic institutions as
AMU and take advantage of the wave of renaissance India is witnessing. If a
set of common laws based on equality and justice is good for 700 million
Hindus, how can it be unethical for 250 million to 300 million Muslims?
Indeed, the laws related to a religion should be different and unique to the
respective religion.
Indian Muslims need to understand the expectations of being close to the
cutting and bleeding edge of success. They are not children of lesser god,
but they simply missed the train of the 20th century. They have to hop on
the next train as fast as possible. They have become the new Dalits of India,
or maybe Harijans. But nobody is going to help them. There will not be any
universal reservation for them.
The time has come that Indian Muslims should wake up to the clarion call:
Muslims need to help themselves. All the religious teachings indicate that
God helps those who help themselves. In my view, God expects us to pay for
the down payment; he will then arrange a flexible monthly premium. However,
he won't pay the installment.
To turn the tide from the perception of the children of violence and
failure to the reality of angels of peace and prosperity, Muslims need to
adopt professional education as, maybe, one of the sixth pillars of Islam as
I am still practicing it on myself and on my son, Shaan, who is only 13
years old, and learning French in addition to English – the lingua franca of
the world; my mother tongue Urdu; and our religious language Arabic. I wish
I could teach him Hindi too to connect him with the soul of India .
Iqra does not mean teaching only Arabic and Urdu, or Quran and Hadith or
producing only Hafiz and Maulana, who may know all the bylaws of the Jannat
(heaven) and hereafter, but ignorant of the constitution of the country
where they are currently breathing in. All world languages are God given.
Iqra also means to educate your kids to become a good wage earner, a nice
human being, an exemplary role model for the society, a scientist who could
develop medicines for dreadful diseases, The current world is also God
created, and it has been in existence for millions of years, and most likely
it will prosper for another millions of years, Insha Allah. Are Muslims
going to be simply a visitor to an ongoing worldly circus or will they also
contribute and improve it?
Once when I pushed my son for good grades, Shaan quipped, &quot;Daddy, it looks
like your religion is education.&quot; Why not, after all Iqra was the first word
of my religion. Being educated and rich should be fashionable among Muslims
too.

Subject: OTN: Re: Indian Muslims have to help themselves
To: orissatoday@googlegroups.com

Dear All,

Mr. Moon Khan is right in summing up that  Education and only Education will
serve as the Ladder for  not only Indian Muslims, but also for all Indians,
to achieve economic development and also  to climb up in the Society.

However, there are  some  statistical inaccuracies in his Article and the
same are explained  as follows:

AA. While explaining his point, he has stated the population of Hindus in
India as 700 million, while that of Muslims as 250 to 300 millions. The
figures are incorrect.

As per the Census of India-2001, total population of India stood at
1027 millions. Hindus accounted for 80.5% while Muslims accounted for 13.5%.
As per Indian Population Clock the present population of India stands
at 1115 millions.
Based on the above, as of now,  the total Population of Hindus is 900
million and that of Muslims is 150 million

BB. He has stated that the total population of Muslims in India equals the
total population of the USA. This is a wrong statement.

As per the Population Clock, the total population of USA stands at 303
millions, where as the total population of Indian Muslims, as of now, stands
at 150 millions.

Thanks,

J.N.Mahanty
