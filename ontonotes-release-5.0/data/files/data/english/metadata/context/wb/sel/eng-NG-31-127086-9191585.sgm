Here we go again. I finally gave up and went to the doctor. I have
pneumonia. So I have some minor problems with getting all the four 300mg
Cleocin caps down every day for a week. I only miss a few, but the diligent
Dr. sends me for a CT scan. It comes back with a round, strange shadow in my
right (not symptomatic) lobe. Now I'm up for a bronchoscope on Friday or so.
Could be nothing, or cancer. Shit! I didn't hesitate, I normally would, but
I've been so sick for so long that I can't imagine ignoring this test.
I'll let you know what shows up when I know. Don't we all just hate this
part? Personally, I've  been through it so long that I'm not too concerned.
Still........
All my love to each of you,
Cabbi

Cabbi,

good to hear from you!  But, too bad-condition-wise.  I don't know if
you hard, but my father was rushed to the ER on Wednesday, and,had his
gall bladder removed yesterday!  .  They thought that my father might
have had cancer-but, further tests proved the docs wrong.  He's going
to be in the hospital for at least a few more days, and after that.
probably a nursing home/rehab for a couple of weeks.  I've been so
worried, I'm starting to have symptoms of an umbilical hernia-which
I've already had repaired-twice

So, you don't know until all the tests are in-and maybe not even
then!  I'm not trying to scare you-just to show that there are always
other options-beside the worst scenario.  I wish you the best-as usual-
whatever it is.

Dear Cabbi,

I usually tell this to friends who have run afoul of the legal system as
they await a court date, but I think it still applies here. Don't worry
about it until you know what you're facing for sure. I know it's easier said
than done, both from legal and medical entanglements of my own.
Don't give in to any medical/psychological  terrorism until you're under
attack for sure. Deny it a chance to win from Jump street.
A good soul such as yourself deserves to be with us a long, long time.
Positive vibes are on their way from us all. Hang tough for us too.
And by all means keep us updated.
I got everything crossed for you for luck. I mean everything. So what if I
walk funny...

Hang in there, my friend--og

Dear Legend,
It's always good to be reminded of how much worse it could be if it is
someone close to you who is in danger. That shook me out of my pity party
and reminded me of how much worse it would be if it were my father, who is
91. Thank you for what I know was not meant as a wake up call, but it worked
as wells as any designed message. Thank you! My Dad is fine and in much
better health than am I. I love that arrangement, even if he doesn't. It's
selfish, but it's also fate. I'll be satisfied as long as he's well, no
mater what I may feel, as if there is a fair balance. Still, you never know.

Dear OG,
you are too kind. I feel like a total fraud when I hear the kindnesses you
heap upon me, and so much less the deserving recipient of good will. But I
know we're our own worst judges of such things, so I won't interfere with
you good wishes. I welcome them, and I just happen to need them at this

Hey Cabbi - Sorry to hear you're not feeling well. I wonder if you
might have lower lobe Pneumonia. Cleocin is not active against every
microbe that can invade the lung. On the positive side, early and even
mid-stage lung cancer would not necessarily make you feel sick, but
pneumonia sure would. We'll hope it's just a blur, or second
LL-Pneumonia.

Best Wishes

It has been a good while so most would not likely remember. Two years
ago in January, will be 3 years this coming Jan. I was commuting from
Minnesota to Kansas City weekly.....yes I know thats crazy, but the
pay warranted it, If there had been a decent air connection between
the 2 areas I would have just flown, but anyway, I was drivng ti KC on
Sunday, working 10 hr days thru Thursday, back to MN either Thursday
night or Friday. On the last trip I noticed a burning pain in my lower
left back, like a kidney I thought. I didnt worry about it, cuz it
went away when I quit driving so I figured it was a kink...I alread
had the 3 herniated thoracic disks, so I was used to upper back pain,
never had any lower back pain before, so I thought it was all the
driving making my muscles spasm in that area....2 days later im in
town and get rear ended...only about 25 mph at a stoplight, but then
my back was on FIRE, it was so bad that for the first time ever I
asked for the ambulance. They got me half ass comfortable at the
hospital, and did am MRI, and I could see on the techs face, something
wasnt right. I had a long time doctor here in KS, so they sent down
the images and read to him. He didnt waste time he said, yov've got a
tumor, this needs to come out right away, he also asked me if I wanted
to see a neurosurgeon he knew at KU Med center, I told him since I was
living in MN I would just go to Mayo Clinic...this was the first time
I was forbidden to drive....so I asked him straight up if I had
cancer, and he said he couldnt tell me for sure, but he said it
couldnt wait....he had been my doc since I was 13, he and the nurse
were teary eyed and I was scared to death. I told him I would fly to
Rochester, cuz I wanted to be with my wife and kids when I got the
news. After jumping thru the Mayo hoops...them telling me I didnt need
opiate pain relief, its only for end stage cancer patients, and I
yelled at him....I may be a fucking end stage cancer patient asshole!
Next they wanted to put me in a pain program...biofeedback,
accupuncture and other uninsurable voodoo, for about 25 grand. I
demanded to see a Neurosurgeon, or I would file a complaint...and I
stayed on their complaint line for 2 weeks until those idiots got me
to the Neurosurgeon, and he wanted a biopsy of the
tumor....FINALLY...Now all I had working against me was
anticipation...and agony...Mayo refused any opiate meds, even though I
was alreadt taking them for my upper back, they were prescribed from
another MN doc, but she wouldnt prescribe once I switched to the
clinic, for obvious reasons..I understood she didnt want to look like
she was allowing doc shopping, and I told Mayo this...they didnt care,
I called my Kansas doc to ask what was best, I told him if nothing
else Id fly down for a script, and fly back for the test, he fed-ex'd
me the needed scripts...I thanked him  and told him if that would get
him in trouble not to worry about me...I would rather fly down...and
he told me it wast a problem, but If I was staying in MN, Id need to
find a doc who could take care of it.....anyways...so finally, i get
relief.....2 days later the biopsy turned up a neurofibroma....totally
non-malignant, but can turn that way. Until it either becomes
malignant, or totally cripples my left leg, 3 top neurosurgeons
consider it to be inoperable, unless i sign an elective waiver, which
means i pay for it all . It is wrapped in a tamgle of nerves that most
likely would make my left leg useless, and of course nerve scarring
would later bring back the same or worse pain...what options.

Now Cabbi my friend, I dont write this to say, &quot;see? some have it
worse&quot;  No, not at all, and I hope you know me well enough to know I
wouldnt. In my rambling way Im saying I know what the wait is like.
The gamut of fears, doubts, possibilities and wondering what my
family's future would be if it were cancer, and on and on. I waited
nearly a month, while wonderful Mayo docs harassed me for opiod
therapy as if I were a felon...they treated me like dirt when I was
scared to death I may be dying in anywhere from 6 months to a year. I
hope they can sleep at night. Ive since forgiven them, but I wonder
how they could let someone who made a last minute flight to get a
diagnosis of possible cancer flail in the wind, untreated for a month.
My heart and prayers are with you my friend, and I know right now,
from here to Friday seems like more than a month. Heck I even tried
going to the ER to force their hand....it was just another chnce for
them to call me a seeker, and sent me home to wait. Please try not to
dwell on that...as easy as it is to say...anything., or anyone you
love, and an activity to distract you will not only give you a bright
spot, it will also make that wait that much shorter. You know how to
email me if theres anything your're more comfortable discussing
privately, but you will be very high on my prayer and hope list..and
yet again God has shown me how I was foolish to have ever thought
about leaving this group...not that Im a guardian angel...far from it,
but to have walked away when people I care for are in crisis would
have been a grave mistake.

Im with you my friend, you know how to reach me.

Deus Vobisccum,

I'm glad you're not hesitating about the bronchoscope. I'll keep my
fingers crossed for you, though I'm certain that the &quot;strange shadow&quot; is
nothing. I'ts probably the technician's thumb print on the film.  :-)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; diligent Dr. sends me for a CT scan. It comes back with a round,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; strange
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; shadow in my right (not symptomatic) lobe. Now I'm up for a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bronchoscope
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on Friday or so. Could be nothing, or cancer. Shit! I didn't hesitate,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; normally would, but I've been so sick for so long that I can't imagine
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ignoring this test.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll let you know what shows up when I know. Don't we all just hate
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; part? Personally, I've  been through it so long that I'm not too
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; concerned. Still........
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; All my love to each of you,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cabbi

&gt;&gt; Dear OG,
&gt;&gt; you are too kind. I feel like a total fraud when I hear the kindnesses
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt; heap upon me, and so much less the deserving recipient of good will. But
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; know we're our own worst judges of such things, so I won't interfere with
&gt;&gt; you good wishes. I welcome them, and I just happen to need them at this
&gt;&gt; particular point. Thank you and all others who have been so kind to me in
&gt;&gt; this NG and in our emails. It really shows how much human nature thrives
&gt;&gt; inspire of the negative influences it may suffer from without.
&gt;&gt; Love,
&gt;&gt; Cabbi

&gt; It has been a good while so most would not likely remember. Two years
&gt; ago in January, will be 3 years this coming Jan. I was commuting from
&gt; Minnesota to Kansas City weekly.....yes I know thats crazy, but the
&gt; pay warranted it, If there had been a decent air connection between
&gt; the 2 areas I would have just flown, but anyway, I was drivng ti KC on
&gt; Sunday, working 10 hr days thru Thursday, back to MN either Thursday
&gt; night or Friday. On the last trip I noticed a burning pain in my lower
&gt; left back, like a kidney I thought. I didnt worry about it, cuz it
&gt; went away when I quit driving so I figured it was a kink...I alread
&gt; had the 3 herniated thoracic disks, so I was used to upper back pain,
&gt; never had any lower back pain before, so I thought it was all the
&gt; driving making my muscles spasm in that area....2 days later im in
&gt; town and get rear ended...only about 25 mph at a stoplight, but then
&gt; my back was on FIRE, it was so bad that for the first time ever I
&gt; asked for the ambulance. They got me half ass comfortable at the
&gt; hospital, and did am MRI, and I could see on the techs face, something
&gt; wasnt right. I had a long time doctor here in KS, so they sent down
&gt; the images and read to him. He didnt waste time he said, yov've got a
&gt; tumor, this needs to come out right away, he also asked me if I wanted
&gt; to see a neurosurgeon he knew at KU Med center, I told him since I was
&gt; living in MN I would just go to Mayo Clinic...this was the first time
&gt; I was forbidden to drive....so I asked him straight up if I had
&gt; cancer, and he said he couldnt tell me for sure, but he said it
&gt; couldnt wait....he had been my doc since I was 13, he and the nurse
&gt; were teary eyed and I was scared to death. I told him I would fly to
&gt; Rochester, cuz I wanted to be with my wife and kids when I got the
&gt; news. After jumping thru the Mayo hoops...them telling me I didnt need
&gt; opiate pain relief, its only for end stage cancer patients, and I
&gt; yelled at him....I may be a fucking end stage cancer patient asshole!
&gt; Next they wanted to put me in a pain program...biofeedback,
&gt; accupuncture and other uninsurable voodoo, for about 25 grand. I
&gt; demanded to see a Neurosurgeon, or I would file a complaint...and I
&gt; stayed on their complaint line for 2 weeks until those idiots got me
&gt; to the Neurosurgeon, and he wanted a biopsy of the
&gt; tumor....FINALLY...Now all I had working against me was
&gt; anticipation...and agony...Mayo refused any opiate meds, even though I
&gt; was alreadt taking them for my upper back, they were prescribed from
&gt; another MN doc, but she wouldnt prescribe once I switched to the
&gt; clinic, for obvious reasons..I understood she didnt want to look like
&gt; she was allowing doc shopping, and I told Mayo this...they didnt care,
&gt; I called my Kansas doc to ask what was best, I told him if nothing
&gt; else Id fly down for a script, and fly back for the test, he fed-ex'd
&gt; me the needed scripts...I thanked him  and told him if that would get
&gt; him in trouble not to worry about me...I would rather fly down...and
&gt; he told me it wast a problem, but If I was staying in MN, Id need to
&gt; find a doc who could take care of it.....anyways...so finally, i get
&gt; relief.....2 days later the biopsy turned up a neurofibroma....totally
&gt; non-malignant, but can turn that way. Until it either becomes
&gt; malignant, or totally cripples my left leg, 3 top neurosurgeons
&gt; consider it to be inoperable, unless i sign an elective waiver, which
&gt; means i pay for it all . It is wrapped in a tamgle of nerves that most
&gt; likely would make my left leg useless, and of course nerve scarring
&gt; would later bring back the same or worse pain...what options.

&gt; Now Cabbi my friend, I dont write this to say, &quot;see? some have it
&gt; worse&quot;  No, not at all, and I hope you know me well enough to know I
&gt; wouldnt. In my rambling way Im saying I know what the wait is like.
&gt; The gamut of fears, doubts, possibilities and wondering what my
&gt; family's future would be if it were cancer, and on and on. I waited
&gt; nearly a month, while wonderful Mayo docs harassed me for opiod
&gt; therapy as if I were a felon...they treated me like dirt when I was
&gt; scared to death I may be dying in anywhere from 6 months to a year. I
&gt; hope they can sleep at night. Ive since forgiven them, but I wonder
&gt; how they could let someone who made a last minute flight to get a
&gt; diagnosis of possible cancer flail in the wind, untreated for a month.
&gt; My heart and prayers are with you my friend, and I know right now,
&gt; from here to Friday seems like more than a month. Heck I even tried
&gt; going to the ER to force their hand....it was just another chnce for
&gt; them to call me a seeker, and sent me home to wait. Please try not to
&gt; dwell on that...as easy as it is to say...anything., or anyone you
&gt; love, and an activity to distract you will not only give you a bright
&gt; spot, it will also make that wait that much shorter. You know how to
&gt; email me if theres anything your're more comfortable discussing
&gt; privately, but you will be very high on my prayer and hope list..and
&gt; yet again God has shown me how I was foolish to have ever thought
&gt; about leaving this group...not that Im a guardian angel...far from it,
&gt; but to have walked away when people I care for are in crisis would
&gt; have been a grave mistake.

&gt; Im with you my friend, you know how to reach me.

Dear David,
I had the biopsy this afternoon. (No fun.) But it's over. I'll get
results on Mon. or Tue. Of course your words shook me loose from my stubborn
and stupid self pity. We'll see what it is when we see. From there, I'll
work things out with the help of my friends, both here in Austin and on this
NG. I've had support for all this time and I've taken it for granted. I hope
others find there way here whether or not they need healing of tissue or of
the soul. It's all here to be had from so many sources who have already
experienced much, perhaps too much, but enough to be able to give some very
sage advice. Whatever happens, you know I'll be back.
Love,
Cabbi

&gt; Hey Cabbi - Sorry to hear you're not feeling well. I wonder if you
&gt; might have lower lobe Pneumonia. Cleocin is not active against every
&gt; microbe that can invade the lung. On the positive side, early and even
&gt; mid-stage lung cancer would not necessarily make you feel sick, but
&gt; pneumonia sure would. We'll hope it's just a blur, or second
&gt; LL-Pneumonia.

&gt; Best Wishes

Broad-spectrum antibiotic...kicks butt on certain types of

Dear Paul,
talk to me, brother. I saw the pix of the bronchoscope and the bottom
right lobe was swollen. Does that point to encapsulated pneumonia. If so,
I'm now on Augmentin. Is that sufficient to clear it? How long do you
suppose before a reduction of morning cough and fever (low grade)? I'm not
asking for a solid DX, just a wild guess. I never sue and I'll not chide you
regardless of any alternate reaction. In fact, I won't write about any such
thing. But if you're right, I'm gonna give you an e-handjob in front of the
whole NG.
(Paul, don't feel that last comment was a threat, unless that heightens the
anticipation, of course.)

Even after 450 ug of fentanyl IV + 8 mg of Versed this afternoon, I can't
sleep. Lucky me, huh. I've also taken 20 mg. of methadone and .5 of Xanax
about two hours ago.
Zip
Maybe a couple of Desoxyn and three Biphetamine 20's would knock me out.
What do you think. (Don't worry, wouldn't take them even if I allowed them
in the house.)
Must admit that Provigil does tend to put me to sleep, though. Won't take
them, either.

let's start by remembering the pneumonia is another way of saying lung
inflammation...with over 50 different causes...[lol - sorry to
complicate things with too much information!]

but in general terms - 'a pneumonic inflammation of the lungs occurs due
to collection of cellular wastes and blood cells within the air sacs
within the lungs.'  the trick has always been to correctly identify
which element activates the inflammation and get it stopped without
subject your system to 'too' much other insult - and antibios can be
very harsh on the body - as can other meds used to reduce inflammation
like steroids.

would 'x' level of inflammation allow for encapsulation? you betcha!!!
almost certainly it would create such an opportunistic event. - the
swelling alone would bring cilia action [cilia which help 'sweep out
spores, fungus, bacteria, and excess/old mucus] to a virtual standstill.
AND it also cancels some or all of the expansion of the lung [lung as a
flexible 'sack'] via the diaphragm. lower expansion = breeding ground

since you have demonstrated inflammation, doc has upped the ante going
to augmentin [NEVER take this one is you have kidney problems!] - a
combination of semisynthetic amoxicillin, and clavulanate potassium [a
lactamase inhibitor] which blocks enzymes needed by the bacteria - very
useful extra weapon when dealing with encapsulated bacterial infections!

you can help this situation by finding any sort of movement or
strectching which would help the diaphram expansion - hard to do when we
hurt, but see if there is anything that you 'can' do that will help the
expansion

one thing to be aware of is when resistant to standard antibio's, you
should be checked for 'fungal' vs which of the three common bacterial
forms is the cause - t'will change the treatment. you don't use
augmentin with fungal or mold

in some not very common cases, the inflammation is actually an
indication of adenoviral infection

how long? this could be as short as 2 weeks, but as long as 3-4 months,
depends upon getting the inflammation down so that the normal clearing
action will sweep out the muck - until then, you would remain at risk of
up/down swings of infection.

you mention the morning cough - too hard to tell the cause -

it this 'throat' or chest, or 'deep' as it feels to you? are you
'producing' with the cough or is it dry?

this could be a deep reflex due to rising activity level as you start
the day and move around, a dry throat irritation from mouth breathing or
fever,  or bronchial irritation from the gunk, or, it could be an
indication of low level ear/eustachian infection - 3 weeks before you
would see a result on it. same with the fever.

however - much of the above also depends upon whether you were a smoker
and if so for how long - lower lobe risk is much higher for those of us
have have smoked - no matter how long ago [well, not quite - after 20
years quit the risk does go down] also those who had chemical exposures
to 'whatever' are at higher risk than others. and then there are the
related medical conditions that apply:

in my case, i have still's - which can and does attack soft tissue thru
out the body - i can only really go by my own experiences over the years

not much was know about this back in the day - and originally i was
misdiagnosed in '56 with 'chronic granulomatous disease'
[ http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1590.htm ] seemed reasonable at the
time - but by the early '60's they had learned that a combination of the
still's by itself, and the lack of physical activity [including mostly
being seated] led to a lowered level of expansion of the diaphragmatic
muscle.

and was called pneumonia, but since it wasn't caused by; any of the
'infections, rather was an expresion fo the soft tissue damae, it was
realy pneumonitis - i.e. inflammation, not infection.

the tissue damage became fibrosis which means that i simply don't have
much elasticity in the lower lobes -

simply put the lower lobes just didn't expand normally and thus were
left vulnerable to opportunistic infections

normally steroids would never be used in conjunction with an infection
because they lower the body's immune function - but in the case of lung
tissue inflammation, it has been found that the already present
inflammation 'increases' the tissue swelling and increases the pockets
of infection - so steroids in conjunction with antibiotics are now
sometimes used with lower lobe lung infections. - but for those who do
'not' have auto-immune issues this would not be considered at this
stage.

what you are waiting for is the results of the test - this will tell
what, if any, other pathogens are present, and at the same should
indicate what is going on with the lung tissue itself -
[how's that for avoiding your offer? &lt;bg&gt;]

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Could be nothing, or cancer. Shit! I didn't hesitate, I normally

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I've been so sick for so long that I can't imagine ignoring this test.

&gt;&gt; Dear Paul,
&gt;&gt;     talk to me, brother. I saw the pix of the bronchoscope and the bottom
&gt;&gt; right lobe was swollen. Does that point to encapsulated pneumonia. If so,
&gt;&gt; I'm now on Augmentin. Is that sufficient to clear it? How long do you
&gt;&gt; suppose before a reduction of morning cough and fever (low grade)? I'm
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; asking for a solid DX, just a wild guess. I never sue and I'll not chide
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt; regardless of any alternate reaction. In fact, I won't write about any
&gt;&gt; such
&gt;&gt; thing. But if you're right, I'm gonna give you an e-handjob in front of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; whole NG.
&gt;&gt; (Paul, don't feel that last comment was a threat, unless that heightens
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; anticipation, of course.)

Dear Paul,
thank you so much for the insight. I think you're right on the money. I
was a smoker for 30 years. That means I've been &quot;clean&quot; since about 10-12
years ago, depending on my poor memory as to when I stopped. My cough in the
morning is very deep, but I think it's just the spit from my esophagus
running back down my throat because it won't go down into my stomach. I
gotta go get this damned Nissan opened up a bit.
But I'd like to tap your brain for a totally different issue. My best
friend's nephew is a huge and raging alcoholic. He's one who drinks until he
passes out. He has almost no control and he's now 50 years old. I've known
him since he was ten. He started drinking before he was 18 and he has always
had this problem behavior with alcohol. However, he's managed to raise a
family of four kids and he's still with the woman  he married in his youth.
For 13 years during his marriage he stopped drinking without any problems or
withdrawals. He took about 2500 ml. of ephedrine to keep himself clean and
sober. He had no problems with this treatment, but laws changed and he can
no longer get this stuff through his old supplier. I assume it was still
considered a &quot;health food&quot; back in the day. Needless to say, he's drinking
again and he hates himself. He wants to get his life back as it was. Is this
something any doctor could do, a specialist can do, or is he just screwed,
as he believes he is?

Thanks,
Cabbi

hoping for good news with your labs - the majority of lower lobe
inflammation issues are readily treated - so that's what i'm counting on
for you.

as to the new issue you raise - a functional addict, who could go over
the edge at any time either mentally or physically

re the ephedrine - my first reaction is to go uuuuuuuphhhh

the systemic danger level is only 24 milligrams daily

you do realize that ephedrine/ephedra is the [alkaloid] precursor for
methcathinone and crystal meth? removal of ephedrine from the open
shelves was the needed step [ yet bothersome to the rest of us] because
of the massive buys being done by those distilling it.

you write that he used it for so many years to keep himself clean and
sober - since ephedrine is basically a metabolic stimulant, he was, in
effect 'tuning' himself 'up' to counteract the alcohol withdrawal [and
probable underlying causative depression] that his body and mind was
undergoing.

by using this substitution method, he actually only switched from one
chemical cloud to another. but with different metabolic risks

as you know, the alcohol [a vasodilator] acts as a suppressant of
certain brain activity - releasing [lowering] emotional censors governed
by chemical receptors in the brain. a secondary but equally sought
alcohol effect is the memory blanking that accompanies heavy drinking -
since you don't have total recall, you have less emotion about/for
specific actions

one early hangover 'curative' was, sadly enough, ephedrine, charcoal and
vitamin b6. years ago, more than one doctor actually recommended it.

ephedrine [CNN stimulant - vasoconstrictor] heightens wakefulness,  can
regulate basel metabolism, increases respiration [has bronchodilating
effects], etc. - a perceived 'good' feeling. presuming that you don't
slip over into a poisoned state of pharm intoxication, you won't feel
the tremors, agitation, or psychosis that abuse would bring.

you didn't mention it, but was he /is he also a heavy caffeine drinker?
if so, then the combined ephedrine and caffeine usage simulates an
'herbal ecstasy' a wrap around 'everything is ok' chemically induced
state.

in any case, such a long term usage of ephedrine will have altered neuro
receptors in his body and brain - hopefully not permanently, but it is
possible [even likely] that he is at high risk for major blowback
without any warning. if there is any way to have him see a doc - be on
the lookout for hypertension and/or seizures.

there is another detrimental process involved with both: alcohol affects
the hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid axis - raising the blood levels of
catecholamines significantly - ephedrine does also though to a lesser
degree. - one result: the slow liver damage that only later kills you

as a long time alcohol abuser, he is still at heightened risk from the
ephedrine because of the stress [see prev. para] it will have put on
already weakened kidney, liver, vascular system(s) - not to mention
stroke or intracranial hemorrhage - ironically,  moderate alcohol
consumption can lower risk of cerebral infarction

another thing to consider - any outstanding interaction if he was also
taking:

Acetazolamide
Anesthetics (examples: cyclopropane, halothane)
Antacids
Corticosteroids (examples: dexamethasone (Decadron(R)), prednisone
(Deltasone(R)))
Creatine
Digoxin (Lanoxin(R))
Furazolidone
Medicines used for depression or Parkinson’s disease (monoamine oxidase
inhibitors (MAOIs), examples: phenelzine (Nardil(R)), selegiline
(Eldepryl(R)))
Medicine to decrease swelling or to lower blood pressure
Midodrine
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication = examples: ibuprofen (Advil,
Motrin, naproxen Aleve, Naprosyn), Anaprox, celecoxib (Celebrex),
diclofenac (Arthrotec, Voltaren), etodolac (Lodine), flurbiprofen
(Ansaid), indomethacin (Indocin), ketoprofen (Orudis), ketorolac
(Toradol), oxaprozin (Daypro), piroxicam (Feldene), rofecoxib (Vioxx)),
sulindac (Clinoril), tolmetin (Tolectin)
Oxilofrine
Phenylpropanolamine (found in many cough, cold, and diet formulas like
Acutrim(R), Dexatrim(R))
Procarbazine
Sodium bicarbonate
Theophylline

any interaction with above could have caused some damage

the long and short of it is that the average internist or gp hasn't a
clue of what to do or how to treat someone who has gone this route -

the chemistry of recovery is beyond anything they have been trained for.

as many relapses are the result of improper treatment as from no
treatment at all. all too often, the addict is blamed for not recovering
- yet to do so involves more than just will power -

all too often well meaning family or professionals shunt the individual
[abuser] off to 'just' a 12 step or similar 'social' recovery program -
with no understanding or treatment for the long lasting effects upon the
neuro/chemical  body

the mind does need to be retrained cognitively, but even more so do the
body systems.

given what you have written he might be needing an endocrinologist,
definitely a knowledgeable addiction specialist m.d. who is also trained
in nutritional needs for recovery.

age now 50

a) is there a family history [male or female] to indicate a genetic
predisposition?
b) if not [and even with], how much is known about the emotional
surroundings when he began to drink?
c) ever treated for depression and if so, how?
d) ditto for any other physical malady?
e) quality of general nutrition and eating habits? sugar intake?
f) any pattern of sleep deprivation or disturbance? tremors? sweats?
g) any urinary problems?

with appropriate combined treatment he can have  something akin to
normalcy - but it won't be easy or pretty.
the mental anguish is probably going to be harder than the physical.

even though his is a functional addict, neither his family, nor he,
himself can know just who he will be without the chemical support -
right now, only a piece of who he is is being revealed. he's had a
lifetime being the other.

as with so much in medicine, not every doctor, even when trained in a
particular arena, is a goof 'fit' for a particular patient - you may
have to interview a couple to find the one will see this though and not
'blame' him.

once someone is addicted, it really doesn't matter how they got that way
- you only care about the past because it gives insight into how to find
your way out. any volitional 'choices' made originally are moot now -
the addiction takes over everything.

that is not a free pass for choices that need to be made now - 'he' has
to want to effect the necessary changes

be well

&gt; &gt; let's start by remembering the pneumonia is another way of saying lung
&gt; &gt; inflammation...with over 50 different causes...[lol - sorry to
&gt; &gt; complicate things with too much information!]

&gt; &gt; but in general terms - 'a pneumonic inflammation of the lungs occurs due
&gt; &gt; to collection of cellular wastes and blood cells within the air sacs
&gt; &gt; within the lungs.'  the trick has always been to correctly identify
&gt; &gt; which element activates the inflammation and get it stopped without
&gt; &gt; subject your system to 'too' much other insult - and antibios can be
&gt; &gt; very harsh on the body - as can other meds used to reduce inflammation
&gt; &gt; like steroids.

&gt; &gt; would 'x' level of inflammation allow for encapsulation? you betcha!!!
&gt; &gt; almost certainly it would create such an opportunistic event. - the
&gt; &gt; swelling alone would bring cilia action [cilia which help 'sweep out
&gt; &gt; spores, fungus, bacteria, and excess/old mucus] to a virtual standstill.
&gt; &gt; AND it also cancels some or all of the expansion of the lung [lung as a
&gt; &gt; flexible 'sack'] via the diaphragm. lower expansion = breeding ground

&gt; &gt; since you have demonstrated inflammation, doc has upped the ante going
&gt; &gt; to augmentin [NEVER take this one is you have kidney problems!] - a
&gt; &gt; combination of semisynthetic amoxicillin, and clavulanate potassium [a
&gt; &gt; lactamase inhibitor] which blocks enzymes needed by the bacteria - very
&gt; &gt; useful extra weapon when dealing with encapsulated bacterial infections!

&gt; &gt; you can help this situation by finding any sort of movement or
&gt; &gt; strectching which would help the diaphram expansion - hard to do when we
&gt; &gt; hurt, but see if there is anything that you 'can' do that will help the
&gt; &gt; expansion

&gt; &gt; one thing to be aware of is when resistant to standard antibio's, you
&gt; &gt; should be checked for 'fungal' vs which of the three common bacterial
&gt; &gt; forms is the cause - t'will change the treatment. you don't use
&gt; &gt; augmentin with fungal or mold

&gt; &gt; in some not very common cases, the inflammation is actually an
&gt; &gt; indication of adenoviral infection

&gt; &gt; how long? this could be as short as 2 weeks, but as long as 3-4 months,
&gt; &gt; depends upon getting the inflammation down so that the normal clearing
&gt; &gt; action will sweep out the muck - until then, you would remain at risk of
&gt; &gt; up/down swings of infection.

&gt; &gt; you mention the morning cough - too hard to tell the cause -

&gt; &gt; it this 'throat' or chest, or 'deep' as it feels to you? are you
&gt; &gt; 'producing' with the cough or is it dry?

&gt; &gt; this could be a deep reflex due to rising activity level as you start
&gt; &gt; the day and move around, a dry throat irritation from mouth breathing or
&gt; &gt; fever,  or bronchial irritation from the gunk, or, it could be an
&gt; &gt; indication of low level ear/eustachian infection - 3 weeks before you
&gt; &gt; would see a result on it. same with the fever.

&gt; &gt; however - much of the above also depends upon whether you were a smoker
&gt; &gt; and if so for how long - lower lobe risk is much higher for those of us
&gt; &gt; have have smoked - no matter how long ago [well, not quite - after 20
&gt; &gt; years quit the risk does go down] also those who had chemical exposures
&gt; &gt; to 'whatever' are at higher risk than others. and then there are the
&gt; &gt; related medical conditions that apply:
