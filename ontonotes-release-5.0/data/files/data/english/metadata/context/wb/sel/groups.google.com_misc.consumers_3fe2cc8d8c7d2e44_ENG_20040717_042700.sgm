I applied to several banks for a credit card but had no luck so i
applied for a secured card. Don't know if my application would be
approved yet (read somewhere that there are still chances of turn
downs). Im new in the US and have 0 credit history. I went to some car
dealers and applied for a car loan. One of them is giving me 12.25%
interest rate for 5 years. I don't know if I should go for it to help
establish my credit and refinance it after a year or just use the
downpayment to get an old car and hope that the secured credit card
would be approved. But i was thinking that the secured card's amount
is very small and it looks like a large amount for a car loan on my
record will be good. Or does it matter at all?

Need advise...

Thanks...

"/> Is there a credit union in your area that you are eligible to join? Their
terms will likely be MUCH better for a loan and/or a secured credit card.

"/> WAY too much! You need a good, inexpensive used car, and a loan for 2 or 3
years. Otherwise you'll dig a hole that will be hard to get out of!

"/> NO!!!

Do NOT saddle yourself with debt in an attempt to establish a credit rating.
Start small, and work your way up.

You don't say what your job or salary range is, but your debt cannot be out
of line with your income.

"/> Which department store would offer a credit card for someone with no

Like I posted some time ago; I got a secured card, and have been
going that route. Maybe I should order a credit report now that
I've had 6 months with this card, to check it... How do I go about
ordering a credit report, anyway? I have an inherent distrust of
anything on the web saying &quot;Free&quot;. (As in FREE CREDIT REPORT etc.
etc.) Too often it's a scam or spam.

"/> Store cards are indeed tougher to qualify for. In my credit infancy, I was able
to get $2500 limit credit cards, yet numerous department stores turned me down.
Considering most have only $500 limit, it really doesn't make much sense.

"/> As others have said, I recommend going for a gas credit card.
Don't go for their Mastercard/Visa -- get the basic gas card,
and use it and pay the bill on time. Some store cards might
work, you could try Sears, but once again, get the basic store
card because it lets them have more control over your spending,
and I have to assume it will be easier to get (I know cards like
that used to be the easiest to get).

"/> And why do you wish to &quot;establish credit&quot;? I'd be considering that
first. I wouldn't take a 12% car loan for any reason; throwing money
away isn't going to help you. You can buy a house if you've had a job
for a few years and you find a lendr willing to do more than score
you.

Everyone has given you some great advice. IMHO, here are some basics that
you need:

1. A job
2. A real address
3. A real bank account (checking account)
4. A token savings account with a bank or credit union
5. A secured credit card with a $300 limit.

then, move up to:

6. A non-secured credit card
7. Store credit cards, like Best Buy or Circuit City or JC Penney

Now, all you need to do is to stay &quot;current&quot;....that is, pay your bills on
time.

Before you know it, you'll have credit deals mailed to you without even
asking.

Right now, IMHO, the &quot;key&quot; is to &quot;stay current&quot;, that is, never pay late. I
try to pay my bills within 48 hours of receiving them.

Also, I started with nothing but a $300 secured card. Now, that company has
elevated me to a $2,400 unsecured card.

It takes time and patience. Check out newsgroups like misc.consumers
(that's right here) and misc.legal, you'll see that the lenders, more than
ever, want to give you all the credit you want, but only if you have a good
record of paying them.

&gt; And why do you wish to &quot;establish credit&quot;?

"/> Just for the basic stuffs really.. I can't get a wireless phone
subscription because I dont have a credit history. So I'm using
prepaid now which is a lot more expensive. I applied for a home
phone.. and since I dont have a credit history, I had to give a
deposit. I couldnt rent a car. Most apartment leasing company need to
run some credit checks too. I can still manage without it right now
but I don't what else Id run into that needs credit check.

"/> I've got the first 4, hopefully my secured card would be approved
though.
Haven't tried store cards yet, but I read somewhere that they only
give that to those who already have a credit history. And I don't
want to take my chances again as it's another point against my credit
report if I have too many inquiries/turn downs. In fact i went to a
credit union and they turned me down because i dont have enough credit
credibility and I had too many inquiries.

I'd try the secured card for now. I applied for Bank of America coz
that's where my checking account is. Hope they'll give me one.

Thanks a lot!

"/> Nothing, nada, zip, zero...........0% interest.

After 6 months, it will probably jump to 8.9% or maybe 12%, but I was really
happy that they started me off in the &quot;0%&quot; APR package.

But, Bill, you have a great point........most companies will spend half of
their time giving you cards to get deeper in debt, then start spending even
more time to run up huge fees on you and pushing you into a collection
problem.

So, we're all on the same page. For me, the thing is to &quot;stay current.&quot;
Even if you can only make a minimum payment, do it and do it on time. At
least for me, better safe than sorry.
