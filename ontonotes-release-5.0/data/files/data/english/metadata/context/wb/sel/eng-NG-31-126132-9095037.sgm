OK. I have really liked this song since it came out but the lyrics have
always seemed a bit hard to completely nail down just exactly where Neil
is going. I would appreciate any thoughts on the subject from the
alt.music.rush denizens. If this has been discussed before and this has
been run into the ground, I apologize.

First off, is this a love song or a break up song?

Neil starts out with

It was long after midnight
When we got to unconditional love
She said &quot;Sure, my heart is boundless
But don't push my limits too far.&quot;
I said &quot;If love was so transcendant
I don't understand these boundaries.&quot;
She said &quot;Just don't disappoint me,
You know how complex women are.&quot;

Obviously this is a later stage of a courtship here. This man and woman
are contemplating marriage (I suppose) or at least monogamy. She tells
him she digs him but if he screws around on her then that digging could
decrease significantly. He starts to bargain but she holds firm to the
groundwork of the relationship and says in the chorus that she will be
here as long as he isn't too much of an ass:

I'll be around
If you don't let me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't let me down

Next verse:

It was just before sunrise
When we started on traditional roles
She said &quot;Sure, I'll be your partner
But don't make too many demands.&quot;
I said &quot;If love has these conditions,
I don't understand those songs you love.&quot;
She said &quot;This is not a love song
This isn't fantasyland.&quot;

Reinforces the terms of the contract, reminding him that the women's
movement has brought some changes since his mom and dad made similar
arrangements.

Now here is where my confusion comes in, the chorus:

Don't go too far
A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire
Don't cross the line
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
Don't let me down
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
Don't break the spell
The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

This is like the story has moved forward in time and we see events that
seem to be the end of the relationship.

The lines alternate with her requests and then scenes from the
relationship. The tropical sea could be a honeymoon scene, pattern of
moonlight on the bedroom floor could be a period of contentment in the
coupling.

The flame at the heart of the pawnbrokers diamond seems to be a detail
that neither of them are materialistic OR the relationship is over and
she has pawned the wedding ring.

The look in your eyes as you head for the door states that it's over.
The relationship is as dead as a &quot;cold&quot; fire.

Now that is one way to read it but sometimes I see it as &quot;cold fire&quot;
being for the period in a marriage after the wild passion has passed.
The fire is still there but it is practical and realistic, not
romantical or overly emotional.

The song reflects a mature relationship built on the ground rules of the
chorus. In this interpretation you have to sort of discount the running
for the door as not being the end but a rough patch that reinforces her
terms.

Thoughts?

Personally I have always interpreted this song as a screed against the
stereotypically portrayed overly romantic notion of &quot;perfect love&quot; soap-
opera type relationships.  Neil's just saying, hey guess what, that's all
bullshit, really.  The real giveaway is &quot;This is not a lovesong/this
isn't fantasyland&quot;.  He is saying, hey guess what, people in the real
world aren't like those one-dimensional cardboard characters you see on
your soap operas, and relationships in the real world aren't like those
perfect soap-opera relationships, either.

Neil has been quoted as saying he thinks the way love and relationships
are portrayed in pop culture (pop music, tv, etc.) is overly &quot;perfect&quot;
and sets up damagingly high expectations; here in Cold Fire he is just
illustrating that.  Note that any Rush song about chicks or relationships
will highlight some negative aspect of relationships -- for example,
Entre Nous (hey, you're smothering me here, we need some space to grow,
m'kay?) Open Secrets (look babe, I think we are talking right past each
other here; maybe we need to work at understanding each other better),
Speed of Love (read it yourself, I just at lunch), etc. etc. etc.

&quot;artcinco&quot; over-thought:

: First off, is this a love song or a break up song?

Why does it have to be either?  Neil has written numerous songs about
independence and interdependence.  This song, which I personally suspect was
inspired by the dregs of trying to hold a 'marriage' together while
endlessly touring, recording, etc. could well be a statement of the
idiosyncrasies inherent in a very long relationship between two people who
love each other very much and have deep history between them.

:
: Neil starts out with
:
: It was long after midnight
: When we got to unconditional love
: She said &quot;Sure, my heart is boundless
: But don't push my limits too far.&quot;
: I said &quot;If love was so transcendant
: I don't understand these boundaries.&quot;
: She said &quot;Just don't disappoint me,
: You know how complex women are.&quot;
:
: Obviously this is a later stage of a courtship here. This man and woman
: are contemplating marriage (I suppose) or at least monogamy. She tells
: him she digs him but if he screws around on her then that digging could
: decrease significantly. He starts to bargain but she holds firm to the
: groundwork of the relationship and says in the chorus that she will be
: here as long as he isn't too much of an ass:

Or the reference to midnight could be a metaphor to the relationship within
the context of 'the beginning'.  Hence, &quot;Long after midnight&quot; could be a
reference to &quot;long after the relationship started&quot;.  In 'Ghost Rider' Neil
relates how he explained to Selina that his and Jackie's common law marriage
was because they wanted to be together, not because they had to be together.
Like any other mature relationship, it takes work, compromise, and drawing
lines in the sand.  &quot;Don't push my limits too far&quot; might represent anything
from your example (don't screw around) to &quot;stop going off on endless bicycle
tours and expect that meeting up at Club Med afterward makes up for the fact
that you would rather be cycling around with a bunch of strangers than
spending time with your wife and daughter&quot;.  In my scenario, he's not
screwing around, but he is hiding out from his family, which often is just
as bad.  Maybe he doesn't feel that it is as bad, but &quot;you know how complex
women are&quot;.

:
: I'll be around
: If you don't let me down too far

Hey, there's no ring on the finger.  Check your shit, and remember Johnny
Carson, dude.

: It was just before sunrise
: When we started on traditional roles
: She said &quot;Sure, I'll be your partner
: But don't make too many demands.&quot;
: I said &quot;If love has these conditions,
: I don't understand those songs you love.&quot;
: She said &quot;This is not a love song
: This isn't fantasyland.&quot;
:
: Reinforces the terms of the contract, reminding him that the women's
: movement has brought some changes since his mom and dad made similar
: arrangements.

How did his mom and dad get involved in that verse?  Dude, for real: where
did you get that?  All she's saying is that the door swings both ways and
that he needs to keep his 'heart and mind united in a single...'.  It's
talking about how the woman is being pragmatic, imo.

: Now here is where my confusion comes in, the chorus:
:
: Don't go too far
: A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire

What's confusing?  It's a bright contrast, hence a cold fire

: Don't cross the line
: The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire

Same thing

: Don't let me down
: The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire

Same thing

: Don't break the spell
: The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

He fucked up.

:
: This is like the story has moved forward in time and we see events that
: seem to be the end of the relationship.
:
: The lines alternate with her requests and then scenes from the
: relationship. The tropical sea could be a honeymoon scene, pattern of
: moonlight on the bedroom floor could be a period of contentment in the
: coupling.

I disagree that the line references a relationship ending.  It represents a
woman pissed and getting her space.  I like what you said in the second
paragraph above here, and it is something that could easily be argued as
such, but it could also be my explanation about the ironic metaphors I
explained above.

:
: The flame at the heart of the pawnbrokers diamond seems to be a detail
: that neither of them are materialistic OR the relationship is over and
: she has pawned the wedding ring.
:
: The look in your eyes as you head for the door states that it's over.
: The relationship is as dead as a &quot;cold&quot; fire.
:
: Now that is one way to read it but sometimes I see it as &quot;cold fire&quot;
: being for the period in a marriage after the wild passion has passed.
: The fire is still there but it is practical and realistic, not
: romantical or overly emotional.

Ever had a woman (presuming you are a guy) get really, really pissed at you.
My girlfriend does such at least once a month.  Then she gets her space,
buys some tampax, apologizes for the outburst, and it's steak and blowjob
day all over again.  Relationships do that, but it doesn't spell the end of
a relationship.

:
: The song reflects a mature relationship built on the ground rules of the
: chorus. In this interpretation you have to sort of discount the running
: for the door as not being the end but a rough patch that reinforces her
: terms.

Bingo

: Thoughts?

Just shared them.  Interesting interpretation.

I don't think it's so open to interpretation.  The guy has all kinds of
illusions about relationships (he thinks love is so transcendent, etc.,
etc., etc.) and the woman bitch-slaps him back to reality.  Fade.  Then
Everyday Glory starts.

&gt; independence and interdependence.  This song, which I personally suspect was
&gt; inspired by the dregs of trying to hold a 'marriage' together while
&gt; endlessly touring, recording, etc. could well be a statement of the
&gt; idiosyncrasies inherent in a very long relationship between two people who
&gt; love each other very much and have deep history between them.
">

I take it as a love song but was wondering how my interpretation
compared to others. I suppose it doesn't have to be either but it seems
more binary to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; :
&gt; : Neil starts out with
&gt; :
&gt; : It was long after midnight
&gt; : When we got to unconditional love
&gt; : She said &quot;Sure, my heart is boundless
&gt; : But don't push my limits too far.&quot;
&gt; : I said &quot;If love was so transcendant
&gt; : I don't understand these boundaries.&quot;
&gt; : She said &quot;Just don't disappoint me,
&gt; : You know how complex women are.&quot;
&gt; :
&gt; : Obviously this is a later stage of a courtship here. This man and woman
&gt; : are contemplating marriage (I suppose) or at least monogamy. She tells
&gt; : him she digs him but if he screws around on her then that digging could
&gt; : decrease significantly. He starts to bargain but she holds firm to the
&gt; : groundwork of the relationship and says in the chorus that she will be
&gt; : here as long as he isn't too much of an ass:

&gt; Or the reference to midnight could be a metaphor to the relationship within
&gt; the context of 'the beginning'.  Hence, &quot;Long after midnight&quot; could be a
&gt; reference to &quot;long after the relationship started&quot;.  In 'Ghost Rider' Neil
&gt; relates how he explained to Selina that his and Jackie's common law marriage
&gt; was because they wanted to be together, not because they had to be together.
&gt; Like any other mature relationship, it takes work, compromise, and drawing
&gt; lines in the sand.  &quot;Don't push my limits too far&quot; might represent anything
&gt; from your example (don't screw around) to &quot;stop going off on endless bicycle
&gt; tours and expect that meeting up at Club Med afterward makes up for the fact
&gt; that you would rather be cycling around with a bunch of strangers than
&gt; spending time with your wife and daughter&quot;.  In my scenario, he's not
&gt; screwing around, but he is hiding out from his family, which often is just
&gt; as bad.  Maybe he doesn't feel that it is as bad, but &quot;you know how complex
&gt; women are&quot;.
">

I used screwing around as a common example of what pushing too far could
be. You are right that it could be a variety of things. Must have had
Meat Loaf's &quot;I Would Do Anything For Love&quot; floating around in the
subconscious.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; :
&gt; : I'll be around
&gt; : If you don't let me down too far

&gt; Hey, there's no ring on the finger.  Check your shit, and remember Johnny
&gt; Carson, dude.
">

I took it to be a marriage due to the mention of the pawnbroker's
diamond but it isn't a given.

I get that from the &quot;traditional roles&quot; mention. They are discussing
what each's gender means in the relationship. He then brings up the pop
culture stuff and she smacks it down.

Sure he is doing contrasts but the term &quot;Cold Fire&quot; can be interpreted
two ways.

&gt; I disagree that the line references a relationship ending.  It represents a
&gt; woman pissed and getting her space.  I like what you said in the second

&gt; such, but it could also be my explanation about the ironic metaphors I

I agree.

&gt; Ever had a woman (presuming you are a guy) get really, really pissed at you.
&gt; My girlfriend does such at least once a month.  Then she gets her space,

&gt; &gt;&gt; Personally I have always interpreted this song as a screed against
&gt; &gt;&gt; the stereotypically portrayed overly romantic notion of &quot;perfect
&gt; &gt;&gt; love&quot; soap- opera type relationships.  Neil's just saying, hey guess
&gt; &gt;&gt; what, that's all bullshit, really.  The real giveaway is &quot;This is not
&gt; &gt;&gt; a lovesong/this isn't fantasyland&quot;.  He is saying, hey guess what,
&gt; &gt;&gt; people in the real world aren't like those one-dimensional cardboard
&gt; &gt;&gt; characters you see on your soap operas, and relationships in the real
&gt; &gt;&gt; world aren't like those perfect soap-opera relationships, either.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Neil has been quoted as saying he thinks the way love and
&gt; &gt;&gt; relationships are portrayed in pop culture (pop music, tv, etc.) is
&gt; &gt;&gt; overly &quot;perfect&quot; and sets up damagingly high expectations; here in
&gt; &gt;&gt; Cold Fire he is just illustrating that.  Note that any Rush song
&gt; &gt;&gt; about chicks or relationships will highlight some negative aspect of
&gt; &gt;&gt; relationships -- for example, Entre Nous (hey, you're smothering me
&gt; &gt;&gt; here, we need some space to grow, m'kay?) Open Secrets (look babe, I
&gt; &gt;&gt; think we are talking right past each other here; maybe we need to
&gt; &gt;&gt; work at understanding each other better), Speed of Love (read it
&gt; &gt;&gt; yourself, I just at lunch), etc. etc. etc.

&gt; &gt;&gt; DB

&gt; &gt; Yeah, his stripping away all the pop culture garbage is what makes the
&gt; &gt; tune endearing and I get that but just find the narrative a bit open
&gt; &gt; for interpretation and maybe that is the point.

&gt; I don't think it's so open to interpretation.  The guy has all kinds of
&gt; illusions about relationships (he thinks love is so transcendent, etc.,
&gt; etc., etc.) and the woman bitch-slaps him back to reality.  Fade.  Then
&gt; Everyday Glory starts.

&gt; DB

True but I mainly couldn't fully glean if the relationship endured or
ended with the head for the door line and it likely isn't the overall
point anyway.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It was long after midnight
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When we got to unconditional love
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; She said &quot;Sure, my heart is boundless
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But don't push my limits too far.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I said &quot;If love was so transcendant
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't understand these boundaries.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; She said &quot;Just don't disappoint me,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You know how complex women are.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Obviously this is a later stage of a courtship here. This man and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; woman are contemplating marriage (I suppose) or at least
&gt; monogamy.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; She tells him she digs him but if he screws around on her then
&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; digging could decrease significantly. He starts to bargain but
&gt; she
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; holds firm to the groundwork of the relationship and says in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chorus that she will be here as long as he isn't too much of an
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ass:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'll be around
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you don't let me down too far
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'll be around
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you don't let me down

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Next verse:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It was just before sunrise
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When we started on traditional roles
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; She said &quot;Sure, I'll be your partner
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But don't make too many demands.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I said &quot;If love has these conditions,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't understand those songs you love.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; She said &quot;This is not a love song
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This isn't fantasyland.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Reinforces the terms of the contract, reminding him that the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; women's movement has brought some changes since his mom and dad
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; made similar arrangements.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now here is where my confusion comes in, the chorus:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Don't go too far
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Don't cross the line
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Don't let me down
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Don't break the spell
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This is like the story has moved forward in time and we see
&gt; events
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that seem to be the end of the relationship.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The lines alternate with her requests and then scenes from the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; relationship. The tropical sea could be a honeymoon scene,
&gt; pattern
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of moonlight on the bedroom floor could be a period of
&gt; contentment
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the coupling.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of the pawnbrokers diamond seems to be a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; detail that neither of them are materialistic OR the relationship
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is over and she has pawned the wedding ring.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door states that it's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; over. The relationship is as dead as a &quot;cold&quot; fire.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now that is one way to read it but sometimes I see it as &quot;cold
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fire&quot; being for the period in a marriage after the wild passion
&gt; has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; passed. The fire is still there but it is practical and
&gt; realistic,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not romantical or overly emotional.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The song reflects a mature relationship built on the ground rules
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chorus. In this interpretation you have to sort of discount the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; running for the door as not being the end but a rough patch that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reinforces her terms.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thoughts?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Personally I have always interpreted this song as a screed against
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the stereotypically portrayed overly romantic notion of &quot;perfect
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; love&quot; soap- opera type relationships.  Neil's just saying, hey
&gt; guess
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what, that's all bullshit, really.  The real giveaway is &quot;This is
&gt; not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a lovesong/this isn't fantasyland&quot;.  He is saying, hey guess what,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; people in the real world aren't like those one-dimensional
&gt; cardboard
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; characters you see on your soap operas, and relationships in the
&gt; real
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world aren't like those perfect soap-opera relationships, either.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Neil has been quoted as saying he thinks the way love and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relationships are portrayed in pop culture (pop music, tv, etc.) is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; overly &quot;perfect&quot; and sets up damagingly high expectations; here in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cold Fire he is just illustrating that.  Note that any Rush song
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about chicks or relationships will highlight some negative aspect
&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relationships -- for example, Entre Nous (hey, you're smothering me
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; here, we need some space to grow, m'kay?) Open Secrets (look babe,
&gt; I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; think we are talking right past each other here; maybe we need to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; work at understanding each other better), Speed of Love (read it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yourself, I just at lunch), etc. etc. etc.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; DB

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yeah, his stripping away all the pop culture garbage is what makes
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tune endearing and I get that but just find the narrative a bit open
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for interpretation and maybe that is the point.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't think it's so open to interpretation.  The guy has all kinds
&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; illusions about relationships (he thinks love is so transcendent,
&gt; etc.,
&gt; &gt;&gt; etc., etc.) and the woman bitch-slaps him back to reality.  Fade.
&gt; Then
&gt; &gt;&gt; Everyday Glory starts.

&gt; &gt;&gt; DB

&gt; &gt; True but I mainly couldn't fully glean if the relationship endured or
&gt; &gt; ended with the head for the door line and it likely isn't the overall
&gt; &gt; point anyway.

&gt; He left it intentionally ambiguous to leave open the possibility of a
&gt; sequel.

if you had only quoted the relevant parts of the message in your
follow-ups you wouldn't of had to scroll down so far to see this
message.

now someone can correct my grammar. 'wouldn't of had'?? that just
doesn't sound right, is it?

does anyone think some of those lyrics might reflect his personal
life? given the nature of his job his own marriage certainly wasn't
the romantic norm.

&gt; First off, is this a love song or a break up song?

&gt; Neil starts out with

&gt; It was long after midnight
&gt; When we got to unconditional love
&gt; She said &quot;Sure, my heart is boundless
&gt; But don't push my limits too far.&quot;
&gt; I said &quot;If love was so transcendant
&gt; I don't understand these boundaries.&quot;
&gt; She said &quot;Just don't disappoint me,
&gt; You know how complex women are.&quot;

&gt; Obviously this is a later stage of a courtship here. This man and woman
&gt; are contemplating marriage (I suppose) or at least monogamy. She tells
&gt; him she digs him but if he screws around on her then that digging could
&gt; decrease significantly. He starts to bargain but she holds firm to the
&gt; groundwork of the relationship and says in the chorus that she will be
&gt; here as long as he isn't too much of an ass:

&gt; I'll be around
&gt; If you don't let me down too far
&gt; I'll be around
&gt; If you don't let me down

&gt; Next verse:

&gt; It was just before sunrise
&gt; When we started on traditional roles
&gt; She said &quot;Sure, I'll be your partner
&gt; But don't make too many demands.&quot;
&gt; I said &quot;If love has these conditions,
&gt; I don't understand those songs you love.&quot;
&gt; She said &quot;This is not a love song
&gt; This isn't fantasyland.&quot;

&gt; Reinforces the terms of the contract, reminding him that the women's
&gt; movement has brought some changes since his mom and dad made similar
&gt; arrangements.

&gt; Now here is where my confusion comes in, the chorus:

&gt; Don't go too far
&gt; A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire
&gt; Don't cross the line
&gt; The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
&gt; Don't let me down
&gt; The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
&gt; Don't break the spell
&gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

&gt; This is like the story has moved forward in time and we see events that
&gt; seem to be the end of the relationship.

&gt; The lines alternate with her requests and then scenes from the
&gt; relationship. The tropical sea could be a honeymoon scene, pattern of
&gt; moonlight on the bedroom floor could be a period of contentment in the
&gt; coupling.

&gt; The flame at the heart of the pawnbrokers diamond seems to be a detail
&gt; that neither of them are materialistic OR the relationship is over and
&gt; she has pawned the wedding ring.

&gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door states that it's over.
&gt; The relationship is as dead as a &quot;cold&quot; fire.

&gt; Now that is one way to read it but sometimes I see it as &quot;cold fire&quot;
&gt; being for the period in a marriage after the wild passion has passed.
&gt; The fire is still there but it is practical and realistic, not
&gt; romantical or overly emotional.

&gt; The song reflects a mature relationship built on the ground rules of the
&gt; chorus. In this interpretation you have to sort of discount the running
&gt; for the door as not being the end but a rough patch that reinforces her
&gt; terms.

&gt; Thoughts?

I think it is a song about the notion of love and how that notion
fares over time in a relationship. He introduces the elements of the
first two verses with phrases that serve two purposes. &quot;Long after
midnight&quot; and &quot;just before sunrise&quot; obviously relate to the aspect of
time, but they also relate to how one time period provides a sense of
protective darkness and concealment in which the dreamlike notions of
love can survive, while the other is a period during which the light
of reality is certain to cast its glare on the dreamlike quality of
the initial aspects of a new relationship. Long after midnight,
concepts such as unconditional love and boundless hearts enter the
conversation. However, even during the initial phase of the dialogue,
the fact that the notion of love cannot transcend an individual's
limits is introduced. Just before sunrise, the aspect of traditional
roles and resultant demands begin to have a stifling effect on the
relationship.  I feel the reality of the limits introduced in the
first verse are further stressed by segment which ties the first two
verses together; stating that people have limits and cannot often
endure being let down by their partners merely reinforces the fact
that the notion of love and its supposedly unconditional and boundless
aspects cannot exist when the notion meets reality. Thus, the notion
of love changes as soon as someone experiences it because to
experience it makes it a reality rather than a concept.

">

I think this is the most creative lyrical passage from the song
because it has a meaning that most people would overlook. He has used
specific examples of light producing instances - phosphorescent waves,
moonlight, the center of a diamond, and the look in an exiting lover's
eyes. The first three are events in which light is emitted with no
heat. We generally associate light with producing heat, so it is
intentional that he would choose examples which produce no heat
because heat is associated with passion. Phosphorescence, moonlight,
and the glint of a diamond can seem bright, yet they emit no warmth.
The same would be true as you look into your lover's eyes as he or she
is leaving you. (This use of the absence of heat associated with light
was also used by Dante in The Divine Comedy. The innermost circle of
Hell was as cold as ice because the light of the Christian deity and
its loving warmth could not be felt by the most damned of all. While I
doubt Neil was giving a nod to Dante, I thought it worthy of
mentioning another literary example that employed the similar
symbolism even though it is a slightly different usage.)

I very much enjoyed reading your interpretation, Art. I think you made
many valid points. I also liked your take on the term &quot;cold fire&quot; as
it relates to the change toward the practical.

Why didn't you mention the last part of the song?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; over. The relationship is as dead as a &quot;cold&quot; fire.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now that is one way to read it but sometimes I see it as &quot;cold
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fire&quot; being for the period in a marriage after the wild passion
&gt; &gt;&gt; has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; passed. The fire is still there but it is practical and
&gt; &gt;&gt; realistic,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not romantical or overly emotional.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The song reflects a mature relationship built on the ground rules
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chorus. In this interpretation you have to sort of discount the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; running for the door as not being the end but a rough patch that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reinforces her terms.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thoughts?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Personally I have always interpreted this song as a screed against
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the stereotypically portrayed overly romantic notion of &quot;perfect
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; love&quot; soap- opera type relationships.  Neil's just saying, hey
&gt; &gt;&gt; guess
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what, that's all bullshit, really.  The real giveaway is &quot;This is
&gt; &gt;&gt; not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a lovesong/this isn't fantasyland&quot;.  He is saying, hey guess what,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; people in the real world aren't like those one-dimensional
&gt; &gt;&gt; cardboard
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; characters you see on your soap operas, and relationships in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; real
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world aren't like those perfect soap-opera relationships, either.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Neil has been quoted as saying he thinks the way love and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relationships are portrayed in pop culture (pop music, tv, etc.) is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; overly &quot;perfect&quot; and sets up damagingly high expectations; here in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cold Fire he is just illustrating that.  Note that any Rush song
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about chicks or relationships will highlight some negative aspect
&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relationships -- for example, Entre Nous (hey, you're smothering me
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; here, we need some space to grow, m'kay?) Open Secrets (look babe,
&gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; think we are talking right past each other here; maybe we need to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; work at understanding each other better), Speed of Love (read it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yourself, I just at lunch), etc. etc. etc.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; DB

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yeah, his stripping away all the pop culture garbage is what makes
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tune endearing and I get that but just find the narrative a bit open
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for interpretation and maybe that is the point.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't think it's so open to interpretation.  The guy has all kinds
&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; illusions about relationships (he thinks love is so transcendent,
&gt; &gt;&gt; etc.,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; etc., etc.) and the woman bitch-slaps him back to reality.  Fade.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Then
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Everyday Glory starts.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; DB

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; True but I mainly couldn't fully glean if the relationship endured or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ended with the head for the door line and it likely isn't the overall
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; point anyway.

&gt; &gt;&gt; He left it intentionally ambiguous to leave open the possibility of a
&gt; &gt;&gt; sequel.

&gt; &gt;Hoping for &quot;Retirement Man&quot; at some point.

&gt; if you had only quoted the relevant parts of the message in your
&gt; follow-ups you wouldn't of had to scroll down so far to see this
&gt; message.

&gt; now someone can correct my grammar. 'wouldn't of had'?? that just
&gt; doesn't sound right, is it?

&gt; does anyone think some of those lyrics might reflect his personal
&gt; life? given the nature of his job his own marriage certainly wasn't
&gt; the romantic norm.

&gt; &gt; alt.music.rush denizens. If this has been discussed before and this has
&gt; &gt; been run into the ground, I apologize.

&gt; &gt; First off, is this a love song or a break up song?

&gt; &gt; Neil starts out with

&gt; &gt; It was long after midnight
&gt; &gt; When we got to unconditional love
&gt; &gt; She said &quot;Sure, my heart is boundless
&gt; &gt; But don't push my limits too far.&quot;
&gt; &gt; I said &quot;If love was so transcendant
&gt; &gt; I don't understand these boundaries.&quot;
&gt; &gt; She said &quot;Just don't disappoint me,
&gt; &gt; You know how complex women are.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Obviously this is a later stage of a courtship here. This man and woman
&gt; &gt; are contemplating marriage (I suppose) or at least monogamy. She tells
&gt; &gt; him she digs him but if he screws around on her then that digging could
&gt; &gt; decrease significantly. He starts to bargain but she holds firm to the
&gt; &gt; groundwork of the relationship and says in the chorus that she will be
&gt; &gt; here as long as he isn't too much of an ass:

&gt; &gt; I'll be around
&gt; &gt; If you don't let me down too far
&gt; &gt; I'll be around
&gt; &gt; If you don't let me down

&gt; &gt; Next verse:

&gt; &gt; It was just before sunrise
&gt; &gt; When we started on traditional roles
&gt; &gt; She said &quot;Sure, I'll be your partner
&gt; &gt; But don't make too many demands.&quot;
&gt; &gt; I said &quot;If love has these conditions,
&gt; &gt; I don't understand those songs you love.&quot;
&gt; &gt; She said &quot;This is not a love song
&gt; &gt; This isn't fantasyland.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Reinforces the terms of the contract, reminding him that the women's
&gt; &gt; movement has brought some changes since his mom and dad made similar
&gt; &gt; arrangements.

&gt; &gt; Now here is where my confusion comes in, the chorus:

&gt; &gt; Don't go too far
&gt; &gt; A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire
&gt; &gt; Don't cross the line
&gt; &gt; The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
&gt; &gt; Don't let me down
&gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
&gt; &gt; Don't break the spell
&gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

&gt; &gt; This is like the story has moved forward in time and we see events that
&gt; &gt; seem to be the end of the relationship.

&gt; &gt; The lines alternate with her requests and then scenes from the
&gt; &gt; relationship. The tropical sea could be a honeymoon scene, pattern of
&gt; &gt; moonlight on the bedroom floor could be a period of contentment in the
&gt; &gt; coupling.

&gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of the pawnbrokers diamond seems to be a detail
&gt; &gt; that neither of them are materialistic OR the relationship is over and
&gt; &gt; she has pawned the wedding ring.

&gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door states that it's over.
&gt; &gt; The relationship is as dead as a &quot;cold&quot; fire.

&gt; &gt; Now that is one way to read it but sometimes I see it as &quot;cold fire&quot;
&gt; &gt; being for the period in a marriage after the wild passion has passed.
&gt; &gt; The fire is still there but it is practical and realistic, not
&gt; &gt; romantical or overly emotional.

&gt; &gt; The song reflects a mature relationship built on the ground rules of the
&gt; &gt; chorus. In this interpretation you have to sort of discount the running
&gt; &gt; for the door as not being the end but a rough patch that reinforces her
&gt; &gt; terms.

&gt; &gt; Thoughts?

&gt; &gt; First off, is this a love song or a break up song?

&gt; I think it is a song about the notion of love and how that notion
&gt; fares over time in a relationship. He introduces the elements of the
&gt; first two verses with phrases that serve two purposes. &quot;Long after
&gt; midnight&quot; and &quot;just before sunrise&quot; obviously relate to the aspect of
&gt; time, but they also relate to how one time period provides a sense of
&gt; protective darkness and concealment in which the dreamlike notions of
&gt; love can survive, while the other is a period during which the light
&gt; of reality is certain to cast its glare on the dreamlike quality of
&gt; the initial aspects of a new relationship. Long after midnight,
&gt; concepts such as unconditional love and boundless hearts enter the
&gt; conversation. However, even during the initial phase of the dialogue,
&gt; the fact that the notion of love cannot transcend an individual's
&gt; limits is introduced. Just before sunrise, the aspect of traditional
&gt; roles and resultant demands begin to have a stifling effect on the
&gt; relationship.  I feel the reality of the limits introduced in the
&gt; first verse are further stressed by segment which ties the first two
&gt; verses together; stating that people have limits and cannot often
&gt; endure being let down by their partners merely reinforces the fact
&gt; that the notion of love and its supposedly unconditional and boundless
&gt; aspects cannot exist when the notion meets reality. Thus, the notion
&gt; of love changes as soon as someone experiences it because to
&gt; experience it makes it a reality rather than a concept.

I agree, VOR. A maturing relationship and reality are usually completely
at odds with saving the damsel in distress and prince charming.

&gt; &gt; Don't break the spell
&gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

&gt; I think this is the most creative lyrical passage from the song
&gt; because it has a meaning that most people would overlook. He has used
&gt; specific examples of light producing instances - phosphorescent waves,
&gt; moonlight, the center of a diamond, and the look in an exiting lover's
&gt; eyes. The first three are events in which light is emitted with no
&gt; heat. We generally associate light with producing heat, so it is
&gt; intentional that he would choose examples which produce no heat
&gt; because heat is associated with passion. Phosphorescence, moonlight,
&gt; and the glint of a diamond can seem bright, yet they emit no warmth.
&gt; The same would be true as you look into your lover's eyes as he or she
&gt; is leaving you. (This use of the absence of heat associated with light
&gt; was also used by Dante in The Divine Comedy. The innermost circle of
&gt; Hell was as cold as ice because the light of the Christian deity and
&gt; its loving warmth could not be felt by the most damned of all. While I
&gt; doubt Neil was giving a nod to Dante, I thought it worthy of
&gt; mentioning another literary example that employed the similar
&gt; symbolism even though it is a slightly different usage.)
">

I didn't pick up on that specifically as I would always grapple with the
idea of the cold fire which is the same point. This is one of my fave
Rush tunes as the lyrics really express the concept well and the music
is great too.

Neil has a hard time imagining a woman smarter than he is:

Neil Peart (from Network Magazine, November 1993): &quot;In 'Cold Fire' I
have the woman speaking to the man and she's smarter than he is. It was
a difficult technical challenge lyrically, but those are the kind of
things that now, after all these years, you start to feel you have the
craft to take on. I don't mind writing about love now, where I would
have avoided that in the previous years just because of the inability to
get beyond cliches.&quot;

He's intelligent and uses that sometimes against the listener. For
instance a random lyric from BTW. &quot;You know how that rabbit feels going
under your spinning wheels&quot;. Well not many Rush fans have driven over
rabbits so he must be saying something else. ( cats would have been a more
common animal to run over maybe )

Aerosmith had the rabbit don't die lyric years earlier. Which was an old
medical way to tell if a girl was pregnant cause if the rabbit died the baby
was on the way. So in fact this was a subtle way in which Rush could make
fun of Aerosmith and their silly lyrics. And that is only one example of how
Neil's lyrics are so great.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I'll be around
&gt;&gt; &gt; If you don't let me down

&gt;&gt; &gt; Next verse:

&gt;&gt; &gt; It was just before sunrise
&gt;&gt; &gt; When we started on traditional roles
&gt;&gt; &gt; She said &quot;Sure, I'll be your partner
&gt;&gt; &gt; But don't make too many demands.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I said &quot;If love has these conditions,
&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't understand those songs you love.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; She said &quot;This is not a love song
&gt;&gt; &gt; This isn't fantasyland.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; Reinforces the terms of the contract, reminding him that the women's
&gt;&gt; &gt; movement has brought some changes since his mom and dad made similar
&gt;&gt; &gt; arrangements.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Now here is where my confusion comes in, the chorus:

&gt;&gt; &gt; Don't go too far
&gt;&gt; &gt; A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire
&gt;&gt; &gt; Don't cross the line
&gt;&gt; &gt; The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
&gt;&gt; &gt; Don't let me down
&gt;&gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
&gt;&gt; &gt; Don't break the spell
&gt;&gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

&gt;&gt; &gt; This is like the story has moved forward in time and we see events that
&gt;&gt; &gt; seem to be the end of the relationship.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The lines alternate with her requests and then scenes from the
&gt;&gt; &gt; relationship. The tropical sea could be a honeymoon scene, pattern of
&gt;&gt; &gt; moonlight on the bedroom floor could be a period of contentment in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; coupling.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of the pawnbrokers diamond seems to be a detail
&gt;&gt; &gt; that neither of them are materialistic OR the relationship is over and
&gt;&gt; &gt; she has pawned the wedding ring.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door states that it's over.
&gt;&gt; &gt; The relationship is as dead as a &quot;cold&quot; fire.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Now that is one way to read it but sometimes I see it as &quot;cold fire&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; being for the period in a marriage after the wild passion has passed.
&gt;&gt; &gt; The fire is still there but it is practical and realistic, not
&gt;&gt; &gt; romantical or overly emotional.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The song reflects a mature relationship built on the ground rules of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; chorus. In this interpretation you have to sort of discount the running
&gt;&gt; &gt; for the door as not being the end but a rough patch that reinforces her
&gt;&gt; &gt; terms.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Thoughts?

&gt;&gt;    Holy Diver that was deep! Just don't let Neil get inside your head.

&gt; I have been listening to that song for years, Double R, and it stuck in
&gt; my head. Neil sometimes writes these lyrics that immediately (or over
&gt; repeated listenings) bond with your grey matter.

I'm looking forward to your analysis of Between Sun &amp; Moon and Double Agent,
Art. Not that there is necessarily anything there to analyze. I wouldn't know. I
stopped paying attention to Rush lyrics at Roll The Bones. But I really dig
those two songs. My favorites on CP.

&gt; &gt; &gt; OK. I have really liked this song since it came out but the lyrics have

&gt; &gt; &gt; alt.music.rush denizens. If this has been discussed before and this has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been run into the ground, I apologize.

&gt; &gt; &gt; First off, is this a love song or a break up song?

&gt; &gt; I think it is a song about the notion of love and how that notion
&gt; &gt; fares over time in a relationship. He introduces the elements of the
&gt; &gt; first two verses with phrases that serve two purposes. &quot;Long after
&gt; &gt; midnight&quot; and &quot;just before sunrise&quot; obviously relate to the aspect of
&gt; &gt; time, but they also relate to how one time period provides a sense of
&gt; &gt; protective darkness and concealment in which the dreamlike notions of
&gt; &gt; love can survive, while the other is a period during which the light
&gt; &gt; of reality is certain to cast its glare on the dreamlike quality of
&gt; &gt; the initial aspects of a new relationship. Long after midnight,
&gt; &gt; concepts such as unconditional love and boundless hearts enter the
&gt; &gt; conversation. However, even during the initial phase of the dialogue,
&gt; &gt; the fact that the notion of love cannot transcend an individual's
&gt; &gt; limits is introduced. Just before sunrise, the aspect of traditional
&gt; &gt; roles and resultant demands begin to have a stifling effect on the
&gt; &gt; relationship.  I feel the reality of the limits introduced in the
&gt; &gt; first verse are further stressed by segment which ties the first two
&gt; &gt; verses together; stating that people have limits and cannot often
&gt; &gt; endure being let down by their partners merely reinforces the fact
&gt; &gt; that the notion of love and its supposedly unconditional and boundless
&gt; &gt; aspects cannot exist when the notion meets reality. Thus, the notion
&gt; &gt; of love changes as soon as someone experiences it because to
&gt; &gt; experience it makes it a reality rather than a concept.

&gt; I agree, VOR. A maturing relationship and reality are usually completely
&gt; at odds with saving the damsel in distress and prince charming.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Neil starts out with

&gt; &gt; &gt; It was long after midnight
&gt; &gt; &gt; When we got to unconditional love
&gt; &gt; &gt; She said &quot;Sure, my heart is boundless
&gt; &gt; &gt; But don't push my limits too far.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I said &quot;If love was so transcendant
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't understand these boundaries.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; She said &quot;Just don't disappoint me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; You know how complex women are.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously this is a later stage of a courtship here. This man and woman
&gt; &gt; &gt; are contemplating marriage (I suppose) or at least monogamy. She tells
&gt; &gt; &gt; him she digs him but if he screws around on her then that digging could
&gt; &gt; &gt; decrease significantly. He starts to bargain but she holds firm to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; groundwork of the relationship and says in the chorus that she will be
&gt; &gt; &gt; here as long as he isn't too much of an ass:

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll be around
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you don't let me down too far
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll be around
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you don't let me down

&gt; &gt; &gt; Next verse:

&gt; &gt; &gt; It was just before sunrise
&gt; &gt; &gt; When we started on traditional roles
&gt; &gt; &gt; She said &quot;Sure, I'll be your partner
&gt; &gt; &gt; But don't make too many demands.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Reinforces the terms of the contract, reminding him that the women's
&gt; &gt; &gt; movement has brought some changes since his mom and dad made similar
&gt; &gt; &gt; arrangements.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Now here is where my confusion comes in, the chorus:

&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't go too far
&gt; &gt; &gt; A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire
&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't cross the line
&gt; &gt; &gt; The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't let me down
&gt; &gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't break the spell
&gt; &gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

&gt; &gt; I think this is the most creative lyrical passage from the song
&gt; &gt; because it has a meaning that most people would overlook. He has used
&gt; &gt; specific examples of light producing instances - phosphorescent waves,
&gt; &gt; moonlight, the center of a diamond, and the look in an exiting lover's
&gt; &gt; eyes. The first three are events in which light is emitted with no
&gt; &gt; heat. We generally associate light with producing heat, so it is
&gt; &gt; intentional that he would choose examples which produce no heat
&gt; &gt; because heat is associated with passion. Phosphorescence, moonlight,
&gt; &gt; and the glint of a diamond can seem bright, yet they emit no warmth.
&gt; &gt; The same would be true as you look into your lover's eyes as he or she
&gt; &gt; is leaving you. (This use of the absence of heat associated with light
&gt; &gt; was also used by Dante in The Divine Comedy. The innermost circle of
&gt; &gt; Hell was as cold as ice because the light of the Christian deity and
&gt; &gt; its loving warmth could not be felt by the most damned of all. While I
&gt; &gt; doubt Neil was giving a nod to Dante, I thought it worthy of
&gt; &gt; mentioning another literary example that employed the similar
&gt; &gt; symbolism even though it is a slightly different usage.)

&gt; I didn't pick up on that specifically as I would always grapple with the
&gt; idea of the cold fire which is the same point. This is one of my fave
&gt; Rush tunes as the lyrics really express the concept well and the music
&gt; is great too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is like the story has moved forward in time and we see events that
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be the end of the relationship.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The lines alternate with her requests and then scenes from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship. The tropical sea could be a honeymoon scene, pattern of
&gt; &gt; &gt; moonlight on the bedroom floor could be a period of contentment in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; coupling.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of the pawnbrokers diamond seems to be a detail
&gt; &gt; &gt; that neither of them are materialistic OR the relationship is over and
&gt; &gt; &gt; she has pawned the wedding ring.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door states that it's over.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The relationship is as dead as a &quot;cold&quot; fire.

&gt; &gt; &gt; terms.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thoughts?

&gt; &gt; I very much enjoyed reading your interpretation, Art. I think you made
&gt; &gt; many valid points. I also liked your take on the term &quot;cold fire&quot; as
&gt; &gt; it relates to the change toward the practical.

&gt; &gt; Why didn't you mention the last part of the song?

&gt; Love is blind if you are gentle
&gt; Love can turn to a long, cold burn...

&gt; I was still stuck trying to nail down what came before to try and figure
&gt; those lines out.

&gt; What do they say to you?- Hide quoted text -

Well, I think those two lines end the song perfectly because they
reinforce the bulk of his lyrical message. The lines are true, and it
is important one understands they are true. That is possibly why he
intentionally placed them last in the song. A long, cold burn is more
substantial and richer in a myriad of ways when compared to a roaring
fire of emotion which will inevitably burn itself out because it is
inherently irrational and lacks a footing in reality.

&gt; &gt; In other words, you guys are a bunch of women.

&gt; &gt; QED   :-P

&gt; &gt; Rob (!Petard)

&gt; Neil has a hard time imagining a woman smarter than he is:

&gt; Neil Peart (from Network Magazine, November 1993): &quot;In 'Cold Fire' I
&gt; have the woman speaking to the man and she's smarter than he is. It was
&gt; a difficult technical challenge lyrically, but those are the kind of
&gt; things that now, after all these years, you start to feel you have the
&gt; craft to take on. I don't mind writing about love now, where I would
&gt; have avoided that in the previous years just because of the inability to
&gt; get beyond cliches.&quot;- Hide quoted text -

I do not think Neil would have a hard time imagining a woman of equal
or greater intelligence. When he said writing the song was a
&quot;difficult technical challenge lyrically,&quot; I believe he was referring
to how difficult it is to write a song about love in general without
sounding smarmy or trite.

I find it VERY interesting that YOU think he would have difficulties
imagining a woman being smarter than him. Sounds like transference to
me, Art? ;-)

I think you should start a series of topics to analyze every Rush song
in alphabetical order.

&gt; &gt; I have been listening to that song for years, Double R, and it stuck in
&gt; &gt; my head. Neil sometimes writes these lyrics that immediately (or over
&gt; &gt; repeated listenings) bond with your grey matter.

&gt;   He's intelligent and uses that sometimes against the listener. For
&gt; instance a random lyric from BTW. &quot;You know how that rabbit feels going
&gt; under your spinning wheels&quot;. Well not many Rush fans have driven over
&gt; rabbits so he must be saying something else. ( cats would have been a more
&gt; common animal to run over maybe )

&gt;   Aerosmith had the rabbit don't die lyric years earlier. Which was an old
&gt; medical way to tell if a girl was pregnant cause if the rabbit died the baby
&gt; was on the way. So in fact this was a subtle way in which Rush could make
&gt; fun of Aerosmith and their silly lyrics. And that is only one example of how
&gt; Neil's lyrics are so great.

Aerosmith did a fine job of making themselves a joke but Neil was a true
visionary to see that coming, Double R.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Don't break the spell
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This is like the story has moved forward in time and we see events that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; seem to be the end of the relationship.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The lines alternate with her requests and then scenes from the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; relationship. The tropical sea could be a honeymoon scene, pattern of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; moonlight on the bedroom floor could be a period of contentment in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; coupling.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of the pawnbrokers diamond seems to be a detail
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that neither of them are materialistic OR the relationship is over and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; she has pawned the wedding ring.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door states that it's over.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The relationship is as dead as a &quot;cold&quot; fire.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now that is one way to read it but sometimes I see it as &quot;cold fire&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; being for the period in a marriage after the wild passion has passed.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The fire is still there but it is practical and realistic, not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; romantical or overly emotional.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The song reflects a mature relationship built on the ground rules of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chorus. In this interpretation you have to sort of discount the running
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for the door as not being the end but a rough patch that reinforces her
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; terms.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thoughts?

&gt; &gt;&gt;    Holy Diver that was deep! Just don't let Neil get inside your head.

&gt; &gt; I have been listening to that song for years, Double R, and it stuck in
&gt; &gt; my head. Neil sometimes writes these lyrics that immediately (or over
&gt; &gt; repeated listenings) bond with your grey matter.

&gt; I'm looking forward to your analysis of Between Sun &amp; Moon and Double Agent,
&gt; Art. Not that there is necessarily anything there to analyze. I wouldn't
&gt; know. I
&gt; stopped paying attention to Rush lyrics at Roll The Bones. But I really dig
&gt; those two songs. My favorites on CP.
">

Those songs are good and I liked the entire cd when it came out but only
&quot;Cold Fire&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot; are the only songs whose lyrics have
stuck all this time. &quot;Animate&quot; was a good tune too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK. I have really liked this song since it came out but the lyrics have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always seemed a bit hard to completely nail down just exactly where Neil
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is going. I would appreciate any thoughts on the subject from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alt.music.rush denizens. If this has been discussed before and this has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been run into the ground, I apologize.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First off, is this a love song or a break up song?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it is a song about the notion of love and how that notion
&gt; &gt; &gt; fares over time in a relationship. He introduces the elements of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; first two verses with phrases that serve two purposes. &quot;Long after
&gt; &gt; &gt; midnight&quot; and &quot;just before sunrise&quot; obviously relate to the aspect of
&gt; &gt; &gt; time, but they also relate to how one time period provides a sense of
&gt; &gt; &gt; protective darkness and concealment in which the dreamlike notions of
&gt; &gt; &gt; love can survive, while the other is a period during which the light
&gt; &gt; &gt; of reality is certain to cast its glare on the dreamlike quality of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the initial aspects of a new relationship. Long after midnight,
&gt; &gt; &gt; concepts such as unconditional love and boundless hearts enter the
&gt; &gt; &gt; conversation. However, even during the initial phase of the dialogue,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fact that the notion of love cannot transcend an individual's
&gt; &gt; &gt; limits is introduced. Just before sunrise, the aspect of traditional
&gt; &gt; &gt; roles and resultant demands begin to have a stifling effect on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship.  I feel the reality of the limits introduced in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; first verse are further stressed by segment which ties the first two
&gt; &gt; &gt; verses together; stating that people have limits and cannot often
&gt; &gt; &gt; endure being let down by their partners merely reinforces the fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the notion of love and its supposedly unconditional and boundless
&gt; &gt; &gt; aspects cannot exist when the notion meets reality. Thus, the notion
&gt; &gt; &gt; of love changes as soon as someone experiences it because to
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience it makes it a reality rather than a concept.

&gt; &gt; I agree, VOR. A maturing relationship and reality are usually completely
&gt; &gt; at odds with saving the damsel in distress and prince charming.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Neil starts out with

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was long after midnight
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When we got to unconditional love
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She said &quot;Sure, my heart is boundless
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But don't push my limits too far.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I said &quot;If love was so transcendant
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't understand these boundaries.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She said &quot;Just don't disappoint me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You know how complex women are.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously this is a later stage of a courtship here. This man and woman
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are contemplating marriage (I suppose) or at least monogamy. She tells
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him she digs him but if he screws around on her then that digging could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decrease significantly. He starts to bargain but she holds firm to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; groundwork of the relationship and says in the chorus that she will be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here as long as he isn't too much of an ass:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll be around
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you don't let me down too far
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll be around
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you don't let me down

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next verse:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was just before sunrise
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When we started on traditional roles
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She said &quot;Sure, I'll be your partner
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But don't make too many demands.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I said &quot;If love has these conditions,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't understand those songs you love.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She said &quot;This is not a love song
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This isn't fantasyland.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reinforces the terms of the contract, reminding him that the women's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; movement has brought some changes since his mom and dad made similar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arrangements.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now here is where my confusion comes in, the chorus:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't go too far
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't cross the line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't let me down
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't break the spell
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the most creative lyrical passage from the song
&gt; &gt; &gt; because it has a meaning that most people would overlook. He has used
&gt; &gt; &gt; specific examples of light producing instances - phosphorescent waves,
&gt; &gt; &gt; moonlight, the center of a diamond, and the look in an exiting lover's
&gt; &gt; &gt; eyes. The first three are events in which light is emitted with no
&gt; &gt; &gt; heat. We generally associate light with producing heat, so it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; intentional that he would choose examples which produce no heat
&gt; &gt; &gt; because heat is associated with passion. Phosphorescence, moonlight,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the glint of a diamond can seem bright, yet they emit no warmth.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The same would be true as you look into your lover's eyes as he or she
&gt; &gt; &gt; is leaving you. (This use of the absence of heat associated with light
&gt; &gt; &gt; was also used by Dante in The Divine Comedy. The innermost circle of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hell was as cold as ice because the light of the Christian deity and
&gt; &gt; &gt; its loving warmth could not be felt by the most damned of all. While I
&gt; &gt; &gt; doubt Neil was giving a nod to Dante, I thought it worthy of
&gt; &gt; &gt; mentioning another literary example that employed the similar
&gt; &gt; &gt; symbolism even though it is a slightly different usage.)

&gt; &gt; I didn't pick up on that specifically as I would always grapple with the
&gt; &gt; idea of the cold fire which is the same point. This is one of my fave
&gt; &gt; Rush tunes as the lyrics really express the concept well and the music
&gt; &gt; is great too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is like the story has moved forward in time and we see events that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be the end of the relationship.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The lines alternate with her requests and then scenes from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationship. The tropical sea could be a honeymoon scene, pattern of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moonlight on the bedroom floor could be a period of contentment in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coupling.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of the pawnbrokers diamond seems to be a detail
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that neither of them are materialistic OR the relationship is over and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she has pawned the wedding ring.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door states that it's over.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The relationship is as dead as a &quot;cold&quot; fire.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now that is one way to read it but sometimes I see it as &quot;cold fire&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being for the period in a marriage after the wild passion has passed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fire is still there but it is practical and realistic, not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; romantical or overly emotional.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The song reflects a mature relationship built on the ground rules of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chorus. In this interpretation you have to sort of discount the running
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the door as not being the end but a rough patch that reinforces her
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terms.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thoughts?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I very much enjoyed reading your interpretation, Art. I think you made
&gt; &gt; &gt; many valid points. I also liked your take on the term &quot;cold fire&quot; as
&gt; &gt; &gt; it relates to the change toward the practical.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Why didn't you mention the last part of the song?

&gt; &gt; Love is blind if you are gentle
&gt; &gt; Love can turn to a long, cold burn...

&gt; &gt; I was still stuck trying to nail down what came before to try and figure
&gt; &gt; those lines out.

&gt; &gt; What do they say to you?- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; Well, I think those two lines end the song perfectly because they
&gt; reinforce the bulk of his lyrical message. The lines are true, and it
&gt; is important one understands they are true. That is possibly why he
&gt; intentionally placed them last in the song. A long, cold burn is more
&gt; substantial and richer in a myriad of ways when compared to a roaring
&gt; fire of emotion which will inevitably burn itself out because it is
&gt; inherently irrational and lacks a footing in reality.

Definitely.

I think I will delve far back in the catalog for my next discussion
thread.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Rob (!Petard)

&gt; &gt; Neil has a hard time imagining a woman smarter than he is:

&gt; &gt; Neil Peart (from Network Magazine, November 1993): &quot;In 'Cold Fire' I
&gt; &gt; have the woman speaking to the man and she's smarter than he is. It was
&gt; &gt; a difficult technical challenge lyrically, but those are the kind of
&gt; &gt; things that now, after all these years, you start to feel you have the
&gt; &gt; craft to take on. I don't mind writing about love now, where I would
&gt; &gt; have avoided that in the previous years just because of the inability to
&gt; &gt; get beyond cliches.&quot;- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; I do not think Neil would have a hard time imagining a woman of equal
&gt; or greater intelligence. When he said writing the song was a
&gt; &quot;difficult technical challenge lyrically,&quot; I believe he was referring
&gt; to how difficult it is to write a song about love in general without
&gt; sounding smarmy or trite.

I have additional songs I intend to discuss but not all of them. I think

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; been run into the ground, I apologize.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; First off, is this a love song or a break up song?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Neil starts out with

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It was long after midnight
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When we got to unconditional love
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; She said &quot;Sure, my heart is boundless
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But don't push my limits too far.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I said &quot;If love was so transcendant
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't understand these boundaries.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; She said &quot;Just don't disappoint me,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You know how complex women are.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Obviously this is a later stage of a courtship here. This man and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; woman
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are contemplating marriage (I suppose) or at least monogamy. She
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tells
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; him she digs him but if he screws around on her then that digging
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; could
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; decrease significantly. He starts to bargain but she holds firm to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; groundwork of the relationship and says in the chorus that she will
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; here as long as he isn't too much of an ass:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'll be around
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you don't let me down too far
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'll be around
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you don't let me down

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Next verse:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It was just before sunrise
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When we started on traditional roles
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; She said &quot;Sure, I'll be your partner
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But don't make too many demands.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I said &quot;If love has these conditions,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don't understand those songs you love.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; She said &quot;This is not a love song
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This isn't fantasyland.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Reinforces the terms of the contract, reminding him that the women's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; movement has brought some changes since his mom and dad made similar
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; arrangements.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now here is where my confusion comes in, the chorus:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Don't go too far
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Don't cross the line
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Don't let me down
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Don't break the spell
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This is like the story has moved forward in time and we see events
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; seem to be the end of the relationship.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The lines alternate with her requests and then scenes from the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; relationship. The tropical sea could be a honeymoon scene, pattern
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; moonlight on the bedroom floor could be a period of contentment in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; coupling.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The flame at the heart of the pawnbrokers diamond seems to be a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; detail
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that neither of them are materialistic OR the relationship is over
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; she has pawned the wedding ring.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The look in your eyes as you head for the door states that it's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; over.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The relationship is as dead as a &quot;cold&quot; fire.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now that is one way to read it but sometimes I see it as &quot;cold fire&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; being for the period in a marriage after the wild passion has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; passed.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The fire is still there but it is practical and realistic, not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; romantical or overly emotional.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The song reflects a mature relationship built on the ground rules of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chorus. In this interpretation you have to sort of discount the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; running
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for the door as not being the end but a rough patch that reinforces
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; her
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; terms.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thoughts?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    Holy Diver that was deep! Just don't let Neil get inside your head.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I have been listening to that song for years, Double R, and it stuck in
&gt;&gt; &gt; my head. Neil sometimes writes these lyrics that immediately (or over
&gt;&gt; &gt; repeated listenings) bond with your grey matter.

&gt;&gt;   He's intelligent and uses that sometimes against the listener. For
&gt;&gt; instance a random lyric from BTW. &quot;You know how that rabbit feels going
&gt;&gt; under your spinning wheels&quot;. Well not many Rush fans have driven over
&gt;&gt; rabbits so he must be saying something else. ( cats would have been a
&gt;&gt; more
&gt;&gt; common animal to run over maybe )

&gt;&gt;   Aerosmith had the rabbit don't die lyric years earlier. Which was an
&gt;&gt; old
&gt;&gt; medical way to tell if a girl was pregnant cause if the rabbit died the
&gt;&gt; baby
&gt;&gt; was on the way. So in fact this was a subtle way in which Rush could make
&gt;&gt; fun of Aerosmith and their silly lyrics. And that is only one example of
&gt;&gt; how
&gt;&gt; Neil's lyrics are so great.

&gt; Aerosmith did a fine job of making themselves a joke but Neil was a true
&gt; visionary to see that coming, Double R.
">

After &quot;Rocks&quot; Aerosmith lost it. There are some great early songs by
them.

&gt; &gt; Are Dan Rather or Katie Couric considered trolls, Rob?

&gt; Yes, actually.   After Memogate, I'd call Dan a troll.

Still learning the game hereabouts.  ;-)

I have learned that insinuating mild misogyny on Neil's part is not
popular, GFT.
