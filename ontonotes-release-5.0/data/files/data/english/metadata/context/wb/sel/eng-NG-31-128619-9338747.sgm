An artful fusion of materials and technology define new mid-range
handsets. Nokia 6500 Slide wraps third-generation features in
innovative, highly detailed design. The Nokia 6500 Silde is a tribute
to high mobile technology and aesthetics. This sleek and stylish phone
is easy on pocket without any compromise on features. It comes in
silver and black casing and large keys make navigation easy. The Nokia
6500 Slide is one of two 6500 series devices that were announced side
by side back in May of this year. Unlike the very thin and simple
Nokia 6500 Classic, the Nokia 6500 Slide has a slider form factor of
Nokia 6500, stainless steel body work, and an auto-focus digital
camera that uses Carl Zeiss lenses. This is a great-looking phone and
it's very easy to use. If you're looking for something more advanced
then check out the Nokia 6120 classic smartphone, which has video
calling and some other extra features. But if you want something a bit
less complicated that looks great and still has the benefit of 3G
downloads then this could be the phone for you.

Designed with maximum usability in mind with large keys and
ergonomically correct and balanced proportions, this phone is just
what you're looking for. The Nokia 6500 Slide mobile phone features an
enthusiast-quality 3.2-megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss optics and the
ability to easily share pictures, videos and even video calls on a
television. The Nokia 6500 Slide brings unsurpassed levels of imaging
and sharing and delivers a refined tactile experience with its elegant
brushed stainless steel finish and smooth slide mechanism. Nokia 6500
slide has dual-band 3G support in addition to quad-band GSM support,
Nokia 6500 slide has a built-in 3.2 megapixel auto-focus camera, and a
solid media player. Nokia 6500 slide is also quite attractive and uses
a QVGA resolution display that can show up to 16 million different
color shades. Other features of the new Nokia slider include 2.2 inch
color screen with QVGA resolution, dual LED flash, 8x digital zoom, TV-
Out, 2nd camera, music player and FM tuner. Measurements of the Nokia
6500 slide are 96.5×46.5×16.4mm.

Fashioned to stand apart from the crowd, the Nokia 6500 slide
incorporates a number of design elements not often found in a mid-
range device. Ensuring that the sophisticated brushed stainless steel
body retains its timeless beauty, a unique hard coating helps to
prevent scuffs, scratches, and even fingerprints. Precision
engineering of the slide mechanism means that the Nokia 6500 slide
feels solid in the hand, yet moves with a smooth, fluid action to
create a decidedly upscale user impression. The 3.2 megapixel camera
with Carl Zeiss optics found in the Nokia 6500 slide marks the first
time that mid-range camera phone consumers have been able to
experience the outstanding imaging capability of Carl Zeiss optics.
The addition of autofocus, a dual LED flash and 8x digital zoom
optimizes the Nokia 6500 slide for creating high-caliber images. Using
the speed of 3G technology, these images and videos can be quickly
shared with friends around the world, while the TV-out jack allows
them to be instantly viewed on any television with standard RCA
inputs. The TV-out feature can also be used to allow an entire group
of people to simultaneously enjoy the fun of video calling. The Nokia
6500 slide has a micro USB connector to connect to a PC and you can
also charge the handset via this connection. With support for
Bluetooth 2.0 you can also listen to your favourite tunes wirelessly
with a compatible Bluetooth headset. There may only be 20MB of memory
on board, but Nokia supplies the phone with a 256MB microSD card that
sits in a slot under the stainless steel battery cover. The slot can
actually accept cards of up to 4GB in size and you'll certainly want
to add some extra storage space to take advantage of the phone's music
player. Although the music player and camera are good, the most
surprising feature of all on this handset is perhaps its TV output. In
the box you'll find an AV lead that connects to the headphone socket
at the top of the phone. Hook it up to your TV and the phone's display
will be mirrored on your telly. You can then use your TV to view
photos and videos or to listen to music. It's a cutting edge feature
and works surprisingly well. The phone's battery life is also good as
you can get around six hours of talk time from it and the reception
and call quality are also very impressive.
