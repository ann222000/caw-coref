I realize this isn't a Leopard-specific list, but I was hoping someone
here might know how to accomplish this. In order to print to a Windows
print server, does the iMac have to be configured for Active Directory?
What about a print driver (it's an HP Laserjet 4730mfp?) The printer is
attached to the network, but there are firewall restrictions in place
that prevent me from printing directly to the printer.

Thanks,

Eric

Can you please describe these firewall restrictions?

I got the most important firewall restriction lifted (port 9100) and
was able to get the printer to work by printing directly to it. That
still leaves an interesting question: How do you get a Mac to print to
a printer attached to an Active Directory enabled Windows server?

Also, though the printer now prints, it won't print in color. I tried
the Generic Postscript driver, and the most recent 4730mfp driver.
Both insist on printing in black and white. Windows PCs print in color
with no problem.

Thanks for taking the time...

Eric

Depends on what's required by your pc setups.  In Mac Help, look up
Directory Access or LDAP for some good reading.  But most windoze
networks just use smb/cifs for printer sharing.  Articles such as
&quot;Setting up to print to a printer shared by a Windows computer via
SMB/CIFS&quot; within the Mac Help system are quite good.

Thanks for the pointer, Dan. I support a few Macs here at work, but I
don't have one at my desk, so I'll have to check it out when I get home.
A friend who supports considerably more Macs than I do has told me that
you *do* need to log in to Active Directory, but that may not be quite
as environment altering as it is on a Windows box. I just don't want
said user's environment drastically changing because he has to log into
an AD server.

Thanks,

Eric
