Yup.  Though if that advert post appeared only here, it's not really
spam.  I tend to dislike the widening def. of 'spam' to include stuff
that's not posted widely.  Especially an ad for an on-topic product,
posted *openly* by the advertiser.  I know many dislike any ads in
their newsgroups, and I've no problem with that--but ads such as the
OP in this thread don't bother me much.  Not at all in the same league
with the genuine spammers who send out millions of UCEs with
completely fake 'from' addresses or (often the same slimes) those who
put the same post on hundreds of usenet groups, again with completely
faked-up attributions.

I don't mind ads in usenet groups.  But, I'm not gonna plunk down 399.00
(Pounds)  = $776.45  US for a Chargriller I can pick up at HD for $135.00.

(anyone want one?  I'm selling for $300.00  US.  (save $476.00))

&gt; They suck.  Don't get one.

Why do they suck? The fish hanger looks good for Peking Duck. The
extensions would need to be built from good steel or metal to avoid
leaking. I wish Weber would come up with something like this. A problem
could be its ability to create uniform heat all the way up but with fish
or birds it seems the mass of the cut would be down lower near the fire.

Do you want me to forward them to you?  USENET is a non-commercial
discussion area for various topics.  Let one advertiser in and they will all
want to crap up the place.  Give an inch and there will be hundreds of ads
for detergents, cars, Wal Mart, K Mart, etc.  No, this is not the place for
them.
