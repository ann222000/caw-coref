Greek 'treasures' expected from Herculaneum

At one o'clock on the morning of August 25, 79AD, a blast of burning
gas and a wave of molten mud engulfed Herculaneum, preserving the only
Ancient Roman library that has ever been found.

Now, archaeologists are finally hoping to excavate tens of thousands
of scrolls, which may include lost works by Aristotle, Sophocles and
Catullus. Excavation work has restarted on the famous Villa dei Papyri
after an eight-year gap.

&quot;It is impossible, absolutely impossible, to excavate this villa
without finding fantastic things,&quot; said Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, the
director of the Herculaneum Conservation Project. &quot;We may find the
lost scrolls of Aristotle, or we may find something even more exciting
that we had not even thought of yet.&quot;

Of the 100 plays written by Sophocles, only seven have ever been
found. Euripides also wrote 100 plays, the vast majority of which have
been lost.

The enormous villa, which lies just outside Herculaneum, belonged to
Lucius Calpurnius Piso, Julius Caesar's father-in-law. Around 1,800
scrolls, of middling importance, have been recovered since the villa
was found 250 years ago, but archaeologists have only recently
discovered two extra floors to the building.

Work on the site halted in 1999 after a previous excavation because of
fears about the conservation of the site. Because the site lies four
metres below the waterline, it is constantly flooded. In addition, the
previous dig unearthed an unexpected complex of buildings that needed
urgent restoration.

Meanwhile, the first work on the main site of Herculaneum for almost
30 years could begin as early as next year, with the aim of unearthing
a collection of public records that will reveal the daily life of the
city.

Unlike Pompeii, Herculaneum was almost perfectly preserved after the
eruption of Vesuvius, down to the tiniest detail. However, the site,
which was only discovered by mistake during the 18th century, mostly
lies underneath a modern-day suburb of Naples.

&quot;The parts we have excavated so far are only around a third of the
entire site,&quot; said Mr Wallace-Hadrill. &quot;But it is a bit difficult to
expropriate the land to excavate the Villa dei Papyri, since it lies
underneath the modern town hall,&quot; he joked.

&quot;Many of the cellars of the modern houses are only a metre or so above
the Ancient Roman ruins,&quot; he added. The grotty tenements of modern
Herculaneum lean precariously over the excavation site. The area is
now a stronghold of the Camorra, or Neapolitan Mafia, and buying up
land to continue excavating has been near-impossible.

However, Mr Wallace-Hadrill revealed that digging on the Basilica
would begin next year. &quot;The breakthrough was that two palazzi
collapsed last year, which convinced the residents above that it was
not safe,&quot; he said.

The new excavation work will be funded by a £1.5 million grant from
the Packard Humanities Institute, founded by a scion of Hewlett
Packard computer empire. The work on the Villa dei Papyri is being
funded by a £2 million-a-year grant from the European Union and the
Region of Campania.

&quot;We know what is underneath because of tunnels dug in the 18th
century, which brought up all sorts of statues and frescoes,&quot; said Mr
Wallace-Hadrill. The Basilica, which would have served as a town
meeting hall, should contain public records of life in Herculaneum
that would be invaluable to classical historians.

Last year, the first complete painted statue ever found, the bust of
an Amazon warrior, was unearthed from near the Basilica.
