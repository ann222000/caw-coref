My organization is working with our County, local city officials and
others to collaboratively create a County-Wide Solid Waste Managment
Plan.  We would like to clearly lay out the roles and responsibilities
of both the crafters (the collaborators, including the County) and the
implementers (the County Commissioners) regarding the plan.  It looks
as if there is no statute or law giving the County the right to
designate/convene such an institutionalized group (a Citizens Advisory
Committee) whose recommendations would be implemented.  The County is
in support of this project; they have funded the process described
above, but the collaborators are interested in clearly stating rights
and roles.
What sort of document might be appropriate to dictate roles and
responsibilities, ensuring that the recommendations of the committee
will be implemented by the County, whenever appropriate, if we are not
able to form a legally/technically defined Citizens Advisory Committee?

Seems to me that setting up an advisory committee to make
recommendations is an ordinary, customary thing typically done by
resolution or ordinance or bill.  I doubt the Commissioners need any
special authority to do that.

But are you saying you want the County Commissioners to agree in
advance to implement whatever the "Citizens Advisory Committee" recommends?

This sort of thing sometimes does happen, but (I'm no lawyer, not
giving legal advice!) I think it would be unusual and subject to
challenge because it would amount to the Commissioners delegating
their authority to another body.

I've been a member of numerous citizens advisory boards, most in
Manhattan.  They've been set up in numerous ways.  The first was an
outgrowth of an offiicial citizens' advisory committee set up under
208 water quality planning by EPA in the 1970s.  It lasted another 10
years or so, held forums and advised the city council, and for one
year advised the City DEP officially.  This body was voluntary and
everyone was accepted for membership.  I used this body to propose and
help pass legislation to eliminate 2200 apartment building
incinerators in New York City (signed 1989, implemented 1993).

The NYC Sanitation dept. set up five CAC's (one for each borough) to
evaluate its incinerator plans and then Local Law 19 of 1989 set up
five citizens' solid waste advisory boards plus a citywide recycling
advisory board.  I have the parts of Local Law 19 on my website,
below.  These were strictly advisory and the Sanitation dept. would
sometimes send an employee to meetings, but mostly ignored the boards
and its recommendations.  The City Council paid attention and often
agreed with the boards.  I was on Manhattan's since 1988 as chair for
2 and vice chair for 6, and the citywide since 1990, having testified
numerous times and having secured funding for the boards from the City
Council a few years ago.  For most of the time, these bodies decided
for themselves how to organize themselves, what was important to
debate, which items to testify to the city council about, and so
forth.  Recently the Manhattan board underwent major change, and many
of the long-standing members, most of whom had been leaders, either
didn't reapply or were outright rejected by the Manhattan Borough
President, when they reapplied for membership (an unprecedented action
for any of the boards), and were replaced by business and real estate
interests.  More about some of these boards and LL19 are on one of my
websites: http://geography.hunter.cuny.edu/~mclarke/WPComm.htm The
bodies have been responsible for recommending important improvements
to the city's waste prevention and recycling programs and solid waste
management plans that have been eventually implemented (e.g., weekly
recycling, targeting bulk paper) though credit to the bodies was never
given.  Many members left the bodies along the way because it was
thankless.

In Philadelphia there is a RAC (Recycling advisory committee, I
believe).  I have fewer details on this, but I understand that in the
beginning, this was a very powerful body that created recycling policy
for the city, and the City's Streets dept. would implement the
policies that the RAC created.  This was later changed, and I'm not
sure what happened to the body after that.

Colleen:

In our practice we often work with Citizen Advisory Committees (CAC's) and
have been instrumental in establishing them for some of our projects. We use
CACs to do planning, develop programming, evaluate programming, and even to
establish locational siting criteria in facility siting projects.

I am not aware of any unit of government that can not establish such a
committee.

However, both the government sponsor and the citizens must remember that
these committees are 'Advisory'.  No unit of government will, or should,
delegate its decision-making authority to a non-elected body. It falls upon
the CAC to maintain sufficient credibility and integrity to give its advice
weight before the elected officials and it is the responsibility of the
elected officials to give the CAC a reasonable charge and the resources
necessary for the committee to develop its advice.

It is rare that the unit of government adopt the CAC's recommendations
verbatim and it is equally rare for the unit of government to totally ignore
the advice of the CAC.

Colleen,

I have mixed feelings and mixed results with CAC's.  I was glad to read what
JW wrote below because it makes some important points that are the roots of
my frustration with CAC's.

When JW says: " However, . the citizens must remember that these committees
are 'Advisory' . No unit of government will, or should, delegate its
decision-making authority to a non-elected body .  It falls upon the CAC to
maintain sufficient credibility and integrity ."

The bottom-line is that if the government creates the CAC, then the
government is the overlord with the power and freedom to censor your work.
What fun is that?  Seriously, we are all busy in life, and getting the
public to join these committees, only to watch the government officials do
nothing with all their work is a very frustrating experience.  (I'm not
saying that always happens!!)

My suggestion is that any sort of CAC gets created as an independent public
body that reports directly to the top. city manager, mayor, whomever . and
that the government put at the CAC disposal a staff support person for at
least 8 hours/week so facilitate the group functioning, write up group
results, etc.  The CAC should have a "begin &amp; end" date. do NOT create an
ongoing open-ended committee. that will kill all ideas and people on the
committee.  Really get focused on why a committee is needed, give it a
6-month mandate with staff and some money, and get out of their way.  This
requires TRUST on the side of the government for the value of the public.
hmmm, that is something that would be nice to have more of.

I think there is nothing wrong with having an ongoing watchdog group,
particularly when the agency/administration being overseen has a
history of writing unambitious long-range plans and then not carrying
them out,  reducing funding of waste prevention and recycling on an
annual basis just to be put back by the City Council after everybody
has had to waste time, again, repeating earlier testimony, conducting
outreach programs sporadically, jerking program requirements around
causing permanent damage to participation rates, changing siting
policies of various types of facilities every few years for decades
without adequate public input or consultation with nearby affected
jursdictions (in and out of NYC) beforehand causing costly delays, etc
etc.  The conundrum is that with such an agency /administration, if
there is no requirement to even look at the CAC's recommendations,
much less take any of them, then all the hard work is ignored.  With
agencies that are early adopters and forward-thinking by nature, there
is less of a need for an ongoing CAC, but if there were one,
innovative recommendations would more likely receive a hearing.  In a
jurisdiction as large and complex as New York, and considering its
history, I believe ongoing committees are needed and there is plenty
for them to do every year (I was responsible for helping to steer the
citywide and Manhattan bodies for going on 20 years, involving the
bodies in all the items mentioned as well as crafting procurement
legislation, revisions to state solid waste management legislation and
detailed long-range zero waste plans).  And yes, trust is an important
requirement on both sides.   The testimony and documents on this
website are the tip of the iceberg of work the local bodies have done
( http://geography.hunter.cuny.edu/~mclarke/WPComm.htm )  So how do we
achieve this mutual trust?
