From a Google translation of a review of Martin Amis's books on an Italian
site.

******************

In an other story - &quot; Passages of career &quot; - the author imagines a world in
which cinematographic poets and scripteriters the destinies are exchanged:
insigni the poets come invite to you to Hollywood from cinematographic
producers that entice them with consisting checks, while for the writers of
scripts it does not remain that to try to place their products near
rivistucole from the pulling ridicule... Amis is amused to turn over the
truth also in &quot;the state of England&quot;, where the jockey pole of a discotheque
has insufficient possibilities to enroll just rampollo to one rinomata
school which, to the contrary, the sons of Pakistani and Indian e'migre's
have easy access (all refined persons and intelligent).

Buffalo writes below that he also has considerable trouble understanding
ill-written compound sentences. Should he stick to commentaries only? they
will paraphrase for him what has been said, sparing him any raw exposure.

Attempting to correlate what actual Brits say with ideas about them will
cause inevitable collapse of world-view, rendering need to reformulate basis
of the Club's ad-hom tactics.

Much of this canting ad hom material is now becoming boring by uninventive
repetition - and might be successfully reduced to &quot;doh, I don't understand
much&quot;.

Perhaps I should try it myself? Maybe a completely outrageous war-time
harangue from Italian radio by Ezra Pound juxtaposed with a club-member's
effort? Is that fair or not? Or as David Webb prefers, &quot;That fair or not
is?&quot;

That's an interesting suggestion. It raises the possibility that
perhaps Mr. Innes is composing his posts in some other language, running
them through Babelfish to produce an &quot;English&quot; version, and than posting
the output that results.

Babelfish and similar automated translation programs generally leave
untranslated any words in the source language that the program does not
recognize. Thus, in order to deduce the language in which Mr. Innes is
writing his posts, we need only determine what language contains the
words &quot;campel,&quot;&quot;secuter,&quot; and &quot;impugnity.&quot;

That's from Orwell. But you haven't read Orwell, so you rely on Nil's
recommendation of what I said about it :(

Orwell recorded his opinion in print in 1941, and he wrote that Miller was
the last real novelist of the C20th, not the last /American/ writer.

It would be necessary to understand why he wrote it by also understanding
the circumstances of the time, reflecting on the Spanish civil war and a
vast array of lies published by all parties concerning what was happening
there, and his conversations with Miller in Paris en route to the war,
memoires of which which were written down some years later.

Why don't you review the thread and then make your speculations? But perhaps
speculation wouldn't be necessary?.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes it is a requirement.

David Webb wrote a sentence putting down another person's ability to write,
in which he used a particular formation of linked phrases; verb noun then
noun verb, which I pointed out was not good English writing. I did not
speculate that David Webb believed in moon-landing conspiracies thereby, but
that he was no better than the person he criticised.

That's the issue. David Webb then cut that segment from his response and is
pretending that it never happened, and is digressing and digressing until
here he wants citations of Orwell and Miller :)

But what if I provide it? More digression? We don't know from his writing
why he holds an opinion, or why he makes demands of others, and when
directly challenged about these transparently obvious
diversions-ad-infinitum, he replies with yet another question. Perhaps only
the Leader can ask questions?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Mr. Innes never says why he &quot;engages the
&gt; subject.&quot;

"/>

Lair! This is untrue! As above, David Webb 'has not seen' and deems not to
notice, furthermore can't be bothered to do his own research. But since this
is a challenge, I have re-stated it above - David Webb's own random sentence
construction is compared with those whose writing is thought to be exemplary
of good English.

David Webb perhaps has a special meaning to his words, since I have been
writing that my motive for contesting his carping and petty criticisms is
evident in every post I make, and that his standard is an unfair one, since
it does not address the topic in any attempt at impartiality, but
obsessively invents and speculates on the writer to the topic.

&quot;Never&quot; for David Webb is presumably a code word for 'always'. Therefore,
what price citations? LOL

O no. The 'request a quotation request' in response to a question. Why is he
asking? I mean, its okay to suggest that I am lying, but is he doing so? He
evidently hasn't read of the circumstances at the end of Blair's life, which
is also okay, however, what is the basis of requiring citations about a
subject that you haven't tackled? What depends on it? Isn't it odd not to
say why you ask anything - extremely odd when a request turns into a demand!

Mr. Webb doesn't address the subject matter of any interaction, doesn't feel
confident to say why he writes anything, denies what I have written 30 times
to him directly and characterises that as 'never', and now suggests that I
am 'lashing out' at other people but also admits that he hasn't quite
understood any of the above.

Of course David finishes with his judgement of what other people should
think, not of any issue of investigating an issue by writing together about
it, but by an active 'Leader' suggestion that no such thing should take
place here which would be foolish!

Thank you.

I recommend the newly republished 4 volume set of essays journalism and
letters, edited by Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus, Published by Nonpareil Books
in the US, David Godine, Boston.

There are references in the fourth volume [In front of your nose, 1945-50]
to Miller on pages 106, 107, 109 which are pertinent.

To Waugh on pages 478, 481, 482, 512-513, 520, 438 442, 478-479. Often
multiple references per page.

I would also much recommend a superb biography in conjuction with the four
book set - ORWELL, Wintry Conscience of a generation, by Jeffrey Meyers.
[Publ. US. Norton. copyr. 200]

References to Miller on pages 82, 107, 137, 141, 207.
References to Waugh on pages 9, 65, 96, 200, 308-309, 325.

Perhaps the most tantalising conversation that we know occured, but have no
record of content whatever, is between Blair and Waugh who met for the first
time at Blair's deathbed. Blair said he had two remaining projects, to write
on Waugh and to write on Conrad. To my knowledge, not even fragments of
notes survive on either subject. Waugh refused to discuss his conversation
with Blair, and also left no record of it, not even alluded to the subject
of conversation.

Perhaps incidentally David Godine the US publisher lives just across the Ct
from me here in S. Vermont.
