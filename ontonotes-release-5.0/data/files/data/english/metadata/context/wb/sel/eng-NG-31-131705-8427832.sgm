Thanks for this, Jack. I may be in the market for one, and this is
probably the best resource from which to make some decisions. My
alternative would probably involve slogging through the Harmony
Central reviews, and I've never found that they help a whole lot.

Nice list, Jack. Makes me feel much less guilty about having
3 335-like guitars (Gigson 335, Ibanez AS120 and Washburn HB35)
and now getting semihollow (well sortta - more like chambered)
Forshage.
Do you think you oould make similar list about archtops ?

But the guitar has nothing to do with a semi. It is an es175 copy,
designed
following Metheny's specfication. More specifically, it was designed
following the famous Metheny Gibson es175 blonde.
It has a full hollow body, only the neck PU....
I can not imagine that someone would buy a PM100, expecting it'd
behavior like
a semi hollow.

It's made nothing like a 175 and sounds nothing like Metheny's 175.
It's more of a copy of the prototype Ibanez model Ibanez made for him
years ago. The top is thicker than a 175 and it's got a pair of thick,
parallel braces that go from front to back of the top surrounding the
pickups. These are not your typical hollowbody braces. These are more
like what the GB series guitars have and therefore I consider it
somewhat of a semi-hollow.

It has been just a humble feedback, Jack.
When I saw the PM100 there, I thought &quot;Huh?&quot;.....
I own a PM100 and a semi hollow (an AS120). A  you, I have had several
semi hollows.
Totallly different worlds.
I'm not defending the PM100 because I have one. I'm just saying that
for
a semi hollow evaluation, yes, IMHO, it is on the wrong page.
I still think that you are thinking more in terms of the PM120 (2 PUs,
thiner
body, etc....), especially because in your page, both PMs are
evaluated together.
I would expect get a semi sound from a PM120,not from a PM100.

Exagareting a bit, this is like to find a Lamborghini Maseratti in a
Trucks Review
Page. :-)

But, no problems. As I said, it was just a feedback that I thought
could be useful
to improve your very nice page.

I thought &quot;semi-hollow&quot; meant that there was some block or piece that
connected the back to the top?  And full hollow has the top free of
the back, no matter how it's braced.  Maybe the PM100 falls somewhere
in-between and needs an asterisk by it.

I did not see anything about neck profile, nut width, string spacing,
radius, etc. It is the first thing I look at. Are these specs all
pretty much the same on this style, or something that you don't attach
importance to? The only guitar of this style I have owned was a 446.
It sounded great and was nice and well balanced, but I was bugged by
the string spacing.

I've owned a couple of them. Great guitar. I should add it to my
review.

Regarding string spacing, almost all of them are 1 11/16 at the nut
and standard bridge widths. There's not too much variance within that
spec.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I count the pm100 as a semi because of the very thick top and GB-10
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; style top bracing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But the guitar has nothing to do with a semi. It is an es175 copy,
&gt; &gt; &gt; designed following Metheny's specfication. More specifically, it was designed
&gt; &gt; &gt; following the famous Metheny Gibson es175 blonde.

&gt; &gt; It's made nothing like a 175 and sounds nothing like Metheny's 175.
&gt; &gt; It's more of a copy of the prototype Ibanez model Ibanez made for him
&gt; &gt; years ago. The top is thicker than a 175 and it's got a pair of thick,
&gt; &gt; parallel braces that go from front to back of the top surrounding the
&gt; &gt; pickups. These are not your typical hollowbody braces. These are more
&gt; &gt; like what the GB series guitars have and therefore I consider it
&gt; &gt; somewhat of a semi-hollow.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It has a full hollow body, only the neck PU....
&gt; &gt; &gt; I can not imagine that someone would buy a PM100, expecting it'd
&gt; &gt; &gt; behavior like
&gt; &gt; &gt; a semi hollow.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Apples and oranges.

&gt; &gt; What difference does it make? I included it on the wrong page?!?- Hide quoted text -

&gt; It has been just a humble feedback, Jack.
&gt; When I saw the PM100 there, I thought &quot;Huh?&quot;.....
&gt; I own a PM100 and a semi hollow (an AS120). A  you, I have had several
&gt; semi hollows.
&gt; Totallly different worlds.
&gt; I'm not defending the PM100 because I have one. I'm just saying that
&gt; for
&gt; a semi hollow evaluation, yes, IMHO, it is on the wrong page.
&gt; I still think that you are thinking more in terms of the PM120 (2 PUs,
&gt; thiner
&gt; body, etc....), especially because in your page, both PMs are
&gt; evaluated together.
&gt; I would expect get a semi sound from a PM120,not from a PM100.

&gt; Exagareting a bit, this is like to find a Lamborghini Maseratti in a
&gt; Trucks Review
&gt; Page. :-)

&gt; But, no problems. As I said, it was just a feedback that I thought
&gt; could be useful
&gt; to improve your very nice page.

Hi Jaz!, very nice review indeed!!

OTOH, I would agree that the PM-100 is listed in the wrong page, maybe
you could just added it in your coming full hollow reviw page (that I
wish is coming soon!!).
I haven't own a PM100 but tried several of them in stores and always
had the &quot;vibe&quot; of a full hollow. And I have read from different
resources that according metheny himself the ibanez was modeled after
a ES-175 (that remark could be due contratual obligations, though).
But I do think they have that tipical woody mid-rangey &quot;tuk&quot; sound
that ES-175's are famous for.
I would say that the midrange is even more emphasized and some have
compared the PM-175 as a &quot;ES-175 on steroids&quot;. I do agree with you
that is a very dark sounding guitar though. OTOH, in some interview I
read (dont know were, sorry) Metheny challenge the interviewer to
guess which guitar (the old gibson or the PM100) was used in -don't
remember- record as example that most people couldnt tell which is
which. Maybe is also another avertising remark, but if he was talking
about one of those with super-chorused guitars it wouldn matter which
guitar he was using :)
Maybe you got a &quot;lemon&quot; with the one you had?  or maybe you're right
but... in any case it would be misleading for people looking for
reviews to list the PM100 as a semihollow, IMHO.
That said, I really found interesting reading about the concept behind
&quot;Sheets of sound&quot;! I was looking for list of content of the books but
didn't find any, maybe I overlooked it. Could you point me where I can
the content?

Best whises, Jaz and very nice page BTW!,

Carlos

&gt; Regarding string spacing, almost all of them are 1 11/16 at the nut

&gt; spec.

For years manufacturers have moved toward flat boards, skinny
profiles, strings bunched in the middle (away from the fingerboard
edge). I notice it right away when I pick up a new epi or gibson
(which is not that often). I would have thought there was some
variation in modern brands. The Eastmans I have played (admittedly,
just a couple in stores) feel very close to 40s-50s guitars to me, but
they were not semis. I am not very familiar with semis, and it makes
sense that they all gravitate toward a modern setup.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A nice resource, Jack.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A quick note....  Ibanez PM-100 is a full-hollow (it's an ES-175
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copy).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PM-120 is a semi-hollow.

I've owned 3 PM120s and 2 PM100s and they all sounded the same.
Metheny turns his tone control almost all the way down on the 175 so
surely you wouldn't be able to hear a diff...

none. I think it's manufacturing sloppyness when the string spacing
gets too narrow. When the fret ends are sloppily done, the nut is
often pinched in to keep the strings from falling off the edge of the
neck on the edges.
