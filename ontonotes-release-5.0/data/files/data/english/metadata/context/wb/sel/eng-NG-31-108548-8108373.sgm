I found a good website that surveyed aluminum and fluoridation intake
as to prevalence of Alzheimer
disease. I was looking to see if the frequency of Alzheimer was
greater in fluoridated countries like
USA, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand than in nonfluoridated countries
like Norway, Finland, Japan,
Switzerland, France, Germany.

According to one survey, high aluminum concentrations in the water and
low fluoridation have a
highest frequency of Alzheimer. With the idea that high fluoridation
scavenges aluminum. But the
survey inconclusive.

What I suspect is that aluminum is not the culprit. I suspect it is
fluoridation coupled with mercury.

What I suspect is happening is that the APP scissors that makes the
beta amyloid plaques
by wrongly cutting the protein and leaving the beta amyloid stub which
then accumulates is caused
by hydrofluoric acid. The hydrofluoric acid corrupts the APP scissors.

So I need to find out if hydrofluoric acid can be created in the brain
of minute amounts? I need
to find out if mercury is involved in that process?

So what I suspect is the culprit of Alzheimer disease is mercury
coupled with fluoride. In all
industrialized countries, Alzheimers is prevalent and so is mercury
and fluoride in the
environment.

I suspect the combination of mercury and fluoride over years of
exposure develops tiny amounts of
hydrofluoric acid in the brain. That acid when in contact with the APP
scissors corrupts that scissors
and consequently spews out beta amyloid.

So I need to look up as to whether anyone has reported that tiny
amounts of hydrofluoric acid can
be created inside the body and specifically the brain. And whether
mercury plays some role in
creating hydrofluoric acid.

What I am looking for is whether the brain is a environment where
fluoride can be turned into dangerous
fluoride such as HYDROFLUORIC ACID and other fluoric compounds such as
MERCURY FLUORIDE.

We all know that the brain has distinct diseases such as Autism
Alzheimer Parkinson Prion and
Schizophrenia. But can the brain serve as a cavity or chamber in which
innocuous fluoride turns into
dangerous poisonous fluoride such as hydrofluoric acid? Such that a
disease of Alzheimers is really the
creation of hydrofluoric acid in minute quantities over time in which
the APP scissors is corrupted and
thus accumulation of beta amyloid.

Is the Autism disease the conversion of fluoride plus mercury into
some minute quantity of a dangerous
fluoride such as Mercury-Fluoride which then causes the brain to have
missing parts.

Is the active agent in Prion diseases really a tiny minute quantity of
a mercury-fluoride compound?

One of the Google hits above talks at length about pesticides as
fluoride compounds and it is well
known that the MidWest farm belt of the USA has the highest Parkinson
rates. So it is very easy to see
that exposure to fluoride by farmers.

Apparently, Alzheimers is a lifetime of exposure to a dangerous poison
that corrupts the APP scissors and
this slow and gradual corruption accumulates beta amyloid. This sounds
like something in the drinking
water such as fluoride. So that the constant exposure coupled with a
brain environment where much
electricity in the brain can turn fluoride and mercury into dangerous
poisons such as Hydrofluoric acid
or Mercury Fluoride.

One of the websites above speaks of tau protein, and it is long been
known that Alzheimers has two
proteins involved of beta amyloid and tau protein but it is a mystery
as to how both are involved. But is it
a mystery if the culprit is a form of fluoride?

Is it a mystery for Prion disease if we consider the culprit as a
fluoride poison that alters the geometry
of a prion protein, rather than the old-goofy-theory of protein-only?

Long time ago I asked whether any person ever caught two or more of
these diseases? Whether one
can catch Parkinsons and then later die of Alzheimers or vice versa.
Or whether one can catch CJD
and later catch Alzheimers. Seems as though this never happens, but it
should happen if these
diseases are various forms of mercury and fluoride and other chemical
poisons.

Tonight I was looking for information as to whether the CsF ion can
conformation change the scrapie prion
molecule. That if a beaker of normal prion molecules and a CsF ion
were added, would there appear after some
time, various different prion conformations?

According to this website:
http://www.tulane.edu/~dmsander/WWW/335/Prions.html
Scrapie has at least 15 strains.

Now maybe it is not CsF that is doing the conformation changes in
prion diseases. Maybe it is CsHg
or maybe HgF.

My basic point is this-- these 5 diseases in the title are all caused
by foreign metals in the brain.

So what I am looking for is experiments wherein you have normal prion
molecules, add some metal
ions such as CsF, and look for conformation changes.

The old theory of &quot;protein only causing agent&quot; is fake science for it
cannot explain 15 strains of
scrapie. What can explain 15 strains is some foreign metal that has
alot of disruptive interaction
with normal prion molecules and where the number of strains are a huge
number.

Whether it is the cesium or fluorine or mercury atom or ion which when
in contact with a normal prion
molecule will alter the shape. As a analogy, picture iron filings
spread randomly and pass a weak
magnet over them. There will be conformation changes.

Which metal is the cause of Prion Disease? I would guess it is cesium
because of the temperature
needed to sterilize a infectious sample.

Ran across several websites that spoke of welders as a group at large
risk of contracting Parkinson's disease.
It is blamed on the manganese fumes in welding.

This book is about alot of metals that cause diseases of the brain,
and even some non-metals such as
fluorine. This book is about chemicals that cause these major diseases
of the brain. The major culprit
is mercury and then the second major culprit is mercury compounds.
Then we arrive at other metals
or chemicals that cause these diseases. Cesium by itself, just may
cause Prion disease. Manganese
by itself, or Magnetic Manganese by itself may just cause Parkinsons.

But the central idea behind this book is that some protein of the body
is under attack whenever the body
has too much of a metal present and that the protein goes into
abnormal interaction. In Alzheimers, the
APP scissors is corrupted and cuts stubs for proteins which then
accumulate. In Prion disease, the metal
present that causes CJD bends and misshapens normal prion proteins
into a bent shape that then
accumulates because protease can no longer remove these bent shaped
proteins. In Autism, the metal
or chemical (probably a mercury compound) prevents the formation of
some connective brain sheaths
from developing.

So in all these 5 diseases of the brain that I have written about in
this book may have one or two or several
metals or metal compounds or chemicals that cause the disease. As an
analogy, insecticides of chemicals
are not just one chemical that kills insects, but that you have a
broad choice of chemicals that can form
insecticides and kill insects. Likewise for the brain in humans, in
that mercury is not the only toxic poison
that damages proteins and protein synthesis. If you have too much
cesium or rubidium or fluorine or
manganese or silver in the brain, then expect some proteins to go awry
and cause death.

The world health organizations have made a broad coverup of data and
knowledge of these above 5 diseases.
I have spent a good deal of time in hunting down the surveys of where
Alzheimer, Autism, Parkinson, Prion
and Schizophrenia are most frequent. Some surveys are accurate such as
Nebraska being the world's
highest rate of Parkinsons disease and thus believed to be some farm
chemical.

But surveys on Alzheimer, Autism, Prion have been so much kept under
governmental wraps that I suspect
some overall coverup. That the health bureaus of governments do not
want people to know the details. Details
of communities living close and downwind of a coal fired electric
plant or a oil refinery. Governments like
the USA keeping a tight lid wrap over mercury in thimerosal vaccines,
and for which the USA is being now
lawsuited. People should be able to easily find where the vast
majority of cases of Alzheimer, Autism, Parkinson
Prion and Schizophrenia are reported, just as easy as to find out each
case of H5N1 birdflu that is
reported. We easily can find out every birdflu case. But when it comes
to finding out the cases of Autism
or Alzheimer, downwind of airpolluters, then we run into what I
suspect is a coverup of science data.

And as I wanted data and surveys of fluoridation uses in the world we
come upon another suppression of
data and survey information. I say much of this because it should be
very, very easy for me to search for
a world map of the frequency of cases of Autism in the world and for a
map showing the frequency of
cases of Alzheimers and of Prion and Parkinson and Schizophrenia. For
we have lived with these diseases
for almost 1/2 a century now and yet no such maps exist, or I have not
found any. So this suggests to
me that there is some government suppression of this information,
especially on Autism and Alzheimers.
Suppression because governments fear having to be held accountable to
mercury in vaccines and governments
fear having to intervene in coal fired electric plants, forcing them
to become cleaner.

If such maps were available and as informative as are maps of birdflu,
H5N1, then it is my guess that such
maps would show that Autism and Alzheimers are connected with the
amount of mercury in the air we
breathe.

If maps and surveys were available for lung cancer, they would show a
connection to big cities and the
amount of asbestos still in the air due to brakes made of asbestos.

If such maps were available, it is my guess that states like Utah
would show some of the highest number
of cases of Autism, Alzheimers, Prion and Parkinson because of the
amount of mercury in the air of Utah.
Because of mercury mining in Nevada which is downwind of Utah, and
coupled with the fact of alot of coal
fired plants in Utah that the air of Utah is especially a health
hazard, and which suppression of this knowledge
would be wanted by the government of the USA and even the government
of the state of Utah. Nebraska is
known as the highest Parkinson disease rate. So if not Utah as the
most mercury filled air state, then what
state is the most mercury filled air state? If not Utah, is it Texas?

So until the government of the USA and its 50 State governments comes
clean on the surveys and data
and information, instead of roadblocking and stifling and suppressing
the data, can we really come to tackling
these 5 diseases.

It is supremely and obnoxiously funny that the USA health departments
have for decades run alerts and
alarms to pregnant women about eating tuna fish and other fish because
of too much mercury, and then,
ironically, in 2007, that same USA department of health arguing that
Thimerosal mercury in vaccines
for babies and infants was safe. How any government scientist of the
USA could take a stance where they
have been ringing the alarm for 30 years that tuna fish is bad for
pregnant women and yet are more than
happy to inject mercury into a infant for a vaccine.

So in my researches I have reached a point where I am looking for a
mercury molecule that would change
a normal prion protein into the diseased prion protein.

I am not sure of chemists call such molecules or ions as &quot;denaturation
agents&quot;. The term for an agent that
causes a conformation change of the geometry of a protein molecule. In
other words, in prion disease, it is not
a protein molecule that changes the shape of other protein molecules,
but rather, it is a chemical agent such
as mercury or a mercury compound of perhaps CsHg or HgF or MnHg or
many other mercury compounds. Perhaps
the disease agent in prion disease is hydrofluoric acid.

Anyway, what I am looking for is a chemical agent that changes the
shape of prion proteins. For approx
ten years now I have argued that the Prusiner model is a fake, because
it is not caused by proteins but rather
caused by a toxic chemical poison. Because of the large number of deer
and elk animals around
Colorado USA have high levels of cesium and mercury in their bodies, I
suspect the cuprit that alters the
prion proteins is CsHg. England also has a large amount of cesium and
mercury in the environment.

So why would eating the brains of infected animals spread the disease?
Not because of eating the altered
prion proteins but because the chemical that caused the alterations is
still present in those brains. Perhaps
all it takes is three molecules of CsHg ingested that will start the
onset of the prion disease.

And the reason for the plethora of strains is that RbHg would also
cause the disease as well as many other
alkali metal ions with mercury.

Which brings us the interesting question of whether Alzheimers is a
conformational change of the APP scissors
that starts the onslaught of Alzheimer's disease. So is the corruption
of the APP scissors due to a mercury
ion which interacts with a normal APP scissors and leaves it abnormal
so that it creates the beta
amyloid.

Parkinson's disease is a corruption of alpha synuclein protein. Is
this disease another example of a conformational
change caused by some toxic chemical such as perhaps magnetic-
manganese?

Autism is the missing development of sheaths in several parts of the
brain. Missing tissue giving rise to
autism. Is that another conformation change in the proteins of the
brain? I doubt it because there is no
accumulation of a protein that cannot be removed as in the cases of
Prion and Alzheimers. In Autism, the
picture seems to be that of a missing tissue. So how would mercury
stop the development of tissue? To
answer that question, I would need to find out if mercury ever causes
the interruption or omission of the
protein development. And in this sense, Autism is much more alike that
of Parkinson's where connections
of the brain are destroyed. So in that sense, Autism is Parkinsons of
the young and Parkinson's is Autism
of the old age people, where toxic chemicals destroy a tissue of the
brain. In Alzheimers and Prion, the
chemical poison alters proteins that collect as garbage and unable to
be removed in time to cause death.

Now what would be very interesting to observe, since I suspect mercury
is one of those chemical poisons,
is whether a Autistic child grows up and later catches Alzheimers, and
where the same mercury poison caused
the Autism and caused the Alzheimers.

Or to see a case in which the same mercury poison causes both
Alzheimer's and CJD all in one brain. Such
a case would not prove the Metal Causation theory but it would cast
grave doubt of the correctness of the Prusiner
Model.

Now there is another disease in this book which I know less of than
these other four. I am talking of
Schizophrenia which seems to involve a protein gone awry. I think
mercury and silver are involved with
Schizophrenia and since our modern times have replaced silverware with
mostly stainless steel, I would
hazard to guess that Schizophrenia rates have gone steadily down since
about 1950 onwards. But then
the frequency of contact with mercury has steadily gone up since 1950
so that Schizophrenia may not be
on the decline but on the rise. And which is Schizophrenia more like?
Is it more like Alzheimers and Prion
with accumulation of garbage proteins not removable or is it like
Autism and Parkinsons where the brain
has missing tissue? I suspect Schizophrenia is more like Autism and
Parkinsons and thus has missing
tissue as the disease progresses.

Back in April of 2007 I began a table on each one of these five
diseases, and I should have
reread that table because zinc, not silver is implicated as the metal
that drives this disease.
It is found that zinc replaces dopamine.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (1) Proteins gone awry involved --
&gt; dopamine

Technically, dopamine is not a protein.

But like Parkinson's disease, dopamine is affected.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; (12) Toxic metals that are hypothesized by AP as the root cause:

">

Also, I suspect fluoride in conjunction with mercury has something to
do
with Schizophrenia in that in modern times our environment is daily
overflooded
with the intake of unneccessary fluoride in our drinking water.
Fluoride in the
form of HgF ions may play a key role in whether Schizophrenia starts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
">

So from reading the above, it sounds as though blockage of the
dopamine passages is
an accumulation of some unwanted material which sounds like the
mechanism of disease
progression in Alzheimer and Prion where accumulated waste occurs. Is
it zinc that causes the
blockage of dopamine? Is Schizophrenia the accumulation of zinc and
perhaps copper
or some other metal compound which builds up, similar to the buildup
of beta amyloid
plaques in Alzheimer disease? I somehow envision a picture similar to
the clotting of
arteries to the heart as Schizophrenia a clotting of the dopamine
passages.

I should make some new categories for the above table.

(13) Is the disease one of missing tissue or is the disease that of
the accumulated garbage waste
of a protein or other material?

For Alzheimer and Prion and Schizophrenia, it is accumulation of
garbage in the brain. For Autism, Parkinson
it appears as though there is missing tissue.
