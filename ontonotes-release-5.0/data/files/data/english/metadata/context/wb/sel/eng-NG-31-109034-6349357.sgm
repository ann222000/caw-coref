I don't believe we've had much straight-out discussions of this one.

William McKinley was an amazingly strong Republican candidate in 1896,
a major player in the political realignment that would dominate
American politics for generations afterwards. A Civil War veteran, a
friend to labor, an reformer, a Methodist, he played a major role in
establishing the Republican Party that would last until the time of
Herbert Hoover.

Without McKinley, I could easily see a Bryan victory in 1896. Oh ho,
Chet, I hear you say, didn't Bryan get beaten pretty soundly in 1896?
Not so, I reply! Bryan's popular vote loss (7,104,779 to 6,502,925)
was not actually that bad, percentage-wise, and though he lost badly
in the Electoral College, that had more to do with several narrow
McKinley victories in the Midwest and Far West that IMO an Eastern
Republican just couldn't have pulled off. McKinley had the support of
labor, of bimetallists, of religious leaders, that very few other
Republicans could have managed.

So let's say the Republicans nominate an Eastern, hard-money man, and
Bryan wins an electoral college victory. OK, a lot of Republicans will
fulminate about the crazy populist in the White House, but that's
nothing new. Bryan becomes the youngest President in the history of
the United States at the tender age of thirty-six in March of 1897.
How does Bryan handle the Cuban crisis, the Spanish-American War, and
the various other events of 1897 and on in OTL?

Badly.

Bryan was -- and I'm trying to be nice here -- a complete, toe-sucking
imbecile.  Vast personal energy and a magnificent speaking voice
managed to conceal the fact that there wasn't an idea in that
beautiful head of his.

He'd have a decent time in one respect: the period 1897-1900 was one
of decent economic growth as the economy rebounded from the miserable
mid-1890s.  I doubt free silver would make that big a difference.  But
otherwise, hoo boy.

Spain... well, OTL he supported the war with Spain, then opposed the
annexation of the Philippines.  TTL, who the hell knows?  Bryan's very
stupidity makes it hard to predict what he'd come up with.

Who's in his Cabinet?  Because I suspect that this would be more
important than in most Administrations.

Also, Mrs. Bryan.  She seems to have been the brains of the pair.

Y'know, there were legitimate grounds for this. Bryan, and others, was
a geninue opponent of imperialism. He wanted to end Spain's empire and
not found an American one. And it's not as if Bryan's 'stupidity' ever
really changed his message; he adapted with the times, preaching free

etc.

Bryan finds some role for Tom Watson; the Populists would need to be
bought off somehow. Agriculture? Maybe a real job will keep his mind
out of the gutter for a while. Thomas Bayard goes at State; a nice,
safe grey eminence who favors low tariffs. He kicks in 1898, just in
time for the Cuban Crisis. Let's say there _is_ a war with Spain, as
Bryan favored, and that Bryan is as honest in the White House as he
was out of it. Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Phillippines are just
becoming independant by the time President Bryan announces he's
running for a second term. Secretary of State George B. McClellan Jr.

They were, but they weren't his ideas.  Bryan tended to grab on to a
selected few of the Hot Topics of the day. "The people of Nebraska are
for free silver and I am for free silver. I will look up the arguments
later."

Here's a bit from a recent review:  'Unlike Washington or Jefferson or
Lincoln or virtually any other major American historical figure, Bryan
seems to have been an incurious person with little capacity for
introspection and almost no intellectual breadth.

'He knew the Bible, he knew and loved the social novels of Dickens and
Victor Hugo, and he knew the smattering of classics that a 19th
century middle-class education in small-town Illinois afforded. Beyond
that, Bryan never read much or learned much. Although he traveled
around the world... his impressions were largely superficial, and
colored by xenophobic and racist assumptions. He gave the same
speeches year after year, over and over again. Kazin estimates that
Bryan's best-known addresses, "The Value of an Idea" and "The Prince
of Peace," were each delivered at least 1,500 times, and that nearly
half of all Americans had personally heard him give one or the other.'

He was a stone racist.  Okay, for a Democrat around the turn of the
century, this was almost a requirement.  But Bryan could have tossed
blacks a scrap or two without grossly offending the South.  He
didn't.

Much of his appeal was thinly veiled xenophobia, appealing to class
and region.

"I have been thinking over Bryan's speech. What did he say, anyhow?"

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

So were John Calhoun and Joe McCarthy.  And, you know, he led that

There was also a racist aspect.  Before the Insular Cases, it wasn't
clear what rights the Cubans and Filipinos might have.  They might
even become -- shudder -- American citizens.

This being 1900, Bryan was pretty straightforward about that:
annexation was morally wrong, /and/ it would saddle America with a
"new race problem."

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Would they?  Bryan took their votes, but never gave them the time of
day AFAIK.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; was out of it.
">

Hm.

"But what of his life? Did he accomplish any useful thing? Was he, in
his day, of any dignity as a man, and of any value to his fellow-men?
I doubt it. Bryan, at his best, was simply a magnificent job-seeker.
The issues that he bawled about usually meant nothing to him. He was
ready to abandon them whenever he could make votes by doing so, and to
take up new ones at a moment's notice. For years he evaded Prohibition
as dangerous; then he embraced it as profitable. At the Democratic
National Convention last year he was on both sides, and distrusted by
both...

"Bryan was a vulgar and common man, a cad undiluted. He was ignorant,
bigoted, self-seeking, blatant and dishonest. His career brought him
into contact with the first men of his time; he preferred the company
of rustic ignoramuses. It was hard to believe, watching him at Dayton,
that he had traveled, that he had been received in civilized
societies, that he had been a high officer of state. He seemed only a
poor clod like those around him, deluded by a childish theology, full
of an almost pathological hatred of all learning, all human dignity,
all beauty, all fine and noble things. He was a peasant come home to
the dung-pile. Imagine a gentleman, and you have imagined everything
that he was not.

"The job before democracy is to get rid of such canaille. If it fails,
they will devour it."

"There is really no more reason for electing an orator to office than
for electing a fiddler. Both talents rouse the emotions." -- William
Allen White, of Bryan.

Presumably the same could be said of an actor.  But -- RWR was, in the
end, a go-along, get-along kinda guy.  "Lazy" may overstate, but by
1981 nobody would describe Reagan as a man of boundless energy who
hurled himself headlong into causes.

Bryan... well, it's like that old saying about stupid energetic army
officers.

Also, one catches a whiff of a pathological need to be loved and
admired.  That's very common among candidates for office, of course,
but it's rarely a good thing.

Final thought: AFAICT, Bryan was a pretty good candidate, but not much
of a politician.  He won three elections -- two for Congress, and one
for the Senate (symbolic only, because Nebraska still chose its
Senators by state legislature, but he did win the popular vote) -- but
all of those were in his youth; after 1894 he never won a thing and
never held elective office.  For the last thirty years of his life, he
was in public service only two years -- as Woodrow Wilson's first
Secretary of State, a position from which he resigned in 1915.

Bryan's lack of experience in practical politics would not serve him
well as President.  Most of the Gilded Age Presidents had at least a
few terms as Governor or Senator, or -- in the cases of Lincoln and
Chester Arthur -- years of experience as a political boss and wheeler-
dealer.  The major exception is, well, Ulysses Grant.  And even Grant
at least had significant experience as an administrator.  Bryan's
private sector experience consisted of several years as a small-town
lawyer.  Even given the relatively modest demands of the Presidency at
the end of 19th century, it's hard to see him being ready for it.

Was Bryan completely worthless?  No.  Many of the causes he espoused
were noble ones.  And he had a few minor accomplishments during his
breif time in office: proper funding for American diplomats, for
instance (before 1914, our ambassadors were largely self-financing),
and payment of conscience money to Colombia for the US-backed loss of
Panama.  But even these modest achievements were offset by regular
bouts of fatuity; when informed of the first wave of the Armenian
genocide, for instance, his response was to assure the Armenians that
he'd have the US ambassador in Constantinople look into it.

So, on the whole, probably not so good.

One random thought: he'd probably oppose the annexation of Hawaii.

Well, when they tried a conservative Democrat in 1904 they did worse than any
of Bryan's three attempts.  Can you imagine how a Cleveland Democrat would
have done in 1896?   Really, coming as close as he did to McKinley was an
impressive achievement, and as I say at
http://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/msg/7cbff16a87af9190 I
doubt that any Republican candidate other than McKinley and *possibly*
Allison would have defeated Bryan.

But that wasn't on the agenda.  It was clear that the '96 convention
would nominate a silverite, and one with a fair amount of distance
from the unpopular outgoing President.

The favorite going into the convention was the unfortunately named
Congressman Richard Bland, aka "Silver Dick", a long-time House
veteran and seasoned political operator.  It's hard to say if Bland
would have done better than Bryan, but on the other hand I don't see
him doing much worse; any reasonably competent Democrat would have won
the Solid South and the mountain states.

Which states that Bryan won might Bland have lost?  Probably the Great
Plains states of Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota, all of which were
very close (within a few thousand votes and a couple of percentage
points) OTL.  (That may seem surprising, but remember that these
states were already major grain exporters; inflation would have made
their exports cheaper.)  On the other hand, a Western candidate might
have carried California and Oregon -- both lost to Bryan by just a
handful of votes.  Overall, pretty much a wash.

"But Bland would not have campaigned as energetically as Bryan!"  No,
probably not... but Bryan's campaigning probably did him little good,
and may have hurt him.  More than 80% of his appearances were in a
handful of  large swing states -- Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa,
Michigan, and Wisconsin -- all of which he lost.  He spent two weeks
on a trip through the Northeast, covering ten states from Delaware to
Maine -- all of which he lost.  And Bryan's travelling and speeches
helped galvanize Republicans as well as Democrats.

A--My impression is they were periods, but I would not attempt to

The whole thing makes remarkable reading.  Even today, you can see in

Bryan was also rather anti-Catholic and towards the end of his

hurt his prospects as a Democrat. The later 19th and early 20th

it'll turn off one of the largest Democrat voting blocs.

...H.L. Mencken is really, really, not a good source on Bryan, as I
assume you know. Bryan was everything Mencken had always
hated -- mid-western, religious, in favor of government regulation,
and worst of all, popular among the "booboisie." Might as well do
a thread on how McKinley was a tool of the British Money Power,
and use a Bryan speech to argue the point.

I admit that I've always been rather annoyed by Mencken, even
though I like reading his work. The typical Mencken column
consists of him feeling superior to everybody else, mixed with
some complaining about how the rabble do not recognize how
superior people like him are.

I agree with this statement. OTOH, Bryan is going to be _everywhere_

&gt; and payment of conscience money to Colombia for the US-backed loss of

Bryan presided over the "Trans-Mississippi Congress"
which met in Salt Lake City in July 1897. Delegates
from 18 states, 3 territories, and Hawaii, resolved
in favor of annexation. [Pratt, _Expansionists of 1898_]

This "Trans-Mississippi Congress" was one of many
that met in the years 1891 to 1910 (or so). They
were considered more or less Democrat functions, though
Reed Smoot asked McKinley for a greeting letter to
the SLC meeting.

">

BTW, while it is certainly true that Bryan and the Democrats concentrated
on free silver in the 1896 campaign, one should not forget that the
Democratic platform--while of course not as radical as the Populists'--was
by no means restricted to free silver. It called for an income tax and for
"the enlargement of the powers of the Inter-State Commerce Commission and
such restrictions and guarantees in the control of railroads as will
protect the people from robbery and oppression," and  denounced high
tariffs, "government by injunction," and "[t]he absorption of wealth by
the few, the consolidation of our leading railroad systems and the
formation of trusts and pools."
http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/chicagoplatform.html

Some comments on the Chicago platform from conservatives:

"'No wild-eyed and rattle-brained horde of the red flag ever proclaimed
such a specific defiance of law, precedent, order, and government' was the
comment of the *New York Mail*...'Considering the platform,' declared C.
Ellery Anderson of New York, 'it may be as well that a revolutionist like
Bryan stands upon it.  We want them with red flags so there will be
provocation for shooting them down.'  (*Literary Digest,* Vol. XIII, July
18, 1896, p. 357.)"  Philip Foner, *History of the Labor Movement in the
United States, Volume II* (1955), p. 336.  Foner, a Communist, gives the
Chicago Platform the Red Seal of Approval, proclaiming it "progressive."
(p. 333).

It's important to remember this because it goes against the widespread
belief that the Populist support for Bryan was put over by "conservative"
Populists who believed in free silver as *the* panacea.  And it may help
to explain the enthusiastic support for Bryan by what some might consider
an unlikely source--Eugene V. Debs (although, interestingly, even Debs, in
his campaign tour for Bryan, put a heavy emphasis on free silver).

Demur.  McKinley was a more than competent politician.  He had a solid
career in Congress, followed by two terms as governor of Ohio.  While
governor, he gained (justified) fame for arbitrating labor disputes
during a major recession -- he managed to acknowledge the needs of
labor (and their right to organize) while still staying chums with
management.  It was quite an accomplishment, and one reason he was
able to hang on to much of the workingman's vote in '96.

He knew how to get things done.  Mark Hanna gets all the press, but
really they were a team.  (I'm reminded a bit of Seward and Thurlow
Weed in New York fifty years earlier.)  The fact that McKinley wasn't
charismatic at all conceals how astute he really was.

McKinley bears major responsibility for the McKinley Tariff.  This
turned out to be a major mistake for the Republicans, but still -- it
was no small thing, and he pushed it through.

In office, he doubled the size of the White House staff and started
the first regular meetings with the press -- the precursor of the
modern press conference.  He was both a more activist President and a
more politically canny one than is generally realized.

So, he did bring a fair bit to the table.  And he'd have been a
competent President, and gotten a fair amount done, even without
Hanna.

some room to maneuver here.

Could he have used it for political gain?  Hm, that I doubt.  Looking
at the election figures again, the only battlefield state with any
significant [voting] black population was Ohio.  McKinley won his home
state by a surprisingly small margin, but I doubt Bryan could have
made up the difference with minor concessions to black voters.

That said, it is striking what a blank slate Bryan was on this issue.

Thinking about this, I see trouble ahead.  Bryan doesn't have a Mark
Hanna.  And OTL he didn't show much inclination to share the
limelight.

Have you read Kearns Goodwin's _Team of Rivals_?  I wouldn't call it a
major work, but it's very readable, and I suspect you'd enjoy it.

One key point that Goodwin makes is that, when it came to Cabinet
selection, Lincoln did an excellent job of suppressing his ego.  Two
of his greatest rivals were on board, and he also chose a number of
strong-willed and difficult characters.  It wasn't entirely a spoils
question, either... political calculation was certainly present (both
in terms of rewarding his friends and keeping his enemies close), but
he seems to have been looking for competence and energy.

[Digression: while it's certainly possible to overstate Lincoln's
greatness, he really was extraordinary in a couple of respects.  For
one, it was very hard to make him feel threatened.  He didn't lack for
ego, but he seems to have totally lacked the rival-male-primate
bristling reflex.  I've sometimes wondered if his sheer physical
stature helped with this.]

Goodwin approaches, but then unfortunately wanders away from, a
general theory of Cabinet formation.  But she does raise some
interesting points.  Gilded era Cabinet posts were somewhat more
powerful, and much more prestigious, than equivalent appointments
today.  In building a Cabinet, any President had to deal with certain
restrictions, viz., the need to reward supporters, deal with rivals,
and placate various party factions.  But within those parameters there
was considerable room for maneuver, and different Presidents could and
did take very different approaches to Cabinet-building.

Bryan does not strike me as someone who worked and played well with
others.  So I don't think his Cabinet choices would be guided either
by deep political cunning or by a desire to appoint the best men for
the job.

Mind, that's an impression.  If I'm wrong about this aspect of his
character, I welcome correction.

The first, worst wave of killings took place on Bryan's watch, and was
done by the time Lansing took over.

For a guy who was supposedly fascinated by peace, it's striking how
uninterested -- even repelled -- Bryan was by this issue.  And it's
not because Armenia was a distant land of which we knew little.  The
issue had been in the US public consciousness since the massacres of
the 1890s, courtesy of American missionaries in the region and a small
but vocal Armenian immigrant community.  So there were plenty of
people bombarding Foggy Bottom with updates, protests, and cries for
help.

It's hard to avoid the conclusion that to Bryan, they were just a
bunch of wogs.

I don't think the battleships made much difference. The RN was atready
comfortably ahead of Germany there, and in any case the newer US
capital ships couldn't come to Britain because they were oil-burners,
and the RN in 1917 was too low on fuel oil to spare any for them.

As I understand it, the big US contribution was in destroyers, whose
availability as escorts facilitated the introduction of transatlantic
convoys. But I'm not sure how far TR was responsible for US strength
in destroyers, as opposed to the bigger ships.

Glancing over this thread, I'm still trying to figure out if anyone
has made the argument *why* a Bryan presidency would be worse than
OTL.  If we accept Noel's musings than free silver (or whatever whim
might has struck Bryan at the time) would have resulted in no worse a
result than sticking with gold.

As a huge plus, it's difficult to see how Bryan would have stumbled
into the Philippine-American War (as opposed to the Spanish-American

cares?  If I might carelessly (and foolishly) reference current
events, would the world be a worse place if George Bush would have
decided in February that the Iraqi people were completley incapable of
handling the intricacies of a Western, free-market democracy?

So what'll be different?  Sure, McKinley's a swell, and Bryan is,

Giving this a little more thought...

Obviously I don't think much of Bryan, and suspect a Bryan
administration would be, ah, not a complete success.  But is there a
bright side?

Maybe.  Suppose (as seems likely) that we do get into a Spanish-
American War much as iOTL, but that afterwards Bryan is consistent in
his anti-imperialist and anti-annexationist stances.  So, Cuba, the
Philippines, maybe even Puerto Rico, they all end up as independent
states.  Possibly with some degree of formal American protection, but
independent.

Now, this is going to have interesting knock-on effects on the history
of imperialism, and perhaps also on America's self-image.

Imperialism: in the 20th century OTL, whenever a Great Power claimed
it was anti-imperialist, it was probably lying, and quite possibly
busy gathering an empire to itself.  The US went to war against Spain
and scooped up Spain's colonies.  Imperial Japan claimed to be
liberating Asia while enslaving millions.  The Soviet Union was all
for freedom of oppressed peoples, unless they happened to be
Lithuanians or Poles.  And so on.

But TTL, we'd have a war not just against an empire, but -- arguably
-- against imperialism.  A no-kidding war of liberation by a Great
Power.  That basically never happened OTL.  I think this will have
interesting knock-on effects.  Maybe not entirely positive, but
interesting.

(Thought: how would independent Cuba and Philippines evolve in the
early decades?  I'm not seeing high levels of liberalism, development
and political stability in either new state, but there are degrees.
Anyone?)

American self-image: once we get past the "what the hell did we do
that for, then?" stage, I daresay there'd be a certain amount of
retconning and we'd collectively decide that, woo, we're the Different
Great Power (TM).

Again, this could lead to interesting complications.  A single
example: the Belle Epoque saw very rapid US commercial expansion in
Central America.  The decade before WWI, in particular, was one of
gunboat diplomacy and repeated intervention in the internal affairs of
places like Nicaragua and Honduras... sometimes peaceful, sometimes
not.  TTL, I think that impulse will still be there, and is likely to
be indulged once Bryan is out of office.  But it may be a bit harder
to square with the new and different US idea of itself.  Not
impossible, at all.  Just a bit harder.  Where OTL there was a
political consensus in favor of these sorts of interventions
(basically a large minority favored them, and everyone else didn't
care), TTL there might be a small but vocal strain of protest.

Thoughts?

I agree with much of the sentiments expressed in this post. I don't
think Cuba or the Phillippines would turn out _so_ badly, though.
Bryan wasn't a complete sucker, there's bound to be a Marine base at
Guantanamo, and a naval installation at Subic Bay. Aguilandao in the
Phillipines, probably Palma again in Cuba. (Nice and safe, and not,
y'know, black.) Anti-imperialism, the choice of a new generation!
(Bryan is only thirty-six when his Presidency starts, that's going to
have some knock-on effects right there.)

Pushing things out a bit:

Is Bryan re-elected in 1900? I am inclined to think so; there will be
peace and general prosperity, despite continued worries about his
sanity and the character of some of his Cabinet appointees. And then
in 1901, there's the question of Leon Frank Czolgosz, who will
probably try and kill whoever the incumbent is, especially if he's the
sort of capitalist who delays the revolution instead of accelerating
it. Let's say Bryan survives, though, as McKinley did in OTL; he's
younger and healthier. After that, hm.

The U.S. intervened in Nicaragua in
1912, at the urging of Sec of State
Philander Knox. In 1913, the Democrats
came in, Bryan became SoS, and the
intervention continued with Bryan's
explicit approval.

The "silver" press was far more
interventionist in 1898 than the
"gold" press.

Given the disorders endemic to
the region, and the threat of
Euro intervention, I see Bryan
thrashing around as much as TR
or Taft.

Bryan's reaction to a Villa raid,
or a threatened German demonstration
against Venezuela, would be more
emotional and extravagant than TR's.
TR was no crusader, as Bryan was.

Right, unlike one of his critics:

"I admit freely enough that, by careful breeding, supervision of
environment and education, extending over many generations, it might be
possible to make an appreciable improvement in the stock of the American
negro, for example, but I must maintain that this enterprise would be a
ridiculous waste of energy, for there is a high-caste white stock ready at
hand, and it is inconceivable that the negro stock, however carefully it
might be nurtured, could ever even remotely approach it. The educated
negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties
in life, but because he is a negro.  His brain is not fitted for the
higher forms of mental effort; his ideals, no matter how laboriously he is
trained and sheltered, remain those of the clown.  He is, in brief, a low-
caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient
until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization. And even then,
the superior white race will be fifty generations ahead of him."

Socialist, and H.L. Mencken, Individualist* [1910], p. 116

(I'm not doing this to bash Mencken, and I don't believe this should
necessarily be seen as his final estimate of blacks, or at least of all
blacks.  He was to encourage some black writers of the 1920's, especially
George Schuyler.  I'm just quoting this as a reminder of how widespread
such attitudes were among educated people in the early twentieth century.
I could quote *ad nauseum*--and I am using that term all too literally...)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Okay, for a Democrat around the turn of the
&gt; century, this was almost a requirement.  But Bryan could have tossed
&gt; blacks a scrap or two without grossly offending the South.  He
&gt; didn't.
">

In his early years, he did:

"The Democratic nominee [of 1908] had not always spurned black support.
In 1896, he welcomed the endorsement of Cyrus Bell, an Omaha Republican
who edited the only black newspaper in his state.  In 1900, Bryan assailed
the GOP for giving ex-slaves and their children no more than
'janitorships' in return for their decades of loyal support.  That year,
his campaign even distributed a statement by the small Negro National
Democratic League, blasting imperialism in the name of 'an oppressed
people' who understood the pain of 'subjugation' Filipinos were
enduring...

"But eight years later, the courting of the white South by Taft and Tom
Watson scared Bryan into reasserting his commitment to Jim Crow.  He wrote
that TR 'was justified in doing whatever he had power to do' in the
Brownsville case and denied the rumor, floated by Watson, that he had ever
served lunch at Fairview to 'colored men' (he admitted blacks would
'call' at his home from time to time).  At Democratic headquarters,
Josephus Daniels, an arch-segregationist and Bryan's close friend, helped
inoculate him against chatrges that he was soft on racial equality.
Meanwhile, pro-GOP black papers reprinted a blast John Kern [Bryan's
running mate] had made, after losing an earlier race, that 'the ignorant
n----r vote' defeated him."

Michael Kazin, *A Godly Hero:  The Life of William Jennings Bryan* (New
York:  Alfred A. Knopf 2006), pp. 161-2.

It could be argued that the South was too solidly Democratic by 1908 for
Bryan to have to worry so much about showing the slightest deviation from
its racial code. I would reply that the Republicans were indeed making a
serious attempt to crack the Solid South; see my post at
http://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/msg/0c5b41a1e12d6313
It did not succeed, but both Tennessee and North Carolina were fairly
close (closer than in 1904, especially in North Carolina [1]) and in those
days before scientific polling one could not be sure in advance that the
Republicans would not carry them.  (If Taft was so unpopular among blacks,
especially because of Brownsville, some Southern whites figured he
coudln't be that bad.)  And of course the border states (including newly
admitted Oklahoma) were very much in play.

(Even with Bryan's hostility, btw, a few blacks, like W. E. B. Du Bois,
did support him in 1908 on the theory that Brownsville and the failure of
the Republican Congress to do anything about disfranchisement and lynching
showed that the two major parties were equally racist, so blacks might as
well vote Democratic to punish the Republicans and show that their vote
could not be taken for granted.)

In short, Bryan's position on blacks in 1908, however wrong as a matter of
morality, was not necessarily stupid from the viewpoint of winning votes.
It is by no means clear that the few black votes he might have won by a
more sympathetic attitude would have compensated for the loss of white
votes in Southern and border states. In any event, I am not suggesting
that Bryan was "really" pro-black and that he concealed this for political
reasons.  On the contrary, he probably was never particularly sympathetic
to blacks and became more racist as he became more and more a Southerner,
a Floridian instead of a Nebraskan.  But in spite of losing three
presidential elections, he was not necessarily stupid *as a politician.*
Sometimes  the objective conditions just make it very hard for a party to
win the presidency in a particular year, regardless of its candidate.  And
after all, winning a presidential nomination three times does in itself
require some political skills, *especially* when you have thus far been a
failure in the general election...

One think we haven't talked about in this thread is what would
President Bryan do with the railroads. In OTL he thought that they
should be government run with the trunk lines controlled by the
federal government and the branch lines by the state governments. Its
very unlikely that Bryan could nationalize the railroads but he could
get them to be more regulated and that might lead to nationalization
sometime in the early 20th century if its seen as necessary, say if a
Great Depression happens in this ATL. If the railroads are
nationalized it might lead to an ATL where the US has decent railroad
travel outside of the Washington-Boston corridor.

Democrat -- conservative goldbug, of course, but still.  His Secretary
of State was John Sherman, William Tecumseh's little brother and
author of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.  (And the guy who'd had Chester
Arthur fired, back in the day.)  By 1897 Sherman was in his seventies
and his mind was wandering, but he was the party's elder statesmen so
there really was no choice.

(Digression: Sherman only lasted a year or so.  His eventual successor
in office was John M. Hay.  Is the name familiar?  It should be -- Hay
was Lincoln's secretary.

(Therein lies a fascinating tale.  Hay was from Springfield,
Illinois.  A bright young man, he wanted to be a poet, but there was
little prospect of this in 1850s Illinois so he went  to work at a law
firm instead.  As it happened, his office was next door to that of one
A. Lincoln.  Lincoln and Hay met in the street every day, and Lincoln
took the frustrated young poet under his wing.  When his campaign for
President got under way, he asked Hay to serve as his secretary.

(In chronicles of the Civil War, Hay pops up in the background as
Lincoln's twentysomething secretary and gofer.  What I didn't realize
was that he was the same John Hay who, forty years later, appears as
McKinley and TR's sixtysomething Secretary of State.

(Possibly McKinley made the appointment as a way of linking his
administration to the revered memory of Lincoln.  Still, by 1899 Hay
had been in and out of government service for years and had served as
Ambassador to Britain.  He was more than competent.  And he was a can-
do Secretary of State.  Pretty much every major US diplomatic
initiative of the early 1900s -- and there were plenty, from the Open
Door Policy to the Panama Canal -- had Hay in the middle of it.  A
long strange trip for the frustrated recent grad who had wandered the
muddy streets of Springfield contemplating his bleak and tedious
future.)

Anyway.  McKinley's Secretary of War, Russell Alger, was fired for
incompetence near the end of the Spanish-American War.  His Secretary
of the Navy, on the other hand, was excellent (and a liberal from
Massachussetts, presumably a sop to those few Republicans who wanted
rights for women and blacks).  And his Secretary of Agriculture was so
good that he lasted sixteen years -- still the record -- under three
Presidents.  So, dull-but-competent seems to have been the default.

Finally, his Postmaster General (who resigned in protest over the war)
tried to advance the idea of postal savings accounts.  This was not
completely insane -- many European countries had them.  The rationale
was, people went to the post office every day anyhow, so why not have
them drop a few pennies in the bank while buying stamps?  The accounts
would be invested in government bonds and pay a modest bit of
interest.

McKinley didn't bite -- probably because of his links to bankers, who
wouldn't much care to compete with Uncle Sam -- but this sounds like
the sort of thing a Bryan administration might get behind.  (Also the
sort of thing that the New Dealers would have loved.  I wonder why
they never tried it.)

Note that the Democratic platform opposed the issuing of government
bonds.  Which this totally wouldn't be, of course.

Speaking of which, that platform was also anti-immigration... sorry,
against the importation of "foreign pauper labor".

Hm, and there's this bit:  "We denounce the arbitrary interference by
Federal authorities in local affairs as a violation of the
Constitution of the United States and a crime against free
institutions, and we especially object to government by injunction as
a new and highly dangerous form of oppression by which Federal judges,
in contempt of the laws of the States and rights of citizens, become
at once legislators, judges, and executioners."  Plus ca change.

The book to read here is probably _The Burning Tigris_ by Peter
Balakian, which is about American responses to the genocide.  Balakian
needs to be taken with a grain of salt -- he's Armenian-American, and
has an axe or two to grind -- but he does a good job of documenting
American awareness of the massacres and the various attempts to push
the Wilson administration into doing something.  Unsuccessful

Because FDR's Postmaster General was... James Farley, who had other

Eh yourself, my friend.  Bryan was born comfortably upper-middle-class

quite wealthy.  His first two books were bestsellers, and his speaking

Assuming that he got paid for only half of them, and that the average
was a conservative $100 a pop, that's a cool million in early 20th
century gold-backed dollars... equivalent to  about $20-30 million
today.

The man was a media superstar.  Then as now, those don't go hungry.

(Absent great folly, that is, which didn't happen to Bryan.  I wonder
who managed his money?  I'm guessing Mrs. Bryan, but that's just a
guess.)

So, he didn't need to go on those endless Chautauquas to feed his

There is an important difference between Taft's showing in the South and
McKinley's, though:  In McKinley's days there were still a fair number of
black voters.  Taft made his gains in the South almost entirely with white
voters.  And the gains weren't just in the Upper South.  In Georgia, where
Parker had defeated TR 63.7 to 18.3, Bryan got an unimpressive 54.6 to
Taft's 31.2.  (Bryan's weak showing was due only in part to Taft, of
course; Georgia's own Tom Watson was the Populist candidate.  But Watson
had also run in 1904 and got 17.3 percent of the vote in Georgia compared
to only 12.6 percent in 1908.)  Taft's 1908 percentage in Georgia would
not be matched (except of course in 1928) by any Republican presidential
candidate until Eisenhower in 1956, and then just barely...

The GOP seems to have been stuck at around the 40 percent mark in
presidential races in North Carolina from 1912 (with a slight blip in the
Harding landslide year of 1920) until Hoover carried the state in 1928.
(Taft and TR got a combined 40.4 in 1912, Hughes 41.7 in 1916, Harding
43.2 in 1920, Coolidge 39.6 in 1924.)  Again, this shows 1908 to have been
a relatively strong year for the GOP in North Carolina--there weren't very
many states where Taft in 1908 got a higher percentage of the vote than
Harding in 1920...

http://www.iath.virginia.edu/seminar/unit8/demplat.htm

The point though is that it did use that phrase "government by
injunction" that made conservatives livid.  If the party were trying
*solely* to appeal to farmers and silver mining businessmen, they would
not have used that kind of language.

I would agree that free silver got the greatest emphasis, but that was
because it was the issue that got the greatest response.  And not just
from farmers.  The AF of L endorsed free silver in 1894, and Debs talked
almost entirely about free silver in his speaking tour for Bryan.  One
pro-Bryan AF of L executive board member, John B. Lennon,  wrote a puzzled
letter to Gompers, criticizing him for his neutrality in the election,
noting the AF of L's support for free silver and saying "To me it is
indeed strange how a man can believe in a question as an economic demand
and be opposed to the same principle as soon as it becomes a political
question."  Quoted in Philip S. Foner, *History of the Labor Movement in
the United States , Vol. 2*, p. 338.

Foner of course takes the CPUSA popular-front position that the organized
workers were more progressive than Gompers, and that they backed Bryan (he
admits McKinley got many working-class votes but claims they came mostly
from unorganized workers--which is no doubt true, given that American
workers in 1896 were overwhelmingly unorganized...) and tries to emphasize
the extent to which they did so not for free silver reasons but for
broader reasons:  the support of anti-labor employers for McKinley, the
"progressive" non-silver aspects of the Chicago platform, etc.  Still,
even Foner acknowledges

"Large sections of the labor movement were still staunch in their support
of free silver, even though they did not believe that this issue alone was
of concern to the workers and their allies.  Throughout the spring,
summer, and fall of 1896, trade unions, city centrals, and State
Federations informed the AF of L's national headquarters that their
members 'are almost unanimous for the Free and Unlimited coinage of Silver
at the ratio of 16 to 1 regrdless of former party affiliations, believing
that by increasing the volume of Money it will help bring about a revival
in business and thus again bring prosperity to our country.'

"Debs expressed the view of many in the labor movement when he declared
that 'the triumph of Mr. Bryan and free silver would blunt the fangs of
the money power.'"  Foner, pp. 335-6

Putting aside the size and importance of pensions, the dispute was
indeed obscure -- it was over challenges to pension claims.
Apparently a lot of people were spoofing the system and getting
undeserved pensions.  The Republicans wanted more stringent oversight;
the Democratic platform replied that "no names shall be arbitrarily
dropped from the pension rolls, and the fact of enlistment and service
should be deemed conclusive evidence against disease and disability
before enlistment."

And that's it.  It really does look like something more symbolic than
substantive.

Related question: does anyone know where to find federal budget
information for past fiscal years?  The budgets back to 1996 are
available on the main US budget site, but before that?

Pause here.  Are you so sure Bryan will win a second term in 1900?

Bimetallism, while probably not a disaster, is going to be mildly
inflationary, which is going to piss off banks and businessmen.  The
war... well, after the initial surge of victory, at least some people
will be saying, wait, what the hell was that about?  Millions spent,
and we got a couple of naval bases and an obligation to protect the
Philippines?  There will be a large "won the war and lost the peace"
faction, and it will include some Democrats -- remember, OTL
imperialism was demonstrably stronger than its opponents.

Then there's the Cabinet.  McKinley seems to have been a tolerably
competent administrator; he eased one incompetent Cabinet member out
and fired another.  Bryan... well, based on my (admittedly jaundiced)
estimate of his character, I see three possible models (not
necessarily exclusive):

1)  "I expect absolute loyalty, and give it in return!"
2)  "I'm thinking beautiful thoughts about my next speech -- Don't
bother me with these _details_!"
3)  "Fool!  How dare you defy me!"

Let's note that McKinley was able to drop an unpopular and incompetent
Secretary of War, which not all Presidents have found easy to do.
(Lincoln got rid of Cameron PDQ, but, hey, Lincoln.)  Would Bryan be
able to do the same?

More important, there's Bryan's relations with other Democrats and
with the major factions of the party.  OTL he did okay as a candidate,
but the demands of the Presidency are different.

Then there's Congress.  Bryan and Czar Reed!  Who!  Will!  Win!

Also, Mark Hanna is still out there, and he's going to have even
deeper pockets this time -- lots of pissed off banks and railroads.

So, I'm not at all sure that the 1900 election is a lock for Bryan.

&gt;       Bryan was also rather anti-Catholic and towards the end of his

&gt; centuries is not a good time for  a Democrat to be anti-Catholic,
&gt; it'll turn off one of the largest Democrat voting blocs.
">

Some Catholics did look on Bryan with suspicion, and it is true that some
of his Evangelical followers were anti-Catholic and bitterly blamed
Catholics for his 1908 defeat.  (Very few blamed the Jews, though James
Weaver, the 1892 Populist presidential candidate, claimed that they had
voted en masse  for Taft because he was a Unitarian and therefore a fellow
disbeliever in the divinity of Christ!)  And of course many Jews were
concerned about the use of anti-Semitic stereotypes in Populist attacks on
"international bankers."

(I realize that you did not accuse Bryan of anti-Semitism, but because
"Bryan," "Populism" and "anti-Semitism" are associated in some people's
minds, and because the Klan of the 1920's--which admired Bryan, though as
I will point out below, the feeling was not mutual--was both anti-Catholic
and anti-Semitic, I thought the issue of anti-Semitism should also be
considered here.)

However, it seems to me that Bryan himself should be acquitted of both
anti-Catholicism and anti-Semitism:

(1)  On anti-Catholicism, Michael Kazin in *A Godly Hero:  The Life of
William Jennings Bryan* (p. 166), after quoting some bitter Catholic-
bashing by Bryan's correspondents after his 1908 loss, notes:

"Bryan had never trafficked in such slurs himself.  Despite his
evangelical beliefs, he was always ecumenical toward his fellow
Christians, whether native-born or immigrant.  In his races for Congress
and the presidency, he had benefited from his party's reputation for
religious tolerance.  [Elsewhere in the book, Kazin notes that while
German-Americans in the Midwest deserted the Democrats in 1896, most
Irish-Americans there did not, in spite of the lackluster support for
Bryan by the urban machines and a well-publicized endorsement of McKinley
by the Midwest's leading prelate, Archbishop John Ireland.]  He knew it
would be foolish to alienate Catholics, the only denomination outside the
white South that reliably voted Democratic.  In 1908, Bryan took pains to
see that an Irish Catholic attorney gave his main nominating spech, and he
was disappointed to learn that Norman Mack, the DNC's new chairman, was
not a member of the Church, as he had thought...

"During the campaign, Bryan worried that the GOP would use this episode
[Taft's suuceesful negotiations with the Vatican for the sale to the US
government of 410,000 acres of land owned by various monastic orders in
the Philippines] to strip away urban votes he badly needed.  He also had
to deny charges that his praise of Protestant missionaries in Asia
slighted their Catholic counterparts.  In early September, Bryan
distributed a public letter citing the names of prominent Catholics active
in his campaign and included a warm address he had recently given to the
Hibernian Society of Washington, DC.  Diocesan papers printed the letter
in full and gave no indication that they preferred Taft over the candidate
of the party Catholics had traditionally supported.  If anything, Church-
sponsored publications leaned slightly toward Bryan while training their
fire on Debs and his allies for their 'vile attacks on the Catholic
hierarchy.'"  (As Kazin observes, though, such facts "made no impression
on angry Bryanites.")

Even Bryan's opposition to denouncing the Klan by name at the 1924
convention, however deplorable, was not motivated by anti-Catholicism or
anti-Semitism.  It was simply a matter of political opportunism; Bryan
knew that the sort of Prohibitionist, anti-big-business candidate he
wanted the Democrats to nominate would need Klan support in the South and
West.  Even in opposing a resolution naming the Klan, he made it clear
that he did not support the Klan and did not agree with its views of
Catholics or Jews.  (He said nothing of the Klan's views on blacks, which
he *did* pretty much share.  But so did plenty of opponents of the Klan.
An Alabama conservative like Oscar Underwood obviously didn't oppose the
Klan because it was anti-black.  In fact, one of Underwood's arguments
against Klansmen and other Prohibitionists  was that if the federal
government could override states' rights where liquor was concerned, it
would soon do the same with race relations...)

'[The explicitly anti-Klan resolution] is not necessary...first, because
the laws protect every one.  Second, it is not necessary to protect any
church.  I, my friends, have such confidence in the Catholic Church, which
was for over a thousand years my mother church as well as yours.

"It was the Catholic Church that took religion from its founder, and
preserved it, the only custodian, for a thousand years, and when they did
it for the Catholic, they did it for me and for every President
[obviously, what Bryan really said was "Protestant" but the error in
transcription is perhaps understandable, given that Bryan had run for
President three times and some people thought that even in 1924 he still
hoped for the nomination in the event of a deadlock...].

"The Catholic Church, with its legacy of martyred blood and with all the
testimony of its missionaries who went into every line [land?] does not
need a great party to protect it from a million men.  The Jews do not need
this resolution.  They have Moses.  They have Elijah.  They have Elisha,
who was able to draw back the curtain and show upon the mountain tops an
invisible host greater than a thousand Ku Klux Klans.  And both the
Catholic Church as well as the Jewish faith, has its great characters to-
day who plead for respect for them, and whose pleading is not in vain.  It
is not necessary, and, my friends, the Ku Klux Klan does not deserve the
advertisement that you give them."

http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN040505906X&amp;id=BymfaxRPDHkC&amp;pg=P...

At that very convention, incidentally, in giving a list of presidential
candidates he thought satisfactory, Bryan named Montana's Senator Thomas
Walsh as one of them.  (Walsh was a Catholic, but also a Westerner, an
economic progressive, a Prohibitionist, and a man untied to urban
political machines.  The fact that both McAdoo and Bryan indicated that
they could support Walsh is significant in showing that the Western and
Southern opposition to Al Smith was by no means exlcusively motivated by
anti-Catholicism, though that was certainly part of it.)

(2) On anti-Semitism:  Here again one must distinguish between *some* of
Bryan's followers and the man himself.  In 1896, Bryan was careful to
explain:

"Our opponents have sometimes tried to make it appear that we were
attacking a race when we denounced the financial policy advocated by the
Rothschilds.  But we are not; we are as much opposed to the financial
policy of J. Pierpont Morgan as we are to the financial policy of the
Rothschilds.  We are not attacking a race; we are attacking greed and
avarice, which know neither race nor religion. I do not know of any class
of our people who, by reason of their history, can better sympathize with
the struggling masses in this campaign than can the Hebrew race."
http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC30986706&amp;id=-hU39f_4BUoC&amp;pg=PA5...

Bryan was a warm champion of Louis Brandeis's appointment to the Supreme
Court, and even suggested Brandeis as a presidential candidate in 1920.
And as noted, in his 1924 speech to the the Democratic convention, Bryan
praised Jews as well as Catholics.  Furthermore, as Kazin notes (p. 273)
"Bryan attacked Henry Ford for reprinting the anti-Semitic fraud *The
Protocols of the Elders of Zion* in his Dearborn newspaper.  He also
accepted several invitations to speak at synagogues."

In short, religious diversity as such did not bother Bryan.  Unlike the
Klansmen of the 1920s, he was not worried about America becoming
increasingly Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Jewish. What he really
disliked were those of his fellow Protestants who embraced Modernism and
Darwinism.  In fact, in the Scopes case, he unsuccesfully tried to get his
friends Samuel Untermeyer [1] and Senator Thomas Walsh involved in the
prosecution to show that anti-Darwinism was not just a Protestant crusade.

[1] "'Being a Jew, he ought to be interested in defending Moses from the
Darwinites,' Bryan suggested."

I'd be interested in your views on how the degree to which the Klan's
endorsement derailed Bryan's career.

The parallel is Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker took 15 years
to first get elected to Parliament and my view is that a large part of
the reason was unwanted Klan endorsement in the 1925 and 1926
elections which caused him to lose thousands of votes from voters who
didn't want anything to do with the Klan.

Had he been elected in 1930 or 1935 he might well have been
Conservative Party leader in 1949 and had a shot at winning the
election instead of his party losing what up till then was then
largest majority ever elected in Canada. (He eventually became PM in
1957 and himself won a large majority government in 1958 setting a
record that wasn't broken till 1984)

Obviously the two are 50 years apart, but both were populists with a
lot of support in rural areas and both were unjustifiably tarred by an
unwanted association with the KKK.

&gt; very unlikely that Bryan could nationalize the railroads but he could
&gt; get them to be more regulated and that might lead to nationalization
&gt; sometime in the early 20th century if its seen as necessary, say if a
&gt; Great Depression happens in this ATL. If the railroads are
&gt; nationalized it might lead to an ATL where the US has decent railroad
&gt; travel outside of the Washington-Boston corridor.
">

Bryan did not come out for government ownership of the railroads until
after he returned from Europe in 1906.  (He had been impressed by the
efficiency of the German railroads.)  It got a chilly reception not only
from the press (as might be expected) but also (though more quietly) from
some leading southern Democrats who feared that it might endanger railroad
segregation in the South.

Bryan was bitter about this, telling some southern lawmakers "You...are
opposed to government ownership because you are afraid your Jim Crow laws
against the negroes will be abolished by the general government.  As if
your personal objections to riding with negroes should interfere with a
great national reform."  (Michael Kazin, *A Godly Hero: The Life of
WIlliam Jennings Bryan*, p. 147)  But he bowed to political realities,
assuring Democrats that he had spoken for himself alone on government
ownership and that he would not insist on its being included in the 1908
platform (though he did urge that the idea at least be kept in mind if
regulaton proved insufficient.

From all this I think it clear that if elected in 1896, Bryan would favor
stricter regulation of the rialroads, but not government ownership.  At
most he might hint at the latter as a last resort; as he was to note in
1906, even those who disagreed with him on government ownership should
keep in mind that the *threat* of it would  exercise a restraining
influence on the "railroad magantes." (Kazin, p. 146)

Bryan in 1924 was near the end of his political career (and his life).  Had
he come out in favor of the plank denouncing the Klan by name, it would
almost certainly have led to the plank being adopted (it was defeated in OTL
by only one vote, supposedly because the band infuriated southern delegates
by striking up "Marching Through Georgia") and would have somewhat improved
Bryan's reputation with subsequent historians, but would have little effect
on the 1924 election.  The Democrats might have done a bit better among
Catholics, a bit worse in Klan strongholds.  But as 1928 shows, even  a
Catholic at the head of the ticket, let alone a denunciation of the Klan,
would not have been enough to enable them to carry most of the Northeast.
And Davis would have easily carried the Solid South even with an anti-Klan
plank (in none of the eleven ex-Confederate states was the vote even really
close in 1924, not even in Tennessee, which had gone for Harding in 1920).
[1]

Much is made of the failure of the Democratic party in 1924 to denounce the
Klan by name in its platform, and yet usually nothing is said of the
Republicans' failure to do the same that year.  The Republican convention
adopted (with a minimum of fuss) a general endorsement of "unyielding
devotion to the Constitution and to the guarantees of civil, political and
religious liberty therein contained" without condemning the Klan by name,
leading a jokester to quip after the Democrats' Madison Square Garden fiasco:
"Say 'KKK' to an elephant and it says 'Ain't the moon beautiful'; say it to a
donkey and it kicks itself all over the place."  Coolidge quietly made it
clear that he was not anti-Catholic (for example, by addressing the Holy Name
Society) and he got the votes of some Catholics embittered by the Democrats'
failure to nominate Smith and failure to explicitly denounce the Klan--even
in New York City, some Catholics split their votes for "Cal and Al [Smith]"--
while at the same time picking up many Klan votes (partly because he was the
most unequivcally pro-Prohibition of the three candidates).

anti-Klan platform might have hurt Davis in Kentucky, but he narrowly lost
that state anyway.  The one state which Davis carried where an anti-Klan
plank just might have defeated him is Oklahoma.
