As usual, I have received two copies of DR's messages, and have
previously presumed it was due in some way to his cross-posting to
numerous Newsgroups.  However, the following shows an interesting
discrepancy in the titles of Craig's article.

Now I am totally confused about whether 'Botetourte' is with or
without an 'e' at the end, as shown in the two titles of Craig's
article.  Which is the correct modern historians' usage/modern
convention/correct modern form/contemporary spelling/DR's 'rule of
thumb' convention?

Can someone elucidate?

Diana

Botetourt (died 1324)

Dear Newsgroup ~

I''ve revised and expanded the note in my files concerning the
parentage of Sir John Botetourt, Knt., 1st Lord Botetourt (died
1324).  It currently reads as follows:

Note: The author F.N. Craig published a brilliant article entitled
&quot;The Parentage of John Botetourte&quot; in TAG, 63 (1988): 145-153, which
article provides compelling evidence that John Botetourt, 1st Lord
Botetourt, is the son and heir of Guy Botetourt, Knt., of Cantley,
Upton, Ellingham, and Kerebrook, Norfolk, by his wife, Ada.

Dear Diana ~

I apologize for the confusion.  I often read my messages after I post
them.   If I find I made a mistake or typo in the original post (which
happens), I occasionally repost the message with the necessary
correction(s).   I then remove the original message from the Google
Archives.  I did that tonight with my post on the parentage of John
Botetourt.

This past week, however, I simply posted the corrections to one
message and let the original stand as it.  So I don't always post a
corrected message and remove the original.

As far as it goes, the title of Mr. Craig's article spells the surname
Botetourt without an &quot;e.&quot;   That is what I corrected in my second
post.   Your eagle eye caught the difference.

DR

But, of course, since Google is not USENET, as you have been told,
your action does nothing to remove the post from USENET, the GEN-
MEDIEVAL mailing list nor its archive, which you have also been told.
This is why a correction is a better way of addressing such issues, as
you have been told.

Why don't people like you read these explanations and learn from them?
To quote a poster to this group, &quot;Probably because they don't want to
learn anything I suppose.&quot;

Isn't that pointless?  The original message and it's clone are both
preserved in the separate archives of Gen-Medievel aren't they?

Todd you're very silly.
Why learn when you can preach and dictate ?
