Parmesan Puffs

Egg whites give these quick, cheesy nibbles their exceptionally light
texture. Bite-size portions make them the perfect mouth-popping
accompaniment to an aperitif.

About 6 cups vegetable oil
1/4 lb finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (2 cups)
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 large egg whites at room temperature

Special equipment: a deep-fat thermometer

Heat 2 inches oil in a deep 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat
until
it registers 360 F on thermometer.

While oil heats, mix together cheese, flour, pepper, and salt in a bowl
until combined well. Beat whites in another bowl with an electric mixer
until they just hold stiff peaks. Fold in 1/2 cup cheese mixture to
lighten, then fold in remaining cheese mixture gently but thoroughly.
Drop about 8 teaspoons of batter, 1 teaspoon at a time, into oil and fry,
turning occasionally, until balls of batter are puffed, crisp, and golden,
about 2 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain
briefly. Make 3 more batches in same manner, returning oil to 360 F
between batches. Serve immediately.

Cooks' note: Do not use pre-grated cheese, or parmesan puffs will not have
a delicate texture.

Makes about 32 hors d'oeuvres.
