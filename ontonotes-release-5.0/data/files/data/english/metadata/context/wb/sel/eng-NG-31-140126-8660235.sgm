Seems to me that you just hate Vick...
Again, what did he do?
Until now all I've gotten is a bunch of allegations, circumstantial evidence
and that one of his houses was involved in a dogfighting incident.
I can't stop wondering what do you have against this guy.
If he did provide for dogfighting, he should endup in jail but until he is
found guilty, HE IS INNOCENT.
Is it his race?  just wondering!

IY-  I'd says should give Euph, or any other Vick &quot;hater&quot; the benefit of the
doubt, at least as it ascribes to race.

I listened to Porsche's interview, and found it sad, as it seems obvious
Vick realizes he is fucked.  This does not smell like a witchhunt from where
I am standing, and Vick seems like he finally understands he pissed away his
&quot;Blank&quot; check.

I think you are a tad sloppy in your definition of &quot;innocent&quot;.  Until Vick
is found &quot;not guilty&quot;, he certainly isn't innocent.  He may not be guilty
until convicted, but he certainly isn't innocent until the verdict is read.

There you go again.  &quot;Is it his race?&quot;

That's pathetic Yunes.  Get a life.  I've been more objective
regarding Vick's situation than most others.

I don't owe him any presumption of innocence - I am not the judge or
the jury.  I have an opinion which, unlike yours, is based on actual
information.

If you want Vick to be innocent, so be it.  When he's found guilty or
cops a plea, you can blame it on racism.  That's your problem, not
mine.

Vick's buddy Taylor has pleaded guilty and says Vick funded the dog
fighting operations.  Is he lying?  He's black... so it can't be
racism.

Inabon, the old adage of &quot;let the courts decide&quot; is no longer valid.

OJ Simpson:  Reality = guilty, courts = not guilty
Jason Williams:  Reality = guilty, courts = not guilty
Robert Blake:  Reality = guilty, courts = not guilty
etc., etc., etc.

The evidence, although not yet presented in court, is overwhelming
against Vick.  The people who have taken action (NFL, Nike, Reebok)
don't do it lightly - if Vick was ever found completely innocent of
everything then they'd all look like shit.

Bear in mind that &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; ONLY applies to the
justice system.  That restriction does not apply to all other facets
of life.

Right now Vick can't say anything remotely specific while his lawyers
are busy weaving a story together that fits whatever facts they can't
deny.  The less detail they have to &quot;fit&quot; the better, so that's why he
has to shut the fuck up...  At the same time they DO want him out
there apologizing for all the unwanted attention and any APPEARANCE of
impropriety this all has created.  He'll undoubtedly say that he
should have been more careful about whom he picked as friends and
being naive about trusting people who were deceiving him...  all while
declaring his innocence and looking forward to his day in court so he
can clear his name.

We can be pretty sure that his name won't get cleared and that he'll
gladly settle for a not guilty on any of the charges that would get
him jail time.  Meanwhile, he will remain humble and contrite - the
very picture of innocence.

In my opinion he should have ditched that leather-look pinstripe suit
he wore to his arraignment.  The &quot;pimp&quot; fashion statements don't help
his case.

Beyond the game?  What the fuck does THAT mean?  Vick and the Atlanta
Falcons aren't even in MY game.

You're just projecting your prejudices on to me - calling me a racist.
I could give a shit if Vick was black, white or whatever.  Everything
I've said about his case is based on what's known of him, his character
or the facts that have been alleged in numerous reports.  Your sandbag
defense of him amounts to pig-headed denial.  Presumption of innocence??
That has nothing whatsoever to do with any individual belief or
discussion.  In case you haven't noticed, this isn't a court.

It is brutally clear that Vick was absolutely involved in this dog
fighting ring.  He owned the property and there are people who place him
AT the dog fights and NOW there's a cohort who makes him the money man
and the instigator behind the whole Bad Newz Kennels set up.  The
reports I have read even say that there will be a witness who will
testify that Vick actually participated in the killing of a number of
dogs in very brutal manners.

Do you really think that people are just making up all this shit just to
frame Vick?  Why?  Because he's black?!

I think this is just YOU being a pain-in-the-ass and making inflammatory
statements about me and others with whom you disagree simply because you
have nothing else to bring to the table.

No, but every time he said,&quot;** Mike Vick**&quot;and he spoke of himself in the
third person, quite a few times. I laughed.  The radio station had an alarm

was asked nothing and said nothing, fluff.  Funny with the AM show though!!

The only thing &quot;racial&quot; about this subject, insofar as I am concerned,
is the fact that this &quot;sport&quot; that was once the stuff of backwoods,
white-trash rednecks is now an urban pastime and apparently has become
an inner city fixture.  I guess I had noticed that pitbulls were
becoming the dog of choice for many blacks...  but I had sort of
assumed that it was for self protection and maybe they were living in
a high crime area.  Given that dog breed ownership, like many things,
runs in fads, it didn't occur to me that this was a symptom or sign
that dog fighting was driving that fad.

Back when &quot;Lassie&quot; was a big hit TV show, every family in the country
had to have a collie.  When &quot;Snoopy&quot; became such a hit for Charles
Schultz, everybody wanted a beagle.  Apparently pit bulls are more
than just a fad... but I still don't get how anyone could have a pet
and then put it into a pit for a death fight.  Makes no sense to
me...  Any dog owner that loves their pet will tell you that they'd no
sooner do that than they they would toss their child into that ring.

&gt; &gt; You're just projecting your prejudices on to me - calling me a racist. I

&gt; &gt; nothing whatsoever to do with any individual belief or discussion.  In
&gt; &gt; case you haven't noticed, this isn't a court.

&gt; &gt; It is brutally clear that Vick was absolutely involved in this dog
&gt; &gt; fighting ring.  He owned the property and there are people who place him
&gt; &gt; AT the dog fights and NOW there's a cohort who makes him the money man
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; the instigator behind the whole Bad Newz Kennels set up.  The reports I
&gt; &gt; have read even say that there will be a witness who will testify that
&gt; &gt; Vick
&gt; &gt; actually participated in the killing of a number of dogs in very brutal
&gt; &gt; manners.

&gt; &gt; Do you really think that people are just making up all this shit just to
&gt; &gt; frame Vick?  Why?  Because he's black?!

&gt; &gt; I think this is just YOU being a pain-in-the-ass and making inflammatory
&gt; &gt; statements about me and others with whom you disagree simply because you
&gt; &gt; have nothing else to bring to the table.

What makes you assume that &quot;black&quot; has to automatically mean &quot;urban&quot; or
&quot;inner city&quot;?  The three most prominent black athletes that have spoken out
on Vick's behalf have all had southern and somewhat rural childhoods.

Emmit Smith was raised in Pensacola, (FL) Deion Sanders in North Fort
Meyers, FL and Clinton Portis comes from Laurel... Mississippi.  None are
what I would classify as high crime, inner city, urban enclaves.

As a matter of fact... until his agent (Rosenhaus) told him to shut the fuck
up before he lost endorsements... Portis said that Vick's involvement
received too much media attention and claimed that dog fighting was a
prevalent part of life in his hometown.  He even expressed surprise when
informed that it was a felony.

I think you had it right when you referred to it backwoods and red-necks...
just not exclusively &quot;white trash&quot;.  It appears to be pretty much color
blind.  But then again... stupid, ignorant and being a fucked-up scumbag
asshole have nothing to do with race.

who came out against anything associated with it was Russell Simmons.  And
when I saw Al Sharpton publicly condemn it... I naturally assumed that the

Don't spend much time in me.  As you can see, I consider you a good dolfan
and hold your opinions as a phin in high regards.
I am just surprised to see you bring a barrage against a non dolphin player
as if you had something against him.
Until now, I haven't seen any concrete evidence against Vick whom I like
much as a player.  If he is guilty, well, I have to live with it.  But!
until then, I am not going to jump in the media's bandwagon hoping that they
and the already discredited federal prosecutors are just using a celebrity
to gain notoriety.
Well, I do have some problems with prejudiced people and many who are not
prejudiced may utter comments that may be considered racist.  I think you
may have fallen for it.

Dear Mr. T.Coward, oops, Mr. T. Gowan...
I am not a minority in any white nation.  The fact that I speak a different
language has nothing to do with my race (white).
As I can see in all the time that I've been in the US, everybody here is a
minority and that has nothing to do with my comments.
Now, get over it!  You are as much a minority as anybody else here.
This has nothing to do with any race.  Is just that I feel that the hatred
against Vick has a mysterious nature.
The guy is good in his profession and I suggest we all wait and see what
happens before jumping to conclusions.

everyone who disagrees with you on this NG a racist.  You're a pirate,
so you hate hard working, honest, sea-faring people.  You hate America

The problem here is that you consistently bring nothing but empty
boxes to the party.  You say you haven't seen any concrete evidence
against Vick...  That comment alone proves that you're either blind or
deaf.  I don't see you addressing the FACTS at all...

Did you miss the interview with the confessed dog fighter who places
Vick at these fights?

Did you miss the news that one of Vick's co-conspirators has now pled
out and will implicate Vick as the &quot;money man&quot; and will testify that
Vick participated in the execution of several dogs?

Is the fact that Vick BOUGHT the home that housed the &quot;Bad Newz
Kennel&quot; totally lost on you?  Do you not see the obvious truth here?
At the very least you need to explain why the federal government and
all these witnesses are lining up to frame Michael Vick.  If you start
going off on some sort of racial rant about how this is because he's
black, then you just further prove how completely ignorant you truly
are.

Lest you forget, I was the guy who originally insisted that they
probably wouldn't indict Vick because they probably would not be able
to find a &quot;smoking dog.&quot;  I was wrong in that assessment...  they
*have* him and he's going down.  Why?

Because he's guilty.

Your bullshit is just astounding Iggy...  it's nearly impossible to
take you seriously.

Inabon,

1.  There is not always &quot;concrete&quot; evidence in a criminal trial.
That's why the standard in the USA (and most of the civilized world)
is &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;, not &quot;no doubt&quot;.  After all, there are
very few people who actually saw/heard Vick's involvement.  It's up to
us whether we believe those who did, versus Vick's &quot;I didn't know
anything about it.&quot;  Remember, if a man can commit a federal crime ...
he can also lie.

2.  The courts don't always get it right, so it's no longer valid to
say &quot;let the courts decide&quot;.  OJ Simpson, Brian Williams, Robert
Blake, etc.

3.  This is a federal indictment.  There is much less celebrity and
status when the feds are involved.  They don't indict unless they're
convinced they'll get a conviction, very much unlike the local DAs.

4.  The feds aren't after Vick because of his celebrity - they're
after him because he's the TOP MAN in this entire operation.  He
supplied the financing, was involved in the planning, and was there
during the execution (no pun intended).

You clearly hate Anglo Americans, you hate Whitey.  And you've called
everyone who disagrees with you on this NG a racist.  You're a pirate,
so you hate hard working, honest, sea-faring people.  You hate America

The problem is that I've seen similar stuff before.  People that try to get
away by accusing others.
Is this the case here? I don't know and I don't care.
If Vick is guilty, let him pay.  But what if he is just what he says?  A
person who's friends and family took advantage of his trust.  I've seen that
happen too.
See, if he was arrested during a dog fight, I would've been with PETA
protesting.  That wasn't the case.

The problem here is that you consistently bring nothing but empty

against Vick...  That comment alone proves that you're either blind or
deaf.  I don't see you addressing the FACTS at all...

Did you miss the interview with the confessed dog fighter who places
Vick at these fights?

Did you miss the news that one of Vick's co-conspirators has now pled
out and will implicate Vick as the &quot;money man&quot; and will testify that
Vick participated in the execution of several dogs?

Is the fact that Vick BOUGHT the home that housed the &quot;Bad Newz
Kennel&quot; totally lost on you?  Do you not see the obvious truth here?
At the very least you need to explain why the federal government and
all these witnesses are lining up to frame Michael Vick.  If you start
going off on some sort of racial rant about how this is because he's
black, then you just further prove how completely ignorant you truly
are.

Lest you forget, I was the guy who originally insisted that they
probably wouldn't indict Vick because they probably would not be able
to find a &quot;smoking dog.&quot;  I was wrong in that assessment...  they
*have* him and he's going down.  Why?

Because he's guilty.

Your bullshit is just astounding Iggy...  it's nearly impossible to

What you say is possible.  But it is also possible that a millionaire like
Vick was used as a coverup for a dogfighting ring and he had no idea of it.
The evidence shown points to either one of both.  Lets see!

&gt; Inabon,

&gt; 1.  There is not always &quot;concrete&quot; evidence in a criminal trial.
&gt; That's why the standard in the USA (and most of the civilized world)
&gt; is &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;, not &quot;no doubt&quot;.  After all, there are
&gt; very few people who actually saw/heard Vick's involvement.  It's up to
&gt; us whether we believe those who did, versus Vick's &quot;I didn't know
&gt; anything about it.&quot;  Remember, if a man can commit a federal crime ...
&gt; he can also lie.

&gt; 2.  The courts don't always get it right, so it's no longer valid to
&gt; say &quot;let the courts decide&quot;.  OJ Simpson, Brian Williams, Robert
&gt; Blake, etc.

&gt; 3.  This is a federal indictment.  There is much less celebrity and
&gt; status when the feds are involved.  They don't indict unless they're
&gt; convinced they'll get a conviction, very much unlike the local DAs.

&gt; 4.  The feds aren't after Vick because of his celebrity - they're
&gt; after him because he's the TOP MAN in this entire operation.  He
&gt; supplied the financing, was involved in the planning, and was there
&gt; during the execution (no pun intended).

First of all, this is the freaking internet.  Actually just a simple group
in millions inside this media.
I can't try to push my opinion on others, I just can't.  You read my post
and you agree or disagree with it.  But just because I don't follow the
mainstream in many issues doesn't mean that my opinion is the ultimate one.
Mine is one of many.  The racist issue arouse by not understanding the
motives behind accusing Vick of something that he may well be innocent.
There was no arrest or videos or confessions.  If someone provided a
cellphone video of Vick rooting for a dog during a fight, that was another
story.  Why is that so hard to understand.  I guess that something is
blinding some people here.  There is where the racist issue came to my mind.
But I didn't accuse anyone of being racist.  I just posted the possibility.
Are you trying to imply that there are no racists in this group?  you got to
be kidding!  There are and you may be one of them.

Aryans never existed, it was the big mistake of Hitler.  Aryans in sanscript
means nobles.  The ones that wrote the Vedas in old Indian myth were the
same indis that are alive today, they are black or tan skinned.
My white race is just one of many that deserve respect according to their

As for chickens let me ask you something.
If you were given the choice to live healthy and free among females or to
live in a cage waiting for someone to butcher you before you reach
adulthood, what would you choose?
That is the faith of FIGHTING ROOSTERS vs KFC chicken.
Fighting roosters when they fight they are just driven by a natural instinc
and they are happy with that.
I don't think that you have chosen to be a KFC chicken vs a righting

No wonder people here accuse to be a troll.  This line was about Vick and
here we are arguing about races, lol...
Listen, you ignore many facts...
First of all, the Caucasians didn't come from the Caucasus, the first time
an anthropologist named a skull as Caucasian happens to be from that area.
Nevertheless, the first Caucasians found today come from Somalia and yes,
HE/SHE WAS BLACK.
You mentioned a lot of Caucasians all right, but forgot to mention the
Australian aborigines, the Somalis, the New Zealander natives and many
others that are black from North East Africa.
I stay with my remark that the Aryans never existed as though by White
Supremacists to what I answered.
Aryan is the translation of noble from old Hindi.  The ones that wrote the
Vedas.
I do agree with you in many things that you say except that Aryans as a race
NEVER EXISTED.
Actually, if there is a nation that can be called Aryan happens to be the
Iranians who claim the root.
Just because scientists of the time named a skull from the Caucasus,
Caucasian doesn't mean that the face phenotype originated there.  There were
Caucasians in India and Africa long before there were people in the
Caucasus.
Now, who has the &quot;totally ignorant view&quot;?
Caucasians from India and North East Africa emigrated North where conditions
permitted the lighter skinned phenotypes to evolved to such environment.
BTW, Northern Africans weren't white at all, the people who built the
pyramids were black.  They may had been Caucasians but not white.  They
didn't develop lighter skin until later.
Having said that, WHAT THE HECK ALL THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE ORIGINAL POST?

It will be unfair to continue the argument against you.  When you start

you have no other arguement you start the name calling, then they say that I

One other thing, while there is no way to know skin color from bones, there
are many other sources to tell you.

Onother thing, native Somalis are caucasians, their bones are found

The caucasoid Somalis populated India and Indonesia all the way East to New

Once modern humans started populating more temperate regions, the white skin

Clearly NY Teacher has shown that you have no idea which characteristics are
natural to which races.  You seem to go more on feel than on fact or
intelligence.  But why would you call anyone a mutt based on characteristics
you aren't sure of?  What color are my eyebrows?  You have no idea.  But you
offered up an opinion on it, quite by feel rather than fact or intelligence.
This characteristic reveals you to be aggressively stupid.

Do you enjoy saying this?  I find that when simple people learn something
new they like to tell it to as many people as possible, like they're
teaching it to others.  So far my unofficial count has you reminding this NG
at least a half dozen times that the Aryan race never existed.  You can't
honestly believe that this one tidbit is going to convince folks that you
are anything more than we already know you to be.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As for the chicken deal, you didn't answer my question.

">

You can't sugar coat the fact that you raise roosters in order to make them
kill each other for your pleasure.  You torment them to make them
aggressive.  You give them drugs such as strychnine, caffeine, amphetamines
and epinephrine in order to make them more aggressive, increase their
endurance and clot the blood that's sure to flow when you put them in a
fight.

You saw off their natural spurs and replace them with razor sharp &quot;gaffs.&quot;
Once the birds have been pitted against each other, they peck and maim each
other with their beaks and gaffs.  Sometimes the gaffs, which may be up to 3
inches long, get stuck deep into one of the birds so they have to be
physically separated so the fight can continue.  The fight ends when one of
the birds is either killed or becomes too weak to fight.  The loser gets
tossed on the garbage heap, the winner will likely die from his injuries and
winds up suffering the same fate as the losing bird.

That's some superior option you've presented, dill hole.  On the one hand,
animals are raised for human consumption.  That's
animal husbandry.  On the other hand, animals are raised and trained to rip
each other apart for the pleasure of sadistic pricks with money to wager.
That's cruelty.  And it's also indicative of a lesser evolved life form.
But we already knew this about you, Iggy.

The difference between you and Michael Vick is that at least Vick has the
decency to lie about his blood lust.  You're proud of it even though it's
something that should make you feel shame.  You're too stupid to feel shame.
That pretty much makes you an animal.

I think we agree in more points than we disagree but it doesn't matter, does
it?
1. I called these people mutt because they are compare to me, lol.  It is OK
to be a mutt, all of us are if we aren't homozygotic blacks.
2. There is plenty of evidence that the Egyptians were black, you just don't
want to see it.  Now, take a look at this painting in Egypt,
http://www.myegypt.co.uk/users/www.myegypt.co.uk/upload/logos_015.jpg
I wonder if all the painting faded only for the females or got darker just
for the males.
There isn't worst blind than he who doesn't want to see.
3. The first modern humans developed in Africa and there is no way that a
light skin would have survived the stinging sun of Africa.  Is just common
sense.  But if you have any doubt, just go Ethiopia or Somalia, the cradles
of human kind, and try to find one, just one tribe with light skin.  The
lighter skin is found deep in So. Africa and is not white is reddish.  They
are the Bushmen.
For 200k years, human lived in Africa because they didn't have demographic
pressure to expand.  They were in equilibrium with nature, a Real Paradise
which may have inspired Moses when he wrote Genesis.  After the development
of agriculture, the expansion began towards the Middle East and India, God
knows which one was first.  From India and So East Asia, humans populated
what is now China and Siberia.  In the Middle East the quickly populated
Greece, Italy and the rest of Europe.
4. BTW, I don't need evidence for none of this, is your responsibility as a
teacher to come out an seek other history sources around the world.  As you
already know, US history has been tampered with and don't tell things
exactly as it happened.  I suggest reading Russian, Chinese, Indian, Greek,
Italian and Japanese history books.  They may enlighten you, lol, or so I
hope.

If you want to call me names again, fine!
If you want to say that I have no evidence to proof my points, fine!
If you want to ignore history's facts, fine!

But the one thing you can't do is to ignore your African Nature, it is deep
in your DNA because you share with them DNA, Cells, 2 eyes, 2 arms, 2 feet
and specially, 2 ankles.  And those characteristics are first found in
AFRICA.  Since Africa has a direct hit from the sun year around, Our
original skin told the cells that controlled melanin production to do it
early in life to cover the entire skin.  That is the perfect skin.  Being
white is just the lack of melanin coverage, it is a minus not a plus
anywhere.

Wao, I just gave you a free history class, I think you owe me, AGAIN!

I won't last for ever, I suggest that if you want to continue as a teacher,
please, read more and educate yourself.  I bet you teach in Jefferson or
maybe Walton.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, wrong again.  Please cite your source.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, the first Caucasians found today come from Somalia and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yes, HE/SHE WAS BLACK.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dark skinned, you mean...and it is impiossible to tell skin color from a
&gt;&gt;&gt; fossilized bone, bone-head.  And like i said, skin color is NOT an
&gt;&gt;&gt; accurate indication of race.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You mentioned a lot of Caucasians all right, but forgot to mention the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Australian aborigines, the Somalis, the New Zealander natives and many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others that are black from North East Africa.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I never meant the list to be all inclusive, Cinnabuns...but the fact
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you list the Aborigines and Maoris as caucasian - with none of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; associated phenotypes (specifically hair texture and nasal
&gt;&gt;&gt; construction) - shows that you are suffering from verbal diahhrea,
&gt;&gt;&gt; again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I stay with my remark that the Aryans never existed as though by White
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Supremacists to what I answered.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I agreed to that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Aryan is the translation of noble from old Hindi.  The ones that wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Vedas.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, it refers to the tribe that migrated FROM THE CAUCASUS REGION, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; conquered the Dravidians.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do agree with you in many things that you say except that Aryans as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; race NEVER EXISTED.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, numbnuts, i agreed with that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, if there is a nation that can be called Aryan happens to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Iranians who claim the root.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.  The country was originally Persia, and changed its name to Iran
&gt;&gt;&gt; (the Persian word for Aryan) because its Shah at the time wanted to
&gt;&gt;&gt; liberate his land from British and Soviet influences...the easiest way
&gt;&gt;&gt; to do that was to side with nazi Germany.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just because scientists of the time named a skull from the Caucasus,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Caucasian doesn't mean that the face phenotype originated there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If that was actually what happened, you would be correct...but it isnt,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and you arent

&gt;&gt;&gt; There were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Caucasians in India and Africa long before there were people in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Caucasus.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No evidence for that statement either...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, who has the &quot;totally ignorant view&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you really want that answered, numbnuts?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Caucasians from India and North East Africa emigrated North where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conditions permitted the lighter skinned phenotypes to evolved to such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; environment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps, but prehistoric migratory patterns are very sketchy at best.
&gt;&gt;&gt; We know, for example, that earlier hominids spread throughout the world
&gt;&gt;&gt; before H. sapien sapien began to dominate the world...so who can say
&gt;&gt;&gt; what the patterns of movement were?  Based on your statements, Iggybuns,
&gt;&gt;&gt; you just might be one of the H. habilus that migrated about...I'd say
&gt;&gt;&gt; you were H. erectus, but I doubt there is anythign erect about you...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW, Northern Africans weren't white at all, the people who built the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pyramids were black.  They may had been Caucasians but not white.  They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't develop lighter skin until later.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Read what I said again, dipstick...skin color is not an indication of
&gt;&gt;&gt; race! There are caucasians of many skin colors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having said that, WHAT THE HECK ALL THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE ORIGINAL
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POST?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good question...you brought it up.

&gt;&gt; lol
&gt;&gt; I never claimed to be from a superior race.  I just called mutts those
&gt;&gt; that claim to be whites and Aryans but don't have all the characteristics
&gt;&gt; of the race.

&gt; Clearly NY Teacher has shown that you have no idea which characteristics
&gt; are natural to which races.  You seem to go more on feel than on fact or
&gt; intelligence.  But why would you call anyone a mutt based on
&gt; characteristics you aren't sure of?  What color are my eyebrows?  You have
&gt; no idea.  But you offered up an opinion on it, quite by feel rather than
&gt; fact or intelligence. This characteristic reveals you to be aggressively
&gt; stupid.

&gt;&gt; Again, the Aryan race never existed.

&gt; Do you enjoy saying this?  I find that when simple people learn something
&gt; new they like to tell it to as many people as possible, like they're
&gt; teaching it to others.  So far my unofficial count has you reminding this
&gt; NG at least a half dozen times that the Aryan race never existed.  You
&gt; can't honestly believe that this one tidbit is going to convince folks
&gt; that you are anything more than we already know you to be.

&gt;&gt; As for the chicken deal, you didn't answer my question.
&gt;&gt; Do you prefer to be raised as a fighting rooster or a KFC chicken?
&gt;&gt; iy

&gt; You can't sugar coat the fact that you raise roosters in order to make
&gt; them kill each other for your pleasure.  You torment them to make them
&gt; aggressive.  You give them drugs such as strychnine, caffeine,
&gt; amphetamines and epinephrine in order to make them more aggressive,
&gt; increase their endurance and clot the blood that's sure to flow when you
&gt; put them in a fight.

&gt; You saw off their natural spurs and replace them with razor sharp &quot;gaffs.&quot;
&gt; Once the birds have been pitted against each other, they peck and maim
&gt; each other with their beaks and gaffs.  Sometimes the gaffs, which may be
&gt; up to 3 inches long, get stuck deep into one of the birds so they have to
&gt; be physically separated so the fight can continue.  The fight ends when
&gt; one of the birds is either killed or becomes too weak to fight.  The loser
&gt; gets tossed on the garbage heap, the winner will likely die from his
&gt; injuries and winds up suffering the same fate as the losing bird.

&gt; That's some superior option you've presented, dill hole.  On the one hand,
&gt; animals are raised for human consumption.  That's
&gt; animal husbandry.  On the other hand, animals are raised and trained to
&gt; rip each other apart for the pleasure of sadistic pricks with money to
&gt; wager. That's cruelty.  And it's also indicative of a lesser evolved life
&gt; form. But we already knew this about you, Iggy.

&gt; The difference between you and Michael Vick is that at least Vick has the
&gt; decency to lie about his blood lust.  You're proud of it even though it's
&gt; something that should make you feel shame.  You're too stupid to feel
&gt; shame. That pretty much makes you an animal.

You are such a psycho.

Are you saying that the women who prostitute themselves are chickens?
Is that why they called it the Chicken Ranch??

If beating your children were legal in three states and Puerto Rico
would that mean it was okay?

Common sense may dictate that, but common sense is often wrong in scientific

The demographic pressure existed in the form of food supply.  200K years

sources.

They were in equilibrium with nature, a Real Paradise

Equilibrium yes, meaning very few humans and a high death rate...and it was

After the development

Wrong.  Agriculture came into existance AFTER the migration out of Africa,
