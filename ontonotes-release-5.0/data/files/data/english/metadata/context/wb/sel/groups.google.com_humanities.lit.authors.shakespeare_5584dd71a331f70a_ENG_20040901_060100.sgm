I would like to add Chaucer, Spenser, Blake, Coleridge, and Byron into
the Brits lineup. The Americans Poe, Whitman, Frost, Wallace Stevens,
and Amy Dickenson are at least equal to Shelly, Hardy, Auden, and
Marvell, who are probably 2nd raters, IMO.

The women's vote would likely prefer Elizabeth Barret Browning and Amy
Dickenson to many of the above.

Spenser is arguably a better poet than Shakespeare, literati say.

Why the assumption that [only] girls like reading [only] girls? Regarding
the Americans, I don't know that I like your list. I'd keep Whitman, but as
for the rest: Bradstreet, Eliot, cummings, Millay, Plath and William Carlos
Williams are to my taste. Don't ask how I can like both cummings _and_
Millay, I just do. Who can help but love

since feeling is first
who pays any attention
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;

wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world

my blood approves,
and kisses are a better fate
than wisdom
lady I swear by all flowers. Don't cry
--the best gesture of my brain is less than
your eyelids' flutter which says

we are for each other:then
laugh,leaning back in my arms
for life's not a paragraph

And death i think is no parenthesis

It's so simple, so moving. There's so much quiet, confident daring in it.
And the paradox, that &quot;kisses are a better fate than wisdom&quot; and thus the
foolishness of this uncareful love is the wiser course - it's charming. Or
how about:

somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond
any experience,your eyes have their silence
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
or which i cannot touch because they are too near

your slightest look easily will enclose me
though i have closed myself as fingers,
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose

or if your wish be to close me,i and
my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly,
as when the heart of this flower imagines
the snow carefully everywhere descending;

nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
the power of your intense fragility:whose texture
compels me with the colour of its countries,
rendering death and forever with each breathing

(i do not know what it is about you that closes
and opens;only something in me understands
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands

I'd rather read cummings than Spenser any day. - htd

Spenser is great for archetectonics, or structure, with all that
allegory and weaving of themes, and so some others are Greatest on a
different standard, such as lyric, dramatic, narrative. I note that
Spenser is one of the few classes offered on a single poet in college.
Even Shakespeare is offered only as a playwright, I assume.

Well, if we're talking about poets you esteem and relish, I can add
the Americans Emerson, Longfellow, and Amy Lowell. Looking at
Untermeyer's Modern Poetry, I see American women are especially well
represented. Haven't figured out if T.S. Eliot, Auden, and Pound are
American. A. E. Housman is a favorite of mine, also Hopkins.

I completely disagree here. The language in P.L., at least, is lovely;
it takes (me) forever to read, but the end-effect is like that of eating
incredibly rich chocolate or something, a wonderful afterglow.

Not to your taste I guess.

BTW, one thing I wondered about:

The version of P.L. I read (penguin paperback) had occasional variant
spellings for some pronouns where the final &quot;e&quot; would be extended, like
&quot;he&quot; -&gt;&quot;hee&quot; (I think that's one anyway, I don't have the book here); I
gather this had some sort of grammatical meaning in Milton's time. I
ended up loving these just for the way they sounded in my mind when I
came across them, but I noticed that other versions of P.L. have
eliminated them -- what's up with that? They're used fairly sparsely,
so I can't believe they're hard for people to understand, and I think
they add a nice taste, an occasional treat for the tongue. Why did the
editors of other editions have to go and remove them?!?

&gt;&gt;Utterly unwieldy and unreadable. Recounting biblical myths is so
&gt;&gt;banal.

&gt; Suzanne, you nay-saying wench - show us how it's done.

&gt; Lorenzo
&gt;&quot;Mark the music.&quot;

Yeah, Pound put down Milton but he wrote &quot;Mauberly.&quot;

Poetry defies lists. Sitting here avoiding the night's parade of liars
and criminals at the RNC, my favorite list would include

Percy Bysshe Shelley
Carl Rakosi
Jon Silkin
John Kinsella
Siegfried Sassoon (wouldn't you love to hear the ads from the &quot;Somme
Trench Veterans for Truth&quot; about his MC?)
Robert Lowell
&amp;c.

But tomorrow there would be another list.

Spenser is indisputably great.

Though it may be too soon to tell, since genius is only seen
retrospectively in the context of history, I nominate
Lawrence Ferlinghetti. An example:

CONSTANTLY RISKING ABSURDITY
by Lawrence Ferlinghetti

Constantly risking absurdity
and death
whenever he performs
above the heads
of his audience
the poet like an acrobat
climbs on rime
to a high wire of his own making
and balancing on eyebeams
above a sea of faces
paces his way
to the other side of the day
performing entrachats
and sleight-of-foot tricks
and other high theatrics
and all without mistaking
any thing
for what it may not be
For he's the super realist
who must perforce perceive
taut truth
before the taking of each stance or step
in his supposed advance
toward that still higher perch
where Beauty stands and waits
with gravity
to start her death-defying leap
And he
a little charleychaplin man
who may or may not catch
her fair eternal form
spreadeagled in the empty air
of existence

Beckett never really became French despite learning the
language so well. Several of his friends have testified
to this fact. Culturally and psychologically he remained
totally Irish and Anglophone.

Of course, the things Beckett wrote in French are a part
of French literature, just as _Le Testament français_ by
Andreï Makine is a work of French literature, although the
author is Russian. In fact, Makine famously had some problems
at first convincing his publisher that a Russian could write
French so perfectly. Now, of course, he is well-known partly
due to just that fact.

Not according to Shelley, who rated him above all &quot;modern&quot; poets except

Helen Darbishire's preface (Oxford Standard Authors) goes
into Milton's spelling and punctuation, especially in
Paradise Lost where he seems to have had full control. Her
argument reads as if she was bringing to light something
that had not been appreciated before. On your point she
says:

&quot;3. Distinguish the unemphatic from the emphatic
pronunciations of personal pronouns, - we, me, ye; wee, yee;
thir, their. Note the erratum for P.L. II. 414: 'For we read
wee.'
Here he had need
All circumspection, and wee now no less&quot;

She points out:
&quot;A modernized version may lead to a wrong metrical reading.
Thus the eleventh line of Comus in Masson's edition runs:
Amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats

which we must read:

Amongst th'enthronèd gods on sainted seats.

But Milton makes his own reading perfectly clear:

Amongst the enthron'd gods on sainted seats.

'The' is not elided: both syllables of 'enthron'd' receive
some stress. Milton had his own chosen spellings to indicate
the way he liked certain words to be pronounced, for
example: goverment, anow, or anough (for enough), childern,
hunderd, perfet, highth: and he liked Italian spellings:
sovran (for sovereign), ammiral, rime (for rhyme).&quot;

(I am reminded, a little off topic, that L.R. Palmer the
philologist made a practice of saying 'highth' to give a
helping hand to an interesting philological development.)

It's difficult (or rather, impossible) to judge poetry in translation;

I would contend, though, that Quevedo, Gongora, Garcilaso, Celaya,
Machado, and Lorca are up there with the best, and are not on your

Some of those spellings represent dialect. But I imagine Milton may
well have been aware that &quot;rime&quot; is actually the more correct spelling.

There is the popular notion about Americans
moving to England and eventually becoming
&quot;more English than the English&quot; and T. S.
Eliot is often referred to as an example
of that.

&gt;&gt;No impact on the world outside India. No language magic.

&gt; India has what percentage of the world's population? And certainly in

&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;8. Calderon de la Barca (e.g. Life is a Dream)

&gt;&gt;Little impact on non-Spanish cultures. Very little language magic.

&gt; Not according to Shelley, who rated him above all &quot;modern&quot; poets except
&gt; Shakespeare, whom he said wrote with similar grace of style and
&gt; subtlety. But even so, Spanish language culture spread widely around
&gt; the world and dominates a full continent.

Though they like to think so, California is hardly a full continent.
(Psst. Take a portugander at the map of S.A. See all the little
portugoslings in a third of it? And the languages outside the
cities are mainly various &quot;Indio.&quot;)

I'd think Cervantes had more &quot;impact&quot; on world /Kulchur/ however
most of that readership don't read him in their native tongues. The

Yes, I may be prejudiced in doubting that Garcilaso or Celaya (whoever

who thought that Spanish wasn't suitable for writing great poetry:

&quot;Oui, la langue espagnole est tres lourde. Si vous dites 'tristement',
'gaiment', vous en avez le triste et le gai, ou en anglais si vous
dites 'slowly', 'quickly', vous entendez slow et quick ; mais si en
espagnol vous dites 'lentamente', 'rapidemente', vous n'entendez plus
que &quot;mente&quot;, qui est la partie mecanique du mot.&quot;

And to quote from his ENglish interview:

&quot;I do think that Spanish literature began by being very fine. And then
somewhere, and already with such writers as Quevado and Gongora, you
feel something has stiffened; the language doesn't flow as it did...

I'm not fond of Lorca. Well you see, this is a shortcoming of mine, I
dislike visual poetry. He is visual all the time, and he goes in for
fancy metaphors. But, of course, I know he's very respected. I knew
him personally. He lived a year in New York. He didn't learn a word of
English after a year in New York.. Very strange. I met him only once
in Buenes Aires. And then, it was a lucky think for him to be
executed. Best thing to happen for a poet. A fine death, no? An

Borges was a mischievious genius. He did wonders with the Spanish
language, yet he delighted in bashing it (sometimes). I tend to think
that he was being provocative; many people got rather angry with him
and I think he quite enjoyed that.

My opinion is very likely to be biased but I think Spanish poetry is
hard to match in sonority and forcefulness. Only Italian and sometimes
French are in the same league. I think that when the rhyme and the
rhythm are in the hands of a gifted poet Spanish poetry reaches an
unsurpassed power and musicality; I think that Spanish poetry is able
to be compelling while at the same time rich and subtle in a way in
which others can't. What Borges categorized in your quote above as
&quot;lourde&quot;, with a pejorative connotation, is indeed the wonderful
weight, the gravitas, which is the main beauty of the Spanish
language.

Listen for example to these verses by Quevedo:

Lloraron sus envidias una a una
con las propias naciones las extrañas;
su tumba son de Flandes las campañas
y su epitafio la sangrienta luna.

(By the way Borges opined that this latter line is the most beautiful
in the Spanish language).

Or these ones:

Alma a quien todo un dios prisión ha sido,
venas que humor a tanto fuego han dado,
médulas que han gloriosamente ardido
su cuerpo dejará, no su cuidado;
serán ceniza, más tendrá sentido;
polvo serán, mas polvo enamorado.

Or this sublime stanza by Fray Luis de Leon:

El aire se serena
y viste de hermosura y luz no usada,
Salinas, cuando suena
la música extremada
por vuestra sabia mano gobernada.

I can appreciate Baudelaire. I fail to be captivated by Auden at all.
With very few exceptions I fail to find English poetry engaging; the
music is either too light or almost absent.

There are a few English poems I can relate to, though. Theodore
Roethke comes to mind, perhaps.

Milan

But then there were prose-writers who could put many so-called poets
to shame. Three random quotes, from different periods and languages:

&quot;Tandis que le courant du milieu entraine vers le mer les cadavres des
pins et des chenes, on voit sur les deux courants lateraux remonter le
long des rivages, des iles flottantes de pistia et de nenuphar, dont
les roses jaunes s'elevent comme de petits pavillons&quot; (Chateaubriand,
1801).

&quot;Yadovityi oktyabr' obduval zolotoi lesnoi shopot, i pokorno lozhilsya
na zemlyu zolotoi lesnoi shopot, - i pokorno lozhilsya na zemlyu
shelestyaschiy osinnyi bagrets, shtoby vit'sa i gret'sa u nog
prokhozhego peshekhoda, i shushukat', spletaya iz listiev
zholto-krasnye rossypi slov&quot; (Bely, 1912).

&quot;Well might it seem that such a city had owed her existence rather to
the rod of the enchanter, than the fear of the fugitive; that the
waters which encircled her bad been chosen for the mirror of her
state, rather than the shelter of her nakedness; and that all which in
nature was wild or merciless, Time and Decay, as well as the waves and
tempests, - had been won to adorn her instead of to destroy, and might
still spare, for ages to come, that beauty which seemed to have fixed
for its throne the sands of the hour-glass as well as of the sea&quot;
(Ruskin, 1848).

Cheers!

&gt;&gt; Do you really think anything written by Lorca may best &quot;Miss Gee&quot;?

&gt;&gt; Best wishes from Prague

&gt; Borges was a mischievious genius. He did wonders with the Spanish
&gt; language, yet he delighted in bashing it (sometimes). I tend to think
&gt; that he was being provocative; many people got rather angry with him
&gt; and I think he quite enjoyed that.

&gt; My opinion is very likely to be biased but I think Spanish poetry is
&gt; hard to match in sonority and forcefulness. Only Italian and sometimes
&gt; French are in the same league. I think that when the rhyme and the
&gt; rhythm are in the hands of a gifted poet Spanish poetry reaches an
&gt; unsurpassed power and musicality; I think that Spanish poetry is able
&gt; to be compelling while at the same time rich and subtle in a way in
&gt; which others can't. What Borges categorized in your quote above as
&gt;&quot;lourde&quot;, with a pejorative connotation, is indeed the wonderful
&gt; weight, the gravitas, which is the main beauty of the Spanish
&gt; language.

&gt; Listen for example to these verses by Quevedo:

&gt; Lloraron sus envidias una a una
&gt; con las propias naciones las extrañas;
&gt; su tumba son de Flandes las campañas
&gt; y su epitafio la sangrienta luna.

&gt; (By the way Borges opined that this latter line is the most beautiful
&gt; in the Spanish language).

&gt; Or these ones:

&gt; Alma a quien todo un dios prisión ha sido,
&gt; venas que humor a tanto fuego han dado,
&gt; médulas que han gloriosamente ardido
&gt; su cuerpo dejará, no su cuidado;
&gt; serán ceniza, más tendrá sentido;
&gt; polvo serán, mas polvo enamorado.

&gt; Or this sublime stanza by Fray Luis de Leon:

&gt; El aire se serena
&gt; y viste de hermosura y luz no usada,
&gt; Salinas, cuando suena
&gt; la música extremada
&gt; por vuestra sabia mano gobernada.

&gt; I can appreciate Baudelaire. I fail to be captivated by Auden at all.
&gt; With very few exceptions I fail to find English poetry engaging; the
&gt; music is either too light or almost absent.

"/>

Primarily a modern failing, not an English one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; There are a few English poems I can relate to, though. Theodore
&gt; Roethke comes to mind, perhaps.

Because he so often has the sense of fighting alone (against the
above failing), he so often fails to achieve universe. Snodgrass
had the same problem a generation worse.

A shame, since /all/ languages have sounds that match and sounds
that don't.
But ears are found only on individual poets, and the sounds bong
around only inside /their/ heads until they pick up a pencil and
mark out the music.
The same happens to composers, who all speak the /same/ language.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The women's vote would likely prefer Elizabeth Barret Browning and Amy

Indeed. Your etymology is completely wrong.

&quot;Fuck&quot; comes from Futuo, -ere, which you will find in one or
more poems by Catullus.

&quot;Fake&quot; has obscure origins [Am. Herit. Dict.], though, as
its earlier forms were &quot;feague&quot; and &quot;feake&quot;, it may come
from old German &quot;fegen&quot;. No Latin root.

There is no Latin &quot;ficos&quot;.

There is in Latin &quot;Fictus&quot; - invented, supposed, feigned -
but that is the past part. form of the verb &quot;Fingo&quot;.

While the Latin &quot;Maleficium&quot; and &quot;Maleficus&quot; exist, they
derive from &quot;Male-facio&quot; - to do bad, to harm - and have
nothing to do with the verb &quot;Fingo&quot;.

This has got to rank as one of the best pieces of trollwork of all

Qua question, it is dumb. We don't even have a list of poets. E.g. was
the author the Qur'an, generally held to be Allah himself, a poet? The
Quran rhymes and, in several places, even has a refrain.

Suppose we do get agreement on that. Now how can we possibly measure
poets except with in their own language? And if we restrained

Beowulf to Emily Dickinson?

I understand the poetry community and academics are angry that Eliot
took modern poetry on a &quot;wasteland&quot; course, instead of modern poetry
affirming 20th Century achievements, as Hart Crane and others does.

I think it's true that we now have very few poets or poems, and I
still like T. S. Eliot.

If anybody &quot;took&quot; poultry on a wasteland course, it was the poultry

The &quot;what have I done O My People&quot; of the &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot;

Whatever faults they find with the traditional, Eliot's critical

A giant with feet of clay. Nabokov thought Dante and Eliot were the
most ridiculously overestimated poets in history. A good company for
TSE.

The true giants were Yeats, Hardy, Frost. Eliot and Auden are
teenagers compared to them. Pound is just a very little boy.

I read that in &quot;Tradition and the Individual Talent&quot; Eliot talks about
a required &quot;historical sense,&quot; but critics notice he seems to consider
all literature as simultaneous.

(quote)
2) . . . . [T]he historical sense involves a perception, not only of
the pastness of the past, but of its presence; the historical sense
compels man to write not merely with his own generation in his bones,
but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from
Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has
a simultaneous order. This historical sense, which is a sense of the
timeless as well as the temporal and of the timeless and of the
temporal together, is what makes a writer traditional.
(unquote)

But I notice that he is assuming a poet having this historical sense
probably requires more than perception, but also wide learning about
literature, as he had. I appreciate The Wasteland for its literary
alusions, including Shakespeare, but wonder about including footnotes
to explain it, as he did.

If Crane was so enamoured of the 20th Century,he wouldn't have gone

One name which comes to mind from the point of view of influence is
Edward Lear. Yes, I mean this in all seriousness.

The Limerick may well be regarded as the lowest possible form of
poetry (the advertising strapline is surely in close competition,
though.)

Edward Lear's nonsence verse did not have the form that we know today
because he used to repeat the first line at the end instead of using
the last line as a bawdy punchline. All his nonsence verse was also
&quot;clean&quot; - he was writing for children afterall. Lear nevertheless
introduced a new form which, when the modern convention took hold, is
probably the most popular poetical form today.

Edward Lear was born in Highgate, London. Contrary to popular belief,
he was definitely not born in Limerick or Nantucket.

But Eliot's notes are separate from the poem. They elucidate it
without being part of it, and were added after publication because
they were asked for.

Would you have the same objection to Pope's notes to the Dunciad or

And Spenser's Faerie Queene, with five levels of allegory in an epic

that, rereading several times before coming to a satisfactory
understanding about what's going on. Having the author's footnotes to
study seems questionable, if only because it's another assignment to
cover before taking the final quiz.

If having academic commentary could be part of a literary genre as a
narrative or dramatic device should be worked out, my guess is that it
would be done in the English novel, maybe?

"/>

In one sense (a sense he means at least on occasion), it is
obviously so: all the books sit on the shelf at the same time, and
affect the reader in the present.
But Eliot had a rather better sense than most that poets come and
go while Earth abides, and so do rules of languages, of turning
Earth into Air. And that while fads also come and go, a poet is
pretty much the same in any age, and so are his pains and joys.
This last is primarily what distinguishes Yeats, e.g. (somebody
mentioned), so far above the run: his pains are timeless, &quot;merely&quot;
the same ones everybody else has had, without his words' having to
lean all over themselves to assert them so. It also kept him
deceptively simple: where the vision is accurate, the words don't
have to contrive it:
&quot;She stands before me as a living child...&quot;
&quot;When you are old and grey and full of sleep...&quot;
&quot;That is no country for old men...&quot;
Auden, e.g., by contrast, so often remarks the same truth /as an
outsider/, analysing, reporting, but not experiencing it:
&quot;How well they knew suffering, the old masters...&quot;

He says this elsewhere in so many words. I'll add to him and you:
truth is timeless, but the language that describes it is cumulative

"/>

I consider &quot;The Waste Land&quot; to be in part a failed experiment, the
technique itself a standard but easily overused in a small space.
It's one thing for a poet to be well-read, but allusion also
requires that the /reader/ be well-read, and that can hardly be
counted on. TWL doesn't fail because it uses allusions, but rather
because it uses too many from too wide a range, and without gluing
them together with that &quot;timeless&quot; /present/ world available to any
reader.
I wrote a longish piece in two sits at the screen, 21 hours during
which I cracked myself up making puns and allusions in &quot;only&quot; three
fields, my earliest experiments composing on the
&quot;perfectly-eraseable page&quot; of the computer, only the final version
printed. By the time I had answered the questions of only a few
friends who &quot;felt they should remember that,&quot; the footnotes were
longer than the pome.
&quot;Dry Salvages,&quot;
&quot;Notes to /En Apxh/,&quot; same book, may be opened in a second browser
window if you want to fondle all the chaff by line number. I
haven't done that sort of thing again (however there are single
notes to a few of my pomes), since the experiment failed me for the
same reasons it failed him.

In one sense, immediately so; voice is part of a poem, and
interrupting it with footnotes is a destruction of the intended art
not associated with prose.
But as with a piano piece, one can absorb the note, back up and

It's a fairly common device in sci-fi, whether the notes are to real
science or to a &quot;history&quot; constructed as part of the fictional
milieu.
Usually works well, and without dumping the reader out of the
story.

| &gt; | &gt;
| &gt; | &gt; I understand the poetry community and academics are angry that
| &gt; Eliot
| &gt; | &gt; took modern poetry on a &quot;wasteland&quot; course, instead of modern
| &gt; poetry
| &gt; | &gt; affirming 20th Century achievements, as Hart Crane and others
| &gt; does.
| &gt; | &gt;
| &gt; | &gt; I think it's true that we now have very few poets or poems,
and I
| &gt; | &gt; still like T. S. Eliot.
| &gt; | &gt;
| &gt; | &gt; bookburn
| &gt; |
| &gt; | If anybody &quot;took&quot; poultry on a wasteland course, it was the
poultry
| &gt; | and academic communities.
| &gt; | The &quot;what have I done O My People&quot; of the &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot;
| &gt; | indicates that while staying with the main, as do the Quartets.
| &gt; | Whatever faults they find with the traditional, Eliot's
critical
| &gt; | essays are very against the modern course.
| &gt;
| &gt; I read that in &quot;Tradition and the Individual Talent&quot; Eliot talks
about
| &gt; a required &quot;historical sense,&quot; but critics notice he seems to
consider
| &gt; all literature as simultaneous.
|
| In one sense (a sense he means at least on occasion), it is
| obviously so: all the books sit on the shelf at the same time, and
| affect the reader in the present.
| But Eliot had a rather better sense than most that poets come and
| go while Earth abides, and so do rules of languages, of turning
| Earth into Air. And that while fads also come and go, a poet is
| pretty much the same in any age, and so are his pains and joys.
| This last is primarily what distinguishes Yeats, e.g. (somebody
| mentioned), so far above the run: his pains are timeless, &quot;merely&quot;
| the same ones everybody else has had, without his words' having to
| lean all over themselves to assert them so. It also kept him
| deceptively simple: where the vision is accurate, the words don't
| have to contrive it:
| &quot;She stands before me as a living child...&quot;
| &quot;When you are old and grey and full of sleep...&quot;

In Innesfree, Yeats mystifies the reader when he refers to things like
the &quot;nine bean rows&quot; unless the reader recognizes the nine bean rows
from
Thoreau, I assume. But Yeats is a real poet, truly original; yet he
gets off the track going into strange folklore, witches, psychic
stuff, etc..

| &quot;That is no country for old men...&quot;
| Auden, e.g., by contrast, so often remarks the same truth /as an
| outsider/, analysing, reporting, but not experiencing it:
| &quot;How well they knew suffering, the old masters...&quot;

The fall of Icarus because he flew too close to the sun and he fell
into the Aegean and drowned? I give Auden high marks for updating a
classical metaphor like that. If you think he is not experiencing
angst/suffering, then perhaps his mere &quot;reporting&quot; it squares with the
problem addressed, because in the painting you see the Fall, while the
ignorant farmer ritually plowing at night fails to notice, as modern
man fails to register it.

| &gt; (quote)
| &gt; 2) . . . . [T]he historical sense involves a perception, not only
of
| &gt; the pastness of the past, but of its presence; the historical
sense
| &gt; compels man to write not merely with his own generation in his
bones,
| &gt; but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from
| &gt; Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country
has
| &gt; a simultaneous order. This historical sense, which is a sense of
the
| &gt; timeless as well as the temporal and of the timeless and of the
| &gt; temporal together, is what makes a writer traditional.
| &gt; (unquote)
| &gt;
| &gt; But I notice that he is assuming a poet having this historical
sense
| &gt; probably requires more than perception, but also wide learning
about
|
| He says this elsewhere in so many words. I'll add to him and you:
| truth is timeless, but the language that describes it is cumulative
| in literature and in the individual. So you either read what's been
| said well, or your own work must reinvent the wheel.

Well, I like to think creativity is not just about being
sequential/non-repetitive/cumulative. I would be afraid of the
accumulated weight on the poet stiffling sponteneity or something.
Aren't poets supposed to be inspired, be on good terms with a muse or
something? But I do think imitating another poet is a form of
flattery and learning a craft.

| &gt; literature, as he had. I appreciate The Wasteland for its
literary
| &gt; alusions, including Shakespeare, but wonder about including
footnotes
| &gt; to explain it, as he did.
|
| I consider &quot;The Waste Land&quot; to be in part a failed experiment, the
| technique itself a standard but easily overused in a small space.
| It's one thing for a poet to be well-read, but allusion also
| requires that the /reader/ be well-read, and that can hardly be

| because it uses too many from too wide a range, and without gluing
| them together with that &quot;timeless&quot; /present/ world available to any
| reader.

I can understand that.

| I wrote a longish piece in two sits at the screen, 21 hours during
| which I cracked myself up making puns and allusions in &quot;only&quot; three
| fields, my earliest experiments composing on the
| &quot;perfectly-eraseable page&quot; of the computer, only the final version

| longer than the pome.
| &quot;Dry Salvages,&quot;
| &quot;Notes to /En Apxh/,&quot; same book, may be opened in a second browser

| haven't done that sort of thing again (however there are single
| notes to a few of my pomes), since the experiment failed me for the
| same reasons it failed him.

Well, you know, authors are famous for saying things about their own
poetry that critics and other readers thing are mistaken--sometimes
that the poet isn't aware of the significance of what s/he sets in
print.

&gt;&gt; I have to wonder about his idea of poetry, then, since poetry is

&gt; But Eliot's notes are separate from the poem. They elucidate it
&gt; without being part of it, and were added after publication because
&gt; they were asked for.

&gt; Would you have the same objection to Pope's notes to the Dunciad or
&gt; Empson's to the Collected Poems? What about Coleridge's running

&gt; appear in the first edition?

"/>

It's hardly fair to compare Eliot's belated comments to TWL and Pope's
admirable notes to the Dunciad. Eliot's comments represent a wasted
attempt to secure the poem from oblivion, while Pope's notes are
inseparable from the poem's design.

On the other hand, I can't understand Eliot's poem without his
commentary, but I enjoy reading the Dunciad without consulting Pope's
notes.

As artistic as Pushkin's notes to Eugene Onegin, or Nabokov's
commentary to the same novel, Pope's notes to Dunciad were precursors
of the structure Nabokov used in his Pale Fire. There are numerous
allusions to the Dunciad throughout Nabokov's novel.

That's interesting. It would throw an extra light on the question to know
how continental Europeans view the English corpus, and in what order they
would put its treasured poets. Have you got any more quotes like that?

In the English-speaking world there was a reaction against Milton in the
early 20th century, led by F.R. Leavis, which led to a diminishment of his
reputation. Although Leavis is now himself the subject of attacks, Milton's
reputation has never reclaimed its former heights. But it would be
interesting to know whether continental opinion has followed the same
pattern, or whether Milton was ever held in high regard.

Do either influence or originality affect the permanent value of a

And what about poets whose influence has been great but mostly bad?
Milton is the usual example, but Hopkins and Dylan Thomas have also

Its being his ongoing notebook(s) makes more sense to the scope of

&gt;&gt;&gt; And Spenser's Faerie Queene, with five levels of allegory in an epic
&gt;&gt;&gt; quest narrative. Great poets, yes, but we have to study poems like

&gt;&gt; I wonder why Spenser, Milton, Pound are among the least regarded of
&gt;&gt; all-time English greats in the non-English-speaking literary world.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps their long poems are not as great as they once seemed to be?

&gt;&gt; Flaubert once remarked about Dante or Milton: &quot;Let the shade of
&gt;&gt; oblivion fall on the poems so detached from the present that they
&gt;&gt; don't let you near&quot;.

&gt; That's interesting. It would throw an extra light on the question to know
&gt; how continental Europeans view the English corpus, and in what order they
&gt; would put its treasured poets. Have you got any more quotes like that?

&gt; In the English-speaking world there was a reaction against Milton in the
&gt; early 20th century, led by F.R. Leavis, which led to a diminishment of his
&gt; reputation. Although Leavis is now himself the subject of attacks, Milton's
&gt; reputation has never reclaimed its former heights. But it would be
&gt; interesting to know whether continental opinion has followed the same
&gt; pattern, or whether Milton was ever held in high regard.

&gt; Buffalo

Actually the revolt against Milton was begun by T.S. Eliot and
taken up by such diverse figures as Robert Graves and Yvor Winters(&quot;It
does not require a suspension of belief to read Milton but a
suspension of the intelligence.&quot; in The Function of Criticism).
Eliot revised himself after carefully considering a revisionist
essay with which Charles Williams prefixed to his own selections from
Milton. I have never heard that in my generation there was much
problem with Milton's reputation
in academic literary circles.
I admit to having quite a personal distaste for Milton in my teens
but that is because I,like most people, was reading the wrong
Milton.People who can't appreciate the Delilah scene in Samson
Agonistes(the few that bother to read it)are simply tone deaf and
their opinions may be set aside.
The main problem ,in my case,was having received a Spenser shortly
after receiving a complete Shakespeare on my eighth birthday.(Life
would still be more bearable if Spenser had possessed Milton's
influence on later generations of writers.)I continue to break in my
young friends on both Shakespeare and Spenser simultaneously.They have
no more trouble with the Fairie Queen than the Lord of the Rings.And
they equally enjoy John Bunyan's
Pilgrim's Progress,a work which deservedly has sold just below the
King James Bible over the centuries.It is said the American pioneer
carried his King James,his Shakespeare, and either his Milton or his
Bunyan into the wilderness with him and was a far more cultured and
better educated man than most would be literateurs these days.
For those suffering from the deficencies of post-PC indoctrination
courses,I could recommend the work of leading Joyce scholar Ernst
Curtius.To tone modernism down to its proper proportion in his blood
Curtius turned towards the study of the Medieval literature and
produced the finest assimilation with the 20th century mentality ever
written. I refer the readers to his Literature and the Latin Middle
Ages.It is probably too late for some of the contributors to this
thread but there is always more joy in heaven over one sinner that
repenteth than a hundred righteous men who need no salvation.And ,for
the rest,
&quot;Scorn the sort now growing up,
All out of shape from toe to top,
Their unremembering hearts and heads

The socalled Metaphysicals never figured out the exact mechanism
Donne used in skipping from tenors to vehicles /of similes/ and
back, and neither apparently did Eliot. The Metaphysicals quickly
degenerated into a diaphor not attempted again until the Surrealists
encrapulated themselves in whatever happened along, while the
sloppier Romantics used secondhand symbols as similes and the

It's more than that. /The Hobbit/ and /The Lord of the Rings/ are
outright sequels to /The Silmarillion/. It just happens to be the case
that they were published first. The situation is, perhaps, somewhat
confused by the fact that, for the most part, /The Silmarillion/ is
written in the cool, distanced, summary style of the Icelandic prose
sagas, while /The Hobbit/ and /The Lord of the Rings/ are constructed as
modern novels. Tolkien's original intention in writing /The
Silmarillion/ was to supply England with a mythology, for England knows
Woden only through the media of Odin and Wotan, and Arthur is Welsh in
origin and French in evolution.

It isn't Eliot who let down the side there, Fido: it's Weber with (to steal
from John Cleese) his roll call redux of Puccini's Greatest Hits. Such is
the divined opinion of my own sweet Jennyanydots, who never tires of showing
her approbation of a book by falling asleep across its pages and drooling
copiously. Our copy (she is kind enough to share it with me, the printing
of her Blessed Name within its pages being accepted by us both as
irrefutable proof of her own, kind ownership) of Old Possum has on
numberless occasions been literally drenched with the praise of this
gorgeous Gumbie cat.

It's fun poetry, but a ghastly play. The interesting stuff rarely gets done
on Broadway anyway - how could it, with the seats at a Broadway show being
so expensive? When you pay $300 per to spend three hours staring you are
guaranteed to get two things in quantity, because only two things guarantee

Has any Cage aficionado in the classical music group ever heard of this

There's a similar one, entitled 4'33&quot; (because that's how long the first
performance lasted), but it's not scored for any particular performer or
performers. (That first performance was by the pianist David Tudor.)

The point is to call attention to ambient sound, which Cage believed

That a poet steep himself in his age and the literature is the same

So is that he must do so.
So are the pains and the pencils.
The age in which a poet steeps himself will /always/ produce a few
things unique to that age, i.e., that could only have been produced
in that age.
I fail to see the contradiction.
Nor, I think, does Eliot, as he dwells far more in both essays and
poems on that which does /not/ change, and on the sense that it does
not.
(His essays on individual poets and/or their ages hold them to
their ages, but our theories of contention are primarily out of /The
Sacred Wood/, which is general. And fairly ageless.)

&gt;There's a similar one, entitled 4'33&quot; (because that's how long the first

&gt;performers. (That first performance was by the pianist David Tudor.)

&gt;The point is to call attention to ambient sound, which Cage believed

The &quot;Of silence&quot; is not a part of its title, and the instructions
say that the title should be the duration that the player(s) choose(s)
for it. So yes, it can be 15 minutes.

One version of the score has three movements, all simply marked &quot;tacet&quot;.

You're welcome to think so, if you like; but Eliot's essay

only in their own time and that English poetry before and since
the 17th century is divided by what he refers to as a

Eliot never labeled The Wasteland a failure, far as I know.
Maybe he did. I'd be very interested if he said anything
along those lines. But all I've seen is his remark that he had
moved on by the time it was printed.

Of course you can dislike it without his approval. And on
the turnaround, it could still be a masterpiece even if he
wished that he'd burned it in the grate and scattered its black

Thanks for the reminder - I had completely forgotten about &quot;Tristram
Shandy&quot;. Actually I never read its blank pages, but, indeed, the
marmored pages caught my eye. He must have been quite something of a
pioneer. In fact, he was I believe the first author ever to have some
of his works published meticulously as they were written - no editor
had the chance of making any adjustments. Perhaps many poets (authors)
before him had written blank pages as well.

But the thing about John Cage's composition is that it is a total
blank - from the start all the way to the finish. It doesn't contain
one single note. I always felt this as a compelling message pointing
out how definitely more enjoyable silence is to modern music.

&gt;&gt; It has been said, that the best composition of John Cage is his
&gt;&gt;&quot;Fifteen Minutes of Silence&quot;, in which an orchestra is used to play
&gt;&gt; nothing for exactly 15 minutes. Unfortunately, there is no equivalent
&gt;&gt; in modern poetry.

&gt;&gt; Wasn't he inspired by Malevich's &quot;White on White&quot; :)

&gt;&gt; There are many allusions to that painting in Brodsky's work. In one of
&gt;&gt; his poems Brodsky described himself sitting on a white bench with a
&gt;&gt; white suit on: belyi na belom, kak mechta Kazimira (&quot;white on white,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, there is no equivalent in modern poetry.

&gt;&gt; I don't know about modern poetry, but Pushkin intentionally left blank
&gt;&gt; spaces between stanzas of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; to indicate the passage of
&gt;&gt; time.

&gt; Joe Green has used white space to great

Oh frabjous joy! Kepler's in Menlo will have it, and,
I believe, that Printers Inc on Castro in Mountain View.
Maybe also Books, Inc in the Stanford Shopping Center.

All providing good browsing fodder.

Getting back to the Subject; I watched Pane e Tulipani
again tonight. Perhaps the greatest color of any movie made.
But also continuous reference and quotation to one really,
really of the greatest poets of All Time: Ludwige Ariosto
and particularly for his Orlando Furioso which far too few
of you lot have ever read. More's the pity.

Also learning Tennesseean by way of James' &quot;Old Friends&quot; :

&quot;She seemed to be there when I needed her most
But needing her now would be like needing a ghost.&quot;

IIRC Nabokov placed Ariosto above Tasso and way above Dante, among Italian poets.

Amazon has a paperback edition, Italian and English, for $40.
And an Adobe Reader digi-download for $14.

&quot;Boiardo's long poetic account of the chivalric and magical
adventures of the knight Orlando (Roland) stands at a crucial
juncture between the chansons de geste and medieval Romance
and the great Renaissance epics such as Ariosto's Orlando
Furioso and Spenser's Faerie Queene. The publisher has done
a service to both the scholar and the serious reader, providing
a handsome bilingual edition of the Orlando Innamorato that
features the first complete translation in English. While not
always literal, translator Ross's efforts are vigorous,
capturing much of the spirit of the original. He also includes
a cogent introductory essay on Boiardo and his work.&quot;
