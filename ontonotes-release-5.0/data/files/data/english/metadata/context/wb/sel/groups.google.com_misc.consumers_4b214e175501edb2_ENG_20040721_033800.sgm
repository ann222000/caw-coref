I live in Los Angeles. Yesterday, a serviceman from the Southern California
Gas Company appeared unannounced and said that he need to change the meter.
He said that every so often they change meters and mine hadn't been done in
a while. This seemed awfully strange, but he came in a Gas Co. truck and
wore a Gas Co. uniform. I asked for I.D. and he provided it. Although this
made no sense to me, I couldn't figure out a reason *not* to have him
&quot;change the meter&quot; so I said, &quot;Sure, go ahead.&quot;

Five minutes later he came back and said it would take a little longer
because there was a bypass that needed to be fixed. It still didn't occur to
me what was going on. I asked if he could fix it. He said yes. Then he said
that a different gas man needed to come out and check all my gas appliances.
So a half hour later, that is indeed what happened.

Later, after all this was done, and I had half forgotten about it, I decided
to take a look at the &quot;new&quot; gas meter. But it didn't appear to be new at
all. It was kind of weathered. And then it hit me.

I've lived in this house since 1987. But when I bought it, I was told (and
it's part of the contract) that the conversion of the 4-car garage to a
mother-in-law apartment was done without permits. That was and has been
fine. I use it for a home office.

Now I think I know what he meant by &quot;bypass.&quot; It is my guess that people who
did the conversion &quot;bypassed&quot; the gas meter and so I haven't been paying for
gas for the converted part of the house. It is my guess that they had a
second gas man come out to verify what the first man found, and also to
inventory all the gas appliances so that they could figure out what I should
have been paying and send me a bill. This is all a guess, but it would seem
to fit the known facts. Needless to say, I knew nothing about this bypass.

My question is this: Although I don't want to cheat the Gas Co., it would
also be a burden to be hit with the bill for 17 years worth of back charges.
Can they do that? What is my exposure and options?

"/> See what the gas company comes up with as a charge. Then offer them a
fraction of it, such as 10% of it. Dicker back and forth, and settle on
something you see as reasonable.

Its possible they will not want back charges but will want the garage
included on future bills.

If the seller is still available, you may be able to hit them for a
share of the charge.

If you and the gas company can't agree on a reasonable number, you
probably need a lawyer.

"/> Assuming that they can come up with a verifiable amount based on
something more concrete than their &quot;estimate&quot; of usage, you could be
liable for something, but there should be a fixed period of time
beyond which they could not go back. I'm thinking that this would be
the Cal limitations period for contract actions, but could be wrong on
this (assuming your agreement with them doesn't specifiy something).
In the event that they get tough, and I doubt that they will, I'd,
first, dispute the &quot;fairness&quot; of them doing this with them, and, if
absolutely necessary, offer a small percentage of what they ask for,
if it looks reasonable. I'm assuming that there is no issue of
fraudulent behavior on your part with regard to the &quot;bypass.&quot;

A similar situation arose while I was renting a room in a home that had
been recently purchased by a co-worker. When doing some electrical work
we noticed much to our surprise that the power didn't go off in some
areas of the house when the MAIN circuit breaker was shut off.

Being electrical engineers we were alarmed and contacted Edison. They
investigated, and after initially saying there was no problem (and being
shown that power was still available even with the main breaker off),
they eventually discovered that the power meter had been bypassed and
one branch circuit in the house was 'hot wired'. This probably happened
when a room was added on to the house because the power meter was
relocated at that time.

In this situation, Edison went after the recent seller of the house. It
had been much less than a year since the sale. We never heard anything
more about it. Of course, since we were the ones to contact Edison, it
must have been a good bet that we were not the ones who bypassed the
meter in the first place.

I have no idea how your utility is going to estimate the usage over the
last X years. Also, considering how long it has been since you purchased
the home, I wonder how or if a statute of limitations would apply as far
as the utility being able to demand compensation.

Consider however that since you purchased the home, you have been using
gas that you have not been paying for (through no fault of your own of
course.) It is only fair for the utility to hit you up for compensation
assuming they can justify how they computed the unknown usage.

Well, if you are going to get into a dispute with your gas company it is
probably best to do it during the summer, when you are not likely to
need gas to heat your home :)

"/> I'm not sure your interpretation of his comment was correct, but if it is, you
should be talking to your state PUC. Laws vary from state to state in how far
back they can go to recover unbilled utilities. The difference between a broken
meter and intent to defraud can also be a factor.

I know in one state, water customers were being billed based on an incorrect
pipe size for over 10 years leading to substantial overcharges. (It's stupid,
but in this state you are not only billed based on how much water you actually
used, but also based on how much you could use, i.e. supply pipe size.) State
law limited refunds to the previous two years and only to current owners.

(HOPEFULLY they won't try to charge you interest. But since you've

I suggest a pre-emptive strike (in a good way). Call the gas company
and speak to a manager. Explain that you truly did not realize that
gas was bypassing the meter, that you know you owe them for the gas
that you were using off the meter, and that you want to work out an
equitable arrangement. They may or may not settle for a percentage
of the estimated amount due, but at the very least they should let
you pay it off over time. Since this has been going on for 17 years,
I'd think payments over a year or two should not be a problem.

non-standard. Similarly, the contract speaks of the work being not

work looked great and appeared to be perfectly okay.

I cop to having used the gas -- albiet unknowingly. My purpose in posting
this message was to see what is the usual practice in situations such as
these. If the usual practice is to go back two years, then I don't want to
go back 17. If the usual practice is to pay 10% of the toal bill, then I
don't want to pay 75%. I hope customary practice isn't to pay 100% of the
bill over time -- not because in some sense it wouldn't be fair to do -- but
because it would be an unexpected major expense.

"/> I suggest that you don't do anything until you get the bill. It
may be that they are done. If they send you a bill, and it's not
painfully high, pay it and you're done. If the bill is
outrageously high, call and get the details about how it was
calculated. If they have gone back beyond the four year statute
of limitations, you can negotiate on that basis. If you don't
agree with their calculations regarding the amount used by the
added part of the house, you can negotiate on that basis.

If negotiations fail, file a complaint with the California Public
Utilities Commission. If your assumptions are correct about the
bypass and the gas company's actions, the gas company's conduct
was improper and may well be a violation of PUC standards. And
this isn't how the gas company operates in my experience (I'm your
neighbor). They lied to the customer about the need to change the
meter. There is no periodic replacement required as long as the
meter still works. They lied to gain access to the house. That's
trespass. They failed to tell the customer about an illegal
bypass. I would argue to the PUC that the PUC shouldn't trust
these liars about the bypass or about the calculations. In
connection with filing the complaint, you should review the PUC
standards and see if you can find specific requirements that the
gas company must deal fairly and honestly, or something like that.
Then include their violations in the complaint.

"/> Well, first of all they probably can't hit you up for the whole 17
years. The statute of limitation for most debts in California is 4
years. There might be an exception for utilities, but I doubt it.

Second, they will probably want to add something to your monthly bill
for a while to cover the gas that you used but didn't pay for. If it
seems reasonable, I'd say go ahead and pay it. First of all, you used
the gas and it's only fair you should pay for it. Second, there's
only so much time and energy in life, and it's better to use it doing
something that makes you money or that you enjoy rather than hassling
with a utility company.

If you think it's unreasonable, you can contact the PUC,
http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/

Or you can hire a lawyer. It depends on how much is at stake, and how
fast they want you to pay it off. And of course how much you enjoy
hassling with big companies. Some people get off on it, but most of
us would rather just get on with our life.

"/> The usual practice is to work out time payments and/or call it quits
for a percentage of the claimed amount. As others posted, you should
check with your state's utility commission whether there's any limit
to how far back the gas company can go. I suspect there's a limit
for cases of the company simply failing to bill you but not for your
using gas by bypassing the meter; but the utility commission can
tell you.

I accept that you're not morally guilty of theft of service, but you
may nevertheless be legally guilty. One legal standard -- which may
or may know apply here -- is whether you &quot;knew or should have known&quot;
that you were getting gas without paying for it. The idea is that at
some point, by shutting one's eyes to a situation, one becomes
guilty as if one had participated. As I say, I don't know whether
that applies here.

One thing I do wonder about: how is it that _some_ gas bypassed the
meter? Are there two separate supply pipes into your home? I assume
you must have been paying gas bills right along, or you would have
known something was wrong.

&gt; One thing I do wonder about: how is it that _some_ gas bypassed the
&gt; meter? Are there two separate supply pipes into your home? I assume
&gt; you must have been paying gas bills right along, or you would have
&gt; known something was wrong.

"/> As I have said, I am *assuming* that I'm in a situation where the converted
garages were served with free gas. Maybe that's not the case. It just seems
strange that a gas man showed up without notice, a functioning gas meter
would have to be replaced, they did an inventory of all my gas appliances,
not one but two people showed up, he used the word &quot;bypass,&quot; etc.

I don't know the technical aspects of the piping. But if there is a bypass,
just based on what that word means, I assume that there would be one line
coming from the street, then there would be a fork (or a &quot;Y&quot;), with one leg
going to the meter then to the main house, and the other leg going directly
to the converted garages.

Yes, I have been paying a gas bill all along and not having anything to
compare it to, it seemed reasonable to me. (It's about $80 a month in winter
and $50 in summer.)

&gt; Well, remember I haven't yet been told that I did use gas off the meter.
&gt; This is my assumption. And what if standard practice is simply to start
&gt; paying my fair share? I think I should let them tell me something --
&gt; anything -- first.

"/> FWIW

1st) There is normally a shut-off valve in the gas line just before it
enters the meter. This is where you would turn off you gas in the event
of a leak or the gas Company turns off the gas to change the meter.
While it is possible that someone might have installed a 'T' in the line
between the shut-off valve and the meter to divert gas before being
metered, it would be very obvious and unlikely that someone, like the
meter reader, hadn't noticed it before. It would be very unlikely for a
illegal tap to be inserted on the street side of the shut off valve
because they would have no way to turn off the gas at that point.

2nd) Even if the Gas Company DID find an illegal tap-off on their side
of the meter, the Company could, of course, remove it, but they would
NOT re-pipe your home to connect it correctly on your side of the meter.
They would leave the tap disconnected and tell you to hire a contractor
of your own to correctly connect the added pipe.

3rd) The Gas Company does change meters occasionally when they suspect
that a meter isn't reading correctly, is jammed, or there is some other
defect reported by a meter reader.

4th) To change the meter, the gas must be turned off. That means any
gas appliance that has a pilot light must be re-lit. It is the Gas
Companies obligation to check all appliances and re-light all pilot
lights. That is part of their job - many home owners have no idea how to
light a pilot light.

I have no idea what 'bypass' the gas man was talking about, but if he
didn't take you and show you the problem, I wouldn't read too much into
it. The rest of what happened is standard procedure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I live in Los Angeles. Yesterday, a serviceman from the Southern
California
&gt; Gas Company appeared unannounced and said that he need to change the
meter.
&gt; He said that every so often they change meters and mine hadn't been done
in
&gt; a while. This seemed awfully strange, but he came in a Gas Co. truck and
&gt; wore a Gas Co. uniform. I asked for I.D. and he provided it. Although this
&gt; made no sense to me, I couldn't figure out a reason *not* to have him
&gt;&quot;change the meter&quot; so I said, &quot;Sure, go ahead.&quot;

&gt; Five minutes later he came back and said it would take a little longer
&gt; because there was a bypass that needed to be fixed. It still didn't occur
to
&gt; me what was going on. I asked if he could fix it. He said yes. Then he
said
&gt; that a different gas man needed to come out and check all my gas
appliances.
&gt; So a half hour later, that is indeed what happened.

&gt; Later, after all this was done, and I had half forgotten about it, I
decided
&gt; to take a look at the &quot;new&quot; gas meter. But it didn't appear to be new at
&gt; all. It was kind of weathered. And then it hit me.

&gt; I've lived in this house since 1987. But when I bought it, I was told (and
&gt; it's part of the contract) that the conversion of the 4-car garage to a
&gt; mother-in-law apartment was done without permits. That was and has been
&gt; fine. I use it for a home office.

&gt; Now I think I know what he meant by &quot;bypass.&quot; It is my guess that people
who
&gt; did the conversion &quot;bypassed&quot; the gas meter and so I haven't been paying
for
&gt; gas for the converted part of the house. It is my guess that they had a
&gt; second gas man come out to verify what the first man found, and also to
&gt; inventory all the gas appliances so that they could figure out what I
should
&gt; have been paying and send me a bill. This is all a guess, but it would
seem
&gt; to fit the known facts. Needless to say, I knew nothing about this bypass.

&gt; My question is this: Although I don't want to cheat the Gas Co., it would
&gt; also be a burden to be hit with the bill for 17 years worth of back
charges.
&gt; Can they do that? What is my exposure and options?

"/> No, no, no...

doubtful, anyway.

All installations should have a &quot;bypass&quot;. There is a service tee in the line
just downstream of the meter. When new lines are tested/inspected, or a
meter is swapped out, air mist be purged from the new lines/meter. A
manifold is connected at the bypass tee to purge the air out of the meter,
before the lines are purged. It is usually a little 1/4 inch or smaller tee
/reducer with a plug, _in the customer's side_ of the meter. It was probably
rusted/galled/sheared off ... and at the very least, the meter man didn't
have the parts on his truck, didn't have the time, etc.

The first call was probably just the &quot;meter man&quot;, whose job is to do routine
meter swaps. It wasn't his job description to do any further repairs, so a
line man was dispatched. :-)

I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

But what I can't figure is: why didn't you just call the Gas Company and ask
them if there was a problem you should know about? I really don't think they
are &quot;out to get you&quot;.

Just to ease the minds of all concerned,
I went outside and took a shot of my meter... :-)

This is the bypass tee on my meter:
http://gyrogearloose.com/articles/bypass/

It simply allows access to the downstream piping, 'bypassing' the meter.
