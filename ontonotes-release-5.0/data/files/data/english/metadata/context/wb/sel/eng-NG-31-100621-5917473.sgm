Apple's New Calling: The iPhone
By Lev Grossman

If you've ever wondered how it works, this is how it works: I don't
call Steve, Steve calls me. Or more accurately, someone in Steve
Jobs's office calls someone in my office—someone at a much higher pay
grade —to say that he has something cool. I then fly to the
metastasized strip mall called Cupertino, Calif., where Apple lives,
sign some legal confidentiality stuff and am escorted to a conference
room that contains Jobs, some associates, and some lumps concealed
under some black towels. I stare at what was under the towels.
Everybody else stares at me.

This is how Apple, and nobody else, introduces new products to the
press. It can be awkward, because Jobs is high-strung and he expects
you to be impressed. I was, fortunately, and with good reason. Apple's
new iPhone could do to the cell phone market what the iPod did to the
portable music player market: crush it pitilessly beneath the weight
of its own superiority. This is unfortunate for anybody else who makes
cell phones, but it's good news for those of us who use them.

It's also good news for Jobs. Apple has had some explaining to do
lately about backdated stock options it issued to Jobs and some other
senior Apple executives. An internal investigation has cleared Jobs,
but a federal investigation and a shareholder lawsuit are still going
forward.

Sure, backdating options is common in Silicon Valley, but the essence
of Apple's identity is that it's an uncorporate corporation: a glossy
white iPod-colored company, the kind that doesn't get mixed up in this
kind of thing. When Jobs calls the iPhone "the most important product
Apple has ever announced, with the possible exception of the Apple II
and the Macintosh," he means, technologically. But now is not a
terrible time to be hitting a home run.

The iPhone developed the way a lot of cool things do: with a false
start. A few years ago Jobs noticed how many development dollars were
being spent—particularly in the greater Seattle metropolitan area—on
what are called tablet PCs: flat, portable computers that work with a
touchscreen instead of a mouse and keyboard. Jobs, being Jobs, figured
he could do better, so he had Apple engineers noodle around with a
tablet PC. When they showed him the touchscreen they came up with, he
got excited. So excited he forgot all about tablet computers.

Jobs had just led Apple on a triumphant rampage through a new market
sector, portable music players, and he was looking around for more
technology to conquer. Cell phones are perfect because even Grandma
has one: consumers bought nearly a billion of them last year. Break
off just 1% of that and you can buy yourself a lot of black
turtlenecks. Cell phones do all kinds of stuff—calling, text
messaging, Web browsing, contact management, music playback, photos
and video—but they do it very badly, by forcing you to press lots of
tiny buttons, navigate diverse heterogeneous interfaces and squint at
a tiny screen. "Everybody hates their phone," Jobs says, "and that's
not a good thing. And there's an opportunity there." To Jobs's
perfectionist eyes, phones are broken. Jobs likes things that are
broken. It means he can make something that isn't and sell it to you
for a premium price.

That was why, two and a half years ago, Jobs sicced his wrecking crew
of designers and engineers on the cell phone as we know and hate it.
They began by melting the face off a video iPod. No clickwheel, no
keypad. They sheared off the entire front and replaced it with a huge,
bright, vivid screen—that touchscreen Jobs got so excited about a few
paragraphs ago. When you need to dial, it shows you a keypad; when you
need other buttons, the screen serves them up. When you want to watch
a video, the buttons disappear. Suddenly, the interface isn't fixed
and rigid, it's fluid and molten. Software replaces hardware.

Into that iPod they stuffed a working version of Apple's operating
system, OS X, so the phone could handle real, non-toy applications
like Web browsers and e-mail clients. They put in a cell antenna, plus
two more antennas for WiFi and Bluetooth; plus a bunch of sensors, so
the phone knows how bright its screen should be, and whether it should
display vertically or horizontally, and when it should turn off the
touchscreen so you don't accidentally operate it with your ear.

Then Jonathan Ive, Apple's head of design, the man who shaped the iMac
and the iPod, squashed the case to less than half an inch thick, and
widened it to what looks like a bar of expensive chocolate wrapped in
aluminum and stainless steel. The iPhone is a typical piece of Ive
design: an austere, abstract, platonic-looking form that somehow also
manages to feel warm and organic and ergonomic. Unlike my phone. He
picks it up and points out four little nubbins on the back. "Your
phone's got feet on," he says, not unkindly. "Why would anybody put
feet on a phone?" Ive has the answer, of course: "It raises the
speaker on the back off the table. But the right solution is to put
the speaker in the right place in the first place. That's why our
speaker isn't on the bottom, so you can have it on the table, and you
don't need feet." Sure enough, no feet toe the iPhone's smooth lines.

All right, so it's pretty. Now pick it up and make a call. A big
friendly icon appears on that huge screen. Say a second call comes in
while you're talking. Another icon appears. Tap that second icon and
you switch to the second call. Tap the big "merge calls" icon and
you've got a three-way conference call. Pleasantly simple.

Another example: voicemail. Until now you've had to grope through your
v-mail by ear, blindly, like an eyeless cave-creature. On the iPhone
you see all your messages laid out visually, onscreen, labeled by
caller. If you want to hear one, you touch it. Done. Now try a text
message: Instead of jumbling them all together in your in-box, iPhone
arranges your texts by recipient, as threaded conversations made of
little jewel-like bubbles. And instead of "typing" on a four-by-four
number keypad, you get a full, usable QWERTY keyboard. You will never
again have to hit the 7 key four times to type a letter S.

Now forget about phone calls. Look at the video, which is impressively
crisp and plays on a screen larger than the video iPod's. This is the
first time the hype about "rich media" on a phone has actually looked
plausible. Look at the e-mail client, which handles attachments,
in-line images, HTML e-mails as adroitly as a desktop client. Look at
the Web browser, a modified version of Safari that displays actual Web
pages, not a teensy crunched-down version of the Web. There's a Google
map application that's almost worth the price of admission on its own.
Weaknesses? Absolutely. You can't download songs directly onto it from
the iTunes store, you have to export them from a computer. And even
though it's got WiFi and Bluetooth on it, you can't sync iPhone with a
computer wirelessly. And there should be games on it. And you're
required to use it as a phone—you can't use it without signing up for
cellular service. Boo.

The iPhone breaks two basic axioms of consumer technology. One, when
you take an application and put it on a phone, that application must
be reduced to a crippled and annoying version of itself. Two, when you
take two devices—such as an iPod and a phone—and squish them into one,
both devices must necessarily become lamer versions of themselves. The
iPhone is a phone, an iPod, and a mini-Internet computer all at once,
and contrary to Newton—who knew a thing or two about apples—they all
occupy the same space at the same time, but without taking a hit in
performance. In a way iPhone is the wrong name for it. It's a handheld
computing platform that just happens to contain a phone.

Why is Apple able to do things most other companies can't? Partly by
charging for it: The iPhone will cost $499 for a 4GB model, $599 for
8GB, which makes it expensive, but not a luxury item. And partly
because the company has highly diverse talent who are good at
hardware, software, industrial design and Internet services. Most
companies just do one or two things well.

Unlike most competitors, Apple also places an inordinate emphasis on
interface design. It sweats the cosmetic details that don't seem very
important until you really sweat them. "I actually have a
photographer's loupe that I use to look to make sure every pixel is
right," says Scott Forstall, Apple's vice-president of Platform
Experience (whatever that is). "We will argue over literally a single
pixel." As a result, when you swipe your finger across the screen to
unlock the iPhone, you're not just accessing a system of nested menus,
you're entering a tiny universe, where data exist as bouncy, gemlike,
animated objects that behave according to consistent rules of virtual
physics. Because there's no intermediary input device—like a mouse or
a keyboard—there's a powerful illusion that you're physically handling
data with your fingers. You can pinch an image with two fingers and
make it smaller.

To witness the iPhone launch from behind the curtain (or under the
towel) is to see the controlling hand of Steve Jobs, for whom this is
an almost mystically significant year. He's 52 years old. It's been 30
years since he founded Apple (with Stephen Wozniak), and 10 since he
returned there after having been fired. In that decade Apple's stock
has gone up more than 1,000%. Neither age nor success (nor cancer
surgery in 2004) have significantly mellowed him, though some of the
silver in his beard is creeping into his hair. All technologists
believe their products are better than other people's, or at least
they say they do, but Jobs believes it a little more than most. In the
hours we spent talking about the iPhone, Jobs trash-talked the Treo,
the BlackJack, the Sony PSP

Frak me, but it's almost a Mac Mini in my pocket. I read somewhere it's
motion sensitive like the Wii controller, and to zoom in on the web

And my current Sprint contract *just* ended.

The only bummer is the camera. My place of employment does not allow

Apple may have made a serious mistake in not offering the phone on America's
Most Reliable Network. It is interesting that they chose GSM rather than the
technically superior CDMA.

Possibly.  Or perhaps the Most Reliable Network made a mistake in not
partnering with Apple.

But Cingular?  The lowest-rated cell phone provider in America?  That's
gonna stop me from getting one unless Cingular improves dramatically.

Not true. Well, yes, Sprint is usually worse, but Cingular's coverage is
consistently worse than Verizon's, in every region of the country.

Apple wanted a device that they could sell the most units worldwide, so
they went with GSM, which meant getting stuck with Cingular. Also,
Verizon is pushing it's own music service so didn't want to give up that
revenue stream to Apple.

The phone part of the device is almost an afterthought, especially given
the lack of 3G capability in the first model. They should sell a version
of it with no phone service, but with an ExpressCard slot so users can
insert a 3G card from whatever carrier they want.

The reaction to the iPhone by people they interviewed was almost always
the same. Very cool, too expensive, and they wouldn't buy one for $500
or $600. If the price comes down to $300-400, then Apple will have a winner.

So you're a Verizon shill ?

You apparently haven't been reading a fair cross section of reviews.

A better ipod.
A better "Blackberry" type phone
A better internet device with True html =browser.', and WiFi
A better UI.
A phone without buttons that will make calls when you sit down and
case presses those buttons.

And in the 5 months between now and when the phone comes out,
it will likely have more features than you see now. It is after all
running Apple's OS X.

Yes, however if you have actually tried both Sprint and Cingular, you will
find that Sprint is much better especially with there excellent roaming
capability. The only thing that Sprint lacks in customer service.

Unlikely. Most Verizon handsets no longer include AMPS, yet Verizon
still beat Cingular in every metro area in the country, in many by huge
margins.

But yes, the analog coverage is a plus. I was roaming onto Cingular's
analog network two weeks ago, in an area with no digital coverage by any
carrier. Ironic to be using Cingular's network, with a Verizon phone, in
an area where 95%+ of Cingular's customers could not use Cingular's
network, and had no coverage.

In due time, and possibly even when the phone actually ships.  I can
easily imagine something with a similar form factor that is just a
little thicker for the 80GB drive (or 120GB or whatever the max is when
the next iPod upgrade comes out).  The beauty of the $500 pricing, if
there can be beauty in that, is that Apple can not only compare it to a
$200 nano + $300 phone in one direction, but it can also ship a similar
looking 6G iPod at $350 and say "look at all you could get if you went
with an iPhone for just $150 more".  That might not convince someone
with a huge media library they want to have with them at all times, but
it does help keep tiers to keep extracting "another $50" from people.

No, they looked at *the entire damn globe* and determined that quad band
GSM allowed the most coverage.  Cingular has just recently made the push
to all GSM, and it may even bite them because they were pushing a lot of
current subscribers to upgrade their old phones by the end of 2006.  If
Cingular had any brains they would extend their non-GSM service past the
end of March until the time the iPhone ships.  Otherwise, if I'm going
to be locked into a contract for a phone I don't want, I might as well
just switch to T-Mobile.

Cingular was at least smart enough to see what partnering with Apple got
them.  Most phones are commodities that everyone has and are often
"disposable".  While it's all good fun to lock people in over common
phones, the real money is in an exclusive phone and a sweet, sweet
$90/month contract.  Balk over the $500 iPhone price tag all you want,
but it's nothing compared to how much money is coming in on the plan
itself.

Yeah, branding is going to be a really interesting issue to play out.  I
saw the screen displaying the Cingular name and, honestly, I'd rather
they tag the back of the phone than take up screen real estate.  It's
not like people are going to be changing carriers so often that we need
to see it displayed on the top of the screen all the time.

That is exactly the same comment many people, including reviewers, made
when the iPod first came out. "Very cool, too expensive." And the same
thing will probably happen this time around: it's so cool that people
will buy them at the high price, and Apple won't be able to keep up with
the initial demand. In a couple of years the 3rd generation iPhone with
32GB of flash, WiMax, and a second camera pointing the correct way for
video calling, will still cost U$600, but the iPhone Classic will be
available for half that.

A year later Microsoft will introduce the Zune Phone. No one will notice.

Not quite.  Go visit Apple's web site for the details, and some great

There are three sensors in the iPhone:
- A motion sensor that can detect when you're holding it in portrait

- An ambient light sensor, to dim the display in dark rooms.

- A proximity sensor, to know when the phone is up against your ear.
When it's against your ear, the display shuts off (to save battery)
and becomes non-responsive (so your face doesn't end up pushing
random buttons.)

No squeezing.  To zoom images, you can double-tap, or you can use a
two-finger approach.  Put two fingers on the image, then drag them

Technicalities are less important than business issues here.

Verizon would never resell a phone that doesn't have its UI mangled to

T-Mobile's problem is that there are two many areas in the U.S. where
their coverage is poor, by virtue of their late entry, and their 1900
MHz network. I.e., at my house, in a very urban part of Silicon Valley,
about one mile from Apple's campus, there is no T-Mobile coverage.
They've been fighting to put in a tower for about six years now
(Cingular started, and then when Cingular sold the 1900 MHz network to
T-Mobile, T-Mobile took over the fight...a friend of mine, whose house
backs up to where the tower would go, has been leading the successful
fight against the tower). I used to have no Cingular coverage, now I
have mediocre Cingular coverage, and no T-Mobile coverage. T-Mobile is
at least upfront about it, they check addresses and then if there is no
coverage they advise you against purchasing their service.

With Cingular GSM, you can get all the world coverage that T-Mobile
offers, though you may pay a bit more for international coverage on
other T-Mobile networks outside the U.S., than T-Mobile USA customers
pay (not sure of this actually).

I'd compare the iPhone more to the Newton. Cool technology, but enough
gotchas to limit its appeal. No 3G, only available on a poor network,
and less capability than PDA phones, though a much cooler design. But
not to worry, the first version of any product has always got some
design issues. In a couple of years there may be a CDMA version, and a
GSM version with 3G, as well as a way to load applications onto it.

the extent Cingular (or Sprint) would be willing to (can you picture the
ads?  "iPhone- with VCast!" ;-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, Verizon is pushing it's own music service so didn't want

Agreed, but I think they'd have made an exception for the iPhone- I
suspect there were bigger points they were unwilling to conceed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The phone part of the device is almost an afterthought, especially
&gt; given the lack of 3G capability in the first model.

Agree. IMHO, Apple is very form (including ease-of-use) over substance-
iPods aren't the best spec'd MP3 players out there, but they've got the
style and ergonomics down better than everyone else.  I suspect the same
will be true of the iPhone- browsing the web on a good capable browser,
even at EDGE speed, on a large, gorgeous screen, will be a more
satisfying experience than EVDO on, say, a a WinMo 5 device, even though
EVDO downloads that "Sorry, your browser doesn't support Java or Frames"
error message so much faster than EDGE can!  ;-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  They should sell a version of it with no phone service, but with an
&gt; ExpressCard slot so users can insert a 3G card from whatever
&gt; carrier they want.
">

That won't happen unless the Express Card could be made white, embossed
with a mirror-like shine and not extend from the device.  Hell, they
won't put flash memory slots on an iPod Nano, you think they'll let
people stick ugly grey cards with flashing LEDs in unapproved colors that
hang out of their pretty phone? ;-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The reaction to the iPhone by people they interviewed was almost
&gt; always the same. Very cool, too expensive, and they wouldn't buy
&gt; one for $500 or $600. If the price comes down to $300-400, then
&gt; Apple will have a winner.
">

I suspect the marketing will parallel the iPod- keep them expensive and
90% perfect for the first generation, to make it an object of desire.
Then improve them for 2nd gen; add the obvious missing features (like
3G), offer more colors, and reduce the depth and width 10% to ensure
you'll need new docking accessories and cases for the upgraded model!  ;-)

Like the iPod, it'll be at hit right away even overpriced, then it will
be a HUGE hit at the price drop, when the knockoffs show up, and everyone
copies the full screen design with far clunkier UIs, then eventually
it'll be ubiquitous when Apple releases the stripped-down iPhone Nano,
with smaller screen, and the much less expensive, displayless
iPhone Shuffle, that can only dial people at random from your phone
book at the touch of a button... ;-)

Then, maybe 3 or 4 years from now, Motorola will have a hit with a
groundbreaking design: a phone with a physical, tactile keypad made of
little rubber buttons laid out in a 3x4 grid that they'll call the
KYPD...

Depends what you're trying to do. I have a Blackberry and I use it

browser on any cellphone - and Blackberry's is among the best of a bad
bunch - is so annoying. With an iPhone - which I'd jump at if I hadn't
JUST bought an 8GB nano - the browsing time would increase a lot.

Don't forget that if you're in range of a Wifi AP, you jump off the GSM
network for your browsing. Wouldn't surprise me at all if Apple
integrated iChat voice into the Wifi side of it.

I also use the memo feature to make notes of movies I want to get,
passwords and so on.

Well, a 4 GB nano + a subsidized non-Apple smart phone would probably be
$400-500 anyway[1]. Plus, it's clear Apple is building a platform for
the future here. Remember, the first iPod was $400, and everyone said
that was too expensive. And it was, for the mass market, for a device
which most people didn't even realize they wanted at the time. But it
was enough to get things rolling, and prices dropped, and devices got
more compelling, and the iPod eventually became a mass market hit.

[1] Yes, the non-Apple phone would probably technically play music as
well, but most smart phones don't provide anything like the Apple user
experience. Most of the people I know who have smart phones have iPods
as well.

That's not exactly Cingular branding, that's telling you who's network

&gt; T-Mobile's problem is that there are two many areas in the U.S. where
&gt; their coverage is poor, by virtue of their late entry, and their 1900

I'm not sure "late entry" is an excuse.  T-Mo simply hasn't benefited as
greatly from mergers as other carriers.  The individual wireless
companies that comprised, say, Cingular (PacBell, AT&amp;T Wireless, SBMS and
BellSouth) were certainly no bigger than T-Mo is currently.  Same goes
for Verizon's "ancestors."  With the exception of Sprint and Nextel (who
themselves merged together, of course) all of the "national" cellular
companies are amalgams of smaller regional ones, due to the fact that the
FCC originally kept cellular regional in order to allow more players in a
very spectrum-limited game.  Only after the five 1900MHz licenses per
market were established to augment the two original 800MHz licenses, were
cellular companies really allowed to merge to create the national
carriers we have today.

I'm certainly not arguing with your premise that T-Mo is limited in
coverage compared to other carriers- I'm only arguing with your reasons
why. ;-)

T-Mo really wasn't much later in the game than Sprint, who for a very
long time was the industry leader in native coverage (because the FCC
didn't limit the total territory of 1900MHz carriers like they did 800.)
Sadly, T-Mo's biggest problem is they're sort of a fifth wheel now- all
the companies who would have benefitted most from reciprocal roaming
agreements with them have merged into their largest competitor!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; With Cingular GSM, you can get all the world coverage that T-Mobile

&gt; sure of this actually).

Probably six of one, half dozen of the other.  Roaming rates are by
country rather than by carrier, so I suspect Cingular leverages T-Mo's
competition against them in foreign countries.

I'm not sure all of that is accurate.  3G is probably coming (and
frankly, unless you're tethering a computer, I find EDGE perfectly
acceptable for PDA use), and despite your problem with Cingular, they
certainly have a decent network, even if it's not the absolute best.  As
far as less capability than a PDA phone, it's certainly better spec'd with
a more robust OS, so I expect 3rd party developers will be on this thing
like flies on a horse.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
