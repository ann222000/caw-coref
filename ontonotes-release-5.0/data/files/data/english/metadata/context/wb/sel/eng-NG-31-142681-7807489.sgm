Study this Carefully, for I believe these occurances are coming to America:

Why I have dreams. Why you have dreams.

I wanted to explain to everyone why I have dreams, that I feel are sometimes
prophetic. It's not because of me. I'm nothing. In the realm of society, and
social status, I'm bottom of the dung hill. It's because of God, and certain
things He said He would do, in these last days. (By saying last days, I
mean, the last days within this Earth Cycle; or sometimes called the &quot;End of
time.&quot;)

God made certain promises to all mankind. That in the end time, right before
the LORD comes back to earth to judge every man, woman and child for their
works, He'd make one last ditch effort to warn mankind, and also save
mankind. He also said that there would be end time apostasy within the
Churches that name the name of Christ. We see that being fulfilled with all
the TV Money Preachers, that serve Mammon. (Materialistic Gain) He also said
that in the world, people would become lovers of themselves, which we have
become. Lovers of pleasure, and with the advent of cyber sex, adulterous
affairs between couples, swingers, etc., that is coming to pass. Prideful,
and no greater example of pride right now is GW Bush. Incontinent, that is
laying around a lot. Disobedient to parents, which we see widespread now.
Covetous, which we see. Some people would kill you for less then $4.00.
Also, with the emphasis on TV on having the nice home, the nice car, the
nice clothes: People have become absolutely covetous.

But, God said He would do one last ditch thing to try to warn people about
the road they are on, and also to turn back to Him, and escape the
everlasting firey judgment of the Lake of Fire and Brimstone. (Sulphur)
Revelation 20:15.

The Prophet of the LORD: Joel prophesied this:

Joel Chapter 2

2:28 And it shall come to pass afterward, [that] I will pour out my spirit
upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old
men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:

2:29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I
pour out my spirit.

2:30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and
fire, and pillars of smoke.

2:31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before
the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.

The Apostle Peter even went so far to say this actually started on the Day
of Pentecost.

So, I don't dream because I'm someone special. If you saw me in the store,
you'd look at me with utter contempt, as many do. You wouldn't be friends
with me. You'd call me names, such as weirdo, and worse.

But I dream, and you dream, because this is God, speaking to our hearts and
minds, in these last days to turn back to Him, before firey judgment unfolds
upon all.

So, that's the best way I can explain it.

You may disagree, but I believe the Word. And you guys don't know how much I
fear the LORD and His judgments.

Blood Machine Dream

I dreamt of a machine that you put a drop of blood into, and it generated a
special number, unique to you. I didn't sleep long last night, so that's all
I remember.

Pain Room Dream - July 18th, 2007

Last night's dreams were snippets of stuff that didn't make sense, but one
part stood out.

I was walking down a dark corridoor, and looked into a small room. There was
3 tall guys, in satin green uniforms.
They had very broad shoulders and all 3 were taking turns beating up on this
guy.
Dreams went on, but nothing that stood out.

Police State Crackdown
(Helicopter and Motorcycle Wolfpacks)

Friday, July 3rd, 2007

&quot;I dreamt a police state came into being in America, and the Police were
using high tech devices to track Dissenters to World Government, and also
Christians.

They worked the streets, looking for their prey, using a technique that I
call &quot;Wolfpacking.&quot;

In this technique, they had helicopters overhead, using search lights,
infrared, and other surveillance devices. On the ground, the Police used
Motorcycles to quickly patrol whole neighborhoods. These were not the police
motorcycles Ponch and Jon rode. These were very high tech, racing
motorcycles. They were able to traverse the streets quickly. Both the
helicopters and motorcycles were patched into a central command post. They
moved swiftly, and were very methodical in their approach to finding
victims, the victims being deceived Christians about the &quot;Rapture,&quot; and
dissenters to World Government.

Virio Govich Dream

I was at a house and Tom Cruise was having a Party. He was handing out
Lavish Gifts to all his guests. He was handing out Diamond Necklaces; all
kinds of really rich presents.

So over in the Corner, was this real TALL Guy. He had to be 13 foot tall. He
was in a solid black suit, and real thin. That suit wasn't one of those you
buy at Sears. This one was really expensive; I'd say Single Needle
Tailoring, and expensive material. Probably around $3,000.00 for that suit
alone.

So, I left the Party, and then later I walked back. This dude came outside
the house, and I yelled at him:

&quot;Hey! Send out that big dude!&quot;

So, the big dude came out. He was very tall. His stride had to be 5 foot in
between steps.

So, he comes up to me, and I say:

&quot;You're a very tall dude!&quot;

He looks down at me, puts his hands down to his side, and clenches his
fists, and grits his teeth, and in very pronounced English with a very
Russian Accent, he goes:

&quot;I am Virio Govich.&quot;

He said this real forceful.

I look up at him, for he's very tall, and I say:

&quot;Virio What?&quot;

He looks down at me again and says:

&quot;Virio Govich.&quot;

I replied:

&quot;Man, you're a very tall Guy!&quot;

He smiled at me, and says:

&quot;Yes. And America will know when Virio Govich is unleashed on America.&quot;

Then I woke up.

A further google search and Wikipedia shows no references for anything, or
anyone named

Virio Govich.

I dreamt of Hell
By: Luke Nichols

This is why if you're a Christian, it is so important to witness to the
lost.

I dreamt of Hell last night. First thing I remember was I was on a
University Campus, witnessing to a Professor. I was telling him about Jesus,
and His love, and he says something like, &quot;I am in a bit of hot water, for
sleeping with some Students.&quot; I went on to tell him more about the Lord
Jesus Christ of Nazareth. He says, &quot;Well, I've never actually believed that
story at all.&quot;

Some Evil Angels came down, and stood there, as I tried to tell him more
about the love of Jesus. The evil angel got in between us, and says: &quot;That's
it. His time is up. He's ours now.&quot;

I remember then, walking off the Campus, and they lowered the Flag to
half-mast. I knew in my heart this Professor was now dead. As the flag came
down, the students started to cheer.

The next scene, in my dream, I was going down a street, and the same evil
angel was there, leading a whole group of people down the street. Around
them, everyone was going about their business, and shopping. 3 Teenaged Kids
were there, and the first one said, &quot;I don't understand what I'm doing
here.&quot; The third one says, &quot;We died in a car crash last night.&quot; The first
one says again, &quot;I still don't understand what I'm doing here.&quot; The third
one says again, &quot;We got killed in a crash last night.&quot;

Then, I saw the group of people go right into a stone arched door, and up
these steps. They walked into a glass room, and glass doors closed behind
them. Outside the window, you could still see people shopping, and driving
by. A little old Lady walks up and says to the evil angel, &quot;Could I have
little water. My mouth is so dry.&quot;

The evil angel answered the entire group: &quot;You have all died in your sins.
You're going to hell. None of you will ever taste water again.&quot;

A man from the back of the crowd jumps out front, with a gun, and begins
shooting the evil angel, and the glass wall, but the bullets have no effect.

The evil angel acted like he didn't even know about the shots, and leafed
through a clipboard. He then says, &quot;Ok. That's it. You're all going to Hell
now.&quot;

A darkness came down from the top of the room, and engulfed the entire
crowd, and it pushed them all through the floor, into the waiting fire.

The next scene, in my dream, I was in a room, sitting on a couch. A man was
there sitting beside me. I knew he was God in my dream. He tells me a
politician was going to die, and end up in Hell. I replied, &quot;Well, Lord,
from my reckoning, the way politicians lie and steal and cheat, they are ALL
going to Hell.&quot; He nodded his head yes.

The next scene in my dream, I was carried up to a very high mountain. I
looked down below, and there was a beautiful city, with a castle and lush
green fields. I saw men and women and children walking in and out of the
city, into the lush green fields. There was a wall on the far side of those
fields and on the other side, I saw a gaping, burning hole in the ground,
with smoke, and fire and people screaming out. The people on the lush side
seemed to not hear the cries of those on the other side of the wall, in the
pit.

I then woke up: It was 3:33am.

This is a true account of this dream. People better wake up!

Luke Nichols

My very first dream of Hell (1993)

I dreamt my Grandfather, my uncle and me all were in his old truck. (He use
to drive a beat up old truck all around town.)

We backed into an old time service garage, and it was white. We all got out
of the truck, and in the back were bags of aluminum cans. Each one of us had
our own bag or bags. My grandfather had a bag with about 6 cans in it. My
uncle had a bag with no cans in it. I had two full bags of cans.

We walked away from the truck, towards the rear, and there was a podium,
with a man in white standing there. He tells my Grandfather and my Uncle,
&quot;I&quot;m sorry, you cannot go in. Your names are not written here.&quot; He then
tells me I'm ok, that my name is written there. He then walked away from the
podium.

I remember in my dream I was real

We can't *all* be wrong.

I disagree dreams are just our way of thinking when we sleep and the images
are just a different wave of our thoughts. At least that's my theory. Also
if God exists you shouldn't fear him all he wants is for you to live your
life.
