A little background. My son, now 6, was never into coloring and "drawing"
back when he was little. I noted it then. I notice now that he does draw and
try to express himself on paper, but his drawings are way simple and
abstract compared to his peers. He HATES writing. He is awkward with the
pencil in his hands. He labors mightily over letters.

He is currently in public school, at least for the remainder of this year. I
don't, personally, beleive that someone needs to learn a skill on someone
else's timeline. So if I succeed at bringing him home to homeschool (as in
if I prove to myself and my husband that we can make it on his salary!) I
will focus on bringing the joy back into expressing oneself on paper before
I proceed to looking into writing.

That said, writing is an important skill. If he does wind up in first grade
next year, they do a lot of writing says DS's kindergarten teacher. So if
there was a way to encourage writing success, perhaps I should look into it.
I would not be surprised, though I don't know for certain, that his dislike
of writing is linked tohis lack of success. When he was little, he was never
into process as they are supposed to be in the toddler and preschool years.
He was always frustrated when he could not draw a perfect representation of
whatever he wanted. I think that persists.

Anyway does anyone have anything to say about Handwriting Without Tears? I
saw reference to it in one of the homeschool curricula I was looking at. I
see mixed reviews on the amazon site. Anyone have any other thougths about
anything related to writing for me?

Thanks so much!

We have used it for 3+ years and like it.  One adaptation that worked
for us was to take their little chalkboard method to a larger scale at
first.  Our easle has a chalkboard on one side.  I put a smiley face
sticker on the top left corner of the frame for the starting corner.
We made one very large letter at a time.  After learning to make the
letters with the full arm motion, it seemed easier to progress to
making smaller ones.

This may not be any help, but:
In my children's experience drawing and writing have been very different.
dd#1 (age 6) didn't really draw and, as you've commented on your ds,
generally when she did they weren't as good as others. She didn't start
trying to draw something until she was relatively old to her peers (she was
over 4yo), before she would just do patterns on the paper, certainly for
well after she was writing fluently. But I noticed once she was trying to
draw, say people, she would carefully put in every detail, like pupils in
the eyes, and a tummy button (even when dressed). But her writing is
beautiful, and she loves doing it (particularly on her terms like story
writing at home). She's not that keen on drawing and (particularly for a
girl!!) not that keen on colouring although she puts up with a bit. She had
to be taught how to hold the pencil correctly and even now occasionally
needs some reminding.
dd#2 (age 3) loves drawing and painting and was trying to draw particular
things by 2yo. Her drawings aren't brilliant, but she usually makes an
effort to make it "something", with some resemblance. But she doesn't like
writing for long. She'll do a few letters, like her name, but, although
she's capable of doing most of her letters she doesn't choose to most of the
time. If she's doing writing you're quite likely to find her doing some of
it with her mouth or feet as well as the hand although she naturally holds
the pencil correctly with her hand. She doesn't seem to enjoy writing in the
way #1 did.

From #1s experience I'd avoid anything like handwriting practice. In her
year they're now doing joined up writing. She loves writing when it's saying
something, but hates the practice handwriting she has to do. I've agreed
with the teacher that she doesn't need to do the repeating a single set of
letters over and over again, but instead can make up her own sentences with
the letters she's learning how to join up. That seems to be much better for
her.
What really got her writing going was writing postal letters.The year she
learnt to write she used to write letters to Granny and friends a lot. Maybe
if you could find someone who would write back for your ds it would be an
incentive. Or could you find some free stuff he would have to write off for?
Maybe if you printed a letter off at first and he has to fill in missing
words might be less daunting at first.

I waswondering how his fine motor control is too? It may be no problem, but
it might be something he doesn't do so much of, so working on that might
help a bit with pencil control.
I think you've said before he's quiet into experiment/science? He might like
some of those little electric (battery powered) games where you have to move
a ring round a piece of curly wire without touching it or it makes a buzzing
noise (I hope you know what I mean because I don't know what they're called)

These are red flags to me. He may have a disability.

If he is having trouble with the mechanics of drawing and writing,
interventions to help him with his fine motor skills may really help him. In
addition, maybe he should be typing instead of writing.

I wonder if he is on a different cognitive level than his peers. Special
education may help him.

You really need to talk to your school about this. His doctor should be
helpful as well.

Yes. He is definitely on a different cognitive level than his peers. Most of
his peers are working on letter recognition. DS reads very well. Most of his
peers (kindergarten) are working on number recognition, counting, AB
patterns, sorting. DS is working on multi-digit addition and multiplication.

Sorry if this sounds defensive, but geez. Where did you get special ed out

I didn't jump to any conclusions, other than the school may be able to help.
Part of that help *could* include special ed. Note that I used the word
*may.*

And if he will benefit by going to a resource room to help with is
coordination or fine motor skills, that is special ed. Special ed doesn't
mean that there is anything wrong with your child, only that he gets the
help he needs to improve.

The other thing that I would point out is that my reply was not only

I taught (6th grade) a very bright boy with cerebral palsy who had a
great deal of problem with writing, and he had 'special ed' for that
to help him with his writing.  He also had help in gym BTW - he walked
with crutches.  That's a somewhat extreme example of course

I taught my sister (2.5 years younger) to read, and do math when I was
in first grade.  Also to sing the songs etc that I was doing.  But I
was not interested in teaching writing, so she did everything orally.
I didn't care for doing it myself much although I loved to color.

When she got to kindergarten she could read very well, but she didn't
know anything about writing.  The powers that be decided that since
she was reading, spelling and doing arithmetic at a far higher level
than first grade, that she should skip first grade, but she didn't
know how even to print.  So my mom taught her to print over the
summer.  She scrunched her mouth up when she did it, and still will do
that if she's under tension.

BTW home schooling would not have been an option, and I doubt that my
parents would have considered it if it had been.

There is a room full of twenty kids, each with a different set of abilities

What would you do in school if you were a teacher?

Montessouri schools may meet his needs better than they are being met now,
however.

One of the things that you might consider is letting him use a computer to
write. He may take to it like a cook to a kitchen or a scientist to a
laboratory. It may enable him to write without the troublesome mechanics of
using pencil and paper. I don't say that jokingly. I much prefer a computer
than pen and paper.

The other thing you can do is start the homework without tears thing now,
and continue it over the summer. That would give you a better idea if you
want to home school him.

By way of disclaimer... Ya'll know my views often seem extreme. Of course,
they don't to me...

The problem I have is the notion that a child need to learn to do something
that they are not ready to learn in order to make the administration of a
bloated system easier. Namely he needs to be able to write in order to
demonstrate to the overburdened system that he knows something about the
other subject matter that is being studies. It is the only way for a very
small number of teachers to get communication from a very large number of
students. Don't get me wrong, I don't blame the schools. We ask them to do
more and more every year. But that does not lessen my desire to educate my
children differently. I''ll bet my last dollar that when 1. the external
pressure to deliver is relieved and 2. some reason to do so occurs, ds will
decide to learn to write. But that's just me off on a little side blather.

If I were a teacher I would try my damndest to get a job at an alternative
school. That said, in my vivid imagination I see smart technology partnered
with creative people to deliver education to kids at their own level and
meeting their needs. The 20 kids in the room are not grouped by this
arbitrary age designation at all, but move around based on where they belong
within the material set.

I certainly will do that at home. If he goes back to school next year, I

This is a pretty common G/T profile. A lot of GT kids really dislike writing
because their brains are working faster than their bodies, and many have
some fine motor delays as well. I've heard a lot of different diagnosis
(mild CP, Dysgraphia, Hypotonia), but pretty much it leads to a kid who can
read well, talk the hind leg of a donkey, but can't complete worksheets in
class legibly to save their lives.

The best suggestion I can give? Start him typing now, and if you have
insurance which will cover it, get an OT referral because learning how to
make letters with less fuss will help him get his ideas on paper.
Unfortunately, usually such kids won't qualify for special ed support in
school (even though a child with a lower functioning level and similar
difficulties would be able to get scribing or adaptive technology support)
because they're performing on or above grade level-the fact that they SHOULD
be able to perform much higher is irrelevant from the school system's POV.

Gifted/Talented-IE, IQ above 130 on most standardized assessments, usually
performing at least 2 years above chronological age in at least one (often
multiple) areas.

http://www.educationaloptions.com/levels_giftedness.htm
This article gives a summary of characteristics seen at different levels of
giftedness, even before children are formally tested (which in most school
systems happens in about 3rd grade).

An occupational therapist can see what he's doing, and give you ideas as to
what will work best for him. I fit this profile, and the best thing which
ever happened to me (at 5th grade, when I could easily handle college level
work, but was writing like a kindergartener) was that an OT sat down with me
and basically helped me create my own script handwriting from scratch,
putting together strokes which worked for me into a very distinctive, but
legible, script. It will never be considered "great" handwriting, but I can
do it over time without fatiguing too much and it's readable-and that,
coupled with typing and computers getting smaller, made a major difference
academically. I believe Writing without Tears was developed by an
occupational therapist.

If you can get a medical referral, most insurance plans will pay for a few
sessions of OT, and if you're willing to follow through at home, that's
likely to be all it will take to make life much, much easier for him. It's
not just "not able to meet school's expectations", but "able to meet his own
expectations". It is very frustrating to have ideas in your brain and to
want to get them on paper and be unable to do it.

OT should be provided by the school system, but in general, kids who are on
or above grade level academically won't get such services without a medical
diagnosis which automatically qualifies them for said services, and in most
cases, MDs are moving away from the more blanket diagnosis (like mild
cerebral palsy, which is a qualifying label since IDEA was authorized) to
the more specific (like hypotonia or athetosis, both of which, 20 years ago,
would have been considered forms of CP, and as stand alone labels, qualify
the child for absolutely nothing).

I have a very early reader myself, who dearly wants to write. So far, she's
pretty satisfied to "read" her scribbles to me and to dictate to me, spell
words with magnetic letters, and the like, but if she starts showing signs
of really needing to write, either for her purposes or for outside ones,
the first thing I'll be doing is trying to get an OT's input on what to do
next.

Yeah, I have a friend who homeschooled her kids until the 6th and 7th
grades.  The older child has a pretty severe learning disability, and
a pretty severe speech disability.  There is no way of knowing whether
or how much better off he'd have been if there had been other adults
looking out for him.  He may have done better at home with his
learning disability, but I really do wish she'd taken him for speech
therapy from an early age at least.

Stephanie,

I don't see Jeff's suggestions as at all derogatory.  Given the school
setting your child is in, my own suggestion would be special ed,
tutoring (in-school peers, adult private tutor), or homeschooling (in
addition to the regular school) to teach handwriting.  All of these
choices applying only if you think your child is ready to learn
handwriting.

My 2yo knows all his letters and numbers, and can read and spell a few
words.  He knows where all the letters and numbers are on a qwerty
keyboard, and he can type his own userid and password, launch his
browser and navigate his favorite online children's games.  And he has
mastered all mouse functions except cut&amp;paste (he can cut, but does
not see any point to paste).  He loves to drag things into the trash,
and use scrollbars.  He has typed letters on the computer since he was
5 months old and has chosen the letters to type by name for over a
year now.  He can count to 10 and has begun simple addition and can
tell time.  Yet he has barely begun to write by hand.  One day I found
him tracing letters printed large size on a piece of paper.  He is
learning the alphabet song.

School isn't so much about learning in lockstep with other children as
about learning foundation skills before being presented with skills
that build on those foundations.  You may reject lockstep schooling,
but take care that you do not let your child skip learning necessary
foundations!

To decide if you want to homeschool, try starting now at shadowing his
teachers' work with him.  Ie, know what he is learning now, how well
it is going, and think ahead.  What should your child be learning a
few weeks from now, a few months from now?  What techniques and
materials would you use to teach him?  Are there any holes in his
education now?  It is work!  Have a work plan.

You've been educating your son for six years now. However, the formal
education is different from the type of education that you have been giving
him.

You get an idea if how does in a more formal setting than you have been in.

Plus, you may find out that giving him this sort of education is not the

&gt; The problem I have is the notion that a child need to learn to do

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, I think there is a great advantage to kids interacting with
&gt;&gt;&gt; other kids and adults.

&gt;&gt; Yes this is another reason to consider homeschooling. Through coops and
&gt;&gt; the like that abound now that it is more popular, the kids are exposed to
&gt;&gt; a much wider group, including being exposed to different aged kids.

&gt; Sure, use my words against me. ;-)

&gt; I was thinking there would be an advantage to having kids in school,

&gt; Stephanie,

&gt; I don't see Jeff's suggestions as at all derogatory.  Given the school
&gt; setting your child is in, my own suggestion would be special ed,
&gt; tutoring (in-school peers, adult private tutor), or homeschooling (in
&gt; addition to the regular school) to teach handwriting.  All of these
&gt; choices applying only if you think your child is ready to learn
&gt; handwriting.

&gt; My 2yo knows all his letters and numbers, and can read and spell a few
&gt; words.  He knows where all the letters and numbers are on a qwerty
&gt; keyboard, and he can type his own userid and password, launch his
&gt; browser and navigate his favorite online children's games.  And he has
&gt; mastered all mouse functions except cut&amp;paste (he can cut, but does
&gt; not see any point to paste).  He loves to drag things into the trash,
&gt; and use scrollbars.  He has typed letters on the computer since he was
&gt; 5 months old and has chosen the letters to type by name for over a
&gt; year now.  He can count to 10 and has begun simple addition and can
&gt; tell time.  Yet he has barely begun to write by hand.  One day I found
&gt; him tracing letters printed large size on a piece of paper.  He is
&gt; learning the alphabet song.

&gt; School isn't so much about learning in lockstep with other children as
&gt; about learning foundation skills before being presented with skills
&gt; that build on those foundations.  You may reject lockstep schooling,
&gt; but take care that you do not let your child skip learning necessary
&gt; foundations!

&gt; To decide if you want to homeschool, try starting now at shadowing his
&gt; teachers' work with him.  Ie, know what he is learning now, how well
&gt; it is going, and think ahead.  What should your child be learning a
&gt; few weeks from now, a few months from now?  What techniques and
&gt; materials would you use to teach him?  Are there any holes in his
&gt; education now?  It is work!  Have a work plan.
">

I don't actually need to decide if I want to homeschool. But I find it
interesting that the advice is to shadow the people who operate under an
educational philosophy that I don't agree with.

This is an area like bringing home a new baby. People give the strangest
advice. I got one piece of advice from a veteran homeschooler. Just as when
your MIL would remind you don't forget to dress the baby warm, when someone
advises you with a no kidding piece of advice just msile and nod. I finally
did get used to doing that when the kids were small. It will take some time
to develop that skill with this topic. That is to say, no kidding it is work
and needs a plan!

Anyway thanks for you comments. Sorry if I am a tad snarky today.

Not that I plan to use this particular model, but have you ever heard of
unschooling? They don't use any currriculum. Formal definitely means things
that I won't be doing unless the kids need or want it for their success. We
are not going to have Math Monday and Literacy Tuesday from 9:00-10:30, for
example. At this time we are looking at a democratic team created
curriculum. That sort of thing.

&gt;&gt; &gt; This is a pretty common G/T profile. A lot of GT kids really dislike
&gt;&gt; &gt; writing
&gt;&gt; &gt; because their brains are working faster than their bodies, and many
&gt;&gt; &gt; have
&gt;&gt; &gt; some fine motor delays as well. I've heard a lot of different diagnosis
&gt;&gt; &gt; (mild CP, Dysgraphia, Hypotonia), but pretty much it leads to a kid who
&gt;&gt; &gt; can
&gt;&gt; &gt; read well, talk the hind leg of a donkey, but can't complete worksheets
&gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt; class legibly to save their lives.

&gt;&gt; What is &quot;G/T?&quot;

&gt; Gifted/Talented-IE, IQ above 130 on most standardized assessments, usually
&gt; performing at least 2 years above chronological age in at least one (often
&gt; multiple) areas.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The best suggestion I can give? Start him typing now, and if you have
&gt;&gt; &gt; insurance which will cover it, get an OT referral because learning how
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; make letters with less fuss will help him get his ideas on paper.

&gt;&gt; Talk to the doc about getting him occupational therapy at home? Sorry if
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; am being dense.
&gt; An occupational therapist can see what he's doing, and give you ideas as
&gt; to
&gt; what will work best for him. I fit this profile, and the best thing which
&gt; ever happened to me (at 5th grade, when I could easily handle college
&gt; level
&gt; work, but was writing like a kindergartener) was that an OT sat down with
&gt; me
&gt; and basically helped me create my own script handwriting from scratch,
&gt; putting together strokes which worked for me into a very distinctive, but
&gt; legible, script. It will never be considered &quot;great&quot; handwriting, but I
&gt; can
&gt; do it over time without fatiguing too much and it's readable-and that,
&gt; coupled with typing and computers getting smaller, made a major difference
&gt; academically. I believe Writing without Tears was developed by an
&gt; occupational therapist.

&gt; If you can get a medical referral, most insurance plans will pay for a few
&gt; sessions of OT, and if you're willing to follow through at home, that's
&gt; likely to be all it will take to make life much, much easier for him. It's
&gt; not just &quot;not able to meet school's expectations&quot;, but &quot;able to meet his
&gt; own
&gt; expectations&quot;.
">

Absolutely. My hope is to help him meet his expectations with a minimum of
stress.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It is very frustrating to have ideas in your brain and to
&gt; want to get them on paper and be unable to do it.

I asked him how he would feel if I was able to find a fun and helpful way to
learn to write and be able to get thoughts down. He almost jumped out of his
chair. We'll see if the Handwriting Without Tears helps. I will reread your
recommendations too since my brain is not processing them all the way.

&gt; OT should be provided by the school system, but in general, kids who are
&gt; on
&gt; or above grade level academically won't get such services without a
&gt; medical
&gt; diagnosis which automatically qualifies them for said services, and in
&gt; most
&gt; cases, MDs are moving away from the more blanket diagnosis (like mild
&gt; cerebral palsy, which is a qualifying label since IDEA was authorized) to
&gt; the more specific (like hypotonia or athetosis, both of which, 20 years
&gt; ago,
&gt; would have been considered forms of CP, and as stand alone labels, qualify
&gt; the child for absolutely nothing).

&gt; I have a very early reader myself, who dearly wants to write. So far,
&gt; she's
&gt; pretty satisfied to &quot;read&quot; her scribbles to me and to dictate to me, spell
&gt; words with magnetic letters, and the like, but if she starts showing signs
&gt; of really needing to write, either for her purposes or for outside ones,
&gt; the first thing I'll be doing is trying to get an OT's input on what to do
&gt; next.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, usually such kids won't qualify for special ed support
&gt;&gt; &gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt; school (even though a child with a lower functioning level and similar
&gt;&gt; &gt; difficulties would be able to get scribing or adaptive technology
&gt; support)
&gt;&gt; &gt; because they're performing on or above grade level-the fact that they
&gt;&gt; &gt; SHOULD
&gt;&gt; &gt; be able to perform much higher is irrelevant from the school system's
&gt; POV.

My mom and my dad were both natural teachers, but I can see that it

had to make me learn the things that were hard for me.  I was my own

Most of teaching is simply teaching and has nothing to do with

Why not?  Structure often is helpful.  If you intend to teach, then
you will have to do some focussed preparation and it is wasteful (at
best) to prepare to teach something and then not teach it.  Or teach
it days or weeks later, when the details have faded.  And if you
intend to participate in a co-op, I can guarantee there *will* be a
schedule exactly like what you claim you are not going to have.

&gt; A little background. My son, now 6, was never into coloring and &quot;drawing&quot;

&gt; abstract compared to his peers. He HATES writing. He is awkward with the
&gt; pencil in his hands. He labors mightily over letters.

&gt; He is currently in public school, at least for the remainder of this year. I
&gt; don't, personally, beleive that someone needs to learn a skill on someone
&gt; else's timeline. So if I succeed at bringing him home to homeschool (as in
&gt; if I prove to myself and my husband that we can make it on his salary!) I
&gt; will focus on bringing the joy back into expressing oneself on paper before
&gt; I proceed to looking into writing.

&gt; That said, writing is an important skill. If he does wind up in first grade
&gt; next year, they do a lot of writing says DS's kindergarten teacher. So if
&gt; there was a way to encourage writing success, perhaps I should look into it.
&gt; I would not be surprised, though I don't know for certain, that his dislike
&gt; of writing is linked tohis lack of success. When he was little, he was never
&gt; into process as they are supposed to be in the toddler and preschool years.
&gt; He was always frustrated when he could not draw a perfect representation of
&gt; whatever he wanted. I think that persists.

&gt; Anyway does anyone have anything to say about Handwriting Without Tears? I
&gt; saw reference to it in one of the homeschool curricula I was looking at. I
&gt; see mixed reviews on the amazon site. Anyone have any other thougths about
&gt; anything related to writing for me?

I'd have him evaluated for dysgraphia.  If he has it,
then some occupational therapy might be in order.  There's a
big difference between being just a bit behind the curve or
not liking writing very much and having a situation where
your brain and muscles are wired so as to make it particularly
difficult for you.

Where do you get this impression?  I asked a fairly reasonable question

about the difficulties he will have next year. Interesting.

&gt;&gt; A little background. My son, now 6, was never into coloring and &quot;drawing&quot;
&gt;&gt; back when he was little. I noted it then. I notice now that he does draw
&gt;&gt; and try to express himself on paper, but his drawings are way simple and
&gt;&gt; abstract compared to his peers. He HATES writing. He is awkward with the
&gt;&gt; pencil in his hands. He labors mightily over letters.

&gt;&gt; He is currently in public school, at least for the remainder of this
&gt;&gt; year. I don't, personally, beleive that someone needs to learn a skill on
&gt;&gt; someone else's timeline. So if I succeed at bringing him home to
&gt;&gt; homeschool (as in if I prove to myself and my husband that we can make it
&gt;&gt; on his salary!) I will focus on bringing the joy back into expressing
&gt;&gt; oneself on paper before I proceed to looking into writing.

&gt;&gt; That said, writing is an important skill. If he does wind up in first
&gt;&gt; grade next year, they do a lot of writing says DS's kindergarten teacher.
&gt;&gt; So if there was a way to encourage writing success, perhaps I should look
&gt;&gt; into it. I would not be surprised, though I don't know for certain, that
&gt;&gt; his dislike of writing is linked tohis lack of success. When he was
&gt;&gt; little, he was never into process as they are supposed to be in the
&gt;&gt; toddler and preschool years. He was always frustrated when he could not
&gt;&gt; draw a perfect representation of whatever he wanted. I think that
&gt;&gt; persists.

&gt;&gt; Anyway does anyone have anything to say about Handwriting Without Tears?
&gt;&gt; I saw reference to it in one of the homeschool curricula I was looking
&gt;&gt; at. I see mixed reviews on the amazon site. Anyone have any other
&gt;&gt; thougths about anything related to writing for me?

Very unlikely. The symptoms just aren''t the same.  I really think he is

His earlier pediatricians didn't clue in either,
even though I thought they were quite good at what they did.
Sad to say, but most look for kids who are doing poorly in
school as their indicator that there's something that needs
looking into.  Very bright kids can compensate in many ways,
so they keep carrying on and finding a way to do well in
school, but it comes at a significant cost to them.  As
Donna mentioned elsewhere, if they're not failing or performing
below grade level, it is common to assume there's no problem.
DS2 has had issues with reading, and while his teachers and
the principal were understanding, pretty much everyone agreed
that we wouldn't have a prayer qualifying for special ed.
services because despite the millstone around his neck, he
was still performing above grade level.  So, we had to work
in other ways to deal with his reading issues.  Similarly,
with DS1's writing (and other) issues, they didn't really
get anxious about his performance because overall, he was
compensating.  It was just that homework became agony every
night, when the teachers weren't there to see.
Anyway, my point is that when you get into the
issues of the "twice gifted," an awful lot of people just
don't have the knowledge and experience to provide much
guidance.  You have to be the one to assess whether or not
it's necessary to get an evaluation.  That's hard to figure
out.  Sometimes it *is* just age and maturity, and it gets
fixed admirably with Tincture of Time.  On the other hand,
there are consequences to ignoring an issue that causes
a child to be out of phase with himself developmentally--
and it can be especially frustrating to a child who is
very bright and keenly aware of the gap between what he
*wants* to do and what he can make his body do.
I totally understand where you are.  I've sung
that song myself.  I never wanted to be the pushy parent
whose little prince had to always be the best and the
brightest in everything.  The consequence of that has
been that I've been slow to get my children help for
things that have been frustrating *for them*.  I kept
saying they'd get there in their own sweet time, and
we could all be patient.  While I still agree with that
to some extent, I now also see that it's not just about
external expectations.  It's also about *internal*
expectations.  When they're out of balance with themselves,
they find that frustrating, regardless of what others
expect of them.
It could certainly be the case that your son
is just a bit of a late bloomer with the writing.
Nevertheless, if there *is* an underlying issue,
waiting doesn't necessarily do him any favors.  It
just mean the gap widens between what he thinks and
what he can express--a gap that is already larger
than usual in many gifted kids.

Ericka

Well, it could in that dysgraphia *is*, in part,
a cognitive difficulty which is expressed by difficulty
writing (or writing legibly).  It doesn't mean that he

I think HWT is excellent especially for tactile learners.

One thing that helps children with writing is using short pencils
(golf pencils work well) or using pencil grips that are sold in
various places.  With crayons too, it is actually helpful to break
them into a shorter piece.  The shorter writing utensils encourage the
proper grip and make it easier to control the pencil or crayon.

Another activity that is fun for kids that helps fine motor control is
having you write a letter or sentence in chalk on a chalkboard and
having the child erase it using water on his finger.  Promotes
learning the writing by making the letter disappear.

&gt; &gt;&gt;A little background. My son, now 6, was never into coloring and &quot;drawing&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;back when he was little. I noted it then. I notice now that he does draw
&gt; &gt;&gt;and try to express himself on paper, but his drawings are way simple and
&gt; &gt;&gt;abstract compared to his peers. He HATES writing. He is awkward with the
&gt; &gt;&gt;pencil in his hands. He labors mightily over letters.

&gt; &gt; These are red flags to me. He may have a disability.

&gt; &gt; If he is having trouble with the mechanics of drawing and writing,
&gt; &gt; interventions to help him with his fine motor skills may really help him.
&gt; &gt; In addition, maybe he should be typing instead of writing.

&gt; &gt; I wonder if he is on a different cognitive level than his peers. Special
&gt; &gt; education may help him.

&gt; Yes. He is definitely on a different cognitive level than his peers. Most of
&gt; his peers are working on letter recognition. DS reads very well. Most of his
&gt; peers (kindergarten) are working on number recognition, counting, AB
&gt; patterns, sorting. DS is working on multi-digit addition and multiplication.

It sounds like you already talked to the school about it, but if you
haven't formally requested testing it might be useful.  Particularly
if his skills in one area are dramatically out of step with his skills
in other areas it's worth seeing if there's any neuropsych (ie, brain-
wiring) reason for it.  I'm not sure how much of my knowledge is state-
specific, but at least in California the school district is
responsible for doing such testing on anyone above age three whether
or not they're enrolled in public school, though I suspect
logistically it would probably be easier to do it while he's still in
public school.  If you send a written request for evaluation they're
obligated to do it within a certain time frame regardless of his
overall academic performance.  You could just wait and see or try
another curriculum first but I'm not sure I see the downside of a free
evaluation that carries no obligation to do anything in particular.

Does he hold the pencil correctly, sit properly etc?  Has the teacher had a
look at what he's doing?  Boys are sometimes a bit slower to pick up writing
than girls, but the teacher should have a handle on what is in the normal
range.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He is currently in public school, at least for the remainder of this year. I
&gt; don't, personally, beleive that someone needs to learn a skill on someone
&gt; else's timeline. So if I succeed at bringing him home to homeschool (as in
&gt; if I prove to myself and my husband that we can make it on his salary!) I
&gt; will focus on bringing the joy back into expressing oneself on paper before
&gt; I proceed to looking into writing. [...]
&gt; I would not be surprised, though I don't know for certain, that his dislike
&gt; of writing is linked tohis lack of success. When he was little, he was never
&gt; into process as they are supposed to be in the toddler and preschool years.
&gt; He was always frustrated when he could not draw a perfect representation of
&gt; whatever he wanted. I think that persists.
">

Well, I don't quite know what that means.  If he can't write and draw to his
own satisfaction, the joy might be a long time in coming.  What I mean is:
could his slowness be simply due to perfectionism, which is common in gifted
children?

&gt;&gt;Anyway does anyone have anything to say about Handwriting Without Tears? I
&gt;&gt;saw reference to it in one of the homeschool curricula I was looking at. I
&gt;&gt;see mixed reviews on the amazon site. Anyone have any other thougths about
&gt;&gt;anything related to writing for me?

&gt; I think HWT is excellent especially for tactile learners.

&gt; One thing that helps children with writing is using short pencils
&gt; (golf pencils work well) or using pencil grips that are sold in
&gt; various places.  With crayons too, it is actually helpful to break
&gt; them into a shorter piece.  The shorter writing utensils encourage the
&gt; proper grip and make it easier to control the pencil or crayon.

One of my kids' teachers (can't remember which one) had him use those rubber
grip things on the pencil to help him hold it in the proper place, and to
prevent him from having the "death grip" on the pencil. Kids that can't
write well often experience real pain in their hands from gripping the
pencil. She also let him use a pen, the ink gliding over the paper makes
writing easier than using a graphite pencil.

My three boys ( 17, 13, 9) all have *awful* handwriting, always did, always
will I suppose, like my husband does.  The youngest has the best, but he's a
lefty, which has it's own problems.
I think this is a skill that comes much later to boys, and they don't seem
to care about it as much as girls do - I'm 42 and I still take care to have
nice handwriting!
As my boys progressed through the grades in school it became much less
important - their handwriting hasn't gotten appreciably better , but they
are no longer graded on it. It's just something they have to suffer through,
I guess, until they are able to use computers to write all their
assignments.

Interestingly, the only men I know personally that have lovely handwriting
are my dad (also a lefty) and my boss, and they both have engineering
degrees.
