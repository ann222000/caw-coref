Infosys' chairman and CEO N R Narayana Murthy had the rare privilege of
being the first Indian speaker to address the MBA graduates of the Wharton
School at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, on Sunday. Going
down memory lane, Murthy recalled how he and his six dedicated co-founders
built a truly global Indian software company right from the scratch.

Recalling the lessons he had learnt from founding Infosys with a team of
talented colleagues and managing it during the last 20 years, Murthy said
while the experiment was conducted in far-away, less market-oriented India,
he believed that the fundamental lessons he had learnt have broader
applicability.

Excerpts:

&quot;As I look upon your bright and confident faces, my mind goes back to a
sultry, fateful morning in July 1981, to my meeting with the other six
founders of Infosys. The seven of us had forsaken -- at least as it then
appeared to our friends and families -- safe and promising corporate
careers.

&quot;We were huddled together in a small room in Bombay in the hope of creating
a brighter future for ourselves, for the Indian society and, perhaps, we
dreamed, even for the world.

&quot;Confidence, commitment, passion, hope, energy, enthusiasm, and the capacity
for hard work were available in plenty. However, money was in short supply.
We struggled to put together a princely sum of $250 as our initial seed
capital. We were helped in this by our ever-enthusiastic bankers - our
generous wives!

&quot;Our enthusiasm can be expressed in the words of Eleanor Roosevelt who said:
'The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams'.

&quot;We knew our dream had to be based on a lofty vision, something larger than
ourselves. Our vision was and is to be a globally respected software
corporation providing best-in-class business solutions employing
best-of-breed professionals.

&quot;I have realised, over the years, that a powerful vision expressed as a
simple sentence, capturing the core of our values and aspirations, enthuses
generation after generation of employees in the company.

&quot;The beauty of a simple yet powerful vision is that it is easy to
understand, to communicate, to share, and to move towards.

&quot;We built Infosys on three key concepts -- the criticality of customised
software in creating competitive advantage for a corporation, globalisation
and professionalisation of the corporation.

&quot;Every successful company is built on an idea that is taken seriously in the
marketplace.

&quot;For this, an idea has to achieve one or more of the following: improve
customer satisfaction, reduce cost, reduce cycle time, improve productivity,
increase customer base, or improve comfort level of customers.

&quot;Strategy, an important building block of success, is all about becoming
unique in a marketplace. This requires that every corporation build this
uniqueness into its business rules and models.

&quot;These rules and models become embedded in the information systems of the
company. Thus, there was, is and will be considerable opportunity in
creating customised software.

&quot;While we had a good idea, the market for the idea did not exist in India.
Thus, we had to embrace globalisation. I believe globalisation is about
sourcing capital from where it is cheapest, producing where it is most
cost-effective, and selling where it is most profitable, all without being
constrained by national boundaries.

&quot;When we founded the company, we knew that India, with its vast pool of
English-speaking, analytically strong technical talent, and the excellent
work ethic among its professionals, had the essential ingredients for global
success in customized software development.

&quot;Thus, our idea was to produce software in India for clients in the G-7
countries. Our approach, while distinctive, was far from unique; companies
in industries such as textiles and semi-conductors were following similar
strategies.

&quot;Since we co-founders had been professionals before we started Infosys, we
wanted to build a company of professionals, for professionals and run by
professionals, to borrow the words of President Abraham Lincoln who used
them to describe the US democracy.

&quot;Accordingly, it was our belief that the first duty of a corporation is to
uphold respect and dignity for the individual. Right from day one, we
eschewed any transaction that created asymmetry of benefits between the
founder-employees and other employees.

&quot;Our core corporate assets walk out every evening, mentally and physically
tired. It is our duty to make sure that these assets return well rested,
energetic and enthusiastic the next morning.

&quot;Our respect for our professionals can be summed by our belief that the
market capitalisation of Infosys becomes zero after working hours end at
5pm, no matter what it was during the day.

&quot;A strong team is essential for every successful entrepreneurial experiment
to succeed. A strong team brings together a set of complementary skills,
expertise and experience.

&quot;Today, the venture capitalists backing entrepreneurs help create such teams
by connecting them with prospective key-employee-networks.

&quot;However, in those days, we did not have any VCs in India. We ourselves had
to bring together people who had some experience in human resources,
finance, strategy, technology, project management, software development, and
sales and marketing.

&quot;In addition to complementary skills, it is essential that the team operates
on a common value system and maintains the dignity and respect of every
individual in every transaction. The motto for workplace interactions at
Infosys has always been: You can disagree with me as long as you are not
disagreeable.

&quot;During the initial days, we faced tremendous challenges attempting to do
business in India. To illustrate, it took us a year to obtain a telephone
connection; two years to get a license to import a computer, and 15 days to
get foreign currency for travel abroad.

&quot;Thus, the first 10 years of our marathon seemed interminable and
frustrating. Although we managed to keep our heads above water, we were
floundering.

&quot;However, the positive aspect of these years was that we learned to plough
through adversity, and, I hope, we became better managers and better human
beings.

&quot;The fuel that kept us going was our passion to make a difference. Even
today, I believe that our passion is more important than our finances.

&quot;Louis Pasteur once said: Chance favors the prepared mind. Thus, as we were
struggling along, the Indian economic reforms of 1991 came as a heaven-sent
opportunity for us at Infosys.

&quot;These watershed reforms -- likened by some to the winning of economic
freedom, on the lines of the securing of political freedom from British rule
in 1947 -- changed the Indian business context from one of state-centered,
control orientation to a free, open market orientation, at least for hi-tech
companies.

&quot;We, at Infosys, leveraged the positives of liberalization, the opening up
of the Indian economy, and we have never looked back.

&quot;In fact, I take quiet pride in how Infosys has become a shining example of
all the good that came out of India's economic reform process. The lesson
from the Indian experience is a clear clarion call for all that is willing
to listen: free trade can bring great benefits to society.

&quot;Now, I will elaborate on some key lessons that we have learned from
managing Infosys over the last 20 years. I believe that most of these
lessons, while rooted in the Infosys' experience are valid in start-ups as
well as in large corporations all over the world.

&quot;The great American civil rights leader Dr Martin Luther King Jr. once
remarked: 'The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments
of comfort, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy'.

&quot;A company's value system is the guiding light in its hours of darkness,
confusion and self-doubt, and when faced with moral dilemma.

&quot;A value system builds confidence, provides peace of mind, and enhances
energy and enthusiasm during trials and tribulations.

&quot;The importance you attach to your value system is reflected in the cost you
are willing to incur for your beliefs and convictions. Thus, the more
profound one's commitment to a value system, the greater is the cost one is
willing to incur to defend the value system.

&quot;At Infosys, we have had several instances when our value system was
severely tested. These events occurred in our dealings not only in India,
but also the world over, including the US.

&quot;In every incident, we were firm and stood by our values because we knew
that taking short cuts that compromise our values would be suicidal for us.

&quot;As we run the marathon that we have embarked upon, our value system is what
binds the team together and is something that can never be compromised.

&quot;Our value system at Infosys can be captured in one sentence: The softest
pillow is a clear conscience. We try constantly to live up to this standard.
We only act in ways that will let us sleep peacefully every night.

&quot;Every company has to recognise its strategic resources, and ensure their
long-term supply. In our case, human intellect, technology and processes are
the three key strategic resources.

&quot;We operate in a domain where customer preferences and technology change
rapidly, and business models, paradigms, and rules quickly become obsolete.
Thus, the only constant for us is change.

&quot;These days, the world moves so fast that often one who says that something
cannot be done is proved wrong by another person who is already doing it.

&quot;Our success at Infosys depends on our ability to recognise, learn and
assimilate these changes quickly, and on bringing business value to our
customers by leveraging the assimilated knowledge.

&quot;Thus, 'learnability' is critical for us. We define learnability as the
ability to extract generic inferences from specific instances and using them
in new, unstructured situations. Our company has always placed a premium
upon recruiting people with a high learnability quotient.

&quot;In fact, the implicit belief at Infosys is that each person should surround
himself or herself with much smarter people.

&quot;Such an environment creates competition and confidence, and leads to energy
and enthusiasm. We provide these people with up-to-date technology and a
strong foundation in processes.

&quot;Infosys' longevity will depend on how well we build on our people
resources.

&quot;The biggest challenge for a knowledge company like Infosys is to recruit,
enable, empower, and retain the best and the brightest talent. We realised
long ago that we had to make a compelling value proposition to our
employees, much the same as we did for our customers.

&quot;Speed, imagination and excellence in execution are the three time-invariant
and context-invariant attributes of a successful corporation. In fact, speed
in imagination is the most critical success factor.

&quot;Never before in history has imagination played a more significant role than
it does today. As the power of incumbency keeps diminishing, the importance
of imagination keeps increasing.

&quot;The constant challenge is to move from information to insight. The future
winners will be those firms that escape from the gravitational pull of the
past on the fuel of innovation.

&quot;The task of the CEO is to ensure that the corporation embraces and uses
speed, imagination and excellence of execution in every aspect of its
operation. This implies that every corporation has to create incentives for
people to be innovative at all times.

&quot;The best incentive for innovation is proactive obsolescence by wide
dissemination. Such a proactive step helps a corporation be in control of
obsolescence, and remain a leader in its field.

&quot;Obsolescence of a firm's innovations by its competitors will generally take
it by surprise and find the firm unprepared. Such unprepared corporations
are the foster children of missed opportunities and will not survive.

&quot;We have realised over the years that solutions to most of our problems lie
within ourselves.

&quot;Rationalisation of failure is simply a sign of weakness. The easiest way to
escape from accountability is to blame reality. It renders people and
nations apathetic and justifies inaction. Leaders, on the other hand,
transform reality from what it is to what they want it to be.

&quot;The main fuel of achievement comes from aspirations that are higher than
the status quo.

&quot;Leadership, therefore, is all about raising the aspirations of followers.
It is about making people believe in themselves; it is about making them
confident; and it is about making people achieve miracles.

&quot;Leadership is about dreaming the impossible and helping followers achieve
them. Lofty aspirations build great firms, great countries and great
civilizations.

&quot;The best form of leadership is leadership by example. In a knowledge
company whose core competencies include human intellect and learning through
a process of observation, data collection, analysis and conclusion, leaders
have to walk the talk.

&quot;In this global age, given the path breaking impact of the Internet on
business practices, leaders in the business world can come from anywhere.

&quot;Competition is global, all the more so in the world of digital products and
services. The best ideas or business models will dominate, regardless of
their national origins. It is in this competitive global regime that the
best hopes and aspirations of my country of origin, India, rest.

&quot;It goes without saying that many challenges lie ahead, but I am sanguine
about the future role that India, and other human-resource-rich countries
such as China, will play in the global knowledge economy.

&quot;A well-run corporation embraces and practises a sound
predictability-sustainability-profitability-de-risking model. We call this
the PSPD model at Infosys.

&quot;A good forecasting system for sales based on data gathered from the
trenches ensures predictability (although predictability of costs is also
needed to have predictable profit streams).

&quot;Sustainability is achieved by energetic and motivated sales people who
pound the pavement and make sales happen; by production people ensuring that
quality products are delivered to the customer on time; and by billing and
collecting on time.

&quot;Every enterprise must focus on high profitability in order to ensure the
best returns for its shareholders. Indeed, the long-term success of a
corporation depends on having a model that scales up profitably.

&quot;Finally, the corporation must have a good de-risking approach that
recognizes, measures and mitigates risk along every dimension.

&quot;The Degree of Affordable Risk is a composite measure of the risk threshold
of a corporation. Every corporation must measure its DAR, constantly improve
its DAR, and operate within the limits of its DAR.

&quot;Having emphasised the importance of de-risking, I must hasten to add that I
do not, even for a moment, want to dissuade you from taking risks. Take
risks you must, but carefully thought-out risks.

&quot;We know that ships are safest in the harbor. But, they are not meant to be
there. The best ships are destined to ply the wide oceans, to brave the
stormy, heavy seas.

&quot;What is needed is to cross the oceans and finally return to the welcome
safety of the port with the comfort of a destination achieved.

&quot;Another lesson that is anchored in the Infosys experience concerns
governance. Corporate governance is focused on maximizing shareholder value
while ensuring fairness to all the stakeholders - customers, employees,
vendor-partners, the government of the land, and society at large.

&quot;In these days of free flowing global capital, the ability to attract
capital requires that corporations adhere to the best global standards of
corporate governance.

&quot;Studies have shown a significant correlation between the standards of
corporate governance of a firm and its cost of capital. The foundation of
our corporate governance philosophy at Infosys is the belief that it is
better to lose a billion dollars than to act in ways that make one lose a
night's sleep.

&quot;We also believe that it is a good practice to under-promise and
over-deliver. Further, it is best to deliver the bad news to the
stakeholders proactively and at the earliest.

&quot;This creates goodwill with all the stakeholders. They fully understand that
there inevitably will be ups and downs in every business. What they value,
however, is for managements to level with them at all times.

&quot;Quick progress comes in an environment that respects competence, where
there is healthy competition and where there are no prejudices.

&quot;Infoscions, the name by which we call all our employees, have a sense of
respect for our competitors, a healthy sense of paranoia that keeps us on
our toes, and a sense of humility about what we have achieved.

&quot;We remember that success is, generally, ephemeral. We remember that we are
only as good as the results of our last quarter. We fully believe that we
are running a marathon, not a sprint; and our strategies and policies
reflect that.

&quot;One of my strongest beliefs is that corporations have an important duty to
contribute to society.

&quot;While, on average, tremendous progress has been made in enhancing the
economic well being of people, the chasm between the haves and the have-nots
of the world has unfortunately widened, especially in the developing world.

&quot;No corporation can sustain its progress unless it makes a difference to its
context. In the end, unless we can wipe the tears from the eyes of every
poor man, woman and child on this planet, I do not think any dream is a
worthy one.

&quot;As I see you assembled here, I am filled with hope for the future. I have
no doubt that you - coming from the best business school in the most
progressive country in the world -- will put your shoulders to the wheel to
make a better world for yourselves, for all others around you and, indeed,
for all of humanity.

&quot;The eyes of the world are upon you. The world will expect nothing less from
you, for you are the chosen few.

&quot;Let me now share a few words of personal advice with you based on my life
experience. First, I want to emphasise the importance of being trustworthy
with all in your dealings. It is on such foundations that great
organisations are created.

&quot;Secondly, fear is natural, but do not let your actions totally be governed
by it. Just as fear may sometimes be the hidden voice of your intuition
alerting you to what your rational mind may not yet have seen, it is also
sometimes an invitation to explore a new part of yourself and the world.

&quot;Thirdly, a supportive family is the bedrock upon which satisfying lives and
careers are built. Create a support system for yourself with people who will
rejoice in your success and be there for you.

&quot;With this rock like support behind you, you can endure almost anything in
your career.

&quot;Fourthly, learn how to manage yourself, especially your feelings in a way
that respects the dignity of others and yourself. I have found it helpful to
separate the merits and demerits of a decision from the accompanying
feelings. We call this 'being transaction oriented' at Infosys.

&quot;Finally, live your life and lead your career in a way that makes a
difference to your society.&quot;

On the occasion, Murthy was also awarded the Wharton Dean's Medal by Wharton
School Dean Patrick Harker, for his contributions to the enlargement of the
global economy, and to the improvement in the lives of people worldwide.
