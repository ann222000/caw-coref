Phil Spector gave an interview after his indictment by the grand jury on
September 27, 2004. In this interview he stated that &quot;actions of the Hitler
like District Attorney, Steve Cooley, and his Stormtrooping henchmen, to
seek an indictment against me, and censor all means of getting my evidence
and the truth out, are reprehensible, unconscionable, and despicable.&quot; In
his opening statement Cutler also roared to the jury that these
stormtrooping henchmen &quot;stormed the castle, quite literally and
figuratively&quot;. Today we had a witness on the stand who explained exactly
what those stormtrooping henchmen did when they entered Spector's home on
the night Lana Clarkson was shot.
But before the henchman, James Hammond, takes the stand, we have to finish
our Pie.

And I finally figured out why Pie seems a little uneven on the stand,
sometimes lucid, clear and self assured, and sometimes foggy, hazy and
confused. It becomes clear today that when she is asked questions that have
been gone over with her by the Defense, she &quot;knows&quot; the answers and what is
expected of her and she is able to appear at least sane. When someone hits
her with a question that is meant to elicit something that she has not been
forewarned about, she gets extremely rattled, because she doesn't know how
she is supposed to answer.

This is best illustrated today when Alan Jackson asks Pie about a statement
that she allegedly made at the wedding reception of Ann Marie Donahue. At
this reception, someone has reported to the prosecution that she was
overheard to say to Rick Brody &quot;We need to fry that bastard for killing
Lana&quot;. She denies making the statement, and tells Jackson that it doesn't
sound like something she would say because &quot;I didn't believe that.&quot; On
re-direct Rosen asks her to elaborate on what she meant when she said &quot;I
didn't believe that.&quot;

And because this is obviously a question she hasn't been prepped on, and she
doesn't know exactly what he wants her to say, she responds by asking him
&quot;Can we move to another question?&quot;

Judge Fidler, obviously fed up with Pie, rebukes her sternly and tells her
she must answer the questions as they are asked. Rosen, sensing that she
doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about, wisely moves to another, more
prepped area of inquiry, that of her deference to Ann Marie Donahue, her
father the lawyer, and why Pie decided that she should do as Ann Marie
suggested and lie to the first officers who visited her after Lana died.

She again explains that this was all out of loyalty to her friend Lana, and
her fear and confusion. Although neither side questions her about why her
fear and confusion would allow a seemingly innocent man, if what she
believed to be true was , in fact, true, to be apprehended and charged with
murder.

Rosen then wraps up the Pie by asking her if what she has said on the stand
has been the truth, and she says :yes it is&quot;. Jackson then gets up and
reminds her that this truth, of course, is a different truth than what she
told the first officers.

Next we have the stormtrooping henchmen, James Hammond, who was a police
officer for the City of Alhambra, now a detective. He went to 1700 Grandview
in the early morning hours of February 3rd. He testifies about the 5
officers who responded to the initial call for assistance, and explains how
an Officer Cardella, who was watching the rear entrance of Spector's
residence for any signs of movement or occupancy, radioed that he saw
movement in the area and the other officers all gathered in the back
courtyard near the parking area and the fountain. Hammond testified that the
officers identified themselves to Spector, who was standing on the porch
area with his arms crossed. They instructed him to raise his hands and move
towards them, and Spector raised his hands and then immediately put them in
his pockets. He then said to the police officers &quot;You've got to come and see
this&quot;, a phrase that got all the attorneys to a sidebar.

Hammond described Spector's expressions as &quot;blank, emotionless and
unresponsive&quot;. Rosen tried to get the witness to testify that Spector was
&quot;dazed and confused&quot; but all Hammond would say was &quot;blank and emotionless&quot; -
and unresponsive to the officer's instructions.

Spector then turned and went into the house. Hammond testified that since
the responding officers did not know how many people at the scene could be
victims - or suspects, that the commanding officer on the scene decided to
elevate the officer's position and level of protection and he armed himself
with a ballistic shield and a taser gun. Hammond said that they also
requested a canine unit, but that one was not available.

The officers made a flank behind the lead officer, who was armed with the
shield, and they rushed the entrance to the foyer. They tasered Spector,
which was unsuccessful, as one of the contact leads did not penetrate, a
situation that happens perhaps 60% of the time, according to this witness.
This also contradicts Cutler's opening statement, wherein he referred to the
fact that the stormtrooping henchmen stormed the castle and &quot;fired a
dangerous taser gun&quot; at Spector. I don't think that a taser gun is
necessarily dangerous if the leads don't even penetrate the suspect.

This scenario does, though, bolster the testimony of prosecution witness
Michael Brown, who testified &quot;I saw the barbs of the Taser clipped into his
shirt ... the Taser barbs were not attached to the skin,&quot;

Hammond then went on to describe how the officers on the scene immediately
tried to control Spector, and that the lead officer pushed Spector towards
the stairs and knocked him to the ground, where Hammond and the lead officer
each grabbed one of Spector's arms to get him into a position to cuff him.
Hammond says that the officers then did a search of the residence to ensure
there were no other victims or suspects in the house.

Alan Jackson brought out on Cross examination that if Spector had complied
with the officer's instructions that no force would have been necessary and
that none of these tactics, such as the taser gun would have been used if
Spector had cooperated with the police and not resisted arrest. Hammond
agreed that this was true.

Hammond also testified that when the officer's entered the house that none
of them disturbed the body of Lana Clarkson, that none of them moved the gun
from its initial position that he noted it was in when they entered the
house - he made a note in his report that the gun was under her left calf.

During the break the judge explains on the record the contents of an in
camera hearing held yesterday. He informs the court that he has received a
sealed proffer from the defense as to the body of testimony they would like
one Baby Dol Gibson to give to the jury. We know that what she wants to say
is that Lana was a high class hooker in her stable of girls, and that she
has a &quot;trick book&quot; which proves it. Although from all reports and pictures
of said trick book, it's obviously a doctored piece of crap. The judge
announces that *at this time* he has ruled that Miss Gibson's testimony is
inadmissible, irrelevant and without value. Unless future actions merit, she
will not be testifying. Also, since the proposed testimony is so
inflammatory and prejudicial to the prosecution and Lana and her family he
has sealed the proffer until the end of the trial.

The judge also announces that he has received reports that Baby Dol has been
emailing and reaching out to members of the press and has been giving
interviews despite the fact that she is still under subpoena. The judge
warns her, through her counsel who is present in the courtroom, that if she
continues to do so she will be subject to the appropriate penalties under
the law.

The defense then passes on calling the undercover officer - who was referred
to only as Officer Pee (as opposed to Pie), during Hammond's testimony. They
tell the court that Hammond was able to testify to all the things that Pee
would have testified to, so he is released from court.

Next to take the stand is Dan Anderson, who works for the coroner's office
as a toxicologist and criminalist. He testifies that although it is
certainly unusual for them to get a urine sample ante-mortem, they received
Phil Spector's urine sample in this case because the Alhambra department
could not handle the tests that they were asking the coroner's office to
perform. He tested Spector's urine for a long list of drugs that the
investigating officers determined that Spector had access to, including
opiates, cocaine, alcohol barbiturates and specific drugs that Spector had
prescriptions for.

Anderson reports that the tests were positive for Topiramate, a generic name
for Topomax, which he describes as an anti-seizure medication, as well as
Prozac, and that he wasn't able to test for the presence of Viagra, although
it was on the list of drugs he was requested to test for, since his lab
didn't have the capability at the time to do so.

Anderson then testifies about the toxicological screening done on Lana
Clarkson's blood sample - which screened for basically the same drugs as
screened for with Spector's urine sample. The testing found elevated levels
of Hydrocodone, commonly found in Vicodin , with a result of 0.7 micrograms
per milliliter. Testing also revealed that Lana's BAC was .12 from the heart
blood and .14 from her femoral blood.

On cross Jackson inquires as to Phil Spector's alcohol levels according to
the test done on his urine sample, and Anderson reports that it was .07%,
(and this test was taken 13 hours after the shooting). Although Anderson
warns that extrapolating backwards from sample to time of event occurrence
is never reliable and seldom done. (Although it doesn't stop me from doing
so.)

Next witness for the defense is Robert Alan Middleburg, another forensic
toxicologist and Laboratory

&gt;that this would be possible. Jackson also asks the witness about &quot;smelling
&gt;alcohol on someone's breath&quot; and the witness explains that what people are
&gt;really smelling when they say that someone &quot;smelled of alcohol&quot; is just the
&gt;actual drink, and that there are lots of non alcoholic drinks that can smell
&gt;like alcohol - and by the way, since Spector is diabetic, he can smell like
&gt;alcohol anyway, because of the ketones that diabetics naturally put out.
&gt;Which I think is bullshit, but I'm no expert.

Alas, this one is quite true. If you're a diabetic
and (draaticaly simplifying the process here...) your
blood sugar is way too high, and your body
starts breaking down other things because
it can't handle sugar, it produces ketones.

These accumulate in sweat, in urine, and in
the breath, and can easily be confused
with alcohol.

(Note that the stuff that goes in with
diabetics can be very, very, funky.).

&gt;Court will not be in session on Thursday again this week. Rosen likes
&gt;Thursday's off, for some reason. He wants the day off almost every Thursday.
&gt;I think that there's enough lawyers sitting at that table that if one of the
&gt;lawyers needs to be off, they can still continue. I mean, Cutler is off
&gt;filming his TV show and he says that he can keep up by watching Court TV, so
&gt;I don't know why Rosen feels that his presence is necessary.
&gt;There are rumors and murmurings that Henry Lee was supposed to testify this
&gt;Monday. I say &quot;fat chance&quot;. He isn't coming anywhere near this courtroom or
&gt;Judge Fidler ever again. Lee don't like people that mess with his reputation
&gt;or question his &quot;World Class&quot; status.

In some extreme cases, it isn't bullshit.  There are a number of
people who have been arrested as drunks, waving and stinking of
alcohol, who have been tossed into the drunk tank where they go into
diabetic coma and die.  But such people tend not to have &quot;impairment&quot;
levels of alcohol in their blood at the same time.  If someone has
high alcohol levels in his blood and stinks of alcohol, you can
probably dismiss diabetic coma.
