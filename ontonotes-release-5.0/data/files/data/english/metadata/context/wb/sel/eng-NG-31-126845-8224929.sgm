Iran is the new Nazi Germany and its president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
the new Hitler. Or so Israeli officials have been declaring for months
as they and their American allies try to persuade the doubters in
Washington that an attack on Tehran is essential. And if the latest
media reports are to be trusted, it looks like they may again be
winning the battle for hearts and minds: vice-president Dick Cheney is
said to be diverting the White House back on track to launch a
military strike.

Earlier this year Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's opposition leader and
the man who appears to be styling himself as scaremonger-in-chief,
told us: &quot;It's 1938 and Iran is Germany. And Iran is racing to arm
itself with atomic bombs.&quot; Of Ahmadinejad, he said: &quot;He is preparing
another Holocaust for the Jewish state.&quot;

A few weeks ago, as Israel's military intelligence claimed - as it has
been doing regularly since the early 1990s - that Iran is only a year
or so away from the &quot;point of no return&quot; on developing a nuclear
warhead, Netanyahu was at it again. &quot;Iran could be the first
undeterrable nuclear power,&quot; he warned, adding: &quot;This is a Jewish
problem like Hitler was a Jewish problem ... The future of the Jewish
people depends on the future of Israel.&quot;

But Netanyahu has been far from alone in making extravagant claims
about a looming genocide from Iran. Israel's new president, Shimon
Peres, has compared an Iranian nuclear bomb to a &quot;flying concentration
camp&quot;. And the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, told a German newspaper
last year: &quot;[Ahmadinejad] speaks as Hitler did in his time of the
extermination of the entire Jewish nation.&quot;

There is an interesting problem with selling the &quot;Iran as Nazi
Germany&quot; line. If Ahmadinejad really is Hitler, ready to commit
genocide against Israel's Jews as soon as he can get his hands on a
nuclear weapon, why are some 25,000 Jews living peacefully in Iran and
more than reluctant to leave, despite repeated enticements from Israel
and American Jews?

What is the basis for Israel's dire forecasts - the ideological
scaffolding being erected, presumably, to justify an attack on Iran?
Helpfully, as George Bush defended his Iraq policies last month, he
reminded us yet again of the menace Iran supposedly poses: it is
&quot;threatening to wipe Israel off the map&quot;.

This myth has been endlessly recycled since a translating error was
made of a speech Ahmadinejad delivered nearly two years ago. Farsi
experts have verified that the Iranian president, far from threatening
to destroy Israel, was quoting from an earlier speech by the late
Ayatollah Khomeini in which he reassured supporters of the
Palestinians that &quot;the Zionist regime in Jerusalem&quot; would &quot;vanish from
the page of time&quot;.

He was not threatening to exterminate Jews or even Israel. He was
comparing Israel's occupation of the Palestinians with other
illegitimate systems of rule whose time had passed, including the
Shahs who once ruled Iran, apartheid South Africa and the Soviet
empire. Nonetheless, this erroneous translation has survived and
prospered because Israel and her supporters have exploited it for
their own crude propaganda purposes.

In the meantime, the 25,000-strong Iranian Jewish community is the
largest in the Middle East outside Israel and traces its roots back
3,000 years. As one of several non-Muslim minorities in Iran, Jews
there suffer discrimination, but they are certainly no worse off than
the one million Palestinian citizens of Israel - and far better off
than Palestinians under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza.

Iranian Jews have little influence on decision-making and are not
allowed to hold senior posts in the army or bureaucracy. But they
enjoy many freedoms. They have an elected representative in
parliament, they practice their religion openly in synagogues, their
charities are funded by the Jewish diaspora, and they can travel
freely, including to Israel. In Tehran there are six kosher butchers
and about 30 synagogues. Ahmadinejad's office recently made a donation
to a Jewish hospital in Tehran.

As Ciamak Moresadegh, an Iranian Jewish leader, observed: &quot;If you
think Judaism and Zionism are one, it is like thinking Islam and the
Taliban are the same, and they are not.&quot; Iran's leaders denounce
Zionism, which they blame for fuelling discrimination against the
Palestinians, but they have also repeatedly avowed that they have no
problem with Jews, Judaism or even the state of Israel. Ahmadinejad,
caricatured as a merchant of genocide, has in fact called for &quot;regime
change&quot; - and then only in the sense that he believes a referendum
should be held of all inhabitants of Israel and the occupied
territories, including refugees from war, on the nature of the
government.

Despite the absence of any threat to Iran's Jews, the Israeli media
recently reported that the Israeli government has been trying to find
new ways to entice Iranian Jews to Israel. The Ma'ariv newspaper
pointed out that previous schemes had found few takers. There was,
noted the report, &quot;a lack of desire on the part of thousands of
Iranian Jews to leave&quot;. According to the New York-based Forward
newspaper, a campaign to persuade Iranian Jews to emigrate to Israel
caused only 152 out of these 25,000 Jews to leave Iran between October
2005 and September 2006, and most of them were said to have emigrated
for economic reasons, not political ones.

To step up these efforts - and presumably to avoid the embarrassing
incongruence of claiming Iran's genocidal intent while thousands of
Jews live happily in Tehran - Israel is now backing a move by Jewish
donors to guarantee every Iranian Jewish family $60,000 to settle in
Israel, in addition to a host of existing financial incentives that
are offered to Jewish immigrants, including loans and cheap
mortgages.

The announcement was met with scorn by the Society of Iranian Jews,
which issued a statement that their national identity was not for
sale. &quot;The identity of Iranian Jews is not tradeable for any amount of
money. Iranian Jews are among the most ancient Iranians. Iran's Jews
love their Iranian identity and their culture, so threats and this
immature political enticement will not achieve their aim of wiping out
the identity of Iranian Jews.&quot;

More important than the welfare of Iranian Jewish families, it seems,
is the value of Iranian Jews as a propaganda tool in Israel's battle
to persuade the world that coexistence with the Muslim world is
impossible. For those who want to engineer a clash of civilisations,
the 3,000-year-old Jewish legacy in Iran is not something to be
treasured, only another obstacle to war.

Nothing wrong with a cut and paste story, as long as you understand
what you posted and you don't spend all day [posting the same thing on
multiple boards for the entire sake of spreading propoganda.  I
thought the story was interesting and and that it might stimulate
debate. What Moron Mike does is pure and simple &quot;spamaganda&quot;.  He has
no idea what the meaning of anything he posts really is and a single
simple question leaves him in a tizzy.  That should be discouraged,
not the posting of articles meant to stimulate real discussion.  I
would have thought you would understand that difference, but you seem
determined to go down the path of ignorance with so many others.

&gt; &gt; &gt; the page of time&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; He was not threatening to exterminate Jews or even Israel. He was
&gt; &gt; &gt; comparing Israel's occupation of the Palestinians with other
&gt; &gt; &gt; illegitimate systems of rule whose time had passed, including the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shahs who once ruled Iran, apartheid South Africa and the Soviet
&gt; &gt; &gt; empire. Nonetheless, this erroneous translation has survived and
&gt; &gt; &gt; prospered because Israel and her supporters have exploited it for
&gt; &gt; &gt; their own crude propaganda purposes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In the meantime, the 25,000-strong Iranian Jewish community is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; largest in the Middle East outside Israel and traces its roots back
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3,000 years. As one of several non-Muslim minorities in Iran, Jews
&gt; &gt; &gt; there suffer discrimination, but they are certainly no worse off than
&gt; &gt; &gt; the one million Palestinian citizens of Israel - and far better off
&gt; &gt; &gt; than Palestinians under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Iranian Jews have little influence on decision-making and are not
&gt; &gt; &gt; allowed to hold senior posts in the army or bureaucracy. But they
&gt; &gt; &gt; enjoy many freedoms. They have an elected representative in
&gt; &gt; &gt; parliament, they practice their religion openly in synagogues, their
&gt; &gt; &gt; charities are funded by the Jewish diaspora, and they can travel
&gt; &gt; &gt; freely, including to Israel. In Tehran there are six kosher butchers
&gt; &gt; &gt; and about 30 synagogues. Ahmadinejad's office recently made a donation
&gt; &gt; &gt; to a Jewish hospital in Tehran.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As Ciamak Moresadegh, an Iranian Jewish leader, observed: &quot;If you
&gt; &gt; &gt; think Judaism and Zionism are one, it is like thinking Islam and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Taliban are the same, and they are not.&quot; Iran's leaders denounce
&gt; &gt; &gt; Zionism, which they blame for fuelling discrimination against the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Palestinians, but they have also repeatedly avowed that they have no
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem with Jews, Judaism or even the state of Israel. Ahmadinejad,
&gt; &gt; &gt; caricatured as a merchant of genocide, has in fact called for &quot;regime
&gt; &gt; &gt; change&quot; - and then only in the sense that he believes a referendum
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be held of all inhabitants of Israel and the occupied
&gt; &gt; &gt; territories, including refugees from war, on the nature of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; government.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Despite the absence of any threat to Iran's Jews, the Israeli media
&gt; &gt; &gt; recently reported that the Israeli government has been trying to find
&gt; &gt; &gt; new ways to entice Iranian Jews to Israel. The Ma'ariv newspaper
&gt; &gt; &gt; pointed out that previous schemes had found few takers. There was,
&gt; &gt; &gt; noted the report, &quot;a lack of desire on the part of thousands of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Iranian Jews to leave&quot;. According to the New York-based Forward
&gt; &gt; &gt; newspaper, a campaign to persuade Iranian Jews to emigrate to Israel
&gt; &gt; &gt; caused only 152 out of these 25,000 Jews to leave Iran between October
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2005 and September 2006, and most of them were said to have emigrated
&gt; &gt; &gt; for economic reasons, not political ones.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To step up these efforts - and presumably to avoid the embarrassing
&gt; &gt; &gt; incongruence of claiming Iran's genocidal intent while thousands of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jews live happily in Tehran - Israel is now backing a move by Jewish
&gt; &gt; &gt; donors to guarantee every Iranian Jewish family $60,000 to settle in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Israel, in addition to a host of existing financial incentives that
&gt; &gt; &gt; are offered to Jewish immigrants, including loans and cheap
&gt; &gt; &gt; mortgages.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The announcement was met with scorn by the Society of Iranian Jews,
&gt; &gt; &gt; which issued a statement that their national identity was not for
&gt; &gt; &gt; sale. &quot;The identity of Iranian Jews is not tradeable for any amount of
&gt; &gt; &gt; money. Iranian Jews are among the most ancient Iranians. Iran's Jews
&gt; &gt; &gt; love their Iranian identity and their culture, so threats and this
&gt; &gt; &gt; immature political enticement will not achieve their aim of wiping out
&gt; &gt; &gt; the identity of Iranian Jews.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; More important than the welfare of Iranian Jewish families, it seems,
&gt; &gt; &gt; is the value of Iranian Jews as a propaganda tool in Israel's battle
&gt; &gt; &gt; to persuade the world that coexistence with the Muslim world is
&gt; &gt; &gt; impossible. For those who want to engineer a clash of civilisations,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 3,000-year-old Jewish legacy in Iran is not something to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; treasured, only another obstacle to war.

Well, I generally find that those interested in discussing a
particular story tend to offer their views on said story in addition
to the story itself.  So, what's your take on it?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Iran is the new Nazi Germany and its president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the new Hitler. Or so Israeli officials have been declaring for months
&gt; &gt; &gt; as they and their American allies try to persuade the doubters in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Washington that an attack on Tehran is essential. And if the latest
&gt; &gt; &gt; media reports are to be trusted, it looks like they may again be
&gt; &gt; &gt; winning the battle for hearts and minds: vice-president Dick Cheney is
&gt; &gt; &gt; said to be diverting the White House back on track to launch a
&gt; &gt; &gt; military strike.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Earlier this year Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's opposition leader and
&gt; &gt; &gt; the man who appears to be styling himself as scaremonger-in-chief,
&gt; &gt; &gt; told us: &quot;It's 1938 and Iran is Germany. And Iran is racing to arm
&gt; &gt; &gt; itself with atomic bombs.&quot; Of Ahmadinejad, he said: &quot;He is preparing
&gt; &gt; &gt; another Holocaust for the Jewish state.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; A few weeks ago, as Israel's military intelligence claimed - as it has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been doing regularly since the early 1990s - that Iran is only a year
&gt; &gt; &gt; or so away from the &quot;point of no return&quot; on developing a nuclear
&gt; &gt; &gt; warhead, Netanyahu was at it again. &quot;Iran could be the first
&gt; &gt; &gt; undeterrable nuclear power,&quot; he warned, adding: &quot;This is a Jewish
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem like Hitler was a Jewish problem ... The future of the Jewish
&gt; &gt; &gt; people depends on the future of Israel.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; But Netanyahu has been far from alone in making extravagant claims
&gt; &gt; &gt; about a looming genocide from Iran. Israel's new president, Shimon
&gt; &gt; &gt; Peres, has compared an Iranian nuclear bomb to a &quot;flying concentration
&gt; &gt; &gt; camp&quot;. And the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, told a German newspaper
&gt; &gt; &gt; last year: &quot;[Ahmadinejad] speaks as Hitler did in his time of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; extermination of the entire Jewish nation.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is an interesting problem with selling the &quot;Iran as Nazi
&gt; &gt; &gt; Germany&quot; line. If Ahmadinejad really is Hitler, ready to commit
&gt; &gt; &gt; genocide against Israel's Jews as soon as he can get his hands on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; nuclear weapon, why are some 25,000 Jews living peacefully in Iran and
&gt; &gt; &gt; more than reluctant to leave, despite repeated enticements from Israel
&gt; &gt; &gt; and American Jews?

&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the basis for Israel's dire forecasts - the ideological
&gt; &gt; &gt; scaffolding being erected, presumably, to justify an attack on Iran?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Helpfully, as George Bush defended his Iraq policies last month, he
&gt; &gt; &gt; reminded us yet again of the menace Iran supposedly poses: it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;threatening to wipe Israel off the map&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This myth has been endlessly recycled since a translating error was
&gt; &gt; &gt; made of a speech Ahmadinejad delivered nearly two years ago. Farsi
&gt; &gt; &gt; experts have verified that the Iranian president, far from threatening
&gt; &gt; &gt; to destroy Israel, was quoting from an earlier speech by the late
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ayatollah Khomeini in which he reassured supporters of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Palestinians that &quot;the Zionist regime in Jerusalem&quot; would &quot;vanish from
&gt; &gt; &gt; the page of time&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; He was not threatening to exterminate Jews or even Israel. He was

Hitler had Jews on his payroll too!  I think Ahmadenijad is very
dangerous and unpredictable. There is no doubt that he is funneling
weapons to insurgents in Iraq and has his sights set on being the man
who removes the Jews from the Middle East.  I don't know if they are
close to a nuclear bomb, but with him in charge, discetion is the
better part of valor.

The state of Israel have offered all kinds of financial incentives in
an attempt to dislodge Iran's Jewish population, but they have
discovered &quot;a lack of desire on the part of thousands of Iranian Jews
to leave.&quot;

To step up these efforts - and presumably to avoid the embarrassing
incongruence of claiming an imminent second Holocaust while thousands
of Jews live happily in Tehran - Israel is now backing a move by
Jewish donors to guarantee every Iranian Jewish family $60,000 to
settle in Israel, in addition to a host of existing financial
incentives that are offered to Jewish immigrants, including loans and
cheap mortgages.

The announcement was met with scorn by the Society of Iranian Jews,
which issued a statement that their national identity was not for
sale. &quot;The identity of Iranian Jews is not tradeable for any amount of
money. Iranian Jews are among the most ancient Iranians. Iran's Jews
love their Iranian identity and their culture, so threats and this
immature political enticement will not achieve their aim of wiping out
the identity of Iranian Jews.&quot;
It really does provide the Holocaust predictors with a little bit of a
problem that Iran's Jewish population are not only happy to remain in
Iran but that they are refusing rather large cash incentives in order
to do so.

However, as the article also touches upon, sometimes this kind of
Israeli pressure can become a self fulfilling prophecy. By implying
that Iran's Jewish population have some kind of dual loyalty or that
they are really Israelis rather than Iranians, the Israeli
propagandists run the real risk that other Iranians might take them at
their word. Which would have a devastating effect on Iran's Jews.

&gt; Iran is the new Nazi Germany and its president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
&gt; the new Hitler. Or so Israeli officials have been declaring for months
&gt; as they and their American allies try to persuade the doubters in
&gt; Washington that an attack on Tehran is essential. And if the latest
&gt; media reports are to be trusted, it looks like they may again be
&gt; winning the battle for hearts and minds: vice-president Dick Cheney is
&gt; said to be diverting the White House back on track to launch a
&gt; military strike.

&gt; Earlier this year Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's opposition leader and
&gt; the man who appears to be styling himself as scaremonger-in-chief,
&gt; told us: &quot;It's 1938 and Iran is Germany. And Iran is racing to arm
&gt; itself with atomic bombs.&quot; Of Ahmadinejad, he said: &quot;He is preparing
&gt; another Holocaust for the Jewish state.&quot;

&gt; A few weeks ago, as Israel's military intelligence claimed - as it has
&gt; been doing regularly since the early 1990s - that Iran is only a year
&gt; or so away from the &quot;point of no return&quot; on developing a nuclear
&gt; warhead, Netanyahu was at it again. &quot;Iran could be the first
&gt; undeterrable nuclear power,&quot; he warned, adding: &quot;This is a Jewish
&gt; problem like Hitler was a Jewish problem ... The future of the Jewish
&gt; people depends on the future of Israel.&quot;

&gt; But Netanyahu has been far from alone in making extravagant claims
&gt; about a looming genocide from Iran. Israel's new president, Shimon
&gt; Peres, has compared an Iranian nuclear bomb to a &quot;flying concentration
&gt; camp&quot;. And the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, told a German newspaper
&gt; last year: &quot;[Ahmadinejad] speaks as Hitler did in his time of the
&gt; extermination of the entire Jewish nation.&quot;

&gt; There is an interesting problem with selling the &quot;Iran as Nazi
&gt; Germany&quot; line. If Ahmadinejad really is Hitler, ready to commit
&gt; genocide against Israel's Jews as soon as he can get his hands on a
&gt; nuclear weapon, why are some 25,000 Jews living peacefully in Iran and
&gt; more than reluctant to leave, despite repeated enticements from Israel
&gt; and American Jews?

&gt; What is the basis for Israel's dire forecasts - the ideological
&gt; scaffolding being erected, presumably, to justify an attack on Iran?
&gt; Helpfully, as George Bush defended his Iraq policies last month, he
&gt; reminded us yet again of the menace Iran supposedly poses: it is
&gt; &quot;threatening to wipe Israel off the map&quot;.

&gt; This myth has been endlessly recycled since a translating error was
&gt; made of a speech Ahmadinejad delivered nearly two years ago. Farsi
&gt; experts have verified that the Iranian president, far from threatening
&gt; to destroy Israel, was quoting from an earlier speech by the late
&gt; Ayatollah Khomeini in which he reassured supporters of the
&gt; Palestinians that &quot;the Zionist regime in Jerusalem&quot; would &quot;vanish from
&gt; the page of time&quot;.

&gt; He was not threatening to exterminate Jews or even Israel. He was
&gt; comparing Israel's occupation of the Palestinians with other
&gt; illegitimate systems of rule whose time had passed, including the
&gt; Shahs who once ruled Iran, apartheid South Africa and the Soviet
&gt; empire. Nonetheless, this erroneous translation has survived and
&gt; prospered because Israel and her supporters have exploited it for
&gt; their own crude propaganda purposes.

&gt; In the meantime, the 25,000-strong Iranian Jewish community is the
&gt; largest in the Middle East outside Israel and traces its roots back
&gt; 3,000 years. As one of several non-Muslim minorities in Iran, Jews
&gt; there suffer discrimination, but they are certainly no worse off than
&gt; the one million Palestinian citizens of Israel - and far better off
&gt; than Palestinians under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza.

&gt; Iranian Jews have little influence on decision-making and are not
&gt; allowed to hold senior posts in the army or bureaucracy. But they
&gt; enjoy many freedoms. They have an elected representative in
&gt; parliament, they practice their religion openly in synagogues, their
&gt; charities are funded by the Jewish diaspora, and they can travel
&gt; freely, including to Israel. In Tehran there are six kosher butchers
&gt; and about 30 synagogues. Ahmadinejad's office recently made a donation
&gt; to a Jewish hospital in Tehran.

&gt; As Ciamak Moresadegh, an Iranian Jewish leader, observed: &quot;If you
&gt; think Judaism and Zionism are one, it is like thinking Islam and the
&gt; Taliban are the same, and they are not.&quot; Iran's leaders denounce
&gt; Zionism, which they blame for fuelling discrimination against the
&gt; Palestinians, but they have also repeatedly avowed that they have no
&gt; problem with Jews, Judaism or even the state of Israel. Ahmadinejad,
&gt; caricatured as a merchant of genocide, has in fact called for &quot;regime
&gt; change&quot; - and then only in the sense that he believes a referendum
&gt; should be held of all inhabitants of Israel and the occupied
&gt; territories, including refugees from war, on the nature of the
&gt; government.

&gt; Despite the absence of any threat to Iran's Jews, the Israeli media
&gt; recently reported that the Israeli government has been trying to find
&gt; new ways to entice Iranian Jews to Israel. The Ma'ariv newspaper
&gt; pointed out that previous schemes had found few takers. There was,
&gt; noted the report, &quot;a lack of desire on the part of thousands of
&gt; Iranian Jews to leave&quot;. According to the New York-based Forward
&gt; newspaper, a campaign to persuade Iranian Jews to emigrate to Israel
&gt; caused only 152 out of these 25,000 Jews to leave Iran between October
&gt; 2005 and September 2006, and most of them were said to have emigrated
&gt; for economic reasons, not political ones.

&gt; To step up these efforts - and presumably to avoid the embarrassing
&gt; incongruence of claiming Iran's genocidal intent while thousands of
&gt; Jews live happily in Tehran - Israel is now backing a move by Jewish

It is hard to disagree with an of that, but the fact remains that
regardless of how Israel may feel about Ahmadinejad, he is financing
people that are killing our soldiers and that is unforgiveable.

Ahmadinejad, he is financing
people that are killing our soldiers and that is unforgiveable.
----
believe what you want

Who are the neoconservatives? The first generation were ex-liberals,
socialists, and Trotskyites, boat-people from the McGovern revolution
who rafted over to the GOP at the end of conservatism's long march to
power with Ronald Reagan in 1980.

A neoconservative, wrote Kevin Phillips back then, is more likely to
be a magazine editor than a bricklayer. Today, he or she is more
likely to be a resident scholar at a public policy institute such as
the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) or one of its clones like the
Center for Security Policy or the Jewish Institute for National
Security Affairs (JINSA). As one wag writes, a neocon is more familiar
with the inside of a think tank than an Abrams tank.

Our soldiers are in there part of the world as an occupying force. It
won't last long. They'll tuck tail at some point just like they did in
Vietnam. Ask Swartzcoff why they didn't march into Bagdad the first
time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In the meantime, the 25,000-strong Iranian Jewish community is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; largest in the Middle East outside Israel and traces its roots back
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3,000 years. As one of several non-Muslim minorities in Iran, Jews
&gt; &gt; &gt; there suffer discrimination, but they are certainly no worse off than
&gt; &gt; &gt; the one million Palestinian citizens of Israel - and far better off
&gt; &gt; &gt; than Palestinians under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Iranian Jews have little influence on decision-making and are not
&gt; &gt; &gt; allowed to hold senior posts in the army or bureaucracy. But they
&gt; &gt; &gt; enjoy many freedoms. They have an elected representative in
&gt; &gt; &gt; parliament, they practice their religion openly in synagogues, their
&gt; &gt; &gt; charities are funded by the Jewish diaspora, and they can travel
&gt; &gt; &gt; freely, including to Israel. In Tehran there are six kosher butchers
&gt; &gt; &gt; and about 30 synagogues. Ahmadinejad's office recently made a donation
&gt; &gt; &gt; to a Jewish hospital in Tehran.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As Ciamak Moresadegh, an Iranian Jewish leader, observed: &quot;If you
&gt; &gt; &gt; think Judaism and Zionism are one, it is like thinking Islam and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Taliban are the same, and they are not.&quot; Iran's leaders denounce
&gt; &gt; &gt; Zionism, which they blame for fuelling discrimination against the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Palestinians, but they have also repeatedly avowed that they have no
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem with Jews, Judaism or even the state of Israel. Ahmadinejad,
&gt; &gt; &gt; caricatured as a merchant of genocide, has in fact called for &quot;regime
&gt; &gt; &gt; change&quot; - and then only in the sense that he believes a referendum
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be held of all inhabitants of Israel and the occupied
&gt; &gt; &gt; territories, including refugees from war, on the nature of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; government.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Despite the absence of any threat to Iran's Jews, the Israeli media
&gt; &gt; &gt; recently reported that the Israeli government has been trying to find
&gt; &gt; &gt; new ways to entice Iranian Jews to Israel. The Ma'ariv newspaper
&gt; &gt; &gt; pointed out that previous schemes had found few takers. There was,
&gt; &gt; &gt; noted the report, &quot;a lack of desire on the part of thousands of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Iranian Jews to leave&quot;. According to the New York-based Forward
&gt; &gt; &gt; newspaper, a campaign to persuade Iranian Jews to emigrate to Israel
&gt; &gt; &gt; caused only 152 out of these 25,000 Jews to leave Iran between October
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2005 and September 2006, and most of them were said to have emigrated
&gt; &gt; &gt; for economic reasons, not political ones.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To step up these efforts - and presumably to avoid the embarrassing
&gt; &gt; &gt; incongruence of claiming Iran's genocidal intent while thousands of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jews live happily in Tehran - Israel is now backing a move by Jewish
&gt; &gt; &gt; donors to guarantee every Iranian Jewish family $60,000 to settle in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Israel, in addition to a host of existing financial incentives that
&gt; &gt; &gt; are offered to Jewish immigrants, including loans and cheap
&gt; &gt; &gt; mortgages.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The announcement was met with scorn by the Society of Iranian Jews,
&gt; &gt; &gt; which issued a statement that their national identity was not for
&gt; &gt; &gt; sale. &quot;The identity of Iranian Jews is not tradeable for any amount of
&gt; &gt; &gt; money. Iranian Jews are among the most ancient Iranians. Iran's Jews
