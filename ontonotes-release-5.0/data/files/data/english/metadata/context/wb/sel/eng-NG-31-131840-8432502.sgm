Helping Your Children Remember Their Grandparents
By Allison Gilbert
A Web Exclusive, December 4, 2006
There are a lot of jobs we moms have: making sure our kids succeed in school
ensuring they develop the social discipline to be a good friend, and
ironically, scheduling unscheduled time into our hectic calendars so they
can develop their creativity as well. For many mothers though, there is
another albeit rarely discussed item on our priority list—keeping our own
parents' memory alive for our children.
My son Jake is six and my daughter Lexi is four. They will never get to know
their maternal grandparents; my parents have both passed away. Their absence
has revolutionized my relationship with my children. I not only consciously
try to work my parents into conversation, but I have also begun to think
proactivelyâ€”and often intensely—about my own legacy and the lessons I am
passing along to my children. I work harder to ensure I am creating the kind
of memories I want to be remembered by. And I am not alone.
Emmy award-winning actor Dennis Franz is one of the long string of people I
have interviewed about how he is passing on his parents memories to his
children. He's kept audio recordings his parents made on a trip to the
Empire State building when he was five or six, and he also saved some of
their little collectibles. &quot;Though I miss my parents dearly, I'm so glad
that I miss them. If I didn't, it would mean that they didn't have as much
of an impact on my life as they do. I would like to have the same sort of
impact on our children.&quot;
For political icon Geraldine Ferraro, it's also important that her children
remember her parents. Her kids got to know her mother, but her father died
when she was just eight years old. &quot;You hope when you bury a parent,
whatever strands you got from them, you'll transfer to your children. You'll
bring your children up knowing about your relationship with your own parents
I think that's important to do.&quot;
Still for others, what needs to be passed down are simple, memory-making
rituals. Singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash, daughter of music legend Johnny
Cash, says that listening to her father's music in a personal way has become
important for her family to do. &quot;I played Ballads of the True West for my
seven-year-old son who never heard it, and said, &quot;Listen to this great song.
Now he's really into it—it's a way to keep him connected with his grandpa.&quot;

The collective honesty of so many people I have talked to has allowed me to
glean some tips for keeping your parents' memory alive for your children:
Show Photos: When you celebrate your child's birthday, show them pictures of
their grandparents at their previous parties and even at their birth.
Incorporate photos into family gatherings—perhaps at your next Thanksgiving
dinner pass around favorite pictures of them at past get-togethers.
Talk Openly: Be sure to share favorite age-appropriate stories about your
parents—and add to them as they get older. For example, my mother loved nuts
She was a nut-a-holic. When my children dig into a can of walnuts in our
house, I always say, 'Grandma Lynn loved nuts.' Or, when my kids play with
their building blocks, I tell stories about how Grandpa Sidney was an
architect and he designed buildings too. It's a little something that makes
my parents a little more real.
Live Traditions: If your parents always did something special for your
birthday or made holidays unique in some way—why not incorporate those same
traditions into your family plans—and don't forget to tell them their
grandma or grandpa did &quot;it&quot; this way too. One special summer tradition I
shared with my dad was going to Tanglewood, an outdoor concert space in
Massachusetts. My father loved listening to classical music. When my kids
are old enough I will bring them there for their first, informal classical
music appreciation session, and I will tell them, &quot;Grandpa Sidney loved it
here.&quot;
Give Heirlooms: Nearly every person I interviewed kept mementoes from their
parents that will be passed along to their children one day, if they haven't
done so already. Whether you save pieces of jewelry, collectibles, clothing
(or in one case dish rags!) don't throw anything away you think could help
your children know their grandparents. If you do part with them, your
children will have fewer tangible things to remind them of their
grandparents.
Allow Sadness: We all agree we want our children to be able to give and
receive love. In that case, I think it's okay to let them see you get upset
about missing your parents. You loved your mommy and daddy too. Permit
yourself to experience the pain that crops up from time to time - and allow
it to be a lesson in caring - that it's okay to show feelings, and that
grown-ups cry too.
And here is my favorite bit of feel-good wisdom, taken from actress and
author Mariel Hemingway, granddaughter of writer Ernest Hemingway: &quot;Even
though I lost my parents young and that was difficult, I know that they gave
me what I needed for my lifetime. Everything they taught me, good and bad,
was something I could use for my well-being and my parenting.&quot;

released book Always Too Soon: Voices of Support for Those Who Have Lost
Both Parents. (Seal Press, December 2006) Always Too Soon is a collection of

Have you tried reinstalling it? Checking your preferences? I use firefox
as
my browser and some programs will not work with it. Check your firewall
also.

Messages in this topic (14) 2c. Re: Test email Posted by: &quot;Lynn Walker&quot; waningmoon@roadrunner.com wycche Sat Aug 18, 2007 9:42 am (PST) The problem is with the latest version, I have an email into Apple.
When I try to install version &amp;.02 it stalls in the middle of the
restart
process. Other Mac users have had this problem, it was caused by the
latest security fix and I need a special code that overrides the
security
fix so the computer will finish the restart process. Apple is taking
their sweet time getting the code to me. Club members thought we
might share the code but it shut down two member's computers for
unauthorized use of the code, they had a mess getting that fixed!
I am seriously thinking about reinstalling the older version and
forgetting
this new upgrade. However, I am really hesitant because I really don't
know what I'm doing and I'm afraid I'll screw EVERYTHING up and my son
who is usually very supportive is being a pain in the butt telling me
to deal
with it. So I'll give Apple a few more days and go from there.
However, thank you for your suggestions, I will check those and see if
I can do anything.

Spiritual Emergency

Spiritual Emergency
Ever wonder where the &quot;experience&quot; people talk about comes from? Well, alot
of us have teachers, but all a teacher can do is open the door, we must each
walk through on our own. It is the resulting process of trial and error that
has often been the root of many Spiritual emergencies. for these purposes, I
recommend that each individual keep a psychic or spiritual first aid kit.
Below is an example of what a kit might contain.
1. Holy Water
2. Lavendar
3. Eucalyptus
4. Apple-cider Vinegar
5. Sage
6. Beer for bathing
7. Purple Onion Skin
8. Cinnamon
9. Clove
10. Salt
11. Various Candles
12. Juniper
13. Color Swatches
Below is a brief list of some common &quot;emergencies&quot;, and a quick overview of
a solution to each.
A. Evil Eye---Beer bath.
B. Demonic Influence in the Home---Combine sage, eucalyptus, and the skin
from a purple onion. Smoke your house with this combination, and follow with
a blessing of Holy Water.
C. Elemental Attack---Use salt and candles in addition to juniper and prayer
to return to it's keeper.
D. Negativity in the Home---Use the aroma of cinamon and cloves. I boil
these on the stove.
E. Negative Energy in the Aura---Bathe in a combination of apple cider
vinegar, eucalyptus, and lavendar.
F. &quot;Patch&quot; for Holes in the Aura---First cleanse the aura, then place a
chakra colored swatch of cloth that has been scented with eucalyptus over
the area. Clap your hands three times, rub them together, and then place
them on top of the cloth while visualizing the hole closing. Seek
professional help as soon as possible.
There are many types of emergencies, and obviously I can not cover them all;
nor do I claim to have experienced all that can happen. Beware of anyone who
says that they have. I can only promise to help to the best of my ability.
If that means telling you that I have no clue as to how to help you then
that is what you will hear. I will however lend any wisdom that I can from
my years of trial and error, and mystic guidance. May your Goddess and God
always hold you in the palm of Their hands.

Do's and Dont's

Interesting Phase Do's and Don'ts...

- DO... Read as many books on the subject as you can-on History, Myths,
Poetry, Psychology and Science as well as books on Witchcraft or Magick.
- DO... Make yourself a research library. Take notes or highlight passages
that particularly interest you. If you have a question on what is written,
place a question mark next to that passage. You should enjoy what you read
at this stage-the enjoyment will actually help you to retain what you read
better than struggling through dusty tomes on alchemy (unless you happen to
love alchemy, that is!).
- DO... start a journal. You can even call it a &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; if you
want to. (It can just be a loose leaf notebook, These are handy for creating
different sections.) Write down both the things that you have found to be of
interest and the things that you would like to know more about.
- DO... Look at Nature. Witchcraft and most other Pagan paths are called
earth or nature based&quot; religions. What is Nature saying to you? Bring home
rocks, sticks, leaves or other things you find that attract your attention.
Now ask yourself-WHY did you bring that home? Write it down.

- DO... get organized. Concentration is an important skill in Magic.
Disciplining yourself to make regular entries into a journal and writing
things down will help you to develop concentration.
- DO... learn to ask SPECIFIC questions of other Witches or Pagans when you
need help. And ask yourself some questions, too. &quot;What do I think Witchcraft
is? What do I find here that has meaning for me?&quot;
- DO... tell the truth. Can seasoned Witches tell if someone is &quot;full of it
? Yes, they can and rather quickly, too! Be honest about what you know and
what you don't.
- DO... spend time alone to think carefully about how you feel and what you
want for yourself.
Some people think at the onset that Witchcraft will allow them to change
other people or circumstances. But YOU will be the one who changes as you
explore this Path. Do you really WANT to change?

- DON'T... take it too fast. You have not made any commitments yet. You are
doing research into a subject that interests you on a personal level.
Jumping into a group situation at this point may hinder your development
more than help it. You need to find out where YOU are going before you hit
the trail with someone else.
- DON'T... get discouraged. Sometimes it is very difficult to &quot;go it alone.&quot;
But the Craft is made up of individuals who bring something of value to the
Path-as well as receive benefits from it. Many &quot;old timers&quot; have the &quot;Grampa
attitude&quot;. You know, the &quot;When I was your age, I had to walk three miles to
school every day...in the snow...with no boots...carrying my little sister..
and a load of firewood...&quot; Well, in a way that is true. It WAS much harder
to be a Witch only a few decades ago. So be forgiving if they are not ready
to hand you all their hand gathered &quot;firewood&quot; on a silver platter....you
may have to walk a mile or two by yourself....in the snow...with no boots...
.
- DON'T... ask about joining a terraspace coven just yet. A coven is a close
knit group working together. It is a difficult process to create an
effective magickal unit. Most covens are not actively looking for new
members, as each time a new person is added to the group, it takes time for
the unit to re-adjust. There are some cyberspace &quot;covens&quot; that readily
accept new members. If you look on it as a &quot;training exercise&quot;, you could
learn a few things. Ask around the Internet.
- DON'T... be afraid because you are not part of a group. Many, many Witches
find out after much trial and error that they actually PREFER to work alone.
Traditionally the Witch WAS a loner...and many still are by choice. Often
solitary Witches get together to talk and exchange information and then
happily go back to their solitary practice.
You CAN do a little bit of both.
Still &quot;Interested&quot;? Then you will probably want to go further into...

Part Two-The &quot;EXPLORATORY PHASE&quot;:

You have read quite a few books, taken tons of notes and written faithfully
in your Book of Shadows or journal. You have found some resources on the
Internet and may have even asked a Pagan a few of those pesky questions that
have been bothering you lately.
Now what? This is where you begin to exercise your discretion a bit. As you
start weeding out the things that you have decided are not for you and
embracing what DOES feel right, you are also making decisions about what
sort of group you may eventually be comfortable with. (And many seekers
still feel at this point that they DO want to find a group.)
Does the whole circle casting with sword, smoking incense and flickering
candles appeal to you? Or would you rather simply sit quietly and let your
heart speak?Are you more introverted than extroverted? All grand dreams of
leading a large public ritual aside, do you feel comfortable right NOW
speaking to large groups of people? Or do you prefer the company of a few
close and intimate friends?Do you like to mull things over before making a
decision? Or are you spontaneous and always dashing off to go rock climbing
or roller blading? Asking yourself these and similar questions will help you
to make decisions.
What are the reasons that you would want to be part of a coven or group-and
what sort of group may that be? You may also begin visualization techniques
at this time. You begin to see yourself in the tales of mythic heroes and
heroines. You may visualize actually doing the rituals and circles that you
have read about.
You imagine what it may be like to be a member of a coven-laughing as you
all run through the woods on your way to the bonfire. How do these images
and scenarios make you feel? Be honest. No one is looking over your shoulder
at this point. Most importantly, how comfortable are YOU with this Path that
you are researching? Does it fit who you are? Not who you would like to be..
not who you would like others to think that you are...but you as you are
right now. Think about this a lot. It will save you much disillusionment in
the future.
You may begin to collect a tool or two or think about setting up an altar
area. You start buying lots and lots of candles and incense. You browse the
herb shops and look through catalogs for magickal items. You may even buy
some things. You are beginning to actually make some outward decisions about
what you feel inside. You are &quot;exploring&quot; new possibilities.

Messages in this topic (1) 5a. House &amp; Home Posted by: &quot;Stevie Nicks Number One Fan&quot; irishfaeriewitch1@comcast.net wannabelikestevienicks Sat Aug 18, 2007 9:07 am (PST)

House &amp; Home

Spirits of the corners,
Winds of the quarters,
You who stand watching,
And you who hear my voice,
Guard well my home tonight.

Dwelling places have always been seen as possessing magical potential. To
enter a home, one must first pass over the threshold, considered a sacred
place in many cultures. Doors archetypally represent the portal between
worlds. To stand between them automatically puts you in the magical space
known as the place &quot;in between.&quot; To the ancient Celts, any place that was
not clearly in one world or another possessed inherent magical power. In
your doorway you are neither in nor out--you are in between--making your
threshold an ideal place to chant blessings or cast magical spells for the
protection of your home.
Many Witches like to place magical objects that offer their homes protection
on or near their doors. Small, decorative brooms are often used for this
purpose. The broom, called a besom in the Craft, is usually shown with its
bristles up to symbolize the unity of the divine and the blessing of the
gods upon the dwelling. The handle represents the phallus of the God, and
the bristles are reminiscent of the mound of Venus on the female body, the
entrance to the womb of the Goddess.
Many common threshold decorations, like door harps or wind chimes, were
originally devices of magical home protection. In both cases the intent is
to use musical sounds to scare away negativity or evil spirits.
To use a door harp or wind chimes to protect the entrance to your home,
project into it your intent through visualization, then hang it, sealing the
act with words of power, such as:
&quot;Chimes with lovely magical sound
Spread your protection all around
Guard the opening of my door
Send harm away forever more.&quot;

Another magical opening to the house is the chimney. The word hearth
contains the word heart, underscoring its place as the center of the home.
Many Pagans keep their ancestor shrines near the hearth. They may also leave
food and drink for household faeries near it, or decorate it with protective
symbols.
The modern hearth is the kitchen, and in China there still exists an annual
festival to honor their most personal deity, the Kitchen God of the
household. Exactly one week prior to the start of the Chinese New Year,
families remove the picture of him that hangs over the stove and burn it
over a sweet-smelling incense, amidst offerings of candy and cakes. The
Kitchen God flies on the incense up to his celestial home to report to the
other deities about the behavior of the family during the year, especially
how they treated one another. After this family ritual is complete, a new
picture of the Kitchen God is put over the stove.
In many Pagan cultures it was believed that homes possessed guardian spirits
The most well-known of these are the Lares and the Penates of ancient Rome,
who were celebrated in a special festival that took place each January 8.
The Lares lived in subterranean sancturaries underneath the homes they chose
to look after. They slept by day, and at night came out to care for the
exterior of the home. The Penates lived above the house, usually in &quot;attics&quot;
or in the trees that shaded the dwelling. They awoke with the sunrise, and
spent their days taking care of the household tasks and looking after the
welfare of the home's inhabitants. On festival day, every member of the
household would gather around the home altar to make an offering of thanks,
usually in the form of food, wine and fresh straw for bedding.
Modern Witches like to see to it that their homes are protected, or &quot;warded,
from both astral and physical intruders. One popular method of this is to
mentally visualize the home being surrounded with protective symbols, like
the pentagram. Another is making a wash made from purified water and boiled
protective herbs. On each window and door in the home a finger damp with the
warding wash is used to draw a large pentagram while words of power are
spoken to seal the spell. Any leftover wash is sprinkled outside around the
perimeters of the property. To make a warding wash, simply boil distilled
water into which you have placed a tea ball or cheesecloth full of dried
herbs such as basil, rue, cinnamon, or bay, which are known to have
protective energies. As the mixture heats, be sure to clearly visualize your
intent.

You can also bless your home using an old custom involving bread and salt.
Bread is offered to the household guardians as a libation, and the salt is
kept in the heart of the home to ground any evil that might enter. After you
do this, burn a purifying or protecting incense, such as frankincense,
cinnamon, or pepper, moving it from room to room while you visualize any
negativity fleeing from your home. As you go, chant over and over your words
of power:
&quot;Smoke of air and fire and earth
Cleanse and bless this home and hearth
Only good may dwell in here.&quot;

I Am Pagan, Hear Me Roar

I am pagan, hear me roar! -

Sunday, August 16, 1998 Witches are coming out of their broom closets and
speaking up They've been misunderstood, mocked and even murdered. But today,
pagans are more willing to come out of the closet to speak of their beliefs
and practices which are rooted in ancient times. At the same time, they're
asking for tolerance and understanding from others, particularly Christians.

Nineteen-year-old Alison Seglie was once a devout Christian who attended
Catholic school and religious summer camps. Now the Edmonton teen is a pagan
Like the many Christian religions, pagans, too, belong to a whole host of
different belief systems. There are Druids. There are those who believe in
native spirituality. And there are practitioners of Wicca, among others. The
clothing clerk and nanny said her interest in the pagan practice of Wicca
was sparked after buying some Tarot cards at a shop over Christmas. &quot;It's a
very spiritual thing for me,&quot; says Seglie, who was among about 100 people
who gathered this month outside Edmonton city hall to celebrate Pagan Pride
Day. She was photographed smiling with a friend and holding a sign which
read, &quot;Hug a Witch.&quot; &quot;I like the nature aspect of paganism. I can connect
more with the idea of goddesses and the fact males and females are equal.&quot;
What pushed her away from Christianity is the Catholic church's treatment of
women, says Seglie. &quot;Lots of their rules are outrageous. I don't like that
women are supposed to be there for their husbands at all times and that they
re not really supposed to enjoy sex.&quot; She says most friends understand her
non-traditional religious views, but it alarms some people. &quot;I was on the
bus once and a lady came up with some material to give me that had a picture
of Jesus on it. I told her I wasn't interested since I was more into
paganism.&quot; The woman turned away and could later be heard telling a friend
that Seglie believed in something &quot;evil.&quot;
Pagan witch Paula Thibaudeau, owner of Where Faeries Live - an Edmonton
store that caters to such lifestyles - says she and others like her have
decided it's time to be more open, even if they risk the wrath of
non-believers. With that in mind the Wiccan woman organized the Pagan Pride
Day rally, Edmonton's first. She feels the number of pagans in Edmonton has
grown from a few hundred in the 1970s to several thousand today. But most
are too afraid to openly profess their beliefs. &quot;The biggest misconception
is we're satanic,&quot; says Thibaudeau, 31, relaxing on a couch inside her store
which is filled with the smell of burning incense and the soft strains of a
Loreena McKennitt tune. &quot;We don't have anything to do with Satanism because
we don't believe in Satan. &quot;There are no sacrifices in our rituals...We don
t abuse children...I have a daughter and I haven't eaten her...I don't own a
pointy hat and I've very rarely had a wart. &quot;All those things are just
Christian propaganda.&quot; Thibaudeau says she leads her coven in chants and
prayers, concocts herbal potions that can cure problems as simple as a
toothache and casts spells that help others better their lives. No animals
are sacrificed for such potions, she says. Nor would she ever attempt to
cast an evil spell on anyone. &quot;You don't make spells to manipulate anyone.&quot;
She says the most requested spell is one of abundance - mainly for people
who are looking for work. In that ceremony she burns patchouli and basil and
leads a chant &quot;to the gods and the universe.&quot; Whether or not the spell works
is most often up to the person themselves, Thibaudeau admits. &quot;You can't
just sit on your butt and wait for Ed McMahon to come to your door with a
cheque from Publishers' Clearing House. You have to work at things.&quot;
Rev. Brian Kiely, a minister at the Unitarian Church of Edmonton, says he's
got some advice for people who fear or mistrust those who advocate pagan
spirituality. Says Kiely: &quot;Take a deep breath and relax.&quot; The family that
prays together - Leanne Richer (left), Elliott Rennie, Paula Thibaudeau
holding Twyla-Faere, and Micheal Black. Kiely thinks more people are turning
to paganism because many grew up with little or no religion and are
searching now for some sort of spiritual fulfillment. &quot;They're now in their
30s and 40s and they now want spirituality but often turn to the
non-traditional ones. The New Age movement has fuelled some of this as well.
His church - headquartered in Boston - is essentially non-denominational
and has hosted services for several religions including pagan ones. While he
s not a pagan, Kiely has witches as friends and feels the belief system has
validity. &quot;Our church believes all religions have a piece of the truth,&quot;
says Kiely, who describes himself as a theistic humanist. &quot;What paganism is,
is people drawing spirituality from the earth itself. &quot;There's been a
reaffirmation of native spirituality lately, but when it's white people
practising paganism and Wicca, people get their hackles up.&quot; He says society
s fears of paganism date back hundreds of years when witches were burned or
hung because the heads of Christian religions felt threatened by them.
Witches were simply the healers in villages in those days and used herbal
remedies,&quot; says Kiely. Thibaudeau, like many pagans, had to go underground
for a time when she began to get threatening anonymous letters in 1987 after
Edmonton's July 31 tornado. She fled to Toronto and doesn't much like
discussing that period except to say it was a mistake to leave. It was about
the same time an owner of an Edmonton metaphysical bookstore was forced to
flee due to harassment. Thibaudeau and her pagan colleagues hired two city
police officers to keep a watch over them at the recent rally lest there be
trouble from fanatics. There wasn't any.
Pagan Michael Black says he's bothered that he and others are discriminated
against because of their beliefs. Black, who was brought up as a strict
Christian, says what irks him about such traditional religions is how some
interpret the Bible. &quot;Often the Bible is misinterpreted and used as a weapon
against people rather than as a tool,&quot; says Black. He doesn't think there'll
be any quick acceptance of people who opt for non-traditional religions. &quot;It
could still be decades before pagans get a break.&quot; For her part, Thibaudeau
says local pagans will become even more active, in part by asking Edmonton
Mayor Bill Smith to officially declare Pagan Pride Day next year. She and
other pagans feel it will help end prejudice against them by getting
non-believers to understand their beliefs. Christ himself, would have been
more tolerant of pagans than some modern-day Christians, she says. &quot;Jesus
would have loved us because we practise what we preach - unlike some
Christians.&quot; Nor does she care that some citizens will always think her
practices are flaky. She's accustomed to that from early on. &quot;I called
myself a witch when I was nine years old, although I'm sure some of my
family saw me as some sort of a Fruit Loop. &quot;Today, I believe the earth
needs as many pagans as it can get. And we're speaking out. &quot;The witches are
coming out of their broom closets.&quot;
FAST FACTS ON WICCA AND PAGANISM:

Wicca is arguably the best-known of pagan religions. It is based on the
pre-Christian beliefs of tribes in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales,
although its origins go back back to Paleolithic peoples who worshipped a
hunter god and a fertility goddess. Wiccans feel that nature is divine and
as such are strong environmentalists. They celebrate cycles of the sun and
moon and often worship outdoors. Some do so in the nude.
Wiccans believe all plants and animals in the world are equal and will often
say a prayer of thanks before doing something as simple as pulling out a
garden carrot.
Like Christians, Wiccans believe you should not harm anyone, including
yourself. If you do harm or good, such actions will come back to you three
times, they believe.
Most believe in some form of reincarnation, however there is no concept of
heaven and hell or sin. Pagans believe magic and potions can help heal
others and themselves.
There is no pagan leader. For Wiccans, anyone can become a priest or
priestess (also called witches). Male priests are also called witches, not
warlocks. To pagans the star-shaped pentagram symbolizes all the elements of
nature - earth, air, fire, water and spirit.

Messages in this topic (1) 13. Faery tradition Posted by: &quot;Stevie Nicks Number One Fan&quot; irishfaeriewitch1@comcast.net wannabelikestevienicks Sat Aug 18, 2007 2:59 pm (PST) Among the distinguishing features of the Faery tradition is the use of a
Faery Power which characterizes the lineage. It is an ecstatic, rather than
a fertility, tradition. Strong emphasis is placed on sensual experience and
awareness, including sexual mysticism, which is not limited to heterosexual
expression. In this, as in the general spirit of spiritual exploration,
there is more risk-taking encouraged than in other Wiccan traditions which
may have specific laws limiting behavior, and there is a certain amorality
historically associated with the Tradition. We see ourselves, when enchanted
as &quot;fey&quot;--not black, not white, outside social definitions, on the road to
Faeryland, either mad or poetical. We are aware that much of reality is
unseen, or at least has uncertain boundaries. As in all the Craft, there is
a deep respect for the wisdom of Nature, a love of beauty, and an
appreciation of bardic and mantic creativity. The Gods are not just
constructs or psychological forces from the collective unconscious. The Gods
are real, with a system of morality different from our own, and we have a
responsibility to them. The Faery Tradition, in common with initiatory
lineages of the Craft which practice possession, is a mystery tradition of
power, mystery, danger, ecstacy, and direct communication with divinity.
This is in contrast to traditions which practice psychodrama or
psychotherapy through ritual. The negative side of this style of working is
that we have a lot of initiates who did not return unscathed from between
the worlds. The tradition is not for everybody, and it is not amenable to
mass attendance, like many Pagan paths.
There is a specific corpus of chants and liturgical material, much of it
stemming from Victor Anderson and Gwydion Pendderwen, which provides a frame
for many Circle-workings, and poetic creativity is highly valued. The
magical practices of the Faery (or Feri, as Victor spells it) Tradition are
heavily invocatory, to encourage possession, which relies mainly on psychic
talent or sensitivity to occur. Rites are stylistically diverse, and may
draw from many sources. There is an initiatory lineage, traceable to Victor
or Cora Anderson or Gwydion Pendderwen. Victor tells of antecedents of the
present tradition in the coven in which he was involved in the l920's and 30
s in Oregon. Hallmarks of the tradition are possession of secret names,
energy-working using pentacles and visualization of blue fire, a body of
poetic and liturgical material, deities and archetypes specific to the
Tradition, the doctrine of the Three Selves, a cingulum of a specific color,
a &quot;tribal&quot; or &quot;clan&quot; feel to the coven, the use of the horned (sometimes
called &quot;inverted&quot;) pentagram, and the honoring of a warrior ethic. For
example, we are urged not to coddle weakness, support others in
insincerities or self-deceptions, or to submit one's own Life force to
anyone or anything, which leads to a fierce openness called the &quot;Black Heart
of Innocence.&quot; The Faery Tradition is gender-equal, and all sexual
orientations seem able to find a niche. For many, there is a strong
identification with the realms of Faery and with shape-shifting.

Although Victor is universally recognized as the founding teacher of the
tradition, it is possible to identify influences which shaped the tradition
before its present form evolved. There is a strong African diasporic
influence, primarily Dahomean-Haitian, and the Three Selves theory is an
outgrowth of Huna beliefs. Neither is Victor the only source for material
presently within the tradition. Each initiate seems to draw the tradition in
a new direction and uncover new ground.. Some practitioners, such as Gwydion
and Eldri Littlewolf, went deeply into shamanic forms. Gwydion also worked
extensively with Celtic religion, even learning Welsh early in his Wiccan
training. Other influences (Arica, Tibetan meditation, and Ceremonial
Magick) entered as Gabriel Caradoc began teaching. Victor, Gwydion, Caradoc,
Brian Dragon and Paladin wrote darkly beautiful ritual poetry and liturgy.
Gabriel's classes provided an excellent training in magical visualization
and his students continue his teachings. Poet Francesca De Grandis and
songwriter Sharon Knight have added their inspiration to the corpus of
material. Starhawk has used concepts developed in the Faery Tradition in
expressing her beliefs and practice, and has given the clearest explanations
widely available of concepts such as the Three Selves or the Iron Pentacle.

Messages in this topic (1) 14a. Path of the Solitary Pagan Posted by: &quot;Stevie Nicks Number One Fan&quot; irishfaeriewitch1@comcast.net wannabelikestevienicks Sat Aug 18, 2007 2:59 pm (PST)

Path of the Solitary Pagan

Being a solitary practitioner in the world today can be somewhat daunting to
the beginner.
There is always comfort and safety in numbers and many people feel that
without a coven or some sort of group to study and practice with. They will
somehow not be able to achieve the things in their spirituality they wish.
Such thinking really needs to be banished from the minds of new
practitioners and even ones that have been studying for years, whether it is
in a group or alone. Many people's paths lead them down the solitary road
for many reasons.
Some have the need for secrecy, some do not have people they can feel
comfortable studying with, and some people just feel that they are meant to
walk their path in their own way and center on themselves.
None of these things should stop someone from fulfilling themselves, from
having the relationship they desire with their deities.
Many people question solitary practice and ask the questions &quot;Where will I
learn what I need?&quot; &quot;What if I do something wrong?&quot; With so many resources
out there in the world today all you need to do is go to a book store or
turn on a computer to find material to help you along your path.
There are many different texts to consult that will take you on various
journeys. The Goddess and God or whatever you call your deities certainly do
not look down on you for weaving your way though different paths and maybe
sometimes stumbling along the way. That is all a part of life. To learn and
be strong in who you are and what you do, these four basic steps may be
helpful.

Study
Thought
Prayer
Experimentation

These concepts I have found in Scott Cunninghams book Living Wicca. I think
they really do a good job of summing up a process that solitaries and even
coven members can use to explore their spirituality. These steps can apply
to any religion or path you may be on. They do not necessarily have to
spring from the Wiccan faith.
Study:
When you start on your path you are full of questions and sometimes it can
feel a little imposing. There are many good resources you can access by
going to your local bookstore, turning on your computer or even talking to
other pagans that you may know. A good thing to remember with all material
is not to take anything for absolute truth. There will be many different
books by many different authors and you may find very contradicting
information within them. Some books may be written for a various tradition
and have exact information regarding that tradition. That does not mean
that the only way that you can do a ritual or a spell is by following what
is in that one book. Something that I have made a point of doing in my
studies is to learn as much about all paths as I can and reading as much
material as I can. This would include the good and the bad. You will find
material out there that will tell you things that you know in your heart are
not true, or some may tell you things that just leave you feeling uneasy or
uncomfortable. If you find something like this, by all means look at it and
digest and then remember that it is something you do not want to follow or
believe. Something to look for are books written by people who are actually
on the path that they write about. There have been books and many websites
authored by people who think paganism is something negative or evil. They
will tell you all of the horror stories that have ever been associated with
the pagan religions and sometimes blatantly lie to you about what the pagan
paths represent. Do not be discouraged if you come across something like
this, just absorb it and file it in the back of your mind as an experience
and move on to more positive places and material. There are also books that
concentrate on negative magick or spells. You will find this type of thing
in books that concentrate on spells totally. Remember that spirituality is
not about getting something it is about inner peace and fulfillment. If you
come across something that seems to contain only things that are
self-serving. Use your common sense and pass by it.
Study is something that is a never-ending process. Everyone from the newest
practitioner to the person who has been practicing for many years will
always be able to find something new and has something to learn. If you come
across someone who says they have graduated to the highest level and that
they know all, beware. There is no such thing as someone who has mastered
paganism. It is a lifelong journey and a learning experience that will never
end.
Thought:
Reading and exploring can take you a long way in your spirituality but the
next step you must do is to actually think about what you have read. You
need to stop and digest everything that you have come across and decide what
information you will keep as valid to what you are doing and what
information you need to discard because it is not right for you. Just
because you decide to discard information or certain rituals in your own
studies does not make them invalid for others. Remember that not everyone is
traveling the same path and that no one has the absolute answer or knows the
end place that you get to. Everyone travels their own road and no one is the
voice of the Gods.
Thought and questioning go hand in hand. Many times people find it hard to
actually question what they have learned. They figure if it was printed in a
book or on website then it must be absolute truth as is. In society today we
are taught not to question things. Modern schooling frowns on questioning
and likes everyone to learn one standard of doing things and one way of
thinking. This type of thought process is not going to work for you in
obtaining spiritual growth. What is a good way to cast a circle to one may
leave someone else feeling very empty and cold. If you see something and it
does not give you that special spark or makes your mind frown, throw it away
File it in your mind as something you will not use.
Do not worry about being &quot;right or wrong&quot; when you go though your mind and
ask questions. Most things have no right or wrong answer. There is no right
answer to how you feel. It's only right if it's right to you. Questions on
reincarnation, divination, the aspects of deity, and many other issues
should be sorted out in your mind at this point and examined. Never think
you have to come to some absolute answer right away if ever. Sometimes
searching for these answers is part of our learning process and can ...
