"/> Try pure lemon oil. Put some on a rag and apply liberaly to your wood
furniture and then(this is the key to lemon oil)with a clean rag try to
remove all the lemon oil. Eventualy you will return to the clean original
shine and any scratches or chips will have a coat of lemon oil and NOT some
water based cleaner.

I wil probably catch some static for this but here goes....
Lemon oil is crap!!!
All it is, is a mineral oil with a scent, it has NO magical qualities
becuse of the lemon, but mineral oil does have a slight cleaning effect (
it is good for cleaning your hands). The Antique Wizard is right that it
is important to remove ALL traces of the oil. The biggest problem is that
people truly believe that oil, be it lemon, linseed or whatever, has some
ability to &quot;feed&quot; finishes and &quot;feed&quot; wood. It does not. It is chemically
impossible.
It is important to remember that when cleaning the surface of a piece of
furniture, tou are not cleaning wood, you are cleaning that very thin
surface coating (finish) be it shellac, nitrocellulose, urushi, or even
(yuk) polyurethane.
A better understanding of what you are cleaning is important before any
recommendations can be given.
However, I can say that aqueous solutions (water based) are just as
important as solvent based ones. There many different types of dirt and
grime, some that only water and a soap can move, some that only solvents
can move.
Many people tout &quot;Murphy's Oil Soap&quot; which is fine, but it, too, has no
magical effects. It also has some alcohol in it, so be careful with some
finished (shellac etc).
The simplest way to clean furniture coatings is a low odor minerals
spirits, followed by a MILD soap(not detergent) and water solution (&lt;5%),
then a high quality paste wax(my favorite is &quot;Beatue&quot;).
This very basic and I strongly advise caution, If you have a very old and
valuable antique, consult a professional about that particular piece.

Am I in trouble now???

[Jon]&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bit of a generalisation here, as early and
primitive/country furniture did *not* have any surface coating,
just good old wax and or oils. When the wood dries out, the cells
become porus and are able to be filled or 'fed' with more wax or
oil, and the surface can be shone to a mirror finish with a soft
brush.

PS My first reply this year, as I and the whole family have had 'flu
since Christmas. Sorry, I didn't respond to the metalware questions
posted recently.

"/> Yeah, you've got to be careful with any cleaning/waxing/polishing product
... some contain alcohol, which may cause problems with shellac-based
finishes, some may contain abrasives ( particularely some metal-cleaners
that one might try on furniture hardware, for example) that can dull or
damage the finish, while still others may contain other solvents that can
effect a variety of finishes. Butcher's wax is really great stuff, but it
contains turpentine, which does a super job cleaning and removing old built
up grease and grim and wax, but, as you note, can also soften and damage
certain other finishes. Many &quot;good&quot; waxes contain some kind of solvent,
since in their natural form natural waxes are a tough, durable solid mass.
The solvent dissolves the wax so you can spread it in a thin layer and when
the solvent evaporates, the wax reverts back to the hard durable material
again, but in a thin protective film over the surface. You really have to
know what finish is on the piece, then know what solvents are in the
product and be sure that the two are compatible. MOST commercial products
have a cautionary statement that advises of finishes known to be
incompatible (like Butcher's wax and asphalt tile) and advise that you try
it in an inconspicuous place first ... Good advice.

The only accepted means of added protection on historic furniture is wax,
a good quality blend of beeswax and carnauba, preferably in an emulsion
form.
Proper use of the materials is highly recommended.
Daily maintanence should only consist of dusting in which Endust is
recommended.
The person who said that lemon oil was a godsend because of wax has merely
created what we call the &quot;illusion of gloss&quot;, the oil has masked the
improperly applied wax,
