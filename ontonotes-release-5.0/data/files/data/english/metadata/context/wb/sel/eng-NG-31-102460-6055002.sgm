The Military Commissions Act of 2006: A Short Primer
Part One of a Two-Part Series
&lt; http://writ.lp.findlaw.com/mariner &gt;By JOANNE MARINER
----
Monday, Oct. 09, 2006

Ten days ago, by a vote of 65 to 34, Congress
passed the
&lt; http://news.lp.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/terrorism/mca2006.pdf &gt;Military
Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA). To facilitate the
prosecution of detainees that the Bush
Administration "disappeared" into secret CIA
custody for several years, Congress created a
system of justice that is far inferior to that of
the federal courts and courts-martial. And not
only did Congress give the Administration much of
what sought in terms of substandard justice, it
also allowed the Administration to pack the bill
with a grab-bag of unnecessary and abusive measures.

With ten separate sections, a few hundred
provisions, and thirty-eight pages of fine print,
the military commissions bill is complicated and,
in a few areas, unclear. Its concrete impact will
be assessed in what will no doubt be a long
series of court cases that will end up in the Supreme Court.

What follows is a first stab at interpreting the
scope and meaning of this exceedingly harmful bill.

What the MCA Does Not Do

A number of commentators have criticized the MCA
for authorizing the indefinite detention of
people deemed to be "unlawful enemy combatants."
Yet, unlike the Administration's initial
proposals, the bill does not explicitly address
detention. While it does nothing to stop the
Administration from holding people indefinitely
on Guantanamo and elsewhere, the bill does not
explicitly sanction the practice. And, according
to the bill's text, its definition of "unlawful
enemy combatant" only specifically applies to its
rules on military commissions.

It is nonetheless utterly predictable that the
Administration will seek to use the law for the
purpose of justifying its detention practices. In
light of the Supreme Court's ruling in
&lt; http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=542&amp;inv... &gt;Hamdi
v.
Rumsfeld&lt; http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=542&amp;inv... &gt;
(which recognized the government's power to
detain enemy combatants for the duration of
wartime hostilities), the Administration will
claim that the MCA implicitly grants authority to
the government to detain those who fall within
the bill's ridiculously overbroad definition of "unlawful enemy combatant."

The courts should emphatically reject this
argument. Without a clear statement of
congressional intent to authorize the indefinite
detention of such a broad category of people,
such a position should not lightly be presumed.
Any court faced with the question should be
guided by the long line of Supreme Court
decisions that have held that explicit
congressional authorization is required when
restrictions on basic rights are imposed.

Definition of "Unlawful Enemy Combatant"

With a bill as pernicious as this one, it is
difficult to settle on a single worst provision.
The restrictions on the right of habeas corpus
probably qualify, but the bill's overbroad
definition of "unlawful enemy combatant" runs a close second.

Under the first prong of the provision, an
"unlawful enemy combatant" is defined as a person
"who has engaged in hostilities or who has
purposefully and materially supported hostilities
against the United States or its
co-belligerents," and who is not a lawful
combatant. It would cover someone who provided
funds to al Qaeda or the Taliban knowing that the
funds would be used to fight against the U.S.
(including, given the bill's apparent
understanding of terrorism as a form of
hostilities, funds that are used for terrorist attacks in the U.S.).

The material support element of the first prong
of the definition - which covers people who have
purposefully and materially supported hostilities
- exceeds the traditionally-accepted legal
definition of combatant. Under international
humanitarian law - the laws of war - combatants
are people who directly participate in
hostilities. People who merely support
hostilities - such as cafeteria workers at a
military base - are considered civilians. Unlike
combatants, they cannot be deliberately targeted for attack.

The first prong of the bill's definition is
unjustifiably broad. But the second prong of the
definition is far worse. It appears to delegate
to the President or Secretary of Defense
unrestricted power to deem anyone an unlawful
enemy combatant. All it requires is that a
"competent tribunal" like a Combatant Status
Review Tribunal (CSRT) make the determination.
(CSRTs are the administrative boards that review
detentions at Guantanamo.) The bill itself says
nothing about the substance of the criteria that the tribunal should apply.

The definition as a whole is thus so radically
overbroad that one is tempted to attribute its
breadth to a drafting error (perhaps it was
originally written as a two-part test, not two
independent prongs). At any rate, as written, the
provision should be struck down as a blatantly
unconstitutional delegation of power. And note,
in assessing the provision's scope, that the
definition of "unlawful enemy combatant" is not
limited to aliens (even though U.S. citizens
cannot be tried by military commissions, and are
not covered by the bill's habeas-stripping provisions).

Military Commission Proceedings

The bill provides that alien unlawful enemy
combatants (but not U.S. citizens) are subject to
trial by military commission. As the text of the
bill explains, the military commissions that it
authorizes are regularly constituted courts,
"affording all the necessary 'judicial guarantees
which are recognized as indispensable by
civilized peoples' for purposes of common Article
3 of the Geneva Conventions." That is, if saying so is enough to make it so.

The bill's different treatment of citizens and
aliens reflects political calculations, not legal
ones. As the U.K. House of Lords found in 2004 in
ruling against indefinite detention, such a
distinction cannot be justified under international law.

Military commissions consist of at least five
commissioned military officers, and are presided
over by a military judge. In cases in which death
is a possible penalty, the commissions must include at least twelve officers.

The defendant is presumed innocent and his guilt
must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
Convictions require a two-thirds affirmative vote
of those commission members present at the time
of the vote. Sentences of more than ten years
require a three-quarters affirmative vote. The
imposition of the death penalty requires a unanimous vote.

The defendant has the right to represent himself.
Otherwise, he will have military counsel and, if
he chooses, civilian counsel as well. Civilian
counsel must be U.S. citizens eligible for access
to classified information deemed Secret.

Rules of evidence and procedure

The Secretary of Defense is authorized to
prescribe procedures and rules of evidence beyond
those that are set out in the bill. These
procedures/rules can vary from their
courts-martial equivalents as long as the
Secretary finds that it is impracticable to abide by courts-martial standards.

Statements obtained under torture are
inadmissible as evidence. Yet statements obtained
under coercion (including cruel treatment) are
admissible under certain circumstances.

Different rules apply for statements obtained
pre- and post- December 30, 2005 (the date of the
enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA)).
If a coerced statement was obtained before the
DTA was enacted, it is admissible if the judge
finds it to be "reliable and possessing
sufficient probative value," and if he believes
that its admission would serve the interests of
justice. Coerced statements taken after the DTA
was enacted are, in addition, not admissible if
the interrogation methods used to obtain them violate the DTA.

In an important improvement upon the rules that
the Administration originally sought, the
defendant must be allowed to examine and respond
to any evidence seen by the commission. If
classified information that the government does
not want to reveal to the defendant is needed for
prosecution, an unclassified summary can be used.
But, in addition, although the defendant's
general right to exculpatory evidence is
acknowledged, he is only granted an "adequate
substitute" for classified exculpatory information.

Hearsay is admissible as long as the judge finds
it to be reliable and the defendant gets advance
warning. Evidence obtained without a search warrant is also admissible.

Protecting "Sources, Methods, or Activities"

The bill includes a number of provisions that
protect classified "sources, methods, or
activities" against being revealed. The likely
impact of such provisions is to bar any inquiry
into the CIA's abusive interrogation practices.
(For sources, substitute "disappeared" detainees;
for methods, substitute torture, and for
activities, substitute water-boarding, stress
positions, and days without sleep.)

The bill specifies, for example, that during the
discovery phase, the judge may protect classified
"sources, methods, or activities" from
disclosure. It also provides that reliable
evidence obtained via classified "sources,
methods, or activities" is admissible, even
though the sources/methods/activities themselves
are protected from disclosure. Finally, it states
that the public may be excluded from proceedings
in order to protect information whose disclosure
would damage national security, including
information on "intelligence or bill enforcement
sources, methods, or activities."

Appeals

Guilty verdicts are automatically referred to a
Court of Military Commission Review (each panel
of which consists of at least three appellate military judges).

The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has
exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the
military commission process. The court's review
is limited to examining: 1) whether the decision
complied with the procedures, etc., set out in
the bill, and 2) whether, "to the extent [they
are] applicable," the decision is consistent with
the U.S. Constitution and laws.

"To the extent [they are] applicable" - that's another kicker.

Crimes Triable by Military Commission

The MCA states that it does not create any new
crimes, but simply codifies offenses "that have
traditionally been triable by military
commissions." This provision is meant to convince
the courts that there are no ex post facto
problems with the offenses that the bill lists.
In
&lt; http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/05-184.html &gt;Hamdan
v. Rumsfeld, however, a plurality of the Supreme
Court (four justices) found that conspiracy--one
of the offenses enumerated in the MCA--was not a
crime triable by military commission. The bill's
statement that conspiracy is a traditional war
crime, does not, by legislative fiat, make it so.

Section 950v of the MCA names and defines 28
specific crimes that are triable by military
commission. Besides conspiracy, they include
murder of protected persons, murder in violation
of the bill of war, hostage-taking, torture,
cruel or inhuman treatment, mutilation or
maiming, rape, sexual abuse or assault,
hijacking, terrorism, providing material support for terrorism, and spying.

Notably, the crime of "murder by an unprivileged
belligerent" is not listed, although a number of
Guantanamo detainees were charged with that
offense during earlier military commission
proceedings, and the offense was included in the
draft military commissions bill that the
Administration circulated in July. Murder by an
unprivileged belligerent--in other words, murder
committed by someone who does not have the right
under international humanitarian law to
participate in hostilities--has never been a
criminal offense under international law, so
Congress was wise not to include it as an offense in the new bill.

The Rest

Unfortunately, the military commissions bill
doesn't end there. In my next column, I'll
describe provisions that attempt to render the
Geneva Conventions unenforceable in court,
immunize CIA personnel for past abuses, and bar
detainees from asserting their right to habeas corpus. Among other things …
