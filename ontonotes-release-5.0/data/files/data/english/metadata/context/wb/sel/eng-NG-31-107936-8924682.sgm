For the purposes of this ignore strategic situations politics,
resources, timing etc.

Imagine that the US had considerably reduced design and production
capability and the BE (not just the UK)
had correspondingly more.

What British aeroplanes would have gone into production that did not
actually make it?
What US ones would have been dropped?
What British ones would the US have aquired on a form of reverse Lend-
Lease?

I would like to think that maybe some of the latter British types
would have entered service like the Vampire, Spiteful, Sea Fang,
Hornet, Sea Fury, MB.5, and some of the Vickers ultra heavy bombers
(Windsor probably would have been dropped anyway).

SNIP:
&gt;Quite a stretch, considering the Guggenheim tech institutes and the vast automobile construction plants (and production know-how) the US possessed.
&gt;&gt;Considering some of the losers that did make it into production in the BE - Albemarle, Albacore, Brigand, Firebrand, Barracuda, OZ's Wirraway - the BE had considerable capacity and wasted a significant amount of it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Question - what was the BE equivalent of the US's War Production Board? And what a good thing it was that Germany didn't have one . . .
">

Several 'British Requests' did reach service, including the Mustang,
Havoc, Martin's Maryland and Baltimore.
Spitfire with producibility changes comes immediately to mind. A
simpler main wing spar and more fuel are obvious changes. IMHO this
would have superseded the Mustang. This might have caused Curtiss to
make Spits which would have been a much greater contribution than
hordes of P40s. Packard did make a lot of Merlins, too.
Since BE had no viable day bombers the US would have made their own.
Same goes for trainers, cargo, carrier and patrol planes.
Mosquito, maybe. Closest equivalent we had was probably the B26. But
US had little experience in plywood aircraft construction and lacked
the 'farm club' of woodcrafters. Yes, we had one (1) plywood twin-
engine trainer and the gliders, but only due to the relative dearth of
aluminum.

If things had been truly reversed, I wonder what impact that would
have had on British development of their jet since a much greater
production of both conventional piston aircraft types that were
operational before WW2 and latter types that would now be produced in
numbers would seem to lessen RAF interest in developing a jet fighter.

Imagine huge numbers of Hurricanes, Spitfires and Spitefuls, MB.5s,
Mosquitos, Hornets, Sea Furys, Typhoons, Tempests, and Seafangs- with
the British doing lend-lease!

What valid reason would there be to develop a British jet fighter?
Spitefuls, MB.5s, and Hornets could catch V-1 s with ease.

Interesting question, which I mostly &quot;answer&quot; with more questions...

I'd venture that a notional production-handicapped US would have done
well to concentrate on  what it did unequivocally better than any
others: tactical naval aircraft with the range and durability for
carrier operations (at least one type of multirole fighter and one
type each of both dive and torpedo bombers); a heavy bomber suitable
for ETO daylight operations (B-24 if we can figure out how to produce
it -- maybe the baroque manner in which it was manufactured, like an
early false start on Airbus, could have been streamlined); an escort
for it (the P-51 gets the nod there, able to do the job of the others
at less cost in resources); and the  B-29.     Making room for the
C-46, C-47, and the best of the mediums (say a B-26, hopefully with an
improved wing earlier) might have been a good idea for the ETO as
well.

This assumes that in the alternate history we are able to achieve
quality and innovation as we did, but for whatever reason are unable
to achieve the production volume.  (The agility and effectiveness with
which the US economy was put onto a war footing was itself a
remarkable achievement and a great contribution to the Allied effort,
though attributing victory to it is an all too common sophistry.  If
it hadn't succeeded, you end up with a different war.)    If instead
you mean that we prove unable to produce satisfactory front-line
aircraft at all and must import them, things get a lot logistically
messier, especially if it leaves us without a bomber that can carry
enough weight for enough distance, survivably, to deliver the A-bomb.
It becomes hard to figure out how to conduct the  Pacific campaigns as
well (especially the island hopping one)  without more or less the
number and kind of planes that we had there -- not only for attack,
but force protection and interdiction of Japanese logistics and
reinforcement.

I find those hard to ignore -- how does one separate strategic
situations from the kind of war being fought at a given place and
time, or separate resources from the ability to build and operate
aircraft?  Two questions in particular really can't be ignored:

1.  At any given stage of this alternate scenario, does the fight
against the U-boats go at least as well as it really did?  Huge
implication for how you Brits get supplies and parts, and whether the
fruits of your labor can realistically go anywhere but to the MTO/ETO
without huge losses en route.

2.  Is the US still able to produce  things other than airplanes the
way we did, including the ships with which to move those things  to
the war fronts, as well as warships of all kinds (including
carriers?)   Here -- especially in the context of the Pacific war --
remember all the other ships (and their cargoes) that you need if your
objective is invasion rather than mere raids and blockades.  The US
contribution to the war was not just power but unprecedented feats of
power projection.

All in all, it would have been a much different war -- not only in
conduct but perhaps in definitions of victory.  With drastically lower
US productivity *and*  the  ability to get the fruits of it forward,
separately negotiated peace with Germany and Japan, after some
rollback of their geographical progress,  might have become a
realistic alternative to complete unequivocal victory.  (Whether the
Soviets, with Klaus Fuchs having shown them the royal road to the A-
bomb's geometry, would have revisited the issue in the late 40s is
another question entirely!)
