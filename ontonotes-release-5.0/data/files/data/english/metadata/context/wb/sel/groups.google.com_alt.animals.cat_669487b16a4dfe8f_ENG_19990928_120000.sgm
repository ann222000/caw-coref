Hello there, I have a Burmilla Silverpoint named Sprouts who wakes up every
morning at 5 o clock and yowls. It's a very trivial problem but it's driving
me up the wall as I can't get back to sleep. Does anyone know any way of
making sure he sleeps through the night? Thankyou Daniel

My 1 1/2 yr. old male tom, Mischief, does it every night as I try to go to
sleep. I've tried everything. Keeping him awake all day is about the only
thing that has succeeded, but then he's awake at 4:30 in the morning. (Which
isn't too bad on weekdays when I have to go to work.) So either tire
Sprouts out completely and keep the apartment/house as dark as possible
until you get up, which also means keep the apartment/house light completely
until you turn in for the night. Or segregate him, so you don't hear him.
Place him in an area of the house/apartment where you won't really hear him.
(I put Mischief in the bathroom in my little apartment, with his litter pan,
food and water dishes, and a few toys.) Do not get up for him! You will
only be reinforcing the whole situation.

Obviously, his internal clock is off with the external one you live with.

::blink:: You shut your cat in the bathroom at night??

There is nothing you can do to make a cat &quot;sleep through the night&quot;.
You're right about not responding to the cat when it meows in the
morning because it does only reinforce the behavior pattern.

But I certainly don't recommend locking them in a segment of the house
at night, unless you want to put them outside for the entire night. I
don't think shutting them in a small space for hours on end is a good
thing, particularly when they have the freedom to roam the entire home
during the day.

Learn to live with the yowling for a while and ignore the cat at 5:00
am. Eventually it will either stop the behavior or you will learn to
sleep through it.

Hai,

I had the same problem with my cat, eventually she got used to my daily
habits and now she won't give a sound until about 7 when I normally get up.
But it took some time for our schedules to allign and for a month or 2 I
have been tired during the day because of my darling cat. She got used to
be active when I am and quiet when it is dark by now.

I helped her develop these new habits by

a) removing all her toys during the night. Make sure she has no impulses to
get &quot;active&quot;. However she has food but in a place far from my bedroom and
plenty to get her through the night. so she has nothing to complain about
either.

b) Also I make sure she is more active during the day. I have locked the
room with her favorite sleeping place (My bed) during the day. This has
severely reduced her possibilities to get an extended period of rest during
the day.

c) and I play with her every evening a few hours before she has to quiet
down. Not to close to the time I want her to be quiet though.

d) The last thing I did was be nice to her when I got up on my one and
ignore her if she was a the one waking me up.

I wish you luck and am sure you can solve the problem

Angelique

when I first got my little angels/devils (have yet to decide...), when I
would shut them out of the bedroom at night, they mewed and pawed at the
door. I would ignore them, leaving the apartment (including my bedroom)
quiet and dark. Eventually, they realized that I was not coming back out.
Now, they might mew once or twice, but then they're off down the hall and
wrestling with each other.

But they *have* caught on to the fact that I feed them first thing in the
morning. If I try to sleep past 7am, they're at my door to wake me up.
It's actually cute. :)

I agree.

I have a moggie, who after shifting into my new place, persistently
scratched at the wardrobe mirror at between 3.30 and 4.00 each morning for
about three weeks. I stupidly would get up to let her out and half an hour
later she would want to come back in. These days when she does it, I might
wake up, roll over and go back to sleep. Nine times out of ten she will get
the message and go back to sleep too until I am ready to wake up properly at
a more reasonable hour in the morning.

Hubby and myself have two female mutt cats, sisters 2 1/2 years old.
They both have slept with us since we got them at 8 weeks. They have
learned not to make too much noise if they get up during the night, as
that wakes us up and we are not happy. The leader has learned that I
will feed them immediately when I get up, but not to bother me until she
sees at least one eyelid open. If she pesters me before that, she gets
shoved off the bed. They have actually learned that I like to sleep late
on the weekends and sometimes let me. Amazing how good they are.

Hello Daniel,

Your cat, as far as the cat is concerned, has slept through the night.
My cat has been doing this for years, it is a bad habit and as I'm not
very disciplined, I let him especially since I get my husband to get up
and feed the two of them (only one wakes us up).

If you want to train the cat out of this, simply close the door to your
bedroom each and every time the cat yowls (with the cat outside the
bedroom). Hope this helps; it can't hurt and is has worked for me in
the past.

Good luck, Sandy.

Judith,

I'm just curious why you put the cat in the bathroom instead of just
closing your bedroom door?

Sandy.
