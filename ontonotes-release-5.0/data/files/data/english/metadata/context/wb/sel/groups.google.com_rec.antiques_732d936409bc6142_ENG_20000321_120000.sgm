&gt; Dear all --

&gt; I am a collector of Russian tea urns (samovars) -- wood-fired, brass but

(to
&gt; boil water for tea at picnics, etc). I'm worried about the possibility of

me
&gt; to some authoritative information on the subject of safety testing antique
&gt; metalware.

&gt; Like I said earlier, these objects were generally tin lined, and made of
&gt; brass. How can I test the lining for lead? Will normal swab tests do, or
&gt; should I be worried about testing the water after boiling as well (i.e.
will

&gt; I'm not sure how real these questions are, but any light you might be able

I know we've been here before but this always winds me up. What is it
with you folks and lead poisoning????

You could drink or eat from items containing lead a billion times and
they would not significantly harm you. One deep breath in a city centre
would give you as much lead content and far more besides.

Many water supplies in the UK are still via lead pipes (ours is) and
there is no significant risk factor. In fact one of our biggest problems
is natural radiation entering houses from a particular type of bedrock.

Acidic food and drink in copper and brass can cause poisoning, however
and these items should always be tin lined.

When did this lead scare get out of hand....and why?? I suppose it is
the same people who happily smoke and eat fatty foods all day who are
worried about lead poisoning?

TIN is not LEAD, for starters, and tinning things should not
require solder. Just don't serve lemonade from them ... the acid
leaches out the metal, and even tin can taste bad and upset
stomachs.

Jon, IMHO I think it is all the do-gooders
that should get a real job. This country also had ALL lead pipes when
our parents were growing and I don't feel or suspect
that they were all mentally retarded. I was in a hardware store one day
listening to a
lady asking how to get rid of the lead paint in the house she just
bought. She seemed so concerned, I asked her if she bought the house
from the original owners, she said she did. I then asked her if they had
died from lead poisoning. She just stared at me and said they were still
living. Duh!
DO-gooders and lawyers that is what runs our country.

I thank everyone for their comments.

Although I understand there are those who are not worried about
lead-poisoning, since I am writing a book about using Samovars, and the
American FDA (I live in the US) has issued warnings about lead risks in all
manner of old cookware (mugs, crystal, and pewter and brass), I have to take
it seriously, &quot;do gooder&quot; or no. I love these pieces not as relics, but as
everyday items, yet I have to reassure readers, if nothing else, and to do
that I have to be informed.

And, yeah, lead poisoning does sound nasty.

Fortunately, from what I've digested so far (no pun intended), the issue
with samovars would seem quite remote. Obviously, you start with a hardware
store rubbing test. If that doesn't reveal lead, and the item is tinned
more or less properly, I wouldn't say there's a threat -- BECAUSE Samovars
are used to *boil water*, not *steep tea.* Since water has no acid, I doubt
anything will leach anywhere. I personally wouldn't steep tea or serve wine
or lemonade out of the things, because that's a barbarism for the purist
(I'm really more of a snob than a do-gooder). Now however I am more worried
about the tea pots on Samovars (they were often equipped with brass teapots
on top), and my teapots in general, since they will be exposed to strong tea
and high acid levels. I'll be thinking about it.

Any responses to this judgement? Does it seem sound? By the way, Jon, is
there an FAQ about lead on this list, since it has come up before? Where do
I find it? I'm still looking for authoritative information. Thanks!

John

PS: As for lead water pipes in Britain: The Romans had lead too, of course,
and they built a huge empire -- before falling prey to rampant eccentricity
and a love of histrionics. Something about fallen empires?

living in was one of the oldest in our area ( 1798-1810) and chock full
of lead paint, every time the forced air furnace kicked in the lead dust
came out the vent by her crib, plus she had been caught chewing paint
chips. When they finally gave into my brother's demands and tested her
the lead level were the highest they had seen in 10 years. She is
currently on intravenous chelation therapy to remove the lead, but the
levels of lead are slow to go down, so they retest her every month.

my cadmium levels checked ;~)))

manufacturers coat the wire with a very thin layer of white lead
before applying the insulation. None of the cases were so extreme as

Same here... and our water department recommends against getting a water
softener as it would dissolve the mineral deposits and allow lead to
leach out of the solder again. Three years ago, several homes failed the
test for lead in the water in our neighborhood - this year, everyone
passed (or so they tell me). &lt;grin&gt;

Have fun, Michele

"/> Several years ago I worked for an environmental engineering consultant who was
conducting an investigation for the local water company. It seemed that a
large number of upscale housing developments in a previously unincorporated
area had blue water coming from all the taps. There was a higher than normal
copper level, but everything else was normal. I don't remember all of the more
technical aspects, but the final explanation for the blue water also explains
one reason that lead pipes don't leach into the water.
Tap water contains microscopic benign organisms (I can't remember their
technical name, but it contains &quot;rotifer&quot;) which attach to the insides of
pipes coating them like barnacles and feeding on minerals and such as they
pass by. These little guys had evolved to become immune to the chlorine which
was used to purify the water, however, the utility had recently changed from
chlorine to chloramine which had killed all of them off. The service to the
new development had all new copper pipes which were not being coated with
these little crustaceans, and so the copper was still leaching into the water.
I'm not sure what they did about the blue water, but I did learn that not all
crust is bad, and if you're working on old lead pipes, don't scrape all the
crust off the inside, or it may start to leach into your water
