James said he was the only one that read a survival guide on his
tribe.

We could tell there were no backwoodsmen types out there, but it's
still shocking that so many people didn't do even the most basic
preparation for what they knew would be a grueling experience.

That's the problem - they don't *know* it will be grueling. Most of
these players are recruited and have never actually seen an episode of
Survivor. All they are concerned about is getting &quot;exposure&quot; (and not
Dave's kind of exposure).

That's also why most of the post-Palau seasons have been so bad -
recruited players who don't care about the game.

Remember season #1 when the players couldn't even figure out the idea of
alliances and only one player could manage to catch food from the sea?
Remember season #2 when the players were so outdoorsy that they built camp
in a riverbed, had it wash away along with all their food and fishing gear?
Remember season #3 when the dominating group just slept all day, did zero
camp work, and it took a 'twist' of the game rules to stop them from owning
the game?

People that watch every episode of this game still have next to zero
understanding of the conditions.  It is easy to talk about making a fire in
boyscouts, but it is far different to start a fire with wet bamboo when you
are tired and hungry.  It is far different to actually sleep outside in the
dirt for 8 hour while it is raining.  It is different to actually go days
without more than a few hundred calories of food and no air conditioning and
nothing to even sit down on that isn't wet, poking, or biting.  It is
different to have to perform at your physical peak while being dehydrated,
hungry, tired, and stressed.

So, the first season contestants should have somehow seen Survivor before?

The early 3-4 seasons established the game. By season 4-5, players were
*aware* of the type of game they were getting into. Things started
regressing after Palau.

I agree with that. But it doesn't change the fact that these players
haven't watched the game, and don't have even the first clue what they
are getting into.

There's a difference between not being &quot;outdoorsy&quot;, not preparing, and
just not caring.

I disagree with your claim that they have not watched the game.  Consider
the first few boots:
Chicken clearly knew the game and was making a very controlled effort to

Leslie has watched every season and applied for most of them.  Her doom was

Wasn't there very little lead day between selection and game play in the
early days? I always got the impression that they didn't have time to do
very much preparation.

Later, the contestants started showing some signs that they were
preparing before they applied. Then, of course, came the recruited, and
no one bothered to prepare.

Leslie and Dave:  proof that people can't change their personalities just
because they want to be careful.
Jean-Robert and James are likely talking for hours every day.  What we saw
was that 5 minutes worth of it was overheard.  A big mistake, but hardly
something that 'prepared players' could easily avoid.  Courtney had the
hands to prove that there was reason for whining.  Still, she never did stop
trying and that should be worth something.

I'm always amazed that no one in the game (season after season) knows
how to make a fire without matches. If I was applying for this show and
got my first call back I'd be outside practicing everyday. I'd be
kidnapping* boy scouts and making them teach me all their scouting
knowledge (e.g. how to tie knots). I'd be at the pool and practicing my
swimming and (duck) diving. I'd be searching the internet for any hint
as to where the season is going to be filmed and looking up survival
specifics for the area (e.g. what plants you can eat, what plants you
can use as a pest repellent).

* Of course this is just hyperbole, I wouldn't really kidnap anyone.

I said the same thing for quite a few seasons then looked at a few websites

it's next to impossible with the driest of wood- forget about it with wet

&quot;Next to impossible&quot;, give me a break. Generations of boy scouts have
been building fires by &quot;rubbing two sticks together&quot;, we're talking
pre-teens and kids in the early teens doing it. I never said it was easy
and if you don't know what you're doing it's extremely difficult -- but
that's the point, no one knows what they are doing. What I'm
consistently amazed at is that (it appears) no one on the show has ever
done it (even in ideal conditions) before. I've seen scenes where it
looks like some of them have read how to do it but the first time they
are trying it is on the show!

It's difficult, but there is no good reason why they don't have fire
their first night there. Except no one bothers to learn how to build a
fire before they get there.

Swedish I believe, but I'm not sure if Hatch actually had a chance to
watch the show Survivor was based on or only read up on it before
S1.  Either way, he was the only player to know what it was about
before going in and I think that played a major role in his victory.

Thou even at the very end after the players had been there 30-some

Using a fire-bow is hard to do and will take a long time but it's not
impossible if one starts with the right materials and fabricates them
in the proper manner and this can be easily learned from a survival
guide.

Flint &amp; steel (not the magnesium fire starter JP gives the tribes) is
very easy to use to get a fire going (I've actually done this when I
was a Boy Scout) but the trick is finding the correct type of stone
to generate sparks.

Before attempting Survivor, I'd read up and at least practice making

After all they have made much of &quot;outwit, outlast, outplay&quot;, which

Exactly.  Anyone that has watched the show would understand that Survivor is
not simply a game about making fire, building a shelter, and killing some
food.

I don't mean that being a good Boy Scout is an end in itself, but it
helps your team remain strong to win challenges, and raises your stock
with your team mates.

Hardly but surely it should have been obvious that one needs help to
get other players out and that as long as it's not you or your friends
are getting voted out things are sweet? It's a VERY short step from
there to the idea of alliances.

Besides, in the early seasons MB was making a big deal about 'creating
a new society' and that should make it abundantly clear that
relationships ARE important!

My son is an avid Scout camper and has said all kinds of things about

our TV room around the time during the hour when he knew the

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm always amazed that no one in the game (season after season)
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; knows how to make a fire without matches.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I said the same thing for quite a few seasons then looked at a few

&gt;&gt;&gt; you'll realize it's next to impossible with the driest of wood-
&gt;&gt;&gt; forget about it with wet wood, which is what most tribes have dealt
&gt;&gt;&gt; with.

&gt;&gt; &quot;Next to impossible&quot;, give me a break. Generations of boy scouts have
&gt;&gt; been building fires by &quot;rubbing two sticks together&quot;, we're talking
&gt;&gt; pre-teens and kids in the early teens doing it. I never said it was easy
&gt;&gt; and if you don't know what you're doing it's extremely difficult -- but
&gt;&gt; that's the point, no one knows what they are doing.

&gt;Just wondering if you've ever started a fire in this manner using wood found
&gt;at random? Or if you've read any books/websites on starting fires? I looked
&gt;at several a while back and all involved building a little contraption with

There are many ways to do it, using a bow is probably the easiest, but
spinning a stick against a piece of wood with your hands is another. You
can also (which they've shown people trying) rub one stick quickly back
and forth against a piece of wood. The point is to generate enough heat
due to friction to get some fuel past it's flash point.

You can also use a pair of glasses if the sun is shining, you put a drop
of water on the lens to focus the light like you would with a magnifying
glass.

None of these methods is easy, which is why it takes practice. The
selection of materials (particularly the fuel) is critical.

If you want to see this in action, look for a show called Survivor Man,
I'm not sure if it's shown in the US or not.

Survivor has been around for seven or eight years now, thats an
impressive achievement regardless of whether their ratings are sliding
or not. It would be almost impossible for this type of show to maintain
or improve its ratings year after year. The huge hype a show like this
can generate can only be sustained for so long. Once the show is
established you have two conflicting issues to deal with, you have to
change it up to keep it &quot;fresh&quot; but you also have to keep it the same to
appease the hardcore fans.

While I will agree that casting is one of the most important aspects of
the show (i.e. getting the right people) I disagree that recruiting is
the problem (if there is one, which I don't concede that there is).
You're implying that just because someone applies to be on the show they
will be more entertaining to watch (i.e. a better contestant) than
someone who is asked to be on the show.

We can argue about individual choices made by the casting department,
but whether they applied or were recruited is besides the point.

And one of the really neat things that first summer was that nobody knew
what the thing was about.  I was busy for the first six weeks, and watched
it sporadically after that, but when it reran during the Olypmics that
fall, I watched very episode very carefully, and even took notes.

It wsa a very different show to be on tv.  That in itself made it
watchable.  And we hadn't seen it before, so it required watching
to see how it played out.

ANd just like the contestants that should be watching previous
games, we do know basically what will happen.  It's no longer a mystery.
There are relatively minor variants from time to time, but it is still
basically the same.

How much practice do you think it takes until you have it down? Think about
it, you've got maybe a few weeks between the time when you make it to the
final rounds of casting and the time when you depart. How would you spend
that time? I would:

1) Get my affairs in order for a 1 1/2 month absence
2) Train 2-3 hours a day (running, swimming, weights)
3) Rewatch and analyze every episode of Survivor
4) Study outdoor living
5) Study and hone manipulation techniques
6) Research and attempt to build fire with a couple sticks

Now on the last one, I'd try to do so with the same tools I'd expect to have
on the show (which means no glass). I'd have to spend a considerable amount
of time studying trees in the hope that once I was out there I could
identify the ones most likely to be effective for producing fire. Then I'd
give it a decent shot. By &quot;decent&quot; I mean I'd probably put in an hour here
and there trying but I wouldn't rip my hands to shreds particularly since I
know it's likely that one way or another we'd be given fire by day three.
All of this is the reason why I've rescinded my previous criticism of
players for not being able to build fire. It's not some simple task to learn
and it's really not even a high priority anymore.

I don't think that anyone will be able to give you a good answer to why
each season drops off for _you_, for hopefully obvious reasons. In
general I think it's just a matter that we've seen it all before, it's
not new, fresh and exciting. If they want to get some of the excitement
back they have to make some fundamental changes to the format of the
competition, not just reward challenge, immunity challenge, vote. How
about, as an example of what they could do, they mix it up a bit and
have some elimination challenges, where whoever finishes last is
eliminated instead of it just being a vote each week. We would see
things like people risking themselves to help their alliance members or
hampering the people who aren't.

Or how about start they season by splitting 20 people into 10 pairs (let
them pick) and then for four weeks the pairs compete and the losing pair
goes home. Then on week five pair up the remaining pairs up into three
teams. The next immunity challenge could involve four one-on-one-on-one
competitions with the loser of each competition being the four people at
risk of being voted out with everyone else voting. Or just the winning
four voting.

Just while I'm randomly thinking of things, I'm not a fan of splitting
the group onto tribes anyway, it just creates artificial alliances. How
about starting with everyone in one big group then for the first
challenge allow then to pick teams of four people each and the winning
tribe gets to go to their own private camp. Or in some other way let
them form their own alliances/tribes.

Myself I find the middle of the season to be the least interesting,
after the merge and one tribe is just picking off the other tribe. Those
are the least fun episodes, but it picks up again when the surviving
tribe members start eating their own. The only problem I have with the
first few episodes is that I don't know all the contestants yet, and
there is no real way around that...

That and the twists they keep bringing in, hidden immunity idols, exile
island, etc. they just seem hokey and for the most part don't do much to
affect the game. The have/have not twist was the worst but a simple
change would have made it a great twist -- give the tribe the choice
between comfort and immunity every week. This season's kidnapping twist
is pretty good, I hope they keep it up until the merge.

An experiment I'd like to see...

Start with just 12 people in one tribe, one camp.

No eliminations for the first few rounds, so the season lasts as long,
but we get a chance to 'know' people a little more.

The challenges would be for rewards that give lasting effects, and can
be shared with one or two other people, which confer an advantage in
forming early alliances.

I most enjoy the later episodes when people have to make decisions on
keeping or breaking their alliances. This idea would make
alliance-building an important feature from the beginning.

&gt; &gt; None of these methods is easy, which is why it takes practice. The
&gt; &gt; selection of materials (particularly the fuel) is critical.

&gt; How much practice do you think it takes until you have it down?
">

Not that much, three or four hours with instruction. The main thing is
the selection of the fuel.

&gt; Think about it, you've got maybe a few weeks between the time when
&gt; you make it to the final rounds of casting and the time when you
&gt; depart. How would you spend that time? I would:

&gt; 1) Get my affairs in order for a 1 1/2 month absence
">

That's going to take, what a couple of hours? Less if you're living with
people (e.g. a wife or husband) who can take care of the house, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) Train 2-3 hours a day (running, swimming, weights)
">

If you're not used to it that would be too much. You'd be breaking down
before you got to the show.

&gt; 3) Rewatch and analyze every episode of Survivor
">

This would probably be a poor use of time. Sure watch a season or two
but since the people and the specific situations you'll be in are
different it would only be a slight benefit. That, of course, assumes
you're a fan of the show. If you haven't seen it before the first thing
you to do is start watching the damn show.

A better show to look up and watch would be Survivorman.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4) Study outdoor living
">

There are survivalist groups in your area, look them up and join them.

Get a small tarp and live outdoors for a week or two. You might decide
you don't want to be on the show after all...  :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 5) Study and hone manipulation techniques
">

Read &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; and &quot;The Art of War&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 6) Research and attempt to build fire with a couple sticks
">

The survivalist group you've contacted in #4 will help you with that.
They'll also help you learn what kinds of thing you can and can't eat,
how to catch fish/small animals with limited equipment, how to build a
shelter, keep yourself warm, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now on the last one, I'd try to do so with the same tools I'd expect to have
&gt; on the show (which means no glass).
">

I'd practice it with glasses as well because it's the easiest (least
physical) incase someone on your tribe is wearing a pair of glasses.

You forgot to list the things that they actually do.

Hire an agent.
Reserve an internet domain name to match their name/nickname.
Get their teeth whitened.
Start going to a tanning booth.
Get most/all body hair waxed off.
Get massive Vitamin E shot in the hopes of warding off the bugs
Go swimsuit shopping.
Ask their friend (a former cast member) what the TV episodes don't show, but
will be helpful to know.
Check out internet gaming sites for possible future supplemental income.

But if they get a personal assistant after they get the agent (or maybe
even first) then some of the other tasks can be taken care of, or
at least streamlined.

The assistant could take care of the research too.

Those are all good ideas.

I like Denise but the only prep that SHE did was to get off from work
early the day before she had to leave for the show.

(Now...I hope she wins. :-)
