Yes he should. Let's don't forget however, that the Whites, and Aikmans
had the Tony Dorsetts, and Emmitt Smiths. Emmitt at one time had
the TD rushing record. The QB wasn't call upon to throw fantasy
football TD passes when we had those guys. Still though, great
and impressive accomplishment; we NEED him thrown all those TDs.

Yeah. Hard to believe that the team record for TD passes is 29, and
that that team has five Super Bowl wins, isn't it? Don't get too
preoccupied with statistics. This is the Dallas Cowboys we're talking
about. They'll never be held hostage as a vehicle for some individual
to rack up some meaningless stats.

It makes sense that a Super Bowl team would not have that many
touchdown passes because their attack is balanced between the run and
the pass as was pointed out in an earlier post
