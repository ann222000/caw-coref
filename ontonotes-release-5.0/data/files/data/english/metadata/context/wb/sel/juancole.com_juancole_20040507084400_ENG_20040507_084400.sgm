Al-Hayat : Special UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi had to delay his return
to Iraq because the Bush's decision to besiege Fallujah and kill 600
there in revenge for the killing of 4 private commandos. Now Brahimi is
back in the country, working to save Bush's skin, and the Americans have
greeted his arrival with military operations against a number of
southern Shiite cities aimed at reducing the power of the Army of the
Mahdi, the militia of Muqtada al-Sadr. The "password" for the beginning
of the new campaign was apparently Paul Bremer's appointment of a new
governor for Najaf, Adnan al-Durufi, who is a follower of Grand
Ayatollah Ali Sistani, after a convocation of 150 local Shiite notables
had condemned Muqtada al-Sadr. Bremer emphasized that the Coalition
would not back down in its determination to disarm the followers of
Muqtada, the Army of the Mahdi, and to ensure that Muqtada himself
stands trial in the murder on April 9, 2003, of cleric Abdul Majid Khoei
in Najaf. Bush himself affirmed recently that the Iraqis themselves
would have to take care of al-Sadr.

American forces advanced Thursday on key strategic targets in Kufa,
Karbala, and the environs of Najaf, where violent clashes broke out.
This in the wake of the US dispatch to the south of large numbers of
reinforcements. The political offices of Muqtada al-Sadr in the heart of
Karbala were razed. The outskirts of Kufa witnessed major battles, and
loud explosions were heard near Najaf. The US army also announced that
it had undertaken four military operations on Wednesday night in the
slums of East Baghdad (Sadr City), in which it killed 10 Sadrist
militiamen.

American troops gradually encroached on Najaf on Thursday,
establishing control over the headquarters of the provincial governor on
the outskirts of the city. In the heavy battles preceding this victory,
an estimated 41 Mahdi Army militiamen were killed. US troops then
searched the surrounding buildings and placed snipers atop them. Najaf
residents were requested in Arabic not to leave their homes, especially
in the Ghadir quarter, where the governor's mansion is situated. Bremer
requested the new governor, al-Dhurufi, to disarm the Army of the Mahdi.
Loud explosions and the heavy exchange of fire were heard in Najaf,
causing the deaths as so far reported of 4 Iraqis, and the wounding of
10. The US troops set up checkpoints on the road between Najaf and Kufa.
The army also positions numerous tanks and armored fighting vehicles in
the northwest of Najaf, in preparation for an assault on Mahdi Army
positions.

This is the first time that American armor has been positioned in
al-Sadrayn Square, about a mile from the shrine of Imam Ali, the cousin
and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad.

American and Polish troops withdrew from the center of Karbala a few
hours after they had entered the city and bombarded Muqtada's offices
there. (I heard in US media that an American soldier was quoted as
saying that the buildings blew up on taking some fire, suggesting that
they were full of stockpiled explosives). Eyewitnesses reported that
violent clashes took place between Coalition troops and Mahdi Army
militiament that lasted several hours. One militiaman was killed and
nine wounded.

Kufa, near Najaf, was also the site of heavy battles on Thursday
between Sadrists and the Americans, in which 41 Iraqis were killed. In
Nasiriyah, Italian troops battled Mahdi Army gunmen, with three Iraqis
killed.

It is my information that the Shiite members of the Interim Governing
Council not only do not object to the American plan to gradually
surround and destroy the Mahdi Army in the three cities, but that some
of them wanted to send tribal levies in to do the job. The latter plan
was overruled by Mr. Bremer, presumably because it risked throwing a
great deal more power to the tribal chieftains, and the US is now eager
to husband military power for itself.

In other news, a suicide bomber drove his car into a checkpoint
outside the US headquarters in Baghdad, killing one American soldier and
wounding 3, and leaving 6 Iraqi civilians dead and 23 wounded. The
al-Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Monotheism and Holy War) group of Abu Musab
al-Zarqawi claimed credit for the attack.

A roadside bomb killed two US troops and wounded two early morning on
Thursday.

Another roadside bomb exploded as a 3-vehicle convoy of foreign
civilians went by.

In the northern city of Kirkuk, the Director General of the
Agriculture Bureau was assassinated.
