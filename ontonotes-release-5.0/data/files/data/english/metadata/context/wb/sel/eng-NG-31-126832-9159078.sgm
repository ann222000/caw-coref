High-rise Fire
5757 W. Century Bl.
LAX/Hotel Row
Friday, November 23,  2007
TIME: 8:04 PM
INCIDENT #: 0946

On Friday, November 23,  2007 at  8:04 PM, 22 Companies of Los Angeles Firefighters, 5 LAFD Rescue Ambulances,  1 Arson Unit,   1 Rehab Unit,   1 CERT Coordinator, 1 Hazardous Materials Team,  3 Helicopters, 4 EMS Battalion Captains, 4 Battalion Chief Officer Command Teams, and 1 Division Chief Officer Command Team all under the direction of Assistant Chief Donald Austin responded to a High-rise Fire at 5757 W. Century Bl. in LAX/Hotel Row.

First arriving Firefighters arrived to find an 8-story high-rise office building with reports of smoke on the sixth floor. An assessment of the alarm panel in the lobby area showed several smoke alarms activated on the sixth and seventh floors. Firefighters, carrying hosepacks, breathing apparatus, and dressed in full turnouts ascended the stairway to the sixth floor. Upon arrival, Fire companies reported heavy smoke in the 150' long hallway and yet, they were unable to locate the fire. Utilizing the High-rise Incident Command System, additional Firefighters evaluated the floors above and below the reported fire floor. As additional Firefighters assisted with fire attack, the fire was located inside one suite on the sixth floor.

Hoselines were connected to the stairwell standpipes, extended down the hallway, and into the suite, enabling Firefighters to extinguish the fire in just under one hour. Firefighters spent several hours after the fire was extinguished protecting other occupancies in the building from water and smoke damage. It took 150 Firefighters to locate and extinguish the fire. There were no injuries reported. The cause is under investigation and the dollar loss is still being tabulated.
