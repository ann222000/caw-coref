Next best thing would be a decent service manual. Check your local library.

After you raise the wheel, secure it with a jackstand, and remove the
wheel/tire, remove the caliper by backing off the two 3/8" allen-head slide
bolts.  Pull these all the way out.  Lift the caliper off the rotor, and if
necessary, remove the rotor and have it turned or replaced.  Pop the outer
pad out of the caliper (big screwdriver is helpful here).  Put a big C-clamp
on the center of the inner pad and the back of the caliper.  Attach a piece
of tubing to the bleeder screw, and run it into a suitable container (soda
bottle works well).  Open the bleeder screw, and tighten the clamp to
compress the piston back into the cylinder.  Once the pad bottoms out, close
the bleeder screw, remove the tubing and C-clamp, then take the old inner
pad out.

Install the new pads in the caliper.  Lightly grease the flat spots on the
steering knuckle where the caliper will slide on, as well as the slide
bolts, with high-temp brake grease (included with some pads, otherwise get
it from the parts place).  Make SURE this is grease designed for brake use,
and not regular multi-purpose or wheel-bearing grease.

Slide the new caliper with pads back into place, and re-install the slide
bolts.  Spray the rotor down with some brake cleaner if you got any
fingerprints/grease/other contaminants on it, turning it and wiping it down
(this is also required if you get a new rotor, to remove the protective
coating the factory puts on the rotor - do both sides of the new rotor
before installing it).

Repeat this on the other side, then pump the brake pedal until it firms up
(seating the pads against the rotors).  Finally, top off the brake fluid
resevoir with brake fluid (DOT3 or DOT4), and you're done.

And yeah - if you pick up a Haynes repair manual, #30041, it will go over
this in more detail, pictures and all, and should make things a little
easier.

I made a mistake.  Go to www.dodgetrucks.org
Before you click on specific article about brakes.
First:  Click on Forums.
Second:  Scroll down to FAQ &amp; How to Forums
Third:  Scroll down to and click on  'How To Articles'
Fourth:  Scroll down to article 'Replacement of the Brake Pads and Rotors'

Hope this helps.
