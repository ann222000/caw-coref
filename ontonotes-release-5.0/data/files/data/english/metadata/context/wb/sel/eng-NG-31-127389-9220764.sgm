So do I.

However, some of these guys go into long term lurking mode. LTLM.

That other guy, alexy, the pro-CEO-capitalist-imperialist-
-free-trade-is-good-and--exporting-jobs-to-2rd-world-is-good guy
is out there, too, cruising at periscope depth and they only
way to get him to come out of the woodwork is to drop some anti-CEO depth
charges. He's also been known to come up out of the depths if you bash BLS
statistics, bash statistics in general, or come up with &quot;logic&quot; games
where he can play cat and mouse with people (where he is the cat and you
are the mouse [but you can play as a mouse bigger and stronger than the
cat, and get even]).

Russell will come out if you ask a serious question on
meteorology/weather, etc.

Me, I'm suffering that incurable disease: diarhea of the keyboard.

Probably too late for you, but I have this book &quot;Is the temperature
rising? -The uncertain science of Global Warming&quot; by S. George Philander,
meant for the layman, but lots of graphs, and non-ideological. I just
paged throgh it, but have not read in detail. There is a short reeferen e
list, and au is a prof of geography.

There a several good books out, and of course the IPCC website

If one wants to learning a lot about climate, but at a moderate
technical level, _Earth's Climate: Past and Future_ by Ruddiman
is quite complete, but a bit expensive.

The talk went fairly well, I think.  My boss gave the talk before
mine and we tag-teamed the Q&amp;A session after my talk.  I got nice
compliments, including from my wife, but people are always polite
in that respect.  Lunch was good.  A fine day.

I also paged through Bjorn Lomborg's &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; in
which the overiding theme was &quot;Nothing is as bad as it seems&quot; but it had a
very large amount of data and a very large amount of refernces so you
could check it all out for yourself. Me: I think it is almost beyond the
resources of the average person to learn, grasp, understand, and document
enough to be enlightened (But, two caveats: i) if man made CO2 production
rates keep expanding the partial pressure in the atmosphere, then we're in
trouble in a couple of decades, and ii) there are all manner of
corporations that are lining up to make tons of money off this like they
never have before).

On the local neigborhood, one of the newspapers came out yesterday saying
the data shows our drought this year is the second worst in over 100
years, and the worst drought was just two years before. I've never seen
dried up crops like this year and two year ago. So, I'm thankful for
trucks and economies and sprinkler systems for those who put them in over
here and can get crops (otherwise losses here would be closer to 100%
than 90%). I just think crop loss here is going to lead to lots of farms
for sale, and who is going to get them? Agribusiness (the big farm
corporations that already own some 60-70% of all arable land), and they
are going to get them on the cheap, too. Love that robber-barron
capitalism, eh?

We don't know how exactly bad it well be (Prediction is
difficult, especially the future. - Bohr), but recently the
Arctic ice cap has given signs of going into a nonlinear
melting regime, and Arctic sea ice had already decreased
beyond the range of model predictions, and that was before
this year's record low sea ice extent.  Hope your local zoo
is well stocked with polar bears, because that may be the
only place you'll be able to see them soon.  You probably
weren't planning a trip to the Arctic to watch polar bears
anyway, right? :-)

Yep.  I'm the National Drought Monitor contact point for the
reional climate center, so I've been watching it develop.  The
Northeast has had some drought farther north, but not as bad as
down your way.  Predictions are that more short term drought may
be in the future because global warming is expected to give the
same or slightly more rain in some places, but it will come in
heavier bursts with corresponding dry periods in between.  And
some places will actually get less rain, which will make it
seem like drought in those locations, while others will get more.

Russell

If I were to rank order the importance to me of the following two items:

1. The groundwater level at which my well goes dry (and what I'm going to
do about it, and the domino effect of neighborhood water deficits).

2. The extantness/extinctness of polar bears.

Guess which one is going to get my vote?  8-|

WSJ had a nationwide map of this. The drought spread from DE goes west and
south, and from southern Cal to east and north, and at least anotehr area
or two in the USA, so its not trivial at all.

Austrailia has been hit hard the last ten years with rain shortfall even
if it is only a few percent of the total. Its a large percentage of farm
area.

I really don't want to move again. And, seeing these farmer lands with all
dead, dry, brown crops is kinda rough. And, I'm thinking about all kinds
of &quot;what to do next&quot; scenarios (rain barrels under the downspouts, garden
hose and pump into local ponds, solar stills, air conditioner condensed

&gt; &gt;&gt; enough to be enlightened (But, two caveats: i) if man made CO2 production
&gt; &gt;&gt; rates keep expanding the partial pressure in the atmosphere, then we're in
&gt; &gt;&gt; trouble in a couple of decades, and ii) there are all manner of
&gt; &gt;&gt; corporations that are lining up to make tons of money off this like they
&gt; &gt;&gt; never have before).

&gt; &gt; We don't know how exactly bad it well be (Prediction is
&gt; &gt; difficult, especially the future. - Bohr), but recently the
&gt; &gt; Arctic ice cap has given signs of going into a nonlinear
&gt; &gt; melting regime, and Arctic sea ice had already decreased
&gt; &gt; beyond the range of model predictions, and that was before
&gt; &gt; this year's record low sea ice extent.  Hope your local zoo
&gt; &gt; is well stocked with polar bears, because that may be the
&gt; &gt; only place you'll be able to see them soon.  You probably
&gt; &gt; weren't planning a trip to the Arctic to watch polar bears
&gt; &gt; anyway, right? :-)

&gt; If I were to rank order the importance to me of the following two items:

&gt; 1. The groundwater level at which my well goes dry (and what I'm going to
&gt; do about it, and the domino effect of neighborhood water deficits).

&gt; 2. The extantness/extinctness of polar bears.

&gt; Guess which one is going to get my vote?  8-|

&gt; &gt;&gt; On the local neigborhood, one of the newspapers came out yesterday saying
&gt; &gt;&gt; the data shows our drought this year is the second worst in over 100
&gt; &gt;&gt; years, and the worst drought was just two years before. I've never seen
&gt; &gt;&gt; dried up crops like this year and two year ago. So, I'm thankful for
&gt; &gt;&gt; trucks and economies and sprinkler systems for those who put them in over
&gt; &gt;&gt; here and can get crops (otherwise losses here would be closer to 100%
&gt; &gt;&gt; than 90%). I just think crop loss here is going to lead to lots of farms
&gt; &gt;&gt; for sale, and who is going to get them? Agribusiness (the big farm
&gt; &gt;&gt; corporations that already own some 60-70% of all arable land), and they
&gt; &gt;&gt; are going to get them on the cheap, too. Love that robber-barron
&gt; &gt;&gt; capitalism, eh?

&gt; &gt; Yep.  I'm the National Drought Monitor contact point for the
&gt; &gt; reional climate center, so I've been watching it develop.  The
&gt; &gt; Northeast has had some drought farther north, but not as bad as
&gt; &gt; down your way.

&gt; WSJ had a nationwide map of this. The drought spread from DE goes west and
&gt; south, and from southern Cal to east and north, and at least anotehr area
&gt; or two in the USA, so its not trivial at all.

That's probably the map that I contribute to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Austrailia has been hit hard the last ten years with rain shortfall even
&gt; if it is only a few percent of the total. Its a large percentage of farm
&gt; area.

Yes, and a La Nina is forecast for the coming winter,
which tends to make Australia dry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;  Predictions are that more short term drought may
&gt; &gt; be in the future because global warming is expected to give the
&gt; &gt; same or slightly more rain in some places, but it will come in
&gt; &gt; heavier bursts with corresponding dry periods in between.  And
&gt; &gt; some places will actually get less rain, which will make it
&gt; &gt; seem like drought in those locations, while others will get more.

&gt; I really don't want to move again. And, seeing these farmer lands with all
&gt; dead, dry, brown crops is kinda rough. And, I'm thinking about all kinds
&gt; of &quot;what to do next&quot; scenarios (rain barrels under the downspouts, garden
&gt; hose and pump into local ponds, solar stills, air conditioner condensed
&gt; water collection, etc.).

Well, anything you can do to save water, like collect rainwater
for the garden, helps.  Cornell's solar house entry for this
year (I think they came in 2nd two years ago) uses gray water
from the shower to water the garden, according to the article
I read.  Some have said in the 21st century water will be the
new oil.

Nah, sea level will rise, but be offset by all the pumps pumping water
onshore, and into reverse-osmosis filters.

Pardon my irreverant shift of seriousness...I couldn't help it. ;-)
But, I'm 20 minutes from the beach.

Farther people are inland, it could be worse to much worse for them. All
depends on water table height, deep well pump limits, etc., etc. I can
remember reading back 3 decades ago talk about water tables going down as
intensive farming continues to drain water to the surface where conversion
to water vapor (and runoff) slowly causes progressive lowering of the
water table. However, the economic shock of widespread crop failure in
drought areas is going to be hard to deal with.

And, the Indians and Chinese want cars, too, just like us. I think I read
somewhere that just about now, they are making as many in China as we are
now, here.
