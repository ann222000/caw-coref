Let me get this straight. Is the budget proposing to increase the gas
taxes four-fold first, then switch it over to a user fee structure
afterward or are the user fees going to ON TOP of an increased gas
tax? If it's the latter, then we are all about to get our asses handed
to us.

Well, people generally hate lobbyists, unless they're yours.

I've no doubt that AOPAs DC folk (and Phil himself) are doing some serious
flesh pressing.  This is a subject that has been on AOPAs radar for quite
some time.

BTW, anyone else see the story on the news tonite regarding Nancy Pellossi
and her request to have access to USAF aircraft for her transportation
needs?  Guess a G-V wasn't good enough?

Write your senators and representatives...we can change this...

Dear Senator xxx,

The budget for the coming year has just left the president's office, and I
do not like the implications of it. It sounds like the President wants to
drop homeland programs such as education to continue to fund his lost war in
Iraq. He also seems to be trying to divert funds away from aviation and
increase taxes on fuel. (see http://www.aopa.org/faafundingdebate/ ). Please
scrutinize this budget. We cannot afford this.

Best regards,

xxxx

While the cost of the war in Iraq is high, it PALES in comparison
with what social and entitlement programs cost the American taxpayer.

If we are in a 'mess' it is because there is NO ONE in Washington DC
with enough balls to reject the incessant pandering &amp; PC mentality
that has emasculated the current tired old politicians. They are
totally unable to do what it takes to make the United States a

NO SURPRISE: FY2008 BUDGET CONTAINS AVIATION USER-FEE PROPOSAL
( http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/FY2008_Budget_User_Fees_194396-1... )
The White House released the Fiscal Year 2008 budget amid fanfare on
Monday morning, but general aviation groups aren't jumping for joy. In
the DOT budget breakdown
( http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/pdf/appendix/dot.pdf ),
the FAA allotment includes $175 million for a 21st Century satellite
navigation system to replace older air traffic control equipment and
$900 million in additional air traffic control system upgrades, but it
also includes an expected user-fee proposal. "The [Bush]
Administration will transmit a reauthorization proposal in 2007 that
transforms the FAA's excise tax financing system to a cost-based
system that recovers most of costs of air traffic services through
user fees," the document states. NBAA quickly rapped the Bush
Administration for the move: "After more than a year of intense
lobbying by the nation's big airlines, the White House has decided to
introduce a budget that shifts airline costs to other segments of the
industry and gives airlines more control over the air traffic system.
NBAA and the rest of the general aviation community will oppose this
toxic mix of higher taxes, new fees and airline control. The fact is
the current approach to funding and oversight of the aviation system
is effective and efficient -- there is no need for radical 'fixes'
like those proposed in this budget." http://www.avweb.com

I hope he's doing more than that.  I know the AOPA funded a couple TV
commercials but that seems like a high cost/low effect effort.

I'd like to see the AOPA put together a coalition of GA manufacturers,
flight schools, aircraft dealers, charter companies, FBOs, insurance
companies to put some focused pressure on congress.  I'm betting there are
quite a few private pilots in congress that could get heavily involved.
