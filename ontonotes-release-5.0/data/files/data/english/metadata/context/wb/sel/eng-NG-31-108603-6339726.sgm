Subject: Reducing the probability of ENTRY into
myopia from 30 percent to 1 percent.

Otis&gt; You are correct about I. Semmelwies.  AFTER he reduced
the death rate from 30 percent to 1 percent, he was declared
a fraud.

Tyner&gt;  When you reduce the incidence of myopia from 30% to 1%, we'll
listen. I promise.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would be pleased to work on true-prevention
of ENTRY into myopia (a negative refractive
STATE of the fundamental eye)
provided some basic conditions are met.

1.  The study be classed as engineering-scientific,
and is clearly NOT another MEDICAL study.

2. The person's involved have a college-engineering
education.  (Or are in a college with that type
of background, and are cognizant of
scientific issues.

3. The majority-opinion stated by Catman Grant
be read before the group -- and analyized in
detail.

4.  The study be open, and respect the
scientific competence of EACH person
in the study.

5.  The study be conducted at an ENGINEERING
college, where the participatents fully understand
the dynamic-eye concept, and can follow
instructions in the CORRECT wearing
of a plus lens.

6.  No individual will have a Snellen of less
than 20/60.  (Cycloplegic will be taken and
recorded at the start.  Individuals will be
taught the technique and will make the
measurements.)

7. Results to be judged by competent
engineers and scientists.

8.  RETIRED optometrists will be asked
to support (but not direct) the study.

That works for me.

Best,

Otis

Subject: The refractive STATE-CHANGE of the normal eye at
a four year college

Dear Prevention-minded friends,

Subject: What EXACTLY what did Gmelin and McKenny mean when they said
the
following:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the class of 1975, 554 cadets (67 percent) of a class
">

of 828 graduated wearing spectacles or contact lenses.

By comparing the refractive error (spherical equivalent) of each cadet
as it was recorded in his 201 File, both for his entrance physical
examination (1970) and his commissioning examination (1974),
visual acuity degradation can be demonstrated empirically.
At the completion of four years in a academic environment, there
were fewer hyperopic and many more myopic cadets in the class
of 1974

These were stated in McKinney, "A Study of Refractive Trends at West
Point", (tragically un-published).

McKinney&gt; 2. The AVERAGE increase in myopia was -1.37 diopters (the
range being -1.12 diopters through -1.62 diopters).

It is my thesis is that he means exactly that.

For example, a Cadet with -1.0 diopters (20/70) would, after
four years, wind up with an increase of minus refraction of between
-1.12 to -1.62 diopters.

Or, equally, if the person had -1.5 diopters, at the end for
four years, his refraction would have increased
by between -1.12 to -1.62 diopters.

I truly doubt that there was an intention to say anything else
other than that.

If you think the meaning of this statement is anything else,
other than that please let me know.

If he intended to say anything else other than that -- I would
be very interested in the original data to resolve
this issue.

Since these records are maintained year after year, I
would see no problem verifying this fact.

Perhaps other interested parties would like to make
a statement about this "down" rate in for years for
all cadets with an initial negative refractive STATE.

Best,

Otis

Dear "L",

Yes indeed, DrL, the percentage of myopes has
grown to 88 percent in Hong Kong and 95
percent for Taiwan Medical students.

And you just dig the whole deeper and think
it is all a "hoot".

For any review with intelligent people who would
like to RETAIN their distant vision, I think
you attitude should be presented to THEM,
and an example of the "...I don't give a damm"
about your long-term visual welfair."

Maybe THAT will wake them up -- to
take the responsibility you REFUSE.

I know I gave up on you a long time ago.

Otis

What happened is the recognition of how totally you
IGNORE all scientific facts about the fundamental eye's
proven behavior -- when you dislike the implication
of scientific facts.

But, finally, some open-minded optometrists have been
willing to work in the context of scientific facts,
and will help those who will ACCEPT the necessity
of using the plus -- before the minus.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is my thesis is that he means exactly that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, a Cadet with -1.0 diopters (20/70) would, after
&gt; &gt; &gt; four years, wind up with an increase of minus refraction of between
&gt; &gt; &gt; -1.12 to -1.62 diopters.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Or, equally, if the person had -1.5 diopters, at the end for
&gt; &gt; &gt; four years, his refraction would have increased
&gt; &gt; &gt; by between -1.12 to -1.62 diopters.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I truly doubt that there was an intention to say anything else
&gt; &gt; &gt; other than that.

But ... but ... but ... golly gee willickers, Uncle Otie.  What about
this study:

What about the notion that 26% of myopes shifted HYPEROPIC or DID NOT
SHIFT during the USAF Academy study.

What about that?  Huh?  HUH??

What about the data itself.  Got ANY EVIDENCE (notice I'm not even
looking for conclusive proof) that plus lenses affect this

I believe I just did.

Seems there's just something else at work here, and--since we don't
have NON-college students (or other controls NOT engaged in intensive
near work) to compare to, we have no idea what's at work here.  Could
well be NOTHING OTHER THAN genetics from this kind of study.

Either way, your theory doesn't seem to alter the outcomes in any way
(unless you count inducing double vision ... which ... I guess we
should).

Come on, Otis.  Answer the questions.  Be a guy.  Be a regular (not in
the fiber-rich way, either) guy.

what has been "proven" over this length of time is that plus lenses,
undercorrection, bifocals, having myopes read without their glasses,
etc. IS ALL INEFFECTIVE.  read the literature you old fool!

why do you harass all the doctors here as if their is some myopia
prevention treatment that should be applied that they are refusing to
apply?  all the treatments that you suggest have been tested multiple
times and proven to be as effective as fairy dust.

as you point out, noone has more interest in this issue than the
Asian's and thats why researchers in Singapore and Hong Kong have
taken the lead on this issue.  their conclusions are the same--
nothing that has been tried so far works except the anti-cholineric
drugs therapies and those are still being worked out.  and don't start
farting out the name of Steve Leung-- he's and idiot and noone over
there accepts him at all.  he hasn't proven a thing.

YOU are the one who has sat on your butt over the last 25 years and
done nothing.  if you think you have a clue about how to prevent
myopia then go out and PROVE it.  i don't care if you use engineering
students, retired optometrists or whatever, if the study design is
valid then everyone will take notice.

quit posting unsubstantiated drivel on the internet and instead take
the time to prove what you claim and we will all be happier.

"Some"?  You only come up with one.  When was that last time you
referenced a scientific study that wasn't at least 20 years/old,
unless it was to criticize the findings?  And you have the gall to

Subject: A listing of Dr. Francis Young's published papers.

The preliminary to any PREVENTIVE study must include
a scientific evaluation of the NATURAL eye's refractive
behavior when OBJECTIVELY tested.

These are the listing of the papers I received from Francis Young
in 1995.

Some of the topics you are discussing have been
evaluated by Dr. Young's research.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: The refractive STATE-CHANGE of the normal eye at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a four year college

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Prevention-minded friends,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: What EXACTLY what did Gmelin and McKenny mean when they said
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From the class of 1975, 554 cadets (67 percent) of a class

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of 828 graduated wearing spectacles or contact lenses.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By comparing the refractive error (spherical equivalent) of each cadet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as it was recorded in his 201 File, both for his entrance physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; examination (1970) and his commissioning examination (1974),
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; visual acuity degradation can be demonstrated empirically.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the completion of four years in a academic environment, there
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were fewer hyperopic and many more myopic cadets in the class
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of 1974

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These were stated in McKinney, &quot;A Study of Refractive Trends at West
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Point&quot;, (tragically un-published).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; McKinney&gt; 2. The AVERAGE increase in myopia was -1.37 diopters (the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; range being -1.12 diopters through -1.62 diopters).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my thesis is that he means exactly that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, a Cadet with -1.0 diopters (20/70) would, after
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; four years, wind up with an increase of minus refraction of between
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -1.12 to -1.62 diopters.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or, equally, if the person had -1.5 diopters, at the end for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; four years, his refraction would have increased
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by between -1.12 to -1.62 diopters.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I truly doubt that there was an intention to say anything else
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other than that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you think the meaning of this statement is anything else,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other than that please let me know.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If he intended to say anything else other than that -- I would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be very interested in the original data to resolve
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this issue.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since these records are maintained year after year, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would see no problem verifying this fact.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps other interested parties would like to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a statement about this &quot;down&quot; rate in for years for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all cadets with an initial negative refractive STATE.

Dear "L",

As long as you put your own 5 year-old into a strong minus -- then
one thing is dead certain.  You will NEVER be part
of any plus-prevention program.  As a father you have that
right.

But not everyone agrees with you.  Further, if the
person "wakes up", and understands both the difficulties
of plus-prevention AND the opportunity -- the a degree
of success can be achieved, not in getting OUT of it,
but rather by avoiding getting IN TO IT.

But you obviously can not even understand the concept.

Of course everyone who does this successfully simply
avoids you -- by avoiding entry into myopia in the first place.

YOU MUST TAKE CONTROL

become clear that you must understand the bad results that occur when
you use the negative lens. More than this, Jacob's analysis
demonstrated that even a completely dedicated eye doctor can not
overcome the popular misconceptions that exists in the public's mind
about eye doctors and the use of the preventive lens.

I made a major effort to help my niece and nephew. They developed a
clear understanding of the problem of nearsightedness and the type or
solution that could be expected. I believe that providing them with a
"fighting chance" to defeat the problem is better than providing no
chance at all. Both used the plus lens and retained clear distant
vision without prescription lenses. They understood that it would take
long-term commitment to achieve the desired result. I asked my nephew
to write a short note to describe his own effort and outcome as he
worked to maintain clear distant vision through college.

FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE WEARING A PLUS LENS
Dear Uncle,

Thank you very much for the book, "How to Avoid
Nearsightedness".  I got it yesterday after I came back from the
weekend.  I am looking forward to reading it soon, but for now I
have a great deal of school work to read.

I would imagine you'll be pleased to have me tell you that
one of the first things I did after opening your book was to check
my eyes with the eye chart.  I am able to read the 20/20 line on
the eye-chart. I have been using my drug store plus lenses most
of the time now.  I have always passed the driver's license eye
test.

I use these glasses nearly 100 percent of the time when I
read text books and use them for about 70 percent of the total
reading I do.  I started using them as much as possible again
because, at the end of last semester my sight was pretty bad (I
didn't check them on a chart).  I am lucky to have an uncle who
showed me back in eighth grade that I could prevent my
nearsightedness.

One thing college has taught me is to listen to others and
then use or adapt methods to work for me.  In the last few years I
have had a great deal more reading work to do. If I don't use the
magnifying lenses I notice fairly quickly that my sight starts to
deteriorate.  Then I realize it's time to do something to stop
that process.

At the moment, I am wearing the magnifying lens because I
know what it does for my vision.  Thanks for taking the time to
tell me how to avoid a situation, wearing glasses at all times for
the rest of my life, that I would find unpleasant, and for sending
me a copy of your book so I can learn more in-depth about the
methods I am using.

AN ENGINEER'S UNEXPECTED SUCCESS

Perhaps the most surprising and encouraging result to be achieved was
accomplished by accident. Because of my long-term experience with the
experimental data, I knew that recovery -- on the average -- would be
slow. Anyone who attempts to use the plus lens wants to succeed. It
makes sense to help people who have gotten into about 20/80. Any
improvement will get you to 20/50, which passes the FAA 3rd class
flying license. Recovery, if you are worse than 20/100, is difficult
but possible. To present all the facts including surprising results, I
asked Dennis to write a letter describing his efforts and ultimate
result.

VISION RESTORATION: THE EFFECT THAT A POSITIVE LENS HAD ON MY DISTANT
VISION

Dennis Romich, July 21, 1992

My distance vision had been poor for many years. I had overheard Otis
Brown discussing nearsightedness, and his suggested technique for
restoring the myopic eye to normal. Without telling Otis, I decided to
attempt to use the plus lens, and see what would happen, since the
approach seemed reasonable and much safer than any other method.

I obtained a plus lens at a local store without a prescription. The
lens was a +1.5 diopter lens and is commonly sold as a reading glass
for people who have lost their near vision.

I had become nearsighted in grade school and was prescribed minus
lenses which I dutifully wore all day long. As the years went by, my
vision worsened, and the Doctor would prescribe stronger minus lens.
My distance vision without prescription lenses was very bad through
high school, college, and graduate school. The last professional check
(Ophthalmologist) showed that my prescription was -4.5 diopters (Right
eye) and -4.25 diopters (Left eye). This is approximately 20/320
vision using the Snellen eye chart. In some states, I would be classed
as legally blind without my glasses.

As I wore the plus-lens and did not wear the minus lens, I noticed
that my distance vision began to clear. After several weeks, I
purchased Otis' book, and checked my eyes against the eye chart. They
were 20/30, which means I will pass the standard driver's license
criteria of 20/40 or better without prescription lenses.

Otis was surprised at this effect of the plus lens. He stated that
most individuals could return their vision from 20/70 to 20/20, but he
felt that returning vision from 20/320 to 20/30 was hard to believe.
Since I have done it successfully, I have no doubt that other
individuals who have a similar problem could obtain similar results
using Otis' recommended method of vision restoration.

I am a registered professional engineer, and have a Master's degree in
both Engineering and Business Administration.

Dear DrL,

The quick-fix works great -- in five minutes.  If I were in an office
and had only five minutes I would do what you do -- no
question about it.  I would also deny all secondary effects -- like
you do.  But then:

Insanity is doing the same thing over-and-over again -- but
expecting different results.

Rita Mae Brown

"People believe and do whatever they want to do, regardless

"You cannot by reasoning correct a man of an ill opinion
which by reasoning he never acquired.  We can also say that
neither by reasoning, nor by actual demonstration of the facts,
can you convince some people that an opinion which they have
accepted on authority is wrong."

William Bates

"I know that most men ...  can seldom accept even the
simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as would oblige them

fabric of their lives."

Dear DrG,

Given that you put your own 5 year-old into a strong
minus -- I truly can not argue with you about it.

In my judgment, you can either become part
of the solution -- or remain part of the problem -- and
you insist on doing.

And Yes, we must accept the second-opinion recommendation
of Dr. Young and Dr. Grosvenor, to the effect that, to be effective,
plus-prevention must be STARTED before that first minus lens
is applied, and the person develops stair-case myopia from:

1. The prolonged "near" environment, and

2.  The exacerbating factor of the minus lens -- that
solves no problem at all.

Here is the review of the preventive plus:

===========

Despite the fact that results of studies of children who have
been given bifocals are highly equivocal, Theodore Grosvenor of
the University of Houston College of Optometry -- a proponent of
the role of bifocals in the prevention of myopia -- insists that
persistent close work causes myopia.  (In what researchers
generally consider to be the most carefully performed study to
date, the two scientists ** disagree on the results.) Some of the
studies have not borne out his hypothesis, he says, because they
were conducted too late.  "Once the eye has started to stretch, it
may be too late to keep it from stretching," he says, explaining
that most of the children in the study had already become myopic.
"The ultimate study would be to put reading glasses on
first-graders before anyone has developed myopia," he says.

** [One of the scientists was Dr.  Francis Young.  His bifocal
study showed that a combination of under-correction and a
strong plus stopped the eye's movement into myopia, i.e.,,
would help the natural eye maintain clear distant vision
if used when the eye was at the 20/40 to 20/50 level.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Prevention-minded friends,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: What EXACTLY what did Gmelin and McKenny mean when they said
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From the class of 1975, 554 cadets (67 percent) of a class

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of 828 graduated wearing spectacles or contact lenses.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By comparing the refractive error (spherical equivalent) of each cadet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as it was recorded in his 201 File, both for his entrance physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; examination (1970) and his commissioning examination (1974),
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; visual acuity degradation can be demonstrated empirically.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the completion of four years in a academic environment, there
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were fewer hyperopic and many more myopic cadets in the class
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of 1974

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These were stated in McKinney, &quot;A Study of Refractive Trends at West
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Point&quot;, (tragically un-published).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; McKinney&gt; 2. The AVERAGE increase in myopia was -1.37 diopters (the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; range being -1.12 diopters through -1.62 diopters).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my thesis is that he means exactly that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, a Cadet with -1.0 diopters (20/70) would, after
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; four years, wind up with an increase of minus refraction of between
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -1.12 to -1.62 diopters.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or, equally, if the person had -1.5 diopters, at the end for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; four years, his refraction would have increased
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by between -1.12 to -1.62 diopters.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I truly doubt that there was an intention to say anything else
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other than that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you think the meaning of this statement is anything else,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other than that please let me know.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If he intended to say anything else other than that -- I would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be very interested in the original data to resolve
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this issue.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since these records are maintained year after year, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would see no problem verifying this fact.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps other interested parties would like to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a statement about this &quot;down&quot; rate in for years for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all cadets with an initial negative refractive STATE.

I want to make it explicit that I am not siding with Otis or anyone
else here, but DrG, first, eight of the studies he listed were less
than 30 years old. Second, I do not think your implicit argument is
sound---that if myopia prevention works, why haven't there been lots
of studies suggesting this. There are many reasons that scientific
research goes along some paths and not others, not the least of which
is funding. There is little money to be made in myopia prevention and
much to be made in myopia treatment.

So all your other arguments against Otis notwithstanding, I do not see
any value to discrediting a hypothesis due to lack of research
exploring, supporting, or confirming that hypothesis. Science
progresses when current notions are challenged, revised, or expanded.

Dear DrG,

Otis&gt; Let me clear up some points for you.

1.  I do NEVER advocate the use of a bifocal for a child.  NEVER.

2.  I adovcate that the parents keep track of the child's Snellen,
using a simply IVAC Snellen.

3.  If the child's Snellen starts going down (his refractve STATE
moves negative) I SUGGEST that he consult with a prevention-minded
optometrist like Steve Leung.

4. If the child's Snellen is 20/40 (would pass the DMV) I SUGGEST
that he begin using the plus at that point.  Since his vision is
good, there would be no reason for a minus.

5.  The parents can then monitor the child's Snellen under
the guidance of a second-opnion optometrist.

6.  With respect to an Engineer as a four-year college, the
same method could be use -- with the exception that the
engineer would have the "smarts" to figure it out, and
the necessity of it.  There would be no need for a bifocal.

7.  If he wished, he could obtain a low-power minus for use
of driving a car.

To further clarify:

Stating that the use of bifocals on myopic children is "equivocal" is
hardly a rousing endorsement.

Otis&gt; Using the plus required strong PERSONAL commitment.  You
can never "prescribe" it.  The decision and action MUST be
under the wisdom and control of the parent and child -- or
the person himself.  There must be no doubt about this issue.

Dr. Grosvenor eventually concluded --
and correctly so -- that bifocals only seemed to be effective for
myopes who also exhibited nearpoint esophoria, a fact that nobody
denies.

Otis&gt;  I agree that if you wait until it is too late, the bifocal is
not
effective.  Very often the plus is very weak (+3/4 D) and that can
not have the desired effect. Further the minus (on top) is OVER
PRESCRIBED
and that can only block vision clearing.  This must be understood
by the person who wishes to keep his distant vision clear
through the college years.  In effect, the plus is like brushing
your teeth on a regular basis.  It would be un-wise to not do it.

But, the point is that nobody has reported being able to prevent
myopia, and you nevertheless believe that optometrists and
ophthalmologists should promote such unproven nonsense.

Otis&gt; No, I did NOT say that.  What I said that effective prevention
MUST depend on the person himself -- and NEVER on you.

Otis&gt; Catman Grant's stement convinces me that you collectively
are impossible to deal with.  I have been very clear on that
point.

Otis&gt; All this indicates is that the title of the thread is POSSIBLE,
that the negative movement (from a postive refractive STATE) could
be PREVENTED.  That issue still remains open.

Best,

Otis

I'm still trying to get a handle on this one.

Why, then, is (your niece) Joy a myope, despite use of plus lens
therapy and no use of minus lenses.

Is she simply a weak-willed person with no moral fiber??

Please clarify.

Thanks.

I like your quaint use of the adjective "strong."  My son's first

Oh, come now.  The most recent one he quoted was from 1991 about eye
pressure as a mechanism for myopiagenesis.  It wasn't until 1999 that
researchers found that the retina responded to localized blur.  The
rest are in the 20-30 year range, and some older than that.

Also, you are misquoting me.  Otis is proposing the hypothesis that

not be lacking.  You are also incorrect about lack of funding for this
type of research.  This is actually a very active topic for research,

and do a search under myopia.  Just take a look at the volume or
research.

There is no lack of research into myopia, its causes and cures.  Otis

Dear DrG,

Subject: PLEASE do not mis-quote me.

Otis&gt;  Read again the title of this thread.  It says that
a motivated engineer can AVOID ENTRY into
a negative refractive STATE.

DrG&gt;  Also, you are misquoting me.  Otis is proposing the hypothesis
that
his treatment either prevents or slows the progression of myopia.

Otis&gt; No, I am proposing a method of avoiding ENTRY into
a negative refractive STATE.  I said NOTHING about
"slowing" anything down.  Those are YOUR WORDS,
not mine.

Otis&gt; There has not been one SINGLE plus-PREVENTION
study EVER.

Otis&gt; I believe that scientific effort could become successful
with the right people.

Otis&gt; You have your own distorted ideas about science.
So be it.  Others have the preventive concept, such
as Dr. Striling Colgate and others.

Otis&gt; The title of this thread stands.  The ENTRY into
a negative refractive STATE could be reduced from
30 percent to 10 percent initially, and when the
process is understood, to 1 percent.

Best,

Otis

Thank-you for finally confessing this.  Why hasn't such a study been

Of course you would, if such a group could ever be assembled.
