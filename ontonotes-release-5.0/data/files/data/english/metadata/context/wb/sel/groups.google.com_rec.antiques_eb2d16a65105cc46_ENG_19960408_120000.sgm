Hi gang,
I have acquired a beautifull old (but thrashed) deco-looking couch.
It's real heavy! Springs popping out, the fabric is so cool...it has a
deco-ish pattern in what looks like a heavy drapery material.
It's shape is wild...sort of &quot;S&quot; shaped or &quot;epsilon&quot; shaped with wings on
the back etc.
It needs to be re-upholstered, and the job needs to be great.
Anybody have any tips for me here in L.A. ?
Anybody know anyone who may want to trade photo's for the work?
Thanks!
Chuck
