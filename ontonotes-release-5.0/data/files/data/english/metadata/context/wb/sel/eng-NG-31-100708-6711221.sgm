Laura Bush: "No One Suffers More"

By Dr. Gerry Lower
Created Apr 26 2007 - 12:28pm

In a recent interview, our First Lady, Laura Bush, stated that "No one
suffers more than their president and I do (1)." She was referring, of
course, to the enormous responsibility our Commander in Chief must shoulder
when he sends U.S. troops into harm's way in Iraq.

In making this disingenuous statement, the First Lady has potentially opened
herself up "to charges that the first family is too removed from the anguish
of American troops and their families" (2). So, we might consider those
charges in detail and in the American context.

The First Lady ought really pay more attention to what she is saying. Can
she and George really suffer as much as the wounded and dead U.S. troops
returning from Iraq? Can she and George really suffer as much as the
families of wounded and dead U.S. troops? Can she and George really suffer
as much as the wounded and dead Iraqi civilians and their families?

For Laura to claim that "no one suffers more" is an effort to portray
sympathy for the U.S. troops and their families, but it comes off, given the
current circumstances, to more portray self-righteousness ... to claim to
suffer more than those directly involved. Like her born-again husband, she
may not know what she is doing.

It is really not sympathy that Laura Bush ought want to portray. Sympathy
(to have feelings for) is the complementary opposite of apathy (to have no
feelings for). Neither has ever solved a problem in the real world.

The values of Jefferson's Democracy provide our proper bottom lines in
America, e.g., human rights, fairness and equality. These global human
values are derived by dialectic synthesis of complementary eastern and
western cultural values (3). In Laura's case, we might hope that she would
portray "empathy" (to comprehend and take remedial action in the interest of
problem solving).

With regard to problem solving, if our First Lady were sincere about her
suffering, she would have to grab George and sit down with him to get honest
and real ... about the War on Iraq and about the trusted men who have led
him astray in making the greatest military blunder in U.S. history.

Laura would have to explain to George how his own chosen staff has led him
astray with lies and fabrications in the interest of an imperial
neoconservatism. She would have to explain to George that preemptive attacks
are, by definition, immoral. She would have to explain to George that there
were no WMDs in Iraq, no connections to bin Laden and Al Qaida, and no
relevance to the war on terrorism.

Laura would have to explain to George how Dick and Karl have corrupted his
administration, lost Congress to the Democratic party, discredited the
Republican party, blackened America's name in the world, and now threatens
to leave him with a legacy of overseeing the most notably incompetent and
corrupt administration in U.S. history.

To help George comprehend his situation more honestly and accurately ...
that would be the most important contribution that Laura could give to the
American people. It would be the only thing she could do for George that
would give him reason to fire Cheney and Rove and then resign the
Presidency.

That will never happen because empathy and human rights have not survived
American capitalism. The American people are going to have to remove more
than the Bush administration in their efforts to get real.

government to its true principles.  It is true that in the meantime we are
suffering deeply in spirit,
and incurring the horrors of a war and long oppressions of enormous public
debt.  But if the game runs sometimes against us at home we must have
patience till luck turns, and then we shall have an opportunity of winning
back the principles we have lost, for this is a game where principles are at
stake."
