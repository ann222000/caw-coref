Earlier SMC discussion for review:

&quot;An influenza pandemic is inevitable.&quot; -- Director of US. Centers for
Disease Control

It would be my wish that you survive the Pan-Flu when it happens by
learning what the Holy Spirit has taught me concerning HIS way for us
to survive it when it strikes:

http://TheHealthFair.com

This health fair is completely free thanks to the generous support of
The Wellness Foundation.

Alternatively, you can borrow from dear neighbor Don Kirkman the DVD
recording of the presentation that I have been giving at these health
fairs to prepare our local Atlanta community.

The good folks at the Wellness Foundation have been sending out these
DVDs as free gifts to those who have given charitable donations of US
$30 or more:

http://TheWellnessFoundation.com/Donations

Note that US$30 is the usual nominal cost of online access to a
journal article and is going toward helping defray the material,
handling, and shipping costs associated with the DVD.

May GOD bless you in HIS mighty way making you healthier (hungrier)
than ever:

I'm not gonna feed the troll, but, as a government employee, I have to

Just because a political appointee or a civil servant says something
doesn't make it
true. As is the case with Pan-Flu. There are agendas at work behind
the Panic-Flu
fear mongering. But then again, there always is.

Now be good or you'll spend eternity with all of your convicted
neighbors. Unless you

Andrew Chung:

Is a frequent and proven liar (evidence archived forever on Google)

Has lost numerous NNTP accounts with supernews and others, has had many
Google accounts nuked, and his vanity domain heartmdphd.com is now
banned from setting up accounts. He is instead using multiple Google
sock accounts and email addresses in the format lo ... @thetruth.com (#
being a number)

Is unemployed after being sacked with cause from his one and only job
after just over 80 days

Fled the state of Florida, and now claims to practice in Georgia despite
having no admission priveliges in the State's hospitals

Runs a phony foundation with a total declared income of circa $200, the
ownership and contact details of which are obfuscated on its website

Makes failed prophecies concerning earthquakes with areas and dates,
which don't happen (remember the bible quotes about false prophets)

Performed a public attempt at 'exorcising' a Malaysian sock on usenet,
then denied doing it. He has recently reversed position again and admits
to practicing exorcism by usenet, proving himself a liar in the process.

Promotes a dangerous diet, with a million dollar guarantee that he
demands thirty dollars to access details of. This despite being
unemployed. His soliciting and spamming for donations looks to be
similar to the Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud, where victims pay money
upfront in the hope of coming into riches but find they have merely
bought into a lie. Part of his advice is to pour nail polish remover onto food.

Declares he has a cardiology practice despite posting night and day from
the same IP address (his home presumably) or a coffee shop internet cafe

Makes further false prophecies that we should now be all dying in a bird
flu pandemic. When these fail to happen, he does them all over again and
changes the dates. Nuclear war is another Chung spciality, which
naturally doesn't happen when he says it is going to.

Worships evil hatemonger Fred Phelps and will not denounce the acts of
Westboro's congregation. He even accuses someone with the name Phelps of
being Fred's son and refuses to accept he is completely wrong.

Uses the same patter as Pat Robertson, indicating his religious activity
is confined to watching cable TV. No evidence Chung has ever attended a
church.

Has a tendency to cyberstalk, particularly women. His wife fled some
time ago to another state, an act which Chung tries to pass off as &quot;being
on vacation&quot;.

Frequently passes himself off as being qualified in areas such as
endocrinology, despite making incredibly fundamental blunders in his
'advice'. It is no wonder the Florida heart facility terminated him, and
has publicly denounced his version of events. Again archived on Google.

Don't forget the fake fast, where he didn't lose any weight, as well as
the infamous 666 stamping fiasco. His latest vile trick is spamming the
blogs of dying cancer patients and then crowing triumphantly when they
pass away.

The CDC is part of your Federal Government, just like me. It's headed

The Allman Brothers Band once asked, &quot;Are you really Satan, yes or
no?&quot; They were
pretty good when I saw them in concert. When they asked, I said no.
But the problem with
asking the reputed Prince of Lies a question like &quot;Are you a liar?&quot; is
that there's no way you
can believe the answer. I think that's your problem Andy. You've been
such a piece of crap
for so long that if anyone asks you about honest, even if you said you
were lying, no one
would believe you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

In the name of His Holy Noodleness, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, I
mildly repudiate you.

PS- Satan is the proper name for a (possibly fictional) divine being.
He is accorded
capitalization, even when He is referred to in pronoun. Equal billing
with your Jesus.
Or should I call him jesus?

We, who are HIS brethren, remain secure in the truth, Who is LORD

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Simple straightforward question:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Rod, your rottweiler

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Name-calling simply shows that the Holy Spirit is absolutely right
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to convict you:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://HeartMDPhD.com/Convicts

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; , claims you are resident at a hospital in Atlanta.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Which one? How long have you been working there, and in what
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; capacity?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Attempt at social engineering noted:

&gt; &gt;&gt; WTF are you talking about? Just answer the question. Why does it have
&gt; &gt;&gt; you stumped? You do know where you work, don't you? You don't think
&gt; &gt;&gt; you'd get away with accusing the prosecution in a court of law of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;attempted social engineering&quot; do you?

&gt; &gt;&gt; It's a straighforward enough question, and if you don't answer it,
&gt; &gt;&gt; the readers of this thread can only assume that you find the
&gt; &gt;&gt; question, and the truth it is aimed at revealing, embarrassing. I
&gt; &gt;&gt; note that Rod has not been able to answer it either. Such a pity, as
&gt; &gt;&gt; it was your opportunity to prove conclusively that you actually are a
&gt; &gt;&gt; cardiologist.

&gt; &gt; Such is the utility of having GOD's peace, which transcends all
&gt; &gt; worldly understanding.

&gt; &gt; We, who are HIS brethren, remain secure in the truth, Who is
&gt; &gt; LORD Jesus Christ.

&gt; &gt; You and other atheists, will remain insecure ever pining for proof
&gt; &gt; but never receiving any. Knowing this fact saddens me.

&gt; Attempt at running away and hiding noted.

you don't work at no hospital.

[[[[  i just received a personal e-mail from you, Andrew:  &quot;My
affiliation with Atlanta area hospitals remain the same.

Would enjoy having lunch with you after the health fair on
9/22/07: ]]]]

the Atlanta area hospitals may well be the same, Andrew.  &quot;the same&quot;
would be that they have or desire NO affiliation with you.

p.s.  the health fair on 9/22/07 is NOT a hospital.

WHAT hospitals are you affiliated with that welcomes your credibility?

the 'health fair' is non too difficult to investigate and would be
presumably motivated to become involved, based on responses from
Emory. This is an organization i'm not familiar with and intend to
become familiar with.

i've had many conversations with the Emory staff and not only are you
not employed there, you are a thorn in their side, consider you a
whacko, and i have the emails to prove it, phone calls aplenty were
not recorded.  actually, LESS than asked from me, i have provided.
noticeably, your Emory crap disappeared for awhile, and i'm about ta
jump back on that bandwagon, but this time with a vengeance, should ya
choose ta tamper with their good name.

you, yourself, said ya had a clinic that &quot;treated&quot; cardiology
patients, and nobody answers that phone and yer voice is on the
answering machine, and i hardly call that a hospital.

ONE MORE turn of events involving Emory, know i'm not as shy as i used
to be. (awwww.)  as a matter of fact, COUNT ON IT !

you might consider a peace that passeth understanding is not in
everyone's heart.

while my memory is making it's way back to present tense, please know
my e-mail box can and will be full, and cooperation with be fair,
just, documented, and sound.

my agenda, Andrew, is not to hurt you, embarrass you, enlighten you,
nor is it my job to bring you face to face with reality.

what is IS my responsibility to do is to see that you are stopped dead
in your tracks that are irresponsibily taking away venues for folks in
need in these forums.  it will be my personal responsibility as a
patient, human, humane member of this planet that you will not
discount, via a position held in esteem, (though fraudulent) an
establishment/establishments that has/have missions of goodness and
abide by professional practices not only dictated by a personal oath,
but by a professional one, as well.

i actaully thought you would have the good sense to respect the
medical establishment through a very lowly effort to remove you and
your distainful banter from this and other cross-posted forums would
be sufficient.

i now see that i was incorrect and loftier goals, along with more
indulgent practices, as well as soliciting more detailed involvements
from others are necessary to curb your sociopathic agenda.

involving myself and others with higher-ranking officials is also time-
comsuming, and i will dedicate the time, means, and medium necessary.

should it come to light that you have harmed, or even left a path of
carnage, which will be above and beyond anything i could claim a
modicum of expertise in, i can assume you i will hunt down and in DUE
time, the proper legal arenas, to indulge reasonability in dealing
with you.

i'm one plain ole redneck chick that don't know shit from shinola, and
as luck would have it, i'm geographyically closest to and as as
business owner of 22 years, have had my share of litigious dealings,
and can network like'ah bitch.  i can't DO much, but i sure as hell
can locate folks that would like nothing more than to bring possibly
an action, maybe even the first class-action suit (i could be wrong)
within the International Superhighway arena.

Andrew?  there are less serious sandboxes to play in.   if you were
fuckin' with yahoo.bingo, i woudn't give'ah good goddam

this one is one of &quot;physical comfort and trust in a serious arena,&quot; at
least.  it is &quot;life and death,&quot; at best.

benzos.  i have siezed, been hospitalized, spent days in ERs with no
insurance, and 2 crisis centers, along with every other arena social
services has to offer and been denied a xanax script. i have made NO
secret about my inability to secure xanax in oklahoma.  after 16 years
in the tattoo business and pretty fucking tight with every drug dealer
within my arm's reach, i have never purchased street benzos.  i have
never purchased a street drug (well, since i was a kid) that was
necessary for my medical needs and i have ONE (xanax,) that is a
NEED.   NOR have i even SUGGESTED a medical professional go under the
table with a script.  ON THE OTHER HAND, i asked a friend for an un-
needed medication, not a script and before he/she got &quot;no&quot; out of
their mouth, i retracted the request.

i will tolerate a LOT, buddy boy, and questioning MY integrity don't
make a good goddam to me.

suggesting i did such is back-handed behavior that would constitute
others' involvement, is suggesting i asked the same of others (why
would i single you out) and that is not tolerable.

i talked to you on thanksgiving day 2 years ago and i was not EVEN
thinking of medication, as you are no doctor, nor did i entertain the
idea and i never do and never will.  i will NEVER compromise even a
legitimate professional in that manner.  Many have seen me suffer on
this forum, and rightfully so, due to lack of medication.  i
advertised it on a consistent basis and not only did i never
personally speak with anyone regarding obtaining a script, i was never

fly several states away to a psychriatrist's office, pay the fee, and
go through &quot;new patient&quot; procedure, just as anyone else in this

If you look back in the Google archives, you will see that the Holy
Spirit had guided me to write months ago that you had asked for
benzodiazepine scripts and that you had at that time not been bothered
by this fact.

One has to wonder why you are bothered by this fact now.

May GOD bless you in HIS mighty way making you healthier (hungrier)

the consequence is the con, the one you have pulled on yourself.  you
have, sadly, pulled on yourself, the greatest con possible...
believing that &quot;he&quot; is you.

&quot;he&quot; has conned no one else and lives alone.  some, when alone, cease
to exist.

'his&quot; uncompromising attitude is more indicative of an inner
uncertainty than a deep conviction. &quot;his&quot; implacable stand is directed
more against the doubt within than the assailant without.

often liars and dishonorable people actually come to believe their own
lies. it's a function of making their lies true, a survival trait.

it's also common for 'method actors' to become so emersed in their
part that they become their character. Dustin Hoffman sustained many
injuries to his left leg while maintaining his character in Midnight
Cowboy.  years later, in  Rainman, the hobble is still evident.

liars and illusionists are similar in that respect.  they must believe
the illusion to become believable to the unsuspecting public.

in the end, there are consequences for indulging this duality. more
times than not, they will end up experiencing the trials of the person
they pretemd/pretended to be. it is the nature of the liar/illusionist
to become the lie/illusion.

in no way am i suggesting that an illusionist and a liar are mutually
inclusive.  i'm suggesting that there are similiarities mutually
exclusive of honor and integrity.

honor may be the key out of this prison, adhering to one's personal
truth in any event.

self-sacrifice is much easier than self realization, Andrew.

&quot;he&quot; is of your own creation, a protection from you.

&quot;he&quot; is yours.

&quot;you&quot; are are ours, &quot;you&quot; are who we know.

we remain free of the con.

to most of us nothing is so invisible as an unpleasant truth. it can
be held right in front of our very eyes, pushed under our noses,
rammed down our throats and we still don't know it or see it, nor do
we choose to.

freedom's just another word for nothin' left ta lose, and i truly
think you're on that thresh hold, and maybe freedom is something it's
time for you to consider and LIVE IT UP !

i will personally think that &quot;he&quot; is tired.

... and i personally guarantee that &quot;you&quot; will be accepted by everyone
that participates on these forums. it may take time and humility and
some convincing, but ultimately, doing the work is the means to an
end, worthwhile.

how can i guarantee that?

i have faith.

don't believe everything you think.

c'mon and give &quot;you&quot; a whirl.

you may even catch yourself having fun.

Did not write that you begged for benzodiazepines but rather that you
asked me to write you a prescription for them (anxiolytics).

Benzodiazepines are anxiolytics.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Simple straightforward question:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Rod, your rottweiler

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Name-calling simply shows that the Holy Spirit is absolutely
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; right to convict you:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://HeartMDPhD.com/Convicts

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; , claims you are resident at a hospital in Atlanta.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Which one? How long have you been working there, and in what
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; capacity?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Attempt at social engineering noted:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; WTF are you talking about? Just answer the question. Why does
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it have you stumped? You do know where you work, don't you? You
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; don't think you'd get away with accusing the prosecution in a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; court of law of &quot;attempted social engineering&quot; do you?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It's a straighforward enough question, and if you don't answer
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it, the readers of this thread can only assume that you find
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the question, and the truth it is aimed at revealing,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; embarrassing. I note that Rod has not been able to answer it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; either. Such a pity, as it was your opportunity to prove
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conclusively that you actually are a cardiologist.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Such is the utility of having GOD's peace, which transcends all
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; worldly understanding.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We, who are HIS brethren, remain secure in the truth, Who is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; LORD Jesus Christ.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You and other atheists, will remain insecure ever pining for

You asked for the prescription for benzodiazepines multiple times

and it don't work.  then you tried to explain it to me, and how it was
unconditional, blah blah blah... and i said &quot;so you would forgive
somebody that killed your wife and kid, even?&quot;  and you said &quot;yes.&quot;
THAT conversation was on Thanksgiving day, 2005.

btw, i talked to my ex today, i mentioned what you'd said about tha
script thang and guessie whattie... he heard the entire conversation.
he said &quot;dude's smokin' crack because you never asked him for a
script, i was there the whole time.   don't even pay him any
attention, he ain't worth it.&quot;  so i gotta witness if ya wanna fuck
with that'n... you even talked to him.  after y'all talked he said
&quot;why is he on the phone with YOU on thanksgiving day when he has a
family? he even said &quot;THAT guy's a doctor?  oh man.&quot;   i said

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Simple straightforward question:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Rod, your rottweiler

&gt;&gt; &gt; Name-calling simply shows that the Holy Spirit is absolutely right
&gt;&gt; &gt; to convict you:

&gt;&gt; &gt; http://HeartMDPhD.com/Convicts

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; , claims you are resident at a hospital in Atlanta.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Which one? How long have you been working there, and in what
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; capacity?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Attempt at social engineering noted:

&gt;&gt; WTF are you talking about? Just answer the question. Why does it have
&gt;&gt; you stumped? You do know where you work, don't you? You don't think
&gt;&gt; you'd get away with accusing the prosecution in a court of law of
&gt;&gt; &quot;attempted social engineering&quot; do you?

&gt;&gt; It's a straighforward enough question, and if you don't answer it,
&gt;&gt; the readers of this thread can only assume that you find the
&gt;&gt; question, and the truth it is aimed at revealing, embarrassing. I
&gt;&gt; note that Rod has not been able to answer it either. Such a pity, as
&gt;&gt; it was your opportunity to prove conclusively that you actually are a
&gt;&gt; cardiologist.

&gt; Such is the utility of having GOD's peace, which transcends all
&gt; worldly understanding.

It remains my choice to not be religious.

Actually, he's probably not lying about this! His last patient was
maybe eight years ago, so while he's waiting for his next patient...

Well, 8 years ago until now is quite a long interval, but it is an
interval.

Your repetitiveness/verbigeration indicates otherwise. Unless you're
pleading insanity, which would also explain what kind of patients you are
seeing, and what kind of doctor is treating both you and them.

&lt;snip troll droppings&gt;

BY THE WAY:

You haven't got away with not answering the question as to which hospital
you are treating patients at.

We all want to know.
