A refuge without welcome

Many Iraqis fleeing war have found a temporary home in Egypt. But
economic and cultural tensions breed hostility between 'Arab brothers.'

By Jeffrey Fleishman
Los Angeles Times Staff Writer

CAIRO --- He lives in the rich quarter but shops in the poor, driving
to the outskirts to buy vegetables and meat in the dirty, narrow alleys
of a bazaar where flies and barefoot children race through scents of
ginger and coriander.

Is this Mahmoud Mussa's fate? He doesn't know. All he's sure of is that
he sold one of his homes in Iraq for $25,000; the money ran out and he
sent his wife to Baghdad to sell the other one. That cash is
disappearing, too, and now, after 14 months as a refugee in a Cairo
suburb, Mussa has little left to sell or barter, and he's afraid he'll
slip out of his affluent neighborhood and end up in a place with broken
walls and tattered awnings.

He and his family escaped war, but sometimes there are worse things,
like watching everything you worked for in one country being siphoned
away in another.

He was a success in Iraq, a mechanical engineer with a couple of cars
and a housekeeper. But now he's just a restless man with a temporary
residency card looking to fill empty hours in a nation that in many
ways is poorer than the one he left. And they're not so friendly now,
the Egyptians. Walk through Mussa's suburb, known as 6th of October
City, and you hear it: in bakeries, on street corners, in schoolyards,
whispered euphemisms of patience turned sour.

&quot;Our relations are worsening with the Egyptians. They fight you
psychologically,&quot; Mussa said. &quot;If you try to start a business, they all
stand against you. They're poor and hungry people, and they saw us
coming out of Iraq with cars and money and they were scared -- they
feared we would compete with them.&quot;

Decades ago, hundreds of thousands of Egyptians migrated to Iraq to
work as farmers, laborers and technicians; now the flow has switched
and there's uneasiness over how to navigate the reversal of fortunes.
Egyptians and Iraqis call each other Arab brothers, yet they are
preoccupied with each other's idiosyncrasies, each hinting at a moral
superiority that blames the other for un-devout lifestyles and
lascivious souls.

&quot;I can't figure out their religion,&quot; Moh Nuri Hamza, a Shiite Muslim
refugee from southern Iraq, said of the Egyptians. &quot;Their women wear
head scarves, yet they wear tight, tight jeans below. I never let my
sisters-in-law leave the house. I don't want them corrupted.&quot;

About 100,000 Iraqi refugees live in Egypt, many of them in October
City, which sits beyond the Giza pyramids in air blanched with
limestone dust and snapping flags advertising new desert subdivisions.
The government of President Hosni Mubarak has reportedly limited the
number of Iraqis his country would accept, and so Egypt, which has been
generous in the past to those fleeing strife, is not contending with
the humanitarian crises that have spread across Syria, which has 1.2
million Iraqi refugees, and Jordan, which has as many as 750,000.

But a strained undercurrent drifts through October City, from Mussa's
bazaar to pastel apartment buildings trimmed with wooden shutters. It's
not loud, it doesn't shake the air. It's bridled words spoken between
clenched lips. /The Iraqis have pushed up rents. The Iraqis have
inflated the price of food/.

Many say that only a few Egyptians have grown inhospitable, that Iraqis
have been and are welcome here, but then someone like Mohamed Mokhtar,
a shopkeeper, brushes aside his genial nature.

&quot;If I were the person in charge,&quot; he said, &quot;I would deport them back to
Iraq.&quot;

Iraqis have their own hard opinions. Not far from Mokhtar's shop, past
a boy peeling garlic and another tinkering with a motorcycle, Ahmad
Badri said he was naive to the Egyptian skill in fleecing foreigners,
even ones fleeing war, when he arrived from Baghdad 18 months ago and
opened an Internet cafe.

&quot;The landlord charged me rent of 600 Egyptian pounds [about $107] a
month. I found out later it should have been 400,&quot; Badri said. &quot;The
next day the Egyptian shopkeepers around me came and said, 'Now you've
raised the rent on all of us.' They criticized me in a friendly way at
first, but today things are tense. It's starting to deteriorate and I'm
starting to hate them all. They're first-class vampires.

&quot;My 6-year-old daughter is talking like an Egyptian. I'm sending her to
a special language school so she won't develop that annoying accent.&quot;

Badri is nearly out of money. He's seen many like him forced to return
penniless to Iraq. They had arrived in October City with money and
jewelry hidden, but over weeks and months they sold what was precious
and found themselves balanced on a kind of descending scale, starting
in high-end neighborhoods and gradually tumbling toward smaller rooms
and rougher streets.

A thick-boned man with black stubble, whose meandering voice sought no
hurry in the afternoon heat, Badri fell silent, pointing to the air as
if bumping into an old friend. It was music from the Iraqi singer
Hussam Rassam coming from a radio; it troubled Badri as much as it made
him nostalgic.

&quot;How did we lose our country?&quot; Rassam sang. &quot;Five people dead on every
corner. The cop and the thief wear the same uniform.&quot;

The Iraqis in October City have their own shops and bakeries, and an
ice cream stand, Al Saquma, named after the one everybody went to in
Baghdad. These are the tricks and rhythms learned: The hummus here is
different; watch out for the scams; put your kids in private schools;
and make sure you know your way to the Ministry of Investment, where
for $500 you can apply to open a business, which gives you automatic
yearlong residency. If you don't open the business, go back next year
and apply for a different one.

&quot;There's an ongoing inflation targeted against Iraqis,&quot; said Nabeel
Shawi, a poet and photographer who wears suspenders and big sunglasses.
&quot;When I arrived last year, a four-bedroom house rented for 1,200
Egyptian pounds [about $214] a month, but that same house today won't
go for less than 3,000 pounds [$535]. Education is also very expensive.
My son's college tuition is $2,000 a year, and it might go to $3,000.
And all this while my money's about to vanish. It's the duty of the
United Nations to care for us.&quot;

Mahmoud Amer, an Egyptian grocer, is unsympathetic.

&quot;As Arabs, we should stand by the Iraqis, but they have to respect the
rules of our country,&quot; he said. &quot;When they open a business here and
hire Egyptians, they mistreat them. They always perceive themselves as
masters and perceive Egyptians as their servants. . . . Frankly
speaking, I myself don't like them.&quot;

The fact that Fatima Garibawy punched her daughter's Egyptian nanny
suggests the feeling is mutual. Garibawy lives in downtown Cairo in a
sixth-floor apartment overlooking a presidential palace. There are no
pictures on her walls; her sparse furniture is borrowed. Her husband is
dead. He was killed in Iraq, but she won't talk about it; words have
not been assigned to that memory.

She was a newspaper editor and active in Iraqi politics when she was
chased from her country by threats and the images of slain friends. She
arrived in Egypt with money and ideas. The first was to open a real
estate business.

&quot;It lasted a week and we closed it,&quot; said Garibawy, her dark hair
pulled back in a bandanna, her makeup doing its best against the city
heat. &quot;Egyptians claiming to be officials came asking for bribes.
'Where is your license?' That kind of thing. They interrogated us. But
I never paid bribes. . . . My next plan was to open a gym, but I was
conned out of 30,000 Egyptian pounds. I signed a fabricated contract
and was given a bogus receipt. They said they'd have me thrown out of
Egypt if I told anybody.&quot;

Her nanny orchestrated the ruse, she said. Garibawy said she had
trusted the woman and her family for months, paying them well to watch
her daughter when she visited Iraq last year on the hope that she could
resume life in Baghdad. She even lived in the nanny's home for a while,
believing she had found a refuge in a city of strangers.

&quot;When they stole that money from me I just lost my mind and punched her
in the face,&quot; Garibawy said. &quot;I'm out of cash. I'm losing my identity.
I hide my Iraqiness because if I speak with an accent the Egyptians
will exploit me. I think to them Iraqis are the chicken who lays the
golden egg.&quot;

Maybe, she said, she will go back to Iraq, cross borders with her
18-month-old daughter, find a teaching job at a university. She looked
up from a high-backed chair, an ornate, baroque thing that seemed out
of place amid the bare walls. &quot;You don't know how many times a day I
cry.&quot;

There's a bakery in October City that sells Iraqi bread, three to a
pack. It's run by a ninth-grader in a green head scarf and a
20-year-old man, whose bare legs are streaked with flour and whose
forehead is matted with black hair and sweat.

They want to go back to Baghdad, but they can't, so they've created
this place, strung with colored lights, to remind them of things they
don't want to forget. It's like that across October. The Iraqis here
just call it that, October.

A few miles from the bakery, rust plumes the walls and garbage blows in
the street. The scent of slaughtered sheep mixes with spices and blood.
The bazaar on the corner seems as rickety as a village built with
Popsicle sticks, but it bustles; the bargains in this poor quarter are
best late in the day. Mahmoud Mussa shops with his family here to save
money. His wife, Hanan, wears a black hijab and is discriminating about
quality and price. Her lipstick is pink.

Mussa smiles. He has found a way to be jovial, this father of four
forced to sell two houses, his money trickling away.

He has a mustache and broad shoulders; his eyes don't wander, they
lock. He is a Sunni Muslim. That used to be OK in Iraq, but now it's
not; now, he said, nothing in Iraq is OK, that's why he's got to find
more money, to keep from slipping back.

His younger son, who is taller, and follows his father's words as if
each one had a price, is neatly dressed; he seems to have wandered into
the bazaar by accident.

&quot;We went to the French, Swiss and Spanish embassies to get help for our
children, but we got no replies,&quot; Mussa says. &quot;We have to keep our
children out of Iraq. We are Sunni. We are threatened if we go
back. . . . The militias came to our house before we escaped and tried
to kidnap my son.&quot;

&quot;If we run out of money, we'll have to go back,&quot; Hanan says. She and
her husband have no connections here, no way to wheedle the system to
make it work for a family of refugees. Without money all things are
impossible.

The son listens, trying to make himself small amid stalls of vegetables
and poor Egyptians.
