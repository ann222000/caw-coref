Cost of Recycling?

Being born of depression era parents I was raised to waste as little as
possible which means that I'm generally in favor of as much &quot;recycling&quot;
as possible. I remember that during WWII (The &quot;big one&quot;) we saved and
recycled tstuff like the tinfoil from candy bar wrappers, and even
excess fat from broiling or frying meat, which my mom poured empty
coffee cans which got turned in at the butcher shop when they got filled
up. I once heard a probably apocryphal tale about a sign in a butcher
shop reading, &quot;Ladies, bring your fat cans in here&quot;. &lt;G&gt;

A friend mentioned to me last week that he'd read that the additional
cost to communities who include &quot;recycling&quot; in their municipal trash
collection always exceeds the cash income they receive from the
companies who buy the recyclables from them. He thought he remembered
that the report came from some national association of waste removal firms.

According to what my friend said he'd read, the additional cost to the
communities for labor, sometimes separate pickup and transportation,
separation and storage always end up costing them more than &quot;the stuff
is worth&quot;, a burden which must be passed on to the taxpayers of those
communities.

Can someone confirm that's generally so?

Thanks guys,

Jeff

I'm almost certain that this is the case here.  The only reason that
the council has invested so much in recycling schemes is because their
allocation of national funds is affected strongly by the amount of
landfill waste generated.  In other words, the council is effectively
fined for non-recycled waste.

It's very rare for recycling to be profitable in cash terms.

If you think of landfills as time bombs, having fewer of them with less
dangerous materials in them might be a benefit worth paying money for.
It's ironic that people worry about nuclear this and that and ignore
chemicals. Simple machines can detect radioactivity, try detecting any
number of the zillions of chemicals that might be a danger.

Perhaps the problem isn't that recycling can't pay, rather it's that the
way we recycle can't pay. For example, if you returned your grease and
oil to the butcher, that central location that you were going to anyway
could then be used by the recycling services to pick up a lot of
material at once. Better than having a waste grease/oil truck stop at
every house.

If materials were designed to be recycled, designed so that they could
be machine separated instead of labour intensively picked through, that
might change the equations markedly. For example, if tagents were put
into plastics that allowed a machine to know that this as type 1 and
this type 2 and this type 3 plastic, all that stuff could be dumped in
one bin and that would be that.

But how about just one bin and one truck stopping by, there's another
cost reduction. Why have the rubbish guy show up and then have the
recycling guy later do the same thing? Why not integrate the containers
such that one guy shows up and dumps the lot all at once?

A careful design of this might segregate materials into three grades,
the burnables, the landfill garbage and the recyclables. One truck shows
up, a mechanical arm grabs the container and it mechanically lifts it up
and orients it to dump into each waste stream. Think about how that
might actually be profitable since they could get the heat value of the
materials without the pollution from burning things you don't really
want to burn.

Much as I like the idea of burning garbage to generate electricity or
whatever, there is the problem that it is hard to burn a mixed,
unpredictable fuel cleanly.  You know what coal is, you know what each
grade of oil is, you know what natural gas is, and you can fine-tune
your furnaces and scrubbers accordingly.  Not so with domestic garbage,
even after you have removed the recyclables and non-burnables.

Thermal depolymerization can be used to turn almost any organic (in the
chemical sense) substance into something sort of like crude oil, which
can then be fractionated into desired fuels.  It works on plastics and
old tires, and some people think it could be made to work with municipal
sewage.

Down my street the logistics went haywire when they introduced
recycling.

Before recycling there was one pickup per week, of black plastic bags,
that picked up everything for the whole street.

Now the houses on my side of the street get two &quot;wheelie bin&quot; pickups on
Mondays, and once a month a &quot;textile&quot; pickup on Wednesday.

The sheltered accommodation on the other side of the street is exempt
from the recycling and doesn't have wheelie bins. They get a &quot;black
plastic bag&quot; pickup on Thursday.

Outside the community centre, in the middle of the sheltered
accommodation, there are now four big recycling bins for different types
of recyclables. Each bin gets its own pickup on Fridays.

So that's seven pickups per week, eight some weeks, instead of just the
one.

If the alternative is burning coal, you don't save any carbon by not
burning the garbage.  If a nation went to all nuclear electricity
generation and buried all of its garbage where it would never ever rot
and instead turn into replacement fossil fuels some day, now THAT would
be a net reduction in atmospheric carbon.

There are of course *other* pollution issues involved with burning an
unknown, variable fuel.

I would have thought the emissions could be reduced, though, if you
design the incinerator properly.  There are quite a lot of things that
have to be incinerated (biohazardous waste, for example) and that
seems to be managed acceptably.

I'm just wondering whether emissions aren't to some extent an
engineering problem - that if you're doing it right it won't be an
environmental problem?

Can any of the engineers here jump in?

Santa Cruz went from one pick-up a week to two (garbage one day,
recyclables plus yard waste another) and is back to a single pick-up
day for all bins-- it varies whether the garbage or recycling gets
picked up first, but after a few fits and starts, seems to work fairly
well.

Santa Cruz collects yard waste, and all sorts of recyclables including
mixed paper, all kinds of plastic except styrofoam, glass bottles but
not window glass, and metal. There is a separate program to dispose of
toxins like batteries and old paint. Santa Cruz County is apparently
part of a recycling development zone, to encourage recycling-based
manufacturing within a four-county area. One of the issues with
recyclables is quantity-- there is a certain threshold to overcome
wherein a little is useless, but a lot can be turned into something.
Santa Cruz County also offers free worm bins to encourage home
composting of food scraps.

I remember when paper recycling was derided as useless, but recyclers
persevered and quality went up while price went down. I think it's
insane to put refined metals into a landfill. I don't know the cost of
recycled glass vs melting sand, but I do know there is generally large
opposition to increasing or opening new landfills.

For a known waste--say, a bunch of 55 gallon drums of used acetone--
you can design your burning process optimally, and hope for no unpleasant
surprises.  (&quot;You used that acetone to rinse off WHAT?&quot;)

Mixed wastes are a pain in the ass for that reason.  Even if your waste
management officer knows which solvent goes in which barrel, most of the
factory staff don't, and don't even share a language in common with the
waste management officer.

In Melbourne (at least in my parents suburb) they handed out three
wheeliebins per house - one for garden waste, one for regular trash,
and one with a divider down the middle for paper and glass (I think
you could put aluminum in there too but we never had any...) The
regular trash was picked up once a week and the two recycling bins

Gasification can reduce the biomaterials to safe materials that can be
used for fertilizers. Keys include getting the temperatures correct and
the starting materials. Incinerators most often have been used to
essentially burn up the waste stream sans viable grading efforts. If you
don't burn materials that will make or have toxic chemicals, you are
basically using a renewable resource.

If the materials that are burnt come from the bioactivity of the planet,
basically from trees, it's a renewable resource that is essentially
carbon neutral. The key again is to not burn dangerous materials. That
means you have to keep TVs and batteries and that sort of thing out of
the incinerator. The best way to do that is to not put them in the
burnable waste stream in the first place.

You've essentially stated what I was getting at with why recycling isn't
cost sensible. So I asked why not just pick up all the waste like before
but segregated into the three grades of garbage, recyclables and
burnables, but in one pickup, even one container? A forth grade should
be incorporated by the individual, composting.

The standard process for making glass uses scrap broken glass. Of course
glass isn't really any sort of threat in a landfill. What's a threat is
stuff that is going to not compost but will leak out into the
groundwater some day. I can't believe people worry about nuclear waste
disposal and never worry about their local groundwater from their local
landfill.

were going to anyway, and they could add it to their recycled waste oil.
People drop off their used motor oil without it creating problems. But
the people I've talked to can't get over the idea that each consumer
only has a few quarts of the stuff and that one at a time isn't worth
it. Of course it isn't worth it one at a time, but get everyone together
and it's gold.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;A careful design of this might segregate materials into three grades,
&gt; &gt;the burnables, the landfill garbage and the recyclables. One truck shows
&gt; &gt;up, a mechanical arm grabs the container and it mechanically lifts it up
&gt; &gt;and orients it to dump into each waste stream. Think about how that
&gt; &gt;might actually be profitable since they could get the heat value of the
&gt; &gt;materials without the pollution from burning things you don't really
&gt; &gt;want to burn.

&gt; Much as I like the idea of burning garbage to generate electricity or
&gt; whatever, there is the problem that it is hard to burn a mixed,
&gt; unpredictable fuel cleanly.  You know what coal is, you know what each
&gt; grade of oil is, you know what natural gas is, and you can fine-tune
&gt; your furnaces and scrubbers accordingly.  Not so with domestic garbage,
&gt; even after you have removed the recyclables and non-burnables.

If you really took out the recyclables and the land fill stuff and the
hazardous wastes, what do you have in the end? You have waste paper. I
think that gasification systems can deal with that cleanly.

But what does it cost per gallon? You might go for gasification of the

Our area has gone insane, too:

We used to have one collection a week, for everything (grey wheely bins,
large for most, small for households with one or two people).

Then the council spent a fortune supplying us all with green bins (large
only; no small ones suitable for one or two), plus black boxes.

We were to put compostable waste in the green bin (fruit and beg
peelings/leavings; raw cardboard; garden waste) and various recyclables
(tins, glass, cloth, paper, foil-that-hasn't-been-in-contact-with-food) in
the black box.

The rest goes into the original grey bins; grey are picked up one week;
green/black the next.

Oh - and suddenly we were asked to separate out the plastic bottles, crush
them, and deliver them to local recycling skips (which aren't very local;
fun for anyone who doesn't own their own transport).

Now, thanks to tightened regulations that follow from your
E.coli-in-the-spinach and suchlike troubles, they've decided we can't put
kitchen waste in our big green bins any more. Since many of us are gardeners
and do lots of our own composting, this meant that too much raw cardboard
was going into the green bins, with too little of anything else for the
commercial shredders to make compost, so they banned the cardboard as well,
and asked us to take *that* to local recycling skips as well...

So once a fortnight we're supposed to put out our black boxes and our big
green bins - which now contain *at most* small amounts of cut flowers and/or
garden waste; meanwhile our grey bins are both overflowing and stinking by
the end of *their* fortnight.

All this has arisen because the UK government signed up to tighter European
recycling/landfill regulations, and then did absolutely bugger all as
regards setting up viable recycling facilities during the several-years
lead-in period. When the deadline arrived, they just slapped a panic
landfill tax on the local councils and told 'em to do their best to
encourage the growth of private commercial recycling (something that, since
we were far behind most of our Western European counterparts, required major
national effort and co-ordination).

Well, there are lots of places that still pay you cash directly
for aluminum, so it's probably a safe bet that the government
is doing OK for that part.

I don't know of any places myself that offers cash for glass, but
some places at least have deposit returns on glass bottles.  Those
are generally government mandated, so at least somewhat suspect,
but still, I think we can assume they're at least breaking even
on those.

Paper and other things that tend to go into the recycle bin?
I've never heard of any place offering any sort of money to
a consumer, even if the consumer is willing to drive the goods
himself to a drop-off point.  If the margins on such an endeavour
are so thin that they're not willing to pay me even when I'm
doing the transport, it's hard to believe that they government
is going to make money by coming to my house and then delivering
it.

So at least one part is probably a gain, another is mabye a gain
or even, and the rest is probably a loss.

In my area, at least, we just dump all of our recyclable stuff
into one bin and a truck comes by and grabs it all.  So then
extra sorting will have to be done--seperate the aluminum from
the glass from the multiple plastic types from the paper (and
we have the OK to toss envelopes with plastic windows in the
recycle bin, I assume those have to be sorted out as well).
This costs some amount as well.

Looking at all of that, even without hard numbers, it seems
unlikely that the programs are running at a profit to the
government.

Of course, that assumes that they're even selling to recycling
companies.  No cites, but I seem to recall a couple cities getting
busted for just sending the contents of the recycle bins into
the municipal waste dump.

Except that technology exists to separate glass of different colours. I
don't know what happens with broken glass, probably it would be
separated by screening, and then could remain mixed and used for low
grade dark coloured glass applications. The whole bottles could have
light shined through to a sensor which could then conclude what colour
each bottle was. Iron based cans can be removed with a magnet. Basically
all recyclables go into one container.

Part of the prolem, as you point out, is quantity. If I toss a small
amount of scrap metal into the recycling, it will probably cost them more
to handle it unless they get sufficient quantity. Also, there are various
grades of steel (and other metals) and I've heard that it isn't worth the
chance of spoiling a batch by having the wrong material in. Dunno how true
this is, scrap iron and steel was once a thriving industry.

It's a similar problem with glass. &quot;Starting with sand, you know the
characteristics of the glass that will come out. With mixed glass, you
won't get to adjust for specific qualties of the glass.

I have heard reports of newspaper, that was collected for recycling, being
taken to the landfill by various communities, because it couldn't be sold
for enough to cover the cost of handling. Again, dunno how common this is
any more.

The opposition to new landfills is one of the reasons driving what could
be considered faux recycling, as space becomes limited, additional fees
are put on materials thrown away.

Municipalities don't expect to generate cash from selling recyclables,
they just hope they'll be cheaper to dispose of than regular trash.
They usually are but whether the savings outweighs the added costs of
the collection process can be a close thing.  If you are efficient at
handling recycling, and/or have higher than average landfill costs it
makes financial sense.

This article discusses NYC which scaled back its recycling program in
2002 only to scale it back up a few years later when the economics
changed.  The article also cites Cecil!

Broken color-mixed glass cannot be used in container manufacturing,
and I don't think you will find any recycler investing in technology
to seperate it by color. Recyclers are selling it as a construction
aggregate, a high-performance substitute for sand and other
aggregates. In addition to using the glass as pipe-bedding and trench
backfill in place of rock aggregate, the recycled glass is used for
sand-blasting applications.  The recycled glass sand has also been
used for pool filters in place of conventional filter sand.

Last time I turned in glass, they didn't even want it separated by color.
So far as I know, glass bottles don't get recycled into more glass bottles.
At best they get turned into low-grade glass and ceramic building materials.
At worst, the bins of neatly separated glass, plastic, etc. get dumped into
a landfill--except for the aluminum.  That stuff is valuable.  The rest,
well, they want you to *feel* like you are recycling so that you will
continue to bring them your aluminum.

Here they pick up both the same day - recycling earlier in the
morning, garbage sometime later in the day, though that's probably
dependent on what neighbourhood you're in. The recycling truck appears
to have two big compartments: one for the paper (despite the fact that
they still give us separate bags for newsprint and for other papers)
and one for everything else (glass, metal and pretty well all types of
food grade plastics).
We get one collection a week, more or less -  it advances a day after
each holiday. Last week it was Thursday, this week will be Friday.
After the next holiday it'll skip to the Monday after.

My local city has recently introduced a recycling program.

Initially they came up with a scheme that would cost each household
$22 a month, including the $11 that's currently spent per household
gathering garbage.

After the uproar settled, they came up with a much cheaper plan, that
would cost $8 a month, not counting garbage pickup.  With the new plan
costing &quot;barely a third as much&quot; as the previous plan, it was quickly
adopted.  The main difference was the dropping of the plan to collect
compostable material.

Not one of the commentators seemed to notice that plan B was really $3
cheaper, rather than being $14 cheaper.

Anyhow, that answers Jeff's question -- a big city recycling scheme
introduced from scratch costs $8 to $11 a month per household.

My understanding here in Connecticut is that it costs to recycle
and it costs not to recycle but that it costs more NOT to recycle
than to recycle. In other words, tipping fees to the Town per ton
of garbage is considerably higher than the costs to dispose of
recycled items. As an example, for Washington, Connecticut:
tipping fees are $65.50/ton for trash and $33.50/ton for recyclables.

A former student of mine became director of the Connecticut
Siting Council and wrote several papers showing how one could
adjust the design of trash-to-energy incinerators to minimize
pollution problems. A lot of it has to do with the temperature
at which material is burned and control of air and gasses in
the stack. There was at first a problem with dioxins being
produced during incineration, but these can be almost completely
eliminated by proper design and operation.

There is a building materials recycling place in San Francisco where I
take useful materials that I've demo'ed as part of a job. The accept
glass, even broken glass, since they break it further, tumble it, and sell

It probably wasn't that they couldn't, under better circumstances, but
that the mfg line wasn't set up for it. In a lot of plastics mfg, the line
is set up to use pellets of uniform size. Breaking up the miscast material
to a uniform size wouldn't have been economical for them, but might have
been for a factory set up to do that.

I'm guessing though, that the material was cheap enough that it wasn't
economical to try to recycle it, even in the the quantities and quality
they generated.

Much of the current recycling counts of the goodwill of people willing to
do work for no compensation, not to mention charging them recycling fees
that are difficult to recover.
