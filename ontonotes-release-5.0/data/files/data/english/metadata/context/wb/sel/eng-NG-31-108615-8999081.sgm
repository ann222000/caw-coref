If it takes forty minutes to bake a cake, how long is forty minutes?

There is no separation in time between the egg and the chicken. The
only separation is the events we push between them!

If the future is always in front, why is it always the last to arrive?

Is this a riddle or an observation?  In any event, the breakage of
the egg shell is a good separator.

There isn't.  The chicken starts with the fertilized cell, and
proceeds in time to grow larger.  Usually a chicken in not a
viable organism until the shell breaks.

Your example does not work. I don't see why we should fail to include
the minor events if they are already introduced into the proposition
of moving from garage to garage. One station only comes 'after'
another according to our associations of events. Time does not come
into it.

Here's a better example. If you speak to someone and they reply, then
the reply only comes 'after' your speaking by association with a third
event. If you argue against that and say 'but the other person could
not have replied without my speaking first', then my response is
simple. Together you communicate. Now if the communication is broken
down into its parts you lose what it is to communicate, so you would
not be able to say 'but the other person could not have replied
without my speaking first'.

Time is a modern invention that only the western world has invented.
The foolishness of spatio-temporal notions riddle science and is
embedded in our culture as a sort of blind faith.

I notice you are very quick to cry 'mysticism', too quick. You are
remembering old battles and simply, pointlessly, waving your old flags

You are what is called in philosophy a 'trancendent metaphysician' -
its like being a mystical physicalist. As a metaphysician you believe
in the reality of things beyond any capacity to measure or understand
them. So you lost it when you claimed that time is measurable. Stop

&gt;&gt; It isn't about me.  It is about your false claims,
&gt;&gt; and unsupported suppositions.  See you are
&gt;&gt; struggling really hard to reinvent quantum
&gt;&gt; mechanics.

&gt;&gt; What we don't have is a method of getting from
&gt;&gt; &quot;shit happens&quot; (QM) to &quot;it happens here, this
&gt;&gt; fast, for this long, etc.&quot; (classical mechanics).

&gt;&gt; If you want to learn something, and make a
&gt;&gt; contribution, your efforts will be welcomed.
&gt;&gt; Otherwise you are just another clown in the
&gt;&gt; back of the class making shadows on the wall
&gt;&gt; using his hands.

&gt; ..what .. are ... you ... talk ...ing ... about ...

You.  The person that blames &quot;western civilization&quot; for time,
showing no awareness of history.  Obviously parroting something
you read somewhere.

again fro your Oct 2nd post:

Your foolishness is displayed *for years*.  Posts are available
back at least as far as 1995.  And I am more than happy to
research and remind you of your every faux pas, if you feel it to
be necessary.  We have quite a selection already...

Care to start talking sense now?
