My DD (will be 4 in 2 months) loves books. Her memory is quite good. If
I read her a book twice, the third time she remembers the context,
words based on the picture on every page and "reads" to her sister. She
wants to learn how to read. She asked me point-blank to teach her to
read. I started to teach her letters, the sounds they make etc.

This is our problem: On day 1: I introduced her to the very first basic
level BOB book. I made her read the book. She loved it. The second day,
I asked her to re-read the book. For the most part, she just remembered
what's on each page based on the previous day's reading and repeated
it. She didn't actually read by looking at the word. She just read by
looking at the pictures. I tried to cover the pictures and she got
upset. This is just one example. I also wrote few common words on a
piece of paper and stuck it on the wall. I showed her what each of
those mean. The next day she read about 80% of them correctly just by
looking at how the word looks, not because of the letters in each word.
I hope I'm making sense. This was 6 months ago. Even now it's the same.

I got frustrated by the way she remembers how a word "looks". I stopped
teaching her to read. I just continued reading books for her. She keeps
asking me for "sounds books" (her word for BOB books) and I feel bad
for not being able to teach her properly. She's obviously intelligent.
I just don't know how I can utilize her skill properly. I appreciate
any suggestions.

Thanks.

I'm not sure I understand the problem?  It sounds
like you are insisting that she learn via phonics, and she's
picking things up by sight.  Why can't she?  Eventually she'll
learn to sound out words when it's useful to her.  Why can't
she learn things the way she wants now?  It's not like you're
somehow damaging her because you're allowing her to learn some
sight words at four years old.  Some kids are very successful
with this reading strategy for quite some time.  Follow her
lead and answer her questions.  She'll be fine.

Best wishes,

This isn't a problem, it's a natural stage of reading.  Let her figure
out the words in whatever way makes sense to her.  If you refuse to
teach her until she can do it "right" you'll take away her pleasure in
reading.

I think some kids do just go through the early stages of reading by just
knowing how a word looks, there is more than one way to learn to read. I
think my mum said I was this way to start with and I don't think it ever did
me any harm. Keep going over the same words, add in some new ones, keep
refreshing the letters and sounds, so that she still has those tools. When
she comes across a new word, go through the steps of working out what it
sounds like, but if she then remembers it the so be it, she's learnt another
word and eventually she'll grasp how to work out what a word is. The english
language has so many variations anyway, that phonics is not a strict rule as
to how things sound, there are many exceptions, I really would not worry at
all and just enjoy it, if she can read something whether it's by memory or
whatever, that deserves praise!

I am sure I learned to read by word recognition and not by phonics.  I
think I partly taught myself.  I also taught my sister to read the
same way - we didn't really "do" phonics in my day (I was starting
school in 1942).   Even to this day I have a problem sounding out a
word.  I never learned to spell - what letters were in each word -
until I learned to type and then of course I had to type each letter
separately

There are fads in teaching reading - partly due to the fact that some
people learn better one way and some learn another way.  It is
perfectly OK, and even proper for her to learn partly by sight words
and partly by phonics.  Whatever works for her.

I think maybe you should make a game of covering the pictures up,
rather than a sort of punishment.

Like everyone says, she is learning to read - just not quite in the way
you expected :) It sounds like she's using the "Whole Word" method while
you want her to learn using Phonics. Both are valid methods and probably
both are needed.

Continue to give her the BOB books and let her go with it the way it
works for her.  But also continue with the individual letter sounds
separately from the BOB books.  Later, you can use the individual letter
sounds and put them together to form words in the BOB books.

Hi --

I'd get a set of letters, wooden or magnetic ones, or perhaps blocks,
and make sounds (not just words) out of them.   Let your daughter try to
make sounds too.  Make rhyming sounds.  Make sad, bad, lad, rad, fad
.... and let her take away one letter and replace it with another to
discover the new sound.  See if she can figure out the phonics rules on
her own.  Keep making the whole experience fun, a game.

What you're doing  with this methods is teaching her to DECODE, which
isn't the same as reading.  But it IS a first step.  Other pre-reading
skills include being able to recognize indvidual letters and say what
sounds they make, being able to rhyme (which includes playing rhyming
games where she guesses the last words in a rhymed couplet), filling in
the end of a sentence from contextual clues (ie, "I'm too hot.  Let me
take off my ..." and she looks at you and fills in "jacket".)  You can
also let her find words she recognizes in longer texts that she hasn't
already read.

You can help her learn sequencing (what comes first, what comes next).
Ask her if the wolf huffs and puffs first or if the house blows down
firsst, for example.  You can work on which part is the beginning, which
part is the end.

Sorry if this is  bit disorganized.  Whatever else you do, make sure you
BOTH enjoy the process!

Have fun,

I don't know the anwer to this, but are there games you can get that would
help her learn the words? You might also get her computer games. (I almost
said computer games that she can plan on the computer. Gee, where else would
you play them? At the tennis court?)

These games could make learning words fun for her.

Games like leap frog might be appropriate for her.

Also, point out words to her when you are in the store (like tomato over the
tomatos), words on road signs and on menus (like broccoli, cheese, sausage
at the pizza place; you might also point out that "anchovi" means "yuck.").
(Remember to keep your eyes on the road, not the signs, as you drive and
lead the way.)

And, of course, give her positive feedback as she learns more and more
words.

She'll learn to sound out words when she is ready.

Try Writing to Read.

Writing to Read by John Henry Martin, Andy Friedberg

Make word walls with words she wants to know.  (that means put the
words up on the wall so she can see them).

Some games you can make here:

there isn't such thing as a "right" way to teach reading, there have been
movements at various times that are utterly convinced phonics is the wrong
way, though it would seem to me that it is up there as having stood the test
of time and working reasonably consistently, but if a different method works
for your child, then there isn't such a thing as a wrong way to learn to
read.

Honestly, color me lazy, but I wouldn't worry
so much about the how.  She's obviously bright and motivated.
I'd just answer her questions, follow her lead, read to
her, give her written words for things, and leave it at
that.  I don't know that I'd actively teach reading by
sight.  I just wouldn't get bent out of shape if that's
how she was approaching it at this age.

You could try this book:
Teach your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons (check it out on amazon.com).

My dd was quite good at word recognition as a toddler and around age 4
we got this book which helped me teach her the concepts.  She didn't
grasp onto reading right away (and we did it only for fun because she
wanted to, no pressure type thing), but this method helped her a lot.
By the end of kindergarten she was reading proficiently and now in 1st
grade tests at 99%ile for reading.

Do you mean she's remembering how a word looks or where its on a page?
If it's where it is on a page then look at doing flashcards. #2 (age 3)
memorises where things are and will apparently read quite hard books that
she knows.
If it's word recognition then keep with that method. It's a valid way of
reading. I got phonics half way through reading Lord of the Rings. That's
how far you can get with word recognition.
I'd do flashcards.
I've been doing flashcards with #2 and she can read a few simple books, I
think she's on about 50+words now. She also picks up words on her own since
I started flashcards. You have to learn some words by recognition anyway
(try spelling out was, what, said etc.) so why not start with those if it
concerns you. When I introduce a new flashcard I'll sound it out for them if
relevant.
The way #2 works best is we have her current list of words up on her wall.
In the evening she can ask to do them as part of the routine. Sometimes
she'll be doing them every night, other times she won't want to do it. I
never do it if she doesn't want to. If she gets them all right (or nearly)
then she gets a new word. She usually knows the new word by the next night.
(you have to keep changing the words round too)
Once she knows a word she'll point it out in books, newspapers, signs etc.
I think generally teaching phonics to under 5s is an uphill battle. Some
children get it very easily, others take a lot longer. Neither method's
better. My brother was writing phonetically at just over 3. I didn't get it
till nearly 7. Actually I'm the keener reader if that helps.
Go with her method of learning. It'll be much happier for both of you.

I think perhaps you ought to step back, and try and work out what you
want to achieve.  At the moment, it sounds a bit like your daughter says
she wants to learn to read  - meaning perhaps be able to recognise some
words on a page - and you are trying to teach her to Read - be able to
decode all and any document shes come across.

There are probably several different things you want for her when she is
school age.  You want her to be able to decode unfamiliar words (ie to
know phonics).  You also want her to see books as enjoyable, and to have
a fun time teaching her new things.

At the moment, the best thing is probably to focus on is enjoying books
together.  Yes, when she says she is reading, she has merely memorised
the form of the words, but that isn't a bad thing.

I don't know, maybe it bothers you that you aren't using the BOB books
the way the publisher intended (I'm not familiar with the BOB books).
However, if you asked the publisher whether it was more important to use
them in the right way, or for your daughter to enjoy reading, I'm sure
they would say that the enjoyment of reading was the more important thing.

I think you misinterpreted her request.  She wants to read.  That doesn't mean

&gt; This is our problem: On day 1: I introduced her to the very first basic

&gt; I asked her to re-read the book. For the most part, she just remembered
&gt; what's on each page based on the previous day's reading and repeated

&gt; looking at the pictures. I tried to cover the pictures and she got

But this is how the kids in DS1's class learnt to read.  The pictures are
contextual clues.  The kids started off remembering the stories, so they were
pretending to read, really, but gradually they started to recognise particular
words.  (I should mention for the phonics nazis that she also provided phonics
instruction, but *reading stories* was not the time where that was done.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I also wrote few common words on a
&gt; piece of paper and stuck it on the wall. I showed her what each of

That is actually *good*.  Most of us spend our time sight-reading -- we only
have to slow down to decode unfamiliar words -- but it sounds to me like she
already has a sight-reading vocabulary.  Does she recognise those words in
other contexts?

Give her the books she likes and help her read them.  Read to her, with her,
and help her if she hits an unfamiliar word.  I found Mem Fox's Reading Magic
to be very helpful in encouraging me to do exactly what parents have always
done.  Here is her website:

Gosh - there's a lot of preformed opinion here.

Only read, she's too young.
That she's young means that sight/recognition would be appropriate (even though
there's no hard feelings regarding "phonics nazi's")

Why would either of these be true?

I was in kindergarten, one that taught reading, a year early, when I was four.
The reason why was that by time I was three I was asking my mother about what
the *letters* sounded like and was pulling down encyclopedias and figuring out
the roman numerals on the index pages.  Written language in the western world is
based on the representation of phonemes, and I knew that full well by looking at
it.  C'mon - LOOK at it.

IMO, the recent strong push for phonetics is a reaction to the earlier hype (and
its unfortunately wide dispersal in the curriculum of primary grades) of the
"whole word" concept.  Call it reactionary, maybe, but not "nazi".    Now, at
least it's been replaced, but unfortunately rather confusingly replaced by a
mixed curriculum purporting to teach by learning style, but perplexing many by
presenting both to all kids.

If she's receptive to a (gentle, unrushed) presentation of reading in a
phonetics framework, there's no reason not to proceed.

Or, she may be more receptive to a "whole word" framework, associating the word
arrangements with objects.

Either way, it may actually give her a chance to learn before becoming
confusified by current public school practices.

if she remembers how a word 'looks', even in a different

the word is, then she's reading.
not all kids learn through phonics. i was reading before i
even knew my alphabet. i knew that that combination of
squiggles meant that word, even though i couldn't tell you
letters or letter sounds, per se.
let her read through memorization if that's the way she
learns. i think the only "wrong" way to teach reading is to
make it boring.
if she seems to learn words by how they 'look', you could
label things around the house (my mom realized i was reading
at three when i asked how to say 'thermometer')

It does sound like she's learning by the "whole word" concept, and that's fine.
I'd go with that and do what you're doing (reading, showing her common words).
She's probably just asking for more of that.

It's a matter of learning style.  When she gets to school, she'll most probably
be presented with a combination of "whole word" and "phonics" anyway, with the
intent that some kids will pick up the material by one way; some by the other.

It may even be better that she makes progress now.  My son was confused in the
first two grades largely by the dual presentation.  He was very concrete-minded
at that time, and wanted to know what was "right".  Understanding that he could
(and *how* to) mentally discard what wasn't working for him was farther beyond
him than just learning to read by a consistent method.

But to make progress now you need to understand that her learning style is very
apparent, is a well recognized learning style, and is not "wrong".

You might *try* a gentle presentation of some phonics as a supplement.  But if
she's getting her learning excitement from associating the words with their
meanings, you really don't want to do anything to thwart that.

Banty (stong phonics learner)

I think that in general, kids who are pushing to
learn to read before kindergarten are kids whom you can
generally trust to find the path that works for them.
That's why I would suggest simply enabling what she
is trying to do herself, rather than imposing a particular
strategy.  If she needs a strategy imposed in order to
learn to read, she'll get that soon enough (and without
mucking with the pleasure of parent and child reading
together).  Right now, she's got a strategy and it seems
to be working for her, so I don't see a reason to try
to "break" her of her current approach and substitute
a different one instead.  Let her run with it and see
where it gets her.
Also, I don't know that school approaches are
necessarily confusing.  Neither of my kids, bright as
they are, were interested in learning to read before they
went to school.  Both learned quickly and easily at
school and didn't find it confusing at all.  They learned
to sound out some works and read others by sight and
didn't have any problem with the concept that different
strategies might be appropriate for different words
(not to mention different kids).
I'm sure that there are some kids and teachers
for whom the learning to read process is a struggle, for
various reasons.  I just wouldn't borrow trouble.  I
think the kid who is ready and willing to read before
school generally doesn't need much except for everyone
else to get out of her way (and perhaps support her
efforts).  The kid who isn't ready and willing will
likely learn just fine when she gets to school age.
The parent who pushes (either by trying to get a kid
to read before he or she is ready and willing, or
by forcing a particular method on a kid who is
ready and willing) just asks for trouble, I think.
By the by, I was not saying that sight reading
was appropriate because she was young.  Reading via
that method can be appropriate for different people at
different ages.  I was saying that because she is young,
the risk of following her lead and allowing her to do
what feels natural and successful to her is very low.
If it works, great.  If it doesn't, she has plenty of
time to learn another strategy.  She has the luxury of
time, so why fuss over it?

Best wishes,
Ericka

There's nothing wrong with teaching a toddler to read AS LONG AS he or
she wants to, and you aren't pushing them before they are ready. In
other words, follow *their* lead.

At age 4, we started playing word games with my daughter, to support
the sound/letter that they were studying at pre-school. So if it was
"A" week, we'd list as many A words as we could. It was like a game -
we'd be sitting at the dinner table, thinking up as many words as
possible. It wasn't long before my daughter caught on, and was coming
up with her own A-words. It was fun, and you should have seen her
sparkly eyes when she came up with one on her own.

She also has one of those Leapfrog toys - it's a set of refridgerator
magnets - one for each letter of the alphabet, and a base unit (also
magnetic) with a speaker on it. You put the A magnet into it, and push
a button, and it says the name of the letter, and what sounds it makes.

I dislike them (not necessarily on principle--just

Sounds very much like my daughter.  She has (and has always had) an
excellent memory.  While she wasn't an extremely early reader (she
started really reading the summer before kindergarten, so she was 5
1/2) she had built up a good sized stock of sight words long before
that. (I remember her looking over my shoulder one day ... she was
probably 3-ish, and pointing to a word and saying "That says 'People'"
-- and she was correct.  Phonics was, however, always a mystery to her.
We'd be reading together and I'd point to an easy word (one that she
already knew similar words to) and ask her to try and sound it out.  So
the conversation might go:

"What's this word?"
[Random guess]
"What does c-a-t spell?" (She knew 'cat' by sight.)
"Cat."
"Spell this word?"
"B-A-T."
"And what sound does "b" make?"
"Buh"
"So, cat with a buh sound  at the beginning is?"
"Baby?"

And so on ... she struggled with phonics through much of grade school,
but ALWAYS read several years above grade level.  (She's now in 9th
grade, grasps phonics, and reads several years above grade level, ..
and is an appalling bad speller.)

Where did I say my severely learning disabled child was a "she"?

Well, I gave up trying to force learning in my toddler when he could not
even do something as simple as "talk".

For the other two children I took a far more relaxed approach and just read
to them.  What is also useful (idea from oldest child's speech therapist)
was to get wordless books and to have the child describe what they see on
the page.  It helps if what is happening on the page was outlandish (like
frogs flying on lily pads).

Completely normal. In fact, fluent readers use more than just phonics to
read. We use background knowledge, context, picture cues, etc all to
construct meaning. Reading is the *construction of meaning* not just putting
sounds together.

Also, she's not even four yet. She'll get it. She's halfway there.

We have that as well. My only caveat is to make sure the letters say the
correct letter and the correct sound.  We got one batch where the letter
name was correct but the sound was NOT (e.g., Letter B makes the sound
"K").  Having one child with reading/spelling issues, I certainly didn't
want to train the younger child to have them!

have you had her evaluated for dyslexia? it would be an atypical

making it very very difficult to study, I didn't need classic concessions

because I couldn't take notes and follow a lecture, I'd end up with a poor

notes to refer too, stuck between a rock and a hard place, I was too proud
to take the easy offer of evaluation at that stage, so even if you feel it's
no help now, do watch her in the next few years, the troubles I had could

wow, 7, I honestly think I was even older, I don't think phonics was evening
being taught in most UK schools when I was learning to read, I seem to
recall between about the ages of 11 and 13, that it dawned on me that some
words I was reading and mentally sounding out completely incorrectly were
the same as words a teacher was using! Particularly in relation to words
used in biology, mostly human anatomy, I'm struggling to remember any
examples, but at the time, I felt mortified and wouldn't have told anyone!
Even now, there are some words which you almost never say and if I do say
them, there is a reasonable chance they'll be wrong, I don't even know
whether that's because they don't go by standard phonics rules, or if I'm
applying the phonics incorrectly!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I'm not sure I understand the problem?  It sounds
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like you are insisting that she learn via phonics, and she's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; picking things up by sight.  Why can't she?  Eventually she'll
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learn to sound out words when it's useful to her.  Why can't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she learn things the way she wants now?  It's not like you're
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; somehow damaging her because you're allowing her to learn some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sight words at four years old.  Some kids are very successful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with this reading strategy for quite some time.  Follow her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lead and answer her questions.  She'll be fine.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Best wishes,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OP here. Thanks for your reply.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know there are lot of resources and info on how to teach using
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phonics method. But how do you really teach by sight/recognition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; method? Just by repetition and rhyming?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I appreciate any suggestions, links and books.

&gt;&gt;&gt;All you do at the toddler stage is to read to your child.  Nothing else.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It could be the Bob books (which my kids hated), or the Dr. Seuss books,
&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Berenstain Bears books, or any book at all.  It also helps if it is a book
&gt;&gt;&gt;they are interested in.  My severely learning disabled child loved &quot;Thomas
&gt;&gt;&gt;the Tank Engine&quot;, so we had lots of those.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Try planning lots of trips to the library.

&gt;&gt; Gosh - there's a lot of preformed opinion here.

&gt;&gt; Only read, she's too young.

&gt;I'm sorry... What did I say that was wrong?
">

I disagree with you that "All you do at the toddler stage is to read to your
child.  Nothing else."

If a child is curious and very interested in reading and actually *asks* to be
taught to read, there's no reason to restrict oneself to reading to the child.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; That she's young means that sight/recognition would be appropriate (even
&gt;&gt; though
&gt;&gt; there's no hard feelings regarding &quot;phonics nazi's&quot;)

&gt;&gt; Why would either of these be true?

&gt;Where did I say my severely learning disabled child was a &quot;she&quot;?

You were responding to Tedneeley.  I wasn't referring to your child.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Well, I gave up trying to force learning in my toddler when he could not
&gt;even do something as simple as &quot;talk&quot;.

&gt;For the other two children I took a far more relaxed approach and just read
&gt;to them.  What is also useful (idea from oldest child's speech therapist)
&gt;was to get wordless books and to have the child describe what they see on
&gt;the page.  It helps if what is happening on the page was outlandish (like
&gt;frogs flying on lily pads).
">

I must conclude that either your other children are simply different from the
O.P's (nothing at all wrong with that), or that you limited them by limiting
yourself.  I suspect it's the former; at least I hope so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I was in kindergarten, one that taught reading, a year early, when I was
&gt;&gt; four.
&gt;&gt; The reason why was that by time I was three I was asking my mother about
&gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt; the *letters* sounded like and was pulling down encyclopedias and figuring
&gt;&gt; out
&gt;&gt; the roman numerals on the index pages.  Written language in the western
&gt;&gt; world is
&gt;&gt; based on the representation of phonemes, and I knew that full well by
&gt;&gt; looking at
&gt;&gt; it.  C'mon - LOOK at it.

&gt;&gt; IMO, the recent strong push for phonetics is a reaction to the earlier
&gt;&gt; hype (and
&gt;&gt; its unfortunately wide dispersal in the curriculum of primary grades) of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &quot;whole word&quot; concept.  Call it reactionary, maybe, but not &quot;nazi&quot;.    Now,
&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt; least it's been replaced, but unfortunately rather confusingly replaced by
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; mixed curriculum purporting to teach by learning style, but perplexing
&gt;&gt; many by
&gt;&gt; presenting both to all kids.

&gt;&gt; If she's receptive to a (gentle, unrushed) presentation of reading in a
&gt;&gt; phonetics framework, there's no reason not to proceed.

&gt;&gt; Or, she may be more receptive to a &quot;whole word&quot; framework, associating the
&gt;&gt; word
&gt;&gt; arrangements with objects.

&gt;&gt; Either way, it may actually give her a chance to learn before becoming
&gt;&gt; confusified by current public school practices.

&gt;Ooooh... is this post meant for the OP and not me?  Could you be more

This also sounds like my daughter who at 9 reads above grade level but

grade). The evaluator couldn't definitively say she has dyslexia but
recommended tutoring using the Wilson Language method that is used to
teach dyslexics how to read.  The Wilson Language helped her immensely
with her reading and spelling. While her initial spelling is still quite
poor, she is now able to catch mistakes (not all mistakes) in
proof-reading her work and she is much more confident in her schoolwork.

LOL, they are probably non-standard.  I read 'funereal' and 'misled' wrongly
for YEARS before I heard them pronounced.  I knew what they meant, but it
never occurred to me that 'misled' was the past tense of 'mislead' rather than
'misle'!

DS1 taught himself to read well before school and his K teacher's THRASS
programme fit in very well as he wasn't writing much (like many boys, not
interested).  He was the only child in his class who read English before
school started, I think, and some of the others didn't have much English.  By
the end of the year they were all reading and writing with a fair degree of
confidence, so THRASS worked for all of them.

I wouldn't be surprised if this particular variety of dyslexia is difficult
to diagnose with much accuracy until a bit later on. I should look into this
method, DH is dyslexic, but also high functioning in terms of reading and
writing, for him coordination was a major issue and he needed therapy at a
young age for very basic stuff, but with that background, it wouldn't be at
all surprising if one or both of our kids have some kind of issue, but
without being classic dyslexic, so having a tool that can point them in the
right direction could turn out to be very helpful, so thanks for giving me
the name of one!

I have to say, that in this particular instance, as you kept in text from
both the OP and HCN, it did read as if you were responding to HCN's response
to the OP, rather than directly to the OP, which on first reading made your
post not make complete sense to me, though it became clear by the end that
the "she" you were talking about was the child of the OP, so whilst it's
fair and correct to say a response shouldn't be taken as a personal letter,
in this case, I can see where the confusion came from.

Interesting, for good or bad, I'm not very aware of expected difference
between the sexes (the earlier pincer grip exhibited by DD was a surprise,
confirmed to be a girl thing and the other difference I'm aware of, girls
speaking earlier, is way out in this instance!), but I was surprised by the
lack of interest in writing, DS as far as I can tell is fairly normal for
3.5, can pick out a reasonable number of letters, is interested in reading
and can pick out his name and also his sisters, but he's really keen to
write, I picked up a craft he had done yesterday and though the teacher had
written his name on it, when I turned it over, he'd quite clearly attempted
to label it himself, ok, so Nathanael isn't spelt NANL, but it's a darn good
attempt! We're doing entirely child led stuff, which basically means not
much right now, but at this rate, writing won't be something we'll be
concerned about. Do you happen to know any connections between left
handedness and writing (or reading for that matter), he's quite clearly
strongly left handed.

Try some phonic idea first, such as APPLE. Start with A that sound ae,
ae, then AP that sounds ap, ap ... then she gets the idea from previous
pronunciation memory from suggestion of your mouth, oh yes, it is
APPLE. Your child approach is top down, just we adult's way are, that
is she tries to recognize  words w/o even thinks about it.  The
standard for most kids are phonic approach that lead to instant
recognition of words few yrs later.

&gt; Try some phonic idea first, such as APPLE. Start with A that sound ae,
&gt; ae, then AP that sounds ap, ap ... then she gets the idea from previous
&gt; pronunciation memory from suggestion of your mouth, oh yes, it is
&gt; APPLE. Your child approach is top down, just we adult's way are, that
&gt; is she tries to recognize  words w/o even thinks about it.  The
&gt; standard for most kids are phonic approach that lead to instant
&gt; recognition of words few yrs later.

Depends from where you come from as to what the standard way of teaching the
children: word recognition or phonics.

&gt;&gt; My DD (will be 4 in 2 months) loves books. Her memory is quite good. If
&gt;&gt; I read her a book twice, the third time she remembers the context,
&gt;&gt; words based on the picture on every page and &quot;reads&quot; to her sister. She
&gt;&gt; wants to learn how to read. She asked me point-blank to teach her to
&gt;&gt; read. I started to teach her letters, the sounds they make etc.

&gt;&gt; This is our problem: On day 1: I introduced her to the very first basic
&gt;&gt; level BOB book. I made her read the book. She loved it. The second day,
&gt;&gt; I asked her to re-read the book. For the most part, she just remembered
&gt;&gt; what's on each page based on the previous day's reading and repeated
&gt;&gt; it. She didn't actually read by looking at the word. She just read by
&gt;&gt; looking at the pictures. I tried to cover the pictures and she got
&gt;&gt; upset. This is just one example. I also wrote few common words on a
&gt;&gt; piece of paper and stuck it on the wall. I showed her what each of
&gt;&gt; those mean. The next day she read about 80% of them correctly just by
&gt;&gt; looking at how the word looks, not because of the letters in each word.
&gt;&gt; I hope I'm making sense. This was 6 months ago. Even now it's the same.

&gt;&gt; I got frustrated by the way she remembers how a word &quot;looks&quot;. I stopped
&gt;&gt; teaching her to read. I just continued reading books for her. She keeps
&gt;&gt; asking me for &quot;sounds books&quot; (her word for BOB books) and I feel bad
&gt;&gt; for not being able to teach her properly. She's obviously intelligent.
&gt;&gt; I just don't know how I can utilize her skill properly. I appreciate
&gt;&gt; any suggestions.

&gt;&gt; Thanks.

Actually APPLE isn't a good word to illustrate phonics,  especially if
the child is not phonics-oriented. DD would try to pronounce the second
P as well as the E.  As for spelling the word, she probably would come
with apl, appul, apul, apol.

Better to start with a short 3 letter wod containing a short vowel
followed by a consonant, such as SAD or BAG.

yikes, this is getting scary, I'm also fairly ambidextrous, I tend not to

It's also a little bit like me in that I'm sure I was reading well
before the school decided to teach me.  I'm relatively sure that we
did not do phonics.  I remember my first reading book started out
something like "Look Look Look"  "See the bus"  See Dick and Jane and
Spot run"

Anyway I always thought that I didn't spell well because I learned
whole words and never looked to see what letters were in them.  I
didn't really learn to spell until I had to type.  But now I think
that there was a little dyslexia as well - more with math (I still
count on my fingers) and things like right and left (which I still
don't know too well).

I don't know whether I would have been helped by any of the tutoring
methods

A question.. for those of you that are mildly dislexic (sorry if this isnt
the right wording) , can you read upside down?  No I dont mean can you stand
on your head and read :P  Can you look at a book upside down and read as
well as right side up?

I looked at that website and the program looks interesting.  Do you
think it could be useful in speech therapy for a non-verbal child who
has difficulty forming his mouth into the sounds?  I am very tempted

I can do it with no problem, I'm not even sure I read slower upside down.
Also reading in the mirror doesn't bother me at all.  And yet, I can't tell
my right from my left, and can never figure out the "your finger and thumb

Hi.
I`ve got a 5 year old son. He`s in year 1 now. I realy understand what
you are trying to say. He does the same thing.
I read a book with him, then ask him to read with my help. The next
time he reads it himself. It seams thet he just remembers the words in
the right order.
But personally i think its great. Its just a way of learning the
written words. By remembering how they look.
I think you should let your doughter read the way she can. Its not
going to do her any harm.
She will learn more and more new words, its great.
Hope that helps a little bit

Yes I can.  Is this a sign of dyslexia?  As a teen, I could also write
upside down and backwards (as in if you turned it around, the words are
readable).  My spelling and reading are fine but I cannot sound out
words at all.
