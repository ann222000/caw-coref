I've got two weeks left on a long business trip (Oct 24th to Nov 25th).
My iPod was complaining that the battery was empty, even though I had it
on the charger for the last few days.  So I plugged it into my laptop,
to see if it would be happier charging from there.

My laptop has a nearly empty iTunes library.  I used to keep a copy of
my library from my desktop on the laptop, but deleted it all to save
space.  All I have now on the laptop are the freebies I've downloaded
from iTMS while on this trip.

So I plug it in...and it syncs, wiping out all the music on the iPod.
Aaaaarrrrgggggg!

Come on, Apple.  If an iPod sync is going to delete thousands of songs,
how about throwing up a dialog and asking if this is what the user
really wants?  It's been so long since I used that iPod on the laptop
(at least 2.5 years) that I totally forgot that I had ever set it up to
sync.

That happened to me on the first day of an extended trip.  I had spent
a lot of time carefully filling up my 60GB iPod, which I sync from my
home Mac Pro.  My laptop has nothing in it except for a few podcasts.
It deleted everything in a second or so.

I see iTunes 7.5 has an option &quot;Disable automatic syncing for all
iPhones and iPods&quot; (&quot;Syncing&quot; Tab), which I am going to test before my
next long trip next month.

Interesting admission, Clyde: your laptop came with iTunes
pre-installed, did it? What make and model do you have?

Open iTunes&gt;preferences&gt;syncing tab. Disable automatic syncing for iPods
and iPhones.

Every time I connect an iPod to a computer besides the one that it was
originally set to sync with, the first thing that iTunes does is bring up a
dialog box giving you the option to reverse sync purchased music (move
purchased songs from the iPod to the computer), sync the iPod (clearly
stating that this will erase existing music on the iPod) or Cancel.  If you
cancel you have the option to set the iPod/iTunes  to manual mode where you
can drag and dop music to the ipod/create playlist etc.  This works the same
on Mac and Windows.

Ladies and Gentlemen! Welcome to the latest Alan Baker Contrived
Controversey! In this one I have supposedly been concealing the fact
that my laptop came with iTunes pre-installed.
As Oxford can tell you, since its something he's deemed important
enough to commit to memory, my laptop is an HP. Its a Pavillion zv6000
CTO. It turned three years old towards the end of October.
And, yes, it came with iTunes pre-installed. This is hardly a surprise
since HP was selling iPods at the time I bought the laptop. Maybe they
still are. Its not something I paid much attention to.
I have helped friends set up new HP desktops that had MusicMatch
instead of iTunes in the last few months so maybe HP and Apple's deal
is over.
I had downloaded iTunes when it first came out for Windows. Not only
was it a huge memory hog, it was intrusive as well.  I had a few mp3s
already on my HD. The first thing iTunes did was to convert them to
its prefferred format move them to iTunes prefferred directory and
delete the originals. It did all of this without asking. Some friends
of mine told me that those files were also now subject to iTunes DRM
scheme. I said 'To Hell with that'; deleted iTunes re-ripped my CDs
and vowed to never let that POS darken my HD again.

If you're talking about msconfig not even that will do it. You need to

You've said so many ignorant and wrong things above its almost Edwinian...

1.  I have iTunes 7.4.3.1 running right now on a 6 year old Toshiba
Satellite with only 256MB of RAM running Windows XP... It's using 37,392K
of RAM
2. iTunes does not &quot;convert&quot; music from MP3's into it's &quot;preferred format&quot;
when you install it on Windows. MP3's do and always have worked on iPods
since the day they came out. iTunes does not convert MP3's to run on the
iPod.  The iPod is seen on any OS as a regular USB Mass Storage Device.  If
you choose to &quot;View Hidden Files&quot; in Windows and look in the iPod you will
find regular old mp3 files that are renamed but otherwise unmodified.  The
only time iTunes converts music is when you import WMA files.  Even then, it
leaves the original unmodified.
3.  iTunes never deletes the original files nor does it move files
automatically.  By default, iTunes does not move files.  iTunes points to
the original location of the files on your hard drive.  If you click on the
Advanced tab in Preference you can choose to &quot;Keep iTunes Music Organized&quot;.
This option is off by default, but if you turn it on AND choose to
&quot;Consolidate Library&quot;, iTunes will make a copy of the music and put the copy
into it's own directory structure.  However it will still not delete the
original file.
4. iTunes does not add DRM to non-DRM'd files nor does the iPod.  Files are
merely copied to the iPod renamed but otherwised unmodified.
5.  By default, iTunes does rip audio to AAC.  AAC is not a proprietary
Apple format.  In fact, Apple had *nothing* to do with the creation of AAC.
AAC is specified by the same organization that specifies MP3 and is
considered the successor to  MP3.  Every major DAP maker has players that
support AAC --- including MS's Zune.

Yes I am running iTunes right this second on Windows XP and can verify
everything previously stated.

Don't blame your ignorance on Apple.

&gt; Every time I connect an iPod to a computer besides the one that it was
&gt; originally set to sync with, the first thing that iTunes does is bring up a
&gt; dialog box giving you the option to reverse sync purchased music (move
&gt; purchased songs from the iPod to the computer), sync the iPod (clearly
&gt; stating that this will erase existing music on the iPod) or Cancel.  If you
&gt; cancel you have the option to set the iPod/iTunes  to manual mode where you
&gt; can drag and dop music to the ipod/create playlist etc.  This works the same
&gt; on Mac and Windows.

It didn't work that way in September on my MacBook Pro.  I connected
it and ZAP, it sync'd and deleted everything.

What was the point of your post?  Did you think we were both idiots
and did not bother to read warning dialog boxes?

About a year ago my iPod was occasionally connected to this laptop, so
they have a history together, and in the old days I manually sync'd
music content.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's a reason that piece of trash was the first thing deleted from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my laptop.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Interesting admission, Clyde: your laptop came with iTunes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pre-installed, did it? What make and model do you have?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ladies and Gentlemen! Welcome to the latest Alan Baker Contrived
&gt;&gt;&gt; Controversey! In this one I have supposedly been concealing the fact
&gt;&gt;&gt; that my laptop came with iTunes pre-installed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; As Oxford can tell you, since its something he's deemed important
&gt;&gt;&gt; enough to commit to memory, my laptop is an HP. Its a Pavillion zv6000
&gt;&gt;&gt; CTO. It turned three years old towards the end of October.
&gt;&gt;&gt; And, yes, it came with iTunes pre-installed. This is hardly a surprise
&gt;&gt;&gt; since HP was selling iPods at the time I bought the laptop. Maybe they
&gt;&gt;&gt; still are. Its not something I paid much attention to.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have helped friends set up new HP desktops that had MusicMatch
&gt;&gt;&gt; instead of iTunes in the last few months so maybe HP and Apple's deal
&gt;&gt;&gt; is over.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I had downloaded iTunes when it first came out for Windows. Not only
&gt;&gt;&gt; was it a huge memory hog, it was intrusive as well.  I had a few mp3s
&gt;&gt;&gt; already on my HD. The first thing iTunes did was to convert them to
&gt;&gt;&gt; its prefferred format move them to iTunes prefferred directory and
&gt;&gt;&gt; delete the originals. It did all of this without asking. Some friends

&gt;&gt;&gt; scheme. I said 'To Hell with that'; deleted iTunes re-ripped my CDs
&gt;&gt;&gt; and vowed to never let that POS darken my HD again.

&gt;&gt;Yeah - and iTunes comes with that HUGE POS QuickTime.  It tried to intrude
&gt;&gt;on everything, and I couldn't find a way in the program to &quot;discourage&quot;
&gt;&gt;it.
&gt;&gt;Thank God XP has a default provision for kicking the shit out of any apple
&gt;&gt;program.

&gt; If you're talking about msconfig not even that will do it. You need to
&gt; rename qttask.exe. Then Quicktime will quit bothering you and only run
&gt; when its needed.
">

Thanks for the info.  I went into; set Program Access and Defaults.  That
seems to have done it.

I don't know whether you're an idiot or not...I do know that I usually sync
my iPod with my Mac Mini.  I connected my iPod to my Windows laptop so I
could reformat it as Fat32 for the versality -- I can use it on both Windows
and Macs. I reconnected my now blank iPod on the Mac Mini and it asked me do
I want to sync and erase all of the content on the iPod. I said Yes, it
errored for lack of space (as expected).  I chose the playlists to sync and
synced it.  I then took my iPod to work, connected it to a Windows PC.  It
asked me did I want to sync losing all information or transfer purchases.  I
transferred purchases, and set the iPod to Manual.  I went home, connected
the iPod to my Windows laptop -- it gave me the same options.  I set my ipod
to manually sync on my laptop.  Transferred a few songs (mp3s and purchased
music) to the iPod.  Then reconnected the iPod to the Mac Mini -- which was
set to automatically sync -- it still gave me the choice to sync, cancel, or
transfer purchased music.  Maybe it's a newer version of iTunes, but it did
recognize that I had put music on the iPod from another computer and it did
not automatically sync and erase the music without confirmation.

I believe the laptop was the computer it was originally set up to sync

In all fairness -- that option was available for iPhones but not iPods in

now there is a sync tab with that option.

service. Then compare it to the 5K or so that Winamp takes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;2. iTunes does not &quot;convert&quot; music from MP3's into it's &quot;preferred format&quot;

The version I installed did. That they ended that practice doesn't
mean that version 1 didn't do it. I know it did. It did it to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;MP3's do and always have worked on iPods
&gt;since the day they came out.

No one said they didn't Mr. Strawman Builder. However I did run into
something intereting. We were ripping some CDs on my computer for my
brother's iPod. It refused to play them until we had them down to
192K. It refused to play anything encoded at a higher rate. I can only
think that this had something t do with the fact that we were using
AudioGrabber and LAME instead of iTunes to do the ripping.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; iTunes does not convert MP3's to run on the

I don't know why it converted them, nor do I care. The fact that it
did and did it without even asking was enough to put me off.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've got two weeks left on a long business trip (Oct 24th to Nov 25th).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My iPod was complaining that the battery was empty, even though I had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the charger for the last few days.  So I plugged it into my laptop,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to see if it would be happier charging from there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My laptop has a nearly empty iTunes library.  I used to keep a copy of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my library from my desktop on the laptop, but deleted it all to save
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; space.  All I have now on the laptop are the freebies I've downloaded
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from iTMS while on this trip.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I plug it in...and it syncs, wiping out all the music on the iPod.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Aaaaarrrrgggggg!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Come on, Apple.  If an iPod sync is going to delete thousands of songs,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how about throwing up a dialog and asking if this is what the user
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really wants?  It's been so long since I used that iPod on the laptop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (at least 2.5 years) that I totally forgot that I had ever set it up to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sync.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That happened to me on the first day of an extended trip.  I had spent a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of time carefully filling up my 60GB iPod, which I sync from my home
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mac Pro.  My laptop has nothing in it except for a few podcasts. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deleted everything in a second or so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I see iTunes 7.5 has an option &quot;Disable automatic syncing for all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iPhones and iPods&quot; (&quot;Syncing&quot; Tab), which I am going to test before my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; next long trip next month.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Steve
&gt;&gt;&gt; Every time I connect an iPod to a computer besides the one that it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; originally set to sync with, the first thing that iTunes does is bring up
&gt;&gt;&gt; a dialog box giving you the option to reverse sync purchased music (move
&gt;&gt;&gt; purchased songs from the iPod to the computer), sync the iPod (clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt; stating that this will erase existing music on the iPod) or Cancel.  If
&gt;&gt;&gt; you cancel you have the option to set the iPod/iTunes  to manual mode
&gt;&gt;&gt; where you can drag and dop music to the ipod/create playlist etc.  This
&gt;&gt;&gt; works the same on Mac and Windows.
&gt;&gt; It didn't work that way in September on my MacBook Pro.  I connected it
&gt;&gt; and ZAP, it sync'd and deleted everything.

&gt;&gt; What was the point of your post?  Did you think we were both idiots and
&gt;&gt; did not bother to read warning dialog boxes?

&gt;&gt; About a year ago my iPod was occasionally connected to this laptop, so
&gt;&gt; they have a history together, and in the old days I manually sync'd music
&gt;&gt; content.

&gt;&gt; Steve

&gt; I don't know whether you're an idiot or not...I do know that I usually sync
&gt; my iPod with my Mac Mini.  I connected my iPod to my Windows laptop so I
&gt; could reformat it as Fat32 for the versality -- I can use it on both Windows
&gt; and Macs. I reconnected my now blank iPod on the Mac Mini and it asked me do
&gt; I want to sync and erase all of the content on the iPod. I said Yes, it
&gt; errored for lack of space (as expected).  I chose the playlists to sync and
&gt; synced it.  I then took my iPod to work, connected it to a Windows PC.  It
&gt; asked me did I want to sync losing all information or transfer purchases.  I
&gt; transferred purchases, and set the iPod to Manual.  I went home, connected
&gt; the iPod to my Windows laptop -- it gave me the same options.  I set my ipod
&gt; to manually sync on my laptop.  Transferred a few songs (mp3s and purchased
&gt; music) to the iPod.  Then reconnected the iPod to the Mac Mini -- which was
&gt; set to automatically sync -- it still gave me the choice to sync, cancel, or
&gt; transfer purchased music.  Maybe it's a newer version of iTunes, but it did
&gt; recognize that I had put music on the iPod from another computer and it did
&gt; not automatically sync and erase the music without confirmation.
">

I just connected by 5G iPod (60GB) to my MacBook Pro.  The first time
since September when it erased everything.  I am running Leopard now
and the latest iTunes (7.5) on this system, and on the Mac Pro where I
do sync from.

It asked me about the purchased music and offered to copy them to my
PC. (It did that in September too).  I said &quot;Don't Transfer&quot; and now
it is syncing.  It did not ask me any further questions, it did not
present any more dialog boxes.

For this test I went in and UNCHECKED the box to disable automatic
syncing.

I am watching the syncing.  It appears to have deleted all my music
(with no warning) and is now syncing the little music I happen to have
on this laptop (mostly new music I rip to this laptop &amp; copy over
later and add to my main iTunes library.

I'll resync it completely from the Mac Pro and then enable the
&quot;disable all syncing&quot; feature on the laptop and try again later.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1.  I have iTunes 7.4.3.1 running right now on a 6 year old Toshiba
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Satellite with only 256MB of RAM running Windows XP... It's using
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;37,392K
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of RAM

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now add in the amount used by the iTunes helper service and the iPod
&gt;&gt;&gt; service. Then compare it to the 5K or so that Winamp takes.

&gt;&gt;I just installed Winamp 5.5
&gt;&gt;Right this second looking at the Task Manager  winamp.exe takes 9,424K.
&gt;&gt;When playing a video it takes up 14,916K -- a lot more than 5K

&gt; Still nowhere near the footprint of iTunes.

So you were off by a factor of 1884.8.....

&gt;&gt;&gt; No one said they didn't Mr. Strawman Builder. However I did run into
&gt;&gt;&gt; something intereting. We were ripping some CDs on my computer for my
&gt;&gt;&gt; brother's iPod. It refused to play them until we had them down to
&gt;&gt;&gt; 192K. It refused to play anything encoded at a higher rate. I can only
&gt;&gt;&gt; think that this had something t do with the fact that we were using
&gt;&gt;&gt; AudioGrabber and LAME instead of iTunes to do the ripping.

&gt;&gt;I don't know what the maximum bit rate MP3 that an iPod can use.  But even
&gt;&gt;iTunes can encode up to 320kbps so I'm sure that the iPod can support it.
&gt;&gt;The only iPod that has limited playback ability is the shuffle.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iTunes does not convert MP3's to run on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;iPod.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know why it converted them, nor do I care. The fact that it

&gt; AAC.

You've been so hazy all of this time...I suspect he imported WMA's into
iTunes.  There is no reason that iTunes would ever automatically convert

Maybe since you had the problem -- you didn't know what you were doing.  You

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This option is off by default, but if you turn it on AND choose to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Consolidate Library&quot;, iTunes will make a copy of the music and put the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;into it's own directory structure.  However it will still not delete the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;original file.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;4. iTunes does not add DRM to non-DRM'd files nor does the iPod.  Files
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are

WinAmp -- the player you discussed takes up 10MB.  iTunes needs about 20MB.
You're saying that 10MB makes that much of a difference?  On system with 1GB
of RAM you're talking less than 1% difference in available RAM caused by
iTunes.  But if you're using those apps why would you have less than 2-4GB
of RAM anyway?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I've got two weeks left on a long business trip (Oct 24th to Nov 25th).
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; My iPod was complaining that the battery was empty, even though I had it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; on the charger for the last few days.  So I plugged it into my laptop,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to see if it would be happier charging from there.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; My laptop has a nearly empty iTunes library.  I used to keep a copy of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; my library from my desktop on the laptop, but deleted it all to save
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; space.  All I have now on the laptop are the freebies I've downloaded
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; from iTMS while on this trip.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So I plug it in...and it syncs, wiping out all the music on the iPod.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Aaaaarrrrgggggg!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Come on, Apple.  If an iPod sync is going to delete thousands of songs,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; how about throwing up a dialog and asking if this is what the user
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; really wants?  It's been so long since I used that iPod on the laptop
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (at least 2.5 years) that I totally forgot that I had ever set it up to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sync.
&gt; &gt;&gt; That happened to me on the first day of an extended trip.  I had spent a
&gt; &gt;&gt; lot of time carefully filling up my 60GB iPod, which I sync from my home
&gt; &gt;&gt; Mac Pro.  My laptop has nothing in it except for a few podcasts. It
&gt; &gt;&gt; deleted everything in a second or so.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I see iTunes 7.5 has an option &quot;Disable automatic syncing for all iPhones
&gt; &gt;&gt; and iPods&quot; (&quot;Syncing&quot; Tab), which I am going to test before my next long
&gt; &gt;&gt; trip next month.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Steve

&gt; &gt; Every time I connect an iPod to a computer besides the one that it was
&gt; &gt; originally set to sync with, the first thing that iTunes does is bring up a
&gt; &gt; dialog box giving you the option to reverse sync purchased music (move
&gt; &gt; purchased songs from the iPod to the computer), sync the iPod (clearly
&gt; &gt; stating that this will erase existing music on the iPod) or Cancel.  If you
&gt; &gt; cancel you have the option to set the iPod/iTunes  to manual mode where you
&gt; &gt; can drag and dop music to the ipod/create playlist etc.  This works the same
&gt; &gt; on Mac and Windows.

&gt; It didn't work that way in September on my MacBook Pro.  I connected
&gt; it and ZAP, it sync'd and deleted everything.

&gt; What was the point of your post?  Did you think we were both idiots
&gt; and did not bother to read warning dialog boxes?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You've said so many ignorant and wrong things above its almost Edwinian...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.  I have iTunes 7.4.3.1 running right now on a 6 year old Toshiba
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Satellite with only 256MB of RAM running Windows XP... It's using 37,392K
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of RAM
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now add in the amount used by the iTunes helper service and the iPod
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; service. Then compare it to the 5K or so that Winamp takes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I just installed Winamp 5.5
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right this second looking at the Task Manager  winamp.exe takes 9,424K.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When playing a video it takes up 14,916K -- a lot more than 5K

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iTunes 19084K
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AppleMobileDeviceHelper.exe  -- 5896K
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iTunesHelper.exe -- 1596K
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iPodService.exe -- 1192K
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AppleMobileDeviceService 200K

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can disable AppleMobileDeviceHelper/AppleMobileDeviceService if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't have an iPhone.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These memory differences are meaningless in the context of the amount
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of RAM in today's systems.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Steve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That depends upon wht else is running now doesn't it? It may not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; matter much if all you're doing is listening to music and reading
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; email, but if you fire up Cinema 4D, World Builder and Photoshop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suddenly its a bit more important.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I stand by my statement.

&gt;&gt; So you don't think its important to have as much RAM cleared for RAM
&gt;&gt; hungry apps?

&gt;&gt;&gt; And we're not even considering how much of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that RAM is flagged as being swapable to virtual memory.

&gt;&gt; Because that's what we all want - a huge performance hit.

&gt;Since it didn't come through the first 2 times, I'll say it again - I
&gt;stand by my statement, which should have been very clear.  No further
&gt;clarifications are needed.

&gt;Steve

Yeah, I wouldn't want to defend that absurd of a statement either.

They never said that WinAmp used only 5K of memory when in actuality it uses
almost 1500K.  Nor did they say that iTunes wraps users MP3's in DRM.  They
also never said that iTunes converted their MP3's into some special iPod
specific format when all you have to do is &quot;view hidden files&quot; and double
click on the iPod in Explorer and see renamed but unmodified MP3's.

Statistically speaking, neither one of you has provided any
evidence to support whether the majority of iPod users are
Windows or MacOS users. I suspect, though, that Apple has a
better grasp of what the figures are. You also have to account
for the fact that there may be, and in fact probably is, a
many iPod to one computer relationship for some segment of
the iPod using population. That has certainly been the case
in my house....over time I have owned several iPods. That said
I know a few iPod/Windows users, but I know a lot more iPod/
Mac users...this however is anecdotal evidence and not very
useful for statistical purposes.
