The Lamest Show On Earth!

By Ed Naha
Created Mar 5 2007 - 9:40am

What's wrong with this picture? Last week, a weather system extending over
1,000 miles, spawned blizzards at its northernmost point and deadly
tornadoes at its southernmost. It was truly a mind-bending event. I turned
on cable and there was Chris Matthews chatting with John McCain. 20 people
dead from the still-churning twisters alone and I'm watching McCain gas-bag
like it matters?

Yes, folks, with the presidential elections only a scant twenty friggin'
months away, the Beltway Bozos have arrived full-tilt! As the war in Iraq
rages, Wall Street breaks into The Saint Vitus dance and Mother Nature goes
berserk, we are asked to ponder, uh, not much.

Is Obama black enough? Is Hillary too hated? Is Kucinich too short? Is
McCain too old? Is Romney a big enough asshole? Another twenty months of
this stuff and Americans will be ready to vote for a sack of rocks for
President. (Hmmmm. You know? That might not be too bad of an idea.)

Like it or not, we're going to be inundated with pundits spouting theories
about non-theories and politicians spewing rhetoric about nothing like
they're getting paid by the word.

So, here's what I suggest to make this more audience friendly. Let all the
cable networks pool their resources and have this crap on twenty-four/seven
(they can take turns). To make it interesting, however, they have to stage
everything on a deserted island that's been transformed into a massive
circus/carnival! We don't need no stinking three rings! We'll just keep
adding rings ad infinitum. Oh, yeah, and all the participants will have to
wear funny outfits.

Imagine the hilarity! The Congressional Cage Match will feature Democrats
dressed as widdle kids shaking their heads while making "tsk-tsk" sounds and
"shame-shame" gestures. Republicans, dressed as Howler monkeys, will crap in
their hands and fling it!

In a funny variation of the old "Fireman, Save My Child" clown routine, a
burning building called "Iraq" will be battled by Republican bozos led by
Mitch McConnell and John Boehner. The punchline? The hose these firemen use
to battle the flames is alternately filled with taxpayer's dollars and hot
air!

One crowd-pleaser is bound to be Dick Cheney's "Mr. Bizarro Mysteriouso"
routine where, dressed like Batman's "The Penguin," he inverts the truth
with a flip of his lip! "We're winning in Iraq! There's a Saddam-al Qaeda
connection! There are WMDs still buried in Iraq! Democrats enable
terrorists!"

For an encore, he dons a black hood, denies he's Bizarro Mysteriouso and
gives snarky interviews as "Mr. Senior Administration Official!"

Alberto Gonzales' "Whack-A-Fed" game is a real hoot, as well, wherein the
player (usually a member of the Department of Justice), tries to whomp pesky
Federal prosecutors who do too good a job at exposing corruption. If you get
a score of at least eight, you get to watch subpoenas delivered and the
persecuted prosecutors sing like canaries in front of Congressional
committees!

John McCain shows he's a major player while juggling one hundred flip-flops
and cracking wise as only a 70-year-old fellow can. His song "What's so bad
about sucking up to everybody?" stops the show, or at least slows it down
quite a bit.

Droopy Dog Lieberman puts on his sad Emmet Kelly clown make-up and roams the
outskirts of the circus, bemoaning the lonely life of a major Bozo and
threatening to quit the circus if people don't start paying attention to
him. Nobody does. He leaves the Big Top and becomes a professional mourner
at Italian funerals.

Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama elicit howls of laughter with their classic
Punch and Judy show, each hurling insults at each other via the use of
spotlighted puppets!

Mitt Romney does a series of conservative impressions via his "Man of A
Thousand Faces" skit, named after the silent actor Lon Chaney Sr. who could
transform himself into any monster imaginable via makeup and practice. It
helped that Chaney was double-jointed and didn't have a board up his ass,
though.

A hilarious "Bob for Adam's Apples" game booth ends with a tie between Ann
Coulter and Dame Edna Everage!

Governor Bill Richardson, the Democrat with the most foreign relations
experience, is almost ignored in his "Invisible Man" piece of performance
art while Joe Biden roams the crowd with his picture on the side of a milk
carton under the logo: "Have You Seen Me?"

Newt Gingrich attempts to be shot out of a cannon but the fuse fizzles.

Rudy Giuliani appears in a hysterical bit wherein he tries to make his
political career fit into his current conservative clothes! All this while
trying to elude his ex-wives!

Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld attempts to do his classic
"double-talk" sketch but, midway, he's beaten to the ground by terrorists
who decided to fight him over here because he did such a lousy job of
fighting them over there.

Condi Rice, dressed in a fetching leotard, recreates her best "Deer In A
Headlight" speeches from the past six years. Several members of Cirque du
Soleil, in the audience, commit suicide as a result.

John Edwards and Chris Dodd add their own spin to a classic Abbott and
Costello routine, "Who's On Last?" The punchline comes when Tom Vilsack
appears and confesses that it's him! This is followed by fellow Dems
Kucinich and Mike Gravel re-tooling Roy Orbison's classic "Only the Lonely."
There isn't a dry eye in the house. Both candidates are given lovely
consolation prizes: an Amana fridge and an autographed photo of Howard Dean.

Republican hopefuls Duncan Hunter and Mike Huckabee show up for a "Beat the
Press" skit but the press doesn't. So, instead, they play a spirited game of
"Animal Rummy." Concession sales, outside, go wild. Huckabee eventually
joins the fray and consumes an entire steer.

"The Dunk Senator James Inhofe" attraction turns out to be a dud, wherein
Inhofe gamely sits on a chair above several ice flows ready to be immersed
by the first lucky ball to hit the bull's-eye below the chair.
Unfortunately, before the first ball has a chance to be thrown, the ice has
melted and Inhofe is in above his head. The first would-be thrower, Al Gore,
shrugs and walks off saying "I told ya you should have seen the movie."

Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann draws howls by recreating her recent
interview when she declared that there are already plans by evil people to
divvy up Iraq if America leaves.

"Iran is the trouble maker, trying to tip over apple carts all over Baghdad
right now because they want America to pull out. And do you know why? It's
because they've already decided that they're going to partition Iraq.

"And half of Iraq, the western, northern portion of Iraq, is going to be
called.... the Iraq State of Islam, something like that. And I'm sorry, I
don't have the official name, but it's meant to be the training ground for
the terrorists. There's already an agreement made.

"They are going to get half of Iraq and that is going to be a terrorist safe
haven zone where they can go ahead and bring about more terrorist attacks in
the Middle East region and then to come against the United States because we
are their avowed enemy."

At the end of the speech, John Murtha appears and hits her in the kisser
with a custard pie, yelling "Moron!"

Republican hopeful Sam Brownback brings down the house, not to mention IQs,
with his stirring ballad "What's so wrong about the 1880s?" He's backed by
Our Lady of Fetus' choir, led by choirmaster Rick Santorum and his dog
"Heinie."

Tony Snow nearly steals the show during his "Press Conference Follies of
2006-2007" by answering every question thrown his way with a zippy "I don't
know" and "I like pudding."

"The Pen of the Pundits" sideshow tent also proves to be a real treat when
RNC members encourage circus goers to toss down hunks of raw meat to craving
carnivore commentators who scramble over each other to get the newest
tidbit. The audience cracks up as the pundits discover, much to their
chagrin, that the raw meat treats are actually well-disguised balloons,
which blow up in their faces when they bite into them, leaving them with
nothing.

Of course what circus would be complete without its headliner? It's very own
Big Top Pee-Wee? In our case, it's Embattled Brigadier Bush, our very own
president. After successfully making over 3,000 flag-draped coffins
disappear, he astonishes the audience by taking on the English language and
beating it senseless.

"Aardvark! Noodles! Fluidity!" he tells an impressed MSM.

The grand-finale, however, is his Imperial Powers Loop-the-loop, wherein,
perched on his mountain bike, he attempts to pedal circles around a
crumbling world on rusty ramps. Bush doesn't make it through his first
flaming hoop and he takes a header and lands in a bag of bloodthirsty
pretzels. Eventually, he frees himself and blames the audience for not
believing in him, like they did other savvy historical figures, like
Tinkerbelle.

When the audience howls derisively, covert clown cops appear in the crowd
and take all in attendance to an undisclosed location. Bush smirks and
starts screaming about somebody stealing his strawberries and the big top is
taken down.

And thus ends a very entertaining show.

Now, I don't know how you feel about circuses, but a Reuters' headline
caught my eye a week or so, ago: "Two clowns shot dead at circus."

It seems that an unidentified gunman whacked two bozos during their
performance at a traveling circus in Columbia. Police chief Jose Humberto
Henao told Reuters: "The killings had nothing to do with the show the
victims were performing at the time of the incident. We are investigating
the motive."

Maybe the gunman was just sick of stale antics.

Fortunately, here in the States, we don't have to resort to gunplay to rid
ourselves of contrarian clowns. We have remotes to remove them from our TV
screens. More deadly still, we have ballot boxes to make them disappear
forever.

Begone bozos, or feel our wrath in '08.
