Details here:

On Friday in Barnet John Redwood revealed the interim thinking on the
immediate things a government - and local government - can do to help
ease the tensions and reduce pollution. The 10 point plan beneath
would tackle some of the obvious shortcomings that we currently
experience:

(1) Rephase traffic lights, abolishing all red sequences, giving
priority to main roads, and using traffic sensors for traffic from
side roads otherwise showing red.

(2) Allow turning left on a red light, using the red light as a &quot;Stop&quot;
sign.
(3) Remove dangerous chicanes, lane removals and cycle lanes where
they are sandwiched between heavier traffic lanes.
(4) Place cycle lanes on pavements where there is sufficient room for
pedestrians as well.
(5) Allow taxis, motorcycles, milk floats and electrically powered
vehicles into bus lanes, and remove bus lane restrictions at non peak
times.

(6) Encourage Councils to widen junctions, separating traffic going in
different directions. Encourage large companies to sponsor such works
where it can help their business.

(7) Widen car lanes around large roundabouts, creating two lanes where
possible instead of a very large central area.
(8) Provide safer crossings for pedestrians by footbridge or underpass
where appropriate.
(9) Build elevated carriageways or underpasses at main busy city
junctions to improve flows at peak times and rush hours.

(10) Review speed limits, using modern technology to have the right
speed limit at the right time - e.g. 20mph outside schools only when
children are entering or leaving school, higher speed limits the rest
of the time.

You cite the parts from the motoring section on actions to reduce traffic
hold ups.  The part about cycling you missed out is:

&quot;There is clearly a substantial opportunity, in urban environments, to
encourage people to travel short distances using public transport, as
well as to rediscover the lost habit of walking or cycling (which
would improve public health as well as the environment). As well as its
environmental benefits, increased use of public transport and of non-

which otherwise does so much to diminish the appeal of our major cities to
investors and international businesses.&quot;

Why don't they leave guidance to the Department for Transport.  Whilst the
DfT get some things wrong they are getting better (see their consultation
on Cycling Infrastructure Design).

My impressions of this are that it's an amateur job drawn up after a 5
minute brain storm by a bunch of car-centric amateurs.  It reads like
something from the '60s, or the populist nonsense put out by UKIP or the
BNP.

I honestly cannot fathom why anyone would actually vote for John Redwood.
The man is an obnoxious smug, santimonious turd. Every time I've seen him on

That waffle on cycling is at odds with at least the following parts
of his plan:

&quot;(4) Place cycle lanes on pavements where there is sufficient room

&quot;(6) Encourage Councils to widen junctions, separating traffic going

For any concrete action to result, they would first have to get elected,

problem with most of these idea is that it makes walking around a urban
place more difficult and threating. of the two towns near me richmound
and kingston upon thames. richmound, while both have one way systems.
the richmound one is lot more friendly, walking around the town doesn't
feel like your playing chicken with traffic like kingston can do.

This one sounds good. As we all know, pedestrians take up

IME the congestion at roundabouts is caused by the traffic

not reduce congestion by much.

I like the system they have in some countries for quiet times of
flashing red on sideroads (= give way), flashing amber for main road

They'll probably put up railings to make life difficult and except
ped. to go half mile out of their way to cross road, in general a
seriously bad idea. Might be useful at some big junctions, but
probably won't happen here because it will cost more.

I rather like the system they have (had? - I haven't been there for a
while) in California. Standard suburban speed limit is 25 mph. Round
schools the signs say &quot;25 mph, 10 mph when children are present&quot; (I've
probably got the wording wrong.)

If there were loads of children around this was easy, you went at 10
mph. But I always felt nervous driving past a school on a Saturday
afternoon - what if there was one kid behind a tree somewhere? (They
are very strict about enforcing their rules re children on roads eg
you can't pass a school bus when its lights are flashing.)

Then I realised that the effect of these signs was that near schools I
drove at 25 mph, but looking very closely for any signs of children,
ready to slow down (I try to do this anyway, but there's always scope
for extra attention where you know the risk is higher).

So, a system that ensures you are really concentrating round schools
seems like an excellent idea to me. However, I suspect that's not how
it would work in this country, it would probably be just for +/- 30
minutes of start/end times, which as Martin says would be a bad idea.

Have to agree.  Underpasses are further to walk, have poor visibility =&gt;
feel unsafe at night, and smell of wee.  Even on, say, Marble Arch, for
an able-bodied adult it's a lot easier and more pleasant and convenient
to climb over the barriers and cross the road.

Why not make the cars use the underpasses instead?

I don't think any of this is a surprise. It is something we were
