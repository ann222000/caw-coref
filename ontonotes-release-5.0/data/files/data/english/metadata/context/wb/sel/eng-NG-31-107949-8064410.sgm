My observation is that a large percentage of brush passers tend to be
70+ year old drivers? Are my stats schewed or do other's notice this

I find that a lot of the brush passers have a little fish on the back of

&quot;Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites.  You are like
whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are
full of dead men's bones and every kind of filth.  Even so, on the outside
you appear righteous, but inside you are filled with hypocrisy and
wrongdoing.&quot;  Matthew 23:27-28

My brother and I were riding to church (!) one Sunday when a
little old lady saw us on the road and swerved purposely to push us off
the road.  No, she didn't just brush past, she actively hooked right and
revved her engine, sending us scampering into the shoulder.

We were amazed to see her turn left INTO THE VERY SAME CHURCH parking lot
that we were headed towards ourselves!  As we were locking up our bicycles
and getting ready to hear Mass, she saw us and shouted at me for
needlessly and recklessly endangering a young child.  We were doubly
amazed.  After all, *she* had been the only one recklessly endangering
anyone with her deliberate bullying on the road.  All the other drivers we
encountered that day passed us safely, and didn't treat us like anything
else other than slow-moving traffic.

Maybe, I don't know, seems I've noticed something similar. I always
chalked it up to &quot;law &amp; order&quot; types who were afraid to cross the median
when passing, &amp; so squeeze the cyclist (lots of roads here in New
England are pretty narrow).

One time I managed to catch an old guy who had squeezed me badly and I
unleashed a stream of invective. He was very contrite, and admitted that
he hadn't realized that he came that close. Sometimes people just have
poor spacial perception -- that doesn't seem to get better with age. I'd
be the first one to react to ageism, but sometimes old eyes just aren't
what they should be, and many communities seem to be over tolerant about it.

Younger guys seem to do it deliberately. I know that because often they
are watching in the rear view &amp; catch my flip off -- frequently they
return the salute, sometimes pulling over to scream obscenities --
something I'm usually pleased to exchange.

No disagreement with what you say.  Doesn't mean I believe the OP's story --
esp. the part about the woman standing up and shouting at them in church.

Doesn't pass the &quot;pew&quot; test, IMO.

You don't believe me?

This is actually the second time I've told this story on this NG.  The
first time is archived here:

http://groups.google.com/group/rec.bicycles.soc/msg/61f7dc9d6a3d7bc5?...

I'm not making it up.  I was reminded of her when the Vatican issued those
new pastoral guidelines for road users, especially the bits about
&quot;protecting the most vulnerable road users&quot; and the reminder that cars are
a near occasion of sin.

I don't know why not. The shout was apparently outside the church,
unless they were locking the bikes inside the church which would not
seem likely. Nope, it seems reasonable to me.

I agree that the older folks are more likely to do it.

Why?  I think they drive less, have less experience passing cyclists,
are less confident, and fall back on simplistic thinking:  &quot;I'm not
allowed to cross that line.  Ever!&quot;  I don't think it's deliberate.

Example incident:  Biking to work, at a narrow two-block stretch where
I have to take the lane, I had a Cadillac blare the horn behind me.
Not a short &quot;toot,&quot; but a longer &quot;Hoonk!&quot;  Then the car came up
alongside, so its right front wheel was immediately to my left, maybe
two feet away.

Another &quot;Hoonk!&quot; and I was thinking &quot;How am I going to escape this
nut?&quot;  Then a little old lady leaned out the passenger window and
asked &quot;Excuse me, can you tell us how to get to the Sunshine Holiness
Church?&quot;  They were just trying to get my attention!  They apologized
profusely when I said &quot;You're scaring the hell out of me!&quot;

I'll also agree with this.

This past weekend, I was vacationing in Door County, WI, and was riding back
from Sturgeon Bay to our cabin in Little Harbor. County Highway B [1] is
the best route, and is plenty wide, with a nice shoulder, but as we're riding
along, I hear a honk from an approaching Cadillac. As it overtakes, it
doesn't move an inch over the center line.

The driver was well into their 70s. I can only assume they meant the honk to
alert us to their impending pass, not as a &quot;get the f*** out of my way&quot;
honk, as their eyes were fixed straight ahead as they passed, rather than
glowering at us.

I've gotten this on a few other occasions as well, and I think they really
think they're doing us a favor by honking.

[1] Helpfully suggested by Ron W. over on rec.bicycles.rides, and defintely
as good a ride as advertised.

:-)  Of course, I always hate demonstrating that Bill makes mistakes.
But I had a similar incident biking to church.

Two blocks from the church parking lot, I saw a red convertible
backing out of a driveway on my left, directly toward me - FAST.  I
yelled for the driver to stop, which he did; but as soon as I passed,
he whipped out of his drive, then zoomed up behind me and honked the
horn.

It's one of those roads where I usually shared the lane, even though
the right side of the lane was a bit bumpy at that time.  This time I
didn't.  I took the lane, deliberately looking down at his license
plate, and he had to wait behind me until he got the opportunity to
pass.  He then turned right, into the church parking lot.  I followed.

He parked his car, I locked my bike, and he walked in just ahead of
me, conspicuously avoiding looking at me.

We saw each other again on the way out.  Or at least, I saw him.
Again, he was somehow not looking in my direction.  But his driving
has been courteous the few times our paths crossed since then.

I don't know, I've seen some pretty egregious shit. One type-A
businesswoman harangued our table (Starbucks) full of cyclists (~20)
with how a group HAD ALMOST MADE HER MISS HER FLIGHT (not our group,
mind you). BTW, this &quot;incident&quot; happened on back road 20 miles from the
airport. I think she wanted us all to apologize and promise it would
never happen again.

I've also learned from experience that a whole lot of people consider
riding with kids in traffic to be child abuse (although I can't recall
ever being yelled at about it, it wouldn't have surprised me). There was
the time I got definite dagger eyes from a woman picnicking with her
family as I was duct taping (sticks better to sweaty skin) gauze to the
bleeding hip abrasion my son got after going over the bars on a ski
slope (rear brake on steep slopes, dammit!), that and maybe the fact
that I was pulling a 6 year old on a trailer bike...

Of course it's also not uncommon for people, when caught being jerks, to
try to bluff their way out of it -- best defense is good offense, &amp; all
that.

I can believe it.

You are right, I too noticed the brush passing mostly when travelling
on single lane roads
with the double line. It seems they would rather hit me then break the
law by crossing it.
Just seems illogical how someone with so many years of experience
would behave so blindly?

Dad's car is more likely to crash into a tree, killing the occupants and
possibly the tree. Mom's car is more likely to be an Invulnerobile that so
isolates the driver from the road that they don't even notice when they hit
you. I worry more about Junior than about Mom, but not by much.

Or so it seems to me.

I'd say the SUV, at least, is potentially more dangerous.  For one
thing, if you're hit by a car chances are that you'll land on the
hood or windshield -- certainly not ideal, but much better than the
alternative of being knocked to the ground and possibly run over,
which is a far greater risk if you're hit by a tall SUV.

And while I don't have any research at hand to back this up, my
experience is that SUVs imbue a sense of insulation from the
environment in a way that cars do not.  And I don't think many would
argue against the fact that it simply takes more skill and attention
to navigate a large SUV through city streets than it does a Civic or
other commuter vehicle of sensible proportions.

So yeah, my preference would be for distracted soccer moms and the
like to not be on the road in the first place.  But, failing that,
I'd much rather see such drivers in a small car with high
visibility, than in a ginormous road-hogging SUV.

* Disclaimer: This semi-rant should not be construed to apply in any

&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe, I don't know, seems I've noticed something similar. I always
&gt;&gt;&gt; chalked it up to &quot;law &amp; order&quot; types who were afraid to cross the
&gt;&gt;&gt; median when passing, &amp; so squeeze the cyclist (lots of roads here in
&gt;&gt;&gt; New England are pretty narrow).

&gt;&gt;&gt; One time I managed to catch an old guy who had squeezed me badly and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; unleashed a stream of invective. He was very contrite, and admitted
&gt;&gt;&gt; that he hadn't realized that he came that close. Sometimes people just
&gt;&gt;&gt; have

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd be the first one to react to ageism, but sometimes old eyes just

&gt; BTW, this &quot;incident&quot; happened on back road 20 miles from the airport. I
&gt; think she wanted us all to apologize and promise it would never happen

I've seen videos of people harassing SUV drivers with rude bumper stickers,
confrontations, etc. (basically politically-charged &quot;You're destroying the
world!!!1!1!!!&quot; ranting completely unmotivated by anything other than the
target driving an SUV).  I don't doubt the veracity of the facts of the
story other than the interpretation of the intent to run someone off the
road.  That doesn't pass Occam's razor for me...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've also learned from experience that a whole lot of people consider
&gt; riding with kids in traffic to be child abuse (although I can't recall
&gt; ever being yelled at about it, it wouldn't have surprised me). There was

&gt; bleeding hip abrasion my son got after going over the bars on a ski slope
&gt; (rear brake on steep slopes, dammit!), that and maybe the fact that I was
&gt; pulling a 6 year old on a trailer bike...

&gt; Of course it's also not uncommon for people, when caught being jerks, to

Have to say, observation tells me &quot;yes.&quot;  Poor sight lines in the SUV?  A

&gt;&gt;&gt; me, conspicuously avoiding looking at me.

&gt;&gt; What is this with people not talking to each other on their way into
&gt;&gt; church? It's a great opportunity to build a bridge, laugh it off, get the
&gt;&gt; egg off the face.  Sounds like one of those gigantic churches where
&gt;&gt; people get to be anonymous.

&gt; Could it have something to do with his angry exchange with a fellow
&gt; churchgoer (whom he wasn't aware was a fellow churchgoer)?  I don't
&gt; know... (scratches head)

&gt; I don't know about you, but I've acted a fool in past times and gotten my
&gt; comeuppance when I discovered the stranger I was dismissive of/rude
&gt; to/unaware of was someone whom I had a connection with somehow.  It's a
&gt; good reminder that we should treat all people -- not just friends -- with
&gt; respect...
">

That was my great awakening.  Living outside of a big city carries with it
the anonymity that allowed me to leave the house pissed off and take it out
on someone.  Living in the small town I do now I just can't do that.  I know
the clerk at the grocery store, the postal worker (!), the ... etc.  But
going into a church they both know they're supposed to be &quot;Christ-like&quot; and
(being human) blew it.  Sure I should treat people with respect, but be
honest.  We don't.  Or lie rationalize (rational lies).  Moralism without
the gospel drives one to futility.  With it, it drives me to Christ (and
taking myself less seriously).  Then I can say, &quot;Boy do I feel stupid for
blaring my horn at you.  Sorry.&quot;  It's amazing the things that can do.

IME, it sure seems that way.  It's a bigger vehicle, and I've observed
there's very few drivers capable of safely driving these larger
vehicles on anything that's not an exceptionally wide lane (think 14'
lanes on interstates, for example).  Watch a lawn service truck with

I wonder what malice looks like then.  Her line was perfectly fine until

I've given up trying to analyze it with logic--no logic helps.  Most
motorists, if genuinely scared, tend towards the over-cautious, if
anything.  &quot;MY GOD THAT MAN'S ON A BICYCLE IN THE ROAD!&quot; and they either
(a) freeze, holding up traffic behind us, even if there is plenty of room
to pass safely, or (b) overcompensate, swinging WAY out into the other
lane to pass me.

Probably the best reaction I ever got was from a dude in a pick-up truck
with ladder racks.  He rolled alongside me, rolled down his passenger

Actually, my problem is that people drive their Suburbans as if they
*were* Civics.  That is, they take lines on curves and corners that are
better-suited to a smaller car.  Mainly, this means they enter too fast
and cut their corners.

This is a particular worry when you're sitting in the left turning
lane and one of these genii makes a 90 degree left turn from the cross
street.  A cut corner will clip you.  If you're sensible, you'll line up
maybe a meter and a half short of the line--easy to tell, since the
paint's worn down where these clowns cut their corners--but then
automotive traffic behind you gets grumpy that you haven't moved up all
the way.  You can't win.

Oh, vocabulary word of the day:  in Spanish (at least in Latin America)
the word for those brush bars on SUVs is &quot;mataburros.&quot;  Yup, &quot;donkey

Here (Southern California) I'm sad to say I can't report the same.  Work
trucks of all types do a poorer-than-average job of driving with cyclists in
my experience, and the more beaten-up the vehicle, the worse the average
driver I've observed.  And lawn service trucks definitely skew toward the
beaten-up side of the spectrum.

Overall though, I can't complain much.  Most drivers do a pretty good job
around here with giving space, yielding properly, etc.  You know, I've never
had anyone yell &quot;get off the road&quot; here...  just AZ and IA.  Probably just
dumb luck though, given enough miles, the probability of that typer of
encounter approaches 1.

&gt; I'd say the SUV, at least, is potentially more dangerous.  For one
&gt; thing, if you're hit by a car chances are that you'll land on the
&gt; hood or windshield -- certainly not ideal, but much better than the
&gt; alternative of being knocked to the ground and possibly run over,
&gt; which is a far greater risk if you're hit by a tall SUV.

&gt; And while I don't have any research at hand to back this up, my
&gt; experience is that SUVs imbue a sense of insulation from the
&gt; environment in a way that cars do not.  And I don't think many would
&gt; argue against the fact that it simply takes more skill and attention
&gt; to navigate a large SUV through city streets than it does a Civic or
&gt; other commuter vehicle of sensible proportions.

&gt; So yeah, my preference would be for distracted soccer moms and the
&gt; like to not be on the road in the first place.  But, failing that,
&gt; I'd much rather see such drivers in a small car with high
&gt; visibility, than in a ginormous road-hogging SUV.

&gt; * Disclaimer: This semi-rant should not be construed to apply in any
&gt; way, shape, or form to those who own and drive SUVs and other types
&gt; of trucks because they have an actual use for such vehicles.
">

I agree from personal experience.  I drive a car but when my wife and I (and
our baby) fly I always rent us a mid-size SUV so we can handle the extra
bags and passengers we invariably end up with during our travels.  There's
no question that for me there is a greater sense of distancing and unreality
in an SUV -- I think because of the higher profile, the larger interior
space, and the bigger footprint.  It's something more like a living room on
wheels than a car is.

&gt; &gt; poor spacial perception -- that doesn't seem to get better with age.
&gt; &gt; I'd be the first one to react to ageism, but sometimes old eyes just
&gt; &gt; aren't what they should be, and many communities seem to be over
&gt; &gt; tolerant about it.
&gt; &gt; Younger guys seem to do it deliberately. I know that because often
&gt; &gt; they are watching in the rear view &amp; catch my flip off -- frequently they
&gt; &gt; return the salute, sometimes pulling over to scream obscenities --
&gt; &gt; something I'm usually pleased to exchange.

&gt; No disagreement with what you say.  Doesn't mean I believe the OP's story --
&gt; esp. the part about the woman standing up and shouting at them in church.

&gt; Doesn't pass the &quot;pew&quot; test, IMO.

&gt; BS (I think)

Luis was parking his bike IN the church?

&quot;As we were locking up our bicycles
and getting ready to hear Mass, she saw us and shouted at me for
needlessly and recklessly endangering a young child.&quot;

Sounds more like the parking lot to me.

'twas the parking lot.  Being cyclists, we naturally got the choice
parking spaces by the door, which gave her plenty of time to berate us.

This looks really funky on Thunderbird (Mozilla, not Gallo) with the

Teenage girls can be just as bad.

These often look much better wrapped than unwrapped, particularly the
ones with implants. Medium size ones usually have a better shape and do
not sag.
