I make my own pita bread from Chebe packets.  It's so delicious &amp;
easy!  Make according to directions; to make extra fluffy, add in 1
teaspoon of baking powder.  To flavor w/ garlic powder, parsley,
oregano, etc, put in eggs/oil before adding in Chebe mix.  I don't put
any cheese in it.  Working the dough w/ your hands, shape in form of a
pita - as small or large as you'd like.  I usually get 4 large or 8
smaller out of 1 Chebe envelope.  The biggest trick is to lightly coat
the pitas w/ a fine dusting of tapioca flour (Bob's Red Mill) before
baking in oven (for about 15 min at 375F).  That tapioca coating makes
it puff up a bit, and gives that really good, if not better, texture
that pitas have.  Good luck!
