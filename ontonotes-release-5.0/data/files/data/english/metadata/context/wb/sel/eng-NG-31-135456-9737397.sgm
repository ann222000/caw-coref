Out of curiosity, I checked the attendance list for the World Economic
Forum at Davos.

http://www.weforum.org/en/events/AnnualMeeting2008/index.htm

Our beloved friend Carleton Fiorina doesn't appear in the &quot;public
figures&quot; or &quot;business leaders&quot;. She must really miss the limelight,  all
the attention and being seen amongst the rich and famous of the world.
Poor Carly, we should all feel very sorry for her :-) :-) :-)

Mark Hurd is not listed.
But Mikey Dell and the chairman of Lenovo are listed.
Intel and AMD are also represented by their respective chairman.

IBM not listed. (but the list is not complete mind you).

Google (Page and Brin), Yahoo and Akamai are present.

I wonder if Hurd is really opposed to attending, or whether Carly left
such a bitter taste because she attended purely for the glamour that HP
doesn't really want its CEO to attend.

BW's Businessperson of the Year - HP's Mark Hurd

&quot;Mark Hurd, chief executive officer of the world's largest technology company,
doesn't chase the public limelight. He doesn't go to high-profile international
business conferences like the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland. He doesn't flaunt a personal flair or high-flying style. All of
Hurd's energy, it seems, is trained completely on one and only one task:
leading Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).&quot;

While Carly had no management value and was all glamour, you need to
take a serious look at the business guest list for Davos. A lot of
serious CEOs there. Just because one goes to Davos doesn't mean that one
intends to be extremely public, visible and dancing on tables.

There is a lot of business and informal meetings being conducted. And it
is also a high profile event where you can accept some serious business
interviews with serious media.

These allow a CEO to show to the world that he is a real leader. And
when done properly, does a lot of good to the corporation's image.

While Hurd doesn't *need* to be there, it is not necessarily a bad thing
to be there and there can be a lot of value.

And NOT being there gives the impression that he wasn't invited and thus
not seen as a world business leader. And that isn't so good for HP.

Just because La Carly exagerated her importance in the world doesn't
mean that going to Davos and behaving like a mature leader doesn't have
value.

Come on now .. for whatever reason, you are pushing your own agenda here.

The fact is that approx 99% of the worlds CEO's are not at Davos because
they realize that it is primarily photo op's, rubbing shoulders with big
names and/or trying to leverage some time to promote their company.

Mark Hurd was just named BW &quot;Businessman of the Year&quot; and a large part of
that was due to his not trying to be a media star and simply focussing
on the $104B technology company business he is in charge of.

Only the more important world CEOs are invited. And they are invited
because of their leadership skills and ability to influence the &quot;world&quot;.

It isn't so much Hurd selling ink at Davos, but rather Hurd discussing
world affairs and how to help the developing world, manage the USA's
fiscal problems etc.

When you have a smart CEO, sending him to Davos benefits the corporation
in many ways  because it shows the coprporation has a good social
conscience (because of the subjectes being debated at Davos) as well as
showing that the corporation's CEO is more than just a glorified accountant.

And yeah, it also does allow Hurd to mingle with his peers and maybe
discuss business.

Now, consider retail sales (which HP is focused on now (ink and personal
pc). Mikey Dell was at Davos and discussed many social issues. HP wasn't
represented. So, when an educated person wants to buy a PC, the fact
that Dell was seen delving in &quot;help the world&quot; topics  while HP wasn't
is an asset to Dell, a liability for HP.

Carly went to Davos to be seen mingling with the rich and famous. But
there are many CEOs who go to Davos  with a list of things to do.

It all depends on why you go at Davos. And with the image Hurd built for
himself, I feel that if he were to go to Davos, it would be to do
serious stuff and both him and HP would benefit from it.

If Hurd is a recluse and cannot be seen in public places (liek Howard
Hughes), then that is a totally different issue.

I guess it depends on how much of that revenue goes to MS to pay for the
copy of Windows that goes out on every box and what percentage HP actually
gets to keep.  Margin on PC hardware is thiner than a sheet of paper.

revenu != profit.

HP acts as a reseller for Intel and Microsoft. They could sell billions,
and billions but if the revenus go back t Intel and Micorsoft, there
isn't much left for HP shareholders.

But HP makes and sells its onw ink. So the ink is far more profitable,
especially since it is sold at highway robbery prices and costs next to
nothing to produce.

Interesting that HP understands the higher profitablility of pushing ist
own products when it comes to printers. But when it comes to operating
systems, they act is a totally counter intuitive way, selling other
people's product at the expense of its own products.

Share price is dicatted more by what Wall Street Casino analysts say
than what the actual performance is.

For instance, if a company is unlucky enough to declare revenus that are
half a penny below what the analysts had predicted, the share price
thumbles.

And yeah, Wall Street Casino analysts look at HP's performance: its
ranking in the PC business, and the total profit.

In other words: How well HP has done against Dell in selling the same
gear (Intel machines with microsoft software), (sales) and how much ink
HP has sold (profits).

If the CEO of a large corporation is too shy to appear in events such as
DAVOS, people will start wondering if he can be a true leader of a large
corporation.

There is a huge difference between a good administrator to make a
company more efficient, and someone with vision and leadership to steer
the company in the right direction.

HP has benefited from a &quot;administrator only&quot; so far. But how long can HP
continue if its leader is a shy guy without vision and not able to lead
the company to new stuff, or justify taking risks such as rescussitating
VMS ?

If Hurd belives Stallard/Livermore's claims that VMS has no future and
doesn't question them, it doesn't augur well for him as a real leader.

I you take a real look into a post-Carly HP, what has Hurd really done
except fix the mess Carly created ? (I don't wish to devalue that
achievement, but the CEO is expected to be able to do more than that in
the long term).

Hurd has made a lot of staff cuts. When you look at VMS, someone with
vision and ability to take risks would have increased engineering levels
at VMS to bring it back to life. This would have been especially easy
since VMS had already been inflated to handle the port to that IA64
contraption, so it would have been the matter of keeping already hired
staff on for a couple more years to give VMS a chance to catch up.

If Hurd is a &quot;fix it and leave&quot; type of engagement at HP, his lack of
vision will have left VMS in a state that is next to impossible to
recover from. He will have fixed the PC and ink business, but what has
he done with the rest ?

Remember that stock price fluctuates with today's weather. Wall Street
Casino analysts don't look at long term strategies, they only look at
next quarter figures.

It takes a charismatic leader capable of speaking in public to give
those casino analysts confidence that long term decisions or risks taken
by the CEO will pay off. Otherwise, they will chastise him for reckless
spending.

what people ?
I think everybody knows that Davos is just a glamour event.
The &quot;talks&quot; between those &quot;world leaders&quot; are just drivel
and won't help a bit to solve the worlds most urgent problems,
i.e. climate change,
dwindling resources and resulting greed and violence.
It's not even worth to protest against Davos.
Other big companies are absent as well (e.g. IBM AFAIK,
has Gerstner ever been there BTW ?)

Oh come on, don't be ridiculous.
Taking care about an OS with minuscule market share
as qualification for being a &quot;world leader&quot; ?

What rest ? BCS is less than 4% of HP,
and in their view there is nothing be be fixed.

&gt; Share price is dicatted more by what Wall Street Casino analysts say

&gt; For instance, if a company is unlucky enough to declare revenus that are
&gt; half a penny below what the analysts had predicted, the share price

Short term fluctuations are psychology. But long term trends are
all about making money.

How many of the worlds 100 biggest companies has their leader present
at Davos ?

The reality is that VMS revenue is peanuts in the big HP context.

And it seems to me that the idea of VMS starting to grow rapidly
in revenue and profit is more wishful thinking than analysis of the
possibilities.

Do you have a marketing survey backing that or are you just guessing ?

Have you been leading many multi billion companies since you seem
to be such an expert on how a good CEO act ?
