Since most of us are buying and selling things, I was hoping for some
input on a general &quot;How often does it get broken?&quot; question. Obviously,
none of us want anything we buy or sell to arrive broken, but it's going
to happen. So given that we package our fragile items in bubble wrap
and/or foam peanuts and double box them and insure them, and write
FRAGILE all over them, how many arrive damaged anyway? And what should
we do differently next time? I've read the comments about the jewelry
box, which is really sad, and I would like to not see that kind of thing
happen. Any comments on your experiences and what you've learned would
be appreciated. Thanks!

"/> All I can add is that I agree...and so far i have had no damage/ins
claims..but I am sure eventually that one of my parcel's will have a
*bad hair day*..just isnt my turn yet. It seems that the larger the
postal area is (such as NYC) has more damage than smaller area,
from storys I have heard.

"/> I ship a lot of ceramic pieces and (so far) have never had anything broken
in transit. A couple of random thoughts on packing/shipping:

Dont' use recycled packing materials that are damaged. We all like to
reuse cartons and bubble wrap since new stuff is so expensive but cartons
that have been bent don't have much strength and bubble wrap with broken
bubbles doesn't do much to protect. I save old cartons with minor damage
for less fragile items (like books).

Don't skimp on packaging material - I use bubble wrap and recycled
styrofoam peanuts whenever possible. Fill the carton so that you have to
compress the packing material very slightly to seal it - it helps keep
the item from shifting. Make sure the item doesn't touch any of the sides
of the carton. Immobilize all moving parts. Finally, if I'm not
confident that I can kick or throw the package with out damaging the
contents I think about repacking it. I've seen delivery people using
packages to stand on to reach other ones in their truck and very often
have light packages tossed onto my porch.

As a furniture conservator, we see many broken objects from poor shipping
practices. The key is make sure you take full insurance on the object.
