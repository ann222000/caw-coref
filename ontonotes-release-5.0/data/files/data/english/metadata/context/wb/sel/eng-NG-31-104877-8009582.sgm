&lt;&lt;Aubrey II was responsible for building the great keep at Hedingham,
using the Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeuil as his
architect. The keep is faced with *ASHLAR STONE* which had to be
transported all the way from the quarries of Barnack, Northamptonshire.
.
This was a tricky operation and would have involved great expense
to Aubrey, but it ensured the Castle could withstand weather
and considerable bombardment before it would yield as well as
making it far more attractive to the eye. Very few Norman Castles
were faced with *STONE* like Hedingham, only a very few Nobles
were as rich and powerful as the de Veres, and normally
only the doors and windows were faced with cut *STONE* .&gt;&gt;

*HETH*: dread, a descendant of Canaan, and the ancestor of the Hittites
(Gen. 10:18; Deut. 7:1), who dwelt in the vicinity of Hebron

Whereas both Oxford and Shake-speare's sonnet
deliberately echo God Himself, as in Exodus:
.
3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me
unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say
unto them? 3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,
Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,
I AM hath sent me unto you. ................. Feste

Fifteen years ago, appr., I happened to have a conversation with a
friend of mine, who was then professor of theology at the University of
Oslo and had been for about 20 years (but is now recently retired) about
just this question: How does one translate &quot;the name og God&quot; as given in
Exodus correctly, and what does it mean. Martin quoted from the Hebrew
(obviously the original language) and when he pronounced the three
words, it sounded like a breathing in - and a breathing out - and a
breathing in - again. It seemed as if one could just go on saying the
&quot;name&quot; simply by breathing! He said that the language was of an image,
and that the closest he could come to translating it literally was:
I AM in the IMAGE OF THAT I AM.
.
Well, as for a proper understanding of the text, one thing is
certain - which understanding I derive from the sound itself so
closely resembling the process of breathing - : when that
process stops, when you stop breathing, I AM no longer applies.

Or that his hallow'd relics should be hid

.        Hedingham Castle *ESSEX*
http://www.castles-abbeys.co.uk/Hedingham-Castle.html
.
&lt;&lt;Aubrey II was responsible for building the great keep at Hedingham,
using the Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeuil as his
architect. The keep is faced with *ASHLAR STONE* which had to be
transported all the way from the quarries of Barnack,
Northamptonshire.
.
This was a tricky operation and would have involved great expense
to Aubrey, but it ensured the Castle could withstand weather
and considerable bombardment before it would yield as well as
making it far more attractive to the eye. Very few Norman Castles
were faced with *STONE* like Hedingham, only a very few Nobles
were as rich and powerful as the de Veres, and normally
only the doors and windows were faced with cut *STONE* .&gt;&gt;

__      Waite's 'Chariot' TAROT card
__ http://jktarot.com/chariotser.html
.
&lt;&lt;The Charioteer is NOT riding in the Chariot, but is SET
in the cubic *STONE* of the Chariot. *The STONE &amp; 8-pointed*
star on the Charioteer's head refer to the same idea:
.
_  the cube is 2 'cubed' *or 8 : the number of HETH*
.
___  the kabbalistic number of this card but
___ also refers to the Masonic *Perfect ASHLAR*
.
In Speculative Masonry an *ASHLAR* is *freeSTONE* as it comes out
of the quarry. So, a *rough ASHLAR* is a *STONE* in its 'rude &amp;
unpolished' condition that is IGNORANT, uncultivated &amp; vicious man.
But after one is 'smoothed &amp; polished' by education and one learns
to restrain (or 'temper') ones passions, he is represented by the
*Perfect ASHLAR* , the smoothed and squared *STONE*, fitted into
its place in the building (the temple). Or in the Chariot.&gt;&gt;

.            Epicoene - Ben Jonson
.
With such we mingle neither braines, nor brests;
our wishes, like to those make publique feasts,
Are not to please the COOKES tastes, but the guestes.
Yet, if those cunning palates *HETHer* come,
They shall find guests entreaty, and good roome;
And though all relish not, sure, there will be some,
That, when they leaue their seates, shall make them say,
Who *WROT* that piece, could so have *WROTe a play* :
But that, he knew, this was the better way.

made vnto Abraham a sure possession to bury in of the sonnes of
*HETH*.

*HETH*: dread, a descendant of Canaan, and the ancestor of the
Hittites
(Gen. 10:18; Deut. 7:1), who dwelt in the vicinity of Hebron
(Gen. 23:3, 7). The Hittites were a Hamitic race.
They are called &quot;the sons of *HETH* &quot; (Gen. 23:3, 5, 7, 10, 16, 18,
20)

&lt;&lt;The children of Canaan were to Israel what sin is to the Christian:
a constant source of defeat. It is therefore not surprising to find
that the name of the 1stborn (of sin) is Sidon which means &quot;snare,&quot;
.               and the next born *HETH* which means *TERROR* .&gt;&gt;
