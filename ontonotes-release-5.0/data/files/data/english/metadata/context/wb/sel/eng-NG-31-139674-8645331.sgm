Last night, my brother and I missed a 6D contract on this hand

xxx
xx
Jxx
KQxxx

AK
AK
AT987x
ATx

(We bid 2C-2D; 2NT-3NT, but even had I opened 1D, I doubt we get to
6D.  Only a strong club with relays gets to 6D, I fear).

So here is my question.

What is mathematically the safest list for limiting diamond losers to
1?

Playing the AD and a diamond wins on all 2-2 breaks (40%) plus half of
the 3-1 breaks (additional 25%) for a total of 65%.

Playing for clubs 3-2 (68%) and taking two finesses wins against all
2-2 (40%) and 3-1 (50%) breaks unless the KQ diamonds is doubleton
offside (16.7% of the 40% chance = 6.67%).

So my calculations suggest that playing the AD and a diamond will win
about 65% of the time but the two finesess line will win about 56% of
the time (83% of 68%).

Not being a mathmetician, can anyone verify that these numbers are
ballpark correct?

Thanks,

I routinely see 76% quoted as the chance for 1 loser using two
finesses. While I don't feel up to doing the calculations a quick rule
of thumb says there is one chance out of 2 for an opponent to hold a
diamond honor. Consequently the odds of holding both is 1/2 time 1/2
or 1/4 so you win unless your LHO has both which comes to 75% odds of
making. BTW playing for the drop of one honor under the A or crashing
both together is essentially the same and only marginally inferior
(0-4 break is generally the difference I think).

You can never pick up KQx off[1/4 3-1 breaks], but if it is KQ[x][x] or
stiff honor onside you only need clubs 4-1. So, for 2-2 breaks we have
2/3*.40*.68+1/6*.40*.96=24.92%, for 3-1 breaks we have
1/2*.50*.96+1/4*.50*.68=32.33%, for 4-0 we have 1/2*.10*.96=4.598%.  All
together 61.85%.  Of course this ignores any effect one suit
breaking/not breaking will have on the other suit or the possibility
that west is stiff honor, stiff in the minors or void, void in the
minors.  Alternatively you could just play 6N and not worry about all of
this. :)

Tricky one.

Crossing to dummy doesn't always fail if clubs are 4-1.

If diamonds are KQ(xx) onside (around 24%), or RHO has a stiff honour
(12%), you are safe, because you don't have to cross to dummy the second
time.

So of the 76% raw chance of picking up diamonds with 2 finesses, 40% is at
risk of clubs 4-1 (28%).  And almost all of it is at risk if clubs are 5-0
(4%).  So subtract about 14% from your original 76% to get 62% from the 2
finesses line.

So I think the 2 finesses line is around 62%.  Ace and another works about
66% of the time.

Now add in the intangible - no singleton club lead.  So now you have to
look at the auction, and the actual opening lead - was it from a major suit
sequence?

Toss a coin time.

The diamonds can split, KQ2/3, KQ3/2, K32-&gt;Q, Q32-&gt;K, or Q-&gt;K32, K-&gt;Q32,
or unfavorably 3-&gt;KQ2 2-&gt;KQ3

So 6 out of 8 or 3/4 of the time the finesse works when diamonds are 3-1.

When the diamonds are 2-2: K2, Q2, KQ, K3, Q3, 32, so the other side is
the mirror Q3, K3, 23, Q2, K2, KQ

So you only gain by playing the Ace, one time in six when RHO has KQ.

So finessing works 3/4 x 50% for 3-1 = .375
&quot;    &quot;          &quot;  5/6 x 40% for 2-2 = .333
&quot;    &quot;          &quot;  1/2 x 10% for 4-0 = .05
Grand total =       ~76%

The clubs don't matter because they don't give you enough tricks
to make the contract, one still has to establish the diamonds in
order to make the contract, though I guess if the clubs break 4-1
and the same hand which has the long club has the diamond honors
offside, one would go down two.

">

The two finesses line works about 76% of the time as shown above.
Playing for the drop works in all the 2-2 cases but none of the 4-0
cases, = 41%. And 3-1 = 1/2 x 50% = 25% for a grand total of ~66%.

So your drop calculation is right for 2-2 but the 3-1 finesse works
for 3/4 of the possibilities of the 50% happening 3-1, since the
singleton honor also works for the finesse approach when onside. Playing
for the drop also gives up half the 10% of the time 4-0 split onside.

I think it is easy to get to six of a minor in Standard American.
After a 2C opening, a 2H or 2S bid shows a five card suit headed by
two of the top three honors. Similarly, with five clubs responder just
bids 3C to show a five card suit headed by two of the top three
honors. Now the partnership should at least get to 6C.

&gt;
&gt; Playing the AD and a diamond wins on all 2-2 breaks (40%) plus half of
&gt; the 3-1 breaks (additional 25%) for a total of 65%.
&gt;

Covering 3-2 club split first:

The diamonds can split, KQ2/3, KQ3/2, K32-&gt;Q, Q32-&gt;K, or Q-&gt;K32, K-&gt;Q32,
or unfavorably 3-&gt;KQ2 2-&gt;KQ3 [6 out of 8 favorable]

So 6 out of 8 or 3/4 of the time the finesse works when diamonds are 3-1.

When the diamonds are 2-2: K2, Q2, KQ, K3, Q3, 32, so the other side is
the mirror Q3, K3, 23, Q2, K2, KQ [six ways]

So you only gain by playing the Ace, one time in six when RHO has KQ.

So finessing works 3/4 x 50% for 3-1 = .375
&quot;    &quot;          &quot;  5/6 x 40% for 2-2 = .333
&quot;    &quot;          &quot;  1/2 x 10% for 4-0 = .05
Grand total =       ~76%

&gt; Playing for clubs 3-2 (68%) and taking two finesses wins against all
&gt; 2-2 (40%) and 3-1 (50%) breaks unless the KQ diamonds is doubleton
&gt; offside (16.7% of the 40% chance = 6.67%).

&gt;

&gt; So my calculations suggest that playing the AD and a diamond will win
&gt; about 65% of the time but the two finesess line will win about 56% of
&gt; the time (83% of 68%).

Hmmm, I'm not following this, it is 83% - 6.67% = 76% so it is a
subtraction operation, not a multiplication.

&gt;

The drop percentage is right. When diamonds are 4-0, there is a 5%
chance they will split onside which means only one club entry is needed.
4-0 splits are 10% with 4 cards out in the suit.

However your finesse percentage figuring seems off.
When clubs are 4-1, the onside 4-0 diamond split still works.
4 of the eight 3-1 splits work: KQ2/3, KQ3/2, or Q-&gt;K32, K-&gt;Q32,.
And 1 of the 4 2-2 splits work, KQ onside.

So in terms of the contract failing, trying finesses approach:

10% of the time, when diamonds are 4-0, C=4/1, fails 1/2 x 10% = 5%

68% of the time, when diamonds are 3-1, C=4/1, fails 15% x 50% = 7%
[.22 x .68 = .15; .15 x 1/2 : KQ2, KQ3, K-&gt;Q32 or Q-&gt;K32 of 8 chances]

40% of the time, when diamonds are 2-2, C=4/1, fails 1/6 x 40% = 6%

68% of the time, when diamonds are 3-1, C=3/2  fails 1/4 x 68% = 17%

4% of the time, clubs will split 5-0, 4% x 100%                = 4%

-----------------------------------------------Total against   = 39%

Total for: 61%

This reminded me of the old days of figuring Backgammon chance trees.

Good observations. I think there is likely a 1 in 4 chance that the
long clubs are in the same hand as the long diamonds, so then no ruff.
Thinking about it approximately, if there is a 76% chance when the
clubs are 3-2 of making the slam, then when the clubs are 4-1, 22%, the
chances are about 1/5 less than 76%, or 76 - 15 = 61 when clubs are 4-1.

Now, a bit off topic, but about diamonds and slam contracts, remember
Henry's thread about Steve and his creative 4D jump after bidding 1NT?

I've been reading &quot;Precision Today&quot;. Henry held the AKQT9 of diamonds
and a one club opening hand. Steve's response would have been 2 diamonds
since you bid your 5-card suits even if they are poor quality and it
shows 8+ points. So Henry would have known right away that they had a
10 card fit with no losers in trump. Since you are allowed to bid 1NT
with a balanced hand, 8-13 hcp and a 5 card minor, the 2D bid indicates
a singleton since he would have likely bid NT with such a poor suit, so
systemically he couldn't bid a NT because his hand is not balanced. The
4D thread hand really showcases the strength of Precision in that case!
I like the Lawrence 2/1 workbook too, so I guess your mileage will vary.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (We bid 2C-2D; 2NT-3NT, but even had I opened 1D, I doubt we get to
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6D.  Only a strong club with relays gets to 6D, I fear).

&gt;&gt;&gt; So here is my question.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What is mathematically the safest list for limiting diamond losers to
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Playing the AD and a diamond wins on all 2-2 breaks (40%) plus half of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the 3-1 breaks (additional 25%) for a total of 65%.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Playing for clubs 3-2 (68%) and taking two finesses wins against all
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2-2 (40%) and 3-1 (50%) breaks unless the KQ diamonds is doubleton
&gt;&gt;&gt; offside (16.7% of the 40% chance = 6.67%).

&gt;&gt;&gt; So my calculations suggest that playing the AD and a diamond will win
&gt;&gt;&gt; about 65% of the time but the two finesess line will win about 56% of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the time (83% of 68%).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not being a mathmetician, can anyone verify that these numbers are
&gt;&gt;&gt; ballpark correct?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,

&gt;&gt; Tricky one.

&gt;&gt; Crossing to dummy doesn't always fail if clubs are 4-1.
&gt;&gt; If diamonds are KQ(xx) onside (around 24%), or RHO has a stiff honour
&gt;&gt; (12%), you are safe, because you don't have to cross to dummy the
&gt;&gt; second time.
&gt;&gt; So of the 76% raw chance of picking up diamonds with 2 finesses, 40%
&gt;&gt; is at risk of clubs 4-1 (28%).  And almost all of it is at risk if
&gt;&gt; clubs are 5-0 (4%).  So subtract about 14% from your original 76% to
&gt;&gt; get 62% from the 2 finesses line.

&gt;&gt; So I think the 2 finesses line is around 62%.  Ace and another works
&gt;&gt; about 66% of the time.
&gt;&gt; Now add in the intangible - no singleton club lead.  So now you have
&gt;&gt; to look at the auction, and the actual opening lead - was it from a
&gt;&gt; major suit sequence?

&gt;&gt; Toss a coin time.
&gt;&gt; Cheers ... Bill

&gt; Good observations. I think there is likely a 1 in 4 chance that the
&gt; long clubs are in the same hand as the long diamonds, so then no ruff.

The clubs do matter as to take the finesse twice, in the event that the
first finesse loses you need to cross to dummy in clubs twice in total,
which risks a opponent ruffing whilst he still has a trump left.

&gt; --
&gt; Gordon Rainsford

&gt; London UK-

What source are you citing from which requires 1.5 QT for a positive
response in Standard American?
I have have never heard of this requirement.

If you are playing 2D waiting which is a fairly common choice in the
US, you could have more than 1.5 QT for a 2D response. For example,
partner could have S Axx   H AKx   D xxx   C xxxx and this hand has 3
QT. In Max Hardy's book in two over one (which is essentially Walsh),
&quot;With a five card or longer suit which includes two of the top three
honors cards, responder to 2C bids his suit at the cheapest level.&quot;

The logic for this is if you have controls you can always find out
them later and if responder has a better hand he knows when to keep
the bidding alive. But if you have a hand with a source of tricks it
is nearly impossible to tell partner this after showing controls.
Also, if you don't bid a suit right away but bid the suit later
partner knows you need a lot more help in the suit.

After bidding 3C with this hand, little can go wrong. If partner
intended to rebid 2NT he will rebid 3NT and you will be happy to pass
as you would have raised to 3NT anyway. If partner bids a suit you
know partner has promised a trick under game and you have that trick
so the auction is forcing to game. The big advantage to showing a
source of tricks happens when you get a pair of hands like the example
here and you can't show the club suit.

I agree. More specifically
Ace and another: 65.6%

Double finesse --
If no bidding &amp; lead inferences: 62.1%
Assuming RHO would double with club void: 63.3%

Against fallible opponents yet a third line -- &quot;cross and bluff&quot; --
might be best. Cross in clubs, play the dJ and go with the Ace if it
is not covered. Against an opponent who always splits with 2 honors
this brings home the contract some 80% of the time. Therefore if
there's even 1 chance in 5 for the opponent to stupidly split it will
be a good practical play.

Another slight edge might be obtained by varying one's play according
as whether RHO drops the club Jack on the first round of the suit.

I admit I didn't know how to figure it out so I use a crude method
of approximation. I gave the hand to the right of the Ace of diamonds
1 club and 3 diamonds, so having 9 vacancies to be filled by 3 clubs.
I gave the other hand to the left of the Ace of diamonds, 1 club and
1 diamond, so having 11 vacancies to be filled by 3 clubs, and I
thought the 11 to 9 edge ought to be worth about a 3 to 1 favorite.
Suprise, except that probability is all that intuitive.

So what is the calculation to figure the correct chance of each
of the two hands to be dealt 3 more clubs?

&gt; If you are playing 2D waiting which is a fairly common choice in the

&gt; What is mathematically the safest list for limiting diamond losers to

&gt; Playing the AD and a diamond wins on all 2-2 breaks (40%) plus half of

&gt; Playing for clubs 3-2 (68%) and taking two finesses wins against all
&gt; 2-2 (40%) and 3-1 (50%) breaks unless the KQ diamonds is doubleton
&gt; offside (16.7% of the 40% chance = 6.67%).

&gt; So my calculations suggest that playing the AD and a diamond will win
&gt; about 65% of the time but the two finesess line will win about 56% of
&gt; the time (83% of 68%).

&gt; Not being a mathmetician, can anyone verify that these numbers are

Why not examine the play in the superior 6NT. Now you can ignore the club
breaks and just take the percentage line in diamonds (two finesses).

Because if 3N is a hand that was planning to rebid 2N then it can also
be a balanced 24 count, a hand that wants to be in slam opposite a
positive response.  If this hand[balanced 24 count] can't bid 3N it has
to distort in some fashion, a bad idea when you are essentially looking
for 7.  Even bump it up, what is a 3=4=4=2 26 count supposed to do over
3C if 3N isn't forcing?  On the other hand, opposite what I consider a
positive response 4N is almost surely safe opposite 22+ balanced.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tricky one.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Crossing to dummy doesn't always fail if clubs are 4-1.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If diamonds are KQ(xx) onside (around 24%), or RHO has a stiff honour
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (12%), you are safe, because you don't have to cross to dummy the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; second time.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So of the 76% raw chance of picking up diamonds with 2 finesses, 40%
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is at risk of clubs 4-1 (28%).  And almost all of it is at risk if
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clubs are 5-0 (4%).  So subtract about 14% from your original 76% to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get 62% from the 2 finesses line.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I think the 2 finesses line is around 62%.  Ace and another works
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about 66% of the time.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now add in the intangible - no singleton club lead.  So now you have
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to look at the auction, and the actual opening lead - was it from a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; major suit sequence?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Toss a coin time.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers ... Bill
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Good observations. I think there is likely a 1 in 4 chance that the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; long clubs are in the same hand as the long diamonds, so then no ruff.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1 in 4?  It's closer to 1 in 21.

&gt; &gt; Yes. I make it 1/17 strictly on the numbers, i.e. ignoring inferences
&gt; &gt; from the lead and lack of Lightner double.

&gt; &gt; Charles

&gt; I admit I didn't know how to figure it out so I use a crude method
&gt; of approximation. I gave the hand to the right of the Ace of diamonds
&gt; 1 club and 3 diamonds, so having 9 vacancies to be filled by 3 clubs.
&gt; I gave the other hand to the left of the Ace of diamonds, 1 club and
&gt; 1 diamond, so having 11 vacancies to be filled by 3 clubs, and I
&gt; thought the 11 to 9 edge ought to be worth about a 3 to 1 favorite.
&gt; Suprise, except that probability is all that intuitive.

&gt; So what is the calculation to figure the correct chance of each
&gt; of the two hands to be dealt 3 more clubs?
">

To compute that directly would be hard, and I think would involve
making the calculation the straightforward way along the way anyway.

The straightforward way is to calculate the number of RHO hands which
have (for example)
11 of the 17 available major suit cards
1 of the 4 diamonds
1 of the 5 clubs

and divide that by the total number of possible hands calculated as
the number of ways to select 13 cards from the 26 unseen cards.

One would think if you could have a 22 hcp balanced minimum you need
3NT to limit your hand immediately so partner knows what to do if he
has a minimum. If you have a balanced 25+ hcp you have to find another
bid to explore for slam. The simplest would be to raise clubs one
level. Another alternative is to have an understanding that 4NT would
be natural and not forcing with a doubleton club.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Crossing to dummy doesn't always fail if clubs are 4-1.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If diamonds are KQ(xx) onside (around 24%), or RHO has a stiff honour
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (12%), you are safe, because you don't have to cross to dummy the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; second time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So of the 76% raw chance of picking up diamonds with 2 finesses, 40%
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is at risk of clubs 4-1 (28%).  And almost all of it is at risk if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clubs are 5-0 (4%).  So subtract about 14% from your original 76% to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get 62% from the 2 finesses line.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I think the 2 finesses line is around 62%.  Ace and another works
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about 66% of the time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now add in the intangible - no singleton club lead.  So now you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to look at the auction, and the actual opening lead - was it from a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; major suit sequence?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Toss a coin time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers ... Bill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good observations. I think there is likely a 1 in 4 chance that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; long clubs are in the same hand as the long diamonds, so then no ruff.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 in 4?  It's closer to 1 in 21.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. I make it 1/17 strictly on the numbers, i.e. ignoring inferences
&gt;&gt;&gt; from the lead and lack of Lightner double.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Charles
&gt;&gt; I admit I didn't know how to figure it out so I use a crude method
&gt;&gt; of approximation. I gave the hand to the right of the Ace of diamonds
&gt;&gt; 1 club and 3 diamonds, so having 9 vacancies to be filled by 3 clubs.
&gt;&gt; I gave the other hand to the left of the Ace of diamonds, 1 club and
&gt;&gt; 1 diamond, so having 11 vacancies to be filled by 3 clubs, and I
&gt;&gt; thought the 11 to 9 edge ought to be worth about a 3 to 1 favorite.
&gt;&gt; Suprise, except that probability is all that intuitive.

&gt;&gt; So what is the calculation to figure the correct chance of each
&gt;&gt; of the two hands to be dealt 3 more clubs?

&gt; To compute that directly would be hard, and I think would involve
&gt; making the calculation the straightforward way along the way anyway.

&gt; The straightforward way is to calculate the number of RHO hands which
&gt; have (for example)
&gt; 11 of the 17 available major suit cards
&gt; 1 of the 4 diamonds
&gt; 1 of the 5 clubs

&gt; and divide that by the total number of possible hands calculated as
&gt; the number of ways to select 13 cards from the 26 unseen cards.

Lazy person that I am, I just looked up the odds that 9 cards break 7-2,
and found it to be .0857, and then determined that the 1-1s were only 40
out of 72 of the 7-2 breaks.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; London UK-

&gt; &gt; &gt; What source are you citing from which requires 1.5 QT for a positive
&gt; &gt; &gt; response in Standard American?
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have have never heard of this requirement.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are playing 2D waiting which is a fairly common choice in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; US, you could have more than 1.5 QT for a 2D response. For example,
&gt; &gt; &gt; partner could have S Axx   H AKx   D xxx   C xxxx and this hand has 3
&gt; &gt; &gt; QT. In Max Hardy's book in two over one (which is essentially Walsh),
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;With a five card or longer suit which includes two of the top three
&gt; &gt; &gt; honors cards, responder to 2C bids his suit at the cheapest level.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; The logic for this is if you have controls you can always find out
&gt; &gt; &gt; them later and if responder has a better hand he knows when to keep
&gt; &gt; &gt; the bidding alive. But if you have a hand with a source of tricks it
&gt; &gt; &gt; is nearly impossible to tell partner this after showing controls.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, if you don't bid a suit right away but bid the suit later
&gt; &gt; &gt; partner knows you need a lot more help in the suit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; After bidding 3C with this hand, little can go wrong. If partner
&gt; &gt; &gt; intended to rebid 2NT he will rebid 3NT and you will be happy to pass
&gt; &gt; &gt; as you would have raised to 3NT anyway.

&gt; &gt; Isn't 3N forcing?

Eric makes the interesting point that perhaps my brother should have
responded 3C = good suit instead of making a negative/neutral 2D
response.  Surely this would have been more attractive had his clubs
been a major.  We don't play the style were positive = good suit, 2D =
denies good suit although I know if it from the days of Western Roth-
Stone (and when I picked up Aces Scientific much later in life).

Still, Goldman concedes - correctly - that specifically the 3C
response should be looser with respect to suit quality because of the
artificial second negative (2C-2D; 2MN-3C) which prevernt a hand like

x
Axx
xxx
KJxxxx

from bidding 3C naturally.

The idea proposed by Travis, that 3NT would be forcing after a
positive response, has its roots in the idea that a strong two +
positive response = slam.  When a positive shows a good suit, that
arithmetic no longer holds.  Give response a slightly stronger hand
(so that the issue of whether the hand is a positive response is moot)
and opener a strong/misfitting hand and you'll see what 3NT should not
be played as forcing, e.g.:

Kx
xxx
xxx
KQxxx

AQxx
AKJx
AKQ
xx

Now you pretty much need clubs 3-3 with the ace onside to have play
for slam, and that's about a 20% slam.  (I could have cooked the hand
by giving opener 4=4=4=1 shape, of course.)

The issue of what game bids are forcing after a positive response is
one that hasn't really been explored.  There was a hand in the MSC
some years ago when opener held something on the order of:

AKJxxxx
AKQxx
VOID
x

After opening 2C (even the most ardent supporters of 'don't bid 2C
with a two suiter should have no problems with opening this hand with
2C) and hearing the auction go:

2C     3D (natural/positive)
3S     3NT
?

Much ink was used on the question of whether 4H by opener would be
forcing.  Those who bid 4H generally felt it was forcing and some who
rebid 4S did so because they feared 4H was forcing.  After all, give
responder a hand like

x
xx
KQTxxx
KJxx

and so you really want to play anywhere besideds 4S?  And if opener
did rebid 4H, would this be the sort of hand on which one would give
false preference to 4S?

So while Eric is right on the initial sequence (2C-3C; 3NT should not
be played as forcing), the more general question of what game bids ARE
forcing in 2C sequences is, to me, a still unresolved question.

Over 3NT, responder would bid 4NT slam invitational with this hand and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So here is my question.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What is mathematically the safest list for limiting diamond losers to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Playing the AD and a diamond wins on all 2-2 breaks (40%) plus half of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the 3-1 breaks (additional 25%) for a total of 65%.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Playing for clubs 3-2 (68%) and taking two finesses wins against all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2-2 (40%) and 3-1 (50%) breaks unless the KQ diamonds is doubleton
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offside (16.7% of the 40% chance = 6.67%).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So my calculations suggest that playing the AD and a diamond will win
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about 65% of the time but the two finesess line will win about 56% of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the time (83% of 68%).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not being a mathmetician, can anyone verify that these numbers are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ballpark correct?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Henrysun909
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tricky one.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Crossing to dummy doesn't always fail if clubs are 4-1.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If diamonds are KQ(xx) onside (around 24%), or RHO has a stiff honour
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (12%), you are safe, because you don't have to cross to dummy the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; second time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So of the 76% raw chance of picking up diamonds with 2 finesses, 40%
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is at risk of clubs 4-1 (28%).  And almost all of it is at risk if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clubs are 5-0 (4%).  So subtract about 14% from your original 76% to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get 62% from the 2 finesses line.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I think the 2 finesses line is around 62%.  Ace and another works
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about 66% of the time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now add in the intangible - no singleton club lead.  So now you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to look at the auction, and the actual opening lead - was it from a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; major suit sequence?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Toss a coin time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers ... Bill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good observations. I think there is likely a 1 in 4 chance that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; long clubs are in the same hand as the long diamonds, so then no ruff.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 in 4?  It's closer to 1 in 21.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. I make it 1/17 strictly on the numbers, i.e. ignoring inferences
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the lead and lack of Lightner double.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Charles
&gt;&gt;&gt; I admit I didn't know how to figure it out so I use a crude method
&gt;&gt;&gt; of approximation. I gave the hand to the right of the Ace of diamonds
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 club and 3 diamonds, so having 9 vacancies to be filled by 3 clubs.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I gave the other hand to the left of the Ace of diamonds, 1 club and
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 diamond, so having 11 vacancies to be filled by 3 clubs, and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; thought the 11 to 9 edge ought to be worth about a 3 to 1 favorite.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Suprise, except that probability is all that intuitive.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So what is the calculation to figure the correct chance of each
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the two hands to be dealt 3 more clubs?
&gt;&gt; To compute that directly would be hard, and I think would involve
&gt;&gt; making the calculation the straightforward way along the way anyway.

&gt;&gt; The straightforward way is to calculate the number of RHO hands which
&gt;&gt; have (for example)
&gt;&gt; 11 of the 17 available major suit cards
&gt;&gt; 1 of the 4 diamonds
&gt;&gt; 1 of the 5 clubs

&gt;&gt; and divide that by the total number of possible hands calculated as
&gt;&gt; the number of ways to select 13 cards from the 26 unseen cards.

&gt;&gt; Charles

&gt; Lazy person that I am, I just looked up the odds that 9 cards break 7-2,
&gt; and found it to be .0857, and then determined that the 1-1s were only 40
&gt; out of 72 of the 7-2 breaks.

the probability that at least one suit will divide evenly is 53.57%

_a_       _b_    _c_
5-4     28.05%  80.47%

I'm having a hard time grasping the explanations, especially Travis,
so I looked this up on the internet. Assuming that an dividing evenly
for clubs means in our case is 3-2 and for diamonds 2-2, doesn't the
chart mean that if the chances are 28% that both suits will split
evenly, then the odds are 72% that both suits will not split evenly?

Since the original problem is making 6D, then this split is favorable
only half the time, 36%, when the long holdings in both minor suits
are in the hand which is vulnerable to the repeated diamond finesse.
I think this calculation includes 5-0 clubs splits (4%) or when the
diamonds split 4-0 (9.6%), but this doesn't harm the chances of making
the contract and actually just considering having both 4-1 club splits
with 3-1 diamond splits in the hand vulnerable to the diamond finesses
will improve the chances up from 36%.

So do you think I've misinterpreted the chart or that it is in error?

_N_
xxx
xx
Jxx
KQxxx

_S_
AK
AK
AT987x
ATx

The question is what are the chances East has long clubs and diamonds
so that declarer can go to the board with clubs for diamond finesses.

_E_
?
?
xxxx (at least 4 or could be 5 with 5 cards outstanding in suit)

KQx  (any one of the 3 card diamond splits, or could be KQxx with
4 outstanding in suit to meet the distribution of two hidden suits
in two hands criteria of the chart, 5 clubs - 4 diamonds otherwise
both suits or at least one would be considered to be divided evenly)

I think the chart says this distribution for East is about 36%.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6D.  Only a strong club with relays gets to 6D, I fear).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So here is my question.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What is mathematically the safest list for limiting diamond losers to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Playing the AD and a diamond wins on all 2-2 breaks (40%) plus half of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the 3-1 breaks (additional 25%) for a total of 65%.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Playing for clubs 3-2 (68%) and taking two finesses wins against all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2-2 (40%) and 3-1 (50%) breaks unless the KQ diamonds is doubleton
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offside (16.7% of the 40% chance = 6.67%).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So my calculations suggest that playing the AD and a diamond will win
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about 65% of the time but the two finesess line will win about 56% of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the time (83% of 68%).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not being a mathmetician, can anyone verify that these numbers are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ballpark correct?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Henrysun909
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tricky one.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Crossing to dummy doesn't always fail if clubs are 4-1.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If diamonds are KQ(xx) onside (around 24%), or RHO has a stiff honour
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (12%), you are safe, because you don't have to cross to dummy the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; second time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So of the 76% raw chance of picking up diamonds with 2 finesses, 40%
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is at risk of clubs 4-1 (28%).  And almost all of it is at risk if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clubs are 5-0 (4%).  So subtract about 14% from your original 76% to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get 62% from the 2 finesses line.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I think the 2 finesses line is around 62%.  Ace and another works
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about 66% of the time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now add in the intangible - no singleton club lead.  So now you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to look at the auction, and the actual opening lead - was it from a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; major suit sequence?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Toss a coin time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers ... Bill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good observations. I think there is likely a 1 in 4 chance that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; long clubs are in the same hand as the long diamonds, so then no ruff.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 in 4?  It's closer to 1 in 21.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. I make it 1/17 strictly on the numbers, i.e. ignoring inferences
&gt;&gt;&gt; from the lead and lack of Lightner double.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Charles
&gt;&gt; I admit I didn't know how to figure it out so I use a crude method
&gt;&gt; of approximation. I gave the hand to the right of the Ace of diamonds
&gt;&gt; 1 club and 3 diamonds, so having 9 vacancies to be filled by 3 clubs.
&gt;&gt; I gave the other hand to the left of the Ace of diamonds, 1 club and
&gt;&gt; 1 diamond, so having 11 vacancies to be filled by 3 clubs, and I
&gt;&gt; thought the 11 to 9 edge ought to be worth about a 3 to 1 favorite.
&gt;&gt; Suprise, except that probability is all that intuitive.

&gt;&gt; So what is the calculation to figure the correct chance of each
&gt;&gt; of the two hands to be dealt 3 more clubs?

&gt; To compute that directly would be hard, and I think would involve
&gt; making the calculation the straightforward way along the way anyway.

&gt; The straightforward way is to calculate the number of RHO hands which
&gt; have (for example)
&gt; 11 of the 17 available major suit cards
&gt; 1 of the 4 diamonds
&gt; 1 of the 5 clubs

&gt; and divide that by the total number of possible hands calculated as
&gt; the number of ways to select 13 cards from the 26 unseen cards.

&gt; Charles
">

I don't grok this, your answer 1/17 is only about 6%.

The East hand was given xxx in diamonds and x in clubs so
there are 9 vacancies to fill. The West hand was given x
in diamonds and x in clubs, so 11 vacancies to fill.

That means there are 3 clubs randomly mixed into a total
of 20 vacancies, so how will they get distributed. Much
like tossing a coin 3 times and what are the chances it
will come up head 3 times, 1/8 or 12.5%. But since the
(which is like the clubs landing 3 times out of 3 in East)
coin is slightly heavier on one side than the other in
this club dividing process, the chances are close to 10.7%
Which makes my original estimate off by more than 133%
and your answer too small by about 80%. 11/20 vs. 9/20

10.7% meets common sense filters and updates url report,

I would lead a club to the king and lead the diamond jack.
I might not have to think if RHO covers which he might from  Kx, Qx,
or even KQx.
Also, if RHO plays low, the tempo of his play might give me a better
clue how to play the diamonds.
But anyway, now you can decide how to play the diamonds.

In the case of KQx or KQ it doesn't matter whether it is covered
or not, because declarer can't play it wrong.

Defender doesn't know if declarer has 6 or 7 diamonds.

So partner could have singleton K or Q and covering
with Kx or Qx when partner has the other singleton honor
gives up the whole suit. Your lead the Jack and see if they
hesitate might work against Intermediate players and below
but certainly not good players, so it is best to select the
mathematically superior approach which is to play for the drop.

AKxxx

Qxx             J

T9xx

or

AKxxx

QJx             x

T9xx

or

AKxxx

QJx

T9xxx

In all these cases defenders know not to cover the Ten because
they know declarer is governed by 8 never, nine never dictum.
Hoping your opps are bad players and misdefend is a less than
optimum approach to selecting a winning line of play. It made
me wonder, who does this guy play against? Against 4-4 fits, it
(not found in a unilateral 2C opener bidding his strong suit)
matters if you see the 8 in dummy, or dummy is short of entries.

An old grand master bridge player once told me &quot;Every player has the
God given right to make a mistake.&quot;
So if you never give your opponents a chance to make a mistake it
stands to reason you can't get lucky.
You can go through your bridge life as a technician playing opponents
as abstract objects striving to find the last decimal point advantage
or you can try to be an artist. Being a technician is like comparing a
house painter to a Picasso..

I refer you to a hand I played which was reported at the Daily
Bulletin for the ACBL Nationals in Pittsburg in 2005 which was a
similar trump situation.
