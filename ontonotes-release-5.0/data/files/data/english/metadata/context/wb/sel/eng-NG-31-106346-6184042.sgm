Can I wash clothes in the dishwasher?

I absolutely hate washing my bras by hand. My parents had a front load
washer with a "hand wash" cycle that I used to use for all my hand
wash clothes. I now live in an apartment with a cheap spin cycle
washer and it rips straps and loosens hems on clothes that are washer
safe, so I would never use it for hand wash items. I'm wondering if I
can load these items (mainly bras) into the dishwasher and use laundry
detergent instead of dishwashing detergent. Any thoughts on if this
would work?

P.S. It's not so much that I'm lazy. I'm working 80 hours a week as
I'm an accounant in the middle of tax season. AHH!

I'm no expert, but couldn't you get one of those bag things that you
stuff things in to prevent bits from getting caught in the mechanical
bits?

I would be concerned about too much sudsing.  Ever seen what happens
when a little bit of the wrong kind of soap (i.e. dish soap) gets
into a dishwasher?  It's not pretty, unless you like foot-deep suds
covering half your kitchen floor.

exactly.  Just get a lingerie bag and wash them with the rest of your
stuff.  Bras can actually tolerate a regular wash if you close the hooks
on them, unless you've got some kinda fancy lacy stuff made out of tissue
paper.  also;  You don't have to wash them after just one wearing.  Good
bras can be had for under $20.

I'm half suspecting this is a troll, but I'll withold judgment on that...

Any sudsing detergent in the dishwasher is contraindicated - it'll foam up
and the machine will overflow, you'll spend more time cleaning up the mess
than you would've spent hand washing your underwear.

Depending on the dishwasher, the water may be too hot for your stuff - some
dishwashers heat the water if it's not hot enough.  Also, dishwashers don't
tumble things around.  Any cloth will just lay there and collect food any
food particles that land on it.  I suppose if the dishwasher is squeaky
clean, that wouldn't be a problem.

I think the easiest and best approach would be empirical.  Try it with one
or two items.  If it works, fine, and if it ruins one or two articles, you
haven't lost much.

There is also the option of buying more bras or whatever and letting the
dirty laundry pile up until tax season is over.

If you do try it, use dishwashing detergent so it doesn't oversuds.
Also cut out the drying cycle, which would probably damage the
elastic parts.

Take your bras into the shower or bath with you, and rinse them out then.
Wrap them in a towel to soak the excess water out of them, hang them to dry.
Laundry soap shouldn't be used in the dishwasher, and the water would be too
hot for them anyway.  Your suggestion sounds like more work than just hand
washing them, not to mention the waste of water.

I doubt that would work very well, dishwasher detergent is MUCH
more aggressive than normal washing machine detergent, since it
needs to shift the muck of plates etc which are much more dirty
than clothes ever get and because dishwashers dont immerse the
plates completely like a washing machine does.

Yeah, that would bugger them worse than the current washing machine does.

The obvious alternative is to get a decent front loader with a 'handwash' cycle.

Underwire bras don't like spindle-type agitator washers.  More
accurately: wearers of underwire bras don't like the results of having
put their bras through those types of washers.

Some of us can't get a "good bra" for less than $60 and often they
cost much more.  Handwashing is not an option, it's a necessity.

As for the OP:

Yes, you *can* put your bras on the top rack of the DW - but chances
are good they'll act like sieves and trap all the stuff that you
otherwise don't see on your dishes.  If you try the experiment don't
use regular laundry detergent unless you want to spend the time you
think you've "saved" in mopping up suds from the floor.

What is so hard about handwashing?  Fill the basin with hot water and
a squirt of shampoo, drop in the bras and go do something else for 20
minutes.  Come back, stir a couple of times, drain, rinse under
running water, blot with a towel and hang up.  Total time invested is
about 5 minutes.

all I know is my own experience; I have all underwire bras, and they've
all done just fine washed in a standard top-loading washing machine.  It
takes years and years before an underwire will twist, snap, or poke
through, in my experience.

them, rinse the whole bag, and then drip dry straight out of the

As a rule, I can wear bras I find at TJMaxx, other off-price stores, or even
Big Lots when they happen to snag a decent name brand like the Delta Burke
stuff they've had lately. It's unusual for me to pay even $20.

I got a real find at TJMaxx once, some French name that escapes me now and
which I'd never heard of. Everything about the bra was of dazzling quality,
from the appearance to the fit to the support. I looked the brand up on the
Net and discovered they retail from around $125 to $150. Call me naive, but
I never thought about a bra costing that much. I guess the rich really are
different &lt;g&gt;.

Truly, you speak much wisdom!  To be even more stress-free, wash 'em
while you're in the bath or showering.  Wet, soap, scrub a bit (if
needed), then let it sit while you shower, then rinse the bra when you
rinse you!

Also, if replace your shower head with a hand-held shower attachment
(I will never not have one again!) for about 30 bucks,  you will have
a lot of flexibility for rinsing the shower, the tub, you, and your
delicate unmentionables.  If I installed mine, then you know that it
has to be easy to do.

I wash all my underwire or delicate bras by hand.  All I do is use a
tablespoon or so of liquid laundry soap in room temperature water.  I
use the laundry sink, or if you have no laundry sink, the kitchen sink
(my husband hated when I used the kitchen sink in our condo because it
was only a single sink - he often threatened to dump the pasta water
on top of my bras... so bewary of this!)  Then once they have soaked
for a few hours (or overnight) I just change the water, rinse them
well and hang to dry.  I used to hang them off the shower head so they
could drip into the tub (another annoyance for my husband).

You betcha.  A "cheap" $20 might work for somebody who has A/B cup
boobs (maybe even a C, I wouldn't know anymore).  I wear a FF/G cup.
There's a gal in town who made my nursing bras - and worth every
penny! - but she's too dear for regular daily wear.

For daily wear I buy Freya brand bras, which are made in .eu.  The
dollar is finished circling the drain and is now in the pipes
somewhere so my daily wear bras currently run about $90.  If I want a
fancy come-do-me bra I can expect to pay upwards of $150 so I only
have two of those.

And before anybody cracks wise: yes, they're natural, no they don't
fluctuate or change size based on how fat or thin I happen to be to be
at any given point in time - the boobs are always a FF/G unless I'm
pregnant or nursing (in which case they're substantially larger).

I think the last time I could wear a non-underwire bra that cost less
than $30 I was still in middle school.

Sweetie, I have a dozen daily-wear bras.  I wear each bra twice and
allow several days' airing between wears.  Too many wearings without
washings kills the elastic in the band.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, once, when I was 14 and wanted to take the easy way out of
dealing with washing my bras.  I trashed the three bras I then had to
my name, had to *go without* for more than a month until I saved
enough to buy a new one.  My parents kept me clothed, but since I
ruined my own bras I was responsible for replacing them.  Were you
required to participate in gym class with two unfettered masses of
flesh the size of small infants attached to your chest for a month you
too might reconsider how you treat your bras.

Have you ever *seen* a G-cup underwire?  The damned things have a
larger chord than the space between the spindle base and the side of
the washer drum in most cases.

Do you toss your cashmere sweaters into the washer, with or without a
lingerie bag?  Of course you don't.  You spent good money on those
sweaters so you treat them accordingly.

Or are you suggesting that because I have big boobs and prefer to buy
properly-fitted well-made bras in order to keep my boobs where nature
intended them to be and not down around my knees I must have money to
waste so should just wear them once and toss them?  For that is what
would happen if I put one in the washer.

Why soak a bra for a few hours or overnight?  Soaking for 3-5 minutes, or
just hand washing them while in the shower or bath only takes a few minutes.
Let them soak in the tub if you take a bath...soap them up and let them hang
for a few minutes while you finish your shower. Rinse them out, blot them,
and hang them to dry.   I put mine on plastic hangers, reshape them a bit,
and they dry overnight.  If you work a job where you get really sweaty or
dirty, your needs may differ.

I have 3 "everyday" bras in various colors.  I wear them 2-3 times between
washings, and wash more often in the summer when it's hot.  I like to have
them in beige, light blue, pink, and black.  White bras are a "no no" IMO.
Obviously if I work up a sweat at work (rarely), I wash that bra before
wearing it again.  I have a couple I can wear in a pinch, but once I find a
bra that fits, I buy as many as I can find in that size.

&gt; You must not wear a size over a 36&quot; B cup.  Those of us who wear anything
&gt; over a C cup pay top dollar for a good fitting bra that we can actually
&gt; stand to wear all day long.

All day?  Really?  I can't, I just can't; I get that thing
off first, when I get home from wherever.  Bali, about 15 -
20 bucks at the irregular store.  I'd pay more if I thought
I'd find something actually comfortable, but the best I've
ever done is the Bali, which qualifies as "less
uncomfortable".  And I have a relative who orders from
England to get something for her extra-curvy top half.

Well don't use dishwasher detergent either! I mention that because I
used electric dish soap once in the washer and wound up with still clothes!

NO!  But what I would suggest is to get a counter-top washing machine
as one option (note: I bought one of these at BigLots for $1 on
clearance..but that's the not the price listed in this article):

http://www.laundry-alternative.com/counter_top_washing_machine.htm

An alternate option is to use a sturdy salad spinner.

Last, you could just get those zippered/mesh bags that hold the
unmentionables and throw it in the normal wash; hang to dry.

&gt; As a rule, I can wear bras I find at TJMaxx, other off-price stores, or even
&gt; Big Lots when they happen to snag a decent name brand like the Delta Burke
&gt; stuff they've had lately. It's unusual for me to pay even $20.

&gt; I got a real find at TJMaxx once, some French name that escapes me now and
&gt; which I'd never heard of. Everything about the bra was of dazzling quality,
&gt; from the appearance to the fit to the support. I looked the brand up on the
&gt; Net and discovered they retail from around $125 to $150. Call me naive, but
&gt; I never thought about a bra costing that much. I guess the rich really are
&gt; different &lt;g&gt;.- Hide quoted text -

I'm with you on this.  I swore by Olga front hook racerback bras for
years...and could usually find them at the Olga/Warner outlet store
for about $9-15 (regular retail about $32...and that was when minimum
wage was arouund $4).  But I still throw them in the regular wash in a
lingerie bag and air dry.  I think if I had to wear underwires I'd get
a reduction.  Most reductions are covered by insurance :)

$30?!  feh... you should be able to get one under $10.  I saw some at

Warning! male talking about bras!!! Danger! Danger!

My wife and I participate in a Medieveal recreation group
( www.sca.org ) and she claims that her corselette is one of
the most comfy support garmets she owns.  I'm not talking
about a full corset... This is similar to the Middle eastern choli,
only sleeveless. Looks like the modern equivalent is the longline bra:
http://shop.beautysurg.com/browseproducts/Longline-Bra-with-Full-Supp...
That one is expensive (?!), and doesn't look as comfortable.

An old t-shirt, some duct tape, a friend, some muslin, and some sewing
skills are all that is needed to make a pattern custom fit to you.  I
suppose with the proper sewing skills, you could overcome the uni-look
as well. (Her Italian Renaissance dresses call for this style.)

I think they went through 2-3 muslin mock-ups, refining the shape and
fit until they had a final pattern.

Once the pattern is made, you just use cotton duct, and some boning to
make sure you don't pull out the rings...  I imagine you could adapt
to a front hook/eye closure. Total materials shouldn't cost more than
$10-15 (And your time of course) per garment... if that.... and it's a
custom fit.

Of course, if you don't have the sewing skills (or can't barter for
them) or time, then you might be out of luck.... If anyone is
interested, I'll see if the person who helped my wife make hers has a
"howto" sheet.

Nobody ever NEEDS underwires.  They might want them because they want an
"au naturel" style of bra, but they don't NEED them.

The major manufacturers of large-cup-size bras (not the companies that
distribute to the department stores -- I'm talking about Coalesce,
Pennyrich, etc.) do not use underwires in their bras, and they have
industrial-strength support that is adequate no matter what cup size.

A friend gave me a couple bras she didn't want in a design I hadn't bought
before. They're the ones with the cups made of a molded, shaped, thin layer
of foam. I'd always thought they'd just add weight and bulk I didn't want,
but in fact what they do add is excellent support. These particular ones had

Years ago we bought a house where the heating pipes had never been
cleaned.  It was midsummer and the furnace itself was being repaired
and the repairman needed more room, so the DH took the pipes out of
the cellar and laid them on the back lawn but decided they would be a
hazard to his health to clean at home.  He roped them to the roof of
our huge old station wagon and took them to the car wash.  Total time
to clean 8 huge pipes: 18 minutes, total cost, $4.  A couple of days
later he saw someone else cleaning what looked like heating pipes.  A
week or so later, there was a sign at the car wash prohibiting the
washing of large objects besides cars.  But by then we didn't have to
care.

IT takes about one minute to squirt some cheap shampoo in the
washbasin and
let these soak while you're in the shower.

Then a half minute to rinse and let drip dry over the tub or shower
from a tension rod.
Undies will last for years with this gentle approach.
