China dropped the other shoe Monday. Less than a month after it rejected a United Stated defense department report that criticized its massive military buildup, Beijing signaled that it intends to invest even more money in its armed forces because of the "possible danger" of Taiwan declaring independence. State media quoted the director of a government think tank, the Center for China Studies, as saying "China should further increase the percentage of national defense spending, given the fact that China has not been truly unified." Our sources say the statement by Hu Angang is significant, reflecting the regime's decision to deliberately inflame nationalist sentiment among intellectuals, students and other members of the middle class. In addition to threatening Taiwan, think tanks and state media will increasingly accuse the US and Japan of conspiring to contain China's emergence as a regional and world power....

A left-leaning faction of China's ruling Communist Party is rumored to be circulating a specially produced DVD documentary about the plight of the country's rural poor. The project's purpose is to pressure party officials into energetically supporting the so-called Socialist Countryside initiative that aims to address growing rural unrest. The hard-hitting DVD recalls a confidential video made by the official Xinhua News Agency in 1978, which documented rural squalor and misery in those days. That video, which was shown to Politburo members at a special screening, was used by China's de facto ruler, Deng Xiaoping, to embarrass his rival, Hua Guofeng (Mao's anointed successor). Deng pioneered capitalist reform under the banner of "Socialism With Chinese Characteristics." One could say the producers of today's video are of the opinion that the reforms begun by Deng have worked too well....

China is increasing protection payments to Niger Delta militants whose attacks on foreign oil workers and installations have cut Nigerian oil output by more than 20 percent. Abductions are an especially common tactic by disgruntled groups in the delta, a vast, impoverished wetland that produces the bulk of Nigeria's 2.4 million barrels per day of crude oil. On Sunday, youths freed eight foreign oil workers they held for three days, warning they may strike again if their agreement with the victims' employer, Nigerian owned Peak Oil Company, is not implemented....

China has implemented new regulations to discourage real estate speculation and cool soaring property prices. But the measures--including higher minimum down payments, tighter lending standards and bans on building new luxury villas--are actually aimed at easing public discontent. Housing has become one of the most visible signs of the growing gap between rising China's rich and poor. One indication of the cosmetic character of the new rules: no legal definition for the "luxury" term....

Now that Alan Garcia has defeated ultranationalist Ollanta Humala and won the second and final round of Peru's presidential elections, China is planning to dispatch a high-level delegation to the mineral-rich South American country. From Beijing to Wall Street, investors agree that social democrat Garcia is a man with whom it is possible to do business....
