My family room has a cathedral ceiling. At the top it does not come to
a point but has two seams. The seams have split where the tape was put
dowm. It is very noticeable in the winter and not so bad in the
summer. I would like to paint the ceiling and repair the cracks but I
am concerned the cracks will come right back. Does anyone know how to
stop the crack from returning?

Those type of cracks are very difficult to stop because patching
cmpounds cure hard and thus crack again. You could put some type of
trim molding over the joints or possibly try some type of caulking that
expands. Tim.
