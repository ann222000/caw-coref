Dear all:

If some one will ask me, what is the best quality of an average American, my
answer will be &quot;politeness &amp; soft spoken&quot;.

If you have any Indian or Chinese boss, they can yell at you whenever you do
some mistake, but in case you have any American boss - the same 'yell' will
be rephrased in a decent way and certainly you will like that.

In a recent discussion, Shri Badal Naik pointed that, we blinded followed
some 'western culture' , but we certainly missed to imitate the best quality
of west - 'politeness'.

OTN - we maintain cool in many occasions and hardly lose temper. But we are
all human beings and when 'an offensive word is directed at us in public' -
we lose temper. Things sometimes go out of control. As a moderator,  I try
my best to bring the 'peaceful discussions' to track.

Just yesterday, I was involved in a debate and surprised by the coolness of
Dr.M. Zuhdi Jasser - Head of AIFD and a doctor by profession (Arizona
state.USA).

I would request you to click the following link
http://hindtoday.com/Blogs/ViewBlogs.aspx?HTAdvtId=858&amp;HTAdvtPlaceCod...;

and read the allegation of 'Mike' and answer of  Dr.M. Zuhdi Jasser .

To the allegation of 'liar' he maintained his cool and answered in a decent
manner.

Also, look at the final reply of Mike, it was an appreciation of positive
view of Dr. Jasser and no mention of the earlier allegation.

Shri Viswas Tripathy  rightly pointed out 'not to stretch too much'.

At OTN we are kind of integrated with political system, where we can see
arguements Congress Vs. BJD vs BJP Vs. Samruddha Orissa - but we can always
to it in a polite &amp; cool way.

Thanks in advance for understanding

Manoj Babu,

I have decided not to speak out against you, but, it is somewhat funny
that , words like peace and politeness come from you.

Anyhow, it must be added that, people should personally practice themselves
qualities that they want to subscribe to others.

Regards
Umashankar Das

Dear Umashankar babu,

Our foundation is based on &quot;Free Voice Of Concerned Citizens&quot;.
This free voice to be expressed with careful selection of words while
conveying the same 'meaning' in a decent way.

It is not speaking for or against any individual. we all are here for
cherishing our dream of a better society. I am rich, poor, at USA, at Delhi
- doesn't matter.

I analyze this some X Government is better than Y Government based on some
logic. If you don't like you are free to analyze Y is better than X with
some logic.

I have nothing personal against Naveen any one in this forum. We just differ
in analysing news or issues. In a democracy, being from different
backgrounds, this is considered  perfectly normal.

Like you expected to be addressed in a decent manner, every one want  the
same. Our disagreements can be better worded so that in a public forum - no
one  is *embarrassed.*
**
*BTW. I don't remember hurting any one's  sentiment or using extreme words
with any civilized people. I would be grateful if any one of you can forward
me such mails to correct my 'wordings'.*
**
*Also, when I criticize some one, I remember expressing my  displeasure in a
polite way. *
**
*It is extremely difficult to practice &amp; preach the same thing for an
average person. But this is certainly  desirable.*
**
*However, irresepctive of what we practice ourself, in  a public forum  an
exreme or violent person also should be using  gentleman's language..*

thanks
Manoj Padhi
