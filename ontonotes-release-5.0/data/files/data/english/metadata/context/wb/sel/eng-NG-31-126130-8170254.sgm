Original singer will join rock supergroup for 50 U.S. dates

Updated: 7:16 a.m. PT Aug 7, 2007
NASHVILLE - Van Halen will announce a 50-date American reunion tour with
original singer David Lee Roth during a news conference in Hollywood next
week, sources said.

The arena trek will begin in early October.

Roth, who split from the rock group in the mid-1980s in hopes of solo
stardom, will reunite with co-founders Eddie Van Halen on guitar and brother
Alex Van Halen on drums. Eddie's teenage son Wolfgang will sub for Michael
Anthony on bass.

A proposed summer amphitheater tour by the group never got off the ground,
with Eddie Van Halen entering a rehabilitation facility for undisclosed
reasons in March.

In the months since, the guitarist has been seen publicly looking healthy
and fit.

Van Halen last toured in 2004, with Roth's replacement, vocalist Sammy
Hagar, grossing nearly $40 million, according to Billboard Boxscore.

The question is not whether they will tour. The question is...Will it
be good?

Unlikely.

You notice a pattern here ?   How many groups that said they will
never reunite are now reuniting.   It all started with the Eagles, the
biggest money grabbers of all.   Now you have the Police, Genesis...
Squeeze  amd now Van Halen with David Lee.   All of these tours are
money grabs.

Sting said in the mid 90s that he is glad they had never done some  &quot;
Sad reunion  because vast amounts of money were thrown at us&quot;  Guess
he had a change of heart.   Phil Collins &quot;retired from touring&quot; 3 or 4

At this point in Bruce's career.... that is the only way he is going
to make the huge money.  But I think he enjoys doing it.   I don't
believe the members of the Police and Genesis or the Eagles genuinely
still like each other.

The difference, IMHO, is that Springsteen in 1999 was still putting out new,
and perhaps &quot;important&quot; music.  Further, Springsteen reinterprets his
earlier work each time he plays it.  He gives it new colorations, meanings,
possibilities.  The other bands you mention rehash their old hits, and
usually those songs haven't aged well.

People who love Shakespeare can watch fifty different productions of Hamlet
and be enthused with each new interpretation.  I think the same enthusiasm
is felt by Springsteen fans with each new variation of, say, Born To Run, or
Racing in the Street.  Could that be said for Hotel California, or even
Proud Mary?  I don't think so.  Could you watch an episode of Seinfeld fifty
times without getting bored with it?

Springsteen, and Shakespeare, reach into us unlike nearly any other artist.
The complexity of their art makes it worth going back to again, and again,
and again.

I don't think you can say in 1999 Springsteen was putting out new
material, he was touring to promote a collection of songs that were
outtakes or didn't make the album (most of which was familiar to
fans).  The only new material he was doing was LOHAD

I've watched that episode of Seinfeld where Jerry, George, Elaine, and
Kramer give The Drake a a big screen TV for a wedding gift about 50
times. I still laugh.

Also, any episode with Lloyd Braun and Puddy I could watch 50 times
and still laugh.

That show is total hilarity similar to The Three Stooges, The Little
Rascals, and the Honeymooners. You can watch them endlessly and they
are still funny.

But, I get your point otherwise.

I don't think I could hear Matamoros Banks 50 times, or I would
probably eat my glock.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Besides, what makes those tours &quot;money grabs&quot; and not the big reunion
&gt;&gt; &gt; of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Big Band?

&gt;&gt; The difference, IMHO, is that Springsteen in 1999 was still putting out new,
&gt;&gt; and perhaps &quot;important&quot; music.

&gt;I don't think you can say in 1999 Springsteen was putting out new
&gt;material, he was touring to promote a collection of songs that were
&gt;outtakes or didn't make the album (most of which was familiar to
&gt;fans).  The only new material he was doing was LOHAD
">

It's even a big stretch to suggest he was touring to promote Tracks.

True, but didn't the Springsteen org at least try to connect the tour with
the Tracks release, at least initially?

&gt; At this point in Bruce's career.... that is the only way he is going
&gt; to make the huge money.  But I think he enjoys doing it.   I don't
&gt; believe the members of the Police and Genesis or the Eagles genuinely
&gt; still like each other.

I've never heard the members of Genesis say a bad word about each
other, including Peter Gabriel.  The members of the Police famously
hated each other back in the day.  They probably like each other more
now than before they broke up.  I just think they had had enough of
what they were doing then, and after a while missed it.

If Bruce cared that much about huge money, he would never have broken
up the E Street Band in the first place.  He's happy enough to keep
them in his back pocket for whenever he wants them.  Exactly the same.

I remember hearing how during the Amensty tour Sting told Bruce the
way to really make money was to get rid of the E Street band (who were
highly paid), and replace them with a bunch of hungry young musicians
if you really wanted to make money.

Not sure how true it was but it is what Sting did with the Police
(where he was sharing the profits 3 ways) and what Bruce after the
tour (firing the E Street band and touring with the 92/93 band)

Of course the formula made Sting a ton of money, but didn't really
work for Bruce.

The story can't be true.  Sting was getting all of the songwriting
royalties for the Police anyway, as does Bruce, so they have more
sources of income than the rest of the band(s).

No, the issue with the Police was control, as it usually is (see Simon
&amp; Garfunkel and The Who).  Sting/Simon/Townshend wanted to do
everything his way, without needing to accept the input of Copeland/
Summers/Garfunkel/Daltrey on what were solo compositions anyway.

Bruce is already The Boss of the band, and everything already goes his
way.  His way, after 1982-4, was to limit the Sturm und Drang of the
band on his music.
