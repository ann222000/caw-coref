The quarry question: How pathetic are we?

RALPH SURETTE

NOW THAT a review panel has given scientific approval to the obvious -
that a huge quarry on Digby Neck, meant to supply American cities with
gravel, should not proceed because of its potential for environmental
destruction and social and economic disruption - only one niggling
question remains: How dead is it?

The panel's recommendation has no binding force over the government.
Environment Minister Mark Parent has announced that he's going to mull
it over.

The quarry company, Bilcon, seems intent on looking for some wiggle
room and continuing the lobbying, while its local allies are
organizing a pro-quarry rally.

Let's put it this way: If, after such a clear and crushing judgment by
a duly constituted federal-provincial review panel (not to mention the
overwhelming public opposition), the unlikely decision is still to go
ahead, it should be a hanging offence. That is, the opposition parties
should be prepared to bring the minority government down and force an
election.

That's not just because of the quarry, as such, but also because of
the broader issues attached. In nixing the quarry, the panel, led by
Dalhousie oceanographer Robert Fournier, has also called on the
province to create a plan for coastal development.

There are other disputes ongoing over developers bulldozing coastal
areas, plus the issue of the seas rising. Nova Scotia is nothing if
not a coastal zone, and it can no longer be hacked at with impunity.

Plus there's the recommendation for a moratorium on new development
proposals on the North Mountain range until a proper plan is drawn up.
The Digby quarry was seen by opponents as merely the start of the
assault on the range's basalt deposits right through to Wolfville.

Last summer, there was a proposal for a 3.9-hectare quarry (under four
hectares, there's no requirement for an environmental assessment) back
of Upper Granville that has caused consternation.

The time has come to select the proper places for such operations,
rather than let operators dig anywhere under cover of slack
regulations.

For the MacDonald government, which has taken to bragging up its
environmental prowess, to kneecap these recommendations by allowing
the Digby quarry should be to invite a kneecapping of its own.

To recap the essentials of what was proposed on Digby Neck: a roughly
300-acre, or 150-hectare, mega-quarry in the heart of fishing and
tourism country, that would go day and night for 50 years, blasting
away with the force of as much as 25,000 kilograms of explosives per
shot, and lugging away two million tonnes per year, or 40,000 tonnes a
week, of basalt rock through a new marine terminal. It would create a
couple dozen jobs - or, as someone put it, &quot;about half as many as at
the Digby Superstore.&quot;

The reason for the insistence is that gravel is a more and more
valuable commodity and harder and harder to get. You can't just gouge
out coastlines in New England, so the idea was to move north where the
population and politicians are more pliable. The fact that it has
taken five years to get to this point, instead of the idea being
quashed immediately, is proof of the still-vulnerable backwardness of
our politics.

Plus, another thing developers can count on is the indifference of
city dwellers to having the countryside gouged out for no good reason.
I doubt that most Haligonians could really grasp what's at stake here
unless they woke up one morning to find out that someone got a permit
to dig up Point Pleasant Park.

Let us presume the Digby quarry is dead. If so, we've crossed a
barrier where, thanks to the aroused citizens of Digby Neck, we no
longer cave in automatically to any damn thing, as long as it's
proposed by a big foreign corporation.

But if it's still seen to be wiggling at all, the real question will
be: How pathetic are we?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the industry point of view, there's another question: If gravel
">

is increasingly scarce, but is needed along the East Coast of North
America, where is it going to come from?

The same issue is alive in B.C., which is increasingly the source of
sand and gravel for the U.S. West Coast. This summer, a big quarry was
given the go-ahead in a sparsely populated area up the coast,
following an agreement between the operators and the local First
Nations band. There was no opposition.

The equivalent of an acceptable area along the East Coast for a large
export quarry would be the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in
Quebec or the south coast of Newfoundland. And if sand and gravel are
getting more valuable, more distant and more expensive, then perhaps
the message is the same as for oil, gas and other valuable
commodities, the extraction and use of which damage the environment:
The time has come to use less and to use it smarter.
