Jim Crow? I'm afraid I don't see the connection with this 19th century
symbol of segregation and, ultimately, &quot;separate but equal&quot; philosophy.

&quot;Uppity&quot;? LOL!

Is it beyond your comprehension that the thrifts are
FREE to run their businesses ANY DAMN WAY THEY WANT TO?
Who the hell has the gall to call anyone in this,
the land of the free, &quot;uppity&quot;?

&quot;Yesss, Mam, I'se'll be takin' jes any ole junk, jus

&quot;I LIVES to serves you, Mam. I ain't foe-gettin my place.
I will takes yo' junk, no kwerstions axed!&quot;

I think we kicked out the royals quite a while back.
Or perhaps this comes from a neighbor to the south,
in Mexico; one who is used to the peon system.

SO sorry you have been inconvenienced!
But let me tell you something:
If they ain't free, then you ain't free.
Pick. Which way do you want it to be?

low enough to move out the door or it's in their dumpster. Either way,
it's gone. I've just about stopped going to the non-profits. I'm tired

these venues; your hair and makeup had better be perfect and your size

that have been sitting on the shelves for five years (no joke) with
nary a sale or discount offered. Tired of going into the Goodwill
Boutique and seeing the only desirable objects priced at 10x their
market value. Oh, and forget buying any purely decorative objects
in these stores. The management has slapped a Not For Sale sticker on
any lovely old trays or mirrors. Gotta make the place look like a
Real Antique Store, you know.

Kris,
One suggestion I have would be to check some local churchs to see if they have
their own privately ran christmas charity drive. If so, they would have the
names of local people who might be thrilled to get those appliances, and the
volunteers to move them. My mom ran one in our church for many years, did
amazing things with very little overhead. For example, one year someone had
cleaned out their basement, and asked my mom if she would be interested in four
used bikes. Sure, she said, and got on the phone with a church member who
owned a bike shop. He was quite happy to refurbish the bikes with new chains
and tires, and make sure there were in good condition. She then called four
recipient families, and asked if they would like a bicycle in addition to the
christmas presents they requested. Boy, would they. Never dreamed someone
would just call and offer their kids a bike.
It's probably best to find a small program ran by an individual, rather then a
big, national program with all kinds of rules and regulations. Don't know much
about the churches in your area - but its worth a shot.

&gt;Hi Charleen

&gt;Could you explain the differences between the for-profit and
&gt;not-for-profit thrift shops. (Who they benefit and how the profit
&gt;system works?...who shops there...type of items for sale? etc etc) I
&gt;didn't understand Kris' comment &quot;And we wondered just who these thrift
&gt;stores were serving, as the prices were so high that it would be
&gt;better for the poor toshop at discount stores.&quot;... because everyone
&gt;shops at them here.

"/> And well you should...I bought a lot of stuff at thrift shops (in particular,
one thrift in Hammersmith) the last time I was over there. There was
most of a set of Johnson Brothers Indian Tree, including a coffee set; I
think I paid pounds sterling 29.99 for it. Over here Goodwill Industries
would slap a $200 pricetag on it. I got a marvelous made in Shanghai
wooden jewelry box lined in silk, 5.00.

The for-profit shops get their merchandise a couple of different ways.
Most commonly they buy truckloads of donated merchandise from a charitable
organization that picks it up at your house. They also get seconds and
overruns from manufacturers, though I don't see this as much. While there
is a charity component to the operation, the shops themselves are run for
profit. I don't know that they turn away anything, since I see everything
from major appliances to Commodore 64s to really tacky sofa-size paintings
to plastic digital watches there.

The not-for-profit shops get direct donations and these days, that means
lugging it down to their shop, where they may or may not accept it. The
American Cancer Society Discovery Shops turn away a lot of donations;
they'll tell people to take it to the Salvation Army, who isn't so particular.
The days of calling Goodwill to have them bring a truck around to pick
up your &quot;useable discards&quot; (as they used to call them) are long gone.
The not-for-profits are tied to a specific cause or organization.

I've shopped all these stores and I can tell you that the for-profit stores
are where the poor shop. Seems strange, eh? The other odd realization is
that for me at least, there tend to be more of the things I'm looking for
in the for-profit stores. There was for many years a local rumor that
the &quot;good stuff&quot; was disappearing out the back door at Goodwill before it
ever hit the selling floor. This was confirmed a few years ago when police
charged a group of sisters, each of whom managed a Goodwill store, for
appropriating merchandise, selling to antique dealers and pocketing the
proceeds. Another manager, not related, commited suicide and when the
police opened up her storage unit, they found over 50 barrels of goods taken
from Goodwill donations.

One last point, then I'll quiet down.

I guess what annoys me about upscale not-for-profits is not just that they've
priced themselves away from their constituency (though they have), it's the
inherent assumption that if they glam the place up and slap high prices on
everything, well-off people will shop there and buy, buy, buy. I may be
moderately well-off but I'm not stupid, fer chrissakes. Better, in my view,
to keep acquisition and philanthropy separate. I donate directly to the
causes I endorse and I try to be unemotional about buying things for resale.
YMMV.

There are too many names to list, but I am heartened by the
public (and email) responses to my &quot;uppity thrift-stores&quot;
dilemma.

I've gained so many good ideas, that I should be able to get
the two appliances into the hands of someone who can use
them - and do so quickly. I really don't want money for
them. I just know that they are too good to discard.

Thanks, folks! Sometimes, in the midst of a dilemma (and
a torn-up house that addles ones brain), additional ideas
are needed.

Kris

PS: Many have emailed me with support regarding the
public bashing which my post gained. One member here
told me that it appears that the basher was laying in wait for
me to return, and quickly pounced on one of my first postings -
and suggested that this was getting pretty close to stalking.

P.S. Did you know that clothes shipped to Africa by Salvation Army cannot
enter (some countries) unless duty is paid? So generally big bundles of
clothing are purchased by &quot;entreprenuers&quot; who then set up in the market place
and sell them. Kind of fun to see all those slogan tee's walking around.

&gt; YMMV.

"/> I'd say there are at least four categories, though none are
well-defined.

(1) Non-profit thrifts whose charitable purpose is aiding the poor (St.
Vincent de Paul, Salvation Army). These usually have reasonable prices,
except sometimes on antiques/collectibles, and their primary market is
poor folks.

(2) Non-profit thrifts whose charitable purpose is something else
(AIDS, blind, handicapped, cancer, etc.) than serving the poor. They
are more likely to have higher prices and upscale attitudes; after all,
their purpose is raising maximum money for, say, cancer research, not
providing cheap clothes for the needy.

(3) For-profit thrifts associated with charities (e.g. Savers). The
company that runs the thrift is a business, but a charity gets a cut.
The business aspect means maximizing profit will be the primary goal.

(4) Purely for-profit thrifts, or second-hand stores. Same sort
of folks who do flea markets; they just pay rent on a storefront.

Now...back to the original questions....

(1) While only category 1 has an institutional obligation to sell stuff
cheap to serve its constituency, why should even category 1 sell
antiques or collectibles any more cheaply than an antique shop *if*
there is a market that will pay full retail there. Is it better to
price the majolica soup tureen at $5.00 so the poor can buy it, or sell
if for $500 and buy food for the soup kitchen? So, when they know what
they're dealing with, these thrifts generally price warm coats and
everyday china cheap, and colectibles expensive. (So far as I know,
none of these charities has as its stated purpose providing for starving
antique dealers; perhaps we should start one.)

(2) Same deal applies to donations of large appliances. If the
thrift's primary mission isn't serving poor peoople (who need cheap
appliances), it may be that stocking appliances is not cost-effective.
If they don't sell, many cities charge to haul them away. So a thrift
can lose money on a donated appliance.

&gt;=====

"/> Well....as the person who seemed to have touched this one
off, I have to mention another fact: in ALL of the thrift stores
in my area, there's a collectibles area. In bookcases behind
the desk, there's lots of price guides. ALL items are marked
&quot;by the book&quot;&lt;grin&gt;...and if they can't find an item in the book,
well....they pick the closest price or auction it off via written
bids.

The chances of finding anything at 10x under any realistic
price are &quot;once a month.&quot; Do I tell them when I've found
a bargain? Nope. Is that fair? I think so. I take in weekly
loads of donations. These places know who I am, because
I am a good donor - and many of the items that have come
from my family have ended up in the high-priced and/or bid
sections of the stores. They've made way way more money
from my donations, than I've made from any &quot;find.&quot; A 1980s
cheapo-type broken doll that my daughter had received as a
Christmas present was auctioned for $52 two weeks ago.

Last Saturday night, we spent $64.09 at one of these places.
&quot;Finds?&quot; Nope. Just three &quot;blind&quot; boxes of Matchbox cars
that we could not open and inspect. Will I make money on
these? After getting home and checking my purchase, I've
decided that I'll lose money. But that's OK - I took the chance.

Here's something I find really hilarious about one chain:
Books are 3/$1 - unless they are religious books. Then, you
pay $1-$3. They sell Book of Mormon copies for $2 - the same
ones you get for free if you respond to the TV/magazine ads.

Who are these places supporting? The regular shopper - NOT
the needy, in most cases. How can they support the needy when
they're building million-dollar buildings/warehouses constantly?

I know that a lot of things are shipped to a central warehouse in
Salt Lake City - and distributed to stores across the Western US.
I've seen the lid to a cookie jar in one store in SLC, and the base
in another. Individually marked higher than the intact item
would sell for realistically.

I have to tell this weeks story about the Cancer Society Ladies. See, my shop shares a
building with a Cancer Society Shop, we are on one end and our poor Landlord has an
insurance office in between. Now, don't get me wrong, I love these Ladies...but they
are all volunteers and all pretty set in their ways. So we have many stories on them.
But this week our Landlord came over and was asking about our water usage (He pays the
bill). Had it gone up for any reason? No, we said. Why? Well the water bill at the
Cancer Society was many times what ours was and he couldn't figure it out.
Well... it turns out that they were leaving the faucet on...all the time. See, they
all have arthritis and so never shut the faucet off all the way.
I really do love the Ladies. :-) Tina

"/> Which reminds me of my all-time best find...

About seven years ago, I attended an estate sale with the usual boxes of
pocket-size paperbacks priced 50 cents each. I picked out a few,
including a copy of &quot;Stride Toward Freedom&quot; by Martin Luther King, Jr.

When I got home (and started pencilling in my prices; I owned a new/used
bookstore in those days), I noticed that it was autographed. I had no
idea how to price that one (I was guessing $50), so I just hung onto it
until last summer.

Last summer I solicited offers from autograph dealers who
advertized in Antique Trader. (Offers ranged from $200 to
$800.) The highest offer came from a dealer who also operates an
auction-by-mail company specializing in autographs; while he was
willing to buy it outright, he recommended that I consign it to him
instead. It sold for $1100; I netted over $900 after paying the
auctioneer's fee.

"/> Books are 3/$1? Hey, I'm on my way!--- the Salvation Army near me sells them
for $3 each-- with nicer ones priced higher. Of course the irony is the older
books-- unless they're 19th century-- get tossed out to make room for the nice
NEW best seller and last years diet books.

Actually the higher book prices work for me. They keep me from buying the
cheap stuff I don't really have time to handle. It's just really difficult
for me to pass up a book for $1 when I can sell it for $20. What I should be
doing is buying from another dealer for $20 and selling for $100. Anybody else
happy to see higher prices? I LOVE estate sales where the books are priced at
$5 or over. That way you have to know what you're buying.

awhile, they were pricing them at $1-$5 each (based on &quot;age&quot;)
but nothing sold and they were soon awash in books. Of
course, at ANY price, the good ones fly out quickly. What's
left is....well....you know.

&gt;the Salvation Army near me sells them for $3 each-- with nicer ones
&gt;priced higher. Of course the irony is the older books-- unless
&gt;they're 19th century-- get tossed out to make room for the nice
&gt;NEW best seller and last years diet books.

neatly on the shelves are in full abundance. Right?

&gt;Actually the higher book prices work for me. They keep me from
&gt;buying the cheap stuff I don't really have time to handle. It's
&gt;just really difficult for me to pass up a book for $1 when I can sell
&gt;it for $20. What I should be doing is buying from another dealer
&gt;for $20 and selling for $100.

"/>  Depends how quickly the $20 books sell versus turning over
the higher-priced book. Your $19 profit on a $1 book looks
pretty good when multiplied, versus 10% of same sales giving
you an $80 profit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Anybody else happy to see higher prices? I LOVE estate sales
&gt;where the books are priced at $5 or over. That way you have to
&gt;know what you're buying.

"/>  I'm a sucker for books, no matter how they're priced - but the
estate sales around here seem to discard anything but old,
reader-quality reprints by familiarly-named authors.

This very day i have spent several dusty, musty hours in 2 Antique
Malls going through boxes and shelves of old books. I am always
looking for books by Elizabeth and the holy grail, an Oz book that has
slipped in undetected. I didn't find either of those but did find (for
$3.00) a great book of knitting patterns with several great afghans.
something to keep me busy for the winter if we ever get one!!

maryann in SC where it is in the high 70's today!!
