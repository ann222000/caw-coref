U.S. Supreme Court Fortifies The Savage Inequalities

What Happened to a Positive Example of Desegregated Schools?
In an article titled &quot;Overcoming Apartheid,&quot; Jonathan Kozol pointed to
a school desegregation plan that actually seemed to be achieving some
results, creating the least segregated school system in the country.

Kozol noted support for this integration plan from &quot;the teachers
union, the local press, the Jefferson County Human Relations
Commission and the regional branch of the National Conference of
Christians and Jews.&quot; And Kozol reported that &quot;A survey revealed that
the number of black parents who believed their children's education
had improved under the busing plan exceeded those who took the
opposite position by a ratio of six to one. Less than 2 percent
believed that education for their children would be better in
resegregated schools.&quot;

That school desegregation plan was the one in Louisville-one of the
desegregation programs that the Supreme Court banned!

On June 28, by a 5-4 majority, the Supreme Court-headed by the Bush-
appointed Chief Justice John Roberts-struck down school admission
policies in Seattle and Louisville that used students' race as a
factor to maintain diversity in individual schools.

Make no mistake about it: this ruling is a savage attack on the rights
of Black people in this country. It signals an official turning back
from even a pretense of a commitment to end white supremacy in the
public schools, and it virtually removes the ability of people to use
the courts to do that. And it will lend strength to every racist and
reactionary in this country, sending a signal of approval from the
highest court of the land.

What They Are Reversing

To understand why and how this is so, we need to look at the ruling
that was overturned in all but name: Brown vs. Board of Education. In
1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown that overtly, openly
segregated school districts were illegal. Prior to that point,
American schools were, especially but not only in the South,
segregated by law and by lynch mobs. Black people were forced by law
into substandard and dehumanizing schools. And this kind of state-
enforced segregation, the Supreme Court had declared in an earlier
1896 decision, was consistent with the U.S. Constitution.

Brown reversed all this. By a 9-0 margin the Supreme Court now held
that attempts to label segregated education as &quot;separate but equal&quot;
were fraudulent and violated the Constitution. And it called for the
schools to be integrated &quot;with all deliberate speed.&quot; This decision
was a result of pressure from below, especially the anger of
increasingly urbanized Black people in the cities of the North and
South. And it was an attempt to improve the image of the United States
around the world at a time when U.S. imperialism was sinking its claws
into Asia, Africa, and Latin America and trying to sell itself as the
beacon of freedom and democracy.

Brown vs. Board of Education set off massive changes in the United
States. People around the country (and around the world) watched as
courageous Black students defied howling mobs, racist politicians, and
vicious police who sought to bar their entry into schools. But it
quickly became clear that simply ending the &quot;separate but equal&quot;
standard in education would not bring about any real changes. White
supremacy was too deeply embedded in every aspect of American society.
So struggle continued to rage, and in some places the courts ordered
plans that would take into account and attempt to overcome segregated
housing patterns, unequal taxation, etc.  Even though these
concessions always fell far short of what was needed, they still had
significance. The movie Remember the Titans gives a sense both of how
fiercely such plans were resisted-and how, once the schools were
desegregated, it both opened up opportunities for Black students and
also enabled some of the whites to begin to overcome the racist and
white supremacist attitudes they had been brought up with.

But all this ran up smack up against just how deeply white supremacy
is embedded in society. Despite two decades of courageous struggle,
where many gave their lives, only a dent was made in the societal
patterns of school segregation. By the 1970s, the system had unleashed
the &quot;backlash.&quot; Politicians and media fanned and promoted deep-seated
views among white people that their economic and social problems were
the fault not of the system and those who control society, but of
people even more oppressed and exploited than themselves.

For the past 30 years or so, what gains were made in the struggle to
integrate schools, and society as a whole, have been under attack-
often in the form of claims that whatever small progress was made in
remedying still-overwhelming and pervasive segregation constitutes
&quot;reverse discrimination.&quot; But through all that, it was still accepted
law that the courts had to attempt to remedy discrimination,
segregation, and inequality.

Now, in its June 28 ruling, this Supreme Court has slammed and all but
locked the door on any efforts to challenge school segregation through
the courts.

Think about it. What does that decision, and the whole history that
underlies it, say about the depths of the white supremacy that
permeates every fiber of America? And what does it say about the
determination of the highest court in the land, and the government
more generally, to now fortify all that?

What kind of a statement is this about the kind of future this system
has for Black people and other oppressed peoples? What does it say
about the kind of society this is, and is becoming more starkly every
day?

The Supreme Court Ruling

The Louisville plan overturned by the Supreme Court required each
school to have a minimum Black student enrollment of 15 percent and a
maximum of 50 percent. In Seattle, the plan used the students'
nationality as a &quot;tie breaker&quot; for admissions into schools where more
students applied than there were slots, in order to keep the schools
from deviating more than 10 percent from the overall balance of whites
and nonwhite students in the school district.

Both the Seattle and Louisville programs had been upheld by lower
federal courts. And they are similar to plans in place in school
districts around the country-which are now deemed unlawful under the
Supreme Court ruling. An attorney for the right-wing Pacific Legal
Foundation--which was involved in the suit against the Seattle program
and has similar suits against school districts in Los Angeles and
Berkeley-crowed that the Court decision could affect 1,000 school
districts.

By declaring that school districts now cannot use race as a factor in
desegregation plans (when any such plan by definition would have to
rely on &quot;racial criteria&quot; to have any meaning), this Supreme Court
ruling is slamming the door on even the most modest integration plans.

As for the little ray of hope supposedly held out because one justice,
Anthony Kennedy, wrote a separate opinion holding the door open for
some even more limited desegregation plans, that was little more than
a fig-leaf to cover over the real nature of what is going down. As
Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote, &quot;Let's not grasp at
straws here. While Kennedy kept the court from definitively shutting
the door on school integration, it's clear what direction we're
headed.&quot;

The Hypocrisy and Cynicism of Invoking the &quot;Colorblind&quot; Standard

In an act of obscene hypocrisy and heartless cynicism, Chief Justice
Roberts wrote that &quot;the way to stop discrimination on the basis of
race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race&quot; and school
desegregation went against a &quot;colorblind&quot; Constitution.

This invocation of &quot;colorblind&quot; is hypocritical because race affects
everything in this society, cutting across economic lines, and
impacting everything from what happens when your car is pulled over by
the police to what kind of medical care you get, to where you can
live. If you &quot;don't take race into account&quot; in assigning schools, kids
will go to school where they live. And where they live is very much
dependent on their nationality.

Postwar America was profoundly stamped by government policies that
subsidized loans for whites to move to the suburbs, and prohibited
loans for people to move into integrated communities. An article in
the New York Times noted that &quot;The initial leases in Levittown [New
York], America's pioneering post-World War II suburb, announced in
bold capital letters that its homes were not to be 'used or occupied
by any person other than members of the Caucasian race.'&quot; (&quot;Study
Calls L.I. Most Segregated Suburb,&quot; NYT, 6/5/07).

And these conditions continue today, even if in slightly (slightly!)
covered-over forms. In the same New York Times article, commenting on
discrimination in housing on Long Island, New York, today, Andrew
Beveridge, a Queens College sociologist, told the New York Times that
''It's almost like a township in the South African sense.&quot;

So &quot;colorblind&quot; schools are, in reality, profoundly segregated
schools. You can say that white and Black students all must meet the
same criteria to get into an elite magnet high school. But when one
student comes from an inner city prison-like &quot;school&quot; without
computers, a library, a debate club or a cadre of parent activists
with time and money to donate materials and volunteer resources, then
the application of &quot;equal&quot; criteria reproduces and re-enforces
segregation.

African-American constitutional scholar and NYU law professor Derrick
Bell told Revolution, &quot;It is quite easy to design policies that
discriminate without mentioning race, such as standardized SAT and
LSAT tests and legacy admission policies.&quot;

Bell added, &quot;Most black and Latino children reside in large, urban
districts where the assignment procedures struck down in the Seattle-
Louisville case would have little meaning.&quot; But now even the limited
relevance of plans like those of Louisville and
