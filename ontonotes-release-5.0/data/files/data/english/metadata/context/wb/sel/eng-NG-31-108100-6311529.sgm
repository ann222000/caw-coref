Hello Group, You have always been there in the past so here goes and
thank you in advance.  Plus you get to help spend somebody else's
money J

I am looking for a new truck as part one of my diabolical plans to own
a 25-foot Air stream.

Here are my criteria: Be able to pull 8 to 10K and more importantly;
control it in all weather, cross-country over any paved terrain or
mountain pass. There are two major categorires1/2 ton Gas or 3/4 ton
Diesel.

The following half tons would work; the New Toyota (2007) which has a
two capacity of 10.2K towing capacity and big fat brakes. It is a very
nice truck. It's opponent is the new style 2007 Chevrolet 1500
Silverado with the Max Tow package and the with he 6.0 Vortec Max.

In the 3/4 ton group, the Dodge 2500 Diesel versus the 2500 Chevy
Duramax. Here is the rub: Ford, Dodge and Chevy are all producing
cleaner diesel engines. I prefer the new Diesel engine, I suspect they
will be cleaner than earlier versions I don't like thought of the
first in a model year but who knows. (I took the 08 Ford out yesterday
and was not impressed enough to get by last years recalls)

As an aside, it has been a very long time since I shopped for a new
vehicle and I am pretty disappointed in the all the car dealers. I
don't think they realize this new thing is out there called the
Internet. You can look stuff up.

Every Chevy dealer starts out: "Oh, the 6.0 Vortec is hard to find. I
always lose faith when that is there first statement. They warn you
ahead of time that you wont get what you want and then drive hard to
the hoop to sell you whatever they have. The Dodge Dealer made a point
of telling me how much more expensive the new cleaner engines will be
so I better buy now! I have a car dealer hangover.

Any thoughts from the group on which way to go? Especially from the
Environmental point of view.

Thanks,

John

How many miles a year are you going to tow?  The 1/2 ton would be a bad
choice IMO.  You are towing a trailer at the limit of the tow vehicle.  An
8k trailer and a 10.5K rating on the Tundra and then you add some stuff to
the trailer.  You will be hurting in the mountains.  I have a 2004 Duramax
crewcab and tow a 4500# boat with a slide in camper in the truck.  I average
about 14.5 mpg with this rig.

You can never have too much truck, but you could very easily have too
little.  If you are buying a TOW truck, don't even consider a half ton
truck.

I drive a 2005 F-450 Crew Cab XLT Lariat 4X4 6.0 Liter Power Stroke Diesel 6
speed manual transmission 4.30/1 limited slip rear.  Nearly twice the square
inches of brake surface as the F-350, and the damn near twice as big of
axels. rated to carry a maximum payload of 8,600 Pounds with a GCWR gross
combined weight rating 26,000 Pounds.

As to the recalls, I have had zero issues, not allowed any Ford computer
reflashes and get 16.5 MPG on the highway while not towing, and between a
low of 10.5 and up to 14.5 while towing depending on many things.  This
truck weighs 10,000 pounds empty.  Ford is by no means the only manufacture
with design/manufacture/production problems, if you missed the list of Chevy
Duramax/Allison recalls and service bulletins I posted for Lon when he asked
for a list, just ask and I will post it again.

As to dealing with dealers, you have to keep your selection process
separated from your buying process.  (Unless you have a good working
relationship with a dealership, from your post it does not seem you do)  Go
shop, test drive, and make it clear you are NOT buying today.  When you have
decided which truck with which options you are going to buy, then go into
the dealership and ask for the Sales Manager or General Manager by name
(call in advance and inquire their names, or walk in through the parts
department and ask the guy at the parts counter for their names).  Tell them
which truck you want to buy from them and how you want it configured.  Start
your negotiations at INVOICE pricing not MSRP.  I paid Invoice for my 2005
F-450 and received $3000 in incentives, effectively paying $3000 under
invoice price for a truck I ordered exactly how I wanted it.

Good Luck

The new clean burn Diesel engines should be lots BETTER engines, IMHO.
This supported by the DC announcement during the Detroit auto show that
the new Cummins engine will be 20% cleaner, and will get 30% better fuel
economy.

I expect the same from Chevy, as they are working very hard to SET the
pace for a change, and doing a damn fine job of it.

Don't listen to ANYTHING the salesman tells you. Visit 2 Chevy dealers.
Tell them EXACTLY what you want, what options you want on it, what color
you want, what color interior you want, then give them exactly ONE
CHANCE to come up with their best price.

Again, don't listen to ANYTHING they tell you. Do your homework before
you talk business with them. Then YOU DO THE TALKING. They can find the
truck you want through their locator system, or they can ORDER a truck
your way. You decide.

Know in advance what's a good price and what's NOT a good price for the
truck you want. Don't pay more than that. All of the BULLSHIT that comes
out of the salesman's mouth is designed to separate you from your money.

Diesels are plenty dirty especailly with NOx emissions which will
change in 08 with mandated requirements, not because they are being
nice but the 30% MPG improvement claim is pure BS but it is what the
public wants to hear so they say it because it helps sell them at high
dollar option costs. To suggest that if you got say 19 MPG solo and
now you could get up to almost 25MPG is nonsense. Also they did not
tell you that new CTD weighs about 130 lbs more too pushing engine
weight to around 1400lbs which is a lot of weight in the front of a
P/U anyway you cut it. Then there is Dodge refusal to offer front axle
discoonct on 4x4 modeld which means that front axle differental and
drive shaft is ALWAYS turning robbing potentail MPG. Dodge was also
"kind" enough to use a bastard hub design that require a aftermarket
kit that costs about 2 grand (minus labor) to convert it to a free
wheeling axle in 2wd  that does not spin differentail and drive shaft.
This design of their lets them save maybe 100 bucks per truck or about
.25% on a 40K truck and costs you far more in extra fuel during life
of vehicle. They do not tell you this though anywhere is sales hype
for it  and the said part is for a few extra buck they could have done
it right but they hope to win you over with bells and whistles and not
look at the shortcomings of the overall design. Ford still disengages
complete axle on SD trucks and GM disconnects differentail in 2wd on
all their 4x4 models. Dodge does it on none of their current models
big or small.

Thanks Lon,

What gets tiring for me is I know they are trained to tag team, triple
talk, hoodwink. I tell them I know, they know I know, everybody in 50
miles knows I know what they know... and they do it anyway.

A long time ago, when you could smoke cigarettes at work I leased a
vehicle. I was 23 years old and not that bright. The salesman lite up
a cigarette when we were finished. My friend Ed pointed out that he
looked like he just had sex.

Thanks for your great guidance.

I own, and live in, a 25' Airstream.

I pull it with an F-250 diesel Ford Superduty.

I tried pulling it once with a 1/2 ton GMC Suburban.

That's when I bought the 3/4 ton.

I would ever try to pull this trailer with a 1/2 ton again.

It appears as though you have received a lot of good information, some I
did not know about as well.
As you can see my signature statement outlining what I have in my rig.
Mistakes are made by all of us at times even if Lon and Will do not
think they do. &lt;G&gt;\
My mistake is not getting the 4X4 like Hunter did. The diesel engine, as
has already been mentioned,
is quite a bit heavier than the gas ones. I have already experienced the
inability in having adequate traction
to push the front end of the vehicle without weight over the rear axles.
Another thing to consider is the ability for the Dodge 48RE auto
transmission to hold an exhaust brake.
They wouldn't at the time I made my purchase. Haven't towed in the
mountains and do not have any plans
of doing so, yet, but admittedly that might be a limitation I will have
to face when the time comes. But I trade out trucks quite often when I
am relying on them to move my home around the country.
Classification of pickups on the later models, (somewhere in the 60s, I
think) we refer to them as 1500, 2500 &amp; 3500.
Of course any smarter than average bear, knows what you are referring
to. Then we have those that likes to degrade
some of the other folks, surprised no one has said any thing yet. Rest
assured when the threads interest gets thin you will hear from them.
I watch these type subjects close as they help me when time come to
trade up to a new vehicle. So far I have
not changed my judgment of the Dodge. The turning radius alone is one of
the big advantages, don't know if it will hold true with the 4X4 models.
The Cumins engine develops it's power at a much lower rpm, allowing you
to start moving a load immediately, rather waiting on the rpm to develop.
The PSD &amp;  Duromax have not impressed me much yet , The New Toyota is
not is a diesel class so no need comparing it.

I think it is true what they say about salesmen. After all their job is
not to inform you on the technical aspects of a vehicle,
it is to sell you a vehicle. New things that has arrived after my last
purchase is the single rear wheel 3500 class in all three manufacturers.
Another new appearance is in a 3500 Ram dual wheel, lower sleeker
looking, just seen one, but I will investigate it. No way will I have a
dual wheel vehicle though. But if a sleek looking 3500, SRW vehicle
becomes available, that might be my next purchase, of course in 4X4 as well.

Let first start by getting an Airstream. Welcome to the club! (maybe a
little premature).

I have Classic 31. GVW 10,000 current weight around 8,000 lbs.
My truck of choice. 06 Ford F-250 SRW 4X4 Diesel runs pretty clean. Tows
up to 12,500. The F-150 tow up to 8,000 lbs.

I looked at the specs. The Heaviest 25' Safari is 7500 lbs.
The heaviest 25' Classic is 7600 lbs.
The heaviest 25' International is 7300 lbs.

The F-150 will do the job. However you have no reserve power or room for
growth.

I have 25% reserve towing capacity with my trailer at GVW. I currently
have 35% reserve at the trailers current weight.

My F-250 weighs around 7500 lbs currently loaded. Pretty close to the
weight of the trailer. The F-150 Weighs just over 5,000 lbs. Much less
than the fully loaded trailer.

Having the truck near the trailer weight means better control.

Go with the larger truck and the diesel. My preference as you could
guess. Ford. You will be happier with the larger truck in the end. Order
one if you have to.

Michelle Happy Ford and Airstream owner.

think) we refer to them as 1500, 2500 &amp; 3500.
Of course any smarter than average bear, knows what you are referring
to. Then we have those that likes to degrade
some of the other folks, surprised no one has said any thing yet. Rest
assured when the threads interest gets thin you will hear from them.
I watch these type subjects close as they help me when time come to
trade up to a new vehicle. So far I have
not changed my judgment of the Dodge. The turning radius alone is one of
the big advantages, don't know if it will hold true with the 4X4 models.
The Cumins engine develops it's power at a much lower rpm, allowing you
to start moving a load immediately, rather waiting on the rpm to develop.
The PSD &amp;  Duromax have not impressed me much yet , The New Toyota is
not is a diesel class so no need comparing it.

I think it is true what they say about salesmen. After all their job is
not to inform you on the technical aspects of a vehicle,
it is to sell you a vehicle. New things that has arrived after my last
purchase is the single rear wheel 3500 class in all three manufacturers.
Another new appearance is in a 3500 Ram dual wheel, lower sleeker
looking, just seen one, but I will investigate it. No way will I have a
dual wheel vehicle though. But if a sleek looking 3500, SRW vehicle
becomes available, that might be my next purchase, of course in 4X4 as
well.

An interesting thing now is the new transmission for the 6.0/4.10  gas in
Chevs.  Need to confirm, but I saw somewhere this boosts the former GCWR
from 16K to 18.5K.     It might cut into the cargo capacity as it is no
doubt heavier than the old transmission, but there is so much cargo capacity
in the 6.0 version compared with the D/A version, this should be a trivial
consideration.

The implications for this are very large for trailering.  It means the gap
between the D/A version (22K)  and the 6.0/4.10 is much less and they don't
need the 8.1 anymore.   You can do more of the popular size trailers now
with the 6.0 gas.

For instance our 2500HD with 6.0/4.10 is maxed on GCWR by a trailer 9,300lbs
actual wt, while neither the truck nor the trailer is up to its GVWR.  We
have to refrain from carrying any more junk in the trailer or the truck even
though we could using GVWR, because any more weight anywhere adds to the
GCW.    With a 2,500lb increase in the GCWR, we could load right up&lt;G&gt;

For 5er work, since we have lots of GVW we could increase to , we could
carry more pin wt than we do now and that would mean a heavier trailer than
we have now.  But with the higher GCWR we could pull what we can carry,
instead of being unable to pull as much as we can carry.

This puts the 2500HD D/A even farther behind the problem compared with the
6.0, since the D/A version cannot carry nearly as much as the 6.0 version,
and so cannot pull as heavy a 5er (even though it has the GCWR to do it)
without going way over its GVWR.

The 2500HD D/A is a really bad truck for 5er work because of this, and now
the 6.0 with the higher GCWR is even gaining on the D/A version's pulling
power.   You don't get a proper balance between pulling and carrying with
the D/A until you go to a 1 ton dually.  (the Chev 3500SRW has only a 469lb
gain in carrying capacity over a similar 2500HD)

There is also something interesting happening with the 1500HD with the
6.0/4.10 and the new transmission for a higher GCWR.  The cargo capacity hit
for the heavier transmission would show there more, as a higher proportion
of the original capacity, but this would not affect TT work like 5er work.
I don't know how the 1500HD would do with a TT for things like wheel base
ratios and all that, but with the higher GCWR it must surely catch the eye
of TT pullers to check it out.

It will be interesting to see how it all comes out once people catch on to
how this new transmission with the 6.0 gas will affect their calculations
trying to match trailer with truck.

Barry

The only thing I can add to this discussion is that I have NEVER heard

truck can be a real problem.

&gt;Hello Group, You have always been there in the past so here goes and
&gt;thank you in advance.  Plus you get to help spend somebody else's
&gt;money J

&gt;I am looking for a new truck as part one of my diabolical plans to own
&gt;a 25-foot Air stream.

&gt;Here are my criteria: Be able to pull 8 to 10K and more importantly;
&gt;control it in all weather, cross-country over any paved terrain or
&gt;mountain pass. There are two major categorires1/2 ton Gas or 3/4 ton
&gt;Diesel.

&gt;The following half tons would work; the New Toyota (2007) which has a
&gt;two capacity of 10.2K towing capacity and big fat brakes. It is a very
&gt;nice truck. It's opponent is the new style 2007 Chevrolet 1500
&gt;Silverado with the Max Tow package and the with he 6.0 Vortec Max.

&gt;In the 3/4 ton group, the Dodge 2500 Diesel versus the 2500 Chevy
&gt;Duramax. Here is the rub: Ford, Dodge and Chevy are all producing
&gt;cleaner diesel engines. I prefer the new Diesel engine, I suspect they
&gt;will be cleaner than earlier versions I don't like thought of the
&gt;first in a model year but who knows. (I took the 08 Ford out yesterday
&gt;and was not impressed enough to get by last years recalls)

&gt;As an aside, it has been a very long time since I shopped for a new
&gt;vehicle and I am pretty disappointed in the all the car dealers. I
&gt;don't think they realize this new thing is out there called the
&gt;Internet. You can look stuff up.

&gt;Every Chevy dealer starts out: &quot;Oh, the 6.0 Vortec is hard to find. I
&gt;always lose faith when that is there first statement. They warn you
&gt;ahead of time that you wont get what you want and then drive hard to
&gt;the hoop to sell you whatever they have. The Dodge Dealer made a point
&gt;of telling me how much more expensive the new cleaner engines will be
&gt;so I better buy now! I have a car dealer hangover.

&gt;Any thoughts from the group on which way to go? Especially from the
&gt;Environmental point of view.

&gt;Thanks,

&gt;John

1.  Go with the larger diesel truck.
2.  Put aside any predjudices.  This is a economic and business decision.
Yes Ford had problems with the 6.0 liter engine the first 6 months.  Since
then the engine has been solid.  I have a 2005 F350 with 60,000 miles,
half of it pulling 13,000 pounds.  It has been perfect.  Plus Ford has built
in trailer brakes.  I'm not say Ford it the best.  Ford, Chevy, &amp; Dodge all
have pluses and minuses.  Just be logical about the decision, not emotional.
3.  When talking with the dealer, just be sure that YOU are in charge of
the transaction.  Know what you want in a truck and what you are willing
to pay.  They can find you the truck that closest meet your demands.  If
they refuse to look beyond their lot, go to another dealer.  When I bought
my truck, I looked at the online inventory of dozens of dealers until I found
the truck that closest met my needs.

I would recommend *against* the 6.0L Chevy.  It can pull 7500#  just OK.
Anything more would be uncomfortable. BTDT.
The Toyota with the 5.7L (and 401 lbs of torque), a 4:10 rear end, would do
fine up to about 8500#.
But if there is any way you can go for a 3/4 ton, by all means do so.  It

The diesels, GM-Isuzu, Ford-Navistar, Dodge-Cummins are not entirely new
engines but rather refinements on previous designs. It's not like you would
be getting an entirely new engine.  My preference is the Duramax. I
personally don't think Navistar is on the right track, engineering-wise.
Cummins is an old trusted design that has been considerably upgraded.
You need to consider how much driving you will be doing that will *not* be
towing. I drive my truck too many miles *other than towing* to consider a
diesel.  Not that I wouldn't love to have one but I just don't need all that
power *MOST of the time*.
Just my thoughts.

I guess I knew that 3/4 ton was the way to go for my needs and sense
of comfort. I was double checking to make sure the 1/2 ton Chevy and
Tundra were not the right choice. They are both gorgeous trucks. In my
mind the question comes down to this: Will the new 07/08 diesels make
a difference to the environment? A few extra MPG's, a few less
particulates and CO2 in the air.
I wonder how much a of a difference. Any thoughts?

Quite apart from the merits of particular vehicles, just remember
about every car dealer rep:  "If their lips are moving, they must be

I have a relative who's a manager at a local California DMV office and
who deals constantly with local auto dealers.  It's the crookedest
business going.

The last time I had to buy a new vehicle, I wanted to get home and
take a hot shower to get the stench off.

Yup, I could pull it. Being an Airstream it would pull easier than my

pulling trailer even better.

I don't see that as any different than my fatherinlaw pulling his 24'
Airstream with a '64 Dodge 880 4dr sedan. He pulled it 3,300 miles
through Mexico on an Airstream safari and put 80,000+ miles on the
Dodge, most towing the trailer, and only stopped because the big C got
him. Hunter's trailer seems to weigh close to mine and her hitch
weight is less plus hers is shorter.

There, that oughta "draw" some decent flames &lt;vbg&gt;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Diesels are plenty dirty especailly with NOx emissions which will

&gt;&gt;&gt;dollar option costs. To suggest that if you got say 19 MPG solo and
&gt;&gt;&gt;now you could get up to almost 25MPG is nonsense. Also they did not
&gt;&gt;&gt;tell you that new CTD weighs about 130 lbs more too pushing engine
&gt;&gt;&gt;weight to around 1400lbs which is a lot of weight in the front of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;P/U anyway you cut it. Then there is Dodge refusal to offer front axle
&gt;&gt;&gt;discoonct on 4x4 modeld which means that front axle differental and
&gt;&gt;&gt;drive shaft is ALWAYS turning robbing potentail MPG. Dodge was also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;kind&quot; enough to use a bastard hub design that require a aftermarket
&gt;&gt;&gt;kit that costs about 2 grand (minus labor) to convert it to a free
&gt;&gt;&gt;wheeling axle in 2wd  that does not spin differentail and drive shaft.
&gt;&gt;&gt;This design of their lets them save maybe 100 bucks per truck or about
&gt;&gt;&gt;..25% on a 40K truck and costs you far more in extra fuel during life
&gt;&gt;&gt;of vehicle. They do not tell you this though anywhere is sales hype
&gt;&gt;&gt;for it  and the said part is for a few extra buck they could have done
&gt;&gt;&gt;it right but they hope to win you over with bells and whistles and not
&gt;&gt;&gt;look at the shortcomings of the overall design. Ford still disengages
&gt;&gt;&gt;complete axle on SD trucks and GM disconnects differentail in 2wd on
&gt;&gt;&gt;all their 4x4 models. Dodge does it on none of their current models
&gt;&gt;&gt;big or small.

&gt;&gt;I'll trust a DM press release regarding what their vehicles can deliver
&gt;&gt;before I'll trust your nonsense. Advertisements exaggerate, and everyone
&gt;&gt;knows it. If DM doesn't deliver what their press release promises, Ford
&gt;&gt;and Chevy will eat them alive, and they will deserve it.

&gt;&gt;GM promised me 20 mpg hwy driving, with my Duramax, and I can't remember
&gt;&gt;the last tank of fuel that didn't involve towing, that was less than 20
&gt;&gt;mpg. I've gotten as good as 23 mpg hwy driving.

&gt;&gt;These guys can't afford to lie about this stuff. They are looking over
&gt;&gt;their shoulders at Toyota.

My post wasn't ABOUT "car dealer reps".  It was about a manufacturer's
press release.
