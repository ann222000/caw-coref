A Prosecutorial Brief Against Israel and Its Supporters
By WILLIAM GRIMES

THE ISRAEL LOBBY AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY
By John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt
484 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $26.

&quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot; arrives carrying heavy
baggage. John J. Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the University
of Chicago, and Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international affairs
at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, set off a
furor last year by arguing, in an article that appeared in The London
Review of Books, that uncritical American support for Israel, shaped
by powerful lobbying organizations like the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee, does grave harm to both American and Israeli
interests.

A bitter debate has raged ever since, with accusations of anti-
Semitism leveled by, among others, Alan M. Dershowitz, the Harvard law
professor, and Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti-
Defamation League, one of the principal lobbying organizations taken
to task by Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt.

&quot;The Israel Lobby,&quot; an extended, more fully argued version of the
London Review article, has done nothing to calm the waters. The
authors have been barred from making appearances by at least one
university and several cultural centers to discuss their subject, and
continue to reap a whirlwind of criticism and abuse. If they were
looking for a fight, they have found it.

Slowly, deliberately and dispassionately Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt
lay out the case for a ruthlessly realistic Middle East policy that
would make Israel nothing more than one of many countries in the
region. On those occasions when Israel's interests coincide with
America's, it should count on American support, but otherwise not.
What Americans fail to understand, the authors argue, is that most of
the time the two countries' interests are opposed.

The reason they do not realize this, Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt
insist, can be explained quite simply: The Israel lobby makes sure of
it. Working closely with members of Congress, public-policy
organizations and journals of opinion, energetic, well-financed groups
like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the American
Jewish Committee, along with dozens of political-action committees,
perpetuate the myth, as the authors see it, of Israel as an isolated,
beleaguered state surrounded by enemies and in need of America's
unstinting financial and military support.

This lobby is particularly adept at stifling debate before it begins,
the authors argue. &quot;Whether the issue is abortion, arms control,
affirmative action, gay rights, the environment, trade policy, health
care, immigration or welfare, there is almost always a lively debate
on Capitol Hill,&quot; they write. &quot;But where Israel is concerned,
potential critics fall silent and there is hardly any debate at all.&quot;

There is nothing underhanded or devious about this, the authors say.
Like the National Rifle Association or the AARP, the Israel lobby
relies on the traditional political weapons available to any special-
interest group in pressing its agenda. It just happens to be unusually
skillful and effective.

&quot;It is simply a powerful interest group, made up of both Jews and
gentiles, whose acknowledged purpose is to press Israel's case within
the United States and influence American foreign policy in ways that
its members believe will benefit the Jewish state,&quot; they write.

The problem, Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt argue, is that Israel has
become a strategic liability with the end of the cold war and a moral
pariah in its dealings with the Palestinians and, most recently, the
Lebanese. Uncritical American support for its closest Middle East ally
has damaged American credibility in the Arab world, encouraged
terrorism, stymied the search for a solution to the Palestinian
problem, and in every way made America's international position weaker
and more dangerous.

Coolly, not to say coldly, Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt mount a
prosecutorial brief against Israel's foreign and domestic policies,
and against the state of Israel itself. They describe a virtual rogue
state, empowered by American wealth and might, that blocks peace at
every turn, threatens its cowering neighbors with impunity, crushes
the national aspirations of the Palestinians and, whenever the
opportunity arises, bites the hand that feeds it.

Working tirelessly in the background is the Israel lobby, playing Iago
to America's Othello, leading president after president down ever more
dangerous paths. Without intense pressure from the Israel lobby, the
authors argue, America would not have undertaken the war in Iraq.

Most American readers will bristle at the authors' characterization of
Israel. This is to be expected, Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt argue,
because of the completely false image of Israel and its history that
has been manufactured by the Israel lobby. As a result, Americans
completely misinterpret the Palestinian issue and fail to support a
productive policy that would tilt away from Israel and toward the
Palestinians.

The authors state, on several occasions, their belief that Israel has
a moral and legal right to exist, but the effect of their book is to
leave it dangling by a moral and strategic thread. In essence they
call for the United States to cut Israel loose, to return more or less
to American policy before the 1967 war, when the United States tried
to occupy a middle ground between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
Strangely, the authors do not itemize the fabulous benefits delivered
by this approach in the 1950s and '60s.

It is a little odd that so chilly a book should generate such heat.
Most of Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt's arguments are familiar ones,
and it is hardly inflammatory to point out that the major Jewish
organizations tend to take a much tougher line on, say, a two-state
solution to the Palestinian problem, the Iraq war or settlements in
the West Bank, than most American Jews favor. The writers stand on
eminently defensible ground when they argue for a more constructive,
creative American role in peace talks.

The general tone of hostility to Israel grates on the nerves, however,
along with an unignorable impression that hardheaded political realism
can be subject to its own peculiar fantasies. Israel is not simply one
country among many, for example, just as Britain is not. Americans
feel strong ties of history, religion, culture and, yes, sentiment,
that the authors recognize, but only in an airy, abstract way.

They also seem to feel that, with Israel and its lobby pushed to the
side, the desert will bloom with flowers. A peace deal with Syria
would surely follow, with a resultant end to hostile activity by
Hezbollah and Hamas. Next would come a Palestinian state, depriving Al
Qaeda of its principal recruiting tool. (The authors wave away the
idea that Islamic terrorism thrives for other reasons.) Well, yes,
Iran does seem to be a problem, but the authors argue that no one
should be particularly bothered by an Iran with nuclear weapons. And
on and on.

&quot;It is time,&quot; Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt write, &quot;for the United
States to treat Israel not as a special case but as a normal state,
and to deal with it much as it deals with any other country.&quot; But it's
not. And America won't. That's realism.
