CNN LATE EDITION WITH WOLF BLITZER

http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0709/30/le.01.html

Interview With Seymour Hersh; Interview With Hoshyar Zebari
Aired September 30, 2007 - 11:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND
MAY BE UPDATED.

WOLF BLITZER, HOST: It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, 8 a.m. in Los
Angeles, 6 p.m. in Baghdad. Whenever you're watching from around the
world, thanks very much for joining us for &quot;Late Edition.&quot;
As the rhetoric between the United States and Iran ratchets up over
Iran's nuclear ambitions and its involvement in Iraq, so do the
questions about whether a U.S.-led military confrontation between the
two countries is inevitable. The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist
Seymour Hersh has an article in new issue of The New Yorker magazine.
It's entitled &quot;Shifting Targets: The Administration's Plans for
Iran.&quot;

Seymour Hersh is here in our studio. Sy, thanks very much for coming
in.

SEYMOUR HERSH, NEW YORKER MAGAZINE: Sure.

BLITZER: I want get to the article in a second. But I want to show the
viewers the cover of The New Yorker magazine, and we'll put it up on
the screen. You can see it right there.

I guess it's fair to say it's Ahmadinejad with, what, a Senator Larry
Craig kind of pose in a men's room, tapping toes. What was the theory
behind this cover going after Ahmadinejad like this right now?

HERSH: You're asking me about a New Yorker cover? You might as well
ask me about a Rembrandt. The only thing I can say is, I don't think
Ahmadinejad's going to be coming back to New York very soon. It was a
rough trip.

BLITZER: It was a rough trip. And I guess in part that cover is
motivated by his statement, there are no gay people, there are no
homosexuals in Iran, a statement that was obviously ridiculed around
the world.

HERSH: Yes. That's a fair guess.

BLITZER: All right. let's talk a little about your article entitled
&quot;Shifting Targets: The Administration's Plan for Iran.&quot; I want to play
for you a clip of what the president, President Bush, said back on
August 28th in Reno, Nevada. Listen to this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: The attacks on our bases and our troops by
Iranian-supplied munitions have increased in the past few months,
despite pledges by Iran to help stabilize the security situation in
Iraq.

I will take actions necessary to protect our troops. I have authorized
our military commanders in Iraq to confront Tehran's murderous
activities.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BLITZER: You cite that among many other statements as, what,
escalating the rhetoric coming out of Washington right now. What's
going on?

HERSH: Well, they've changed their rhetoric, really. The name of the
game used to be, they're a nuclear threat. Iran is going to have a
bomb soon. We have to do it.

Sort of the same game we had before the war in Iraq. And what's
happened is in the last few months, they've come to the realization
that they're not selling it. It isn't working. The American people
aren't worried about Iran as a nuclear threat, certainly as they were
about Iraq. There's some skepticism. So they switched, really.

BLITZER: Is it just a public relations tactic or, as the
administration maintains, there is evidence, they say, of extensive
Iranian involvement in fueling this sectarian violence in Iraq.

HERSH: Absolutely, as far as their concerned, the Iranians are deeply
involved in the killing of Americans and coalition British Forces. And
it's also fair to say it's not -- we don't know whether Iran is really
trying to get a bomb or not.

But the fact is, there's no evidence. And the White House has come to
terms finally with the idea that it's the American community's pretty
much total consensus that they're five years at least away. They're
not getting any...

BLITZER: From getting a nuclear bomb.

HERSH: Absolutely. They're going nowhere with their research, despite
the braggadocio. So the White House has shifted.

Instead of trying to sell it, not only to the American people but to
its allies, the notion of a massive bombing against the
infrastructure, what they call counterproliferation against the
infrastructure of the Iraqi bomb, hitting the various facilities we
know that exist, instead they're now decided they're going to hit the
Iranians, payback for hitting us.

They're going to hit the Revolutionary Guard headquarters and
facilities. They're going to tone down the bombing. They're going to
shift it. It's going to be more surgical. It's going to be much more
limited.

BLITZER: Airstrikes. Let me read to you from your article: &quot;During a
secure video conference that took place early this summer, the
president told Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, that he was
thinking of hitting Iranian targets across the border and that the
British were on board. Bush ended by instructing Crocker to tell Iran
to stop interfering in Iraq or it would face American retribution.&quot;

And you see that as a change in the U.S. strategy?

HERSH: Well, the strategy is, it's a targeting change. We're
threatening Iran. We've been doing it constantly. But instead of
saying to the American people, instead of saying internally it's going
to be about nuclear weapons, it's now going to be about getting the
guys that are killing our boys.

We're going to hit the border facilities, the facilities inside Iraq
we think are training terrorists. We're going to hit the facilities we
think are supplying some of the explosive devices into Iraq. This is
the administration's position.

BLITZER: And this would be air power, what you're saying, cruise
missiles or surgical airstrikes, is that what you're saying?

HERSH: Of course. A lot of cruise missiles, a lot of surgical
airstrikes. You also have to go on the ground because you've got to
suppress their anti-air defenses. You've got to make sure you, as
somebody said to me, a path in, a path out.

And one of the problems with all of this, of course, is that inside
the intelligence community, the notion that Iran is doing as much as
the president says is not accepted. I mean, there's a great debate
about how deeply involved Iran really is.

BLITZER: In what's going on in Iraq?

HERSH: Yes.

BLITZER: Let me read again from the article. This is what you write:
&quot;I was repeatedly cautioned in interviews that the president has yet
to issue the 'execute order' that would be required for a military
operation inside Iran, and such an order may never be issued. But
there has been a significant increase in the tempo of attack
planning.&quot;

I want you to explain what you mean. What does that mean, an increase
in the tempo?

HERSH: Well, publicly, they've castigated the Revolutionary Guards.
The language is increasing, just as you heard the president say to the
-- last August in the clip you showed.

On the inside, the CIA has really been ramping up very hard. There's
something called the Iranian Operations Group. We had the same kind of
a group for the Iraqi war. Before the war in Iraq, we had an
operations group. It's suddenly exploding in manpower. And they've
been going around, just dragging a dozen people here, a dozen there.
They built it up into a large, large operational group.

I'm told also, I didn't write this in the article, I'm told that the
National Security Council inside the White House is focused much more
on attacking Iran and what's going on in Iran than it has been before.
There's been a significant increase on the inside. BLITZER: On the so-
called military option. Here's what the White House press secretary
Dana Perino told us: &quot;The president believes this issue can be solved
diplomatically. And the administration is working with the
international community through the United Nations Security Council,
plus Germany, to bring diplomatic measures to bear on Iran to put an
end to its enrichment and reprocessing activities.&quot;

HERSH: At the same time, as I write in this article, they've been
pitching this new idea of hitting the Revolutionary Guards, more
limited, more surgical, more carefully drawn up, planned attack. And
where, for example, the Brits, who were very hostile to the idea of a
thousand points of lights, bombing, all the heavy air force coming and
bombing the nuclear facilities, it takes a lot of bombs. Many of them
are underground.

The Brits are interested in this idea. There's been expressions of
interest from Australia, other countries. The Israelis, of course,
have gone bananas. They're very upset about the idea of not going.

If you're going into Iran, the Israeli position is very firm. They
want us to go. And they want us to hit hard. You do not, as somebody,
an Israeli, told me, if you run into a lion, you either shoot it or
ignore it. You don't pluck out its eyebrows.

Going in and taking out the Revolutionary Guards and not taking out
the nuclear facilities for the Israelis is a non-starter. But that's
the plan. The plan is to be more surgical, more careful and they're
getting some of their allies on board.

BLITZER: And here's what also you write. You say, &quot;Now the emphasis is
on surgical strikes on Revolutionary Guard Corps facilities in Tehran
and elsewhere, which the administration claims have been the source of
attacks on Americans in Iraq. What had been presented primarily as a
counter-proliferation mission has been reconceived as
counterterrorism.&quot;

And there's obviously different kinds of military moves you deal with
fighting terrorism as opposed to proliferation, nuclear weapons, for
example.

HERSH: Absolutely. And you can also sell counterterror. It's more
logical. You

Seymour Hersh has been so discredited (ever since his utterly false
allegations about the KAL 007 shootdown) that no one except the more
gullible segments of the controversy-loving American media would pay
the slightest attention to anything he said.  This silliness just adds

Dan, no one with *brain* needs Seymour Hersh to see that the Bush
administration is playing from the same script, they were successful to
launch their aggression against Iraq. A aggression on Iran has already
been decided, in my opinion. The question is, what is after that?

So far Bush, the neocons quest for world domination has been a disaster
for our country, but for the military industrial complex and the oil
interest. With the support of the Democrats, don't be fooled by their
seeming resistance to the war, it will go on for a long time. Until our
nation is hollowed out by its imperial wars.

What else do you fix, redc1c4?

Do you fix the two millions of Iraqis forced to leave their country as

Do you fix an other two millions of Iraqis forced to leave their homes

Most had no idea what they voted for. You give too much credit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What is your source for that?

&gt; &gt; The British public.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, we -absolutely- want bases in the Middle East.  What we had/have
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Saudi Arabia was not satisfactory.  Too many limits.

&gt; &gt; What do you need them for ?

&gt; We need them to control the flow of Oil from the region of course.

That's none of your damn business.

UK.

The military adventure in Iraq was hugely unpopular. It's judged to have
adversely affected our securiry.

&gt; Public opinion? Of course, it would be a shock if in the western
&gt; 'democracies' their government would respect the wishes of the people.
&gt; (see Aznar or Berlusconi, they disregarded 70-90% of their people.)

Blair also disregarded public opinion at the time. Prior to the recent Iraq War
there was the largest ever demonstration recorded in British history against it
with some one million demonstrators. They were right too. The whole adventure
has been a disastrous fiasco.

The government has never followed, respected the public's pinions. They,
the puppets of the plutocrats do wars whenever they want to. It's only
the matter of sufficient brainwashing to bring the over worked, drugged,
masses on their side. The media has never failed to perform this for the
plutocracy, they are paid to be the servants of the plutocracy.

I think that confuses Hersh with the claims of a certain Tony Devereux,
originally published under the pseudonym P. Q. Mann.

Devereux's speculations have been roundly dicredited.  Hersh's seem to
have fared considerably better.

So far as I know, Hersh never claimed any space shuttle - KAL 007
connection.
