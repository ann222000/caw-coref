Why is George Mason reading CICERO?
---------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;CICERO is said to bee the only wit, that the people of Rome
had equall'd to their Empire. Ingenium par imperio. We
have had many, and in their severall Ages, (to take in
but the former Seculum.) Sir Thomas Moore, the elder
Wait; Henry , Earle of Surrey; Chaloner, Smith, Eliot,
B. Gardiner, were for their times admirable : and the more,
because they began Eloquence with us. Sir Nico: Bacon,
was singular, and almost alone, in the beginning of Queene
Elizabeths times. Sir Philip Sidney, and Mr. Hooker
(in different matter) grew great Masters of wit, and language ;
and in whom all vigour of Invention, and strength of
judgement met. The Earle of Essex, noble and high ;
and Sir Walter Rawleigh, not to be contemn'd, either for
judgement, or stile. Sir Henry Savile grave, and truly letter'd
; Sir Edwin Sandes, excellent in both : Lo: EDGERTON,
and the Chancellor, a grave, and great Orator ; and
best, when hee was provok'd. But his learned, and
able (though unfortunate) Successor is he, who hath
fill'd up all numbers ; and perform'd that in our tongue,
which may be compar'd, or preferr'd, either to
insolent Greece, or haughty Rome. In short, within his view
, and about his times, were all the wits borne, that could
honour a language, or helpe study. Now things daily fall :
wits grow downe-ward, and Eloquence growes back-ward :
So that hee may be nam'd, and stand as the marke,
and achmae of our language. &gt;&gt;

Act III, Scene 2 Summary

&lt;&lt;The place is a court before Justice Shallow's house in
Gloucestershire. Shallow greets SILENCE, his fellow-justice and kinsman.
He inquires about the health of Silent's wife and daughter and about the
progress of William, his son at Oxford. He says William should go to the
Inns of Court (law schools in London). Shallow is confident that his
reputation as a wild young fellow still survives there. He recalls
Falstaff as a boy to Mowbray. He recalls how both of them had the habit
of brawling when they were young. He then talks about the certainty of
death that they all have to face.

Then Bardolph and one of Falstaff's men enter. Shallow introduces
himself as a poor country squire and one of the King's justices of the
peace. Bardolph conveys him master's greetings whereupon the delighted
Justice admits that Falstaff was indeed a good man and inquires about
his wife. Bardolph says that a soldier is better accommodated than with
a wife. Shallow is enchanted by the expression &quot;better accommodated.&quot;
When Falstaff makes his appearance, Shallow tells him that he has a
dozen men among whom good recruits may be found. Despite the first
recruit Mouldy's protests that his wife will object, he is chosen by
Falstaff because he is of the opinion that Mouldy, being a good limbed
fellow, young and strong and of good family, must be put to use.
Falstaff approves of Simon Shadow as the second recruit--he being the
natural son of some unknown male. Francis FEEBLE, whom Falstaff
ironically observes to be a valiant as the wrathful dove or most
magnanimous mouse, is taken as the third recruit. Next,
Peter Bullcalf is selected, despite his protests that he has a cold.

Bullcalf and Mouldy offer money to Bardolph to secure their release
from duty. Bullacalf says he would rather be hanged than go to war.
Mouldy says that his wife is old and needs help. FEEBLE says that he
doesn't mind dying for the country: &quot;A man can die but once.&quot; Falstaff
congratulates Bardolph for accepting money from the recruits for their
release. Falstaff selects Wart, a man of spirit; Shadow; and FEEBLE,
who can run swiftly.&gt;&gt;

But if he had beene a mans Taylor, he would haue prick'd

FEEBLE: I will doe my good will sir, you can haue no more.

In pioneer days they used OX EN for heavy pulling,
and when one OX couldn't budge a log,
they didn't try to grow a larger OX.
We shouldn't be trying for bigger computers,

But, Holy SALTMARTIN, why can't you beat time?

&lt;&lt;In 1943 HOPpEr was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve. She was commissioned a Lieutenant (JG) and was ordered to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University. She became the first programmer on the Navy's Mark I computer. HOPpEr loved this 8 foot high, 8 foot wide gadget filled with relays, switches and vacuum tubes. Once, while working on Mark I, a group of admirals came to see the machine in action. Earlier that day, something failed and was causing the computer to shut down every several seconds. HOPpEr's quick thinking saved her and her staff some embarrassment. She leaned against the machine and kept her finger discreetly on the start button the whole time to keep the computer running. The Mark I made mistake after mistake but the admirals didn't notice. They left thinking they witnessed and error free run.&gt;&gt;

That's what the Goon Squad does:
they hold their collective finger on the start button.
but the general public doesn't notice.

Innocents Abroad - Mark Twain ** [Marseille]

One PRISONer of fifteen years had scratched verses upon his walls,
and brief prose sentences -- brief, but full of pathos.
These spoke not of himself and his hard estate, but
only of the shrine where his spirit fled the PRISON to worship -- of
home and the idols that were templed there. He never lived to see them.
The walls of these dungeons are as thick as some bed-chambers at home
are wide -- fifteen feet. We saw the damp, dismal cells in which two
of Dumas' heroes passed their confinement -- heroes of &quot;Monte Cristo.&quot;
It was here that the brave Abbé wrote a book with his own blood, with
a pen made of a piece of iron hoop, and by the light of a lamp made
out of shreds of cloth soaked in GREASE obtained from his food; and
then dug through the thick wall with some trifling instrument which
he wrought himself out of a stray piece of iron or table cutlery
and freed Dantés from his chains. It was a pity that so many
weeks of dreary labor should have come to naught at last.

&lt;&lt;One of the great fat ladies in Shakespeare is NELL in The Comedy of
Errors, whom we never actually see. She is described by Dromio of
Syracuse, who has been fending off her advances. She's &quot;a wondrous fat
marriage,&quot; he tells Antipholus, by which he means &quot;she's the kitchen
wench, and all GREASE.&quot; But GREASE is next to grace, so she's &quot;a very
reverent body.&quot; Like a stubby candle, she's made of so much greasy
tallow she'd &quot;burn a Poland winter.&quot;&quot;If she lives till doomsday, she'll
burn a week longer than the whole world&quot; (III, ii). She's lubricious,
lewd, and well-lubed; she's glossy, chubby, and hot. Grace is GREASE.
A graceful dancer slips across the floor, flows easily with the liquid
smoothness, the frictionless effort of what is suave, fluent, polished,
and fine. The fat, it's often been noted, are good dancers, smooth
and graceful as silky GREASE.

NELL, this kitchen wench, is ROUND, &quot;No longer from head to foot than
from hip to hip. She is spherical, like a GLOBE.&quot; And being a GLOBE,
her body offers continents of flesh to the avid explorer, and smaller
zones as well. &quot;I could find out countries in her,&quot;

&lt;&lt;John Heminges was born in Droitwich, Gloucestershire, and at the age
of eleven he was sent off to London &amp; apprenticed to a grocer, James
Collins, for nine years. Collins died during Heminges' apprenticeship,
but Heminges finished out his apprenticeship under Mrs. COLLINS,
becoming a freeman of the grocers in 1587.

Less than a year later, he married Rebecca KNELL,
the widow of William KNELL, a famous actor with the Queen's
Men who had been KILLED IN A DUEL with a fellow actor

At the time of their marriage, Rebecca was 16 &amp; John was 21.
They started having kids immediately, not stopping
until they had 14 children (a couple of whom died in infancy).
That's a dozen mouths to feed in addition to their own.

Yet as far as we know, Heminges was working as an actor -- he may
have been involved with the theater at the time of his marriage,
given that his wife was the widow of an actor, but it's not until
five years later in 1593 that he shows up in the documentary
record as a member of Strange's Men. Yet despite being &quot;only&quot;
an actor (and later a sharer in the GLOBE and Blackfriars),
despite having a wife and 14 kids to support,
Heminges SOMEHOW became fairly wealthy:&gt;&gt;

died on Inner Farne in March 20, 687;

Saint Cuthbert is possibly the most venerated saint in England,
especially in the northern part of the country, where he was
a very active missionary. Yet his real nationality is debated.
His biographer, Saint Bede, did not specify it.
The English claim him, but so do the Scottish.

&quot;As for the other, leave once obtained, he straight off goes to
fetch his mae, and with no tarrying, back they both come, and
carrying along with them a suitable present, no less than a good-

time thereafter the man of God would show it the brethren who came
to see him, and would offer it to GREASE their shoes, and he would
urge on them how obedient and humble men should be, when the
proudest of birds made haste with prayers and lamentation and
presents to atone for the insult he had given to man. And so, for
an example of reformed life to men, these did abide for many years
thereafter on that same island, and built their nest, nor ever
wrought annoyance upon any&quot; (Bede).

Ten following Bookes to the former TREASURIE of
AUNCIENT AND MODERN TIMES to Phillip Montgomery and

diverse turnings as you walke, and everie one will tell you the Historie
of her life and fortune (rare examples of VERTUE and Honor) as
themselves can best, truly &amp; plainly discourse unto you. Some other also

of those leaves wreathed about their heads, sighing out their diVERs
disasters: whom your noble nature cannot choose but commiserate;
as greeving to see a scratch in a cleare skin, and a bodie
beautified by Nature, to be blemished by unkinde Destiny.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------
Of Truth by Francis Bacon
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;WHAT is truth? said jesting Pilate,and would not stay for an answer.

The first creature of God, in the works of the days,
was the light of the sense; the last, was the light of reason;
and his sabbath work EVER since, is the illumination of his Spirit. First
he breathed light, upon the face of the matter or chaos; then he breathed
light, into the face of man; and still he breatheth and inspireth light,
into the face of his chosen. The poet, that beautified the sect,
that was otherwise inferior to the rest, saith yet excellently well: It is a
pleasure, to stand upon the shore, and to see ships tossed upon the sea; a
pleasure, to stand in the window of a castle, and to see a battle, and the
adventures thereof below: but no pleasure is comparable to the standing
upon the vantage ground of truth (a hill not to be commanded,
and where the air is always clear and serene), and to see the ERRORS,
and wanderings, and mists, and TEMPESTS, in the vale below;
so always that this prospect be with pity, and not with swelling, or pride.
Certainly, it is heaven upon earth, to have a man's mind move in charity,
rest in providence, and turn upon the poles of truth.

bosome, these.

Qu. Came this from Hamlet to her.

Pol. Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull.
Doubt thou, the Starres are fire,
Doubt, that the Sunne doth moue:
Doubt Truth to be a Lier,
But neuer Doubt, I loue.
O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these Numbers: I haue not Art to
reckon my grones; but that I loue thee best, oh most Best be-
leeue it. Adieu.

Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this
Machine is to him, Hamlet.

This in Obedience hath my daughter shew'd me:
And more aboue hath his soliciting,
As they fell out by Time, by Meanes, and Place,
All giuen to mine eare.

Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (1604 Quarto) Act 2, Scene 2

Pol. This busines is well ended.
My Liege and Maddam, to expostulate
What maiestie should be, what dutie is,
Why day is day, night, night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to wast night, day, and time,
Therefore breuitie is the soule of wit,
And tediousnes the lymmes and outward florishes,
I will be briefe, your noble sonne is mad:
Mad call I it, for to define true madnes,
What ist but to be nothing els but mad,
But let that goe.

Quee. More matter with lesse art.

Pol. Maddam, I sweare I vse no art at all,
That hee's mad tis true, tis true, tis pitty,
And pitty tis tis true, a foolish figure,
But farewell it, for I will vse no art.
Mad let vs graunt him then, and now remaines
That we find out the cause of this effect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
For this effect defectiue comes by cause:
Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus
Perpend,
I haue a daughter, haue while she is mine,
Who in her dutie and obedience, marke,
Hath giuen me this, now gather and surmise,
To the Celestiall and my soules Idoll, the most beau-
tified Ophelia ,that's an ill phrase, a vilephrase,
beautified is a vilephrase, but you shall heare: thusin
her excellent white bosome, these &amp;c.

Quee. Came this from Hamlet to her?

Pol. Good Maddam stay awhile, I will be faithfull,

Doubt thou the starres are fire, Letter.
Doubt that the Sunne doth moue,
Doubt truth to be a lyer,
But neuer doubt I loue.

O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers, I haue not art to recken
my grones, but that I loue thee best, o most best belieue it, adew.
Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this machine is to him.

Pol. This in obedience hath my daughter showne me, (Hamlet.

Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (1603 Quarto) Act 2, Scene 2

Cor. This busines is very well dispatched.
Now my Lord, touching the yong Prince Hamlet,
Certaine it is that hee is madde: mad let vs grant him then:
Now to know the cause of this effect,
Or else to say the cause of this defect,
For this effect defectiue comes by cause.

Queene Good my Lord be briefe.

Cor. Madam I will: my Lord, I haue a daughter,
Haue while shee's mine: for that we thinke
Is surest, we often loose: now to the Prince.
My Lord, but note this letter,
The which my daughter in obedience
Deliuer'd to my handes.

King Reade it my Lord.

Cor. Marke my Lord.
Doubt that in earth is fire,
Doubt that the starres doe moue,
Doubt trueth to be a liar,
But doe not doubt I loue.
To the beautifull Ofelia:
Thine euer the most vnhappy Prince Hamlet.
My Lord, what doe you thinke of me?

I, or what might you thinke when I sawe this?

King As of a true friend and a most louing subiect.

_Susan Vere, William Jaggard and the 1623 Shakespeare Folio_
by Roger Stritmatter (©1998)

------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt; [Jaggard's 1619] ARXAIO-PLOUTOS. . . Containing,
Ten following Bookes to the former TREASURIE of
AUNCIENT AND MODERN TIMES to Phillip Montgomery and
to Montgomery's wife, the Lady Susan Vere.

As alfo, To the truly vertuous and Noble Counteffe his Wife,
the Lady Sufan, Daughter to the right Honourable Edward Vere,
Earle of Oxen-ford, Vifcount Bulbec, Lord Sandford and
of Badelefmere : and Lord High Chamberlaine of England, etc.

In this garden, Jaggard assures Lady Vere,

...you may meete with a faire Bevey of Queenes and Ladies, at
diverse turnings as you walke, and everie one will tell you the Historie
of her life and fortune (rare examples of VERTUE and Honor) as
themselves can best, truly &amp; plainly discourse unto you. Some other also
you shall see, sadly sitting under Eughe &amp; Cipresse tress, with Garlands
of those leaves wreathed about their heads, sighing out their diVERs
disasters: whom your noble nature cannot choose but commiserate;
as greeving to see a scratch in a cleare skin, and a bodie
beautified by Nature, to be blemished by unkinde Destiny.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------
Of Truth by Francis Bacon
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;WHAT is truth? said jesting Pilate,and would not stay for an answer.

The first creature of God, in the works of the days,
was the light of the sense; the last, was the light of reason;
and his sabbath work EVER since, is the illumination of his Spirit. First
he breathed light, upon the face of the matter or chaos; then he breathed
light, into the face of man; and still he breatheth and inspireth light,
into the face of his chosen. The poet, that beautified the sect,
that was otherwise inferior to the rest, saith yet excellently well: It is a
pleasure, to stand upon the shore, and to see ships tossed upon the sea; a
pleasure, to stand in the window of a castle, and to see a battle, and the
adventures thereof below: but no pleasure is comparable to the standing
upon the vantage ground of truth (a hill not to be commanded,
and where the air is always clear and serene), and to see the ERRORS,
and wanderings, and mists, and TEMPESTS, in the vale below;
so always that this prospect be with pity, and not with swelling, or pride.
Certainly, it is heaven upon earth, to have a man's mind move in charity,
rest in providence, and turn upon the poles of truth.

That settles it, then -- this cannot be mere coincidence, so the

Better that than the st(ART BUTT)on that Art has been raving about
elsewhere. Come to think of it, Art's utterance echoes the monumental
phrase &quot;...Leaves living ART BUT page...[enphasis added]&quot;. Surely that
cannot be a coincidence either!

One might almost call you an accessory after the fact were it not
