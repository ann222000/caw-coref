I realise this is probably an overlong and daft question but I just
wondered if anyone on the forum had any ideas. My friend's Ford Ka has
an annoying 'tinkling' rattle. It sounds very much like a length of
unsupported brake pipe vibrating against the body for a few seconds
whenever the car accelerates away or labours momentarily when changing
down going up a hill. It doesn't seem to occur when going over bumps
and it seems to emanate from the front of the car around the nearside
sill area. I have a fair bit of diy automotive experience and I've
inspected underneath the car repeatedly and checked all pipework,
suspension exhaust and everything else for tightness or narrow gaps
and all seems ok. I just cannot see what else it could be. However,
the car is nearly 10 years old - is it possible there is some sort of
bracing strut or such within the sill that could have partially rotted
or come adrift that could produce such a noise? Thanks for any
responses.

pinking OR the cat is breaking up.
try running it on some good fuel (like bp ultimate or any branded fuel other
than supermarket stuff) for a tank or two.
if it is the cat then either remove the loose block of cat stuff or replace
the whole thing
