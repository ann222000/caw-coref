Foie gras production has been outlawed by many civilized countries around
the world, due to its horrific cruelty. But the U.S. continues to produce
and consume this awful product, much to the dismay of animal lovers across
the nation.

As well he should. So long as the product is legal and there is demand,
they have every right to produce and sell it without interference.

Not that it isn't a disgusting substance, but folks eat caviar and
haggis too. By all means, discourage people from eating disgusting
stuff, but never think for a moment you have any right to force them.

As well he should. There is no excuse for the attack. The deliberate
destruction of private property is a violent act; and the use of
violence against non-military targets to achieve political ends by
intimidation is the very definition of terrorism.

Perhaps you have forgotten the policy that, 'We will make no distinction

Your ARA darlings are terorists, and you are no better for cheering them

You defend terrorists and terrorism. Those &quot;good&quot; people are
indiscriminate thugs who harmed the lives and property of people who had
no connection with the chef's retail shop (it wasn't his restaurant that
was attacked). Indeed, the chef is engaged in a fully legal, ethical
business. The thugs went beyond that, to refresh your booze-addled and
otherwise failing memory: they videotaped the chef at home with his
family and then sent him the tape with threats; they called him at all
hours threatening to harm him and his family; and they engaged in acts
of vandalism at his residence as well as upon his car.

No, they do not. Not even the 50 states follow the same definition of
'cruelty' - cockfighting is still legal in 2 states, beastiality in 20;
what is a misdemeanor in one place is a felony elsewhere, and not even
on the books in other places. And that's in the legal code, which is
nothing more than a reflection of the general consensus of a group of
legislators at one point in time. Individual perceptions are even more
variable and less consistent.

FYI the narrowest definition of cruelty is the deliberate infliction of
pain or distress for the express and specific purpose of causing
distress. The force-feeding of geese does not meet this definition.
OTOH there are a number of wooly-minded persons (such as yourself) who
will use 'cruelty' to refer to - well, damn near anything. Most people
have a conception of meaning somewhere between the two extremes.

Suppose for a moment - just for illustration - that we can define
force-feeding geese as 'cruelty.' (Technically it's a form of abuse but
that's a distinction beyond your capabilities to grasp.) Taking that as
a reference point, allowing thousands of old folks to roast to death
would have to be considered cruel as well; rounding up and shooting
thousands of people merely because they don't like how you run the
country would be 'extreme cruelty on a massive scale.' Yet you have
voiced no support for violence to protest the former, and actively
voiced objection to violence the oppose the latter.

Clearly, you either have no respect whatsoever for human suffering, or
are too naive and incoherent to apply the same principles to any
incident not spoon-fed to you by activists. Or you're just a
perniciously hypocritical cunt.

detailing many abuses of the ducks, Sullivan County assistant district
attorney agreed the case was very strong.

Several veterinarians experienced in the care of waterfowl
accompanied the police who raided Commonwealth Enterprises
and swore detailed affidavits attesting to severe injuries, illness,
and suffering in ducks used for foie gras production there. Although
the New York Times failed to report on the history-making raid and

These fucking ass anti-animal shits just won't quit, will they.
They do absolutely NOTHING but give a hard time to hard-working

animal groups work hard to make the world a better place for ALL of us.
Dutch owes it to these animal rights institutions
even to have a free place to express his opinions.
If it were not for them, Dutch would not have an alt.animals
or alt.vegetarian, etc. newsgroup to post his shit.

Are you fully aware that you kill MORE animals and plants by
eating HIGHER on the food chain than LOWER?
And, you kill MORE animals HIGHER UP the food chain in a MUCH more
SLOW and PAINFUL way than a quick death by agricultural machinery?
By eating meat, you then have to contain animals in little cages
their whole lives?

But you cannot expect anti-animal rights extremists to understand
such simple concepts, since they do not have brains, and therefore
by THEIR own definition do not have right. They never had to think
for themselves in their lives.

Do you want to talk consequences, or do you want to bring up the law?
It is MY right to vote for a candidate who will make it a crime to
kill or breed animals for food. Don't waste my time with the exceptions,
because the more you push for your selfish little right to eat veal,
the more legislators will push to outlaw your right to eat meat ---
even if you are starving and there is meat already rotting in a trash
can and no more animals are killed by you going to eat meat out of the
trash. Since you do not care about OUR cause, I will not care about
YOUR cause, even when your cause is truly necessary.

YOU are the extremist, because &quot;extremism&quot; means &quot;fighting for one goal
at the expense of all others, no matter how much pain it causes&quot;.
So your cause is to eat beef and chicken and pork,
no matter how much pain and suffering and terror that causes,
when you could cause a LOT less pain and suffering and terror
by eating something else. THAT makes YOU an EXTREMIST.

In contrast, the animal-rights activist attempts to BALANCE
how much sacrifice they make by choosing different drugs or foods or
cosmetics against the sacrifice of all animals and plants.

Technically correct. Though flag-burning is technically legal under the
rubric of 'free speech' it can be actionable as creating a public
disturbance, inciting to riot, or simply illegal burning; it can also,
from a certain point of view, be classed as hate speech or (to those who
know what the act truly expresses) sedition - but it's highly doubtful
any court would respect the latter two.

In any event, it is not an attack on a person, and therefore does not
justify violent retribution. Arrest and appropriate penalties, perhaps,
but not violence.

If this is true, then it holds universally: in all places and time.

those who killed Jews were innocent people.

Right now, child porn in most places in the world and at most points

Ok. I accept that you believe this. However, do you understand
WHY you say this? Do you say this because
felony arson is ILLEGAL
OR
because felony arson hurts the drug dealer?

Those are two concepts which you are incapable of separating in your
puny little mind -- and I do not care HOW MANY war experiences you
have had if you cannot get those concepts separated.

If you oppose felony arson of drug dealers because it is ILLEGAL,
then you cannot complain if legislators, lobbying groups, a majority
of the population -- whatever it legal takes -- make it legal.

If you oppose felony arson of drug dealers because is HURTS THE
DRUG DEALER (physically, emotionally) then you have three questions
to answer:
1) Do you oppose ALL hurt to the drug dealer because you consider
yourself a noble self-righteous pacifist -- hurting ANY living
creature
is wrong no matter what the cause? (As you can guess, my answer is
no.)
2) Do you oppose felony arson to the drug dealer because the harm
to the drug dealer of forced felony arson is greater than the harm
the drug dealer caused to cocaine addicts? (If you say yes, then your
point has merit.)
3) If you answered YES to question 2 -- then is it not hypocritical
to punish drug dealers by putting them in prison for 20 years if
the harm to the drug dealer of being in prison for 20 years is
GREATER than felony arson? (The answer: definitely YES. Harm is harm,
regardless of whether it takes an illegal form -- arson -- or legal
form -- imprisonment. Either form can be worse than the other,
depending
upon the magnitude of the action.)

Exactly! Same with fighting for animals: how much force is justified

If you don't like hunting, stay out of the woods or go to parks where

Advertising affects you mostly in the privacy of your home, where you're

AR terrorism is pretty serious. Ask the FBI:

In recent years, the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) -- an
extremist animal rights movement -- has become one of the most
active extremist elements in the United States. Despite the
destructive aspects of ALF's operations, its operational
philosophy discourages acts that harm &quot;any animal, human and
nonhuman.&quot; Animal rights groups in the United States, including
ALF, have generally adhered to this mandate. A distinct but
related group, the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), claimed
responsibility for the arson fires set at a Vail, Colorado, ski
resort in October 1998 that destroyed eight separate structures
and caused $12 million dollars in damages. In a communique
issued after the fires, ELF claimed that the fires were in
retaliation for the resort's planned expansion that would
destroy the last remaining habitat in Colorado for the lynx.
Eight of the terrorist incidents occurring in the United States
during 1999 have been attributed to either ALF or ELF. Several
additional acts committed during 2000 and 2001 are currently
being reviewed for possible designation as terrorist incidents.
