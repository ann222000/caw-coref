I watched Lawrence of Arabia on TV the other day--still pretty good. Near the end, after a Turkish Army is retreating towards Damascus after committing an atrocity (women and children killed) Lawrence and his men roll up, view the carnage and one of his guys makes a horseback sword charge and is cut down by the Turkish Mausers. Then the very ugly new guy says in a thick Arab accent, "No Prisoners!" Lawrence takes up the plea and the Arabs massacre the Turks. Lawrence seems to have both abhorred and enjoyed it, but he was a little weird.

Ralph Peters has said it now-- No Prisoners! (actually he wrote Kill, Don't Capture ). So the question becomes will any leader take up the cry. I say not likely.

I've written before on the Guantanamo prisoner kerfuffle and not taking any prisoners was a possible solution I immediately rejected as inhumane and un-American ( Tarleton's Quarter ).

Good to see there is a successful, sane writer who is even tougher and more ruthless in a pursuit of victory than I am. Here is some of his far from illogical reasoning:

Violent Islamist extremists must be killed on the battlefield. Only in the rarest cases should they be taken prisoner. Few have serious intelligence value. And, once captured, there's no way to dispose of them.

Killing terrorists during a conflict isn't barbaric or immoral - or even illegal. We've imposed rules upon ourselves that have no historical or judicial precedent...

The oft-cited, seldom-read Geneva and Hague Conventions define legal combatants as those who visibly identify themselves by wearing uniforms or distinguishing insignia...

Those who wear civilian clothes to ambush soldiers or collect intelligence are assassins and spies - beyond the pale of law.

Traditionally, those who masquerade as civilians in order to kill legal combatants have been executed promptly, without trial. Severity, not sloppy leftist pandering, kept warfare within some decent bounds at least part of the time....

Conferring unprecedented legal status upon these murderous transnational outlaws is unnecessary, unwise and ultimately suicidal....

Every terrorist mission should be a suicide mission. With our help...

Our policy toward terrorists and insurgents in civilian clothing should be straightforward and public: Surrender before firing a shot or taking hostile action toward our troops, and we'll regard you as a legal prisoner. But once you've pulled a trigger, thrown a grenade or detonated a bomb, you will be killed. On the battlefield and on the spot.

Isn't that common sense? It also happens to conform to the traditional conduct of war between civilized nations. Ignorant of history, we've talked ourselves into folly.

Ralph Peters admits this course of action will not happen, at least not yet.

I disagree. If you kill them, you make them martyrs. There is a third cause of action which will serve as a deterent. It's not exactly civilized but then neither are violent Islamic extremists.

When one is captured, I suggest that if an American soldier can swear to the fact that this person shoot a weapon, threw a grenade, or detonated a bomb, that person would be taken immediately to a hospital where he would be emasculated and his genitals fed to swine. Then his right hand would be amputated after which he would be freed.

I think the number of new recruits would plummet don't you? In Arab cultures the right hand is the food hand while the left is used for cleaning the other end of the alimentary canal. In many Arab cultures, the punishment for theft was/is amputation of the right hand which is a death sentence b/c no one will let anyone eat from a communal dish w/ their left hand for obvious reasons.

No one can enjoy the prospect of being castrated and when you add the prospect of the engine of future generations being fed to animal that Muslims consider unclean, well there you go.

One thing I'm confused about: Does Peter's policy apply to only Violent Islamist extremists or does it include suspected Violent Islamist extremists as well.

Zo Zo, too barbaric for my tastes but good that you're thinking strategically.
Anon, I guess it would include the guys firing weapons at our soldiers. Weird question.

I've been thinking a lot about Ghengis Khan lately, and this made me think about it again. You know, when he overran a city, he would give the people one chance to become his subjects. If there was any resistance what so ever, he would kill everyone.

Now THAT is how you win hearts and minds.

Under Khan's leadership, pretty much everyone in Iraq would be dead.

Mike, didn't the Mongols conquer Iraq? My memory of ancient Eastern history is not worth spit.

What I can't figure out is, if the actions of our enemies are so terrible (and they are), why do you insist on emulating them so much?

Anon, I don't doubt for a second your inability to figure things out, but I can't tell from your comment what you are talking about.
Why do "I" insist on emulating our enemies? I've rejected 'no prisoners' as inhumane and un-American, as I thought I clearly said. It's Peters who is saying 'no prisoners'. Thanks for the comment, I guess.
