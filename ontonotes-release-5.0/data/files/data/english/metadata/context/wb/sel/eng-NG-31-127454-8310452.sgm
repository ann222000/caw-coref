Am I the only one who finds it alarming that the good characters use
unforgivable curses severally in the book? Harry uses Imperius a
couple of times and the Cruciatus curse, Prof McGonagall uses imperius
and Molly apparently uses the AK? And after we told that its wrong to
fight evil with evil, remember Crouch? What do u all think?

No.

The Imperius curses were used for &quot;the Greater Good&quot;, so to speak, by Harry
and McGonagall. The Cruciatus was indeed &quot;more unforgivable&quot;, compared to
the others, but Harry was under extreme provocation.

In GoF it's mentioned that Barty Crouch Sr. authorised the use of
Unforgivables by Auror, during the first War with Voldemort. Presumably
after his &quot;downfall&quot; at Godric's Hollow, the authorisation was withdrawn.
In which case the use of these curses by Harry and McGonagall would have
been illegal. That subsequently neither got a life-term in Azkaban proves
that the extenuating circumstances and their overall contribution to
the &quot;greater good&quot; was taken into account.

As far as I could make out, Molly doesn't seemed to have used the Killing
curse.

Your argument is a contentious one. Someone must ask this question to
Rowling when she next consents for an interview.

Sorry - but this is war. It appears that those unforgivables are the
tools of war - and in war - it is the right of a person to protect
himself - on either side. If someone pointed a wand at you, you are now
able to use whatever means to defend yourself.

Then what's the point in labelling them as &quot;unforgiveable&quot; if, every now and

It has to be one or the other. It can't be both.

Yes it can be both.

Murdering and Killing are not the same thing in society. One can kill in
self defense - including war. In a war - the killing is justified BY THE
WAR ITSELF. However - killing for no reason or no good(as defined by
that society) reason is unforgivable.

So - what is unacceptable and unforgivable in normal society is
different in a war. In a war - the elimination of the &quot;EVIL&quot; is
considered &quot;good&quot;.

Remember - the MOM is setting rules (Such as what is unforgivable) in
normal life. While it would be nice if one side could set rules that the
OTHER side MUST follow in a war - but somehow I don't think that is likely.

True, but it is good that the good side doesn't go throwing them around like
the death eaters.  I think the only curses the DE's know are the
unforgivable ones.  In the few instances that they did occur, they were
necessary.  Harry actually imperius cursed a death eater for the death
eater's own safety, so I don't count that as being bad.  What else could he
have done to the guy to get him out of the way?  He imperiused a goblin to
find a horcrux, again...no real other way to get that horcrux which,
obviously was a necessity.  So, while the imperius curse was used, it wasn't
used maliciously.  Now, as for crucio by Harry on Bellatrix and I'm
blanking, but I think maybe someone else...at least he didn't kill them and
sorry, but after what that bitch Bellatrix had done, I'd say he restrained
himself pretty well.  It was war and things were chaotic.  As for Molly
AK'ing Bellatrix...again, she was defending three girls, one of whom was her
only daughter.  I can see how she may have gotten carried away.  I doubt
that that had we seen later into the course of events that the ministry
would have cared that they were used on the evil doers in self defense,
especially when the imperius wasn't used to hurt anyone or cause evil things
to be done.  Just my two cents.

In this case, 'unforgivable' really applies to the fact that they can't
be blocked by magic, or reversed by normal magical means.  The Imperius
can be thrown off by some particularly strong wizards and witches, but
nothing either blocks or reverses the other two.

Who's writing the Laws in DH? That's right! The Bad Guys! And how do you
defeat the bad guys? By staying one step ahead of them. They throw a fist,
you pull out a knife. They pull out a knife, you pull out a gun. With
Voldemort in charge the law is meaningless.

And, I'm sorry, but where did you get the impression that Molly AKed Bella?
It said she hit her with a curse, not the AK. I'm guessing there are other
curses that can kill. The supposed difference with AK is that it's supposed
to be impossible to defend against it (which makes a person wonder how a
sofa cushion can stop it but what do I know...I'm just a muggle....)

Yes, it is because its effects aren't obvious, so it has more potential

I agree.  There is no real outward sign, if it is done right, and can
force a person to do great harm to others, or himself, or to society as
a whole.  AK kills one person, Crucio causes temporary pain, but Imperio
can have widespread effects on society, as well as the person who is
the victim of it.

Okay, there is the Avada Kedavra, which is the inescapable and

potentially fatal curse a wizard can use.  I think Molly's curse
worked so well because she hit Bellatrix in just the right place with
it. (I CHEERED when Bellatrix got hit, and I like it that it was Molly
who finished her off.) Think of it kind of like a dagger--you can
WOUND a person by  sticking a dagger into almost any part of their
body, but the wound won't necessarily be fatal unless it's used on the
right part of the body, such as the head or the heart, and with enough
killing force behind it.

I did find it a little disturbing that Harry used Cruciatus curse
against Amycus when he could have simply stunned him. But after
killing off Voldemort and making the wizarding world safe again, does
anyone really think he was going to end up in Azkaban for it? And
McGonagall could have accio'd the two wands and she and Harry could
have rendered the Carrows helpless without  using Unforgivable Curses.
The Carrows though, only got as good as they gave. I can't make my
heart bleed terribly hard for them. Lord onlly knows what outrages
McGonagall had had to spend months putting up with at Hogwarts from
the two of them.

&gt;&gt; Sorry - but this is war. It appears that those unforgivables are the
&gt;&gt; tools of war - and in war - it is the right of a person to protect
&gt;&gt; himself - on either side. If someone pointed a wand at you, you are now
&gt;&gt; able to use whatever means to defend yourself.

&gt;Then what's the point in labelling them as &quot;unforgiveable&quot; if, every now and
&gt;then, they *are* forgiveable?

&gt;It has to be one or the other. It can't be both.
">

I believe it can be both, but circumstances must dictate it.

For example:
If I am walking down the street, and I take a pistol ans shoot someone
through the heart, they will die, and I am guilty of murder.

However, If I am involved in a battle with like armed combatants, and
I shoot one through the heart, he dies, but that is not murder.

It is a subtle difference, but a difference none the less.

However even if it was the AK, Molly is defending her only daughter, a
close friend of her son, and a friend of her son.  How many mothers
would not fight to the death, their death or their opponents death.

We have no certain mention that Molly used the AK, until JKR confirms
or denies it.

The point is that the Ministry of Magic is a terribly flawed
organization.  JKR showed us that time and time again.  The wrongful
imprisonment of Stan Shunpike et.al, so they'd look srong in the fight
against LV. The fact that they forced the Daily Prophet to not print
anything important. Hiding mass breakouts.  Tracing young wizards so
they can't do magic - hence limiting only muggle-borns, and not wizard-
borns (the trace only senses the presence of magic, not who performed
it).  I could go on and on.  They were the ones who stupidly defined
them as unforgivable.

I think the real truth, is that the use of at least 2 of the 3 curses
is absolutely forgivable under certain circumstances - self defense,
and the effort to rid the world of the most evil wizard known.  I'm
not sure I think the cruciatus curse is ever truely forgivable,
though.  Maybe, maybe not. Even with my ambivalent feelings, I shed no
tears, nor held it against Harry when he used it against the Carrows
(in part because it was just momentary - if he'd gotten pleasure out
of it, or had gone on and one so that it was actual torture, instead
of just the equivalent of a severe punch in the face)

I think the Imperius curse is absolutely more unforgivable than the
sectumsempra (which is basically the wielding of a magical knife).

The imperius curse allows you to control another person *completely*.
That person will do anything you tell it to. Kill little children.
Drown themselves, open fire on a crowd with the wand equivalent of an
AK-47 all without anyone knowing they've been imperiused, and without
even remembering it.

I would entertain arguements however, that sectumsempra should be
considered a 4th unforgivable, but I'm not sure I agree that a curse
is always unforgivable.

All the enemies where using it and the good guys where only trying to knock

Harry was Public Enemy #1.  He was robbing a bank.  I don't think
anyone care whether he was using unforgivable curses.  And then, the
battle.  People were getting killed left and right.   If the someone
is using AK on your people, it's sort of okay to use AK on them.  The
rules of war are different than of peace.  If the good guys just stood
there and took it, would that be okay?

Of course it´s acceptable to kill in self-defense; I don´t object at
all (at least in theory - I never did it to anyone, nor do I want to.)
&quot;Just standing there and taking it&quot; means anhillation for your side.

But my point was that the &quot;good guys&quot; ALWAYS win, since history is
later changed to suit the victors and present them as good!

Had Harry been killed while robbing Gringotts, what do you think the
Ministry-controlled Daily Prophet would print?

&quot;Undesirable #1, an unbalanced teen, killed while robbing bank&quot;
OR
&quot;Chosen one felled while trying to free us all from LV&quot; ?

There is a (true, IIRC) tale of a French paper in the times of
Napoleon that gave these headlines as he scaped from prison and headed
to Paris. Notice the change in tone:

&quot;The monster has escaped his cage but has no chance of setting his
dirty feet here&quot;
...
&quot;Usurper located 200km from Paris, all good citizens should denounce
and fight him&quot;
...
&quot;Dictator just 50km from our capital and facing resistance&quot;
...
&quot;Napoleon at the outskirts of Paris&quot;
...
&quot;All citizens hail the great Emperor as he retakes his rightful place
among us&quot;

&gt;&gt; himself - on either side. If someone pointed a wand at you, you are
&gt;&gt; now able to use whatever means to defend yourself.

&gt; Then what's the point in labelling them as &quot;unforgiveable&quot; if, every
&gt; now and then, they *are* forgiveable?

&gt; It has to be one or the other. It can't be both.

It's like killing in the muggle world. Killing have been historically
considered a capital crime [unforgivable]; but for self defense, killing is
not a capital crime [forgivable]. It can be both.

The interview on Mugglenet from the 30th doesn't say anything about

You are right about Umbridge's sentence not being specified, but I'd

I think the primary reason that self-defense killing is tolerated (and often
considered necessary) by Muggles is that there is no other alternative: you
must either kill or be killed.  With the advent of magic, however, I'm not
sure this still holds.  Is there any situation in which you really must kill
someone, if you have the ability to Stun them or place them under a full
body-bind instead?  I can't think of any.

Witness the seven HP books: only once does a good character feel the need to
use AK, and then only under extreme, extenuating circumstances.  Also
witness Harry's mercy at the beginning of DH: not only does he not kill
Stan, but he merely disarms him!  The presence of magic opens up a new
spectrum of possibilities for countering personal threats without killing
and, in some cases, without even causing physical harm.

(I can perhaps imagine that there some desperate situations in which the
only option is to use the Imperius Curse, so this one is—maybe—sometimes
forgivable.  As for the Cruciatus and AK, however, there is no excuse.  The
Cruciatus in particular has even fewer legitimate uses than the Killing
Curse.)

&gt; must either kill or be killed.  With the advent of magic, however, I'm not
&gt; sure this still holds.  Is there any situation in which you really must kill
&gt; someone, if you have the ability to Stun them or place them under a full
&gt; body-bind instead?  I can't think of any.

&gt; Witness the seven HP books: only once does a good character feel the need to
&gt; use AK, and then only under extreme, extenuating circumstances.  Also
&gt; witness Harry's mercy at the beginning of DH: not only does he not kill
&gt; Stan, but he merely disarms him!  The presence of magic opens up a new
&gt; spectrum of possibilities for countering personal threats without killing
&gt; and, in some cases, without even causing physical harm.

&gt; (I can perhaps imagine that there some desperate situations in which the
&gt; only option is to use the Imperius Curse, so this one is—maybe—sometimes
&gt; forgivable.  As for the Cruciatus and AK, however, there is no excuse.  The
&gt; Cruciatus in particular has even fewer legitimate uses than the Killing
&gt; Curse.)
">

I can see situations in which both are justifiable.  If the intent is to
capture someone, then a curse that can't be shielded against, such as
Crucio, can disable through a shield, and then on can use a non-lethal
spell to disarm and bind the subject.  AK is really like the use of
deadly force by the police in situations where their life is in danger.
There is often only a part of a second to respond to a threat, and
trying to shoot to disarm is something that requires one aim at, and
hit, a rather smaller target.  If there is enough time, and the shooter
is competent, this may be the method of choice, but when push comes to
shove, shooting at the largest target gives the best chance of living to
tell the tell, which is exactly why police are trained to shoot at the
trunk portion of the subject.  It is not unusual for 'shoot outs' to
expend thirty, or forty rounds during a few seconds, with only one or
two shots hitting the subject.  Massive adrenaline flows render most
people quite unable to aim a handgun with any reliability, so you go for
the largest target, and maybe hit that once, if you are lucky.
I have a friend who was shot twice in such a shootout, neither of which
was life-threatening, and he got off 5 shots at the suspect, wounding
him once.  So, about 10 shots were expended at close range (under 30
feet), and only three hit anyone.  That's really better than the usual
situation.
So, using the AK for Harry was a desperation attempt to save his own life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All is fair in love and war.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, Molly didn't use the AK, as Bella is still alive, and in prison
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for life.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry.  Didn't read that part.  On what page does it say Bella
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was in prison for life?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JKR interview on TV on June, 30.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You must mean July 30, right?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd like to see a pointer to this interview. I've read all I can find
&gt;&gt;&gt; online without see her say anything like that.  She did say that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bellatrix killed Tonks and that Umbridge is doing life in Azkaban.

&gt;&gt; sorry, too early in the morning....
&gt;&gt; I believe it was on Mugglenet.
&gt;&gt; Yes, Umbitch (ooops, Umbridge) is doing time, but I don't think it was life.

&gt; The interview on Mugglenet from the 30th doesn't say anything about
&gt; Bellatrix still being alive, and neither do any of the others.

&gt; You are right about Umbridge's sentence not being specified, but I'd
&gt; imagine she got life, if only for what she did to the Longbottoms.

What did Umbridge do to the Longbottoms?

Or did you switch subjects in the middle of a sentence?  Grin.

Sorry about that!!

Yeah, I had Bellatrix on my mind when I made that slip.  LOL
