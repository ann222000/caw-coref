If Earth expansion is correct, then the ocean floors grow *areally*,
i.e., the ridges grow *along* their length as well as across them.
This means that transforms grow by sequential emplacement, ..It also
means there is magnetic  'flip-symmetry' *along* their length as well
as across them

In order to accommodate this in Plate Tectonics, then subduction zones
similarly have to be either increasing areally (in which case the
Earth therefore expanding anyway), or the rate of swallowing has to
increase to meet simultaneously what is happening at the ridges  -
Another goalpost shift, ..and a grantuitous one

I document transform insertion on my site, but the flip symmetry is
one for the future.  That means going back to all the raw data, and
doing it again (all those ship traverses, ..eh??)

Both of them are ones to keep an eye on.  A simple working example is
the length of the spreading ridges around Africa compared to the
coastlines.  Plate Tectonics has no explanation for that.

Once again, nobody else has access to your inner monolog in which all
that made sense. You have to explain. Plate tectonics has no explanation
for what? How should the length of the spreading ridges around Africa
compare to the coastlines (of what?)?

One has to wonder if drugs are what makes DF so delusional, if his

Don is arguing that if the Earth were expanding, the Atlantic sea
floor must be expanding North-South as well as East-West. If this is
the case, the pattern of magnetic reversal on the Atlantic sea floor
would actually form concentric regions, not bands. Since it clearly
( http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/AtlanticAge.jpg ) forms bands, EE
is disproved by Don's own argument.

The Atlantic is getting bigger. Africa is not shrinking, if fact it is
starting to split with what will one day be a new ocean opening in the
Great Rift Valley.

And all this can be measured with millimeter accuracy. What we don't

by ignoring inconvient posts, you can say we do not refue EE.  &lt;BZZT&gt;

to expland the EARTH requires additional MASS.  There is NO KNOWN
METHOD of creating MATTER with anything less than ENORMOUS ENERGY.
E=MC^2.  that is how much ENERGY is required for MASS.  to add 10000kg
if natter reqyures a phenominal amount of ENERGY.  The QM theory forbits
low energy mass creation.

to explain that GPS accellerations signify motion.  GPS will give you
a coordinate.  by itself it will not show you ANY ACCELLERATION.  you
MUST know WHERE you are and Where you are SUPPOSED to be.  The
references do not give any RAW position data.  The frame gets involved
here because it matters that there is NO FUNDAMENTAL FRAME.  The EARTH
is a ROTATING FRAME.  Coordinates on the EARTH are ROTATING.  now which
accelleration are you looking at.

EE does not have any SUBSTANTIVE DATA.  The Atlantic Ocean is EXPANDING,
the Pacific Ocean is SHRINKING, and  SUBDUCTION at the Mariannas Trench
is nearly VERTICAL.  There is NO OVERTHRUSTING THERE.  and subduction
overtly refutes  EXPANDING EARTH.

a physical question.  HOW STRONG IS STONE?  say a planet is too close to
a massive body.  WHAT HAPPENS to the STONE?  It will deform and shatter.

what happens to the sea floor that carries away a mountain.  when the
SLAB flows into the Mariannas Trench, it turns at nearly 90 degrees and
descends. because STONE is plastic.  that is why we can see deformed
mountains that have stone that is BENT into horse shoe shapes.   why
would the sea floor not do the same.

EXPANSION of the Surface would tend to STRETCH surface features. it
would tend to FLATTEN EVERYTHING and EROSION is NOT FPLATTEING.

Transverse Faults have NOTHING to DO with the Mariannas, Trench amd
subduction.

Which part of this is NOT REFUTING EE.

Exactly.

Nothing to fuzzy about it. &quot;Toroidal motion&quot; is essentially fluid
dynamics speak
for  &quot;spin&quot;. The system of ridges and subduction zone are &quot;divergent
boundaries&quot;
and represent the source of &quot;Poloidal motion&quot;. What Dave did is simply
put
in the location of the ridges and subduction zones and set the mass
flux on each point
along the ridges and trenches according to current plate motions.

In one case he left the toroidal component out of the equations, and
in another case
he put it in. In the case where toroidal motion was allowed to
develop, the model
using no knowledge of where transform faults actually are, was
actually able
to generate the major transform faults approximately where they are
found on earth.

There is no &quot;tweaking&quot; of material properties in Dave's or my models.
We explored
a range of rheologies, however,  in each computation, the
&quot;lithosphere&quot;
has the same properties everywhere. We both use strongly non-linear
rheology
which in the appropriate limits can simulate the development of plate
boundaries or faults.
For all intents and purposes, plate boundaries are simply zones of
concentrated slip.
That aspect of plate behavior is well recovered in these calculations.

Which are transform faults.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And that's how transform faults arise.  .  (Something to do with
&gt; interaction bwteeen Stoke's Law and non-Newtonian viscosity)

What he found out, is that transform faults reduce the overall
disspation
(hence friction) in the system. Many phenomena take the path of the
&quot;least resistance&quot;. This is what transform faults do; they lower the
dissipation
produced by plate motions.

Indeed. Power-law rheology(at high values of the power law index)
can come close but they are not ideal; for that
Dave used something called stick-slip rheology, which for
some reason, you didn't mention. In stead you cherry picked the
blurb about power-law, since you imagine that it makes
your problems go away.

Stick-slip was quite satisfactory.
We don't expect power-law rheologies appropriate for the mantle
to work that well. If they did, then earthquakes should be occuring
all over
the mantle. They don't. Hence the rheology of the mantle changes
markedly as it cools to form lithosphere.

&gt; &gt; Transform faults is transform faults.  And subduction zones are
&gt; &gt; nothing of the sort.

&gt;    most of this is EE word salad.  you expose your ideological bias and
&gt; blinkd stupidity.

Time for bed J.,   Hey, nothing nearly like the word salad like this:-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---
&quot;Abstract. The purpose of toroidal flow, i.e., strike-slip motion and
plate spin, in
the plate-tectonic style of mantle convection is ENIGMATIC. It is a
purely horizontal,
dissipative flow field that makes NO APPARENT CONTRIBUTION to the
release of heat.&quot;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- --
You could almost be forgiven for not understanding what he
means, ..except it's crystal clear.  That's the geological starting
point:-  He says in effect, &quot;Geologically speaking, ductile flow of
the ocean floors makes no sense.&quot;  Then he goes on to say, &quot;If you
forget all about Earthquakes, and suppose this and suppose that, and
then plug in some rubber numbers, &lt;and get the OK from Stuart
Weinstein&gt;  .. then you can make transform faults (with no
earthquakes) look like frictionless partitions in flow bands.&quot;  &quot;And
you don't even need to bother about earthquakes&quot; (on transform
faults). &quot;You've got plenty anyway on the ridges where it's hot and
ductile, what do you want them on transform faults for?&quot;

That right,  Stuart?   I got it right first time, ..How did we go the
second time?  Or is Mr Policeman on your side?

OK, ..so taking you up on this bit - since you say &quot;Exactly&quot; and we
are in agreement therefore about what Plate Tectonics is saying here -
which is *_NOT_* the popular perception  (so you need to make if very
clear for the phalanxes of rubble arranged behind you), ...    THE BIT
you need to grip between the teeth is :-
---------------------------------------------
Sources and Sinks:-
If the source is the spreading ridge, and the sink is the 'hole' at
the bottom of the subduction zone, into which the 'Mr Findlay Slab' is
being wrestled to the concrete by Gravity
Weinstein, ...then, ..then, .. then there *IS* no need for any hot
centre of the Earth, to drive anything, is there?  The spreading ridge
(the 'source') is jus a bit of pressure reduction consequent on SLAB
PULL, isn't it?   Gravity does it ALL. .  Doesn't it?
----------------------------------------------

That means as Tackley, Bercovici and You say (following on from Mr
Uyeda since 1974) (&quot;The Gift that keeps on Giving&quot;) , ..that the
driver for Plate Tectonics is simply cooling.  Doesn't it?  In other
words, . the EARTH USED TO BE hot (when it differentiated into a core
mantle and crust) but now that it's cooling down, the crust is all
breaking up, the mantle is extruding and mountain belts are being
pushed up all over the place.  Because it's cooling.

Doesn't it?

So what's going on?  If the spreading ridge (= partial melting from
slab-pull) is the 'SOURCE' (according to you and Berco), ..what use is
it to convection for the EARTH to be HOT inside?  It's not necessary,
is it?   In other words the EArth is shrinking (because it's cold)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

by cooling, and when it gets to a continental margin it crumples the
crust into mountain belts, ... (because the cold slab (being cold )

You can roll all over the floor as much as you like, but you're only
making yourself dirty.  The point stands.  'IF - COULD' in the
hypothetical domain of fluid mechanics is no way to describe
geological reality.  Don't you think something about transform faults
SHOULD have been included?  Perhaps something along the lines of them
being where stress release is MAXIMISED, rather than as you say
*minimised.  ?  What Bercovici's saying there :-
---------------------------------------
&quot; Viscous drag acts to dissipate the convective energy used to
transport mass along the surface from a source (e.g., a ridge) to a
sink (e.g., a subduction zone). This dissipation is reduced, however,
by focussing the deformation between the source and sink into narrow,
essentially lubricated tracks or slip zones [see also Froidevaux,
1973].
----------------------------------------
&quot;...It is no trivial clue that the selflubricating rheology
(   GFIH ), which yields the most plate-telike focfocussing of
toroidal flow and viscosity minima into narrow zones [Bercovici, 1993,
1995], yields the greatest reduction in dissipation. These results
also suggest that convection models which permit viscous heating and
temperature-dependent viscosity may induce greater and more focussed
toroidal motion as the flow field attempts to reduce the net amount of
viscous dissipation [e.g., see Balachandar et al., 1995]. It appears
that strike-slip shear (i.e., toroidal motion) and thus plate-like
flows themselves are generated to minimize the dissipation of poloidal
motion and thus enhance the thermodynamic efficiency of the convective
engine.
--------------------------------------
..is a nonsense.  Transform faults are the means of *_MAXIMISING_*
energy dissipation, not as he says, minimising it.

It is crust.  It is solid rock.  They are fractures.  There are
Earthquakes.  What he's saying (and you)  is that transform faults are
ductile flow lines (in a fluid), lines of minimum stress
dissipation, ..not lines of brittle failure  (with earthquakes) (in a
rock)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Only for convectioneers who cannot integrate the real geological

heat of the Earth form in a line to give ridges?  Of course that is
not important in your model since the slab-sink (the sinking Titanic)
is the driver and the 'source' is merely a pressure reduction partial
melt going along for the ride.  So the question should be &quot;Why does
the cold subducting slab in the Pacific pull the whole of the Earth
apart at the ridges?

----------------------------------------
&quot;...Convection is the essence of the model of Plate Tectonics, yet
nothing intrinsic to the Earth's geology is necessary for it to work.
The Earth's spherical shape is in no way relevant -  the proposed
model of convection could be happening just as easily in a flat
bottomed pan.  The Earth's spin is in no way relevant either  -  the
Earth could be quite stationary for all the difference it would
make.   Not even the fact of oblateness, ..the first-order shape of
the planet due to spin, nor all the subsidiary geological structure
that is linked to this, is relevant to a convection model for Plate
Tectonics.  And the mantle could be porridge.  Any attempt to apply
the model to real, primary features of the earths crust and the
concept collapses with more holes than a Swiss cheese. Convection as a
model for plate tectonics is purely and wholly about thermal
difference, isotopes, their half lives, heat, gravity, Taylor
numbers, ..Raleigh numbers, ..critical ratios, ..Fourier's Law,
Buoyancy, thermal diffusivity, dispersion, wave attenuation, thermal
boundary layers, adiabatic temperature gradients.  All of which hang
together for the only and simple reason that they can be manipulated.
But plates, and spreading ridges and subduction zones, mountain belts,
back-arc-basins  etc etc, ..the geological reality cannot.   It would
be fair to say that virtually nothing of geological reality of the
Earth's surface supports it.  'Convection' exists solely because a
mechanism to drive Plate Tectonics is needed.  It matters not one whit
that this 'need' is manifestly  deficient in satisfying the
geological parameters.  'Convection' exists solely as a hypothetical
entity whose only redeeming feature is that it pays wages of those
nutty enough to involve themselves in it, and keep them out of the way
of doing real damage elsewhere.  Plate Tectonics' own stated position
at the time of writing is summarised in the current Wikipeida entry on
the web:- &quot;The driving forces of plate motion are (nevertheless) still
very active subjects of on-going discussion and research in the
geophysical community.&quot;    In other words, they don't have a clue.
They are going round and round in circles, because something
fundamental is missing - namely the geological reality of the
architecture of spin..  Convection is a concoction, ..a hubristic
invention in which nothing of the geology supports it and everything
of human manipulation and invention is brought to bear to validate it.

The model, although conceptually very simple, correctly predicts the

mechanism that has magical properties.

The world is plate tectonics, Don. Sorry if you find that offensive.

The model investigated several things,

1. Can fluid dynamical models concentrate deformation into narrow
zones, i.e.,
develop strain localization. Yes.

2. Can the correct toroidal field be recovered knowing only the
poloidal field
with highly nonlinear rheology. yes.

3. What is the effect of including the toroidal field? To lower the
overall
dissaption caused by plate motions. There is simply more dissipation
in the
system without transform faults. So that answers your question of
&quot;What transforms do&quot;..

You snipped the point about &quot;How and

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'm sorry. I don't recall seeing that in the paper under discussion.

And its no mystery either. Again, any basic book on convection
will discuss things like this. But you can't be bothered to read
any books on the subject; you spend to much time posting
pseudo intellectual drool on your website.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Why does the
&gt; heat of the Earth form in a line to give ridges?
">

Thats how convection works, Don. It concentrates heat into
into boundary layers that are much thinner than the convecting layer
itself.
As result a convecting system has much higher heat flow than if it
could
only lose heat through conduction across the entire layer. Since the
boundary layers
are relatively thin, when they destabilize giving rise to sheet like
descending and/or ascending
flows their surface expression is also thin and is line like. Other
convection planforms
may have plume like structures instead of sheets.

This is pretty basic information; you can find it in just about any
decent
book on heat transfer.

Of course that is

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I think in general that is probably correct; however it remains to be
seen
to what degree ridges are passive or to the extent they are
dynamically driven.
That subduction zones are dynamic is not in doubt; slabs are easily
imaged and
their buoyancy can be easily calculated. Seismologists have looked for
rising sheets
under ridges and haven't been quite as successful. This suggest that
maybe the ridges,
at least some of them, are not dynamically driven but passive.

So the question should be &quot;Why does

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So? What specific aspects of the Geology of transform faults
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would you like to see.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Earthquakes.  I don't see the word mentioned once in your reply - nor
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in Bercovici's paper.  Why is that?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Why is that?

&gt;&gt; Why is that?  Indeed.   *BECAUSE* this whole business of convection
&gt;&gt; driving Plate Tectonics is a furphy, and the paper is an excellent
&gt;&gt; illustration of the point I'm making, which is that 'ifs' and 'coulds'
&gt;&gt; are no basis for anything when the geological reality is omitted.

&gt;If you think that is furphy, one wonders what you make
&gt;of &quot;matter generation&quot;.

&gt;The model, although conceptually very simple, correctly predicts the
&gt;locations of the major
&gt;transform faults. Such explanatory power is not even remotely possible
&gt;with a theory that  has no unambiguous measurements going for it
&gt;and relies on obfuscations and a putative matter generation
&gt;mechanism that has magical properties.

&gt;EE is like something out of  a bad science fiction novel.

&gt;&gt; &gt; ROFL. This model wasn't trying to model earthquakes, it was trying to
&gt;&gt; &gt; determine
&gt;&gt; &gt; if given the correct the poloidal field, could nonliner behavior of
&gt;&gt; &gt; the Earth's lithosphere
&gt;&gt; &gt; give the correct location of the prinicple transform faults. It did
&gt;&gt; &gt; exaclty that, even though
&gt;&gt; &gt; no information was supplied to the model regarding anything about
&gt;&gt; &gt; transform faults.

&gt;&gt; You can roll all over the floor as much as you like, but you're only
&gt;&gt; making yourself dirty.  The point stands.  'IF - COULD' in the
&gt;&gt; hypothetical domain of fluid mechanics is no way to describe
&gt;&gt; geological reality.

&gt;FUnny. Then how come the trasform faults appear in the right place?

&gt;Don has no asnwer for that.

&gt;Don't you think something about transform faults
&gt;&gt; SHOULD have been included?

&gt;No. That would bias the model. The purpose was to see if the poloidal
&gt;field represented by ridges and subduction zones in a medium with
&gt;highly nonlinear rheology would generate the correct toroidal field.

&gt;Perhaps something along the lines of them
&gt;&gt; being where stress release is MAXIMISED, rather than as you say
&gt;&gt; *minimised.  ?  What Bercovici's saying there :-
&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------
&gt;&gt; &quot; Viscous drag acts to dissipate the convective energy used to
&gt;&gt; transport mass along the surface from a source (e.g., a ridge) to a
&gt;&gt; sink (e.g., a subduction zone). This dissipation is reduced, however,
&gt;&gt; by focussing the deformation between the source and sink into narrow,
&gt;&gt; essentially lubricated tracks or slip zones [see also Froidevaux,
&gt;&gt; 1973].

&gt;And?

&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt; &quot;...It is no trivial clue that the selflubricating rheology
&gt;&gt; (   GFIH ), which yields the most plate-telike focfocussing of
&gt;&gt; toroidal flow and viscosity minima into narrow zones [Bercovici, 1993,
&gt;&gt; 1995], yields the greatest reduction in dissipation. These results
&gt;&gt; also suggest that convection models which permit viscous heating and
&gt;&gt; temperature-dependent viscosity may induce greater and more focussed
&gt;&gt; toroidal motion as the flow field attempts to reduce the net amount of
&gt;&gt; viscous dissipation [e.g., see Balachandar et al., 1995]. It appears
&gt;&gt; that strike-slip shear (i.e., toroidal motion) and thus plate-like
&gt;&gt; flows themselves are generated to minimize the dissipation of poloidal
&gt;&gt; motion and thus enhance the thermodynamic efficiency of the convective
&gt;&gt; engine.
&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------
&gt;&gt; ..is a nonsense.

&gt;Just because it utterly demolishes your prime argument and I use
&gt;that term loosely, against convection is no reason to call it
&gt;nonsense.

&gt;If you wish to call it nonsense, then show all maths that demonstrate
&gt;it so.
&gt;You're a silly man Don, and an even sillier scientist, and I use that
&gt;term loosely.

&gt;Transform faults are the means of *_MAXIMISING_*
&gt;&gt; energy dissipation, not as he says, minimising it.

&gt;Unfortunately, the mathematics say otherwise.
&gt;You're simply wrong Don. And you can type
&gt;in caps all you want. You're still wrong.

&gt;&gt; It is crust.  It is solid rock.  They are fractures.  There are
&gt;&gt; Earthquakes.  What he's saying (and you)  is that transform faults are
&gt;&gt; ductile flow lines (in a fluid), lines of minimum stress
&gt;&gt; dissipation, ..not lines of brittle failure  (with earthquakes) (in a
&gt;&gt; rock)

&gt;Don, faults break and relieve stress and have slip. The surrounding
&gt;country rock doesn't have
&gt;slip.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It was a seminal and tremendous result.

&gt;&gt; Only for convectioneers who cannot integrate the real geological
&gt;&gt; picture  into Plate Tectonics.

&gt;The world is plate tectonics, Don. Sorry if you find that offensive.

&gt;The model investigated several things,

&gt;1. Can fluid dynamical models concentrate deformation into narrow
&gt;zones, i.e.,
&gt;develop strain localization. Yes.

&gt;2. Can the correct toroidal field be recovered knowing only the
&gt;poloidal field
&gt;with highly nonlinear rheology. yes.

&gt;3. What is the effect of including the toroidal field? To lower the
&gt;overall
&gt;dissaption caused by plate motions. There is simply more dissipation
&gt;in the
&gt;system without transform faults. So that answers your question of
&gt;&quot;What transforms do&quot;..

&gt;You snipped the point about &quot;How and
&gt;&gt; why the escape of interior heat becomes concentrated in certain
&gt;&gt; regions to form convection cells remains a mystery&quot; -

&gt;I'm sorry. I don't recall seeing that in the paper under discussion.

&gt;And its no mystery either. Again, any basic book on convection
&gt;will discuss things like this. But you can't be bothered to read
&gt;any books on the subject; you spend to much time posting
&gt;pseudo intellectual drool on your website.

&gt;&gt;Why does the
&gt;&gt; heat of the Earth form in a line to give ridges?

&gt;Thats how convection works, Don. It concentrates heat into
&gt;into boundary layers that are much thinner than the convecting layer
&gt;itself.
&gt;As result a convecting system has much higher heat flow than if it
&gt;could
&gt;only lose heat through conduction across the entire layer. Since the
&gt;boundary layers
&gt;are relatively thin, when they destabilize giving rise to sheet like
&gt;descending and/or ascending
&gt;flows their surface expression is also thin and is line like. Other
&gt;convection planforms
&gt;may have plume like structures instead of sheets.

&gt;This is pretty basic information; you can find it in just about any
&gt;decent
&gt;book on heat transfer.

&gt;Of course that is
&gt;&gt; not important in your model since the slab-sink (the sinking Titanic)
&gt;&gt; is the driver and the 'source' is merely a pressure reduction partial
&gt;&gt; melt going along for the ride.

&gt;I think in general that is probably correct; however it remains to be
&gt;seen
&gt;to what degree ridges are passive or to the extent they are
&gt;dynamically driven.
&gt;That subduction zones are dynamic is not in doubt; slabs are easily
&gt;imaged and
&gt;their buoyancy can be easily calculated. Seismologists have looked for
&gt;rising sheets
&gt;under ridges and haven't been quite as successful. This suggest that
&gt;maybe the ridges,
&gt;at least some of them, are not dynamically driven but passive.

&gt; So the question should be &quot;Why does
&gt;&gt; the cold subducting slab in the Pacific pull the whole of the Earth
&gt;&gt; apart at the ridges?

&gt;&gt; What's your answer?

&gt;Well if you think about, you have all of this slab plunging into the
&gt;mantle in the Pacific, that
&gt;means counterflow has to be happening in the middle of the Pacific and
&gt;elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You should get  a copy
&gt;&gt; &gt; of Bercovici's 93 and 95 papers.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see you referencing much else besides the drool
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on your website.

&gt;&gt; Why would I want to?

&gt;Because the drool on your website is nonsensical.

&gt;  The essence of Plate Tectonics is taught in
&gt;&gt; schools and kindergartens, about colliding plates crumpling the crust
&gt;&gt; and throwing up mountains. It's on over a million sites on the web.
&gt;&gt; It's not rocket science, but the way that you portray convection as
&gt;&gt; gravity-driven by the 'sinking Titanic' [consequent on a &quot;source-sink&quot;
