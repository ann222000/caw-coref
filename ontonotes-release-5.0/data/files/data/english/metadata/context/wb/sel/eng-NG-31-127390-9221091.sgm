As a Canadian may I ask a presumably loyal American
- where else are illiterate questions like this taken seriously -
why you think turning your country into a god-crazed
intellectual wasteland is a good idea? It is, IMHO, more
than enough that religion should demand that one
take on faith propositions that are completely devoid
of supporting evidence. For religion to demand that
one should accept blind ignorance and stupid lies is
way beyond the pale.

On second thought f--- off and cart this junk over
to talk.origins. The regulars over there will be more
than happy to rip you a new one.

Rick, the American Maliase is the result of generations raised on
sugar cereals, junfood, &amp; soda.
Their minds did not develop maximally, and they were never too smart
to start with.

The disease has been rapidly spreading to other cultures.
One of the reasons for the remarkable innovation in early Europe was
the quality of the protein in wheat &amp; oats.
And one reason for the lack thereof in the Americas is the poor
quality of nutrition in maize.

But now, all over the world, they eat corn raised on petrochemicals.

Rick, and Day, as we Americans are not to smart anyway, you might take
a few things into consideration.  First, ours is the largest economy
in the world.  That makes us stupid?  Both of you go to bed every
night safe and sound under the blanket of freedom we provide for you
out of our own pocket.  As for the Canadian Rick, we missed your army
in Iraq, both guys.  You don't have to pay for military protection
because we give it to you, and you don't have to spend money like we
do.  So we are stupid?  Day, I don't know where you are from, but if
you come back with the eruopean economy is large, I'll tell you to go
to Normandy to the American cemetary and see WHY it is so large.  If
not for us, you all would be speaking German.  So before you jump on
how stupid Americans are, you just might wonder if we are stupid for
spending the money to allow you both to sleep safe and sound, without
worry.  Although, nobody wants Canada anyway.  Ken

I'm not claiming stupidity, altho there's plenty of that, but
neuropathology such as autism, ADD, ADHD, ICD, and as adults, drug
addiciton, depression, &amp; neurosis.

Most troubling is the less severe form that nevertheless produces
zealotry, a blindsidedness to downsides of proposed policy, and the
shrinkage of the common ground needed to support a republic.

And whatever the level of the sanity of the electorate and workforce
is, is it sufficient to meet the ongoing challenges of the
increasingly complex global market?

Day, well someone was claiming stupidity, and as I have A.D.D., you
realize that a lot of the people who immigrated to this country did so
because they could not fit into society in the country they lived it.
People with A.D.D. were attracted to the U.S because they are free to
say (no filter in their brain)  exactly what they are thinking as they
cannot stop themselve from doing it, which as you know, even here now
can seriously hurt your chances for moving up in society.  That is why
the high incidence of A.D.D. is in this country.  We are just now
reconizing it.  But here you are simply known as blunt. The medicine
helps to give you a &quot;filter&quot; that lets you think before you speak.
That is the reason we have a lot of people like myself who have A.D.D.
We didn't 'fit in&quot; anywhere else, and wanted a chance in life.
I have an grandson with Autism.  He is three and has be tested as on
the &quot;high intelligent&quot; end.  I do not know how he will turn out, but
he is at times affectionate, looks you in the eyes and talks to you.
He has the advantage of getting all the help that is available.  We
believe he will be a functioning man when he is grown.  That remains
to be seen.  But it has also been a very trying life for my daughter.
The rate of autism in boys in the U.S. (I wonder what it is in other
countries?) is now 1 in 93. (1 in 150 for all children together) In
the sixties it was 1 in 10,000.  Something has happened.  We are
vacinating them to soon.  The scienctific community has done study
after study and they swear there is no connection.  My daughter said
that in a week he had changed after being vacinated. We hope to have
an answer, but for my grandson it is to late.  We will have to live
with the fact and help him break out of that cage his mind is in.
As I said before, this Republic was really set up with a
&quot;meritocrocy&quot; in mind, as that is how you stop societies main problem
before it becomes a problem.  You do not have people with high I.Q.'s
sitting at the bottom with no way to move up.  That is a receipe for
revolution.  My belief is that it is becoming harder and harder in the
U.S. to do that as the wealthy have breaks ( I own or am a major
partner in three businesses) and I realize that this society has
become tilted toward the upper class.  That has to change.  My
Senators and Congressmen (or in one case Congresswoman) are all aware
of that as I am active in politics and have had many discussions over
this exact point.
As for drug addiction, that is a lack of disipline on the part of
U.S. younger citizens as they have never seen what their Grandparents
went through.  Life has been easy and &quot;idle hands make work for the
devil.)  Although I personally am agnostic, they need more disipline,
more work, and less time for &quot;Experimenting&quot;. I was on my own with
wife when I was seventeen, working full time and going to college.  I
had no time for all that, and I have no sympathy for the drugies.
Suffer, get through it, or go to hell as I see that as a choice not a
phsyical disability.
Depression and neuosis seems to be on one hand, expecting to much,
and not wanting to pay the price.  Depression follows.  Well, pay the
price, again and again, at some point our experience will allow us to
succeed.  I use the word experience when in reality are really our
mistakes that we learned from. A nicer way to put it.  We do at times
seem to have to much of all of these.  But America is still a
beautiful 231 year old experiment which has exceeded all the founders
dreams.  We are so unbelievably successful, it scares people.  We are
free, we help other countries with their problems, we give aid where
ever we can.  We have had our failures God knows, but Britain, Europe,
whom we bailed out of two wars, so not all has been a failure.  We
give help when no one else can or will.  The U.N. looks to us to be
the world's policemen, and we are spending money we don't have in
order to do it.  I worry about Social Security because it doesn't look
to secure to me.
The point I was making was both of you seem to be bullying someone
who doesn't really understand this newsgroup.  I still want to call it
a site.  But we try to help anyone who needs it and I really went off
hearing we were stupid when we have done so much for the world and get
back so little (I would like to say respect but won't) understanding
that we are trying to do good, though it doesn't always turn out that
way.  I told you to go look at the U.S. cemetaries at Normandy, or if
you are English in your country.  General Patton is buried with his
men in Europe.  We didn't come to conquer, or plunder, we came to help
and then left.  So while I do agree we consume to much suger (as I sit
here drinking a coke).  But the comment that we were never to smart to
begin with was insulting when we do so much and we ask for so little
in return.  If Britain, or Canada were in trouble, you know who would
be right there to give you all the help you would need.  But I believe
that in the end both countries really would do the same for us.  As
Britain did in Iraq, even though it is a sore spot for a lot of
people.  My advice in 2002 was to nuke Afganistan, especially the
mountains and then see if the Muslims wanted any more terror attacks.
In the end I believe it would have saved more lives and we wouldn't be
mired in this much.  I was told it was to much.  Turns out it wasn't.
Hell, even Alexander the Great thought Afganistan was crap.  He got to
the top of the Hindu Kush Mountains, looked back, and said, &quot;Boys we
won't be coming back this way.&quot;  I'm paraphasing of course, but he
said they wouldn't and they didn't.  A miserable place. But ending
this little sermon, I guess you would call it, don't call the people
who you depend on to make you all safe from really bad guys stupid.
That makes all Americans feel unappriciated and disrespected.  As I
said we give so much and ask so little.  And I have to pay for it.
Maybe if we didn't we could afford a national health plan.  I can tell
you this, we could not afford to build the U.S.S. Reagan aircraft
carrier, or the U.S.S. Bush, but we still do it for everyone, not just
for us.  Regards and thanks for listening, Ken

I did not answer your feeling troubled by the zealorty, a
blindsideness to downsides of propesed policy andthe shrinkage of the
common ground needed to supot a repubic.
I believe that had the Muslims not taken down two buildings and
crashed a plane into the pentagon, the zealortry would not have been
there.  They did it for the whole world to see we are weak willed,
knowing that a response was going to be criticised by people.  That
was why I said nuke Afganistan.  Then see what they thought.  If the
Muslim governmnts or clerics cannot see what is the safest course and
rein these people in, then more would come.  I believe that would have
been the end of it.  The deliberately picked Saudi men to do it, as
the royal family is close with the U.S. and their people do not feel
the same way.  They knew we would not blame Saudi Araba.  My first
thought was Mecca, not Afganistan, and just get it over with.  This is
a thousand year war, let's end it, one way or the other.  Fortunately,
I had no say in the response.
The reason the world sees us as split is because we have free speech
and to make news, the televisions have to create drama, and show
things in a slanted light.  They look for ratings not necessarily tell
the troops.  I have relatives in Iraq and some friends.  They email me
and tell me not to believe anything the news is telling us because
they lie.  Even Fox News, according to one man's opinion.
As for the sanity of the workforce and electorate to make
decisions.  I do not believe that we either do, or should.  The U.N.
should be the controlling forum for what needs to be done.  But, we
have such self-serving, unbelieveable votes there, if the U.N. made
the rule that to be in the U.N. every country has to have a overseen
democratic election of officals to be admitted to the U.N. and I
exclude no one.  Then you are not allowed in, you have no vote, and
you get no help.  If that were to happen, then the U.S. and Canada,
and Britain, Europe I believe would have no problem with accepting a
vote of the U.N. on what to do on world matters.  One country has no
business making their own decisions about what to do to other
countries.  This world is to small now.  There are people in the U.S.
that say we will never give up our soverigen rights as a nation to
protect ourselfs.  They are armed and they mean it.  But if the U.N.
were to do right, and pull together, in a generation or two it could
be done.  But we need more than just us to make decisions on war and
invading or blockading other countries.  That is not right in my
opinion.  But the U.N. has to show some backbone, and needs cleaning
up and doing it right.  They need to be fair.  More people were killed
on 9/11 than at Pearl Harbor and look what we did to the Japanese.  We
have shown restraint, but it is getting us no where fast.  Except 10
billion dollars a month further into debt.  As President Reagan said
once, 'I am no longer worried about the defict, its big enough to take
care of itself.&quot;  So, my reply to the balance of your questions.  I do
hope in the future we are able to discern the truth correctly and act
upon it, not for you and I but for our grandchildren and great-
grandchildren, and all the world's as well. Remember I fancy myself a
writer, so I am wordy. Also, apparently not that great a writer
either.  Regards, Ken

<POSTDATE> 2007-09-22T06:00:00 </POSTDATE>
i dont see that my advice on what the nation should do will be
followed.
I began working with autistic kids in 1963, but when I developed
ulcers, everyone believed it was caused by stress, and so I became a
shade tree mechanic. I was, frankly happier, and doubt really that I
was doing much for the kids.

But there is an increasing database to draw on. I called a school
nurse, at one of the Ozark hill towns to ask how many autistic kids
she had. &quot;none&quot;, Chris went on to say that there was one in the entire
district of 4000 kids. And when you look into it, across these
Arkansas Hill towns, the rate for autism, ADD, ADHD, ICD, and
depression is almost undetectable.

If you get out an atlas, and look up the small hill towns like Alread,
Bee Branch, Clinton, Deer, Eureka Springs, Flippin, Greer's Ferry,
Heber Springs, and so on thru the alphabet, the numbers just jump out
at you. *zero* rates of violence. Over 95% of the kids are tested,
which means that those who would not be, have some developmental
problem, are less than 5%. Dropout rates in the single digits,
attendance rates near 95% (developmental problems interfere with
attendance), graduation rates near 90%.

These schools still work the old fashioned way Veritas. i daresay the
Amish schools do as well. Their autism rate is 1:15,000. I dont think
any professionals claim to cure it, but we do know that kids sometimes
get over it on their own. But let me suggest a regimen with the best
shot of permitting a kid to recover.

In both cases above, the kids live in rural areas, often on the farm.
These communities dont have fast food outlets. In both cases, there is
no exposure to agribusiness chemicals or industrial pollutions. In
both cases, the kids get to spend a lotta time outside- which is not
only good for exercise, which we know is important for mental
development, but also away from indoor air pollution. The homes of
these families are not full of plastic shit, which we know outgasses.
They are unlikely to have wall to wall carpets, which just cant take
the dirt tracked in from field work. Most carpets are plastic fibers
that outgas chemicals into the air.  We know the Amish live without
air conditioning, and the shady Ozark woods makes it far less needed
as well.

The small schools dont have nearly the rate of pathogens because a flu
bug or whatever runs out of new victims before it can mutate into
another strain. The hominids evolved over the course of the last few
million years in small groups. Native Europeans in villages of
150-300, Africans in tribes of 75-150, others somewhere in the range.
Immune systems just cant handle all the colds, flus, and other bugs,
and autism is one of the results.

And all of this is getting worse; the cities are bigger, the number of
chemicals greater, the varieties of pathogens increasing, and both are
dispersing faster thru a population that is increasingly pathological.
The whole thing is headed for systemic collapse on a global scale. If
global warming affects the weather to cause crop failures, the crash
will be within 90 days. The global grain supply is less than that
now.

You do not want to be in a major metro area if that happens. Wallace,
in his anthro classic, &quot;Culture &amp; Personality&quot; said that when a system
is on the skids, and people's coping skills dont work so well anymore,
they engage in &quot;magical thinking&quot;. Thus the Fundies await &quot;The
Rapture&quot;, and raise a stink about evolution.

No they don't, the Canadian tar sands are not worth having to drink
dark beer all the times.  No people on this earth are strong enough to
having a all night drunk,then standing on the first tee at 7:30 A.M.
with the Canadians yelling for a Guiness before they tee off. Then
telling them just to bring us one every hole. It's just not worth it.
There has to be an easier way. Regards, Ken

&gt; If you get out an atlas, and look up the small hill towns like Alread,

&gt; which means that those who would not be, have some developmental
&gt; problem, are less than 5%. Dropout rates in the single digits,
&gt; attendance rates near 95% (developmental problems interfere with
&gt; attendance), graduation rates near 90%.

&gt; These schools still work the old fashioned way Veritas. i daresay the
&gt; Amish schools do as well. Their autism rate is 1:15,000. I dont think
&gt; any professionals claim to cure it, but we do know that kids sometimes
&gt; get over it on their own. But let me suggest a regimen with the best
&gt; shot of permitting a kid to recover.

&gt; In both cases above, the kids live in rural areas, often on the farm.
&gt; These communities dont have fast food outlets. In both cases, there is
&gt; no exposure to agribusiness chemicals or industrial pollutions. In
&gt; both cases, the kids get to spend a lotta time outside- which is not
&gt; only good for exercise, which we know is important for mental
&gt; development, but also away from indoor air pollution. The homes of
&gt; these families are not full of plastic shit, which we know outgasses.
&gt; They are unlikely to have wall to wall carpets, which just cant take
&gt; the dirt tracked in from field work. Most carpets are plastic fibers
&gt; that outgas chemicals into the air.  We know the Amish live without
&gt; air conditioning, and the shady Ozark woods makes it far less needed
&gt; as well.

&gt; The small schools dont have nearly the rate of pathogens because a flu
&gt; bug or whatever runs out of new victims before it can mutate into
&gt; another strain. The hominids evolved over the course of the last few
&gt; million years in small groups. Native Europeans in villages of
&gt; 150-300, Africans in tribes of 75-150, others somewhere in the range.
&gt; Immune systems just cant handle all the colds, flus, and other bugs,
&gt; and autism is one of the results.

&gt; And all of this is getting worse; the cities are bigger, the number of

&gt; The whole thing is headed for systemic collapse on a global scale. If
&gt; global warming affects the weather to cause crop failures, the crash

its one in 15,000 not 150,000. but still remarkably low.

http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=702&amp;id;=154472007
http://www.countrydoctor.co.uk/precis/precis%20-%20Vaccines,%20winner...

I saw a UCTV presentation where the researcher said she knew of 24
autism markers. From her comments, and websites like the above, it
looks like both infection and vaccination are risks. But I dont think
the problem is just better diagnostics.

I got polio in 1946, thrown in a hospital with 600 kids suffering all
kinds of physical and mental disorders. I now know the body language
of autism, and I know it was not there. Nor was it in the special
schools I was sent to. The first cases I saw were in 1963; by then I'd
also been a camp counselor, and never saw an autistic kid in camp
either.

All these initial cases I saw were Jewish boys. All the low rate areas
above are family farms, the Jewish boys are all urban. The farm kids
eat out of home grown gardens. This particular generation of Jewish
mothers, with the Halocaust fresh in mind, abandoned shopping at the
deli, and switched to veggies from the supermarket, which had just
begun to get them from agribusiness.

Another area of high autism are the Hindu villages downwind of Indian
cotton plantation crop dusters. The low rates seen above are from
small country schools with lower rates of flus, colds, bronchitus,
etc. The lower rate kids spend more time outside. And they do it in a
more diverse and clean local ecosystem. Part of autism is a
disconnection with reality. It is just not interesing enough. But let
a kid play in a creek. Oh my. My Ozark home had one 75foot behind the
house, and the kids would play in the water and mud all day, every
day, all summer. The bugs, minnows, frogs, mud, stones, twigs, etc-
not only could they see it, like on tv, but they could, and did, pick
it up for *tactile* input. which urban kids dont get nearly enuf of.
The natural world gets their *attention* innately, and with that,
makes them connect with the rest of us.

Both the Amish and the Farm kids come from settings with large
families. Or in my case, we all lived within walking distance, so the
kids didnt need to wait for someone to drive them to a play mate. Our
kids slept over at each other's houses all the time. (we had lice
outbreaks on that account). But from toddlerhood on, there was a lot
more contact with peers than in the standard nuclear family household
today with only 1-2 kids in it.

This fits with a million years of hominid evolution. We didnt see
spoiled brats either. A neighbor boy, who *never* went to school,
nevertheless learned to read, was often at my house looking at &quot;The
Mother Earth News&quot; or computer magazines, and age 14, when he found
out about the GED, studied for the test, passed it, and entered
college at 16. Last I knew, he had a BS in chemistry. He had a lot of
autistic characteristics, but became a geek instead. The Jewish boys I
knew would've become geeks.

More important to me than having a years worth of food stored is a
garden that is producing it now. It dont take that much land if you
know what you are doing. The Irish, before the potato famine, had
1/20th of an acre/person. But even just 1/4 acre, properly managed,
can provide complete nutrition indefinately.

One of the above websites mentions trace mineral supplements. this
comes automatically from good ground. Hominids evolved getting the
trace minerals from what we now call 'organically' grown veggies. The
studies of trace factors in the diet and neurotransmitters for optimal
mental development are irrefutable.

Small communities have lower rates of pathogen passage among the kids,
and the pathogen risk is proven too. The good news is that broadband
can be had with a dish in the boonies, which is what I have. It can be
used to run a global business. My eldest daughter has a website up
'starlight designs' selling her glass bead work from, appropriately
enough, &quot;Ozone Arkansas&quot;.  Her eldest just graduated from a full
scholarship at an Arkansas State prep school. The 2nd looks like she
will go into the glass bead business with her mom. The youngest, 5yr,
is such a trophy blonde it wont matter if she's smart.

Moving to the boonies is economically feasible, but that's a whole
nother thread. If you send me some bio data on what fields she is
interested in, I can provide some specific feedback. There are a
number of different areas with new advantages that have largely gone
ignored by urbanites.

&gt; &gt; &gt; that outgas chemicals into the air.  We know the Amish live without
&gt; &gt; &gt; air conditioning, and the shady Ozark woods makes it far less needed
&gt; &gt; &gt; as well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The small schools dont have nearly the rate of pathogens because a flu
&gt; &gt; &gt; bug or whatever runs out of new victims before it can mutate into
&gt; &gt; &gt; another strain. The hominids evolved over the course of the last few
&gt; &gt; &gt; million years in small groups. Native Europeans in villages of
&gt; &gt; &gt; 150-300, Africans in tribes of 75-150, others somewhere in the range.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Immune systems just cant handle all the colds, flus, and other bugs,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and autism is one of the results.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And all of this is getting worse; the cities are bigger, the number of
&gt; &gt; &gt; chemicals greater, the varieties of pathogens increasing, and both are
&gt; &gt; &gt; dispersing faster thru a population that is increasingly pathological.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The whole thing is headed for systemic collapse on a global scale. If
&gt; &gt; &gt; global warming affects the weather to cause crop failures, the crash
&gt; &gt; &gt; will be within 90 days. The global grain supply is less than that
&gt; &gt; &gt; now.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You do not want to be in a major metro area if that happens. Wallace,
&gt; &gt; &gt; in his anthro classic, &quot;Culture &amp; Personality&quot; said that when a system
&gt; &gt; &gt; is on the skids, and people's coping skills dont work so well anymore,
&gt; &gt; &gt; they engage in &quot;magical thinking&quot;. Thus the Fundies await &quot;The
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rapture&quot;, and raise a stink about evolution.

&gt; &gt; Are you positive about those numbers?  My grandson who is three has
&gt; &gt; Autism.  My daughter swears that in a week after he was given his
&gt; &gt; immunity shots, he changed.  The scientific community swears they have
&gt; &gt; don test after test and there is no correlation between the shots and
&gt; &gt; Autism.  I have alway suspected plastic myself.  But the number you
&gt; &gt; quote: 1:150,000, where are these number from that you speak of.  The
&gt; &gt; current numbers for all boys are now 1:93 is what I see.  Are you
&gt; &gt; talking about in the small communities?  I am going to show this to my
&gt; &gt; wife and daughter to let them mull this over, I just wanted to make
&gt; &gt; sure that I understand your numbers.  If you Ok it, I'll show them
&gt; &gt; this.  As from the system collapsing, remember to know where the
&gt; &gt; mormons in your area live.  They have a years supply of food stored.
&gt; &gt; That might be important to your family.  Regards, Ken

&gt; its one in 15,000 not 150,000. but still remarkably low.

&gt; I saw a UCTV presentation where the researcher said she knew of 24
&gt; autism markers. From her comments, and websites like the above, it
&gt; looks like both infection and vaccination are risks. But I dont think
&gt; the problem is just better diagnostics.

&gt; I got polio in 1946, thrown in a hospital with 600 kids suffering all
&gt; kinds of physical and mental disorders. I now know the body language
&gt; of autism, and I know it was not there. Nor was it in the special
&gt; schools I was sent to. The first cases I saw were in 1963; by then I'd
&gt; also been a camp counselor, and never saw an autistic kid in camp
&gt; either.

&gt; All these initial cases I saw were Jewish boys. All the low rate areas
&gt; above are family farms, the Jewish boys are all urban. The farm kids
&gt; eat out of home grown gardens. This particular generation of Jewish
&gt; mothers, with the Halocaust fresh in mind, abandoned shopping at the
&gt; deli, and switched to veggies from the supermarket, which had just
&gt; begun to get them from agribusiness.

&gt; Another area of high autism are the Hindu villages downwind of Indian
&gt; cotton plantation crop dusters. The low rates seen above are from
&gt; small country schools with lower rates of flus, colds, bronchitus,
&gt; etc. The lower rate kids spend more time outside. And they do it in a
&gt; more diverse and clean local ecosystem. Part of autism is a
&gt; disconnection with reality. It is just not interesing enough. But let
&gt; a kid play in a creek. Oh my. My Ozark home had one 75foot behind the
&gt; house, and the kids would play in the water and mud all day, every
&gt; day, all summer. The bugs, minnows, frogs, mud, stones, twigs, etc-
&gt; not only could they see it, like on tv, but they could, and did, pick
&gt; it up for *tactile* input. which urban kids dont get nearly enuf of.
&gt; The natural world gets their *attention* innately, and with that,
&gt; makes them connect with the rest of us.

&gt; Both the Amish and the Farm kids come from settings with large
&gt; families. Or in my case, we all lived within walking distance, so the
&gt; kids didnt need to wait for someone to drive them to a play mate. Our
&gt; kids slept over at each other's houses all the time. (we had lice
&gt; outbreaks on that account). But from toddlerhood on, there was a lot
&gt; more contact with peers than in the standard nuclear family household
&gt; today with only 1-2 kids in it.

&gt; This fits with a million years of hominid evolution. We didnt see
&gt; spoiled brats either. A neighbor boy, who *never* went to school,
&gt; nevertheless learned to read, was often at my house looking at &quot;The
&gt; Mother Earth News&quot; or computer magazines, and age 14, when he found
&gt; out about the GED, studied for the test, passed it, and entered
&gt; college at 16. Last I knew, he had a BS in chemistry. He had a lot of
&gt; autistic characteristics, but became a geek instead. The Jewish boys I
&gt; knew would've become geeks.

&gt; More important to me than having a years worth of food stored is a
&gt; garden that is producing it now. It dont take that much land if you
&gt; know what you are doing. The Irish, before the potato famine, had
&gt; 1/20th of an acre/person. But even just 1/4 acre, properly managed,
&gt; can provide complete nutrition indefinately.

&gt; One of the above websites mentions trace mineral supplements. this
&gt; comes automatically from good ground. Hominids evolved getting the
&gt; trace minerals from what we now call 'organically' grown veggies. The
&gt; studies of trace factors in the diet and neurotransmitters for optimal
&gt; mental development are irrefutable.

&gt; Small communities have lower rates of pathogen passage among the kids,
&gt; and the pathogen risk is proven too. The good news is that broadband
&gt; can be had with a dish in the boonies, which is what I have. It can be
&gt; used to run a global business. My eldest daughter has a website up
&gt; 'starlight designs' selling her glass bead work from, appropriately
&gt; enough, &quot;Ozone Arkansas&quot;.  Her eldest just graduated from a full
&gt; scholarship at an Arkansas State prep school. The 2nd looks like she
&gt; will go into the glass bead business with her mom. The youngest, 5yr,
&gt; is such a trophy blonde it wont matter if she's smart.

&gt; Moving to the boonies is economically feasible, but that's a whole
&gt; nother thread. If you send me some bio data on what fields she is
&gt; interested in, I can provide some specific feedback. There are a
&gt; number of different areas with new advantages that have largely gone
&gt; ignored by urbanites.- Hide quoted text -

Thanx Ken. Its too bad, but the professionals trying to deal with
autism suffer from group think just like everyone else.

But even if environmental and dietary changes dont solve the problem,
the small rural community is a much safer place for kids who dont fit
in the usual behavioral mode. i did 8th grade in 1954 at Lancaster MN,
pop 500, in a school that had about 30 kids at each grade level. 2 of
the boys were severely retarded, yet went to school with the rest of
us, and were *never* subjected to derogatory comments about their
condition. Nobody out there in the boonies was worried about being
&quot;kewl&quot;.

There werent so many kids that we didnt all know each other, and it
felt a lot like the kind of sibling care we see in anthro reports of
stone age tribes. There werent any cracks for kids to fall thru.

I dunno a lot about the rest of the country, but the Census website
did list a new class, the &quot;x-urbs&quot;. An extension of the trend line-
from the urban center to the edge of the city, then to the suburbs,
and now, further out. Going from houses on a single lot to those on
1/4acre, then 2.5 acres, and now 10,20,30 acres, with orchards and
stock raising added to home gardens.

I think autistic kids like familiar environments. But given the
chance, will explore so long as they can see the house. when the house
has some acreage around it, it can have a much wider variety of plants
&amp; animals to engage their attention. The uniformity of urban life is
just too boring. And a parent cant let the kid loose to play outside
because of all risks urban environments now pose.

The garden, orchards, stock pens also create a connection with the
adults, giving them a little more mental space to think their own
thots rather than constantly being interrupted by the clammor urban
life makes on our attention. For both adults and kids, there are the
more varied tactile sensations of contact with animals, plants, dirt,
&amp; rocks that go way back in our hominid evolution that is so lacking
in the sterility and uniformity of man made surfaces.

I would not be afraid to spank the kid either. the kid has a right to
know, that if you piss somebody off, the result can be painful. Pain
has been demonstrated to affect brain chemistry, and it works on kids
too. It tends to make an organism, be it a rat or a kid, pay
attention. It was SOP for tribal life for a million years, so there
are innate adaptations to it.

Twards the end of &quot;Collapse&quot;, Jared Diamond mentions the ongoing
construction in his Bitterroot valley of mcmansions, which is
contributing more to the local economy than the old line timber,
mining, or cattle business ever did. I see the same going on in my
neck of Ozark woods, and no doubt there's other scenic areas. However,
in view of the forest fires out west his year, folks may be looking
for other ecosystems.

But in any case, the boondox are not what they usta be. One of the
things that happen, is that when that money moves in, it looks for
local investment opportunities. As a result, the Ozarks is seeing a
new *increase* in manufacturing jobs to go along with the dramatic
rise in services- construction, dirtwork, daycare, healthcare, and
retail in the local towns. Income is lower, but then again, so is the
cost of living. 3 bedroom houses that meet HUD standards can still be
found for 50K. My electric bill from a rural *coop* runs 30$/mo. I
heat with wood, but even if I bought rather than cut my own, it'd be
less than 50$/mo.

Our ancestors heated with wood for a million years, and a lot of those
instincts on how to do that can be picked up on quickly. I bet even
autistic kids can get engaged in collecting sticks to burn in a
fireplace or outside fire. It is that innate.
All these seasonal rituals, firewood, digging the soil in spring,
planting seeds, picking food to eat, watching stock give birth, are
all so familiar to our ancestors that they will trigger innate
responses that engage kids in the real world. the TV just dont cut it.
And when they get engaged in the real world, they get engaged with
real people.

You'll havta check, but I see lotsa small towns that have ADSL to run
an online business or telecommute from. The satellite dish is always
an option further out, and its not that expensive any more.
