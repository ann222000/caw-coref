This is just a reminder that it is easy to segregate or discard all
messages that are crossposts to multiple newsgroups (and are thus likely
to be off-topic).  If you are reading GEN-MEDIEVAL, tell your mail
reader to send all incoming messages whose Newsgroups header contains a
comma to a folder (that you will create) called something like
Inbox-Crossposts.  (Or tell it to send these messages to Trash.)
Similarly, if you are reading soc.genealogy.medieval, tell your
newsreader to look for Newsgroups headers containing a comma.

During the past 12 hours, I received 55 messages from GEN-MEDIEVAL.  Of
these, 14 (more than a third) went into Inbox-Crossposts; these included
posts about politics and military history, but none about genealogy.
The remaining 41 went into Inbox-GEN-MED (because of a filter looking
for a To containing GEN-MEDIEVAL or a Cc containing GEN-MEDIEVAL).  Note
that this latter filter allows me to view GEN-MEDIEVAL messages grouped
together in threads, a solution for those who don't want their Inbox
&quot;cluttered&quot; with individual GEN-MEDIEVAL messages.

Sorry.  14 is more than a quarter of 55.  I was focusing more on filters
than arithmetic.

So why not switch to individual messages?  With modern mail reading
programs and tools, there is less motivation for digests than previously.
