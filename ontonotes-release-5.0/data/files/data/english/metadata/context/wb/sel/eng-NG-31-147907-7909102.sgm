'WHO'S YOUR CADDY' TEES OFF TODAY: Big Boi and Tracey Edmonds talk up
new film  -- by Kenya M Yarbrough

*Big screen comedy &quot;Who's Your Caddy,&quot; the debut offering from Bob
Johnson's Our Stories Films company, opens today in theaters nationwide.

The flick stars Antwan &quot;Big Boi&quot; Patton, Faizon Love, Tamala
Jones, and Li'l Wayne, to name a few, and is about a rap mogul named
C-Note (Big Boi) who tries to join a conservative country club, but runs
into fierce opposition from the board President.

Quite in the vein of &quot;Caddyshack,&quot; C-Note leads his posse onto the
green. The film is also executive produced by Queen Latifah and produced
by Tracey Edmonds.

In his third film, Big Boi, half of the Grammy-winning duo
OutKast, is trying to make his mark on Hollywood, but told reporters
that he hardly leaves music behind, even when he's on the set. Still,
the rapper said that he is working on becoming as big a name in film as
he is in music. Big Boi recently sat down with reporters to promote the
film and showed off his sense of humor.

&quot;Really, I'm down to play whatever,&quot; he said of his pursuit of
Hollywood. &quot;My dream is to play Bill Clinton in the Bill Clinton story.
Now that's challenging.&quot;

In regard to music, he explained that he never stops working on
that and was actually hoping to work on the soundtrack for this film.

&quot;I was working on music at the house while we were working on this
one,&quot; he said and explained that there was supposed to be a soundtrack
deal. &quot;But my record company and the movie company [went] back and
forth, back and forth, to where we ran out of time. They just couldn't
get along.&quot;

As for the film, Big Boi said that he hopes that people will head
to theaters today to check it out even though he says early critics
aren't giving it a chance.

&quot;There's a cool underlying story underneath the comedy. There's
been some misconception about 'cooning' or something,&quot; Big Boi said of
the critics. &quot;But I've got a legendary music career - 15 years and 50
million records sold. I don't have to coon. But now coming in and seeing
it - you can't judge a book by its cover.&quot;

In the meantime, producer and company partner Tracey Edmonds is
judging that the film will be a hit with the targeted demographic,
leaning on the fact that urban comedies such as &quot;Barbershop&quot; and Tyler
Perry's Madea films have done quite well.

&quot;Bob [Johnson's] initiative was to start first with urban
comedies,&quot; she said of Our Stories' plan to become a film powerhouse.
&quot;Bob wanted to create a household brand where when people come to see
our films, they laugh, they have a good time, and they feel good when
they leave from seeing one of our films. That's not to say that down the
road we won't segue into doing dramas or another genre. We do have a
direct-to-video division, and in that division we can do things cross
the board.&quot;

Edmonds continued that urban comedies are a financial hit in
particular because they can be done with a limited budget, so it was her
idea to have the first movie from the film house launched in the fall of
last year, to be a comedy.

&quot;'Who's Your Caddy' came to me through Queen Latifiah. I read the
script and I thought it was very, very funny and it had a lot of fun
characters and it had a lot of positive message. It's about uniting
cultural differences. That it was fun and it had something for
everybody.&quot;

Black Hollywood, and Hollywood for that matter, has their eyes on
the Our Stories company, as it was built on the premise of telling
African-American stories. Incidentally, the companies debut flick,
'Who's Your Caddy', has a white writer/director.
&quot;There are definitely a lot of eyes on the studio. It's
historical. It's the first time African Americans have had their own
studio; it's the first time that people of color can greenlight their
own films and decide what goes on the big screen. So, we have a lot of
responsibility and we want to do films with positive messages. But at
the same time, we want to entertain and make people feel good. We're
really trying to be in business with A-List talent, but also discover
some new talent and open doors for people of color in front of the
camera and behind the camera as well,&quot; Edmonds said, then defended the
companies' choice to go with a movie written by someone who, quite
frankly, may not be considered a part of the &quot;Our&quot; in Our Stories.

&quot;Our mission is to really make sure that our characters - at least
a lead or co-lead - is a person of color. Crew-wise we had a lot of
African American working on the crew; the executive producers, Shakim
[Compere] and Queen Latifah, are African American. One thing I don't
want to do is do reverse-discrimination against people who are bringing
projects in just because the color of their skin. I didn't have a
reservation because the writer/director was white. The story is
something that I think appeals to people of color.&quot;

&quot;Who's Your Caddy&quot; opens today in theaters nationwide. For more on

RECORD EXECS SEEK PRESIDENTIAL PARDON FOR MR. BIGGS: Chances are Slim;
Ron Isley Scheduled To Report To Jail August 7.

*With less than two weeks before his incarceration date for tax
evasion, Ron Isley hopes a presidential pardon will be his get our of
jail card. Def Jam record executives are using their marketing wares to
drum up support for an executive presidential pardon for the beloved
member of The Isley Brothers family and singing group.

Last September Isley was sentenced to three years in prison on
five counts of federal income tax evasion. IRS agents said Isley, 65,
who had pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot; on all counts, had assets in the millions
at the time of his indictment and had gone to great lengths to hide them
in different bank accounts and by signing them over to relatives.

Isley had unpaid taxes between the years 1997 and 2002 of $3.1
million. U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson in Los Angeles called Isley
a &quot;serial tax avoider.&quot;

Isley's attorney, Anthony Alexander, had argued that his client
deserved probation due to his frail health, citing stroke he suffered
two years ago and a recent battle with kidney cancer. Isley must report
to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, where due to his health condition, he
will most likely spend his time in a federal hospital.

Ronald Isley's career spans over 50 years, with countless
accomplishments and a legacy of uniquely American music that has
influenced everyone from the Beatles to Notorious B.I.G.

Isley supporters are urging his fans to call, fax or email the
White House immediately to help him stay out of prison.

ETTA JAMES HOSPITALIZED: Medical Problems Cause Legendary Singer's Tour
Postponement.

*Legendary Blues singer Etta James is reported to be in stable
condition in a Los Angeles hospital suffering from complications
following abdominal surgery.

According to an email sent by James' manager Lupe De Leon, the
69-year-old rock 'n' roll pioneer was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center this week due to complications from surgery performed last month.

Her hospitalization has caused James to postpone concert
appearances. Blues icon B.B. King and soul veteran Al Green started the
tour without James on Tuesday in Florida. James hopes to join the tour
in August. In the meantime, R&amp;B singer Chaka Khan is substituting for
James on the tour.

&quot;If it had been left solely up to her, she would have checked
herself out of the hospital and started the tour regardless of her
delicate health,&quot; De Leon said. &quot;However, her doctor advised that were
she to do so, it would put her at very great risk.&quot;

James is best known for her classic song &quot;At last.&quot; The three-time
Grammy winner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993,
and remains an active recording artist.

CHAMILLIONAIRE ISN'T CONCERNED ABOUT CURTIS JACKSON: Rapper Says Fiddy's
War of Words is For Show.

*When it comes to feuds, rapper Chamillionaire says words don't
hurt him. So he refuses to respond to comments made about him by 50
Cent, saying he believes the G-Unit star is just creating publicity.

Curtis Jackson - better known as 50 Cent - verbally attacked the
&quot;Ridin' Dirty&quot; hitmaker in a recent issue of Spin Magazine, accusing
Chamillionaire  of bowing to public pressure to censor rap music.

&quot;Let him (Chamillionaire) go sell gospel records, if he's so
f**kin' righteous. I can write around the curses if I want to, but you
can't
tell me to write around the curses.&quot;

But Chamillionaire says he is not intimidated by Curtis Jackson.

&quot;There are way more interesting things to talk about, besides beef
and dissing people,&quot; Chamillionaire told AllHipHop.com. &quot;I'ma leave that
to everybody else. There was a time where the hip-hop battle was cool,
cause it was lyrical or whatever, but now, its stale, people use it as a
gimmick.&quot;

NICK CANNON WANTS TO BE A DRAMA KING: Actor wants Meatier Roles.

*Most men want to get as far away from drama as possible, but for
actor Nick Cannon, he wants more of it.

The actor, rapper and comedian hopes his appearance in the
upcoming film &quot;American Son&quot; will make Hollywood casting agents look at
him in a more serious light, reports columnists Marilyn Beck and Stacy
Jenel Smith.

&quot;It's (the movie) something that's extremely dramatic,&quot; says
Cannon, who plays the lead character in the film. &quot;It's about a young
Marine and what he goes through during the 100 hours before his
deployment. I was excited about doing something few people have seen me
do.&quot;

Cannon said he went through three weeks of boot camp as research
for his role, but he said the most challenging part of the script wasn't
military maneuvers.

&quot;We actually shot this full scene with me naked. I didn't expect
to have to do that. That was interesting. I mean, I had nothing on at
all. But I'm kind of an exhibitionist anyway, so I kind of got over it,&quot;
he adds with a laugh.

Cannon's co-stars include Melonie Diaz, Matt O'Leary and Chi
McBride.

Cannon also hosts &quot;Nick Cannon's Star Camp,&quot; a reality series. The
show is about a youth group known as The Giggle Club, as they learn how
to be stars. It's streaming every Sunday on Nickelodeon's broadband
video player, TurboNick ( www.turbonick.com ).

MOTHER OF ALLEGED ASSAULT VICTIM SPEAKS OUT: Accuses Tony Yaya of Bad
Pattern of Behavior.

*As reported, G-Unit rapper Tony Yayo rejected a prosecutor's deal
in a Manhattan courtroom earlier this week that would have sent him to
jail for nine months if he plead guilty to assaulting the 14-year-old
son of Jimmy &quot;Henchman&quot; Rosemond.

Now the boy's mother, Cynthia Reid,  is speaking out against what
she calls Yayo's pattern of behavior.

&quot;It is reprehensible that rap artist Tony Yayo continues to deny
responsibility for assaulting, harassing and endangering the welfare of
my 14-year-old son whom he senselessly battered in March,&quot; said Reid.
&quot;It was blatant and vicious and illustrates Yayo's negligence while
proving that he considers himself above the law. It is also indicative
of a larger pattern of behavior by entertainers that do not hold
themselves accountable for being peaceful, respectful, and law abiding
citizens. I am certain that justice will be served when Tony Yayo stands
before a Judge next month. In the meantime, however, I will continue to
mobilize the community to support my son who has suffered irreparable
damage both physically and mentally from this horrendous assault.&quot;

Yayo, born Marvin Bernard, was charged in March with assault,
harassment and endangering the welfare of a child for allegedly smacking
James Rosemond on a Manhattan street. Yayo was released on $5,000 bail,
has denied the charges. Yayo's attorney Scott Leemon told The Associated
Press. &quot;It's not even a good offer for a guilty person, and Tony denies
the allegations absolutely.&quot;

The case is postponed until September to allow Leemon to subpoena
e-mails between Rosemond's Czar Entertainment and 5W Public Relations, a
New York based PR firm. Czar Entertainment is a management company
co-founded by Rosemond.

VICK PLEADS INNOCENT: Atlanta QB released without bond on dog fighting
charges.

*A November 26 court date has been set for NFL quarterback Michael
Vick after he pleaded not guilty Thursday in Richmond to federal dog
fighting charges.  Vick was released without bond.

The Atlanta Falcons quarterback and three others entered their
pleas in U.S. District Court while Falcons officials still decide his
fate on the field.

Vick is charged with competitive dog fighting, procuring and
training pit bulls for fighting and conducting the enterprise across
state lines. Federal prosecutors allege the illegal enterprise operated
on Vick's property in Surry County, Virginia.

Although Vick and the other defendants were released without bond,
they were ordered to surrender their passports, told not to travel
outside their immediate area without court approval, and cannot sell or
possess any dogs. Vick also was ordered to surrender any animal breeder
or kennel license.

After the hearings, Vick's defense attorney Billy Martin read a
statement from Vick that said, &quot;I take the charges seriously and I look
forward to clearing my good name.&quot;

R. KELLY'S 'CLOSET' COMING TO DVD:  New IFC deal includes saga's release
on home video as well as cable broadcast.

*As R. Kelly prepares for child pornography trial, his &quot;Trapped in the
Closet&quot; music video collection makes its way toward a full DVD release
on Aug. 21 via Jive.

As previously reported, the singer inked a deal with the Independent
Film Channel to air all 12 of the original &quot;Trapped&quot; episodes, which
will take place in the weeks prior to the DVD release.

IFC will also partner in the DVD release, and has assisted Kelly
in the filming of 10 new chapters.  The entire 22-installment series
will eventually stream on IFC's Web site.

The 10 new &quot;Trapped&quot; installments features Kelly portraying an
elderly man named Randolph, complete with a pot belly and a fake white
beard that nearly falls off mid-scene, as well as a preacher in a gray
Jheri-curl wig and garish orange suit, reports Billboard. Kelly's
Sylvester character talks business with a &quot;Sopranos&quot;-esque mobster who
is eating a giant plate of spaghetti, according to the trade.

As previously reported, jury selection began Friday in R. Kelly's
child pornography trial.

HAROLD PERRINEAU RETURNS TO 'LOST': President of ABC reluctantly makes
announcement Wednesday.

*Fans of ABC's &quot;Lost&quot; last saw Michael and his son sailing away from
the island toward home having betrayed the rest of his fellow castaways.

It was announced Wednesday morning by ABC Entertainment President
Stephen McPherson that Michael, played by Harold Perrineau, will find
his way back to the people he deceived when the show returns for its
fourth season.

McPherson reluctantly made the announcement Wednesday morning at the
Television Critics Association Press Tour in Beverly Hills. He had
planned to reveal the news this morning at Comic-Con International in
San Diego, but TCA critics pressed him to spill the beans early.

McPherson first played coy, stating: &quot;I've cast Don Imus on
`Lost.'&quot;
Finally, after continued grilling by reporters, he announced that
Perrineau will be back on the series when it returns in January.

He would not reveal if Michael's son Walt, played by Malcolm David
Kelley, will also be back on a regular basis. Kelley appeared in an
episode last season as part of another character's vision.

Based on the final scenes of the season three finale, it appears as if
&quot;Lost&quot; will begin its next season sometime in the future - following
several key characters who have somehow gotten off the island - and work
its way backwards for the next three seasons.

Earlier this year, ABC announced that &quot;Lost&quot; was renewed through the
2009-10 television season.

BLACK FIESTA BOWL STAR RECEIVING DEATH THREATS: He proposed to white
girlfriend on national TV.

Remember the Boise State running back who scored the winning
points in the Fiesta Bowl, then proposed to his cheerleader girlfriend
on national television? Well, he says he's hired security for their
wedding because of racial threats.

Ian Johnson, who is black, and Chrissy Popadics, who is white, are
due to be married Saturday in Boise.

Since his proposal this past New year's day, Johnson said he's
received phone calls, letters and some personal threats from people who
object to their marriage plans.

&quot;You take it for what it is - the less educated, the less willing
to change,&quot; Johnson, 21, of San Dimas, Calif., told the Idaho Statesman
for its Tuesday editions. &quot;But we're not acting like we're naive to all
the stuff that's going on. We know what's been said. We're going to make
sure we're safe at all times. It's an amazing day for us, and we'd hate
to have it ruined by someone.&quot;

&quot;It's really sad because a lot of people that are probably doing
it are the same people who were cheering me on,&quot; Johnson said.

A Boise State football spokesman, Todd Miles, said Tuesday that
Johnson hoped to put the matter behind him and did not want to discuss
it further. Popadics' family said she was not available.

At the Fiesta Bowl, Johnson used a &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot; play to
score the winning two-point conversion as underdog Boise State beat the
Oklahoma Sooners 43-42 in overtime. The Broncos ended their season 13-0.
