I know there must be a better place to inquire about this subject, but I
can't imagine a better group of people to ask.

A friend of a friend uncovered a buried treasure in their recently
purchased home. Evidently, they found 3 glass silver nitrate &quot;prints&quot; by
the photographer John K. Hillers. The size of the images is what is so
astounding, and it's hard to believe they've survived as long as they
have. They are seeking any information on determining the value, and
being lead in the right direction towards anyone who might collect (buy)
such imagery. Here's the snippet of the letter they sent to me (as a
moderate photography/silent film buff):

&quot;Chris,
Attached is a digital picture if the glass we told you about, It was
hard to get a good picture of it. The glass pane is 24&quot; x 20&quot;, the photo
is 22&quot; x 18&quot;. We took the picture to an antique appraiser, he could not
give us any idea of its value, because he had never seen anything to
compare it to. To give you some background on it, the original negative
was taken in 1871, on 2nd Powell expedition of Grand Canyon. The
original negative is now in the National Archives, but it is cracked,
all pictures that can be viewed show the crack. As you can see ours is
not cracked. You can go to www.usgs.gov and view a paper photo of this
picture,to compare. The photographer is John K. Hillers. If you go to
the sight I believe it is the 98 print  &quot;The Watchman from the Virgin
River&quot;, in present day Zion National Park. We will try to take a better
digital picture of our print.&quot;

Here's a link to the image on the usgs site:

,%20J.K.%20%20%2075

The Smithsonian offered to take their print as a donation, but that's
not exactly what they had in mind for it.

Here's a link to the image they sent me:

Any help in understanding what they actually have, and/or who to contact
about it would be GREATLY appreciated.

Thanks,

Yeah, a large tax deduction and a meaningful donation aren't nearly as good
as the untold riches most people expect from these things, especially when
they got them for free.

Or to put it slightly more politically for your friends -- get the
photos appraised (sorry, they'll have to spend actual money for this).
They can try to sell it for that amount, but it's unlikely it will
sell. Donate it to the Smithsonian, they'll give you a receipt, write
it off on your Schedule A, and bask in the warm glow of having put the
photos where they're most likely to be preserved for posterity.

Thanks for the advice, though I'm a trifle taken back by the negative
spin(s).

It goes without saying *everyone* here would donate LAM if found on
their property, right? Of course they would.

Much appreciated.

I'd put it out on DVD first THEN donate.
