Is anyone interested in seeing pics of the house we are building?  If
so, they are here:
http://picasaweb.google.com/badwilson/House
At this point it's probably best to scroll all the way down to the end
of the album and look at them backwards.  The newest ones are at the
end.
At this point we have all the painting done except I'm still working on
staining the interior doors.  I have done all the exterior painting and
Dennis did about 75% of the interior painting and I'm doing all the
staining of doors.  By the end of tomorrow I'll only have 2.5 doors left
to do.
Dennis is coming home on Thursday and we are starting to do the tiling
on Friday.  It's a huge job as it involves 2 bathrooms and the floor in
every single room of the house.  I doubt I'll get a chance to finish
with the door staining but I guess I can still do that once we're moved
in.
Other cool stuff that's done is all the kitchen and bathroom cabinets
are in and the lights and power are on!  The stone countertop in the
kitchen has been delayed until Friday and I just can't wait to see it.
The rangehood has to go in but so far there have been no days with no
rain (they have to cut a hole in the roof to vent it out).
The septic tanks still have to go in and a huge area of outdoor patio
which is going to be exposed aggregate (concrete with pebbly finish).
And the solar hot water heater still has to go up on the roof.  But
that's outdoor stuff and won't interfere with our tiling.
I have caved to the pressure of our rental agent and committed to move
out on the 31st of October.  So we have to make sure we get it all done
and moved in before that.  I'm vastly overwhelmed at how much work it's
going to be.  I've been working 7 days a week (3 at my job and 4 at the
house) since Sept 1st.  That was my last weekend off, when I went to
Cirque du Soleil in Perth.  It seems like a distant memory now.

What I've gotten done since then:

Stained 8 doors and 2 closet doors
Waterproofed 2 bathrooms
Sealed all interior rammed earth walls
Painted the back of the island and the side of the fridge cabinet in the
kitchen
Sewed bedroom curtains at home in the evenings
Cleaned the entire house top to bottom in the last 4 evenings
Finished my book club book (Cloud Atlas, good book but slow going)
Attended 3 evening social events
2 job interviews
1 vet visit for cat fight injuries (BTW, Vino is all healed up and much
better now)
Done my taxes and filed online

Whew!  And between all that I've been getting up earlier and earlier to
get more stuff done.  Like going grocery shopping at 7:30 am.  Not a
good idea.  Not inspired by foods at that hour and end up leaving with
practically nothing.  Have subsisted on soup and frozen veggies.
And I've gotten 1 speeding ticket due to trying to save time by driving
faster.  And today I backed my car into the newly delivered concrete
septic tank thingy.  Beginning to suspect that the paint fumes are
killing my brain cells.  Oh well, only a scratch on the bumper, luckily
no dents.
Might be going into lurk mode in a couple of days when Dennis is back
and we're tiling.  Most rumbly healing purrs for everyone who needs
them.

On the off chance that fumes are a problem.  You have power.  Buy a couple
of large fans to circulate the air.

You can never have too many fans later on anyway.

Wonderful to see your house taking shape. All the picture will be something
you can look back on. DH and I always take picture of the  yard work we do.

If I remember correct you are in Australia. Is it common to have a  solar
hot water heater  on the roof and a water tank? Are all your outside walls
concrete?

Yes, it is great to be able to look back and see it all come together.
I looked at your yard pics and thought you guys did a really great job.

">

Yes, it's fairly common around here to have a solar hot water heater on
the roof.  There are big government rebates too for having one, so it
really pays.  In the winter it wouldn't completely heat the water but it
would make it lukewarm.  We also have a system in place where the
woodstove would heat the water as well.  If all else fails, there is an
electric back-up.
The rain water tank is common in rural areas where there is no scheme
water, such as where we are going to be living.  It's only 8km from the
town but rain water is our only option.
No walls are concrete, it's rammed earth which is 96% sand and 4%
concrete and is compacted under pressure in molds.  All the exterior
walls are made of this, they are 30 cm thick and very solid.  This is a
type of building that is pretty common around the area where I'm living
(SW corner) but not all that common anywhere else.

Not possible.  The slightest breeze makes the stain dry so fast that it
becomes impossible to work with and it gets set in streaks and blobs
that look horrible :-(

Well, you might want to wait a couple of months until it's actually
finished ;-)  Actually, I've already got a friend who wants to visit in
late October.  I told him he's welcome but at that time he'll be helping
us move.  If he wants to relax in style in the new house, he'll have to
come in November!
Anyway, if you are ever coming to Western Australia, let me know and
you'll have to visit us for sure.

Incredible! You have the entire process fully photo-documented!

And the house is just enormous. It's really great how much space you
have. The kitchen is humungous!! You could host an episode of Iron
Chef. :) Also, I love the vaulted ceiling and recessed lighting. It's
going to be gorgeous. Can't wait until you move in. (Can you say

It's actually not that big.  2500 square feet and 3 bedrooms, 2.5 baths.
But they are all fairly spacious rooms and the high ceilings give it a
sense of space.
Having lots of room in the kitchen and bathroom has been my fondest
dream for years.  I just hate having to edge around Dennis when cooking
and having to wait my turn to brush my teeth.  It makes me cranky.
Living in this new house will be sooooo nice :-)

Which sink is that, the round semi-recessed one or the rectangular above
the bench one?
I got them all really, really cheap on ebay, BTW.  Got all the sinks,
taps, showers, towel rails and range hood from ebay.  It's amazing how
much money you can save!

&gt; The rain water tank is common in rural areas where there is no scheme
&gt; water, such as where we are going to be living.  It's only 8km from the
&gt; town but rain water is our only option.
&gt; No walls are concrete, it's rammed earth which is 96% sand and 4% concrete
&gt; and is compacted under pressure in molds.  All the exterior walls are made
&gt; of this, they are 30 cm thick and very solid.  This is a type of building
&gt; that is pretty common around the area where I'm living (SW corner) but not
&gt; all that common anywhere else.

I know exactly what you mean. Especially about feeling crowded in the
bathroom, first thing in the morning. That would make me very cranky,
too, at a time of day when I'm already pretty cranky!

And if the two of you cook together a lot, then having the space to do
so comfortably just makes good sense. I guess that's the beauty of having
your own house designed from scratch to suit your specific needs.

I felt tired just reading the list of things you've done! I'm actually
very impressed with the amount of work you and Dennis have completed
yourself. It's no easy task getting a house built, even when the
builder does the bulk of it, and painting is the most tedious of
jobs.Tiling should be more enjoyable though.

The house is looking great BTW and it nice seeing how it's all coming
together.

Yeah, we like to cook together so it will be great.  Also, we have
aquired a bunch of friends here who do the dinner party thing, which has
been a lot of fun.  Now we will be able to host some nice ones of our
own.
It is definitely designed to meet our specific needs.  I have the
computer area set up to be in the middle of the living area, able to see
the TV from the computer, able to see the TV from the kitchen and even
from the BBQ outside!  People think I'm nuts for not wanting my computer
in a seperate little office room, but that would be my worst nightmare.
I'd never want to use it!
And with the TV visible from the BBQ, there's absolutely no reason for
Dennis to burn any steaks anymore ;-)

Thanks Dewi!  Doing all that stuff ourselves, plus buying a lot of
fixtures and fittings on ebay has saved us about $40,000.  Without those
savings, we couldn't have afforded the house as it is.
I'm not sure about tiling being more enjoyable, it's a long time spent
on your hands and knees, hard on the back, hard on the knees.  But
Dennis got this really flash set of gel knee pads from Florida in April,
hope those help make the job go better.  And I think we might be able to
get our builder to let us use his cement mixer to mix up all the tile
adhesive.  That would be a huge help too.
I just found out that a friend from Canada is planning to visit at the
end of October.  I warned him that he'd be helping us move and gave him
the option of coming in November instead.  But he said he'd love to help
us move!!!  Yay!  He's 6'4&quot;, couldn't have asked for better help :-)

Sounds like good reasoning to me.  That's how my brother set fire to his
kitchen, trying to watch football in one room while cooking in another.
(And if I know my brother, talking on the phone and following another game
on the radio as well.)

Yay, that's the move sorted. ;) It all looks wonderful. Even here, on
the other side of the world, I can't wait for you to move in. And to see
Vino's new fursibs. ;)

&gt; Which sink is that, the round semi-recessed one or the rectangular above

&gt; I got them all really, really cheap on ebay, BTW.  Got all the sinks,

The rectangular one. Looove that one! What a great tip, I had never
considered ebay for things like sinks and taps!

&gt; I have caved to the pressure of our rental agent and committed to move
&gt; out on the 31st of October.  So we have to make sure we get it all done
&gt; and moved in before that.  I'm vastly overwhelmed at how much work it's
&gt; going to be.  I've been working 7 days a week (3 at my job and 4 at the
&gt; house) since Sept 1st.  That was my last weekend off, when I went to
&gt; Cirque du Soleil in Perth.  It seems like a distant memory now.

&gt; What I've gotten done since then:

&gt; Stained 8 doors and 2 closet doors
&gt; Waterproofed 2 bathrooms
&gt; Sealed all interior rammed earth walls
&gt; Painted the back of the island and the side of the fridge cabinet in the
&gt; kitchen
&gt; Sewed bedroom curtains at home in the evenings
&gt; Cleaned the entire house top to bottom in the last 4 evenings
&gt; Finished my book club book (Cloud Atlas, good book but slow going)
&gt; Attended 3 evening social events
&gt; 2 job interviews
&gt; 1 vet visit for cat fight injuries (BTW, Vino is all healed up and much
&gt; better now)
&gt; Done my taxes and filed online

&gt; Whew!  And between all that I've been getting up earlier and earlier to
&gt; get more stuff done.  Like going grocery shopping at 7:30 am.  Not a
&gt; good idea.  Not inspired by foods at that hour and end up leaving with
&gt; practically nothing.  Have subsisted on soup and frozen veggies.
&gt; And I've gotten 1 speeding ticket due to trying to save time by driving
&gt; faster.  And today I backed my car into the newly delivered concrete
&gt; septic tank thingy.  Beginning to suspect that the paint fumes are
&gt; killing my brain cells.  Oh well, only a scratch on the bumper, luckily
&gt; no dents.
&gt; Might be going into lurk mode in a couple of days when Dennis is back
&gt; and we're tiling.  Most rumbly healing purrs for everyone who needs them.

Lots and lots of purrs and best wishes for everything to go really well
and you'll be ready to move out on the 31st of October,
Polonca and Soncek
