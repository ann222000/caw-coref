Web search leader Google Inc. will sponsor a $30 million competition for an
unmanned lunar landing, following up on the $10 million Ansari X Prize that
spurred a private sector race to space.

Like the Ansari X Prize, which was claimed in 2004 by aircraft designer Burt
Rutan and financier Paul Allen for a pair of flights by SpaceShipOne, the
Google Lunar X Prize is open to private industry and non-government
entities worldwide, organizers said on Thursday.

First prize is $20 million for the group that can land a lunar rover – an
unmanned robotic probe – on the Moon, take it on a 500-metre trek and
broadcast video back to Earth by 31 December 2012.

The prize falls to $15 million if the landing takes place by 31 December
2014.

Im thinking something not unlike Iraqs superguns, firing a projectile at the
moon.  Once the probe hits the moon, Im hoping it will bounce the required
500 metres :)
Broadcasting viddy might be a bit of an issue though

Thought about it, but my landlord would probably take exception to me
building a moon rocket in my lounge.

My next idea was a matter transmitter, but I'd probably need a miniature
black hole to power the quantum computer needed to map every atom in the
payload. The landlord would definitely take exception to his flat
disappearing down a black hole if I made a mistake in containment.

If I can't get to the moon, then why not make the moon come to me? All
I'd have to do is increase the Earth's gravity by several orders of
magnitude for a few months. I'm sure everyone else won't mind not being
able to move for a while? If I gave enough warning they could all hook
up drip feeders in time.

I'm going to take my pills now...

yeah neat, add a parachute to break its fall a bit and your laughing....

;]

Actually I dont know if its that hard to do, PCS are way better these
days and the maths/geometry of getting to the moon well
understood....could be calculated in real time...

Launching, its going to be lightweight.....so why not use helium ballons
to lift a small platform to get it high into the atmosphere and only
give it enough &quot;engine&quot; to get out into space....I wonder how far they
would go up.....3 sets of ballons in a triangle held apart by a light
frame with a platform slung under neath and the unit fires up between
them....pc on board monitoring height and conditions....when its calm
enough light up....

Getting there could be slow, no bodies to keep warm....if it took 2
months at low speed, who cares......

As far as I can see the hardest part is actually the landing.....you
need to power it down....so its mass is important...

&quot;Driving&quot; it 500 metres....does it need to do 500 metres on wheels? or
could you make it &quot;hop&quot; using the landing motor(s) and a bit of crude
direction?

This would have to be rugged and cheap (if the first attempt didnt work
learn from it and do it again)....but its probably mostly off the shelf
stuff....

Lots of industrial computers would do/survive this treatment available
that were not about in the 1960s....and cheap as well.
