Microsoft will take aim at rival Google next week with a new Web
development plan.
The software company plans to open access to its MSN and other public
Web sites to let developers assemble new applications that build on
those sites--a technique used successfully at Google and at other Web
companies to promote their properties.

Microsoft will detail its &quot;Web platform&quot; strategy at its Professional
Developers Conference in Los Angeles next week, company executives told
CNET News.com. It intends to publish the application programming
interfaces, or APIs, to some of its public Web sites, including MSN
Search, and deliver better tools to write those applications.

What's new:
Ratcheting up the competition with Google and Yahoo, Microsoft will
detail at a conference next week plans to entice developers to build
applications that rely on Microsoft's MSN Web properties.
Bottom line:
Microsoft needs to address the rising popularity, among its
all-important developer base, of interactive Web applications that run
on public Web sites. Yet these efforts have to be balanced with
Microsoft's need to foster application development on Windows and
Office, analysts said.

The goal: to embrace the emerging model, often called Web 2.0 or the
programmable Web, where new applications are built using pieces of
existing, public Web sites. Rather than simply providing access to Web
pages, these companies treat their Web sites as a development platform,
much like an operating system. For example, a third-party developer
could write an application, or &quot;mash-up,&quot; that pulls location
information from a person's blog and plots it on a map using Google
Maps or a similar service.

But Microsoft has to walk a fine line, analysts said, by recognizing
the popularity of new Web technologies while still encouraging the use
of its cash cow Windows and Office products.

The move to lure more developers to MSN expands the competitive
battleground between the software giant and Google, a company it is now
competing with for developer mindshare. A Google representative wasn't
immediately available to comment. Acrimony between the two companies
has come to light in recent days, as they spar in court over former
Microsoft executive Kai-Fu Lee, who was hired by Google.

Microsoft's online rivals, notably Google and Yahoo, already provide
the hooks that let third-party Web developers write applications that
tap into their Web services, such as search and mapping. Because these
Web applications rely on a Web browser, they can, in theory, run on any
operating system.

Microsoft, meanwhile, has always drawn third-party developers to
Windows. But even with its commitment to Windows, analysts said,
Microsoft needs to more fully address the growing popularity of online
Web development. Having a healthy ecosystem of third-party add-on
products helps drive traffic to Web properties.

&quot;There are some real competitive issues going on, and (Microsoft) needs
to respond, not just with products and offerings for consumers but also
(with) compelling products and APIs for developers,&quot; said Michael
Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupitermedia. &quot;There's a recognition that
people are embracing the Web as a platform, and they (Microsoft) want
to be there as well.&quot;

Microsoft has already given developers access to some of its Web sites.
MapPoint, for example, has had a Web services interface for a few
years. But the company is ramping up efforts to make its Web sites
programmable and customizable by end users, mirroring the strategies at
Google, Yahoo, Amazon.com, eBay and a growing number of Web sites.

Opening up the Web store
At the developers conference next week, Microsoft plans to publish the
API to its MSN Search service, which can be used by developers through
the Simple Object Access Protocol, or SOAP. The noncommercial license
will let people produce 10,000 search results per day per Internet
address, said Seth Demsey, group program manager for MSN Search.
Microsoft will release an API for its desktop search as well.

Also next week, the company will announce a free commercial license to
use a JavaScript &quot;control&quot; to display data from its Virtual Earth
mapping service. The MSN Messenger group, meanwhile, will allow
developers to write Windows applications that make use of the
&quot;Activity&quot; window. This would allow a customer service representative,
for example, to display customer information in a chat session.

Microsoft is encouraging developers to write applications for its Web
properties because more and more applications are being delivered
online rather than run on a single desktop PC, company executives said.

&quot;We think we need to evolve the platform and development story to keep
pace with developers who want to build these experiences that reach
across the Internet,&quot; said Adam Sohn, a spokesman for Microsoft's MSN
division. &quot;The more applications, the more value to the user and the
more people gravitate to our platform.&quot;

While Microsoft is opening up access to well-established MSN sites next
week, it is also giving a sneak peek of some tools it hopes will ease
online Web application development.

Next Thursday, Microsoft executives will discuss a developer program
for Start.com, an MSN incubator Web site that consolidates information
from RSS feeds and other Web sites onto a single customizable page.

Although the company has been quiet about the details, the idea is to
encourage Web programmers to build add-ons to Start.com, according to
employee blogs.

At the PDC next week, the company is also expected to release a beta
test version of Atlas, a tool meant to ease creation of Web
applications using the technique known as AJAX, which relies on modern
standards to make Web pages more interactive.

The Atlas toolkit is expected to eventually include software called the
MSN Framework, software for building JavaScript applications that run
on top of MSN Web properties, including the forthcoming version of
Hotmail and the MSN Spaces blog and photo-sharing service. The common
tooling will make it easier for Microsoft engineers to add new features
to their Web sites, according to Microsoft employees.

&quot;The Framework provides us with a client-side component model, network
stacks, Firefox compatibility, and OO (object-oriented) language
enhancements that allows us to 'engineer' rather than ad-hoc script the
client,&quot; Scott Isaacs, an architect for MSN Web experience, said in a
recent blog posting.

Much of the MSN-specific tooling will be incorporated in Microsoft's
Atlas, Isaacs said. Developed by the ASP.Net team, the Atlas Project is
an add-on to Microsoft flagship development tool Visual Studio to
simplify the job of writing interactive Web applications using AJAX
standards.

Balancing Web and Windows platforms
Promoting AJAX-style development of online applications poses something
of a conflict for Microsoft, said Michael Cherry, an analyst at
Directions on Microsoft.

On one hand, Microsoft is appealing to the trend of making Web
applications that run entirely in the browser across all operating
systems. But at the same time, it continues to espouse so-called thick
clients, or what Microsoft calls &quot;smart clients,&quot; where the application
front end fully exploits the features of Windows and Office on a PC. In
its own Dynamics-branded business applications, announced Wednesday,
integration with Office is a top priority, for instance.

Previous Next &quot;What kind of worries them a little with the AJAX
thin-client model is, if they ignore it and offer nothing, are they
driving people to (the open-source development combination) LAMP?&quot;
Cherry said.

&quot;There's an ongoing debate inside the company over what's the right
level to support these things while still being aware that the company
is in the operating-system business,&quot; he said.

Microsoft's Sohn said the company will continue to encourage the use of
both the MSN platform and its Windows/Office combination. With the MSN
tooling, many Windows-based clients can now more easily grab data from
public Web sites, he noted.

&quot;We don't see any conflict here,&quot; he said. &quot;And we know how to compete
in the platform business.&quot;
