Got back from the game in J-ville a couple of hours ago, (Gee, I hope
there are no Jets fans in the group. :) :) :)  ) and I just thought I'd
tell Aunt Judy that I did the almost entire trip down and back in the
RIGHT LANE of a 6 lane freeway.

One tense moment occurred around Exit 14 in GA where I was cruising at ~
70MPH and approaching a possiblly dozing trucker in the center lane who
was drifting back and forth over the lines for both the left lane and
the right lane I was occupying. Atleast he was fairly predictible in his
weaving and I was able to time my slamming of the accelerator to get by
him as he was drifting to the left lane and get by him in post and in
haste...

As a side thought, if the cops on I-95 wanted to actually enforce lane
discipline, they could rake in as much, if not more than, what they rake
in from speeding and tag lights etc....

That goes double for cops in northern VA as well.  I've often wondered
why speeding was the only infraction enforced when there's so many more
blatant violations of the laws going on; ony reason I can figure is it's
easy to get a speeding ticket to stand up in court.

In IL, enforcing KRETP and citing unsafe lane changes would keep a cop
busy for an entire shift. He would just need to pick hiding places a
little differently.

There's no way to enforce lane discipline, you nitwit. It's like all
the crashes caused by driving talking to passengers. No way to stop
it. THINK

No way to stop it?  Sounds like coddler-talk.  I know I can tell when I
see someone talking, and that's all a cop needs to be able to do,
right?  Ticket anyone caught talking, it's just that simple.  Talking
to passengers can hardly be any better than talking on the phone.  The
car is a place for driving, not talking.  What's so important that it
can't wait 10 seconds to carefully change lanes, pull off to the side
of the street, put the hazards on, and face the person to say it?   If
it has to be a long talk, fine.  They make road flares nowadays, you
know.

Maybe for someone of your limited intelligence, that's true.  But for
the rest of us, all the cop has to do is pull someone over who's
blocking the left lane.    Throw them in jail, and people will learn
not to block the left lane.

Who is going to pull over the cops, who tend to be chronic left lane
cruisers?

That's right, and if they need don't have a specific law for it,
"obstructing traffic," works just fine, IMO.
