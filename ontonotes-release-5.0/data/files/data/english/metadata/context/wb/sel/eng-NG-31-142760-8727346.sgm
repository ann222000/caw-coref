RAMAPO - The Board of Health assessed fines against several owners of
unsafe rental properties at its regular monthly meeting yesterday.
Alan Jones, owner of 247 Westside Ave., Haverstraw, was fined $6,000
for failing to provide hot water and gas to the rental property. Jones
has never responded to inquiries from the Department of Health. At one
time, someone claiming to be the property's owner supplied an address
and telephone number in the Bronx, but both appeared to be fake,
inspectors told the board.
The tenants moved out, and the home is now vacant.
In another case, the board fined a company owned and operated by Joseph
Klein $5,000 for water and sewer violations at a Tomkins Cove rental
property.
The county got a court order forcing tenants at 379-381 N. Liberty
Drive to move because of raw sewage leaking on the property and a lack
of clean water. The building is now unoccupied, and repair work has
been done.
Klein's lawyer, Ryan Karben, unsuccessfully tried to convince the board
that his client shouldn't face such stiff fines because he completed
the repairs.
In other action taken by the board:
- Yeuk Lau, also known as Susan Lau, was fined $3,700 for operating
what inspectors said was an illegal rooming house at 10 North Broadway,
Nyack.
Lau told inspectors that she didn't know the house was being used as a
rooming house. She told the board that the property was being vacated
and she would make repairs.
- Aron's 18 Realty Corp. of Spring Valley, owner of 27 Collins Ave.,
Spring Valley, was fined $3,000 for running an illegal boarding house
that had health code violations. The board also directed the
commissioner of health to seek a court order to get tenants to move
because of unsafe conditions.
Property owner Aron Klein did not attend the meeting. Karben, who is
listed as his attorney for the case, did not address the board on his
behalf.
- Pulmuone USA Inc., operator of a tofu factory at 30 Rockland Park
Road, Tappan, was fined $1,500 for polluting its property with tofu
waste and other garbage. Company officials told the board that the
problem occurred after their property was flooded during a severe storm
in April.
- Jean Bonetti, owner of Town &amp; Country condominiums, building 24 unit
247, on Country Club Lane, Pomona, was fined $1,000 for unsanitary
conditions related to numerous cats kept in her unit.
- Daniel Philipson, owner, 56 North Cole Ave., Spring Valley, was fined
$750 for failure to provide hot water to tenants. Philipson told the
board he was involved in a dispute with his tenant and was never
informed that the Department of Health inspected the property.
- Hestia Properties, owner of properties at 40 Ewing Ave. and 149
Bethune Blvd., Spring Valley, was fined $1,200 for failing to clean up
garbage around the properties. Owner Anna Szwarc did not attend.
- Uri Redlich, owner of 43 Railroad Ave. Inc., was fined $750 for
failure to get a sprinkler system inspected.
- Mark and Jacqueline Bierman, owners of 31 White Birch Drive, Pomona,
were fined $100 for failing to fix a deck on the home, which was
vacant. The deck has been fixed, inspectors told the board.
The following fines were assessed against owners of food establishments

Spring Valley, was fined $2,725 for 30 violations issued during three

inspectors visited the restaurant again last week, the board was told.
- JD Subs LLC, operator of Subway-Blauvelt, 580 Route 303, Blauvelt,
was fined $1,175 for 10 violations noted during four inspections. Most
of the violations were corrected by the time inspectors visited again
last week, the board was told.
- Jiang Qiang Fang, operator of Food Star Kitchen, 33 Main St., Spring
Valley, was fined $850 for 10 violations, including hundreds of mouse
droppings. The restaurant was ordered closed by the Department of
Health. It has since re-opened across the street.
