After watching the fourth episode, here are my thoughts on the contestants:

Aaron:   All but absent in this episode.

Amanda:  I noticed her jumping up and down so much she had to pull on her
top, but that was about it.

Courtney:  Sat out the challenge, again.  No surprise.  Her argument over
the hot pot handle with Jean-Robert indicates that it is still likely to be
one of these two that gets booted next from fei Long.

Dave:  The guy continued to walk around like a nut-job even when at the
other camp.  He was right about his tribe's work ethic, though, and he
deserved to stay over Sherea.

Denise:  She speaks.  She speaks well.  She even seemed animated and
entertaining.  Definitely, Burnett has been hiding her from us.

Erik:  He speaks.  He is a doofus.  He is typical for his tribe.  No value,
not even in the challenge.

Frosti:   The young guy even had words to help old man Dave get along with
others.  The young guy had words to tell Dave how to perform in the
challenge.  Will these budding leadership skills blossom now that the tribe
has been beheaded?

Jaime:  Great performance in the challenge, though it was pretty much luck.
How can you tell it was luck?  On her second throw she had a bunch of windup
followed by basically stopping right before her throw.  It reminded me of
people that bowl by running up to the line, stopping, then throwing.

James.  Typical football-violent style actions at the challenge.  I hate
chest pounding testosterone types like that.  I also thought his gripe about
Jean-Robert translating the need for starting a fire was silly.  This guy
looked so much better after the first two episodes than he does now.

Jean-Robert:  Nice to see him step up with the Chinese.  I wonder if
Peih-Gee or Frosti can speak Chinese at the other camp?  Without the
communication skills, that visit from the locals would have been less useful
and less interesting.  Why are you sitting out a challenge?

Peih-Gee:  Was it an optical illusion or did Peih-Gee really perform a whole
lot worse throwing the hammer than even Courtney?  Before this episode, I
thought that Peih-Gee may have been working behind the scenes in some sort
of alliance leadership role.  However, she let her tribe get rid of Dave
when she clearly knew that Sherea was the smart boot move.  So much for
Peih-Gee controlling the gameplay.

Sherea:   performed adequately in the two challenges.  Provides nothing at
camp and should have been booted because her adequate challenge performance
isn't worth putting up with her total uselessness at all other times.

Todd:   Gee, Todd, might you have been being nice to Dave because you knew
he had a clue to hand off?  I think so and that means Leslie was the gift
that just keeps on giving.  Pretty pathetic challenge performance.

Other notes:
Teaching the tribe how to fish is good, but really, does the tribe have time
to train their own birds?

Kinda sad that the Fei Long tribe didn't know how to use the fishing net.
Did they never use it before or did they just toss it into the water in a
big wad and expect fish to swim into it?

Zhan Hu tribe let the rice rot in their swamp camp.  They are too lazy to
boil water.  We even found out they have a well, but are so lazy that they
would rather just drink the river water.  This tribe won't be getting
stronger without Dave.

Monkeys monkeys everywhere tonight.

Sometimes, ensuring harmony in camp is more important than anything
else...Keeping someone annoying around destroys the mental health of the
tribe - the anger and resentment builds and the group simply cannot be a
group.

Two things contributed to his boot:

1. His absence proved to the other tribe that his &quot;leadership&quot; wasn't
necessary for them to do what needed to be done.

2. His absence showed them just how much he was antagonizing everyone,
and how much they can be in harmony without him. It's hard to ignore the
fact that he has butted heads with Ashley, P.G., and Sherea. It simply
can't be *their* fault, when he had problems with all three..

From what we saw, they didn't get anything done without him.  They sat
around until the day was half over, then they sort of gathered a few twigs
to boil some river water.  Too lazy to get well water.  No firewood was
stockpiled early in the day when doing such work would be cooler/easier.  No
attempt to gather more food from what we could tell.  Even when they did get
up and 'work', Sherea still sat there doing nothing.

No doubt he is an annoying jerk to be around.  Still, without him all that
we saw was that several other players were annoyed that Sherea wasn't doing
anything.  No 'harmony', just a discord left unvocalized.

I just read his CBS bio.  He is an underwear model.  He is another South
Carolina player.  He is part of a rock band that tours and has had their
song featured on the TV show, Scrubs.  He played Football and track in
highschool and is a college graduate.  From all of that, I'd say that the
'virgin' comment was some sort of lie and that, if anything, he swings both
ways.  he must be getting some, right?  Oh wait, one more bit from his bio:
he is a Christian and believes his faith will keep him strong.
So...yep...probably is really a virgin.  No surprise that Leslie was trying
to make a deal with him/Jamie for the merge.

She was highlighted by the editors from the beginning, so I thought
she was going. It turned out they needed to set someone up as a voting
alternative to Dave, to create a little drama for the vote.

In the show's intro, JP claimed Sherea was a hero in two competitions.
They showed her with her hands on a rope while a man pulled the log
across the finish line.

Then they showed her acting like an asshole when Dave asked (or
demanded) she not throw away the shells.

And then, telling the camera, (paraphrasing), &quot;I'm going to let them
work their tails off. I'm just going to lay on the ground and not do
any work at all.&quot;

With that, she instantly became my least favorite player.

What is it about Aaron that suddenly stood out for you as boot material?  I
hardly even noticed him this episode.  We have seen a few comments about him
being 'controlling', but since he is the designated tribe leader that is no
surprise.  Why do you think he would get booted before Jean-Robert or
Courtney?  Unless the tribe swap moves him to a majority Zhan Hu group, I
don't think he has done anything worthy of topping the boot list.

I agree.  The ULong people were at least trying.  These fools don't really
even do that much.  Once again, ULong goes down in history for its
patheticness, but they would not be alone on that list if Burnett would let
every season pass without a swap/shuffle 'twist'.  Other than the blip that
was Leslie going home, this season's Zhan Hu is every bit as hopeless as
ULong.

You answered your own question: the teaching was how to use the net.
And yes they are too stupid to figure out how to use it on their
own.  Both teams demonstrated their stupidity in the elimination
challenge.  Why would you twirl the bolos vertically so the could
pass through the vertical poles?   Members of both tribes did that
so obviously neither tribe discussed strategy before beginning.

Such is the result of recruiting the cast.  In the old days people
who knew the show and game would apply.  Those selected had some
physical skills and some social skills and most important, a desire
to win the game.  Many of the recruited players have never even seen
the show, have no desire to win the game and sign on only to win
money.  There is a huge difference between wanting to win money and
wanting to win the game.  One is basically dumb luck the other
requires skill.  I don't consider that someone who gets to the final
4 or 5 by doing absolutely nothing is &quot;skillfully flying under the
radar!&quot;  Rather, they aren't playing the game.

I thought Dave was the asshole in that situation. She had the tray in her
hands and he was physically trying to grab it from her. It wasn't even clear
to me that she intended to throw them out but she was adamant that he back
off, which he refused to do. Frankly, if someone had acted like that to me,
I probably would have thrown them in the lake even if that hadn't been my
original plan. I think she showed considerable restraint in passing the
shells off to someone else instead.

The fact that she sat out the reward challenge and Jon-Robert sat out the

that tribe isn't too bright. Even if they predicted that a male would have

The nature of the challenge forced everybody into &quot;violent style actions.&quot;
Naturally, it's going to seem a bit more brutish from a guy like him. And
the way JR barked at Courtney early on showed that's his instructional
style, which may be why it didn't seem to James that he was merely
interpreting.

I think it has to do with the kidnap situation.  If you are kidnapped, the

&gt; I thought Dave was the asshole in that situation. She had the tray in her

&gt; clear to me that she intended to throw them out but she was adamant that
&gt; he back off, which he refused to do. Frankly, if someone had acted like

She was the one in the wrong.  He said he wanted to keep the shells. There
was no reason for her to have to proceed to try and throw them away and it
was quite clear that that was her intention.  She gave no reason for her
actions (maybe she just didn't want them attracting bugs) and was just
trying to show Dave that she didn't have to listen to what he said.

Looking back on it, the scene hints that the tribe had already decided to
end his leadership role and she was just taking advantage of a decision she
knew about that he didn't so she could 'feel like the bigger man'.  Childish
on her part.

I agree.  What is worse is that the tribe got to see what the Immunity
Challenge was before they decided to sit out Jean-Robert.  They knew that
part of the challenge was to be big enough to block incoming projectiles and
that part of the challenge was being able to throw a projectile back
acurately and hopefully over the other team's blocker.  Nothing about that
challenge said 'sit out Jean-Robert and have Todd do it'.

Of course that's what she was doing.  Maybe if Dave had said that he
wanted to save the shells for his mom (yeah, right) initially, it
wouldn't have been a problem.  But instead it was just yet another

had her fill of those moments.

Does she really have to give a reason for, and get permission to
remove trash from the camp?  Ridiculous.

You're operating under the assumption that Dave's accusation was correct

I think this is likely a situation where you can easily spin it in
either direction depending on who you want to blame. What I saw was
Sherea picked up the shells and Dave asked her (although it came across
as more of an order rather than a request) not to throw them out. Sherea
ignored him and walked out of camp to throw them out. Dave called after
her several times and she continued to ignore him. Dave then went after
her to stop her from throwing the shells out because he wanted to keep
them. Sherea then spazzed out on him.

Dave lacked in the diplomacy/politeness department but Sherea was a

Somebody is currently uploading Survivor season 2 over on
alt.binaries.reality-tv and just before coming here I was watching
episode 5 which is the episode where Kucha kills the chickens much to
Kimmi's annoyance and it immediately afterwards goes to an Ogakor
scene between Keith and Jerri where they're arguing about what to do
with the fish guts - they don't want to feed the fish in the area
since that would make them less eager to bite.

The way Keith and Jerri were arguing (10 minutes into the episode if
anyone has them and wants to check) reminds me a LOT of this sequence
the difference being of course that bothKeith and Jerri went fairly
deep into the game where Dave obviously did not and if my bet for this
week is on, Sherea won't be either.

No. She told a guy who was groping around her body to back off. Nothing
wrong with that.

For all the people who are certain Sherea was going to throw the shells out,

&gt; No. She told a guy who was groping around her body to back off.

She was being an asshole long before that. When Dave asked (told) her

Give me a break. I did not call him a dog. His behavior was dog-like. Had a
woman acted in that manner it would still be dog-like. Whether it's a man,
woman, child or animal acting that way, it needs to learn that that approach
will not get it what it wants.

She was doing what *she* wanted to do with the shells (and you still don't
know what *she* wanted to do with them, all you have is an accusation from
Dave). Who says his desires should supercede hers? If she was set on
throwing the shells out as you seem to think, why do you suppose she didn't
she do it when she had the opportunity? Maybe it's because that was never
her plan. And maybe the reason she didn't explain that to him in the first
place goes back to the previous scene in which she expressed the fact that
Dave wanted everybody to listen to him but he never listened to anybody
else. If she thought her words always fell on deaf ears perhaps she didn't
want to bother explaining herself.

you're going to throw it away, I have every right to order you to put it

Which episode did you see that in? If there was some scene that showed tribe
members chucking shells into the water, then I'll recant much of my argument
in this discussion. But if you're just making shit up and ignoring the
facts, then it's pointless discussing this with you. Try to remember that
the *only* indication we received of what Sherea's plans were was Dave's
accusation and since we were never given proof that he's a mind reader then
perhaps you shouldn't put so much credence that his assumption was correct.

I won't disagree with that at all. In a typical situation between two people
the respectful response to his comment would have been to either leave the
shells alone or to inform him of what she was doing with him. But this was a
situation in which they've had a cantakerous relationship and she obviously
resents him barking orders at her. She had previously mentioned how he
doesn't listen to anybody so I don't think her silence was totally
unwarranted. His actions, on the other hand, were physically aggressive so I
don't see how you could think someone's silence, followed by their request
to be given some space could be worse than that.
