Glad you stuck to your guns.  It's funny, people will question the travel or sitting-around time of a face painter, but not of a lawyer.  My time is billed from the second I leave my office 'til the second I get back, and if I'm in court for 8 hours because the judge takes all the other cases first, so be it.  You get billed for 8 hours.  The only thing I do - by my OWN choice, it's not in the retainer agreement - is take off the time for lunch, because I usually feel bad.  I figure I'd be eating lunch anyway.  Sometimes, if I really feel bad &amp; it's special circs, and I was able to bring another file to court to work on while waiting, I'll take some more time off the bill too.

-------------- Original message from &quot;Christina Davison&quot; &lt;christ ... @amadazzle.com&gt;: --------------

I just got a call yesterday from a client who booked her private party over 3 months ago (and who approved the confirmation sent to her). This is for a child's first birthday, which in this neck of the woods, with some families tends to be a HUGE bash. This same client booked us 3 years ago for their first daughter's party as well. Anyway, she had originally booked EVERYTHING I've got, for a total of just over $800. Two weeks ago, she reduced the chosen options which changed her total to $515. OK, that's fine, that's 2 fewer people I have to hire for the job, no biggie. Then, last night she wants to finagle the options and time again, still trying to bring down her total, BUT she wants to split up her time into two segments with a &quot;break&quot; in the middle. That would have us sitting around for an hour doing nothing, but she didn't want to pay for it because they had another activity planned for that hour.

Huh? So I'm supposed to just eat the cost of paying my help to sit there watching the animals while they're doing nothing? I don't think so. She also complained that our prices were higher than at her first party. Ummm...maybe because our travel costs have DOUBLED since that time????

I finally told her she was asking for too much and she backed down. Sheesh, some people.

Subject: FPHQ how do I handle this.....

CAROL

I have a similar problem myself today!
Gig booked through an agent (repeat for me from last year). Outdoor event and it's bucketing down,

Two days ago they enquired what would be my cancellation price. Once they'd collected them from everybody they decided to take the risk and go ahead today. Yesterday was a hot day. Today it's pouring down but an early message said &quot;still going ahead&quot;. Just about to leave for the 2 hour drive and agent called to say &quot;it's off&quot;, area flooded and can't even get to the sports ground. Will be rearranged for September.

I do a lot with this agent but no other work with the end client. Unfortunately the agent isn't strong and very poor at all aspects of pricing, marketing and thus cancellations.

Here's what I am saying:
My 'normal' policy is 100% if cancelled so close.
However, if clients reschedule at an agreed future date / time ... then this is negotiable and perhaps just a surcharge on the rebooking. IF I am unable to do the rescheduled rebooking, then the cancellation fee becomes payable.

It's rare this happens at all and I have never had to apply the rule.

Unfortunately I did have a reschedule a few weeks ago (British weather again) and a new date was agreed. 'Sod's law' .... since then I've had other enquiries for that new date ... so I am effectively losing the booking in any case.

In your case Carol ..... your 'rules' surely also apply to your bookers who must abide by them. If they claim they were only acting as agent ... then they have a responsibility to pass your conditions on.

&gt;&gt; Now, I get a decent amount of work through the picnic place.  I don't want to make them angry.

I'd talk to them and explain how it should be. If it's different, now is the time to ensure that it happens properly from now on. As far as this one goes, I'd treat it in the way you see fit after talking to them. Whilst I have conditions ... I try not to get paid for not working ... nobody likes that .... and I'd certainly always look at the long term relationship. However ... we often need the money (and notice the loss) far more than the client does.

You feel bad about billing for time???  Are you SURE you're really a
lawyer Larissa???

I charge $25/hour to just hang around...like waiting around to touch
up wedding parties for the photos, etc.
