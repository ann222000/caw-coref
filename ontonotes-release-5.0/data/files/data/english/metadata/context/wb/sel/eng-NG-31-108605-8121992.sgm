Obama's comments on Afghanistan draw sharp rebuke from Romney campaign

Bill Sammon, The Examiner

2007-08-14

WASHINGTON -

Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama came under fire Tuesday
for saying that U.S. troops in Afghanistan are &quot;just air-raiding villages
and killing civilians.&quot; The junior senator from Illinois made the comment
Monday at a campaign stop in Nashua, New Hampshire.

&quot;We've got to get the job done there,&quot; he said of Afghanistan. &quot;And
that requires us to have enough troops so that we're not just air-raiding
villages and killing civilians, which is causing enormous pressure over
there.&quot;

N.B.  Obama was obviously giving some Red Meat to his Loony-Left Wing of the
Democrat Party base.  He's fallen into this trap before. -- DSH

The comment drew a rebuke Tuesday from the campaign of Republican
presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

&quot;That is a very troubling remark on so many levels,&quot; said Romney
spokesman Kevin Madden. &quot;Most importantly, it's emblematic of Senator
Obama's lack of experience for the job of commander-in-chief. But it's also
an entirely inaccurate condemnation of the efforts of the men and women of
the United States military who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.&quot;

A spokesman for Obama, who will speak at the Veterans of Foreign Wars
convention in Missouri next week, did not immediately respond to Madden's
criticism.

The flap comes three weeks after Obama promised that if elected
president, he would meet without pre-conditions with the leaders of Iran,
Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea. That pledge was called
&quot;irresponsible and frankly naive&quot; by rival Democratic presidential candidate
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Eight days later, eager to rebut Clinton's charge, Obama said that as
president, he might send U.S. troops into Pakistan to fight terrorists not
targeted by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.

&quot;If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets
and President Musharraf won't act, we will,&quot; he vowed.

Critics called this overly hawkish, prompting Obama to modulate again
the next day by ruling out the use of nuclear weapons to fight terrorism in
Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The Democrats have spawned another naive, irresponsible, intemperate
Flip-Flopper. -- DSH

&quot;I think it would be a profound mistake for us to use nuclear weapons
in any circumstance,&quot; he told the AP before pausing.

&quot;Involving civilians,&quot; he added. &quot;Let me scratch that. There's been no
discussion of nuclear weapons. That's not on the table.&quot;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Let me scratch that&quot;...

Obama tries to declare his statement &quot;inoperable&quot;.

&quot;There's been no discussion of nuclear weapons.  That's not on the table.&quot;

Hilarious!

And:

No Sale.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gaffe was criticized by Clinton, who said: &quot;I don't believe that
any president should make any blanket statements with respect to the use or
non-use of nuclear weapons.&quot;

Clinton has been criticized for a statement about Iran last year in
which she said &quot;I would certainly take nuclear weapons off the table.&quot;

On Tuesday, Clinton's campaign declined to comment on Obama's remark
about U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why should she -- NOW? -- Mitt Romney has already done the job FOR her.

BUT she WILL be questioned about Obama's stupid, insulting remark concerning
our troops in Afghanistan.

P.S.  We MAY be seeing the initial stages of what could become a Clinton vs.
Romney contest in 2008.

Truth to tell, I almost would rather have him as Prez than any of the
other politicos...let's face it, elections are just dog and pony
shows, ain't nothing substantive at all, whatever the rhetoric -- so a
black person or a woman will look good...but please, no more old white
farts, and no more x-tian jesus freak types!!

But on this matter osama is telling the truth, at least.  Too bad the

anyone who was a member of the military during a war or is it only
used for those who actually saw active service and fought in battle?

With the plethora of medals that US military members seem to gather
during their military careers, it's hard to guess who were the
fighting men and who was a pay clerk at HQ.

By definition anyone who served honorably in the US Armed Forces is
considered a Veteran.  War or peacetime does not matter, they are
still a Veteran.  Then further levels of distinction come into play.
A War veteran served during the time of the war/conflict (American
Legion Basic membership req.).  The Veterans of Foreign War (VFW)
require their members to be actually in-country during the war/
conflict (with the Expeditionary Medal exception.)  Combat Vet means
actually under fire by hostile forces.

Yes, I saw that.  I was just remembering the actual contentious politically
motivated debates in another group when, for instance, it came to comparing
John Kerry's record as a Vietnam war veteran vs. GWB's Vietnam era veteran
status.  Also, some spammer who was a Vietnam era veteran was advertising
himself as a Vietnam veteran.  The nuances can be very significant in
certain instances.

They shouldn't be, it is very clear cut to me.

Service during the Viet Nam War -- A War Era Vet.
Service actually in country -- A VN War Vet.
Came under hostile enemy fire -- A Combat Vet.

&gt;&gt;       &quot;That is a very troubling remark on so many levels,&quot; said Romney
&gt;&gt; spokesman Kevin Madden. &quot;Most importantly, it's emblematic of Senator
&gt;&gt; Obama's lack of experience for the job of commander-in-chief. But it's also
&gt;&gt; an entirely inaccurate condemnation of the efforts of the men and women of

&gt;&gt;       The gaffe was criticized by Clinton, who said: &quot;I don't believe that

&gt;&gt; non-use of nuclear weapons.&quot;

&gt;&gt;       Clinton has been criticized for a statement about Iran last year in

&gt;This election seasons makes one wonder if Alexander Hamilton was right
&gt;in the Federalist Papers writings that if a democracy does not have an
&gt;educated public or educated leadership, then a process should be made
&gt;to run the country until one exists. I still believe in the Jefferson
&gt;basis of democracy that an educated public is the key to a democracy,
&gt;but I am concerned with constitutes an educated voting public today.
">

I can't see you finding an answer in the US. A public that supported
Guantanamo Bay can't have the faintest idea of what constitutes
democracy.

Your best bet is to reprise your Bye Bye Saigon act and get out of
Iraq. You've got Iraq's oil and the contents of its treasury; nobody
in the US gives a shit if the Iraqis massacre each other, so, give
your troops an R&amp;R break before sending them back out on their next
international hit.

May I suggest that handing over the entire Bush Administration, past
and present, to face the War Crimes Commission at The Hague would be a
signal to the world that democracy has not been completely obliterated
in the United States.

Handing Americans back their civil rights would probably win you about
300 million friends. But before you do that, pick up all the fascists
like Hines, put them against a wall and shoot them.

It would restore a large part of your former image overseas; namely,
totally incompetent, but at least trying, as opposed to the army that
rapes and murders civilians and lets its American officials, courtesy
of Paul Bremer, steal the $4 billion earmarked for restoring Iraqi
hospitals and bringing them back to their former status; the best
health service in the Arab World, comparable to anything in Europe or
the US.

Long way to go, but then you voted for it, so it's the old tale; you
burned your asses, you sit on the blisters.

I'm not joking. Nor is anyone else who isn't American.

no fan of the U.S. military, he is saying that there is a perception to
people outside the U.S. that the supply clerk type, fer instance,  who
doesn't leave CONUS tends to bear as many medals and ribbons on his chest as
those who actually serve in combat during war years.

It is _generally_ not true.  Perceptions are often incorrect.
What I've seen is the guys that never do anything 'challenging' wear
every ribbon they can get their hands on.  The guys that have seen
more 'interesting' service tend to wear only the few that they put
value in.  My COB never wore more than two rows of ribbons.  Until I
saw him in full dress, then he leaned to one side with all the
awards.  That's when I found out about his three tours in VN on
riverine boats and having two shot out under him.

Back in London, I was having dinner in the Groucho Club— this week’s
in-spot for what’s left of Britain’s lit gritz and nouveau rock
riche—when one person started in on the Stars And Stripes. Eventually
he got, as the Europeans always do, to the part about “your country’s
never been invaded.”
(This fellow had been two during the Blitz, you see.)

“You don’t know the horror, the suffering. You think war is...”

I snapped.

“A John Wayne movie,” I said. &quot;That’s what you were going to say,
wasn’t it? We think war is a John Wayne movie. We think life is a John
Wayne movie—with good guys and bad guys, as simple as that. Well, you
know something, Mister Limey Poofter? You’re right. And let me tell you
who those bad guys are. They’re us. WE BE BAD.&quot;

&quot;We’re the baddest-ass sons of bitches that ever jogged in Reeboks.
We’re three-quarters grizzly bear and two-thirds car wreck and
descended from a stock market crash on our mother’s side. You take
your Germany, France and Spain, roll them all together and it
wouldn’t give us room to park our cars. We’re the big boys, Jack,
the original, giant, economy-sized, new and improved butt kickers
of all time. When we snort coke in Houston, people lose their hats in
Cap D’Antibes. And we’ve got an American Express card credit limit
higher than your piss-ant metric numbers go.&quot;

“You say our country’s never been invaded? You’re right, little buddy.
Because I’d like to see the needle-dicked foreigners who’d have the
guts to try. We drink napalm to get our hearts started in the morning.
A rape and a mugging is our way of saying ‘Cheerio.’ Hell can’t hold
our sock-hops. We walk taller, talk louder, spit further, fuck longer
and buy more things than you know the names of. I’d rather be a junkie
in a New York City jail than king, queen, and jack of all you Europeans.
We eat little countries like this for breakfast and shit them out
before lunch.”

Of course, the guy should have punched me. But this was Europe.
He just smiled his shabby, superior European smile.

Okay, I have a minute for what seems a small thing to the non-military, but
is a big thing, if you are in the military for a career.

Lemme s'plain.  It has always been one of the goals of military training to
attempt to assess how a person would do in combat.  Whether it is the
&quot;confidence course&quot; or the &quot;chewing-out,&quot; or jump training, it's trying to
see how the person will fare under stress.  I don't think I have to explain
that every person wants to be in combat (well no one does, but that can
happen) with someone who is &quot;cool under fire.&quot;  Guess where that phrase came
from.

Anyway, after the smoke has cleared, people who get bronze stars, air
medals, silver stars, etc. get put on the &quot;A&quot; list for command positions and
advanced on the promotion roles.  That is because the guessing is over, they
have &quot;proved&quot; themselves worthy of command, and you can trust your son or
daughter to them because they are &quot;cool under fire&quot; and a person that you,
yourself, would volunteer to go to combat with - considering that you could,
otherwise, get some no-name jerk.  That is also why a number of people
volunteer for Special Forces or Rangers because they feel better amongst
&quot;professionals.&quot;  Not that the big unwashed army is not, just playing the
odds.

So I knew a guy who had the Medal of Honor, and he had the &quot;thousand-yard
stare&quot; and he turned down a commission because he felt that he had done what
he could, and was comfortable with himself, but he did not feel that he had
&quot;the right stuff&quot; to lead others.  He knew what &quot;to do&quot; but he just did not
know what to say to others.

I knew an army major who had the Silver Star, and he said that having that
award led him to better assignments.  He said that as he was selected to the
Armed Forces Staff College, a joint service selection and a plum selection
for a major.  As it happens I had been there and knew that they require a
full length photo, in complete uniform (and also a full length photo of the
wife.)  It was ostensibly for the class picture, but in fact, it went to
personnel and they checked everything.  It turned out that he forged his
Silver Star from the form of another major, in his unit, who had died in
combat.  He was removed from the list and placed in an administrative
assignment pending courts-martial, or maybe just resigning, &quot;for the good of
the service.&quot;  In the meantime a passenger jet taking off from National
Airport, in Washington, D.C. hit a bridge, and he was called, and jumped
into the water, and rescued someone.  So he was a hero anyway, but I never
heard what happened to him.

Anyway, those &quot;little pieces of ribbon&quot; mean a lot to someone who has been
there.  And if there is any whiff or question of deceit, then many voices
will be heard.  Not just for the act itself, but for what this means to the
people that this person might command.

Thank you.

For me, it's always interesting to see a photo of someone wearing a military
uniform that is resplendent with baubles, ribbons, and medals and wondering
if the person in question just might be a fake.  I say interesting, because
it gives the military types an opportunity to see if they are *up* on their
ID'ing skills to determine whether or not the person in question is legit.

We civilians, of course, don't generally know one medal or ribbon from
another.  But those so inclined will LOL when they - for instance - see a
pair of wings being worn upside down on a lapel of a fake hero.

&gt; A War veteran served during the time of the war/conflict (American

A veteran, whether active duty, National Guard, Reserve, or retired, is
someone who at one point in their life wrote a blank check payable to

&gt; Your best bet is to reprise your Bye Bye Saigon act and get out of

&gt; May I suggest that handing over the entire Bush Administration, past

&gt; Handing Americans back their civil rights would probably win you about
&gt; 300 million friends. But before you do that, pick up all the fascists
&gt; like Hines, put them against a wall and shoot them.

&gt; It would restore a large part of your former image overseas; namely,
&gt; totally incompetent, but at least trying, as opposed to the army that
&gt; rapes and murders civilians and lets its American officials, courtesy
&gt; of Paul Bremer, steal the $4 billion earmarked for restoring Iraqi
&gt; hospitals and bringing them back to their former status; the best
&gt; health service in the Arab World, comparable to anything in Europe or
&gt; the US.

&gt; Long way to go, but then you voted for it, so it's the old tale; you

The term &quot;veteran&quot; used to mean people who actually served in wartime
(I don't know if there was ever a distinction between frontline duty
and support back then), but now it's applied to anyone who's seen
service at all.

Some will speak of &quot;combat&quot; veterans to distinguish those who actually
fought; &quot;war&quot; veterans are often used by those who were merely in-
theater but not on the frontlines (and though folks like to talk about
how the frontlines and combat arms are losing their lines of
distinction due to asymmetrical warfare, that's baloney; there is
still a difference in an office clerk getting shot at and an
infantryman getting shot at).

A bit of marginalia....

One could certainly legitimately claim to be a &quot;Combat Vet&quot; on no more
actual evidence than service as a Saigon Commando, no closer to the action
than the roof of the Caravelle when a grenade was tossed from a passing
cyclo on to the terrace below.

The crews of the ships involved in the Tonkin Gulf imbroglio qualified for
combat vet status, as did crews of all sorts of small boys coming no closer
inshore than the edge of the Brownwater.  Stop a junk or sampan, and you may
qualify for even higher award.

Yet in the actual danger and discomfort, most who have been around during 18
hours of Flight Quarters on CVA would have passed out Bronze Stars like
Cheetos to the flight deck crews.

I tend to work under the conclusion that any closer than Subic counts as a
Vietnam vet, and that there are a Hell of a lot of Cold War vets who
hazarded life and limb at not much less risk than several hundred thousand
of those &quot;in country&quot; in Vietnam.

My &quot;Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal&quot; comes from having been aboard a ship
attached to the 6th Fleet during the Berlin Crisis.  On the other hand, I
know a guy who qualified for his crouched in a sand trap on the golf course
LZ just off the beach in Santo Domingo during a mostly combatless Dominican
Incursion.  A round fired from atop an apartment building across the road
clipped the radio handset in his hand, leaving it as a good combat souvenir.
I've an ex brother in law, a National Guardsman shy even the modest 6 months
of active duty.  He does, however, sport a pair of &quot;jump wings&quot; earned at
the same risk as faced regular paratroopers qualifying for the same badge,
part of a misguided effort to have elite National Guard units.

My father used to claim that upon his return from China in 1945, he was
chewed out by an elderly &quot;reg&quot; Medical Corps COL for wearing a Bronze Star
with the Combat V since Dad was a Medical Corps Surgeon/noncombatant.  Dad
always claimed that the Japanese failure to discriminate based on status
greatly affected the man who wrote up his citation along with the one for
his Purple Heart and the gaudy gilt and enamel dinnerplate the KMT gave him
to wear dangling over his tie.

There are all too many gedunk medals and qualification devices.  In my case,
the paper mill I would have been required to carry out to establish
eligibility for the &quot;Surface Warfare&quot; badge was beyond silly, but meant all
the difference for Reserve  Line O6 selection boards.

A veteran is a veteran is a veteran (until he/she attempts to trade upon
that honorable status for undeserved grace and favor).

Well, Dearie, until you're ready to hire, train, provide benefits for and
take care of the families of an international &quot;law enforcement agency&quot; large
enough, adequately equipped, appropriately trained , effectively deployed
and able to engage (and all the while commanded by leaders for whom results
matter more than the vicissitudes of politics and political correctness),
that statement is outright, unmitigated Hogwash.  On several dozen bloody
occasions dating back to 1980 and even earlier, a variety of international
and national police agencies have demonstrated every aspect of incompetence
and ineffectiveness in dealing with terrorists and protecting potential
targets.

Until then, you've no real defense against terrorism than the sort
undertaken by your own uniformed forces in Afghanistan.  We adopt such
shocked expressions at the Israelis use of missiles fired from helos to
target Hamas leaders in Gaza, without seeing the highly personal view that
Israelis have of the capacity of Hamas to carry out terrorist actions on
Israeli soil, no matter how many &quot;policemen&quot; and miles of razor wire and
fence Israel constructs.

I don't know how may &quot;foreign fighters&quot; would chose alternative venues for
their activities if Iraq didn't provide a close and available forum.  Nether
do you.  Maybe only one on the Vancouver/Victoria ferry, no more effective
than the doctors attempting to immolate themselves and the Glasgow airport
and all therein.  How about 10?  Just what assurance do you have that the
RCMP have every potential terrorist hanging around a mosque in Toronto under
surveillance and ready to snatch up?  Not much.  Can you suggest some magic
police cure for a handful of Saudi &quot;students&quot; arriving, clutching Wahabi
tracts, and with something other tah advanced degrees in mind.

We don't know how many are out there, any more than we &quot;knew&quot; enough to stop
the 9/11 gang.  We can't deploy &quot;police&quot; to Saudi Arabia or Pakistan or to
the dozens of other locales from where the terrorists emerge, from Indonesia
to the Central Asian steppe to embittered folks in Bosnia or Kosovo.  For
the moment Iraq and Aghanistan are at least focal points for thir rage and
available theaters for their operations.

Sadly, in a mutually costly conflict of attrition, armies don't do much
better than police, but for all the nasty and ghastly &quot;collateral damage&quot; in
innocent deaths and maiming in Iraq and among the Afghans, if the campaigns
there prevent or delay one mad Bali bomber outside a Waikiki Beach nightclub

Canadians of a Leftist persuasion such as &quot;La Nilita&quot; -- the British
Columbian, former self-confessed flower child and current heifer &quot;social
worker&quot; -- simply do NOT see a THREAT from terrorists.

In their heart of hearts they see the United States as the lightning rod
that will attract the terrorist strikes -- NOT themselves...

And they welcome that -- &quot;in order to teach the Yanks a lesson in humility.&quot;

So, they don't want to pay in blood and treasure for an adequate Armed
Forces -- nor do they even want to THINK about the threat from Global
Islamofascist Jihadist Terrorists.

To them, there IS no significant threat -- to THEMSELVES.

&quot;What, Me Worry?&quot; is their core attitude.

&quot;La Nilita's&quot; favorite subjects are Parties, Fornication and Booze -- NOT
Geopolitics, National Defense and International Security.

Part of a paper I wrote almost 10 years ago below &lt;http://
papers4publication.blogspot.com/2006/12/russian-organized-
crime_05.html&gt;.  That was on Transnational Organized Crime, but many
of the issues are the same whether we regard terrorists as criminals
(as you do) or as a military threat (as I do). The single greatest
commonality is that whichever view is taken, law Enforcement has to be
part of the equation.  The following is only illustrative of some of
the obstacles.  It certanly does not consider the challenges posed by
a Terrorist State such as Afghanistan was before 2001 and Iraq before
2003 and the obvious problems arising form trying to use the FBI to
deal with that.

Possible Strategy: Law Enforcement
Inherent obstacles presented to law enforcement involving
transnational criminals include foreign sovereignty, extradition,
exercise of U.S. authority on foreign nationals and/or on foreign
soil, jurisdiction, and Constitutional protections for non-resident,
non-citizens. International terrorists and organized criminals cross
easily over international borders and blur the lines that once divided
domestic and international threats. If the U.S. is to meet these new
challenges successfully, we must find the most effective way to
harmonize the unique talents and resources of law enforcement and
intelligence. Law enforcement personnel specialize in investigative
skills and techniques while the intelligence community has
sophisticated foreign collection abilities. According to Former DCI
Deutch,&quot; routine cooperation between intelligence and law enforcement
will profoundly improve our nation's security in the post-Cold War
world. Recent experience has proven that when intelligence and law
enforcement cooperate effectively, we can be spectacularly
successful.&quot;(158)

Phil Heymann, a former Deputy Attorney General, summarized some
encouraging developments: &quot;Two things happened. With the end of the
Cold War, the intelligence agencies became very involved, in part
perhaps to make use of their talents, skills, and resources, in a new
set of areas and that new set of areas substantially overlapped law
enforcement: narcotics, terrorism, weapons proliferation, things that
have law enforcement sides to them. And the second thing that happened
was that with the coming of terrorism in a frightening way in the
'80s, law enforcement started being given by Congress the power to
punish acts that were committed abroad against American citizens or
against aircraft. The result of that was suddenly the FBI had
jurisdiction to go after terrorism abroad, and DEA has jurisdiction in
a variety of ways to go after drugs that are at least starting abroad.
At the same time, the CIA is starting to focus on the same
issues.&quot;(159)

There is much yet to be done. In the interagency arena, the CIA in
coordination with other members of the intelligence community could
provide more strategic intelligence at the top levels of the
Department of Justice and work on a case-by-case basis with law
enforcement to ensure that intelligence records are kept in such a way
that they may be able to be used in criminal prosecutions. Also, there
could also be a great deal more common training of FBI Special Agents,
Drug Enforcement Administration Agents, and CIA officers on areas
where they should be cooperating, such as narcotics.(160) In that
vein, clear authority should be given to U.S. ambassadors overseas to
ensure that if a conflict arises-- say in a narcotics matter between
what DEA wants to do and what CIA wants to do--that the ambassador
(with appropriate staff) is to arbitrate the matter. (161)

On a more strategic level, at the request of President Clinton, an
interagency group is developing an International Crime Bill. The bill
will contain proposals to augment the ability of U.S. agencies to
investigate and prosecute international criminals. It will seek
authorization for increased U.S. training and assistance to other
countries who show a commitment to fighting international crime but
need more resources to be effective.(162) While such an initiative is
certainly important, success is greatly dependent on successful
relationships with law enforcement personnel in foreign countries.

Relations with Foreign Law Enforcement
One of the most effective ways to fight international crime is by
building cop-to-cop bridges between American law enforcement and our
overseas counterparts. Without these relationships, there cannot be
the commonality of purpose and open communication required for success.
(163)

The Legal Attaché Program of the FBI works closely with a large number
of foreign police forces. Not only do they cooperate on specific
cases, but also form something of an early warning system to alert the
FBI of emerging crime threats. The FBI has opened a Legal Attaché
Office in Moscow to work closely with Russian police against a variety
of costly crimes. From July 1994 to April of 1996, the number of cases
worked by the FBI Agents in Moscow increased from 20 to over 200.(164)

In FY 1995, the FBI performed a total of 10 In-Country Training Needs
Assessments whereby, at the invitation of the host government, the FBI
analyzes each country's police training needs and capabilities. A
recommendation of how the FBI could assist the host country's law
enforcement capabilities through targeted training follows. The
assessments were conducted in Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia,
India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldavia, Paraguay,
Peru, Poland, Romania, Tunisia, Ukraine, and Uruguay.(165)

In action against a growing Russian organized crime structure in the
United States, the FBI arrested Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov along
with five of his associates on extortion charges. The Russian Ministry
of Interior and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police aided the arrests in
New York.(166) More recently, four Russians were charged in New York
for conspiring to defraud 24 Russian companies, including a charity
established to aid the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, of
approximately $10.8 million.(167)

The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) [UK] recently hosted
meetings in London of top international criminal intelligence officers
with the aim of targeting Russian-speaking organized crime. The
conference was a unique collaboration, bringing together
representatives from the FBI, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the
Italian Anti-Mafia Directorate, Germany's Bundeskriminalamt and NCIS,
together with a senior officer from Russia's Ministry of Interior
Police (MVD).(168)

With an eye on Russia and the former Soviet Union as well as Eastern
Europe, on December 5, 1994, President Clinton, Hungarian President
Goncz and Prime Minister Horn reached agreement that Hungary would
host in Budapest a law enforcement training academy to train law
enforcement officers from Central Europe and the New Independent
States. The Department of State and U.S. law enforcement agencies
opened the International Law Enforcement Academy on April 24, 1995,
offering an eight-week course for mid-level police officials from
Central Europe and the NIS. The course focuses on development of
skills in the areas of financial crimes, organized crime, drug
investigations, property crimes, human dignity, management of the
investigative process, and management applications of computerized law
enforcement information systems.(169)

Notwithstanding the need for more and better international law
enforcement interchange, the U.S. cannot afford to rely on foreign law
enforcement officials to protect the U.S. With reference to Russia,
James Woolsey, former DCI, said, &quot;... in much of the world, relations
between American law enforcement and supposed law enforcement agencies
of other countries, are in fact, relationships between honest American
law enforcement and foreign agencies that are permeated by organized
crime, are deeply involved with their own national intelligence
operations and all the rest. If you meet someone from a Russian law
enforcement agency these days and he has on a $500 suit and Gucci
loafers, and he says that in his spare time he works for an
international trading company, he may be engaged in that trading
company. He may be engaged in law enforcement. He may be a case
officer for Russian intelligence. He may be a principal in a Russian
organized crime family. Or he may be all of the above and not see any
particular conflict in any of those roles.(170)

How then should U.S. law enforcement agencies proceed in dealing with
corrupt or incompetent foreign law enforcement officials? The U.S.
agency runs the risk of compromising sources of information, the plan
of action for dealing with the threat, and even the lives of
informants. There is no easy answer, for we must deal with foreign
officials, and we cannot afford to wait and react only after some
cataclysmic event. Among the things we must do, however, is to better
coordinate among U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies so
that all concerned know who potential problem personnel are among
foreign agencies.

&gt; &gt;&gt; And that's what happens when you put the military in charge of what
&gt; &gt;&gt; really is a law enforcement problem  (i.e: the war on terrorism)...

&gt; &gt; Well, Dearie, until you're ready to hire, train, provide benefits for
and
&gt; &gt; take care of the families of an international &quot;law enforcement agency&quot;
&gt; &gt; large enough, adequately equipped, appropriately trained , effectively
&gt; &gt; deployed and able to engage (and all the while commanded by leaders for
&gt; &gt; whom results matter more than the vicissitudes of politics and political
&gt; &gt; correctness), that statement is outright, unmitigated Hogwash.  On
several
&gt; &gt; dozen bloody occasions dating back to 1980 and even earlier, a variety
of
&gt; &gt; international and national police agencies have demonstrated every
aspect
&gt; &gt; of incompetence and ineffectiveness in dealing with terrorists and
&gt; &gt; protecting potential targets.

&gt; &gt; Until then, you've no real defense against terrorism than the sort
&gt; &gt; undertaken by your own uniformed forces in Afghanistan.  We adopt such
&gt; &gt; shocked expressions at the Israelis use of missiles fired from helos to
&gt; &gt; target Hamas leaders in Gaza, without seeing the highly personal view
that
&gt; &gt; Israelis have of the capacity of Hamas to carry out terrorist actions on
&gt; &gt; Israeli soil, no matter how many &quot;policemen&quot; and miles of razor wire and
&gt; &gt; fence Israel constructs.

&gt; &gt; I don't know how may &quot;foreign fighters&quot; would chose alternative venues
for
&gt; &gt; their activities if Iraq didn't provide a close and available forum.
&gt; &gt; Nether do you.  Maybe only one on the Vancouver/Victoria ferry, no more
&gt; &gt; effective than the doctors attempting to immolate themselves and the
&gt; &gt; Glasgow airport and all therein.  How about 10?  Just what assurance do
&gt; &gt; you have that the RCMP have every potential terrorist hanging around a
&gt; &gt; mosque in Toronto under surveillance and ready to snatch up?  Not much.
&gt; &gt; Can you suggest some magic police cure for a handful of Saudi &quot;students&quot;
&gt; &gt; arriving, clutching Wahabi tracts, and with something other tah advanced
&gt; &gt; degrees in mind.

&gt; &gt; We don't know how many are out there, any more than we &quot;knew&quot; enough to
&gt; &gt; stop the 9/11 gang.  We can't deploy &quot;police&quot; to Saudi Arabia or
Pakistan
&gt; &gt; or to the dozens of other locales from where the terrorists emerge, from
&gt; &gt; Indonesia to the Central Asian steppe to embittered folks in Bosnia or
&gt; &gt; Kosovo.  For the moment Iraq and Aghanistan are at least focal points
for
&gt; &gt; thir rage and available theaters for their operations.

&gt; &gt; Sadly, in a mutually costly conflict of attrition, armies don't do much
&gt; &gt; better than police, but for all the nasty and ghastly &quot;collateral
damage&quot;
&gt; &gt; in innocent deaths and maiming in Iraq and among the Afghans, if the
&gt; &gt; campaigns there prevent or delay one mad Bali bomber outside a Waikiki
&gt; &gt; Beach nightclub or some guy wrpped in plastique on the passenger deck of
&gt; &gt; the Victoria ferry, &quot;Fair Dinkum&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Just MHO of course.

&gt; &gt; You'd have to be humble to present such a outrageous opinion, just as
&gt; &gt; you'd have to be made to not understand that Canada and Canadians are no
&gt; &gt; less likely to be targets for the current breeds of terrorists.

&gt; Invading Iraq made the world safer from terrorists ... how?  I missed that
&gt; part.

&gt;&gt; They were always 'Acting in support of the civil power'.

&gt;&gt; Army patrols were always accompanied by policemen.

&gt;&gt; At no time did the military make any decisions or run the judicial system
&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt; have talks with anyone but their own masters.

&gt; Looks like a mighty fine distinction to me.

In the UK it's an extremely important one.

Soldiers deployed in support of the civil power are directed by the civilian
authorities and act as auxiliaries to them.

If,  for example,  martial law was declared,  then the military would be in
charge,  but in Ulster they never were and were always under the direct
control of the civilian authorities.

Now in the UK the various intelligence agencies are all civilian and have
civilian heads,  in the USA this does not always seem to be the case.

For example, the head of the NSA in the USA is invariably a serving officer
and that agency employs large numbers of military personnel.

In the UK the head of GCHQ is a civilian,  and possibly not even an
intelligence professional.

Everyone in the UK is horribly sensitive about the use of the military in
situations where they are not insupport of the civil power.

For example,  in the recent floods the military deployments were all at the
request of the local (and very much NOT the national) authorities.

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.
Barbeques on fire by the chalets past the castle headland
I watched the gift shops glitter in the darkness off the Newborough gate
All these moments will be lost in time,  like icecream on the beach
Time for tea.
