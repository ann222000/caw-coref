I'm curious about others experience with negative feedback. The warnings
about leaving a negative are to say the least daunting. Do you know of
others who have been deterred from being honest with their criticism
when it is warrented?

I recently had a bad experience with a comic book dealer whose grading
was atrocious. I sent his books back, then sent his REPLACEMENT books
back as well - basically junk. What gets me is he had over a hundred
feedbacks - all positive. I know this is bogus - I have since learned
from other collectors and dealers that his grading is loose and
inaccurate, but no negatives on eBay!

I posted his first negative (tho I did say I received a prompt refund
from him). I get the impression that unless the seller is a thief, no
one else dares to post a negative.

I'd like to hear about others' experieces.

In about a year of buying/selling on eBay, I've left one negative
feedback and one neutral feedback, the rest (over 100) have been
positive. I think some folks are hesitant about leaving negs because
they fear they'll get retaliatory feedback. Yes, there's a possibility
that will happen, but if you don't leave the bad feedback, you let the
next person who bids on that person's items get burned too.

In my listings I state, &quot;Please don't bid on my items if you have hidden
or excessive negative feedback.&quot; I realize that sooner or later, if
we've left negs, we'll get negged back, so I allow a certain leeway -
we're all gonna have battle scars sooner or later.

But time and again, I see folks on the Support Board asking for a user
to be suspended, but refuse to leave negative feedback because of fear
of reprisal. Without the negs, eBay can't suspend them (unless they also
have other problems with the person like false contact info), but folks
expect eBay to suspend others based on their tirade on the Support
Board - it don't work that way! :) We can all live with a few battle
scars (negs) in order to keep eBay a safer place to buy and sell.

Have fun, Michele

Hello,
I've been active on ebay for about a month, bought several dozen items, and
have wanted to leave negative feedback, but have not. I'm a bit new and not
too sure what warrants such feedback:
1) inaccurate descriptions
2) deceptive descriptions that leave out important info--like damage to item
3) exorbitant shipping and handling charges (sometimes $12 on a $6 item).
4) sellers who will accept Money Order only

Have left positive feedback for sellers when goods received are damaged or
ruined, but only when my money is refunded.

Most people have been honest and forthcoming, with only one or two exhibiting
deceptive behavior.

"/>  First of all, #3 and #4 should be a part of the listing. If you don't like the
terms of the listing, don't bid, as it is the seller's right to set their terms.
However, if shipping charges aren't listed on something I'm interested in, I
e-mail the seller and ask for that info before bidding.

For inaccurate descriptions, if you have any questions, ask them before bidding.
(And please don't wait 'til an hour before the auction ends to ask your
questions; you may not get an answer in time.) If you receive an item that
isn't what it should
be, e-mail the seller as soon as you receive the package, and nicely explain your
concern. In nearly 400 transactions on eBay,
I've had one return. I was happy to refund the money just to keep the customer
happy, even though I didn't agree with her reason for returning. I think most
sellers with integrity feel the same way.

If you run into a bad apple and feel the need to leave negative feedback, do it
as a last resort, and don't be emotional in your feedback. &quot;Item not as
described, unable to reach a settlement with seller&quot; is less inflammatory than
&quot;That idiot sent me a piece of junk and won't give my money back.&quot; In any case,
you must be prepared that the seller may retaliate with feedback for you.

"/> I really don't see any of these as a reason to leave negative feedback, unless
you cannot resolve the problem with the seller. For example, inaccurate
description or damage info missing: I have HONESTLY listed items, and sold
them only to discover a previously unnoticed scratch or something like that
upon packing to ship the item (I sell a lot of old silver and silver plate). I
will then e-mail the buyer, and explain the situation, and offer to refund
their money.

Of course, I have always made it a policy to refund purchase price and shipping
if the customer is upset. Even if they don't know what they're talking about.
Example: &quot;You listed this as sterling, it is not marked sterling, there's just
the number 925 on the bottom.&quot;

I'd rather refund, and have a satisfied customer. About 5 of our 320 feedback
comments are from people who returned items, and got a refund. Comments like:
&quot;Really honest folks, great to deal with!&quot;&quot;What a sweetie, eBay needs more
sellers like this&quot;. I didn't make a dime off of them, but I made a good name.
Worth more than $$$...

I have left negative feedback a few times:

The guy who wrote me a check on a closed account, and never made good on it,
and ignored e-mail.

14 year old who went on an eBay bidding spree, won like 100 items, and never
answered e-mail or paid anyone.

The guy in Canada who I paid for some nice Shelley china that he first claimed
was lost in the Canadian mail strike, then said I had never paid him (Even
though I had the money order reciept).

The woman who went on a bidding spree, then refused to pay for anything,
stating &quot;What are you going to do about it?&quot;

The first 3 of these folks were subsequently kicked off eBay, thanks to my
feedback, and that of others.

There's a lot of Caveat Emptor at work on e-bay.

If the description does not state the condition - as perfect, or less than

that list a 'handling' fee. Ask for an estimate of shipping costs before
you bid. That $6 item might have been a lead ingot.

"/> You should always attempt to resolve problems with the seller, first,
before you bid, and second, after you receive an item. The seller has no
way of knowing that you are not satisfied if you don't communicate that
fact to him. The seller should always be allowed the opportunity to 'make
good' on an item before you leave negative feedback for him.

It sounds like you have not been communicating BEFORE you bid, and so you
are disatisfied when you find that things are not as you imagined.

Good luck in the future, and remember, read those listings!!

Is it my imagination, or is this a trend.

Six months ago, if I put up an auction listing, I'd almost assuredly
receive several questions about the item. Lately, I have been getting few.
I love questions. They bring up things I could never think, and often
helps me find problems I would never have been aware of.

Even more importantly, it certainly cuts down on after auction problems.
