Growing Pains
^*^*^
&quot;How to translate a right mental conviction into
a right emotional result,
and so into easy, happy, and good living -
well, that's not only the neurotic's problem,
it's the problem of life itself for all of us who have got
to the point of real willingness to hew to right principles.
Even then, as we hew away, peace and joy may still elude us.
That's the place so many of us AA oldsters have come to.
And it's a hell of a spot, literally.&quot;

Thought to Consider . . .

Minds are like parachutes -
they won't work unless they're open.

Ourselves
From &quot;Getting out of the 'if' trap:&quot;

&quot;We drunks are very 'iffy' people.
During our drinking days, we were often
full of ifs, as well as liquor.  A lot
of our dreams started out, 'IF only...'
&quot;Over and over, we have found we cannot
stay sober long just for the sake of
wife, husband, children, lover, parents,
other relative, or friend, nor for the
sake of a job, nor to please a boss (or
doctor or judge or creditor) -- not for
ANYONE other than ourselves.&quot;

A LOOK BACKWARD

First, we take a look backward and try to discover where we have been at
fault; next we make a vigorous attempt to repair the damage we have done; . . .

TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 77

As a traveler on a fresh and exciting A.A. journey of recovery,  I
experienced a newfound peace of mind and the horizon appeared clear and bright, rather
than obscure and dim.  Reviewing my life to discover where I had been at fault
seemed to be such an arduous and dangerous task.  It was painful to pause and
look backward.  I was afraid I might stumble!  Couldn't I put the past out of
my mind and just live in my new golden present?  I realized that those in the
past whom I had harmed stood between me and my desire to continue my movement
toward serenity.  I had to ask for courage to face those persons from my life
who still lived in my conscience, to recognize and deal with the guilt that
their presence produced in me.  I had to look at the damage I had done, and
become willing to make amends.  Only then could my journey of the spirit resume.

Leadership in A.A.

No society can function well without able leadership at all its levels, and
A.A. can be no exception. But we A.A.'s sometimes cherish the thought that we
can do without much personal leadership at all. We are apt to warp the
traditional idea of &quot;principles before personalities&quot; around to such a point
that there would be no &quot;personality&quot; in leadership whatever. This would imply
rather faceless robots trying to please everybody.
A leader in A.A. service is a man (or woman) who can personally put
principles, plans, and policies into such dedicated and effective action that
the rest of us naturally want to back him up and help him with his job. When
a leader powerdrives us badly, we rebel; but when he too meekly becomes an
order-taker and he exercises no judgment of his own -- well, he really isn't
a leader at all.

TWELVE CONCEPTS, pp. 39, 40
*~*~*~*~*^ Big Book Quote ^*~*~*~*~*
&quot;Now we go out to our fellows and repair the damage done in the
past. We attempt to sweep away the debris which has accumulated out
of our effort to live on self-will and run the show ourselves. If we
haven't the will to do this, we ask until it comes. Remember it was
agreed at the beginning we would go to any lengths for victory over
alcohol.&quot;

A.A. Thought for the Day

&quot;There was nothing left for us but to pick up the simple kit of spiritual
tools laid at our feet by Alcoholics Anonymous. By doing so, we have a
spiritual experience which revolutionizes our whole attitude toward life,
toward others, and toward God's universe. The central fact of our lives today
is the absolute certainty that our Creator has entered into our hearts and
lives there in a way that is indeed miraculous. He has commenced to
accomplish those things for us that we could never do for ourselves.&quot; Have I
let God come into my life?

Meditation for the Day

The moment a thing seems wrong to you or a person's actions to be not what
you think they should be, at that moment begins your obligation and
responsibility to pray for those wrongs to be righted or that person to be
changed. What is wrong in your surroundings or in the people you know? Think
about these things and make these matters your responsibility. Not to
interfere or be a busybody, but to pray that a change may come through your
influence. You may see lives altered and evils banished in time. You can become
a force for good wherever you are.

Prayer for the Day

I pray that I may be a co-worker with God. I pray  that I may help people by
my example.
