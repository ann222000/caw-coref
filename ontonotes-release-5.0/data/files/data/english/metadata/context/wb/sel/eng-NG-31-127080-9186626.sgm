I;ve been finding out more stuff about this recently, and it's
interesting a lot of these anti-glycation anti-aging supplements
also seem to be good for diabetes:

(about benfotiamine)

I don;t have the references to back up the other ones yet,
I jsut came up with some posts about it on the sci.life.extension
usenet group, but apparenly lysine is also good for anti-glycation
and &quot;scavenges blood sugar.&quot;

http://tinyurl.com/27q6zu

Aspirin may inhibit AGE formation
(also talks about free L-Lysine and &quot;free glucose
scavenging&quot;).

I think I certainly have enough supplements to deal with.
Sugar-free jello really does help.

I'm trying to do my part here too.....

I love sugar free jello! Last night I had some low fat ricotta cheese that I
added water to thin it down a bit, more like a thick sauce, added Splenda to
taste and sliced strawberries. Nice night time snack accompanied by sugar
free jello.

oh, well......the jello is good for me too.   Its helps with getting
down all the extra supplements that are too much to take
with food. I mean, there's too many!  bleah.

I think I'm getting it worked out though.
