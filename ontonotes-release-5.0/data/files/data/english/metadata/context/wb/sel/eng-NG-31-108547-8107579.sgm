Now today I had a very interesting thought and would like to share it
with you. It would seem to verge on
science fiction but I suspect there is no theoretical or principle to
stop it from becoming true. And I soon
realized that it would be a good part of this book on Brain Locus
theory.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; new  book: &quot;How the Mind Works; Brain as a Radio-Receiver/TV theory&quot;

Let me outline the idea. How to make a human the size of an insect,
say a grasshopper or even smaller such
as the size of a ant. Is there any theoretical or principle that says
we cannot do that? No. So how can we
do that?

Contrary to opinions I believe it may be very easy. Suppose we did a
genome on dwarf humans and found
the genetic code that makes for smallness in size. Suppose we select
that coding for smallness. So that
we know precisely the genetic coding that governs size and we keep
decreasing the size
of the human borne to these selective traits. Now we biotech engineer
that coding until we reach the size
we want-- humans the size of ants.

Now why biotech create such a human? Well perhaps humans the size of
ants may survive a catastrophe
where all other humans perish. And another reason would be that humans
the size of ants can be easily
to travel space since the size of the rocket need only be the size of
a robot we casually send up. And humans
the size of ants can explore the deepest depths of the oceans because
we can build a vessel to hold those
tiny humans and go to the bottom of the ocean or go to the deepest
mines or drill holes.

So I outlined how to create humans the size of ants and I indicated of
what use that would be.

But now let me talk a bit about the science knowledge we may gain if
we created humans the size of ants.
If my Brain Locus theory is correct, then a human the size of an ant
would have a brain and mind that is
equal to a normal sized human. That this ant-sized human is fully
capable of doing mental processes as
a normal sized human since the mind is but a atom which receives the
thoughts from the Nucleus of the
Atom Totality.

So that if we actually create a human the size of an ant, the great
advantage of a space explorer or
deep ocean or deep drill hole explorer is that the tiny human will
communicate back with the rest of
humanity over what was seen, as if a full sized human had been there.

And it makes me wonder also, if alien life were to travel to far off
distant solar systems, that they would
probably have miniaturized themselves and so, if any aliens reached
our planet, their spaceship maybe
in the size of a car and their bodies the size of ants.

But what most fascinates me about this shrinkage of size of humans is
that the brain and mind are unaffected
and function as a normal sized human. Such would prove the brain locus
theory, since one atom is all
that a mind is. This one atom is the radio or TV receiver of all the
messages shot from the Nucleus of the
Atom Totality and forcing us to have that specific &quot;thought or
action&quot;. So as we miniaturize humans we
retain a mind that is equal to the mind of normal sized humans.

Some time ago I posted on ET and flying saucers. I concluded that they
could not possibly exist because of trends in emerging technology
(also rather ironically designaed as ET).

In fact out brains need to be the size they are to function, and the
need to supply the brain with Oxygen and food sets our size.

If however we view a post singularity scenario, we could create a
distributed system. This would have considerable advantages if what we
wanted to do was explore. Again I said that if ET wanted to come to
Earth a &quot;real&quot; spacecraft would be very small. Exploration would be
done by a distributed system, whose individual components were the
size of dragonflies, if that. BTW - our speed of thought (10Hz) is a
distance of 15,000km. Hence a post singularity ET could distribute
himself over 15,000km.

Are there any lessons to be learnt for the more immediate future? Yes,
I think there are. Andrew Ng at Stanford is developing a flat pack
assembler. If we were to send a flatpack assembler to the Moon or
Mars, we could have a redundant mission involving many small identical
spacecraft. This could well be the way to go in space.

Um, excuse me, but do you actually have any DATA that Brain/mind
functions are unaffected by size.  I would love to hear that &quot;Size

You did notice that the validity of this theory depends on the

If you couldn't store enough information in a bug size brain,
you could solve that problem,
by &quot;bluetoothing&quot; them to a vast central storage like Google,
where they could access all the info they needed.

You only need a small program to handle
reflexes, &quot;fight or flight&quot; reactions,
and almost all other situations.

Maybe small, military, WAN robots will be designed
that get their orders and necessary data from
a central data store.

Lobotomies are routinely performed on young people with diseases of
the brain, where
an entire hemisphere, or 1/2 the brain is removed. And the person
coming out of such
operations have a &quot;mind&quot; the same if not better than the person before
the operation.

Also, the brain size of many famous scientists vary along with women
scientists
brain size where the size of Lise Meitner was very much smaller than
the size of
Niels Bohr brain.

The size of dwarf and pygmy brains are very much smaller than the
largest human
brains, yet they perform mental functions the same.

The Brain Locus theory says that the size of the brain has all to do
about the reaction
to the &quot;incoming thought of a message shot by the Nucleus of the Atom
Totality&quot;. To have
a mind one needs only one atom to receive the &quot;shot thoughts&quot; , but to
perform some action
or reaction to those incoming thoughts, you need a larger volume of
brain mass to tell muscles
and other tissue what to do next.

A TV or radio needs only a tiny crystal to receive the incoming
signal, and the rest of the radio
or TV is how to display that incoming signal.

So when we shrink a Human down to the size of an ant, if the Brain
Locus theory is correct, that
miniature human has the same amount of Mind as a full sized human.
That the bulk of the brain
mass is for muscle and bodily responses.

This is what the Brain Locus theory posits, that the Mind requires
only one atom or a few atoms
as the crystal receiver, and the rest of the bulk matter of the brain
are to respond to the incoming
thoughts from the Nucleus of the Atom Totality such as reflexs of
muscle or fight or flight responses.

Perhaps the military has a need for miniature and micro humans the
size of ants who could spy,
and thus provide the funding to start a program of genetic
engineering. We locate the genes that
control size and we &quot;select those genes&quot; and keep reducing the size of
progeny. If the Brain Locus
theory is correct, the mind of a ant-size-human is as sharp and smart
as the full sized human. The
only difference is scale.

Sorry I didn't address or answer that part of the question about
memory.

In the Brain Locus theory, since all thoughts are out of body and
coming from the
Nucleus of the Atom Totality, there is no memory within the brain
itself.

Think about it. If all your thoughts and feelings were shot neutrinos
or photons to
the Brain Locus, then there is no memory storage within the Brain
itself.

Do we ask if a radio or TV has a memory bank? No. The radio and TV
have
a progression of incoming signals shot from radio stations or TV
stations far
away.

So what is a memory? A memory is another photon or neutrino shot from
the Nucleus
that forces you to have that thought in a progression of thoughts.

Our memories are not something stored chemically in our brain mass.
Our memories
of past is just another photon or neutrino in a progression of photons
and neutrinos that
impinge on our Brain Locus atom.

So that in shrinking a human down to the size of an ant has no effect
on &quot;memory&quot; since the
bulk mass of a brain exists to perform reactions by the rest of the
body and since the rest of the
body is in proportional scale to a shrunk human with a shrunk brain
mass, that this shrunk human
has equal intelligence to a full sized human.

All of course, provided the Brain Locus theory is correct.

What is a &quot;post singularity scenario&quot;? (I take it that you're jumping
thru a bosonic gateway...)

Our puny species of hominid may already be part of a universally
distributed system (ref. The Matrix). If you're looking at
&quot;intelligent
systems&quot; portability sized for the sake of &quot;location&quot; alone, these
type of transfers would require some kind of abelian bremstrahlung
shielding in order to reduce the loss of QCD effect, so you're mission
statement becomes self-defeating unless you include &quot;Purpose
is to explore for abundant off-world resources, life-supporting
environments, and high metallicity G2V suns&quot;.

- This would make you're distributed system &quot;precursor&quot; to a larger
scale expedition.
