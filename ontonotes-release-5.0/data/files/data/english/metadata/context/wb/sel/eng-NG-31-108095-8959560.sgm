My dog, Bill, is doing butt circles on the rug and he hasn't taken a
shit in three days. It's driving me and my cat, Gates, crazy. It began
right after I started feeding him a new brand of dog food from Sam's
Club. Any suggestions?

By the way, don't tell me to get another dog and don't tell me to buy a
different dogfood. I can't afford it.

Canned pumpkin.  I have a 16lb hound that gets a tablespoon with each
meal.  The pumpkin is good fibre that acts like metamucil and the dog
loves it.  Just get the cheap pumpkin (not pie filling) at the grocery
store.  My vet told me about it.  He used to do the same thing.
Doesn't do it anymore.  Also helps clean out the anal glands.

Just buy the dog a Mac and let him order his own food. He may still send

Seems like there's a lurking Michael Vick joke here somewhere.
I lost my dog once, at an out-of-the-way irrigation lake just
north of the New Mexico border. I must have caught a dozen 20&quot;
rainbows that day.....all the same size....at the end of 10
miles of gravel road, past a half a dozen gates and no trespassing signs.

When I left I heard the dog hit the tailgate, so I knew she
made it in to the truck, and I knew she made it home with me.
Or so I thought.  3-4 days later when I still hadn't seen her,
I figured a Chicano farmer must'have shot her for chicken stealing.
That shit happened all the time, down there then.

So a week or two later I went back to fish again. And there
she was, my good old dog Murphy, still alive after 2 weeks in
middle of no where. Murphy nearly knocked me over with joy.
I said &quot;Murphy, you wonderful dog, you survived in the wild
for weeks. What did you eat?&quot;

Murphy wagged her tail so hard her whole body shook. And then she
put her head down, openned her mouth and womped down about a pound of
duck shit with two or three quick bites.

She drug her butt for a month after that. Died of old age
a decade later.

Well, when you change brands you should make it a gradual transition.  Not

don't work. That dog is still dumber than a rock.

Did the pumpkin thing for my grand dog during a tough stretch and it
works. She also gets the squirts when she eats Frosty Paws so that
might help. Besides she loves the stuff.
Of course we don't feed her that anymore until just before we take her
back to my daughter's house.

Apples may work, with the stipulation of NO SEEDS.  I know that some
hounds have problems with certain fruits and that pumpkin is fairly
benign.  The only problem with apples is that the seeds contain trace
amounts of cyanide.  Humans can filter this out, but dogs can't.  It
would gradually build up in their systems and cause them harm.

RW's dog's problem is probably over by now (one way or the other!),
but I once gave a cat a suppository for constipation and it worked
like a charm in about five minutes...I suppose it'd work on a dog too.

As long as dogs are a subject, our brittany climbed the fence
yesterday and when we got home from work she limped into the driveway
from the desert scrub. Her one front paw was quite swollen, I figured
she broke or sprained it from the jump down the fence (now about six
feet high at the spot she climbs as I keep adding to it to keep her
in!), but she's not limping anymore and it's still swollen so now I'm
guessing maybe a minor rattlesnake bite. She nosed one a few nights
ago along the driveway about 10 feet from where I was standing waiting
for the dogs to come back, and I was shocked she didn't get bitten
that night. This latest incident couldn't have been that snake (it's
already buried), but we've had a bumper crop of 'em this year, it
seems.

And saturday is the start of dove season; looks like I'll have to find
my own downed birds if I'm lucky enough to get out...
