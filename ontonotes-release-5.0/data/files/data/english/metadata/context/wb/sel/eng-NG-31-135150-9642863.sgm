What I have for sale is a G4 iBook with 512 Megs of Ram
It has an airport extreme card.
Combo Drive
The original battery still works fine, and I also have a 2nd brand-new
never used battery, too.
Screen is bright with no dead pixels.
Video adapter to use a 2nd monitor.
60 gig hard drive
Power adapter
Apple bluetooth mouse
But the kicker is, I tripped over the cord almost 3 months ago and the
left hinge is dislocated or broken. It still holds the screen up fine,
but it slants to the right. I have very gingerly closed and opened it
a few times, but it should be fixed right. I looked up online how to
replace the hinge and it's way to many steps for me.
