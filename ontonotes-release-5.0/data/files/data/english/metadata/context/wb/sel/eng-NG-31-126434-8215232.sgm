Upon Your Feet

I did not just wake up one day
Working the steps I changed my way
It took God my sponsor also the steps
Along with lots of meetings you see
Day to day I had learned how to live free
I did not get here over night
It took years of working the steps
In order for me to get right
I really had to give time
Time you see
I took a long time for me
For me to learn how to live free
So be patient when you first get here
God along with a sponsor will ease your fear
In recovery the more you give the more you get
Today it is so beautiful to live a life free of regret
Always remember to be honest and true
Once your willing God will help you
Always remember just for today
Be kind be patient
Along the way
Keep your eyes open
As you make your way
We know what your going through
We were all one day just like you
To yourself always be true
When you get your feet
Planted upon the ground
At that point you can
Then turn around
To give it away
Just for today

Just For Today
August 15                                 Over time, not over night

&quot;We found that we do not recover physically, mentally, or
spiritually overnight.&quot; Basic Text, p.27

Have you ever approached a recovery celebration with the feeling
that you should be further along in your recovery than you are?
Maybe you have listened to newcomers sharing in meetings, members
with much less clean time, and thought, &quot;But I'm just barely beginning
to understand what they're talking about!&quot;

It's odd that we should come into recovery thinking that we will
feel wonderful right away or no longer have any difficulty handling
life's twists and turns. We expect our physical problems to correct
themselves, our thinking to become rational, and a fully developed
spiritual life to manifest itself overnight. We forget that we spent
years
abusing our bodies, numbing our minds, and suppressing our
awareness of a Higher Power. We cannot undo the damage in a day.
We can, however, apply the next step, go to the next meeting, help the
next newcomer. We heal and recover bit by bit - not overnight, but over
time.

Just for today:  My body will heal a little, my mind will become a
little
clearer, and my relationship with my Higher Power will strengthen.

Opening Up To Change

Self-searching is the means by which we bring new vision,
action, and grace to bear upon the dark and negative side of
our natures.  With it comes the development of that kind of
humility that makes it possible for us to receive God's help. . . .
we find that bit by bit we can discard the old life -- the one
that did not work -- for a new life that can and does work
under any conditions whatever.
AS BILL SEES IT, pp. 10, 8

I have been given a daily reprieve contingent upon my
spiritual condition, provided I seek progress, not perfection.
To become ready for change, I practice willingness, opening
myself to possibilities of change.  If I realize there are defects
that hinder my usefulness in A.A. and toward others, I become
ready by meditating and receiving direction.  &quot;Some of us have
tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we
let go absolutely&quot; (Alcoholics Anonymous, p. 58).  To let go and
let God, I need only surrender my old ways to Him; I no longer
fight nor do I try to control, but simply believe that, with God's
help, I am changed and affirming this belief makes me ready.
I empty myself to be full of awareness, light, and love, and I am
ready to face each day with hope.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day by Hazelden/ August 15th

A.A. Thought for the Day

&quot;Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic. Commencing to drink
after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time as bad as
ever. If we have admitted we are alcoholics, we must have no
reservations of any kind, nor any lurking notion that some day
we will be immune to alcohol. What sort of thinking dominates
an alcoholic who repeats time after time the desperate
experiment of the first drink? Parallel with sound reasoning,
there inevitably runs some insanely trivial excuse for taking
the first drink. There is little thought of what the terrific
consequences may be.&quot; Have I given up all excuses for taking
a drink?

Meditation for the Day

&quot;Where two or three are banded together, I will be there in
the midst of them.&quot; When God finds two or three people in
union, who only want His will to be done, who want only to serve
Him, He has a plan that can be revealed to them. The grace of
God can come to people who are together in one place with one
accord. A union like this is miracle-working. God is able to use
such people. Only good can come through such consecrated
people, brought together in unified groups for a single purpose
and of a single mind.

Prayer for the Day

I pray that I may be part of a unified group. I pray that I may
contribute my share to its consecrated purpose.

Today's Thought
AUGUST 15

You are reading from the book The Language of Letting Go.
Melody Beattie ©

Leaving Room for Feelings

We need to allow enough room for others and ourselves to
have and work through our feelings.

We are people, not robots. An important part of us - who we are,
how we grow, how we live - is connected to our emotional center.
We have feelings, sometimes difficult ones, sometimes disruptive
ones, and sometimes explosive ones that need to be worked
through.

By facing and working through these feelings we and others
grow. In relationships, whether it is a love relationship, a
friendship, a family relationship, or a close business relationship,
people need room to have and work through their feelings.

Some call it &quot;going through the process.&quot;

It is unreasonable to expect ourselves or others to not need
time and room to work through feelings. We will be setting
ourselves and our relationships up for failure if we do not
allow this time and room in our life.

We need time to work through feelings. We need the space
and permission to work through these feelings in the awkward,
uncomfortable, sometimes messy way that people work through
feelings.

This is life. This is growth. This is okay.

We can allow room for feelings. We can let people have time
and permission to go through their feelings. We do not have to
keep others or ourselves under such a tight rein. While we work
through our feelings we do not have to expend unnecessary
energy reacting to each feeling others or we have. We don't
have to take all our feelings, and others' feelings, so seriously
while others or we are in the process of working through them.

Let the feelings flow and trust where the flow is taking you.

I can set reasonable boundaries for behavior, and still leave
room for a range of emotions.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Keep It Simple*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Alone Again, Naturally
by Lionel Fisher

It scares us more than anything except death.  Being alone.

Our fear of aloneness is so ingrained that given the choice of
being by ourselves or being with others we opt for safety in
numbers, even at the expense of lingering in painful, boring,
or totally unredeeming company.

And yet more of us than ever are alone.

While many Americans have their solo lifestyles thrust on
them -- people die, people go away -- a huge and growing
population is choosing to be alone.

In 1955, one in ten U.S.  households consisted of one person.
By 1999, the proportion was one in three.  Single men and
women accounted for 38.9 million of the nations 110.5 million
households.  Sixty percent of them were under the age of
sixty-five; roughly 60 percent of them were women.

On the cusp of the new century, approximately 14.3 million
American women and 24.6 million American men over the age
of twenty-five lived alone, according to the U.S.  Census Bureau.

By 1999, single parents with children under the age of
eighteen made up 27.3 percent of the nations 70.9 million
family households.  Among them were 2.1 million father-child
and 9.8 million mother-child families.  Forty-two percent of
single-parent mothers had never wed.

Meanwhile, many more Americans are divorcing.  In less
than three decades, reports the Census Bureau, the number of
divorced men and women has more than quadrupled -- to a total
of 18.3 million in 1996, compared to 4.3 million in 1970.

And many more Americans are not marrying.  The number of
adult men and women who have remained single has more
than doubled in thirty years-to 44.9 million in 1996 from 21.4
million in 1970.

&quot;Never before in American history has living alone been the
predominant lifestyle,&quot; observes demographic trends analyst
Cheryl Russell, who predicts that single-person households
will become the most common household type in the United
States by the year 2005.

Nonetheless, we persist in the conviction that a solitary
existence is the harshest penalty life can mete out.  We loathe
being alone -- anytime, anywhere, for too long, for whatever
reason.

From childhood we're conditioned to accept that when alone
we instinctively ache for company, that loners are outsiders
yearning to get in rather than people who are content with
their own company.

Alone, we squander life by rejecting its full potential and
wasting its remaining promises.  Alone, we accept that
experiences unshared are barely worthwhile, that sunsets
viewed singly are not as spectacular, that time spent apart is
fallow and pointless.

And so we grow old believing we are nothing by ourselves,
steadfastly shunning the opportunities for self-discovery and
personal growth that solitude could bring us.

We've even coined a word for those who prefer to be by
themselves: antisocial, as if they were enemies of society.
They are viewed as friendless, suspect in a world that goes
around in twos or more and is wary of solitary travelers.

People who need people are threatened by people who don't.
The idea of seeking contentment alone is heretical, for society
steadfastly decrees that our completeness lies in others.

Instead, we cling to each other for solace, comfort, and safety,
believing that we are nothing alone -- insignificant, unfulfilled,
lost -- accepting solitude in the tiniest, most reluctant of slices,
if at all, which is tragic, for it rejects God's precious gift of life.

Ironically, most of us crave more intimacy and companionship
than we can bear.  We begrudge ourselves, our spouses, and
our partners sufficient physical and emotional breathing room,
and then bemoan the suffocation of our relationships.

To point out these facts is not to suggest we should abandon
all our close ties.  Medical surveys show that the majority of
elderly people who live alone, yet maintain frequent contact
with relatives and friends, rate their physical and emotional
well-being as &quot;excellent.&quot; Just as an apple a day kept the doctor
away when they were young, an active social calendar appears
to serve the same purpose now.

But we need to befriend and enjoy ourselves as well.

How does that old song go?  &quot;I've been to paradise, but I've never
been to me....&quot;

&quot;We must relearn to be alone,&quot; exhorts Anne Morrow Lindbergh
in her inspirational book, Gift from the Sea.  &quot;Instead of planting
our solitude with dream blossoms, we choke the space with
continuous music, chatter, and companionship to which we do not
even listen.  It is simply there to fill the vacuum.&quot;

&quot;We can't stand the silence,&quot; said Agnes de Mille, &quot;because silence
includes thinking.  And if we thought, we would have to face
ourselves.&quot;

Let us learn, then, from those in search of what they have not been
able to find and hold in the press of humanity around them: peace
of mind, gentleness of heart, calmness of spirit, daily joy.  Those
who are mastering the art of flying solo and soaring to their highest
human potential.  Who have come to understand that to know and
to love and to be of value to others, they first must know and love
and value themselves; that to find their way in the world, they have
to start by finding themselves.

&quot;Before we can surrender ourselves we must become ourselves,&quot;
Thomas Merton pointed out.  &quot;For no one can give up what he does
not possess:&quot; They are the men and women who have found nobility
in turning to themselves first when facing life's challenges -- and not
blaming anyone else if they fail.

Who find silence eloquent rather than empty.

Who have discovered that being alone can impose a startling
clarity in their lives, achieved through the personal reflection we
seem to allow ourselves only in times of severe loss and intense
grief.

Who trust their aloneness, using it to embrace and nurture their
individuality, to celebrate themselves in their own special ways.

Who have become born companions to the best friends they'll
ever have. Guess who?

Who are living alone well, even magnificently, in full affirmation of
the preciousness of life?

The premise of this book is timeless and simple: there are gifts we
can only give ourselves, lessons no one else can teach us, triumphs
we must achieve alone.

It is all right to be alone, to want to be alone, to be alone and not
lonely -- even to be lonely at times -- because the rewards of
solitude are worth the deprivations.

Above all, we must hail the silence.

I Choose Joy
Meditation by Orin and DaBen

I choose the path of joy.

I am now willing to release struggle,
and embrace the path of joy.

I relax my body.

I bring relaxation
into my face, head, and neck.

I adjust my posture
so that energy flows easily through me.

I allow my emotions
to grow quiet and calm.

My mind is now becoming serene.
I am at peace with the world.

As I breathe in, I draw in light.

As I breathe out,
I release any thoughts or feelings
I do not want.

I feel the light of my soul all around me,
embracing me with its love.
I expand into the light of my soul.

My soul sings a song of joy.
I draw my soul's joy into my being.

I draw my soul's joy
into the cells of my body.

I draw my soul's joy into my emotions.
I draw my soul's joy into my thoughts.

I sound a note of joy
that reverberates throughout my being.

I think of an area of my life
in which I would like more joy.

As I think of this area of my life,
I ask my soul to permeate this area
with its note of joy.

I affirm that I can release anything
in this area of my life
that does not bring me joy.

I ask my soul to assist me
in releasing any thoughts,
emotions,
attitudes,
and behaviors
that do not contribute to
my having a joyful life.

I believe that I can have joy in this
and in every area of my life.

I open to and experience joy now.

I am aware of my inner being
throughout the day.

I connect with my soul often,
and as I do,
I draw in its joy.

Joy becomes the keynote of my life.

Solvent is the Mind  ©

Our minds like solvent water
Forever void the unnecessary
accumulated impedimenta
of days, weeks, years;
a cleansing process
to make space/room for
new experiences to face, encounter, listen for

Fresh flow the crystal waters of the mind
Ready to fill and engulf itself into a creative inlet
Ready to embrace new textures and substances
To build itself upon
Cycling with time, it is forever new, fresh…
Unless we dam it behind a wall
of worry and stagnation -
Unless we cling to the old
and dead debris of our lives

Let your mind flow gently but steadfastly onward
Outward, where new encounters will suffuse
Build it, with the breath of raw life

Your creativity deserves to have
Its doors swing wide open
A collection of vistas to power a world
So nurture your soul …
Forever the river

A Spell For Sobriety

I think I am like
Magikians of old
Seeking potions
To make me bold
Trying to be heard
Like braying old asses,
Mumbo jumbo and
Frantic passes.
In my greatness
I will make them heed
And supply me
With all I want
And all that I need.

But my potions are poison
And my spells
Are lies.
And my greatness
Even to myself
Quickly dies.

Dejected, rejected
Confused, confounded
My responsibility for
All my wrongs
Is completely unfounded.

So in my dark lair
I hide and mope
Seeking false comfort
In my magical dope.

I drop, I puff
I drink, I swill
And slowly all trace
Of my spirit
I try to kill.

And lonely in my cave
That lovely darkened tomb,
I begin to wonder
If
In God's love
There is room?

If I confess
If I relinquish
My hold,
Maybe with GOD'S
Help
I can peacefully
Grow old.

With my last denial
And my first
Sober breath
I pray to GOD
LORD,
Take control
I am causing
My death.

I then know
So many hurts
I need to attend,
So many wrongs
To so many people
I must make amends.

Forgive me
For I have forsaken you.
O GOD show me
What to do,
No one can save me
No one but you.

And from above
In my heart
I hear,
&quot;Throw away the
poisons, potions
dope and the beer.
Live each day
A day at a time,
Give all control
To me
And  all that is
Mine.
Go find others
Trapped in the hell
They have built,
And I will make those
Sows ears
Into purses of silk!&quot;
For all those fallen
Sufferers in denial
Saying NAY NAY
All will have a new
A new chance
For life
In the magickal
Brotherhood
Of AA.
Step lively
For there are steps
To live.
For now is your chance
To live and forgive.

Reach Out

I reach out when
I am at the end of my rope
Call my friends who help me cope
God has blessed me with many friends
Who come and help to tie up my loose ends
When I am down and feeling low
It is to a meeting that I must go
I share my ups and I share my downs
I head to a place where love can be found
I must always remember where I can go
Down deep inside I really know
I live my life with in today
Pray to God and share my way
Sober by Gods love and grace
I give Him praise in everyplace
God has filled me with His love
He lives with everyone not high above
Reach out when you need someone
It means a lot when your day is done
Just reach out someone is always near
To help over come all of your fear
