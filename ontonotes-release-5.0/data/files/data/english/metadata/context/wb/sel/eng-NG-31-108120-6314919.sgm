Do you have to pay up the $600? I remember seeing something for sale
that was quite cheap, and came with a full version of PS, but I don't
remember what it was, maybe a cheap printer or something.

The full-blown Photoshop CS can be had for $300 through a couple of
special licensing arrangements (upgrades, promotions, academic
licenses).  Do you have a student in the household?

Or, there is Photoshop Elements, which does an awful lot for $60-80.

Photoshop Elements has most of the functionality and it's under 60
bucks.

If you work for a nonprofit they can buy full Photoshop for 60 or so.

Sometimes a piece of hardware will come with a free copy of PS. We got
our first (PS 4 IIRC) copy free with an Agfa scanner, many years ago
now. It wasn't a cheap scanner but it was cheaper than PS at the time I
believe.

The problem is, you're looking at PS now so you probably don't want to
wait too long for it. Hanging around hoping it'll get included in some
bundle may make you worse off than spending the money now. However, if
you find it in a package available now, and you don't want the hardware
it comes with, you may find you can sell the hardware on eBay and the
total cost of is then the difference between what you paid for the
hardware and what you sold the hardware for.

I think, these days, you're more likely to see PS Elements rather than
full PS ship with hardware.

Unless you absolutely need Photoshop for professional reasons (your
office standard, for example) you can get most of its functionality and a
more classic Windows interface (which I prefer) in the far cheaper Paint
Shop Pro.

Photoshop was designed for professional graphic artists rather than
digital photographers; the shareware Picture Window was designed for
photographers, but its interface remains rather non-standard and
confusing (again, IMHO).

PSP is not regarded as "professional" by Adobe chauvinists, but has most
of the Photoshop features needed for handling digital photos and also
accepts many Photoshop plugins.  It has many fans here, and certainly is
the most powerful and feature-rich of all the inexpensive Photoshop
alternatives which seem aimed at lazy novices who merely want automated
basic enhancement.

Charles - I know and use PSP all the time, love it. But it has
limitations on adjusting color and exposure, requiring a lot of try
it, undo, adjust, try again, undo, adjust.... And it has no white
balance adjuster, as far as I know. But for small touch-ups, its fab!

Of course it does!  Ver. 10 menubar/adjust/color balance gives you a
slider from warmer to cooler.  It also offers other more complicated
color balance tools, but even the much older versions of PSP provide RGB
adjustments which can be used for color balance -- here's one way:

Use the eye-dropper on something in the photo which should be white or
gray, and note its RGB values.  Then adjust those values to be
approximately equal.  For example, to correct for incandescent light you
would want to reduce R and increase B until it looks right.

Intelligent use of PSP white balance on a JPEG can yield corrections as
good IMHO as those performed in "developing" a RAW image.

Even if you didn't set the correct color balance on your camera, you can
still tweak the balance in PSP later, if need be.

He's right: 99% of photographers don't need the features included in
Photo Shop CS2 that are crippled or omitted from PS Element, but ...

99% of photographers don't need top-of-the-line dSLRs, either, but
once they've had a taste of the advantages of lens selection,
ergonomics, and general pleasing-ness of the /genre/, the differences
are enough to discourage "going back".

Seems to me CS2 /versus/ Elements is the same: there's something about
/knowing/ which you have, even if you don't /need/ it, that makes for
much more satisfying (not to mention easier) work.

A long time ago I enrolled in a Community College Photo Shop course.
At my local Career Center the cost was nil to register, and with the
ID card I had access to Educational pricing on every consumer software
imaginable, almost. I think PS 4 or 5 was $160 at
http://www.gradware.com/default.asp , just up the street at the time;
it's gone up by $120 ! Now $280-something. Subsequent upgrades were at
regular upgrade price, no problems.

If you are serious, you might avoid the inner conflict and wasting
money on interim products, by going for the good one now. A little
education couldn't hurt, either (nothing personal).

If you want *that* level of ease of use (and correspondingly limited
capabilities), looking into Colour-science.com's Image Editor, which you
can get for about $50, and which is really great for overall density and
color adjustments in a high-volume production environment.  For a lot of
pictures the automatic adjustments are enough.

(Your "NO HISTOGRAMS NECESSARY!" convinces me we need very different
things from out editing programs; the histogram, and the corresonding

Photoshop, and what I use for 99% of my work (not counting mask making)).

Photoshop Elements has Histograms and Masks but they have tools to speed
up their use if you so choose.  I find that the major use I have for
histograms in speeded up with the lighting sliders for shadow areas and

when the sliders aren't optimal.  Masks work fairly similar to those in

PSP has all those features, but I rarely use them (aside from layers,
sometimes).  Because of my art school training half a century ago I still
prefer to "paint" directly on the image by treating select areas
individually with direct manipulation.  Its the gutsy way to go!  You
either make it, or mar it.  Art without risk is for timid technicians.

As for Frank's pro-PS comment:  "there's something about
/knowing/ which you have, even if you don't /need/ it, that makes for
much more satisfying (not to mention easier) work."

I've tried PS several times in the past, and just couldn't like it.
Perhaps I'm allergic to Adobe... I even prefer the Foxit PDF reader.

Perhaps this just a life-style issue.  I drive a Toyota Yaris hatchback
and own two Pentax DSLRs.  I owned Leicas, Rolleis and Nikons a lifetime
ago but now feel craft is more important than tools.

I agree completely.  Though I use PSP rather than PS, histogram curves are
the first thing I tweak overall after loading a new image, before starting
to manipulate separate areas.  Well, at times curves take second place
after ensuring the image is level; few things are more eye-offending than a
good image half a degree crooked.

&gt;&gt; I believe I use features routinely in Photoshop that aren't in PSP,
&gt;&gt; and which I'm sure aren't in elements.  Most particularly, adjustment
&gt;&gt; layers (mostly curves adjustment layers, often with layer masks).

&gt; Elements has adjustment layers, with layer masks, including &quot;levels&quot;
&gt; adjustment layers where &quot;levels&quot; is a simplified version of &quot;curves&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Since it's essentially a hobby for me, I don't &quot;need&quot; any of it,
&gt;&gt; but....
">

A problem with Elements 4 and 5 is that it will not run on any OS
earlier than XP.  I run win 2000, and do not want to 'upgrade' even to
XP, let alone Vista.  (I have a paranoid aversion to software that needs
'activation').  Paradoxically, CS2 runs on win 2000, so I have no idea
why Adobe should make Elements unable to run on 2000.

Also, several people advocate PSP as being equivalent to Photoshop, but
in my limited experience of PSP, some functions are more difficult to
use, displaying a sort of thumbnail size image when adjusting contrast
etc; and I have some reservation about whether its functions are as
optimal as Photoshop's.  Perhaps I'm wrong about that, but it haunts me
whenever I try to use PSP.

What you are referring to is Photoshop Elements, which is not the same thing
as Photoshop [which sells for $600+].

You're right, it's changed, although it's still fairly restrictive
compared to other software companies. My organization type is neither
listed as qualifying nor listed as not qualifying. They also have a

already get.

I will try TechSoup when CS3 shows up. I get all my Microsft software

Your PSP experience may be TOO limited.  Brightness/contrast is adjusted
with live preview of the new setting not on a thumbnail, but any
magnification you desire.

How does free sound? Just install a bitorrent client and try the

Two scanners I got in the late 90s came with Photoshop LE which was a
full featured Photoshop 4.  I registered it and was able to upgrade it
to the most recent photoshops.  A couple years later they figured out
this upgrade path and shut it down for people who hadn't used it yet.

You know, I seem to remember got an email from Adobe ( I think) last month,
something about Photoshop for 300 or thereabouts..
