I am one of the guilty parties that posted. However, there is no
mechanism to retract and once posted in error there is nothing that can be
done.

Sometimes I see blank postings which say, in essence, sorry - this message
is no longer available. Any method to retract would make it a lot easier
on everyone.

Would also be a little gentler if you could automatically send rules of
road to 1st time postings and to be a little flexible with newcomers - I
noticed a 14 year old trying to get info that was reprimanded but helped.

&gt; Isn't this enough already?! When will we realize and accept that this is
&gt; *never* going to change? Without moderation FS/WTB ads will be...no, make

&gt; Charleen, I wish now more than ever that your proposal for the moderation of
&gt; rec.antiques had gone through.

"/> Well Dan, I salute your tenacity. Unlike you, who continues to hang in there
and work to keep this newsgroup from going down the tubes, I have just about
given up. I stopped posting resonses here because a) so very few folks
responded and even fewer said thank you; b) some responses were unbelievably
rude and downright filthy; and c) the last straw was when I posted a response
to a question about Homer Laughlin and was solicited by someone's 'aunty' (you
know who you are) to buy Fiesta, as if I would ever buy anything from someone
so rude. I now lurk occasionally and respond only by private email, as you
know.

I know that I am not the only one who has thrown up my hands in frustration
watching this newsgroup degenerate into the mess it is now, and it is not just
the WTB and FS ads. It is also the scarcity of the discussion that used to
proliferate here. We suffered a terrible loss when people like Charleen and
Nancy and others like them signed off because of a few incredibly rude people
who never contributed anything to the discussion, and who also seem to have
signed off now that the controversy is over. There have also been newcomers
who have contributed for a while, but then were never heard from again. I can
only assume that they also felt the frustration that I feel. Would this
problem be solved by creating a moderated group? I don't know, but if you can
still hold out hope, I guess it's worth a try. So, I would be in favor of the
moderated group and I will even volunteer to help out in any way I can, and I
just hope it works. Thanks, Dan!

"/> If it would mean an end to the incessant CFV thread about splitting
the toys group, let's do it today!!! :)

Seriously, a couple years ago when the discussion about splitting
r.a. into r.a. and r.a.m. went on, my view was that it would
only force those of us who occasionally buy and sell (GASP! How
capitalistic!) to read two separate groups. Then my workload
doubled and I missed out on the rest of the discussion and next
thing I knew, r.a. had been split and, as I suspected, crossposting
and posts complaining about crossposting were frequent.

I guess what I'm leading to is this: I'd be in favor of
r.a. being moderated if (a) the moderator(s) could moderate
without bias; (b) the moderator(s) could be thick-skinned
enough not to get upset with uninformed mis-posters and
run them off with a flame-and-blame reaction.

If the moderator's job were ONLY to weed out the get-rich-
quick schemes and similar spam and to gently direct misguided
souls to the correct newsgroup, then I'd say yes. Anything
beyond that, I'd say no. I prefer to decide for myself what
I'll read, and I'm of the school that doesn't split hairs
about what constitutes antique-ness. Depression era
dinnerware, for example, doesn't fulfill the letter of the
law, but it sorta gets lost on rec.collecting amid all
the Star Trek action figures and Precious Moments figurines.

What does everyone else think?

PS. Unless I've developed amnesia, I can't recall such a high-
volume discussion over a CFV as we've recently witnessed.
Do the Usenet rules require that *every* contribution to
such a thread be posted, or could some of this bickering
be done via e-mail? My position has always been that
well-written headers could keep everyone happy, but sheesh,
yesterday I did a quick count and the CFV discussion posts
comprised 18/22 posts! It was hard to *find* the real
r.a. headers hidden between all those other thingies.

As a &quot;regular&quot; of rec.antiques for quite some time, I would vote for the
moderation of the group if it would put an END to posts like this one. I,
for one, am sick of hearing about the *gross misconduct* of new readers who
post FS and WTB ads, and am equally tired of the responsive flames. I have
also received the referred to &quot;polite&quot; messages informing me of the error
of my ways....once early on in the split when my newsreader elected to post
to rec.antiques instead of rec.antiques.markeplace because of misplaced
comma (others have also complained about this) and then again when I posted
a question to dealers on the group that had NOTHING TO DO with anything I
was selling or wished to buy in the way of antiques. I do not find them
gentle OR polite.

Many have echoed the sentiment &quot;get a life&quot; and I will do so again for all
those that feel it needs to be restated. Extinguish the life of
the rec.antiques militia. MODERATE rec.antiques not, in my mind, to
preserve the integrity of the discussion (has anyone thought of simply
skipping BY the WTB and FS ads???) but so that this dialogue will finally
come to a close and we can actually DISCUSS antiques. That is the point,
is it not?

Disgusted,

Cynthia

"/> Welcome, Norman,
I always assume a single for-sale post means somebody is new and
just needs to know (I know everybody's supposed to read the faqs
and lurk before posting, but I have been caught pushing &quot;in&quot; on &quot;out&quot;
doors, so forgive undeliberate trespasses.) What tees me off is the
ones who crosspost dozens to the right place and the wrong place
together, because that implies they know better.
If the object is antique, (over 50) post to rec.antiques.marketplace.
If it's newer, post to rec.collecting.
There are other groups that may bear more fruit depending on the object.
(several toy groups, etc.). Read and lurk and you'll find the right
place for what you are selling.

Tish Lehman (p ... @umich.edu)

p.s. I don't think it's technically possible for a message to come
up first on every server. Messages show up every which way, and not
always in order of posting, either. SOmetimes I see a reply three
days before the posting that's being replied to. Often I never see
a post other people are discussing.

Dan &amp; Sheryl &amp; others:

I'm new to this group, and just want to tell you how
excited I have been to have had the opportunity to
&quot;talk&quot; to people who know so much more than I do.
I understand your frustration with the FS/WTB problem,
and hope a solution can be found. I guess I figured out
the &quot;no advertising&quot; rule by reading a couple of polite
postings, gently informing those who probably unknowingly
had violated it. But I wanted to stress how wonderful this
group is, from the perspective of a newcomer, and
encourage those of you who have been in since the
beginning not to give up hope.

I haven't been a long time reader but have been finding myself here
daily lately and so feel I can fairly offer my humble opinion as well
as ask a question/offer a proposition.
Moderating seems like a simple enough solution so long as the
moderator only removes FS/WTB or *completely* inappropriate postings.
No problem there so long as we have another location to post FS/WTB
if we would like to. However let's not get into an unsolvable debate
over whether or not deco is antique or collectible.
Question/proposition: I'm not sure how the logistics of this all
works but is it possible to temporarily have both an unmoderated and
moderated group and let democracy decide? The level of activity
should soon tell you which one is most preferred by readers at large.
I believe I would visit the moderated group so long as it isn't
moderated fanatically. Thanks. Merry Christmas in advance ;-).
Archie
