In his propaganda conference, President Bush repeated his age old lies while him and his

profiting as Iraqis keep dying in the future from the depleleted uranium contaminated

Iraqi death toll

Thursday July 12, 2007

Guardian Unlimited

The White House has claimed the civilian death toll is falling in Iraq. There are no
definitive figures to back this up, and assessments of the number of Iraqis killed since
the 2003 invasion are highly disputed.

Below are estimates from two monitoring sources.

The fact of the matter is:

* Mesopotamia has long been a playground for great powers. The

British

invaded the area in 1917, causing a widespread revolt of the Iraqi

people. Britain later ruled under a League of Nations mandate that

produced the artificial creation of the country Iraq (and Kuwait),

and

continued to control oil production in the region. Foreign Minister

Arthur Balfour said at the time, &quot;I do not care under what system we

keep this oil, but I am quite clear it is all-important for us that

this oil should be available&quot;.

* Saddam Hussein started his career as a political thug, on the

payroll of the CIA during the 1950s and 1960s, torturing and

murdering

Iraqi leftists whose names were provided by American intelligence,

and

participating in an armed coup against the Iraqi government.

* In 1972, the United States conspired with Iran and Israel to

support

a revolt of the Kurdish people within Iraq against their government.

* In 1980, the United States provided encouragement, weapons,

intelligence, satellite data and funding for Saddam's Iraq to invade

Iran, launching an eight year war - the longest and probably the

bloodiest of the post-WWII era.

* During this war, Ronald Reagan dispatched Donald Rumsfeld to Iraq

to

improve relations with Saddam. The United States then restored full

diplomatic relations with Iraq, despite the administration's clear

awareness that Saddam was using chemical weapons at the time.

* The Reagan administration also knew that Saddam had used chemical

weapons against Iraqi Kurds rising up again against Baghdad (this was

the incident George W. Bush would later repeatedly invoke, saying of

Saddam, &quot;He gassed his own people&quot;), but nevertheless authorized

expanded sales to Iraq of highly sophisticated equipment that could

be

used to manufacture weapons, only two months after the Halabja

incident.

* George H. W. Bush equated Saddam to Hitler. But, in the wake of the

1990-91 Gulf War, after the elder Bush had encouraged Kurds and

Shiites to rise up against the regime, he abandoned them, leaving

them

to be slaughtered by Saddam's military, in many cases right before

the

eyes of US forces who were ordered not to intervene.

* The senior Bush had a chance after that war to occupy Iraq and

topple Saddam. He chose not to because, in his own words and those of

his National Security Advisor, Brent Scowcroft, &quot;Trying to eliminate

Saddam, extending the ground war into an occupation of Iraq ... would

have incurred incalculable human and political costs. ... We would

have

been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule

Iraq. ...furthermore,

we had been self-consciously trying to set a pattern for handling

aggression in the post-cold war world. Going in and occupying Iraq,

thus unilaterally exceeding the U.N.'s mandate, would have destroyed

the precedent of international response to aggression we hoped to

establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the U.S. could conceivably

still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land. It would have

been a dramatically different - and perhaps barren - outcome.&quot;

* The younger Bush, George W., never asked his father for advice on

Iraq. Instead, he said: &quot;You know he is the wrong father to appeal to

in terms of strength. There is a higher father that I appeal to.&quot;

Bush

has also stated, &quot;I'm driven with a mission from God. ...God would

tell

me, 'George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq...' And I did.&quot;

* George W. Bush gave twenty interviews in 1999 to Mickey Herskowitz,

a friend of the Bush family contracted at the time to ghostwrite his

autobiography. Bush was thinking about invading Iraq at that time,

saying &quot;'One of the keys to being seen as a great leader is to be

seen

as a commander-in-chief. My father had all this political capital

built up when he drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait and he wasted it. If

I

have a chance to invade, if I had that much capital, I'm not going to

waste it. I'm going to get everything passed that I want to get

passed

and I'm going to have a successful presidency.&quot; Herskowitz said that

Bush's beliefs on Iraq were shaped by Dick Cheney's ideas, based on

the power and glory Margaret Thatcher earned from her Falklands War:

&quot;Start a small war. Pick a country where there is justification you

can jump on, go ahead and invade.&quot; Herskowitz also reports this

interesting note from his interviews with Bush: &quot;He told me that as a

leader, you can never admit to a mistake. That was one of the keys to

being a leader.&quot;

* During the presidential campaign of 2000, candidate Bush said very

little about Iraq, and certainly never suggested the need for urgent

action. Somehow, though, in just two years time - during which, if

anything, Iraq actually got weaker, not stronger - Saddam and his

country became a perilous and imminent threat that had to be

addressed

immediately.

* Former members of his own cabinet have revealed that Bush planned

to

invade Iraq from the very beginning of his administration, well

before

9/11. All discussions were about the how of doing it, never about the

why, the justification, the costs or the wisdom.

* Bush claims he is fighting a war on terror in response to 9/11. But

in the first eight months of his administration, his own top

terrorism

advisor, Richard Clarke, could not get a meeting of cabinet-level

security officials to discuss terrorism. They finally met, one week

before 9/11, and then the meeting was 'hijacked' into discussing Iraq

instead. In 2004, Clarke said &quot;Frankly, I find it outrageous that the

president is running for re-election on the grounds that he's done

such great things about terrorism. He ignored it. He ignored

terrorism

for months, when maybe we could have done something to stop 9/11.&quot;

Clarke is a Republican who voted for Bush in 2000, and also served in

the administrations of Bush's father, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.

* Right after 9/11, according to Clarke, &quot;The president dragged me

into a room with a couple of other people, shut the door, and said,

'I

want you to find whether Iraq did this.' Now he never said, 'Make it

up.' But the entire conversation left me in absolutely no doubt that

George Bush wanted me to come back with a report that said Iraq did

this. I said, 'Mr. President. We've done this before. We have been

looking at this. We looked at it with an open mind. There's no

connection.' He came back at me and said, 'Iraq! Saddam! Find out if

there's a connection'. And in a very intimidating way. I mean that we

should come back with that answer. We wrote a report. It was a

serious

look. We got together all the FBI experts, all the CIA experts. We

wrote the report. We sent the report out to CIA and found FBI and

said, 'Will you sign this report?' They all cleared the report. And

we

sent it up to the president and it got bounced by the National

Security Advisor or Deputy. It got bounced and sent back saying,

'Wrong answer. ... Do it again'.&quot;

* Iraq was not in league with Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, whom the

administration blamed for the 9/11 attacks. As Richard Clarke put it,

&quot;There's absolutely no evidence that Iraq was supporting al Qaeda,

ever&quot;. Indeed, the opposite is true. Al Qaeda is a Muslim

fundamentalist organization dedicated to the violent overthrow of the

secular regimes ruling Islamic countries, precisely what Saddam

Hussein's Iraq was. Indeed, even the highly religious Saudi Arabia

(from which 15 of the 19 alleged hijackers came, none of them being

Iraqis) is under violent pressure from al Qaeda for not being

theocratic enough.

* Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. Even George Bush has now admitted

this. However, over the last six years, and still to this day, Bush

constantly conflates the two in almost every speech he gives, to the

point where in 2003 sixty-nine percent of Americans came to believe

that Saddam had been behind the 9/11 attacks. There can be little

doubt that the administration used 9/11 to justify the invasion of

Iraq, though they had nothing whatsoever to do with each other.

* According to the internal top secret documents later leaked as the

Downing Street Memos, we know that the administration itself realized

that &quot;the case was thin&quot; for war against Iraq, because &quot;Saddam was

not

threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capability was less than that

of Libya, North Korea or Iran.&quot;

* Nevertheless, the administration made an internal decision that the

war would be marketed around the supposed WMD threat, despite knowing

it was false. The allusions to mushroom clouds, centrifuge tubes and

all the rest were gross exaggerations and outright lies, and were

known to be at the time by the people making them. As the Downing

Street Memos reveal, a decision for war had already been made, and

the

public case for it was fabricated afterwards: &quot;The intelligence and

facts were being fixed around the policy&quot;.

* The president claimed in a state of the union speech that Saddam

had

gone to Africa to get uranium, seriously alarming the American

public.

Before the speech, the CIA had told the White House to remove that

comment because it was transparently false, based as it was on a

crude

forged letter. Ultimately, the 'mistake' of including this lie was

blamed on Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, who was

later punished for this grave 'error' by being promoted to National

Security Advisor. His former boss, Condoleeza Rice, was punished by

being promoted to Secretary of State.

* When Joseph Wilson came home from a trip to Niger and told the

truth

about the forged letter, the administration revealed the identity of

his wife, undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame, thus potentially

jeopardizing the lives of all her contacts overseas. Eight witnesses

recalled nine conversations with Vice President Cheney's Chief of

Staff, Scooter Libby, in which Libby blew Plame's cover - an act of

treason - in order to punish a political 'enemy' for telling the

truth. Libby claimed not to remember these nine conversations. Both

the jury and the judge in the case thought Libby was unquestionably

lying and convicted him of obstructing justice, with jurors

commenting

that they felt sorry for him because he was obviously taking a fall

for Cheney.

* The case regarding Saddam's chemical weapons capability was

similarly trumped up. It was based on the rantings of a single

source,

code-named &quot;Curveball&quot;, whose handlers in the German intelligence

service had repeatedly warned the administration that he was a drunk

and a liar.

* The administration continually relied upon Iraqi exiles, many of

whom had not set foot in the country for decades, as sources for

information about Iraq and as mouthpieces to justify the invasion.

But

it is unclear who was using whom. Ahmad Chalabi, the most prominent

of

these, intended to use the US military as a vehicle to become leader

of Iraq. Despite being wanted for massive bank fraud in Jordan,

Chalabi convinced neoconservatives that he was the &quot;George Washington

of Iraq&quot;. His Iraqi National Congress was the primary source for Bush

administration claims that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and

ties to al Qaeda, neither of which was true. Chalabi gloated about

how

his influence led the Bush administration to war, and the Pentagon

immediately flew him into Iraq following the invasion. The army of

followers that he had promised would rally around him never

materialized, and his party won zero parliamentary seats in the

December 2005 elections. Ultimately, the United States accused him of

providing intelligence secrets to the Iranian government and raided

his offices.

* Colin Powell's presentation to the UN Security Council sealed the

deal for most Americans regarding the case for war. It later became

apparent that almost everything Powell said that day was false, and

he

has described this episode as the low point in his career.

* The Downing Street Memos reveal that the purpose of authorizing UN

weapons inspectors to go to Iraq was never actually to assess the

threat and destroy any weapons found. Instead, the purpose was to

&quot;wrongfoot&quot; Saddam by getting him to reject the inspectors, thus

giving the American and British governments a pretext for war. Tony

Blair said &quot;It would make a big difference politically and legally if

Saddam refused to allow in the UN inspectors. If the political

context

were right, people would support regime change.&quot;

* To this day Bush claims that Saddam kicked out the inspectors. That

had been true five years previously, but not before the war. Hans

Blix, the head of the 2002-03 weapons inspection team reported that

they were getting good cooperation from the Iraqis, despite the fact

that - as revealed by one of the former team members - the US had

inserted American spies into prior international weapons inspection

teams in Iraq.

* At the time of the invasion in 2003, the weapons inspectors were

nearly done with their work, and only asked for a month or two more

to

finish. The Bush administration claimed that the threat of Saddam and

his WMD was too grave and too urgent to wait. Bush's claim that

Saddam

kicked out the inspectors is not only false, but masks the actual

truth, which is that the administration told the inspectors to leave

because of the looming attack, before they could finish their work

and

by so doing remove the rationale for that attack.

* As war loomed, Iraq made broad overtures to the United States to

prevent an invasion, offering to allow full, on-the-ground, American

weapons inspections, anti-terrorism cooperation, oil concessions, and

even backing for the US position in an Israeli/Palestinian peace

plan.

The only thing Saddam balked at was regime change, but even then he

offered to hold elections within two years' time. The Americans were

also informed by the Iraqis at the time that there were no existing

WMD. The Iraqi representatives &quot;could not understand why the

Americans

were focused on Iraq rather than on countries, like Iran, that have

long supported terrorists&quot;. The Bush administration

One of Al Maliki's / Bush mutual achievements in Iraq that both are proud of.

US 'used forced labour to build Iraq embassy'

By Damien McElroy in Baghdad

Last Updated: 12:56am BST 10/06/2007

America is investigating whether forced labour was used to build its vast new embassy in
Baghdad's Green Zone.

US Embassy in Baghdad

The 21 high-rise towers on the bank of the Tigris will house 3,000 staff

(This is happening while 1 million Iraqis left Baghdad. May the almighty convert these
buildings to mass graves to the American occupants and their cheap followers of Iraqi
Shroog like AL Maliki / AL Hakeem / AL Ja'afari / Barazani the gangster S1000+)

Disaffected employees have alleged that workers from Asia and West Africa were deceived
in Kuwait into flying to Baghdad by being given boarding passes that said Dubai for
chartered flights to Iraq.

Once on the ground, an unspecified number of labourers had their passports seized,
effectively trapping the workers in Iraq for the duration of their contracts.

Although the labourers are relatively well paid, receiving $1,000 (£550) a month, they
endured harsh conditions on the site.

Federal prosecutors working for the US Department of Justice have taken up the
allegations, which were rejected in a State Department inquiry but partially supported
by Defence Department auditors.

John Owens, an American who worked on the project, said he was handed a boarding card
for Dubai along with dozens of workers from Third World countries who were unaware they
would be traveling to Iraq.

&quot;I felt bad for those folks every day that I was in Iraq, and the feelings just built
and built,&quot; Mr Owens told the Wall Street Journal. &quot;They were basically being treated
like slaves.&quot;

Howard Krongard, the State Department Inspector General, who visited the site in
September, said he could find no evidence to support Mr Owens's allegations.

Juvencio Lopez, a former foreman on the project, said workers were forced to the brink
of rioting during protests over unsanitary working conditions at the site.

Security guards with unholstered guns menaced workers engaged in sit-downs. There were
reports of labourers sleeping 20 to a room and being forced to drink water from the
polluted Tigris when supplies ran scarce.

It is one of the most dangerous building projects in the world.

The forest of 21 high-rise towers on the west bank of the Tigris in central Baghdad will
house 3,000 staff working in America's largest mission.

The inquiry threatens to take the shine off one of the few US projects in Iraq that is
being completed on time and within budget.

Until September, the American ambassador, his staff and a large contingent of US troops
are squeezed into Saddam Hussein's marble-clad Republican Palace. ( To Hell S1000+)

The presence of troops means the embassy bars are shuttered to ensure that guns and
alcohol do not mix. ( Is it ? S1000+)

&lt; http://www.bestcyrano.org/THOMASPAINE/?p=218 &gt; Iraq, the Unavoidable Global Trauma

Bush mastered the art of killing Iraqis

On August 10th 2007 the non-profit group Just Foreign Policy, claimed the number of
Iraqis killed as a result of the US invasion stands at a shocking and sobering
1,000,985.

On July 30th 2007 a report released by Oxfam and the NGO Coordination Committee in Iraq
said that around 8 million Iraqis are in urgent need of water, sanitation, food and
shelter, and said that more than 2 million people - mostly women and children - have
been displaced within Iraq and have no reliable income, while another 2 million Iraqis
have fled the country as refugees, mostly to neighbouring Syria and Jordan.

&quot;If that is our choice, just like humanity paid once the price for the 'will' of the
Almighty Creator through the actions of Hitler, we are once again bound to pay the price
for the 'will' of God through the actions of Bush.&quot;

Many decades ago in Mein Kampf Adolf Hitler stated the following; &quot;I believe today that
my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator.&quot;

By now we have all had a chance to evaluate the consequences of that &quot;will&quot;.

In 2003 an article by the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz, quoted a Palestinian leader
claiming Bush said to him; &quot;God told me to strike at Al-Qaeda. And I struck them. And
then he instructed me to strike at Saddam, which I did. And now I am determined to solve
the problem in the Middle East.&quot; (We heard aired lies like these from Bush frequently.
As if he has a hot line with God S1000+)

Studies conducted over the last few decades in regards to the impact of National
Socialism on ordinary life in Germany during and after that period have cataloged a
serious of civilian attitudes such as keeping silent, looking over one's shoulder and
feeling frightened, and have moved on to evaluate the aftermath of such attitudes and
the results of accepting such extreme violence perpetrated on others. A lot of these
studies have shown collective signs of guilt, depression and even collective
post-traumatic stress disorder.

Added to these personal repercussions as passive supporters of the atrocities, if we
look further into the outcomes of the Second World War, we can see how German people
were often viewed with contempt because they were blamed for Nazi crimes. Germans
visiting abroad, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, received insults from locals, and
from foreigners who may have had their families or friends live through or perish in the
atrocities. Even today, in Europe and worldwide Germans are sometimes stigmatized by
elderly people who experienced the atrocities committed by Nazi Germans during World War
II.

So while as westerners we count the number of &quot;our&quot; soldiers wounded or dead as a
measurement of success or failure in this immoral war, we tend to ignore the fact that
all those Iraqis dead, injured or displaced are having a long-term impact on our
everyday life. If we wait for our governments to decide when the killing has gone on
long enough, I cannot help but wonder whether in the not so distant future, we as
westerners will be facing a moral trial and the subjugate trauma attached to it. Just
like the one faced by 'innocent' civilian Germans who once upon a time, opted to allow
Hitler to flourish.

On August 10th 2007 the non-profit group Just Foreign Policy, claimed the number of
Iraqis killed as a result of the US invasion stands at a shocking and sobering
1,000,985.

On July 30th 2007 a report released by Oxfam and the NGO Coordination Committee in Iraq
said that around 8 million Iraqis are in urgent need of water, sanitation, food and
shelter, and said that more than 2 million people - mostly women and children - have
been displaced within Iraq and have no reliable income, while another 2 million Iraqis
have fled the country as refugees, mostly to neighbouring Syria and Jordan.

Although this traumatic event is confined to a particular country and region, its
effects and implications are of such magnitude that they rank among those cultural
phenomena that Max Weber, the German political economist and sociologist, once referred
to as being of &quot;universal significance and validity.&quot;

If we are not courageous enough to stand up for other human beings and the carnage
infringed upon them by western imperialist foreign policy, maybe we can research our
recent history and reflect on the consequences of such actions on &quot;us&quot; and &quot;our&quot;
children.

Maybe then although from a purely selfish perspective, this collective acceptance of
genocide will be reversed and once again we can resume the path of peaceful democratic
existence. If that is not the case, I guess we are bound to the description the French
philosopher Voltaire gave of our collective apathy, when he said, &quot;no snowflake in an
avalanche ever feels responsible. &quot;

If that is our choice, just like humanity paid once the price for the &quot;will&quot; of the
Almighty Creator through the actions of Hitler, we are once again bound to pay the price
for the &quot;will&quot; of God through the actions of Bush.

Iraqi Death Toll: Why the UN Can't Count

By Jon &lt; http://www.alternet.org/authors/7559/ &gt;  Wiener, TheNation.com
&lt; http://www.thenation.com &gt; . Posted January
&lt; http://www.alternet.org/ts/archives/?date%5bF%5d=01&amp;date;%5bY%5d=2007&amp;...
=Go/&gt;  17, 2007.

The UN has drastically underreported the number of Iraqis killed in 2006.

The new UN estimate of 34,000 Iraqis killed in 2006 made headlines around the world, but
it's almost certainly far too low. The number, as the New York Times reported, was &quot;the
first attempt at hand-counting individual deaths for an entire year,&quot; and was based on
information from &quot;morgues, hospitals and municipal authorities across Iraq.&quot;

The first problem with the UN count is that refers only to civilians -- and thus almost
certainly omitted deaths of Iraqi policemen, soldiers, insurgent fighters, and members
of private militias like the Badr brigade. News media failed to report how the UN
separated &quot;civilian&quot; casualties from the total, and the UN notably failed to report the
total including non-civilians.

The second problem is the UN's methodology, which relied mostly on tallying official
death certificates. The UN, according to the Times, argues their methodology is reliable
because &quot;a vast majority of Iraqi deaths are registered&quot; with officials because Iraqis
want to &quot;prove inheritance and receive government compensation.&quot; But many bodies found
in mass graves or ditches are unidentified. And there's another problem: according to
the L.A. Times, &quot;Victims' families are all too often reluctant to claim the bodies ...
for fear of reprisals.&quot; And of course chaotic wartime conditions in several provinces
make it difficult for officials there to issue death certificates even when victim's
families do not fear reprisals.

None of the reports in leading newspapers mentioned the other count of Iraqi deaths: the
Johns Hopkins study reported last October in the prestigious British medical journal The
Lancet. They estimated that 650,000 Iraqis had died as a result of the war -- 600,000
from violence and 50,000 from other war-related causes. President Bush rejected that
figure -- &quot;I don't consider it a credible report,&quot; he told a press conference last
October -- and most of the media seem to have agreed.

But The Lancet study used state-of-the art demographic techniques, the same methodology
employed to estimate war deaths in Kosovo, Congo, and Rwanda, and in natural disasters
around the world. World leaders have cited those figures repeatedly without questioning
their validity. It's the same methodology used in political polls in the US: the random
sample.

Instead of trying to find documentation for individual deaths, The Lancet demographers,
led by Gilbert Burnham of Johns Hopkins University, interviewed 12,000 people in 1,800
randomly selected households across Iraq. At each household, they asked how many people
were living there currently, and whether anyone who had lived there had died since Jan.
1, 2002, and if so, whether they died before or after March 2003, when the war began.
That made it possible to compare wartime death rates with pre-war rates.

Critics like Fred Kaplan at Slate.com objected. They said 12,000 was far too small a
sample for a country of 30 million. But in the US, as country of 300 million, 1,000
people are interviewed in the typical political poll, and nobody objects to that sample
size.

Critics also questioned whether The Lancet demographers really were able to interview
all the people selected by their randomizing methodology. The demographers respond that
they employed Iraqi physicians rather than Americans to do the interviewing, and that
the response rate was extremely high, much higher than with political polling in the US.

There's one caveat about The Lancet study -- their estimate of 650,000 wartime deaths
covers the period that ended in July 2006. By all accounts the violence has increased
significantly since July -- so The Lancet figure now itself is undoubtedly too low.

US occupation turns 3.7 million Iraqis into refugees

By James Cogan
23 January 2007

The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported this month that the US invasion and
occupation of Iraq has forced one out of every eight Iraqis to flee their homes—more
than 3.7 million people. The agency described the refugee crisis caused by the Iraq war
as the worst in the Middle East since the ethnic cleansing that accompanied the creation
of Israel in 1948. The Zionist military and paramilitary death squads drove an estimated
711,000 Palestinian Arabs from their land.

UNHCR estimates that two million Iraqis are now living outside the country—including
those who left before 2003 but have failed to return due to the country’s catastrophic
situation. Some 50,000 Iraqi émigrés returned in 2005, but just 1,000 came back last
year.

Another 1.7 million Iraqis have been internally displaced. At least 500,000 people fled
their homes in 2006 as a result of US military repression and the dramatic rise in
sectarian violence between rival Shiite and Sunni militias in the wake of the
destruction of a prominent Shiite mosque in Samarra last February. It is thought that
80,000 to 100,000 people are joining the ranks of internal and external refugees each
month.

The cause of the refugee crisis is the political, economic and social collapse in Iraq
after close to four years of US occupation. The UN Human Rights Office report for the
period November 1, 2006 to December 21, 2006, stated: “The civilian population remains
the main victim of the prevailing security situation, characterised by terrorist acts,
action by armed groups, criminal gangs, religious extremists, militias, as well as
operations by security and military forces. The resulting insecurity, sectarian
prejudice, and terror negatively and comprehensively affect the enjoyment of basic
rights and freedoms by the population at large. In addition, growing unemployment,
poverty, various forms of discrimination and increasingly limited access to basic
services, prevent most citizens from realizing their economic, social and cultural
rights.”

The UN specifically condemned the actions of the US military: “Armed operations by the
Multinational Forces-Iraq [the official title of the US-led occupation forces] continued
to restrict the enjoyment of human rights and to cause severe suffering to the local
population. Continued limitations of freedom of movement and lack of access to basic
services such as health and education are affecting a larger percentage of the
population and depriving it of basic rights for extended periods of time.”

Many Iraqis have felt they had no choice but to leave the country. While there are no
precise numbers, up to 800,000 are taking refuge in Syria; another 700,000 in Jordan;
100,000 in Egypt; 40,000 in Lebanon; 50,000 in Iran and a large number in Turkey.

The Iraqi refugees are being accorded no rights. The Jordanian monarchy labels them as
“temporary visitors”. It has not made any request for international assistance and is
not cooperating with agencies such as UNHCR. Only 21,000 Iraqis in Jordan have been
registered by the UN and just 800 have been recognised as refugees eligible for
international resettlement.

Syria has also rejected calls for Iraqis on its territory to be recognised as refugees
and is treating them as tourists or illegal immigrants. Iran has sealed its borders to
any more Iraqis, while the Gulf States, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, are refusing to
allow them to enter their territory at all. While doing nothing to assist refugees,
Saudi Arabia has allocated $500 million to construct a fence along parts of its
1,000-kilometre border with Iraq, to prevent “terrorists” and “illegal immigrants” from
entering. The fence will have security gates, guard posts and electronic movement
sensors.

The majority of Iraqi émigrés live in considerable hardship and a significant proportion
are sinking into complete poverty. Jordan charges Iraqis for all services, including a
$US225 fee for a one-year work permit. Many families are reportedly sharing small
apartments and paid employment is difficult to obtain. Syria has now begun charging
refugees for health care and also limits their ability to work. More than 10 percent of
Iraqi families in Syria are headed by women due to the death, imprisonment or
disappearance of their men. UNHCR noted this month that there are increasing reports of
female Iraqi refugees being forced into prostitution.

The strain of the inflow on Jordan is leading to an ever-more restrictive attitude
toward the Iraqi refugees, who now make up 10 percent of the population. This would be
equivalent to the US taking in 30 million refugees. Fearful of political unrest among
the desperate émigré community, Jordan has begun blocking entry to males aged between 17
and 35. It is refusing to renew the visas of Iraqis already within its borders and has
stepped up deportations. As a result, Syria has become the primary destination for
Iraqis seeking to escape the carnage at home, with an estimated 40,000 entering the
country each month.

Many of those who have fled are secular Iraqis. It is believed that 40 percent of the
professional middle class has left the country since 2003. Many held positions in Saddam
Hussein’s Baathist regime and have been persecuted by the US occupation. They also face
death or abuse at the hands of both Sunni and Shiite religious fundamentalists. Members
of Iraq’s Assyrian Christian minority have also left the country in large numbers. An
estimated 750,000 Christians have fled since the US invasion.

The US and British governments—which bear the responsibility for the war and the
subsequent humanitarian disaster—have refused to do anything about the crisis. The US
has accepted a total of just 466 Iraqi refugees since 2003. According to the British
Home Office, 160 Iraqis were accepted by Britain as refugees in 2005. The applications
of another 2,685 were rejected. In the third quarter of 2006, the period for which the
most recent statistics are available, the Blair government accepted only 10 Iraqi
refugees, while rejecting the applications of 165.

The other major European powers have been equally restrictive. Draconian regulations
ensured that only 230 Iraqis were allowed to enter Germany last year and just 13 into
France. Sweden, by contrast, granted asylum to 8,951 Iraqis in 2006. The Australian
government—one of the main supporters of the Iraq war—accepted 1,834 refugees from Iraq
in 2005-2006, from more than 20,000 applications.

Within Iraq, hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons (IDP’s) are relying
on their extended families or charitable networks to survive.

There are close to 80,000 IDPs in the majority Sunni Arab province of Anbar, which
borders Syria and Jordan and is a major focus of the anti-occupation insurgency. Many of
the displaced have had their homes destroyed by the US military during its operations to
suppress the anti-US fighters in cities like Ramadi and Fallujah. Others are Sunnis from
Baghdad and other areas seeking to escape sectarian persecution at the hands of the
militias and security forces loyal to the Shiite parties that dominate the pro-US
government. There are some 50,000 displaced in Baghdad itself.

This month, Mohammed Rubaie, a displaced Sunni in Baghdad, told the Los Angeles Times
that in October he was confronted by “two gunmen dressed in black, with the police
backing them up. They were saying, ‘Sunnis you should leave now. It’s the last warning
to you all. We’re going to burn your houses one by one. When our neighbour’s house was
burnt, I felt it was time for us to leave”.

Large numbers of Shiites have fled to the predominantly Shiite-populated southern
provinces of Iraq to escape equally brutal violence by Sunni extremists. Nearly 40,000
arrived in Karbala last year alone. Other southern provinces reported a 10-fold increase
in the number of displaced persons seeking housing and assistance.

The escalation of the war set in motion by the Bush administration this month, which
involves a massive increase in the violence in Baghdad, will inevitably force many more
Iraqis to flee. UNHCR, however, is expecting to have just $US60 million and limited
staff this year to respond to the already enormous existing crisis.

Subject: Understanding what the Neocon-Zionists have done to Iraq and Iraqis while
earning massive wealth for their masters

Iraqis have been robbed, murdered, raped, tortured, and looted for generations to come.
The Zionist lobby in the US in now calling for the same genocide against Iranians, while
the Israeli Zionist Leaders (95% Russian Khazars/German Ashkenazis) are conducting a
similar genocide against the Palestinians and Lebanese with funds embezzled from the US
taxpayers. In addition to hanging a version of  their puppet “Saddam Hussein” who was
installed by the CIA and supported by the Pentagon until 1991, the Neocon/Zionists:

*       staged 911 and then blamed Arabs and demonized muslims
*       profited immensely from 9/11 related events such as short selling of airline
stocks before the attacks, insurance claims after the attacks, military buildup, wars,
etc. (as per Retd. Colonel Bowman and others, Dick Cheney was the mastermind behind the
attacks leading the simulated hijacking exercises from his bunker on September 11,
2001),

The Neocon/Zionist cartel have been conducting illegal wars of aggression and bombing,
invading, occupying and installing a government of criminals, just as criminals as the
Congress critters like Jim Hightower calls them ( http://www.jimhightower.com
&lt; http://www.jimhightower.com/ &gt;  ), in Afghanistan and Iraq. Here are some of their other
crimes. Iraq has been &quot;liberated&quot; Zionist-style from 2003 till the present. Today, the
29th January 2007, Iraqis long for the days of the sanctions:

*       The US occupation forces will soon get their Iraqi puppet government to pass
legislation giving away Iraqi’s oil wealth to their masters the OIL GIANTS.
*       Today in Iraq, people are collectively raped, murdered, tortured, experimented
on with various drugs and drills and US bombs of every type, lazer bombs, phosphorus,
cluster, DU....
*       Today in Iraq, many cities have become massive ghettos. Baghdad, Falluja,
Ramadi, Mosul, Haditha,etc...
*       Today in Iraq, there are mass concentration, rape and torture camps.
*       Today in Iraq there are 3.7 million refugees seeking shelter outside.
*       Today in Iraq, there are 700'000 plus dead since 2003, add to this figure
260'000 children. Today in Iraq, there is no aspirin, no food, no water, no electricity,
no nothing....except for the Neocon/Zionist mercenaries
*       Today in Iraq people, are persecuted for their name tags.
*       Today in Iraq, there are no more universities or schools.
*       Today in Iraq, people have stopped selling their organs and are selling their
kids instead.
*       Today in Iraq there are no hospitals left and cancer patients are considered
lucky.
*       Today in Iraq, the secret letter circulating in the UN prior to the occupation
warning that over 1.4 million children will die, has come true.
*       Today in Iraq there is a holocaust happening before your very eyes.
*       Killing over 650,000 Iraqis and 50,000 Afghans in the process

*       Stealing Iraqi wealth of all types
*       Murdering Iraqi intelligencia, scientists, and professors
*       Polluting the World with Depleted Uranium which has already and will cause
cancer of the lungs and birth defects
*       Lying and misleading the people of the World
*       Murdering journalists to reduce negative reporting
*       Spending millions on lies and propaganda companies and censoring news. Just look
at the real rich news content available on the Internet from alternative news sites
versus the controlled news and unreported news and fabricated news promoted on the
corporate media
*       Embezzling funds and issuing no-bid contracts to
military-industrial-congressional complex companies.
*       Subcontracting the business of killing and torturing to lavishly paid
mercenaries.
*       Institutionalizing torture and kidnapping of relatives, including children.
*       Using weapons of mass destruction such as napalm, phosphorous, daisy cutters,
depleted uranium.
*       Conducting election frauds, disenfranchising certain voters, etc. Although
Zionist imperialism is bipartisan, the Democratic is less infiltrated by the demagogue
war-mongerers
*       Passing Soviet-Stalin type laws to restrict freedoms and imprison without trial,
i.e. end of Habeus Corpus/Magna Carta. Remember that the Patriot Act was written before
9/11
*       Persecuting those who dare to expose their crimes
*       Massively increasing US and Iraqi taxpayers’ debts and deficits
*       Fabricated and lied about intelligence reports
*       Forced downtown Manhattan to reopen after 9/11 even though the air was toxic and
now many people and rescue dogs are dying from the effects
*       Genociding entire cities such as Fallujah, etc.
*       Spending funds marked for reconstruction on expensive Blackwater Mercenaries

*       Millions will die of cancer, get diabetes, will be born with massive birth
defects due to the depleted uranium contamination
*       At least 650,000 Iraqis burnt/crushed/shrapnelled to death by US bombings and
other types of attacks
*       Thousands more injured or crippled
*       Over 3 million Iraqis have left the country
*       Another 3 million are refugees within their own country.
*       Over 18,000 physicians have left Iraq, 250 kidnapped, hundreds killed
*       Hundreds of Iraqis girls have been forced into prostitution as sex slaves, many
more raped
*       Dozens of cities massively destroyed
*       About 1,000 Iraqi scientists and professors killed by Mossad death squads
*       About 4,000 young Iraqi men have been killed by Mossad death squads
*       Nearly 100 reporters killed by US troops and unable to report what really
happened
*       Billions stolen by Zionist/Neocon operatives
*       Iraqi’s oil wealth soon to be given away to Big Oil Giants
*       Iraqi banking brought under the umbrella of the Privately Owned Federal Reserve
System
*       Past Iraqi government employee pensions cancelled
*       Most new jobs are being done by imported laborers
*       Mossad/CIA/British Intelligence have been staging bombings and blaming them on
rival Iraqi groups to fuel a civil war
*       US Occupation forces have legalized and spread the ancient pagan traditions of
pornography and strippers.
*       Etc. etc. etc.

Here is a flashback of the Bremer laws to colonize Iraq and it has gotten worse since
then:

The Bush Administration's proposed changes for Iraqi law go even further, with a special
focus on Iraq's oil. BearingPoint describes how current Iraqi commercial law is
&quot;woefully deficient in terms of establishing a market-friendly legal and regulatory
environment for business formation and operation.&quot; Changes to those laws will therefore
be necessary &quot;to assure an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for major
utilities such as gas, oil, water, and power.&quot; The contract includes every sector of the
Iraqi economy, from public services, media, banking, investment, taxes, agriculture and
the oil sector ‚ implementing &quot;private-sector involvement in strategic sectors,
including privatization, asset sales, concessions, leases and management contracts,
especially those in the oil and supporting industries.&quot; The Bremer Orders have changed
Iraq's laws are being replaced and the BearingPoint contract implemented by L. Paul
Bremer, Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in Iraq. The Bremer
Orders most relevant to this discussion are detailed below.

Bremer Order #39: Foreign Investment

Bremer Order #39, enacted on September 19, 2003, has five key elements: (1)
Privatization of state-owned enterprises; (2) 100% foreign ownership of businesses in
all sectors except oil and mineral extraction, banks and insurance companies (the latter
two are addressed in a separate order); (3) &quot;national treatment&quot; of foreign firms; (4)
unrestricted, tax-free remittance of all funds associated with the investment,
including, but not limited to, profits; and (5) 40 year ownership licenses which have
the option of being renewed.

1. Privatization

The Order allows for privatization of all state-owned entities. It is difficult to
overstate how fundamental a change this is to the Iraqi economy. As the preamble to the
Order explains, it will move Iraq from a &quot;centrally planned economy to a market economy&quot;
in one fell swoop by U.S. fiat. This will involve some 200 state-owned enterprises.
Thus, everything from water services, electric utilities, schools, hospitals, television
and newspapers, to prisons could be privatized under the Order. The water sector is
already being &quot;reconstructed&quot; by the Bechtel Corporation of San Francisco ‚ one of the
top ten water privatization companies in the World. Bechtel is the second largest
recipient of reconstruction dollars in Iraq after Halliburton ‚ totaling nearly $3
billion. Bechtel's contract includes the repair of Iraq's water, sewage and electricity
systems, as well as many of its hospitals and schools.

Cliff Mumm, head of Bechtel's Iraq operation, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Iraq
&quot;has two rivers, it's fertile, it's sitting on an ocean of oil. Iraq ought to be a major
player in the World. And we want to be working for them long term.&quot; Bechtel's track
record does not bode well for the Iraqi people-in fact, the citizens of Bolivia have
written a letter to the people of Iraq warning them of what to expect from Bechtel. A
subsidiary of Bechtel privatized the water systems of Cochabamba, Bolivia and
immediately sent prices sky-rocketing. Families earning a minimum wage of $60 per month
faced water bills of $20 per month. The citizens rose in protest and at least one
seventeen year-old boy lost his life to Bolivian troops sent into the streets to defend
Bechtel's right to privatize with deadly force. Ultimately, the government relented and
cancelled the contract. Bechtel has responded with a $25 million lawsuit against Bolivia
for lost profits. Not surprisingly, when Thomas Foley, former director of Private Sector
Development for the CPA, announced a list of the first state enterprises to be sold off
last fall which included cement and fertilizer plants, phosphate and sulfur mines,
pharmaceutical factories, and the country's airline, there was immediate unrest. With
anywhere from 50% - 70% of the workforce already unemployed, additional layoffs ‚ which
always follow on the heels of privatization ‚ were unacceptable. Furthermore, those
remaining workers who still have jobs only receive &quot;emergency pay&quot; mandated by the CPA ‚
about half of what they made before the war, while prices have skyrocketed and the
social safety net has been virtually eliminated. The CPA promised that the U.S.
corporations doing the reconstruction would solve the unemployment problem, promising
300,000 jobs in an August 13, 2003 letter. Only a handful of these jobs have
materialized. One reason is that many firms are bringing in non-Iraqis to do the bulk of
the work.

Thus, privatization was met with stiff organized resistance. In response, Bremer was
forced to put the immediate privatization plans on hold for the short-term. However, the
long-term plans are clear. BearingPoint, the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) and others both in or contracted by the U.S. government will implement the
majority of the economic policies with the new Iraqi government. Therefore,
implementation can wait until the friction over how that government is created is
resolved. Furthermore, the process of preparing for privatization has not slowed, while
the emphasis on privatization is already rearing its head in Iraq. For example:

·         On April 25, 2004, Iraq's minister of public works told The Independent that
Iraq was considering privatizing its water industry to &quot;fund essential works.&quot; While the
U.S. government is obligated to ensure that water is provided to the people of Iraq, it
is telling that the Minister did not discuss going to the CPA to demand restoration of
water services nor to Bechtel to demand that it fulfill the requirements of its
contract. Rather, she speaks immediately of privatization.

·         Meetings among global corporations to discuss privatization and investment in
Iraq have been taking place unabated at least since the invasion. For example, in
February, the U.S. Commerce Department held a &quot;Doing Business in Iraq&quot; conference
attended by some five hundred U.S. companies including Boeing, Caterpillar,
DaimlerChrysler, Microsoft, IBM, Motorala, Bechtel and Flour. This conference took place
immediately following vocal criticism by the Iraqi Governing Council's top
representative in Washington that the U.S. was passing over Iraqi firms in awarding
reconstruction contracts. The latest of these meetings took place just over a week ago
in London. Called &quot;Iraq Procurement 2004 ‚ Meet the Buyer&quot; ‚ it was sponsored by
ExxonMobil, Oxy, Volvo, Shell, Raytheon and ChevronTexaco ‚ among others. You can visit
web sites like  &lt; http://www.export.gov/Iraq &gt; www.export.gov/Iraq or
&lt; http://www.iraqprocurement.com/ &gt; http://www.iraqprocurement.com/ to learn more and
similar meetings taking place monthly around the World.

·         The CPA's continued interest in luring the private sector to Iraq is evidenced
by the fact that it recently named a new director of Private Sector Development. He is
Ari Fleischer's brother, Michael.

·         Most importantly, it is abundantly clear from BearingPoint's contract that
full implementation is intended to take place after the new Iraqi government is in place
‚ not in the few months remaining before the &quot;hand-over.&quot; The contract is for three
years with the option of renewal. They are not going anywhere. Of course, the contract
specifically states that while there is a commitment to place &quot;Iraq's leaders and
stakeholders in the driver's seat&quot; their input on policies will only be used &quot;as long as
these are consistent with the overall objectives of the project and with USAID policies,
regulations and guidelines.&quot;

·         In regard to whether the Iraqis intend to change these U.S. imposed laws,
Sinan Shabibi ‚ the governor of Iraq's central bank, told an investors services
roundtable in Washington recently that the international financial community need not
fear Bremer's banking laws will be abolished after the hand-over of sovereignty on June
30 because, &quot;It is unreasonable to enact an economic strategy and then abolish it within
two month.&quot; Thus, U.S. pressure is already clearly being felt in Iraq and on its
leaders.

2. 100% foreign ownership

All of Iraq's businesses can be completely owned, run and employed by non-Iraqis. Iraq,
like many countries ‚ particularly developing countries ‚ had a ban on foreign ownership
(many require partnerships with local companies as well) in order to ensure local
retention of revenue, employment and other financial gains. Order #39 states that Iraq
cannot restrict access to foreign owners to any sector of the economy except resource
extraction.

Thus, even Iraq's media could be completely owned by U.S. companies. The first step
towards U.S. ownership may have come with the awarding of a $90 million contract to
Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) of San Diego, CA, to &quot;restore
broadcast media to uncensored operation.&quot; According to the Center for Public Integrity
(CPI), SAIC will be rebuilding Iraq's mass media, including television stations, radio
stations and newspapers, in a program called the Iraqi Media Network. However, not much
more is known because the Pentagon has steadfastly refused to release any specific
information about the contract. What little information that has leaked out has come
mainly from disgruntled employees and press freedom advocates, who have alleged military
censorship, cronyism and significant mishandling of the work. In just one example, SAIC
used the U.S. government-run Voice of America to patch together nightly news shows made
up entirely of dubbed stories from U.S. television network news shows. Concerns over
foreign ownership go farther. Iraq is home to the most extensive river system in the
Middle East, including the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and the Greater and Lesser Zab
rivers. As Stephen C. Pelletiere, a former CIA senior political analyst on Iraq, wrote
in the New York Times, &quot;America could alter the destiny of the Middle East in a way that
probably could not be challenged for decades ‚ not solely by controlling Iraq's oil, but
buy controlling its water. Even if America didn't occupy the country, once Mr. Hussein's
Baath Party is driven from power, many lucrative opportunities would open up for
American companies.&quot; The military invasion of Iraq has put Bechtel in the position to
become one of these companies.

3. National Treatment

Order #39 states that &quot;A foreign investor shall be entitled to make foreign investments
in Iraq on terms no less favorable than those applicable to an Iraqi investor.&quot; National
treatment makes it impossible to require that Iraqis be given preferential treatment
(over foreigners) as investors, owners, contractors or employees. Thus, foreign
companies can do all of the reconstruction, own every business, do all of the work and
not a single Iraqi need to employed or involved in the process whatsoever.

This is a particularly troublesome provision given reports of bloated U.S. corporate
budgets. For example, Time magazine recently reported that an American firm was awarded
a $15 million contract to build a cement factory in Iraq (using U.S. taxpayer dollars).
When the firm was prevented from doing the work, an Iraqi businessman (using Saddam's
confiscated funds) spent just $80,000 to build the same factory. National treatment is
also a powerful tool used by companies to circumvent domestic regulations on the
environment, public health and worker and consumer safety. Virtually every challenge
brought to such laws under the investment chapter of the NAFTA include claims that the
government violated national treatment. For example, national treatment was one of the
tools used successfully by the Virginia-based Ethyl Corporation to force the government
of Canada to reverse its ban on the gasoline additive MMT, a ground water pollutant also
believed to be a human carcinogen. Ethyl sued and Canada settled: reversing its ban,
paying Ethyl $13 million in compensation for its &quot;trouble,&quot; and writing a letter of
apology. Given corporate success in challenging such laws in Canada, the United States,
and Mexico, it is likely that Iraq's environmental, health, and public interest laws‚or
those that any new government may wish to enact‚will be severely at risk. The impact of
this one provision alone is devastating and has facilitated the Bush Administration's
failure to meet its obligations under international law to provide for the basic
necessities of Iraq.

Failure to Meet International Obligations to Provide for Iraqi Basic Services

Water

The Washington Post tells the story of Al-Ani, a PhD civil engineer with 40 years
experience who is one the top experts in water treatment in Iraq. He is an employee of
the General Co. for Water Projects, one of the 200-odd ventures in Iraq that are owned
wholly or in part by the state and have been told they are ineligible for contracts
being issued by the occupation. The company's 187 workers still collect their government
salaries but they now spend their days playing video games, reading books and
chitchatting to pass the time. This story is repeated over and over again across Iraq.
Qualified, experienced and interested Iraqi engineers and workers sitting idle while
U.S. corporations blunder about Iraq at the expense of Iraqi health and U.S. tax-payer
money. Bechtel has the contract that could have gone to General Co. Rather than hire or
talk to Al-Ani or his numerous colleagues, Bechtel employees spent their first months in
Iraq touring the country doing an assessment of the water and electrical systems only to
discover that the systems were in much worse condition and more complicated than they
had originally assumed. This explains why Bechtel is not living up to the conditions of
their contract for water and electricity provision and why the U.S. government doesn't
care. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, USAID, which oversees Bechtel's
contract, has &quot;reduced expectations of what could be fixed, how long repairs would take
and how much money would be required.&quot; Good for Bechtel, but too bad for the people of
Iraq who are virtually without electricity or water and are living in sewage-filled
streets. According to USAID's own reports, one year after the invasion &quot;Baghdad's three
sewage treatment plants, which together comprise three-quarters of the nation's sewage
treatment capacity, are inoperable, allowing the waste from 3.8 million people to flow
untreated directly into the Tigris River. In the rest of the country, most sewage
treatment plants were only partially operational prior to the conflict, and shortage of
electricity, parts and chemicals have exacerbated the situation. Water that is pumped
through the system is largely untreated, especially in South.&quot; The most extensive
on-the-ground assessment of Iraq's water systems by Dahr Jamail for the consumer
watchdog group Public Citizen reached the same conclusion. Drinking water throughout the
country is in a crisis state, with some villages having no access to water while larger
cities receive water approximately 50% of the time. This has led to vast outbreaks of
cholera, diarrhea, nausea and kidney stones, among other diseases.

Electricity

The same condition exists for Iraq's electricity ‚ reconstruction of which is also
Bechtel's responsibility. According to a memo by an anonymous U.S. government official
written to the CPA in early March 2004, there is &quot;no consistency&quot; in power flows in
Iraq. &quot;Street lights function irregularly and traffic lights not at all&quot; &quot;Electricity in
Baghdad fluctuating between three hours, on and off, in rotation, and four hours on and
off.&quot; U.S. Airforce Colonel Sam Gardiner, author of a 2002 study of the likely effect US
bombardment would have on Iraq's power system, recently told the Village Voice, &quot;I
continue to get very upset about the electricity issue... Frankly, if we had just given
the Iraqis some baling wire and a little bit of space to keep things running, it would
have been better. But instead we've let big US companies go in with plans for major
overhauls.&quot; Thus, while Bechtel reports that they have &quot;returned electricity generation
to pre-conflict levels,&quot; this claim is not supported by the U.S. government or Iraqis
themselves. Power outages lasting for 24 hours a day are still more often the rule than
the exception. The Daura power plant, Baghdad's largest, which should supply one third
of the city's generating capacity was producing only 10% as recently as December. Helmut
Doll, the German site manager for Babcok Power, as subcontractor of Siemens, told
Newsweek that &quot;Bechtel only came and took photos. We can't judge Bechtel's work progress
because they're not here.&quot; The same story is repeated across Iraq. Either they haven't
seen Bechtel, or the work that has been provided is inadequate and intermittent. Bechtel
representatives have admitted as much, citing the constant sabotage of their work and
their ill-preparedness going in, commenting that they did not realize how intertwined
the electricity, water and sewage systems were, greatly complicating their repair
efforts. Of course, the Iraqis knew this and could have told them ‚ if they had asked.
Iraqis point out that after the first Gulf War, they were able to restore electricity in
just three months. Mohsen Hassan, technical director for power generation at the Iraqi
ministry of electricity, told Southern Exposure Magazine, &quot;We, the Iraqi engineers, can
repair anything, but we need money and spare parts and so far Bechtel has provided us
with neither. The only thing that the company has given us so far is promises.&quot;

Schools and Hospitals

Bechtel has also failed in its contractual obligations to restore hospitals and schools
in Iraq. Bechtel repeatedly cites the 1595 schools it has &quot;rehabilitated&quot; in Iraq.
However, this is less than a fifth of Iraq's 10,000 schools. And, as Newsweek reported,
&quot;many of the rehabilitated schools don't look ready for the morning bell.&quot; The constant
complaint from Iraqi Ministry of Education officials and headmistresses and ministers of
schools that Bechtel has worked on, is that the work is either non-existent or shoddy,
often putting students health and safety at risk. An internal study by U.S. Army
personnel cited in Southern Exposure, strongly criticized Bechtel's attempts to renovate
Iraqi schools. Comments such as the following were common: &quot;the new fans are cheap and
burned out immediately upon use. All inspected were already broke.&quot; &quot;Lousy paint job.
Major clean-up work required. Bathrooms in poor condition.&quot; Southern Exposure visited
four Baghdad schools all listed as renovated by Bechtel. They found rain leaking through
ceilings, shorting out power, new paint peeling and floors that had not been completely
repaired. New brass taps and doors painted, but toilets and sinks that had not been
touched. At Hawa School, for example, the headmistress showed the authors toilets where
a new water system had been installed, pipes, taps and a motor to pump the water.
However, the motor didn't work, so the toilets reeked with unflushed sewage. The
conditions reported in Bechtel hospitals are similar ‚ shoddy or non-existent work
accompanied with desperate and unmet human needs. The Bush Administration is not even
living up to its own requirements under national treatment because it is treating
foreign providers differently. The U.S. has banned countries that did not participate in
the invasion for profiting off of the invasion. Thus, in many cases, repairs that could
be performed quickly to the water and electrical systems are left undone because they
require parts from countries such as Russia, Germany or France.

4. Unrestricted Repatriation of Profits

Order #39 authorizes foreign investors to &quot;transfer abroad without delay all funds
associated with [their] investment.&quot; Thus, they can put their money wherever they like
and take it out whenever they want to, &quot;without delay.&quot; Nothing need be reinvested
locally to service the floundering Iraqi economy. Nothing need be targeted to help
specifically damaged regions, communities or services. All the money can go home with
the foreign owners and they can take out their investments at any time. U.S.
corporations are already reaping staggering revenues from their Iraqi operations.
However, due to Order #39, not a cent of this money need be reinvested in Iraq.
Halliburton, with contracts worth as much as $16.8 billion in Iraq has seen its revenues
increase 80% in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same quarter of 2003.
According to the Financial Times, they are receiving steep &quot;profits from their Iraq
operations.&quot; Bechtel, with nearly $3 billion in Iraqi contracts, has seen their
non-U.S.-generated revenues increase by a whopping 158% since last year ‚ turning around
a three-year slump. Bechtel is not publicly traded and therefore does not have to reveal
profits. However, both Bechtel and Halliburton have cost-plus contracts that guarantee a
specified rate of profit on their work. ChevronTexaco which has a comparatively minor
contract for transporting Iraqi oil has also seen revenues soar. It is important to note
that neither Halliburton nor Bechtel participated in the most recent round of Iraq
reconstruction contract bids. A good guess as to why would be the constant barrage of
public criticism they have faced over the failures in Iraq. These are just three of the
hundreds of U.S. companies now operating in Iraq ‚ all of their money could return to
the U.S. ‚ non of it need be used to benefit Iraq whatsoever.

Unfortunately, we don't really know how much money the Iraqis are missing out on, nor
exactly what work is being done nor by whom. This is because, as the Center for Public
Integrity ‚ the organization which has done the most extensive Freedom of Information
Act requests and investigations into these contracts ‚ so aptly states, &quot;it [does] not
appear that any one government agency [knows] that total number of contractors or what
they are doing.&quot; This finding has since been upheld by both the General Accounting
Office and the Pentagon's inspector-general - both of which have recently concluded
studies demonstrating little or no government over site over contractors and contracts
being granted, renewed and increased with virtually no inspection of written documents
nor work performed. Finally, returning to repatriation of profits ‚ the potential
long-term impact of this provision for the Iraqi economy is monumental, as evidenced by
the impact of the same rules on the &quot;financial tigers&quot; of East Asia, as well as
Argentina and Russia. Each of these countries experienced devastating financial collapse
when foreign investors simultaneously withdrew billions of dollars from their economies
while the governments were powerless to enact restrictions on either the inward or
outward flow of investments. Iraq is now poised to meet the same fate.

5. 40-year leases

Under Order #39 Iraq will be locked in to its contracts under these rules for 40 years,
with an option of unlimited renewal. If the contracts are broken, the Order gives the
companies the legal authority to enact any international trade agreement of which both
countries are party. If the Bush Administration is successful in implementing its trade
goals outlined below, the U.S. will have a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with Iraq.
The BIT provides access to courts such as the World Bank's International Centre for the
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a venue notorious for its undemocratic,
untransparent and unjust proceedings and rulings on behalf of multinational
corporations.

Bremer Order #40: Banking

Order #40 fundamentally alters Iraq's banking structure by turning this sector from a
state-run to a market-driven system over night by allowing foreign banks to enter the
Iraqi market and to purchase up to 50 percent of an Iraqi bank. Specifically, it permits
six foreign banks over the next five years the right to enter the Iraqi market. A
similar provision included in NAFTA paved the way for Citigroup to purchase Mexico's
largest commercial bank, Banamex. In Aotearoa/New Zealand, liberalization of financial
banking services left every one of the nation's banks, including the bank of New
Zealand, under foreign control. Affordable financial services and low-cost loans quickly
dried up ‚ so much so that the government proposed setting up a new bank, the People's
Bank, to be owned and operated by the government itself in order to redress the
inequities of the foreign-owned banks. Local ownership of banks is critical because it
facilitates access to credit for all sectors of society. It may deter disloyal behavior;
foreign finance companies are much more likely to flee in times of crisis. And ensuring
that a foreign company holds some domestic assets within the country in which it is
operating can help ensure it can satisfy any legal liabilities it might accrue.
Moreover, Iraq simply does not have adequate regulatory structures in place to handle
the economic power and marketing prowess of global financial companies. For example,
Iraq does not have a counter-part to U.S. laws such as the Community Reinvestment Act --
obligating banks to make credit available in lower-income neighborhoods -- and the Truth
in Lending Act -- requiring full disclosure to consumers of the cost of loans. Finally,
with the banks under foreign ownership, the lobby against adoption of such rules may be
too strong to fight. JPMorgan, the second-largest bank in the U.S., which was implicated
in the Enron scandal, has been awarded a contract to run a consortium of 13 banks from
13 countries that will constitute the Trade Bank of Iraq. The Trade Bank may be just the
point of entry for JPMorgan, giving it &quot;first dibs&quot; on the full privatization yet to
come.

Bremer Order #37: Taxes

Order #37 changes Iraq's tax law by implementing a flat tax that provides for a marginal
income tax rate of 15% for both corporations and individuals. Thus, an Iraqi earning .50
cents per hour will pay the same tax rate as another earning $1 billion an hour. Flat
rates have a record of reducing the tax burden on the poorest in the economy, increasing
the burden on the middle class tremendously, and drastically reducing the taxes paid by
the wealthiest in society ‚ particularly corporations. As the Washington Post reports,
&quot;it took L. Paul Bremer, the U.S. administrator in Baghdad, no more than a stroke of the
pen Sept. 15 to accomplish what eluded the likes of publisher Steve Forbes, Reps. Jack
Kemp (R-N.Y.) and Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.), and Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) over the
course of a decade and two presidential campaigns.&quot;

Bremer Order #12: Trade Liberalization

On June 12, Bremer signed the &quot;Trade Liberalization Policy,&quot; suspending &quot;all tariffs,
customs duties, import taxes, licensing fees and similar surcharges for goods entering
or leaving Iraq, and all other trade restrictions that may apply to such goods.&quot; This
led to an immediate and dramatic inflow of cheap consumer products, which has
essentially wiped out all local providers of the same products. This could have
significant long-term implications for domestic production as well. But tariff
elimination is just the beginning. In early February 2004, BearingPoint was right on
schedule when the Bush Administration achieved WTO observer status for Iraq ‚ even
without a government ‚ over the strong objections of many of our European allies. This
is the first step towards WTO membership, which also requires the fundamental
transformation of Iraq's laws to bring them in to WTO-compliance. The longer-term goal
was announced by President Bush just two months after the invasion of Iraq. On May 9,
2003, President Bush announced plans for an U.S.-Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA) by
2013 ‚ bringing all of the policies outlined above, and more, to the entire region. The
Middle East, insulated by oil revenue, has historically been less susceptible than other
regions to the extreme sacrifices required by governments under corporate free trade
agreements. But with the invasion and occupation of Iraq, the Bush Administration
demonstrated that it would defy global public opinion and the United Nations to use
military force when and where it deems necessary. Thus, it can now return to the more
traditional model of advancing corporate globalization, the free trade agreement. As
George Wolfe, director of Economic Policy for the CPA told the New York Times, &quot;in the
long run, the United States hopes that Iraq will become an economic model for the Middle
East.&quot; Or, put more bluntly by Neil King of the Wall Street Journal, &quot;For many
conservatives, Iraq is now the test case for whether the U.S. can engender
American-style free-market capitalism within the Arab World.&quot;

How to Bring the U.S. in to Accord with International Law and Morality

It is illegal and immoral for the Bush Administration to use the military invasion and
occupation of Iraq to fundamentally alter that nation's basic laws. It is also illegal
and immoral for the Bush Administration to continue to ignore its obligation under
international law to provide for the basic necessities of Iraqis. The first step needed
to bring the U.S. in to accord with international law and morality is to repeal the
Bremer Orders detailed above. The second step is to allow detailed public scrutiny of
the BearingPoint plan in both Iraq and the U.S. Most of it should be repealed. At most,
it should provide only for the short-term economic necessities required of the U.S.
under international law to restore Iraq's basic infrastructure and services and to
ensure that the economy does not collapse during reconstruction. Once the Iraqi
government is elected, it is the Iraqis themselves who must determine their long-term
economic future‚ not the U.S. In the short-term, the following alternatives drawn from
more detailed analysis provided by International Occupation Watch Center in Baghdad, the
Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, DC and the International Forum on
Globalization ( &lt; http://www.occupationwatch.org/ &gt; http://www.occupationwatch.org/ ,
&lt; http://www.ips-dc.org/ &gt; http://www.ips-dc.org/ ,  &lt; http://www.ifg.org/ &gt;
http://www.ifg.org/ , are offered to help restore the Iraqi economy to a functioning
position.

·         The military occupation of Iraq must end.

·         Iraq's foreign debts, accrued by Hussein in the suppression of the people of
Iraq, must be forgiven.

·         Only with the end of the U.S.-UK occupation should the United Nations,
including an UN-commanded multilateral peacekeeping force, return to Iraq. Their mandate
should be for a very short and defined period, with the goal of assisting Iraq in
reconstruction and overseeing election of a governing authority.

·         As belligerent powers who initiated the war, and as occupying powers, the U.S.
and the UK are obligated to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people and
to pay the continuing costs of Iraq's reconstruction, including the bulk of the cost of
UN humanitarian and peacekeeping deployments. Washington should reverse the spending
priorities of its $87 billion request from Congress, and turn over to full UN authority
(on behalf of the Iraqi people as a whole, not simply given to the U.S.-appointed
Council) a starting grant of at least $75 billion (the initial amount Washington spent
on waging the war) for reconstruction in Iraq.

·         The $15 billion (out of the $87 billion) requested by the Bush administration
for Iraqi reconstruction is insufficient to meet Washington's obligations under
international law. The $65 billion scheduled for the Pentagon to continue the occupation
of Iraq should be challenged. The additional reconstruction funds should not come from
ordinary taxpayers. They should be raised from (a) an excess profits tax on corporations
benefiting from the war and post-war privatization in Iraq; and (b) the Pentagon budget
lines currently directed at continuing war in Iraq.

·         Reconstruction of Iraq should be based on rebuilding the economy to maximize
fulfilling the needs of the Iraqi people. All contract processes should be completely
transparent and accessible to Iraqis. The awarding of contracts should be done with
preference given first to Iraqi companies, experts and workers. Preference should then
be given to international humanitarian organizations with a record of performing similar
reconstruction work. If a non-Iraqi private company must be used, the contract must be
open to global competition and the profit margin must be held as low as possible at a
fixed fee. Oversight must be transparent, public and thorough.

·         Labor laws should ensure protection and security for local workers.

·         A broad U.S. Federal Government investigation must be launched to scrutinize
U.S. corporate expenditures and actions in Iraq, with the power to impose or seek
punitive measures for contract violations and over-expenditure, and to provide
oversight, regulation and accountability of U.S. contractor's work in the application of
their contracts. The citizens of Iraq and the U.S. Congress and public should be
informed of the findings.

·         Iraq should be allowed to join the Worldwide movement for local sustainability
by moving away from export oriented economics that make trade and multinational
corporations the basis of economic development. Government spending, taxes, subsidies,
tariff structures, etc. should be reoriented to support local environmentally
sustainable production that meets local needs (these ideas are expanded upon in the IFG
publication, Alternatives to Economic Globalization)

The Multibillion Robbery The US Calls Reconstruction &amp; The shameless corporate feeding
frenzy in Iraq is fuelling the resistance
&lt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1247867,00.html &gt;
http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1247867,00.html

Naomi Klein, June 26, 2004,  &lt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/ &gt; The Guardian, UK

The Program Management Office, which oversees the $18.4bn in US reconstruction funds,
has finally set a goal it can meet. Sure, electricity is below pre-war levels, the
streets are rivers of sewage and more Iraqis have been fired than hired. But now the PMO
has contracted the British mercenary firm Aegis to protect its employees from
&quot;assassination, kidnapping, injury and&quot; - get this - &quot;embarrassment&quot;. I don't know if
Aegis will succeed in protecting PMO employees from violent attack, but embarrassment?
I'd say mission already accomplished. The people in charge of rebuilding Iraq can't be
embarrassed, because, clearly, they have no shame.

Their god is G: gold O: oil D: drugs

In the run-up to the June 30 underhand (sorry, I can't bring myself to call it a
&quot;handover&quot;), US occupation powers have been unabashed in their efforts to steal money
that is supposed to aid a war-ravaged people. The state department has taken $184m
earmarked for drinking water projects and moved it to the budget for the lavish new US
embassy in Saddam Hussein's former palace. Short of $1bn for the embassy, Richard
Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, said he might have to &quot;rob from Peter in my
fiefdom to pay Paul&quot;. In fact, he is robbing Iraq's people, who, according to a recent
study by the consumer group Public Citizen, are facing &quot;massive outbreaks of cholera,
diarrhoea, nausea and kidney stones&quot; from drinking contaminated water. If the occupation
chief Paul Bremer and his staff were capable of embarrassment, they might be a little
sheepish about having spent only $3.2bn of the $18.4bn Congress allotted - the reason
the reconstruction is so disastrously behind schedule. At first, Bremer said the money
would be spent by the time Iraq was sovereign, but apparently someone had a better idea:
parcel it out over five years so Ambassador John Negroponte can use it as leverage. With
$15bn outstanding, how likely are Iraq's politicians to refuse US demands for military
bases and economic &quot;reforms&quot;? Unwilling to let go of their own money, the shameless ones
have had no qualms about dipping into funds belonging to Iraqis. After losing the fight
to keep control of Iraq's oil money after the underhand, occupation authorities grabbed
$2.5bn of those revenues and are now spending the money on projects that are supposedly
already covered by American tax dollars.

But then, if financial scandals made you blush, the entire reconstruction of Iraq would
be pretty mortifying. From the start, its architects rejected the idea that it should be
a New Deal-style public works project for Iraqis to reclaim their country. Instead, it
was treated as an ideological experiment in privatisation. The dream was for
multinational firms, mostly from the US, to swoop in and dazzle the Iraqis with their
speed and efficiency. Iraqis saw something else: desperately needed jobs going to
Americans, Europeans and south Asians; roads crowded with trucks shipping in supplies
produced in foreign plants, while Iraqi factories were not even supplied with emergency
generators. As a result, the reconstruction was seen not as a recovery from war but as
an extension of the occupation, a foreign invasion of a different sort. And so, as the
resistance grew, the reconstruction itself became a prime target. The contractors have
responded by behaving even more like an invading army, building elaborate fortresses in
the green zone - the walled-in city within a city that houses the occupation authority
in Baghdad - and surrounding themselves with mercenaries. And being hated is expensive.
According to the latest estimates, security costs are eating up 25% of reconstruction
contracts - money not being spent on hospitals, water-treatment plants or telephone
exchanges.

Meanwhile, insurance brokers selling sudden-death policies to contractors in Iraq have
doubled their premiums, with insurance costs reaching 30% of payroll. That means many
companies are spending half their budgets arming and insuring themselves against the
people they are supposedly in Iraq to help. And, according to Charles Adwan of
Transparency International, quoted on US National Public Radio's Marketplace programme,
&quot;at least 20% of US spending in Iraq is lost to corruption&quot;. How much is actually left
over for reconstruction? Don't do the maths. Rather than models of speed and efficiency,
the contractors look more like overcharging, underperforming, lumbering beasts, barely
able to move for fear of the hatred they have helped generate. The problem goes well
beyond the latest reports of Halliburton drivers abandoning $85,000 trucks on the road
because they don't carry spare tyres. Private contractors are also accused of playing
leadership roles in the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib. A landmark class-action
lawsuit filed by the Centre for Constitutional Rights alleges that Titan Corporation and
CACI International conspired to &quot;humiliate, torture and abuse persons&quot; in order to
increase demand for their &quot;interrogation services&quot;. And then there's Aegis, the company
being paid $293m to save the PMO from embarrassment. It turns out that Aegis's CEO, Tim
Spicer, has a bit of an embarrassing past himself. In the 90s, he helped to put down
rebels and stage a military coup in Papua New Guinea, as well as hatching a plan to
break an arms embargo in Sierra Leone. If Iraq's occupiers were capable of feeling
shame, they might have responded by imposing tough new regulations. Instead, Senate
Republicans have just defeated an attempt to bar private contractors from interrogating
prisoners and also voted down a proposal to impose stiffer penalties on contractors who
overcharge. Meanwhile, the White House is also trying to get immunity from prosecution
for US contractors in Iraq and has requested the exemption from the new prime minister,
Iyad Allawi. It seems likely that Allawi will agree, since he is, after all, a kind of
US contractor himself. A former CIA spy, he is already threatening to declare martial
law, while his defence minister says of resistance fighters: &quot;We will cut off their
hands, and we will behead them.&quot; In a final feat of outsourcing, Iraqi governance has
been subcontracted to even more brutal surrogates. Is this embarrassing, after an
invasion to overthrow a dictatorship? Not at all; this is what the occupiers call
&quot;sovereignty&quot;. The Aegis guys can relax - embarrassment is not going to be an issue. A

Anarchists Against the Wall block Central Tel Aviv

Israeli activists blocked central Tel Aviv with razor wire from the Apartheid Wall. The
activists stretched the razor wire across Basel Street with a sign from the Wall that
reads in Arabic, Hebrew and English: &quot;Anyone who touches the fence endangers their
life.&quot; The twenty activists from Anarchists Against the Wall, who attend the weekly
Friday demonstrations against the Apartheid Wall in Bil'in, set up the blockade at
around 2pm and started handing out flyers to passers by explaining the action. The
action was taken to protest the Apartheid Wall being built through the West Bank, as
well as severe travel restrictions on Palestinians. The leaflets remind Israelis that
they bear responsibility for the suffering of Palestinians as a result of their
government's apartheid policies. For details contact Yonaton Pollack: 0546327736 For
