Another question I'm afraid. Why do daguerrotypes seem to be less favoured
among the well heeled collectors when they are older than the ambrotypes.
Ambrotypes because the process was more transportable, one would think, would
be more commonly found. Being the eternal learner can be bothersome at times.

was of the opinion they were more desirable, hence more expensive. I'd like to
learn more about this also if that is the case.

"/> There are only two instances when I've seen daguerrotypes bring
more money than ambrotypes. 1. Ambrotypes were in very bad
condition. 2. Daguerrotypes were of Civil War men in uniform
(preferably holding weapons). I suppose if you had daguerrotypes
of an internationally famous person, they may also command a
higher price.

"/> This is what I was thinking. You need to see what the subject matter is.
There are so many dauguerrotypes of unknown people around and these really
don't bring much money. Also, the case that the images are in play an
important role. If you have a case with interesting designs rather than the
typical scrolls, geometric patterns or flowers this will bring more money. The
small round (sweetheart) or octagonal cases bring more. There are some people
who collect only the case and don't care what image it holds.

I recently sold 2 ambrotypes not in great condition and in no case for over
$30. But these were of a Scottish dance troupe so the image was unusual. So
much must be considered in pricing these. I think I will do a search on eBay
just to get an idea because I've never checked their prices before.

"/> Ashley, Would I be correct in assuming that the age of the process has very
little to do with the value of these antique photographic objects. What a
pity! Its a bit like saying that a Baxter Print ( the First commercial colour
printing process in the industrial age) ain't worth much because the subject
of the print isn't interesting. Wow I sure have got a lot to learn.

"/> Daguerreotypes: Introduced 1839, Peak Years 1852-1854, Waned 1858-1860, Last
made 1865

Ambrotypes: Introduced 1854, Peak years 1857-1859, Waned 1861, Last made 1865

Tintype: Introduced 1856, Peak Years 1860-1863, Waned 1865, Last made 1867,

There isn't much difference in the time frame of the three processes actually.
So what it comes down to is interest of the subject matter. Also, there were
some very well known photographers whose photographs will also be more valuable
regardless of the subject matter. As I stated in an earlier post, I was not
aware that tintypes brought more money than daugerrotypes; had always thought
that given similar subject matter, condition, and case they were equal in
value.

"/> It should be pointed out (again) that tin types and ambrotypes use
exactly the same process. They are just 'finished' on a different media.
