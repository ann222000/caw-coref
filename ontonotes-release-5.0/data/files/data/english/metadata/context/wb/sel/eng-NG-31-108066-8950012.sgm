Yesterday we set up a Society display in Fort Pierce. All of us looked
around, and I put a little Paph on *lay-away* until today when I didn't have
so much to carry. The Paph is spicerianum x primulinum. Picture here:

When we went back today, Voila! A small number of Plectrelminthus caudatus,
in spike. Some were kind of beaten up, but I found one with two new,
unharmed spikes. It now resides by the pool.

Info and picture here:

It pays to scavenge a little bit.

Oh, yes: I forgot to name the Paph. It is P. Lemonade.
