Ladiies and Gentlmen:
I consider this article by Pat Utomi the foremost posting of the month in Nigerian e-goups. Only the mindsets of this caliber and framework will advance Nigeria. The article sheds some light on some of my bewildering thoughts about the operations and attitudes of some Nigerians, even on these e-groups. The following can be better understood and appreciated from this article:
1. Why ethnic jingoism reigns supreme in several Nigerian e-groups, such that greater then 90% of the contribution of some people border on ethnic issues. In the words of Pat Utomi: &quot;Take ethnicity. There is so much of it around ---------- it is the prism through which some people see everything.&quot;
2. There was a leadership crisis in NIDO Americas recently that could have been resolved on its merit, which was that the majority of the Board members felt there was the need for leadership change. However, it was amazing how some of us saw ethnic ramifications on the issue such that supposedly reasonable people like Adey Adenuga could not rationally and objectively analyze the issues any more if the facts presented did not support their ethnic baises on the matter. Thank God, All-Nigerians like IBK and Dele Olawole were around.
3. Why I keep getting cheap shot from people like Chuks Agwunobi that Igietseme participates in more All-Nigerian groups than strictly Edo organizations. From Pat Utomi's analysis, my wonderment is eased up because I have always thought that I should defend Nigeria first before Edo, the rationale being that Edo will be preserved if Nigeria is survives as a nation. Is it not meaningless to ignore Nigeria and focus on Edo but to wake up one day and find out that Nigeria is no more and the Edo I am focusing on goes with the fall of the nation?

In my opinion, Pat Utomi is right to see a paradox when someone surprised him by saying that a major challenge to his candidacy for the office of the President of Nigeria was that he was too Nigerian. Thus, while some of us would gracefully and contentedly fancy ourselves as All-Nigerian youngsters, in the American manner of usage, for some Nigerians, open mindedness meant your ethnic group could not trust you enough. An amazing counter-intuitive paradox in deed!

According to Pat Utomi, to be regaded as being more Nigerian than ones ethnic group is definitely a complement, and considering the favorable and civilized merits of national identity, ethnic chauvinism is clearly an obstacle to communication that can get in the way of men/women, who could ordinarily have done much good, from getting their ideas across and building solidarity Nigeria writ large. Ultimately, it is thrilling to identify with the veritable belief that Pan-Nigerian outlook and solidarity would constitute a veritable instrument for nation building and for defining ones self worth. This is my candid opinion on this matter. Joe Igietseme

The Futility Of Ethnic Chauvinism
By Pat Utomi

It is amazing how what you think about can define you and hold you hostage. Take ethnicity. There is so much of it around that unless something thrusts it to the fore of your consciousness; you forget it is the prism through which some people see everything. I became sensitive to my good fortune when a reaction of the ethnic dimension on the N628milion House of Representative Scandal hit a List Serve (e-group) that I subscribe to. I probably would have thought little of it all beyond acknowledging that some held and expressed strong opinion, a democratic privilege, until someone I know whose views I shared, felt very strongly about people who made sweeping remarks regarding his ethnic group, and reacted.

I agreed with him that it was improper to attack his ethnic group because a principal player in the scandal comes from that ethnic stock and some chieftains from that geographic group had said the person in question should be defended on account of that persons place of origin. Even if there were not so many people who are of that ethnic origin, that have spoken critically of the House of Representative Leadership and called for resignation, the slamming of an ethnic group for the sin of one, or a few persons, would still be most inappropriate.

But that is not so much the object of my writing as the desire to share a personal testimony on the futility of ethnic chauvinism and how it can hold us captive. As is the nature personal testimonies it will be in the first person and names of individuals, some of whom are well known will be mentioned. Let me apologize up front to those who may not like that mode of narrative.

Earlier this year, someone surprised me by saying that a major challenge to my candidacy for the office of the President of Nigeria was that I was too Nigerian. I found that quite a paradox. Yes, as a young man I fancied myself an All-Nigerian youngster, in the American manner of usage. For some, open mindedness meant your ethnic group could not trust you enough.

I always took pride in my Pan-Nigerian upbringing. How come being seen as free from the captivity of the ethnic group is a handicap. In reaction, I raised the profile of how I grew up, making the point that no other candidate for the office of the President of Nigeria had as complete a Nigerian background: born in Kaduna of parents from Delta State, raised in Jos, Maiduguri, Kano, Gusau, Onitsha, Ibadan and Lagos before University education at Nsukka. I was not going to be apologetic about the fact that I grew up unable to tell the difference between people beyond the content of their character.

Then I ran into Alhaji Bamanga Tukur. His comment, unsolicited, reinforced my disposition. Said he to me: your remarkable strength is that people never think of where you come from. You belong to all Nigerians. It was a comment that made me feel good because that really was how I saw myself. My puzzle was how to make every one else feel that way. Do they have to have nomadic parents, like me, to be Nigerian. Then I thought of the person who made the comment about my being too Nigerian.

He had lived most of his adult life outside of his state of origin. So, even if moving around helped me, I needed to find more reasons. Surely many have been freed of some terrible prejudices by one year of National Service in the NYSC than some have from living in Lagos, Abuja and Kano for most of their adult lives. It occurred to me that friendship, open minds, set people free of becoming captive of simplistic stereotypes about others that makes it easy to judge without difficult evaluation of the content of each character.

My thinking was validated when shortly after the April elections, I went abroad for a bit of rest. Many friends from both sides of the Atlantic were kind enough to invite me, and in some cases my whole family, to be guests in their homes. At the time I did not think much about the scope of the network of friends in terms of the spread of ethnic backgrounds of those who welcome us into their homes. From Charles Gilbert and Mohammed Hayatudeen, of Ondo and Borno States, in Florida, to Linus Ojukwu of Anambra State, in California, Jimi Akiboh and Chris Obeime of Ogun State and Edo origins, in the American Midwest. There was also occasion of being hosted by a group of doctors and other professionals from Katsina and Nassarawa States in London, and across the Atlantic by Bassey Okon, where I found myself exploring the wealth of Nigeria, its people, without even a thought about where their parents claim as states of origin.

It was on one such visit that the true benefit of belonging to all, struck me. As I discussed the idea of a shadow government focused on helping Nigeria re-discover its compass, that plain-speaking Shehu Othman, who came in from Oxford to chat with me, said a welcome idea like that would usually draw suspicion of motives from the North, but for the fact it was coming from someone like me, whose motives were not distrusted in the North, or any part of Nigeria for that matter.

Beyond finding such, a complement, the lesson for me was that ethnic chauvinism was clearly an obstacle to communication. It got in the way of men, who could ordinarily have done much good, from getting their ideas across and building solidarity Nigeria writ large. That Pan-Nigerian solidarity is a veritable instrument for nation building. To what do I believe, I owe the good fortune of escape from tribal capture? I guess it has to do with making the most of the privilege of experiencing diversity, and allowing that to define my self worth.

Take my wedding nearly a quarter century ago, as example. On that day, Patrick Ityogheh, the NTA impresario, teased about who should break kola nuts, as Otunba Subomi Balogun sat between Ajie Ukpabi Asika, Chief Tayo Akpata and Chief Arthur Mbanefo. It did not take an effort to have the Northwest, North Central, South West, South South and South East at the wedding. It came natural to my network. The same feeling rises up in me as I engage the young, the old, the traditional and the modern with faith that the ultimate value is the dignity of the human person, the equal dignity of all persons.

It plays through as I reflect on the many young upwardly mobile that I mentor, the Gbenga Sesans, Niyi Adesanyas Linus Okories and Kabiru Mohammeds etc and with the traditional rulers I have known most of my adult life. When Alhaji Sa'ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto calls me on occasion, to pull my legs on some issues, he is counting on a relationship that dates back to when he was a young officer and friend to my brother-in-law two decades ago. And when I deal with the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Achebe, I go back 30 years to my visits to the Victoria Island apartment of the bachelor rising manager at Shell. In like manner, when I show up at the Palace in Iloko, I am visiting an Oba Olashore who has been like a family member for decades. But the real lesson from my experience is that being

Some of us can do some good to themsleves and our community if they shut up when they don't have an intelligent contibution to an issue at hand; rather, some elect to exhibit their imbeliic traits by attacking people when substantive issues of national significance are under discussion. It is a distract we can do without. So Dan Zugeru should realize that we are discussing and focusing on issues here, not cursring and swearing at people like a rascal he appears to be. A word is enough for the wise. Igietseme

Every time Igietseme writes, he must find a way to connect it with the doctor in Canada. We are tired of your obsession with the guy. Why are you so myopic in your views? Why are you so obsessed with those that dont go along with your thoughts?

The Futility Of Ethnic Chauvinism

It is amazing how what you think about can define you and hold you hostage. Take ethnicity. There is so much of it around that unless something thrusts it to the fore of your consciousness; you forget it is the prism through which some people see everything. I became sensitive to my good fortune when a reaction of the ethnic dimension on the N628milion House of Representative Scandal hit a List Serve (e-group) that I subscribe to.

Dear Joe:

Curiously enough, I came away from Prof. Utomi's take on &quot;The Futility of
Ethnic Chauvinism&quot; with a completely different impression, and came to a
totally different conclusion as you did.

Pat Utomi did not give a single serious situation where Ethnicity played a
role in his life - not in his upbringing, not in his career, not in his
marriage, not in his bid for the presidency, not in the reception he
received when he &quot;went abroad for a bit of rest. Many friends from both
sides of the Atlantic were kind enough to invite me, and in some cases my
whole family, to be guests in their homes. At the time I did not think much
about the scope of the network of friends in terms of the spread of ethnic
backgrounds of those who welcome us into their homes. From Charles Gilbert
and Mohammed Hayatudeen, of Ondo and Borno States, in Florida, to Linus
Ojukwu of Anambra State, in California, Jimi Akiboh and Chris Obeime of Ogun
State and Edo origins, in the American Midwest. There was also occasion of
being hosted by a group of doctors and other professionals from Katsina and
Nassarawa States in London, and across the Atlantic by Bassey Okon, where I
found myself exploring the wealth of Nigeria, its people, without even a
thought about where their parents claim as states of origin.&quot;

Where is the trace of any &quot;Ethnic Chauvinism&quot; here?

Why does Pat Utomi assume that every one of us must feel &quot;being a Nigerian&quot;
exactly the same way that he Pat Utomi feels it? Must every Nigerian then go
through Pat uromi's developmental path? And must one go through that
developmental path in order to be considered a true &quot;Nigerian&quot;? How about
the majority of Nigerians who will never ever reside outside their own
ethnic enclave? Are they also not &quot;Nigerians&quot; then?

Even in America, that made Pat Utomi &quot;fancied ]himself] an All-Nigerian
youngster, in the American manner of usage&quot;, that you and Pat Utomi
erroneously assume does not ever take into consideration the ethnic
background of the American, ask the presidential candidates.

And America is not Nigeria anyways - the pattern of settlement, and even of
colonization by the British, are radically different in Nigeria and in the
USA, but that's a peripheral matter here for now.

Furthermore, your examples are totally skewed and inaccurate, and they tend
to prove exactly the opposite:

&quot;There was a leadership crisis in NIDO Americas recently that could have
been resolved on its merit, which was that the majority of the Board members
felt there was the need for leadership change. However, it was amazing how
some of us saw ethnic ramifications on the issue such that supposedly
reasonable people like Adey Adenuga could not rationally and objectively
analyze the issues any more if the facts presented did not support their
ethnic baises on the matter. Thank God, All-Nigerians like IBK and Dele
Olawole were around.&quot;

You chose to read ethnic bias into Adenuga's position (because his Yoruba),
and you refer to him as &quot;supposedly reasonable people&quot;, without naming any
other single Yoruba person that supported Adenuga's views. At the same time
you say &quot;Thank God, All-Nigerians like IBK and Dele Olawole were around&quot;, &quot;&quot;
are Yoruba.

One Yoruba (Adey Adenuga) was against you, two Yoruba (IBK and Dele Olawole)
were in support - according to your own report - is this then a proof of
&quot;Ethnic Chauvinism&quot;, or lack thereof?

You other &quot;proof&quot; of &quot;Ethnic Chauvinism&quot; also falls far short of a proof:

&quot;Why I keep getting cheap shot from people like Chucks Agwunobi that
Igietseme participates in more All-Nigerian groups than strictly Edo
organizations.&quot;

Chuks Agwunobi regularly sends &quot;cheap shots&quot; to the &quot;Ngbati&quot; crowd on these
forums. Should all the Yoruba now rise up and accuse Chuks Agwunobi - and by
extension, the entire Igbo people - of &quot;Ethnic Chauvinism&quot; against the
Yoruba?

What do you think?

Moving on, you observed:

&quot;In my opinion, Pat Utomi is right to see a paradox when someone surprised
him by saying that a major challenge to his candidacy for the office of the
President of Nigeria was that he was too Nigerian.&quot;

Curiously enough though, that person may a point. Please bear with me, and
read me carefully with an open mind.

Look back into recent Nigerian history. One of MKO Abiola's initial
challenges was that most Yoruba did exactly accept him as a Yoruba candidate
- he was considered to be too much aligned to the North, to the Hausa
hegemony. It contributed to his ultimate failure to clinch the presidency.
He was being too Nigerian, without being Yoruba.

Similarly, Olusegun Obasanjo was never accepted as candidate of the Yoruba.
He was also seen as hand-picked by the Northern power brokers and the
military oligarchy by his own Yoruba people.

A candidate that has no firm constituency among his own people, who should
know him best, how does that candidate expect to secure an &quot;All-Nigerian&quot;
legitimacy when his own people who also make up part of that &quot;All-Nigeria&quot;
of which he is claiming to be a perfect model do not accept him?

That is precisely the PARADOX! You must first be able to be recognized as a
legitimate representative of your own ethnic group before you can seriously
expect recognition from the other ethnic groups that co-exist with yours in
Nigeria!

Otherwise, you cannot gain any true legitimacy in the committee of
Nigerians.

Being a &quot;vagrant&quot; or &quot;nomadic&quot; Nigerian does not necessarily make you a
&quot;model Nigerian&quot; - it rather makes of you more of a Nigerian without real
roots actually.

And this where - with all due respect - I believe that you and Pat Utomi are
utterly in error, and I will try to prove it:

&quot;I have always thought that I should defend Nigeria first before Edo, the
rationale being that Edo will be preserved if Nigeria is survives as a
nation. Is it not meaningless to ignore Nigeria and focus on Edo but to wake
up one day and find out that Nigeria is no more and the Edo I am focusing on
goes with the fall of the nation?&quot;

You are wrong - it is the very opposite, using your own words: &quot;the
rationale being that NIGERIA will be preserved a as NATION [only] if [the
EDO] (and the other Nigerian ethnicities] survive as VIBRANT and VIABLE
ETHNICITIES!&quot;

You kill anyone of them, you kill Nigeria as NATION. These ethnicities
pre-date the existence of the entity called Nigeria.

If you can therefore not be an accepted and recognized member of your own
ethnicity, which is what makes you a Nigerian since your ethnicity happens
to reside with the politically boundaries of Nigeria - artificially and
arbitrarily created by the British, lest we forget - how one earth do you
expect to be recognized and accepted by the other ethnicities of Nigeria?

Besides, your being a &quot;Nigerian&quot; can change. But your being an &quot;Edo man&quot; can
never change. Today, the ethnicities that occupy Bakassi - who were once
&quot;Nigerians&quot; - have again been declared by the &quot;white boss&quot; in Den Hague as
no longer &quot;Nigerians&quot;, but &quot;Cameroonians&quot;. Have they also been able change
their ethnicity as well?

Therefore, Dr. Joe Igietseme, which is more important, more impacting, and
more primary to defining who you really are, your artificially created
&quot;Nigerianess&quot;, or your natural, God-given &quot;Edo&quot; being?

I again put it to you and to Pat Utomi:

If you cannot be recognized by the Edo as an &quot;ideal model of an Edo man&quot;,
then do not be surprised that you will never make an &quot;ideal model of a
Nigerian man&quot;.

Your being able to present yourself as an &quot;ideal Nigerian&quot; presupposes first
and foremost that you are also an &quot;ideal Edo&quot;. They should NOT be mutually
exclusive. When they are mutually exclusive, you have a MAJOR DISCONNECT
that needs must be resolved before you can again be WHOLE.

The REAL PARADOX then is that you and Pat Utomi are expecting that an Edo
perceived by the Edo as not being a &quot;true Edo&quot;, or a Yoruba that is not
perceived by the Yoruba as &quot;representative&quot; of the Yoruba, etc., can
gravitate by magic to be a &quot;Pan-Nigerian&quot; ideal!

How?

Finally, there is more animosity within the ethnic groups, than the ethnic
groups ever express against each other. The crisis in the East is
Intra-igbo; the crisis in Ibadan is Intra-Yoruba, even the crisis in the
Delta is more frequently within the different militant groups of the same
ethnicity!

And the ON-GOING looting in Abuja and the various state capitals and council
headquarters has not to the best of my knowledge shown any tendency of
&quot;Ethnic Chauvinism&quot;.

The Mallam who died in the House of Reps defending the thieving Speaker of
the House, a Yoruba, was not himself a Yoruba. So where exactly is this
ubiquitous &quot;Ethnic Chauvinism&quot;?

So why do some Nigerian intellectuals still insist on forever conjuring up
this chimera, an beating this dead horse of &quot;Ethnic Chauvinism&quot; that would
appear to exist only in their own ripe imagination, and as a relic of what
the Europeans have drummed into our heads - &quot;tribalism is your problem in
Africa&quot; - as if the Europeans themselves are devoid of tribal differences?

What I see here is the Futility of forever trying to blame everything
failing in Nigeria on &quot;Ethnic Chauvinism&quot;, rather than looking for the
deeper causes which I believe lie in our different mentalities,
sensibilities, and in our histories.

Chuks Agwunobi:

Don't cause any distraction here. Under normal circumstances of
effective and fair leadership, all ethnic groups are protected and the
national interests encompass the individual and ethnic interests.
However, there are numerous cases where parochial ethnic or personal
interests are in antipathy with national interests; this is one of the
reasons people act as spices against their nations or even ethnic
groups. This is also one of the reasons nations fight civil wars.
America is a living example where regional interests (slavery and others
interests in the South) was against the national interest that included
freedom for all. There was a civil war and you know the outcome. There
are many other examples to tender in this respect.

So one does not have to be a good ethnic chauvinist to be a good citizen
of the nation that harbors the ethnic group if there is harmony and
justice in the ethnic versus national interests. It is a groundless
argument that is based on avariciousness and supremacist ideology, and
lack of respect for a multi-party and diverse society. This fascist
mentality is commonly peddled by ethnic warlords who frequently lack the
appeal, charisma and wherewithal to compete nationally, and so they hide
under the convenience of their ethnic base and expound shallow
ethnic-based sentimentalities to justify their significance and
existence. This is my candid opinion on this matter. Joe Igietseme

Ethnic Chauvinism: Pat Utomi - THE POSTING OF THE MONTH!

3. Why I keep getting cheap shot from people like Chuks Agwunobi that
Igietseme participates in more All-Nigerian groups than strictly Edo
organizations. From Pat Utomi's analysis, my wonderment is eased up
because I have always thought that I should defend Nigeria first before
Edo, the rationale being that Edo will be preserved if Nigeria is
survives as a nation. Is it not meaningless to ignore Nigeria and focus
on Edo but to wake up one day and find out that Nigeria is no more and
the Edo I am focusing on goes with the fall of the nation?  By Professor

Professor Joe Macaca Igietseme

Just look at these quotes below.

&quot;To be a good Nigeria, I have to be a good NGBATI man.

To be a good NGBATI man, I have to be a good IJEBU man.

To be a good a good IJEBU man, I have to be a good IKENNE* man.

To be a good IKENNA man, I have to be a good AWOLOWO son

To be a good AWOLOWO son, I have to be a good OBAFEMI&quot;

Here is another quote.

&quot;I believe in one Nigeria and Pan-Africanism. I have fought against
ethnic and tribalism all my life in Nigeria. My friend Awo, you are been
pugnacious to want to take away the Premiership of Nigeria from Balewa
and the Hausa/Fulani North. The South controls the education, Economy
and Military in Nigeria. What are they the North's to hope for? The
Yoruba's and Igbos cannot control every aspect of Nigeria and leaving a
major tribe like the Hausa/Fulani out of scheme of things. That
prescription for Chaos&quot;

Professor Igietseme who made the famous or infamous first quote?

Why are you ardent supporter of the first man and not the man that made
the second quote who shares your philosophy about Nigeria?

I know you are ardent supporter of the first man who is a tribalist to
the core. Tell us why.

I want you to tell the audience who made these quotes and why you
supported the first and not the second.

Pat Utomi is like a fried Onions who smells good outside and not inside.
He admitted been nomadic. That is how he will be forever. Let him tell
us what he has done for the people of IBUSA? You cannot neglect your
people all these years and ran to them when you want to use them. It is
not going to happen.

I am a tribalist. It is tribalism that saved the lives of OBJ, Abiola
and Diya. They believe in one Nigeria and went against their people
because of that believe. But when Abacha locked them up, it was their
people who fought like a wounded lion for their lives. The Yoruba's
brought Nigeria economy to a standstill because of them. Soyinka,
Akinrinade, Akinyemi and many prominent Yoruba's at home and in Diaspora
forgot these peoples transgression against their people and fought for
the lives of their sons. They threw Nigeria problem to the world stage
with their poisonous Ngbati pen.

OBJ, Abiola and Diya love the Hausa/Fulani North more than the Yoruba's.
They did more for them than the Yoruba's. But the Hausa/Fulani North
never said a damn thing when these Yoruba's were locked up. They only
came out to condemn Abacha when DASUKI was locked up and Yaradua killed.
That is why they condemned Abacha.

During NIDO Chairmanship election, we saw how tribalism played a role.
Bolekaja and MATTO didn't want Igbo man to be the Chairman. Bolekaja
threw all his differences with Dr. Ola away and supported him to rule
for life until Nigerian Legislators draft a Constitute on who will
succeed him. Both Bolekaja and MATO are playing tribalism to keep Dr.
Ola there.

Professor Igietseme, I am a pure tribalist. I am not going to stop now.
I believe in that famous number one quote above. You and Utomi should
continue to be a fried ONIONS that smells good outside but not inside.
Both of you will continue to be nomadic and wanderers. That is why both
of you don't attend EDO or DELTA Associations.

Both of you will never win election in AGENEBODE and IBUSA until you
start to smell good inside before outside. And with this, I rest my
case.

PS:

* Please don't mix up IKENNE with OKENNE. I know you are Geography
challenge. Don't think I misspelled one or the other. Just be careful
not to expose yourself as addicted AGIP man.

Ladiies and Gentlmen:

I consider this article by Pat Utomi the foremost posting of the month
in Nigerian e-goups. Only the mindsets of this caliber and framework
will advance Nigeria. The article sheds some light on some of my
bewildering thoughts about the operations and attitudes of some
Nigerians, even on these e-groups. The following can be better
understood and appreciated from this article:

1. Why ethnic jingoism reigns supreme in several Nigerian e-groups, such
that greater then 90% of the contribution of some people border on
ethnic issues. In the words of Pat Utomi: &quot;Take ethnicity. There is so
much of it around ---------- it is the prism through which some people
see everything.&quot;

2. There was a leadership crisis in NIDO Americas recently that could
have been resolved on its merit, which was that the majority of the
Board members felt there was the need for leadership change. However, it
was amazing how some of us saw ethnic ramifications on the issue such
that supposedly reasonable people like Adey Adenuga could not rationally
and objectively analyze the issues any more if the facts presented did
not support their ethnic baises on the matter. Thank God, All-Nigerians
like IBK and Dele Olawole were around.

3. Why I keep getting cheap shot from people like Chuks Agwunobi that
Igietseme participates in more All-Nigerian groups than strictly Edo
organizations. From Pat Utomi's analysis, my wonderment is eased up
because I have always thought that I should defend Nigeria first before
Edo, the rationale being that Edo will be preserved if Nigeria is
survives as a nation. Is it not meaningless to ignore Nigeria and focus
on Edo but to wake up one day and find out that Nigeria is no more and
the Edo I am focusing on goes with the fall of the nation?

In my opinion, Pat Utomi is right to see a paradox when someone
surprised him by saying that a major challenge to his candidacy for the
office of the President of Nigeria was that he was too Nigerian. Thus,
while some of us would gracefully and contentedly fancy ourselves as
All-Nigerian youngsters, in the American manner of usage, for some
Nigerians, open mindedness meant your ethnic group could not trust you
enough. An amazing counter-intuitive paradox in deed!

According to Pat Utomi, to be regaded as being more Nigerian than ones
ethnic group is definitely a complement, and considering the favorable
and civilized merits of national identity, ethnic chauvinism is clearly
an obstacle to communication that can get in the way of men/women, who
could ordinarily have done much good, from getting their ideas across
and building solidarity Nigeria writ large. Ultimately, it is thrilling
to identify with the veritable belief that Pan-Nigerian outlook and
solidarity would constitute a veritable instrument for nation building
and for defining ones self worth. This is my candid opinion on this
matter. Joe Igietseme

The Futility Of Ethnic Chauvinism
By Pat Utomi

It is amazing how what you think about can define you and hold you
hostage. Take ethnicity. There is so much of it around that unless
something thrusts it to the fore of your consciousness; you forget it is
the prism through which some people see everything. I became sensitive
to my good fortune when a reaction of the ethnic dimension on the
N628milion House of Representative Scandal hit a List Serve (e-group)
that I subscribe to. I probably would have thought little of it all
beyond acknowledging that some held and expressed strong opinion, a
democratic privilege, until someone I know whose views I shared, felt
very strongly about people who made sweeping remarks regarding his
ethnic group, and reacted.

I agreed with him that it was improper to attack his ethnic group
because a principal player in the scandal comes from that ethnic stock
and some chieftains from that geographic group had said the person in
question should be defended

Dear All:

The statement made by Chief Adey below sums up my analysis of his
character and forms the basis for relegating Adey's opinions on issues
to the background. It appears that he is not a serious-minded person in
my candid opinion. Thank God Adey is not in NIDO because he will further
cause unnecessary distractions that we can do without.

When the NIDO crisis came up, I promised to stick with the bare facts
and upon Adey's request, I gave a chronological account of all that
transpired, which have NEVER been refuted. The facts include the
following:

1. As at late May 2007, Dr Kassim assured me in Toronto that he was not
running for a third term as Chairman of NIDO Americas;

2. Few days to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Dallas, TX, Dr Kassim
gave his word to Mr Robert Ngwu, assuring him (Robert) of his support.
He believed Robert had served well as Vice Chairman.

3. Up to the day of the AGM (June 16, 2007), only one person was known
to me and several sitting Board members as a candidate for NIDO
Chairman. That person was Robert Ngwu. So we all assumed that Dr Kassim
was playing the honorable Card as the outgoing Chairman. In fact, there
was no basis to think otherwise because we all respected Kassim for his
dedication and sacrifices in NIDO. Besides, Dr Kassim is an accomplished
Pathologist that I expected would (in my opinion) subbordinate the
political lure of a NIDO post to professional and personal integrity.

4. I only knew of Dr Kassim's candidacy for a third term as NIDO
Chairman about 5PM on June 16, 2007 when he called to urge me to
withdraw my proxy vote that was naturally not for him since I didn't
know that he was running. Kassim had previously received my votes
multiple times for the position of Chairman and I did not see anything
wrong with making his intention know to the voters again if he was still
interested in coming back. This time, I told him no because there was
not compelling reason to do so. I stand on that principle!

The relevant questions that condemned Adey's ethnic-based analysis and
outlook on the issue, including calling other people names (plotters
etc) are as follows:

1. Do you plot a coup de tat against a non-candidate? Unless in the
warped thought process of Chief Adey.

2. Has Adey not confirmed from Dr Kassim that most sitting Board members
did not know that he was running for a third tem until the day of the
AGM?

3. Did Kassim not pledge support to Robert Ngwu for his (Robert's)
candidacy before the AGM?

4. What other facts does Adey need to adjust his outlook as a mature
person if he is not blinded by his ethnic-based chauvanism?

It is really pathetic that this NIDO saga has taught me the bitter
lesson that we all obviously operate in our society with people we
expect a lot from but they are actually the problems in the society.
This is my candid opinion on this matter. Joe Igietseme

====================

I say Amen to the above quote. If Dr. Joe wants to be honest, he
he will realize the import of Chief IBK's observation. The facts
are certainly there for open-minded netters to see. Ehn, Dr. Joe
and his fellow plotters cannot rely on &quot;ethnicity to hoodwink or

Utomi - THE POSTING OF THE MONTH!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Dear All,

&gt; I was not going to comment on this until I saw my name somewhere in
">

the middle of Dr. Valentine Ojo's analysis of Joe Igietseme's piece.
I can relate to Joe and Pat Utomi who is a Surulere boy like me - I
was born on Ogunlana Drive, and I attended Government Demonstration
Primary School, 1, Onitolo Road, Surulere where all Nigerian ethnic
groups mingled as &quot;All-Nigerians&quot; .

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My formative years were in Lagos where we think as Nigerians first,
">

then as ethnic people later but also I can fully empathise with Dr.
Valentine Ojo who fiercely sees the ethnic base as first and the
Nigerian base as secondary. I do not think that these are mutually
exclusive positions especially in the context of nation building.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Please forgive me for digressing. This exchange reminds me of an
">

article I read by Chief. TOS Benson who claimed that his political
outlook and life-long NCNC leanings was because he studied in
cosmopolitan Lagos at CMS Grammar school as opposed to Chief Obafemi
Awolowo's political outlook because he went from Ikenne to Ibadan and
struggled to self educate himself within his immediate ethnic milieu.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Both feelings are strong and real. I see great strengths in ethnic
">

diversity and I see a great future for Nigeria if we make the
experiment work. This debate highlights the deep primordial feelings
and instincts that ethnicity brings out in us all. The fact that the
Kolanut is grown in the west consumed in the North and has its
spiritual home in the East of Nigeria is instructive. we can make
the formation of the Nigerian identity work (or we can destroy it
too).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Likewise moving into ethnic enclaves will not solve all the
">

problems inherent in us as a people but it may even attenuate them
and make them more prominent. The tall and short of my sermon is
that those who believe in the Nigerian experiment are the ones who
will win the future but it is a challenge for us all. a great
challenge to build a country where people will not feel threatened or
oppressed or use ethnicity to hoodwink or cheat their fellow
countrymen.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Look at the ITT Governors - have they spared their own ethnic
">

constituencies when they stole the monies meant to develop these
places and took the money abroad? No! You see ethnic conflict is a
diversion - the real challenge is for us to even stem stealing and
corruption at the local levels. Then the national and international
stature of our country will grow!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The interesting thing here is that those who wax lyrical most about
">

their ethnic chauvinist credentials are the very ones who hold their
villages in contempt and are hardly seen there while the &quot;All-
Nigerians&quot; are the ones who are ready to go to these same villages to
develop them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Let us stop creating conflict out of issues that need not cause or
">

bring conflict. Like I learnt from late Dr. Beko Kuti, let us
continue to work hard for the genuine development of our country in
the way we know how to! In the fullness of time, genuine patriots
will emerge. The yam from Gboko tastes good in Kano and Abeokuta and
the groundnuts from Kano welcomes garri and iced water in Benin,
Umuahia or Lagos.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There are many more things that bind us together than separate us,
">

if only we discover them and dwell on them - instead of endless
wranglings and conflicts over nothing!
