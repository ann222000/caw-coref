I have a great grandfather what was christened in Dorset, in 1865.  I
was trying to find out his particular faction.  How would I get this
information.

I presume you mean a great-grandfather WHO was christened in Dorset.
&quot;What&quot; refers to inanimate objects,  not human beings.

Secondly, I don't quite understand what you mean by &quot;trying to find out
his particular faction&quot;. If you know he was christened in Dorset in 1865,
then presumably you must have some kind of record of that event? In
which case, you should know which church or chapel the baptism took
place.

You don't even give us his name. Please try being a little more precise
and phrase your question in proper English with some more exact
information.

While your advice is well-meant, I suspect it is wasted. See his other
thread to find out that Brown is a troll and a particularly inept and
stupid troll at that.
