I've had an accident - I was rear ended by a vehicle and the Police
has found the other party at fault. Now the other party's insurance
will only fix my car with used parts - this seems totally unfair.

Not only do I have to put up with someone elses mistake, go through
this ordeal, but also my car now depreciates to a greater extent.

Any advice? Do I have the right to tell the insurance party that they
must fix my car with new parts?

Help.

"/> The insurance company should put your car in the same condition that it
was in &quot;before&quot; the accident. If your car is a couple of years old, new parts
should be put in. If older, &quot;used&quot; parts should do as long as it puts your
car in &quot;before&quot; shape.

like sheet metal that doesn't fit and rusts even when there is no snow
and salt, or bumpers that don't bump properly).

"/> Contact your own insurance company for help. (You should have
reported the accident to them anyway, regardless of fault.)

In general(*) you are entitled to the money it will take to restore
the car to the shape it was in before the collision. If that can be
done with used parts, that's legal and appropriate. But the used
parts must not be of lower quality than the parts you had before the
collision.

(*) The exception is when it would cost more than the car was worth
before the accident; when the car is &quot;totaled&quot; in insurance lingo.
But it doesn't sound like that's the case here.

R&gt; Any advice? Do I have the right to tell the insurance party that they
R&gt; must fix my car with new parts?

besides what others said, remember, you don't have even to deal with other party's
insurance co. The damage to your car was caused by the driver, your claim for damages
is to him, and the fact that he has an insurance policy is relevant for him, not for
you. You don't have any direct business with his insurance, and they don't have any
obligations to you.

Technically, you can repair your car as you see fit, and then claim the costs from
another driver, possibly with a lawsuit. On practice, you adjust for his insurance
policies in order to increase the chances of getting the money.

to make sure their car gets fixed. PL/PD (Public Liability/Property

other guy's car, but nothing on your own.

Mine, for example, specifies that my rate will be increased for an
accident that does not fit into one of several categories. One of the
categories is that my insurance company recovers at least 60% of the
claim; this is the company's definition of &quot;not at fault&quot;, which is not
identical to the legal definition. (Other categories include clear
not-at-fault situations, such as damage to your car when it is legally
parked, or when it is hit in the rear unless you were given a moving
violation.)

When be moved here from NY I was asked if we'd had a chargeable
claim in the last year (heel it's the same company, they don't
*know*?). I answered &quot;no&quot;. The &quot;agent&quot; (captive agent) called
back and was rather agitated, since I'd answered &quot;no&quot; (I.e.
&quot;lied&quot;). &quot;You had a $5000 claim on xx/xx/xx&quot;! Not hardly, says
I. Well, they insurance company paid $5K on a silly license-
plate bender two years before and never told us (wife's foot
slipped off the brake and *rolled* into the car stopped in front
- yes it was reported to them within minutes). I told the
&quot;agent&quot; that I was pretty steamed that she'd accuse me of trying
to hide an elephant, so she looked up the details. When she got
back she just laughed and said these things are normal. ...I
still got dinged for a year, when I wouldn't have in NY.

It seems criminal that cosmetic repairs cost more than substantive
repairs. When I was rear-ended by an idiot, the body shop found LOTS of
damage, but the only thing I actually had done was the
frame-straightening, which was under $100. I kept the rest of the money
and ran.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Stan, I'd like to see references to any articles that point to this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;trend. As far as I know, insurers always had a rule that if you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;several (maybe three-four) not-at-fault accidents within a short time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;span, you could see your premiums go up. The idea was that too many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;coincidences stop appearing as coincidences. But I would have very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hard time believing that you could be surcharged for reporting a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not-at-fault accident. The primary reason is that all the rates,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rating categories and surcharges are filed by each insurer with state
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;insurance commissions (at least in most states); and I simply can't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;believe that a surcharge for a single not-at-fault accident could slip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;by the regulators.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree that it doesn't seem equitable. I'm simply going by reports
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've seen in this newsgroup.

&gt;&gt;Sure. Do you really think you see the whole story here though?

&gt;&gt;When be moved here from NY I was asked if we'd had a chargeable
&gt;&gt;claim in the last year (heel it's the same company, they don't
&gt;&gt;*know*?). I answered &quot;no&quot;. The &quot;agent&quot; (captive agent) called
&gt;&gt;back and was rather agitated, since I'd answered &quot;no&quot; (I.e.
&gt;&gt;&quot;lied&quot;). &quot;You had a $5000 claim on xx/xx/xx&quot;! Not hardly, says
&gt;&gt;I. Well, they insurance company paid $5K on a silly license-
&gt;&gt;plate bender two years before and never told us (wife's foot
&gt;&gt;slipped off the brake and *rolled* into the car stopped in front
&gt;&gt;- yes it was reported to them within minutes). I told the
&gt;&gt;&quot;agent&quot; that I was pretty steamed that she'd accuse me of trying
&gt;&gt;to hide an elephant, so she looked up the details. When she got
&gt;&gt;back she just laughed and said these things are normal. ...I
&gt;&gt;still got dinged for a year, when I wouldn't have in NY.

&gt; Keith, in case you didn't notice, we were talking about NOT-at-fault
&gt; accidents. What you've described appears to be a rear-end collision in
&gt; which your wife was at fault.

"/> Understand. Note that there was no damage to either vehicle. I
was not penalized under my NY policy, yet was penalized by moving
across the border. This was an acknowledged (by the officer on
the scene and my insurance company) bogus claim. They never even
told me they paid the claim (yet bitched at me for not
disclosing). I'm not complaining too much about the added
premium (it wasn't that much, maybe $100 for both cars for the
year).

What *pissed* me off is the bitch got away with $5K for
*nothing*. ...and I wasn't even told.

Again, I was not penalized under my NY policy. I was under my VT
policy, two years later.

I would never have known they paid the claim if I hadn't move out
of state during the three-year period. Needless to say, I was
pissed (and not at the additional few bux in premiums).

"/> They did. They knew it was fraud, but it's cheaper to pay $5K
than go to court. Back/neck injury claims are impossible to prove
fraudulent. Juryies tend to side with the poor pitiful plaintiff
and award huge settlements. Look at the $5K as the insurance
companies insurance premium.

Don't feel bad they screw everyone! They are quick to take your money
and slow to pay it out.

Last year I was robbed four times in a month, little strange but true.
After the second theft I installed a hidden camera to find out who
the hell was doing it. During the third theft I caught the criminal
on camera. However, during the fourth theft the camera was not
working correctly and they stole the hidden camera thinking it was a
clock radio.

Even with the criminal caught on tape the insurance company still had
the nerve to state that they believed I stole my own stuff and to deny
the claim.

By the way this was allstate and I will be changing to another
insurance company.

&gt;&gt;I pity the person who doesn't report accidents to their insurance

&gt; In general, I agree.

&gt; But in defense of people who don't report small accidents: more and
&gt; more companies are starting to surcharge your premium if you report
&gt; an accident, even if the other party is at fault and your company
&gt; paid out nothing.

&gt; I still agree with you that it's risky. But it's not totally silly
&gt; as it used to be.

"/> In New Jersey, if you just look in the wrong direction, you run the risk
of being dumped by your auto insurance company. My car was just hit last
week while it was parked and I was in my office working. The driver's
side mirror was smashed completely off the door. Reporting this to my
insurance company would have been pointless. The repair cost me $125,
including a new mirror (electric and heated) and the labor. My
deductable is $1,000 so the insurance company would have just scoffed
that the claim anyway.
