Hi all

Just wondering if anyone has every experienced something similar to what
I am.

I currently feel pretty good, got my diet under control, Im eating well
and I feel strong. I have zero pain.

Yesterday I went for a colonoscopy, and woke up during the procedure. I
was talking to the doc as he ferreted around near my ileum (which was
actually removed several years ago, but you know what I mean). Apparently
the scar tissue has nearly healed over (leaving a 5mm gap) and there are
numerous ulcers (which he biopsied).

Stupid thing is, I have no discomfort whatsoever. Looking at my bowel, I
should be doubled over......

Weird. Anyway, Im going onto Remicade soon, so no doubt the 5mm hole will
heal over and Ill be off to surgery again :\ At least it wont be
emergency, major surgery this time :)

Has anyone ever had a bad crohn's flare and yet felt nothing?

thanks

I've had Crohn's for decades and have had essentially no pain directly from
the inflamed guts. The one or two obstructions I've had did hurt, and the
anal fistulas definitely hurt, but those aside -- no pain.

I've had docs tell me that I must be a pain-tolerant stoic, but I tell them
it's not true. If I'd had any pain, I'd be in their offices lickety-split
demanding pain meds.

One long-time GI doc said that, in his experience, there's no solid
correlation between extent of inflammation and experienced distress. Some
pts with tiny areas of mild inflammation are in agony, while others with
extensive, severe inflammation (like me, before Remicade) don't feel any gut
pain.

Count your blessings.

I think that it really depends on the individual's gut innervation and, in
my experience, severe Crohn's in my colon was Hara Kiri-inducing painful,
whereas Crohn's in my ileum (my current joy) is a walkover (with the correct
diet and medication). However, I was ill for 20-30 years with smouldering
Crohn's and no pain before the mega-flare up in 1992. I did have low level
malaise, which I usually manage to knock on the head by doing lots of sport
and sleeping 8 hours, and very rare bouts of nausea and sickness, but no
other obvious symptoms of Crohn's except (with hindsight) for arthritis in
my knees and uveitis occasionally.

In some respects those with pain are lucky because the doctors are more
likely to find the Crohn's and treat it. Those of us with smouldering
Crohn's don't get treatment soon enough and lose metres of intestine and end
up with SBS (short bowel syndrome) - like, you, Simon and me. I also
understand that you eat very low fibre and this explains why you haven't
been getting any blockage pains.

I am on 50 mg 6-MP for the smouldering Crohn's and will continue it as
maintenance medication for the rest of my life if needs be because I have no
desire to end up on TPN and/or as an organ transplant patient.

My entire small bowel has Crohn's and my GI says he doesn't understand how I
am as healthy as I am and without much pain. I get cramps from time to time
but overall I'm doing alright. Having said that, a doc once told me times
when I feel good, for a healthy person the same feeling would be not be a
feeling of healthy. It is basically what you are accustomed to.

Yes.  Abdominal pain wasn't an issue for me when I was dxed in 2001
and it wasn't till March of 2005 that I got any abdominal pain and
even then it was slight.

I went through a partial obstruction last year and abdominal pain
wasn't an issue.

I have active CD in my small intestine and ascending colon.  I've had
9 cm on small intestine removed in 2001 for CD.

It took about two years to train my current GI into not asking about
abdominal pain so I'm guessing it is a typical symptom.

Take care,

I was in a severe state of pan-colitic flare before I actually owned up
to any pain - pain that probably would have put anyone else on the floor
- even weeks before I was hospitallized, but in my case I'm certain that
I have also probably been in some state of pain for about 20 odd years
and just ignored or learned to tolerate it.  To me it had become &quot;normal&quot;.

I've been trying to re-learn how to perceive and interpret pain...I know
from my limited psych studies that when things creep up on you slowly
you can learn to tolerate discomfort to a much higher degree that if the
pain is dumped on you all at once.  So the question for me has become,
what and how much pain, really?  I think I still get it wrong way more
often than I get it right.

Where my mis-perception really complicates things for me is with
intestinal spasms...I seem to have constant spasms, but I don't really
&quot;know&quot; it until I take something (like Utram) and they stop.  The only
highlight that tips me off is an increase or continuance of my diarrhea.
Then I take something, feel better, and the diarrhea also slows or
stops.  I still think I tolerate the discomfort way longer than I
should...it's a hard habit to break...

But I also think that as others have pointed out, it can depend on other
things - like aftermath of any surgeries or scarring.  I'm now worried
about the effects of scarring in my gut after what happened last year.

IF high histamine (histadelia) is related to inflammatory problems, it
also makes one somewhat 'immune' to pain.

Have your Histamine level been checked?

Interesting, I'd never heard that...might that be brought on in
conjunction to an allergy?  I have some grass allergies.

I've always been surrounded by people that tend to disregard or belittle
pain, though.  So I'm pretty sure that most of my issue is perceptual. I
know that when I was first given Ultram in the hospital and was really
pain free for periods I panicked - because it didn't feel &quot;normal&quot; to
me.  I sometimes have a sensation in my side that feels like cool
running water...the docs don't know what to make of what I say about
that, but I've come to the conclusion that it's probably what it feels
like to NOT be in pain...

I always know when pain is gone, after the fact.  I think I'm just not
in the habit of paying much attention when it's there.  I'm getting
better at listening, though.

Me and my Mum both have Crohn's, and we've both experienced that when
we bleed (blood in the stools or just pure blood coming out) we don't
have pain. Otherwise, we're in pain. So only when we bleed we're not
in pain, which is weird lol! Although, going along the ileum thing, we
both have ileum disease (which is the most progressed area in both of
us) so maybe the bleeding comes from there. I'm just relating this to
other people saying their ileum doesn't cause a lot of pain....
