My client acquired a 50% interest in an LLC which is in the
cattle business.

Previously this client had a horse-raising business. This
year he had a lot of horse-related expenses but no income.
When I inquired, I was told that he had not bought or sold
any horses this year and was now using them to round up and
heard the cattle.

My question is: Could he discontinue reporting them on
Schedule F and show them as Unreimbursed Partnership Expense
(UPE) for the LLC?
