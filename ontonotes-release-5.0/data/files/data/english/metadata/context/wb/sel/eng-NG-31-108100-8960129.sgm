***Led by The Chief Child-Hater George Bush, the pathetically evil
Republicans have once again shown the American people the depth and
breadth of their sociopathic ways.  It's rather obvious they care more
about people smoking at a cheaper price than the lives of thousands of
children.  What a bunch of sick bastards in that dumbass party!

***This same bunch of wacko weirdos who defend their anti-abortion
stance to the death apparently think it's not okay to kill a child in
the womb but it IS okay to let them die of a disease after they're
born.  Convoluted insanity at best = the Con-Kooks.

***The House of Representatives failed October 18 to override
President Bush's veto to expand a popular government health insurance
program to cover 10 million children. The bill had bipartisan support
but the 273-156 roll call was 13 votes short of the two-thirds
majority supporters needed to enact the bill into law despite Bush's
objections.

***The State Children's Health Insurance Program now subsidizes health
care insurance coverage for about 6 million children at a cost of
about $5 billion a year. The vetoed bill would have added 4 million
more children, most of them from low-income families, to the program
at an added cost of $7 billion annually. To pay for the increase, the
bill would have raised the federal tax on cigarettes from 39 cents to
$1.00 a pack.

***&quot;This is not about an issue. It's about a value,&quot; House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said just before the vote. &quot;For the cost of
less than 40 days in Iraq, we can provide SCHIP coverage for 10
million children for one year.&quot;

(But I guess 40 days of continued warmongering by the White House
psychos is far more important than the lives of young children being
saved from disease and death.)

***Said White House press secretary Dana Perino: &quot;We won this round on
SCHIP.&quot; Noting a million-dollar lobbying campaign by several labor
unions and advocacy groups that aimed to turn enough Republican votes
for a successful override, she said: &quot;It didn't work.&quot;

(You didn't win shit Dana except a face full of egg and the disdain of
any normal Anerican with a conscience...something obviously missing in
your makeup.)

***The bill specifically states that illegal immigrants would remain
ineligible for the children's program, but Republicans seized on a
section that would allow families to provide a Social Security number
to indicate eligibility. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said it's too easy
to get a false number, which would give an opening for thousands of
illegal immigrants to enroll.

(So, Barton, you moron, you and the other ignorant Con-Kooks should
focus your attack on the problem of the Social Security number issue
insteading of taking the lazy approach and attacking the helpless
children in a backdoor ploy.  Gawd, it's sooo difficult to believe
that a political party like the Republicans can be such total,
mindless idiotic fools in their thinking.)

But you and the rest of your hypocritical, child-hating ilk will pay

number of low-income,
uninsured children, and annual wages in the state’s health care industry
is used to determine

money from states that
don’t use their full allotments to states that do use all of their
allotments and need extra SCHIP
funds.

What Is SCHIP?
The State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was enacted by
Congress in 1997 to
increase health insurance coverage for low-income children. At the time,
more than 10 million
children lacked health insurance. About 7 million of them lived in
families with incomes below
twice the federal poverty level (today, that would be $34,340 for a
family of three).
1
Although
75 percent of those uninsured children lived in a family with at least
one parent who worked
full-time, and 90 percent had a parent who worked either full or part-time,
2
their families either
were not offered job-based health insurance or could not afford to buy
the insurance that was
offered.
3
The SCHIP program gave states a total of $40 billion over 10 years to
provide health coverage
for these children, who lived in families that earned too much to
qualify for Medicaid, but not
enough to afford private insurance.
Is SCHIP the Same in Every State?
No. The federal SCHIP law allows states to choose from three options:
Increase the current income limits so more children become eligible for
Medicaid;
Develop a new, separate health insurance program that may have different
rules and
benefits from Medicaid; or
Do a combination of the two.
Currently, 9 states and the District of Columbia operate Medicaid
expansions,18 states operate
separate SCHIP programs, and 23 states operate combination programs.
4
Who Qualifies for SCHIP?
Most states provide coverage for uninsured children with family incomes
up to two times the
federal poverty level. However, a few states have set higher income
limits, and a few states have
lower income limits. New Jersey’s SCHIP program, for example, covers
uninsured children with
family incomes up to 350 percent of the federal poverty level (an annual
income of $60,095, for a family of three in 2007). North Dakota and
Montana cover uninsured children with family incomes
up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level (an annual income of
$25,755 for a family of three
in 2006).
How Is SCHIP Financed?
Congress allotted a total of $40 billion over 10 years for SCHIP,
starting in fiscal year 1998. A
complex formula that includes the number of low-income children, the
number of low-income,
uninsured children, and annual wages in the state’s health care industry
is used to determine
each state’s annual allotment. States have three years to use their
allotments from any single
fiscal year. There is also a mechanism for reallocating unspent SCHIP
money from states that
don’t use their full allotments to states that do use all of their
allotments and need extra SCHIP
funds.
Like the Medicaid program, SCHIP is a federal-state partnership in which
the federal government
pays a significant share of the costs—about 72 percent on average.
5
The federal “matching rate”
varies by state based on a state’s per capita income and is updated
annually. In 2007, SCHIP
matching rates ranged from 65 percent to 83 percent.
Unlike Medicaid, however, SCHIP is a block grant. This means that the
federal government
has set aside a finite amount of money for the program, and it is
possible to use up all the federal
SCHIP money. In fact, in 2007, 14 states exhausted their federal SCHIP
funds and experienced
shortfalls that jeopardized coverage for thousands of children.
6
In May 2007, Congress approved
supplemental payments of $650 million to fill the federal funding gaps
for these states.

SCHIP 101: What is It and How Does It Work?
– 3 –
Ensuring that federal SCHIP funds are targeted when and where they are
needed most to
maximize the number of children who are covered has proven problematic
over the years.
Because of the peculiar way in which SCHIP funds were appropriated,
there was too much
money in the system in the early years of the program and too little in
later years. Perhaps
the most important discussion related to reauthorizing SCHIP will
address how much federal
money will be devoted to children’s health coverage after 2007.
Are Eligible Children Getting Enrolled?
States and private groups have done extensive outreach to inform
low-income families about
SCHIP. States have also generally made it easy for children to enroll.
As a result, enrollment in the
program increased steadily from year to year. Now, SCHIP is providing
coverage to a significant
number of children—6.6 million children in 2006.
7
SCHIP, together with Medicaid, has served a vitally important role for
children: Between 1998
and 2005, the number of uninsured children dropped by more than 2.7
million (Figure 2).
8
This
is remarkable in light of the growth in child poverty and a significant
decline in the number of
children whose families have job-based health insurance.Experts agree
that expanded coverage
for children through SCHIP and Medicaid is responsible for this good news.

Does SCHIP Improve Health and Access to Care?
SCHIP is vital to improving children’s health care. Children enrolled in
SCHIP or Medicaid are
three times more likely to have a usual source of care than are
uninsured children.
10
And children
enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid are one-and-a-half times more likely than
uninsured children
to receive well-child care, see a doctor during the year, and get dental
care. SCHIP reduces the
percent of children with an unmet health care need.
11
Clearly, SCHIP and Medicaid are critical
programs that allow otherwise uninsured children to get the health
services they need.
Conclusion
Reauthorizing the SCHIP program will be one of the more important tasks
before Congress in
2007. Together, SCHIP and Medicaid have significantly expanded
children’s health coverage
and improved the health care they receive. Reauthorization offers
Congress the opportunity to
strengthen and build on the success of these important health coverage
programs for children.

apologize, the good congressman has duly considered the Speaker’s rebuke
from Friday and … apologized.

“I want to apologize to my colleagues, many of whom I have
offended,” Stark began. He then apologized to “the president and his
family” and “the troops.”

“I hope that with this apology, I return to being as insignificant
as I should be,” he concluded though a voice cracking with emotion.

Standby for some pretty vicious rants and important actions alerts from
the left, which will be outraged at such a cowardly, gutless
capitulation to decency. Here’s the video of Stark’s comments from last
week. I’ll update with the video of today’s apology once it becomes
available.

&quot;Awesome. Boehner introduced a censure resolution this morning knowing
that the Democrats would have to kill it and symbolically line up on
Stark’s side, which they did. That was enough for Pelosi, evidently:

A democrat smear campaign backfired big time this week. Last week, 41 US
Senate democrats led by spineless Harry Reid tried to smear conservative
radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh by taking what he said out of context.

The letter was sent to Clear Channel Radio’s president Mark P Mays, in
an attempt to strong-arm Rush off the air.

This week, Rush took the original letter and placed it on the on-line
auction web site, eBay. As of this writing, the letter has received 118
bids with the highest being over 48 thousand dollars! The auction is
scheduled to end October 19, 2007. Here is part of the auction’s
description from eBay:

“Up for auction is the original letter signed by 41 Democrat senators.
This historic document may well represent the first time in the history
of America that this large a group of U.S. senators attempted to
demonize a private citizen by lying about his views. As such, it is a
priceless memento of the folly of Harry Reid and his 40 senatorial
co-signers.
Update 10/20/2007

The smear letter sold on eBay for 2.1 Million dollars! Will each
democrat match it per Rush’s challenge to really support the troops?
Sadly, no. The democrats do not support the troops or our country.

The entire proceeds of this auction.. the entire high bid… will be
donated to The Marine Corps - Law Enforcement Foundation, a registered
charity which provides financial assistance to the children of fallen
Marines and federal law enforcement officers. Rush Limbaugh serves on
the Board of this organization and has been active on its behalf. All
costs of this auction will be paid by the seller… every dollar of your
winning bid will go to this charity, which has to date distributed over
$29 million.”

The winning bid receives:

- The original and infamous “Harry Reid Smear” letter, signed by 41
Democrat senators
- The Halliburton briefcase in which this letter is secured 24 hours a day
- A personal letter of thanks from the Man Who Runs America, Rush Limbaugh
- A photograph of Rush displaying the letter on stage in Philadelphia on
October 11th

Rush also challenged the 41 democrats to put their own money where their
big mouths are and truly support the troops. He challenged them to each
match the winning bid and donate it to The Marine Corps - Law
Enforcement Foundation.

Democrats get their noses rubbed in their own mess and are publicly
humiliated again. Patriots signed the Declaration of Independence. With
the smear letter, the democrats signed their Declaration of Ignorance:
Daniel Akaka    Max Baucus      Joseph Biden    Barbara Boxer
Sherrod Brown   Robert Byrd     Benjamin Cardin         Tom Carper
Bob Casey       Hillary Clinton         Kent Conrad     Christopher Dodd

On Bill Moyers' terrific PBS report on Friday about the secret deal,
author John R. MacArthur says the motivations for the triangulation on
trade are obvious. &quot;This is like the NAFTA campaign of the '90s, an
attempt by the Democratic leadership - in those days it was the Clintons
- to raise money from Wall Street.&quot; You can watch Bill Moyers' entire
piece on the secret deal here.

This drive to triangulate on trade has now reached a point where the
handful of Democrats who made the deal are publicly attacking those
rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers, labor, environmental, health, human
rights, religious, consumer protection and agricultural groups raising
questions about the deal. On Friday, Reuters reported that Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Charlie Rangel (D-NY) &quot;offered no apology&quot; for
negotiating the deal in secret or for continuing to conceal the
legislative text of the deal. Instead, he went on the attack, saying the
only thing he would do differently would be to &quot;ignore a lot of people
that really were just wasting my time.&quot; He claimed innocently that &quot;I
cannot see how anybody would be upset&quot; by the deal, even though as
Public Citizen shows today, the list of reforms to current trade
policies that fair trade groups forwarded to Democratic leaders many
months ago was almost entirely brushed aside by Rangel, as were
proposals for a whole new framework for global trade deals.

TRIANGULATION STRATEGY: The dynamics set up a situation whereby the
Democratic congressional leadership and less than half of all Democratic
lawmakers (as during NAFTA) join with all Republicans to ram a free
trade package through Congress over the objections of the progressive
movement and rank-and-file Democrats who ran against lobbyist-written
trade policies in 2006.

&gt; Rush Limbaugh vs. Harry Reid: Reid Loses, Rush, US Troops Win By John
&gt; W. Turner Oct 20, 2007

&gt; Harry Reid and forty of the most fervently anti-American Democrats in
&gt; the history of the U.S. Senate tried their level best to embarrass
&gt; conservative talk show icon Rush Limbaugh, while simultaneously
&gt; promoting themselves as guardian angels charged with protecting U.S.
&gt; troops. Democrats actually working on behalf of American troops?
&gt; Absurd! Rush Limbaugh vs. Harry Reid: Reid Loses, Rush, US Troops Win

&gt; Remember that just last summer, Harry Reid declared the war in Iraq
&gt; &quot;lost.&quot; Why in the world would a patriotic, intelligent leader who
&gt; really gives a damn about U.S. troops concede defeat with 160,000
&gt; courageous Americans troops still on the ground and in harm's way?
&gt; Where is your concern for the young American men and women who
&gt; literally face death every day in Iraq, Senator Reid? How do you
&gt; suppose your reckless remarks impacted those courageous troops 8,000
&gt; miles from home?

&gt; ***

&gt; Clearly, Reid's &quot;war is lost&quot; rant was programmed to discredit
&gt; President Bush and the surge. And troop morale be damned!
&gt; Undercutting troop morale during time of war should have lead to the
&gt; immediate arrest of Reid for treason and banishment of the traitor to
&gt; a dingy cell in Guantanamo Bay. A special election in Nevada should
&gt; have been called to replace the unhinged leftist once a Republican
&gt; who could win was found and vetted.

&gt; But with Democrats in charge, U.S. troops are little more than
&gt; political pawns with which to embarrass the Bush administration and
&gt; to pacify anti-war activists on the far left. Which brings us to the
&gt; latest fiasco from Reid and crew.

&gt; ***

&gt; Desperate to shed their growing image as anti-war zealots on the
&gt; heels of their outrageous partisan assaults on General Petreaus,
&gt; Democrats decided to remake themselves as patriotic warriors on a
&gt; mission to defend U.S. troops. In order to achieve their mission,
&gt; Reid and company found it necessary to lie about and misrepresent the
&gt; most pro-troop figure in the history of the American media: The
&gt; honorable and ever patriotic Rush Limbaugh.

&gt; Thus, 40 senate Democrats joined Reid in signing a letter to Clear
&gt; Channel Communication, Inc., expressing an idiotic complaint about
&gt; excessive use of free speech by Rush Limbaugh.

&gt; The Democrat missive boils down to a fundamental idea central to the
&gt; new fascism that is the Democrat majority. Namely, liberals are all
&gt; for free speech, except when it comes to conservatives. However, in a
&gt; delicious twist of irony, Rush Limbaugh has turned the tables on
&gt; Democrats by auctioning off the original letter on eBay.

&gt; ***

&gt; The Reid letter sold for a record $2.1 million. And Rush Limbaugh
&gt; will match that amount with funds from his own pocket.

&gt; Thus, over $4 million will go to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement
&gt; Foundation, which provides scholarships to children of Marines or
&gt; federal law enforcement personnel who were killed while serving their
&gt; country.

&gt; Perhaps those 41 Democrats should pass the hat among theyselves and
&gt; match Rush's $4 million with funds from their own pockets?
