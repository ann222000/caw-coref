There is a lot of talk (and some action) from various states moving up their
primaries to get more clout in the presidential election.  Iowa may hold one
as early as December 2007.  Apparently there is an Iowa state law that they
must hold their caucuses before any other state has a primary (apparently
watching corn grow is not exciting enough for them).  What would happen if
another state passed a law saying that that state must hold it's primary
first.  Or maybe a law saying they must hold their primary one week before
the Iowa caucuses?  How would this be reconciled?

Well, the parties could theoretically refuse to seat the state's
delegates.  As it is, the Democrats do have a penalty for going before
Iowa and New Hampshire.  Also, the candidates could refuse to campaign
in states which jumped the queue like that.

Presidential primaries are different from regular primaries.  The
point of them is to choose convention delegates... but the job of
convention delegate is not an actual political office.  And in fact,
all that really happens when you vote is that delegate slots are
allocated amongst various Presidential candidates.... the highest
finishers in a given state get to nominate supporters to serve as
delegates based on that allocation.  But, strictly speaking it is the
national parties who decide who gets to be a delegate. There is little
to stop them from arbitrarily replacing delegates... aside from the
desire to appear to be democratic.

The states involved would change their primary dates, first one and then
the other, until one state gives up.

There is no reason to &quot;reconcile&quot; it. Each state has its own legal system
and any such ridiculous laws are merely meant to intimidate other states.
These laws have no legal binding on other states, nor do they impose any
penalties against any individuals within their own states.

The parties are entirely free to ignore a state's primary election and
seat their delegates based on caucuses or conventions instead.

This isn't theoretical, the Democrats have *never* recognized the
Washington State Presidential Primary, they always use caucus results.
The Republicans allocate a small fraction of their Washington delegation
based on election results, and the rest on caucuses.
