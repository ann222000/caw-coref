Is it physically not possible to mount larger size sensor in a P&amp;S
camera?  I notice that the larger the sensor size, the camera is
getting bigger and becoming closer to DSLR (G7, S5IS, FZ50, etc). Is
the sensor mounted a certain distance from the lens? Therefore larger
sensor means larger lens and larger distance between the two.
Will they ever built a P&amp;S camera with sensor used in DSLR ( 23x15mm,
28x18mm or even full size 35mm film size 36x24mm)?

It isn't the body that's the problem. It is the lens. The bigger the sensor
the bigger the lens for the same zoom range. Most small P&amp;S cameras wouldn't
be very comfortable or pocketable if the body was 3x4 inches and the lens
was the size of a soda can.

However I see no reason they can't do an a dSLR sized camera with a
non-removable 28 to 135 lens. Yes, it would be the size of a dSLR with that
size lens, but I don't see a problem with that. As far as I am concerned
changable lenses are highly over rated.

Olympus offers a middle ground. Their lenses are not cheaper though and
the image quality is not that much better than P&amp;S. One thing is the
larger sensor itself costs a lot more money because the benefit of
minaturization is you can use tiny inexpensive pieces of silicon chips &amp;
the size/cost effect on silicon is exponential. You can use tiny lenses
too. Above a certain size it just makes sense to allow interchangeable
lenses.

Larger formats have shallower depth of field and need longer exposure
times with a tripod like the old Ansel Adams large format gear and the
long telephoto lenses become exponentially more expensive at those
formats. It's almost unheard-of to do long telephoto action photography
with larger formats but around 35mm works out pretty well as long as you
aren't doing huge prints. If you need huge prints, stitch panoramas or
pay 10's of thousands for digitals at that size or simply use film.

Very wide angle lenses are difficult to design, particularly for smaller
sensors so again 35mm is a a good compromise.

I think there is one high-end large sensor digital with a large sensor
and fixed lens but it's expensive and very limited zoom, maybe just
fixed focal length. And I think it's a rangefinder meaning no
through-the lens framing.

I believe noise is a problem which increases in proportion to the size of
the sensor.

Not the size of but the lack of size. a large sensor of 23 x 15 mm with 10
MP will not produce as much noise as a 6 x 4 mm 10 mp sensor used on the

It didn't, it used 1/1.8 which is larger than 2/3, and about 6 x 8mm in

The Sony R-1 and the Sigma whateveritiscalled compact use 1.7X factor

Don't know about the earlier 7, I never owned one, but my A2
used a 2/3&quot; sensor which is about 6.6x8.8mm.

A 1/1.8&quot; sensor is smaller, about 5.3x7.2mm.

It's the other way around, which is really what the OP
is (and others) are complaining and wondering about.

Specifically: why are the &quot;larger&quot; (15x23 mm) sensors
only found in SLR bodies?

I believe there's a market for a decent P&amp;S with a
&quot;large&quot; sensor.  I understand it would cost a bit more.

But it has to be reasonably light and compact, for
my purposes, anyway.

Sorry - my error. Still remembering the original fuss which Minolta made
about the 1/1.8 inch sensor and how it was larger than the standard used
by digicams - which of course was 1/2 not 2/3 at the time. This was like
a mantra from Minolta marketing.

But it was, of course, for the Dimage 5 not the 7 series - over which no
similar PR activity took place (they didn't sit you down in a room and
show a Powerpoint presentation all about the benefits of the 1/1.8 inch
sensor - or for that matter 2/3).

5 and 7 - same lens module, sensor size changed the field of view from
an effective 35-250mm with the 5 to 28-200mm with the 7. The 5 didn't
seem to last long at all on the market.

I did write after the A2 was launched about the 2/3 sensor (have not
been unaware of it - just forgotten) and the true coverage of the GT
zoom lens, which Minolta called 28-200mm. That only applies if you crop
the 4:3 aspect ratio of the 2/3 sensor down to a 3:2 frame (35mm
equivalent). If you make a US letter paper sized print crop, you would
need a 24/25mm lens on a 35mm camera to match the angle. They could,
just as reasonably, have called the lens a 25-180mm.

While the sensor is 6.6 x 8.8mm, does anyone know the active pixel area?
I used the active area of 35mm film (22.5 x 34.5mm, standard GePe slide
mount and standard masking neg carrier) but the full area of the sensor
when considering this.

Only by deduction. The normal camera crop is 3264x2448
pixels, the maximum available is 3272 x 2456.

The numbers come from A2 raw files as reported by the

Silkypix is pretty good at leaving only minimal unused pixels. The crop

Silkypix by default honours whatever crop the maker puts in
the metadata, so it depends on the camera. All can be
overridden of course.

Of the cameras I've used most the &quot;lost&quot; pixel count is
trivial with the A2 and Pentax DS, moderately large with the
Panasonic LX1, and pretty damned big with the Olympus E-1.
Only the LX1 seems to get odd edge effects if I choose to
use the whole sensor so I never bother. The E-1 on the other
hand gains a significant collection of &quot;free&quot; pixels - and
it needs all the extra pixels I can find ;-)

&gt;&gt; Olympus offers a middle ground. Their lenses are not cheaper though and
&gt;&gt; the image quality is not that much better than P&amp;S. One thing is the
&gt;&gt; larger sensor itself costs a lot more money because the benefit of
&gt;&gt; minaturization is you can use tiny inexpensive pieces of silicon chips &amp;
&gt;&gt; the size/cost effect on silicon is exponential. You can use tiny lenses
&gt;&gt; too. Above a certain size it just makes sense to allow interchangeable
&gt;&gt; lenses.

&gt;&gt; Larger formats have shallower depth of field and need longer exposure
&gt;&gt; times with a tripod like the old Ansel Adams large format gear and the
&gt;&gt; long telephoto lenses become exponentially more expensive at those
&gt;&gt; formats. It's almost unheard-of to do long telephoto action photography
&gt;&gt; with larger formats but around 35mm works out pretty well as long as you
&gt;&gt; aren't doing huge prints. If you need huge prints, stitch panoramas or
&gt;&gt; pay 10's of thousands for digitals at that size or simply use film.

&gt;&gt; Very wide angle lenses are difficult to design, particularly for smaller
&gt;&gt; sensors so again 35mm is a a good compromise.

&gt;&gt; I think there is one high-end large sensor digital with a large sensor
&gt;&gt; and fixed lens but it's expensive and very limited zoom, maybe just
&gt;&gt; fixed focal length. And I think it's a rangefinder meaning no
&gt;&gt; through-the lens framing.

Inversely.
Given a fixed pixel number, the smaller the sensor, the higher the noise
level.  However, there is nothing to say this will not allow

No, improvements to sensor technology and fabrication will not change

Sure there is, the other real limit is the size of the P&amp;S camera. You

As cost of sensors drops (when the number of pixels stabilizes), this
should become less of a problem.  Add that to the new Kodak panchromatic
sensor, and the new CMOS sensor in it's newest low cost camera, and you

Still a long way to go from 1/1.5&quot; to APS-C.

1/1.5&quot; is 2/3&quot;, which is 8.8x6.6mm, less than half the size of APS-C

Yep.  But I wanted to keep the hypothetical prediction for a new
model reasonable.  Even going to 1/1.5&quot; within a year isn't too
likely, although that size has been used before.  Isn't that the
size of your C-8080's sensor?  The 1/1.5&quot; (or 2/3&quot;) sensor is
actually even a bit smaller than 1/2 the size of the 4/3&quot; sensor, at
18mmx13.5mm, but that's not a bad size for a small P&amp;S.

I had the choice of predicting the selection of a sensor whose
probability of being used by Fuji would be either slim or none.  It
seemed more reasonable to go with slim.  :)

Ron,

We already had bigger sensors in, for example, the Nikon 8800.

http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikoncp8800/

That has a 350mm maximum zoom (at f/4.9) and a 2/3-inch sensor.  116 x 85
x 121 mm and 680g.

Two similar generation (to the Nikon) cameras with a 1/2.5-inch sensor:

http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicfz5/
http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Panasonic/panasonic_dmcfz20.asp

Panasonic FZ5: 108 x 68.4 x 84.8mm, 326g

Panasonic FZ20:  87 x 128 x 106 mm, 556g

Today, with a 10:1 zoom in a compact format, we have the Panasonic TZ3:

http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonictz3/

Panasonic TZ3: 105 x 59.2 x 36.7 mm, 232g

So you could be right that for the ZLR cameras (bigger non-SLR cameras)
there could be room for some sensor size growth, I'm not so sure at the
compact end, though.

Cheers,
David

We used to have a rule of thumb in parametric studies of camera
systems.  If we were lazy, we figured volume and weight of a camera
system went as cube of format dimension. The actual factor was an
exponent somewhere between 2.5 and 3- I think it was about 2.8, but
don't have my notes on that any more (that was in 70s).  That was with
same field of view and f/#.

There is a wide zoom camera with a 2/3rds sensor out there.  Samsung's
815.  It is the size of a medium sized DSLR and it has a 15x zoom.
IMO, zooms past 250-300mm equivalents are worthless for P&amp;S owners and
probably don't net any additional detail in the images.  If they
limited the zoom ranges from 28mm to 250mm  (10x) equivalents, the use
of a decent sensor would be possible, and the lens wouldn't be dog-
slow at the long end.  This could, &quot;could&quot; be a potential rival to
basic or even mid-level DSLRs, but a better implementation than
Samsung's camera would be needed.

They should (for image quality sake) limit the pixel count to around
7 which would put it's capabilities alongside those of the Olympus
C-8080 and Nikon 8800, combined with the improved processing and speed
of the new engines.  Additionally, the LCDs now are much better, livev-
view with zoom capabilities to refine focus.  Without the mirror lock
up of the DSLRs, the lag-time would be reduced when using this.
Lastly, a zoomable, non-through the lens optical viewfinder could be
produced.  Obviously, this would not be cheap, nor should it be.  This
could be a good niche camera, but for the disgusting &quot;pixel counts at
all costs&quot; marketing efforts of the major players.  For the sensor,
consider something like a normal Nikon or Canon 1.5 sensor, punched
out to 14 megapixels then literally cut in half.  Acceptable noise
control to around 400-800 ISO combined with a reasonable pixel
count.

The Sigma DP1 is an interesting camera, though the Foveon sensor
certainly hasn't been very good in terms of noise or color accuracy. I
love the 28mm lens!

Yes, you need a bigger lens with a bigger sensor, but in reality neither
cost enough to justify the high price of the DP-1. It's still less than
5 megapixels too, despite the pixel-speak gibberish of Sigma. I'd take
the Canon G7 over the DP-1. Of course this assumes that the DP-1
actually ever is launched, which is unlikely. Look at the short-lived
Polaroid x530, a 1.5 megapixel camera with a Foveon sensor that quickly
dropped in price to less than $100. It was also recalled.

It's more what the market will bear than the actual cost of producing
the product. As is the case with most consumer products.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; physical lens size.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; David

&gt;&gt;&gt; Surely the lens will need to be smaller, but then that IS one
&gt;&gt;&gt; limitation of the smaller camera size.  But I am pretty sure that
&gt;&gt;&gt; sensors larger than the current size are possible for a compact P&amp;S
&gt;&gt;&gt; camera.  Look at what Polaroid did with the lens shape to make it
&gt;&gt;&gt; possible to shrink their instant picture cameras.

&gt;&gt; Ron,

&gt;&gt; We already had bigger sensors in, for example, the Nikon 8800.

&gt;&gt; http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikoncp8800/

&gt;&gt; That has a 350mm maximum zoom (at f/4.9) and a 2/3-inch sensor.  116
&gt;&gt; x 85 x 121 mm and 680g.

&gt;&gt; Two similar generation (to the Nikon) cameras with a 1/2.5-inch
&gt;&gt; sensor:

&gt;&gt; http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicfz5/
&gt;&gt; http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Panasonic/panasonic_dmcfz20.asp

&gt;&gt; Panasonic FZ5: 108 x 68.4 x 84.8mm, 326g

&gt;&gt; Panasonic FZ20:  87 x 128 x 106 mm, 556g

&gt;&gt; Today, with a 10:1 zoom in a compact format, we have the Panasonic
&gt;&gt; TZ3:

&gt;&gt; http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonictz3/

&gt;&gt; Panasonic TZ3: 105 x 59.2 x 36.7 mm, 232g

&gt;&gt; So you could be right that for the ZLR cameras (bigger non-SLR
&gt;&gt; cameras) there could be room for some sensor size growth, I'm not so
&gt;&gt; sure at the compact end, though.

&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt; David

&gt; There is a wide zoom camera with a 2/3rds sensor out there.  Samsung's
&gt; 815.  It is the size of a medium sized DSLR and it has a 15x zoom.
&gt; IMO, zooms past 250-300mm equivalents are worthless for P&amp;S owners and
&gt; probably don't net any additional detail in the images.  If they
&gt; limited the zoom ranges from 28mm to 250mm  (10x) equivalents, the use
&gt; of a decent sensor would be possible, and the lens wouldn't be dog-
&gt; slow at the long end.  This could, &quot;could&quot; be a potential rival to
&gt; basic or even mid-level DSLRs, but a better implementation than
&gt; Samsung's camera would be needed.

&gt;  They should (for image quality sake) limit the pixel count to around
&gt; 7 which would put it's capabilities alongside those of the Olympus
&gt; C-8080 and Nikon 8800, combined with the improved processing and speed
&gt; of the new engines.  Additionally, the LCDs now are much better,
&gt; livev- view with zoom capabilities to refine focus.  Without the
&gt; mirror lock up of the DSLRs, the lag-time would be reduced when using
&gt; this. Lastly, a zoomable, non-through the lens optical viewfinder
&gt; could be produced.  Obviously, this would not be cheap, nor should it
&gt; be.  This could be a good niche camera, but for the disgusting &quot;pixel
&gt; counts at all costs&quot; marketing efforts of the major players.  For the
&gt; sensor, consider something like a normal Nikon or Canon 1.5 sensor,
&gt; punched out to 14 megapixels then literally cut in half.  Acceptable
&gt; noise control to around 400-800 ISO combined with a reasonable pixel
&gt; count.
">

The Samsung 815 is even bigger and heavier than the Nikon 8800, and yet it
lacks image stabilisation.  To keep the noise down, you probably want to
stay at ISO 100 - 200 with that sensor size, and so you really need image
stabilisation for the 420mm end of the zoom.

You certainly do get extra detail past 250mm with the Leica lenses on the
Panasonic range - I recently compared Panasonic FZ20 (5MP) at 432mm with
Nikon D40 (6MP) at 300mm (i.e. 200mm lens).  More detail on the Panasonic.
Test it and try for yourself.

I'm unsure whether limiting the zoom range as such is the image quality
control factor - it may, for example, be just as easy to get good quality
from a 12:1, 36 - 432mm (eq) zoom as from an 8:1, 28 - 224mm zoom.  Having
to cope with the wider wide-angle end (28mm eq) may be a more difficult
thing to do in the design.

I think that, for image noise at a particular ISO, the larger sensor in
the DSLR would win.  Whether a particular photographer prefers 28 - 224 or
36 - 432 would depend partially on their particular interests.

Yes, something less than 10MP is probably a better compromise - I'd put it
even lower in the 5 - 6MP range.  Why is the 2/3-inch sensor dead now?
With low-cost DSLRs and 18 - 200mm lenses available, if you need more than
a compact camera offers, the DSLR is a tempting choice, unless size and
weight, or working in a very dusty environment are important constraints.
May be they will even get movie modes and swivel LCDs some day!

Cheers,
David

the first all-in-one digital camera to utilize a large (APS size)

This means that there's no mirror box or prism making the camera more

a 24 - 120 mm (equivalent) five times zoom with a maximum aperture of

Oh, my mistake.  I didn't realize that Fuji's cameras had lenses
too.  Neat trick, making them optional in a non-DSLR.  Or have you
not yet figured out what aniramca's original question really asked?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Let's see now what the sensor sizes are used by these cameras.
Canon's G7 == 1/1.8&quot;
Canon's S5 IS == 1/2.5&quot;
Panasonic's FZ-50 == 1/1.8&quot;

Now how about Fuji's much smaller cameras?
Fuji's F30 == 1/1.7&quot;  (oops, that's the largest sensor so far)
Fuji's F31fd == 1/1.7&quot;
Fuji's F40fd == 1/1.6&quot; (larger still)

There's also Fuji's larger S6000fd which has a 1/1.7&quot; sensor.

So here we have three cameras with larger sensors than those three
mentioned by aniramca, yet they're considerably smaller.  He/she
said nothing about the lens's zoom range, but which is certainly
greater than that of these three Fuji cameras.  So how about Fuji's
S6000fd?  It is obviously is affected by your &quot;economic limit&quot; since
it has not only a larger sensor than any of aniramca's listed
cameras, it also has the wide range zoom lens (28-300mm) that you
added as your own unstated stipulation.  Is it prohibitively
expensive?  No.  It goes for about $300 ($325 from B&amp;H).  Stocks are
running low though.  Get one while you can.

Again, since it probably hasn't yet sunk in.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Fuji S6000fd.  Wide range zoom lens.  Sensor larger than the
1/1.8&quot; size that you say is the largest that can be used and still
remain on the comfortable side of your &quot;economic limit&quot;.  Low price
that clearly hasn't approached your economic limit.  How did Fuji
manage to do all that?  Maybe, as someone else recently implied,
Fuji has done something fishy.  Maybe their cameras use too much
plastic.  :)

I might have bought one, but it was so big and heavy!  A DSLR with similar

versatility.  Equally, I like the idea of not being stuck with last

The 4/3 system delivers on more than the DSLR bodies.  The small
lenses may not show much benefit, but the long, fast lenses, if I

The number of users that want a camera that big that's not a D-SLR is
apparently very small. The auto-focus on that camera was a lot slower
than that of a D-SLR. The AF system uses the sensor image for focusing,
just like on a P&amp;S. Why buy a camera that big and still have to put up
with long lag times.

Great, lenses from any 4:3 manufacturer, and how many manufacturers is
that? Even combining all the lenses from Sigma, Panasonic, and Olympus,
you still end up with far, far fewer lenses than are available for the
Nikon, Canon, Minolta, or Pentax mount.

&gt; Equally, I like the idea of not being stuck with last
&gt; century's sizes and optics, and I very much like the idea of the 4/3
&gt; system which should allow smaller cameras and has the advantages of
lenses
&gt; which can be bought from any 4/3 manufacturer.  But again, comparing on
&gt; size and weight, the 4/3 system fails to deliver compared to an &quot;APS&quot;
&gt; DSLR.
&gt;

4/3 failed because there was no real advantage to it. It's really just
the new Olympus mount.

You don't have to if you use pre-focus, which can be done manually or
in auto modes. It seems as easy to catch things like jugglers and
gymnasts in flight as it was with my old wet film SLR.

I found one of its features so unexpectedly useful so often that I now
wouldn't buy another camera without it, and that's the highly
swivellable LCD. Adds a lot of versatility and convenience to camera
positioning.
