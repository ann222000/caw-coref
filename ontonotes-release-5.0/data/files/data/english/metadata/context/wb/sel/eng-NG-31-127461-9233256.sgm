Two game leads all around. Yikes!

Who'd of thought....

I'm worried that the Sox -- &quot;Who needs offense?&quot; --
can't beat the Indians. That, and someone informs
me that Colorado is going all the way this year.

Of all the teams I'd least like to see win the marbles,
it's got to be Colorado.

Not that I'm a Cubs fan. I mean, sure, I find the idea
of a cubs win -- the first in, what, 99 years? -- as
appealing as the next guy. But I don't like *This*
cubs team. I just don't. They're not much of a team
to begin with (more of a collection of players) and'
they just don't deserve to win.

I was pulling for the Phillies in the National League.
The roomie is split between them and the Cubs
(grief times two), but I'm 100% Phillies. They're the
only MLB team other than the Sox I've ever gone to
see, the roomie &amp; I having taken several trips to
&quot;Citizens Bank Park.&quot;

Well, yeah, but they've already shown an alarming inability to beat
the Yankees, and anyway, one can't not want the Yankees to lose early
and often.

I'm with the roomie. I have a soft spot for the Cubs (how could a Red
Sox fan not?), but my brother lives in Philadelphia, so I've tended to
root for the Phillies as well. On the other
hand, he told me that as long as the Phillies are still in it he's
rooting for the Yankees, because he wants to go to a World Series game
with a Yankee-fan college friend.

I suspect it's moot, however, given that the Phillies, unlike the
other teams down 2-0, lost their two games at home.

Yes, but the ticket prices went up this year. It is
a great park though. ALL THE SEATS FACE THE GAME!!!!

That's quite a feature for anyone used to Fenway.

The biggest difference though is when you leave the
seats. It's clean, you can move around easily and the
ushers keep it all orderly. They won't even allow
people to move down the isles while a batter is at
the plate!

Although I love the field at Fenway, I think in many ways it's
unfortunate that the previous owners' intention to replace it has been
scrapped; the smallness and crowdedness of the concourses is one thing
that *can't* be fixed on the current site, and the narrowness of the
seats, despite vague hints from Janet Marie Smith, is probably not
going to change any time soon.

Safeco (Seattle) does this too. A couple of years ago they started
making announcements in Fenway requesting that fans not do this, but
they didn't do anything to enforce it (I've never seen an usher
anywhere near our seats), and pretty soon they dropped it
entirely. The people I don't understand are the ones who suddenly
decide that they need to *leave* their seats to get beer or food in
the middle of an at-bat.

One of the reasons I hate the Dodgers is that you simply can't move down
to better seats, even if they are available, ever.  The seats are

Wow, I guess I never was able to do that.  Not.  Unless you mean
that you can't change from reserved to loge to field boxes.  I've
always been able to move down and closer to home on the same level

fired for years now.)  But moving to better seats in the late
innings has not been one of them.

It's really nobody's fault that the Angels were seriously depleted by

So I heard yesterday from a Padres fan on LJ (but he was still

To the &quot;finest&quot; division do not necessarily go the spoils; I don't
think anyone would have bestowed that title on last year's NL Central.

The Red Sox used to segregate the bleachers in this fashion -- you
couldn't get from the bleachers to the rest of the stands. It's no

fan-friendliness implemented by the new ownership that took over in
'02.

Why anyone who's lived in New England for more than a day and a half
would stress about what Tuesday's weather forecast says about Friday
is beyond me.

That's not how it works. If Friday's game is rained out, it will be
rescheduled for some future date (likely Sunday), and the tickets for
the rained-out game will be honored. I know this from experience; in
2004, we had tickets for Game 3 of the ALCS (Friday), which we had
taken on the grounds that, if the Sox got into the LCS at all, it was
guaranteed to be played. But it rained on the Friday, and the game was
recheduled for the following Monday -- transforming it into game 5,
and as you may remember it looked an awful lot like there would be no
game 5 until quite late Sunday night. As it turned out, it was the
high point to date of my Fenway experiences.

In this case, you don't even have to worry about the game becoming an
&quot;if necessary&quot; -- at worse, it will turn into game 2.

That said, although I regret that I didn't get to go to any Division
Series games, I'm glad we didn't get to use our tickets for game 5
(tomorrow) both because that would have meant losing both games in
Anaheim and because the weather forecast for tomorrow isn't so great
either.

Now I'm hoping that the Sox beat the Indiands and that the World
Series goes 6.

More than I want to know. There are teams that didn't exist when I lived in
the US, and other teams that have moved from places that did exist to places
that didn't exist as baseball cities when I lived there. This goes for almost
all sports except, perhaps, bowls and croquet. Pretty soon they'll have a
baseball team in Fairbanks, AK and play the World Series wearing snowshoes.

I also hear much more than I wish to hear about American football, especially
about some team from San Diego.

We actually watched part of the Rugby World Cup together tonight, not because
I wished to, but because I was working on the living room laptop while the TV
was blatting away.

&gt;&gt;That's a matter of opinion, I suppose, but the answer is Yes.

&gt;By the by, did anyone see the Queer Eye when they spiffed up 5 of the Red

That was several years ago. It was neither more nor less idiotic than
any of the other QE shows.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Thanks for the update. Promise me you'll tell me whether the Red Sox get into
&gt;the World Series or not. It's the only way I'll find out.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Chris &quot;We're a bit short of US sport news here in Ould Blighty.&quot; Hansen

&gt;&gt;I'll bet &lt;lj user=&quot;spwebdesign&quot;&gt; could tell you anything you wanted to
&gt;&gt;know.

&gt;More than I want to know. There are teams that didn't exist when I lived in
&gt;the US, and other teams that have moved from places that did exist to places
&gt;that didn't exist as baseball cities when I lived there. This goes for almost
&gt;all sports except, perhaps, bowls and croquet. Pretty soon they'll have a
&gt;baseball team in Fairbanks, AK and play the World Series wearing snowshoes.

There's a game scheduled tonight in Denver. Game-time temperature is
predicted to be 43F (that's about 6C, in case you've forgotten).

I don't mind watching a few minutes of Rugby every now and again! I
suppose the lovely Ben Cohen no longer plays for England?
