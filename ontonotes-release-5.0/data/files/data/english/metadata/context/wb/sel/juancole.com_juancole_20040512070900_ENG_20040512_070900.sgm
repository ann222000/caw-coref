az-Zaman : The Coalition and Muqtada al-Sadr exchanged letters via
mediators during the past thirty-six hours, which may be fateful. Signs
of flexibility were apparent in Muqtada's response to ending the crisis,
assuming that the American side would accept negotiations on the basis
of his spokesman, Qais al-Khazali. At the same time, the new
American-appointed governor of Najaf intimated that there is a
possibility that any criminal proceedings against Muqtada al-Sadr may be
suspended if his militia stood down, disarmed, and left Najaf.

A statement issued by Muqtada's office in Najaf suggested that he
would end his insurgency in the Shiite south on condition that the
Americans agree to direct negotiations with him, a demand that the US
had rejected up until this point.

The grand ayatollahs of Najaf clearly anticipate a major blow-up if
these final negotiations fail. They have sent their wives and children
to stay with relatives outside Najaf, but are remaining in the city
themselves. The four grand ayatollahs include Ali Sistani, Muhammad
Sa'id al-Hakim, Bashir al-Najafi, and Muhammad Fayyad.

Al-Hayat says that in recent negotiations betwen Muqtada and the sons
of the grand ayatollahs, they have managed to convince him that he will
simply have to leave Najaf.

Tensions rose high in Najaf Tuesday because the Supreme Council for
Islamic Revolution in Iraq staged a demonstration, about a thousand
strong, in downtown Najaf demanding that the Sadrists leave town. (I saw
footage of the demonstration on CNN; it was relatively small, and all
the banners were those of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in
Iraq.) Sadr's Mahdi Army menaced the demonstrators and fired gunshots in
the air.

In the other major shrine city, Karbala, US troops clashed with Mahdi
Army fighters and for the first time attacked their positions in the
al-Mukhayyim Mosque, not so far from the sacred shrine of Imam Ali.

Likewise, US troops fought Sadrists at Kufa near Najaf, killing 13
and capturing 14.

The new governor of Najaf, Adnan Dhurufi, promised that the court
proceedings against Muqtada with regard to the murder last year of Abdul
Majid al-Khoei would be suspended if he disarmed his militiamen.

On Tuesday, American forces killed 13 Sadr supporters in Kufa. His
followers in Karbala have gathered again in the al-Mukhayyim Mosqu near
the shrine of Imam Husain. Saad Sufouk, the governor of Karbala, has
announced that this mosque would be turned into a hospital.

Nicholas Pelham reports another startling development. Gen. Martin
Dempsey, who is in charge of the Najaf area now, is forming a Najaf
Brigade on the model of the Fallujah Brigade. Az-Zaman says it will be
some 4,000 strong, and will include tribal levies as well as members of
the paramilitaries of the Shiite parties.

We appear to finally have someone in charge, in the person of Gen.
Dempsey, who knows what he is doing. (Dhurufi also seems to me to be
taking a wise course) Dempsey's plan is is crucial, since most
successful transitions from failed states with fractured paramilitary
gangs to successful new states have involved incorporating the militias
into national military structures. On the other hand, Dempsey is drawing
the wrong conclusion if the thinks the lesson here is that the US should
have gone after Muqtada earlier. That would have just produced the
insurgency earlier. His movement did not spread that much or get that
much more weaponry in the past 6 months. This movement goes back to the
early 1990s!

az-Zaman is less optimistic and notes that the new Najaf Brigade
could also be used to expel the Mahdi Army elements if they do not prove
cooperative. The paper reveals that the old Najaf police set up by the
Americans after the fall of Saddam had largely defected to the Mahdi
Army when the insurgency began. This tidbit helps explain how Muqtada
suddenly gained control of Najaf, where he hadn't been strong.
Presumably his missionaries had gradually recruited the police there.

A reader suggested to me that the apparent new flexibility on the
part of the Coalition regarding Muqtada may have had to do with the
successful attack on oil exports in the South on Sunday. That may well
be. But the general threat to the south from an ongoing Sadrist
insurgency must have been the framework for the decision, with the issue
of oil pipeline security being only one part of that puzzle.

Likewise, the prison torture scandal must be involved in the US
decision to back down. After all, what they were saying was that they
wanted to put Muqtada, a scion of the Prophet and of major clerical
lineages, in Abu Ghuraib. No major political leader would agree to that
at this point, and Muqtada's followers would never accept it. Likewise,
the threat to "capture or kill" him no longer looks macho in the wake of
investigations into over two dozen deaths of prisoners in US custody.
Moreover, one of the charges against Muqtada and his aides was that they
were running an informal parallel court system and were trying and
imprisoning people in the basements of their party HQs. The US isn't any
longer in a strong position to criticize Muqtada's rough justice.

Even without the Abu Ghuraib scandal and the pipeline issue, the
Coalition had never really been strong enough in the South to take on
Muqtada successfully. The 7500 British troops in Basra and points
somewhat north are extremely exposed and thin on the ground. Basra's
population is 1.3 million! Even if only 1 percent of them would fight
for Muqtada, and it is probably more, they would outnumber the entire
British contingent two to one!

But, as the US military attack on Karbala's al-Mukhayyim Mosque
demonstrates, we are not out of the woods yet, and an American war with
the Army of the Mahdi could still break out. It seems to me that it
would certainly destabilize Iraq for some time.
