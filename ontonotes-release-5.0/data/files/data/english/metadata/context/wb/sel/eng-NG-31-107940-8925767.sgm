...to fix the airlines?

I mean, really.  No politics.  No FAA union/management propaganda.
Just the facts, ma'am.

Here's what I *think* I know:

- Major airports (or &quot;hubs&quot;) are way over-crowded, beyond capacity
- Minor airports (or &quot;spokes&quot;) are becoming over-crowded, too
- GA airports (like Iowa City) are vastly under-utilized

The &quot;solution&quot; I most often hear bandied about is that the airlines
should abandon (or modify) the &quot;hub &amp; spoke&quot; business model (whereby
they have massive centers of activity -- or &quot;hubs&quot; -- feeding the
farther-out &quot;spoke&quot; airports), and start making better use of the
thousands of under-utilized airports in America.   In other words,
they should take the service to the people, rather than making the
people come to the service.

This is the model that Vern Raburn and others are trying to create
with the air taxi service, and the Eclipse jet.   It is also the model
that worked in America from 1930 to (roughly) 1980.

Of course, IMHO this flies in the face of economic realities.
Although the jury is still out on the Eclipse jet/air taxi model, the
hub &amp; spoke system evolved because it was the most efficient way to
provide cheap transportation to as many people as possible. The fact
that this system has grown beyond the means of the hub airports to
handle the traffic is an indication of its success -- but it still
begs the question:  What to do now that the hubs are beyond capacity?

Opinions?

Charge the airlines and anyone else using the overcrowded airports a premium
when they operate at peak times. Let's face it if the ticket rate is the
same if you fly out a 3am or 8am you are generally going to choose 8am.

It is a simple supply and demand problem. That runway is more valuable at
certain times during the day. They ought to charge more to use it then.

Why's that? Those airports already have landing fees. I'd bet that Phil
would jump all over that idea. Mainly because it puts the cost where it

St Louis bought out 3000 homes and built a billion dollar runway. TWA
folded, American moved out, and it sits unused right here in the

High speed rail.

The fact is, airline travel is not the answer for _mass_ transportation.
That is why efficiency (hub and spokes) has collided fatally with practical
limits (airport capacity and weather).

The trouble is, we have been too short-sighted for too long to correct the
situation.  The cost to create the infrastructure to support HSR would make
even a congressman blanche.  So we are stuck with automobiles, which are
inneficient, and airlines, which are unreliable.

Fix the airlines?  Not without building lots more hubs, perhaps connected by
rail.  Who's going to pay for that, let alone get it past the NIMBYs?

Exactly.  Smaller planes use more fuel per passenger, plus more of the
other overhead costs per passenger.  If you want to keep the cost per
passenger down, which I assume they do, then the airlines need to start
flying fewer trips per day on bigger airplanes.

I like the idea somebody else in this thread had of encouraging that
behaviour by setting landing fees based on how many operations per hour
happen that hour.  Or decide how many landing slots they have in the peak
hours, and auction them off to the highest bidder with the starting bid
&quot;free&quot;.  Airlines looking for lower costs will change their schedules to
avoid the hours where slots are going for lots of money, and people
willing to pay a premium can still get exactly the arrival time they want.

If you're a dinosaur, and you fail to adapt to the changing
environment and evolve into something viable, extinction is
inevitable.

The major carriers are buying smaller aircraft to compete with the
regionals.  Clearly that strategy is not working for the flying
public.  Perhaps they should scale back, and be content with long-haul
business exclusively.  But that would require major air carriers to
face the reality of a deregulated marketplace.

Alternatively, they can use their political muscle to force their
survival agenda on the nation's infrastructure at tax payers expense.
Ain't deregulation grand.  :-(

But high-speed rail is a reality in Europe.

When France put its first high-speed trains into service--more than a
quarter-century ago--air traffic between Paris and Lyons (the cities served by
the first line) almost instantly diminished by half.  The air traffic never
recovered.  Today, for trips of 1000 km or less, high-speed trains are faster
than air travel, and they are cheaper, more efficient, and more

The USA isn't France. In 2005 the average airline passenger trip length was

Good idea, but the major question with this is whether the relievers can
handle the traffic we need to offload - not to mention adequate ground
transportation to handle the added influx of passengers.

Who sets landing fees now? But to do it on a nation-wide basis the answer is
Congress. Well, if done correctly there shouldn't be a net gain in income to
the airport. The price of peak time flight would go up and the off peak
would go down. If a $10/seat swing doesn't do it naturally you increase the
cost until it does. I'd bet that the airline have enough data in their
systems right now to tell you pretty damn close where the swing amount will
be.

If there is no net cost to the airline to do it they should like the idea.
They would save enough in unscheduled holds and delays that they could foot
the cost for implementation and still increase profits.

Those that it would cost are those that need to get to a certain place at a
certain time. They are also the same people that the VLJ-Taxi services are
aimed at so cost isn't the prime mover there.

Joe and Sue vacation taker will like it because while they have to be at the
airport a 3:00 in the morning they are going to be paying less and have a
smaller crowd to deal with at the airport. The fact that they will do what
is needed to get a lower fare has been proven by things like PriceLine where
you don't even know when, other than a 24 hour period, you are going to fly.

Relievers exist to let non-airline traffic have a different airport to
land at rather than the primary airline airport.  Most often, they can NOT
handle a jetliner, for example RHV in San Jose.  In some cases they can,
but those tend to be used for air freight, for example MHR at Sacramento.

As you say, the costs to get that up and running rule it out, from the
start.

With the exception of the big east coast cities, the distances rule out HSR,
simply because of the distances, and the lack of people wanting to go to the

Nope, fixing the airlines is what we are stuck with.

Unfortunately, about any fix is going to involve spreading out the loads to

&gt;&gt; You should take a look at the trends over the past 5-7 years.

&gt;&gt; The airlines (major carriers) share of the market is diminishing, and

&gt; This is because they are turning over the spokes to the regional's. That's

And the regional's are going into some pretty obscure towns as well as some
suburban locales.

One thing promoting this is that businesses are no longer compelled to
locate in major cities, particularly for their satellite offices. For
example, Elgin, IL is getting a lot of businesses moving from Chicago and
O'Hare.

The costs of doing business out of a major metro area will have as much
impact as the FAA and user fees.

And a whole slew of official ones, too. For instance, the Senate Finance
Committee, as well as whole slew of sub-committees.

And then there's the inevitable cost-overruns as politically favored types
get sugar-daddy contracts. Denver's DIA airport is a great example of cost
overruns and ineptitude. Not to mention the politically favored developers
that got to buy up the land from the old Stapleton airport for really cheap,
after the taxpayers paid for most of the cleanup.

I don't recall the numbers, but Boston's system is a good example of MT
insanity. So are Denver's, Phoenix's and Portland's. From what I can tell,
Portland's was supposed to cost something like $300 million and carry 25% of
traffic (promises...promises), and is now approaching $5 BILLION and
carrying less than 8%. Denver's and Phoenix's are likely to be even worse.

So, imagine that on a NATIONAL scale. Say, a couple $TRILLION?

&gt; The USA isn't France. In 2005 the average airline passenger trip length was

The principle revolves around the enormous extra time required to take the
plane.  Trains go from city center to city center, and so about the only time
you spend on a train trip is time actually riding on the train.  Airplanes, on
the other hand, have a built-in delay of two hours or so at both ends of the
trip, irrespective of time in the air.  So a train trip that requires four
hours or less always wins over a plane trip, no matter what the distance
involved.

In general, I find that the threshold seems to be around 1000 km, which is a
bit under four hours at typical high-speed-rail speeds.  If you run the trains
faster, this threshold rises; if you run them slower (for example at U.S.
speeds), it shrinks until it's no longer worth discussion.

A high-speed-train could connect Los Angeles and San Diego in about 40
minutes.  This beats the 4 hours of plane travel by a handsome margin.  It
doesn't matter whether it's the U.S. or Europe, the numbers work the same way.
The U.S. resists such ideas for reasons unconnected with the actual efficiency
and travel time.

all their original powers to regulate the airlines and presto-chango:
1 Ticket fees will triple or quadruple
2 Stu's will be wearing semi military uniforms with pert little hats
and they will be young, single, and nubile
3 The number of daily flights will be regulated by law
4 The airline airports will become quiet and dusty places inbetween
the 6 daily flights allowed
5 Leave it to Beaver will begin a new series
6 The Contrail Conspiracists will all have to move in with the TWA800
group
7. Nuculer families will once again be a working father and a

8 Gas will be under a dollar a gallon

Agree. (This is the same problem, BTW, that is addressed by private

This is also the main idea behind the &quot;new&quot; &quot;Air Taxi Service&quot;, which

When I was a boy, people in Iowa City routinely flew United and Ozark
Air Lines to anywhere in the country.  This was possible because the
US Air Mail paid the airlines to fly mail to hundreds of smaller
airports, like Iowa City -- and the passengers were literally just
gravy.  (They broke even whether they carried passengers or not.)

When the postal service was forced by Congress to get more efficient
in 1972 (by then, we'd pissed all of our wealth away on Viet Nam and
the Great Society), the airlines could no long justify flying their
big, fuel-inefficient, union-operated Martin 404s into places like
Iowa City -- and most of the country was left without decent airline
service.

Vern Raburn's EclipseJet was supposed to be the answer to this
problem.  So far, I've seen little progress along those lines -- but
the confluence of &quot;hub&quot; airport overcrowding along with an FAA in
&quot;crisis&quot; seems to be shoving the system in a direction away from the
status quo.

Eclipse is on the financial bubble. They need to sell around 500-600 planes
a year to even begin to recoup their costs, and they have had a lot of
setbacks like the engines and avionics. If the engine and avionics encounter
difficulties, then the whole production process comes to a grinding halt,
with no cash inflow. Unless they get a lot more venture capital (or is it
capitol), they won't be around for long. Same goes for all of the other
VLJ's, except possibly Cirrus or Cessna.

Then, watch for Honda to let the dust settle and have them introduce their
own jet- they obviously can bankroll the whole process from start to finish.
If it has the same reliability, fit, and finish of an Acura, it will be a
winner, despite a more realistic and higher price point. I plan on buying a
used TBM at that point, since their value will likely drop tremendously when
this happens.

Cessna's Mustang is not, technically, a VLJ, and Cirrus' VLJ is going to be
a lot further out than Eclipse. Eclipse has solved it's engine problems and
it's avionics solution is well on it's way to being solved. They've
delieverd 11 so far, and have had their first revenue flight.

Honda's VLJ is nice, but at nearly $4M, it's nearly the same price as a CJ1.
An Eclipse 500 goes, right now, for about $1.8M with most options, and about
$1.9M for a Part 135 capable airplane.

Eclipse also has a &quot;By the hour&quot; package that will, ostensibly, result in an
per hour operating cost of around $415/hour, assuming Jet-A stays at about
$4.25 a gallon. Of course, at 55-75 GPH, if fuel prices DO climb, Eclipse
will have even more of an advantage over its competitors.

My take is that the VLJ market is going to replace the piston twins, and
possibly many turboprops. Cirrus will get the short-haul air taxi market and
Eclipse will get the longer hauls and those when they need to top terrain
and weather.

Eclipse will survive only if they can deliver 500-600 planes a year, and if
they do not encounter engine or avionics issues along the way (as they
already have). Their current production is less than around 20-30 a month,
not enough to keep the cash flow going for very long.

There is also no way an Eclipse will cost $415 an hour, even if flown
hundreds of hours a year. Fuel alone will cost $300 an hour, and insurance
for 2 million is around $25,000 a year.  At 200 hours a year this already
adds up to over $500/hr. Figure any regular maintenance and engine reserves,
hangar, etc, and it'll be at least $750 an hour.

They are also range and payload limited, particularly compared to
turboprops. They are small and tight inside, especially compared to a King
Air.

Their market may be smaller than they originally proposed, and with lots of
competition. Unless they ramp up significantly and start rolling a lot of
planes out the door soon, they will run out of cash unless they get a ton
more venture capital.

Faster than most currently available air-taxi aircraft and probably much
more expensive!

Well, they have 2000 on order, so 500-600 a year isn't going to be to tough
once they get going.

Read their whitepaper on their production methods.

At full power, it's 90gph; at cruise it's 55 to 60. That 90gph is when it
climbs to FL350 in 21 minutes.

Insurance is 32,000K divided by an estimated 500 hrs a year = $64/hr.

Not too many jets fly 200 hours a year - more like 500, or more for air
taxi/charter.

Maint and reserves come under their &quot;Jet Complete&quot; program which is $150/hr
and covers scheduled and unscheduled maintenace, flight support, recurrent
training, a fuel program that discounts fuel 40 cents a gallon, AOG over
night, nav and WX database updates, rental engine coverage, etc.

As for engine TBO reserve, it's going to be far less than a TP engine (with
prop OH)or a Williams FJ-44 or 33.

Their NBAA ranges is 1125 nm, for a King Air C90 it's 831.

They have more leg room (18&quot;)  than a King Air C90 (7.5&quot;), are 1.2 inches
narrower, and 4&quot; shorter (47&quot; vs 51&quot;) They fly 100 kts faster, and climb
nearly twice as fast, s your trip time is less.

Having Bill Gates, whathisface Allen, and several other high rollers is a
pretty good influx of capital.

Some commercial airline flights are the same way, depending on the route.
