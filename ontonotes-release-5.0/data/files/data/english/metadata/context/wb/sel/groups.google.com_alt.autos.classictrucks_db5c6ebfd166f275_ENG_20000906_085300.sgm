Well, for the 5.3 Chevy, there is a ECM re-programme that can be done to
improve HP/Torque and mileage. I wouldn't play with that engine too much.
Our shop did and it blew up.

BTW we got 221 HP on the Dyno from that engine.

Interestingly enough he could have opted for the 2500 series and the
6.0 L engine and 300 bhp, or the 6.5L toybo in either version.

Jeez, did you drive the 4800 lb behemoth before you plunked down your
money?
