Remember all those sci-fi flicks?  Always with some desirable wench in
a skin-tight space suit who gets devoured by the space monster three
quarters of the way through?  Here's MIT's latest offering in
spacesuits.

One giant leap for space fashion: MIT team designs sleek, skintight
spacesuit
By Anne Trafton, News Office

In the 40 years that humans have been traveling into space, the suits
they wear have changed very little. The bulky, gas-pressurized outfits
give astronauts a bubble of protection, but their significant mass and
the pressure itself severely limit mobility.

Dava Newman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and
engineering systems at MIT, wants to change that.

Newman is working on a sleek, advanced suit designed to allow superior
mobility when humans eventually reach Mars or return to the moon. Her
spandex and nylon BioSuit is not your grandfather's spacesuit -- think
more Spiderman, less John Glenn.

Traditional bulky spacesuits &quot;do not afford the mobility and
locomotion capability that astronauts need for partial gravity
exploration missions. We really must design for greater mobility and
enhanced human and robotic capability,&quot; Newman says.

Newman, her colleague Jeff Hoffman, her students and a local design
firm, Trotti and Associates, have been working on the project for
about seven years. Their prototypes are not yet ready for space
travel, but demonstrate what they're trying to achieve -- a
lightweight, skintight suit that will allow astronauts to become truly
mobile lunar and Mars explorers.

Newman anticipates that the BioSuit could be ready by the time humans
are ready to launch an expedition to Mars, possibly in about 10 years.
Current spacesuits could not handle the challenges of such an
exploratory mission, Newman says.

A New Approach

Newman's prototype suit is a revolutionary departure from the
traditional model. Instead of using gas pressurization, which exerts a
force on the astronaut's body to protect it from the vacuum of space,
the suit relies on mechanical counter-pressure, which involves
wrapping tight layers of material around the body. The trick is to
make a suit that is skintight but stretches with the body, allowing
freedom of movement.

Over the past 40 years, spacesuits have gotten progressively heavier,
and they now weigh in at about 300 pounds. That bulk -- much of which
is due to multiple layers and the life support system coupled with the
gas-pressurization -- severely constrains astronauts' movements. About
70 to 80 percent of the energy they exert while wearing the suit goes
towards simply working against the suit to bend it.

&quot;You can't do much bending of the arms or legs in that type of suit,&quot;
Newman says.

When an astronaut is in a micro-gravity environment (for example,
doing a spacewalk outside the International Space Station), working in
such a massive suit is manageable, but, as Newman says, &quot;It's a whole
different ballgame when we go to the moon or Mars, and we have to go
back to walking and running, or loping.&quot;

Another advantage to her BioSuit is safety: if a traditional spacesuit
is punctured by a tiny meteorite or other object, the astronaut must
return to the space station or home base immediately, before
life-threatening decompression occurs. With the BioSuit, a small,
isolated puncture can be wrapped much like a bandage, and the rest of
the suit will be unaffected.

Newman says the finished BioSuit may be a hybrid that incorporates
some elements of the traditional suits, including a gas-pressured
torso section and helmet. An oxygen tank can be attached to the back.

The MIT researchers are focusing on the legs and arms, which are
challenging parts to design. In the Man-Vehicle Lab at MIT, students
test various wrapping techniques, based on 3D models they've created
of the human in motion and how the skin stretches during locomotion,
bending, climbing or driving a rover.

Key to their design is the pattern of lines on the suit, which
correspond to lines of non-extension (lines on the skin that don't
extend when you move your leg). Those lines provide a stiff &quot;skeleton&quot;
of structural support, while providing maximal mobility.

To be worn in space, the BioSuit must deliver close to one-third the
pressure exerted by Earth's atmosphere, or about 30 kPa (kilopascals).
The current prototype suit exerts about 20 KPa consistently, and the
researchers have gotten new models up to 25 to 30 KPa.

Staying in Shape

The suits could also help astronauts stay fit during the six-month
journey to Mars. Studies have shown that astronauts lose up to 40
percent of their muscle strength in space, but the new outfits could
be designed to offer varying resistance levels, allowing the
astronauts to exercise against the suits during a long flight to Mars.

Although getting the suits into space is the ultimate goal, Newman is
also focusing on Earth-bound applications in the short term, such as
athletic training or helping people walk.

The new BioSuit builds on ideas developed in the 1960s and 1970s by
Paul Webb, who first came up with the concept for a &quot;space activity
suit,&quot; and Saul Iberall, who postulated the lines of non-extension.
However, neither the technology nor the materials were available then.

&quot;Dr. Webb had a great idea, before its time. We're building on that
work to try to make it feasible,&quot; says Newman.

The project was initially funded by the NASA Institute for Advanced
Concepts.

Old lady surfing Web at 40 gigabits-per-second

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- She is a latecomer to the information
superhighway, but 75-year-old Sigbritt Lothberg is now cruising the Internet
with a dizzying speed.

Lothberg's 40 gigabits-per-second fiber-optic connection in Karlstad is
believed to be the fastest residential uplink in the world, Karlstad city
officials said.

In less than 2 seconds, Lothberg can download a full-length movie on her
home computer -- many thousand times faster than most residential
connections, said Hafsteinn Jonsson, head of the Karlstad city network unit.

Jonsson and Lothberg's son, Peter, worked together to install the
connection.

The speed is reached using a new modulation technique that allows the
sending of data between two routers placed up to 1,240 miles apart, without
any transponders in between, Jonsson said.

&quot;We wanted to show that that there are no limitations to Internet speed,&quot; he
said.

Peter Lothberg, who is a networking expert, said he wanted to demonstrate
the new technology while providing a computer link for his mother.

&quot;She's a brand new Internet user,&quot; Lothberg said by phone from California,
where he lives. &quot;She didn't even have a computer before.&quot;

His mother isn't exactly making the most of her high-speed connection. She
only uses it to read Web-based newspapers. E-mail to a friend

&gt; STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- She is a latecomer to the information
&gt; superhighway, but 75-year-old Sigbritt Lothberg is now cruising the Internet
&gt; with a dizzying speed.

&gt; Lothberg's 40 gigabits-per-second fiber-optic connection in Karlstad is
&gt; believed to be the fastest residential uplink in the world, Karlstad city
&gt; officials said.

&gt; In less than 2 seconds, Lothberg can download a full-length movie on her
&gt; home computer -- many thousand times faster than most residential
&gt; connections, said Hafsteinn Jonsson, head of the Karlstad city network unit.

&gt; Jonsson and Lothberg's son, Peter, worked together to install the
&gt; connection.

&gt; The speed is reached using a new modulation technique that allows the
&gt; sending of data between two routers placed up to 1,240 miles apart, without
&gt; any transponders in between, Jonsson said.

&gt; &quot;We wanted to show that that there are no limitations to Internet speed,&quot; he
&gt; said.

&gt; Peter Lothberg, who is a networking expert, said he wanted to demonstrate
&gt; the new technology while providing a computer link for his mother.

&gt; &quot;She's a brand new Internet user,&quot; Lothberg said by phone from California,
&gt; where he lives. &quot;She didn't even have a computer before.&quot;

Well she can't.

You can't get the data out of the router and into her computer that fast.

You can't get it out of the server that fast either...

LANs just ain't that fast yet...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a skin-tight space suit who gets devoured by the space monster three
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; quarters of the way through?  Here's MIT's latest offering in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spacesuits.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; PRESS RELEASE

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; July 16, 2007

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One giant leap for space fashion: MIT team designs sleek, skintight
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spacesuit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; By Anne Trafton, News Office

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In the 40 years that humans have been traveling into space, the suits
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they wear have changed very little. The bulky, gas-pressurized outfits
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; give astronauts a bubble of protection, but their significant mass and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the pressure itself severely limit mobility.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Dava Newman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; engineering systems at MIT, wants to change that.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman is working on a sleek, advanced suit designed to allow superior
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mobility when humans eventually reach Mars or return to the moon. Her
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spandex and nylon BioSuit is not your grandfather's spacesuit -- think
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; more Spiderman, less John Glenn.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Traditional bulky spacesuits &quot;do not afford the mobility and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; locomotion capability that astronauts need for partial gravity
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; exploration missions. We really must design for greater mobility and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; enhanced human and robotic capability,&quot; Newman says.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman, her colleague Jeff Hoffman, her students and a local design
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; firm, Trotti and Associates, have been working on the project for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about seven years. Their prototypes are not yet ready for space
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; travel, but demonstrate what they're trying to achieve -- a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lightweight, skintight suit that will allow astronauts to become truly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mobile lunar and Mars explorers.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman anticipates that the BioSuit could be ready by the time humans
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are ready to launch an expedition to Mars, possibly in about 10 years.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Current spacesuits could not handle the challenges of such an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; exploratory mission, Newman says.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; A New Approach

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman's prototype suit is a revolutionary departure from the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; traditional model. Instead of using gas pressurization, which exerts a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; force on the astronaut's body to protect it from the vacuum of space,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the suit relies on mechanical counter-pressure, which involves
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wrapping tight layers of material around the body. The trick is to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; make a suit that is skintight but stretches with the body, allowing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; freedom of movement.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Over the past 40 years, spacesuits have gotten progressively heavier,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and they now weigh in at about 300 pounds. That bulk -- much of which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is due to multiple layers and the life support system coupled with the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gas-pressurization -- severely constrains astronauts' movements. About
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 70 to 80 percent of the energy they exert while wearing the suit goes
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; towards simply working against the suit to bend it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;You can't do much bending of the arms or legs in that type of suit,&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman says.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When an astronaut is in a micro-gravity environment (for example,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; doing a spacewalk outside the International Space Station), working in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; such a massive suit is manageable, but, as Newman says, &quot;It's a whole
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; different ballgame when we go to the moon or Mars, and we have to go
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; back to walking and running, or loping.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Another advantage to her BioSuit is safety: if a traditional spacesuit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is punctured by a tiny meteorite or other object, the astronaut must
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; return to the space station or home base immediately, before
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; life-threatening decompression occurs. With the BioSuit, a small,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; isolated puncture can be wrapped much like a bandage, and the rest of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the suit will be unaffected.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman says the finished BioSuit may be a hybrid that incorporates
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; some elements of the traditional suits, including a gas-pressured
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; torso section and helmet. An oxygen tank can be attached to the back.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The MIT researchers are focusing on the legs and arms, which are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; challenging parts to design. In the Man-Vehicle Lab at MIT, students
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; test various wrapping techniques, based on 3D models they've created
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of the human in motion and how the skin stretches during locomotion,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bending, climbing or driving a rover.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Key to their design is the pattern of lines on the suit, which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; correspond to lines of non-extension (lines on the skin that don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; extend when you move your leg). Those lines provide a stiff &quot;skeleton&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of structural support, while providing maximal mobility.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To be worn in space, the BioSuit must deliver close to one-third the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pressure exerted by Earth's atmosphere, or about 30 kPa (kilopascals).
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The current prototype suit exerts about 20 KPa consistently, and the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; researchers have gotten new models up to 25 to 30 KPa.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Staying in Shape

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The suits could also help astronauts stay fit during the six-month
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; journey to Mars. Studies have shown that astronauts lose up to 40
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; percent of their muscle strength in space, but the new outfits could
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be designed to offer varying resistance levels, allowing the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; astronauts to exercise against the suits during a long flight to Mars.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Although getting the suits into space is the ultimate goal, Newman is

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; quarters of the way through?  Here's MIT's latest offering in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spacesuits.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; PRESS RELEASE

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; July 16, 2007

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One giant leap for space fashion: MIT team designs sleek, skintight
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spacesuit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; By Anne Trafton, News Office

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In the 40 years that humans have been traveling into space, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suits
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they wear have changed very little. The bulky, gas-pressurized
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; outfits
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; give astronauts a bubble of protection, but their significant mass
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the pressure itself severely limit mobility.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Dava Newman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; engineering systems at MIT, wants to change that.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman is working on a sleek, advanced suit designed to allow
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; superior
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mobility when humans eventually reach Mars or return to the moon.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Her
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spandex and nylon BioSuit is not your grandfather's spacesuit --
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; think
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; more Spiderman, less John Glenn.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Traditional bulky spacesuits &quot;do not afford the mobility and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; locomotion capability that astronauts need for partial gravity
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; exploration missions. We really must design for greater mobility
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; enhanced human and robotic capability,&quot; Newman says.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman, her colleague Jeff Hoffman, her students and a local design
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; firm, Trotti and Associates, have been working on the project for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about seven years. Their prototypes are not yet ready for space
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; travel, but demonstrate what they're trying to achieve -- a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lightweight, skintight suit that will allow astronauts to become
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; truly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mobile lunar and Mars explorers.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman anticipates that the BioSuit could be ready by the time
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; humans
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are ready to launch an expedition to Mars, possibly in about 10
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; years.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Current spacesuits could not handle the challenges of such an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; exploratory mission, Newman says.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; A New Approach

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman's prototype suit is a revolutionary departure from the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; traditional model. Instead of using gas pressurization, which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; exerts a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; force on the astronaut's body to protect it from the vacuum of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; space,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the suit relies on mechanical counter-pressure, which involves
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wrapping tight layers of material around the body. The trick is to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; make a suit that is skintight but stretches with the body, allowing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; freedom of movement.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Over the past 40 years, spacesuits have gotten progressively
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; heavier,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and they now weigh in at about 300 pounds. That bulk -- much of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is due to multiple layers and the life support system coupled with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gas-pressurization -- severely constrains astronauts' movements.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; About
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 70 to 80 percent of the energy they exert while wearing the suit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; goes
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; towards simply working against the suit to bend it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;You can't do much bending of the arms or legs in that type of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suit,&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman says.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When an astronaut is in a micro-gravity environment (for example,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; doing a spacewalk outside the International Space Station), working
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; such a massive suit is manageable, but, as Newman says, &quot;It's a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; whole
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; different ballgame when we go to the moon or Mars, and we have to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; go
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; back to walking and running, or loping.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Another advantage to her BioSuit is safety: if a traditional
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spacesuit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is punctured by a tiny meteorite or other object, the astronaut
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; must
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; return to the space station or home base immediately, before
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; life-threatening decompression occurs. With the BioSuit, a small,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; isolated puncture can be wrapped much like a bandage, and the rest
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the suit will be unaffected.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Newman says the finished BioSuit may be a hybrid that incorporates
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; some elements of the traditional suits, including a gas-pressured
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; torso section and helmet. An oxygen tank can be attached to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; back.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The MIT researchers are focusing on the legs and arms, which are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; challenging parts to design. In the Man-Vehicle Lab at MIT,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; students
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; test various wrapping techniques, based on 3D models they've
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; created
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of the human in motion and how the skin stretches during
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; locomotion,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bending, climbing or driving a rover.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Key to their design is the pattern of lines on the suit, which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; correspond to lines of non-extension (lines on the skin that don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; extend when you move your leg). Those lines provide a stiff
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;skeleton&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of structural support, while providing maximal mobility.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To be worn in space, the BioSuit must deliver close to one-third
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pressure exerted by Earth's atmosphere, or about 30 kPa
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (kilopascals).
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The current prototype suit exerts about 20 KPa consistently, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; researchers have gotten new models up to 25 to 30 KPa.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Staying in Shape

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The suits could also help astronauts stay fit during the six-month
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; journey to Mars. Studies have shown that astronauts lose up to 40
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; percent of their muscle strength in space, but the new outfits
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; could
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be designed to offer varying resistance levels, allowing the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; astronauts to exercise against the suits during a long flight to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mars.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Although getting the suits into space is the ultimate goal, Newman
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; also focusing on Earth-bound applications in the short term, such
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; athletic training or helping people walk.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The new BioSuit builds on ideas developed in the 1960s and 1970s by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Paul Webb, who first came up with the concept for a &quot;space activity
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suit,&quot; and Saul Iberall, who postulated the lines of non-extension.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; However, neither the technology nor the materials were available
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; then.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Dr. Webb had a great idea, before its time. We're building on that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; work to try to make it feasible,&quot; says Newman.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The project was initially funded by the NASA Institute for Advanced
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Concepts.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Eugene L Griessel

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    A man's memory is what he forgets with.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; IIRC there was an sf story about similar suits and there was some
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sort
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of polarization that would make them transparent. That sounds like
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; something a geek designer would make a part of the suit without
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; telling anyone.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I guess those x-ray vision glasses that used to be sold in the back of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; comic
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; books, along with sea monkeys, teacup poodles, and Mr. Atlas courses,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; never
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; caught on ...

&gt;&gt; &gt; They caught on they just never delivered, 17 pairs and no joy

&gt;&gt; Still on science topic, sorta kinda.

&gt;&gt; You know it's a slow news day when you turn on the telly to CNN Breaking
&gt;&gt; News:  Awaiting word of GWB's recovery from routine colonoscopy.

&gt; You can assume everyone is waiting for Cheney to emulate Ronald
&gt; Reagan's unguarded microphone moment from 1984, but this time for
&gt; real.

&gt; &quot;My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed
&gt; legislation that will outlaw (Insert name of enemy here) forever. We
&gt; begin bombing in five minutes,&quot;
">

Anyway, to keep it slightly on topic, 5 small polyps were removed and will
be examined microscopically at the *Naval* Medical Centre.  But, don't
panic, kiddies ... GWB has a multi-year history of having previously had
several benign polyps removed.  The world will be safe from Cheney ...%)

&gt; &gt; STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- She is a latecomer to the information
&gt; &gt; superhighway, but 75-year-old Sigbritt Lothberg is now cruising the
&gt; &gt; Internet
&gt; &gt; with a dizzying speed.

&gt; &gt; Lothberg's 40 gigabits-per-second fiber-optic connection in Karlstad is

&gt; &gt; officials said.

&gt; &gt; In less than 2 seconds, Lothberg can download a full-length movie on her

It has its own issues and is harder than it sounds.  You have to worry
about things like blood blisters where the 'suit' doesn't maintain
identical support, etc.

A further part of the concept was to try to make the suit
semipermeable, so that cooling through sweat would work.

This isn't that big a step from what is being used, though, Willie.  I
can go out and buy a PC today that can manage a 2Gbs connection out of
the box via plain old ethernet.

What's an order of magnitude amongst friends?  Maybe she runs LAN
parties across the net from various rooms in her house...

The real problem is on the FEEDING end.  No matter what she's running,
she's going to find herself bandwidth limited on how much she can pull
because the folks she's pulling from aren't going to give her that big
a pipe.

Any number of sites?  You have an infinitely powerful processor, do

Of course it would.  Many sites 'throttle' individual users.  Even
those which do not would also have to be tied to the backbone with the
same high speed connection as &quot;the old dear has&quot; for her to pull from
them at the speeds being touted.

be a good idea to let the Nebulator have his fun. If nothing else it
