First Biomarker Discovered that Predicts Prostate Cancer Outcome,
Inventor at Mayo Clinic Says

August 15, 2007â€”A molecule called B7-H3 appears to play a role in
prostate cancer development and can be used to predict cancer recurrence
and progression after surgery. Researchers at Mayo Clinic Cancer Center
published a report on their discovery today in Cancer Research and have
applied for patents on the technology.

&quot;This discovery will allow physicians to individualize treatment and
observation plans for prostate cancer patients,&quot; says Timothy Roth,
M.D., a Mayo Clinic urology resident and lead author of the study.
&quot;Being able to tell a patient his specific risk after surgery, and
perhaps even prior to surgery, will be a huge step forward.&quot;

Important risk predictors after prostate surgery are Gleason sum
established by biopsy of the removed prostate tissue, degree of capsular
pentetration and whether the surgeon was able to achieve &quot;clean
margins.&quot; The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and the test
for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) are useful to diagnose
prostate cancer and to follow the patient after surgery for possible
recurrence. &quot;However,&quot; the Mayo authors say, &quot;PSA tends to leave
prostate cancer cells and migrate throughout the body, making it a poor
target for therapy.&quot;

Today's Research

In this study, Mayo researchers demonstrate that nearly all normal,
pre-malignant and cancerous prostate cells have B7-H3 on their surface.
Unlike PSA, B7-H3 stays attached to the surface of prostate cancer cells
and does not appear to migrate, thus making B7-H3 a particularly
attractive target for therapy.

The researchers believe that B7-H3 kills or paralyzes immune cells that
are trying to attack the cancer.

Their findings indicate that B7-H3 may prove useful as a diagnostic,
prognostic (forecasting) and even therapeutic tool because it is stably
or increasingly displayed by tumor cells as prostate cancers develop --
even after initiation of anti-hormone therapy, which is the most common
treatment for advanced prostate cancer.

The physician-research team examined tissue from 338 consecutive
patients who had cancers confined to the prostate and were treated
exclusively with a radical prostatectomy (surgery to remove the
prostate) between 1995 and 1998. All tumors and precancerous tissues
displayed B7-H3, but patients with the highest levels of B7-H3 within
their prostate tumors (19.8 percent) were four times more likely to
experience cancer progression compared to those with weak levels of
B7-H3 within their tumors. Moderate levels of B7-H3 also correlated with
a slightly higher risk of recurrence (35 percent).

&quot;Because B7-H3 is present in all prostate cancer tumors, and marked
levels predict recurrence, we are able to forecast with much greater
certainty the likelihood of cancer progression, regardless of
therapeutic intervention,&quot; says Eugene Kwon, M.D., a senior investigator
and urologist at Mayo Clinic.

For some patients, a 'watchful waiting' clinical approach is sometimes
used to manage prostate cancer to see if the cancer becomes increasingly
aggressive before resorting to therapy. The researchers say that the
evaluation of B7-H3 levels in prostate biopsies from patients may soon
help to determine which patients may benefit from a watchful waiting
strategy versus early aggressive treatment.

Individualized Medicine Emerges
Mayo Clinic's findings on biomarker identification may accelerate the
development of new forms of therapy, say the researchers. Additionally,
prostate cancer now joins kidney cancer as a malignancy that can be
tracked and predicted based on the presence of B7-H immune molecules.

&quot;This is the way of the future,&quot; says Dr. Kwon, &quot;We are becoming
educated about ways to flesh out the molecular signatures of each
patient's cancer. Using such molecular signatures will facilitate, for
the first time, a truly individualized approach to prescribing the most
appropriate therapy for a given patient. We will soon be able to
tailor-make therapies for each person's cancer.&quot;

B7-H3 in the Future

To understand how B7-H3 affects the immune system, and whether a
mutation of B7-H3 is involved in the anti-immune activity, more research
is necessary. Mayo is planning clinical trials for a number of cancers
in late 2008, and researchers are currently developing the necessary
therapeutic antibodies to be used in these studies. Investigators expect
that clinical laboratory tests for the B7-H proteins may become
available at Mayo to assist with the assessment of patients with kidney
cancer by late 2007 or early 2008, and then for prostate cancer patients
shortly thereafter.
Mayo Registry

This study was possible because of Mayo's unique patient registry for
prostate cancer. The registry contains hundreds of pieces of
information, ranging from environmental factors to specific medical test
results, for more than 15,000 prostate cancer patients, all followed
prospectively since the first patient was entered into the database in
1970. The Mayo Clinic prostate cancer and kidney cancer registries
represent the most detailed and complete cancer reference tools in the
world. Using the kidney cancer registry, Mayo investigators were
previously able to link high levels of another B7-H molecule, B7-H1, to
poor kidney cancer outcomes, including significantly shortened survival
times.

Without the key road maps provided by these registries, the recognition
of important molecules that drive cancer would not be feasible, say the
researchers. Use of these patient registries enables laboratory science
to be directly linked to patient care and survival following treatment.

&quot;To a large extent, working with these registries dramatically lessens
the time, resources and effort that are required to link a candidate
molecule to its role in cancer development and progression,&quot; says Dr.
Kwon, who is also the co-director of the Cancer Immunology and
Immunotherapy Program in Mayo Clinic Cancer Center. &quot;Our studies are the
very first to provide a clear link between immune molecules and the
behaviors of various cancers.&quot;

Dr. Kwon and his fellow researchers have been charged by Mayo Clinic to
investigate all cancers for immune molecules that may govern cancer
behavior while doubling as new therapeutic targets -- identifying future
research targets.

Background: B7-H3 and Immunology Research at Mayo

Mayo Clinic Cancer Center was the first to discover the B7-H family of
immune molecules -- proteins that normally help regulate the immune
response process. Mayo investigators showed that B7-H3 and other members
of the B7-H family, such as B7-H1, can actually protect cancers as they
develop.

Mayo Clinic identified B7-H3 as a new molecule in 2001. Mayo researchers
published the first research identifying an immune molecule's role in
cancer, with multiple publications about the role of B7-H1 in heralding
a poor outcome for patients with kidney cancer. Although a number of
hypotheses predicted that these molecules might enable cancer
development, prior to these studies no one had shown it in cancer
patients.
In studying the B7-H family of molecules the researchers have already
reviewed tens of thousands of samples from at least 30 different
cancers, including cancers of the breast, colon, pancreas, brain and
ovary, as well as mesothelioma.

knowledge is power - growing old is mandatory - growing wise is optional
&quot;Many more men die with prostate cancer than of it. Growing old is
invariably fatal. Prostate cancer is only sometimes so.&quot;
