Does anyone want to ask why I've been working on my
Electro-Magnetic-Resonance Death Ray NOW???

Google have broken the peace. This means war!

Nikola, be a good 'wig and calm down for a moment. It's been
*moved*, as you would realise if you'd read Isambard's recent
message &lt;20070103114804.470950427538 ... @earwigs.org&gt; where
they were using it to look for Dinsdale. Google have either
taken another aerial photograph, or a team of earwigs from
MiniTruth have gone and airbrushed it out on the grounds of
Notional Security.

Have some TS and relax for a bit.

Cadbury.

(response to Rafe's subject line.)

The only thing Google have obliterated is the usefulness of Deja News.

A fresh supply of coal has been obtained, but warming the boiler took a
while. The power to take aerial photographs is nothing compared with the
power of a giant mechanical earwig.
