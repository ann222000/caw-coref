What Atheists Can't Answer
By Michael Gerson Friday, July 13, 2007;
Page A17 Washington Post

&quot; Human nature, in other circumstances, is also
clearly constructed for cruel exploitation,
uncontrollable rage, icy selfishness and a range of
other less desirable traits.

So the dilemma is this: How do we choose between
good and bad instincts? Theism, for several
millennia, has given one answer: We should
cultivate the better angels of our nature because
the God we love and respect requires it. While many
of us fall tragically short, the ideal remains.

Atheism provides no answer to this dilemma. It
cannot reply: &quot;Obey your evolutionary instincts&quot;
because those instincts are conflicted. &quot;Respect
your brain chemistry&quot; or &quot;follow your mental
wiring&quot; don't seem very compelling either. It would
be perfectly rational for someone to respond: &quot;To
hell with my wiring and your socialization, I'm
going to do whatever I please.&quot;  &quot;

Consider, Mr. Gerson:

If it were the case that religion is our instructor,
then there would be no prisons. There are, and
consider, further, that the most religious (at least
professing to be) group in this country is the two
million criminals in our prisons. 'Nouf said.

But if you still think that morality/ethics is in any
way/shape/form associated with religious belief, then
but think about the depravity of priests and preachers
--who have been caught. Shouldn't that, at least, be
enough to remove any convictions you might have had
about religious instruction &quot;bettering&quot; our &quot;naturally
evil nature.&quot;

Further: People who think they should be good BECAUSE
their God requires it are only setting themselves up
for the most evil preacher's definition of The Good.
Time and time again we have seen preachers &quot;inform&quot;
their congregations that God wants them to fight this
or that war (Confederate preachers urged their
congregations to kill as many Yankees as possible), or
to butcher and plunder this or that people (in the
best of Islamic traditions, Turkish preachers told
their congregations that murdering Armenians for their
possessions (and raping their women and children
before slaughtering them) was what God expected of
them... and because acknowledging this monstrous truth
about Islam before the whole world is so impossible,
the Turks to this day refuse to acknowledge that the
Armenian/Muslim genocide even ever took place).

But I don't have to prove to any parent that we are
ALL born with unfettered instincts--to be &quot;bettered&quot;
by the (sometimes even the most casual &amp; offhand)
instructions of our parents and societies: Every child
KNOWS the difference between good and evil (deeds) by
the time he/she is four or five. And if they don't,
then that is a certain sign that such children live in
a warped and perverted society or family.

The four-year-old who does &quot;evil&quot; may not yet know how
to &quot;get away with it,&quot; but he certainly knows he had
better not get caught doing it.

Therefore, if there be man or woman on this earth who
still does not know the difference between Good and
Evil... let them inquire of any (as-yet religiously-
uninstructed) four-year-old: for he will surely know,
and tell them.

Atheism is not organized, is 100% personal, does not have a creed, and
presumes to answer only one question; &quot;Is there a god?&quot;.  An atheist
who answers any other question, is speaking for himself, and not for
atheism.

Great point.

Religious people in our prisons may reflect a psychological
need for repentance.

Rather, that proves that sin is universal. Sin affects both
those with a religous ideal, and those without it, who deny
the need for any religion at all. Sin is captivity to our
human nature and its tendency to do the wrong thing.

Since sin universally affects all, it applies in every
situation as well, even among the religious. Naturally, if
sin can cause greedy advertisers to manipulate people to eat
more than they should, then preachers can also be tempted to
manipulate for purposes of pride and power.

Apparently some Muslim parents missed your naturally endowed
sense of right and wrong. They teach their children to
become good little terrorist martyrs.

Tell that to those people who grow up to be terrorists.
Maybe they'll listen to you.

How one &quot;naturally&quot; determines what instincts he should follow, comes
from the natural law of self preservation, and is simply weighing the
risks against the advantages.  Religion has unnaturally taken
advantage of the natural law of self preservation, by making
everlasting hell the ultimate risk, and everlasting heaven the
ultimate advantage, and then defining good and bad.

Many years ago I studied the works of BF Skinner, the
behaviorist who thought we were all a product of positive or
negative consequences. We take the &quot;path with the least
resistance.&quot; Although there's a large amount of truth in
this, I can't see that the warning of Hell should elicit in
us any great fear of the hereafter if it doesn't really have
any practical impact on the present world.

Nobody can &quot;make&quot; heaven and hell the ultimate consequence.
There has to be some psychological frame of mind that
actually commends to people that this is a likely scenario.
Otherwise, we would treat it all like Santa Claus, as myth.
