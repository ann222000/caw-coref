5 And he had hope to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding the many
revelations and the many things which I had seen concerning these things;
for I truly had seen angels, and they had ministered unto me. And also, I
had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to
time; wherefore, I could not be shaken.  Jacob 7:5

EVIDENCE AND A PROPHECY

What evidence do you have that what I have declared through the agency of
the Holy Ghost, which is my constant companion by ordinance and by right, is
not true? I have your word only, for behold ye do not know, neither do you
consider your own consciences or minds, and reflect upon them. Behold, you
have no evidence, but I have the written testimony of all these, my
brethren, the Prophets of Israel, as testimony, and I have the testimony of
thunderings and lightnings which shall streak forth, and I have the
testimony of the earth which shall move to and fro as a drunken man in that
day, and I have the testimony of a voice which shook the ground upon which I
stood, and I have also the testimony of the Holy Ghost which dwelleth within
me to the confounding of the world, and death and hell, and the wicked and
unbelievers and scoffers, and I have the ministration of angels, one of
which hurled the Green Beret onto his back unhurt, and I have the testimony
of being removed from my body to behold His face, and I have the testimony
of speaking in the Adamic tongue for upwards of an hour while conversing
with Him in the Spirit of the Most High, and I have the testimony of my
laying my hands upon the Heroin addict whose heart was pure and who was
humble and desired a witness after baptism by immersion at my hands, and him
receiving in great power, the Holy Ghost and exclaiming aloud while under
the power thereof, and I have the testimony of laying my hands upon the sick
and they being healed, and I have the testimony of casting the devils out of
a young woman afflicted therewith and seeing with my own eyes them as they
left her in a fury, and departed, and the testimony of revelations and the
Spirit of Prophecy and the Spirit of Administration and Knowledge and Power.
And now what is it that you have against me? Nothing, save it be your word
only and your evil hearts of unbelief and darkness and confusion of mind and
the collective testimony of others like unto yourselves upon whom each of
you lean for support in your wickedness before the Lord. Are you not ripe
for destruction at the hands of the mighty ones who shall be unleashed by
the hand of Jehovah in that day, saith the Lord God, of Israel? Yea what
meanest thou, O man? Am I, the Lord God not able to discern between my
righteous servant and thy wickedness, O man, that ye perish because of
unbelief, and he be saved up into my presence? For I, a man, say unto you in
the name of the Most High who hath spoken unto me that you all shall be
destroyed by devouring fire, if it is that you repent not of your unbelief
and wickedness in these things and come down in the depths of humility and
be baptized for a remission of sins, and then go to with thy might to build
Zion. For you are possessed of a lying spirit and you have put off the
Spirit of God, that the evil one has power over you to carry you about this
way and that according as he will, with your false religions and other
traditions that are false and your evolution which you think frees you to
lift your head in wickedness and deny the God that made you, and your false
prophets whom ye sustain in your churches, and your lying newsmen who write
lies to get gain, I say unto you in the heat and passion of my soul, that
you have caused a great curse to come upon the land, and have caused my God
to speak unto me that I should come out unto you and prophesy of a great
evil which shall befall the inhabitants of this land, except they repent. I
say unto you in the name of Messiah, that if you will put off your sins and
humble yourselves before me who hath been sent unto you with a message from
your Creator, that you shall each of you receive the Holy Ghost and each of
you shall behold for yourselves that the way of which I speak, which is
straight and narrow, which leads unto the Eternal Lives is true. If any man
know of my doctrine, whether it be of me or of the Father, let him live it.
And not only these things, but the motion of the earth and the planets which
move in their regular orbits and seasons, all denote that there is a God.

Jacob  7:5
5 And he had hope to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding the many
revelations and the many things which I had seen concerning these things;
for I truly had seen angels, and they had ministered unto me. And also, I
had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to
time; wherefore, I could not be shaken.

Elder Adney Y. Komatsu, Looking to the Savior, Ensign (CR), May 1987, p.78
Throughout the thousand years of Book of Mormon history, many prophets bore
solemn witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ as the Son of God, of His
premortal godhood, of His earthly ministryHis suffering, His death, His
resurrectionand of the plan of salvation by which we can make His atonement
effective in our lives. These prophets spoke from pure knowledge, knowledge
that came by personal visitations of the Savior to them, by the testimony of
angels who spoke with them, by visions, and by the power of the Holy Ghost.
They knew whereof they spoke and could not be shaken from their testimonies.
And he had hope to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding the many
revelations and the many things which I had seen concerning these things;
for I truly had seen angels, and they had ministered unto me. And also, I
had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to
time; wherefore, I could not be shaken (Jacob 7:5).

Book of Mormon Reference Companion1
The final chapter recounts Jacob's confron-tation with Sherem, a powerful
speaker who had convinced many that the doctrine of Christ was blasphemy,
that it perverted the &quot;right way of God&quot; as embodied in the law of Moses,
and that no man could know the future, including the predicted birth of
Christ (Jacob 7:7). But Jacob could not be shaken, for he had &quot;seen angels,&quot;
&quot;heard the voice of the Lord,&quot; and felt pro-phe-cies of Christ confirmed &quot;by
the power of the Holy Ghost&quot; (Jacob 7:5, 12). He so testified to Sherem, who
was smitten by God and died, after first publicly recanting his lies. The
people then repented and turned again to God and the scriptures.

John Taylor, The Government of God, p.106
&quot;This is one of the most important subjects upon which the human mind can
contemplate; and one perhaps as little understood, in the present age, as
any other now lying over the face of prophecy. But however neglected at the
present time, it was once the ground-work of the faith, hope, and joy of the
Saints. It was a correct understanding of this subject, and firm belief in
it, that influenced all their movements. Their minds once fastening upon it,
they could not be shaken from their purposes; their faith was firm, their
joy constant, and their hope like an anchor to the soul, both sure and
stedfast, reaching to that within the veil. It was this that enabled them to
rejoice in the midst of tribulation, persecution, sword, and flame; and in
view of this, they took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, and gladly
wandered as strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they sought a country,
a city, and an inheritance, that none but a Saint ever thought of,
understood, or even hoped for.

Jeffrey R. Holland, Christ and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of
the Book of Mormon, p.60
In every way Jacob was a worthy successor to Nephi and a
[pagebreak]well-prepared witness to Christ's divine role in Book of Mormon
times and teachings. As he would later say to the anti-Christ Sherem about
the divine knowledge and variety of evidence he had received, &quot;I truly had
seen angels, and they had ministered unto me. And also, I had heard the
voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to time;
wherefore, I could not be shaken. . . .

Bruce R. McConkie, The Promised Messiah: The First Coming of Christ, p.502
Those of Israel who, by the time Jesus began his ministry, had not been
scattered among all people and on the isles of the sea; those who then dwelt
in their promised Canaan and in Jerusalem, the city of the Great King; those
who then looked for the coming of a Messiah, to save and deliver and redeem;
those who considered themselves to be the chosen people and who looked upon
all others as outside the pale of saving grace; those to whom the Messiah
did in fact come and by whom he was summarily rejected-this race and
assemblage of people believed, with a fixity and determination that could
not be shaken, that their Messiah would come to save them, and them alone,
and that for the Gentiles there was no hope. In their darkened state they
failed utterly to understand the Messianic utterances relative to salvation
going to the Gentiles, and of the Messiah being the God of the whole earth
and not of them only. It is to this concept and to these scriptures that we
will now give attention.

Neal A. Maxwell, We Talk of Christ, We Rejoice in Christ, p.144
JEFFREY: As we talk, it seems important to note that when one's conversion
is full, one is also anchored in a base of valid, personal spiritual

The lack of objective evidence that it IS true.  It's really that
simple - you make an existentially positive assertion, you bear the
burden of proof.  You have yet to meet that burden.

Remember - OBJECTIVE evidence that it's OBJECTIVELY true.

Art doesn't need to harm anyone, his words and ideas are powerful enough.
The truth cuts its own weight. As the saying goes, the pen is mightier than
the sword.

Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Section Four 1839-42 Pg.205
The world always mistook false prophets for true ones, and those that
were sent of God, they considered to be false prophets and hence they
killed, stoned, punished and imprisoned the true prophets, and these had to
hide themselves &quot;in deserts and dens, and caves of the earth,&quot; and though
the most honorable men of the earth, they banished them from their society
as vagabonds, whilst they cherished, honored and supported knaves,
vagabonds, hypocrites, impostors, and the basest of men.

Testimony is acceptable evidence for gullible people only. Let me ask
you this; Charles Manson's followers gave testimony that he was
innocent. By your reasoning, Charles Manson was innocent just because
they gave testimony to that effect. How could anyone ever decide a
court case with your approach? You'd have to believe BOTH sides,
because both sides are giving testimony.

Why should I believe your testimony and not the testimony of the
Manson family? The evidence you both supply to support your testimony
is equally non-existent. In face, the Manson family's claims were way
LESS unbelievable than your testimony, because you are invoking the
supernatural. At least Charles Manson exists.

If I were you, I'd rethink just about everything if I were shown to
have less credibility than the Manson Family.

Comparing Charles Manson to Art is like comparing apples with oranges. Just
because some testimonies are false doesn't make every testimony false. You

He's not.  He's examining the utility of testimony.

If testimony is sufficient to reach conclusions, then the testimony of
those around Manson is sufficient to conclude Manson is innocent.  If we
want to treat Manson as anything other than innocent, we implicitly argue
that testimony is *not* sufficient to conclude much, as we are regarding
him as guilty *despite* testimony to the contrary, meaning we are
disregarding or discounting the testimony.

Prov 28:1
1 THE wicked flee when no man pursueth...
More slander from a wicked corrupt reprobate minded fool.

From another post to a reprobate who wondered at being correctly labeled
&quot;wicked&quot;:

Because the &quot;reprobate mind&quot; which is the foundation of liberalism currently
afflicts 50% of the population of the US and threatens the country with
destruction should they obtain a majority, fool.

21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God,
neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their
foolish heart was darkened.
22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like
to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping
things. 24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts
of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 25
Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the
creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. 26 For this
cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change
the natural use into that which is against nature: 27 And likewise also the
men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward
another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in
themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as
they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to
a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 29 Being
filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness,
maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil
things, disobedient to parents, 31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers,
without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 32 Who knowing the
judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not
only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

(Rom 1:21-32)

Like I said before, every testimony has to be judged case by case. In Art's
testimony like in any testimony, you have to use you’re intelligence, common
sense to evaluate the sincerity of his words. For example, if someone tells
you of a situation where is accused of a crime like robbery and he tells you
he didn't do it, you're likely to carefully consider and contemplate his
words to come up with a conclusion which might be &quot;I don't know&quot; or &quot;I think
he's telling the truth but I can't say for sure&quot; or &quot;I don't believe him but
I can't say for sure&quot; and not just shut your ears and say &quot;I don't believe
you!&quot; In Art's testimony, it is meant to provoke thought in the reader's
mind, to be honest with himself and reflect upon his words. Someone might
read it and think he could be speaking the truth but I can't say for
certainty. For those who feel that way I suggest if they are interested it
to go to his website: www.artbulla.com and investigate more. Personally, I
know Art's testimony is true having been witnessed by the Holy Ghost.

Uh huh. And when somone claims, as you and Art and millions of other
do, that a gigantic super duper being exists and that he made the
enture universe, yet no one has ever seen nor heard him, and that
apparently he is going to torture me for eternity, well, that is WAY
more dubious than the Manson Family claiming old Charlie didn't do
anything.

Here's a quote from Carl Sagan, you ought to think about it for a
minute. &quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.&quot; To say
that God exists is just about the most extraordinary claim I've ever
heard. Go back and read what Kelsey wrote about testimonials, it is
superb. Testimonials are not compelling evidence. You may think Art
Bulla is godlike, but to me, he's just another lunatic with a
Messianic Complex. Until you give us more than the usual theist rants
(Art's speaches are a dime a dozen), you've got nothing. Less than
nothing, because other people are offering devastatingly convincing
evidence that the universe does not need god to exist.

So you give testimony that Art's testimony about the testimony of a
bunch of ancient goat herders believing in a God is true? You ought to

Judged _how_?  Oh, right, by seeing whether it holds up to objective

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost, which is my constant companion by ordinance and by
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; right,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not true?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; You have no evidence that it IS true. THAT'S the problem. YOU need to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; back your claims up with valid (and testimonials aren't valid)
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; evidence; it's not up to anyone else to do your work for you. Start
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; with the Holy Ghost. You says he's within you...where? In your head?
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Is he invisible? How does he communicate with you? By telepathy?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *snip tedious stream of unconciousness rant*

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course you have your head so far up your ass with Darwinism, it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; hard
&gt;&gt;&gt; for you to see the truth in Art's words. I have a testimony that Art is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; true Prophet from the Spirit.

&gt;&gt; Testimony is acceptable evidence for gullible people only. Let me ask
&gt;&gt; you this; Charles Manson's followers gave testimony that he was
&gt;&gt; innocent. By your reasoning, Charles Manson was innocent just because
&gt;&gt; they gave testimony to that effect. How could anyone ever decide a
&gt;&gt; court case with your approach? You'd have to believe BOTH sides,
&gt;&gt; because both sides are giving testimony.

&gt;&gt; Why should I believe your testimony and not the testimony of the
&gt;&gt; Manson family? The evidence you both supply to support your testimony
&gt;&gt; is equally non-existent. In face, the Manson family's claims were way
&gt;&gt; LESS unbelievable than your testimony, because you are invoking the
&gt;&gt; supernatural. At least Charles Manson exists.

&gt;&gt; If I were you, I'd rethink just about everything if I were shown to
&gt;&gt; have less credibility than the Manson Family.

&gt;Comparing Charles Manson to Art is like comparing apples with oranges. Just
&gt;because some testimonies are false doesn't make every testimony false. You
&gt;have to take it case by case. Art's testimony is very well reasoned and
&gt;coherent. He is not corrupt like Charles Manson.

Aaaah, that is the crux of the matter.  Such &quot;testimonies&quot; are a dime
a dozen, telling truth OR lies.  Therefore they are NOT proof of
anything.

&gt;&gt;Well in the case of the testimony of Mansons' followers, a legitimate
&gt;&gt;testimony of his innonence in court would be like where was he at time of
&gt;&gt;the murder, what was he doing, the quality of his character, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just because some testimonies are false doesn't make every testimony
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; false.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't.  However, we see - from Manson's case, at the least - that
&gt;&gt;&gt; testimony is insufficient to reach a valid conclusion.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Many such examples exist.  Take a typical rape case, which often comes
&gt;&gt;&gt; down to little more than he said/she said.  She can testify until she is
&gt;&gt;&gt; blue in the face, but lacking other support for her claim, it is (or
&gt;&gt;&gt; should be) insufficient to charge him.  She could be mistaken, for
&gt;&gt;&gt; example, about who actually did it.  Or she could have a personal reason
&gt;&gt;&gt; to want to penalize him.  Or any of a dozen other things.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You - or Art - can &quot;testify&quot; all day long that you're prophets or the
&gt;&gt;&gt; second coming or the Kings of Spain and not a bit of it matters, as in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; end all it means is &quot;cuz you say so&quot; which is hardly a compelling basis
&gt;&gt;&gt; for anyone to accept the statements.

&gt;&gt;Like I said before, every testimony has to be judged case by case. In Art's
&gt;&gt;testimony like in any testimony, you have to use you’re intelligence, common
&gt;&gt;sense to evaluate the sincerity of his words.

&gt;In other words, the value of the testimony is not in the testimony of
&gt;itself, but in the intelligence and common sense of the hearer?

&gt;You and your puppet-master bulla &quot;testify&quot; that the bom is true and
&gt;that joe smith was a prophet.

Which differs in what way from Christians &quot;testifying&quot; that the Bible
is true and Abraham (assuming he even existed) was a prophet?

Christians are quick to find fault with those they see as following a
&quot;false&quot; religion, yet they never seem to grasp the fact that to an
outside observer with no vested interest in *any* religion, the same
criticisms apply equally to them. It *does* figure.

Yes, Bulla and Kim *are* morons, and they *are* preaching false
beliefs. But there is not one shred of real, objective evidence that
the Christian's beliefs are any more true.

Just because God has not shown Himself to YOU does not mean He doesn't
exist. Many people have testimonies that God exists. Many people have felt
the power of the Holy Spirit which you have no evidence He doesn't exists.

To say that God doesn't exists is about the most extraordinary claim I've
ever heard. To think this planet earth and human life happened by accident
is like saying a computer built itself without a creator. Just think about
how wonderful the earth is in its design, how conducive to living for humans
it is, with its oxygen, water, animals, fruits and vegetation , etc. Think
about the complexity of the human body and you want the public to believe
evolution made this happen by accident. Yeah, right. The only extraordinary
claim I see is Darwinism. No transitional fossils have been found which
should be everywhere. Even Darwin said he was puzzled by the lack of
intermediary fossils but he said he hoped they would be discovered in the
future.

&gt; nothing, because other people are offering devastatingly convincing

&gt;&gt; In Art's testimony, it is meant to provoke thought in the reader's

&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; to go to his website: www.artbulla.comand investigate more. Personally, I

&gt; Just as I would if he didn't say anything.  Or one might look at the

&gt;&gt; for sure&quot; and not just shut your ears and say &quot;I don't believe you!&quot; In
&gt;&gt; Art's testimony, it is meant to provoke thought in the reader's mind

&gt; It doesn't; it is gibberish.  I've read too much of it already.  It is

&gt;&gt; his website: www.artbulla.com and investigate more. Personally, I know
&gt;&gt; Art's testimony is true having been witnessed by the Holy Ghost.

&gt; See, we tend to like our conclusions to be derived from things

Many have felt the Spirit and have witnessed miracles and visited by angels.

11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which
is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which
is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
spiritual.
14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for

EVOLUTION DOES NOT EQUAL ACCIDENT. You've been told this dozens of
times, and you keep saying it anyway. So, the next time you say it,
you will officialy be lying. Okay?

It IS extraordinary, but there IS evidence (and plenty of it), and ALL
fossils are transitional. Evolution is absolutely amazing, and it's
too bad you have your head so far up Art's ass you can't see the
beauty of the NATURAL world.

Try to keep up with modern thinking. If Darwin said that, then it is

&gt;  Go back and read what Kelsey wrote about testimonials, it is

&gt; &gt; superb. Testimonials are not compelling evidence. You may think Art
&gt; &gt; Bulla is godlike, but to me, he's just another lunatic with a
&gt; &gt; Messianic Complex. Until you give us more than the usual theist rants
&gt; &gt; (Art's speaches are a dime a dozen), you've got nothing. Less than
&gt; &gt; nothing, because other people are offering devastatingly convincing
&gt; &gt; evidence that the universe does not need god to exist.

&gt; &gt;&gt; In Art's testimony, it is meant to provoke thought in the reader's
&gt; &gt;&gt; mind, to be honest with himself and reflect upon his words. Someone might
&gt; &gt;&gt; read it and think he could be speaking the truth but I can't say for
&gt; &gt;&gt; certainty. For those who feel that way I suggest if they are interested
&gt; &gt;&gt; it
&gt; &gt;&gt; to go to his website: www.artbulla.comandinvestigate more. Personally, I
&gt; &gt;&gt; know Art's testimony is true having been witnessed by the Holy Ghost.

&gt; &gt; So you give testimony that Art's testimony about the testimony of a
&gt; &gt; bunch of ancient goat herders believing in a God is true? You ought to
&gt; &gt; go find a more gullible audience than atheists, it isn't working out
&gt; &gt; for you here.

&gt; Well, I know it was a stretch to make a ax grinding agenda driven atheists
&gt; like yourself to have an open mind about Art's testimony but hopefully there
&gt; will be others with a more open mind.

">

Most Christians who do so offer EVIDENCE when asked.  EVIDENCE and
SUBSTANCE can be found.  Many of the persons, places and events
recorded in the Bible can be found in secular writings of the times.
The Bible itself comes from multiple sources.

Coins with the likenesses of persons the Bible was written about,
archaeological evidence of many of the events have been found.
THOUSANDS of documents, some as early as the first century have been
found, verifying that Jesus and His followers did exist and a few
things about them.

NO SUCH EVIDENCE EXISTS FOR THE BOOK OF MORMON.  joe smith  is the
ONLY &quot;evidence&quot; that even one person, place, or event in the bom ever
existed in reality, and his writings contradict the Bible (which HE
said is the &quot;word of God&quot;) and contradict each other.

That is a few ways they are different.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

As I pointed out above, EVIDENCE.

But the question being discussed here is not the authenticity of the
Bible OR the book of momon.  It is the validity of using &quot;testimony&quot;
as &quot;proof of authenticity&quot; or &quot;proof of reality.&quot;

And as we have shown, such &quot;testimony&quot; does not prove anything.  As
someone else posted, manson would have testified that he was a fine
fellow.  If his &quot;testimony&quot; is proof, then manson MUST HAVE BEEN a
fine fellow. . .except he wasn't/

What you have yet to do is demonstrate that the HS even exists _to_ be

Once you do that, then we can examine whether or not a given feeling,

All possible interpretations of a religious testimony are themselves
merely more religious testimony, and so cannot clarify to any degree

Who would that be?  We're sitting here eyes wide open, willing to examine
pretty much anything you bring to the table.  All we are *not* willing to
do is treat something as objective when it isn't.

We treat gods like we treat a new notion in science: we say &quot;Put up or
shut up&quot;.  Show us the evidence.  If it stands up to critical examination,
we tentatively accept the premise.  If it doesn't stand up, we discard the
premise.

So far, the theists have not presented one single thing which stands up to
critical analysis.  That's a pretty damned poor record, when you think
about it.  All the millions of theists - billions, even, if we include all
religions, all branches - and all the years, decades, even millennia
they've had to come up with something, and in all of that, they still have
not one single objective thing to show in support of their beliefs.

Put that into perspective.  One source I've seen says there are about 2.1
billion Christians in the world.  Let's lower that a bit; let's call it
2 billion, and go back, oh, 10 years - that is, let's assume there have
been, on average, 2 billion Christians in the world for each of the last
ten years.

That means that between them, they've had 20,000,000,000 man-years in
which to come up with a single objective piece of evidence supporting
their views.  20 billion man-years, and a total effectiveness of *zero*.

You would think that after 20 billion man-years' worth of combined effort,
most folks would stop and consider that maybe, just maybe, there really
isn't all that much there in the first place, maybe, just maybe, the whole
thing is a crock.

Yet still they believe, despite this, hoping against hope someone,
somewhere, will come up with something to justify their beliefs... and they
have the nerve to call *us* &quot;blind&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If testimony is sufficient to reach conclusions, then the testimony of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those around Manson is sufficient to conclude Manson is innocent.  If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want to treat Manson as anything other than innocent, we implicitly

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that testimony is *not* sufficient to conclude much, as we are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regarding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him as guilty *despite* testimony to the contrary, meaning we are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disregarding or discounting the testimony.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well in the case of the testimony of Mansons' followers, a legitimate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;testimony of his innonence in court would be like where was he at time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the murder, what was he doing, the quality of his character, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just because some testimonies are false doesn't make every testimony
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; false.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't.  However, we see - from Manson's case, at the least -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; testimony is insufficient to reach a valid conclusion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many such examples exist.  Take a typical rape case, which often comes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; down to little more than he said/she said.  She can testify until she
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blue in the face, but lacking other support for her claim, it is (or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should be) insufficient to charge him.  She could be mistaken, for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example, about who actually did it.  Or she could have a personal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reason
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to want to penalize him.  Or any of a dozen other things.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You - or Art - can &quot;testify&quot; all day long that you're prophets or the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; second coming or the Kings of Spain and not a bit of it matters, as in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; end all it means is &quot;cuz you say so&quot; which is hardly a compelling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; basis
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for anyone to accept the statements.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Like I said before, every testimony has to be judged case by case. In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Art's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;testimony like in any testimony, you have to use you're intelligence,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;common
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sense to evaluate the sincerity of his words.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, the value of the testimony is not in the testimony of
&gt;&gt;&gt; itself, but in the intelligence and common sense of the hearer?

&gt;&gt;I'm saying in order to interpret a testimony, it require intelligence,
&gt;&gt;Checker. Boy, Art was right. It's hard to take someone seriously with a
&gt;&gt;name
&gt;&gt;like yours. LOL.

&gt; If YOU aren't willing to &quot;check&quot; things out, I am sorry for you.  The
&gt; Bible says:

Joseph Smith expounded on the mysteries of God that none of your sectarian
ministers ever could answer. All these ministers of your stripe could say is
well we cannot know the mysteries of God. Through Joseph Smith, we learned
that mankind had spirit bodies in a life called the Pre-existence before
taking up mortal bodies and that we will go into the spirit world after
death (proved over a 100 years later by Gentiles who started to learn about
near death out of body experiences), and that there are three levels of
heavens in the resurrection. Didn't Paul say that he once knew a man who was
caught up in THIRD heaven and saw things unspeakable (2 Cor. 12: 2)? Didn't
Paul talk about there being a glory like the stars, terrestrial glory like
unto the moon and a celestial glory like unto the sun in the resurrection (1
Cor. 15:40)? All of this is in the Bible and Joseph Smith expounded on these
doctrines by revelation from God, things that your ministers never talk

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Comparing Charles Manson to Art is like comparing apples with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oranges.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He's not.  He's examining the utility of testimony.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If testimony is sufficient to reach conclusions, then the testimony of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those around Manson is sufficient to conclude Manson is innocent.  If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want to treat Manson as anything other than innocent, we implicitly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; argue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that testimony is *not* sufficient to conclude much, as we are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regarding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him as guilty *despite* testimony to the contrary, meaning we are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disregarding or discounting the testimony.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well in the case of the testimony of Mansons' followers, a legitimate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;testimony of his innonence in court would be like where was he at time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the murder, what was he doing, the quality of his character, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just because some testimonies are false doesn't make every testimony
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; false.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't.  However, we see - from Manson's case, at the least -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; testimony is insufficient to reach a valid conclusion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many such examples exist.  Take a typical rape case, which often comes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; down to little more than he said/she said.  She can testify until she
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blue in the face, but lacking other support for her claim, it is (or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should be) insufficient to charge him.  She could be mistaken, for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example, about who actually did it.  Or she could have a personal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reason
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to want to penalize him.  Or any of a dozen other things.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You - or Art - can &quot;testify&quot; all day long that you're prophets or the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; second coming or the Kings of Spain and not a bit of it matters, as in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; end all it means is &quot;cuz you say so&quot; which is hardly a compelling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; basis
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for anyone to accept the statements.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Like I said before, every testimony has to be judged case by case. In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Art's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;testimony like in any testimony, you have to use you're intelligence,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;common
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sense to evaluate the sincerity of his words.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, the value of the testimony is not in the testimony of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself, but in the intelligence and common sense of the hearer?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm saying in order to interpret a testimony, it require intelligence,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Checker. Boy, Art was right. It's hard to take someone seriously with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;name
&gt;&gt;&gt;like yours. LOL.

&gt;&gt; If YOU aren't willing to &quot;check&quot; things out, I am sorry for you.  The
&gt;&gt; Bible says:

&gt;&gt; 1 Thess 5:19-22
&gt;&gt; 19 Do not quench the Spirit. 20 Do not despise prophecies. 21 Test all
&gt;&gt; things; hold fast what is good. 22 Abstain from every form of evil.
&gt;&gt; NKJV

&gt;&gt; I checked the false writings of joe smith out many years ago.  I'll
&gt;&gt; follow the Bible.

&gt;&gt; You can follow bulla, but I will stick to the God of the Bible.  HE is
&gt;&gt; never wrong, as bulla and joe smith are wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You and your puppet-master bulla &quot;testify&quot; that the bom is true and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that joe smith was a prophet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MANY MANY MANY of us Christians have testified the OPPOSITE, having
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read smith's fiction and compared it to the TRUTH, the Bible and found
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smith's fiction sadly wanting.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Art's teachings are in harmony with past prophets. Yours doesn't.

&gt;&gt; Try again.  Art's teachings are based on bastardizations of joe
&gt;&gt; smith's teachings which were false doctrines, according to the Bible,
&gt;&gt; making both of them FALSE prophets.

&gt;&gt; You may follow bulla, but I will stick to the God of the Bible

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If anything, that demonstrates that you and bulla are of a LOWER

All of those made-up &quot;spirit bodies,&quot; the so-called &quot;pre-existance,&quot;

Yep.  And if joe smith had known anything about the Hebrew beliefs, he
would have known that the first heaven was the sky, the second heaven
was the sun, moon, and stars, and the third heaven was where God

Glory = AN ADJECTIVE, NOT A VERB.  Joe smith didn't know his grammar

Because he's being dishonest. The cornered theist pretends &quot;you can't

He doesn't fool anybody, not even himself - and just demonstrates his
dishonesty.

If he were able to provide the same level of evidence for his pretend

point.

But he can't and he hasn't.

What I suspect he doesn't understand, is that this kind of cop out

All we want is objective evidence for his pretend friend. Actually
_we_ don't - he needs it. We just want him to realise he has none so
he shouldn't beg the question he dishonestly cops out of answering.

But instead he does a bait'n'switch to an impossibly high standard of
proof that starts from solipsism, about something that isn't even in

He thinks he is being clever but in reality he doesn't even fool
