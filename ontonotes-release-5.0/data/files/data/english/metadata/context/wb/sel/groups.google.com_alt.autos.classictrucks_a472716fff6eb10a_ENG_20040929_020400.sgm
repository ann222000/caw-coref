My grandfather just got in an accident in is 1996 Dodge Ram 1500 and pretty
much totalled the truck. The thing is that he just recently put new tires
on it and the insurance agency said that he could switch out those tires for
any other ones as long as it has wheels. Now I own a 1995 Chevy C1500 by
any chance would I be able to use the wheels off his Dodge?

Measure the bolt pattern and offset. If they match, then yes.
