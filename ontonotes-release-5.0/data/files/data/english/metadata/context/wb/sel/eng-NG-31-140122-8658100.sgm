I thought the O looked ok for what it is doing, outside of Chad's two really bad
decisions.
But, to me, the O looks like a continuation of last season.  And to be quite honest, I
won't be unhappy, if Lil Schott gets a HC gig elsewhere, for next season.
I never got a sense of continuity last season... it's like each play he picks from a hat,
rather than each play leading to the next.
I know a lot of people like him, but to this point, I remain unimpressed.

As far as the team, in general, this is about as flat as I've seen the team, since EM has
been here.  It's like they're playing in slow-motion, while the Vikes are playing at NFL
speed.

On the positive side, yhe STs are ready for the season.
I like how Wallace Wright is developing.  If we can find a burner along the way, Cotchery,
Wright, Stuckey, and Coles, are a solid bunch.
We need another RB.  Wade doesn't impress me, nor does the other guy (his name escapes
me).

Burford, were you really happy with the O Line? Brick whiffed big time
on one of Chad's interceptions. While Chad was in, I didn't see holes

Easy to come to that assessment when you take the worst as a portend
of things to come. The Jets were pretty bad last preseason. And the
last time the Jets went 4-0 in the preseason (2002), they were AWFUL
in September. Just brutal. They would have gone 0-4 in September if
not for 2 Chad Morton returns in Buffalo.

In a way, I'm happy they had a game like this in the preseason. Things
were getting a little to cheery around the Jets, especially with the
recent &quot;Jets could make Giants irrelevant&quot; article. Hopefully this
game serves a shock to the system of the Jets players, causing them to
put the press clippings away and work on fixing the mistakes.
Pennington is not a QB who makes those kinds of mistakes. Neither INT
should have been thrown - Sharper was sitting right in the middle of
the field and Greenway was locked in on Washington out of the
backfield. It has nothing to do with an injury, and those passes had
nothing to do with arm strength - you don't throw those passes with
Brett Favre's arm.

The most distressing thing for me is the run defense. I'm starting to
lose patience with Robertson, especially when I constantly read and
hear about the &quot;great&quot; job he did last year. Huh ? The Jets were 32nd
in the league in DVOA run defense. And 32nd the year before that. It's
not all his fault, but he's certainly one of the primary culprits.
I've defended him in the past, but only because I found it ridiculous
that some Jets fans wanted to absolve Jonathan Vilma of any blame.

I can't believe how many Jets fans believe the pass-rush is the most
concerning aspect of the defense this preseason. The Jets have rarely
blitzed thus far, and they're a team which blitzed when they had Hank
Poteat starting last December. I saw a stat which had the Jets sending
the second most 7 man blitzes in the NFL last season. Now, with a
healthy Barrett and Revis, they're certainly going to have more
confidence in coming after the QB. And Ellis looks better this year.

Nope... did I mention I was?
At the point I wrote this, while the O wasn't great, it was consistently moving down
field, except for Chad's brainlocks.
I mentioned the positives I saw.  I'd add Nugent, who does seem to be kicking longer.

I remember that.  Still... Herm's undefeated preseason and what followed
wasnt nearly as bad as what followed another &quot;perfect&quot; preseason. I charge
the biggest idiot in NY Jets history for that; Bruce Coslet. Back in 1992,
the so called &quot;offensive genious&quot; himself  said &quot;he wanted to get the Jets
used to winning games&quot;. With his pet project Browning Nagle at the helm and
Ken O'Brien sitting on the bench, the Jets go 5-0 in the preseason.  When
the regular season started, fans were treated to some of the worst football
in NY Jets history.  The Jets drop their first two games.  Their third game
in line is agaisnt a solid SF 49'ers team.  The idiot head himself, Bruce
Coslet speaks to the media and &quot;guarantees a win against SF.&quot;  It turns out
that he's no Joe Willie.  SF pounds the Jets convincingly and Coslet spends
the entire time on the sidelines with a smirk on his face.

All of us know that wins and losses in the preseason count for little as far
as assessing what is to come in the regular season. It is way more important
to get a look at the individual plays.  If the Jets loose a preseason game,
but an untested player like Stucky makea some great grabs for the ball or
your new LB from MI makes some solid tackles, then you had a great game.  If
the other team gets a TD because your o guard is trying to snap the ball and
he shoots it into the stands, you had a good game.  You know that you cant
try that one in the regular season.

Three defensive TDs allowed can make any team look flat, no matter how
fired up they are.

Interesting note - Chad's 2nd INT was something teams tried to bait
him into all last season, but he didn't fall for once. Opposing
defenses tried to bait him into throwing that swing pass, and he very
rarely (if ever) threw it. New England gave up a lot of 3rd down
conversions in that 2nd game because they were waiting for him to
throw that pass.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Keep it up... I'm going to shuv Gefilte fish up your ass.  You've got

&gt;&gt; of course! Anti-semitism and pats fans.... perfect together.

&gt; Personally, I prefer red horseradish with my gefilte fish and prefer

My younger sister makes awesome gifilte fish. Every passover she makes up a
batch from scratch.  This year one of their cats, Pinkey nabbed an entire
gifilte fish.  He cased the kitchen area and made his move.  Jumped up on
the counter, grabbed one and ran off with it  He made moves like Barry
Sanders to get that gifilte !

What's his address?  I'll send him mine from future Seders.  Gefilte
fish...  Gross!
And I love sea food, but that minced up mess of different fish,
including all the crappy parts of the fish that nobody in their right
mind should eat is just horrendouos.

I understand where yer comin' from, Tut.
But sometimes, I don't want to *hurt the feelings* of my host, and have forced it down.
I like horseradish, so I pile it on... then I *wash* it down with more horseradish.
Works for me ;)
