Could there have been any affect on the posters to

the Doctor shown some evenings when they had
nothing else to watch?  Would they never have become

Don't think it will have much affect on this news group, given there's
little alt-history in Doctor Who (they gave up on real historical
stories after 'Highlanders' in the mid 60's). Now, having DW be a one
season show on the BBC will have some interesting knock offs as far as
the UK goes.

Been reading the "About Time" books, which go into detail about the
creation of each episode and more importantly the context of the UK at
that time. Fun stuff, although the writers hatred towards producer JNT
makes me wary of the upcoming 6th volume :) Anyways, the show DID
almost end early: while the original plan was for Doctor Who to air
year long (40+ episodes, unheard of!) the production crew wasn't very
confident and the 2 episode third story (Edge of Destruction) was
intended to be the series ender if required as it brought the count up
to the usual 13. They however got an order for another 13, and it went
on from there.

Edge of Destruction is a good story... I did rather enjoy it.

Now the question is what would the impact on UK society have been
without the cybermen etc, would the Borg have appeared (who are a bit of
a steal from them)...

Good question, although presumably that posits an ATL where Doctor Who is
not replaced with an equally popular TV show (obviously a dystopian TL).

Here's the deal, from what I understand: the BBC was only able to air
any episode of a tv series twice. This was due to union and royalties
reasons, and I suspect set up as a way to keep people employed in post
war UK. After all, if there's no re-runs then all the actors and
production people have to stay hired to make more. Each episode was
recorded "live" on a video tape, the recorder being stopped between
scenes as the BBC had no way to actually edit video. Film scenes were
inserted by aiming the video camera at a screen showing the film
footage.
Each tape which held an episode cost £100 in 1963 money, so needed to
be recycled. To create prints for foreign sales, a film camera was
aimed at a high quality tv screen showing an episode to create a film
print. It is these prints that survive.

">

The BBC didn't start destroying film prints until the 70's, after the
market for black and white shows dried up. The first BBC "archive" was
created in the late 70's, and it was then that people noticed that not
only Doctor Who but other shows were missing. Everyone assumed the BBC
was keeping copies, including those working for the BBC. It is true
that all this was stopped when a guy was wandering through a BBC
storage area and saw the last prints of The Daleks with a tag "to be
destroyed" on them. However, we're probably only taking weeks before
someone notices other shows being wiped out once the archive is set up.

There is very little alt-history in Dr. Who because the persistent
theory of that show is that time is paradox proof --- if something has
happened, travelers from the future cannot make it unhappen.

Exceptions to that rule:

The Third Doctor in INFERNO. The friendly faces of the United Nations
Intelligence Taskforce are Fascist Bastards in a dark mirror of the
standard situation. I was disappointed that no effort was made to
explain what Point of Divergence in the past had brought about that
difference world.

The Fourth Doctor in  . . . I am having a senior moment here. He took
Sarah Jane to a world as dead as contemporary Mars, and told her this
was Earth after the Fendahl had played with it. Those are the only
alt-history pieces I recall from Dr. Who.

There have been others. The Doctor goes back and delays the development
of the Daleks, which one assumes changes the entire timeline. It is
interesting, though, how the show went from "don't change history" in
The Aztecs to "interfere, it's what I do best" in later stories.

I think the novelization of INFERNO mentioned something about
the UK's pro-peace/neutrality elements somehow getting the upper
hand around the time of Dunkirk, allowing Hitler to overrun Europe;
shortly afterwards, an indigenous fascist coup succeeded, followed
by the execution of the royal family.

(INFERNO's my favorite DW serial of all time, BTW, with its close
resemblance to Star Trek's Mirror Universe--my favorite continuing
ST storyline.)

recall from Dr. Who.

I take it, then, that you didn't see the two-part episode Rise of
the Cybermen/Age of Steel? In this story arc, the Dave Tennant
Doctor lands in a timeline where Britain's a Republic, run by a
President--as opposed to a Prime Minister--and that age-old
alt-world cliche, the dirigible, is a commonplace sight.
And there's a reference to a "New Germany," but details are
not provided.
However, Cuba Gooding, Jr. still exists in this world; apparently,
some OTL personalities remain unchanged.

(I don't think a POD was mentioned in those episodes; anyone
want to take a shot at it?)

There's a 1990s DOCTOR WHO novel (7th Doc), by Terrance
Dicks, called _Timewyrm: Exodus_ (in the Timewyrm book
series), in which the time-travelling alien villain in the novel's
title assumes mental control of Hitler around the time of the
Munich Beer Hall uprising, changing the direction of his life,
and allowing Germany to pull off a successful Sealion. (As it's
been awhile since I read it, I don't recall details of the invasion.)
Also, Edward the 8th is returned to the monarchy (with Wallis);
in this timeline, he's pro-Nazi (according to the author).

And the 1994 Doctor Who novel, State of Change, by Christo-
pher Bulis, has an ATL in which a triumphant Mark Antony &amp;
Cleopatra merge the Roman &amp; Egyptian regimes.

I had not read the books or seen the most recent season of Dr. Who, so
I've never seen the airship-building British Republic.

Is the existance of Davros an alt-history?

On the YES side of that issue:

The representatives of Gallifrey who came to the Fourth Doctor are very
dismal, and believe that it is not possible for the state of affairs to
end in anything but a Dalek universe -- Daleks are all triumphant and
all life, including the Time Lords, are extinct.

From a perspective centered on Gallifrey, is that not what happened in
the era of the Ninth Doctor?  So maybe that dark future did arrive?

Following the Fourth Doctor's adventure at the dawn of the Daleks, it
looked like  9-tenths of the Daleks efforts were made in opposition to
the plots of their creator. Contending with Davros was the X-factor that
frustrated the other wise inevitable conquest of the universe by Daleks.
Billion might die but trillions survived.

On the NO side of the ledger:

An absence of mention does not show evidence of absence. The Second
Doctor _appears_ to know  nothing of Davros, and the Daleks of his day
never refer to Davros, But maybe if they had been asked the appropriate
questions , all sorts of Davros tales would have been supplied.

The Time War of the Ninth Doctor, the one which for some duration was
thought to have wiped out the Time Lords and the Daleks, might be the
dark future hinted at in the first episodes featuring Davros. That
fortifies the suspicion that no conspicious change has occurred.

At this point there are in parallel dimension rather than an alternative

Ummm.. this is probably not the place for a Doctor Who continuity discussion
[*]... but actually, I seem to recall dialogue in the Tennant story such
that Cybermen are a kind of Universal Meme, and we were watching another
instantiation of that in the alternate universe - i.e. it was not an
alternate explanation for "our" Cybermen.
