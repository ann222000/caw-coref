Two editorial cartoons that amused me today...

http://www.al.com/opinion/birminghamnews/cartoons/032207_stantis.jpg

and...

http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/benson/

I'm still puzzling over the second one... is it defending Gore or
poking ridicule at him?  (It's from the Phoenix Leftist Weenie
newspaper.)

poking ridicule at him.

He's obviously in it for political gain.

At least that's the way I see it.  If your worried about GW then you should
be swayed to do your part and burn some candles.

Don't forget that the reason Gore's home uses 20 times the electric power is
that it HAS electric power. It IS Tennessee you know.

But seriously he buys green energy and pays the costs of that.

That still doesn't mean he should consume 20 times more than a normal

In medieval times this was called "buying indulgences". Rich guys

We are perpetual optimists and "they" are leeching off of our
monetarily irresponsible lower class?

After all, "Brazil" was fiction, no?

How about "Canada"?

Another fiction.

fighting for.

Al managed to get some utility spokesman to claim that his usage was not
particularly out of line for a building the size of his home given its usage
(i.e., lots of entertaining, business meetings, etc.).

I mean, I just can't imagine Al's the kind of guy who doesn't turn off the
lights when he leaves an empty room or doesn't at least give some thought to
setting the A/C at 72 rather than 68, you know?

That being said, Al's response was weak; if I were his advisor, I would have
told him to emphasize how he doesn't have just some huge home -- it's really
much closer to a 24/7 business, where he also happens to live.  You're right
about the "buying indulgences" comparison -- it does nothing to help Al's
cause when he says he's buying green energy, so people shouldn't even
question his energy usage.

Something else  I think that Al believes -- but doesn't want to explicitly
state, for fear of losing his hard-core environmentalist backing -- is that,
if you can afford to do it in an environmentally responsible way, you should
be allowed to drive a huge vehicle, own a huge house, etc.  I.e., he's *not*
about trying to ban "living large" -- as someone like Jim probably does by
many a leftist-environmentalist's judgment -- but rather trying to get
regulations in place that will let the planet keep on going without altering
people's standards of living.  The very fact that Al does routinely go
jet-setting about and has a huge home gives credence to that idea -- and you
don't see him attacking, e.g., Bush for having his huge Texas ranch either.

From activism to energy-efficiency: Al Gore's top tips for saving the
planet

1. Insist that politicians in all parties make this planetary
emergency their top priority; this is crucial

2. Think about conservation and efficiency in the way you use
resources in your own life, eg:

· drive less (every mile not driven saves one pound of CO2)

· fly less

· recycle more

· keep your tyres properly inflated

· use less hot water

· use a clothesline instead of a tumble-dryer

· insulate your home

· avoid products with a lot of packaging

· turn down the thermostat by 2C

· plant a tree (one tree absorbs one tonne of CO2 over its lifetime)

· turn off electronic devices when they are not in use

3. Be a conscious consumer with regard to everything you buy, both in
the marketplace and in the investments you make, eg:

· switch to green power

· buy locally grown food, and organic where possible

· buy fresh food over frozen

· buy less meat

· offset your impact on the planet's resources by investing in
renewable energy projects For more information go to
climatecrisis.net.

Al sure doesn't look, lately, that he's been eating less meat. I
wonder if Tipper really pins his laundry to a clothesline. "Fly less"
is funny.

Maybe a roast meal is burnt food in your book but even the French approve of it.
