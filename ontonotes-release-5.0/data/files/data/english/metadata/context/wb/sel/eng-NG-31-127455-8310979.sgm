TWO decades ago, Thanh Ta and his family fled war-torn South Vietnam
packed in a small boat with 20 other refugees.
After being stripped of their possessions - the price of freedom -
they braved the ocean's currents to arrive on Singapore's coast
two-andda-half days later.
They were half-dead from dehydration and there were fears Thanh's
youngest child Trinh, two, would not make it.
After seven months in a refugee camp, the family of eight moved to
Australia to begin a new life free of fear and pain.
Standing proudly among dozens of veterans at Saturday's Vietnam
Veterans Day ceremony in Batemans Bay, Thanh belied little of the
struggle he and his family had suffered.
As a retired army captain, the now Moruya resident knows just how
important it is to remember those who fought and the sacrifices they
made for freedom.
The Ta family came to Australia in 1981 as refugees with little more
than the clothes on their back. Through Catholic Church sponsorship
they were given housing in Wagga Wagga, before moving to the
Eurobodalla in 1985.
But before that Thanh remembers seemingly endless suffering and
hardship in his home country.
During his army career, when he was the captain of 300 men, Thanh was
wounded three times.
He was shot in the leg and to this day the bullet remains lodged in
his flesh.
&quot;It is a souvenir - the doctor said just to leave it there.&quot;
A bullet also scraped his scalp and he was hit in the arm.
But of all the horrifying memories that still plague Thanh, one stands
out the most vividly. In the middle of a South Vietnamese battle with
the Viet Cong, they were all laying low in the trenches. Four of
Thanh's soldiers were huddled around a cannon gun, with another
standing close by - Thanh stood metres behind him.
All of a sudden, and for reasons the captain still can't understand,
the machine exploded. The five closest men were immediately blown to
bits right before Thanh's eyes. His face was covered in grey matter
and body parts, and he said the stench - a smell he will not forget in
this lifetime - threatened to overcome him.
&quot;For three days I could not eat,&quot; he said
In 1975, when the North Vietnamese (communists) took over, Thanh's
army captaincy earned him a prison sentence in a Viet Cong jail. He
managed to get out in 1978, but plans to safely ferry his family out
of the country were hampered.
&quot;We had people watching so we couldn't make a move,&quot; he said.
Eventually they were able to escape in Thanh's two-andda-half metre by
five-metre boat, which he had built up himself to include a canopy.
Refugees had flocked to the boat upon their departure, and Thanh said
he didn't have the heart to turn them away.
They had just made it out of the harbour when a patrol boat stopped
them and demanded anything of worth on the boat if the refugees did
not want to be captured. All their gold and jewellery was wrapped up
in newspaper and thrown to the authorities.
Despite being left with nothing, Thanh resented being forced onto
social security payments once he reached Australia.
He said, after everything the country had done for him and his family,
he did not want to take money from the government, and so he
desperately began looking for a job.
While living in Tomakin, a friend suggested Thanh and his wife Kim try
Moruya for employment.
It was there that they stumbled across the owner of a vacant building
in the town's CBD.
They told the man that they
had only a little money but they could cook and asked if he would open
a restaurant. They gave him the $1500 in their savings account and he
then created Anne's Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant, which opened in
1986.
It was only three years ago that Thanh discovered annual Vietnam
Veterans Day services were held in the Eurobodalla, through a returned
serviceman who would often come into the restaurant. He invited Thanh
to the shire's vet's association - and from there encouraged him to
the annual ceremonies.
He said at first he felt like he did not belong - having not fought
with the soldiers - but quickly discovered the depth of their
friendship and camaraderie.
And just like Thanh intends to attend the Vietnam Veterans Day each
year, he will continue a different tradition of a more personal
nature.
Each year at Christmas, he builds an elaborate nativity scene in
thanks to his God who he said delivered his family to safety and
brought them peace.
