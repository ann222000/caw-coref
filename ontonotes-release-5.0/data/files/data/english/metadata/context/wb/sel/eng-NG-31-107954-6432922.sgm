I just finished going through this past fall's threads on the tire
performance testing reported in Bicycle Quarterly 5(1). I was amazed
at the collective amnesia displayed in this newsgroup (rbt).

On the correlation between Crrs as measured by drum tests of various
surfaces and road tests of various surfaces, see for example:

&lt; http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2005/EnerEffTyre/sandberg.pdf &gt;

This is a pilot study with no discussion section. For extensive
discussion on what the results mean, see this thre ad
&lt; http://tinyurl.com/2bsqr6 &gt;
&lt; http://tinyurl.com/293kr7 &gt;
which appeared just a few months before the BQ tire test threads, and
which people seem to have somehow forgotten about.

In my posts there, I noted that (a) in the historical development of
rolli ng resistance tests, which have been conducted by tire
manufacturers for a very long time, the drums were originally asphalt
or the like (b) there are drums currently available with all sorts of
surfaces (c) testers moved more to polished steel drums to r educe the
scatter, to make the results more replicable, and (d) now there is a
lot of interest in drum testing on rollers with various surfaces,
because now there are not just tire manufacturers wanting to reduce
the rolling resistance of the tires, but a lso people responsible for
the environment who want to reduce the energy losses particular to the
road surface. Since these tests are generally for car tires with
significant tread patterns, there is also an interaction between tread
pattern and road surf ace, so there is also a desire to optimize the
pairings. As the pilot study linked above shows, all this can also be
measured more cheaply on actual roads using instrumented trailers,
BUT... there is an awful lot more scatter with those methods,
especiall y, as with the study above, if the trailer is not encased
inside a fairing. Thus roller data, with curvature mathematically
corrected to a flat surface, is the preferred method, if you can
afford the equipment.

The amount of scatter observed testing with trailers- an inherently
far more controlled system than a bicycle+rider in a rolldown- should
be sufficient to make people think twice about the significance of the
particular rankings observed in the BQ tests, especially for nearby
results. This is even more the case when one considers a statistical
point which I bring up further below.

In fact, when one observes the scatter obtained even in the results
for a single drum surface at two different speeds, one should be even
more cautious about the validity of any resulting rankings, especially
for nearby results. As is well known, a tight correlation between two
methods does not ensure their interchangeability. Again, the
statistical problem I allude to above and which I will explain further
below makes the situation even more problematic.

Nevertheless, although the BQ tests were presented as overturning
tests done on polished drums, in fact they are yet another vindication
of them. This is best seen by the fact that a transformation based on
tire widt h and tread thickness normalized the results: all other
things being similar, these are exactly the two factors that
conventional rolling resistance theory, as explained in the threads
above, would point to. But not all other things were similar, and
further below I will single out another factor which was not taken
into account in the BQ tests.

In short, for the BQ tests, to quote a certain H. Inn, the best
surprise was no surprise. Consider the following:

-The fastest tire in drum tests was the same as the fastest tire in
the BQ tests: no surprise.

-Some extremely confusing statements about tire width:
----------------------------------------
#We expected wider tires to roll faster, and the wide tires we tested
#rolled slower than the narrow ones.

@However, while some are surprised that we found wider tires to roll
@faster, that is not inconsistent with previous results.

#I like 650B bikes, yet all currently available 650B tires scored
average
#or worse.

%One of our very fast tires, a Mitsubo shi 650 x 37 mm was very wide.
---------------------------------------

I take the average of these statements to mean that, all other things
being equal, wider tires roll faster. But this has been understood for
ages- again, no surprise.

-That a 24.5mm tire should be fastest should be no surprise: consider
what size Jobst has been riding all these years, and advocating as the
best compromise between rolling resistance losses and suspension
losses: none other than 25mm.

-It was claimed that the pressur e results of the BQ tests, which
showed that at higher pressures, not much difference in rolling
resistance results from raising the pressure further, were
inconsistent with the IRC drum tests. But that is not correct: Señor
Fogel already posted the resul ts below, using the rolling resistance
figures from those IRC tests:

--------------------------------------------
This calculator uses Jobst's rolling resistance data to predict
exactly
that kind of effect:

http://www.analyticcycling.com/ForcesTires_ Page.html
[...]
The range of difference in a 1-hour 40 km ride at about 25 mph is
less
than thirteen seconds for inflations from 120 to 100 psi.
---------------------------------------------

The BQ tests were done for a 25-30 sec, 184 metre ride. Sc aling the
above result down for the distance or time gives a difference of about
0.05 - 0.1 sec, about the same or in fact even less than what was
recorded in the BQ tests. Again, no surprises.

-The slowest tires in the BQ tests have not been publicly t ested on
drums, but were exactly those that would be expected to be slowest, on
the basis of conventional rolling resistance theory. The Rivendell
tires use the Tornado casing, otherwise abandoned long ago by
Panaracer, and for an obvious reason: since th e casing is Kevlar
reinforced bead to bead, it is a colossal energy sucker. (It should
though be more cut resistant than conventional sidewalls.) Again, no
surprises.

However, the presence of the Rivendell tires in the statistical
analyses therefore does pose a problem. Because of that bead to bead
Kevlar reinforcement, they are qualitatively different in
construction, and significantly outside the performance range of the
other tires. Thus they must function as outliers or leverage points
and ought to b e excluded from any regression or correlation analysis.
That done, the range of measured variation becomes smaller and the
relative size of the noise greater. One then has to start questioning
even more the significance of the rankings, especially for nearby
results.

-The BQ tests showed wearing gloves or not had a noticeable effect.
But this was already discussed in &lt; http://tinyurl.com/38xthb &gt;. In
particular, the wind tunnel testing done at MIT shows that gloves or
not has about the same aero effect as an aero front wheel or not.
Again: no surprises.

Now to some apparent anomalies that turn out not to be, and to some
erroneous comments:

-Some may wonder how it is that the Avocet Duro (700x28) scored worse
than the Avocet Cross (700x35). First of all, if it is really a Cross
and not a Cross II, then it is really a 700x32 tire, not a 35. The
Duro is a true 28. Look at this table:

Width              Weight (g)
Cross   Road
28                 330     300 (Duro)
32                 370     390 (Duro Plus)
35                 395     ---

In other words, the Duro is a heavy duty tire, the Duro Plus even more
so, even more than the Cross. The two series use the same casings and
same rubber compound and same construction (save for t he tread
thickness, features, or lack thereof), so the weight differences are
all due to the tread thickness (tread coverage is also a possibility,
but these are similar in style). Thus if the Cross were very worn
down, as in fact it was reported to be, t hen we should indeed expect
it to be faster than the Duro. Again, no surprise.

I note that Jan Heine's remark that:

#Just because IRC or Michelin use drum tests doesn't mean it's a good
#way to test tires. In fact, both the Michelin Pro2 Race and the
Avocet
#Duro, which have been optimized on steel drums, scored much less
#well in our real-road tests, indicating that the current approach is
not
#the  best. (They both were fine tires, but not as excellent as steel
drum
#tests would have us believe.)

is not apropos: there are no publicly available drum test data for the
Duro (or the Duro Plus). The famous graphs are only for the Time Trial
(20mm), Criterium (23mm), and Road (25mm) models. These are of a
different construction than the Duro, with thi nner rubber and
usually, 127tpi casings instead of 66 (old Road were 66).

-The Michelin Pro2Race and Continental Ultra Gatorskin in 23mm: the
Michelin was reported as better in the Tour tests, but the two scored
the same in the BQ tests. However, while the same models (presumably,
see further on) were tested, the same individual tires were not. There
is variation in production and we don't know how much. For example,
while the Tour test quoted had the Crr of the UG at 0.0058 and that of
the Pro2Race at .0042, the values given for these tires from some
other test that has been oft-quoted in this group (I think done by Le
Cycle, on steel rollers as well) are as follows:

Tire                            Prr     Crr     Speed*
Vittoria Open Corsa Evo CX      27.1 W  .00334  23.22
Michelin Pro2 Race              29.2 W  .00360  23.14
Michelin Carbon                 34.7 W  .00428  22.94
Panaracer Stradius Pro          35.4 W  .00436  22.91
Hutchinson Fusion               39.6 W  .00488  22.76
Continenta l Ultra GatorSkin     40.3 W  .00497  22.73
Continental Grand Prix 3000     46.6 W  .00575  22.50
*185lb rider + bike 250W rider output  CdA = .32m^2 (racing crouch,
normal road bike)   Transmission efficiency = 96%

Moreover, the UG was redesigned in 2 006 and it's not clear even if
exactly the same model was tested.

Sure. Deflate the tire, and press or rap it in and out. How much shock

I mean, they found inflation pressure to not affect the results. If

That's only one parameter of the effects of the casing and the tread, of
course.  The classic issue in rolling resistance is hysteresis- which
did seem to be the major- although certainly not only- factor in the
ordinal rankings of the tires in the original BQ test.

That's an incorrect representation of the findings.  What they found was
that inflation pressure did not affect rolling resistance as much as
tire construction (casing type, rubber thickness, tread design).  They
did not find that inflation did not affect the results.

There would be no "suspension losses" in steel drum RR tests, as the
drums are smooth and concentric.  In addition to inflation pressure, one
would expect the stiffness of the casing and tread to be a factor in the
ability of the tire to absorb bumps.

Ca. 1934 Reyhand (Vol. 5, No. 1) in BQ's image archives has a
different spoke arrangement

the idea that increased inflation doesn't lower rolling resistance is
n utty?

width is related to load and surface, does't exist as an isolated
quantity?

why would an all kevlar carcass suck energy?

Yes, that's true. JH said

too

tests

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Exactly. Thus the effects of rolling resistance and suspension losses
can be disentangled.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That gets back to the first question above. I suggest that, certainly
for good tires, those factors are very minor compared to the pneumatic
effect of the air. I suggest one can discern this by deflating the
tire fully, giving it a rap, and comparing the effect to that when
done with the tire inflated.

Another way to look at it is: if they really were significant factors,
then we would have smoother rides with stiffer, thicker, highly
hysteretic tires. The Specialized Armadillo, chock full of extruded
Kevlar, would give a buttery ride, instead of the wooden one that is
more often reported. That is to say, everybody says the ride is best
when the casing and tread are so silken as to effectively disappear.
So, it really is the pneumatic effect (spread impulse out over time,
don't suck it into the tire) that takes the edge off the bumps, not
the hysteresis.

It does lower it, but after and up to a certain point, not by much.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's width of the contact patch: pressure, surface, load,
deformability of the tire. The width referred to is instead just the
tire size width. One inflates the tire based on that size, and  the
other major factors are roughly constants in the tests.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Kevlar is a highly hysteretic material, to answer your question by
restating it. Seriously, check out a Specialized Armadillo, chock full
of Kevlar. It's stiff and inelastic, i.e. an energy sucker.

Someone reminded me of some things I forgot to mention in my original
post. It is well known that for car tires, the rolling resistance
decreases significantly after a break-in period of about 200 miles.
This is due to changes in the physical/chemical structure of the
rubber as it gets worked into condition. I don't recall that effect
being discussed, and since both new and used tires were mixed in the
tests, it was not factored out.
Also, the rolling resistance changes significantly with
temperature, not due to pressure effects, but to changes in the
consistency of the rubber. A rise of 10degF as was reported during the
course of the day for the tests is significant. If the control runs at
the beginning and end of the day were nevertheless at the same
temperature, missing that fluctuation, they would ignore that
important effect.

I suspect that much of the underlying philosophy behind the BQ analysis
comes form Jim Papadopolous, who used to participate in r.b.t.  Jim has
long maintained that wider, softer tires roll better on real roads
because they absorb and roll over small surface irregularities (such as
asphalt "grain") rather than being deflected upwards.  There's been some
disagreement about the accuracy of that belief.

Heine also reported seeing this phenomenon and adjusted for it with a
set of reference wheels to use as a comparison, allowing them to develop
a correction factor to reduce the effects of temperature change.

You've re-read the thread, you say.  Have you read the source article?
It's quite dense writing and much of what was in the article never made
it into the discussion, and only a few of the participants bothered to
read the original material so the rest tended to be talking through
their hat.  It was rather bizarre at the time to be reading critiques
written by people who hadn't read what they were critiquing.

As I mentioned in another post, there is further information in the
newest issue of BQ including a discussion of the statistical analysis of
the data to determine reliability.  I saw this at the LBS and am waiting
for my issue to arrive at home.

I've looked at the BQ test and results and they seem to be seriously
flawed.

I modeled their setup and got the following results:

..............................V1 (mph)..V2 (mph)...t (sec)...dt (sec)

Baseline        .................18.17..........13.82......26.29
CdA= .36 vs .35.......18.14..........13.65......26.50......0.21
Bar. =29.9 vs 30.1...18.18      .........13.86......26.25.....-0.05
Head wind =0.5 vs 0..17.96........12.93......27.39      ......1.10
Temp= 60 vs 50........18.20.........13.93......26.16......-0.14
Crr=.006 vs .005.......18.03.........13.32......26.89.......0.60
Weight = 162 vs 160..18.19.........13.88        .....26.22......-0.08

Tiny amounts of wind will really throw off the results, as will small
changes in rider position. Plus a change in Crr from .006 to .005 is
only going to give them a .6 sec time difference. Obviously, this sort
of test is not capable of discerning small Crr differences unless
*many* tests are done for each tire, and great care is taken to
minimize the effects of the many random variables.

They say that roller test show that a drop in pressure from 105 to 85
psi resulted in a Crr increase of 15%, whereas their testing showed a
drop in speed of only 2%. Apples to oranges... Crr is not speed. An
increase in Crr of 15% *is* equivalent to a drop in speed of ~2%... so
they have verified the drum tests.

&gt; Someone reminded me of some things I forgot to mention in my original
&gt; post. It is well known that for car tires, the rolling resistance

&gt; rubber as it gets worked into condition. I don't recall that effect

This has been noted with bicycle tires as well. A drop of ~10% in Crr
is common.

&gt; That is to say, everybody says the ride is best

&gt; So, it really is the pneumatic effect (spread impulse out over time,

&gt; the hysteresis.
">

A good point. The smoothest riding tire should also be the one with
the lowest suspension losses. At high pressure this is likely to be a
tire with low Crr as well, but at lower pressures (MTB at 35 psi) I've
noticed that the damping effect of high hysteresis tires comes into
play, and they actually ride better.

Indeed - which is why

a) we were careful to minimize the effect of random variables, by
selecting days with favorable atmospheric conditions, etc.
b) we ran multiple tests for each tire
c) we report that we cannot distinguish very small differences between
tires. The current issue also has a table that shows which tires were
statisticially significantly different, and which were not. However,
the differences between tires are large enough that they can be
distinguished by our methods (see below).

Instead of hypothesizing, look at our raw data - we reported the
actual measurements both for a majority of the initial test runs, and
for all of the new runs. If you think you have an alternative
explanation for the data, let us know. To say "It can't be" is not a
valid critique. The data exists, and it needs to be explained.

There are two questions regarding our data:

1) Are we measuring actual differences between tires (explained
variance), or just random variations due to wind, rider position, etc.
(unexplained variance). We looked into that (see the current issue of
Bicycle Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 3, p. 20). An analysis of variance
(ANOVA) showed that the ratio of explained to unexplained variance in
our initial test was more than 151 to 1. F(18, 36) = 151.9. The
resulting p is smaller than 0.0001, or in other words, there is less
than a 1 in 10,000 chance that we are just measuring random scatter in
the data.

(In case you wonder whether the author is qualified, check out his
credentials at http://www.vintagebicyclepress.com/contributors.html .
He had a minor in statistics in his Ph.D. studies.)

2) How good is our model in replicating real-world conditions? You may
argue that our road was rougher than the ones you usually ride. The
standing start also might have favored or disfavored heavier tires,
although we don't think it was an important factor. But these are
points we can argue. However, for our testing of tire pressure, the
standing start does not matter, as the tire weight remained the same
for the different runs. The fact that the run time changes only very
little with increasing pressure above a certain point indicates that
the overall resistance of the tire also changes very little with
increasing pressure.

Finally, somebody said that our tests just confirmed what was known
already. That is true - with the original tests in Vol. 5, No. 1,
there was an article on 1930s handmade French clinchers that seemed to
incorporate all the design features we found make a tire fast at
moderate speeds: great width, supple casing, soft rubber compound, and
as a result low pressure rating. Unfortunately, without real-world
testing, many, if not most people, including tire manufacturers, since
have lost that knowledge.

The real trade-off is between width, supple casings, and pressure. In
theory, it is quite simple:

- Wider tires roll faster (at least within the widths of the tires we
tested, 21-37 mm).
- Tires with supple casings roll faster.
- People used to believe that higher pressures also made tires roll
significantly faster.

However, you can't have all three - large width, supple casings and
high pressures - in the same tire. In the past, manufacturers
sacrificed the suppleness to be able to run high pressures. Most
makers used sturdier, less supple casings for their wider tires.
However, our results show that this tradeoff was wrong. Using the same
supple casings for wider tires, which then must run at relatively low
pressures, gets you faster tires.

As you know, I usually don't follow this group. If somebody comes up
with an alternative interpretation of our data, please contact me
directly. I will print your interpretation in the next issue of
Bicycle Quarterly. The goal of the magazine is to have an open
discussion, so I am looking for different points of view.

I came at this from two directions: first, I was thinking of ordering
a few back issues of the VBQ because I wanted some of the older
articles. But in the contents pagee I saw they had some new articles
on tires. Also, since I can't get tanwall Avocet Duros or Duro Pluses
any more, I was wondering about those Grand Bois tires... although the
cost rules them out. So, I wondered: what was said about all this in
RBT? Are they worth ordering? Reading the threads, I couldn't believe
the collective amnesia of the group. We had already discussed
empirical results on the correlation between drum tests of various
surfaces, and between drum and road tests of various surfaces. I
pointed out that the statistical analysis of these things is
problematic, because of (a) the scatter, even between drum tests; and
(b) the presence of leverage points or outliers. The Rivendell tires
certainly seem to constitute same and I wonder if the statistical
significance would disappear if they were takien out.

metal tires/wheels are energy suckers because metal wheels are

yeah but the idea was to stiffen the bottom bulge reducing bulge

you get sensitive sdiewalls in part by reducing air pressure.
the beef with the conti TT seemed to be the TT had weak sidewalls with

not haul beans down the road touring tires or sidewalls that could

Metal is elastic, that's why springs are made of it and why a bell or
a tuning fork resonates for a long time after you ring it. However,
the spring constant is very high. Stiff and inelastic together means
an energy sucker: everything does have to deform when squeezed, but if
it is stiff it will take a lot of force to do that appreciably and if
it is inelastic you won't recover the energy.

I have no concerns about the statistical acumen or int egrity of the
authors. That is why I take it to be worthwhile to argue the points:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  questions regarding our data:

&gt;  1) Are we measuring actual differences between tires (explained
&gt;  variance), or just random variations due to wind, rider position, etc.
&gt;  (unexplained variance). We looked into that (see the current issue of
&gt;  Bicycle Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 3, p. 20). An analysis of variance
&gt;  (ANOVA) showed that the ratio of explained to unexplained variance in
&gt;  our initial test was more than 151 to 1. F(18, 36) = 151.9. The
&gt;  resulting p is smaller than 0.0001, or in other words, there is less
&gt;  than a 1 in 10,000 chance that we are just measuring random scatter in
&gt;  the data.
">

It would be amazing if the null hypothesis were found to hold, i.e. if
it were found that all the tires were the same- look at the wide
variety of them you are testing. But you want to know much more than
that.

You want to know things like, "If I inflate my tires 10-20psi higher,
will I finish Paris-Brest-Paris faster than I would have otherwise?",
"If I choose tire x instead of tire y, or inflate it higher or lower,
would I set a course or age group record that I otherwise would have
missed?", and the like.

So, consider for example the effect of inflat ion pressure. According
to your tests, the effect in the relevant ranges was no greater than
the noise of your methods. But that certainly does not tell you what
you want to know:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  The fact that the run time changes only very
&gt;  little with increasing pressure above a certain point indicates that
&gt;  the overall resistance of the tire also changes very little with
&gt;  increasing pressure.
">

To re-emphasize, this is not a new result but just confirms the IRC
drum tests. As I quoted in my original post, by the IRC numbers, going
from 100 to 120 psi results in about a 13 second improvement over 40
km at 25mph, an amount corresponding to about 0.05-0.1s on your test
course, which is below the level of the noise in your procedures. This
difference is not s tatistically significant for your tests, but it is
athletically very significant for someone going for a course or age
group record, or to win at Paris-Brest-Paris.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  somebody [I believe you mean me] said that our tests just confirmed what was known
&gt;  already. That is true - with the original tests in Vol. 5, No. 1,
&gt;  there was an article on 1930s handmade French clinchers that seemed to
&gt;  incorporate all the design features we found make a tire fast at
&gt;  moderate speeds: great width, supple casing, soft rubber compound, and
&gt;  as a result low pressure rating. Unfortunately, without real-world
&gt;  testing, many, if not most people, including tire manufacturers, since
&gt;  have lost that knowledge.
">

Don't forget that since the 1930s, the roads got paved, and carbon
black rubber was invented. Still, I don't get this: what you say above
is none other than the conventional wisdom for all tire manufacturers
today, and what Jobst has been saying all these years. The difference
is that you are neglecting two other factors that they keep uppermost
in mind, namely intended application and durability. (One might also
add, wet grip, except that Jobst considers that more than most
manufacturers.)

Intended application: if your goal is to go fast then you have to
think about aerodynamics, and when going fast on even half-well paved
roads the aerodynamic advantage of narrower tires dwarfs the rolling
resistance and suspension loss advantages of wider tires. That is why
you find today's Tour de France riders using 20-23mmm tires at high
pressures, Jobst using 25mm at moderate pressures, and the world's
fastest racers at Paris-Roubaix using 25-30mm tires at pressures lower
still. I might add that all of them arrived at these choices through
evolution and refi nement, not rolling resistance tests of any kind.

So if you can't use wide tires to be the fastest on well-paved roads,
what would you want them for, and therefore, how should the
manufacturers design them?
One good use would be for carrying hea vy loads, either in the
form of yourself, or baggage. For that, the casing must be heavier
duty because you will still need to keep them well inflated, and
likely you want something more durable anyway. Likewise, another good
reason is for riding poorly p aved roads. Wider tires will give you
not just better suspension, but also keep your exposed sidewalls
further away from the debris. Correspondingly, you would want them to
have thicker rubber and stronger casings. The 66tpi casings and
probably 2 - 2.5mm of hard tread rubber of my Avocet Duro Pluses
(which I run at around maybe 50-70psi) make a lot of sense, but the
same size tire in 127tpi with 1mm of soft tread rubber would be a
highly specialized item: made for short races in dry weather on well-
swept roads, for out of shape riders who are not fat enough to need
high pressures, yet who cannot go fast enough for aerodynamics to be a
factor. Who on earth is that?

Remember, soft rubber without a lot of carbon black, while it does
have a lower rolling re sistance for the same thickness, is not
durable; a 66tpi casing is still very flexible; and carbon black is
the most effective means for giving safe wet grip. How many miles is a
Deda Tre good for, and what's the wet grip like?

I think durability must be a reasonably important factor for you as
well. You wouldn't want to be wearing through a tire 80% of the way
through P-B-P. And hard rubber is more puncture resistant too. Get
them to make those Grand Bois tires with 1.5mm (at 25mm, 127tpi) to
1.75 - 2.5mm (at 28 - 32mm, 66tpi) of hard, durable, wet-safe high
carbon rubber, with completely smooth tread (no file pattern), and you
will get some new customers- one of them likely being Jobst, and
myself another.

the differences were felt to be below the threshold of statistical
significance by Jan and crew, I doubt it.  I'd have to walk all the way
upstairs to double check and I'm currently too lazy.  But I do recall a
discussion of the impact on PBP finishing times that would result from
tire choice and they were really quite large.  Differences of several
hours, in fact, over the 1200 km in 90 hours at the same rider output.

I was, and remain, skeptical of the BQ test results.  However, I have
not yet read the more recent data analysis and will keep an open mind
until then.

may be that the differences in rolling resistance resulting from higher
or lower inflation pressures may be of far smaller magnitude than smooth
drum tests would suggest.

You are making an apparent second error when you say that Jan's test
results "confirm" the IRC results or the Tour Magazine results, for that
matter.  Jan's test suggests that the effect of tire pressure is either
lost in the noise of other factors such as road surface grain, or simply
of much lesser magnitude than tire construction, tread design, etc.

For the range of variation of the tires they selected, that sounds
quite reasonable, since 1% of 90 hours is almost an hour already. This
was one of the statistical problems with the tests that I remarked on:
by including tires so different from the others (the Rivendells), the
amount of "explained" variation gets blown up compared to the noise,
guaranteeing a successful F-test. I would want to see the ANOVA run
with the outliers/leverage points excluded from the mix, i.e. with
only similar tires tested. As I say, with the range of tires they are
testing, it would be amazing, no, absurd, if the null hypothesis were
to hold.

Not sure exactly which assumption "that" assumption is, but the point
is that in his tests, he measured exactly that difference due to
inflation. If anything, he found inflation pressure to be more
influential than was found by IRC: he mentioned typical figures of .1
- .2 seconds over his test course, while according to the IRC data it
would be 0.05 - 0.1 seconds. So yes, they certainly did confirm the
drum tests on that. This also proves that suspension losses were not a
significant factor in their tests.

It's important to be clear what exactly it means for that effect to be
lost in the noise. It means, lost in the noise of his test procedures,
i.e. his tests were not sensitive enough to deal with a real
difference of 13 seconds over 40km at 25mph. So, that difference is
not statistically significant *in their tests*. It is though real, and
athletically very significant. It's like having a bathroom scale that
is only accurate to within 10lbs. That doesn't mean that a weight gain
of 8lbs isn't real or significant.

This from a guy who posted a reply merely nitpicking someone who took the
time to post useful information, simply because his formatting wasn't to
your liking.  (BTW, his OP was perfectly clear on my newsreader, no tweaking
required.)

It's no big surprise, of course.  You do it quite often (although not
usually about /tables/ per se).

Technical about bikes is on topic.  It's rec.bicycles.tech.  Trying to
post tables to a newsgroup is fraught with peril because the poster has
no control over how the reader's newsreader operates.  We need to make
allowances as a result.
