-----------------------------------------

Gorram, it was hot as the pits of Hell on this gan ni niang of a planet. What
were they still doing here, that was what Jayne wanted to know. They'd done
the job (legit and everything), gotten the payment; they should've been off
this rock two days ago. But no, Mal'd gone and grown a gorram conscience and
had the Serenity crew helping the citizens of the shitwater village of Genosh
rebuild their town. As if delivering their medical supplies after the
earthquake hadn't been plenty of a humanitarian gesture. Hell, they'd even
gotten a ten percent discount! What'd they want, blood?

One good thing about this planet was the hot springs, which meant hot showers.
Real hot. The kind of hot you just didn't get on Serenity because heat equals
fuel, and on a smuggler's Firefly, fuel is always at a premium. And pin his
balls to the wall if Jayne wasn't sore as sin after playing Mr. Fix-It for two
straight days. Didn't anyone else on the gorram planet know how to use a
hammer? He was sore, he was pissed, he was tired and he was horny. Course
that last one was more a general statement of fact rather than anything to do
with being on this planet. Though there was something about the incessant
humidity and the way it made clothing cling to girl bodies that wasn't helping
one bit.

He turned off the shower when he was good and ready - it was tiny and cramped
and he kept whacking his elbow on the soap dish - and grabbed a towel as he
strode into the room that had been apportioned as his while they were staying
on this planet. He'd just as happily have stayed on Serenity, except... well,
hot showers. Jayne wasn't a man to deny himself the pleasures in life.

Speaking of pleasures.

He toweled his hair quickly - swish, swish, done - then wrapped the towel
around his waist before fishing through his duffel and emerging a minute later
with a pack of stogies and a bottle of rotgut whiskey. He brewed it special in
a still behind Serenity's engine. It burned like a sumbitch on the way down -
sometimes they used it to scour the Mule's chassis - but it left a body numb
after just a few hits, and the way Jayne's muscles were aching, he could do
with a little numb.

Flinging himself into the room's lone chair, he slouched down until he was
comfortable, then struck a match on the floor to light the cigar. Smoke filled
his lungs, and he felt himself begin to relax.

Blowing out the match, he chucked it over his shoulder into the empty fireplace
(who'd need a fire on a planet hot as this? Useless waste of space) and popped
the cork out of his jug of whiskey. Taking the cigar from his mouth, he took a
pull off the jug, swallowed, savored the burn, and popped the stogie back in
his mouth.

Aw yeah. This right here; this was the life.

If one room, a single chair with padding like a cheap pair of boots, bed hard
as a rock, blinds on the window that looked like bars, and a steady,
unrelenting heat haze that hung in the air like fog could be called &quot;the life.&quot;
But if it could - and with some alcohol and a smoke, Jayne was willing to give
it the benefit of the doubt - then this was definitely the life.

He swigged down more whiskey, stuck the cigar back in his mouth, and closed his
eyes.

He must have dozed off, because the next thing he became aware of was the
whisper of cloth against his knees. Immediately his eyes snapped open, and he
found himself face to stomach with Crazy Girl. &quot;Gorrammit, girl!&quot; he snapped,
whipping the cigar out of his mouth and raising his gaze to stare up into her
hazy eyes. &quot;Ain't no one never told you not to sneak up on a man when he's
sleepin', lessin' you got a death wish?&quot;

River gave him a slow, sparkling smile. &quot;You have,&quot; she reminded him.

Jayne glared at her; then, slowly, he grinned. &quot;I was wonderin' where the hell
your skinny ass was. Missed the shower.&quot;

She shook her head and ran her fingers down his chest. &quot;Nothing lost that
can't be regained,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Best parts always come in the third act.&quot;
Her fingers reached the top of the towel tied around his hips.

Jayne growled. Mashing the cigar out on the arm of his chair, he jammed it in
the mouth of the whiskey jug as a makeshift cork and dropped both items to the
floor. &quot;Come 'ere,&quot; he said, voice a quasi-snarl, and reached out to grab her
slender hips in his broad hands. River obligingly straddled his thighs; Jayne
grinned and spread his legs, forcing her legs further apart. She wasn't
wearing nothing but a thin calico dress that clung to her body like a second
skin in the pressing humidity. Jayne could feel the sharp ridges of her hips
through the filmy fabric. &quot;Now I know you ain't wearin' no panties under that
pretty floral skirt, baby doll,&quot; he observed, letting his eyes rake up her body
then down again before settling firmly on the flat plane of her belly. &quot;Didn't
I tell you not to do that when we get offship?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Cuz there are men who won't think twice 'bout havin' their way with a pretty
girl on these worlds, 'specially iffen that girl ain't wearin' her drawers.&quot;
He massaged the curve of her waist with his thumbs, watching her eyes drift
shut. &quot;Bad men. Not nice, gentlemanly gentlemen.&quot; He grinned as his fingers
slowly began to bunch up her skirt. &quot;All men ain't like me.&quot;

The girl's eyes opened again, and there it was; that hazy, mazy fire that
proved she wasn't as crazy as everyone thought she was, and she knew exactly
what she wanted. Namely, him. &quot;The girl is glad,&quot; she purred, resting her
hands on his shoulders. &quot;She's not like other girls. Doesn't want a boy like
other boys.&quot;

&quot;I ain't a boy, little girl.&quot;

&quot;Ain't a little girl, big man.&quot; Her fingers trailed down his chest before
hooking into his towel and tugging it open without artifice.

Jayne moaned as the terrycloth fell away to dangle over the sides of the chair.
&quot;Get down here,&quot; he said, not bothering to keep the demanding tone out of his
voice. It had been a long two days, he was sore and his body wanted comfort,
and there wasn't a sweeter place to rest his bones than snugged up warm in his
Riverbed.

River smiled - a whimsical half-smile that let him know that she knew precisely
how much power she had over him, and wasn't going to let him forget it - then
sank down on his lap, warm and slow as summer honey. Her thighs were moist
with all manner of damp, and they slid over his like watered silk. Her artful
fingers curved around his waist, kneading at sore knots of muscle he hadn't
even known he had. Jayne groaned at the twin assault of pain and pleasure and
let his head loll back against the chair.

&quot;My big man's gone and wounded hisself,&quot; she observed quietly in a perfect
mimic of his accent, as her fingers sought out his tender places. &quot;Gone and
tried to do too much.&quot;

&quot;I ain't done too much,&quot; he grunted, annoyed that she'd imply he was weak or
something. &quot;Just a bit of hammering. An d lifting. And sawing. And
chopping.&quot;

&quot;Babble, babble, like a brook,&quot; she sighed, and even with his eyes closed he
could picture how she was shaking her head, as if he were a troublesome child.
&quot;And they call me River.&quot;

Jayne snickered and trailed his hands up her back, opening his eyes as he did
so. &quot;You gonna make me tan your hide, little girl?&quot;

He hissed as her nails pressed into his skin. &quot;Not a little girl,&quot; she
repeated, before easing her grip and going back to her gentle massage. &quot;And
you like me pale.&quot;

&quot;Mebbe I jus' want you for the sex, girl. You ever think of that? What makes
you think I like you?&quot;

One small hand stole down between them to brush over his stiff cock, and he
sucked in a breath. &quot;This does,&quot; she said simply.

Jayne groaned and grabbed her wrist, forcing her hand to curl around him.
&quot;Guess I ain't got no secrets then,&quot; he moaned, squeezing his eyes shut as she
pumped him with maddening delicacy.

&quot;Mm-mmm,&quot; she hummed dreamily, leaning forward to press her warm mouth against
his collarbone.

Jayne felt the tension slowly seeping out of his body as she worked him with a
combination of lips and fingers. He let his own hands slide back down her
back, dragging open the zipper of her dress in the doing. Her skin was soft
and ivory smooth under his rough fingertips, and he tugged on the fabric till
it fell off her shoulders, so he could taste some of that creamy skin for
himself. Tucking his face into the crook of her neck, he sucked on her pulse
point, feeling it beat in steady rhythm with the pumping of her hand around his
cock. Girl had the sweetest, softest hands in the 'verse, no mistake. Hands
like that were just made for sinning.

&quot;Jayne's in pain,&quot; she purred near his ear. &quot;And his River is a giver.&quot;

&quot;Hell yes she is,&quot; he growled against her throat, panting slightly as her hand
increased its speed and pressure. &quot;Ain't she just.&quot;

He snaked a hand between her legs, up under her skirt, and kissed her throat so
he could feel her moan as his fingers trailed through the warm wet at the apex
of her thighs. She pressed down into his hand and he didn't bother to stop
her, choosing instead to go the easy route and rub his palm against her. She
moaned again, louder this time, and arched her back so her long hair hung down
and tickled his knees. &quot;You gonna make me feel better, River?&quot; he asked, voice
husky as he dipped a lazy finger inside her, just to see her jump.

She didn't disappoint him. &quot;Yes...!&quot; she gasped, stiffening. He felt her
inner muscles flutter, trying to pull him deeper. He thought about how good it
felt to drive into her and let himself get lost in that wet heat. This whole
gorram planet was wet and hot, but nothing like his River. His River was a
wonder.

&quot;You is, ain't you,&quot; he agreed, sliding his other hand around to cup her bottom
and pull her forward so their bellies were almost touching. It made her have
to raise up slightly, and now he could feel his tip brushing against her moist
curls. It made his stomach clench.

She shut him up with a kiss, warm and wet, like the way her body wrapped around
him as she sank down on his shaft. He groaned into her mouth, letting his arms
settle on the chair rests, and just let her go as she began to rock against
him. Every inch of his body felt heavy as brick; the only thing he could move
was his head, and he took the opportunity to drop slow, sloppy kisses on her
shoulders and across the tops of her breasts.

River was panting, whimpering out his name and a slew of other syllables with
each soft thrust of her body. Jayne didn't mind letting her take over and set
the pace. Hell, she could ride him all day like a clockwork pony if she
wanted, so long as she kept moaning his name like that. Like she didn't
remember nothing else. Like it was the only word that meant a good goddamn to
her.

&quot;That's it, baby doll,&quot; he urged, voice like gravel in his throat. &quot;Come on,
just like that. Tha's right, you're good at this, ain't you?&quot; He hissed as
she readjusted the angle of her hips. &quot;Good... so gorram good...&quot;

&quot;Oil and wood,&quot; she panted against his mouth, cupping his face between her
palms. The dress still dangled off her elbows, but her small breasts were bare
against his chest, and she rubbed against him like a cat. &quot;Sleek and
shiny...&quot;

Jayne groaned as her nipples grazed over his own. &quot;Gorram, baby...&quot; His hand
slid forward to grip her bottom , not guiding so much as feeling her move,
maybe adding a little extra power on each upthrust 'cause it made the
downthrust that much more of a burn. Squeezing, he moaned, &quot;Mine...&quot;

&quot;Yours,&quot; she moaned, nodding vaguely in agreement. &quot;Hers. Ours. Mine, mine,
all mine.&quot; Her arms wrapped around his neck. &quot;Shiny miney....&quot;

Jayne grinned against her mouth. &quot;Ain't you just cute as a button when you're
sexin' up your favorite man.&quot;

&quot;Only. Only man.&quot;

Jayne didn't know why that single word made him go ten times harder inside her
slick body, but it did. Maybe 'cause the only other women he'd ever been with
were whores, and they didn't make any bones about the fact they slept with lots
of other men. Hell, the more men they had, the better they ate; simple gorram
economics. But River was his; he was the only man had ever touched her, and no
one else had been with her since they started up. He would've known; he'd
smell it on her skin. It wasn't that she was sweet or innocent, 'cause that
wasn't it at all; she'd taught him things even he didn't know about having fun
between the sheets, though he never asked her where she learned it all. It was
just... she was his. And he hadn't been with a whore since the first time she
climbed on his lap in the common room in the middle of the night and said, &quot;I
want to be real.&quot;

Growling deep in his chest, he wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her
tight against him so he could plunder her mouth with his tongue. His hips took
up the rhythm of her thrusts and started to answer back in kind. She keened
into his mouth, her hands scrabbling at his shoulders as she tried to find
purchase on his slippery skin. The humidity and the sweat of their exertions
was turning her dark hair into damp tendrils that dangled around her face and
brushed over his shoulders like cornsilk. Every inch of her was quivering; he
knew that she was close.

With a lazy motion, like he was moving his arms to stretch, he tore her dress
apart.

&quot;In the way,&quot; he panted as he balled up the useless fabric, tugging it away
from her slender arms and chucking it across the room. Now he could feel each
satiny brush of her belly against his own, of her hips grinding with his; this
was how it was meant to be. This was what right felt like.

&quot;Jayyyyne...,&quot; she moaned, digging her nails into his shoulders. There was a
new note to her voice; a familiar desperation that made his adrenaline pound.
&quot;Oh... ohhhhhhhhh....!&quot;

&quot;You close, baby?&quot; His mouth found her right breast and he rolled her nipple
between his teeth.

&quot;Yes! Close, close, the girl is balanced on the knife!&quot;

Jayne tightened his arms around her waist. &quot;Come on, then,&quot; he panted, and now
he was guiding her thrusts, keeping her movements sure, steady and hard as she
started to falter. River threw back her head and cried out his name as the
friction built to a crescendo inside her body. &quot;Come on!&quot;

&quot;Yessss... Oh yesssss...! Yes! YES! YES YES YES!&quot; River exclaimed, before
arching her back and planting her palms on his chest as she released a wordless
cry and clenched around him like a vice. He watched her whole body shudder
with completion, saw the brilliant, exuberant smile on her face, and pulled her
down hard, so she was fitted tight to his hips as he exploded inside her. He
didn't have the air to call out her name, so he just settled for fisting his
hand in her hair and bringing her head forward for another kiss, deeper, darker
and richer than before. His tongue ran over the roof of her mouth and played
Tic Tac Toe with her teeth as she poured more moans into his mouth like good
whiskey. Not his homemade rotgut; the good stuff, top shelf; the stuff that
burned the throat but made you feel privileged for the pain.

She was shaking in his arms as she collapsed forward against his chest, but
that wasn't anything new. River always trembled after sex. Made him think of
the kittens the ratter back home used to pump out regular every year. Tabbies,
every one of them, and each shaky as a leaf on a tree. His ma had always made
sure they were snugged up warm in a comfy basket with their mama. Since Jayne
didn't have anything like that, he settled for wrapping his arms around River
as tight as they'd go, till she almost disappeared inside them, and held her
right up close against his body. River responded by snaking her arms around
his back and hugging him like he was her favorite teddy bear. &quot;Better?&quot; she
mumbled against his throat.

Jayne pressed his face into her hair. &quot;Mmm, hells yes.&quot; It was true, too. He
didn't feel anything but a kind of drowsy laziness that made him want to sleep
for a week, preferably using River for his blanket.

&quot;Bed would be appropriate now.&quot;

Jayne snorted. &quot;You sayin' I ain't comfy, baby girl?&quot; He massaged the back of
her neck.

River snuggled into his throat. &quot;The girl is quite at home,&quot; she replied.
&quot;But the man will get a crick in his neck and be grumpy, and the girl will have
to make him feel all better again.&quot;

&quot;I ain't got a problem with that.&quot;

&quot;Insatiable.&quot;

&quot;Mmm...&quot; He yawned and scrubbed his cheek against her damp hair. &quot;Gorram, you
smell good after sex, baby doll.&quot;

She giggled against his chest. &quot;I always smell good.&quot; He felt her lips brush
over his collarbone. &quot;You smell better.&quot;

&quot;Next time I'm gonna take you from behind, just so's I can smell your hair the
whole time.&quot;

&quot;She would find that pleasurable.&quot;

Jayne grinned. &quot;That's my girl.&quot;

&quot;That's my boy,&quot; she parroted back.

Jayne closed his eyes, too warm and comfortable to bother fighting sleep
anymore. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he yawned, settling more comfortably into the chair and
rearranging his limbs around her body. &quot;Yeah he is.&quot;

He let the steady rise and fall of her breathing lull him off to sleep.
