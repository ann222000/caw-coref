Was Mother Goose a real person? I've just picked up a c1860s carte de
visite labeled, &quot;Mother Goose.&quot; It depicts a young woman [girl?] surrounded
by a collection of dolls. The reverse is hand inscribed, &quot;Miss Hendof -
Navy Yard - Washington, Fla&quot;

You can see her at:  http://home.pcspower.net/amistad/images/goose.gif

Any ideas as to who this really was? Thanks!

If I remember right, the first &quot;Mother Goose&quot; tales were a small
collection of fairy tales published by Charles Perrault sometime around
1700. It didn't bear much resemblance to the collection as it is today;
it contained stories like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty and Tom Thumb.

If Mother Goose was a real person, she predated your CDV... :-D I can't
remember if she was a real person or not, but I have the impression that
&quot;Mother Goose&quot; stories were just another term for nursery rhymes until
someone whose name I can't remember published &quot;The Real Mother Goose&quot;
around 1900, which sort of codified the 70-odd rhymes we think of as
Mother Goose nursery rhymes now.

Of course, no one person wrote all those rhymes -- I can't remember the
origins of them all, but I'm sure you know about the controversy over
whether &quot;Ring around the Rosey&quot; is about the Plague or not... Old King
Cole is about Coel (5th c. AD?); Little Jack Horner is about political
patronage; Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary is Mary Queen of Scots... I can't
remember any more off the top of my head. (A lot of those brain cells are
dead now.)

Love the CDV -- my semi-educated (translation: half-assed) guess is that
the caption refers to the little &quot;mother&quot; with all her &quot;children&quot;...
maybe she read stories to her dolls after she tucked them in bed, and her
parents thought it was darling enough to immortalize...

I think it was Mother Goose that wrote :
I awoke one morning and looked upon the sill,
There sat a little sparrow,chirping nature's will,
When it stopped it's singing,there fell a quiet lull
So,I gently closed the window and crushed it's little SKULL........
Yeehaaaaaaaa !
now,go to Sleep....... IMO

No no Doug, it goes:

A birdie with a yellow bill
hopped upon my window sill
I lured him near with crusts of bread
and smashed his little f***ing head

The original form of the poem, it which the last two lines were:

he cocked his little head and said
&quot;Ain't you shamed you sleepy head?&quot;

was in a book of my sister's called poems for children and was loved by her and
hated by me. Even at age six I thought it was sappy. When I heard the
alternate version at college, I giggled the rest of the day.

"/>&quot;Mother Goose, fictitious old woman, reputedly the source of the body of
traditional children's songs and verses known as nursery rhymes. She is
often pictured as a beak-nosed, sharp-chinned elderly woman riding on the
back of a flying gander. &quot;Mother Goose&quot; was first associated with nursery
rhymes in an early collection of &quot;the most celebrated Songs and Lullabies of
old British nurses,&quot; Mother Goose's Melody; or Sonnets for the Cradle
(1781), published by the successors of one of
the first publishers of children's books, John Newbery. The oldest extant
copy dates from 1791, but it is thought that an edition appeared, or was
planned, as early as 1765, and it is likely that it was edited by Oliver
Goldsmith, who may also have composed some of the verses. The Newbery firm
seems to have derived the name &quot;Mother Goose&quot; from the title of Charles
Perrault's fairy tales, Contes de ma m√®re
l'oye (1697; &quot;Tales of Mother Goose&quot;), a French folk expression roughly
equivalent to &quot;old wives' tales.&quot; The persistent legend that Mother Goose
was an actual Boston woman, Elizabeth Goose (Vergoose, or Vertigoose), whose
grave in Boston's Old
Granary Burying Ground is still a tourist attraction, is false. No evidence
of the book of rhymes she supposedly wrote in 1719 has ever been found. The
first U.S. edition of Mother Goose rhymes was a reprint of the Newbery
edition published by Isaiah Thomas in 1785.&quot;

Now that we all know the historic antecedents of Ms. Goose, who the hell is
the girl in my CDV?

A little birdie came and sat upon my window sill.
His song he sang so sweetly, without a moment's lull;
I gently closed the window

Vintage late '70s. Ain't it funny how these things get around? And
thanks for the original! I love to see how these things evolve...
