Top 10 Thai Food
Written by Panrit &quot;Gor&quot; Daoruang
Have you ever tried Thai food? Do you like it? Thai food is one of the things
that every foreigner should try when they come to Thailand. At my old school,
when we have visitors from other countries we always take them out to eat. We
take them to a Thai restaurant to try Thai food and also teach them about table
manners too!
Not long ago, the Office of the National Culture Commission announced the top
ten Thai dishes best liked by foreigners. In cooperation with the Ministry of
Foreigner Affairs, the Office had conducted a survey of Thai restaurants all
over the world to find out ten favourite Thai dishes of foreigners. In the
survey 1,000 Thai restaurant around the world were asked to fill in a
questionnaire. However, only 500 restaurants which have Thai chefs and offer the
authentic Thai food were qualified for being taken into consideration.
The results were the top ten Thai dishes which are listed below in order of
their percentages of popularity:
