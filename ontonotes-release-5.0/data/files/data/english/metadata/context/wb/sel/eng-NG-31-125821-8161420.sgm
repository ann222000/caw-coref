Seeing as this theft bollox is on the rise again I would like the help of
you power rangers who seem to get a lot of bikes nicked

Looking at getting this set for the garage

Almax Immobiliser III + Cisa 28550-67 Lock + Hardie Ground Anchor

and one of these in the wall outside the flat.

Hardie Ground Anchor

Is that a decent choice?

Thanks
