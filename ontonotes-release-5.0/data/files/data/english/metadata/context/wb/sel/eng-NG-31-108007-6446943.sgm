Good morning all.....

We're still having a chilly spring up here in Manitoba.  Rainy, maybe even
freezing rain this morning, but at least a lot of the snow has melted.  No
sunshine today by the looks of it.

I have the woodstove fired up to take the chill off, and have been under an
afghan and shawl on the couch, reading until I can rouse DH out of bed.

I've been working on socks these days, using my Blue Moon Fiberarts "Lucy"
sock yarn.  This yarn was a special dye done in the name of Wendy of Wendy
Knits blog darling Ragdoll cat of the same name.  I used her chart to put
cats paws on the legs, and have started the heel flap of the first sock.  A
picture will be posted when the socks are complete.

I'm starting to make a list of possible Christmas gifts to be knitted, and
hopefully out of stash on hand.  Even though I put myself on a yarn diet at
the beginning of the year, it didn't last (laugh).  A friend took me to a
LYS last week, run by an older lady who (of course) wants to sell and
retire.  If she does, all we'll have left here is Michael's and Ram Wools.
Her store was a revelation.... she had some nice discontinued yarns, and
still has some White Buffalo on hand.  I bought a dark blue, and a soft pink
cake.  I also picked up 3 balls of Patons Paradiso, which is a lovely thick
'n thin DK cotton yarn, in a soft pink/tan variegation.  I have no idea what
I'll do with it yet, but maybe something for my granddaughter.

Have a good weekend.

No snow in Montreal, but they tell me that there is still lots in
Labrador.
Right now I am glad I am here and not there. &lt;g&gt;

Higs,
Katherine (who has too much work to do to get much knitting done. I
shouldn't even be here now, but I needed a break.)

Well, it's Saturday night for me, and I spent the entire day (from
8:15 am - 4:00 pm) at the ball fields for Opening Day.  Both boys had
a game, and both played very well.  It was pretty cool for Mississippi
in late March, and the wind was blowing ahead of a storm system, so
the day was rather pleasant.  DH did get a sunburn through all the
clouds, though.  I came home and actually got a nap!  Everyone is
quiet now, and I think I'll get a little knitting done.

Happy Weekend!

We're just coming out of a cool snap.  Supposed to get up to 89F
(34C) tomorrow.  I'm going with a friend to the Renaissance Festival.
I'm still working on the same sock and the same jumper.   I did
finish and send off a chemo cap for SIL though.
I got down to the LYS last week and picked up a few balls of the
new Tofutsies yarn heh heh.  That stuff is gorgeous!  Also got a
couple of balls of the new Trekking colors, I specially craved the
green one and a real colourful one they had.   Theres a sale going on
at Micheals- picked up 2 balls of Cha Cha in Ice Blue to make a friend
a scarf with for her birthday.  They have all of their fur yarns and
pounders on sale along with a lot of other yarn, but I managed to
restrain myself for a change.  The stash is getting out of hand around
here!  Need more time to knit....
