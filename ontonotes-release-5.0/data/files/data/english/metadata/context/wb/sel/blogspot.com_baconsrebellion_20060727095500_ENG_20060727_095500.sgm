Maintaining the integrity of the power grid is one of those topics
that make your eyes glaze over -- until the power grid collapses and the
lights go out, as it did for much of Virginia after Hurricane Isabel in
2003, and then it becomes all-consuming.

But the power grid gets the juices flowing every day at Virginia
Tech's Consortium for Energy Restructuring. Many of the power grid's
vulnerabilities could be alleviated through the use of Distributed
Generation (DG), argues Richard Hirsh, the Virginia Tech technology
historian who leads the interdisciplinary consortium. Writes Hirsh in
the latest edition of Virginia Tech Research :

It makes sense to begin moving toward a decentralized system that
contains small-scale, modular, and diverse types of equipment that
produce power close to cities or even within buildings that use a lot of
electricity. Employing diesel generators, or better yet -- from an
environmental point of view -- fuel cells, micro turbines, and
photovoltaic cells, such a system would reduce the strain on the
existing grid by providing power to users without depending on
transmission lines at all. The economic viability of Distributed
Generation has improved in recent years thanks to technological advances
such as metering enhancements, fuel conversion technology, thermal
engineering, and automation and control devices.

Adoption of a DG strategy is impeded in many states, however, by
monopoly rules and discriminatory rate structures protecting established
electric utilities. The Virginia Tech article was not clear what
barriers might exist in Virginia -- other than the fact that electric
rates here are lower than the national average, which is hard to
complain about -- but a worthy goal of the task force developing
recommendations for a state energy policy would be to investigate what
might be done to encourage Distributed Generation in Virginia.

Distributed energy? Well, that's interesting. But what about the
deregulation of the electric utility industry? Now there's a subject for
you (if not for the ages).

The General Assembly--with a few exceptions--pretty much rolled over
for the electric utilities in adopting a "deregulation scheme" that was
to provide "competition and customer choice" (Ha!). Well, there are no
tother competitors out there as of this writing nor are there likely to
be. The General Assembly, in its wisdom (or the lack therof) provided
for a "wires charge" which you present utility company will be entitled
to receive from you no matter what other utility you select to frunish
your electricity. This means that no other utility can give you
competitive pricing.

The legislature has gone and deregulated a monopoly...we and our
children going to pay through the nose for that.

One thing more...regarding the "power grid". The transmission grid
was designed and developed over the years to transmit power from the
utility's power generation plant to its certificated and regulated
territory. It has not been designed or constructed to deal with a
competitive market. As aresult there are some very real constraints on
the development of this market--that is, there aren't enough wires to
handle it.

There is going to be a very expensive cost involved to construct the
transmission lines necessary to handle this system...if it ever arrives
and some say the power companies don't wnat that--they just wanted to be
deregulated, period. This "free market" ain't gonna be "free". Trust me
on that.

When I was studying Environmental Economics and Energy Management in
Grad School, one of the few bright spots with real potential for savings
was Co-generation, a lesser form of community energy.

Through cogeneration you can use the waste heat from power generation
for other purposes such as hot water, heating, and cooling. The
technology existed than (and now) to sell the excess power to the grid.
There are some serious safety issues, but it can be and is done.

In some areas the power company is required to buy such power at
their highest marginal rate. From a practical standpoint this means that
if you have solar panels, they run your meter backwards all day when you
are not using much power, and then you buy it back in the evening and
morning.

But like hybrids, he technology has been around for decades. Some
people will prefer to buy power than get involved in a bunch of
engineering and maintenance headaches.

I wouldn't hold my breath.

How to get the ball rolling-

Solar School initiative.

New Jersey's doing it, Ohio's doing it, Florida's doing it.

WHY NOT VIRGINIA?

This makes the schools earn back taxpayer money/energy costs during
the summer. It makes schools into better community emergnecy shelters.
It helps make solar/DG projects more visible.

Its for the children, dammit!

Scott, we went around on this before. The reason it isn't done is
that it costs more than you get back.

We can build all the money losing solar demonstration projects we
like, and all they'll demonstrate is how to lose money. There are plenty
of solar applications that DO make economic sense, but the NJ plan isn't
one of them.

Boondoggles such as this are a good example of why NJ has one of the
highest tax structures.

You have not proven ANYTHING, Ray.

We need to plan for the FUTURE, not live in the past.

http://renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=45445

"Every year, each square kilometre of desert receives solar energy

equivalent to 1.5 million barrels of oil. Multiplying by the area of
deserts

worldwide, this is nearly a thousand times the entire current energy

consumption of the world."......

"The cost of collecting solar thermal energy equivalent to one barrel
of oil

is about US$50 right now (already less than the current world price
of oil)

and is likely to come down to around US$20 in future. Contrary to
what is

commonly supposed, it is entirely feasible and cost-effective to
transmit

solar electricity over long distances."

Both.

The National Association of College & University Business Officers
(NACUBO) has just issued a book called "The Business Case for Renewable
Energy: A Guide for Colleges & Universities." There's lots of how-to
info in the book. Many colleges are implementing 200 KW, 400 KW, even 1
MW renewable energy projects. With creative financing, state incentives,
and deals with utilities, they are making money on these projects.

Creative Financing and Incentives sounds like another way to say the
project doesn't make money. The school might but the state doesn't, over
all.

In 2003, a residential solar system costs about $8,000-$12,000 per
kWp installed. A typical home uses on the order of 10kwhrs per year, and
a 1kWp system won't consistently deliver 1kW.

Realistically you are looking at spending $60,000 or more in initial
cost for a home built and maintained system that might meet half your
needs or less.

That means the payback is over 50 years, and the solar cells won't
even last that long. Somebody is going to have to wash and care for
those things for fifty years, too.

That doesn't mean it is not worth doing: between now and 50 years
from now, no doubt the economics will change in your favor, just as it
already has with my Hybrid vehicle.

Solar thermal is a whole different ballgame, but it isn't free
either, far from it.

If you sell a product with inflated claims or unrealistic
expectations, then you will disappoint the market and set your goals
back more than forward.

We can go back and forth about the feasability all day until we have
proof of concept. I still question your numbers against. It's like
global warming- what will it take to make you a believer?

As I have expressed, there are many other positive factors to
consider- the cost of fossil fuel pollution offset by solar, the
reliability of solar vs. the grid, advances in nano and fuel cell
solar-enhancing technology, etc.

As others have expressed, the real barrier to distributed power are
the Dominion Power lobbyists.

Jim - Isn't it great when folks ignore the links you give and just
jump in with their opinions?

Anonymous: “ there aren't enough wires to handle it ”

Link: “... DG technologies would mean fewer power lines and large
plants”

Hyde: “ ...prefer to buy power than get involved in a bunch of

Link: “... “plug and play” grid-interface connectors.”

Hyde: the “ technology has been around for decades .”

Anybody claiming electronics technology isn’t changing is .... oh
nevermind. LOL

No wonder “ the [Virginia Tech] group realizes that non-technical
factors seem to be greater impediments to the acceptance of the
small-scale generation technologies. ” It'd be great if a couple of

Jim, and Scott, I'm on your side on this. Distributed power has great
potential. But it is still just potential (pardon the pun).

It is not yet cost effective for most people. Part of the reason is
non-technical, the costs will come down when enough people adopt it, and
people will adopt it when the costs come down.

Burbank Water and Power - Solar Photovoltaic Power.htm has a good
discussion of solar from the poer companies perspective. They will buy
your excess power and pay you a partial rebate for installing it. Their
primary concern is that you match the phase when you hook up, and they
need to know what the distributed power sources are so they don't grab a
wire they have turned off, but which is powered from someplace else.
Even with plug and play connectors, someone is going to have to be
notified, and someone is going to have to inspect.

Even with the rebate, Burbank Power figures your payback is greater
than 20 years. You can hardly expect them to put themselves out of
business, but they are not entirely opposed either, there are just a lot
of issues to be worked out. Competitive Enterprise Institute also has a
good discussion, and those guys are pro-everything.

As for myself, I have to invest my money in something that will pay
back in five years, or else I'm just wasting money. And, of course, if
you just don't have the capital, there is no choice to be made. But long
before I get around to PV cells I probably should invest in insulation
and storm windows. Even plug and play stuff has to be maintained.
Suppose you have a bunch of PV panels on your roof. Then the roof leaks.
Sounds like a maintenance nightmare, even if it doesn't involve the
panels themselves.

Consider the solar pond. Here you just make a pool and supersaturate
it with salt. Then float skim of fresh water over the top. The fresh
water won't mix with the salt because of the density gradient, and it
prevents the heat from escaping through convection. In a few days the
salt water portion will be boiling. Ore-Ida uses this sytem to heat the
oil they use for making french fries. This is simple and cheap, but just
try to get a permit to build one. And the technology has been around for
decades.

I'm fascinated by pie in the sky stuff. I had a set of plans for a
hybrid car conversion thirty years ago, but that was a pie I never got
around to baking myself, instead I waited for Toyota to bake it for me.
So, when Dominion power shows up with a truck and wants to place some
panels on my lot, I'll be happy to rent them the space.

That's your choice as a private consumer (or is it?, look at the way
the laws are written for off the grid applications, especially insurance
and building laws), but as a taxpayer and citizen, I demand that my
government look long term and start applying technologies that a) save
money in the long term, b) offer better service than the current ANTIQUE
grid, especially in emergencies, c) are cleaner, safer, and less
polluting.

And in the case of Solar Schools, d) teach children about
alternatives.

Your arguments are based on the same old view of solar as 1970's
technology. Believe me, it has progressed, but our laws and government
have not.

I have already told about some other states, but look at what other
countries are doing- U.K., China, Portugal. We are falling behind, and
its attitudes like yours that are causing it.

Ray, there is a pie-in-the-sky element to the Distributed Grid
concept -- at this point in time. But technologies are steadily
improving, making solar more competitive in a wider array of
applications.

I oppose subsidies. Every energy technology should compete on its
economic merits. However, I also don't believe in excluding certain
technologies because they can't easily connect to the grid.

Even if centrally supplied power is cheaper, some people would be
willing to pay a premium to produce energy locally and insulate
themselves from disruptions to the grid. I paid $2,000 for an electric
generator that spends 99.5 percent of its time sitting unused in my
garage. But I was awfully glad to have it when Hurricane Isabel cut off
my neighborhood's electric supply for 11 days. If I thought I could
generate my own electricity with solar cells after a cataclysmic event,
I would pay a premium for that assurance. So would a lot of people who
have lived through a hurricane or a blackout/brownout.

Hey, I'm on your side. As far as I know there is nothing to prevent
me from putting up a PV installation. No law to prevent it. I've even
got plenty of room. I just don't have $60,000 lying around that I can't
spend more usefully on something else. For some other people, they may
have more money or different priorities. More power to them. Let me ask,
Scott, have you got PV power on your house?

I wonder when somebody will come up with a kit so we can use our
hybrids as emergency generators instead of investing another pile of
money in a generator. (Jim, my backup generator only cost $450, but of
course it won't run everything, just what's really needed.)

I don't have any problem with investing for the long term: I'm an
early adopter and a patient investor. But the long term needs to be
something short of infinite. You need to recognize that you can't have
long term profits without short term profits: other wise you never reach
the long term.

And, by the way, you also have to recognize that if you accept lower
short term profits while you are witing for the long term ones to
materialize, then that also means you will be poorer in the meantime.

Probably, this is another case where the "alternatives" are really
"additionals", just like alternative modes transit. As long as they are
additional, they can't be cost savers, or not very much. They will
really become alternatives when we have no other alternatives.

It might very well be that the government has a legitimate interest
in making us all poorer in favor of some public good, like lower fossil
energy consumption.

I just don't see how you get elected or stay elected with a platform
that says, "Hey, I'm going to make you poor and miserable so your great
grandchildren will be rich (maybe).

This country is going to have to face up to the damage of its elected
leaders' short-sighted thinking- war, debt, pollution, etc.

As with many things, the opportunity costs are important. Even if
there is more expense connected to renewable, distributed solutions,
something I do not believe is true, then I would gladly be willing to
accept those costs over the ever increasing costs of our ever increasing
reliance on a fossil fuel grid that is failing.

Again, look at current laws that put huge insurance requirements on
cogeneration, look at current laws that make it illegal to build a
full-time dwelling that is not connected in some way to the grid.

Do I have solar or wind on my small house in Richmond? No, I am
surrounded by large trees and other larger houses on a small plot that
make it virtually impossible. I have told some of my neighbors with
better locations that I am willing to help finance renewable solutions
for their houses. It would be great if local banks and community
development corporations can help fill this need.

However, I do have an old high school just down the block that would
be perfect for solar and wind installation. I am hoping Wilder's City of
the Future plans will include those ideas.

I'm all for it as long as I don't have to pay MORE for it, whether it
is mine or the school's.

Look at the bright side, everything gets its place in the sun.
Eventually those old trees will have to come down. We can use my sawmill
to recycle them into framework for your PV System, and you will still
have shade for your house:-).

I'm not aware that it is illegal to build a home that is not
connected to the grid. In fact, it is legal to call your boat your full
time home, in which case you can be not only off the grid, but off the
continent, if you like. We are still going to need the grid though, in
order for distributed power to work. Right now, the grid is provided
"free" as a necessary means for the power companies to distribute fossil
fuel generated power. But if fossile fuel fails, someday, then someone
is going to have to pay to keep the grid up in order for distributed
power to work. Right now it looks rosy, because you don't have to pay
for the grid.

As for the insurance requirements, maybe they are based on past
history, and likely liability. If so, then that is part of the cost that
needs to be included in the sunny PV outlook.

And the banks prefer to lend money based on the proposed payback or
risk that there won't be any.

I think you are right: eventually the costs of distributed production
will be lower. We could look at distributed computing as a model, maybe.
The only place we differ is how soon eventually is, and what we can
reasonably do to hasten that time.

I just realized I forgot another important, obvious advantage to
distributed micropower- by bringing the possibility of energy generation
right to people's homes, right under their noses, they will be more
likely to recognize the benefits of energy conservation and efficiency.
If they recognize those things and are not allowed to ignore it from
afar, they are more likely to do something about it. Even on a small
scale, such as making only one room in the house energy independent,
more energy conservation and efficiency will offset more pollution and
increase ALL energy supply, giving much less reason to allow Dominion
Power to install nuclear reactors at Lake Anna.

It may be obvious but it should still be explicitly cited.

Four Out of Five New Home Buyers Want Solar

August 1, 2006 07:44 AM - Jeff McIntire-Strasburg, St. Louis, MO

Right on the heels of evidence that more Americans are choosing to
buy green power when it's available comes news that 80% of US residents
would also like to see home builders offer solar power as an option for
new houses, according to a survey by Japan's Sharp Electric Company (the
world's largest producer of solar cells).

The survey was conducted in May among 1,004 adults to measure their
perceptions of solar power. It showed that given the current energy
situation, three-quarters of Americans feel that solar energy is more
important today than ever, according to Sharp.

The number-one reason for homeowners to utilize solar power is to
save money on monthly utility bills, but respondents are also concerned
with using solar to decrease the United States' dependence on oil.

The survey showed that two-thirds of Americans are willing to pay a
premium for homes that have solar systems installed, according to Sharp.
One-half of those surveyed would spend up to 10 percent more for a
solar-equipped house, according to the company.

While some may question the results based on the survey's source,
clearly many Americans are finally recognizing that the often sizable
investment required for solar energy installations can pay healthy
dividends in reduced electricity and/or water heating costs over the
life of the system. As many builders are recognizing the value of green
construction, perhaps we're seeing a convergence of forces that will
make solar power, and other green housing features, the norm. Hey, we
can hope... ::Personal Tech Pipeline via It's Getting Hot in Here

OK. You have a $500,000 home. At todays rate the mortgage is $3038
per month. If you pay tenpercent more your mortgage is $3341 per month
or about $303 a month more. That will buy you a solar system that
provides on third of your power needs so it saves you about $75 to $100
per month.

And, the system will need to be replaced before the first system is
paid for on a thirty year note.

Where is the substantial dividend?

Ray, Like you, I am dubious that solar energy is economically viable
at this moment in time. But here's what you've left out of your
calculation: (a) the increasing cost of electricity (what happens to the
return on investment if the retail price of electricity increases 4
percent per year?), and (b) security from disruptions to the grid. I
used a generator to get through the aftermath of Hurricane Isabel, but
it was dicey for a couple of days when it was really hard to get
gasoline to run the thing. Of course, it's possible to get a natural
gas-powered backup generator, but the installation cost of that
approaches $5,000 and up.

Nope, I figured on gas prices increasing. When I bought the Prius the
return was dubious, but it is no longer in doubt. (Unless they charge me
a bloody fortune for a new battery someday.)

The payback on Solar PV just isn't there yet. If you think fuel
prices will go up enough to make it pay, like a factor of five, then you
might have to invest an equal amount in an arsenal, because things will
be very ugly.

Even your natural gas generator is only ten percent of what PV costs.
But there is such a thing as a natural gas heat pump, and that might
make sense. It uses a natural gas engine to drive the generator and
compressor, and the waste exhaust heat is used for hot water, and or
additional space heating. This thing is your very own personal community
generating plant. It drives your electric meter backwards when it is not
turning the compressor, and recovers the waste heat. These are just now
becoming available but look for big improvements and price drops if they
ever take off.

Installing and maintaining it is nontrivial, but it is a technology
that does work and will pay.

I was on my generator for ten days before the power crews got here. I
was tired of listening to the thing. Now I'm in the market for one I can
run off the tractor, it would be a lot quieter.

I have enjoyed this set of commentary more than any other since I've
been reading Bacon's Rebellion.

Key points, however, not focused upon: who owns the transmission and
distribution infrastructure in Virginia (hint, think Dominion)? If there
is one owner and if legislation supports that, how would that entity
support or not support a change in distribution? I think that is an
important question. Also, why is fuel cell technology not proceeding in
America? It is effective in Europe. I would be happy to buy a battery
the size of a freezer to power my house for twenty years--it could be
financed with the house.

Last, remember our ancesters: they never knew a grid existed and used
the fireplace and other available fuels as needed. They survived off the
grid just fine albeit with a radically different ecnonomy.

They didn't have to go into an office to work; however, they needed
no phones, no computers, no satellites. Air conditioning? They were
probably happy they weren't freezing for a change.

Maybe their lives were better for the lack of appliances. Happiness
doesn't really seem tied to electricity.

I appreciate Ray Hyde's commentary. < $BlogBacklinkSnippet$>
