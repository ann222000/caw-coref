Hi,

I don't know if the subject title originated with Miss Piggy of The
Muppetshow fame, but it surely describes the thoughts running around
my brain after reading the latest blog entry by Scott Krol over at
Shrapnel.

Short version : board wargames started off pretty simple, when it
caught on people wanted to differentiate themselves from the guys
playing risk hence the move to more complex games which translated to
monster games and other monstrosities like ASL which ultimately turned
out to be a dead-end evolution for boardgames and a factor in their
demise. Scott Krol observes the same evolution to complexity now
happening in mainstream games.

But what about wargames ? Is there also a drive to complexity, based
on elitism ?

I mean real wargames, not the click-'n-twitch RTS stuff ... uh-oh.

Implying that guys who play RTS games are brain-dead zombies who just
manage to &quot;win&quot; by being faster at clicking stuff on the screen may be
just a tad elitist, isn't it ? I mean, isn't a prerequisite for being
able to be good at clicking fast on various stuff located all over a
vast battlefield  a brain which keeps track of all the things in the
first place ? A brain which can think *and* react fast ?

A second element for consideration is that I heartily detest a
tendency in our current society which strives for egalitarianism by
bringing everyone down to the lowest common denominator. I believe in
a level playing field and a bar that is set at a certain height. If
100% of those that try don't make it, that is not problem hence no
&quot;solution&quot; (which mostly consists of lowering the bar) is needed. 80
IQ points guys are not going to be rocket scientists, no matter how
much money you throw at it.

So, two questions.

1) Does playing wargames really require more grey matter than playing
RTS games or are wargamers just slow thinkers ?

2) Is elitism a factor in wargaming and can it lead us to an
evolutionary dead-end ?

Greetz,

RTS games require a different skill set than your average wargame,
skills that appeal more to a younger audience. ...  but I don't think
wargames require more skill.

I do think that wargames require more thought to do well. By their
very nature, you have more time to think about what you're doing than
in an RTS so to be good at it,  you have to spend more time thinking.

Nah. If that were the case, WitP would have been the start of a trend,
not an aberration. I think the good developers are actually getting it
right these days. Games like COTA. WaW or AACW do have a lot of
complexity but it's 'under the hood' and running in the background.
That plays to the strength of a computer, you can have complex models
driving the game engine but that doesn't mean that it has to be a
complex game.

Overall, I'm an optimist when it comes to the future of wargames.

Wargaming asks for more imagination, pushing counters over a map,
figuring out terrain, rivers, fortifications (symbolised by icons) etc
asks more of your grey matter than having 3D figures running around a 3D
map with little buildings and enemy figures.
Maybe there is also a little more long term planning in wargames than in
RTS games and the 'reward' in wargaming is less visual, less direct

Is opera or ballet more elitist than house, rap or R&amp;B? Yes. Is it an
evolutionary dead-end? No. Just another audience, another market to target.

Maybe not in the way that you mean.

If a new American Civil War game comes out tomorrow, I will probably
have a pretty good chance of diving right into it.  The teenager next
door probably will not.  Is it because I'm smarter?

Because if a new game based on, say, the Pokeman universe were to come
out tomorrow, I'd probably have a hard time getting into it.  Much
harder than that teen next door.

I think a key here is that historical wargames have an added layer of
complexity to make them historical.  By contrast, the Orcs versus Elves
genre can streamline mechanics to achieve better gameplay.  On average,
the rock-paper-scissors mechanic is going to be &quot;dumber&quot; than the
armor-slope-penetration mechanic; but on a case-by-case basis this is
not necessarily true.  Likewise on a player-by-player basis.

Historical wargames have a barrier to entry.  This added complexity is
of no value to someone who isn't interested in the historical nature of
the games.  That a wargame is too complicated or not fun sounds like a
refusal to exercise the gray matter, but its also a statement about what
the player sees as pleasurable about the game play.

So I think playing wargames requires a pre-requisite interest in the
history of warfare.  With that interest, the added details of the
wargame are part of the pleasure.  Take that away, and its a bunch of
useless chrome that inhibits good game design.

So does an interest in the history of warfare imply more engaged gray
matter than an interest in collecting Pokeman cards?  I would tend to
think so.  But my point is that most wargamers are such, not because
wargames provide them with the pinnacle in intellectual stimulation, but
because wargames are supporting a hobby in which they are already taking
part.

Not so much, if you buy my previous paragraphs.

Is someone really going to say, &quot;I'd like to read up some more on that
second battle at Manassas, but those wargame buffs are such a bunch of
self-important bastards that I guess I won't.&quot;

than the editorialists at the NY Times to survive, it beclaim clear that
computers actually reduced the complexity of, say, operating the tank's
cannon.  Where in the past there were rangefinders, azimuths, and good
ol' Kentucky windage, now you just put the sight on the target; as you
point out, computer complexity properly handled occurs in the
background.

I have to agree with this statement. My Mrs thinks I spend most of my time
looking at maps and moving 'envelopes'* around on it. Whereas in fact in my
imagination I can see the battalions of troops battling it out for a win.

*For some bizarre reason my Mrs thinks an infantry counter using standard

Wargaming isn't elitist. I'd describe it more as 'niche'. When I used to
play table top games (up until the last 5 years or so), if anyone found out,
they'd accuse me of 'playing with toy soldiers', which for a 30 something is
more of a derogatory term rather than an elitist reference. :)

I agree completely. I realized this when discussing a game I enjoyed with my
brother once. I wanted to get him interested in the game, but he remained
non-committal and evasive, even after he had tried the game out. Finally
after pushing him on the issue, he replied &quot;I like to get lost in my games,
I don't like it to feel like work&quot;.

Now my brother is not a stupid man by any means, but he does not have the
abiding interest in military history that I do, and he gets no enjoyment out
of playing a wargame. He much prefers a session of WoW, or a graphically
pleasing RTS than a thought provoking wargame any day of the week. The
gaming *hook* for him is his ability to forget real life for a while and
simply have some mindless fun. I don't think many (if any) wargames can fall
into the category of mindless fun. They all require some level of thought be
put into them to do well, and if you're not interested in what you are
required to think about, it feels like work.

RTS, FPS and other genre's require less thought be put into them and rely
more on an ability to react quickly to a situation (reflexes). So I don't
think we wargamers are elitists, rather we are simply a different set of
gamers. I personally hate any kind of reflex oriented game and play few if
any of those genres that rely heavily on reflexes. That doesn't mean I don't
have good reflexes (I do), it simply means I don't get any enjoyment out of
games that rely heavily on reflexes.

It's strange how many programmers and software designers can't seem to
grasp that simple concept.

Maybe it's something that just isn't taught in college? My degree was
focused more on hardware than software but in the early 80s when I
went to school useability wasn't ever a topic of discussion. Then
again, it's hard to discuss a user interface when you're programming
on a punch tape with flashing LEDs as an output. Going to punchcards
and a mainframe was a MAJOR upgrade for the higher level courses! &lt;g&gt;

I'd hope that's changed by now though.

I was in college for CS at the same time, and ... well, why would
usability be a factor when virtually everyone involved with the computer
or the system's software was a computer geek?  Worse than that, the
acolytes running the Big Iron looked on obscurity and unusability as a
sort of badge of rank; &quot;Oooooooo, so-and-so uses all 24 function keys on
a 3274!!!!!&quot;

It was only when computing left this ivory tower that someone went,
&quot;Hmmmmm.  Do we really need two-dozen function keys on that space-kadet
keyboard?  Would 36 Fkeys be 50% better still?&quot;

I don't think &quot;elitism&quot; is the word I would use to describe a desire
for games to adhere to an historically accurate consensus of How
Things Actually Happened at the Battle of Whatever, any more than I
think the word describes an ability to appreciate of the art of cello
playing in philharmonic orchestras.  Ok, I'll own up to being a
&quot;grognard,&quot; but to me, that word does not imply any sort of elitism;
it implies a certain amount of knowledge of the subject at hand.  IMO,
being able to discuss the differences between a Douglas Dauntless and
a Curtis Helldiver doesn't make anyone an elitist, nor should anyone
who can't tell one from the other assume that it does.  However, those
who create wargames had better be aware of these things if they intend
to sell me a game, just as those who compose for cellos had better be
aware of *their* intended audience's expectations.

And I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;evolutionary dead end.&quot;  If you
mean that historical wargames (in contrast to generic shoot-em-ups)
will never appeal to the mass market, you're probably correct - but
then they never did - and I don't think that's a Bad Thing   If a PC
wargame sold 5,000 copies in 1985, it would have been considered
*wildly* successful.  A PC wargame that sold an identical amount in
2007 would be considered a failure when measured by the standards of
today's marketplace for PC games.  The potential market for PC games
has swelled beyond anyone (in 1985's) expectations, but the number of
players demanding historically accurate wargames has not, or at least,
not appreciably so.  I'm sure the developers are aware of all this and
devote the appropriate amount of funding (read: not much) to the
development of the kind of games that we here like best.  That can't
be helped, and as far as *this* wargamer is concerned, I see nothing
wrong with making do with less than state-of-the-art programs as long
as they fulfill my need to Be There, at an historic moment in the
history of warfare.  I don't happen to think my hobby is a cultural
dead end (and most certainly *not* an evolutionary dead end!), but
even if it's perceived that way by outsiders, so what?

The kind of wargames that the majority of the posters in this forum
enjoy will *never* be as popular as the kind of crap that tops the
best seller list.  So why are we still worrying about it?  ;-)

The question is not irrelevant when you look at how many wargamers nod
approvingly when someone mentions &quot;kiddie RTS games&quot;. Personally I
don't like RTS games because it pains me to see Shermans and Tigers
take potshots at each other from 30 meters distance but I don't equate
RTS gamers with uneducated morons. They just find pleasure in acting
fast in a particular environment. The recent World in Conflict comes
to mind here. I know this guy who's waaaaay smarter than I am and who

The boardgame world at one point got stuck when almost all the games
produced were either unimaginative clones or monster games.
Playability and fun went right out of the window. A situation like
that is self-correcting as customers stopped buying the stuff and
companies went out of business but it took a decade for things to look
up again.

Oh, sure, the boardgames getting produced today are generally
excellent - way better than what it used to be even in the so-called
Golden Days - but while excellent boardgames can and are produced in a
P500 system, excellent computer wargames can't exist beneath a certain
sales threshold as it takes much more work to create a computer game
than it does a boardgame. And never mind the fact boardgame publishers
can ask more money for them too.

What I also want to avoid is the trap flight simmers find themselves
in : they've got a few excellent products, but rarely do they get new
toys to play with. I know why I stopped playing flight sims : because
the &quot;elitists&quot; demanded so many realistic features that it took the
fun right out of it for me, the average guy with an average flightsim
interest.

Looking down on &quot;easy&quot; wargames like Commander : Europe at War and
making fun of those who like the game is the first step on the road
taken by the hardcore, elitist flight simmers. See where it got them.

I was there when it happened.

We had this DOS program which really could do anything the user ever
wanted - and the UI was in fact pretty ok. Then Windows 3.0 came along
and our customers simply demanded we provide them with a Windows
version of it which used those nice buttons and edit boxes. They
didn't care that the Windows version actually ran slower than the DOS
one and that the database driver was a bit iffy resulting in regular
lock-ups. At first I couldn't get my head around the fact that anyone
sane of mind and body would prefer what was unquestionably a worse
version of our product, but they did. Mostly because Windows offered a
friendly UI environment in which every program had a nice &quot;Ok&quot; button
to confirm something instead of having to hit &lt;F5&gt; in one and &lt;F7&gt; in
another.

UI matters - a lot.

There's nothing new about that concept in corporate culture, but prior
to the PC era, popular games like Monopoly and Risk had a concept that
would insure *decades* of sales.  How many PC or console games last
even *2* years at the top of the best seller list?  Corporate game
developers today, for better or worse, are stuck in a Make It Now or
Miss It Now cycle.  They have no choice and given the huge
expenditures associated with a state-of-the-art programming, they
*must* aim for the largest possible result.  A single blockbuster best
seller can be so successful, it can pay for years of failures.

The board wargames we played 30 and 40 years ago could never have
competed with the best selling games of that era and no one ever
expected them to; likewise today's PC wargames.  That's why most of
the games we talk about around here are the products of hobbyists and
independent (read: impoverished) developers.

That may be so, but sometimes RTS aficionados take a similar view of
us grognards (i.e. we're slow and stupid).  In other words, the
disdain that one side may feel for the other is just a result of
immature socialization processes.  Maybe I'm just splitting hairs
unnecessarily, but ....

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Is elitism a factor in wargaming and can it lead us to an
&gt;&gt;&gt; evolutionary dead-end ?

&gt;&gt; And I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;evolutionary dead end.&quot;

&gt; The boardgame world at one point got stuck when almost all the games
&gt; produced were either unimaginative clones or monster games.
&gt; Playability and fun went right out of the window. A situation like
&gt; that is self-correcting as customers stopped buying the stuff and
&gt; companies went out of business but it took a decade for things to look
&gt; up again.
">

I don't think the &quot;boardgame world got stuck,&quot; I think they simply
reached the limit of their target audience to absorb new material.  A
good boardgame (and IMO, a good PC game) is still a good game even
after it's been played hundreds of times.  Unlike the popular
marketplace, board wargaming did not need a new game every year, and
certainly not dozens of new games every year.  In other words, that
market was very easy to saturate.  I think that's the current state of
PC wargaming - but maybe that's just me!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Oh, sure, the boardgames getting produced today are generally
&gt; excellent - way better than what it used to be even in the so-called
&gt; Golden Days - but while excellent boardgames can and are produced in a
&gt; P500 system, excellent computer wargames can't exist beneath a certain
&gt; sales threshold as it takes much more work to create a computer game
&gt; than it does a boardgame. And never mind the fact boardgame publishers
&gt; can ask more money for them too.

&gt; What I also want to avoid is the trap flight simmers find themselves

&gt; the &quot;elitists&quot; demanded so many realistic features that it took the
&gt; fun right out of it for me, the average guy with an average flightsim
&gt; interest.
">

Sorry, I think that's a bogus argument.  Every realistic flight sim
with which I'm familiar has had an 'easy' mode where realism takes a
back seat to fun.  What I think happened, is what I stated above.
There is simply no reason why I should not keep right on playing Red
Baron 2 (and I do) so I'm just not interested in further WW1 combat
sims.  The same can be said for WW2 and the modern era.  I already
*have* several good sims from each era and I'm quite satisfied with
them.  The only possible improvement could be in the area of finer
graphics, but I consider that to be a minor point.  Red Baron 2 (with
all the patches applied) had *excellent* graphics, at least as good as
my poor old eyes can appreciate.  I don't need better graphics.  I
don't need better campaigns.  So what do I need another flight sim for?

The same thing happened with sub sims.  All that Silent Hunter ever
needed was a slightly tweaked campaign engine (to put actual 'hunting'
into the game like Aces of the Deep), it didn't need a graphic
overhaul.  I don't want to look at the *outside* of my sub, or watch a
torpedo from an underwater perspective, I want to experience the
thrill of commanding a US submarine on patrol in Injun country.  I
already have that with SH1 which I still play.  SH2 was a broken
wreck, a programming disaster which had to be saved by third-party
hobbyists, and SH4 doesn't seem to offer me anything I actually want,
just irrelevant bells and whistles!  So, I'll pass on them.  That has
nothing to do with their inherent complexity or simplicity.  It has to
do with the longevity of their predecessor(s).

What can any state-of-the-art military sim today offer me that I don't
already get from my stable of favorites?  These games just aren't the
same sort of disposable fluff that FPS and RTS games are.  That may be
another reason why developers favor them; they have a quantifiable
shelf-life.  When the next year's Big Thing hits the stores, their
core audience will be ready for it.

">

&lt;laughter&gt;  I can't imagine anyone whose feelings would be so easily
trampled by me poking fun at their choice of wargame ever enjoying a
year or so engrossed in playing War in the Pacific!  But if those who
enjoy 'lite' wargames take umbrage at any disparaging remarks, they'll
probably just throw that bullshit right back at us - if they have any
stones, that is!   ;-)

Don't know - a little less than in the US I guess because acceptance
of the IBM PC also lagged a couple of years behind the US curve. What
I do know is that I gave &quot;Windows introductory&quot; classes to our branch
managers and that one of the exercises included was learning how to
double-click with the mouse without actually moving it of the
button :) - and they all *loved* the Windows UI and scoffed at the DOS
PC and 3270 terminal screens they had at the time.

I neglected to mention one other factor because it may be entirely
specific to my case: eyesight.  My uncorrected vision is 20/100 L and
20/200 R.  With my (very thick) glasses on, that becomes 20/40, 20/60
- not exactly fighter pilot qualifications!  As each new generation of
flight sim has been released, it has increased screen resolution to
the point where other aircraft in the sky appear realistically small.
They've become too difficult for me to see even at the lowest
available resolution.  There are ways to ameliorate that problem,
on-screen labels for example, but those really don't help much in
discerning important things like aspect ratio and closing rate.

I don't really find that an issue with more contemporary sims. The old games
like 1942:PAW used one pixel to represent a plane in the distance and now
with higher res they use a few more than one so I can actually make out a
plane shape in the distance. Red Baron3D had good atmosphere and dynamic
campaign but First Eagles improves on it in quite a few areas. Still not as
realistic as I want it though.

I read the initial beta reviews of First Eagle about a year ago, but
lost interest when I discovered that it only modeled *3* aircraft.

I've got the Full Canvas Jacket super-mod for Red Baron 3D, and
IMNSHO, the combination produced the best flight sim ever made with a
nearly incomparable campaign engine.  The only sim that ever came
close in my estimation was Falcon 4 (after numerous patches were
applied, of course!)
