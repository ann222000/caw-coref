Glue To Melt Paper Onto Sheet Metal?

I have an anti-tamper label that I want to glue onto the seal between two
halves of a metal enclosure.   I would appreciate specific product
recommendations for a glue that would meet these requirements.   Assume the
enclosure is made of galvanized sheet metal and the anti-tamper label is
made of a porous paper such as that used for paper currency.

- The glue must "melt" the paper onto the metal such that it is impossible
to remove the paper without completely destroying it.

- The glue must not deform or alter the coloration of the galvanized sheet
metal.

- The paper must be completely removable using a solvent, without damage to
the underlying sheet metal.

Can someone recommend specific manufacturers and products for this
application?

Nitto 500.  It's a double coated tissue laminating adhesive.  Sticks
very well, but cleans up with semipolar solvent (EtAc or MEK)

I've used E6000, available at any hobby store, for similar
purposes. It's thicker and gummier than you might desire, based on how
you'd like it to "melt" into the metal; however, it's a very good
adhesive, inexpensive and readily available. Removal is straightforward.

Some of the Loctite cyanoacrylate adhesives offer the
characteristics you seek. Their tech support is very good:

Lastly, there are tamper-resistant and tamper-evident labels that
are very good. Some will disintegrate upon removal to indicate tampering,
while others will leave behind parts of the tape, spelling out "VOID" or
similar. A quick Google search will help.

The main problem with anti tamper labels that are commercially purchased is
that the bad guys can buy them from the same suppliers you do.   When a
single enclosure goes for $15K a pop, it's awfully tempting for a technician
who makes $15/hour to swap the contents of a good part with a bad one, make
a false claim that the part is defective, and walk away with $15K.    $15K
buys a lot of equipment to replace anti-tamper labels.

Someone in one of these groups in a similar thread had the nearly brilliant
idea to use the serial numbers on printed currency for the anti-tamper.
We like that idea a lot, because any modern currency uses multiple features
that are difficult to replicate and defeat.   It's highly unlikely that
someone making $15/hour is going to have the time, skill, and talent to
defeat the underlying patterns printed on the currency, let alone invest in
reprinting specific serial numbers on a one-off basis.

The main problem now is how to we ensure the paper is melted into the sheet
metal such that it cannot just be soaked in solvent and cleanly lifted off
in a single piece.  The glue has to be not only aggressive at binding, but
aggressive at dissolving the paper in a way that makes it easy to tear/rip
and impossible to just peal off cleanly.

Your notion of "melted into" is specious.

You obviously want a chemically inert, cross-linked thermoset resin, which
you will find at WalMart.

Why not ingrave the warning or etch it with acid?

Why does it not make sense to dissolve the paper so it starts to break down
and conforms closely to the surface under it?   The goal would be to make
the paper rip easily and in pieces if someone tried to peel it off, as well
as to force adhesion to the most contact points on the surface under the
paper.
