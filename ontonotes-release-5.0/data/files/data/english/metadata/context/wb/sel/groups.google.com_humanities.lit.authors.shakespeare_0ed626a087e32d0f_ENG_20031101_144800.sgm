writing about
Salomon de Caus,
I looked for more about him
with Google,

and found a page about his brother
Isaac de Caus,
who, interestingly, worked on the
gardens at Wilton House.

So, there is more than one pair of
brothers (First Folio) in this story!

Isaac de Caus' designs

at Wilton.

IMAGES from the book originally published by Isaac de Caus, Wilton
Garden,c1645 ( a facsimile published c1925) and in its original a rare
and comprehensive visual account of what a seventeenth century garden
could be. There is an excellent account in Roy Strong's The
Renaissance Garden in England, Thames &amp; Hudson London 1979, pp. 147 -
158.

A fascinating page with many images of the gardens, statues, etc.
which takes a little while to fully load.

&lt;&lt;the parterres were adorned with fountain sculpture by Nicholas Stone
- here the Susanna fountain.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------

Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke
(and 1st Earl of Montgomery, see here), K.G.,
born 16th Oct 1584,
mar 1stly, 27th Dec 1604, to Susan de Vere
[born 26th May 1587, descendant of Edward I]

The Countesse of Mountgomeries Urania 1621 refers to Susan,
written by his 1st cousin (and lover of his brother) Lady Mary Wroth,

Susan bur 1st Feb 1629, Westminster Abbey, age 41 yrs,
he succ as Earl of Pembroke, Apr 1630,

laid out formal gardens to the S of the house, on both the near and far
banks of the river, planted the Cedars of Lebanon in the grounds 1630s,

mar 2ndly, 1st June 1630 [her age 41], to Anne Clifford [born 30th Jan
1589],
employed Inigo Jones to spectacularly rebuild Wilton House starting 1635,
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery
(later Earl of Pembroke; 1584 - 1650)
Married 27 December 1604 Susan de Vere. With his brother William, he is the
dedicatee of the First Folio. In 1618 Jaggard, the publisher of the First
Folio, dedicated Archaio-Ploutos to him and his wife Susan. After his
brother's death in 1630, Philip Herbert became Earl of Pembroke.

Quoted from   , a family genealogy by Dr.
Mark Humphrys:

&quot;The Herbert family had numerous connections with Shakespeare, and also,
interestingly, with Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, who some claim is
the real Shakespeare:

1. De Vere's unhappy wife Anne Cecil had once been intended for Lady
Pembroke's brother Sir Philip Sidney. Anne married de Vere in 1571, and he
treated her badly.
2. Sidney (still then unmarried) and de Vere had a famous quarrel in 1579..
3. It is reputed that Shakespeare and his players first performed As You
Like It (1600) and perhaps Twelfth Night (prob. 1601) at Wilton (although
note that nearby Salisbury town, Wiltshire, also claims a particular spot as
the place where As You Like It was first performed).

4. The 3rd Earl of Pembroke was engaged to de Vere's daughter Bridget at
some time, before marrying another in Nov 1604.
5. The 4th Earl of Pembroke married de Vere's daughter Susan in Dec 1604.
6. Shakespeare's sonnets were dedicated to &quot;Mr. W. H.&quot; in 1609. This has
been identified with William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke
7. The first folio edition of Shakespeare's plays (pub posthumously 1623)
is dedicated to the 3rd and 4th Earls of Pembroke.&quot;
-------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The only St.Paul's monument to have survived the Great Fire:
a carving of poet John Dunne, by Nicholas Stone.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
From M. H. Spielmann, &quot;Shakespeare's Portraiture,&quot; in
*Studies in the First Folio* (Oxford University Press, 1924):

&quot;The mantling about the shield is contemporary in style, and the whole
exactly what we are accustomed to find from the tomb-makers of the
period, among whom Nicholas Stone, working in conjunction with Bernard
Janssen -- probably a kinsman of Garratt -- is a noteworthy example.
The same details reappear constantly in their work, both Bernard's and
Garratt's, in a whole series of tombs and monuments, and we need go no
farther than the Charterhouse and look there at the tomb of the pious
founder, Thomas Sutton, to recognize that such details, both
architectural and sculptural, were, as it were, stereotyped in the work
of these leaders of their craft -- stock designs used by the three men.
-----------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;In 1621, a gift of £250 from Henry, Lord Danvers (later Earl of Danby)
allowed the University of Oxford to take out the lease from Magdalen
College of a five-acre tract of meadowland, on a bend of the river
Cherwell beyond the East gate of the city, in order to set up a physic
garden there. Danvers' gift, together with the benefaction made by Sir
Henry Savile to found professorships of geometry and astronomy, promised
to transform the teaching of natural philosophy at Oxford. By 1632, the
buildings of what is now the University's botanical garden had been
erected by Nicholas Stone, a mason who had acted for INIGO JONES, and
work had begun to stock it with plants, following the model of earlier
physic gardens on the Continent. An attempt to persuade the elder John
Tradescant to accept the post of gardener failed in 1637, but, by 1641,
Jacob Bobart(c.1596-1680), a native of BRUNSWICK, had been appointed to
the post, with a lease on the garden of ninety-nine years, and the right
to sell fruit and vegetables from it. Bobart's tasks were 'to dresse
manure preserve and keepe the said Garden and from tyme to tyme sett
and plant the same with such herbes settes trees and plants as shall be
thought requesit and necessarie' (Vines and Druce, p.xvi), for which
Danby contracted to pay him £40 a year. Following Danby's death and the
sequestration of his lands during the Civil War, Bobart's salary went
unpaid for several years, and he lived from the sale of the Physic
Garden's produce while the University petitioned Parliament to have his
annuity restored. Bobart continued as gardener until his death, and was
succeeded in the post by his son, also called Jacob. His care for the
Physic Garden won the admiration of many visitors to Oxford, who were
impressed by the rare trees and plants which Bobart grew, by his
extraordinary topiary, and, increasingly, by the gardener's own bizarre
appearance (see  ).
In Bobart's hands, the Physic Garden recreated Eden, in which all
the plants of the world had flourished.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;The Stratford bust &amp; monument must have been
erected on the N. wall of the chancel or choir
within six years after Shakespeare's death in1616,
as it is mentioned in the prefatory memorial lines by Leonard
Digges in the First Folio. The design in its general aspect was
one often adopted by the &quot; tombe-makers &quot;of the period,

and according to Dugdale was executed by a *Fleming* resident
in London since 1567, Garratt Johnson (Gerard JANssen),

who was occasionally a collaborator with *Nick Stone*.
