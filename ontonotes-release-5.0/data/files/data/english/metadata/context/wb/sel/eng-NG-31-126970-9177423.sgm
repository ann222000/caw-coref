I have, as he points out you interpreted as the real numbers which I was not implying.

&gt; &gt; Mind you, achieving absolute zero, may be easier?

&gt; Well it would be with Gareth's number system. Start at 20 degrees C, cool
&gt; by 10 degrees, then 10 more, and then he'd have you believe cooling by 10
&gt; more would warm you up!

Sometimes I wonder whether you really do have the two degrees, one in
mathematics and the other in electronics, that you boast about; or whether
you really are a teacher of mathematics in Strood Kent, Brian?

You have received a drubbing from a well-respected contributor to
alt.engineering.electrical, one Don Kelly, but you have a pathologically
inability to accept or to admit that you could ever be wrong; an ability
that
borders on paranoia. That paranoia has surfaced above in
your deep-seated need to want to cause insult, in this case to me , because
I was the one who raised your ridiculous assertions about e^(-jwt) recently.

I think that I understand a little more about the difficulties that you
have in mathematics (You could resolve those difficulties by sitting
in on a KS2 class given by a _COMPETENT_ maths teacher BTW);
you do not understand the differences between scalars and vectors,
and you are unwilling to learn. The discussion has been about a vector
being the rotating phasor represented by e^(-jwt) but you are
trying to argue, quite pointlessly in my view, by an appeal to
temperature, a _SCALAR_ quantity in your rather silly and
infantile desperation above. You have also appealed to another
_SCALAR_ quantity in your examples about a bank balance.

I find it inconceivable that someone could graduate in mathematics
and/or electronics without understanding the differences between
SCALARS and VECTORS as you so ignorantly demonstrate.

I suggest that as a first step, you get hold of a book describing
Directed Numbers. You yourself recommended such a book
recently.....

&quot;Now I really do suggest you go back to some basic text on directed numbers:

&quot;
Perhaps Brian, you should learn to read the books that you recommend?

Brian, sometimes it is much simpler to just admit that you have been in
the wrong. Your squirming and abusive diversions only serve to make you
seem a bigger fool than you normally seek to appear.

Well Beanie, that proves Brian has a job, how about you?
