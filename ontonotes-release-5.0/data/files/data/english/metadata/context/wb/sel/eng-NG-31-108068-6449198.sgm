Which Round for a short barrelled 45 ACP
</HEADLINE>

Hi Dean and Group,

I've been considering a trade for a Taurus PT-145 and also recently
acquired an officers model 1911.  I know from the thread quoted below
that suitable personal defense rounds exist for these short barreled
45s, but would like some specific recommendations.

So, if a guy was going to select a store-bought load to carry in these
short barreled weapons, which ones should he try first?  I understand
that the round has to work each and every time in my own firearms, but
wonder which ones to try first.

I'm a bit on the frugal side, so my plan would be to buy a couple of
boxes of "load A", and see how they work.  If I can't get the gun to
work w/ Load A, then I'd get a couple of boxes of "load b" and so on
and so on.  Once I have a candidate or two I can do more extensive
testing with those loads, but I'd rather start with a round that is
considered by the rec.guns experts to be a good and useful round.
Otherwise I'll have my gun working w/ Load A and somebody will inform
me that "Load A is junk, you really need Load C".  I can assess the
shooting, accuracy, and reliability on my end but am not planning on
doing my own gelatin or even "wet phonebook" tests.

Any and all advice appreciated.

Thanks,

Betcha if you look more closely, you'll find that what you acquired is
actually an "Officer's ACP." Betcha betcha betcha.

You're somewhat limited in your selections at this point since the only ones
of which I'm aware are the Speer Gold Dot "Short Barrel Optimized."

I would not hesitate to spend the money to buy a box of top grade
ammo.

I would recommend the 225 grain or 230 grain bullets as I have used
the 185 grain expanding bullets and they failed miserably on deer. Not
enough penetration.

I believe you'll find the lighter bullet weights are more accurate in your
shorty pistol.  Try some premium 185 and 200 grain JHP loads and see which
one you like best.  - CW

I don't have those figures right here, but I'm sure the government has

Nor would I.  Actually read the above, and consider the economic
principle of diminishing marginal utility.  One or two boxes of top
grade ammo would be a really good thing.  Pallet loads of top grade
ammo might be wonderful given unlimited resources.  Given limited
resources, some top grade ammo and plenty of practice ammo (in
addition to regular practice/function checks with the carry ammo)
would probably be better.  If you can match the ballistics, felt
recoil, and point-of-aim for the cheaper ammo to the carry ammo that's
even better, but we'll save that discussion for another day.

For now I don't want to fill up a couple of shopping carts with
allegedly top grade ammo only to find that this particular round won't
function in my particular gun once I've got two pallets of the stuff
in my barn.  I'd rather buy a box or so first, evaluate, then buy in
bulk once I know what I want.  Given this approach, I also don't want
to buy 2 boxes of every type of .45 ACP known to man only to have lots
of leftovers after selecting a carry load.

It would be foolish to even start the process with a load that
wouldn't make a good carry load, but I don't personally have the
expertise or experience to know which loads would be best in a 3.25 or
3.5 inch barrel.  Hence the question.  Dean has already provided a
useful answer.  I'll acquire some of that load and see how it
functions in my gun.  If I know that there isn't a close second place
I'll try a little harder to get it to function reliably if there are
any problems.   I had already looked at published chrony results from
gun magazines for several loads before buying the Officer's model.
I'd be OK w/ just 230 grain ball but suspect we can do better.

&gt; ...

Which brings up the question I forgot to ask. I'm up here in the
frozen north.  We have very little crime.  If somebody gets shot (on
purpose) it's usually a meth dealer getting shot by a client or
something, and even at that it's very rare. We do however wear thick
coats in the winter time.  Police officer friends carry ball in the
winter and  hollowpoints in the summer (but not w/ .45 ACP).  Any
sense in this winter/summer load variance?  I guess a hollowpoint full
of Carhartt coat and sweatshirts is even less likely to expand out of
a 3.25 inch barrel.

Thanks,

&gt; ...

I have tried Winchester Rangers/ Federal Premium/ Speer GDs all in 230-
JHP. All of the brands just mentioned function reliably on all my .45
ACP platforms. Now it is up to that certain gun to facor that certain
brand/wieght/bullet type.

Those brands work on my: Glock 30/36, SA Loaded Comander, and Kimber
Ultra Carry (Snappy Recoil!) Since that you are refering to pistols
with short barrels, I listed mt stubby 45s. The above brands also work
on my fullsize 1911s/Glocks/Sigs with no problems AFTER a good break
in with some ball ammo. Some BRAND NEW guns do not to take well to
JHPs with a few hundred rounds of ball to loosen things up.

He never said he was hesitant to spend money on premium ammunition...he
stated he was only going to buy a couple of boxes to see if they would
function in his weapons, if not he was going to move on to another load. It
seems to me buying a case of one particular brand a bit premature if it
won't function in his guns, wouldn't you agree?

I'd start with good old military hardball (FMJ) 230 grains.  It won't
expand, but a .45 doesn't really need to expand to do a nice job, and it
should feed reliably in just about anything.

A short-barreled 45acp would be expected to produce slightly lower
velocity, and slightly increased muzzle flash. The lower velocity
might reduce the performance of a lightweight hollow point bullet, so
stick with the heavier, slower moving ones, such as the 230gr. Also
select rounds that feature reduced muzzle flash, such as the Hornady
TAP - FPD.

Jerry Poparad &lt;browninghighpow ... @yahoo.com&gt; chides Hank:

Jerry, before you continue to Poparad-off again, re-read the OP.

# I would not hesitate to spend the money to buy a box
# of top grade ammo.

# I would recommend the 225 grain or 230 grain bullets
# as I have used the 185 grain expanding bullets and they
# failed miserably on deer. Not enough penetration.

And, based on the OP's requirements, you would be all wet.

And based on your own limited empirical data, your suggestion is irrelevant.

Chas W &lt;chas ... @comcast.net&gt; suggests...

# I believe you'll find the lighter bullet weights are
# more accurate in your shorty pistol.

That's closer to being responsive to the OP, but it's still not what he was
asking.

# Try some premium 185 and 200 grain JHP loads
# and see which one you like best.

Again, non-responsive... his sole concerns are functionality in his pistol.
So it won't be what "he likes," but if his pistol works.

And as there is already a commercially available round engineered for his
"class" of pistol, all he has to do is make sure it is reliable in his gun.

Donald Bautista &lt;Donald.Bauti ... @gmail.com&gt; counsels...

# ...AFTER a good break in with some ball ammo. Some
# BRAND NEW guns do not to take well to JHPs with a few
# hundred rounds of ball to loosen things up.

I'm not sure you stated precisely what you intended, but "ball break-in" is
sage advice... timeless even, with any Colt's/Browning pattern .45 ACP
auto-loader, even with the more "modern" (post-1982) 1911-style guns.

My own standard was always 200 rounds of Ball M1911, some random samplings
of JHPs and 200-grain H&amp;G #268 SWCs... and then the "acid test" of the
no-longer manufactured stubby, wide-mouth Speer/CCI 200-grain JHP upon which
the late Dean Grennell for all time hung the sobriquet, "Flying Ashtray." If
a 1911-pattern pistol would feed 200 rounds of that without a bobble, it'd
feed anything forever!

(And yes, I still have half-a-case of that in Blazer squirreled away to use
as a proofing round!)

Hank &lt;HenryRear ... @gmail.com&gt; missed part of the message...

# I had already looked at published chrony results from gun
# magazines for several loads before buying the Officer's model.

(PSSSSSSSSST! Hank! It wasn't the apostrophe, it was "Officer's model."
{sic})

The original production pistol from Colt's, with the 3.5-inch barrel, was
the "Officer's ACP." The Colt's "Officer's Model" was two different
revolvers much earlier in the company's history.)

# I guess a hollowpoint full of Carhartt coat and sweatshirts
# is even less likely to expand out of a 3.25 inch barrel.

Depends on the design of the JHP, but even if it does "clog" and fail to
deform to .70-.75 caliber, it'll still perform at least as well as FMJ...
which seems to have worked fairly well for almost 100 years.

Which is kinda what Bob &lt;zxcv ... @charter.net&gt; was getting at when he added:

# I'd start with good old military hardball (FMJ) 230
# grains. It won't expand, but a .45 doesn't really
# need to expand to do a nice job....

There ya go! And Bill Rueck &lt;wil ... @gte.net&gt; as well:

# I use Federal 200 grain Tactical EFMJ [Expanding Full
# Metal Jacket] product number P45CSPI in my PT145.

A very most excellent choice, even with the shorter barreled pistols.

John Cowart &lt;cowartmi ... @yahoo.com&gt; adds:

# A short-barreled 45acp would be expected to produce
# slightly lower velocity, and slightly increased muzzle flash.

Hence the suggestion to the O.P. to take the Speer "Short Barrel Optimized"
rounds for a spin.

# The lower velocity might reduce the performance, so
# of a lightweight hollow point bullet...

Hence the suggestion to the O.P. to take the Speer "Short Barrel Optimized"
rounds for a spin.

# ...stick with the heavier, slower moving ones, such as
# the 230gr. Also select rounds that feature reduced
# muzzle flash, such as the Hornady TAP - FPD.

Hank doesn't need to because... wait for it!... ATK/Speer thoughtfully came
up with the "Short Barrel Optimized" rounds.

Almost certainly not the original "Flying Ashtray," or else Natchez hasn't
been moving much product of late!

When that projectile-making machine gave up the ghost about six-seven years
back, CCI/Speer determined it was impractical/uneconomical to rebuild it,
and simply brought the 200-grain Gold Dot bullet on-line in the same SKU
#CC3568.

I got a case of it in error back the year following its discontinuance,
thinking I'd discovered a trove of the non-Gold Dot 200-grainers, but alas!

I keep the identical-looking boxes carefully separated.

Seven shots into the boiler room with 100 per cent total failure to
penetrate sufficiently is hardly what I would call "irrelevant".
Fellow hunters that I know also had similar experiences with the .
45acp's failure to penetrate with light weight bullets. Real life
testing far out weighs laboratory theory or shooting into wet
newspapers or plastic and clay concoctions.  Other tests in non living
material also proved how inferior the .45acp is even with military fmj
bullets making the round one of the worst combat rounds ever fielded
by any nation.   When the .45 bounces off of old style military
helmets at 25 yards while the 9x19 zipps through them at 125 yards
that should tell even "Joe Gun writer" that his .45acp myth is
somewhat tarnished to say the least.  Since you do not take my actual
field testing seriously I would suggest you read the more recent book
on the "Inglis High Power pistol" Or simply watch the History channel
which showed actual U.S. training films showing the miserable failure
of the .45 acp bouncing off of German helmets (they did not intend
this in the film) but were too stupid to edit it out.

I suggest you get some "blood on your hands" with actual field testing
and your arrogance will then be somewhat diminished.

As someone has already pointed out, the worse thing that can happen by
shooting a perp in winter-weight outdoorwear with a hollowpoint is a
HP that performs like ball.  But since not all winter shootings occur
outdoors...

For reasons of velocity, mechanical reliability, and sighting radius,
I'm not a fan of super-short barreled autos, especially if they're
chambered for the .45ACP and even more so if they're a M-1911.  I
carried a Combat Commander for years back when and thought that was an
ideal carry piece.  I think some version is/was made by more than 1
mfg that marries a 4.25" slide to an Officer's frame that could be
pretty interesting.  If I had an Officer's ACP, I'd trade it for one
of those.

I was trying to be polite when I said "irrelevant," Jerry. Withstanding your

have been 95% bullroar... unsupportable assertions, uninformed conjecture

Your one-time failure with Bambi has precious little relevance to what the

If I wrote that... and I just checked and discovered that I did!... it
should have been Federal Hydra-Shok. My embarrassment knows no bounds!

But while I still sing the praises of the Model 30, and it _does_ have a
shorter barrel than the five-inch .45 ACP standard established by Mr.
Browning, the O.P. was inquiring about one of the really shorty .45s...
which go all the way down to three-inches in a 1911-style pistol now-a-days.

Additionally, the Speer SBO line was not yet developed at that earlier
writing.

I was getting on to thank everybody for the information (and still
want to do that), but Dean's comment above is leading me to yet
another question:

The ballistics data I've seen look like a 230 grain hardball round
loses 100 to 150 fps when going to a 3.25-3.5 inch barrel (from the 5"
standard).  I figured that the .45 is "pre expanded" compared to a 9mm
and that even 700 fps would get the job done.  I do already have the
Officer's ACP clone (and I like it :-), but have not yet committed to
the PT-145.  I've  already got a decently concealable 9mm that I'm
pretty comfortable with.  I can buy 9mm practice ammo about as cheap
as I can load .45, etc. etc., etc.

Is a short barreled .45 a good idea, compared w/ a similar sized 9mm
for use as a personal defense weapon?   Again, cold climate, layers of
clothing to shoot through in the winter.  T-shirt weather in the
summer.

I know the rec.guns motto is "buy them all", and I'll be traveling to
the closest town w/ a real gunstore this weekend (a trip I only make a
couple of times a year).  I figured I needed to bring home a PT-145
(the one I was looking at locally is not the "pro" version, and I've
read of cracking problems with these earlier models.)

Although I am not a fan of phone book tests this test mirrored the
failure of the .45acp with light weight bullets on deer.  The .45
penetrated barely 2 inches of phone books with two different bullet
weights  ONE LOAD WAS THE HEAVY WEIGHT BULLET THE OTHER THE LIGHT
WEIGHT AND BOTH FAILED MISERABLEY.

Take a look at this.  (scroll down to the bottom and see the

According to the above our Unconventional Warfare forces must be way
off the mark to readopt the 45 as a personal weapon.  Gee, I wonder
what their reasoning is? Do you think actual combat experience might
have anything to do with it? (irony, free gratis.)

You must realize the .45 Myth just refuses to die.  When in combat the
first time a rifle or pistol cartridge fails then a great hue and cry
goes up for a new  "miracle cartridge" one that will incapacitate a
man no matter how badly the shot is placed.  Such a cartridge never
existed and probably never will.  Only proper shot placement and
adequate penetration are what matter in regards to incapacitation and
smaller calibers kill just as well as larger ones, something that the
"big bore boys" find unfathomable except of course if they have
actually hunted with such calibers.

Real life shooting tests in Mexcio in the 1980's by Pistolero magazine
proved that WHEN SHOOTING PIGS EVEN AT POINT BLANK RANGE THE .45ACP
WAS A TOTYAL MYTH AS THE SMALLER CALIBERS LIKE THE 9X19 WERE EVERY BIT
AS LETHAL.

The .45 is perhaps one of the worst combat rounds ever fielded.  Now I
know this sounds like "pure heresy" or the ranting of a lunatic but
lets take a look at what can happen to one in combat.  Although the
average "armchair commando" thinks that enemy soldiers simply stand
around in picture like poses waiting for you to gun them down at point
blank range but nothing could be further from the truth.  In combat
people move very quickly and take cover behind all manner of objects.
Couple this with the fact that many often open fire a ranges far
greater than point blank pistol ranges.  All this makes the .45 acp
one of the poorest choices for combat.  Its lack of penetration
because its slow velocity coupled with its larger frontal area simply
are a prescription for disaster.  Lets face it shooting at someone
over 25 yards away is not something you want to do with the .45 or
shooting at someone that is behind a barrier either.  Here is where
such calibers like the 9x19 and .30 Tokerov excel.  With their much
higher velocity and flatter trajectory their penetration far exceeds
that of the .45acp.  A person shooting at you from say 100 yards away
can in most cases almost laugh at someone shooting at them with the .
45acp but when he is shot at with the 9x19 or .30 Tokerov he is in
very mortal danger because of the higher velocity and penetration of
the 9x91 and 30 Tokerov.  I might add that the new FN 5.8 pistol with
its 2,000 plus fps velocity is extremely deadly at such longer ranges.

The other great myth is that the .45acp with its slightly greater
diameter is more lethal than the 9x19.  The actual diameter difference
is only .096 or rounded off 1/10 of an inch but somehow people think
that this 1/10 of an inch difference means that the person shot will
be blown of his feet , spun around like a top or even disappear in a
red puff off mist.  Laughable of course, but firmly believed by many
people who have been brainwashed by the gun magazines for almost 100
years.

One must realize also that the smaller calibers often have greater
magazine capacities and anyone that has been in real combat knows that
you cannot have a weapon that has too great a capacity.  Here again
the 9x19  has the advantage with its capacity that is  double that of
the capacity of the .45acp.  The ability to carry double the amount of
extra ammo with the 9x91 is also a plus simply because of the smaller
size and lighter weight of the 9x19 ammo.

When the smaller calibers fail a great shout of "See I Told You So" is
exclaimed but when the exact same thing happens with the larger round
"A MILLION EXCUSES" are made such as "HE WAS ONE TOUGH SOLDIER".  Ya ,
sure he was , but maybe a poor shot placement or not enough
penetration was the real culprit.

In sub-machine guns the 9x19 is the clear winner as it is more
controllable in full auto fire and its penetration and flatter
trajectory  out of  the longer barrel sub-gun is way better than that
of  the .45acp.  The worlds militaries long ago rejected the .45acp in
sub-guns as the inferior round.

I myself am not alone in witnessing the failure of the .45acp on live
animals as some of my fellow  hunters have experienced the exact same
thing.  Seeing is believing and blood and guts shooting is what really
proves what works and what does not.  When I shot the last deer it
actually ran towards me as I was concealed up in a tree.  EVEN WHEN
THE LAST COUPLE OF SHOTS WERE FIRED AT POINT BLANK RANGE THE .45ACP
DID NOT KNOCK DOWN THE PUNY 100 LB. DEER AND DID NOT SPIN HIM AROUND
OR MAKE HIM DISAPPER IN A RED PUFF OF MIST.  I FINALLY HAD TO ACTUALLY
CLIMB DOWN OUT OF THE TREE AND SHOOT HIM POINT BLANK IN THE HEAD WITH
THE .45ACP TO PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISEREY.  I HAVE NOT CARRIED A .45ACP
HANDGUN FOR SELF PROTECTION SINCE THAT DAY.
