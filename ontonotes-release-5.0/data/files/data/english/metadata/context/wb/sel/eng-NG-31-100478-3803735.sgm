Been tempted by one locally.

P plate, 14k miles, 1 owner and full history.

Up for £2k..... is it worth the risk, or should we have the 75 restored?

Has it had a cambelt change?

Sounds good value at that mileage for sure

Don't know the full details, still trying to decide if I should go and
have a look tomorrow.

What's putting me off is that it's 'over the bridge' so it'll cost me
nearly a fiver to get back in again ;-)

If it hasn't had a cambelt change yet I'd be terrified of driving it
home..... although I suppose that would be the dealer's problem to deal
with ;-)

Looks good on the delear website. Though I don't know what the wood trim is
on a 146?

I am sure with your negotation skills they would get it done if it hasn't
been.

I guess the only concern is Alfas of that era suddenly seem to go from a
good value £2k motor to be valued as worthless by the trade. I paid £1700
for my 33 when it was 8 years old and 2 years later the trade would not
touch it. Having said that at that mileage you could rack up some miles on
it and have great value and fun motoring. It is certainly well equipped too,
aircon, CD stacker and electric sunroof.

Cheers
Tony

Looks like aftermarket stick-on tat to me.

Heh. Suppose I could use the bike instead of the car.

I did think that, but it's not a cheap service to do.... £250 or so I
reckon, dependent on doing the water pump at the same time.

That's the thing, really. All those toys, stupidly low miles etc. Would
be ideal for the wife to use for her 30 miles / day to and from work -
should last her ages.

You're right about values, though, 'cos my 33 16v cost me £2k, a few
years later it was worthless.

&gt; garage than you...

&gt; Only kidding :)
