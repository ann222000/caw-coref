A reminder:  All right, what part of these threads being all noble
here didn't get through?

ANGEL
Season Two, Episode 20: &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot;
Writer: Mere Smith
Director: Fred Keller

Bleah.  I'm bitterer this time because I'm under no illusions that the
Pylea arc will be any good, and it's certainly not.  I don't know
whether to complain about how freaking long it takes to get there,
given that my eyes glaze over when we do look at their boring
society.  OTR does pick up a bit of a burst of energy once the rescue
mission finally gets moving, so those are the highlight of the
episode, such that it is.  One thing that is of note: this is the
first time that we see an adventure with the team of Angel, Wes, Gunn,
and Lorne.  Of the characters who are on the show at this point,
they're the ones who'll be in the final party when they fight the last
boss, so we should focus on getting them all up to Level 60 or so
before then.

For some reason, this episode was chosen to get a commentary track,
and it's predictably devoid of juicy backstage information.  It's
actually an okay track from a directing/set design standpoint, but no
one should be allowed to use the term &quot;lady-love&quot; and go unpunished.
Rating: Weak (down from Decent)

Season Two, Episode 21: &quot;Through The Looking Glass&quot;
Writer: Tim Minear
Director: Tim Minear

I'd remembered this as the strongest of this arc.  Not feeling it at
all this time.  Very stong &quot;why am I watching this show again?&quot;
feelings during, say, the by-the-numbers running around the castle
scenes: gee, never would've guessed that Cordelia would be discovered
before escaping and have to &quot;comedically&quot; try to lie her way out of
it.  In a broader sense, long story short, I want to watch _Angel_,
and find it impossible to summon up much interest for this Xena-lite
world full of one-note characters in silly costumes.  &quot;Through The
Looking Glass&quot; isn't totally worthless; it has the Dance Of Joy, one
of the most elaborate online-fan in-jokes I've seen, the first real
Fred moments of the series, the mention of W&amp;H going inter-
dimensional, and Angel getting caught up in heroics.  Even there,
though, one of the funniest jokes wasn't in the episode, it was in
watching the lengths people on the NG would go to try to paint Angel's
transformation into a Vantaul as a powerful character-defining
moment.  Actually, what happens is that Angel turns into one monster
instead of another, which leads him to scowl a lot and
melodramatically intone that &quot;I can never go back.&quot;  Yeah, in my
world, TTLG holds nothing of real interest.
Rating: Weak (down from Decent)

Season Two, Episode 22: &quot;&quot;There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb&quot;&quot;
Writer: David Greenwalt
Director: David Greenwalt

And this one I'd remembered as perhaps the most lackluster of the
Pylea episodes.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The show seems to give
up on taking this story too seriously, letting the evil priests go
into all-out cartoon villainy, while letting Angel quickly get back to
playing with others during his usual kicking ass and moping about it
afterward.  And then David suggests some better things for the viewer
to take seriously.  Anything remotely interesting that happens with
Wesley in Pylea happens in this episode alone, as for better or for
worse he first *decides* to become his idea of a leader.  Meanwhile,
Cordelia's treatment of her mystical gift pretty much automatically
becomes more interesting simply by having seen where it'll take her
next season.  Fred, who was one of the better things about TTLG, is
great here, with her quirkiness sent into weird and funny overdrive by
having lived in a cave for five years.  I'm almost tempted to say
screw it and actually rank &quot;Plrtz Glrb&quot; Good.  In the end, there's too
much of the Wacky Queen Cordy sequences, Cordy/Groosalug stuff, and,
well, Pylea-ness for me to truly enjoy the show.  Still, not a bad
episode, plus *it gets us the hell out of Pylea*!
Rating: Decent

Additional comments on S2D6:  Thank the lords of Kobol that's over
with.

Season Two is currently my lowest rated season of either BTVS or ATS;
at 3.41, it's just barely behind BTVS S5, and well behind ATS S1 in
terms of pure numerical mean.  Quality percentage increases from 41%
to 50%, since I appreciate a few like &quot;Rahmon&quot; and &quot;Redefinition&quot; more
on second viewing.  It's interesting that I'm so generally down on the
year, since episodes 3-10 are among the show's finest hour(s).  The
level of momentum during the human-Darla period is amazing.  The 2001
episodes, however, have only two big (and remember, ATS is best when
it's big) &quot;main&quot; episodes that work for me, &quot;Redefinition&quot; and
&quot;Reprise.&quot;  &quot;Disharmony&quot; and &quot;Dead End&quot; are both also enjoyable
comedic turns, the latter being pretty significant story-wise too.
Everything else post-&quot;Reunion&quot; is mostly a big pile of meh for me.
That's a hell of a lot of meh in such concentration for a Buffyverse
season, especially one that so many people consider among the best.

I don't think I'd react this badly if it weren't for ending the year
in Pylea, plain and simple.  The Beige Angel period still had some of
that &quot;momentum&quot; thing, a variable which gets lost in by-the-numbers
ratings analysis.  But even if one has a higher tolerance for light
colorful demon adventure than I do, it remains a very un-ATS-like
diversion that's a real momentum-killer in terms of putting together
any kind of ongoing mega-arc.  This show never stays stagnant, which
also means it's liable to wander away from what looks like a promising
direction, and at this point in both watching and re-watching, it's
frustrating.  For the none of you who care about these updates, my
brother was starting to get very into _Angel_ at the end of S1, which
ends by finally finding its footing, and was almost completely
apathetic to the show by the end of S2.  I convinced him to hold out
for a little longer, though, and he did not regret it.

Oh, just as a heads-up, I may start staggering the ASL threads rather
than posting the BTVS and ATS ones within minutes of each other, to in
some strange way simulate the shows being on different networks.

What's...?

I was more specifically referring to whether anyone cares about the
reports about what my brother thought of things.  Of course, a lot of
what I've done is predicated on the premise that the opinions of new
viewers are inherently interesting...

AtS on holiday. They finished the serious business of S2 earlier than usual,
so their reward is an all expenses paid trip to Pylea. This initial episode
is damaged by how long it takes them to cancel the paper and get someone to
look after the cat, but at least there is Cordelia who has gone on ahead to
get accustomed to the culture of the place before the boys arrive. So it is
Good for me. It's my 28th favourite AtS episode, 10th best in season 2 (last
year was 25th  and 10th).

Three things lift TTLG above the other Pylea episodes - the Wolf, Ram, and
Hart, Angel getting in touch with his inner demon, and perhaps most
importantly, Fred getting a chance to show what she can do. I loved the
supressed bitternes when she hears that they made Cordy a princess - &quot;When I
got here they... They didn't do that.  -  Well.  That's nice for her.&quot;

Oh, and of course Numfor. Four things. Four things lift TTLG above the other
Pylea episodes...

It's an easy Good, and is my 14th favourite AtS episode, 6th best in season
2 (same as last year).

At least there is one point of agreement between us about the Pylea arc - I
also like this a little better on this viewing, probably mainly just by
happening to focus more on what I always thought was good about it. Best
part is still Gunn's &quot;plan&quot; - Gunn's &quot;plan&quot; - &quot;We die horribly and
painfully,you go to hell and I spend eternity in the arms of baby Jesus.&quot;
Which might explain Wes taking a greater leadership role.

So for me its a little more comfortably Good than it was last year. It's my
26th favourite AtS episode, 9th best in season 2.

Actually, Elizabeth Rohm got a better gig on Law and Order, so they had
to toss the planned season end, and scraped the Pylea arc off the bottom
of someone's shoe.
