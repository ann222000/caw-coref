There's a calculator at www.fast-math.org in which you can enter the
estimated mileage (or kilometerage) you drive per year, the mileage
your current car is getting, the mileage a proposed new car will get,
and it will show you how much money you can save. If you already have
a fuel-efficient car, you can have fun running as-ifs and after-the-
fact comparisons.
Take care,

My '04 Prius cost about $5,000 more than a comparable
non-hybrid, so I factored in the loss of income from
that money differential (we pay cash and keep cars until
they're not economical to fix). Also, there are
differences in maintenance. For example, my Prius may
never need a brake job...

And there's one more savings: time. In my driving
environment, I estimate that my HOV-lane access is worth
2.2 hours per month - and time is money. Those stickers
aren't available any longer, but mine are good till 2011
and I can guarantee that I'll keep this car at least
that long.

A great car!

I hope you figured out that 5k would have purchased ALL of the fuel one
would use in a Corolla for the first three of four years?  Have you also
added into you calculations the $4,000 cost of replacing the batteries at
some point?

Thank goodness for all of you people that are willing to by hybrids. Not
only are you saving the world you are saving gasoline so there will be
enough gasoline for those can afford to own and drive the bigger safer RWD
V8 sporty and luxury cars we love  LOL

Thinking further, the annual cost differential should
also include consideration of trade-in or sales value
when the time comes. I owned my early '04 for quite a
while before it depreciated even a dollar, and today,
after four years and a day, it can be sold for 80% of
what I paid for it in 10/03 (kbb.com).

In fact, since it has the desirable HOV stickers and is
in perfect condition, I might get more than that...
Astonishing!

Not only that, but since automakers have to meet a &quot;fleet
average&quot; MPG, all buying a hybrid does is allow some other
person to buy a bigger monster truck and eat up the savings.

You are right, there's a way to compute Carbon emission per kilometer

Planting more trees is a good idea and we're doing it in my
neighborhood. But there is a limit to how many trees we can fit

It looks like human activity is causing some global problems. That
isn't really very surprising to me. We've dumped lots of stuff that
never existed in nature back into nature. We've cut down most of the
rain forests. We've pumped all kinds of stuff into the atmosphere.
We've caused the extinction of countless species (yes, we could
probably count them but I'm using the term to mean &quot;a great many&quot;).

And when it's pointed out that perhaps we'd better do something to
protect the only planet we have and pass it on to future generations,
we get all kinds of gruff. Well, fine, maybe we're wrong and there is
no problem. Let's just continue what we're doing until it's too late.
Maybe science will come up with a fix. Or maybe we'll all get wiped
out or face a much more hostile environment.

Really, why should it bother me anyway? I'll be dead. I guess I'll buy
that hummer after all.

&gt;&gt; Planting more trees is a good idea and we're doing it in my
&gt;&gt; neighborhood. But there is a limit to how many trees we can fit

&gt;&gt;  It looks like human activity is causing some global problems. That
&gt;&gt; isn't really very surprising to me. We've dumped lots of stuff that
&gt;&gt; never existed in nature back into nature. We've cut down most of the
&gt;&gt; rain forests. We've pumped all kinds of stuff into the atmosphere.
&gt;&gt; We've caused the extinction of countless species (yes, we could
&gt;&gt; probably count them but I'm using the term to mean &quot;a great many&quot;).

&gt;&gt; And when it's pointed out that perhaps we'd better do something to
&gt;&gt; protect the only planet we have and pass it on to future generations,
&gt;&gt; we get all kinds of gruff. Well, fine, maybe we're wrong and there is
&gt;&gt; no problem. Let's just continue what we're doing until it's too late.
&gt;&gt; Maybe science will come up with a fix. Or maybe we'll all get wiped
&gt;&gt; out or face a much more hostile environment.

&gt;&gt; Really, why should it bother me anyway? I'll be dead. I guess I'll buy

We don't have much historic data on average temperatures on Mars and
Venus.  They are very different from Earth and from each other.  We
really don't know what kind of cycles are in play there.

I couldn't find any reference on Venus warming recently.  I only found
one reference on Mars warming referencing a paper in Nature which also
noted that the surface had gotten darker and speculating that some
kind of wind cycle churning up dust could be at play.

How do you know that?

BTW, Venus is the poster boy for greenhouse climate change.  Fifty
years ago it was assumed that the surface of Venus was like a swamp on
the equator of Earth.  We now know it is more like a furnace.  This is
the result of run-away global warming due to the high CO2 content of
its atmosphere.  By some models, Earth starts to run away if the
average global temperature hits 80F.

Actually, I can believe this, especially if the driver is driving for
economy and/or doing a lot of highway driving.  I can drive my GS-R in
heavy Chicago traffic hardly using the brakes by just anticipating
traffic and using engine compression to slow the car.  The regen
braking in a hybrid should work even better than compression braking.

It's actually a very simple calculation by just applying the mileage
ratio to your current gas costs. I've done it in Canadian units, but the
same idea could easily be modified for  the imperial gallon or the tiny
USA gallon.

For example I now spend $1,200 per year on gas, driving 1,000 kms per
month.
My car is 8L/100 highway and 12.5L/100 city.
I drive 80% city, so my effective consumption is  11.6.
If a new smaller more efficient car is  7/10.5L/100 it's effective
consumption for me is  9.8L/100.
Therefore my gas cost with the new car is 1,200*9.6/11.6=$993
for a saving of  $207 per year. A  17% saving, not a big deal for my low
mileage.
Tuning this figure up you could increase the saving to reflect the
expected increase in gas cost.

That's one of the favorite myths of the hybrid bashers.  After four
years the Prius gets excellent reliability ratings.   It's kinda nice

&gt;&gt;&gt;Planting more trees is a good idea and we're doing it in my
&gt;&gt;&gt;neighborhood. But there is a limit to how many trees we can fit

&gt;&gt;&gt; It looks like human activity is causing some global problems. That
&gt;&gt;&gt;isn't really very surprising to me. We've dumped lots of stuff that
&gt;&gt;&gt;never existed in nature back into nature. We've cut down most of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;rain forests. We've pumped all kinds of stuff into the atmosphere.
&gt;&gt;&gt;We've caused the extinction of countless species (yes, we could
&gt;&gt;&gt;probably count them but I'm using the term to mean &quot;a great many&quot;).

&gt;&gt;&gt;And when it's pointed out that perhaps we'd better do something to
&gt;&gt;&gt;protect the only planet we have and pass it on to future generations,
&gt;&gt;&gt;we get all kinds of gruff. Well, fine, maybe we're wrong and there is
&gt;&gt;&gt;no problem. Let's just continue what we're doing until it's too late.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe science will come up with a fix. Or maybe we'll all get wiped
&gt;&gt;&gt;out or face a much more hostile environment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Really, why should it bother me anyway? I'll be dead. I guess I'll buy
&gt;&gt;&gt;that hummer after all.

&gt;&gt;When it can be explained to me why adjacent planets are also warming up,
&gt;&gt;then I may admit that human contributions, (which by the way amount to
&gt;&gt;less than .5% of the increase in recent years), might be a factor.

&gt;&gt;The loss of carbon conversion can largely be attributed to the
&gt;&gt;destruction of the tropical and other rainforests and in that way, yes,
&gt;&gt;we are a factor and one that could easily be reversed.

&gt;&gt;But that does not 'plain the planetary warm up...

Is that similar to a RIPiglican urging others to go die in a war while

He was that White House paid &quot;reporter&quot; who asked Bush soft ball
questions by day, and fucked him in the ass at night by staying at the
White House.  At least Clinton liked girls.  This explains why Bush is
so &quot;unusual&quot;... he is a hostile homosexual....like all Republicans
getting busted in gay sex stings today.  Family values and Jesus.
Sure don't hear Republicans singing that song.  Bush can't even scare
anyone anymore even with talk of World War 3.  Stupid liar RIPigs.

Paul won't run as an independent.  If he were to run he would get few
votes nor would he be a threat to the Republican nominee.

Pulling out of Iraq at this point surely is not a move onto the right
