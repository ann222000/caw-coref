Gangs Terrorize Nigeria's Vital Oil Region
By LYDIA POLGREEN
New York Times, November 9, 2007

PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria - Rosemary Douglas has no connection to the
oil business that pumps more than two million barrels of crude a day
from beneath the swampy Niger Delta. But the violence surrounding it
pierced her home in September anyway, when a bullet shattered her
upper left arm as she napped with her 2-year-old daughter.

&quot;I don't know why this happened to me,&quot; she said, grimacing in pain
as she gave a bewildered account of the gunplay that has engulfed her
neighborhood and much of this oil-drenched city. &quot;I mind my own
business.&quot;

The violence that has rocked the Niger Delta in recent years has been
aimed largely at foreign oil companies, their expatriate workers and
the police officers and soldiers whose job it is to protect them.
Hundreds of kidnappings, pipeline bombings and attacks on flow
stations and army barracks have occurred in the past two years alone.

But these days the guns have turned inward, and open battles have
erupted with terrifying frequency on the pothole-riddled streets of
this ramshackle city. The origins of the violence are as murky and
convoluted as the mangrove swamps that snake across the delta, one of
the poorest places on earth. But they lie principally in the rivalry
among gangs, known locally as cults, that have ties to political
leaders who used them as private militias during state and federal
elections in April, according to human rights advocates, former gang
members and aid workers in the region.

&quot;What is happening now cannot be separated from politics,&quot; said
Anyakwee Nsirimovu of the Institute for Human Rights and Humanitarian
Law in Port Harcourt. &quot;The cults are part and parcel of our politics.
They have become part of the system, and we are paying in blood for
it.&quot;

The cults go by names that veer from the chilling to the improbable -
like the Black Axe, the Klansmen, the Icelanders, the Outlaws and the
Niger Delta Vigilante. Separate but not entirely distinct from the
militant groups that have attacked the oil industry in the past, they
represent a new, worrisome phase in a region that has been convulsed
by conflict since oil was discovered here in 1956.

Since democracy returned to Nigeria in 1999, politicians across the
country have used cults to intimidate opponents and rig votes. A
Human Rights Watch report published in October concluded that the
political system was so corroded by corruption and violence that, in
some places, it resembled more a criminal enterprise than a system of
government. The April elections were so brazenly rigged in some areas
and so badly marred by violence that international observers said the
results were not credible.

Nowhere is political violence more severe than here in the Niger
Delta, where control over state government means access to billions
of dollars in oil revenues and control of enough patronage for an
army.

According to former gang members and human rights workers, the
governing People's Democratic Party and some opposition parties
employed cult members in the delta during the election, as they had
in the two previous ones, which led to landslide victories for the
governing party.

One powerful gang leader, Soboma George, was given the lion's share
of patronage, they contend. Mr. George displayed his prowess in the
months before the election by having his foot soldiers break him out
of a city jail in a brazen assault. He then demonstrated his impunity
by driving through the streets of Port Harcourt, the capital of
Rivers State, in flashy cars, seemingly fearless of arrest.

The other gangs resented Mr. George's growing influence and control
over lucrative security contracts, and a war between them has turned
increasingly bloody. Caught in the middle have been all kinds of
civilians; no one is off limits to the violence.

The elderly mother of the newly elected state governor was kidnapped
and held for ransom in the spring. Toddlers related to senior
government officials and business leaders have been seized to extract
ransom payments or settle political disputes.

The violence reached such a pitch that at Teme Hospital here,
surgeons from the aid group Doctors Without Borders struggled to keep
up with a flood of 71 gunshot victims in just two weeks in August,
and more than a month later they were still treating many people
recovering from shattered bones and flesh wounds from the fighting.

Ibinabo Bob-Manuel, a 25-year-old college student, said she was at
home with her aunt and 6-year-old sister, Lolo, on Aug. 16 when
shooting broke out between soldiers and a gang that had occupied the
area.

Four bullets pierced the fleshy part of her thigh, and one remained
lodged inside. She lost so much blood that she passed out. The top
half of a toe was blown off. Her sister was shot through her hands as
she pressed her palms in prayer in the hail of bullets, Ms.
Bob-Manuel said.

&quot;We were bleeding and crying,&quot; she said. &quot;My auntie shouted, 'You
killed my family!' I thought I would die.&quot;

The government says it is cracking down on gangs, and it has sent an
elite army unit into Port Harcourt and the surrounding areas to
impose law and halt the violence. The gunplay in the city streets has
since died down, but it is a tense, uneasy calm.

Many residents worry that rivalries may soon heat up again. On Oct.
25 a judicial panel removed the new governor of Rivers State,
Celestine Omehia, ruling that he had not been an eligible candidate
because he did not win his party's primary. The winner of the
primary, Rotimi Amaechi, was sworn in as governor, and many worry
that violent clashes will ensue between their supporters.

The bloodshed has reached beyond the cities, deep into the creekside
communities of the delta. In Ogbogoro the fights between rival gangs
were so intense in August that the council of traditional rulers felt
compelled to act. Two cults, the Debam and the Dewell, were fighting
over political turf, oil and contracts for security work with oil
services companies, according to local officials.

&quot;No one could sleep in the town,&quot; said Chief Clement Chuku, one of
the traditional rulers of Ogbogoro. &quot;Bullets were flying all night.&quot;

The chiefs met to announce an ultimatum: all cult members had to
leave or risk being arrested by vigilante youths from the community.
The vigilantes rounded up a few members as examples, Mr. Chuku said,
and were planning to turn them over to the military.

But just as a community meeting got under way in the town hall in
early September, dozens of young men on motorbikes, carrying machine
guns and grenade launchers, overran the meeting. Two traditional
rulers were shot dead and their bodies were dumped on a weedy
riverbank.

George Ogan, a retired doctor and church leader who has been trying
to stem gang violence farther down the delta in his hometown, Okrika,
where some of the most fearsome cults are based, said that such
violence was completely bound up with politics.

&quot;Our politicians cannot stand on their own, so they find those who
will stand with guns for them,&quot; Dr. Ogan said.
