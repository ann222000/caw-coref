Thank you.   Tommy's idea is sounding better especially because I
have some 20-something guage stainless steel sheet in 5" X 48" strips
(going to bend it into aquarium light reflectors) and Carolina's
minimum order on the Pyrex tubing is 1 lb for $13.30, which is about
10 to 20 times as much as I need.  I have 21 strips of stainless and
do not need twenty-one 48" reflectors.  :-)   Although it is probably
good to have some spares, as I imagine I'll screw up the bending on
the first few.

However, I really liked the elegance and convenience of just using
the heavy pyrex tubing as the coupling between the PVC airline and
the air diffuser.   Decisions, decisions...

If I was ready to culture daphnia or wingless fruit flies, it would
be an easier decision, because I would do a CBS order for the
cultures and equipment and just tack on the tubing.
