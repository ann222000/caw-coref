What are you using for calorie data for your food?  It seems like
you'd have to eat an awful lot of steamed shrimp and boiled veggies to
get up to 500 calories!  If you're going to count calories, you should
do more than guess.  Check out www.calorieking.com -- an easy way to
look up food calories.

oh ok thanks!    I didn't know there was such a thing.  I'll start
using that.
