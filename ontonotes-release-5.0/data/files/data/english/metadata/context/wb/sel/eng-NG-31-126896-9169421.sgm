*September 14, 2007, Friday*

*Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross*

*Praise The Lord!!**

**

Start with four steps*

1. Come as you are right now to the Lord.  Tell him all your feelings,( be
it joy, anger, hate, jealousy, feelings of insecurity,ego, etc ) -
everything -    from the core of your heart.
2. Hand over to the  Lord  the blockages that hinder your path to his Holy
anointing - things you want to change but have no power to change.
3. Surrender your life to the Lord - not by mere words, but from the depths
of your soul - give Him the complete control of your life.
4.  Wait in  silent communion with the Lord in that state of surrender and
the Lord will speak to you and  you will be filled with the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;
*John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he {God} is faithful and just to forgive
us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness*

*Reading 1*
*Numbers 21:4b-9* &lt; http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/numbers/numbers21.htm#v4 &gt;

With their patience worn out by the journey,
the people complained against God and Moses,
&quot;Why have you brought us up from Egypt to die in this desert,
where there is no food or water?
We are disgusted with this wretched food!&quot;

In punishment the LORD sent among the people saraph serpents,
which bit the people so that many of them died.
Then the people came to Moses and said,
&quot;We have sinned in complaining against the LORD and you.
Pray the LORD to take the serpents from us.&quot;
So Moses prayed for the people, and the LORD said to Moses,
&quot;Make a saraph and mount it on a pole,
and if any who have been bitten look at it, they will live.&quot;
Moses accordingly made a bronze serpent and mounted it on a pole,
and whenever anyone who had been bitten by a serpent
looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.

*Responsorial Psalm*
*Ps 78:1bc-2, 34-35, 36-37,
38*&lt; http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/psalms/psalm78.htm#v1 &gt;

R. (see 7b) Do not forget the works of the Lord!
Hearken, my people, to my teaching;
incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable,
I will utter mysteries from of old.
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!
While he slew them they sought him
and inquired after God again,
Remembering that God was their rock
and the Most High God, their redeemer.
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!
But they flattered him with their mouths
and lied to him with their tongues,
Though their hearts were not steadfast toward him,
nor were they faithful to his covenant.
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!
But he, being merciful, forgave their sin
and destroyed them not;
Often he turned back his anger
and let none of his wrath be roused.
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!

*Reading II*
*Philippinas 2:6-11*&lt; http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/philippians/philippians2.htm#v6 &gt;

Brothers and sisters:
Christ Jesus, though he was in the form of God,
did not regard equality with God something to be grasped.
Rather, he emptied himself,
taking the form of a slave,
coming in human likeness;
and found human in appearance,
he humbled himself,
becoming obedient to death,
even death on a cross.
Because of this, God greatly exalted him
and bestowed on him the name
that is above every name,
that at the name of Jesus
every knee should bend,
of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
and every tongue confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.

*Gospel*
*John 3:13-17* &lt; http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/john/john3.htm#v13 &gt;

Jesus said to Nicodemus:
&quot;No one has gone up to heaven
except the one who has come down from heaven, the Son of Man.
And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert,
so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.&quot;

For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son,
so that everyone who believes in him might not perish
but might have eternal life.
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world,
but that the world might be saved through him.

*2 Peter 1: 16 - 19*

16 For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to
you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were
eyewitnesses of his majesty. 17 For when he received honor and glory
from God the Father and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic
Glory, &quot;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,&quot; 18 we
heard this voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy
mountain. 19 And we have the prophetic word made more sure. You will
do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place,
until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.

*Happy Birthday &amp; Happy Anniversery for those who are celebrating.*

*Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord be
with You*
