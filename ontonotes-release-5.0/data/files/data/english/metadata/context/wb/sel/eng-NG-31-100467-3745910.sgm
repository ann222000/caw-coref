I am doing a bit of research on this.
Any astrologers oriented to health concerns; I would appreciate
comments on astrological connections to this disease and astrological
significators seen as correalated to it.
Thanks in advance:-)

Edmond,

Here is a good verbal description, IMO:

http://www.blonnet.com/life/2003/12/29/stories/2003122900090200.htm

Here is an animation that an artist and I created for a medical
publisher to describe how diabetes works on the cellular level as
described in the URL above.

http://gxs.home.texas.net/work_samples/animations/2_diabetes/diabetes...

According to Dr. H.L. Cornell of Encyclopedai of Medical Astrology it
is a Libra disease with afflictions in Libra, Aries or Scorpio.  Sun,
Jupiter, Mars or Venus afflicted in Libra  -- primarily a Venus and
Jupiter affliction like Venus or Jupiter in the 6th house and
afflicted. Also Mars in Libra afflicting the hyleg and other ill
aspects of Mars and Venus.

Amazingly, I do not think I have one chart in my large collection of a
diabetic person (as far as I know).

Your 10 miles on the treadmill should help alot if you are having
insulin issues -- also weight loss can make a big difference.

A lot of diabetes can be prevented with diet and exercise. I had a
touch of it when I was obese and pregnant -- called gestational
diabetes -- it went away when I lost the weight because my pancreas
could then supply the insulin needs of my body properly -- instead of
battling to keep up with the needs of an obese body.

The nutritionist put me on a high carb (rice, potatoes, pasta) low fat
and high fiber diet to control it while I was pregnant with my son.
Check with your physician.

All the Best -- LL

Interesting.  A close friend of mine has been told he is pre-diabetic
even though he is only in his early 30s, and he has Sun opp Jupiter

My Dutch book, (trans.) ' Astrology and Healing' by  Dr. J.C. van Wageningen
(reprint 1976), in reference to diseases of the endocrine glands:
Diabetes mellitus  - can be considered as a typical Libra illness, with
sometimes a diagnostic influence from the opposing Aries.
Kidneys -Filtration and excretion organ is ruled by Libra. Emphasis on
adrenals and adrenaline production (Mars?)

Mercury and Virgo, rulership over the pancreas, could be seen as
representing an organic disorder in 83% of cases.

Diabetes  as a result of metabolism difficulties shows influence of an
afflicted Venus (Chris: as ruler of Taurus?).
Jupiter was seen to play a role in carbohydrate but not in glucose problems.

Horoscopes of diabetics showed a weak Sun in most cases with a larger than
average affliction from Neptune.
Psychosomatic aspects can  provide the 'cause' of  developed illness.

With Jupiter currently transiting Libra, perhaps there is a connecting
factor in the chart you are studying as well as the Venus factor?

My husband has an unafflicted Jupiter, yet  his sugar count is too high as a
result of a malfunctioning thyroid gland.(Venus/Taurus). His Venus in
Scorpio is 45* (health aspect) his Sun in Sagittarius.

If you're interested,
www.rosicrucian.com/adh/adheng01.htm

will also bring you to a section on the astro. factors found in diabetes,
from which Dr. van Wageningen made a further study..

Christine.

I'm sitting here, with Jupiter and Saturn and Venus in Capricorn all in
my first house (though JU is not conj SA/VE), and wondering if I should
worry. :-)

The metaphysical cause/symbolism of diabetes is "lack of joy". My mother
has a close JU/SA conj in Taurus, and VE in Sag in 1st house. She was
diagnosed with hypthyroid over 10 years ago, got that under control, but
this past year discovered that now her blood sugar was no longer in
control, so has to watch that, too. The metaphysical cause/symbolism of
thyroid problems is "I never got my due". In all my reading about
hormone systems, it looks to me like if one hormone system starts to go
out of whack, it tends to bring in other systems. High cholesterol seems
to be present with thyroid problems, for example.

There is much about my mother, whose SU/ME conjunction falls right on my
VE and so also conj my SA, that I constantly learn from, as in I try not
to do what she does/think like her.

My goal in life is to not become a resentful, bitter old woman. I want
to look back on my life and have a big grin come to my face.

All interesting comments here!

According to Harrison's "Principles of Internal Medicine", which my
studio did all the drawings for the 14th Edition -- aka Fauci's, there
are two types of Primary:

1. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM, type 1)

2. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM, type 2)
a. Non-obese NIDDM (type 1 IDDM in evolution?)
b. Obese NIDDM
c. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young

Secondary:
1. Pancreatic disease
2. Hormonal abnormalities
3. Drug or chemical induced
4. Insulin receptor abnormalities
5. Genetic syndromes
6. Other

So there are multiple causes of diabetes as far as the medical
community is concerned. Also a genetic susceptibility is likely with
diabetes as with many other disease states.

So prevention of obesity (possibly by measuring BMI) and exercise can
only modify some types of diabetes while some types would not be
affected in this regard.

Due to this, I would suspect finding a simple aspect or afflicted
aspect in sign might be difficult to pin down and prove and would
require the differentiating of the cause to be able to pinpoint the
planets and aspects.

Preventing obesity and proper exercise cannot hurt in regards to
diabetes unless instructed otherwise by a doctor.

Interestingly, after I typed this my long time friend in Florida just
called and said that she had just been diagnosed with Obese NIDDM at 63
years old this spring.

In October T. Jupiter conjuncted her Mars in Libra. It is sitting less
than a degree away now. Her blood sugar was 425 in March when T. Saturn
conjuncted her Jupiter on March 22 on a STATION. This is when the
doctor found it so high and became alarmed.

She has Gemini ruling the 6th house and Mercury is 24 Libra on the MC
and will be hit by Jupiter then.

The doctor said she could have died if she had not gotten one of those
pharmacy blood battery of tests and the blood sugar was way high and
come to the doctor.

When T. Jupiter conjuncted the Mercury in Libra she could have died
with Gemini the ruler of the 6th house on September 29, 2005. T. Pluto
in Sag (blood) was quincunx Jupiter in Cancer at 21 (square natal
Mercury ruler of the 6th in Libra).  T. Jupiter would be squaring
Jupiter in Cancer with Moon in Pisces disposing Jupiter again -- too
much, too much.  Jupiter is always blood and Venus is sugar. So Jupiter
in Libra (Venus ruled) is too much sugar in the blood. Duh... lol

I do not think the astrological examples like I gave indicate so much
the vastly different causes of diabetes but the indication of high
levels of sugar in the blood and that is what Dr. H.L. Cornell
described to a T (meaning transit of course). LOL

The only major progressions I could find was P. Moon in Gemini conjunct
Saturn in Gemini -- and  P. Asc quincunx Chiron when diagnosed. And
Jupiter trine Asc. in January before the blood sugar level was
detected. Progressed Jupiter is Ret at 25 Cancer exactly Square Mercury
in Libra at 24. So it is applying to Square the ruler of her 6th in
Libra.

Also her Progressed Venus (sugar) in Sag (blood)  is opposed Uranus in
Gemini (ruler of her 6th house). Unexpected off the charts sugar
reading that alarmed her doctor because he did not detect it 6 months
prior in her stats.

T. Saturn at 22N01 is right on // her natal Jup at 21N47 and natal
Saturn at 20N26, Saturn now at 21N, so the Saturn to Jupiter affliction
works here also with the Dek of Saturn passing right over her Jupiter
Dek as well as the longitudinal conjunction as she is diagnosed with
the problem.

She is now on a strict diet and is starting an exercise program. I was
there in Spring of 2004 at that Naples financial astrology conference.
I was concerned about her obesity then. I tried to get her and her
husband into a national gym membership that I have here, but until this
happened -- only her husband was interested because they say what a
change I had made in my body.

She has already dropped 40 pounds since March eating a lot of tilapia
and no potatoes, carrots, green beans or beets -- too much sugar in
them. She thinks her Mercury levels are now too high however from all
the fish.

Wonder what shows up as Mercury poisoning in astrology? :I

Because T. Jupiter had already been on N. Mars and Saturn prior to this
spring, she had already started to observe fuzzy feeling feet and
shooting pains in her legs -- peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes.

Isn' t this so interesting? I had not been keeping up with her chart
and except for this group I would not have not even thought about
anything like this with the text book perfect examples of diabetes
mellitus (Obese NIDDM). When we spoke last evening and told me of her
diagnosis, I wanted to check her chart out based on what had been
discussed here and Voila!!

Jupiter and Venus issues with connections to Libra (indicating too much
sugar in the blood) and Jupiter (blood) with Saturn (problem) --  a
preponderance of indications in her case and all matching up to what
people researched and found here. Great job people!

Best to All -- LL

Hi Jim,
This would seem very logical because it would possibly also coincide with
the medical diagnosis that the illness has manifested (Saturn), impairing

Jupiter expands through excess,

Louise Hay's books "You Can Heal Your Body" or "You Can Heal Your Life"
give lists of these things. She has a listing for gallbladder stones
(which cause attacks): basically a solidifying of bitter or proud
thoughts. The affirmations she gives often provide further insight.
Gallbladder stones are also an absence of joy.

It's almost fascinating how common the theme is with these problems of
digestion and metabolism, i.e. a belief in joylessness due to life's
(perceived) injustices.

I've always tried to figure out what a conjunction of JU/SA actually
means in a person's personal philosophy. Apparantly, one expression is
to see Saturn as limitation or struggle with Jupiter magnifying, not
mitigating that belief. (It's not a belief I have, so I'm thinking this
is a feature of an exact aspect between SA and JU.)

&gt; Okay, you used &quot;rage,&quot; &quot;get rid of, &quot; and  &quot;injustice&quot; in the same

&gt; what's going on with your natal Pluto? (Transiting too.)

Nothing, except a possible midpoint between Sun and Ascendant. Pluto
squares my Sun natally but during its transit to my Sun, I felt on top
of the world. I may be the only Sag posting to aamod who didn't feel
like a ton of bricks hit me at that time. Quite the contrary: I felt
GOOD.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'd look myself,
&gt; but I don't have your chart. You might want to tell your Mom--and yourself--

Y'know, when I first read this, I thought, "Oh, I know all this already"
and got very irritated. Then it hit me: I had been asking for guidance
and you replied, and yes, I _did_ need a reminder that I am strong
enough to survive, to get through whatever. I keep forgetting I'm
strong. Like you, I'm very fond of my Saturn in Capricorn. In an angular
house, it is like the brick home of the three little pigs: Will
withstand any wolf. :-)

What's shaken right now is my _faith_. My faith that there is a good
reason for everything, that there is purpose, and that none of this
(childhood, transits, last night's less than successful meal) has been
an exercise in futility. I really don't like having my faith shaken.
It's not like me to not have my usual Sagittarian belief that everything
will turn out all right.

So back to the question of what's going on in my chart: TSat has left
the hot spots of my Capricorn/Cancer placements. Currently, Jupiter is
triggering said Cap/Can. First it squared nJup. Now it'll square
nSat/Mars by triggering the T-square those two have with my MC. I
usually don't notice Jupiter transits, but this faith issue sounds like
one. The retrograde is making me rethink some things (never a bad idea,
anyway) and in general, my focus has been on the spiritual (especially
affirmations) ever since Jupiter entered Libra (starting in my 9th
house).

It's possible that tUranus smack on my South Node in 3rd house is doing
a number on me right now, squaring my Sun, though it has just past the
exact opposition to my nPluto. I have to laugh: I've been buying
anti-procrastination books lately. Isn't that a Pisces-Virgo theme? :-)

My natal Jupiter trines my natal Pluto, BTW, and nPluto conjuncts North
Node (yep, Sun squares nodes).

My data are: Dec 3 1960, 8:07am PST, Long Beach, CA.

At any rate: Thank you for the reminders, Heather!

Hi,
I suffered the agonies of gall stones and the removal of the gall
bladder, and still got a second dose, so was particularly interested in
health astrology to discover the 'reason' behind the affliction. I never got
a third dose:-)

The gall is ruled by Mars. I don't know if you have ever heard of the
phrase, " Having (or not having) the gall to do something."
Mars is the ability to take action and show one's assertivity. If one does
not possess * the gall* to take 'action' of some kind, Mars' function has
no outlet, so works inwards affecting the body.
Gall is bitter and enters the gall passage, which is ruled by
Virgo. Unexpressed grievances can turn bitter and seem to play a part in
hardening the gall.  If Saturn or a planet in Capricorn makes a harsh
aspect to Mars, there can be a predisposition (which doesn't
necessarily mean it will materialise) of turning the gall into stone if the
planetary functions concerned are not utilised (Virgo). Not being
strong enough or able to accept some kind of hardship or harsh reality which
is
difficult to 'digest' and come to terms with, can produce a physical
complaint.

My own problems occured under a Sec. Prog.Saturn  through Cancer cojoining
my natal Mars, with transiting Mars squaring it which instigated the initial
attack.  Painful knives in the back between the shoulder blades. The
physical pain was psychosomatic of the emotional pain never acted upon and
dealt with.

The gall bladder is ruled by Jupiter. Jupiter deals with social
advancement and opportunity, the fulfilment of ideals, goals, happiness and
joy. If, for any reason, Jupiter's function cannot find an outlet, whereby
fulfilment is not found or experienced, it also can work inwards to affect
the body.

IMHO, such attacks would therefore show a signature of Mars-Jupiter-Saturn
and a strong Virgo influence, with an eventual involvement from the Moon as
unexpressed emotions.

&gt; faith, that I call the 12th.

Hi Keera,
Might I add 1/2 cent's worth to all the encouraging words H has said ?

I have Jupiter in the 12th house in Leo square my 9th house Sun, which might
contain a resemblance to your 12th house Sun position.

I was wondering if it's finding something 'to believe in' that is the
exercise for  Sagittarius in general, and seeking/finding 'faith' in one's
self is a 12th house event. I can imagine that a 12th house Sag. Sun might
then trot or gallop all over the globe (physically or mentally speaking) in
search of  'physical' evidence and proof that its belief is justified (Virgo
influence?). Too often we tend to believe in that which lies outside
ourself. We rely on other people's actions, views and philosophies to lead
or guide us and, by doing so, end up extremely disappointed when they are
unable to provide that 'something' we are seeking that gives us happiness
and inner peace.
I eventually reached the stage when I started listening to the guide within
myself. Always having had difficulty with the idea of 'a superior force',
believing in myself became a necessity for survival :-).

Imho, the 12th house Sun has to go the step further. Belief is not enough;
it must seek and find faith in itself without any help from anyone. It must
go beyond that which keeps it tied to the realm of substance from which its
beliefs are formed.  I should imagine that it can feel like a long,  lonely,
endless path at times, but it's the only one there is.

It truly wasn't my intention to bring BML into this. But from the birth date
you provided, I see its position is in Cancer, opposing Venus . Tr. Saturn
is now conjunct.
Maybe "Keera" has not yet reached her potential to feel complete and happy
because there are memories a small child within her holds about feeling
unloved, that she has
neglected to allow in her existence to be dealt with because they are so
very painful. But surface they must if joy in life is to be found. She
should take that little girl back into her and comfort her through the eyes
of an adult who has gained experience and wisdom from life, and can reason
things out in the way a child has not learnt to do . Tr. Saturn will help
provide the
reality as it was, so that the ghost of the past can finally be laid to
rest.

With tr. Uranus activating the Sun-Pluto square, all that is needed is a
change of attitude for  'Keera' to be released.
We cannot change the past but we *can* change how we view it. That's the
enlightenment that Uranus brings. Imho.

Best regards,
Christine.

&gt; &gt; &gt; word.  No LOL it's what enrages most plutonians--INJUSTICE)  Humor me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; what's going on with your natal Pluto? (Transiting too.)

&gt; &gt; Nothing, except a possible midpoint between Sun and Ascendant. Pluto
&gt; &gt; squares my Sun natally but during its transit to my Sun, I felt on top
&gt; &gt; of the world. I may be the only Sag posting to aamod who didn't feel
&gt; &gt; like a ton of bricks hit me at that time. Quite the contrary: I felt
&gt; &gt; GOOD.

&gt; Your SU-PL square is what I was after.  When I read your word-choice: &quot;rage,
&gt; get rid of, injustice,&quot; I said to myself Keera has got to be a Plutonian.
&gt; The odds of someone using all of those words in the same breath and not
&gt; being a Plutonian, are about one in a million.

Heh. Yeah, that square is pretty dominant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Y'know, when I first read this, I thought, &quot;Oh, I know all this already&quot;

&gt; &gt; enough to survive, to get through whatever. I keep forgetting I'm
&gt; &gt; strong. Like you, I'm very fond of my Saturn in Capricorn. In an angular
&gt; &gt; house, it is like the brick home of the three little pigs: Will

&gt; I'll confess , my natal Saturn has really been tested with Tr. Saturn in

Even when the wolf tried to come down by the chimney, the pigs could
protect themselves. I think that's part of Saturn's (and Pluto's) gift:
Knowing that you _are_ able to take control, to empower yourself. It's
an energy that may take some time growing into, though. Which is all
right.

Yeah, well, see why it bugs me to lose faith? 'Taint natchrel. Jupiter

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; So back to the question of what's going on in my chart: TSat has left
&gt; &gt; the hot spots of my Capricorn/Cancer placements. Currently, Jupiter is
&gt; &gt; triggering said Cap/Can. First it squared nJup. Now it'll square
&gt; &gt; nSat/Mars by triggering the T-square those two have with my MC. I
&gt; &gt; usually don't notice Jupiter transits, but this faith issue sounds like
&gt; &gt; one. The retrograde is making me rethink some things (never a bad idea,
&gt; &gt; anyway) and in general, my focus has been on the spiritual (especially
&gt; &gt; affirmations) ever since Jupiter entered Libra (starting in my 9th
&gt; &gt; house).

&gt; &gt; It's possible that tUranus smack on my South Node in 3rd house is doing
&gt; &gt; a number on me right now, squaring my Sun, though it has just past the
&gt; &gt; exact opposition to my nPluto. I have to laugh: I've been buying
&gt; &gt; anti-procrastination books lately. Isn't that a Pisces-Virgo theme? :-)

&gt; I have TR. Uranus opposing my Sun and Pluto. (8 Virgo) I call the transit,
&gt; &quot;waking up the dead.&quot; You've got the square going on, but the same 3 planets
&gt; are involved, SU-PL-UR. That's a major awakening in your life. Something may
&gt; have to be let go of, but whether you realize it or not, it is the act of
&gt; letting go--the break off or ending-- that will set you free.
">

I can feel this. I guess I just haven't identified exactly what, though
it usually revolves around the same theme: my mother, my roots.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I already had one of mine. Life and death--yup--but an awakening within me
&gt; that there are no words for. To me, the people ripe enough to write, are
&gt; those who have been through the cuisinart of life.And through their
&gt; against-all-odds experiences, they can reach out and touch a global
&gt; community.

&gt; Do something spectacular with your life Keera--the time is now! If I feel it
&gt; on this Uranus transit, surely you do. Break free!
">

Ah, the ever-returning dilemma: What to be when I grow up? Well, nothing
like a transit to purge a few closets - literally and figuratively.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As far as the procrastination thing goes, no-- it's not Virgo/Pisces, Libra
&gt; can procrastinate. Jupiter in Libra would exaggerate the tendency. Sounds
&gt; like you're a bookworm like me. I go to the bookstore ,  smoosh down in a
&gt; comfortable chair and read for hours, several times a week. One of my
&gt; favorite books is, 'The Power of The Subconscious Mind.' by Joseph Murphy,
&gt; Ph.D.  Now that would be great for you, because it also has to do with faith
&gt; and spirituality. The book really rocked my world in a great way.

I had that and gave it away to someone who needed it more. I have his
Great Affirmation on my affirmation web page. My current favorite
metaphysical author is Emmet Fox. I was a member of Church of Religious
Science when I lived in California and subscribe to a monthly magazine
of theirs. (Some of the affirmations this month really hit home as far
as our current discussion is concerned.) So, yeah, when my mind starts
to bring me down, I have to remember I have the tools to change my
thinking and bring myself peace.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; My natal Jupiter trines my natal Pluto, BTW, and nPluto conjuncts North

&gt; Well hey, I like that JU-PL trine for sure. Yikes to the latter, because it

&gt; &gt; &gt;My faith that there is a good

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's not like me to not have my usual Sagittarian belief that everything

&gt; Hi Keera,
&gt; Might I add 1/2 cent's worth to all the encouraging words H has said ?

&gt; I have Jupiter in the 12th house in Leo square my 9th house Sun, which might
&gt; contain a resemblance to your 12th house Sun position.

&gt; I was wondering if it's finding something 'to believe in' that is the
&gt; exercise for  Sagittarius in general, and seeking/finding 'faith' in one's
&gt; self is a 12th house event.
">

I wouldn't know. Most Sagdes I've met have been atheists. Or so they
said.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I can imagine that a 12th house Sag. Sun might
&gt; then trot or gallop all over the globe (physically or mentally speaking) in

Nope. Never felt the need. I have my proof right in my living room or
wherever I am when my prayer is answered.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Too often we tend to believe in that which lies outside

&gt; and inner peace.
">

Well, having been bullied for 6 years taught me that other people were
full of shit. Since I also never had any family religion to buck, I was
free to believe what I wanted. My spiritual search came from wanting
something to believe in but never understanding the Christian faith
(Norway's state religion is Lutheran Evangelical). I then discovered the
truth of there being many rooms in the house of Jesus' dad, and moved
into a different one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I eventually reached the stage when I started listening to the guide within
&gt; myself. Always having had difficulty with the idea of 'a superior force',
&gt; believing in myself became a necessity for survival :-).
">

Whereas I went the other route, looking for a god I could accept because
I felt that god would accept me. No longer a sinner, though still a
human who makes mistakes. I prefer that distinction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Imho, the 12th house Sun has to go the step further. Belief is not enough;
&gt; it must seek and find faith in itself without any help from anyone. It must
&gt; go beyond that which keeps it tied to the realm of substance from which its
&gt; beliefs are formed.  I should imagine that it can feel like a long,  lonely,
&gt; endless path at times, but it's the only one there is.
">

Well, I'm alone with my faith, simply because the church that represents
it doesn't exist in Norway. Doesn't matter, though. I don't feel lonely
when I'm connected with my god, that's for sure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It truly wasn't my intention to bring BML into this. But from the birth date
&gt; you provided, I see its position is in Cancer, opposing Venus . Tr. Saturn
&gt; is now conjunct.
">

Squares my mother's BML, I think. Or my Mars does. Hers is in Aries
somewhere (I forget the degree).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Maybe &quot;Keera&quot; has not yet reached her potential to feel complete and happy
&gt; because there are memories a small child within her holds about feeling
&gt; unloved, that she has neglected to allow in her existence to be dealt with
&gt; because they are so very painful.
">

Oh, yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But surface they must if joy in life is to be found. She
&gt; should take that little girl back into her and comfort her through the eyes
&gt; of an adult who has gained experience and wisdom from life, and can reason
&gt; things out in the way a child has not learnt to do . Tr. Saturn will help
&gt; provide the
&gt; reality as it was, so that the ghost of the past can finally be laid to
&gt; rest.
">

Already did that. I guess this transit is a "finish the job" reminder.
Certainly the theme has surfaced lately.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; With tr. Uranus activating the Sun-Pluto square, all that is needed is a
&gt; change of attitude for  'Keera' to be released.
">

That simple, huh? Now, _this_ is where my faith is tested. :-(

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We cannot change the past but we *can* change how we view it. That's the

Hmm... How does that Uranus do that?

Ah, story of my life: Not to be my mother. I was trying to clean out my
grandmother's apartment (a process that's going to take a while) and got
completely sidetracked by old letters, letters going back to the first
years of my childhood in Norway, living with Mom's parents. I got an
unexpected insight into my mother's life at that time, though nothing
that brings her closer to me (I do not understand her). Just some
details that fleshed out who she was - and is. And that now require me
to rethink a few things. Like strange letters I wrote at the time. One
was a rather incoherent attempt at explaining who I loved more: my
grandparents or my mother. My mother lost that contest back then. She
never got a rematch.

&gt; &gt; I eventually reached the stage when I started listening to the guide

&gt; &gt; Imho, the 12th house Sun has to go the step further. Belief is not
enough;
&gt; &gt; it must seek and find faith in itself without any help from anyone. It
must
&gt; &gt; go beyond that which keeps it tied to the realm of substance from which
its
&gt; &gt; beliefs are formed.  I should imagine that it can feel like a long,
lonely,
&gt; &gt; endless path at times, but it's the only one there is.

&gt; Well, I'm alone with my faith, simply because the church that represents
&gt; it doesn't exist in Norway. Doesn't matter, though. I don't feel lonely
&gt; when I'm connected with my god, that's for sure.

&gt; &gt; It truly wasn't my intention to bring BML into this. But from the birth
date
&gt; &gt; you provided, I see its position is in Cancer, opposing Venus . Tr.
Saturn
&gt; &gt; is now conjunct.

&gt; Squares my mother's BML, I think. Or my Mars does. Hers is in Aries
&gt; somewhere (I forget the degree).

&gt; &gt; Maybe &quot;Keera&quot; has not yet reached her potential to feel complete and
happy
&gt; &gt; because there are memories a small child within her holds about feeling
&gt; &gt; unloved, that she has neglected to allow in her existence to be dealt
with
&gt; &gt; because they are so very painful.

&gt; Oh, yes.

&gt; &gt; But surface they must if joy in life is to be found. She
&gt; &gt; should take that little girl back into her and comfort her through the
eyes
&gt; &gt; of an adult who has gained experience and wisdom from life, and can
reason
&gt; &gt; things out in the way a child has not learnt to do . Tr. Saturn will
help
&gt; &gt; provide the
&gt; &gt; reality as it was, so that the ghost of the past can finally be laid to
&gt; &gt; rest.

&gt; Already did that. I guess this transit is a &quot;finish the job&quot; reminder.
&gt; Certainly the theme has surfaced lately.

&gt; &gt; With tr. Uranus activating the Sun-Pluto square, all that is needed is a
&gt; &gt; change of attitude for  'Keera' to be released.

&gt; That simple, huh? Now, _this_ is where my faith is tested. :-(

&gt; &gt; We cannot change the past but we *can* change how we view it. That's the
&gt; &gt; enlightenment that Uranus brings. Imho.

&gt; Hmm... How does that Uranus do that?

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What's shaken right now is my _faith_.

&gt;&gt; &gt; ah shit, that's something you need to do double-time  then. Come on
&gt;Keera,
&gt;&gt; &gt; you're a 12th house Sun! FAITH. Own it. Drink from the bottomless well of
&gt;&gt; &gt; faith, that I call the 12th.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;My faith that there is a good
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; reason for everything, that there is purpose, and that none of this
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (childhood, transits, last night's less than successful meal) has been
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; an exercise in futility. I really don't like having my faith shaken.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It's not like me to not have my usual Sagittarian belief that
&gt;everything
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will turn out all right.

&gt;&gt; Hi Keera,
&gt;&gt; Might I add 1/2 cent's worth to all the encouraging words H has said ?

&gt;&gt; I have Jupiter in the 12th house in Leo square my 9th house Sun, which
&gt;might
&gt;&gt; contain a resemblance to your 12th house Sun position.

&gt;&gt; I was wondering if it's finding something 'to believe in' that is the
&gt;&gt; exercise for  Sagittarius in general, and seeking/finding 'faith' in one's
&gt;&gt; self is a 12th house event.

&gt;I wouldn't know. Most Sagdes I've met have been atheists. Or so they
&gt;said.

&gt;&gt; I can imagine that a 12th house Sag. Sun might
&gt;&gt; then trot or gallop all over the globe (physically or mentally speaking) in
&gt;&gt; search of  'physical' evidence and proof that its belief is justified
&gt;(Virgo
&gt;&gt; influence?).

&gt;Nope. Never felt the need. I have my proof right in my living room or
&gt;wherever I am when my prayer is answered.

&gt;&gt; Too often we tend to believe in that which lies outside
&gt;&gt; ourself. We rely on other people's actions, views and philosophies to lead
&gt;&gt; or guide us and, by doing so, end up extremely disappointed when they are
&gt;&gt; unable to provide that 'something' we are seeking that gives us happiness
&gt;&gt; and inner peace.

&gt;Well, having been bullied for 6 years taught me that other people were
&gt;full of shit. Since I also never had any family religion to buck, I was
&gt;free to believe what I wanted. My spiritual search came from wanting
&gt;something to believe in but never understanding the Christian faith
&gt;(Norway's state religion is Lutheran Evangelical). I then discovered the
&gt;truth of there being many rooms in the house of Jesus' dad, and moved
&gt;into a different one.

&gt;&gt; I eventually reached the stage when I started listening to the guide within
&gt;&gt; myself. Always having had difficulty with the idea of 'a superior force',
&gt;&gt; believing in myself became a necessity for survival :-).

&gt;Whereas I went the other route, looking for a god I could accept because

&gt; Ah, story of my life: Not to be my mother. I was trying to clean out my

&gt; years of my childhood in Norway, living with Mom's parents. I got an
&gt; unexpected insight into my mother's life at that time, though nothing
&gt; that brings her closer to me (I do not understand her). Just some
&gt; details that fleshed out who she was - and is. And that now require me
&gt; to rethink a few things. Like strange letters I wrote at the time. One
&gt; was a rather incoherent attempt at explaining who I loved more: my
&gt; grandparents or my mother. My mother lost that contest back then. She

&gt; I have a lot of anger and hardness to let go of.

I rearranged some furniture last night. :-) Sidsel and Christine have
pointed out my Virgo-Pisces nodal axis, and I'm currently going Virgo on
myself, actually embracing that icky word "routines". My Sag Sun
("Housework? Aw, do I hafta?") and Gemini Moon ("OK, I'll do thi---
oooh, butterfly!") are wondering what hit them, but yesterday's Moon in
Gemini got me moving - furniture. Reclaiming space, getting rid of
clutter, creating peace and ease in my life, removing myself from the
chaos of the past, which has and has had many manifestations. And when I
was done, I even remembered to focus on what I accomplished, not what I
have yet to do.

My life just went and started healing on me, without any warning. Kewl!

PS: T Jupiter sextiling N Sun these days, and is on its way to a 2nd
pass over my MC, trining my Moon, triggering my MA-SA opposition.
Definitely a change of wind.

Your logic of applied astrology continues to amaze me.
What's the difference between a transiting Jupiter over a planetary aspect
'confirming marriage', and  tr. Saturn over a confirmed planetary aspect
also doing its work.....except that you said the first, so that apparently
makes it correct because you mention it so often, and anyone else's
correlarions are considered wrong?

But if Keera will permit, merely as an astrological example;
Let's pretend that MEAN BML in Cancer isn't on a degree that Saturn has been
transiting. This would mean tr. Saturn  opposed Venus and trined Mercury in
Scorpio. The Moon is in no way included in the transit. So where does the
'inner child' reference apply, seeing as the subject is now an adult? Would
any astrologer even consider such a reference to the past, with the aspects
and transits occuring in open houses dealing with 'now'?
Your own applied logic would be much appreciated to explain how you would
interpret such a transit.

O.K. you don't approve of using BML. That's your privilege. But continually
denying it is making its presence felt because you will not accept its place
in astrological thought, when aspects and/or transits show the contrary, is
rather defeating your own astrological aim of 'nailing things down'.

What you seem to fail to consider, Ray, and the whole point of this exchange
of views, is that there WAS an aspect that correlated to what the subject
had INWARDLY experienced, that was NOW under the effect of a current
transit. It isn't a case of putting the aspect to fit the fact, or whether
the fact is 'old' or 'new', or whether an astrologer is (sub)consciously
picking up on things already said. The aspect was there; the transit was
there. That's astrology at work, imho.

Many people, including AAM posters, have been kind enough to provide private
information, and particular themes are repeating themselves. If you would
care to look back at a recent exchange in the BML Symbolism thread between
Juan Revilla and myself regarding BML to Venus, you will see observations
presented which were made before Keera's birth data was made available.
There appears to be a definite similarity.

The current transits may now be doing just that, whilst a look at the Solar

millions of them, and I wouldn't know a hole if I fell in one; and you

forum.That would have removed half the problem in itself (having the
ability to acknowledge it was a problem) and receiving feedback which
indicated the problem was considered real and understandable.
Personally I think more would be achieved by using basic astrology
which we know works, to examine key dates in the long recovery
process, and try to establish how those transits manifested. For
example, a small transit of say Mercury conjunct Pluto may result in a
purely investigative inquiry, but on the other hand a Venus Jupiter
transit may indicate that the action taken (by any party) means more
than it appears on the surface - especially if standard text books
give a clear message.
That sort of thing would be more revealing and helpful than the highly
speculative material about BML which is largely unknown to anyone
here.

&gt;The current transits may now be doing just that, whilst a look at the Solar

something appears to fit right now.

RM: That's what I have been questioning all along. The theme has been
present for years. The only recent event of any great consequence that

books. [I haven't looked at the chart, nor do I have the data].

&gt;They are, indeed, very old and the time had come to deal with them, as shown

&gt;&gt; &gt;transits show the contrary, is
&gt;&gt; &gt;rather defeating your own astrological aim of 'nailing things down'.
&gt;&gt; RM: I don't disagree with astrologers using BML/MLA; in fact I'm
&gt;&gt; checking a lot of people's 'event dates' against it on a regular
&gt;&gt; basis.

would indicate a neurosis. If we DIG, we can always find something
relating to anything if we FIND that thing under the Sun that is
"hidden" but it doesn't prove anything. Hey, we could talk about
something "hidden" with FISH or FROGS or MICROWAVE OVENS and if we
have a good imagination, tell a story about how we have "hidden" that
event.

Modern astrology is more about looking at things realistically and
seeking positive solutions, rather than dwelling on past hurts and
looking for something to blame.

This has just reminded me of a radio interview where the speaker was
comparing some major differences between Eastern and Western cultures.
He was saying in the East, when a problem arises the predominant
attitude is "Quick, how do we fix this!" whereas in the West the
attitude is "Quick, who can we blame!".

claim to see in an event or trait are very obvious indeed; but it
seems a lot harder to get a "hit" with a vague claim that something
associated with (for example) Gemini is "hidden". Anyone with an

My reply is admittedly speculative, but based on some observation.

I would look to Sagittarius and Jupiter, perhaps those with a prominent
Jupiter or an afflicted one, but not necessarily afflicted. Venus would
be another planet to watch. I know one "diabetic" who has Venus exactly
opposite Saturn, but with the sun and moon in Sagittarius. So the
desire to eat sugar is curtailed by Venus's opposition with Saturn. She
stays on her diet but gets "sugarless candies." Sugar is ruled by Venus
but Jupiter-ruled people also want it.

That is very sketchy but a slight contribution I hope.

Another individual I know does not have diabetes at this point but is
vastly overweight and eats almost indiscriminately. She has Sagittarius
rising, Jupiter in Sagittarius, and Venus exactly square Saturn,
replicating the individual mentioned above. Both have Jupiter in
Sagittarius. (Of course that in itself would hardly be a predisposition
to diabetes or overeating but could be contributory.)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Fortunately with a lot of basic astrology, some of the things we
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; claim to see in an event or trait are very obvious indeed; but it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; seems a lot harder to get a &quot;hit&quot; with a vague claim that something
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; associated with (for example) Gemini is &quot;hidden&quot;. Anyone with an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; imagination can find something that fits. Gemini covers one twelfth of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; everything that's ever been thought of - so that gives a terribly wide
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; scope.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Why would anyone want to 'find something that fits', when the something
&gt;&gt; &gt;nagging they feel is often so obvious to them?
&gt;&gt; RM: They don't. It's the astrologer who wants to 'find something that
&gt;&gt; fits' a BML natal or transitting position.
&gt;Your sentance above said 'Anyone', and not 'the astrologer'. You're always
&gt;very astute with your use of words and would make it very clear exactly what
&gt;you meant. 'Anyone' reads as the subject, not the object.

RM: That's exactly what we're talking about. Reading a chart - seeing
BML - telling a client what it supposedly means - and then helping
them find something that fits the general meaning.

&gt;&gt; It seems like a pointless exercise if people have elected to conceal

&gt;&gt; &gt;Using your example, Gemini's 1/12th of 'everything that's ever been

give a wide
&gt;&gt; &gt;scope, it narrows it down to a particular pattern, i.e. one that involves
&gt;&gt; &gt;relationship questions. If it was Taurus, relationships wouldn't enter

Nice animation. I have sent the URL to a friend which who is a counselor for

I have maybe 200-300 charts, scattered with every sunsign/and most all Do

&gt;Your 10 miles on the treadmill should help alot if you are having

&gt;A lot of diabetes can be prevented with diet and exercise. I had a
&gt;touch of it when I was obese and pregnant -- called gestational
&gt;diabetes -- it went away when I lost the weight because my pancreas
&gt;could then supply the insulin needs of my body properly -- instead of
&gt;battling to keep up with the needs of an obese body.

&gt;The nutritionist put me on a high carb (rice, potatoes, pasta) low fat
&gt;and high fiber diet to control it while I was pregnant with my son.
&gt;Check with your physician.

That's the best advice.

"Seek professional medical advice."

My own mother has been a diabetic for 54 years.
90% of my wife's family members and about the same amount of my family
members are diabetics. It is an inherited factor in these cases, not
obesity.

It also seems Sleep Apnea is a common factor shared by both groups, anyone
have a astrological explanations?

&gt; : I have a lot of anger and hardness to let go of.

&gt; I hope you permit:

&gt; The number 4, even though angry and hard, has one other important
&gt; quality: its fate is essentially different from the one of the
&gt; numbers 1 to 3, no longer bound by their fate. In &quot;The Astrology
&gt; of Fate&quot;, Liz Greene mentions a theme that often occurs in fairy
&gt; tales, where, for example, a king has three sons. And there is a
&gt; problem, some unsolved task. The two older sons fail to solve it
&gt; in the same way as their father, because they are much like him.
&gt; The youngest son, the youngest of these four, is often shown as
&gt; a bit stupid or even retarded, but manages to solve the problem
&gt; mainly because his approach is different, not so much &quot;better&quot;
&gt; in absolute terms.

&gt; So, assuming that you are number 4 in the chain, things will be
&gt; different. I associate that also with the number pi (3.14159...).
&gt; A circle with diameter 1 has a circumference of about 3.14; i.e.
&gt; the first 3 of the circle are bound to it; while 4 is only in
&gt; part bound to it (0.14) but the rest is different, is free from
&gt; the fate of the first 3; about 0.86 is part of a new cycle.
">

Well, I am sort of no. 4, the 4th generation of women and the 3rd
generation to be influenced by one woman (my great-grandmother). I also
have a 4 (22) birthpath in numerology.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Identification with the mother and older female ancestors is very
&gt; much a Virgo theme (your n.node conjunct Pluto). I see the nodes
&gt; essentially as a summary of the life of any person. All different
&gt; influences (all the planets, angles, etc.) have in some way to
&gt; express themselves through the nodes. The southern node is more
&gt; of an instinctive kind; instinctively one tends to express things
&gt; that way (in your case, Pisces).

&gt; The northern node (Virgo) requires a more conscious approach.

&gt; The tensions to the full moon (sun opp. moon) are probably not so
&gt; easily released through the northern node, because it is in Virgo
&gt; and Pluto is there.

All very interesting.

&gt; If there is any concrete recommendation I can make, it might be to
&gt; read Liz Greene's &quot;The Astrology of Fate&quot;. Her sun (at 17 Virgo) is
&gt; conjunct your northern node. Her sun is at a square to her n.node
&gt; in Gemini and mean Black Moon Lilith in Sagittarius. Her moon is in
&gt; Sagittarius. From what I gather, she spent quite some time in the
&gt; mid 1990s researching the fates of her ancestors.

&gt; of my astrology program Delphi. Would not have occured to me that
&gt; the reason that some people say that it crashes on some Palm OS 5
&gt; or 6 machines is so simple (installation to an extension card).

&gt; I hope this is not too much &quot;Venus in Leo&quot;, men and women giving

Quite all right. I'm replying late because real life demanded my
attention, but I didn't want you to think that you've written all of the
above for nothing.

Above I am quoted as saying, "Ah, story of my life: Not to be my
mother." That still goes, but my fear of being like her is gone, because
I now know some things I didn't know before. With the death of my
grandma, Mom's mother, things have changed. The women in my family will
still be a theme for me, but now I can approach it with more tolerance
and grace and less anger and fear than before.

Thank you very much for your interpretations. Your astrology impresses
me.
