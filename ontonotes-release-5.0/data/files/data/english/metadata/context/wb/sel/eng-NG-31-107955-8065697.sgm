Someone asked me to get a summertime picture, as I had previously posted a
winter's one.  Today was about 78 degrees at 7500' elevation.  A lovely
breeze.

Lots and lots of hummers, with an unusual number of rufous.  There seemed to
be less broad tails, and a normal number of black chins.  I do believe I did
see a lot of juveniles, though, as many birds were smaller, but still in
there scrapping at the feeders.

My wife doesn't understand how I can go out and take hundreds of bird
pictures.

I don't understand how she can just lay on a couch and read a book.

We also saw a grosbeak, and pinion jays today.  They're there, we just don't
see them as much as the chickadees and chipping sparrows.  We see a lot of
stellar jays in the winter.

We did not also see the resident western flycatcher, but I did see an
unidentified raptor soaring.

Come fall, the juncos will arrive.

I'm going to try to get some pictures of birds at our lowland house.  There
are goldfinches, western tanagers, dove, quail, meadow larks, and many we
haven't learned yet.

We'll just keep feeding them and watching them.

Looks like hummer paradise, Steve!  I really like the photo of the hummer
feeder overlooking that view ..... lovely!

I'm here to stay.  I've just been so busy with moving and other things that
I haven't had much time to bird.  I am getting things together for some
pictures at the lowland house.  We have some rufous hummers here and black
chins.  We had a nice big blue pinion jay this morning at the feeder.
There's American goldfinches and western tanagers here I'm going to try to
photograph.  They seem to be wary and shy, though.

When I get going, I'll have multiple feeders, and get them used to us, then
move in with my blind to get some close shots.

We do enjoy the wildlife.  It's like a kid, &quot;Awwwwwwww.  Look at that cute
little (whatever)!

Wow - great shots!  What kind of camera and lens are you using?  I'm all
excited because I got my first hummingbird pics (posted separately) but
these are to die for!

I currently have a Sony DSCH1, which has now been replaced with better ones,
up to the DSCH9, IIRC.  They are a great little camera, but I am hitting its
limits as far as optics go.  It has a 12x optical zoom.

These pictures were taken from about three to four feet away.  The
hummingbirds at our cabin are so well fed by us that they will come in to
the feeders if you put them a foot away from your face.  I think if you
stood still, you could get them to perch on your hands.  If you can get the
hummers in that close, you can get good pictures with most cameras.  The
difference comes in the tiny details and great focus.  I'm still working on
the focusing to get better detail.

I am currently really looking at the Nikon D40x package with two lenses.  I
think I'm about ready for it.

I had another neat surprise today.  It seems my house in the lowlands has an
abundance of rufous hummers.  So, in a week or so, when I return, I shall
set up a blind close to the feeder, and hope to get some more nice shots
here.

Will post more at flickr.
