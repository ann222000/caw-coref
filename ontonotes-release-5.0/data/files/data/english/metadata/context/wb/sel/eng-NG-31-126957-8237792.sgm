Here is a question, I trying to develop an Elevator Pitch for Chicks
to get them into Subgenius. The problems i have are as follows....

- My path to Subgenius was unusual and not based on marketing at all
rather on getting laid
- I dont think like other subgenius women, let alone the general
populace of females

So what i need is input, what draws a chick to this sausage party?
What made you get involved. What grabbed your attention?

Thanks in advance!

Oh, that's an easy one.
I like being around so many elite, greasy, japanese, pussy-collecting,
geezer-geeks!!!
If a woman isn't scared off by that, then she'll pay to know what she

I saw the Tree of Life in a skateboarding magazine, then read the
article.  I liked the art and the artists.  Then I bought a
second-hand copy of High Weirdness by Mail and sent in my money not
long after that.  In other words...literature, literature, literature.

I suggest an air drop of leaflets.

Roofies? Gunpoint? Really low standards? I guess, from my experience, what
has drawn most of the women to the church is mental illness and/or the fact
that the guys are so homely, awkward, desperate, and pathetic that they're
willing to worship the vagina of even the most butt-ugly of females.

Actually that's probably what sealed the deal for me.  The promise of
sex and fortune, etc.  In fact, the day I joined the church was the
exact same day that I first met the man I am now married to.

If you're targeting only crazy women, that's a huge population.  And
crazy women love joining things.

Personally, it's because I have a short attention span.  I am much
more stimulated by the company of anyone who can make me laugh,
regardless of the fact that they may, in real life look like they
belong under a bridge.  I have an active enough imagination that a
funny guy  (as long as I can't see his face and I can imagine him to
look any way I want) can get my pheramones flying faster than a cute
guy sitting right in front of me, who can't string a sentence together
and doesn't feel hip and confident unless he's thinking like every
other Stepford on the planet is thinking.

Oh, I may fuck the latter...but I RESPECT the former!

My wife was forced to join the church when I bought her a membership

The old &quot;fuck anything that gives a compliment&quot; factor probably works
for a few gals, although &quot;fuck anything that gives multiple orgasms&quot;
makes much more sense.

I wandered into a weekend camping trip with my then new boyfriend and
wound up laughing my ass off at the sheer spectacle that was the 1996
Drill.  It's probably the sense of humor that caught my attention, I
guess, much more than the drooly fanboys.  If person you're talking to
has a twisted sense of humor, it's a good first step.

I, too, utilize the the disposable razors, and then only dispose of
them after several greasy weeks of use. The trick is to never use any
kind of shaving oils, lotions, sprays, powders, or ointments. The
tingle means it's working!

Because it pains me a great deal to see a man with a bad shave,
replete with little errant patches of whiskers strewn throughout and
amidst a plethora of unattractive red bumps, I am going to perform a
public service here:

MISS BINKY'S GUIDE TO A PERFECT SHAVE

(part one in a series designed to get guys in the metrosexual
groove. ...Don't worry, unlike the guy who advocates shoving a
toothbrush up your butt, with the disclaimer &quot;This won't make you
gay&quot;, this really WON'T make you gay...and should help with the
chicks!)

First of all, I am an expert in this field and to let you know a
little about my credentials, I am of Italian decent.  We are known for
our ability to grow enough hair in a week to keep a wig factory in
business.  And I have never heard a snide remark regarding any over-
productive hair growth in unappealing places...no moustache here  (or
anywhere else!)  in fact, my skin is smooth as a baby's ass!  How did
I get that way??  Well, I'll tell ya!

1.) Choose a good razor.  Nenslo, you were correct in your story
regarding your choice of disposable razors.  They're crap!  Ged rid of
them and invest in one of those razors that you purchase replaceable
cartriges for.  Although they cost more, these do last longer so I
figure it evens out in the end price-wise and your skin is happier for
it too.

I've tried the disposable versions of these products and they just
don't work the same.  In fact, after using the former, then trying out
the disposables, it feels like they hone the edge against a brick
before packaging it.

2.)  Use hot water.  While I like to soak in the tub for an hour or
so, which opens up the pores, I don't suggest this for men without a
snorkel or really, really strong lungs.  Another alternative is to do
what the old barbers used to do and put a really hot wash cloth over
your beard for a few minutes.  Opening up the pores is vital to a
smooth and pain-free shave!

3.)  Lather up.  I've used just about every type of shaving cream
imaginable and found it to be no better than a good bar of soap, in
fact I prefer soap.  I use Caress or homemade lavender/lemongrass
soap,  but I'm sure there's a guy-ish soap out there that won't make
you feel like you're turning into a chick...just stay away from Lava
or Lifeboy  (do they still make that soap?).  If your skin is really
sensitive, use a lot of it.

I've also heard a tip from a very smooth-faced fellow, who suggests
shaving with the grain and then against the grain, for you guys who
get a five-o'clock shadow at noon.

4.)  Close the pores.  Rinse your face off with cold water.  Do it a
few times, until your pores become less visible.  There's also after-
shave, which, contrary to what most people think, isn't for making you
smell good as much as it is intended to close the pores.  This will
keep you from getting razor burn.

By following Miss Binky's Guide to a perfect shave, not only will you
have smooth skin that the chicks will dig, but you will develop a
swagger and confidence that will say to the world &quot;I'm a WINNER!&quot;  and
chicks will flock to your bedroom and even go for threesomes and anal
sex! ...and you'll probably win the lottery too!

Let me know how this works out for y'all.

that works for me.  I have hair like Homer Simpson, the instant I stop
shaving a five-o'clock shadow sproings up.

Also electric razors are nice for not getting sliced to ribbons, but
they never really work for me.  Random patches on my face don't get
shaved quite right and I end up looking like a dog with mange.

I got one of those vibraty razors ... it's like a regular razor but it
vibrates while you shave ... I don't know if there's any point at all
to it vibrating but it does give me a very good shave and I haven't
cut myself yet ... PLUS, because it vibrates, you can shove the
smooth, handle-side up your ass, and it won't make you gay.

Nothing gets my day off to a jump start like a little mini-vibrator up
the ass in the morning.

Teen age illegal drinking parties
have fostered many non-reverend
interests and people who are
genuinely interested, I've found.
My amateur rants accompanied
with piss-flavored Keystone
baptisms are enjoyed by none.
My current girlfriend*, who is
raising her reverendship rather
than taking it right out of her
tight pockets, was introduced
by me. God knows why she is
interested.

The soon-to-be-dubbed Kerrence
of the Labia said, &quot;You. And the
humor and some of the art.&quot;

She s'not down with swastikas,
never-mind any explanation. I
think it's the Jewish upbringing
and Orthodox relatives that
for SOME reason migrated shortly
after the Second World War.

Since I am the only one with the prefix &quot;Miss&quot; in here, I am going to
assume this is directed to me.

...So now that I've done that, I am flattered by the invitation and I
am planning a trip out to New Jersey and then New Orleans in the very
near future.  So I suppose if it coincides with the timing of the
devival, Maryland is not too far from Jersey...right?  I would love to
come.  I'll let you know for sure, as soon as my plans for the trip
I'm planning are confirmed.

...Now, I suppose it would be great fun to tell me that you were
addressing someone else :)

If that's the case, I'll show up anyways and bring my goofer dust with
me!
