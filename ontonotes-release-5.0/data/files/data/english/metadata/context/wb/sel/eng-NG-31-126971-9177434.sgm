My computer completely crashed.  I opened the case and found the whole
thing filled with cockroaches.  Many dead ones in the fan seems to
have stopped the fan, and the motherboard was covered with live ones.
I'm suprised they didnt get electricuted.  There were a few dead mice
in there too, between the cards.  I think those did get zapped, and
one was missing part of the tail, probably from the fans.  Guess I
need a new power supply, cpu fan, and some of those slot covers to
keep mice out, but how can I keep the roaches out?  Suppose I got to
install both linux and xp all over again.  That sucks the big one.

Carefully, with thick gloves, take the computer as it is and take it to a
professional waste recycler. Wear a mask to not inhalate the dust and the
fluffies, they may well contain all sort of bio-poison (bacteria, viruses)
and botulism toxins.
Then save your money for a flat free of cockroaches and mice.
Make some professionals clean and decontaminate your flat before you return
it, or ASAP if you want continue to live (and not yet die) there.
How did your neighbors survive the smell?

My brother repairs computers, and they've had people bring in boxes like

It's warm in the case, so I'd guess you live someplace cold?

How did the mouse get in there?  Seal the case up better.  Put mesh on
the fan openings to keep bugs out if you have to.  (Keep them clean,
because a fine mesh will accumulate lint in a big hurry and block

It not only could happen it did, to one of my old machines.  The mouse

Ok .. back in the old days in a lab (we did animal nutrition analyses as
well, so we had one or the other sample stored) we had a blood analysis
machine back in the late 80s, huge device with a round-table sampler and
little vessels circulating on a chain in a water bath, while passing
automatic pipettes and a photometer in the end.
Some day the machine went haywire and pipetted junk or showed cryptic error
messages. The technician took a deep dig into the innards and found
little &quot;pellets&quot; on the position sensor plate. Well, there must have been a
mouse doing &quot;some&quot; business inside :)
Uhm, after a more detailed inspection of our sample storage places we found,
there must have been some more mice at w0rk ...
