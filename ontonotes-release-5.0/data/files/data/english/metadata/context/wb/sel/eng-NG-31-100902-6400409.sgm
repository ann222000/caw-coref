Message-ID: &lt;20010115224418.00345.00001829@ng-cb1.aol.com&gt;

Is everyone happy?  They've finally WON.

I sit here, contemplating why I even BOTHER living on this planet, thinking
I'd
be better off ending my life than tolerating this one, knowing DAMN well
what
happened out here the last five years, watching people tell one big LIE
after
another about me, neglecting to mention A LOT of truths which would shed
proper
light on the matter, never mentioning the political motivations people have
for
attacking me: gymnasts and their fans because I see the truth about USAG;
people in alt.romance because I see the truth about women; people on
rec.gambling.sports because I get in the way of their little scam games
getting
money out of desperate gamblers; people on alt.seduction.fast because they
can't stand someone who sees through their hollow methods; people on
alt.hypnosis who RAPE women and rely on it being believed that all hypnosis
is
self-hypnosis.

For the past six years I have watched a cabal amass against me, unchecked by
ISPs which are immune and which don't want it publicized that hackers have
the
run of their system, or how fragile people's privacy really is out here, and
who cave into the volume of complaints from people with ulterior motives and
louder mouths, again with full knowledge of what REALLY goes on out here,
but
with an incredible burden of time and expense to bother proving it,
something
that cannot be done out here.

My desire to end my life -- one I have no plan of acting on lest anyone
think
I'm in any imminent danger -- is based on ONE thing: in the NEXT life, lies
don't cut it.  God knows all truths, and is not fooled by ANYONE, and yes,
that
includes me.  I know what's in my heart, I know what I have seen and
documented, and I know what is really going on, as do many of you.  A few
years
back, someone posted an ad to a newsgroup claiming to be my MOTHER and a
prostitute, and even posted her telephone number asking men to call her (she
got calls because of this and didn't appreciate it).  Someone recently went
to
JAIL over something similar, but of course people don't bother telling
everyone
that.

A person would have to be a fool to want to exist on a planet which allows
evil
to thrive like this, and to have to deal with an internet which is totally
unregulated and run by criminals, both in the ISP and user categories.  I
have
watched lie after lie about me told, including that I am jobless, a welfare
bum, that I have made death threats against children, that I am a pedophile,
a
child molster, a hacker, and probably a dozen more lies which I can't even
remember right now.  I have seen the people who have either made or
witnessed
these remarks act as if my responses were unprovoked, and can think only to
how
God sees both sides, knows what has happened, and is sitting in wait to pass
proper judgment on everyone involved.

I see a SICK society that thinks it can put one over on God, that there is
no
retribution in the next life, no accountability, and no need to fight for
justice in this one.  In the next life, I see a God who will set everyone
straight and to whom their cries will fall on deaf ears.  I can already hear
people celebrating my exit (from USENET, that is), and frankly I do not care
anymore.  The people who drove me off here are not the ones who bother me,
but
the spectators who say "good decision" are.  It is those smug little
assholes
for whom God's punishment will be the worst: the ones who could have spoken
up,
could have said something, but whose silence only cemented the false
impression
that the liars were willing to create.

If anyone thinks censorship by harassment and bullying, as well as terrorism
and extortion, is something to celebrate, let them.  All I can say is that
God
is watching and throwing up at the sight of people who stand by and do
nothing
when a lynching is taking place.  Contrary to popular belief, I have a life,
a
job, yet I do not share my successes, and recently there have been many,
with
anyone, out of fear that if it were known to others that the cabal would
move
its harassment of me offline to propogate its lies into my daily life.  As
those who are aware of what has happened to me out here have already
accepted
me, I have never felt it necessary to tell everyone I come into contact with
a
pile of lies and distortions which has accumulated against me over the
years,
or that any negative behavior on my part was almost entirely provoked by
this
horrid campaign.

For my own well-being, I am in the process of systematically listing the
names
of everyone I consider responsible for this, in order, with specific
references
to their specific actions which have caused me to feel that way, and am
locking
the document away in a safe place.  Such is my right as this is a free
country.
That people would care enough to monitor how long it took me to return here
or
whether or not I did, or cite some kind of problem if I did return, is so
sickening that it defies description.  I am very confident that if I were
ever
to end my life, and that all truths were known to OBJECTIVE observers, that
they would not blame my decision for one moment, and would cast a very
negative
eye on those who continued to harass me, defame me, threaten me, and to do
so
in the most cowardly fashion possible -- online, behind anonymous posting
identities, and in a group of dozens or even hundreds ganged up against ONE
PERSON.

A world that treats me in the manner in which I have been treated and then
has
the GALL to blame me when ignoring the true cause is not a world I get any
joy
from living in.  A world which says that I could have avoided this problem
simply by censoring my own free speech fails to acknoweldge that this
creates
an even larger problem in that people are no longer free to speak their
minds,
and I'm talking about simple truths like discrimination, child abuse in
gymnastics, hypnosis abuse, or that men who practice speed seduction may be
doing something wrong.

They say silence speaks volumes.  Well then, listen to mine, because it's
going
to get LOUDER and LOUDER as more and more time passes and you realize that
I'm
really not coming back this time.  Should I get any more depressed, maybe
one
day I'll say that to the entire world and just leave the planet altogether,
and
then people can talk about how they had nothing to do with it and how sorry
they felt.

I open this side of myself as a warning to those who think the internet
allows
them to speak freely: it does not.  It is nothing more than a grade-school
popularity contest where popularity trumps truth, bullying trumps justice,
and
where people like to tell others what information out here is good and bad,
without regard to its intrinsic quality or that those doing the "informing"
may
not know themselves what is correct.

I leave this cesspool to all of you so that you can blame someone else the
next
time a flame war breaks out, or the next time someone says something I have
already said, with a stern warning that anyone who accuses someone of being
me
without absolute proof and who tries to pick open this wound will be
damaging
and harming me with a lie.

I watched as a book which I had sold several hundred copies of and made a
decent income from in a year, with positive reviews from those who were not
biased or who had ulterior motives, attacked, scanned and put on a website
for
free in violation of my copyright, and forcing me to the point where I had
to
GIVE it away, along with another book, so that people could get the
information
without having to worry about whether or not the defamation they heard about
me
was true.  That book is read by hundreds of people a WEEK now, and
influencing
their love lives in a positive way.

As I have said before when I left, there will be NO forgiveness unless those
who are withholding information which would shed proper light on this come
clean with that information to me privately (hey, everyone has my contact
information so they know what to do), but not anonymously.....don't tell me
you're on my side or tell me anything you aren't willing to tell the whole
world.  I already know the truth and hearing it from someone who wants to
clear
their conscience and tell me but who lacks the courage to go public is no
friend of mine and needs to find another way to feel better about
themselves.
Failure to speak up might just cause a suicide sometime down the road, you
never know......as of now I plod along, but barely.......if you want that on
your conscience, be my guest, but hey who has a conscience anymore.

Blame me all you want, frankly I do not care.  God has the truth, I have it,
and some of you have it.  When people are done attacking this post that
truth
will surface somehow, someway.  Again, it's not my concern.  I've fought
this
crap longer than any reasonable human being can be expected to, and for my
efforts I have had nothing but people attempting to destroy me.

If it's too much to ask to rebuild the good parts of my life in peace, I can
exit the planet at any time.  I'd suggest no one fuck with me from this
point
forward.

Nobody that is anybody in the seduction world is going to come here to
debate you gordon.  Why should they?  First of all, you are suing most of
them so I would think their lawyers have told them to ignore you.  Not a bad
play for someone that has made it through their hard work, and is not
anxious to share the fruits of THEIR labor with you.  I  don't think any of
them want to share their credibility with you.  Since they worked to earn it
and you did not.

These are people who don't just sell Ebooks, they do seminars, bootcamps,
telephone conferencing, DVDs, workbooks, entire courses, and a load of other
things.  They don't just sit down one weekend, write and ebook, and expect
the world to reward them with millions of dollars.  They work, they
advertise, and they mostly don't market to USENET.  Probably because they
don't see it as a big enough market, and also because they are purposefully
staying away from you.  Hell one company even refuses to do business in PA
just so you won't have a way to sue them.  The do business overseas and in
49 other states, but the millions of people in PA can't buy their material
because of YOU.

A guy that lives in California, who finally abandoned this USENET group,
which he set up, just to get away from you.  He even set up a group just for
you so you would get out of his hair and leave him alone.  But nooooo,
little gordie has spent years chasing him around the country with his kooky
legal theories, none of which in 6 years has ever stood up to Court
scrutiny, just to make himself feel better.

Whine all you want gordie, threaten to kill yourself, nobody will pay
attention to it any more than people who are looking for seduction advice
do.

Gordo you just spent a week ranting about mystery contemplating suicide and

that.  You whined in ASF that'd you were considering killing yourself to try
