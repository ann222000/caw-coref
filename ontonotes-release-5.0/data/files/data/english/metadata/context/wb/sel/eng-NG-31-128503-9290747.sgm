Since I began my blog I've had problems uploading .jpg images to my
blog (it usually takes 2 - 3 tries before it's successful) When I
attempt to upload the file, it simply does nothing.  Eventually I stop
and restart, after an attempt or two It will finally upload.

Tonight I've tried NUMEROUS times and nothing... It still won't upload
the file.

Any help?

Thanks!

How big is the file you are trying to upload?
