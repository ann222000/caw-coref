So you need International Geocoding?

I'm using the GNS database from

It has almost 4 million populated places. My implementation provides
an approximate geocode of a city, state, and country. If you don't
give the state - it guesses.

Normal Version

With Google Map API of the Result

Worldkit's geocoder uses the same data (see
) but when I checked Manila
Philippines - they don't give the location for the capital city.

If there are multiple cities in the same country (and the user
doesn't enter the state properly), I prioritize
1) the capital city
2) an administrative capital
3) places with higher population (unfortunately this information only
covers a small percent of the GNS database)

If there are still multiple instances of a city in a country, then I
give an error message.

I'd appreciate feedback. How accurate is this? Are there any major
inaccuracies?

For my purposes, I'm happy if it is within 1-5 miles. I just want
people to find other people, groups, and events that are near them.
I don't need street-level geocoding for that =)

Somebody should offer this as a webservice. I guess I might do it,
but I'm not sure my cheap shared hosting plan can take the traffic.
If you want to implement it yourself, the mysql database I'm using is
around 400mb (could possibly be reduced in size, as 2/3 of it is
indexes). I might make it available (and the php code to run it) in
the future once I make sure everything works ok.

I'll talk to geocoder.us and see what the best thing is to do
regarding a web service.

Hi Aaron, great stuff
Since you're on the subject and seem to be in it at the moment, please
concider this request. I think an xml file extracted from these same
data files you are using would really be usefull to a lot of us. I
haven't had the time to do it myself.
Maybe you could compile an xml file with the same base marker structure
as GMaps example?

&lt;markers&gt;
&lt;marker lat=&quot;&quot; long=&quot;&quot; state=&quot;&quot; city=&quot;&quot; country=&quot;&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/markers&gt;

Cheers

Hi Tibor,

the GNS database is more than 700MB uncompressed.
A big xml file will be unusuable.
Your only option is to import this data in your database of choice, and
use it from there.

Cheers,

Hi Aaron,

We use the same data and do provide a service for people
to map out their groups, etc. on a map at:

We'd be happy to provide a geocode web service if people want
that.

Other than that, it seems you've added the state in addition
to the cities, and have a way of dealing with multiple entries.
We've been stumped by that, and have taken the easy way
out by picking one (the last entry) and hoping it's correct.

Would be very interested in pursuing a discussion with you
on how to get more accurate data in our database, either
by taking your db, or improving our import mechanism.

Thanks for bringing this up for discussion.

Hi Aaron

Good work!

If I enter &quot;vancouver&quot; and &quot;british columbia&quot; then your page says that
it couldn't find my state, but found the city and corrected the state
to &quot;British Columbia&quot;.

Claire,

In my system people can choose to use the state if they want to.

I suspect there will be problems with state names being slightly
mispelt. The solution for this is to create some kind of spell
checker, and/or a database of either common mispellings or alternative
names (often proper names that are translated into English can be done
so in multiple ways).

For spell checking, someone recommended Metaphone

Alternatively you could use the Google search API to do spell-checking,
but it might not do a good job with non-English state names.

Also the list of states is incomplete. For instance, for France it has
the 22 regions - not the 100 departments. How are people in France
going to know this?

Otherwise you could create a drop down list of states that is populated
when the user types in the country. Unfortunately there are over 4000
states in the GNS database, so storing them in javascript would make
for large webpages.

For dealing with multiple entries I used the DSG field which tells you
if the place is a capital city or an adminstrative (aka state) capital,
and PC field (Population Code).

I'm guessing this kind of method could have 90-95% accuracy. Hard to
say without a thorough testing process. Also, the accuracy might vary
considerably by country. Some countries might have more duplicate city
names, and some countries might not have their smaller cities in the
database.

You also take in account that sometimes the same city appears several
times, once in english and once in the native spelling (the nt field
may be N for Native or V for Variant or...)

There are still some duplicates that I don't know why are they
duplicated. They are usually together, and they have minimal
differences in their position. Any further insight about this issue
will be appreciated.

I have built a search engine that downloads suggestions as the user
completes the name. It's still very very alpha quality, but you can
take a look at

It starts giving suggestions after you type three or more letters.

I tried several strategies to reduce the bandwidth used between the
server and the client, but they made things slower due to the posterior
javascript massaging I had to do. I still expect however to find a way
to reduce the bandwidth usage and make javascript run fast.

More Filtering

If there are multiple entries that are approximately in the same area,
then you can just pick one or take an average.

Eg if both the latitude and longitude of the two places are within say
0.1 degrees, then you are probably dealing with the same city.

I'm going to try doing that.

<POSTER> Claire </POSTER>

We used the files from:

These files do not have the state names in them.
Where did you guys find the State names? Am I
missing something?

The double entries are indeed troublesome.
e.g., for Paris, the file contains:

45.6333333,5.7333333,P,PPL,,Paris
48.8666667,2.3333333,P,PPLC,1,Paris

(lat,lng,FC,DSG,PC,Fullname_ND)

The second entry is correct. What is the
first entry pointing to? Also what is the difference
between PPL and PPLC for DSG? I suppose
your heuristic is to pick the one that has a
greater value of PC?

Joaquin, your search thing looks cool. Don't know
if this can address the issue, though.

Over time, our users have been very helpful in correcting
the entries. We've had users pointing problems to us,
and then we have gone and corrected them. This is a
manual process, however, and is very tedious.

I just found another one, for India where the population
hueristic does not apply:

28.4333333,77.3166667,P,PPL,,Faridabad
17.3591667,78.2983333,P,PPL,,Faridabad

My heuristic fails also, as the first one is more
accurate.

There's another hueristic, and this might work:

Take a look at the last column mod_date. It seems
both the correct entries in this case have the later
date. So, they seem to be adding entries over each
other rather than deleting the previous entry?

Faridabad is in two states
-Haryana
-Andhra Pradesh

In this case you need to let the user choose.

I'm fixing bugs on my implementation - so now if you type in Faridabad
it will show you these two states.

I don't have it setup so the user can actually click on the state (cuz
I'm lazy). But they can paste the state name into the state box.

I tried this out on some data and it looks like the success rate for
international geocoding is very roughly around 90%.

The 10% failure is due to: mispelt cities, mispelt states, multiple
cities in a country, and cities that aren't in the database.

Anyways, I wrote a sample webservice using NuSOAP (a php library)

*Sample Client*

&lt;?
//include nusoap.php here...
//download nusoap from

$cData = new
soapclient('

$aData =
$cData-&gt;call('IntlGeocode',array('sCity'=&gt;'Vancouver', 'sState'=&gt;
'','sCountry'=&gt; 'Canada'));

print_r ($aData);

?&gt;

I'd create something for xml-rpc, but I need a good xml-rpc tutorial.
And a simple example of a server and client where the client passes
multiple variables to the server, and is returned an array. Could
someone help me with that?

I was having trouble adapting the example that comes with the xml-rpc
php module.

Duplicates
1/4 of the places in the GNS database are city/country duplicates.

Thus if you are trying to get a unique record based on a city/country
combination then it will often fail.

For instance, France has 23000 duplicate city/country combinations, out
of 97000 places. 1/4 are duplicates.

Examples
Saint-Martin - 230
Saint-Jean - 163
Saint-Pierre - 156

For the entire thing, I detected slightly over 1 million duplicates out
of 3.7 million populated places (a subset of the database).

Better than a 75% success rate is still possible because I think larger
cities are less likely to have duplicates - and most of the time you
will be geocoding larger cities.

Hi,

We have now created a web service at:

that can give you lat/lng given the name of a city, state, and country.
Check out the parameters to the service by using the URL

Please note that this is in very early stages, so there are no
gaurantees.
Right now, the state parameter is ignored and the service returns
results it finds based on City and Country.

We will be improving this over the week, so any comments are
appreciated.

Currently there is no throttle on the service, so please do not
bombard it with queries.

We have implemented the new features, and the International Geocode
should be more flexible now. It does honor the state input also.

You can get the new interface from

Now it returns an array of five objects. Each object contains a lat,
lng, city, state, and country.

In case it finds less than five objects, it will return nulls for those
values. Null is returned if no values are found. Let me know if you
want more objects returned, and we can set it to 10 instead of 5.

Give it a spin, and let me know what you think. Will appreciate any
feedback. This is work-in-progress, so please excuse errors and bugs.

The 'source code' is an XML description of the Web Service API that is
exposed by the service. For example it describes the 'Coordinates'
object that is returned by the function, 'getCoordinates'.
It also describes the parameters (city, state, country) required by the
service.

You use this API to call the Web Service at:

If it will help, I can post a simple Java client that can be used with
Apache Axis to make the Web service call.

our apologies, the webservice is currently very sensitive to names and

Try looking for:

Cambridge,Cambridgeshire,United Kingdom
Raleigh,North Carolina,United States

We'll be improving the interface in the coming days to accept short

Let us know if the above queries still do not work.

&gt;&gt; You use this API to call the Web Service at:

Hi there
Yes me too ?
Are your geocoders in database format ? in which case would it possible
to have access to a csv or an sql file, this would make me gain loads
of time, of parsing nga and other files ?
I'm also curious of what rows you would put in your tables for a
geocoder ?

The MySQL is rather big. Mine is 400 mb, though you might be able to
get rid of some of the 250mb of indexes. Still I think it'd be more
than 300mb and probably at least 350mb.

I created three tables. One for the places. One for
states/administrative districts. One for countries.

Here are the fields I used:

Geonames Table
3.6 million rows - up to 4.5 million if you include unpopulated
places
iAdmid smallint(6)
ID mediumint(8)
sRegionCode tinyint(3)
fLat float
fLong float
sDSG varchar(255)
sPopulationcode char(2)
sCountrycode char(2)
sADM1 char(2)
sADM2 char(2)
sCountrycode2 char(2)
sFull_namend varchar(255)

ADM Table
4791 rows - states/administrative districts
iAdmid smallint (6)
sCountryCode char (2)
sADM char (2)
sName varchar (100)

country_code table
251 rows (includes very small islands)
ID smallint (6)
sCountrycode char (2)
sName varchar (200)

The webservice works ok. It doesn't work if you have a slightly old
version of Nusoap.php (ex. version 0.6.7 which is only 8 months old
gives a string error).

I would suggest
1) providing a webservice that guesses the longitude and latitude if
there are multiple city/country combinations.

AND (in a seperate service)

2) providing the user with the information that they need to make an
informed guess (notably DSG and the Population Code)

For information on prioritization, see my previous posts. Basically:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If there are multiple cities in the same country (and the user
&gt;doesn't enter the state properly), I prioritize
&gt;1) the capital city
&gt;2) an administrative capital
&gt;3) places with higher population (unfortunately this information only
&gt;covers a small percent of the GNS database)

"/>

Also, if two or more cities are within a couple miles of each other (I
did plus or minus 0.1 degrees longitude/latitude), assume that they are
the same city.

Without a state you'll still have massive trouble (as 1/4 of the
city/country combinations are duplicates). And getting a state might
be hard, as each country has it's own way of organizing its state
structure (ex. in france they use regions, when you might expect them
to use departments -- france has two levels of states).

You can download my PHP script and my MySQL database (my compact
version of the GNS database).

Note: The script outputs an array of states, if the user doesn't
provide one (and if it doesn't make sense to guess the state).

My script doesn't include the code to ask the user to choose a state,
and then to find the longitude/latitude based on that. However that's
pretty simple stuff and is slightly dependant upon your user interface.

Hi Raj,
- I noticed that you did some improvements. How sensitive is your
webservice exactly?
- I'd like to add in my app a drop down country list with french
spelling. Could you give us a complete list of countries which are
supported?
- i don't receive any time out errors anymore but it's quite long
(20-25 seconds) when there's no result. Is that time the regular
response time?

Thanks a lot for your answer.

<POSTER> Raj </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2005-10-17T22:26:00 </POSTDATE>

Hi Ludovic,

- Don't know how sensitive the service is right now. Quite a few
people have made world-wide entries at zeemaps.com and they seemed to
be satisfied with the results they are getting. No major complaints so
far.

- Yes, the country list is available from the original data source.
You can get the list from their FTP server at:
. I think it's the
_fips_country_code_def.txt file. Keep in mind that we capitalized each
word of all countries.

- The service is currently not throttled, and if there's heavy load
then response times can be really poor. For example, yesterday we
noticed someone was doing several geocoding queries relatively fast,
and it brought the server to a crawl.

We are looking at throttling solutions, but it doesn't seem that
straightforward. We are using Apache 2.0 with mod_jk, tomcat, and axis
servlet. If anyone knows how to effectively throttle requests, please
let me know. Otherwise, we'll work out our own solution. The idea would
be to space out automated queries somewhat so that the server doesn't
get too bogged down.

BTW, this looks like an interesting applciation for a nice distributed
P2P service. If someone has ideas of how we can distribute the load
over several servers so that one server doesn't bear the whole load,
let us know.

Raj

1) I'm not sure I understand this point. Usually, a city/state/country
spec is pretty unique. We also do provide upto five answers when there
are multiple results.

2) Oops... we already took that information out when importing the
data. So, will have to wait until we need to re-import again.

3) I suppose the last two points you are making is for trying to clean
up the data. This may not be necessary in practice as if there are
multiple locations close to each other as long as each one of them is
correct in its own way, then we are okay. Sometimes cities have
multiple names, or they may record different points in the same city.
For our purpose (zeemaps) we are trying to give users a general handle
of a location on a world map.

Yes states could potentially be an issue, but again in practice it may
be okay.

Let me know if you notice any specific problems with the results
returned.

That being said, this is still work under progress. If the service
receives too many requests concurrently, it seems to come to a halt. We

it's great that when I only right a few letters he returns

Okay, we have an EARLY version of REST and XML-RPC interface available
for testing.

For the REST interface:

Try:

It should give you back CSV lines as:
48.866667,2.333333,Paris,France (general),France
45.633333,5.733333,Paris,Rhone-alpes,France
where the CSV lines are:
latitude, longitude, city, state, country

For the XML-RPC interface:
Here's my test python client:

import xmlrpclib
server_url = '
server = xmlrpclib.Server(server_url);
print server.getCoordinates('delhi', '', 'India')

This prints out:

[{'latitude': 28.800000000000001, 'city': 'Bawana Delhi', 'state':
'Delhi', 'longitude': 77.033332999999999, 'country': 'India'},
{'latitude': 28.666667, 'city': 'Delhi', 'state': 'Delhi', 'longitude':
77.216667000000001, 'country': 'India'}, {'latitude': 28.75, 'city':
'State Of Delhi', 'state': 'Delhi', 'longitude': 77.25, 'country':
'India'}, {'latitude': 28.75, 'city': 'Union Territory Of Delhi',
'state': 'Delhi', 'longitude': 77.25, 'country': 'India'}, {'latitude':
28.616667, 'city': 'Delhi Paharganj', 'state': 'Delhi', 'longitude':
77.216667000000001, 'country': 'India'}]

This is all preliminary versions to be tested. Pl. let me know if you
see any problems. We are working on better documentation and further
testing.

Thanks, Tibor.

The unusually long delay is because it's doing a lot of searching etc.
and not finding those strings. We are currently working on the
performance issue, and it should be fixed soon.

The XML-RPC and REST interfaces that I just posted should not have such

I noticed that your search engine function looks for substring of the

Ex: if I type: ban in india the first results will be cities :
Abaibani, India
Agaibani, India
Asanbani, India
Asurabandh, India
Babbanpur, India
and not those starting with 'ban' like bangalor or bangali

City &lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;TEXT&quot; NAME=&quot;city&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

$params = array(
'city' =&gt; $HTTP_POST_VARS['city'],
'state' =&gt; '',
'country' =&gt; $HTTP_POST_VARS['country']
);

Why isn't this working? When I type the city &amp; country in the source code
instead, it works fine.

Hi Raj
I&quot;m thinking of how to mirror your service cause once people will be
using it massively it can quickly go into overload. could you please
describe which language you use and which DB, to see if we can help out
on this point, if your interested ?
This is also to know in what format we should set up data if we want to
send you our DB content (I have correct France geocoding), coz
sometimes(very few :) results are ambiguous.

I made a city suggestion system as people type in the city name, and
when they click on a suggestion takes them to that location, check it
out
it calls your SOAP interface through HttpRequest, works great :-),

Hi Tibor,

Thanks for using the service and your feedback.

We do the name matching for city name and state name using the
Postgresql regular expression matching, case insensitive. So, for
example if you do:

bang&amp;state=&amp;country=India

You should get:

31.186944,75.992222,Banga,Punjab,India
24.866667,88.283333,Bangabari,India (general),India
24.866667,88.283333,Bangahari,India (general),India
26.783333,94.583333,Bangali,Assam,India
26.783333,94.583333,Bangali Garigaon,Assam,India

You can find more information about the regular expression syntax at:

We can certainly increase the number of results to 10. Will get to it,
may take some time. Let me know if it is urgent.

Hi Tibor,

We are using postgresql as our database. The query for geocoding is
written as a PL/pgsql stored procedure.

One way you can help is if you can put a link to Zeemaps
( ) on your site :-)

More seriously, it will be great if you can provide some of the
geocoding on your server. For instance, we could distribute by country.
If you have good data for France, then we can send queries for France
to your site, and the rest of the queries can be answered from zeemaps
server. To start off, we can do this manually and later shift to a more
automated system.

Let me know if this makes sense and I can post some more details of
the DB schema and the stored procedure.

So far, the server seems to be handling the load okay after the
performance improvements.

don't have much experience with SOAP, RPC nore REST, but it doesn't

just one single string of text for the REST interface? For instance, I
am limited on space and can only easily display one text field. I
envision just sending directly whatever is entered, something like:

?region=San+Diego%2C+CA+92103

It's possible that on your end you could do a &quot;best guess&quot; via regular
expressions. Or is this already possible?

Hello,

I tried the SOAP connection on my localhost and everything works fine. But,
when I upload it to an external server, I get the following message:

HTTP Error: Couldn't open socket connection to server
, Error (110): Connection
timed out

What is going wrong, do I have to change something in the server config?

Regards,
Paul

Sure. SOAP, XML-RPC, and REST are not that hard to set up, they just
sound big at the moment:-)

I'd suggest you start with REST, which is the simplest of all. Here you
are just providing a URL to your clients, with the right parameters.
Instead of returning HTML, you will return a list of CSV values. You
can do this in your favorite language for web server ... looks like you
are using PHP, we use Java servlets.

For SOAP and XML-RPC, pick up the PHP libraries for severs and they
should have instructions on how to write the servers. They are usually
simple. For example, we got the basic Python XML-RPC server working in
about an hour or so.

P.S. I could not locate our link on your web page. Am I missing

Well, I suppose the question is which side we do the parsing, on the
client or the server :-) You could also do the parsing on the
Javascript or your server side and then send the query with appropriate
parameters to our server.

In general that may be a better solution as it takes some load (albeit
small) off the server.

Hi Raj,
Your SOAP interface is now really fast (maybe faster than my DB
:)...Great !!

I have another request...Maybe it's too much or you simply don't have
data...Would it be possible, when city is empty in our queries that you
return the centroid of the country rather than 5 first cities. It would
be cool.

Hi Ludovic,

Thanks. Glad to know the performance is improved now.

Regarding the centroid of countries, how about if we have another
function, say getCentroid(country), or getCoordinates(country)?

That way, the change will be backward compatible.

Thanks Raj
Will be checking the REST, SOAP and XML-RPC as soon as I get a moment,
about your link please look on the open atlas projects page. I don't an

better.

Hi Raj,
Good idea. Let us know when this new function will be available. Both
names seem ok to me.

Thanks a lot

Hi Ludovic,

We have augmented the Geocoder with the function getCoordinates(String
country). As before, it returns null when country is not found,
otherwise returns the lat,lng,city,state,country. Currently the city
and state are empty or null, but in the future we might be able to fill
in these values.

This is available as both REST and SOAP.

Let me know if somone wants this as XML-RPC also.

Best wishes

Raj

There was a bug in the script. I was referring to the wrong table. It
should work better now, though I haven't tested it.

Hi List,
I'm having problem with my php-soap client to query zeesource soap
interface since geocoder return also country centroid. I'm using nusaop
library (v 1.94 2005/08/04).

I can't get city coordinates anymore. I only receive centroid of
country.Does anyone experiencing the same problem or have an idea?
Thanks a lot for your help?

Here is my simple php test code:

include('./lib/nusoap.php');
$wsdl = &quot;&quot;;

$client = new soapclient($wsdl, 'wsdl');

$parametres = array(
'city' =&gt; 'Faridabad',
'state' =&gt; 'Haryana',
'country' =&gt; 'India'
);

$result=$client-&gt;call('getCoordinates', $parametres);

// Display the result
echo '&lt;h2&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;';
else print_r($result);
echo '&lt;/pre&gt;';

And here answer i receive:

Array
(
[city] =&gt;
[country] =&gt; India
[latitude] =&gt; 20
[longitude] =&gt; 77
[state] =&gt;
)

Interestingly, I'm not experiencing the same problem with a Java SOAP
client. So, we were wondering if this is a PHP/SOAP issue for
overloaded function.

The server has two functions: getCoordinates(city, state, country) and
getCoordinates(country). The SOAP client is returning the country
coordinates, even though a city and state are specified.

php-nusoap list finally gave me an explanation (Thanks to Scott
Nichol):
&quot;NuSOAP does not support polymorphism of methods in WSDL. In cases
where services use polymorphism, only the last definition in the WSDL
is
used by NuSOAP. A workaround is to call the service without using
WSDL.&quot;

I've corrected my code. Everything is ok now. I past here the code i
use to connect with success Zeesource SOAP interface using nusoap
library:

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;?php

include('../path to/nusoap.php');

$service = &quot;&quot;;
$client = new soapclient($service);

//to receive city coordinates
$params = array('city' =&gt; 'Faridabad','state' =&gt; 'Haryana','country' =&gt;
'India');

//if you need country centroid coordinates use:
//$params=array('country' =&gt; 'India');

$result=$client-&gt;call('getCoordinates', $params);

// Check for errors
$err = $client-&gt;getError();
if ($err)
{
// Display the error
echo '&lt;h2&gt;Error&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;' . $err . '&lt;/pre&gt;';
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

{
// Display the result

I tried running your example but got the following error. I suspect the
problem lies in the server I'm using (University of Linköping). Does
anyone have an explanation?

Someone else from the same region had a similar problem. Don't know
what caused it. Maybe a firewall issue?

Try accessing the REST interface at:

This seemed the work fine for the other person.

Hi!

I'm having problems getting a script to work with this web service. I
tried using the scripts posted here previously, the ones with the
$params array preset to $params = array('city' =&gt; 'Faridabad','state'
=&gt; 'Haryana','country' =&gt; 'India');
I've written a script of my own based on that one. The difference is
that I've added a simple search form from which $params is set via a
variable called $request. When I run it I don't seem to get anything
back from the web service.

This is my code:
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html;charset=iso-8859-1&quot;&gt;

&lt;?php
// include the SOAP classes
include('lib/nusoap.php');

// define parameter array
$request = array('city' =&gt; $_GET['city'],
'state' =&gt; $_GET['state'],
'country' =&gt; $_GET['country'] );
print_r('REQUEST');
print_r($_GET);

if (sizeof($_GET)&gt;0)

{

$params = $request;

print_r('PARAMS');
print_r($params);

$service = &quot;&quot;;
$client = new soapclient($service);

$result=$client-&gt;call('getCoordinates', $params);

// Check for errors
$err = $client-&gt;getError();
if ($err)
{
// Display the error
echo '&lt;h2&gt;Error&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;' . $err . '&lt;/pre&gt;';

}

else
{
// Display the result
echo '&lt;h2&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;';
print_r($result);
echo '&lt;/pre&gt;';

}

// kill object
//unset($client);
}

else
{
echo &quot;Not all data given in HTTP request&quot;;
}

//&lt;form action=&quot;client3.php&quot;&gt;
?&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Input course code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;form method=&quot;get&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;TEXT&quot; name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;TEXT&quot; name=&quot;state&quot;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;TEXT&quot; name=&quot;country&quot;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;SUBMIT&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

These are the messages I get:
Array ( [city] =&gt; Faridabad [state] =&gt; Haranya [country] =&gt; India )
Array ( ) Array ( [city] =&gt; Faridabad [state] =&gt; Haranya [country] =&gt;
India )
Result
Array
(
[0] =&gt;
[1] =&gt;
[2] =&gt;
[3] =&gt;
[4] =&gt;
)

Am I sending information of a wrong type? What can I do to get this to
work? I'd be really thankful for any help since this is an application
I'm hoping to use in a school project.
