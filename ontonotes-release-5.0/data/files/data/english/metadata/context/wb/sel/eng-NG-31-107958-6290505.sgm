Skip and Lydia got beat up pretty bad and I hope it doesnt ruin their
dream.
However, the few people I know (3) who did this sorta thing, spending
years building a boat, defferred sailing until she was finished, etc.
sailed a short way and ended their dream.
How does this happen?  I call it the "Cruising World" syndrome.  The
magazines dont give a real pic of what it is like.  Most of the
problems are not physical but mental.  Days at 4 knots and soon you
are so bored you are talking to jellyfish.  Then suddenly you are so
scared you become a jibbering idiot.  Then you anchor and you and your
spouse drive each other nuts being so close.  Mowing that lawn at your
old place ashore starts to look real good.

How to keep it from happening?  Dont defer sailing while you build.
Keep your small boat and sail and cruise regularly.  I think Skip and
Lydia ought to have stuck to their original plan of daylight sailing
only EVEN IF IT MEANT GOING DOWN THE ICW DITCH.  This would have
exposed many flaws in the plan until they could jump on the outside to
Naples and then Everglades City.  From there it is a daylight trip to
Marathon.  By the time they really needed to sail at night they'd be
good.

I know another couple who just bought a big boat to fix up, by
coincidence, a Morgan.  They talk of selling their old 25' boat but I
hope they dont until the big boat is really ready.

This fact speaks loudly. The weather by S&amp;L's account was 25 knots
with 6-8' waves. Regardless of wave frequency or if 30 K and 10'
waves. And yes I have worked the GOM. Those conditions are an
excellent day in most waters. And for a 46' boat !?!?!?

YES..... I agree!

I have met four couples in the last 6 years who fit this pattern. Most
recently in a little harbor called Winchester Bay, OR. The couple
worked in finance, bought a never sailed 42' something. It was so
shinny bright white I had to wear shades. She drank wine, he worked
busily adding do-dads. After 1+ years getting ready for their "Dream"
the two headed out over the bar. They got about 3 miles off shore, got
knocked around, the alternator light went on and they returned to
port. The boat has not left the slip since. That was three years ago.

I wont detail the Rawson 30 couple. They are a case study and she is
just a ....case. Neither have ever sailed, she doesnt know how to swim
because she doesn't like the water, bought the boat over the internet
sight un seen, and have spent the last four years "fitting" their
vessel for their Dream cruise to Mexico and beyond.

The one common word I hear in every case
is.................................. DREAM. For some reason people
have lives they want to escape and sail away to paradise. For them a
sailboat is a symbol of freedom, a blissful way of life that can free
you from the shackles of stress, boredom, drudgery, and pressures of
deadlines, bills, screaming kids, or a demanding boss. In other words,
if I buy this thing it will make me feel happy.

Agreed. And I would add that equipment (as seen in their magazine)
will solve ALL problems. "...This NAV gizmo will guide your boat through
any treacherous channel. My gosh, technical accuracy to 3 meters...!"

Agreed! But for the few who truly are humbled by the sight of petrels,
albatross, the first sea spout, flying fish jumping on deck, a bunch
of spinner dolphins 20' away or my all time favorite. Sailing in total
darkness with two dolphins riding the bow wake. The bioluminescence
lighting up the dolphin. Stardust streaming off every fin leaving a
trail of sparkles in their wake. My guess is that sort of stuff is
rather boring to the Dreamers.

Yes, if the reported weather gave them such a problem it is obvious
they needed more training/experience.

Ive read a few plane analogies. If I had soloed a Cessna 150 with 25
logged hours and then bought a Boeing 707 to fly around the world I
think most people would think I'm going to kill myself.

Excellent obervations Fogwatch.

Eeeks! I did not know this. This explains what happened! Never wnat to
dishonor Neptunus Rex.... Silly mortals.
Did Skip remove every reference to the past name? Old logs, a slip of
paper with the old name. I know how Skip douments things. Did he make
the fatal mistake having a before and after picture on board????? A
photo on his laptop with the old name?

I have a violent objection (myself) to talking about "DREAMS"  Dreams
are pie in the sky and impractical.  If all you do is dream, you
deserve to have your dream broken (IMHO).  I don't want to just dream
about something.  I want a plan (and I don't mean a schedule).

There are some places where dreams are appropriate.  Inventors,
composers writers and artists need to dream.  Possibly also
entrepreneurs.  Not pilots, or sailors.

I think S&amp;L had a plan.  The fact that there was a schedule associated
with it was an unfortunate element in the plan, but at least they were
thinking about how to accomplish what they wanted.

Frogwatch ,, you have posted some very good comments over the last week.
Some very honest postings;  tough to read sometimes.

Just about everyone, me included, has been a victim of Cruising World
Syndrome.  The pictures of beautiful boats, beautiful people, beautiful
islands, the ocean is always just right, the weather is just right, the
personal stories are of couples who love the boat, the sea, the islands, the
sailing ...............................

And then reality;  the weather sucks, the marina's are ripping you off, the
local coastal governments are corrupt and taxing you to death,
......................

And so you get fed up.  Is this worth it?  ...

But, some of us keep doing it, over and over again.  I have been addicted to
this pain since 1978.  No detox clinic.  Betty Ford?  Does she sail?  When I
can't take it, I am so nuts I am talking to myself,,,  the mailman shows up
with my latest edition of "DIY Boat Owner Magazine".. or "Good Old Boat".
So, I start reading ... and reading ... and reading ...  if I do this, and I
get that ,, and then I will do this ,, and I can fix that ...

Ahhhhhh ,,,  another fix.

Last summer, for the first time, I started sailing alone.  Not by design.  I
could not find a crew.  Now this really brings out the disease.  Try to dock
the boat.  Or go and get gas.  The kid at the gas dock doesn't give a shit
about the gelcoat.

Ahhhhhh ,,, another fix;  my copy of "How to Refinish your Hull" by Don
Casey has just arrived.

And so along with lots of other addicted people, just like Skip and Lydia ,,
we go on.  We make one big mistake after another.  We run aground, we get
lost, there is frustration.  But, we are sailors!  And that is a whole lot
better than sitting on your ass watching the grass grow.

I'd rather die out on the ocean, trying to keep my boat afloat, than in some
stinkin hole with nothing to talk about but the beautiful lawn.

F  ... that.

Sure there are folks who buy the boat and don't leave the dock.  Sure there
are rich assholes who sit on the boat and drink gallons of alcohol.  But
,,,, there are a few ,, just a few ,, who actually go forth and really screw
up.  Yes!

Speaking of dreams ...  the mailman just brought me Bruce Bingham's new
book.  I wonder if my cat will go sailing with me?  Huummm

Got to go .. another fix ................. Ahhhhhhhhh

Meow.

Hey Rosalie ,, BBB ...  boat .

You got me thinking ???  There should be a reality tv show called "Cruising
Dreams".  Get a very disfunctional couple.  A few very weird friends, an old
sailboat, have the wicked marina owner, the dock kid with the beautiful body
who is doing the rich lady on the big cruiser ,,

This could be hilarious.

My agent;  R Long of the Titanic movie series ...  Roger ???  Are you out
there?  You are the MAN!  Get this going.

The show ::  opening scene:    Roger standing off to the side speaks into
camera;

There is Tom.  He is beyond help.  What a dope.  Lets take a closer look....

And then the show will start with me messing up my boat.

This is going to be bigger than Ozzy .. no, not that Ozzy .. Ozzy and
Harriet.

HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD

Hooray for Hollywood
That screwy, ballyhooey Hollywood!
Where any office boy
Or young mechanic
can be a panic
With just a good-looking pan (pan=face)
And any barmaid
Can be a star maid
If she dances with or without a fan (reference: Sally Rand*)
Hooray for Hollywood!
Where you're terrific
if you're even good!
Where anyone at all from Shirley Temple (child actress)
to Aimee Semple (Aimee Semple McPherson - evangelist)
is equally understood
Come on and try your luck
You could be Donald Duck
Hooray for Hollywood!

Somebody ought to write a book, fictional, about cruising but based on
reality.  It should have an adventure story, a love story and should
feature long distance cruisers discussing their concerns, how they do
it, etc.  I dont want to see another "My Familes Life At Sea"
nonfiction book; I hate that genre.

The first time we went very far offshore, we
crossed to Bimini from Fort Lauderdale in a
chartered Beneteau 51 with a hired captain.  The
forecast was for 18 to 22 kts of wind with 6-8' seas.

When we left it was blowing 15-18Kts with 3-5's,
but six hours in we had 28 to 32Kts showing on the
instruments, and seas that were in the 8-12'
range.  It was a very wet ride, eye opening, but
never dangerous--although the green water over the
deck revealed the leaking hatches in the v-berth
and wet down some of our clothes.  We motor sailed
the whole way with about 9kts showing on the speed
log.

As a result of that trip, we both had our eyes
corrected with LASIK, because eyeglasses are
completely unusable in those conditions--something
we would not have thought of.

The next day we met a few cruisers that were holed
up behind Gun Caye waiting for a weather window to
cross, and they were surprised that we had crossed
at the time we did.  Of course, when you are
chartering, you do not get to wait for a weather
window.  You either go, or don't go.

We learned that my wife can sleep through
anything, and doesn't get seasick easily.  I on
the other hand barely made it through six hours of
8-12's without feeding the fish.

One of my uncles sailed with a couple from San
Diego to Papeete, French Polynesia by way of the
Marquesa's.  The couple had a lot sailing
experience, but had never been offshore, and they
were planning on doing the Pacific loop, and maybe
continuing on around the world.

Somewhere out there they caught a squall with the
spinnaker up, knocked down the boat, apparently
let fly and doused simultaneously, and ended up
with a sheet wrapped around the prop, and the
spinnaker wrapped under the keel, with no sail up
to keep making way.  There was some screaming
involved, and by the time they made Papeete, the
dream was dead.

For me it is a big part of the "dream".  That and
all the stars and the milkyway on a clear night at
sea, and the excitement of a landfall someplace

Well, we own a 27' and a 38' sailboat right now,
and the one thing we are for sure getting good at
is fixing up sailboats (sigh).

&gt;&gt;You got me thinking ???  There should be a reality tv show called &quot;Cruising

That's a classic.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Skip and Lydia got beat up pretty bad and I hope it doesnt ruin their
&gt;&gt;&gt; dream.

&gt;&gt; This fact speaks loudly. The weather by S&amp;L's account was 25 knots
&gt;&gt; with 6-8' waves. Regardless of wave frequency or if 30 K and 10'
&gt;&gt; waves. And yes I have worked the GOM. Those conditions are an
&gt;&gt; excellent day in most waters. And for a 46' boat !?!?!?

&gt; The first time we went very far offshore, we crossed to Bimini from Fort
&gt; Lauderdale in a chartered Beneteau 51 with a hired captain.  The
&gt; forecast was for 18 to 22 kts of wind with 6-8' seas.

&gt; When we left it was blowing 15-18Kts with 3-5's, but six hours in we had
&gt; 28 to 32Kts showing on the instruments, and seas that were in the 8-12'
&gt; range.  It was a very wet ride, eye opening, but never
&gt; dangerous--although the green water over the deck revealed the leaking
&gt; hatches in the v-berth and wet down some of our clothes.  We motor
&gt; sailed the whole way with about 9kts showing on the speed log.

&gt; As a result of that trip, we both had our eyes corrected with LASIK,
&gt; because eyeglasses are completely unusable in those
&gt; conditions--something we would not have thought of.

&gt; The next day we met a few cruisers that were holed up behind Gun Caye
&gt; waiting for a weather window to cross, and they were surprised that we
&gt; had crossed at the time we did.  Of course, when you are chartering, you
&gt; do not get to wait for a weather window.  You either go, or don't go.

&gt; We learned that my wife can sleep through anything, and doesn't get
&gt; seasick easily.  I on the other hand barely made it through six hours of
&gt; 8-12's without feeding the fish.

&gt;&gt; I have met four couples in the last 6 years who fit this pattern. Most
&gt;&gt; recently in a little harbor called Winchester Bay, OR. The couple
&gt;&gt; worked in finance, bought a never sailed 42' something. It was so
&gt;&gt; shinny bright white I had to wear shades. She drank wine, he worked
&gt;&gt; busily adding do-dads. After 1+ years getting ready for their &quot;Dream&quot;
&gt;&gt; the two headed out over the bar. They got about 3 miles off shore, got
&gt;&gt; knocked around, the alternator light went on and they returned to
&gt;&gt; port. The boat has not left the slip since. That was three years ago.

&gt; One of my uncles sailed with a couple from San Diego to Papeete, French
&gt; Polynesia by way of the Marquesa's.  The couple had a lot sailing
&gt; experience, but had never been offshore, and they were planning on doing
&gt; the Pacific loop, and maybe continuing on around the world.

&gt; Somewhere out there they caught a squall with the spinnaker up, knocked
&gt; down the boat, apparently let fly and doused simultaneously, and ended
&gt; up with a sheet wrapped around the prop, and the spinnaker wrapped under
&gt; the keel, with no sail up to keep making way.  There was some screaming
&gt; involved, and by the time they made Papeete, the dream was dead.

&gt;&gt; The one common word I hear in every case
&gt;&gt; is.................................. DREAM. For some reason people
&gt;&gt; have lives they want to escape and sail away to paradise.

&gt;&gt; Agreed! But for the few who truly are humbled by the sight of petrels,
&gt;&gt; albatross, the first sea spout, flying fish jumping on deck, a bunch
&gt;&gt; of spinner dolphins 20' away or my all time favorite. Sailing in total
&gt;&gt; darkness with two dolphins riding the bow wake. The bioluminescence
&gt;&gt; lighting up the dolphin. Stardust streaming off every fin leaving a
&gt;&gt; trail of sparkles in their wake. My guess is that sort of stuff is
&gt;&gt; rather boring to the Dreamers.

&gt; For me it is a big part of the &quot;dream&quot;.  That and all the stars and the
&gt; milkyway on a clear night at sea, and the excitement of a landfall
&gt; someplace you have never been.  It is also being someplace interesting
&gt; and not having to leave in two weeks to get back to the job when the
&gt; vacation is over.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How to keep it from happening?  Dont defer sailing while you build.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Keep your small boat and sail and cruise regularly.  I think Skip and

As I recall, one of the last things Skip and Lydia did was to get rid of
a plethora of small boats. I only remember powerboats, but they might
have had a sailboat or two in the mix.

I agree with Rosalie: theirs was a plan, not just a dream.
