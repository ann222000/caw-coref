Come in, Sit down

Come in, Sit down
Unburden your heart
You'll laugh, you'll cry
You'll make a clean start.

Just listen and learn
From those with advice,
Maybe something you hear
Might just save your life.

They are willing to share

Are the badges they wear.

With hope for the future,
And Just for Today,

Responsibility

&quot;A lot happens in one day, both negative and positive. If we do
not take the time to appreciate both, perhaps we will miss
something that will help us grow.&quot;         IP No.8, &quot;Just For Today&quot;

Responsibility, responsibility-the responsibilities of life are
everywhere. We're &quot;supposed to&quot; wear seat belts. We're
&quot;supposed to&quot; clean our homes. We're &quot;supposed to&quot; do
certain things for our spouse, our children, the people we
sponsor. On top of all this, we're &quot;supposed to&quot; go to
meetings and practice our program as best we can. It's no
wonder that, sometimes, we want to run from all these tasks
and escape to some far-off island where we're not &quot;supposed
to&quot; do anything!

At times like these, when we've become overwhelmed with our
responsibilities, we have forgotten that responsibility need not
be burdensome. When we have a desire to run away from our
responsibilities we need to slow down, remember why we have
chosen them, and pay attention to the gifts they bring. Whether
it's a job we normally find challenging and interesting, or a
partner whose personality we are usually excited by, or a child
whom we naturally like to play with and care for, there is joy
to be found in all the responsibilities of our lives.

Just for today: Each moment is special. I will pay attention, grateful
for my responsibilities and the special joys they bring.

Since recovery from alcoholism is life itself to us, it is imperative
that we preserve in full strength our means of survival.
TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 177

The honesty expressed by the members of A.A. in meetings has
the power to open my mind. Nothing can block the flow of energy
that honesty carries with it.  The only obstacle to this flow of
energy is inebriation, but even then, no one will find a closed door
if he or she has left and chooses to return.  Once he or she has
received the gift of sobriety, each A.A. member is challenged
on a daily basis to accept a program of honesty.

My Higher Power created me for a purpose in life.  I ask him to
accept my honest efforts to continue on my journey in the spiritual
way of life.  I call on Him for strength to know and seek His will.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day by Hazelden / November 26th

A.A. Thought for the Day

Continuing our thoughts about the rewards that have
come to us as a result of our new way of living, we have
found that we have gotten rid of any of our fears,
resentments, inferiority complexes, negative points
of view, self-centeredness, criticism of others, over
sensitiveness, inner conflicts, the habits of procrastination,
undisciplined sex, wasting money, boredom, false
perfectionism, jealousy, and envy of others.  We are glad
to be rid of our drinking, and we are also very glad to be
rid of these other things.  We can now go forward in the
new way of life, as shown us by A.A.  Am I ready to go
forward in the new life?

Meditation for the Day

&quot;He that has eyes to see, let him see.&quot;  To the Seeing Eye,
the world is good.  Pray for a Seeing Eye, to see the purpose
of God in everything good.  Pray for enough faith to see
God's care in His dealings with you.  Try to see how He has
brought you safely through your past life so that now you
can be of use in the world.  With the eyes of faith you can
see God's care and purpose everywhere.

Prayer for the Day

I pray that I may have a Seeing Eye.  I pray that with the
eye of faith I may see God's purpose everywhere.

Today's Thought
NOVEMBER 26

You are reading from the book The Language of Letting Go.
Melody Beattie ©

Letting Go of Self Criticism

Look how far we've come!

It's good to focus on the task ahead, on what remains to be
done. It's important to stop and feel pleased about what we've
accomplished too.

Yes, it may seem that the change has been slow. At times,
change is grueling. Yes, we've taken steps backward. But
we're right  where we're supposed to be. We're right where we
need to be.

And we have come so far.

Sometimes by leaps, sometimes with tiny steps, sometimes
kicking and screaming all the while, sometimes with sleeves rolled
up and white knuckles, we've learned. Grown. Changed.

Look how far we've come.

Today, I will appreciate my progress. I will let myself feel good
about what has been accomplished.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Keep It Simple*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Bigger Than Hope

Last summer I set out with a group of friends on a sailboat
excursion to camp on the mystical island of Molokai. En route
we met a tropical storm during which we treaded water for an
hour amidst imposing swells. Quite a few of our retinue made
pilgrimages to the rail, and by the time the squall abated and
we reached shore, numerous would-be sailors had waxed
green-faced and swore to take a plane next time.

Fortunately, the weather improved and we went on to enjoy
a magnificent sojourn on the exotic isle. As we prepared to
leave the next day, several people were anxious about the
prospect of hitting bad weather again. Someone suggested
we gather for a group prayer for easy passage, and I spoke
a strong affirmation that peace was indeed with us. Together
we visualized a smooth, easy, and delightful trip, and we
came into the vibration of positive expectation until the anxiety
had lifted.

As soon as we opened our eyes, a young man in our midst,
new to the spiritual path, blurted out, &quot;Yeah, and let's hope
we don't hit any more storms!&quot; His statement crashed
awkwardly against the vision we had just co-created.

Afterward I took the fellow aside and explained to him an
important principle:

Once we have prayed for something, we must step fully into
the new vibration and not go backward into thoughts, words,
or actions that affirm the condition we were praying to heal.
We are always affirming what we want or what we don't want,
and everything we think, say, or do is directing our energy in
one direction or another.

When I was studying with master healer Hilda Charlton, during
a class we prayed for a woman named Loni who was seeking
to be healed of a particular disease. After the prayer session
a man approached Loni and suggested she try a certain herbal
treatment. At the following week's class Hilda passionately
admonished the fellow and the group: &quot;How dare you undo
the healing work we did! We spent a long time and a lot of
energy bringing this woman into the consciousness of
wholeness, and you speak to her as if she needs help! If she
is not sick, as we declared her to be, why would you tell her
what to do to erase her illness? Don't you ever do this again!&quot;

Hilda was not against medicine (on many occasions she
recommended that students take it), and she was extremely
compassionate with people who were suffering. That night
Hilda was using the incident to underscore an important point,
one which has stayed with me and helped me immensely over
many years: To be an effective healer, speak to the place in
your client that is whole, and treat each person as if they are
already who they would like to be. As Dale Carnegie
advised, &quot;Give them a reputation to live up to.&quot;

In the famous biblical story, God advised Lot and his family to
leave Sodom because the city was about to be destroyed; God
told the family to leave quickly and not look back. On their road
to freedom, Lot's wife turned to see what was happening back
there, and she turned into a pillar of salt. Certainly this did not
happen physically—the story is a metaphor, a grand piece of
advice for all times: Don't get involved with what you are leaving
behind. Your past may be loaded with pain, suffering, and
difficulty, but you are trying to build a new life. Leave the past
where it was, and turn your attention fully toward where you
are going. Jesus advised simply, &quot;Turn the other cheek.&quot;

This is the time of rebirth, signified in the legends of our major
religions. In Judaism we commemorate Passover, representing
the ascension from slavery to freedom. In Christianity we
celebrate the resurrection of Christ. We have paid far too much
attention to scenes of slavery and crucifixion; we have played
them out time and again. Now it is time for us to focus on what
happens next. The more we delve into how we got where we
are, the more we stay where we were. The more we analyze
what is not working, the more things do not work. And the more
we consider how we would like it to be, the more things become,
as we would have them. The choice is ours.

Real spirituality is beyond hope. Hope means there is a chance
things may turn out as we wish, and if we are lucky we may get
what we want. Inner knowing, on the other hand, proceeds from
the awareness that love is present now, well-being is our natural
state, and all is really well.

Yes, we may have hit a storm on way over, but that does not
mean we have to hit one on the way back. Our history is not
our destiny, and our destiny begins now.

Recipe
(from an article by Emmet Fox)

Here is a great recipe, suitable for any occasion . . .

If you were to make a cake, you know that whatever you put into
your mixing bowl will appear in the cake itself, and, if you leave
out a specific ingredient, it will not appear in the finished product.

The thoughts and beliefs that we choose to fill our minds
ultimately will appear in our experience, and if we realize this,
we can save ourselves a lot of trouble.  No one would put the
wrong ingredient in the mixing bowl because no one wants it
in the cake, for everyone knows that, if it's in the bowl, it's in
the cake!

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Easy Does It*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Gratitude Is....

by Julie Jordan Scott

Gratitude is owned by everyone and no
one. Gratitude is in cities, in the country, in houses
of worship, in darkened allies, in caves, in homes
and in tiny apartments.  Gratitude grows the more
you tap into it through acknowledgment, sharing
and awareness.  Gratitude is available to each of
us at anytime.

Gratitude is a positive virus.  Gratitude
energy can be passed simply, effortlessly and
freely from one person to another to another to
another.

Gratitude is a choice. We choose whether we
want to embrace its transformative energy. Gratitude
has no opinion, it simply blesses those who are
open. Choose Gratitude.

Gratitude changes lives and is the doorway to the
manifestation of miracles.  Through consciousness
and acknowledgment, it allows more wonder, more
glory, more celebration to flow.

Gratitude awakens the soul to an exponential
increase in every area: spiritual, physical, relational,
emotional. This awakening moves beyond the
intellect, it moves beyond the usual and into the
spaces we sometimes forget to treasure.

Gratitude is fuel for the creative fire and reminds
artists of all sorts that anything is truly possible.
Gratitude sings, it paints, it sculpts, it flies.  It
speaks through us to others and lays the foundation
for a more empowered future.

Gratitude bridges areas of weakness because
it is through acknowledging our weaknesses we
are able to partner with others - including divine
forces -  and transmute what we previously saw
as weaknesses into strengths.  Perhaps these
weaknesses are turned into strengths of an
entirely different kind.

Gratitude always finds a way if and when we
are open to it.  It flows like an river, following an
ancient, pre-determined path.  The moment we
join that flow, magic begins to happen - perhaps
in small, insignificant ways at first - and we quickly
learn that there are no small, insignificant ways.
They are all magnificent beyond measure.

Gratitude is visible on people's faces - it brings
an instant face lift, a needle free form of the wrinkle
eliminating Botox.  Gratitude replenishes and
refreshes us when we are weary, it quenches
our energetic thirst like a perfect spring of water.

Gratitude is in nature, it is in people.  Gratitude
gives us more courage, it grants wishes, it is
supremely engaging and fulfilling.  Gratitude
purely and simply is.

Blessed Today

In this day I shall rejoice
Because now I have a choice
My God has saved me
Now I can see
I've been blessed from day to day
Now it's time to share my way
I'll greet the new comer at the door
Offer my them hope
And so much more
Take the pigeon under my wing
Give my time so he can sing
I can only offer my hand
Share my experience and understand
But I can't keep no one sober
That's up to God above
I can show them how I did it
Teach them to surrender
Tell them to give it to God above
All I can do is share the love
That was given to me long ago
Teach them right
So that they'll know
Within our room we have hope
Show them just how we cope

Courage is reclaiming your life after a devastating event
