Education

Virtually the entire Danish adult population is literate. Primary,
secondary, and, on the whole, university and other higher education are
free. Preschools are operated by private persons or organizations with some
government financial aid. An estimated 13.1% of the central government
budget was allocated to education in the latter half of the 1990s. As of
1999, public expenditure on education was estimated at 8.2% of GDP.

Education has been compulsory since 1814; currently, it is compulsory for
children ages 7 to 16. ...
http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Denmark-EDUCATION.html

In Denmark, education is compulsory for nine years from the age of 7 (6) to
16 (15).

The public system

The public municipal school, the Folkeskole, is a comprehensive school in
the sense that it includes both primary and lower secondary education, and
that there is limited streaming. The Folkeskole is free of charge.

Approximately 88% of a year group attend public schools. Apart from the
compulsory forms 1 to 9, the Folkeskole comprises a voluntary pre-school
year and an optional 10th year. Approximately 98% of all children attend the
pre-school year, and approximately 63% attend the 10th year (2001).

The average class size is 20 (2002). School usually starts at 8 a.m. The
younger pupils finish at around noon and older pupils finish around 2 or 3
p.m. Pupils can spend their leisure time in municipal school care
(Skolefritidsordning, SFO).

Lab creates 'long-distance mouse'

[_44214473_mice_cwru_416.jpg]
The modified mice: They were also found to be aggressive

[WATCH]
'Supermouse' goes head-to-head with normal mouse

A genetically modified &quot;supermouse&quot; which can run twice as far as a normal
rodent has been created by scientists working in the US.

It also lives longer, and breeds later in life compared with its standard
laboratory cousin.

The research has been conducted at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, Ohio.

Details of the scientists' new transgenic animals are published in the
Journal of Biological Chemistry.

The mice were produced to study the biochemistry at play in metabolism and
could aid the understanding of human health and disease.

The GM rodents can run five to six kilometres at a speed of 20 meters per
minute on a treadmill, for up to six hours before stopping.

The performance was tested on rodent treadmills

&quot;They are metabolically similar to Lance Armstrong biking up the Pyrenees;
they utilise mainly fatty acids for energy and produce very little lactic
acid,&quot; said Professor Richard Hanson, the senior author on the journal
article.

He told BBC News: &quot;The muscles of these mice have many more mitochondria.
These are the little 'engines' in the cell that produce energy. For some
reason, the number of mitochondria are around 10 times more than we see in
the muscle of their littermates.&quot;

The mice over-express a gene responsible for the enzyme phosphoenolypyruvate
carboxykinases (PEPCK-C). Normal expression is in the liver, in the
production of glucose.

The scientists found their new mice would eat twice as much as normal mice -
but weigh half as much. They could also give birth at three years old -
which in human terms is akin to an 80-year-old woman giving birth.

The research is featured in the Journal of Biological Chemistry

Other research groups have produced similar novel rodents by altering
different aspects of their genetics. One criticism of the work is that it
could open the door to abuse, with the spectre of athletes resorting to gene
therapy to try to improve their performance.

But Professor Hanson played this down. &quot;Right now, this is impossible to
do - putting a gene into muscle. It's unethical. And I don't think you'd
want to do this. These animals are rather aggressive, we've noticed.&quot;

Scientists say such work is more likely to help them understand human
conditions, such as those which lead to wasting of the muscles.

167 And the common man and woman is not guiltless before me in these things,
saith the Lord, for in their sloth they have allowed themselves to be
deceived, even in these things and by false religions.

The mouse that shook the world

It can run for hours at 20 metres per minute without getting tired. It lives
longer, has more sex, and eats more without gaining weight. Could the
science that created this supermouse be applied to humans?

By Steve Connor, Science Editor
Published: 02 November 2007

Scientists have been astounded by the creation of a genetically modified
&quot;supermouse&quot; with extraordinary physical abilities – comparable to the
performance of the very best athletes – raising the prospect that the
discovery may one day be used to transform people's capacities.

The mouse can run up to six kilometres (3.7 miles) at a speed of 20 metres
per minute for five hours or more without stopping. Scientists said that
this was equivalent of a man cycling at speed up an Alpine mountain without
a break. Although it eats up to 60 per cent more food than an ordinary
mouse, the modified mouse does not put on weight. It also lives longer and
enjoys an active sex life well into old age – being capable of breeding at
three times the normal maximum age.

American scientists who created the mice – they now have a breeding colony
of 500 – said that they were stunned by their abilities, especially given
that the animals came about as a result of a standard genetic modification
to a single metabolism gene shared with humans.

They emphasised that the aim of the research was not to prepare the way to
enhance the genes of people. However, they accepted that it may be possible
to use the findings to develop new drugs or treatments that could one day be
used to &quot;enhance&quot; the natural abilities of athletes.

The professor of biochemistry at Case Western Reserve University at
Cleveland in Ohio, Richard Hanson, said that the physical performance of the
supermouse can only be compared to supremely fit athletes like the cyclist
Lance Armstrong, who won the Tour de France seven consecutive times from
1999 to 2005. The genetic alteration to a gene involved in glucose
metabolism appears to stimulate the efficient use of body fat for energy
production. At the same time, the mice do not suffer from a build up of
lactic acid – which causes muscle cramps – a feature also seen in the best
endurance athletes.

Professor Hanson said yesterday: &quot;They are metabolically similar to Lance
Armstrong biking up the Pyrenees. They utilise mainly fatty acids for energy
and produce very little lactic acid. They are not eating or drinking and yet
they can run for four or five hours. They are 10 times more active than
ordinary mice in their home cage. They also live longer – up to three years
of age – and are reproductively active for almost three years. In short,
they are remarkable animals.

&quot;On the downside, they eat twice as much as control mice, but they are half
the weight, and are very aggressive. Why this is the case, we are not really
sure.&quot;

Professor Hanson, who led the 15-strong team of researchers, said that the
first supermouse was created about four years ago by injecting a highly
active form of a gene for an enzyme called phosphonenolpyruvate
carboxykinase (PEPCK-C) into a mouse embryo. The results of studies on the
mice are published for the first time today in the Journal of Biological
Chemistry.

Professor Hanson said: &quot;We humans have exactly the same gene. But this is
not something that you'd do to a human. It's completely wrong. We do not
think that this mouse model is an appropriate model for human gene therapy.
It is currently not possible to introduce genes into the skeletal muscles of
humans and it would not be ethical to even try.&quot;

However, it may be possible for pharmaceutical companies to use the findings
to develop new drugs that enhance muscle performance, which may benefit
certain patients. Professor Hanson accepted that it was possible athletes
might misuse any future drug developed in this way.

He said: &quot;It's very possible. It's a different approach to putting a gene
into a human. I would only do that to help anyone who suffers from disorders
such as cystic fibrosis.&quot;

The aim of the research was to gain a greater understanding of the PEPCK-C
enzyme, which is present mainly in the liver and kidneys. As a result of the
genetic modification, the mighty mice have up to 100 times the concentration
of the enzyme in its muscles compared with ordinary mice.

Professor Hanson said: &quot;The purpose of our experiment was to study energy
metabolism in the mice and the role that a single, metabolically important
enzyme might play in a tissue in which it is not normally expressed at high
levels.&quot;

He said that the physical and behavioural changes in the modified mice were
completely unexpected. Usually, scientists have to carry out blood tests to
see if there has been any effect of altering the genes, but these mice were
noticeably different at a very early age.

He said: &quot;We could spot them at just a few weeks after birth. They popped
around the cage like popcorn. We found that they were about 10 times as
active as ordinary mice.&quot;

Further research on the mice could shed light on the link between
high-calorie diets and cancer, and low-calorie diets and longevity. He said:
&quot;Our animals live longer and eat almost twice as much as ordinary mice –
this is a model to study.&quot;

A risky business: previous attempts at genetic modification

Genetic modification is a 30-year-old technology that has been used
extensively on a range of animals for basic research and the production of
agricultural or pharmaceutical products. It involves inserting an extra gene
or modifying the expression of an existing gene within the DNA of the
animal. Famous examples of GM animals include:
...

Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my
soul for that!&quot;

Yea, the Spirit of the Lord beareth record (at 6:11 am, November 3, 2007) of
the above word of Christ received by His Apostle, Joseph Smith.

1 THE vision of Obadiah.

Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the
LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise
up against her in battle.

2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly
despised.

3 ¶ The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the
clefts of the rock, whose habitation [is] high; that saith in his heart, Who
shall bring me down to the ground?

4 Though thou exalt [thyself] as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest
among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.

5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!)
would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came
to thee, would they not leave [some] grapes?

6 How are [the things] of Esau searched out! [how] are his hidden things
sought up!

7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee [even] to the border: the
men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, [and] prevailed against
thee; [they that eat] thy bread have laid a wound under thee: [there is]
none understanding in him.

8 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise [men] out
of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

9 And thy mighty [men], O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every
one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.

10 ¶ For [thy] violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee,
and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

11 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the
strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his
gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou [wast] as one of them.

12 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day
that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the
children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou
have spoken proudly in the day of distress.

(Old Testament | Obadiah 1:1 - 12)

1 COME near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth
hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of
it.

2 For the indignation of the LORD [is] upon all nations, and [his] fury upon
all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to
the slaughter.

3 Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of
their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.

4 And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be
rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf
falleth off from the vine, and as a falling [fig] from the fig tree.

5 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon
Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.

6 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness,
[and] with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of
rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the
land of Idumea.

7 And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the
bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat
with fatness.

8 For [it is] the day of the LORD's vengeance, [and] the year of recompences
for the controversy of Zion.

9 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof
into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.

10 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for
ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass
through it for ever and ever.

(Old Testament | Isaiah 34:1 - 10)

31 Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or
shall hearken unto the precepts of men, save their precepts shall be given
by the power of the Holy Ghost.

32 Wo be unto the Gentiles, saith the Lord God of Hosts! For notwithstanding
I shall lengthen out mine arm unto them from day to day, they will deny me;
nevertheless, I will be merciful unto them, saith the Lord God, if they will
repent and come unto me; for mine arm is lengthened out all the day long,
saith the Lord God of Hosts.

Mice genetically engineered at Case Western Reserve are
superathletes -- with attitude

Friday, November 02, 2007

Barb Galbincea
Plain Dealer Reporter

They're lean, mean running machines.

Mighty mice genetically engineered at Case Western Reserve University can
gallop on rodent-sized treadmills for as long as six hours and cover more
than three miles before they're tuckered out.

That's like running a 5K race.

Less genetically gifted mice max out at 0.2 kilometers.

The uber-mice also have voracious appetites but practically no body fat.

And they bite -- a lot.

Richard Hanson, a biochemistry professor at Case, said he and the rest of
the research team weren't aiming to create tiny endurance athletes with
attitude.

The mighty mouse line is actually a serendipitous byproduct of the
researchers' ongoing look at an enzyme involved in producing glucose, or
sugar, as a source of energy in the liver and the kidneys.

Members of the group set out to learn what would happen if they created mice
with exceptionally high activity of the enzyme called phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase - or PEPCK-C for short - in skeletal muscle tissue.

Why the single enzyme so affects the mice is still being studied.

But because of their unusual attributes, the animals will be used as test
subjects in upcoming experiments involving aging and the effect of exercise
in fending off cancer.

A paper describing the PEPCK-C study is to be published Nov. 9 as the cover
article in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.

The enzyme, discovered in 1955 at Case's medical school by Merton Utter, is
not limited to the liver and kidneys.

It is also found in other tissue - within the small intestine, colon and
lungs, for example - where its metabolic role is unclear.

Researchers found that in addition to having the endurance exhibited by the
transgenic mice, the animals also were far more active in their cages, lived
much longer and could breed well into what is generally considered old age
for their kind.

One female mouse reproduced when she was a month shy of 3 years old. Hanson
said that's like an 80-year-old woman giving birth.

The mice also are exceptionally aggressive - so much so that that the lead
researchers sometimes get appeals from behavioral labs that are testing the
animals, asking that they come and retrieve the rowdy rodents.

&quot;It's kind of like that call that every parent dreads from the teacher,&quot;
says Hanson.

Parvin Hakimi, a researcher in Hanson's lab, developed the line of PEPCK-C
mice - now numbering almost 500 - over the last five years.

And from the start, she noticed that the mice were anything but average.

When she lifted the top off their cage, it was like removing the lid from a
popcorn popper, Hakimi said.

Behavioral studies eventually determined that mice from the new line were
about seven times more active than the control group.

Muscle tissue from those put to death also shows significant physiological
differences between the two groups.

In addition, researchers found something they thought was remarkable when
they tested the transgenic mice and the control group on a treadmill set at
a 25-degree incline.

Not only did the genetically enhanced mice run longer, but blood lactate
levels that had been similar to the control group's when the test began,
were significantly lower after the strenuous exercise.

The PEPCK-C mice processed fatty acids as a source of energy, while the
other animals switched to using carbohydrates, elevating their lactate
levels.

That's important because converting fatty acids to energy is much more
productive and efficient, and a buildup of lactic acid can hamper muscle
performance.

Hanson said that makes the PEPCK-C mice metabolic cousins to cycling champ
Lance Armstrong, whose natural ability to use fatty acids for energy and
thus produce little lactic acid has been documented by studies.

But Hanson doesn't envision an overload of PEPCK-C as a possible
performance-enhancer in humans. It's neither feasible nor ethical, he said.

&quot;There's a reason, over all these eons of evolution, that we have the levels
we have,&quot; Hanson said.

He said he doesn't know yet exactly where the research will lead.

After all, Ralph Waldo Emerson once observed that if you build a better
mousetrap, the world will beat a path to your door.

Who knows what happens when you build a better mouse.

Of how we calmed the tides of war.
We are your overlords.

So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite all your losing.

3 ¶ But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the
adulterer and the whore.

4 Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth,
[and] draw out the tongue? [are] ye not children of transgression, a seed of
falsehood,

5 Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the
children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?

6 Among the smooth [stones] of the stream [is] thy portion; they, they [are]
thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a
meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?

7 Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest
thou up to offer sacrifice.

8 Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for
thou hast discovered [thyself to another] than me, and art gone up; thou
hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee [a covenant] with them; thou lovedst
their bed where thou sawest [it].

9 And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy
perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase [thyself
even] unto hell.

10 Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; [yet] saidst thou not,
There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou
wast not grieved.

11 And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and
hast not remembered me, nor laid [it] to thy heart? have not I held my peace
even of old, and thou fearest me not?

12 I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not
profit thee.

13 ¶ When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall
carry them all away; vanity shall take [them]: but he that putteth his trust
in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;

14 And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the
stumblingblock out of the way of my people.

15 For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose
name [is] Holy; I dwell in the high and holy [place], with him also [that
is] of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and
to revive the heart of the contrite ones.

16 For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the
spirit should fail before me, and the souls [which] I have made.

17 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid
me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.

18 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and
restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

19 I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to [him that is] far off,
and to [him that is] near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.

20 But the wicked [are] like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose
waters cast up mire and dirt.

21 [There is] no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

What Exactly Is Halloween?

Billy Cox
...
Following is the third and last article taken from the issue of Florida
Today for 31 October 1994; this one comes from the front page of Section D,
which the newspaper quaintly calls the &quot;People&quot; section.
...
Another theory credits the Druids, a pagan religious order that once
dominated ancient Ireland, Britain and France. This theory traces
jack-o-lantern imagery to the Druid practice of burning human sacrifices
alive inside wicker cages.

Strange things, these Halloween origins. ...

To get a line on trick-or-treating, you have to go back maybe 3,000 years,
to the summer's-end Gaelic festival of Samhain. Samhain marked not only the
end of the pagan harvest, but an official pause to commune with those who
died during the year. Poor folks were given cakes to eat, so long as they
promised to pray for a good harvest the following year.

When the Romans rolled through the present-day British Isles, they looked
with ill humor upon the Druids' religious activities -- blood sacrifice to
purge the sins from the souls of the departed. So the Romans put an end to
bloodletting. Ritual bloodletting, anyway.

But when Rome converted to Christianity, its leaders figured they needed to
accommodate at least a few of the indigenous pagan rites in order to appear
relevant. Thus, in the eighth century, Pope Gregory III proclaimed Nov. 1 as
All Saints' Day, or All-Hallows Day, to honor all the Catholic saints and
martyrs yet to be sanctified. The actual celebration kicked off the evening
before, on &quot;All-HallowsE'en.&quot;

But since All Saints' Day tended to be largely exclusionary, the Church made
a broader concession to pagan tradition in the tenth century by establishing
All-Souls Day on Nov. 2 to honor all those dead souls who weren't lucky
enough to be saints, souls who needed prayers from the living for
purification.

The Church of England eventually banned All-Souls Day, but the tradition
lives on in many parts of the Christian world.

As the centuries passed and the Samhain tradition of sharing the harvest
became more archaic, modern-day trick-or-treating got its first clear
antecedent with a custom called English Plough Day. Now begging for gifts
and food instead of expecting communal handouts, English farmers threatened
to destroy the land with their plows unless they got respect.

So that's where trick-or-treat came from. Sort of, more or less. Unless
you're, say, a Zuni Indian in New Mexico.

The Zunis take All-Souls Day quite seriously by bringing candles and food to
the graves of the dead, but they claim the tradition is aboriginal and
predates Catholic influences. Early, almost as if rising from the loam of
the collective unconscious, Zuni children go door-to-door chanting, &quot;Let's
pray, let's pray, we are little angels, from heaven we come. If you don't
give to us, your doors and windows we will break.&quot;

Naturally, this sort of implicit blackmail (albeit delivered by so-called
little angels), was bound to ignite another sort of uniquely American
Halloween tradition - reactionary sadism from the &quot;treat&quot; end: rumors of
razor-blade apples, strychnine-laced cookies, all that sinister faceless
stuff that has parents bemoaning the breakdown of society.
...
Another Halloween tradition Americanized into grandiose proportions deals
with that Beavis and Butthead favorite -- fire. The Druids originally built
bonfires on Samhain because they were thought to rejuvenate the sun and
banish evil spirits. Lately, in Detroit, Halloween has simply rejuvenated
arsonists: they call it Devil's Night. The trade journal Firefighting has
referred to Devil's Night in the Motor City as &quot;the Super Bowl of
firefighting.&quot;

So that's fire. But where did costumes come from?

Rewind once more to pagan rites in the British Isles. Some historians
contend that, after celebrating, toasting, and feting the dead, villagers
dressed up in colorful attire, formed parades, and led the spirits to the
outskirts of town. After all, the event was also called Mischief Night.
Spirits who didn't leave often wore out their welcome by curdling milk and
riding horses into exhaustion. When Christianity took hold, the villagers
continued to wear costumes, only, they justified their pleasures by
contending they were merely dressing like saints.

Black cats? Broomsticks? Witches?

Several thousand years back, when the Romans were busily eradicating pagan
societies, few distinctions were drawn between the Druids and another
nature-worshipping culture, the witches.

Like the Druids, witches made a big production of Samhain. Unlike the
Druids, according to Palm Bay's Jacque Zaleski, witches never conducted
human or animal sacrifices to their principal deity, the Mother Goddess. But
the Romans weren't all that discriminating in their contempt for paganism,
and the ancient stigma continues to bedevil witches - known formally as
Wiccans - today. Great Britain, for instance, didn't repeal its anti-witch
laws until 1951.

Zaleski is the priestess for a Palm Bay Wiccan coven called Church of the
Iron Oak. Halloween, or Samhain, is still the main event on the Wiccan
calendar. But instead of Druidism, Wicca is often confused with Satan
worship; in fact, Anton LaVey, author of The Satanic Bible, calls Halloween
the most important day of the year for the Church of Satan.

Well, I'm a voodoo chile [child]
Baal, I'm a voodoo chile

Well, the night I was born
Baal, I swear the moon turned a fire red

He took me past to the outskirts of infinity,
And when he brought me back,
He gave me a Venus witch's ring
Hey!

And he said &quot;Fly on, fly on&quot;
Because I'm a voodoo chile, yeah, voodoo chile
Hey!

Say my arrows are made of desire, desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulfur mines
(Way down by the Methane Sea, yeah)
I have a humming bird and it hums so loud,
You think you were losing your mind, hmm

I float in liquid gardens
Way down in Arizona red sand

'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Baal knows I'm a voodoo chile

~~Jimi Hendrix

I been bad, I been good
Dallas, Texas, Hollywood
I ain't askin' for much
Mmm hmm
I said, Baal, take me downtown
I'm just lookin' for some tush

~~ZZ Top

20 [Shall] not the day of the LORD [be] darkness, and not light? even very
dark, and no brightness in it?

23 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the
melody of thy viols.

(Old Testament | Amos 5:20,23)

Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satan's daughter
And it only goes to show --
You know

There's an angel on my shoulder,
In my hand a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love I'll sow --
You know

So the world is spinning faster
Are you dizzy when you're stoned
Let the music be your master
Will you heed the master's call?
Oh, Satan and man

~~Led Zeppelin

Robert Hilburn interviewed Dylan about the new direction in his music for
the Los Angeles Times. Hilburn’s article, published November 23, 1980,
began: “Bob Dylan has finally confirmed in an interview what he’s been
saying in his music for 18 months: He’s a born-again Christian. Dylan said
he accepted Jesus Christ in his heart in 1978 after “a vision and feeling”
during which the room moved: “There was a presence in the room that couldn’t
have been anybody but Jesus.”[106]

Dylan's embrace of Christianity was unpopular with some of his fans and
fellow musicians.[107] Shortly before his December 1980 shooting, John
Lennon recorded &quot;Serve Yourself&quot; in response to Dylan's &quot;Gotta Serve
Somebody&quot;.[108]

11 ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in

the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the
words of the LORD:

12 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the
east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not
find [it].

13 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.

14 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth;
and, The manner of Beer-sheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise
up again.

(Old Testament | Amos 8:11 - 14)

Arctic vault protects the seeds of life

Rick Weiss, Washington
June 20, 2006

THE high-security vault, almost half the length of a football field, will be
carved into a mountain on a remote island above the Arctic Circle.

If the looming fences, motion detectors and steel airlock doors are not
disincentive enough for anyone hoping to breach the facility's concrete
interior, the polar bears roaming outside should help.

More than 100 nations that have endorsed the vault's construction say it
will be the most secure facility of its kind. Given the stakes, nothing less
would do.

Its precious contents? Seeds - millions and millions of them - from
virtually every variety of food on the planet.

Crop seeds are the source of human sustenance, the product of 10,000 years
of selective breeding dating from the dawn of agriculture. The &quot;doomsday
vault&quot;, as some have come to call it, is to be the ultimate back-up in the
event of a global catastrophe - the go-to place after an asteroid hit or
nuclear holocaust so that, difficult as those times would be, humankind
would not have to start again from scratch.

Once just a dream - albeit a dark one - this planetary larder is about to
become a reality. On the barren Norwegian outpost of Svalbard, the prime
ministers of five nations and a small throng of other officials will soon
lay the cornerstone for what will be, in effect, the Fort Knox of seeds.

&quot;We will have the biological foundation for all agriculture, which is really
saying something,&quot; said Cary Fowler, executive secretary of the Global Crop
Diversity Trust, the international organisation co-ordinating the vault's
creation with the Norwegian Government.

If progress continues during the short building season this northern summer
and next, the high-tech cavern will start accepting deposits from smaller
seed banks and agricultural and scientific organisations next year. After
that, with a loud clank and the sound of sucking air, the door will close
and the Svalbard International Seed Vault will slip into a sub-zero
slumber - an insurance policy for human civilisation.

Scientists estimate there are 2 million varieties of plants used for food
and forage today. That includes an astonishing 100,000 varieties of rice,
the staple of the human diet, and more than 1000 varieties of banana. Seeds
from these crops, which can be smaller than poppy seeds and as large as
coconuts, are invaluable repositories of plant DNA. They are the raw
material that farmers and researchers rely on to develop more productive and
nutritious plants that can cope with climate change, new diseases or pests.

Seeds are typically stored at minus 20 degrees, and are periodically removed
and germinated to grow plants, whose fresh seeds are redeposited.

The design bespeaks an Armageddon mentality. There is the location: The
starkly beautiful and always frozen terrain of Svalbard is off the beaten
track. Home to a small community of scientists, coal miners and support
staff, it is the northernmost place in the world with a scheduled commercial
air service. Reindeer and polar bears stroll the streets.

It will be built in solid rock, and its floor, ceiling and walls will be
lined with one-metre-thick layers of concrete. The door will be opened only
once or twice a year, to check contents and add new varieties.

8 Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD [are] upon the sinful kingdom, and I will
destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly
destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.

9 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all
nations, like as [corn] is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain
fall upon the earth.

(Old Testament | Amos 9:8 - 9)

15 For the day of the LORD [is] near upon all the heathen: as thou hast
done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own
head.

16 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, [so] shall all the heathen
drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and
they shall be as though they had not been.

17 ¶ But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness;
and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.

18 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame,
and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour
them; and there shall not be [any] remaining of the house of Esau; for the
LORD hath spoken [it].

21 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and
the kingdom shall be the LORD's.

(Old Testament | Obadiah 1:15 - 18,21)

&quot;The meek shall inherit the earth, but not its mineral rights.&quot;

45 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain
without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay,
the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what
shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream [is] certain, and the
interpretation thereof sure.

(Old Testament | Daniel 2:45)

8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord,
which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.

(New Testament | Revelation 1:8)

8 My name is Jehovah, and I know the end from the beginning; ...
