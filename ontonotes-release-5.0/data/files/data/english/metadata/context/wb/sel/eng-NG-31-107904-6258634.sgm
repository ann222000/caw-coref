Hi.

Here's an argument to debate. Would this stop the peak oil problem, the
global warming problem, and other problems related to use of fossil
energy? A fair market.

"Some say that market forces will take care of the peak oil problem.
They argue that as we approach or pass the peak of production, the
price of oil will increase and alternatives will become more
competitive. Following this, consumers will act to replace our need for
non-petroleum energy resources. This philosophy is partly true.
However, the main problem with this argument is that current U.S. oil
prices do not accurately reflect the full social costs of oil
consumption. Currently, in the United States, federal and state taxes
add up to about 40 cents per gallon of gasoline. A World Resources
Institute analysis found that fuel-related costs not covered by drivers
are at least twice that much. The current price of oil does not include
the full cost of road maintenance, health and environmental costs
attributed to air pollution, the financial risks of global warming from
increasing carbon dioxide emissions or the threats to national security
from importing oil. Because the price of oil is artificially low,
significant private investment in alternative technologies that provide
a long-term payback does not exist. _Until oil and its alternatives
compete in a FAIR MARKET, new technologies will not thrive._"
Rep. Tom Udall

So that is what we need. A FAIR MARKET. That's something that if we
could do it would guarantee that the new technologies could be
developed to be as cheap and easy as oil if not cheaper. Bam. Energy
problem solved. Guaranteed near 100%. But how to get a fair market?

Just something I was curious about...

I solved the peak oil problem years ago.  To entice (not force)
americans into small cars we should hand out moving violation fines
that vary with the listed weight of the vehicle.  Of course this makes
sense from a safety standpoint too but its also  a way to encourage the
idiot american to buy smaller vehicles. And, even more obviously, we
should lower speed limits to 55 or even lower.

To encourage people to own smaller homes we need a law that says the
maximum any private home can be insured for is $500,000.

Hey, shitferbrains, did you know that an acre of land in my area is
worth over a million dollars without anything built on it?  How's that
figure into your calculations?  And while you babble on about smaller
this and that, did it ever occur to you that size and efficiency are two
different things?  Someone could have a large house with good insulation
and energy saving appliances and use less energy than a smaller house
with no special features.  I think my electric bill last month was under
$20, although admittedly the heat is gas and isn't cheap these days
(really need to get some insulation on the second floor.)

Dummy, the only way to guarantee it is to do it yourself.

Waiting for someone else to do it is how you get dragged kicking and
screaming into Mesopotamia to tame the savage breast.

Besides, it ain't the "fair" market, my little Monkey Friend.

What you seem to be advocating is a /free/ market.

There ain't no secha thing as a "fair" market. But socialists keep

&gt;&gt;&gt;consumption. Currently, in the United States, federal and state taxes
&gt;&gt;&gt;add up to about 40 cents per gallon of gasoline. A World Resources
&gt;&gt;&gt;Institute analysis found that fuel-related costs not covered by drivers
&gt;&gt;&gt;are at least twice that much. The current price of oil does not include
&gt;&gt;&gt;the full cost of road maintenance, health and environmental costs
&gt;&gt;&gt;attributed to air pollution, the financial risks of global warming from
&gt;&gt;&gt;increasing carbon dioxide emissions or the threats to national security
&gt;&gt;&gt;from importing oil. Because the price of oil is artificially low,
&gt;&gt;&gt;significant private investment in alternative technologies that provide
&gt;&gt;&gt;a long-term payback does not exist. _Until oil and its alternatives
&gt;&gt;&gt;compete in a FAIR MARKET, new technologies will not thrive._&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Rep. Tom Udall

&gt;&gt;&gt;So that is what we need. A FAIR MARKET. That's something that if we
&gt;&gt;&gt;could do it would guarantee that the new technologies could be
&gt;&gt;&gt;developed to be as cheap and easy as oil if not cheaper. Bam. Energy
&gt;&gt;&gt;problem solved. Guaranteed near 100%. But how to get a fair market?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just something I was curious about...

&gt;&gt; I solved the peak oil problem years ago.  To entice (not force)
&gt;&gt; americans into small cars we should hand out moving violation fines
&gt;&gt; that vary with the listed weight of the vehicle.  Of course this makes
&gt;&gt; sense from a safety standpoint too but its also  a way to encourage the
&gt;&gt; idiot american to buy smaller vehicles. And, even more obviously, we
&gt;&gt; should lower speed limits to 55 or even lower.

&gt;&gt; To encourage people to own smaller homes we need a law that says the
&gt;&gt; maximum any private home can be insured for is $500,000.

&gt; Hey, shitferbrains, did you know that an acre of land in my area is worth
&gt; over a million dollars without anything built on it?  How's that figure
&gt; into your calculations?  And while you babble on about smaller this and
&gt; that, did it ever occur to you that size and efficiency are two different
&gt; things?  Someone could have a large house with good insulation and energy
&gt; saving appliances and use less energy than a smaller house with no special
&gt; features.  I think my electric bill last month was under $20, although
&gt; admittedly the heat is gas and isn't cheap these days (really need to get
&gt; some insulation on the second floor.)
">

Under $20, huh?
Hey, want to buy a bridge in Alaska?

The free market seems to be a bad idea, it doesn't really work.
There has to be some way though, some system that nobody
has yet thought of. We have to stop thinking there are only a
few possible solutions when in reality the amount of different
approaches is myriad and the way to truly solve the problem
is probably well outside of our normal political spectrum (think
in color).

The idea I brought up was only one possibility, maybe it does
not work, as like I said there are so many approaches. I hope
people will think about all these approaches, many
undiscovered, and perhaps find one that WILL work. I know
we can solve these problems. But what do we want to do
to do it?

don't tell me that, because the bank actually owns most of it although

In all seriousness though, the land that I "own" is worth more than the
house and garage combined, according to the assessment.  Everything
could burn to the ground and I'd only be out maybe $150K or so.  Not
that that isn't quite a few times my life's savings, but still, it kind

Not too likely.  I'm hoping for $5-6 per gallon.  At that point even
many Americans would conserve a bit.  However, you would see changes.
More things would be done locally.  Your lettuce might be grown
somewhere besides Yuma AZ.  We have an economy that is highly
specialized, and requires huge amounts of energy to transport things
from one concentrated source to a dispersed market.

As fuel went up, you'd see changes in the way things are done.  Right
now we waste the fuel because it's so dang cheap.  If world fuel prices
went up, the idea of shipping things to/from China for cheap labor
would fizzle.

If things get bad, you won't see kiwi fruits from New Zealand in your
local market much, if at all.  But you would see many small, local
dairies for instance.  If things got REALLY bad, you'd have your own
cow, since there wouldn't be refrigeration.

&gt;Hi.

&gt;Here's an argument to debate. Would this stop the peak oil problem, the
&gt;global warming problem, and other problems related to use of fossil
&gt;energy? A fair market.

&gt;&quot;Some say that market forces will take care of the peak oil problem.
&gt;They argue that as we approach or pass the peak of production, the
&gt;price of oil will increase and alternatives will become more
&gt;competitive. Following this, consumers will act to replace our need for
&gt;non-petroleum energy resources. This philosophy is partly true.
&gt;However, the main problem with this argument is that current U.S. oil
&gt;prices do not accurately reflect the full social costs of oil
&gt;consumption. Currently, in the United States, federal and state taxes
&gt;add up to about 40 cents per gallon of gasoline. A World Resources
&gt;Institute analysis found that fuel-related costs not covered by drivers
&gt;are at least twice that much. The current price of oil does not include
&gt;the full cost of road maintenance, health and environmental costs
&gt;attributed to air pollution, the financial risks of global warming from
&gt;increasing carbon dioxide emissions or the threats to national security
&gt;from importing oil.

A load of crap ginned up to make their case.   What about the cost of
NOT using that oil to transport things?  How many would die if we all
stopped driving and shipping medicines, or shipping food or growing
food, and on and on.  The law of supply and demand takes care of the
pricing without gvt interference as long as all users are on an equal
footing.  That is, all the power producers held to the same level of
pollution, all the car drivers held to the same level of pollution,

If you want a fair market tell Rep Tom Udall to get teh gvt to stop
passing tax breaks for this that and the other industry.  Milk is
three times what it should cost thanks to the gvt.  Sugar is twice
what it should cost.  Oranges generally cost more then the free market
price due to gvt growing orders.  Everyone is all for a "fair market"
when it suits the political agenda and they get to say what a fair
market is.

You want alternate sources of oil?  There's hundreds of years worth up
in the Dakota's and northern tier in oil shale.  It would sell for
$3.00 a gallon.  Who's going to invest when they don't know from one
day to the next what the gvt subsidies will be for alternatives that
are wasteful, like ethanol.  The free market would be fine if you
could keep the gvt OUT of it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Hi.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Here's an argument to debate. Would this stop the peak oil problem, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;global warming problem, and other problems related to use of fossil
&gt;&gt; &gt;energy? A fair market.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Some say that market forces will take care of the peak oil problem.
&gt;&gt; &gt;They argue that as we approach or pass the peak of production, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;price of oil will increase and alternatives will become more
&gt;&gt; &gt;competitive. Following this, consumers will act to replace our need for
&gt;&gt; &gt;non-petroleum energy resources. This philosophy is partly true.
&gt;&gt; &gt;However, the main problem with this argument is that current U.S. oil
&gt;&gt; &gt;prices do not accurately reflect the full social costs of oil
&gt;&gt; &gt;consumption. Currently, in the United States, federal and state taxes
&gt;&gt; &gt;add up to about 40 cents per gallon of gasoline. A World Resources
&gt;&gt; &gt;Institute analysis found that fuel-related costs not covered by drivers
&gt;&gt; &gt;are at least twice that much. The current price of oil does not include
&gt;&gt; &gt;the full cost of road maintenance, health and environmental costs
&gt;&gt; &gt;attributed to air pollution, the financial risks of global warming from
&gt;&gt; &gt;increasing carbon dioxide emissions or the threats to national security
&gt;&gt; &gt;from importing oil.

&gt;&gt; A load of crap ginned up to make their case.   What about the cost of
&gt;&gt; NOT using that oil to transport things?  How many would die if we all
&gt;&gt; stopped driving and shipping medicines, or shipping food or growing
&gt;&gt; food, and on and on.  The law of supply and demand takes care of the
&gt;&gt; pricing without gvt interference as long as all users are on an equal
&gt;&gt; footing.  That is, all the power producers held to the same level of
&gt;&gt; pollution, all the car drivers held to the same level of pollution,
&gt;&gt; etc.

&gt;What if we reorganized our civilization so that transport was short
&gt;enough and easy enough to be fueled by 100% renewable resources
&gt;alone? And what happens when the oil is yanked out from under our
&gt;feet due to it's own depletion, something that WILL happen with
&gt;CERTAINTY. And it's much sooner than you may think -- 50 years to
&gt;total exhaustion, 25 years to half of present production and total
&gt;economic wreckage.
">

That sounds good and would work if you and everyone else started your
life at age 23 and knew where you were going to work the same moment
you bought your house.  But by age 26, you may move to another job 25
miles further away.  Do you think it's a workable solution for
everyone to move every time they get a different job?  What if that
job doesn't work out?  What if there is no affordable housing near
your job, and on and on.  If you look at pretty much any economically
developed country they all share some fairly common traits and one of
the predominant ones is that people want to have personal
transportation if it's at all feasible.  Sure, there are places like
NYC where the cost may be so high it's not feasible but that's a
fairly small portion of the total population of the country.

It would be easy to reorganize civilization if we only had to deal
with a few million people.  Otherwise the more or less free market
seems to work better then "central planning".

&gt;&gt; &gt; Because the price of oil is artificially low,
&gt;&gt; &gt;significant private investment in alternative technologies that provide
&gt;&gt; &gt;a long-term payback does not exist. _Until oil and its alternatives
&gt;&gt; &gt;compete in a FAIR MARKET, new technologies will not thrive._&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Rep. Tom Udall

&gt;&gt; &gt;So that is what we need. A FAIR MARKET. That's something that if we
&gt;&gt; &gt;could do it would guarantee that the new technologies could be
&gt;&gt; &gt;developed to be as cheap and easy as oil if not cheaper. Bam. Energy
&gt;&gt; &gt;problem solved. Guaranteed near 100%. But how to get a fair market?

&gt;&gt; &gt;Just something I was curious about...

&gt;&gt; If you want a fair market tell Rep Tom Udall to get teh gvt to stop
&gt;&gt; passing tax breaks for this that and the other industry.  Milk is
&gt;&gt; three times what it should cost thanks to the gvt.  Sugar is twice
&gt;&gt; what it should cost.  Oranges generally cost more then the free market
&gt;&gt; price due to gvt growing orders.  Everyone is all for a &quot;fair market&quot;
&gt;&gt; when it suits the political agenda and they get to say what a fair
&gt;&gt; market is.

&gt;But would a _truly_ fair market solve the problem?
">

There is no such thing as a Truly free market, that's why any group of
people that exceeds a few thousand people always winds up forming a
gvt.  The trick is to keep control of the gvt.  Something the USA
citizenry isn't doing too well with at the moment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You want alternate sources of oil?  There's hundreds of years worth up
&gt;&gt; in the Dakota's and northern tier in oil shale.  It would sell for
&gt;&gt; $3.00 a gallon.  Who's going to invest when they don't know from one
&gt;&gt; day to the next what the gvt subsidies will be for alternatives that
&gt;&gt; are wasteful, like ethanol.  The free market would be fine if you
&gt;&gt; could keep the gvt OUT of it.

&gt;I want alternate sources of _energy_, not oil, as oil is a finite
&gt;resource
&gt;that will exhaust soon. The oil shales will last hundreds of years at
&gt;_current rates of consumption_, but when you factor in the _growth_
&gt;that the stupid capitalist economy runs on...
">

We've made some pretty significant advancements in the last couple
hundred years. If the oil gets us another couple hundred we should
have some much better energy sources by then.  The ultimate solution
will be some sort of solar based energy device that returns 100's of
times the amount of energy output over it's life compared to the
energy required to build it.  Once we get to that point I think our
energy problem will become fairly insignificant in comparison to the
population problem we will have in 200 years.  Actually, ALL of our
problems stem not so much from limited resources but from too many
people.  Trouble is, no one wants to volunteer to be one of the ones
who isn't here.

Now, now. Everybody knows that Saddam had no nuclear weapons project.

Of course, the intelligence reports that Saddam had moved his project
out of the country during UNSC Res 687 sanctions has never been
corroborated. Certainly, there's no confirmation that he had
participated in a joint clandestine nuclear weapons project with Libya,
Egypt and Iraq.

There's nothing to those reports. Because we KNOW there was no program.

But then...

On December 13, 2003, Saddam was taken into custody by US military
forced in Iraq.

On December 19, 2003, in a surprise move, Moammar Qaddafi contacted the
UN in order to yield up his secret nuclear weapons project. He invited
in IAEA inspectors in order to guarantee verification.

In 2005, in an even more surprising move, Hasni Mubarak allows the
freest elections in the history of Egypt. This was a surprise because
it seemed to usher in an end to his long nurtured plans of having his
son, Gamal, succeed him as President for Life of Egypt. Gamal, in 2006,
announced Egypt's plans for developing nuclear power for Egypt's
growing electrical power needs. He promised the UN that his country
would do so transparently.

Yes, Moammar had procured the uranium for his secret project from
Niger.

My case would be about average for the US, I suppose.

When I work out the numbers, the subsidy from the tax deduction really
isn't that much.  Say abou t$12k per year in interest, at about the 25%
marginal rate, so at most I get a few grand.  Better than losing it I
suppose.

But the psychological factor is huge.  So many people are encourage to
purchase all the home they can squeeze into their checkbook, rather
than what they need or really use.  So we have mcmansions and
foreclosures.  Great system.  Not.

And if you can't afford a home, what do you get to deduct for your
rent?  squat.  But millionaires and congresscritters get to deduct the
mortage money on 2 homes.  That doesn't add up.

I've got nothing against being rich--I'd like to be there someday.  But
subsidizing things this way isn't too smart.  The real estate industry
has some wonderful lobbyists.

If mortgage money weren't deductible, I'd still own one way or another.
I like to work on my own place, and hate to depend on some other
schmuck to fix things that break.
