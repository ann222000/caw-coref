The QX5 is now in Aust at $255 (shudder)
Are there any other brands similar but cheaper?
Would the QX5 be suitable for finding microdots?
Thanks.

G'day Blair,
I searched RCSD archives, and noted I think Tracy Barber's
reference to this model, I was unaware there were versions.
It seems you may be the bearer of good tidings :)
I'll follow your links and investigate.
I think the site of the expensive model advised 200x zoom
I would hope that would pick up microdots.
Thanks.
Rodney

At 200x, I can almost tell the different fibers in the paper.  Mine
does 10x, 60x and 200x.  I also did indeed get the WinDoze 2K upgrade
for it, so I brought it out of the '98 realm with the 'puter.

Haven't used it in a while, but 'twas thinking today of setting that
PC up for the hobby.

For most tasks, I use the 10x / 60x settings.  When I'm getting a
little bit feisty, I'll kick into 200x overmode.  :^)

The price of the beastie is a wee tad high for my tastes lately.  I
paid $99 when it first came out and was / is a good item for that
price.  Since then, the QX5+ came out and others besides Mattel have
been making them.  The prices were dropping for a while, but from what
you're telling us, it seems they've gone through the roof.
