Since I'm getting my bike fixed up, I think now is the time finally to
put fit'n'forget lights on it. I'll get a Schmidt hub, and LED lights
front and rear, and never have to worry about batteries again.

With LED lights, I understand that I can use the SON20, which has lower
drag, because LEDs draw less power at full brightness (at 2mph according
to &lt; http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/schmidt.asp &gt;.

As for lights, there is an utterly bewildering array of options. All I
know is that I want:

*       front and rear lights powered by the dynamo
*       lights that stay lit while stationary
*       make drivers think: my, I'd better stay well clear of that bike

Is there some combination of products which will best meet these
requirements?

My choice, as mentioned in another thread, is the Busch &amp; Muller Lumotec
IQ Fly N Plus for the front, and the Axa-Basta Ray Steady for the rear.
The IQ Fly is incredibly bright for a dynamo LED lamp, and seems to
outdo the CatEye EL-530 I have as a &quot;booster&quot; light.

Neither need batteries to stay lit once you've stopped, and the IQ Fly
has a sensor option if you want that which will also work the back light
(the on-off switch also does the back light, so only one switch to turn
on).  You will probably need to get both from Germany though, unless
your LBS can order them for you.

Number one top tip is - buy it all from German online stores. I've just
bought a DLumotec oval senso plus for EUR50 (£35) - UK rrp is a
ludicrous £65.

I wouldn't worry too much about drag - I have a low-end Shimano dynohub
and the drag is hardly noticeable. SONs are very nice by all accounts
but very expensive - rose.de will do you a Shimano DH-3N71 (ultegra/xt
quality) for EUR55, and the 3N80 (lightweight, not available in UK) for
EUR67.

Lights, unless you want to spend £150 on the well regarded solidlights,
B&amp;M seem to be the way to go; oval are better than round; &quot;plus&quot; means
it has a standlight (stays on when you stop); &quot;senso&quot; means it has a
light sensor to turn on automatically when it gets dark, and also a
switch (necessary with dynohub); new &quot;fly IQ&quot; LED model apparently much
better than the others, although I only discovered this shortly after I
ordered the Dlumotec oval mentioned above...

cheers,

Finlay

You can. I'd stick with the bigger one, giving the option to go to higher

Whether they meet it /best/, I don't know (and actually doubt), but what
I use and should be perfectly up to the job is a D-lumotec Oval Senso
Plus and a DToplight Plus combination from B&amp;M.

The Solidlights offering is quite possibly/probably better, but then it
costs and arm and a leg more so it damn well ought to be!

what are you comparing it with (for brightness)?  I have a lumo round
whose standlight has stopped working (not much worse than when it was
working for those familiar with it) and am thinking about an IQ fly to
replace it.  Apart from the issues that Guy always used to bang on
about I have been very happy with it's light output for mostly urban
riding but ok on an occaisional Dunwich Dynamo.  My personal reference
point would be the Halfords/hella 1watt LED (being the best LED I have
used personally)
.  So long as the light is good /enough/ then the convenience of the
dynamo (and teh investment) means a lot to me. I agree about the form
factor.  Personally I like the lumo round/E6 shape for handle bar or
fork blade mounting. The Fly and Oval always seem to say &quot;fork crown&quot;
to me which doesn't suit my bike.

Pricewise, I haven't found the IQ Fly for less in Germany once you add
in delivery

I paid EUR 60 for the light + EUR 14 for postage from Germany, which
cost me £53 when the charge appeared on my statement. Not much
difference in price to Dotbike, but the important thing is that they
/are/ available from Germany immediately, whereas someone else pointed
out that they had been waiting over a week for dotbike to dispatch.
Another thing to consider is that you will need to find a vendor who
accepts payments such as paypal or debit cards, as most German vendors
take only bank transfers which most UK banks will bone you £20 for the
pleasure.

The lumo round has an voltage overprotection diode, you can just make it
out when the front part of the lamp is taken off, looking from the
bottom. Not sure if your dynamo could provide the power required though.

Can anyone say if the IQ Fly models are OK if wired without a tail lamp ?
There doesn't appear to be a manual for the IQ Fly on the B&amp;M website yet.
The older DLumotec manual implies the tail lamp is optional, so I'm hoping
it will be fine without.

I'm currently using a 3W halogen bulb and had been thinking of making my own
LED setup (a budget SolidLight).  But if the Fly will produce the light, its
not worth my time messing with expensive high power LEDs.

Adding a dynamo tail lamp isn't out of the question, but its more wires to
run around the bike.

I think the IQ will limit the current through the lumotec, don't think

there was a whole batch of D-lumotecs which didn't like not having a
rearlight.
The IQ's i've received have a manual run from the office copying machine
or so it seems. It only states the lights have approved over voltage
protection, but doesn't say anything about having to fit a rearlight

Note there is apparently also a cheaper version with a halogenbulb in
the same housing

I'm fairly sure I paid less than that in total, but I can't check just

when I get home because it might be useful for people.

I think what I'm saying is that I hope I didn't spend £50 on a front

It is marked as being 2.4W which does imply it's designed to work with a

You could always put a 56R 1W resistor in parallel with the light I suppose!

Newer more efficient LEDs produce more photons from the same electrical

Turning electricity into light is not very efficient. The best
commercial LEDs turn about 10% of the energy into visible light. As more
efficient LEDs are invented, lits like this will get brighter.

Having said that it might well be a higher power LED too, taking more

strict limits on how much power the lights can take though.

haven't got the voltmeter out, but my first impression is that an IQ fly
with Dtoplight doesn't draw enough current to get an E6z with 2.4w bulb
really on steam. There is lots of light but it hits a wall at 20m or so
and it doesn't get any further. In a drizzle the LED light colour isn't
as effective as a halogen bulb for seeing things. The standlight
function is pretty impressive, with hardly any loss of light. The top of
the lens could do with a bit of black tape, it emits too much light and
destroys your night vision

The IQ Fly is very bright, but whether or not you use it with any kind
of secondary is up to you - you don't really need to, to be honest.
It's much brighter than the halogen Lumotec Oval I've just replaced.
However, I have a CatEye EL-530 as a secondary for the very dark bits
just to give a bit more spread of light.

If you can wait a few months, I'll be able to do a comparison test of the
IQ Fly I'll be putting on the bike I'll be building out of the frame I'm
stripping down to build a bike for my wife, vs the DLumotec which is
going on said bike for my wife, vs the (halogen) Lumotec on my current
bike. If you can't wait, the ctc forums thread linked upthread has some
useful comments but admittedly no actual numbers beyond those supplied
by BuM themselves

The older one appears to be a flat topped side emitter or batwing Luxeon.
Newer LEDs like the Cree don't (AFAIK) have those options, so if you just
stuck one in a DLumotec, much less light would hit the reflector, it just
would come out forwards (which would be fine if the lens was designed for
that, but not if the lens is primarily designed for the reflector).
A more powerful LED might also overheat in a light originally designed
for a lower power LED.
And, at a guess, people would be less willing to pay more for something
that looked just the same even if it did say &quot;new brighter version&quot;.

&quot;Set it and forget it&quot;, saves fiddling with the switch when you want the

The hub dynamo front lights with a switch come with a wire to connect it
to a hub dynamo, I can not remember if the rear light comes with a wire.
The wiring goes from the front hub to the front light along the fork,
and the front lights have connectors to connect the wires from the front
light to the rear light. The front &amp; rear light wire is strapped to the
frame with plastic cable ties which you will have to buy separately.

The SON is suplied with plugs
IQ fly comes with 70 cm wiring to the dynamo, a long wire for the

Dtoplights in consumer packaging are supplied with a wire, but you can
use the wire supplied with the headlight (do not use the spadeconnectors

you run the wire from the headlight to the dynamo, and from the

of all the bits: along the gearwire, brakecable, through the frame...
And use heatshrink, tiewraps and tape to keep it all in place

I've found that the sensor tends to be a bit too much on the safe side,
so on a slightly overcast day the lights come on when you may not really
need them.  I then found myself turning the lights off manually, then
have to set it back to 'auto' or 'on' later.  If I'm flipping the switch
anyway, I don't see the point of sensors!  They're OK if you're not
fussed about the lights being on, and TBH you don't really notice much
extra drag.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The back light usually comes with wiring, my IQ Fly didn't but I already
had it in place.  I run the wire to the back light under the downtube,
under the LHS chainstay then up the seatstay to the light fixed to the
rack.  Posh bikes have internal wiring runs :-)  Incidentally, the
wiring to the backlight runs from the IQ Fly so that the switch or
sensor on that works both lights simultaneously.

If you're doing this only to avoid drag, I would point out that the
drag from the ordinary SON is almost undetectable, so the advantage

It's undetectable in the sense that I can't detect any extra

&gt; Maybe good enough is good enough. Good point.

&gt;&gt; I agree about the form factor.  Personally I like the lumo round/E6
&gt;&gt; shape for handle bar or fork blade mounting.

&gt; I don't like the idea of fork blade mounting. Why would you want a wheel

I'm a fan of fork-blade mounting. The light is closer to the road, where
you want it for illumination, and out of the way of brakes/handle bar
bags/other clutter. Yes, you get a shadow of the rim falling towards the
left-hand side of the road, but it isn't normally anywhere you're looking
anyway.

This is not necessarily true for all LEDs.
It may be true for the DLumotec Oval, which (AFAIK) only uses a 1W LED,
so will reach full brightness at a fairly low speed. But its not the
case for something like the Solidlights, which has 2 * 3W LEDs, so won't
reach full brightness until somewhat faster.
Where the IQ Fly fits in this I'm not sure - I don't know what power LED
it uses.

&gt; Will a rear light driven by a dynamo be as good as my Cateye LD1100

IME it won't be quite as good, but it will be mostly good enough.
I think the best option is to have both a battery powered flashing LED
and a steady dynamo powered light. Then you have a backup in case one fails.

&gt; Does all this kit come with the necessary wiring? And how does one

My IQ Fly included a standard 2-core wire for connecting to the rear (as
well as the attached wire from the front light to the dynamo).
Or for a neater / more reliable option, I like the look of the Schmidt
coaxial cable (available from Bikeplus).

Having had a light fork blade mounted while waiting for a replacement
for a broken crown mount, I slightly prefer the light pattern with the
crown mount, but agree the shadow certainly isn't a problem. And you can
always put a light on each blade if it troubles you:

Of course if you want a light for use with front panniers, fork blade
mounting is trickier.

&gt;&gt; &gt; If you're doing this only to avoid drag, I would point out that the
&gt;&gt; &gt; drag from the ordinary SON is almost undetectable, so the advantage
&gt;&gt; &gt; of a SON20 may be vanishingly small.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It's undetectable in the sense that I can't detect any extra
&gt;&gt; &gt; resistance when the lights are turned on. In other words, you may
&gt;&gt; &gt; be saving yourself thirty percent of bugger all.

&gt; I know, but I think I must just be scarred by a childhood of 1970s
&gt; bottle dynamos, and remain deeply resentful of any power-sucking
&gt; devices, especially since my own power is so measly.
">

Seriously : As Brendan says, the drag from the normal SON is pretty much
unnoticable, so I bet you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between
the two in terms of drag. OTOH the full size version can be set up to chuck
out more light at lower speeds, and that will be a visible difference.

I reckon there's a lot more gain to be had from eg a faster frame or other
bits than from getting the 20&quot; SON. So if you've already got all the top-end
stuff, and are looking to eke that tiny extra bit of performance from the
bike, then it might be worth a look. But otherwise, keep it simple and go
for the normal version.

Having had a fork-mounted lamp rotate into my spokes when I hit a bump
while riding down a hill, I don't see the light pattern as being the
biggest problem with fork-mounting!  I wouldn't mount a light to a fork

That depends on the mounting. Certainly it's something to take into
consideration, but wasn't a problem for me, since my forks had a
suitable threaded hole. http://www.flickr.com/photos/armb/1409228776/

The Zinkens Dynashoe is another fairly secure option, though AFAIK the
version with the light bracket is left hand only, and if you have a hub
dynamo it's probably excessive just for a light bracket (and it relies
on canti/V-brake studs):
