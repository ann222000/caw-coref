Mike Moore is being challenged to debate his NZ Herald op-ed today by
Progressive Party leader Jim Anderton, who is the Minister of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and for Biosecurity in the Labour-
Progressive coalition attacked by Mr Moore today.

“When a person accuses others of the politics of destruction, it is
incumbent on them to propose a positive alternative. But take a close
look at Mike Moore’s random abuse: Conspicuously absent is anything
constructive. Even as his thoughts race around like a pinball, they
hit nothing but the negative button. So let’s have a debate and see if
he can put up any constructive alternatives.

“Mike Moore’s comments are hypocritical. I was in the Labour caucus
when he was part of a vicious personal smear campaign against then
Opposition leader Jim McLay − so his injured tone about John Key
facing some scrutiny is a bit rich.

“Mike Moore doesn’t limit his personal attacks to the other side. He
was part of a personal campaign of destruction and denigration against
Bill Rowling, his own party leader. There was some awful muck-throwing
against Helen Clark when she replaced him, too, but you won’t find
that Mike Moore came out against that.

“It’s simply outrageous for him to now claim New Zealand is sliding
down the rich country ranking, when the slide happened on his watch
and as a result of policies which both he and Roger Douglas were cheer-
leaders for.

“Since Helen Clark was elected prime minister in 1999, the economy has
enjoyed continuous economic growth − the longest run of continuous
expansion in Mike Moore’s adult lifetime. That is, perhaps, why he is
so bitter. He is a failed politician, and the success of this
government exposes the failure of the government he was in.

“He was prime minister for six weeks, so now he is bitter at the
success of someone who has been in the job for eight, going on nine,
years. One reason Labour failed so badly in the Moore era was that
they were poll-driven fruitcakes who believed leadership coups were
some sort of management plan for a political party. Now he wants to
start another coup! Not only was he a bitter failure, he still can’t
see the reasons for his failure.

“He wants the limelight, because that is all Mike has ever wanted. His
sentence construction and the rambling organisation of his thoughts
are a pretty good clue to the lack of clarity of his ideas. Let him
defend his bitterness in front of a public audience and we’ll see how
his scrambled ideas stand up to some scrutiny.

I’m happy to challenge him to a public debate − any time, anywhere −
to give him the opportunity to defend the load of rubbish he has just
dumped into the political arena, “Jim Anderton said.

Someone just sent me this:

Let’s see what are a few of National’s accusations -accuses the REAL
politics of destruction:

Here are a few that immediately come to mind:

·        National called Labour &quot;corrupt&quot; mid 2006

·        Investigate magazine (with support from National) then
published a photograph with commentary implying that Clark's husband
Peter Davis was gay. Other mainstream media outlets quickly
republished the rumour. [28] Soon after, and within a day of saying
that personal abuse had no place in NZ politics,

·        The Young Nationals' website depicted Helen Calrke as Star
Wars villain Darth Vader telling Luke Skywalker she is his “lesbian
father”.

·         Private detective Wayne Idour admitted being hired by the
sect “to dig dirt” on Labour MPs and described some of the things he
had found out as “alarming”. He told the media that he would make
these “alarming” discoveries public within a week. Nothing appeared.
Denied by National …but with equal evidence in which Pope denied his
charges. The media ignored this charge but broadcast for weeks on end.

Jim is fortunate to have a very strong electoral power base (Sydenham
subsequently re-styled Wigram is by far the strongest left wing
electorate in NZ taking in the blue collar reas of Christchurch) so, by
being outside Labour, he enjoys all the benefits of being effectively
part of the Labour government, but without having to meet usual
obligation of Labour membership.

Actually, the most vicious attacks against 'Diamond' Jim McLay came from

his contributions.

What the hell does Jim anderton expect when Mike had Helen's dagger

Mike Moore knows more about international economics than Jim will ever know.

Labour's contribution to it was and is Sweet Fanny Adams.  It was
happening in spite of Labour and has enabled Labour to waste taxpayers'
money - eg far more is being spent on health, but there are fewer
operations.

He is a failed politician, and the success of this

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; government exposes the failure of the government he was in.
">

Jim is talking through a hole in his hat - failed politicins do not
successfully run WTO.

I seem to remember that Jim Anderton was a failed businessman.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; “He was prime minister for six weeks,
">

Six weeks is not long enough to shape the party up for an election his
way.  Labour was doomed at the 1990 election and there was nothing Mike
could have done.

Until Helen stabbed him in the back.

Jim Anderton came to recognise that he was never going to be Labour
leader which in his terms makes him a bigger failure as a politician thn
Mike Moore.

Jim could not even hold the Alliance together, and Helen passed over him
for deputy Prime Minister in 2002 and 2006, because his political
usefulness now he was a one man band had diminished.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; so now he is bitter at the
&gt; success of someone who has been in the job for eight, going on nine,
&gt; years.

Jim Anderton sounds like the bitter one.  Mike Moore is the contented
elder statesman.

I can't see little Jimmy snivelling Anderton ever being offered to be the
chairman of WTO.

Let Anderton take on Mike Moore.  It wouldn't last longer than a blink of an
eye.  It will take Anderton longer to clean the brown shit off his tongue
first.
With Anderton helping, Clark can only slip even further and faster in the
polls.

Just who is this &quot;Mary Collins&quot;?  Like Janice Graham she re-posts long
winded left wing ramblings, but &quot;Mary&quot; denies being an alias for Janice.

Now it is time for another guess.  Now you will have all heard of &quot;Betty
Crocker&quot; this fictitious housewife invented by some American advertising
agency.

Now, I figure that &quot;Mary Collins&quot; is a sort of left wing &quot;Betty Crocker&quot;
hauled out now and again by the Beehive publicity gnomes.

Nope. But it's well known around Parliament that his ego is

Since 2000, NZ has averaged about 6 percent a year (estimating from
the graph).  Prior to 1997, growth was above 6 percent a year.  Are
the years 94-96 an indication of drastic policy changes as much as the
years 02-03 or 05-06?

Because New Zealand was still recovering from the economic carnage
wrought upon it by Labours pig farmer, as they worked away on this
cunning plan, that if Government deliberately and completely destroyed
the economy, then for the next decade or so they could point to a slow
and painful recovery.

It's not hard to think of something, Brian. First GDP growth did not
collapse as you claim. We know there was turmoil early 1992 as Rogernomics
sunk in. The burst of 6% growth in 1994 was due to Ruth Richardson's
economic policies even though she is villified and rarely given credit.
After that growth dropped back to a more normal level. In 1997, 1998
National had a severe drought and Asian economic recession to deal with.
However National came out of it well. The sudden surge in 2000 was due to
National's management. Labour had not been in power long enough to claim any
credit. While you want to credit the good economic times since to Labour's
management you know very well it was entirely due to great world trade
conditions. If you don't believe me ask yourself how much farmings
prosperity at the moment is due to anything Labour has done. That is not a
criticism of Labour because I believe the more government keeps it's hands
in it's pockets and lets everyone else get on with it the better. Moreover
our present prosperity is based on Roger Douglas' policies arried on by
National. The proof is that while Helen claims National had failed policies
during the 90s she has altered few of them.

Perhaps your analysis is just a tad superficial?

94-96 averages roughly the same as for the period 2000-2006.  Only the
years immediately after 1997 deviate significantly from this average.
That there is a decline from 94-96 doesn't necessarily say anything
about the decline from 97-99.

Bruce Aynsley and various of the old crew.  I don't think they will be

Jenny Shipley rolled Bolger in late 97 and sacked Peters in 98.
However drastic such moves were, it is not clear how this is
responsible for the decline in economic growth, particularly in the
years prior to these events taking place.

The graph does indeed show several years of steady decline in growth.
But this does not mean what you want it to mean.  If you are traveling
in a moving car and apply the brakes the car will slow down, if you
let go of the brakes but then start to travel up a hill it will
continue to slow down.  A graph of speed vs time may show a steady
decline in speed over the entire period, but it doesn't mean that the
same force can necessarily be attributed to the entire period of
decline.

The graph shows that prior to 97 the growth rate averaged above 6
percent (where it has averaged during the current Labour government).
The graph shows that the only years to deviate significantly from this
long term average of around 6 percent are the years immediately
following 1997.  This is clearly in agreement with the explanation
given by Robert.  This is further reinforced by the recovery in 2000
which cannot reasonably be attributed to the newly elected Labour
government - unless of course you believe Helen possesses some sort of
magical power that consumed the nation upon her victory.

he appears to have some things in perspective, such as don't attack Key on
non-issues. Spend your time lauding the successes of the govt and deal to
Key on bigger issues. I would think on others Mike is probably running a
little ahead of himself. Seems one of Moores problems has always been making
a good speech at the wrong time, that is, saying the wrong thing @ the wrong
time. An example, his cold long night speech in 1993. A very nice speech,
pity he had lost the election. People need to take many things, though not
all, Moore says with a grain of salt. I think Anderton is essentially
pointing that out though words like 'failed politican' is a little extreme.
Moore himself is no angel, he and others dealt to Rowling fairly ruthlessly.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you reconcile the collapse of economic growth 1994-1999
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with laying any kind of groudwork?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Although I'm sure you'll think of something.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I think you've forgotten something.  Rack your brains - &quot;1997&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Sue, 1997 is towards the end of the period 1994 - 1999. Can you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;explain why GDP per capita declined right through the period?

&gt;&gt; &gt;Do you know what significant economic event happened in 1997?

&gt;&gt; Obviously StatsNZ doesn't.

&gt;Brian doesn't know, either.

It obviously had no effect on the numbers, so was it really a
significant event from the NZ pov after all?

The Asian economic crisis knocked NZ's economy down for three years.
Which numbers were you talking about?

&gt; &gt;&gt; I can't see little Jimmy snivelling Anderton ever being offered to be the
&gt; &gt;&gt; chairman of WTO.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Let Anderton take on Mike Moore.  It wouldn't last longer than a blink of an
&gt; &gt;&gt; eye.  It will take Anderton longer to clean the brown shit off his tongue
&gt; &gt;&gt; first.
&gt; &gt;&gt; With Anderton helping, Clark can only slip even further and faster in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; polls.

&gt; &gt;What I can't stand about Mike Moore is his gratuitous sycophantic
&gt; &gt;sucking up to the establishment.

&gt; &gt;Cheers,

&gt; &gt;Cliff

&gt; Apparently there was something on teh radio saying that what the the
&gt; Herald printed missed out some of the article - just happening to be a
&gt; bit about John Key's Y-fronts that may have put the whole article in a
&gt; slightly different context.

&gt; I regard Mike Moore as being a bit like Michael Bassett anyway -
&gt; someone who effectively left the Labour Party a very long time ago- Hide quoted text -

Yes, he left after Labour fell into the clutches of the radical
feminists, and the sexually confused, it must be a great tragedy for
normal decent ex Labour politicians to see what their party has become
today, and have to ponder the depths to which it has sunk.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Since Helen Clark was elected prime minister in 1999, the economy has

&gt;&gt; The graph shows no sign of it - just a steady roll-off to 1999
&gt;&gt; and nothing special about 1997 at all. NZYB02 gives essentially
&gt;&gt; the same thing but for real GDP and GDP/cap.

&gt;Perhaps your analysis is just a tad superficial?

&gt;94-96 averages roughly the same as for the period 2000-2006.  Only the
&gt;years immediately after 1997 deviate significantly from this average.
&gt;That there is a decline from 94-96 doesn't necessarily say anything
&gt;about the decline from 97-99.

No one period necessarily says anything about any other, life is
a series of random events.
