Bourdais now in NASCAR link

Sebastien Bourdais may call off his anticipated switch to Toro Rosso
after another potential option for the 2008 season landed on his
table. It emerged last Friday that the multiple Champ Car title
winner's open wheeler team Newman-Haas would merge with Robert Yates
Racing and race in NASCAR next year.

&quot;(Newman-Haas) are seven-time Champ Car champions.  They're winners,
they're classy people and together with (their) engineering and
marketing, we can make this work,&quot; said Yates' Racing Engines
president Doug Yates.

Some sections of the American press, nonetheless aware that STR bosses
have an option on Frenchman Bourdais that runs until Tuesday,
speculate that the 28-year-old could be part of the deal.

Other sources say the rumour could be the result of the apparent
turmoil in recent days at Faenza based Toro Rosso, with Bourdais
possibly concerned that the team's current drivers are involved in
public slanging matches and even physical tussles as relationships
with their bosses break down.

I wonder if NHL actually did this purchase in case Sebastian does not get a
f1 ride, but wants to try something else.

A team like NHL having the ability to be a step into NASCAR makes them more
attractive to drivers.

Also, Budwiwser used to sponser Paul Tracy's car when he drove for NHL.
There is some speculation that having a NASCAR team also allows sponsorship
to flow into champ car, and Budwiser was assocated with NHL in the past....

That is what it sounds like. Bourdais is too good to let go,
especially if you have your hands around his neck ;-)

Carl used to have a NASCAR team with Michael Kranefuss in the mid 90s,
so maybe he will do well this time.

Not sure about that one. Any concrete info on where Bud is sending its
sponsorship to in Nextel, ermmm I mean, Sprint Cup? Last rumor I heard
was that Kahne might land it, but I don't follow it all that much.

100% speculation on my side.I believe it was Robin Millar who mentioned the
Budweiser ties that NHL had in the past and made the above &quot;hint&quot; that
Budweiser could get involved again with NHL. There nothing more concrete
then that simple issue of &quot;past&quot; ties between the Bud and NHL. (so, just
speculation...but, if Bud was to return to NHL...they would be in a position
to run a 3rd car).
