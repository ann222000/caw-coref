How does it compare to their other albums?
Is it their best?
Their worst?
Or just a mediocre album which is not as good as their best, nor as
bad as their worst?

These albums are typically considered as good, if not better than The
Piper At the Gates of Dawn.

- The Dark Side of the Moon
- Wish You Were Here
- Animals

Some people would even say that Meddle and The Wall were better.

Note: I didn't post this to the Floyd newsgroup, since the trolls in
there are so pro Waters era that they can't be objective about the
comparison at all.

Ah, so you trust the &quot;trolls&quot; in RMB more?

I personally don't like the album as much as the ones you compare it with,
although I recognize its place in music history.  It has nothing to do with
favoring Waters or disliking Syd.  Just one man's opinion.

My story of Pink Floyd. It was in the mid-sixties and I was out at a record
store with a neighbor friend looking for something new.  Laid eyes on
&quot;Pipers&quot;.  Hmmmm... looked cool. But would it impress our &quot;mentor&quot; Wayne,
who was pretty much the arbiter of musical taste?

Bought it. Took it home. As it played we smoked cigarettes and shot the
bull. Didn't listen to the LP at all.  When it was over we agreed it was
pretty cool and would impress Wayne. We took the album over to impress
Wayne.

Wayne put it on his stereo and we listened. All of a sudden the magic
disappeared. Wayne sympathasized; he knew what it was like to get all hyped
up over a band and read too much into it.  Pink Floyd was obviously a few
guys just cashing in on the psychedelic trend.  We forgot all about Pink
Floyd.

Flash forward to 1980.  I hadn't been listening to music at all since maybe
1970 except for a flash of AC/DC and the Cars. No drugs either.  I was
sitting around playing poker with some new found buddies who were passing
around the weed. There was some music in the background and listening to it
with a buzz was amazing.  I ask, &quot;Who is that?&quot;  They say, &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;. I
shit.

It was the Meddle lp and the song was echoes.  To this day my favorite
Floyd.  I picked up everything I could on Pink Floyd, but &quot;Pipers&quot; is an
album I still could never take seriously.

It's the one with Syd Barrett.  The sound of it is not that great.
Pete Townshend thought it didn't really capture how they sounded live.
Never having been a fan of Pink Floyd beyond the 60s I don't know how to
classify it for them.

Its a completely different style. However, I do like it, but don't expect
anything like Dark Side of the Moon.

IMHO: basically Pink Floyd went through 3 musical phases:
1) Syd Barrett Phase (The Piper at the Gates of Dawn) - Psychedelic,
eclectic, 60's English pop music with a bit of an experimental edge
2) Experimental Space Rock (A Saucerful of Secrets, More, Ummagumma. Atom
Heart Mother) - Mostly extended instrumental pieces with loose structure.
Atom Heart Mother is my favorite from this period.
3) Electronic Stadium Rock (Meddle tthrough The Final Cut) - Less
experimental, more mainstream rock concept driven albums.

Pete Townshend saw Floyd perform at UFO where they just used to jam.
He expected Piper to be a total jamfest. But if it were, it would have
been a complete bore. It has a great mix of jams (Pow R Toch,
Interstellar Overdrive, Take Thy...) mixed with a lot of other songs.

Neither are great comparisons. Piper Of The Gates Of Dawn is a very
different experience because David Gilmour wasn't playing or singing
them. Gilmour prefers a softer sound that builds up slowly and
rhythmically, whereas Syd Barrett preferred something stronger that
jumps from place to place. Barrett's voice also a stronger British
accent, and he uses shorter notes when singing.

And then there's the lyrics. Roger Waters admitted openly for years
that he could never match the surrealistic imagery of Syd. Syd's songs
are either disjointed ideas or wistful plays on ideas.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely -- but with the warning you might
want to check out the Relics compilation or even Echoes: The Best Of
Pink Floyd first. Those offer some Barrett pieces (&quot;Astronomy Domine,&quot;
&quot;Insterstellar Overdrive,&quot; &quot;Bike,&quot; &quot;Arnold Layne,&quot; &quot;See Emily Play&quot;)
alongside the Waters/Gilmour and Gilmour/Mason periods to give you a
better idea of whether you think they are comparable to the others.

Plus keep in mind this is the first official album for the band that
would undergo some dramatic shifts in their lineup and style
throughout the next number of years.

I see it more as five periods:

1) The early phase:
LONDON '66-'67,
EARLY SINGLES,
PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN
- Syd Barrett in the lead
- disjointed lyric ideas, surreal imagery
- trying to have pop singles that didn't sound like them
- raw power that couldn't play the same piece twice the same
2) The transition period
SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS
MORE! and ZABRISKI POINT
UMMAGUMMA
ATOM HEART MOTHER
- music is slower, more layered
- shift in lyrics to be more grounded ideas
- attempting to be &quot;arty&quot;
3) The 'pure' Floyd
MEDDLE
OBSCURED BY CLOUDS
DARK SIDE OF THE MOON
WISH YOU WERE HERE
ANIMALS
- Gilmour the voice, Waters the words
- long pieces that build up progressively in layers
- thematically joined albums
4) Roger Waters &amp; Company
THE WALL
THE FINAL CUT
- Lyrically overwhelming
- individual songs are lost as part of larger mosaic
- presence of the others vanishing or lost, more voices
5) Gimour, Mason &amp; Wright
A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON
THE DIVISION BELL
- sounds like pure Floyd but lyrics aren't there

Floyd needed to be commercial, something Waters, Wright and Mason all
noted years later when talking about the early singles like &quot;Arnold
Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play.&quot; They were one thing on the BBC radio and
television programs, another at the clubs and happenings, and this
album was trying to reconcile that. In the end, they DID reconsile it
by not doing singles -- after '69, there's one single for Meddle, The
Wall and The Final Cut.

The other problem was Floyd's lack of skill. Engineers at EMI had to
overdub one take of &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; onto another because the
band couldn't play the song the same way twice(!).

But Bowie didn't know the Waters/Gilmour Pink Floyd as we do when he
said that. Dark Side of the Moon was recorded through the summer of 72
and released in March 1973; Pinups finished recording in July 1973,
after a year that saw two huge albums (Rise &amp; Fall of Ziggy Stardust
and Aladdin Sane), both of whom had lyrics comparable to the style of
the earlier Floyd than the contemporary one. Syd's vocal performances
are also closer to Bowie's as well.

&gt; Floyd needed to be commercial, something Waters, Wright and Mason all
&gt; noted years later when talking about the early singles like &quot;Arnold
&gt; Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play.&quot; They were one thing on the BBC radio and
&gt; television programs, another at the clubs and happenings, and this
&gt; album was trying to reconcile that.

And does a great job in that IMO.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the end, they DID reconsile it
&gt; by not doing singles -- after '69, there's one single for Meddle, The
&gt; Wall and The Final Cut.

&gt; The other problem was Floyd's lack of skill. Engineers at EMI had to
&gt; overdub one take of &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; onto another because the
&gt; band couldn't play the song the same way twice(!).

too much tripping on acid does that to you. I don't think it is lack
of skill. Interstellar Overdrive, Pow r Toc H and Take Thy show that
they were very good at jamming.

A Momentary Lapse of Reason is essentially a David Gilmour solo album

How come they had ideas until Wish You Were Here and they disappeared
suddenly? I think early on, after Barrett, Waters and Wright were
responsible for most of the music. Gilmour did do some solos and song
most of the songs, but his songwriting in particular was just OKAY.
TDSOTM found everyone at their peaks (even Syd who was in peak
weight ..lol). Wright start beginning to lose interest around WYWH but
he still contributed quite a lot. Around Animals he was hardly there
and it was all Waters and a bit of Gilmour. By the time The Wall was
being made, Wright was completely useless, Gilmour/Mason were clueless
and Waters was doing everything. Wafers ofcourse started thinking HE
IS FLOYD and he was not wrong. The only thing he was wrong about is
they were much more of a band until WYWH.

No.  The Floyd provided the music for two of his films, he worked with
them directly, so he was speaking based upon his experiences with all of
them.

There's no reason to think otherwise, and looking at the solo albums,
clearly he was right.  Roger has various things to say that he feels
deeply about, Richard gave us Wet Dreams, and to be fair, Broken China
which I haven't heard yet.   David Gilmour is a damn good guitar player,
but that's really about it.

And Nick Mason is their Ringo.

Worst. &quot;The Wall&quot; being the best.

&gt; &gt; Or just a mediocre album which is not as good as their best, nor as
&gt; &gt; bad as their worst?

&gt; &gt; These albums are typically considered as good, if not better than The
&gt; &gt; Piper At the Gates of Dawn.

&gt; &gt; - The Dark Side of the Moon
&gt; &gt; - Wish You Were Here
&gt; &gt; - Animals

&gt; &gt; Some people would even say that Meddle and The Wall were better.

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.
I don't know why I call him Gerald.
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse.

Genius, IMO.
