A circular water tower stands in a field touching a long straight wall
that is tangent to its edge. A goat is outside the water tower, on the
same side of the wall as the tower, on a tether whose other end is
tied to the point where the water tower touches the wall. The tether
is just long enough that the goat can reach the point of the water
tower diametrically opposite the point where the tower, wall and
tether come together. What's the relationship between the area of
grass the goat can reach to graze on and the floor area of the water
tower?

I made this problem up as practice for a friend taking a math class
and I think it turned out to be a good puzzle (though it was too hard
for her).

Isn't it complicated by the fact that until the goat reaches the wall,
the tether is never really at full length? It's still got part of its
length taken up by the curve of the tank wall, so unless I'm
completely offbase, the line marking the limit of the goat's travel is
going to be an increasing radius curve as he moves toward the wall?

Say that the tank is 20 feet in diameter. That makes the tether 31.4
feet long (pi*r). But even though the tether is 31.4 feet long, the
goat is only 20 feet from the wall at the starting point. Which, I
think, means that if the wall were removed, the goat would  walk in an
odd looking half circle-half ellipse. The wall cuts off the circular
section and half of the ellipse, and the tank itself removes another
(pi*r^2)/2 from the area of the quarter ellipse that the goat can
reach.

My intuitive guess is pi::4 (or pi::2 if the goat can
pass the point where fence-meets-tower-meets-tether,
so as to reach both sides of the tower).

Just like a circle can be divided into infinitesimally
thin trianglettes and rearranged to rectangularize its
area [I think the ancient Greeks computed pi this way],
the sweep of the tether can be similarly divided into
thin (yet shortening) trianglettes... you get the idea.

Int[0..pi] (pi-t)^2/2
= (2pi^2.t-2pi.t^2+t^3)/6 |[0..pi]

Tower=pi

So, as I said before, the relationship is that it's larger.

(Which was clearly obvious, as it's larger than a cycloid, which
would have been equal in area.)

You sound pretty sure of yourself, but I don't think you're right!

Actually she got closer to figuring out what's tricky about it than
you did, which wasn't bad for a 1st-year calculus student.

Risto Lankinen got it right. Normalising the radius of the silo to 1
and the tether to pi, the integral is
INT[0..pi/2] (pi - 2theta) dtheta, which equals pi^2/4. So the areas
of the silo and the grazed area are as 4:pi. The grazed area is
smaller.

You can visualise the integral if you imagine the wall along the x
axis and a unit circle centered at (0,1). The tether is attached to
the origin. Its length is pi. Along the x-axis it is unencumbered; as
it sweeps through an angle of pi/2, more and more of it is taken up by
the arc-length along the outside of the silo--this arc-length is 2
theta. Proving that the arc-length is 2 theta was the tedious part for
me; there might have been an easy way to show it but I just cranked
the trig till it popped out.

At the starting point, the goat is at the wall.  I tried to view the
problem as a goat on a tether of length pi centered at the origin, with
a circle of radius 1 centered at (0,1), and doing some integrals to get
the area that the goat can cover.  But that pesky circle means that the
goat can't graze a half-circle, and my high school calculus is too rusty
to figure out what the proper equation should be....

If hte tether is only long enough to allow the goat to reach the point

tether is  fastened, then as the goat moves away from the wall and
toward the water tank, he's going to wrap the rop around the tank,

its fastening point to its farthest reach -- it's assuming more and
more of a curve.

The area that can be grazed by the goat is unbounded by the terms of the

Because any goat worthy of the name will chew through the tether in
short order, unless said tether is a chain.

Because you consider the wording &quot;a goat is...on a tether whose other
end is tied&quot; to leave a loophole wherein it's not specified the goat
is *tied* to that tether? (He might just be standing &quot;on&quot; the tether,
for example, in which case he can go as far as he wants leaving the
tether behind)

Or because you consider the informal wording &quot;the tether is just long
enough to [do x]&quot; not to rule out the possibility the tether is longer
than would be necessary to do x?

&gt;&gt; gaze (or, indeed, the area that the goat can graze).

&gt;&gt; ObPuzzle: why?

&gt; Because you consider the wording &quot;a goat is...on a tether whose other
&gt; end is tied&quot; to leave a loophole wherein it's not specified the goat
&gt; is *tied* to that tether? (He might just be standing &quot;on&quot; the tether,
&gt; for example, in which case he can go as far as he wants leaving the
&gt; tether behind)

&gt; Or because you consider the informal wording &quot;the tether is just long
&gt; enough to [do x]&quot; not to rule out the possibility the tether is longer
&gt; than would be necessary to do x?
">

No, Barbara had it right (kudos @ Barbara) - we can surely accept that
the goat is attached to the tether, given the whole wording of the
question; but the tether is ***tied*** to the anchor point, which
suggests a rope rather than a chain. And we all know about goats and
ropes...

I call bullshit. I've just mocked up the setup on a piece of paper,
and the answer is ~1.6. Count the squares:

http://fatphil.org/images/thumb_IMG_1250.jpg

The radius is roughly 3.2. The tower has area ~32 and the area
swept out by the tether is just under 53. 53/32 ~= 1.656

Pi^2/6 = 1.645

I'd call that agreement - about 1 part in 100.

In fact, you can clearly place the object around which I drew
inside the swept-out area. One doesn't need to do any counting to
see that it's larger than the tower.

Screw calculus - let's see your drawing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Leaving out the semicircle (due to the wall) the area is just (pi^3*r^2)/3,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the ratio is 1/3*pi^2.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's not what I got... anyone else?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn't it complicated by the fact that until the goat reaches the wall,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the tether is never really at full length? It's still got part of its
&gt;&gt;&gt; length taken up by the curve of the tank wall, so unless I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt; completely offbase, the line marking the limit of the goat's travel is
&gt;&gt;&gt; going to be an increasing radius curve as he moves toward the wall?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Say that the tank is 20 feet in diameter. That makes the tether 31.4
&gt;&gt;&gt; feet long (pi*r). But even though the tether is 31.4 feet long, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; goat is only 20 feet from the wall at the starting point. Which, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; think, means that if the wall were removed, the goat would  walk in an
&gt;&gt;&gt; odd looking half circle-half ellipse. The wall cuts off the circular
&gt;&gt;&gt; section and half of the ellipse, and the tank itself removes another
&gt;&gt;&gt; (pi*r^2)/2 from the area of the quarter ellipse that the goat can
&gt;&gt;&gt; reach.

&gt;&gt;No; I think you've got it backwards:

&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;A goat is outside the water tower, on the same side of the wall as the
&gt;&gt;tower, on a tether whose other end is tied to the point where the water
&gt;&gt;tower touches the wall.

&gt;&gt;&lt;/snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;At the starting point, the goat is at the wall.  I tried to view the
&gt;&gt;problem as a goat on a tether of length pi centered at the origin, with
&gt;&gt;a circle of radius 1 centered at (0,1), and doing some integrals to get
&gt;&gt;the area that the goat can cover.  But that pesky circle means that the
&gt;&gt;goat can't graze a half-circle, and my high school calculus is too rusty
&gt;&gt;to figure out what the proper equation should be....

&gt;But the whole problem as set out was
&gt;&gt;&gt;A circular water tower stands in a field touching a long straight   wall
&gt;&gt; &gt; that is tangent to its edge. A goat is outside the water tower, on the
&gt;&gt; &gt; same side of the wall as the tower, on a tether whose other end is
&gt;&gt; &gt; tied to the point where the water tower touches the wall.

&gt;***********
&gt;&gt;&gt;The tether
&gt;&gt; &gt; is just long enough that the goat can reach the point of the water
&gt;&gt; &gt; tower diametrically opposite the point where the tower, wall and
&gt;&gt; &gt; tether come together.
&gt;************
&gt;&gt;&gt;  What's the relationship between the area of
&gt;&gt; &gt; grass the goat can reach to graze on and the floor area of the water
&gt;&gt; &gt; tower?

&gt;If hte tether is only long enough to allow the goat to reach the point
&gt;of the water tank diametrically opposite from the point at which the
&gt;tether is  fastened, then as the goat moves away from the wall and
&gt;toward the water tank, he's going to wrap the rop around the tank,
&gt;losing available length. The rope no longer forms a straight line from
&gt;its fastening point to its farthest reach -- it's assuming more and
&gt;more of a curve.
">

Let me try this again.

Plot the points on a graph such that the wall forms the x-axis and the
line formed by the diameter of the tank perpendicular to the wall
forms the y-axis. The point where the tether is attached to the wall
and the tank touches the wall is 0,0, and the graph is marked in unit
squares.

Then, if the tether is just long enough to allow the goat to reach the
point on the tank diametrically opposite the origin, the length of the
tether is by definition 1/2 the circumference of the tank (any shorter
and he can't reach that point, any longer and he can go past it) or
pi*radius.

Assume the tank is 20 feet in diameter; the radius is therefore 10
feet, the circumference is 32.8 feet and 1/2 the circumference is 31.4
feet. Therefore, if the tank is 20 feet in diameter, the tether is
31.4 feet long.

When the goat is at the diametrically opposite point of the tank, with
the tether at full extension, he is at 20,0.  When he is at the wall,
with the tether at full extension, he is at 0,31.4.

Rplace the wall with a paint line that the goat can cross freely. Now
when the points at which his path intersects the x- and y-axes are
plotted they are 20,0;  0,31.4;  -31.4,0, and 0,-31.4.  How are those
four points all on a circle?

Here, I drew a picture...
&lt; http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v234/rabrab/?action=view&amp;current;=go... &gt;

Because of the tank, the area that the goat can reach is part of an
ellipse, not part of a circle.

Well, that makes four wrong shapes I've seen given for the curve.
It's not a circle, it's not an ellipse, it's not a cycloid (although
that was my guess also, until I looked it up, and it's not the evolute
of a circle either (which is just a point).

But the last of those is closest.  What it is is the *involute* of a
circle, which is a spiral.  At the point where the goat is farthest from
the wall, the curve is perpendicular to the circle, not tangential.  See
here: &lt; http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Involute.html &gt; and specifically here:
&lt; http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircleInvolute.html &gt;.  Neither of these
pages gives a formula for area enclosed by part of the curve, though.
And I don't have time now to try my rusty integral calculus on it.

The path of the endpoint of the tether will always continue in
a direction perpendicular to the current direction of the end
of the tether, else the tether will slacken. So at the far side
of the tower, the movement will be upwards, away from the tower,
not tangentially.

Heh. He doesn't, of course,  but, the point I was going after is that
if there's no wall, the shape of the area the goat can reach is a
compound shape, with a semi-circular lower half and a semi-noncircular
shape for the half above the wall.

And I had to do it with geometry because I've never taken any calculus
in my life. &lt;g&gt; I've never even heard the term 'involute of a circle'
before.  So I missed that the goat's perimeter was a segment of a
spiral, rather than ellipse, but I was still close: when I plugged in
numbers, I got a ratio of grazeable land to area of water tank as 1.07
to 1, and I was working with pi to only two decimal points.

&gt; You can visualise the integral if you imagine the wall along the x

&gt; the origin. Its length is pi. Along the x-axis it is unencumbered; as
&gt; it sweeps through an angle of pi/2, more and more of it is taken up by
&gt; the arc-length along the outside of the silo--this arc-length is 2
&gt; theta. Proving that the arc-length is 2 theta was the tedious part for
&gt; me; there might have been an easy way to show it but I just cranked

I solved this problem my own way without peeping Phil's solution.  It
turned out that the answer including the steps were the same - pi^2/6.

Let r be the radius of the tower.
Length of the rope = pi * r

When part of the rope touches the tower then the length can be
expressed as
r *   where   is the angle measured at the centre of the tower

The length of the rope not touching the tower is equal to
L = pi * r - r *   = (pi -  ) * r

If the cow moves d  then the increase in area
dA = L^2 / 2 * d  = (pi -  )^2 r^2 /2 * d
A = int[0..pi] (pi -  )^2 r^2/2 d
= pi^3 r^2/6

Area of tower = pi r^2

I'm a bit late to the party here, but since there seem to be multiple
answers offered, I'll add my own to the mix, along with what I think is
a very simple approach...

Consider the area swept by the tether as it wraps around the silo.  For
any infinitesimal increment in the amount of wrap, from angle e to e +
de, the area swept by the remaining tether of length L(e) is: 1/2 L^2 de
(easily obtained by treating the infinitesimal sector as a triangle and
applying A = 1/2 b * h).  Then since L(e) = (pi - e) R, we have:

dA = R^2/2 (pi - e)^2 de

Integrate from e = 0 to pi to get:

A = R^2 pi^3 / 6 = (pi^2/6) * (pi R^2)
