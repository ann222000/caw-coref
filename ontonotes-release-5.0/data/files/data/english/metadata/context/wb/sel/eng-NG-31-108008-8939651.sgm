i added MLF culture and nutrient at the end of fermentation. Actually,
after week 2 of skin contact.  The temp was in the 70s and we pressed
3 days after innoculating.  it has been another 3 weeks since and each
week we have tasted the wine we taste no fizziness at all that I would
normally associate with MLF.  There are no bubbles in the demis or the
airlocks.  The temp of the room is now mid 60s. We have 5 secondaries
that all taste the same.  With each day they are less tart tasting,
however.  Is MLF happening? I haven't racked yet, and was hoping to
wait for MLF to finish. How can I tell. - thoughts?

Thanks.Marc

You can get ML chromatography test kits or Accuvin test strips from
major winemaking stores if you want to be sure, bubbling (or lack of)
is often not a good indicator as it could just be last bit of sugar in
your must. If the wine tastes less acidic, chances are the ML is
progressing fine.

Were your grapes really ripe?? Chances are if they were they didn't
have much malic acid to begin with. MLF might have finished already.
Like the previous post said, you could check that. Hopefully you
didn't add any SO2 before the secondary.

They were very ripe, as a matter of fact.  I didn't know that had
anything to do with the amount of malic acid.  To answer you other
question, no, I didn't put anymore SO2 in at press.  I'm going to give
it another week and rack off the lees.  Last year I have equally ripe
grapes and didn't add MLF. We racked off the lees at about 4 weeks
after press - that worked out fine.

So what is the connection of ripeness to Malic acid?

This is copy and pasted from Chapter 9 of Lum Eisenman's Home
WInemakers manual.

&quot;Tartaric and malic acids make up about 90 percent of the total
organic acid content in grapes. Malic acid is found in many different
varieties of fruit, but only grapes contain significant amounts of
tartaric acid. The amounts of tartaric acid and malic acid are about
equal when grapes start to change color and soften (veraison), and the
quantity of tartaric acid remains roughly constant throughout the
ripening period. On the other hand, the quantity of malic acid
decreases as the grapes ripen, and the loss of malic acid results in a
gradual decrease in the total acid content during the ripening period.
In hot growing regions, much of the malic acid is gone by harvest
time. Depending upon the grape variety and the growing conditions,
grape juice contains 1.5 to 5 times more tartaric acid than malic
acid.

In cold viticulture regions, ripe grapes have an acid content ranging
from 0.7 to 1.3 percent. Such high acidity often results in
excessively tart wine. To avoid excess tartness, winemakers in cold
growing regions use special procedures to reduce wine acidity. The
situation is quite different when grapes are grown in warm regions
like the interior valleys of California. Here, the acid content of
ripe grapes often falls between 0.4 and 0.8 percent. Grapes grown in
such warm climates often have too little acidity, and wine produced
from grapes low in acidity is often bland and flat tasting. Besides
producing bland wines, fermenting grapes low in acidity often results
in other problems, and adding acid to grapes grown in warm regions is
a standard winemaking practice. Large acid additions are best made
before fermentation is started.

The acid content of grapes (or wine) is usually measured using a
procedure called titration. Sometimes winemakers call the acid content
&quot;total acid,&quot; but the preferred term is &quot;titratable acid.&quot; Titration
measures the sum of all the different types of acids in the wine, but
the results are expressed as if all of the acids were tartaric acid.
French winemakers use a different convention. They express titratable
acid as if all the acids present were sulfuric acid. These different
customs result in different numbers, and sometimes novice winemakers
are confused by the different conventions. &quot;
