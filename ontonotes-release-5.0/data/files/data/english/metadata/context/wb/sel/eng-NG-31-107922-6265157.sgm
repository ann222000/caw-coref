After running 22 of 25 truck races in 2006 it looks as if team
australia is going to jump into nascar fulltime in 2007. The team has
signed a deal that will put Aussie driver Marcos Ambrose into a Woods
Brother ford for the entire 2007 busch series schedule and would also
provide for at least 2 and up to 10 nextel cup events. Aussie Wines
will be a secondary sponsor on the Kingsford Ford Busch car and the
primary sponsor on the cup car.  If the busch experiment is successful
and there is enough progress in the few cup races to explore moving
fulltime to cup. The price tag should take a pretty good bite out of
the team australia budget.  One has to ask if a cup teams comes into
being, if it means that team australia will cut back on their
participation in another series that has almost zero TV coverage in
America.

No, its a Champ Car team.  But since there have been some much-discussed
team failures in the IRL and since the McDribble has his trolling motor
batteries charged up, he thought it would be fun to post a story of a
successful CC team leaving the series for more money.  But he has no
information on whether the team is actually leaving Champ Car.

Bottom line is that its just a weak attempt at a troll.

Note carefully that this post is not a quote but paraphrased by the
poster.  There's also no indication in the actual article that Team
Australia will actually leave Champ Car, just that it will participate
full-time in the NASCAR Busch Series (soon to be renamed by their new
sponsor) and run a few Cup events.

There's a big difference between this story and the stories about the
IRL team failures.  Team Australia didn't go under as did the ones in
the IRL.  They are just adding participation in the more fertile grounds
of NASCAR.

The reason why there's more fertile ground in NASCAR is that the TG
split has diminished the appeal of open wheel in the US.  Teams in both
series are not getting the same sponsor support and need to look
elsewhere to develop sponsor interest and get their dollars.  Those
teams that are smart will do what's necessary to remain viable.

The failed teams in the IRL must not have had enough smarts or they were
so tightly tied to TG's wallet that they weren't left any options but to
fold up their tent and go home.

I wish the best for team Australia in their new venture and hope for
their continued participation in Champ Car events.

Do not lean on the arrival of the DP01 as evidence of a long term
guarantee of TA plans to stay with CCWS. TA was required to lease/buy
the car to remain in operation until it completes it's evaluation of a
possible Cup team. Truth be known TA will spend more on the few events
attempted in the Cup series than they will spend on CC. It is very
likely that they will also spend more toward their associate
sponsorship of the Busch car than they currently are spending on CC.
They already have more promotional programs going on with a Busch car
that hasn't hit the track than they have had in CC. You can spin it
anyway you wish, but deep down you know there must be concern that if
TA is successful in getting a cup program off the ground, that the
amount of money required and the ROI on the Cup car compared to cc.
Should make so much better business sense that the company would have
to give serious consideration to placing most if not all of it's
promotional money into the Cup team.  Speculation on my part, maybe.
Yet it is speculation based on economic common sense and not blind
faith to any series. As long as you want to rant about series and
failing teams. I noticed that there was a little omission in the
AG/Dario post also. It seems as if someone did not completely list all
the sponsors. Sure they listed Canadian Club and i am sure that the
Argent part of the deal isn't that big of an item. Funny that they also
left Vonage off the list of sponsors. That is a very nice looking
Canadian Club Black and Vonage Orange car. I certainly hope that the
sponsor of the PCM Grand-Am car doesn't have second thoughts of helping
to sponsor the PCM cc team. I would hate to hear that some how the new
CC team at PCM has to make a change of plans just as the Gelles team
did. Did you see how nice the Gelles team's DP01 looked in their shop?
That 's right they sort of cancelled their order and changed their mind
about that didn't they. Seems like the new DP01 really isn't bringing
in the loads of money that ole KK thought. Maybe 1 new team along with
two old teams having to be sold. BTW there is a very nice article on
Stoddart and why he chose to buy into the HVM-CTE team instead of 3
OTHER teams that were for sale. It mentions the teams ability to
operate on a VERY SMALL budget and it also mentions something about the
driver will have to bring something more than JUST MONEY to the team.
So mr F1 has basically said that ride buyers are still a part of the
teams operational plans. This goes hand in hand with what Wiggins said
and i quote ". We've still got to worry about our budget and our
drivers."  I love how some of you thought that just because Stoddart
was a former F1 team owner the sponsorship dollars would just flood in
after he announces his plans to join the series. I guess some of you
forgot that the guy he bought majority interest from was also an ex F1
guy and just being an ex F1 guy doesn't turn a pig's ear into a silk
purse.

OK, I've been exposed.  I admit being an undercover MI5 agent.  We're
targeting all those subversive types in the Irish Republican Legion.

Tony O'George is guilty of crime against humanity.  That famous English
driver, Kosuke Matsuura, and that undercover Muslim cleric Chip Ganassi
have infiltrated the organization.  Their operative contact, posing as a
highly successful series leading race driver, is none other than Ed
Carpenter.  Danica Patrick, actually Michael Andretti's secret gay
brother (Mario doesn't claim him), is also posing as a female driver
servicing the radical Greenpeace activist, Roger Penske.

So the big secret's out.  We're on to these guys.  MI5 at work for you!

I have to ask if some of you have a high fever with your delusions?
Each year you come out with your claims that the IRL is about to
implode and each year you end up wrong. Yearly you make claims that the
CCWS is about to become the dominate force in AOW based on nothing more
than remarks from the CCWS PR department. Each year you are wrong. I
thought the DP01 was going to revolutionize the sport and that stoddart
was the savior. Stoddarts own words do not support that view. When
discussing his investment in HVM-CTE he stated that he chose HVM-CTE
over the 3 OTHER teams, based on their ability to operate best on a
small budget. In his discussion of drivers he stated that the driver
cannot JUST bring money that they must ALSO have talent. Money was not
the primary requirement, but the ability to bring money IS part of the
equations. Any third car is based entirely on either the driver
bringing money or CTE finding some money. How about Wiggins remarks
having to do with his new majority partner. "We must still be concerned
with our budget" So it doesn't look as if stoddart is going to open his
wallet as wide as some CCWS fans thought.

What about the rest of CCWS? Well, it seems as if 2/3 of the field are
still trying to work out deals to be able to run this year. As of today
there may be 6 confirmed car/driver combinations for 2007.  Of course
CCWS fans will deny this. I even had one bragging about a Joyce Julius
Sponsor Report that showed that the CCWS provides a value of around
$120,000,000 for their sponsors. Of course they cannot accept that the
value is about 1/3 of the value that the IRL provides. Nor do they
accept that the value is less than one single cup car, not a cup team,
but a single car. No wonder Team Australia is looking at getting into
cup. Of course let's not forget that Pettit had to purchase another of
those three OTHER teams stoddart was looking at, in order to keep the
team a float.

Top teams in the series working on minimal budgets and relying on ride
buyers. Teams announced as confirmed which later do not come into
being. Almost half the field open to a buyout after the end of the
season. A return on investment for sponsors so low that a single car
from another series provided more value that the entire CCWS.  Yes,
indeed these are the signs of a series that is on the verge of taking
over the America racing world. No wonder Panoz required CCWS to pay for
all the chassis instead of allowing the individual teams to purchase
them from the factory.

Now for the usual responses, Mc Shick, troll, idiot and any other names
some of you use so you do not have to try to dispute any of the
information in a rational way.

Well, you are forgetting that Australia is their home ground, and

Well, the question is which one has better bang for the buck right
now...that
is not so much a given right now...NASCAR has seen HUGE rising costs, and
viewers been flat. So, costs are spiralling out of control, but there is
LITTLE
HOPE for increased money in NASCAR from a TV and sponsorship point
of view (they are already asking too much). NASCAR is maxed out, and
viewership is not going up..but costs STILL are.

Don't think that the NASCAR is
all a bed of roses...and they have SERIOUS challenges ahead...

In champs, we have new races in Europe, a new TV package, and
reducing operating costs for the new cars. Really, now who is
dealing from a full deck of cards here? Who is actually making
a better sales pitch now?

With champs, they experienced nothing but growth for the last 3
years..and next year will continue this process.

What change was that you are talking about??? We can have all kinds
of hope....speculation once again. PCM looked at what champs has
to offer, and jumped on board. You seem to be dishing the fact
of a ALL NEW TEAM. When is the last time you see a ALL NEW
team in IRL????

No one said the car is going to bring in loads of money, but what they
did say is that we get BETTER racing, BETTER CARS, better
safety, and a whole host of innovations in open wheel racing that the
car brings. All of these things mean a lot. At least once again Champs
is investing in the future, and I wish I could say the same about the IRL...

Those new cars DO MAKE the product called champ car better....

first, they new cars will allow standing starts....a great thing to bring to
the higher levels of OW racing in north America.

Further, the cars now have on-board starters. Again, this not only means
less yellows, but has HUGE dividends in track worker safety, as workers
don't have to run onto the track to push start cars. (it will actually save
life's).

the list of the OTHER MANY innovations on that car (such as more down force
being generated from the underside to allow CLOSER racing again is really
amazing). And the new shifting system "aka" f1 type paddles is really nice,
and yet manages to REDUCE the cost of transmissions on the cars by 1/2!!!
(the transmission drop from about $110,000 to about 40,000-50,000.

Actually, he does bring a lot. To purchase a into a team pours millions into
the system. Further, he also brings in new sponsors and connections from
Europe. that is worth its weight in gold. Further, we now have 2 Europe
races as result of his jumping into champs. There is credible evidence that
Stoddard, and the Dutch race, and Verstappin were tied to all of Stoddard
coming over here..and VOS having a ride. So, we adding two new Europe races
here...not exactly a shabby growth idea. Further, this just opens up HUGE
possibilities in Europe, and the Stoddard name is worth gold in that
regards. It is all about brining in fans, and NEW sponsorship possibility.
So, we have two new races on decent Europe tracks...not bad at all! Again,
what is the IRL doing in terms of building new venues, and branching out?
Once again, it is all about the future..and building on that.

If you don't think champs is building a future, then you failed to see what
they done with Formula Atlantics.. They went from 15 to about 26 cars in one
year. And, the first race we had 29 cars start!!!

While the Stoddard deal don't really increase the car count (it actually
might by one), it means a lot to the whole series, and especially champs
expansion plans...

Really, in any race, you have to have a REASONABLE plan for the future. If
you look at what CCWS has done is JUST 3 years, what you do you think the
next 3 years will bring? Hang on...because champs is going places....

What horse would you actually honestly bet on right now?????

Champs is the doing an incredible job..and they only into 3 years!!!!

&gt; &gt; Do not lean on the arrival of the DP01 as evidence of a long term
&gt; &gt; guarantee of TA plans to stay with CCWS. TA was required to lease/buy
&gt; &gt; the car to remain in operation until it completes it's evaluation of a
&gt; &gt; possible Cup team.Well, you are forgetting that Australia is their home ground, and
&gt; further your are forgetting that the champs race in Australia
&gt; draws more people then the F1 race, or even the Indy 500....

&gt; So, it would be quite amazing that Team Australia would pull out
&gt; of the largest HOME venue...... I think not...

&gt; As you said...you are speculation anyway...

&gt; &gt; TA is successful in getting a cup program off the ground, that the
&gt; &gt; amount of money required and the ROI on the Cup car compared to cc.Well, the question is which one has better bang for the buck right
&gt; now...that
&gt; is not so much a given right now...NASCAR has seen HUGE rising costs, and
&gt; viewers been flat. So, costs are spiralling out of control, but there is
&gt; LITTLE
&gt; HOPE for increased money in NASCAR from a TV and sponsorship point
&gt; of view (they are already asking too much). NASCAR is maxed out, and
&gt; viewership is not going up..but costs STILL are.

&gt; Don't think that the NASCAR is
&gt; all a bed of roses...and they have SERIOUS challenges ahead...

&gt; In champs, we have new races in Europe, a new TV package, and
&gt; reducing operating costs for the new cars. Really, now who is
&gt; dealing from a full deck of cards here? Who is actually making
&gt; a better sales pitch now?

&gt; With champs, they experienced nothing but growth for the last 3
&gt; years..and next year will continue this process.

&gt; &gt; Should make so much better business sense that the company would have
&gt; &gt; to give serious consideration to placing most if not all of it's
&gt; &gt; promotional money into the Cup team.  Speculation on my part, maybe.As I said..yes..speculation...

&gt; &gt; sponsor of the PCM Grand-Am car doesn't have second thoughts of helping
&gt; &gt; to sponsor the PCM cc team.What change was that you are talking about??? We can have all kinds
&gt; of hope....speculation once again. PCM looked at what champs has
&gt; to offer, and jumped on board. You seem to be dishing the fact
&gt; of a ALL NEW TEAM. When is the last time you see a ALL NEW
&gt; team in IRL????

&gt; No one said the car is going to bring in loads of money, but what they
&gt; did say is that we get BETTER racing, BETTER CARS, better
&gt; safety, and a whole host of innovations in open wheel racing that the
&gt; car brings. All of these things mean a lot. At least once again Champs
&gt; is investing in the future, and I wish I could say the same about the IRL...

&gt; Those new cars DO MAKE the product called champ car better....

&gt; first, they new cars will allow standing starts....a great thing to bring to
&gt; the higher levels of OW racing in north America.

&gt; Further, the cars now have on-board starters. Again, this not only means
&gt; less yellows, but has HUGE dividends in track worker safety, as workers
&gt; don't have to run onto the track to push start cars. (it will actually save
&gt; life's).

&gt; the list of the OTHER MANY innovations on that car (such as more down force
&gt; being generated from the underside to allow CLOSER racing again is really
&gt; amazing). And the new shifting system &quot;aka&quot; f1 type paddles is really nice,
&gt; and yet manages to REDUCE the cost of transmissions on the cars by 1/2!!!
&gt; (the transmission drop from about $110,000 to about 40,000-50,000.

&gt; All of these new features of the car will  improve the product, safety, and

On the surface you make what seem to be several very logical points to
support your views. As we look a little deeper however there are flaws
that seems to show. Shall we address them separately.

True, Australia is the teams home base and true the weekend event does
draw a very large crowd? On the surface this seems a very strong point
to support your views. As we look deeper we find that recently the
promoters of the event changed the format to see if CCWS did not
survive could they continue with the V8 event as the primary event.
They sandwiched the CCWS event between two V8 events on the final day.
What they found was a much larger percentage of the total crowd watched
the two V8 events and during the period of time the CCWS event went on
the crowds moved about more and took part in other activities on the
grounds. Proof of the promotions view that the V8 event was now being
considered the primary event of the weekend came in the setting up of
the track this past year. The V8 cars preferred that the tire barriers
be wrapped so not to have the barrier separate during an impact. Only
problem was in the past when the barriers were not wrapped a CCWS could
slightly graze a tire in a turn and keep going. Now with the covering
the slightest touching of the covering and the rubber from the CCWS
tire caused the steering wheel to snatched out of the hand of the
driver if he is not holding on correctly and the car would be thrown
into the barrier. The promoters looked at the situation this past year
and had to decide which type cars would get their wish as to the way
the tire barriers were set up. They decided in favor of the V8 cars.

As to your argument that the strong rise in the car count in such a
short period of time showed the growth of the CCWS. True they did
produce a very low cost car that did increase car counts at first. A
few things to notice is that the Atlantic's have got a long history
behind them and have rises and dips in car counts for years. As the
year went by it was easy to see than a fair number of the teams were
just hobby cars for a number of rich playboys and these teams were only
out to have fun and are not serious racers. But using your logic of a
quick increase in car counts. As of today there are 27-28 confirmed IPS
cars for 2007 with a possibility of as many of 30 cars competing at
least part time. Most if not all of these cars are piloted by serious
racers who are looking to move to big time racing. With at most one or
two car owners who drive for themselves and supply a second car for
someone looking to move up the ladder.

If I may return to your home event argument for a moment. Team
Australia already had the home event covered with their V8 program and
based on fan response that is the top event going on during the race
weekend. The reason they got involved in the CCWS program was to get
into the USA market and based on the Joyce Julius Sponsor Report, the
CCWS is a very poor tool to use to get into the market. As I reported
earlier the entire CCWS had a value to sponsors of around $120,000,000.
While at the same a single Nextel Cup car, not a team, but a single
car. Produced a value to sponsors of almost $150,000,000. It is only
logical that the company look to put their advertising dollars into a
vehicle that will produce the wanted results and at this time it does
not look as if the CCWS is producing those results. If anyone wishes to
dispute the information feel free to order your own report and dispute
them. I believe you get access to the report for as little as $35.

Oh, BTW race day attendance for the Australian V8/CCWS event in 2006
was announced as 89,772 with a weekend announced total of 210,988. Last
time I checked the Indy 500 held significantly more than 90,000 for
race day. Please do not ruin an otherwise logically laid out, although
incorrect, argument with such off the wall illogical claims.

One final thing if I may. I do wish to thank you for the mature nature
in which you offered your view of things and the discussion of the
issues without resorting to childish name calling and school yard
behavior as so many others in here have done. It is refreshing to be
able to discuss opposing views in such a manner.

&gt; As we look deeper we find that recently the
&gt; promoters of the event changed the format to see if CCWS did not
&gt; survive could they continue with the V8 event as the primary event.
">

You have to provide a CREDIBLE link to the above speculation...

(not that they changed it..but that they did so against CCWS

Wishes, or overruled them in some way). For all we know, perhaps

CCWS did not even care..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They sandwiched the CCWS event between two V8 events on the final day.
&gt; What they found was a much larger percentage of the total crowd watched
&gt; the two V8 events and during the period of time the CCWS event went on
&gt; the crowds moved about more and took part in other activities on the
&gt; grounds.
">

Again, I don't believe the above. Also, note how you said % here. Well, sure

if you have 3 races in one day, you going work out as a larger % if the

CROWD DOES NOT EVEN LEAVE their seats for all 3 races. That

means 2 races % goes to the v8, and the other 1 race as a % goes to

champs. (man, how stupid do you think I am????). You going to have to

show me that those SINGLE v8 races had better TV, or track attendance

then did the champs race, and you can't do that...

What is really said here is you trying to use trick arguments in your
discussion to prove a point but hide behind the fact of two races in a day.
You seem to "hope" a person like me might not realize what you saying
actually means.

I mean, give me I stinking break here. That higher % number for the TWO v8
races ONE day means absolute bunks.

Do I really have to explain that if you have 2 races in one day as compared
to the other 1 race, that the % would be higher? So what..what exactly is
your point now? This is not only BS on your part, but VERY ROTTEN WAY to
make a point.

You need to show me a report that shows higher attendances, or view ships
for a SINGLE v8 race in the day as compared to the champs race in a day..and
you can't do that, nor do you have the information to back this up.

If I was to speculate, the champs race was likely the highest rated, and
highest attended event for the whole 4, or 5 days..

Why are you trying to prove, or hold up some argument that two races in one
day have more viewers then a SINGLE race in the same day?  You could also
say that about the two practive seeions for champ car then.right?  It is
VERY wrong to try and make a point on such bad numbers. That means you have
a agenda here, and seek to mislead, and misdirect, and misinform people.

Where are you going with this argument?

You don't seek the truth, but seek to BEND it!!!

Again, you have to provide a link that gives ONE BIT of credibility that a
SINGLE v8 race in the day outdrew the champs race in that same day.you can't
show that, and you know it, so, now you resort to some sneaky % shit
argument and tired to pull a fast on the people here.  2 races in one that
that as a % of the crowds being more then one champs race is AN INSANE POINT
to make!!!! IT MEANS NOTHING!!!!!

Got it????

&gt; As the
&gt; year went by it was easy to see than a fair number of the teams were
&gt; just hobby cars for a number of rich playboys and these teams were only
&gt; out to have fun and are not serious racers. But using your logic of a
&gt; quick increase in car counts.
">

Well, says who they are not serous? By what pretext to you become

the lord god judge and jury as to who is a serous racer..and who it not?
People for years stated that Neilson Philippe did not belong in champs, and
was just a rich kid going for a ride (it turns out he is very incredible
talent).

The point I was making (in case you missed it) is that champs is making

a great offer in Formula Atlantics (FA), and people are biting at this
offer. It means that CCWS make some VERY good business decisions in regards
to FA.

And, while we are speculating, so what if some people are there just for

Fun. You mean that dentist that purchased a ride at the Indy 500 some years
ago don't

count either? What kind of pissing match do you really want to get

into about who is serous, and who is not?

This is just insanity on

your part to criticize FA, and make the case that FA growth DOES NOT count.
Give me a stinking break.  Who made you the lord god and judge to come along
and complete dismiss the growth of FA as not being legitimate? Talk about
arrogance on your part.

I sitting here telling about a incredible increase in the success and growth
of FA, and you are sitting here trying to tell me it don't count for
nothing? The FA growth stands on its own right now.

Furhter, FA is steeped in history, and is at the very roots of Open wheel
road racing in North America. The list of people that have passed through
the wheels of FA is amazing, and is who's who of racing.

For sure, FA was in trouble, and really run into the ground. Now that it is
back on track, the future looks bright and impressive.  It only been two
years for FA now..and it only going to get better, and we have a good
sponsor (Mazda) to boot also!

And, FA is continues that long history of bring the BEST LADDER to train and
build great drivers of tomorrow. I am really happy that CCWS owns this
incredible and historic racing serous called formula atlantics. And, they
complete revitalized this series.

Formula atlantics is growing because is now a fabulous ladder to champs. FA
is growing because of a new cost reduced car (and a very nice car with
increased power, and a nice electronics package). And, FA also has a 2
million dollar prize for the winner.

For you to stand here and try and make a case against the INCREDIBLE success
of FA is just too much! There is narrow minded, and then there is people who
you lead to the watering hole..but they just will not drink....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The reason they got involved in the CCWS program was to get
&gt; into the USA market and based on the Joyce Julius Sponsor Report
">

You know the above for sure? Again, you become that lord god mind reader?

You might want to provide a link here. How do you know that TA went to
champs because of the Joyce report? Perhaps TA like to race. Perhaps it was
because Kalcoven is Australian? There are HUGE Australian connections to
champ car right now, and you only answer is that TA read some report, and
then started a team in champs?

It was walker motors sports and Scott Goodyear who in the 1992 indy 500 had
that amazing close finish with Al Unser Jr.

In case you don't realize, Walker motor sports is the SAME team, so, you
must mean that walker read this repot in 1988-1989 when he was running a
Judd Porsche in champ car (CART). So, walker been at this for years and
years. By the way, I own a walker racing pit crew shirt from that 1992 Indy
race if you wondering.  (the blue Mackenzie Financial).

And, just in case you need some help here, the web page link to Team
Australia is walker racing.

Here is there home page:

http://www.walkerracing.com/

So, your speculation is not only wild, but beyond any sense of belief. You
have a complete Walter Mitty imagination. So, T Australia is in champs
because of some Joyce report, but their home page is called WalkerRacing,
and that walker has been in champ car for 16 years now!!!!

So, what exactly year was it that Walker read the Joyce report, and started
a champ car team? He been in camp car for a long time now just in case the
math is beyond your abilites.

Again, please provide a credible link that says the Walker team (now called
Team Australia) started racing because of the Joyce report?

I don't believe this, and again this just sheer wild hearsay on your part.

Walkers bio and the 16 year span can be found here:

http://www.champcarworldseries.com/Teams/Team.asp?ID=19

(at least I provde some links!!)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; While at the same a single Nextel Cup car, not a team, but a single
&gt; car. Produced a value to sponsors of almost $150,000,000.
">

Well, the numbers are large, and again, who arguing that?

The numbers don't mean anything. The fact

of TA leaving, or not wanting to stay in champs has little, or

no relation (or credibility) on your part just "because" NASCAR

has some sponsor value.

Maybe Walker will say in champs because he has been there for 16 years
now...

You see, at least I make a REASONABLE conclusion,  that a guy who has been
in champs for 16 years likely will stick around for a while..and you say it
is all about some Joyce report?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If anyone wishes to
&gt; dispute the information feel free to order your own report and dispute
&gt; them.
">

I not disputing the numbers and marketing information in a stupid report.

On the other hand, I sure as the heck am disputing your wild and speculative
and ridiculous conclusions you make.

You going to have to do some serious digging here to explain this walker
motor sports issue is based on a Joyce report.

In addition, as I said, you fail to address that NASCAR'S numbers are now
flat, and costs are rising faster then the teams ability to raise money.

Champ car on the other hand is on the other side of this curve, and for
their costs....viewer and numbers are increasing, and they are in growth
curve.a better one then IRL or NASCAR right now.

As I said, betting on the NASCAR horse is not so easy anymore....

&gt; &gt; &gt; Do not lean on the arrival of the DP01 as evidence of a long term
&gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee of TA plans to stay with CCWS. TA was required to lease/buy
&gt; &gt; &gt; the car to remain in operation until it completes it's evaluation of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible Cup team.Well, you are forgetting that Australia is their home ground, and
&gt; &gt; further your are forgetting that the champs race in Australia
&gt; &gt; draws more people then the F1 race, or even the Indy 500....

&gt; &gt; So, it would be quite amazing that Team Australia would pull out
&gt; &gt; of the largest HOME venue...... I think not...

&gt; &gt; As you said...you are speculation anyway...

&gt; &gt; &gt; TA is successful in getting a cup program off the ground, that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; amount of money required and the ROI on the Cup car compared to cc.Well, the question is which one has better bang for the buck right
&gt; &gt; now...that
&gt; &gt; is not so much a given right now...NASCAR has seen HUGE rising costs, and
&gt; &gt; viewers been flat. So, costs are spiralling out of control, but there is
&gt; &gt; LITTLE
&gt; &gt; HOPE for increased money in NASCAR from a TV and sponsorship point
&gt; &gt; of view (they are already asking too much). NASCAR is maxed out, and
&gt; &gt; viewership is not going up..but costs STILL are.

&gt; &gt; Don't think that the NASCAR is
&gt; &gt; all a bed of roses...and they have SERIOUS challenges ahead...

&gt; &gt; In champs, we have new races in Europe, a new TV package, and
&gt; &gt; reducing operating costs for the new cars. Really, now who is
&gt; &gt; dealing from a full deck of cards here? Who is actually making
&gt; &gt; a better sales pitch now?

&gt; &gt; With champs, they experienced nothing but growth for the last 3
&gt; &gt; years..and next year will continue this process.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Should make so much better business sense that the company would have
&gt; &gt; &gt; to give serious consideration to placing most if not all of it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; promotional money into the Cup team.  Speculation on my part, maybe.As I said..yes..speculation...

&gt; &gt; &gt; sponsor of the PCM Grand-Am car doesn't have second thoughts of helping
&gt; &gt; &gt; to sponsor the PCM cc team.What change was that you are talking about??? We can have all kinds
&gt; &gt; of hope....speculation once again. PCM looked at what champs has
&gt; &gt; to offer, and jumped on board. You seem to be dishing the fact
&gt; &gt; of a ALL NEW TEAM. When is the last time you see a ALL NEW
&gt; &gt; team in IRL????

&gt; &gt; No one said the car is going to bring in loads of money, but what they
&gt; &gt; did say is that we get BETTER racing, BETTER CARS, better
&gt; &gt; safety, and a whole host of innovations in open wheel racing that the
&gt; &gt; car brings. All of these things mean a lot. At least once again Champs
&gt; &gt; is investing in the future, and I wish I could say the same about the IRL...

&gt; &gt; Those new cars DO MAKE the product called champ car better....

&gt; &gt; first, they new cars will allow standing starts....a great thing to bring to
&gt; &gt; the higher levels of OW racing in north America.

&gt; &gt; Further, the cars now have on-board starters. Again, this not only means
&gt; &gt; less yellows, but has HUGE dividends in track worker safety, as workers
&gt; &gt; don't have to run onto the track to push start cars. (it will actually save
&gt; &gt; life's).

&gt; &gt; the list of the OTHER MANY innovations on that car (such as more down force
&gt; &gt; being generated from the underside to allow CLOSER racing again is really
&gt; &gt; amazing). And the new shifting system &quot;aka&quot; f1 type paddles is really nice,
&gt; &gt; and yet manages to REDUCE the cost of transmissions on the cars by 1/2!!!
&gt; &gt; (the transmission drop from about $110,000 to about 40,000-50,000.

&gt; &gt; All of these new features of the car will  improve the product, safety, and
&gt; &gt; increase brand recognition of champs.  And, the cars look gorgeous, and that
&gt; &gt; will even father &quot;brand&quot; the product as a &quot;superior&quot; product in terms of
&gt; &gt; viewers. You are VERY much underestimating what this car will do for the
&gt; &gt; serous...it does a amazing number of things....

&gt; &gt; What exactly is the IRL doing, or building, or creating as a vision of open
&gt; &gt; wheel racing here? Hum?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess some of you
&gt; &gt; &gt; forgot that the guy he bought majority interest from was also an ex F1
&gt; &gt; &gt; guy and just being an ex F1 guy doesn't turn a pig's ear into a silk
&gt; &gt; &gt; purse.Actually, he does bring a lot. To purchase a into a team pours millions into
&gt; &gt; the system. Further, he also brings in new sponsors and connections from
&gt; &gt; Europe. that is worth its weight in gold. Further, we now have 2 Europe
&gt; &gt; races as result of his jumping into champs. There is credible evidence that
&gt; &gt; Stoddard, and the Dutch race, and Verstappin were tied to all of Stoddard
&gt; &gt; coming over here..and VOS having a ride. So, we adding two new Europe races
&gt; &gt; here...not exactly a shabby growth idea. Further, this just opens up HUGE
&gt; &gt; possibilities in Europe, and the Stoddard name is worth gold in that
&gt; &gt; regards. It is all about brining in fans, and NEW sponsorship possibility.
&gt; &gt; So, we have two new races on decent Europe tracks...not bad at all! Again,
&gt; &gt; what is the IRL doing in terms of building new venues, and branching out?
&gt; &gt; Once again, it is all about the future..and building on that.

&gt; &gt; If you don't think champs is building a future, then you failed to see what
&gt; &gt; they done with Formula Atlantics.. They went from 15 to about 26 cars in one
&gt; &gt; year. And, the first race we had 29 cars start!!!

&gt; &gt; While the Stoddard deal don't really increase the car count (it actually
&gt; &gt; might by one), it means a lot to the whole series, and especially champs
&gt; &gt; expansion plans...

&gt; &gt; Really, in any race, you have to have a REASONABLE plan for the future. If
&gt; &gt; you look at what CCWS has done is JUST 3 years, what you do you think the
&gt; &gt; next 3 years will bring? Hang on...because champs is going places....

&gt; &gt; What horse would you actually honestly bet on right now?????

&gt; &gt; Champs is the doing an incredible job..and they only into 3 years!!!!

I must respectfully disagree with you as far as percentage. It would
not matter if you had 10 CCWS event on the same program or 1, the
percentage does not change based on the number of events on the
program. Percentage is based on the total crowd and not the number of
events on the program. So if you had 1000 people in a section of
bleachers and 90% watched the first V8 race that would mean 900 people
watched that event. If they held two CCWS events that day and 70%
watched the first CCWS event and 75% watched the second CCWS event of
the day that would mean 700 saw the first and 750 saw the second.  This
does not mean 1450 watched the CCWS events, it means 700 of the 1000
people watched the first event and 750 of 1000 saw the second event.
There are still only 1000 people there in that section. The number of
events held does not change the percentage of people watching from
those 1000 seats.

Yes, I know the team is team walker racing, but the money to operate
the team comes from Aussie wines thus the name team Australia. We could
still see walker remain with CCWS if team Australia decided to go to
Nextel cup full time in 2008.  It would just be a very shoe string
operation again just as it was before the sponsorship and the formation
of TA. It is the money that is exploring a possible Nextel cup venture.
While other ccws team went with individual ride buyers, walker went the
team buyer route, selling not only the ride but the teams total
operation in exchange for yearly sponsorship.

As for your link and a quote from the article.
http://www.pitlanepr.com/inpitlane2.nsf/newsarchives?OpenForm

"Will Power will be joined by Ryan Briscoe for this years race which
Champcar organizers hope will revive interest in the Champcars that are
increasingly being seen as a support event to the local V8 Supercars."

The local Aussie fans have spoken and as the article mentioned have
began to think of the CC as the support event. The CCWS event had to be
sandwiched between two V8 events on the final day to prevent the same
thing that happened in Vegas from happening at surfers paradise. If you
forgot, the CCWS bought their way onto the program with the NCT series
in Vegas. When the truck race finished and they began the CCWS event
the crowds began to leave. By the time the CCWS event got to the midway
point over 70% of the crowd had left.
