With only a few enlightening additions added to the book of Obadiah in
parenthesis, one can see how easy the Soviet Zionist takeover of Israel, and
their destruction of Monotheists Christian descendants of Israel fits this
prophecy, if you understand that the Children of Judah was the South Kingdom
of Judea with the capital of Jerusalem was made of two tribes, Judah and
Benjamin, and the North Kingdom headed by on of the two tribes of Joseph,
Ephraim, with ten other tribes, was called Israel, with Samaria as their
capital.

These Zionists casting lots on Jerusalem, are the mount of Esau doing
violence against Jacob

The book of Obadiah.

&quot;The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Adoni of Jehovah of Edom, We have
heard a rumor from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the goyum, Arise
you, and let us rise up against her in battle. Behold, I have made you small
among the goyum you are greatly despised. The pride of your heart has
deceived you, you whom dwells in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is
high, that says in his heart, &quot;Who shall bring me down to the ground?&quot;
Though you exalt yourself as the clean eagle, and though you set your nest
among the stars of Israel, from thence will I bring you down, says Jehovah
If thieves came to you, if robbers by night, (how you are cut off!) would
they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to
you, would they not leave some grapes? How are the things of Esau searched
out! how are his hidden things sought up! All the men of your confederacy
have brought you even to the border, the men that were at peace with you
have deceived you, and prevailed against you, they that eat your bread have
laid a wound under you, there is no understanding in him.  Shall I not in
that day, says Jehovah, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and
understanding out of the mount of Esau? And your mighty men, O Teman, shall
be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off
by slaughter. For your violence against your brother Jacob shame shall cover
thee, and you shall be cut off for ever.  In the days (of WW2) when you
stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive
his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon
Jerusalem, even you were as one of them. But you should not have looked on
the day of your brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither should
you have rejoiced over the children of Judah (in WW2,) the day of their
destruction, neither should you have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
You should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their
calamity, yea, you should not have looked on their affliction in the day of
their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their
calamity, neither should you (Soviet so called Jews) have stood in the
crossways, to cut off those of his that did escape, neither should you have
delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress. For the
day of Jehovah is near upon all the  goyum, as you have done, it shall be
done unto you, your reward shall return upon your own head. For as you have
drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually,
yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as
though they had not been. But upon my mount Zion shall be deliverance, and
there shall be holiness, and the house of Jacob shall possess their
possessions. And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph
a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them,
and devour them, and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau,
for Jehovah has spoken it. And they of the south shall possess the mount of
Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines, and they shall possess the
fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria, and Benjamin shall possess
Gilead.
And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that
of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath, and the captivity of Jerusalem,
which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south. And saviours
shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau, and the kingdom
shall be Jehovah's.&quot;

In service of God and Country

Joseph
