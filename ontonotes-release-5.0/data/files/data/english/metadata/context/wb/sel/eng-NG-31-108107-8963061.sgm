I am leaving this country soon and i cant take my cat with me.  i've
asked friends and called several animal shelters by long island and
queens to take him.  so far, no one and no animal shlters would take
him.  I am leaving in a coupld of days. If i cant find him a place to
stay or a new owner, I would have no choice but to let him go on his
own.

PLEASE, IF SOMEONE KNOWS ANY ANIMAL SHELTER BY NEW YORK CITY THAT WILL
TAKE CAT OR IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN HIM, PLS LET ME KNOW.  I really
dont want to leave him like this.

he is 7 year old male, light orange fur, neutered, domestic short
hair, very gentle and sweet.  loved to be brushed and pet. i dont know
how to post picture, if you want see him, i can definitely email it to
you.
Your help is greatly appreciated. Pls help me to find him a new home.
a million thanks.

Do NOT let him go on his own. That is VERY CRUEL. It is better to surrender
him to a shelter.

I didn't google them. If it is a legit request for help, they have
asked way too late. That's why I said it was a troll, and again, an

Um, yeah! You're going overseas in two days, can't take your beloved cat, so

&gt; Same here. I know enough people in person who do stupid things with
&gt; their pets that frustrate me. I finally had to cut loose a friend who
&gt; breeds her dogs, and its hard to lose a friend but I have values that
&gt; mean something to me. Took a while but it was inevitable.

And you know what, it isn't really stupidity. It's total selfishness.
It's &quot;head up the ass&quot; syndrome. Creatures that are completely
dependent on us take first priority with decent people, whether
human or otherwise. To even consider putting an animal on the
street, pffft. Assholes.

Here are a few that I found on the Internet. I live in the UK, so some
of them might not be valid, but they are definately worth a call. It
is a pity that you didn't ask a little sooner, because people might
have been able to help. @ this late hour, you might find that these
shelters are already full. I hope that you do find somewhere though.

This one has a list of shelters in the area that you asked for

&gt; Put him in your freezer overnight on the evening before you fly out, then

&gt; Lynne, I think a warm cat will probably need more than an overnight

Matthew, there are times that you simply can't help some people,
however hard you try. This is one of them. If she really wanted the
help that she professes to want, then she would have been there
thanking you for the way you put yourself out.(because you did!)

In fact, I don't think if you picked the cat up personally &amp; took it
to the shelter for her, that it would have been the right place, or
even helpful to her. Shrug it off &amp; try not to worry about it ( the
cat, I mean- not her).... If she was bright enough to ask the group
for help, then she was perfectly capable of looking up human societies
in the NY area like I did for her, in the UK!!
Take care,

Perhaps I am being a bit harsh. I am not sure.
That is why I did not dismiss her out of hand. Leaving this problem
until a day or 2 before you depart is a little remiss of her, however,
there might be extenuating circumstances for instance... but that
doesn't excuse not having the manners to thank someone who really did
go against the grain to help out- which you did!

I hope that she has somewhere sorted out too. Having said that, I
hardly think she is likely to come back and tell us though. Some
remarks were a little caustic. I certainly hope that she did manage to
place him.

Frankly, it is very unusual over here not to be able to place a cat in
a place of safety, so it is a little difficult for me to understand
the concept of all of your shelters being full. It must be a dreadful
situation?! I am certain that it will happen one day, we are just
lucky we haven't got there yet.
You tried your very best, that is clear.....

Actually, the cat wasn't her's. It belonged to a friend that she was
trying to help. She still has the 2 cats that Matthew spoke about, &amp;
mentioned are fine &amp; I received photos of them a couple of days ago.

She took Matthews advice &amp; took her friend &amp; the cat in question to
him, but he couldn't take it either because he has no room at all. In
fact, he has asked that people think twice before giving out his
details, before contacting him first. Much as he would love to help
everyone, he can't. He is only human &amp; only has a certain amount of
resources available. In future, he would appreciate it if people would
be kind enough to contacting him first, to see if he can help.
( I know this to be true, because I checked)

I know that we get a lot of Trolls that stop by here simply to cause
havoc, &amp; also that it can be hard to sort out the real people that
need help, from the idiots who call by to cause trouble- But we should
have the good grace to give them a chance before dismissing them out
of hand.

You might even say that is a bit rich coming from someone who has had
plenty to say in the past, because I have! The difference is, that I
have learned my lesson, &amp; I have learnt to give everyone the benefit
of doubt, before condemning them. I lost a good friend by doing
exactly this, &amp; I can assure you that it wasn't worth it.

Most people who come here, are genuine, &amp; do not deserve the stick
that she got. Of course she won't come back!

Would you?

&gt; &gt; Put him in your freezer overnight on the evening before you fly out, then
&gt; &gt; pack him in a box with dry ice, and ship him to your new home.  Priority
&gt; &gt; Overnight is best, but it may be okay to go with 2 Day Air if you're
&gt; &gt; strapped for cash.  If he's fat, you won't need as much packing material,
&gt; &gt; but be sure to insulate him from the dry ice.  Do you have one of those
&gt; &gt; vacuum sealer bag thingies?  (For the cat, not the dry ice.)

&gt; &gt; Thaw him out slowly when you get there so he isn't scared when he comes
&gt; &gt; back to life.  Problem solved!

&gt; You are pathetic!

I sat here for an hour before posting because I knew that the
consequences of what I had to say would probably make me very
unpopular. In the end, I decided to post, mostly because it needs
pointing out. When I made mistakes, there were no end of people ready
to point out the error of my ways, &amp; they were right to.
I had far too much to say &amp; hurt people with my sharp tongue.
Reprimanding me made me look @ myself, &amp; examine what I was saying &amp;
why as well.

It taught me what humility meant &amp; to think how others feel before
shooting my mouth off- Or at least asserting whether I am being
presented with the &quot;Real facts&quot;.
I hope you understand that my comment is only to remind us all that
people do make mistakes, &amp; we are here to advise, rather than
reprimand before helping the cat(s) in question. There is time for
that later, after the cat has been taken care of.

If this makes me unpopular, then so be it.

Hi

Just read this thread and was shocked by the opening part about 'freezing'
your cat.  Thought it was OTT but I read it to my husband and the thought of
putting our 4 babies in the freezer is awful.
All our cats are great by the way!!!

Shame that there are some people out there that can't take cats to there next
destination - I can only agree with what Sheelagh has said.

Has it all been sorted now?  Nice of you Sheelagh to give the info you have.

take care
Clare

&gt;is a pity that you didn't ask a little sooner, because people might

I don't think anyone would come to this group &amp; say something like
that, because she is leaving herself open to criticism. Anyone who
does that is either desperate, or stupid &amp; Judging by the evidence, I
don't think she sounds stupid.

If you treat people with that kind of cynicism is very unlikely to
come back &amp; take another kicking, are they?
What message does this send out too?
I thought people came here for advise, not to be abused verbally.

&gt;&gt; Ok  still on a sugar rush from my cookies

&gt;&gt; I goggled her email I don't think it is a troll just someone desperate
&gt;&gt; Either way I emailed Phil- Hide quoted text -

&gt;&gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; I agree.

It turns out that the other posters were WRONG this time.  Sheelagh has
already said what happened but it is too late now.  At least the young lady
thru private email told us what was going on.  Phil even told me what was
going on thru private email.  The others owe her an apology but we know that
will never happen.

Always treat it as it is true but the others have gotten too cynical and
always assume the worse.  This time it slapped them in the face.

I'm new here, and really have no right to comment on what has
transpired re: this thread, but, I feel that I must reply.  I formerly
did animal rescue---though not for the last twelve years.  I
discovered during the period of time that I rescued, that often,
people would hang on to their pets until the last minute, because they
desperately hoped that their situations would change.  *Maybe the
landlord will let me keep my pet after all.  Maybe I won't have to
move. etc.*  It would have been grossly unfair for me to question
their motives for doing so and to refuse to help, not only to them,
but to the animal in question as well.  Thank you Matthew, Sheelagh
and Paul, for your helpful suggestions, and the kindness that you
offered to this woman.  Matthew, I posted my thanks to you privately,
but just wanted to give you a public thank you as well.  You have a
wonderful heart.

Grace

You are welcome Grace  If you tried to send something to my email that is a
debunked email.  I hide it due to the a@@hole trolls here.

You have every right to comment.  I am ashamed and annoyed with the other
posters right now.

I know you are right about the animal rescue.  I have experienced this many
of times.  No matter what anyone wants to think giving up your animal is
giving up your child.  No one wants to do this.  It is the hardest thing to
do or even comprehend. If anyone thinks it is easy they need to be flogged.

It is always the best bet to assume they are genuine and not every one is
like the punk Pac man player.

&gt;&gt; I don't feel slapped in the face.  My post was obviously not
&gt;&gt; serious, but had it been, I would have told her that she is an
&gt;&gt; irresponsible asshole who doesn't deserve the company of cats
&gt;&gt; EVER AGAIN.

&gt;&gt; I hope that cat is safe now.  ANYTHING is better than being with
&gt;&gt; someone who would leave him loose on the streets because she's
&gt;&gt; too stupid to have made proper arrangments before leaving the
&gt;&gt; fucking country.

&gt; Exactly. I think most people here know that neither of us would
&gt; tell someone to freeze their cat and really mean it. Matthew's just
&gt; trying to stir up trouble. Must be a slow day.
