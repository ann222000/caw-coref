Timmins traveller has burning memories of wildfires in Greece

As the wildfires spread in California, for one Timmins couple it
brings back first-hand memories of the devastation left in the wake of
similar wildfires in Greece.

News of the wildfires in Europe first blazed across newspapers in late
June. Thousands of firefighters and soldiers worked around the clock
to battle the hundreds of fires that raged across forests, farmland
and brush and literally consumed numerous small villages that stood in
their way.

&quot;My wife and I have been to quite a few places including Korea, Japan
and every European country and we've never seen anything like this,&quot;
said Ron Zgud, while poring over his collection of photos from his
month-long journey through Greece.

&quot;It was easy to see the destruction caused by the fires.

&quot;But, what was odd was that nothing was burned to the ground, rather,
everything was scorched and charred and orchards were damaged just
enough to know that they could never recover.&quot;

Zgud and his wife, Angela, began their Greek excursion from the city
of Patra after being ferried there by boat from Italy. It was their
goal to work their way south along the coast until they had completed
a loop of the country.

&quot;We rented a car and headed south from Patra to Olympia, birthplace of
the ancient Olympics, where we first started to see signs of the
wildfires,&quot; Zgud said, relating the story about how one of the fires
reached Ancient Olympia, burning trees and shrubs near the museum
inside the 2,800-year-old site.

&quot;We went there to see the Olympic torch, which is lit every two years
to mark the beginning of the Olympic Games,&quot; said Zdug. &quot;I looked out
beyond the walls and could see the scorched mountainsides all around
us.&quot;

It wasn't until they reached the village of Artemissia, in the
Taigetos mountains, that the real impact of the wildfires started to
set in, Zdug said. Vast swaths of the country, particularly in the
south, were obliterated by the flames. In fact, the worst of Greece's
fires had been concentrated in the mountains of the Peloponnese in
southern Greece.

&quot;We covered well over 3,000 kilometres during the trip and seeing this
destruction wasn't in our plans, but that was where the road took us,&quot;
he said. &quot;At one time, these small villages were filled with olive
groves, livestock, fruit trees and small vineyards but that was all
destroyed by the time we drove through. The saddest thing was knowing
that these villagers depended on those olive groves and livestock to
live.&quot;

What's more disturbing, Zgud said, was the thought that many of the
fires were set deliberately. He said residents he had talked to
believed the fires were set as a means to

The fires, he said, were all situated in rural areas in the mountains
where it would be difficult to fight them.

&quot;(Arson) is the impression we got from the people we talked to,&quot; Ron
said. &quot;Whomever was setting these fires knew the larger cities would
have the resources to fight them and that it would take days to
extinguish a fire in a remote area. There must have been a method to
their madness.&quot;

Many people, Zgud said, laid blame on socialist leader George
Papandreou. But he wasn't the only one to escape criticism. Polls
indicated growing anger with the conservative government for
mishandling the firefighting efforts.

Such accusations forced Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis to promise
the equivalent of C$18,800 in aid per family.

&quot;There were 4,000 homes and buildings destroyed and 76 lives lost
during the week of wildfires,&quot; Zgud said. &quot;It was estimated that 2.2
billion (Euros) worth of damage was caused and the livelihood of
hundreds of people lost.&quot;

Zgud said leading up to his departure for Greece, second thoughts had
crossed his mind about actually going. However, he said he has no
regrets and he and his wife plan to return to Greece in the years to
come to see how well the country has recovered.
