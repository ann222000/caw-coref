On Miscellaneous Subjects

Like stones rolling down hills, fair ideas reach their objectives
despite all obstacles and barriers. It may be possible to speed or
hinder them, but impossible to stop them.

The struggles waged by nations are weak only when they lack support in
the hearts of their women. But when women are moved and lend help,
when women, who are by nature calm and controlled, give encouragement
and applause, when virtuous and knowledgeable women grace the endeavor
with their sweet love, then it is invincible.
