Part II
Chapter I. The Story of the French Countess.

THE London season was over, and the seaside season in England,
and the gambling and flirtation season in continental Europe, had also
closed. The stately old country-houses were assembling their inmates
for Christmas; the weather was seasonable-i. e. very delightful for
rich people with every sort of outdoor pleasure and indoor luxury at
command, and productive of intense suffering to tbjg, poor who lacked
all these things-and sport had been capital at Burnham, where the heir
and his wife were passing the Christmas holidays.

The family-circle has lost one member since the day on which
Adeline de Beaucour had been added to it. Lady Madeleine Raby had made
a prosperous and happy marriage,-under the auspices of Lady Burnham,
who had been quite the fashion during the season,-and was at present
abroad with her husband, the Honourable Mr. Charter. Lady Burnham
missed her very much, and found that her mother's and sister's
presence only increased the loss; she was decidedly bored, for the
first time since she had come to England. Lady Blanche had almost made
up her mind, since Madeleine's marriage, that she was called to a more
active participation in the ministry of the Reverend Josiah than the
selecting of his texts and the revising of his sermons, and was
setting about the &quot;breaking&quot; of this conviction to her parents by a
rigid disregard, indeed condemnation, of all the light and worldly
distractions implied in conformity to the rules of society, and a
severity of demeanour which Lady Burnham could neither propitiate nor
understand. The few ladies staying in the house were &quot;county&quot;
magnates; and the young Frenchwoman, cleverly as she had adapted
herself to English society, and well as she understood it, considering
how brief her  opportunities had been as yet, found that particular
phase of it which they personified out of her reach for the present.
She was polite and attentive to them, but she had little notion at
times what they were talking about, and she perceived clearly that
they never entirely ceased to regard her as an intruder into the
sacred caste of the aristocracy. &quot;It is all very well for poor dear
Lady Marlesdale to insist on the +de,+ you know; and, of course, in a
certain sense Lady Burnham +is+ of the nobility,&quot; Lady Daylesford
remarked to Mrs. Joyce Stratton; &quot;but it is only foreign nobility
after all-so different from +ours.+ Mrs. Joyce Stratton entirely
agreed with Lady Daylesford, as befitted the intellectual calibre of a
lady who, had she been told that one of Adeline's ancestors was a
French knight who had fought at Agincourt, would have failed to see
the argument for her nobility because he was not an Englishman. While
these worthy persons were possessed by the belief that Adeline Burnham
was not quite noble enough, they were not free from an uneasy
suspicion that she was a little too clever for their society. They
could have got over her beauty, but her talent, her fascination-for
she possessed that indefinable gift in fullest perfection-these were
too much for them; and Lady Burn-ham knew it; and was amused, but
decidedly bored. She did not see much of Burnham, who was an ardent
sportsman, and a popular man in the county, where it was his business
to make himself liked just now, as it was his ambition to represent it
in Parliament at the next vacancy, which was likely to take place
soon. In this, as in everything else, his wife sympathised with him;
and she was very careful to hide from her husband that she was bored,
philosophically considering that it could not last, and solacing
herself by writing long and amusing letters to Lady Madeleine Charter.

It was the beginning of Christmas week; the snow, which had been
falling lightly for some days, was frozen, and the weather had reached
a point of &quot;seasonableness&quot; which precluded outdoor amusements, except
to such hardy individuals as professed a taste for the noble art of
skating. Burnham Castle had its full complement 'of Christmas guests,
and they were sometimes a little heavy in hand, and gave the Countess
some trouble in their management-trouble which she sustained
nevertheless with indefatigable courage, for the sake of her pride and
her son.

A portentously long morning had been beguiled by a visit to the
picture-gallery, of which Lady Burnham had done the honours. She had
no knowledge of art, but she had an unlearned taste for pictures, and
she had taken some pains to make herself acquainted with the valuable
though not extensive collection at Burnham Castle. Lady Madeleine's
remark upon her likeness to the portrait known as that of &quot;the French
countess,&quot;-but unmentioned in the catalogue pretentiously inscribed on
vellum and kept in the library,- had not escaped her at the time; and
she had afterwards asked her. sister-in-law who the &quot;French countess&quot;
was, and whether there was anything remarkable in her story, purposing
to inspect the portrait on her return to Burnham, and see what she
thought of the supposed likeness. But Lady Marlesdale had been
beforehand with her sou's wife. Some inexplicable feeling, an impulse
which she did not care to define, had induced her to caution her
daughter.

&quot;You said a thoughtless thing, Madeleine,&quot; she remarked; &quot;you
should not have mentioned the resemblance, even if it exists. It is
bad taste to make Lady Burnham aware that we think her like the only
female ancestor of our family of whom we have any reason to be
ashamed, the only one with whom an unpleasant tradition is connected.
If she asks you anything about the matter, turn it off as well as you
can, and tell her you don't know any of the particulars of the story
of the French countess.&quot;

&quot;I don't know much about her in reality, mamma,&quot; said Madeleine
in a provokingly-careless tone; &quot;not much more than that she was the
original of the Burnham ghost.&quot;

&quot;Don't talk nonsense,&quot; said Lady Marlesdale, displeased; &quot; and
mind you don't let such an expression slip before Lady Burnham.
Remember she is a foreigner, and likely to be superstitious.&quot;

&quot;Very well, mamma,&quot; said Lady Madeleine; then she added, when
Lady Marlesdale left the room, &quot;I know someone who is superstitious,
and about the Burnham ghost too, and who is not a foreigner.&quot;

Nevertheless, Lady Madeleine obeyed her mother; and when Adeline
asked her the meaning of the observation she had made, she gave her a
careless general reply, to the effect that the likeness was not much,
bat the resemblance in her attitude and manner of holding back her
dress was remarkable; and that &quot;the French countess&quot; was a lady of
that nation who had married a Lord Marlesdale in the time of Charles
the First.

&quot;We were not earls then,&quot; said Lady Madeleine; &quot;she was a
countess in her own right.&quot;

&quot;What was her name?&quot; asked Lady Burnham.

&quot;I forget,&quot; said Madeleine. &quot;I have heard it; but whenever she is
mentioned-which is not often, for we don't care much to talk of her -
she is called the French countess.&quot;

Months elapsed after that conversation before Lady Burnham
returned to Burnham Castle; but she had not forgotten the
circumstance, and she took an early opportunity of inspecting the
portrait in question. She recognised the likeness at once: it was no
fancy of Lady Marlesdale's or of Madeleine's; and Burnham recognised
it also. But while Adeline was pleased and flattered, for the beauty
of the French countess was very striking, her husband's indifference
piqued and provoked Lady Burnham.

&quot;I do believe,&quot; she said, &quot;you have a touch of your mother's
notions on this point, and would be delighted if I could be proved
like any of those pretty dolls of Englishwomen, with their china-blue
eyes aad their silly simpers.&quot;

&quot;Indeed you mistake me,&quot; said Lord Burnham earnestly. &quot;The only
woman as beautiful as you-if indeed she was that, and I doubt it-who
ever belonged to our family was that lady whom you are strikingly
like; but she brought disgrace and shame with her, Adeline, an£ there
has been little of them in the history of the Burnhams. You can
understand now, my darling, why we do not much like the mention of the
French countess, and why my mother, in particular, dislikes it.&quot;

&quot;Tell me the story,&quot; said Adeline imperiously; &quot;sit down here,
and tell it to me at once. I want to hear it; I must hear it.&quot;

She looked so beautiful, so engaging, so delightful, in her
playful imperative ways, and with her brown eyes sparkling, partly
with curiosity and partly with scorn, that he could not resist. All
his own reluctance, and the reluctance of his mother, were forgotten
in the impulse he felt to give pleasure to his young wife, and he
said,

&quot;I will not tell you the story myself, Adeline, because I should
only spoil it; but I promise you shall hear it, well told, on
Christmas-eve, with all the effect due to a ghost-story.&quot;

&quot;A ghost-story! Is there a ghost, then, attached to the picture,
as well as the coincidence of my likeness to it?&quot;

&quot;There is,&quot; said Burnham rather seriously, &quot; and Crawford is the
only person I know who can tell the story. So you shall hear it on
Christmas-eve, just at the witching hour. My mother has a horror of
its being told, but she will never know.&quot;

Lady Burnham thanked her husband with a sparkling smile. There
was the slightest touch of mischief in it, but he did not perceive
that; and she protested he had given her a fresh interest in the old
house.

&quot;Even when I found out there was some delightful absurd mystery
about a picture, I was far from imagining I should be so fortunate as
to come upon a ghost into the bargain. Does Lady Marlesdale believe in
the ghost?&quot;

&quot;I rather think she does implicitly,&quot; said Burnham demurely.

&quot;How delightful!  And the pious and exemplary Blanche?&quot;

&quot;And the pious and exemplary Blanche.&quot;

&quot;+Quel bonheur!+ And you, my dear, dear Burnham, I will give you
sixteen kisses this very minute if you also will confess to believing
in the actual ghost of this identical French countess.&quot;

&quot;I think I could undertake to profess any amount of faith for the
same consideration,&quot; said her husband, laughing; &quot;but seriously, or as
seriously as possible, to be near the truth, I think I do believe,in
the ghost of the French countess, or, as they call her, .hereabouts,
'the Brown Lady.' &quot;

*        *        *        *        *        *        *

There had been a dinner-party, and the picture-gallery was
lighted; but the guests were assembled in the drawing-room, and the
family portraits had the gaslights all to themselves, when two women
emerged from the door communicating with the library, and placed
themselves opposite the portrait of the Brown Lady. They were Lady
Burnham and her maid, Zelie Huret, known to the household as the
&quot;mamzell.&quot; They talked together in subdued tones, and minutely
inspected the picture, looking at it from different points, and
occasionally laughing in a suppressed but confidential fashion. Lady
Burnham made some memoranda on a sheet of paper, which her maid put in
her pocket; then they left the gallery as quietly as they had entered
it. .The servants' wagonette was ordered to be in readiness on the
following morning, to take the &quot;mamzell&quot; to the train for London; and
the &quot;mamzell&quot; gave no further explanation of this unseasonable journey
than that she was going to town on business for her lady.

*        *        *        *        *        *        *

At a little after eleven o'clock on Christmas-eve, when the grave
and elderly portion of the guests at Burnham Castle,-not to be
beguiled by any sentimental ideas of hearing even Christmas chimes at
midnight, -had retired, a select party occupied Lady Burnham's
boudoir, where a superb fire and brilliant clusters of wax-lights
formed comfortable accessories to the correct and sensational
narration of the ghost-story. The party consisted of Lord and Lady
Burnham, Captain Crawford, and Sir Cecil Morse his particular friend,
and a respectful but ardent admirer of Lady Burnham, whom he lost no
opportunity of declaring to be &quot;a stunner.&quot; Adeline occupied a low
chair at the side of the fire; the light of the dancing flames played
upon the folds of her dress of rich blue satin and lace, and found a
thousand reflections in the jewels on her neck and arms. She was
looking down at Burnham, who was lying on the hearthrug, his head
supported by her footstool, and her little Skye-terrier nestling in
his arms. Sir Cecil sat opposite to her; and the story-teller walked
up and down the room, in which exercise he found much assistance and
delight.

&quot;Now then, Crawford,&quot; said Burnham, &quot;begin. We are all ready--and
I am in a delightful situation for shivering.&quot;

&quot;Don't spoil the effect of my story by your chaff,&quot; said Captain
Crawford. &quot;I address myself solely to her ladyship.&quot;

&quot;I am listening,&quot; said Lady Burnham.

&quot;The legend of the Brown Lady of Burnham is in this wise,&quot; began
Captain Crawford. &quot;In the evil days of Charles the First, the earldom
of Marlesdale did not exist; but there had been Barons of Marlesdale
time out of mind, good men and true for the most part, and loyal alike
to their friends, their country, and their king. The women who had
come into the Marlesdale family by marriage or by birth had all been
handsome, as your portrait-gallery testifies-and virtuous, as the
family annals boast. But no woman married or born among the
Marlesdales had equalled in beauty and fascination the bride whom
Jocelyn Lord Marlesdale wooed and won at the court of the French
queen, Henrietta Maria. Tongues wagged when the bride came home to
Burnham, attended by a brilliant company from London, for she was a
foreigner and a widow.&quot;

Lady Burnham looked up suddenly, and made Captain Crawford feel
rather awkward; he remembered that the listener was also a foreigner.

&quot;A widow, you say,&quot; she asked him, &quot;and a foreigner? Was she a
Frenchwoman?&quot;

&quot;She was,&quot;-Lord Burnham answered the question;-&quot;her name was
Marcelline de Senaart.&quot;

Lady Burnham said no more, and Captain Crawford continued: &quot;The
new Lady Marlesdale was popular with her London friends, and her
husband had an infatuated love for her, which shut his eyes to her
faults and induced him to gratify every wish she formed. Her wishes
were neither few nor moderate, and Lord Marlesdale's fortune soon
proved inadequate to their demands. Lady Marlesdale, the French
countess as she was called, was the most extravagant woman at the
court of Queen Henrietta Maria, and her extravagance in the
expenditure of money was not the only charge brought against her by
the country neighbours of Jocelyn Lord Marlesdale, who envied her for
the gay and brilliant life which was beyond their reach, and hated her
because she disliked and despised them, and suffered her lord to pass
but few and brief periods of his life at Burnham. The portrait in your
picture-gallery, which represents the French countess in the zenith of
her beauty, was painted by a famous court-painter, one Antony Vandyke,
in the third year of her marriage, when rumours had begun to circulate
about an estrangement between her and her husband, mainly caused, it
was said, by the determined enmity of Charles Raby, Lord Marlesdale's
brother, who held his beautiful sister-in-law in abhorrence, which
people were apt to say had had its origin in her rejection of him in
favour of his elder brother. Be that as it may, Charles Raby hated the
French countess, and betrayed to her husband, either personally or
through his agents, the fact of her infidelity. The lover for whom the
French countess deceived her English lord was a countryman of her own,
a dissolute young noble, who had come to England in the Queen's train,
and had enjoyed much of the Queen's favour. Indeed, when the case,
fully made out, was laid before Lord Marlesdale, he had the clearest
conviction that the Queen, his loyally-served master's wife, had been
a consenting and assisting party in the dishonour that had been
brought upon him. The first step taken by Lord Marlesdale was to
withdraw from the court. This he did at some risk to his reputation;
for the troubles of the monarchy, the downfall of the King, were
beginning, and it was a time when it behoved true men to stand fast by
that which was falling. But Lord Marlesdale cared nothing for that-his
life was centred in the beautiful base woman who had been false to him
always, from the beginning. He challenged the man who had wronged him,
and ran him through with his sword: this occurred on the old Christmas-
day-the 6th January-as we style it now. The French countess was in
attendance on the Queen at the time, and knew nothing of what had
happened until a page brought her a token at supper, and she opened
the packet laughingly, amid somewhat jeering comments on the devotion
of her lord. It contained a few lines, in which he bade her farewell
for ever, and a kerchief of her own, which her lover had worn, steeped
in his heart's blood. Lord Marlesdale lived openly and unmolested at
Burnham; no effort was made to call him to account; the scandal was
too flagrant. The King attempted to induce Henrietta Maria to send her
infamous favourite back to France; but in vain.    The Queen's enemies
said she was in the power of the French countess, and did not dare to
act against her; at all events, she did not visit her in any way with
her displeasure; and when the swift-coming great trouble rose around
them all like a tide, and the Queen returned to her own country, as it
proved, for ever, Lady Marlesdale went with her.    She was talked of
sometimes in the land she had disgraced and left, and to her was
justly imputed the blame  of Lord Marlesdale's absolute inaction in
the troubles of the great rebellion. He lived at Burnham, and steadily
abstained from any participation in the strife; the consequence of
which was, that he suffered from both parties.    King Charles even
made personal overtures to the sullen broken-hearted man in vain.  To
all taunts concerning his dead-and-gone loyalty, he was content to
reply with quiet acquiescence that it was dead and gone; and when an
emissary from the King demanded an explanation, he could get no other
answer than, 'Let his Majesty ask his own wife and mine.'   He lived
always at Burnham, a very quiet life, seeing no one but his brother,
who, a few years after Lord Marlesdale's misfortune, married a quiet
woman, if one may judge by her blue-eyed portrait on the left of that
of the French countess, and who certainly left no personal history to
swell the family traditions.  Lord Marlesdale never took any further
interest in politics or public affairs, and even showed no emotion on
hearing of the execution of the King. He took to studious pursuits,
and nursed the estate carefully.  When things were tolerably settled,
and the Protector was giving promise of a long and prosperous tenure
of power, Charles Raby began to visit London a good deal, and to
depart from the family tradition in politics, finding favour in the
sight of the chief of the Commonwealth.  He was an ambitious man, and
his silent moping brother interfered in no way with him, and let him
do as he liked with the revenues of the estate.  After a time it began
to be whispered about,-no one being able to say where the rumour
originated,-that demands had been made on Lord Marlesdale for money,
on the part of his wife, and that the Queen and her friends were all
in poor circumstances in France.  These demands, it was said, Lord
Marlesdale had been disposed to accede to; but his brother had
scornfully derided such weakness, and reminded him of what this woman
was, in the plainest terms.    Then the broken man yielded, and a
stern refusal was sent to the envoy of the French countess-a slight,
dark-complexioned person, distinctly foreign in appearance, who lodged
at a small hostelry a mile from the gates of Burnham;-the railroad
passes over the site of it now.  The man received the message and went
away.  A week later, Lord Marlesdale found a folded paper on his desk,
fastened with a silken string, and addressed to him.   A few words
were written inside: 'The next time I ask you for aid, it shall be in
person, and I will not take an answer from the man who slandered me,
and laid your life waste, that he might make his inheritance sure.'
The reading of this paper so shook the nerves of Lord Marlesdale, that
he had an illness, during which his brother took precautions to
prevent his being reached, either personally or by letter, without his
(Charles Baby's) knowledge. Time passed on, and the story of the
French countess's message was almost forgotten, when a fresh rumour
arose, to the effect that Burnham Castle was haunted. Lady Marlesdale
was dead, intelligence of her death had reached England, and her
husband had seen her ghost. He was dying slowly of fear, they said,
and the 'French countess ' walked in the picture-gallery every night.
Being questioned by the parson, Lord .Marlesdale, with much hesitation
and evident suffering, acknowledged that he had seen the phantom of
his wife three times, on each occasion in the same place and under
similar circumstances. He seldom left the house now, and it was his
custom to walk up and down the picture-gallery in the short twilight
of the winter evenings. He declared that on the three occasions named,
he had seen the door at the end of the gallery, opposite to that which
communicated with the right wing of the castle, open, and the figure
of his wife, in the dress and attitude of the portrait which you know
well, appear. The phantom came towards him, Ipoking straight before
it, and holding back the satin train with the precise gesture in the
picture.   On each
occasion he had shrunk back against the wall, and the figure had
passed him noiselessly, and disappeared through the door communicating
with the left wing of the castle. Two of the servants also stoutly
maintained that they had seen the ghost, but it was after dark, and
they declared that it had flitted along the now unused corridor,
outside the deserted rooms which had formerly been the private
apartments of the French countess. The stir caused by all these
stories was the greater because Charles Eaby had gone to London some
time before, and his wife was much alarmed and distressed at her
solitude, being then expecting the birth of her first child.
Communication was slow in those days, and the fear which the report of
the castle being haunted had excited, had reached panic-height before
Charles Raby was informed of it. But when he heard the news his rage
knew no bounds, and denouncing the whole thing as an infamous
jugglery, vowing vengeance on its authors, and stigmatising the
parson, who had addressed to him a grave and lengthy epistle
concerning the revelations made by Lord Marlesdale, as an old fool, he
travelled down to Burnham with all possible speed, bent on punishing
everybody who presumed to believe in the ghost.

&quot;He found  his brother much too ill to be bullied about anything,
the servants  sulky and frightened, his wife dreadfully afraid of the
Brown Lady, but still more afraid of him; and he could get no coherent
account of anything that had happened. He was,very weary too, and made
up his mind to postpone any action in the matter until the morrow.
Eeassured by her husband's presence, and suffering more than usual
from an excessive drowsiness which had frequently overpowered her of
late, the gentle little woman slept heavily. But sleep would not come
near Charles Raby. His time of triumph was very near; his brother was
evidently dying-childless and rich; yes, thanks to his care and
management, very rich. A large sum of money in gold was in his valise
then, interest he had been paid in London on certain moneys he had
lent for the secret service of the Government, and a quantity of
jewels which had been given him as security for another sum.

&quot;When he came to fill his brother's place, should he cease to
practise usury, he asked himself. He thought not; it was a good thing,
and a happy, in any station, to be much richer than people supposed,
than even the nearest and dearest knew. He would put his foot on all
this idle silly gossip, arising from the feeble confusion of his poor
brother's dissolving brain, to-morrow, and then look at his bright
prospects.-You smile, Lady Burnham, because I am telling you the man's
thoughts; but the story is his own.-Thinking thus, he dozed; the light
which burned by his bedside grew dim, and unconsciousness came, but
only for a brief space. As he grew drowsy he fancied he heard the
faintest rustling, like the trailing of a dress upon a matted floor.
His momentary doze was dispelled by the consciousness that there was
someone near; he opened his eyes, and saw the Brown Lady,-saw her
distinctly at his bedside, a couple of feet removed from him, her head
held up, her brown hair falling on her shoulders, two red roses in her
right hand, and her satin train held back by the left. He looked at
her, and she looked at him with the beautiful brown eyes he had so
loved and hated, while his heart beat as if it would choke him, and
his limbs grew heavy and cold. As he looked she glided away, and was
lost in the darkness behind the heavy velvet curtains of the bed.
Terror held him motionless for a little, and then, when it released
him, he started up and looked eagerly around. There was nothing there.
Then apprehension and pity for his wife kept him quiet, fierce thirst
seized upon him, and he drank off at a draught the large cupful of
spiced wine which, according to the fashion of the time, had been set
ready for him. The draught soothed him strangely; he began to feel a
curious numbness, and then came nothingness; but he solemnly declared
afterwards that, while he yet retained a little of his senses, he
heard a low, short laugh.

&quot;With the morning, horror and anguish came to Buruham Castle.
Charles Raby was found in frightful agony, succeeded by paroxysms of
delirium, and the physicians-not easily to be got at then, fetched
with the slow haste of those days-were puzzled by the case, as our
wise men might be now. It looked very like poisoning, they said;
at all events it was hopeless, and in that they were right. Charles
Raby died on the following night, having told, in the intervals of
relief which came to him, the. story I have now told you. His son was
born upon the day of the funeral, and succeeded Jocelyn Lord
Marlesdale in three months. He was a splendid fellow in his time, and
the first earl.&quot;

&quot;And his mother?&quot; asked Lady Burnham.

&quot;She lived long and happily,&quot; said Captain Crawford, &quot;and left in
writing, together with a goodly stock of household recipes, and one
invaluable prescription for a cosmetic known as the 'Burnham
beautifier,'. -in which, however, you will never require to feel an
interest-a prosaic but very probable solution of the mystery of the
Brown Lady's appearance.&quot;

&quot;Any explanation spoils the story,&quot; said Lord Burnham;
&quot;nevertheless, tell it.&quot;

&quot;When Charles Raby's death gave the bewildered household leisure
to attend to anything, some strange discoveries were made.  The valise
which had contained the gold and jewels brought to Burnham by Lord
Marlesdale's brother was empty. Gems and other valuables had been
abstracted from the cabinets in Lord Marlesdale's apartments, and the
long-disused rooms of the French countess had evidently been ran-
sacked; laces, dresses, and ornaments had been removed.  When full
search had been made indoors, they proceeded to inquiries without, and
ascertained that the dark-complexioned man of distinctly-foreign
appearance, who had acted as the .emissary of the French countess when
she made her vain application to her husband, had again appeared in
the neighbourhood of Burnham, this time accompanied by a stout serving-
man, and having in his possession three fine horses, of which one
carried the baggage.    Their arrival had been simultaneous with the
journey of Charles Raby to London, and they had taken their departure
at daybreak on the morning after his return, long before any
intelligence of the trouble at the castle had penetrated to the
village. No suspicion attached to them, no effort was made to trace
them; but the narrative of Charles Raby's widow declares, that these
two men took shipping for France from Southampton, and that on the
night after they sailed the ship was wrecked in the Channel, and many
of the dead bodies washed ashore.  One of these was discovered to be
the corpse of a woman disguised in male attire; and though it never
was identified, and the woman and child on whom the station and the
responsibility of the Marlesdales had devolved were too weak and too
timid to investigate the matter which concerned them so nearly, at the
cost of angering great personages in France, the widow never had any
doubt but that the drowned woman was Lady Marlesdale.-You understand
it all now, Lady Burnham, of course, and see how easily so infernal a
device might have been carried through when communication between
England and France was slack and vague. Besides, there is a good deal
in wishing a thing which one hears may be true.    The false news of
the French countess's death had been too welcome to be received with
distrust. -My story is told, Lady Burnham: I hope you are pleased.&quot;

But Adeline looked serious and perplexed.

&quot;So it was not a ghost after all; only a living woman, who robbed
and murdered? But how, then, do people still believe in the ghost? Why
do they say she walks in the picture-gallery every year at Christmas-
time? And why, may I ask, Captain Crawford, is this story supposed to
be your especial property?&quot;

&quot;I will answer your ladyship categorically,&quot; said Captain
Crawford. &quot; People believe in the ghost because, in the first place,
they have heard the story, and not its explanation; and in the second,
because they prefer to believe in it. They say the ghost walks in the
picture-gallery at Christmas-time because it is pleasant and exciting
to say so, and quite the correct thing for a country house. But they
believe it too. I venture to say you would find it difficult to
persuade any of the party assembled in this house to-night to go into
the picture-gallery alone after dark, especially on Twelfth-night.
Finally, the story is mine because the first earl's mother was also my
mother's ancestress, and some of her papers are still in the
possession of my family.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Captain Crawford; you have thoroughly satisfied my
curiosity.&quot;

&quot;And tired her out,&quot; said Lord Burnham, scrambling up from the
hearthrug. &quot;Come and have a cigar.&quot;

Left by herself, Lady Burnham sat in the same attitude by the
boudoir fire. But her face was thoughtful, and her eyes were bent on
the red-hot cavern formed by the glowing coals.

&quot;How very strange!&quot; she was thinking; &quot;I might have known all
this, if papa had ever thought our old family history worth looking
into. I wonder what our version of it is; brutal ill-usage on the part
of the +mari anglais,+ no doubt, and splendid devotion to the fallen
fortunes of the daughter of Henri Quatre. Marcelline de Beaucour,
Comtesse de Senaart-bow very, very odd! It would never do to let Lady
Marlesdale know that I have a good right to resemble the portrait of
the French countess. Shall I tell Burnham? No, not yet; it would spoil
the fun. How much amused he will be! And Captain Crawford-how
delightful if he is persuaded into believing in the ghost!&quot;

The thoughtfulness was gone, and her bright face had no look in
it but of girlish glee as she summoned Zelie, and proceeded to impart
to her as much as she thought fit of the story of the French countess.

*        *        *        *        *       *        *

&quot;Rather awkward, wasn't it, Craw?&quot; said Sir Cecil Morse to
Captain Crawford, after Lord Burnham had left them, and they were
fondly lingering over the ashes of their cigars and the embers of the
smoking-room fire.

&quot;What?&quot; asked the Captain curtly.

&quot;The explanation to Lady B. about the queer countess being a
Frenchwoman, eh?&quot;

&quot;Well, it was a little; fact is, I forgot  about herself for the
minute. Jolly woman, Cecy; not a bit superstitious. I don't know that
it would do to tell her the other tag to the story, though.&quot;

&quot;What's the other tag?&quot; asked Sir Cecil in a sleepy tone.

&quot;Just this: people who believe in the ghost have it that, as the
succession from father to son was broken by the first importation of a
foreign wife among the Marlesdales, so it will go away from this
branch altogether by a second. Shouldn't like to try her nerves with
that, eh?&quot;

&quot;+I+ shouldn't mind,&quot; said Sir&quot; Cecil; &quot;she's much too plucky to
care-a stunner like her!&quot;

Chapter II.
TWELFTH-SIGHT.

THE Christmas festivities at Burnham Castle were on a splendid
scale, and eminently successful. Guests staying in the house, and
those w,ho came to the long succession of dinner-parties, were alike
gratified.  Public opinion was decidedly in favour of Lady Burnham.
Sir Cecil Morse found a unanimous consent among the gentlemen to his
proposition that Lady Burnham was &quot;a stunner,&quot; and she made progress
in the favour of all, with the exception of the Countess and Lady
Blanche. With the former she made no way, and the latter regarded her,
from the far-removed level of her own sanctity, as an objectionable
person, who was fortunately rich.  Lord Marlesdale &quot;took to&quot; his
daughter-in-law even more decidedly than he had done in the summer,
and his wife had sufficient sense not to desire that her own prejudice
should be shared by others.  But that prejudice remained unshaken. The
Countess had not been well lately, had been &quot;nervous,&quot; and so gave way
to it, and brooded over the unpleasant association of ideas which had
established, itself in her mind with Lady Burnham's presence.  The
unconscious Adeline was obnoxious to her ladyship for another reason,
in addition to her likeness to the wicked and beautiful French countess
-her lamentable religion, and her &quot;independent ways;&quot; which latter,
though Lady Marlesdale did not even theoretically object to pride as
manifested by persons of condition, were especially unpleasant when
they became the medium of expressing entire though scrupulously-polite
indifference to the magnificent mother-in-law who did not happen to
like her.  Adeline would have been glad if she had liked her,-as she
did not it was a pity; but that was all about it.  The matter eost
Lady Burnham few regrets, and she had not again mentioned it to her
husband.  But she had not the least notion that Lady M-arlesdale chose
to resent the fact that there was not as yet any prospect of an heir
as a grievance; and that, in some extraordinary conglomeration of
prejudice and dislike, she cherished an idea that it was all the fault
of Adeline's being a foreigner.  Respectable Christian women, who
belonged to county families and valued their privileges properly,
stayed at home, and had children decorously and duly; but of course
these flaunting foreign women cared only for their pleasures, and were
incapable of making any sacrifice to duty or to health. This when her
daughter-in-law was making herself agreeable with all her might to
Lady Marlesdale's guests, and when she was the very picture of
blooming, radiant health. The truth was, Lady Marlesdale remembered
the superstition concerning a second foreign marriage in the Raby
family, and she allowed it-half ashamed of herself for doing so the
while-to prey upon her mind.

Lord Burnham was very, busy. There was little doubt that he would
be the successful candidate when the next election for the county
should take place. His wife did not miss him so much during the long
hours of the day as she had done immediately after their return to
Burnham Castle. She was preoccupied about something which evidently
amused and interested her. The mamzell associated but little, for many
days after that unexpected journey of hers to London, with the other
servants, and on the rare occasions when she did make her appearance,
she was at once inquisitive and reticent- reticent about herself and
her lady, inquisitive about the family history, and especially about
the family ghost. The infidelity of foreigners, in every station of
life, was too well known, too thoroughly understood, among the
servants at Burnham, to admit of their feeling any surprise when the
mamzell announced-on being told the story of the Brown Lady, with many
amendments and additions-that she did not believe in ghosts, that she
never had believed in them, and never should, unless she should happen
to see one, which she did not think at all likely. The servants'-hall
company could not agree with her; nothing would surprise them less
than that she should see the ghost, the identical Brown Lady herself;
their private opinion being that, as a foreigner, she might appear to
a foreigner; which of course no English-born ghost of good family
would condescend to do. The mamzell heard this flattering prophecy
with a sneer, and thus provoked the indignation ,of the servants, who
prized the Burnham ghost as the most ancient as well as the most
interesting in the county.

*        *        *        *        *        *        *

The party assembled at Burnham for the celebration of the good
old festival of Twelfth-night was unusually numerous and lively. It
included many young people-for whom the attractions of drawing for the
king, snap-dragon, and dancing were provided-the. staying company in
the house, and some officers, friends of Sir Cecil Morse and Captain
Crawford, who had thought it well worth their while to run up from
Portsmouth for a few days; not a little incited thereto by Sir Cecil's
animated description of Lady Burnham, of whom he said, &quot;If she's a
stunner in town, by Jove! where there are other women to be seen-and
nobody will deny it-she's simply an out-and-outer in a country house,
where there's a lot of old women, and that dreadful Blanche Raby,
enough to make a fellow bilious to look at her, by Jove!&quot;

In the smoking-room on the night before Twelfth-day, Lord Burnham
being absent, Captain Crawford told the story of the Brown Lady once
more, and with great success. The officers from Portsmouth were quite
pleased, and almost excited, by the narrative; and one, a young
lieutenant, who imagined himself an authority on beauty and style, and
who believed, in his honest and simple conceit, that no woman, not
even the &quot;match&quot; of the Brown Lady herself, could possibly resist him,
proposed an adjournment +en masse+ to inspect the famous portrait. But
Captain Crawford opposed this proceeding, on the grounds that the
house was all quiet for the night, and of course the gas had been
turned out in the picture-gallery. With the majority of the little
party this argument succeeded, and the notion was abandoned ; but
Tommy Toxteth was not to be persuaded.

&quot;Bother the gas!&quot; said the youth; &quot;come along, Crawford; let the
others stay here-they've seen the picture, and I haven't; I have never
been through the gallery at all. Let's take a candle apiece and go-the
Brown Lady will look all the more ghastly, or ghostly, in the dim
light.&quot;

&quot;By Jove!  you're  developing, Tommy,&quot; said Sir Cecil  Morse;
&quot;you're actually displaying imagination!  What next?&quot;
&quot;Don't bother,&quot; returned the lieutenant; &quot;come along.&quot; Captain
Crawford enjoyed, and deserved, the reputation of a very good-natured
sort of fellow, and he rose, though rather lazily, to comply with
Tommy Toxteth's request.  The two made their way to the staircase, at
the foot of which one door of the picture-gallery was situated.  The
candles they carried gave but a dim light in the large, empty space,
and Tommy Toxteth declared he already felt &quot;creepy,&quot; when Captain
Crawford opened the door, and they entered, the gallery-just in time
to see a woman's figure vanish at the opposite end.  The lieutenant
started violently, and tumbled up against Captain Crawford, who, not
so much disconcerted, but still not completely unmoved, caught him by
the arm, and said,

&quot;Take care; you'll drop the candle.&quot;

&quot;Bother the candle !&quot; returned Tommy; &quot;did you see that?&quot;

&quot;I saw a woman, certainly-one of the servants, I suppose.&quot;

&quot;Do you?  Why do you speak in a whisper, then?  And why does any
servant in the house wear a brown dress with a train?&quot;

&quot;Are you certain of that?  The .gallery is long, and the light is
dim.&quot;

&quot;I am perfectly certain, and I have remarkably good sight.&quot; Tommy
Toxteth leaned most unceremoniously against one of the family
portraits as he spoke, and rubbed his evening-dressed shoulders
against the white-satin knee of a Raby of the time of George II.
Captain Crawford looked at him blankly.

&quot;I say,&quot; said Tommy, &quot; we shall get preciously chaffed if we let
out that, having come to look at the portrait, we have seen the ghost.
Come and let's have a peep at the picture, at all events.&quot;

Without speaking, Crawford advanced to the portrait, and the two
men held the lights they carried so as to show it to the best
advantage. The picture looked even more life-like in the feeble light
than in the brightness of the gas jets. The proud, beautiful face; the
bright, yet soft and speaking eyes; the graceful figure, which seemed
coming forward to meet the gazers-all had a striking, an overpowering
effect, which told on the young lieutenant, though he did his best to
throw it off. They looked at the picture for some time, but in
silence, and when they turned away from it and left the gallery, they
still did not speak, until they had reached the first landing on the
stair.

&quot;All a fancy of ours, of course,&quot; said Crawford; &quot;either a mere
imagination, or a clever housemaid, who chooses the unfrequented
gallery for a rendezvous with her footman lover.&quot;

&quot;Why did we not see the footman lover, then?&quot; asked the
lieutenant, with more presence of mind than was habitual to him; &quot;and
how do you explain the dress?&quot;

&quot;You must have imagined the dress,&quot; said Captain Crawford.

&quot;And you the footman,&quot; returned the lieutenant.

More time than they had supposed had elapsed while the two had
been absent, and they found the smoking-room forsaken by all but Sir
Cecil Morse and a middle-aged individual of no particular persuasion
or profession, who was an inveterate smoker, and liked his cigars in
company. Mr. Netterville never left the smoking-room until everyone
else had departed, and would endeavour, by every device of good-
fellowship, to keep the last of the +habituès+ up &quot;just ten minutes
longer.&quot; Mr. Netterville had been acting the &quot;demmed fascinating
rattlesnake&quot; in the case of Sir Cecil Morse; bnt that baronet was on
the point of making his escape when Captain Crawford and Tommy Toxteth
returned to the smoking-room. Delighted at the idea of detaining them
there for a while, he affected great interest in the story they had
heard, and the portrait they had gone to see, and plied them with
questions. But neither responded according to his wont. Captain
Crawford's manner had not its usual ease, and Tommy Toxteth was
deficient in fluency. Sir Cecil remarked this, and said carelessly,

&quot;What ails you both? Anyone would think you had seen a ghost!&quot;

&quot;I am not sure that we have not,&quot; said Tommy Toxteth, &quot;and the
ghost too.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; said Sir Cecil, with an incredulous grin, &quot;the Brown Lady
herself?&quot;

&quot;Yes, the Brawn Lady herself.&quot;

&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said Sir Cecil; &quot; why, I thought you did not believe
in it, Craw ?&quot;

&quot;So I thought myself until to-night,&quot; said Crawford; &quot;and I am
not quite sure that I do believe in it now; but, on the other hand,
I'm not quite sure that I don't.&quot;

Mr. Netterville and Sir Cecil insisted on an explanation, which
the others gave; and the surprise caused by the story was all they
could have desired, had they been telling it for effect. Mr.
Netterville was fully gratified that night; the sitting lasted until
even he had had enough of cigars and conversation. The two men who had
or had not seen the ghost were remarkably unimaginative, and the more
they discussed the matter, the less they could believe that they had
only fancied what they had seen, 'but the less also they liked to
subscribe fully to belief in the supernatural. No satisfactory
conclusion, therefore, was come to, and it was Mr. Netterville who
suggested that the truth might be tested by watching for the ghost on
another night.

&quot;Unless the Brown Lady is very much altered for the better,&quot; he
said laughing, &quot;she is not likely to miss a chance of being seen.&quot;

&quot;And let me tell yon,&quot; said Tommy Toxteth, with a dismal attempt
at a joke, &quot;to see even the ghost of such a woman as the Brown Lady,
is not to be sneezed at.&quot;

&quot;What a tremendous admirer of beauty you are, Tommy!&quot; said Sir
Cecil; &quot;it might be enough for you to have the chance of looking at
Lady Burnham every day for a week.  If you want a real live stunner,
there's one for you.&quot;

&quot;For you you mean,&quot; said Tommy, trying to disguise nervousness
by affected facetiousness.

&quot;Suppose we all watch for the Brown Lady to-morrow night,&quot; said
Sir Cecil; &quot; it's Twelfth-night, the time she is said to appear quite
regularly. If she does, we'll agree not to be in the least frightened;
and if she does not, to set down Craw and Tommy for a pair of
poltroons.&quot;

&quot;Agreed,&quot; said Mr, Nettervillc; and he then added reflectively,
&quot;What a deuced unpleasant thing for a family it must be to have a
hereditary ghost~ If I had one, which I have not-the Nettervilles. are
not important enough for that-I should have had a shot at it long
ago.&quot;

&quot;A shot at it!&quot; exclaimed Crawford-&quot;a shot at a ghost!&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied Mr. Netterville; &quot;if such things exist, why
not learn all there is to be learned about them? It is a popular
belief, quite as profound as belief in the existence of ghosts, that
if you see one, and fire at it with a bullet-I am not sure whether the
bullet must be silver, but I think not-it will never appear again; a
cheap and simple remedy for intrusive spirits. You say Lady Marlesdale
has a great dislike to the Burnham ghost; why has she not tried this
method of appeal to the superstition of the servants and other people
who believe in it and persuade themselves they have seen it? They
would believe in the efficacy of the shot as much as in the presence
of the Brown Lady, and the Burnham ghost would be most effectually
laid.&quot;

&quot;Nobody would venture to mention the subject to Lady Marlesdale,&quot;
said Captain Crawford; &quot;and I am sure she never heard of the notion of
firing at a ghost; I never did, though I have read and heard enough
about them.&quot;

The conversation among the gentlemen was not much more prolonged;
but before they finally parted for the night, they determined on a
plan of action which should solve their own half-admitted doubts, and
be a curious experiment in ghost-lore. The last words spoken among the
party were the following:

&quot;Mind, not a hint of it must reach her ladyship; it would give
her mortal offence,&quot; said Crawford.

&quot;Of course, of course,&quot; said Mr. Netterville; &quot;we shall be most
careful, and we shall have all the servants on our side; it will be
such a glorious chance for them to be comfortably frightened in good
company.&quot;

&quot;But suppose we see it, and fire, how about the noise?&quot; asked
Tommy Toxteth.

&quot;She'll never hear it,&quot; said Sir Cecil; &quot;her rooms are away in
the right wing; and even if she does, she'll think it's only getting
rid of a charge-or a poacher,&quot; he added with much gravity.

*        *        *        *         *          *         *

A humble but very comfortable and convivial imitation of the
symposium above-stairs had taken place on this night in the servants'-
hall. It was unanimously agreed that the appearance of the Brown Lady
on the following night would be very becoming indeed - in, fact, a
delicate attention on the part of the Burnham ghost, favourable to the
dignity of the family, and convincing to the ignorant obstinacy of
foreign persons, &quot;who hadn't got no family, and consequent couldn't be
expected to have no ghostes belongin' to them.&quot; The party was very
valiant indeed, in its collective capacity, declared that it desired
nothing better than to see the Brown Lady, and to make its deposition
to the fact &quot;in a lump.&quot;

&quot;Not as that 'ud signify, Mr. Mills,&quot; said the head-housemaid to
the under-butler; &quot;for people as don't believe the Bible don't mind
what's swore on the Bible.&quot;

*        *        *        *        *         *        *

There was only one drawback to the success of the party at Burn-
ham Castle on the following day-the absence of Lord Burnham. He was
unavoidably detained at the county town on business. He was the most
sedulously attentive of husbands, as all agreed; and each of the young
ladies secretly hoped, when the time came for the fulfilment of her
destiny, she might find a +parti+ so eligible in all respects. Lady
Burnham announced at breakfast that she had had a letter from her
husband, full of apologies and regret. At luncheon she mentioned that
she had received a telegram confirming the impossibility of Lord
Burnham's reaching the castle in time for dinner; and while the latter
gorgeous solemnity was in progress, a second telegram was handed to
her, which she read aloud.

The message was: &quot;It is barely possible I may catch the last
train. Do not expect me before to-morrow. Do not send to the station.&quot;

The Countess of Marlesdale preserved a grim and contemptuous
silence while this message was read and commented upon. Her son had
never thought it necessary to keep her so well-informed of his
movements. To her mind there was something slavish in this extreme
observance. This foreign woman had not only married but bewitched him.
She glanced furtively, with eyes full of grudging dislike, at her
daughter-in-law. Adeline had never looked more beautiful; never been
in more radiant, captivating spirits. The Lady Blanche looked at her,
also askance, and felt &quot;thankful,&quot; as she told herself, &quot;that her
Josiah would never have to know that his Christian wife was showing-
off in his absence, and attracting the attention of the whole of the
company.&quot; Perhaps the Lady Blanche had never so little regretted that
her Josiah felt it more consistent to decline being present at the
great entertainments given by the Earl and Countess, as on this
occasion. The Reverend Josiah erred on the side of charity, Blanche
thought; was too apt to make allowances, even excuses, for Lady
Burnham, and displayed an entirely uncalled-for solicitude for her
conversion. That evening, Adeline captivated everybody all over again.
She was richly and tastefully dressed, in a fashion hopelessly
inimitable by any milliner of English growth; and she seemed
unconscious alike of her beauty, her dress, and her triumph.

&quot;It's the only time, I can say with a clear conscience, I ever
wished Lord Burnham to remain away,&quot; said Lady Burnham to Zelie, when,
the dinner being over, and the party assembled, for the recreations
proper to the evening, in the saloon, she contrived to escape to her
own rooms for a short colloquy with her maid. &quot;It would have been
difficult to manage about him, and, he might have spoiled it all
unintentionally. All is quite safe, I hope; Parker has no notion of
joining the servants, and there's no fear of her ladyship sitting up?&quot;

&quot;Not the least fear, my lady. Mrs. Parker despises all the
servants except Samuel; and if she could have kept him from watching
for the ghost with them, she would have told of the servants to her
ladyship: but she couldn't persuade him.&quot;

Here Zelie smiled a queer smile, which, being interpreted, meant
that the &quot;serious&quot; footman had yielded to persuasions administered in
the shape of taunts from quite another quarter; and that Parker
couldn't tell of the others without getting him into trouble;
&quot;There's no fear of her ladyship; she'll go to bed as usual.&quot;

&quot;And the gentlemen are quite determined? There is no danger of
their giving it up?&quot;

&quot;Not the least, my lady. It's all settled with Mr. Mills.&quot;

&quot;I must go back, lest I might be missed. Everything is ready?&quot;

&quot;Everything.&quot;

Zelie threw open the door of Lady Burnham's dressing-room, which
was brilliantly lighted.

She looked in, laughed, gave a satisfied nod of her sunny brown
head, and ran lightly down-stairs.

The evening wore gaily away. The mimic sovereignty awarded when
the Twelfth-night cake was cut and apportioned was fully enjoyed; the
carpet-dance was lively, if not very long; for Twelfth-day fell on
Saturday, and the rules were strict at Burnham Castle. At half-past
eleven &quot;good-nights&quot; were exchanged; the ladies retired, and the
majority of the gentlemen sought the smoking-room.

&quot;How wonderfully beautiful Lady Burnham looked to-night!&quot; said
Sir Cecil to Tommy Toxteth, as he followed Captain Crawford and Mr. .
Netterville to Elysium.

&quot;Didn't she, by Jove!&quot; assented Tommy. &quot;I never saw a more lovely
face; and, it's very odd, I have been puzzling myself all night to
find it out, and I can't hit it off;-I have seen someone she is so
marvellously like.&quot;

&quot;Have you?&quot; said Sir Cecil, with calm and dry incredulity. &quot; I
never saw anyone like her, and don't expect.&quot;

*        *        *        *        *        *        *

The numerous clocks in the house and offices had struck twelve,
and an apparent but deceitful quiet reigned in the castle, when
Captain Crawford, Mr. Netterville, Sir Cecil Morse, and Tommy Toxteth,
attended by Mr. Mills, and followed on tiptoe by a few of the other
male guests at Burnham, took their way to the central hall. A number
of servants, silent and motionless, were assembled there. The order of
proceeding had been so carefully settled beforehand that there was
nothing to be talked about, and the strictest silence prevailed-
silence which permitted the hurried breathing of the women to be
audible. The three doors which communicated with the picture-gallery
had been left ajar, and the gallery was dimly lighted by a few gas-
jets, turned down to not much above the point of extinction.

Captain Crawford and Tommy Toxteth passed into the library by a
door opening into the middle of the hall, and took up a position
behind that which communicated with the picture-gallery. Sir Cecil
Morse and Mr. Netterville passed into the great dining-room by a
similar door on the other side of the hall, and took up a position
behind that which communicated with the picture-gallery. The other
gentlemen, with all the servants standing close behind them, placed
themselves at the central door, which led from the hall into the
picture-gallery, and was opened to its full extent, its two +battants+
laid back against the wall.

These operations had been performed without the aid of any other
light than that which the dimly-burning gas in the gallery afforded,
and the scene was an impressive one.

&quot;The mamzell isn't here,&quot; said one of the servants in the lowest
possible tone to the &quot;serious&quot; footman.

&quot;Hush!&quot; whispered Samuel, &quot;she will be here directly.    She
can't get away until her ladyship is undressed.&quot;

He had hardly spoken, when a light figure crossed the dim hall
with noiseless step, and a touch on the sleeve of the &quot;serious&quot;
footman's coat made him aware of Zelie's presence.

&quot;Is your pistol ready?&quot; whispered Crawford to Tommy Toxteth, as
he took him gently by the shoulders, and placed him in the narrow
opening of the door on the left. &quot;Face that way, and cover that end.&quot;

&quot;Which way is she said to come?&quot; asked the lieutenant in a less
heroic tone than he could have wished.

&quot;No one knows, as we already told you; so there's an equal
chance for both.&quot;

An almost identically similar dialogue had taken place in the
great dining-room, where Sir Cecil Morse and Mr. Netterville were
posted. Mr. Netterville faced the door on the right, at the end of the
gallery, the staircase immediately outside which communicated with the
right wing of the building, containing the Countess's apartments.

&quot;It is settled that we give the ghost till +one,+ isn't it?&quot; said
Mr. Netterville. &quot;Quite long enough, I think; the servants might be
persuaded they had seen a dozen by tht time.&quot;

&quot;Hush!&quot; said Sir Cecil; &quot;don't whisper. If any of the ladies are
up, they might think it was thieves.&quot;

Dead silence.   Waiting.   Something like genuine awe among the
servants. Something not altogether like incredulity among the
gentlemen.    Perfect stillness among all.  The women's cold hands
grasp the men's, and they stand very close together, and have strange
lumps in their throats, and shivers through their limbs; and there is
not one of them but knows if she tried to speak she could not do it. A
quarter-past  twelve. Dead  silence. Waiting. Then  the  sudden,
horrible howling of a dog, which makes the women start and catch their
breath, and  some of them feel, that if they were not afraid of the
gentlemen, who are watching intently, and whom, such is the power of
their caste, they dare not, even for terror's potent sake, disturb,
they would run away, if indeed their limbs would carry them; but, if
they should not, then it would be a relief to drop down where they
stand.

Dead silence. Waiting.

But there was a slight noise which, if every ear were not
painfully strained in one direction, might have been heard.    From
Lady Burnham's boudoir a glass-door opened on a light iron stair
leading to the flower-garden, which in the summer had formed her chief
pleasure at Burnham. The slight noise above mentioned was caused by
the unlocking of this heavily-curtained door, and the entrance into
the warmed and lighted room of no unauthorised intruder, but of Lord
Burnham. He had caught the last train at the last minute, and had
walked over from the station, guided by the cold wintry moonlight, and
taking a well-known short cut which brought him to the flower-garden.
He looked across it, saw the lights in his wife's rooms, and decided
on letting himself in by the side-door, and enjoying her delight and
surprise. She was still up, he knew, for he saw a shadow passing back
and forwards once or twice as he crossed the garden. He opened the
door, pushed the curtain aside, and looked eagerly into the room.
Adeline was not there, He locked the glass-door, and went into the
dressing-room, which was in great confusion but empty; then into her
bedroom, with the same result.

&quot;She hasn't come up,&quot; he thought; &quot;they are in the saloon. I wish
she had been here; I don't want to go down-stairs;&quot; and he went
irresolutely into the corridor. No lights, no servants about. He took
a wax-light from Adeline's dressing-table, and went quickly towards
the saloon, which was empty. &quot;They must be at supper in the dining-
room,&quot; he thought. Then he crossed the saloon with a hasty step, and
went out of the door which opened on a corridor communicating with the
staircase of the right wing. The wax-light in his hand burned dimly,
and nickered as the draught from the closing door caught it, but the.
light sufficed to show Lord Burnham that he was not alone. From the
far end of the corridor into the centre of which he had emerged,
something came towards him, something which chilled his blood and made
his heart stand still-^something in human shape which yet was not
human, which was the form of a beautiful womau and yet was no woman.
An awful phantom, with a shadowy face, as of a woman with brown bright
eyes and rich brown hair, heaped up from the broad brow, and falling
on bare polished shoulders, majestic yet terrible, for the luminous
form had the semblance of substance, and yet had it not, and sight of
it had the dread and agony of death without peace, or sanctity, or
anything but fear. The phantom came towards him, walking, but not as
living beings walk; the movement was not a movement of the limbs^ but
was an onward sweep as of the wind. The awful presence was clothed in
phantom garments, of rich, trailing brown satin; the train was held
aside by one hand, and a foot shone beneath the skirt, a motionless
foot which yet was borne along, and on which diamonds gleamed. In the
other hand were two rich red roses; and when the awful thing had
passed by the cowering human wretch who shrunk against the wall, it
turned, and with the hand which held the two red roses uplifted again
as by a sweeping wind, waved to him to follow it. The light had
dropped from his hand and was quenched, but he needed no light to do
that terrific bidding. From the awful presence came something that was
not light, but yet which banished darkness, which forbade the
blessedness of seeing it no more. On went the phantom, down the wide
flat stairs, the satin train sweeping noiselessly over the crimson
carpet, on, on, to the right-hand door of the picture-gallery, on
which the eyes of Sir Cecil Morse and Mr. Netterville were intently
fixed.,

Dead silence. Waiting. Half-past twelve.

There is the slightest possible movement of the left-hand door of
the picture-gallery, there is the lowest whisper breathed into
Crawford's ear.

&quot;My God !  There it is !&quot;

And the Brown Lady glides through the doorway-her head up, her
brown hair falling on her neck, her satin train held back with that
queenly gesture of the band, the two rich red roses nestling against
the lustrous folds of her dress, the raised skirt showing the
beautiful foot with the glittering diamond buckle. In another second
Captain Crawford has wrenched the pistol from Tommy Toxteth's hand,
and with a loud cry of &quot;Lady Burnham, stop ! for God's sake, stop!&quot;
has caught the Brown Lady in his arms; but within the same instant a
shot rings sharply through the gallery, and a heavy fall is heard
outside the opposite door.

They laid the young man's lifeless body on the floor, where his
wretched wife had flung herself, and, at her earnest prayer, permitted
her to search, for the wound, which Mr. Netterville frantically
accused himself of having inflicted. But there was no wound, and the
bullet which had been fired at the ghost was found on the carpet, six
feet within the door whose threshold the dead man had not crossed. He
was quite dead. She knew it; she needed no one to tell her, or to tell
her why. For as she-daring, impious fool, as she should for evermore
knov4herself to be-came in through the door to play her ghastly part,
she had seen the phantom; seen the horrible presence which she had
dared to mock-trifling with fearful mysteries into which none may look
without deadly sin-and knew in another instant that it had slain her
husband.

Everyone had seen the ghost:  The Brown Lady was a ten-thousand-
fold terrible truth to the house of Raby now.

Amid all the wild confusion, the utter bewilderment of horror
and despair, the helpless movement, the clamour just hushing itself
involuntarily within the immediate neighbourhood of the dead, the
frantic misery of the parents, the grief of the friends, the sheer
fright of the servants-Adeline was quiet, and alone. She sat still
upon the floor, her burden on her knees, her arms clasped round it,
and her head bent over the still, white face. The medical aid, which
they knew too well could not avail, was sent for, and to all
entreaties she was deaf.

&quot;When the doctor comes, he shall touch him; no one till then;
leave me alone till then.&quot;

They shrank from  her appalled, as she gathered up the shining
satin train, and flung it like a sheet over her head. It fell around
her figure, and lay over the dead man; and as she sat there, though
her senses remained to her, Adeline Burnham's heart died.

Lord Marlesdale still lives, and Burnham Castle has not yet
passed into the possession of that obnoxious person to whom the late
Countess (her name is commemorated, with her son's, on a splendid
memorial-window in Burnham church, as well as on the magnificent
family tomb) had such a dislike. The Earl is still fond of a quiet
life, and enjoys it, in general, with his daughter Madeleine. He is
not very sad, considering; but then, as he says, he is an old man; and
it is wonderful what old people can. bear. When his widowed daughter-
in-law comes to see him, he likes to see her, of course; but her
sternness, her gravity, her intense seriousness oppress him in spite
of himself, and he is rather anxious she should not remain very long,
which she knows, and accordingly makes her stay short. She never
visits Burnham,-indeed, the castle has been let to a rich banker for
the last five years,-and the Lady Blanche Croaker regards that
circumstance as a. special grace bestowed upon the parish.

&quot;The. very mention of her name, Josiah, ought to make a Christian
wife and mother shudder,&quot; she says, with needless iteration; and in
that double capacity the Lady Blanche shudders, strongly and often.

In the picture-gallery at Burnham Castle there is an empty space
where the portrait of the French countess hung; but a deeper and more
tragical interest is attached to the Brown Lady, and the neighbourhood
has stronger faith than ever in the Burnham ghost. ..
