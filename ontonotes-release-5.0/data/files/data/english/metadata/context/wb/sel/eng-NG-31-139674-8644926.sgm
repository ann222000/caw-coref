You have S Q86 H K5 D KQ842 C T62 and are favourable, dealer. The
auction goes Pass - 1C - 2H (weak) - 3NT - All Pass. What do you
lead.
Your jump overcall style is aggressive. It is Matchpoint Pairs

Your partner has S109xxxx H xx D Axx Cxx, so any diamond works. A
heart is a failure. The director classified the lead of a top diamond
as an amber fielding of the psyche of 2H by your partner. This shows
some &quot;evidence of an unauthorised understanding&quot;. The TD's decision at
the club (which was also advised by a member of the L&amp;E) was overruled
by the club's Chief TD, who classified is as green. Now the TD is
considering holding an EGM of the club to overturn the classification
again.

What is your opinion?

Your partner is allowed to psyche 2H.  You are allowed to decide not
to lead away from Kx and instead lead from a good 5 card suit.  You
both are allowed to be lucky.  The TD who thinks otherwise is a moron,
and probably not a good bridge player.

Nothing that happened shows any &quot;evidence of an unauthorised
understanding&quot; IMHO. Unless there was a history of which we are
unaware, such a finding amounts to a _de facto_ ban on all psychs.

BTW, what does EGM stand for?

Directors may disagree, but if partner's psyche is legal  -- and I
certainly think it was, then  your decision to lead a diamond is
indisputable, notwithstanding the act I would lead a heart.

You started by indicating that you would &quot;rule it amber&quot; without
giving any indication of how and why you thought there was &quot;some
evidence of unauthorised understanding&quot; which is the prerequisite for
an amber classification. As Tim DeLaney succintly put it: &quot;Nothing
that happened shows any &quot;evidence of an unauthorised
understanding&quot; IMHO.&quot; As the main compiler of the Orange Book, your
explanation of why you would rule it amber would be of great benefit
to all those players and EBU officials who think it is routinely
green. And yes, I agree that the use of an EGM to change a psyche
classification is probably illegal.

With aggressive jump overcalls generally after P-1C at favorable,
matchpoints, 2H shows a hand with some hearts. Usually more than two,
but hitting five to the jack-empty will be no surprise.

I strongly dislike the EBU method of psych classification, but on
these agreements, a diamond lead is almost certainly superior. Failing
to see that is surprising; not everyone requires six good hearts to
overcall white on red after a 1-minor opening in second seat. Frankly,
I view those who do require it as pretty severely misguided.

So, I think it's a goofy ruling.

As to the EGM, Ebullient Goofy Monkeys, if you get them, are worth any
adverse ruling. (I confess that other than the goofy monkeys, I'm
uncertain what the heck an EGM is.)

There is nothing of any &quot;color&quot; to consider, IMO.  Leading a non-heart is

I was originally given this hand as a lead problem, without any
information about the psyche.

After asking further questions (style, form of scoring), I decided to
lead a diamond and was trying to choose between a small one or the DK.

Since I didn't intend to lead a heart without having any information
about the psyche, I didn't consider that not leading one could be
fielding in any way.

Note that if you exchange the major suits of the 2H bidder such that the
bid is not a psyche, leading the KH is still inadvisable. Only if
playing with someone with a sound overcall style does a heart lead
become more compelling, but even then it's not clear-cut unless the
opponents are wild bidders.

I agree. Note that &quot;some evidence of an unauthorised understanding&quot; is
a direct quote from the Orange Book.

Essentially, the Orange Book says that if an amber psyche is repeated,
and fielded, then both become red.

This shows some &quot;evidence of an unauthorized understanding&quot;.

Why is that? My next comment has to do with rule theory and is about
the TD estimating the skill level of the partnership and making
different rulings according to the TD's hunch about their expertise.
This is a guaranteed way to make unfair rulings. The rules should
be applied equally to everyone, to eliminate judgment errors and
other factors like how well are they dressed and how often they play.
The more subjective the interpretation of the rules are by the TD,
the more one introduces the factor of how well the TD plays bridge.

Nearly all good players would lead a diamond, since they have only
a doubleton in the heart suit. Leading a heart says I think partner
has QJTxxx of hearts and an outside entry, which looking at your hand
has to be an ace since you have no ace to give him a king as an entry.

Give partner QT987x of hearts and an outside ace for an entry.
That gives declarer the AJx of hearts for a stopper. Or give
partner AT987x and declarer only QJx of hearts. Your side gets
1 or 2 heart tricks while destroying your chance to beat 3NT.

Another thing is when you break hearts and declarer has a
double stopper like AJx or QTxx, it gives declarer the freedom
to finesse through the diamond hand which is marked for more
points and more cards in the other suits, though on this
particular hand that is probably less of a factor except perhaps
for the S-Qxx.

I also think the question of the psyche is misdirected. The diamond
hand who is on lead is entitled to read declarer for how quickly
and whether there is a gesture of finality to the bid. One should
at one's own risk decide if their is a possibility that declarer
is psyching his heart stopper(s). If you think declarer at least
thinks he is making a good bid, the possibility of partner psyching
doesn't have to enter the picture, just that partner is overwhelmingly
not likely to have AQJxxx of hearts but at the best AQxxxx and the
stopper held by declarer can be as poor as JTxx.

All opinions may be opinions and not facts, but there are certainly
uninformed opinions and opinions based on experience which is the
closest humans get to a fact, a unanimous consensus subjective reality.
So besides experience they can run computer simulations which will
produce highly likely to be true &quot;opinions&quot;.

This shows some &quot;evidence of an unauthorized understanding&quot;.

About the only time that a heart lead is correct is when partner
holds AQJxxx of hearts. How often is that? Maybe 1 out of 15 or 20.
And then maybe not a disaster if partner has also the diamond jack.
The other 19 out of 20 times, leading a diamond is the only
reasonable way to beat the contract. There may be some partnerships
where the suit promised is always AQJxxx or better, but when the
suits have to be at least this good, it should be alerted, I think.

So this is where how good the TD plays bridge enters the picture.
There are some weak advanced players and intermediates who would
lead the K of hearts. You have another class of players who have
been playing bridge for 40 years, have a 1000 master points, and
who now play rather mechanically based on their former habits.

So the argument for &quot;amber&quot; is basically this as I see it:

Most average players would lead the heart King.
&quot;Some&quot; average players would lead a diamond.

Most all good players would lead a diamond.
&quot;Some&quot; good players would lead the heart King.

Therefore, there is &quot;some&quot; evidence that an average player
has obtained Unauthorized Information (from his partner,
not declarer) if he leads a diamond. However, if the TD
judged the diamond bidder to be a good player, it would be
typical to lead a diamond and hence would not be evidence
that &quot;some&quot; good players who lead a diamond in this situation
have benefited from UI.

That means every time the TD has stereotyped the diamond bidder
into the peer group of average players, then if that average
player makes a very standard good play, it is fair to cast the
pall of suspicion about how the average player came by that bid.

Or the TD applies his own lack of bridge expertise to color his
judgment because he would have led the heart King or thinks
maybe 1/3 of the good players might also choose to lead the H-K,
so there are some grounds for suspicion.

Now it is a fact that leading the diamond is the best lead, even
if sometimes it doesn't produce the best result. Because &quot;some&quot;
people or even a majority of bridge players don't know this, thus
think I'm offering an opinion does not change the status of fact.
Those are the people with an ignorant not &quot;moronic&quot; opinion. I
just saw this today on what to do with 9 points after a TO double.

The diamond leader had Qxx of spades and partner T9xxxx. So if
he had led a spade from Qxx and then unblocked the suit after
finding the opps with 2-2 in spades Ax and Kx, then you have
some amber fields of hybrid wheat not airy-fairy popcorn.

When you explained why you would have thought it was &quot;fielding&quot;

&quot;The TD will judge actions objectively by the standards of a player’s
peers; that is to say intent will not be taken into account.&quot;

presumably you think objectively doesn't include making obvious
good leads which can be substantiated by common sense and if one
doesn't have that, by computer simulation. The reason why Tim
thought there was no problem with this lead is because he knows
that nearly all good players would find the diamond lead obvious
and the one's who don't are those fake BBO &quot;experts&quot;.

So Soloway playing with a partner who pays to play with him.
If he hears this bidding and thinks the opps aren't beginners,
will always lead a diamond. Only if he is playing with an expert
partner (his peer) who is very disciplined would he lead the king
of hearts. His peer in this case is one &quot;average&quot; players.

Is the TD going to rule that Soloway perhaps had a hidden agreement
about the 2H psyche? I don't think so, they will say Soloway led
the diamond because it is so completely obvious except to those
with no card sense. Objectively, the lead is obvious no matter who
makes the lead, one doesn't have to know a smattering of anything
extra to find that lead. But I think there would be two different
rulings by the TD in this case. And it would not be objective in
the sense of best bridge or logical bridge. It would be a subjective
decision based on whether or not he thought the diamond leader was a
good player, or needed some &quot;hint&quot;. Intent does not enter into this
discussion, at all. It requires the TD to have subjectively decided
that this player is average and likely not because he knows he is an
poor, average, K-heart leading wastrel of low master point origin.
Some clubs keep a roster of life masters and is that the objective
criteria for a TD to decide what peer group some faceless players
belongs to? So that a face with no name can be punished for a good
play? The problem with the master point standard is that it gets to
a point where it no longer rewards people for being good players,
but for how many decades they have played.

To conclude, I don't think the TD or you can make such an objective
evaluation using sound logical reasoning. The problem with TDs and
bridge players in general is that they have above average intelligence.
But they nearly always have an inflated opinion about how smart they
are and what intelligence can provide you with. That grandiose attitude
generates the false conclusion that the person with that attitude has
special insights into the nature of reality and the reasons for why
people do things. Those people are completely incapable of making
objective decisions because they are self-deluded about the breadth
and depth of their 'keen' sense of character judgment. So no, &quot;moron&quot;
is not at all the right name to describe the TD who made this amber
judgment. There is a different adjective to describe those who would
quote those amber/red rules as if they even had any bearing for grounds
to decide the diamond leader had illicitly benefited from the psyche.

That TD's ruling was nothing more than bridge ignorance compounded by
a flatulent pompous overestimation of who they are and what their job
encompasses perhaps calcified by old age, so that their opinion
undermines the principle of playing bridge fairly and to the best of
your ability. What a bizarre groundless notion that leading a diamond
constituted &quot;some evidence&quot; of UI misconduct. The word is &quot;might&quot; and
might happens anytime an average partnership scores well against a
top partnership, it is not expected...is there an unusual conniving
cause?! There is just no logical connection, rather than an imaginary
figment of the TD's imaginary connection, between the ordinary usual
and good diamond lead (to all but bad players) and deciding that the
heart psyche rather than the usually held by partner 3-6 count for a
jump overcall, and declarer's NT bid, that prompted the diamond lead.

Besides being an ignorant bad bridge player, not good prerequisites
for a TD, though they do say, those who cannot do, teach, and those
who cannot teach, shuffle boards about in their

Yes, such a sound style as to deserve mention as a special range on

Having only Kx, I wouldn't lead a heart if partner only promised 6 HCP.

There are several people who have posted that they chose a diamond
lead without knowledge of the psyche. It is safe to say that most
good players would lead a diamond without information about the psyche
(I'm not going to get in to why that is so). That means it is a logical
lead without any suggestion of appearing or might appear as if there is
another possible logical cause. Nobody would suggest from a diamond
lead that the players were twitching their fingers on their cards or
toe-tapping. Nobody I assume, would call this vague or a possibility,
of circumstantial evidence that there &quot;appeared&quot; or even using the
vague wording &quot;might appear&quot; that there was any unauthorized information
communicated. There is zero circumstantial (appearing as if) evidence
when somebody leads a diamond from that hand.

When people find out later that there was a psyche involved, do you
think they now think 'aah, that is how he found that diamond lead?!'.
No, they don't change their mind because they never thought there was
anything at all unusual, that might conceivably require explanation.

Do you suppose the NT bidders hours later, wonder how the guy found
a diamond lead when there was no psyche? Did one of the opps have a
pinky ring he deceptively rubbed to get his partner to lead a diamond?
No because the diamond lead is perfectly ordinary and expected from a
good player. If he led something else, that would be suspicious.

&gt; If a player psyches and his partner takes action that appears to allow
&gt; for it then the TD will treat it as fielding.&quot;

What is this action? It is certainly not leading a diamond because
nearly all good players will lead a diamond. The complete logic of
leading a diamond is contained in his holding of Kx and declarer's
bid of 3NT. &quot;Appears to allow for it&quot; means there is a logical loose
end or reason not to lead a diamond that needs to be accounted for
that would lead one to have a niggling doubt as to why the HK was
not led. But when all the good players lead a diamond without any
knowledge of the psyche it means the logical reason for leading a
diamond is totally self-contained. Nothing else needs answering and
learning of the psyche later does not entitle one to entertain even
a shread of doubt about the correctness of leading a diamond.

To take some action that appears to allow for the psyche requires
that there should be some action taken which isn't completely logical.
But all the good players lead a diamond without any psyche existing
in their weighing of the best lead to make. Learning that there has
been a psyche later does not change the reality of most good players
realizing that a diamond lead is far superior to a HK lead. They
don't need even a supposed subconscious hint to arrive at this
conclusion. Learning about the psyche later would make me aware that
there was a remote possibility that there was another reason which
transcended a completely logical process in making the diamond lead
decision. But to go from there and claim there was an appearance of
an action which one would even circumstantially claim provided
evidence of &quot;fielding&quot; is tinged with delusion and paranoia. Magical
thinking is an addictive mental process which doesn't know how to
distinguish between events which are causally related and those that
happen in the same time frame, but are not causally connected, which
are called coincidences. When people decide to lead a diamond who
definitely have no knowledge of a psyche, it means that the psyche
was only coincidental. Pure coincidence does not conflate to an
action regarded as fielding when the same hand produces an action
which is identical to a choice or action taken without a psyche.

This argument boils down to that all the good players know not to
lead the KH and to lead a diamond, so there is nothing even slightly
unusual about the diamond lead to justify such an action as anything
more than it is, which is already completely logically justified.
Taking note of this situation reminds me too much of when being
pulled over for speeding, when not actually speeding, and given no
ticket, but your name goes into a database which puts you into a
different category and can prompt different treatment later, than
from somebody who is squeaky clean. If they want to make psyches
illegal, than that is what they should do, instead of pussyfooting
about and treating them with veiled suspicion and database innuendo.

Rather than attack personalities, perhaps you could just realise that
when there is a judgement at bridge different people have different
ideas - just look at any thread which asks a bidding question - and this
one is no exception.  Different people have different ideas, and your
attempts to belittle people with different views do not help.

Whether it is Amber or Green depends on the bridge judgement of the
alternative leads, not on anything else, and some people think a diamond
lead obvious, some do not.

Thanks Stephen,

The problem is not so much how good a player a TD is.  They are
officiating over a complex game.  No TD is going to know the level
that all the players in the room play, and with the best will in the
world, TD's are not expected to keep abreast of all the changes that
are happening within bridge, whether it is bidding systems, offensive
and defensive, carding methods and the situations when they apply.
Like lawyers, it would make some sense for them to get advice from a
third party who might know more about a specific area than they do.
Aggressive defensive bidding is such an area.

Typically the problem arises when a TD, a position of some authority,
feels that they have to make an on the spot decision, and more often
that not will be persuaded by the more forceful personalities at the
table.

Unfortunately the boot is on the other foot... I am not a peer to Tony
Forrester...  A great player, who like other players in his class have
an infuriating ability to cast a spell over TD's and appeal
committee's in this country.

Having played in the US, TD's tend to be less in awe of the stars of
the game in my quite inexperienced view.

Best regards

John

&gt; No because the diamond lead is perfectly ordinary and expected from a
&gt; good player. If he led something else, that would be suspicious.

&gt;  &gt; If a player psyches and his partner takes action that appears to allow
&gt;  &gt; for it then the TD will treat it as fielding.&quot;

&gt; What is this action? It is certainly not leading a diamond because
&gt; nearly all good players will lead a diamond. The complete logic of
&gt; leading a diamond is contained in his holding of Kx and declarer's
&gt; bid of 3NT. &quot;Appears to allow for it&quot; means there is a logical loose
&gt; end or reason not to lead a diamond that needs to be accounted for
&gt; that would lead one to have a niggling doubt as to why the HK was
&gt; not led. But when all the good players lead a diamond without any
&gt; knowledge of the psyche it means the logical reason for leading a
&gt; diamond is totally self-contained. Nothing else needs answering and
&gt; learning of the psyche later does not entitle one to entertain even
&gt; a shread of doubt about the correctness of leading a diamond.

&gt; To take some action that appears to allow for the psyche requires
&gt; that there should be some action taken which isn't completely logical.
&gt; But all the good players lead a diamond without any psyche existing
&gt; in their weighing of the best lead to make. Learning that there has
&gt; been a psyche later does not change the reality of most good players
&gt; realizing that a diamond lead is far superior to a HK lead. They
&gt; don't need even a supposed subconscious hint to arrive at this
&gt; conclusion. Learning about the psyche later would make me aware that
&gt; there was a remote possibility that there was another reason which
&gt; transcended a completely logical process in making the diamond lead
&gt; decision. But to go from there and claim there was an appearance of
&gt; an action which one would even circumstantially claim provided
&gt; evidence of &quot;fielding&quot; is tinged with delusion and paranoia. Magical
&gt; thinking is an addictive mental process which doesn't know how to
&gt; distinguish between events which are causally related and those that
&gt; happen in the same time frame, but are not causally connected, which
&gt; are called coincidences. When people decide to lead a diamond who
&gt; definitely have no knowledge of a psyche, it means that the psyche
&gt; was only coincidental. Pure coincidence does not conflate to an
&gt; action regarded as fielding when the same hand produces an action
&gt; which is identical to a choice or action taken without a psyche.

&gt; This argument boils down to that all the good players know not to
&gt; lead the KH and to lead a diamond, so there is nothing even slightly
&gt; unusual about the diamond lead to justify such an action as anything
&gt; more than it is, which is already completely logically justified.
&gt; Taking note of this situation reminds me too much of when being
&gt; pulled over for speeding, when not actually speeding, and given no
&gt; ticket, but your name goes into a database which puts you into a
&gt; different category and can prompt different treatment later, than
&gt; from somebody who is squeaky clean. If they want to make psyches
&gt; illegal, than that is what they should do, instead of pussyfooting
&gt; about and treating them with veiled suspicion and database innuendo.
">

Leading the heart king would not necessarily be right. But if you know
partner preempts 2H on as little as a small doubleton then you
certainly have a more compelling reason than the rest of the field to
not lead a heart.

This reminds me of Zia. In the late 80's, Zia was said to make psychic
preempts when partner was a passed hand. His partners were not allowed
to raise under any circumstances. But later I never heard a Zia story
making a psychic preempt in the 90's or 2000's.

Hi David,

I think you have missed the point.  If only 30% find the diamond lead,
would you consider it Amber?  At the beginning of this thread you
thought it might warrant such a consideration.  Do you now think that
is the case?  I would not question the judgment of the player who
found such a lead since it is the compass of common sense.

It would be very difficult for me to rule against the defender, let
alone reporting the action to a higher authority.  I suppose you are
right when you say its judgment, something that can elude all of us at
the table...

Best regards

John

I didn't bother answer since the question seemed loaded[the 'aggressive'
footnote seemed to suggest a heart was wrong, not to suggest people who
did respond were influenced by that].  I must admit though, I'd probably
lead the HK.  After all there is the old saying, if you don't lead your
suit that's one stopper.  I hardly think the 3N bidder is promising a
double stopper on this auction.  After seeing the definition of amber
psyche, I think it is a fair classification.  Amber apparently doesn't
mean the psyche was fielded, just that there was some possibility of a
field.

I hear what you are saying. However, if in a poll, diamond lead gets - say -
95% or more of the votes, it is no longer &quot;some people think this and some
people think that&quot;, regardless of what the success or lack of success of the
diamond lead is.  Ruling an action Amber when that action gets 95% of votes
from uninvolved others, does not appear right by common sense.

If this classification is correct then the consequence are:
Never psyche, not because you may get a bad score.
Never psyche, because even should you get lucky you will get a bad
reputation.

To me something is wrong with this paranoid attitude to a game, where
psyches are an infrequent but intrinsic ingredient.

For what its worth a double dummy analysis with 1C from S in a weak NT 4

the D lead is best with constructive weak jumps (ie never on a J high suit

I still remember a hand my partner played against Paul 10 years ago - Paul
opened 3C, I passed and put down AKQ108 of clubs in dummy as my partner
jumped to 4S.

A club lead was finessed, the 10, losing to the J.  Winning trick 2 my
partner drew trumps and passed the club 8 losing to RHO's J9 doubleton and
cutting himself off from dummy!!!!!!

I can't help feeling this director objects to such tactics, but at the time

My point was not that I have a disagreement with a ruling.
I disagree with tarnishing somebody's reputation (fielding), based on
a Bridge action (leading a diamond), when a substantial minority let
alone a majority of good players would take that action at the table.
This amounts to paranoia.
Nevertheless Travis considered this a fair classification &quot;after
seeing the definition of amber psyche&quot; and having read this
discussion.

I am not sure this is a fair comparison. Fact is, however, that this
is exactly what many experienced Bridge players , who consider
themselves ethical, do at the table. It is almost always impossible or
very difficult to predict what other people would consider a clear cut
bid (after hesitation), even if your own Bridge judgment tells you,
you have one.

So you make something up, and then get upset at it, and that's
paranoia?  Well, you are right.

First, it was not ruled as fielding, and no-one has suggested it
should be, apart from yourself.

Second, even a Red classification does not &quot;tarnish someone's

fielded as Red using the objective criteria and the judgement of the

So there is no need to go off the deep end screaming about paranoia,

Sorry, but I see the reaction as being more paranoid.  If you psych rarely,

Sorry but there is a fine but important distinction when you find

Of course it does.
Otherwise the whole procedure makes no sense and the persons involved
would not have tried to get the decision overturned if it was of no
consequence to their reputation. Besides the whole discussion here
makes it quite clear that a Bridge player's integrity is compromised

Though both involve unauthorized information my feeling is there is a
world apart;

In case of hesitation the implication is that a bidding decision might
have been influenced by a hesitation of his/her partner. The player
involved need not even be consciously aware that his decision might
have been influenced and a seasoned player involved must at least
believe himself he would have made the same bid without the
hesitation.

In the case here the claim is that a player had or may have used
unauthorized information about a psyche of his partner not deduced
from Bridge logic. So from where did he have this information? This at
least comes close to claiming a pair cheats by intent. Even raising
such a suspicion can not be good for your reputation.

If you labeled hesitations red/yellow/green, then it would be the same.

With these psyche decisions, you are labeled red (you cheated), yellow
(you might have cheated), green (you got lucky). Those interpretations
of red/yellow/green might not be intended, but clearly many see them
that way.
