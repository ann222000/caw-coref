Som of you will see this and maybe even get misty-eyed by the third
paragraph, but this is for you who have never read it.

&quot;The Farmer's Son
Cyril Posthumus

Correrai ancor piu veloce per le vie del cielo. These words were
inscribed in huge letters above the entrance to the cathedral in
Mantua
where, in August 1953, the funeral service for Tazio Giorgio Nuvolari
took place. Meaning: 'You will travel still faster upon the highways
of
heaven' they were read with awe, sadness, and a reverence amounting
almost to love by the many thousands of Mantuans who followed the
cortege through the streets to pay tribute to Italy's greatest
driver.

The crowd, which thronged the cathedral that day was immense;
estimates
of the number varied between 25,000 and 55,000, but whatever the true
figure may have been there was no denying their universal grief at
the
passing of Mantua's most famous citizen. The same words were engraved
upon Nuvolari's tomb, in which he was taken, clothed in his famous
canary-yellow jersey and blue overall trousers, with racing goggles,
gloves, and helmet accompanying him, and escorted by a procession of
mourners which stretched for nearly a mile and a half through the
streets.

What manner of man was this, then, whose funeral could bring out a
town
almost in its entirety, and whose death put a nation into mourning?

Tazio Nuvolari was no simply a racing driver. To Italy he became an
idol, a demi-god, a legend, epitomizing all that young Italy aspired
to
be; the man who 'did the impossible', not once but habitually; the
David
who slew Goliaths in the great sport of motor-racing. He was Il
Maestro.

Italians today, only too aware of their country's current lack of
motor-
racing talent, turn perforce to the glories of the past for comfort,
and
warmly recall the feats of the old Italian masters. There were so
many
in Italy's golden years... Varzi, Farina, Trossi, Fagioli, Bordino,
Nazarro, the Ascaris, father and son... Yet in ninety-nine cases out
of
the hundred one name will come to their lips before any of these -
that
of their beloved Nuvolari, the farmer's son who came from Ronchesana,
near Mantua.

That little man, barely over 5 feet tall, deceptively frail and
narrow
in build but seemingly strung together with high-tensile steel wire,
with his long narrow chin and prominent jaw, dark piercing eyes,
toothy
grin and greying hair, endeared himself to all, not solely by his
indomitable fighting spirit and wizardry at the wheel but for his
innate
goodness.

Italy loved him for his quiet and gentlemanly mode of living - he was
kind, generous, thoughtful and modest, completely free of the prima
donna complex which could easily affect a racing ace, a lover of home
life and immensely devoted to his wife and family - traits which all
won
the hearts of the ordinary people.

As a driver, he was, of course, unique. Possessed himself of
tremendous
vitality, he seemed to infuse his very car with the same restless
energy. As he raced, he grimaced, bared his teeth, grinned, puffed
out
his cheeks, talked to his car, and patted it now and then. He wasn't
playing to the gallery, to which he was entirely oblivious, but
simply
being his natural dynamic self and doing all those things which
characterised the maestro, the master of motor-racing.

I was too young properly to appreciate my first sight of Nuvolari. It
was down at Brooklands in autumn, 1933, when I was a school boy. He
looked so small, so yellow, and so cold, despite a thick 'teddy bear'
coat, and when he took it off and climbed into a 2.3-litre Bugatti he
seemed to shrink still further. Then he drove out on to the Mountain
circuit, and I followed the concerted rush down to the Fork hairpin
to
watch. To me, he looked most excitingly dangerous, the Bugatti
skittering round in brief, jerky slides, but I don't think he cared
much
for that short, bumpy, and unnatural circuit. I spent the savings of
several weeks to attend the race-meeting a day or two later, and was
bitterly disappointed when Nuvolari did not driver after all.

I was more versed in Nuvolari 'lore' when I saw him again in the
Donington Grand Prix of 1938, and was thrilled to the core by the
sight
of him in action. A skimpy, yellow-clad figure almost lost in the
cockpit of his silver Auto-Union, he contrived to look far 'busier'
than
any other driver, not only through the corners but even when motoring
down the straights. Up to a point, of course, he was 'busier' - busy
outpacing the entire Mercedes-Benz team and winning a glorious race,
giving some 60,000 spectators the thrill of their lives.

Without a doubt he was Italy's greatest racing-driver of all time -
but
the legendary Flying Mantuan the world's greatest, as has so often
been
suggested?

To borrow the late Professor Joad's well worn phrase: 'It all depends
on
what is mean by &quot;greatness&quot;.' The number of outright victories gained
by
a driver are far from being the sole criterion of greatness, which in
motor-racing means much more: the ability to go very fast and remain
on
the road for instance; the ability to drive with your head as well as
your hands and feet; to fight, and to go on fighting no matter how
hopeless the odds may seem; and to do all these things just a little
better than your rivals, without wearing your tyres down to the
breaker
strip or blowing up your engine... Nuvolari qualifies all right, but
so
do others.

Statistics help little. They show that Nuvolari won around 50 race
victories of importance in 17 seasons between 1924 and 1946. In
contrast, Juan Manuel Fangio, who is considered by many to be
Nuvolari's
sternest rival as the world's greatest driver, scored 55 in nine
seasons
between 1949 and 1957. Alberto Ascari, who brilliant career was cut
short after 8 years, gained forty-three wins between 1926 and 1939,
while Stirling Moss has over 45 important wins to his credit. Yet
comparison is misleading since, on the average, more races per season
have been held in the post-war years than in the thirties, and more
in
the thirties than the twenties.

What the results tables do not reveal is that, first, Nuvolari's
ratio
of retirements to successes is higher than the others, attesting to
his
notorious 'win or bust' outlook; and, secondly, that a large
proportion
of Nuvolari's victories were achieved on cars slower than the
opposition. The only year in which he consistently had one of the
fastest cars was 1932, when he was a member of the official Alfa-
Romeo
team with the then new and invincible monoposto, Alfa-Romeo straight-
eights. For most of his other victories he was fighting unequal odds
-
and loving it.

All great drivers have their chef d'oeuvre - the masterpiece of their
career; Caracciola's was probably the 1931 German GP, Fangio's the
1957
German GP, Ascari's the 1949 GP of Europe, Moss's the 1955 Mille
Miglia
or the 1959 Italian GP. The trouble with Nuvolari was that he had
several! By tradition his greatest triumph was the 1935 German GP,
when
he defeated nine modern German cars - five Mercedes and four Auto
Union's - with his basically four year old Alfa-Romeo - a wonderful
feat
indeed, the story of which has been told and retold in motor-racing
literature.

Yet there were other achievements by Nuvolari, lesser known and
lesser
chronicled, testifying to his matchless fighting spirit, his fierce
refusal to recognise defeat, and his uncanny ability, reinforcing his
right to a very high pedestal in motor-racing history.

Naturally, one as indifferent to danger as he suffered numerous
accidents during his long career, and talking his way out of hospital
and competing in races heavily swathed in bandages or plaster became
a
notable Nuvolari habit. There were no false heroics about this, but
simply his tremendous will to race defying common sense. Pain he
could
tolerate when there was a goal ahead, but inactivity he could no
bear;
his volatile temperament would not allow it.

After being flung though a wire fence at Monza when he crashed in a
P2
Alfa-Romeo during a trial by the works in 1925, his injuries included
a
severely lacerated back, promising a month or so in a hospital bed to
recover. But Nuvolari wasn't having any - not with the vital motor-
cycle
Grand Prix of the Nations meeting at Monza six days hence. He
persuaded
the medicos to bandage him in such a way that he could be seated on
his
350cc twin ohc Bianchi and push-started. He duelled fanatically in
pouring rain with Britain's famous Wal Handley, and when the latter's
Rex-Acme gave out under constant pressure from the Bianchi with half
a
lap to go, Tazio scored a triumphant victory for Italy.

At Alessandria early in 1934 the Maestro broke a leg when his
Maserati
crashed on treacherously wet roads, owing to the fact that his true
line
through a corner came suddenly to be occupied by a disabled Alfa-
Romeo.
After four restless weeks in hospital Tazio could endure the
inactivity
no longer, and against his doctor's earnest advice entered to drive a
Maserati in the Avus GP near Berlin.

He had the pedals modified so that all three could be operated with
one
foot, the other still being in plaster, and then, despite the
entreaties
of his wife, friends, and doctor, he hobbled out for practice on
crutches, having to be helped in and out of the cockpit. In a
devastatingly fast race, dominated initially by the new Auto-Unions
and
later by the Ferrari Alfas, Nuvolari pressed on, tortured by cramp
and
plagued by tyre trouble, eventually finishing a modest but hard-won
fifth.

One place ahead of him in another Maserati was that great British
sportsman Earl Howe, who was moved to comment on Tazio's drive: 'Let
any
who say it was foolhardy at least be honest and admit it was one of
the
greatest exhibitions of pluck and grit ever seen. By such men are
victories won!'

Two years later, while practising for that other high-speed race, the
Tripoli GP in North Africa, a wheel of Nuvolari's 4.1-litre twelve-
cylinder Alfa-Romeo caught a marker
