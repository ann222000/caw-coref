The Sire of Heaven protesting all the Gods and him also
That lent the Chariot to his child, that all of force must go
To havocke if he helped not, went to the highest part
And top of all the Heaven from whence his custome was to dart
His thunder and his lightning downe. But neyther did remaine
A Cloude wherewith to shade the Earth, nor yet a showre of raine.
Then with a dreadfull thunderclap up to his eare he bent
His fist, and at the Wagoner a flash of lightning sent,
Which strake his bodie from the life and threw it over wheele
And so with fire he *QUENCHED* fire. The Steedes did also reele
Upon their knees, and starting up sprang violently, one HERE,
And there another, that they brast in pieces all their gere.
They threw the Collars from their neckes, and breaking quite asunder
The Trace and Harnesse flang away: here lay the bridles: yonder
The Extree plucked from the Naves: and in another place
The shEVERED spokes of broken wheeles: and so at EVERy pace
The pieces of the Chariot torne lay strowed HERE and there.
But Phaeton (fire yet blasing stil among his yellow haire)
Shot headlong downe, and glid along the Region of the AYRE
Like to a STARRE in Winter nights (the wether cleare and fayre)
Which though it doe not fall in deede, yet falleth to our sight,
Whome almost in another world and from his countrie quite
The River Padus did receyve, and *QUENCHT* his burning head.
The water Nymphes of Italie did take his carkasse dead ...
And buried it yet smoking still, with Joves threeforked flame,
And wrate this Epitaph in the stone that lay upon the same:
.
&quot; HERE lies the lusty Phaeton which tooke in hand to guide
His fathers Chariot, from the which although he chaunst to slide:
Yet that he gave a proud attempt it cannot be denide.&quot;
.
. Wyth ruthfull cheere and heavie heart his father made great mone
. And would not shew himselfe abrode, but mournd at home alone.
.
And if it be to be beleved, as bruited is by FAME
A day did passe without the Sunne. The brightnesse of the flame
Gave light: and so unto some kinde of use that mischiefe came.
But Clymen having spoke, as much as mothers usually
Are wonted in such wretched case, discomfortablely
And halfe beside hir selfe for wo, with torne and scratched brest,
Sercht through the UnIVERSall world, from East to furthest West,
First SEEKing for hir sonnes dead coarse, and after for his bones.
She found them by a forren streame, entumbled under stones.
There fell she groveling on his grave, and reading there his name,
Shed teares thereon, and layd hir breast all bare upon the same.
The daughters also of the Sunne no lesse than did their mother,
Bewaild in vaine with flouds of teares, the fortune of their brother:
And beating piteously their breasts, incessantly did call
The buried Phaeton day and night, who heard them not at all,
About whose tumbe they prostrate lay. Foure times the Moone had filde
The Circle of hir joyned hornes, and yet the sisters hilde
Their custome of lamenting still: (for now continuall use
Had made it custome.) Of the which the eldest, Phaetuse,
About to kneele upon the ground, complaynde hir feete were nom.
To whome as fayre Lampetie was rising for to com,
Hir feete were held with sodaine rootes. The third about to teare
Hir ruffled lockes, filde both hir handes
.             with leaves in steade of heare.
One wept to see hir legges made wood: another did repine
To see hir armes become long boughes. And shortly to define,
While thus they wondred at themselves, a tender barke began
To grow about their thighes and loynes, which shortly overran
Their bellies, brestes, and shoulders eke, and hands successively,
That nothing (save their mouthes) remainde, aye calling piteously
Upon the wofull mothers helpe. What could the mother doe
But runne now here now there, as force of nature drue hir too,
And deale hir kisses while she might? She was not so content:
But tare their tender braunches downe: and from the *SLIVERS* went ...
Red drops of bloud as from a wound. The daughter that was rent
Cride: Spare us mother spare I pray, for in the shape of tree
The bodies and the flesh of us your daughters wounded bee.
And now farewell. That word once said, the barke grew over all.
Now from these trees flow gummy teares that Amber men doe call,
Which hardened with the heate of sunne as from the boughs they fal
The trickling River doth receyve, and sendes as things of price
To decke the daintie Dames of Rome and make them fine and nice.

Arsène Lupin (From Wikipedia)
.
&lt;&lt;Arsène Lupin is the name of a fictional gentleman thief who appears
in a book series of detective fiction / crime fiction novels written
by French writer Maurice Leblanc, as well as a number of non-canonical
sequels and numerous film, television, stage play and comic book
adaptations. A contemporary of Arthur Conan Doyle, Maurice Leblanc
(1864-1941) was the creator of the character of gentleman thief Arsène
Lupin who, in France, has enjoyed a popularity as long-lasting and
considerable as Sherlock Holmes in the English-speaking world. There
are twenty volumes in the Arsène Lupin series written by Leblanc
himself, plus five authorized sequels written by the notorious mystery
writing team of Boileau-Narcejac, as well as various pastiches. The
character of Lupin was first introduced in a series of short stories
serialized in the magazine Je Sais Tout, starting in No. 6, dated 15
July 1905.
.
Arsène Lupin is a literary descendant of Pierre Alexis Ponson du
Terrail's Rocambole. Like him, he is clearly a force for good, while
operating on the wrong side of the law. Those whom Lupin defeats,
always with his characteristic gallic style and panache, are worse
villains than he. Lupin is somewhat similar to A.J. Raffles and
anticipates characters such as The Saint. The character of Arsène
Lupin might have been based by Leblanc on French anarchist Marius
Jacob, whose trial made headlines in March 1905 ; but Leblanc had also
read Octave Mirbeau's Les 21 jours d'un neurasthénique (1901), which
features a gentleman thief named Arthur Lebeau, and seen Mirbeau's
comedy Scrupules (1902), whose main character is a gentleman thief.
.
Arsène Lupin and Sherlock Holmes were bound to meet and, in an
unprecedented act of literary pastiche and cross-over, Leblanc
introduced Holmes in the short story Sherlock Holmes arrive trop tard
in Je Sais Tout No. 17, 15 June 1906. In it, Holmes meets a young
Lupin for a brief time, unaware that he is, in fact, Lupin. After
legal objections from Conan Doyle, the name was changed to &quot;Herlock
Sholmès&quot; when the story was collected in bookform in Volume 1. Holmes
returned in two more stories collected in Volume 2, Arsène Lupin
contre Herlock Sholmès, and then in a guest-starring role in the
prodigious battle for the secret of the Hollow Needle in L'Aiguille
creuse.
.
Several Arsène Lupin novels contain some interesting fantasy elements:
a radioactive 'god-stone' that cures people and causes mutations is
the object of an epic battle in L'Île aux trente cercueils; the secret
of the Fountain of Youth, a mineral water source hidden beneath a lake
in the Auvergne, is the goal sought by the protagonists in La
Demoiselle aux yeux verts; finally, in La Comtesse de Cagliostro,
Lupin's arch-enemy and lover is none other than Joséphine Balsamo, the
alleged granddaughter of Cagliostro himself.&gt;&gt;

MM:
Art, Shakespeare descended from God, so it was the &quot;born descendant,&quot;
and not Edward de Vere, who wrote the canon.  He was Jesus and Kabir
Sahib.  He has been returning to the Father and descending from him
for untold ages.  Kabir Sahib mentioned that he was sent in all the
four Yugas (Ages) going back millions of years.  He ever gave the
names that he had in those lives.

&gt; What's in a name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when
&gt; we write the name that we are told is ours. *A STAR, a daySTAR* ,
&gt; a firedrake, rose at his birth. It shone by day in the heavens
&gt; alone, brighter than *VENUS* in the night, and by night it shone
&gt; oVER DElta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is
&gt; the signature of his initial among the stars. His eyes watched
&gt; it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked
&gt; by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from
&gt; Shottery and from her arms.&gt;&gt; - _Ulysses_ �by James Joyce

&gt; The Sire of Heaven protesting all the Gods and him also
&gt; That lent the Chariot to his child, that all of force must go
&gt; To havocke if he helped not, went to the highest part
&gt; And top of all the Heaven from whence his custome was to dart
&gt; His thunder and his lightning downe. But neyther did remaine
&gt; A Cloude wherewith to shade the Earth, nor yet a showre of raine.
&gt; Then with a dreadfull thunderclap up to his eare he bent
&gt; His fist, and at the Wagoner a flash of lightning sent,
&gt; Which strake his bodie from the life and threw it over wheele
&gt; And so with fire he *QUENCHED* fire. The Steedes did also reele
&gt; Upon their knees, and starting up sprang violently, one HERE,
&gt; And there another, that they brast in pieces all their gere.
&gt; They threw the Collars from their neckes, and breaking quite asunder
&gt; The Trace and Harnesse flang away: here lay the bridles: yonder
&gt; The Extree plucked from the Naves: and in another place
&gt; The shEVERED spokes of broken wheeles: and so at EVERy pace
&gt; The pieces of the Chariot torne lay strowed HERE and there.
&gt; But Phaeton (fire yet blasing stil among his yellow haire)
&gt; Shot headlong downe, and glid along the Region of the AYRE
&gt; Like to a STARRE in Winter nights (the wether cleare and fayre)
&gt; Which though it doe not fall in deede, yet falleth to our sight,
&gt; Whome almost in another world and from his countrie quite
&gt; The River Padus did receyve, and *QUENCHT* his burning head.
&gt; The water Nymphes of Italie did take his carkasse dead ...
&gt; And buried it yet smoking still, with Joves threeforked flame,
&gt; And wrate this Epitaph in the stone that lay upon the same:
&gt; .
&gt; &quot; HERE lies the lusty Phaeton which tooke in hand to guide
&gt; His fathers Chariot, from the which although he chaunst to slide:
&gt; Yet that he gave a proud attempt it cannot be denide.&quot;
&gt; .
&gt; . Wyth ruthfull cheere and heavie heart his father made great mone
&gt; . And would not shew himselfe abrode, but mournd at home alone.
&gt; .
&gt; And if it be to be beleved, as bruited is by FAME
&gt; A day did passe without the Sunne. The brightnesse of the flame
&gt; Gave light: and so unto some kinde of use that mischiefe came.
&gt; But Clymen having spoke, as much as mothers usually
&gt; Are wonted in such wretched case, discomfortablely
&gt; And halfe beside hir selfe for wo, with torne and scratched brest,
&gt; Sercht through the UnIVERSall world, from East to furthest West,
&gt; First SEEKing for hir sonnes dead coarse, and after for his bones.
&gt; She found them by a forren streame, entumbled under stones.
&gt; There fell she groveling on his grave, and reading there his name,
&gt; Shed teares thereon, and layd hir breast all bare upon the same.
&gt; The daughters also of the Sunne no lesse than did their mother,
&gt; Bewaild in vaine with flouds of teares, the fortune of their brother:
&gt; And beating piteously their breasts, incessantly did call
&gt; The buried Phaeton day and night, who heard them not at all,
&gt; About whose tumbe they prostrate lay. Foure times the Moone had filde
&gt; The Circle of hir joyned hornes, and yet the sisters hilde
&gt; Their custome of lamenting still: (for now continuall use
&gt; Had made it custome.) Of the which the eldest, Phaetuse,
&gt; About to kneele upon the ground, complaynde hir feete were nom.
&gt; To whome as fayre Lampetie was rising for to com,
&gt; Hir feete were held with sodaine rootes. The third about to teare
&gt; Hir ruffled lockes, filde both hir handes
&gt; . � � � � � � with leaves in steade of heare.
&gt; One wept to see hir legges made wood: another did repine
&gt; To see hir armes become long boughes. And shortly to define,
&gt; While thus they wondred at themselves, a tender barke began
&gt; To grow about their thighes and loynes, which shortly overran
&gt; Their bellies, brestes, and shoulders eke, and hands successively,
&gt; That nothing (save their mouthes) remainde, aye calling piteously
&gt; Upon the wofull mothers helpe. What could the mother doe
&gt; But runne now here now there, as force of nature drue hir too,
&gt; And deale hir kisses while she might? She was not so content:
&gt; But tare their tender braunches downe: and from the *SLIVERS* went ...
&gt; Red drops of bloud as from a wound. The daughter that was rent
&gt; Cride: Spare us mother spare I pray, for in the shape of tree
&gt; The bodies and the flesh of us your daughters wounded bee.
&gt; And now farewell. That word once said, the barke grew over all.
&gt; Now from these trees flow gummy teares that Amber men doe call,
&gt; Which hardened with the heate of sunne as from the boughs they fal
&gt; The trickling River doth receyve, and sendes as things of price
&gt; To decke the daintie Dames of Rome and make them fine and nice.
