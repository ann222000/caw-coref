John is a wonderful 17 year old student at Tascosa High School in
Amarillo.
On Wednesday October 10th he was struck by 2 vehicles while trying to
walk across a very busy street during a very heavy rain.
Many details are still unknown but he has sustained extreme head
injuries...

.85
This is great news from Dallas. John yesterday was evaluated at a level
of .85 on the scale they use to determine the level of coma.
This scale is from 0 to 5 with 0 being totally out of a coma to 5,
which is the deepest of comas.
Just last week they felt he was at a level between 1.25 and 1.50.
Yesterday they felt he had come up to a level of .85. To say the least
we are all very excited about this. It means that with some luck he
will be out of the coma completely in a few days.
I just got off the phone with Cindy, and today John was following
commands much better. They had him in-between a set of parallel bars
helping him stand. Cindy says you can tell the determination in his
eyes as well as his actions.
He does have a problem with what they call foot drop. This is something
that happens to about anyone that has any kind of brain trauma. It is
where the foot points downward and one is not able to pull their toes
upward. To help this problem they currently have placed the leg in a
cast. They will remove it on Thursday, exercise it and then recast it
if necessary.
Cindy continues to be vigilant in helping John to recover and to recover
completely. Yeah I did good. Too good for those that have known me
long.
I continue to be amazed by the outpouring of support for John and our
family during this very stressful time for us.
Again I thank you all for your never ending support and your continued
prayers.
Love to all
Dean, Cindy &amp; Family
=========================
Father God we come to You for one of Your very own tonight and we ask
You to raise this father up. Your servant has obeyed Your word and laid
hands on and spoken Your word and we know You honor Your word. Father
we plead the blood of the Lamb over Him and speak life into Him now,
thanking you that there is no distance in the spiritual realm for You
and Jesus spoke the word and they were healed. Father Jesus said to
follow Him and to abide in Him and His word and we do so, becoming more
discipled and more like Him as we do so. Father we ask You to
strengthen Rhonda and her family and peace to come forth and that they
enter your rest. Father ask for Your abounding grace now in Jesus for every
member of the family. Father God thank You for hearing us and we are
expecting to receive just like the man at the Gate of Beautiful and
we thank You now. Amen

==========================
Terry,
I am really scared that she isn't going to last too much longer.
Darlene says she is not doing too well with her chemo. She is like
hallucinating or something. They did decide to give her chemo as long
as she can handle it but will stop if she gets too weak. I don't know
terry, it really doesn't look good. She just isn't at all who she used to
be. It is almost like watching my dad die. She is doing the same
things. I think she has given up too and doesn't care anymore. Debbie
This is my friend Laurey i have know her for years she is a good friend
to me please pray for God to touch her soon and heal her in Jesus name.

Friend just asked for prayer for his pastor's wife, Melissa. Pastor
had a brain aneurysm last night following his service and is now on
life support. The latest news is there is no brain activity, but Melissa
unwilling to shut it off. Please pray for her peace in this matter
and my friend has said, &quot;that she would release his spirit&quot;. Pray how

Two teams are in the field recording the JESUS film. One team is in
North Africa and the other team is in South Asia. Please pray for
them. Pray for their well-being, especially their health. Pray for
good communications with the nationals involved with the recording
process. Pray that the voice actors will quickly grasp what is
expected of them. Pray that the recordings will be clear so that the
Master studio can produce an accurate product. Pray that the Lord
would use these new versions for His glory and the building of His
kingdom.

Thank you so much for your prayers.

To all those who pray. My nephew 50 was taken to the hospital. Severe
infection in kidney, bladder and coursing through his body along with
some other complications. They are trying to get the infection under
control so they can do surgery. He will need to be put on Dialysis
during surgery, possibly after as well. I'm not certain of all the
other things wrong in his body but I do know that he is extremely ill.
Your prayers are coveted and as soon as I find anything out I will let
you know. His name is Fred Harless. Thank you for your prayers.

7 MO old Maddie: Please remember liver biopsy
11/27. Date: Mon Nov 26, 2007 10:07 am ((PST))

(Previous post)

Here is the latest:

We have a surgery date for the liver biopsy for Madeline.. November 27
th and 10:30 am and we have to be there an hour prior and it will be a
hour surgery With an ultrasound and x-ray of her abdomen and then the
biopsy itself she Will be put under and will have to spend the night in
the hospital for ~ 1 night
Unless something goes wrong... Also Dr. Robertson wants to do an
ultrasound of Her bottom because of the extra hole she has at the end
of her spinal cord. It is a silent form of spina bifida. Not the kind she
will be in a wheelchair.
I am not sure what all that means... It may require surgery not sure
yet and Then they are looking at her head again to see if there is
anything else they Can do without surgery to correct the shape..

In Christ Almighty Love, Nancy H aka Gods Girl Praying
========================

the hospital for 7-10 days. If anyone wants to send me get well

Please continue prayer for our granddaughter, who is having
trouble with female problems. Also, she needs a brand new
touch from our Lord for personal troubles in her life.

wounded in different areas of her life that need healing
desperately. Thanks so much for your prayers.

The bronchoscope was very productive. Unfortunately they found
lots of casts. Fortunately they were able to get everything they saw
without any significant bleeding. In a couple of days the doctor
will come back and take another look to see if the casts have
returned. In the meantime the RT will attempt to puff a little air into
her lungs and see what happens.

There is a two part problem that needs a two part solution. Part one
is to clean up her lungs presently to get her off of ECMO. Part two
is to treat the underlying cause of the plastic bronchitis. If the
underlying cause is her Fontan circuit, she may be looking at a heart
transplant. I hope that is not the case.

Dave

I kinda feel Maddie is so much in our hearts she has become our
child also Please keep Maddie and her Family in your daily
Prayers. The greatest gift out Lord could give this Christmas is a
healthy Maddie that is what im praying for.
Love you all and God Bless You and Merry CHRISTmas
Love David

Love to you all

Hello My Dear Friends, Please pray for my daughter Danielle who goes
for a follow-up pap smear today. A few months ago they found she had
pre-cancerous cells on her cervix but they removed them. Please pray
that it hasn't come back and that Jesus heals her from head to toe.
Thank you so much for your prayers. God bless you all. Love, Annie

PS Please pass this prayer on if you would. Thanks again.
==========================
I went to the doctor today, after being on the new BP med for a little
over a month. I took my list of BP readings from the last 8 days and he
was very pleased! He wrote a prescription with refills for a year since
it is working so well. Praise the Lord! I also talked with him about
my left shoulder which has been giving me pain more and more over the
past several months. He said some of it may be arthritis. But after
doing some tests (having me extend my arm and push forward and
against his arm, etc.), he thinks I also have tendonitis in my shoulder.
He said he doesn't think an MRI is necessary yet but does want me to
have some physical therapy. I am going to put this off until after
Christmas as so much is going on right now. But please pray that our
insurance will cover the PT as we really can't afford an added medical
expense. I know that God can touch and heal without the therapy so
that is what I am praying will happen!

God bless!
Sue
====================
Shalom,

I need you and your wife to pray for me .........

In 2004 when I went to the doctor they discovered a lump(s) in one of
my breast and I was scheduled to have a mammogram ........ and the
lady that did this was most kind and nice and told me not to worry for
the same thing happened to her and she would pray for me.

I ended up I think having to have this done twice to get an accurate test
reading........ well it came back that I did not have breast cancer and the
lump(s) disappeared.

Now the time has come again for me to have a mammogram so I do request
your prayers in this matter.

I know that Jehovah-Rappha is my healer and my prayer is that HE will
keep cancer out of my body. But I am also like Daniel in the Lion's Den
HE is still G-d if HE does not deliver me.

Love you.

Angela
=========================
Isn't this wonderful news! God is still in the healing business so
don't give up if you are not doing as well. He does answer prayer!

Your Servant and Friend,

Terrie
Hi Terrie,

I just want to thank all the prayer angels for their prayers for Todd
and Cheryl. Todd is doing well now - he's watching his diet and
getting lots of exercise, and his health seems to be doing quite
well. Both he and Cheryl were grateful for all of the prayers. May
God bless each and every person for their faithfulness.

Love,

Shirl
==========================
I wrote to you asking you to pray for Steve, the sixty-six years old
man who had kidney failure on Thanksgiving day. He passed away
the next day. Thank you for your prayers and please pray for his
Mother, wife and children and all family members.
His Mother isn't able to come for the funeral as she lives a long
distance from here.

Gerrie

&gt; infection under
&gt; control so they can do surgery. He will need to be
&gt; put on Dialysis
&gt; during surgery, possibly after as well. I'm not
&gt; certain of all the
&gt; other things wrong in his body but I do know that
&gt; he is extremely ill.
&gt; Your prayers are coveted and as soon as I find
&gt; anything out I will let
&gt; you know. His name is Fred Harless. Thank you for
&gt; your prayers.

&gt; 7 MO old Maddie: Please remember liver biopsy
&gt; 11/27. Date: Mon Nov 26, 2007 10:07 am ((PST))
&gt;
&gt; (Previous post)
&gt;
&gt; Here is the latest:
&gt;
&gt; We have a surgery date for the liver biopsy for
&gt; Madeline.. November 27
&gt; th and 10:30 am and we have to be there an hour
&gt; prior and it will be a
&gt; hour surgery With an ultrasound and x-ray of her
&gt; abdomen and then the
&gt; biopsy itself she Will be put under and will have to
&gt; spend the night in
&gt; the hospital for ~ 1 night
&gt; Unless something goes wrong... Also Dr. Robertson
&gt; wants to do an
&gt; ultrasound of Her bottom because of the extra hole
&gt; she has at the end
&gt; of her spinal cord. It is a silent form of spina
&gt; bifida. Not the kind she
&gt; will be in a wheelchair.
&gt; I am not sure what all that means... It may require
&gt; surgery not sure
&gt; yet and Then they are looking at her head again to
&gt; see if there is
&gt; anything else they Can do without surgery to
&gt; correct the shape..
&gt;

&gt; brand new

&gt; 12:10 PM
&gt; The bronchoscope was very productive.
&gt; Unfortunately they found
&gt; lots of casts. Fortunately they were able to get
&gt; everything they saw
&gt; without any significant bleeding. In a couple of
&gt; days the doctor
&gt; will come back and take another look to see if the
&gt; casts have
&gt; returned. In the meantime the RT will attempt to
&gt; puff a little air into
&gt; her lungs and see what happens.
&gt;
&gt; There is a two part problem that needs a two part
&gt; solution. Part one
&gt; is to clean up her lungs presently to get her off of
&gt; ECMO. Part two
&gt; is to treat the underlying cause of the plastic
&gt; bronchitis. If the
&gt; underlying cause is her Fontan circuit, she may be
&gt; looking at a heart
&gt; transplant. I hope that is not the case.
&gt;
&gt; Dave
&gt;
&gt; I kinda feel Maddie is so much in our hearts she
&gt; has become our
&gt; child also Please keep Maddie and her Family in
&gt; your daily
&gt; Prayers. The greatest gift out Lord could give
&gt; this Christmas is a
&gt; healthy Maddie that is what im praying for.
&gt; Love you all and God Bless You and Merry CHRISTmas
&gt; Love David

&gt; John is a wonderful 17 year old student at Tascosa
&gt; High School in
&gt; Amarillo.
&gt; On Wednesday October 10th he was struck by 2
&gt; vehicles while trying to
&gt; walk across a very busy street during a very heavy
&gt; rain.
&gt; Many details are still unknown but he has sustained
&gt; extreme head
&gt; injuries...

&gt; This is great news from Dallas. John yesterday was
&gt; evaluated at a level
&gt; of .85 on the scale they use to determine the level
&gt; of coma.
&gt; This scale is from 0 to 5 with 0 being totally out
&gt; of a coma to 5,
&gt; which is the deepest of comas.
&gt; Just last week they felt he was at a level between
&gt; 1.25 and 1.50.
&gt; Yesterday they felt he had come up to a level of
&gt; .85. To say the least
&gt; we are all very excited about this. It means that
&gt; with some luck he
&gt; will be out of the coma completely in a few days.
&gt; I just got off the phone with Cindy, and today John
&gt; was following
&gt; commands much better. They had him in-between a set
&gt; of parallel bars
&gt; helping him stand. Cindy says you can tell the
&gt; determination in his
&gt; eyes as well as his actions.
&gt; He does have a problem with what they call foot
&gt; drop. This is something
&gt; that happens to about anyone that has any kind of
&gt; brain trauma. It is
&gt; where the foot points downward and one is not able
&gt; to pull their toes
&gt; upward. To help this problem they currently have
&gt; placed the leg in a
&gt; cast. They will remove it on Thursday, exercise it
&gt; and then recast it
&gt; if necessary.
&gt; Cindy continues to be vigilant in helping John to
&gt; recover and to recover
&gt; completely. Yeah I did good. Too good for those
&gt; that have known me
&gt; long.
&gt; I continue to be amazed by the outpouring of support
&gt; for John and our
&gt; family during this very stressful time for us.
&gt; Again I thank you all for your never ending support
&gt; and your continued
&gt; prayers.
&gt; Love to all
&gt; Dean, Cindy &amp; Family
&gt; =========================
&gt; Father God we come to You for one of Your very own
&gt; tonight and we ask
&gt; You to raise this father up. Your servant has obeyed
&gt; Your word and laid
&gt; hands on and spoken Your word and we know You honor
&gt; Your word. Father
&gt; we plead the blood of the Lamb over Him and speak
&gt; life into Him now,
&gt; thanking you that there is no distance in the
&gt; spiritual realm for You
&gt; and Jesus spoke the word and they were healed.
&gt; Father Jesus said to
&gt; follow Him and to abide in Him and His word and we
&gt; do so, becoming more
&gt; discipled and more like Him as we do so. Father we
&gt; ask You to
&gt; strengthen Rhonda and her family and peace to come
&gt; forth and that they
&gt; enter your rest. Father ask for Your abounding
&gt; grace now in Jesus for every
&gt; member of the family. Father God thank You for
&gt; hearing us and we are
&gt; expecting to receive just like the man at the Gate
&gt; of Beautiful and
&gt; we thank You now. Amen

&gt; I am really scared that she isn't going to last too

&gt; Darlene says she is not doing too well with her
&gt; chemo. She is like
&gt; hallucinating or something. They did decide to give
&gt; her chemo as long
&gt; as she can handle it but will stop if she gets too
&gt; weak. I don't know
&gt; terry, it really doesn't look good. She just isn't
&gt; at all who she used to
&gt; be. It is almost like watching my dad die. She is
&gt; doing the same
&gt; things. I think she has given up too and doesn't
&gt; care anymore. Debbie
&gt; This is my friend Laurey i have know her for years

Messages in this topic (424) 2a. Praying Today Posted by: &quot;Carolyn&quot; ctardd46@yahoo.com ctardd46 Wed Nov 28, 2007 2:21 am (PST) Dear God, More and more people today are concerned with their physical fitness and good health. But what about our spiritual fitness? I know You made us and You want us to take care of our bodies, but more important is our spiritual health. Paul told Timothy to &quot;Train yourself to be godly. For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and life to come&quot; (1 Timothy 4:7-8). Please help me to also work on &quot;firming up my faith&quot; in addition to firming up my body, so that I will be pleasing to You and an example to those around me. I want to grow closer and closer to You and would love to bring others along with me. Lord, anoint me. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

With Much Love From Christ
Carolyn

1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. 3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. 4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah. 5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.

9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

Messages in this topic (4) 6. Colossians 1:13 Posted by: &quot;Mary&quot; merryworker@yahoo.com merryworker Wed Nov 28, 2007 3:10 am (PST) He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into
the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption
through His blood, the forgivenss of
sins.....................Colossians 1:13

Christ took our sins and the sins of the whole world as well as the
Father's wrath on His shoulders, and He has drowned them both in
Himself so that we are thereby reconciled to God and become
completely righteous...................Martin Luther

Dear Heavenly Father,
Thank You for sending Your only begotten Son, Jesus Christ,
to earth to rescue us from out of the darkness. He took it upon
Himself to bear the sins of the whole world so that all who believe
may receive and walk in the Light of the world. I pray for those,
Dear Lord, who are stumbling around in the darkness. Blind to the
Light that is there for their taking. All they need do is to call out
the name of the Lord and allow Him to enter their heart, seek
forgiveness and repent of their sins, and they will be washed white
as snow and given new life in Christ Jesus. In His most precious
name, I pray. Amen.

Phil. 3:14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

A life without a goal is like the captain of a ship without a map and a compass. His ship will just drift aimlessly from day to day hoping to arrive somewhere.

The apostle Paul set for himself a goal! He pressed forward in search for his goal -- he pressed toward the mark of the high calling in Messiah! He had a clear direction of where he was going and he was focused on the Lord! How much more should we!

By setting a goal, we are making a decision to act. We are providing ourselves a map and depending on the Lord to be our compass -- to provide the direction He wants us to go! A goal is more than a dream -- it's a dream acted upon. It's not saying &quot;oh, I wish I could&quot; -- it's declaring what we want to do for the Lord-- it's a declaration of faith!

Let's make our lives interesting -- let's set for ourselves a goal! Let's make a clear declaration of faith, saying &quot;This is what I am going to do for the Lord and then press forward! I can't wait to see where the Lord will take us!

FROM WORTHY MINISTRIES

With Much Love From Christ

Scripture: 2 Corinthians 12:10
&quot;Now I take limitations in stride, and with good cheer, these
limitations that cut me down to size—abuse, accidents, opposition,
bad
breaks. I just let Christ take over! And so the weaker I get, the
stronger I
become&quot; MSG

A recent study on causes of death by accidents breaks down like this:

20% --- Avoid riding in automobiles because they are responsible for
20% of all fatal accidents

17% --- Do not stay home because 17% of all accidents occur in the
home.

16% --- Avoid traveling by air, rail, or water because 16% of all
accidents involve these forms of transportation.
