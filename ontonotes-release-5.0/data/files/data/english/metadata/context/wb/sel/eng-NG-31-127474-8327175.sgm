If only it were all so simple!  If only there were evil people
somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary
only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them.  But the
line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human
being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?

a school of thought that Atheist in knowing there are no consequences

Exactly.  The theist behaves just like the atheist.  Although
proportionately more often.

Which shows your glaring lack of understanding of the word
disproportionately.  If there are 900 theists to 100 atheists in the
world, proportionately you'd expect to find 9 theists for every
atheist in prison, but the actual numbers are more like 50 to 1.

Disproportionately higher.

Application of critical thought. Though the secular laws and judicial
systems we have are not yet perfected they are wondrous improvement
over the past and even involve some deterrent for those too stupid to
understand the value of human cooperation.

Humanity is still primitive but evolving .
Our socioeconomic evolution is paramount to deterring what  you cal
evil. If we don't teach our children the scientific skills necessary
for survival we shall have there by created monsters in much the same
way as has Christian filth.

Abstract philosophical conjecture  regarding a good and an evil are
with out moment to those who have been shut out of the acquisition of
socioeconomic how tos .

At this point the inner schools deliver low grade reading witting
arithmetic, and prison skills.

Fuck the bible , fuck theoretical concepts of good and evil , let's
teach them survival skills in a world where cooperation and teamwork
out strip all superstitious filth of the world and become every day
tools of the good life

.If we teach them how to share the good life of production and
sociability we will not have to provide so many  prisons for them..

Incidentally the representation of Christians in our prisons is
not proportionate to the percentage of Christians in general
population.

Observer:  What makes you believe that all Christians do not believe
in science and discovery?  Do you believe that all scientist are non-
believers in life after the death of human flesh in some form?  This
is the great mystery!  Evolution:  Body &amp; Spirit     Would it be

&gt; What in the fuck is the matter with you ? How about just simple

&gt; understand the value of human cooperation.

&gt; Humanity is still primitive but evolving .
&gt; Our socioeconomic evolution is paramount to deterring what  you cal
&gt; evil. If we don't teach our children the scientific skills necessary
&gt; for survival we shall have there by created monsters in much the same
&gt; way as has Christian filth.

&gt; Abstract philosophical conjecture  regarding a good and an evil are
&gt; with out moment to those who have been shut out of the acquisition of
&gt; socioeconomic how tos .

&gt; At this point the inner schools deliver low grade reading witting

&gt; Fuck the bible , fuck theoretical concepts of good and evil , let's
&gt; teach them survival skills in a world where cooperation and teamwork
&gt; out strip all superstitious filth of the world and become every day
&gt; tools of the good life

&gt; .If we teach them how to share the good life of production and

&gt; Incidentally the representation of Christians in our prisons is

Our chosen group of &quot;greater&quot; scientists were members of the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS). Our survey found near universal rejection
of the transcendent by NAS natural scientists. Disbelief in God and
immortality among NAS biological scientists was 65.2% and 69.0%,
respectively, and among NAS physical scientists it was 79.0% and
76.3%. Most of the rest were agnostics on both issues, with few
believers. We found the highest percentage of belief among NAS
mathematicians (14.3% in God, 15.0% in immortality). Biological
scientists had the lowest rate of belief (5.5% in God, 7.1% in
immortality), with physicists and astronomers slightly higher (7.5% in
God, 7.5% in immortality). Overall comparison figures for the 1914,
1933 and 1998 surveys appear in Table 1.

&gt; Observer
&gt; Read the hundreds of idiotic posts by Christians and you will see that
&gt; very few have had any scientific education , and Look at the monument
&gt; to stupidity they just built THE CREATIONIST MUSEUM.

&gt;  Do you believe that all scientist are non-

&gt; &gt; believers in life after the death of human flesh in some form?

&gt; Observer
&gt; Our chosen group of &quot;greater&quot; scientists were members of the National
&gt; Academy of Sciences (NAS). Our survey found near universal rejection
&gt; of the transcendent by NAS natural scientists. Disbelief in God and
&gt; immortality among NAS biological scientists was 65.2% and 69.0%,
&gt; respectively, and among NAS physical scientists it was 79.0% and
&gt; 76.3%. Most of the rest were agnostics on both issues, with few
&gt; believers. We found the highest percentage of belief among NAS
&gt; mathematicians (14.3% in God, 15.0% in immortality). Biological
&gt; scientists had the lowest rate of belief (5.5% in God, 7.1% in
&gt; immortality), with physicists and astronomers slightly higher (7.5% in
&gt; God, 7.5% in immortality). Overall comparison figures for the 1914,
&gt; 1933 and 1998 surveys appear in Table 1.
&gt; Table 1 Comparison of survey answers among &quot;greater&quot; scientists

&gt;  This is the great mystery!

&gt; Observer
&gt; No it is a great superstition and is completely useless.

&gt;  Evolution:  Body &amp; Spirit     Would it be

&gt; &gt; sweet!

&gt; Observer

&gt;  Yes on Evolution
&gt;  Yes on body(s)
&gt;   no on spirit  its a fucking myth

&gt; What would make it sweet ? Are you that afraid of death ?

&gt; The only thing that is sweet is what can be scientifically verified
&gt; all else is a fucking wet dream .

&gt; &gt; &gt; Observer
&gt; &gt; &gt; Are suggesting that there is set of consequences after death ?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
&gt; &gt; &gt; Or are you suggesting that we should terrorize people with this
&gt; &gt; &gt; fictive threat in order to extort them into a behaviour of which you
&gt; &gt; &gt; approve ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; my not think TWICE (in that

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earthy consequence is the ONE threat to evil behavoir).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Observer
&gt; &gt; &gt; What in the fuck is the matter with you ? How about just simple
&gt; &gt; &gt; Application of critical thought. Though the secular laws and judicial
&gt; &gt; &gt; systems we have are not yet perfected they are wondrous improvement
&gt; &gt; &gt; over the past and even involve some deterrent for those too stupid to
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand the value of human cooperation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Humanity is still primitive but evolving .
&gt; &gt; &gt; Our socioeconomic evolution is paramount to deterring what  you cal
&gt; &gt; &gt; evil. If we don't teach our children the scientific skills necessary
&gt; &gt; &gt; for survival we shall have there by created monsters in much the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; way as has Christian filth.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Abstract philosophical conjecture  regarding a good and an evil are
&gt; &gt; &gt; with out moment to those who have been shut out of the acquisition of
&gt; &gt; &gt; socioeconomic how tos .

&gt; &gt; &gt; At this point the inner schools deliver low grade reading witting
&gt; &gt; &gt; arithmetic, and prison skills.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Fuck the bible , fuck theoretical concepts of good and evil , let's
&gt; &gt; &gt; teach them survival skills in a world where cooperation and teamwork
&gt; &gt; &gt; out strip all superstitious filth of the world and become every day
&gt; &gt; &gt; tools of the good life

&gt; &gt; &gt; .If we teach them how to share the good life of production and
&gt; &gt; &gt; sociability we will not have to provide so many  prisons for them..

&gt; &gt; &gt; Incidentally the representation of Christians in our prisons is
&gt; &gt; &gt; not proportionate to the percentage of Christians in general
&gt; &gt; &gt; population.
