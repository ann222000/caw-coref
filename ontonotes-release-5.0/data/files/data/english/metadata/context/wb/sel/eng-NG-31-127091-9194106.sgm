Russian 'sex day' to boost births
Irina and Andrei Kartuzov - 26/6/2007

[Image: This year's grand prize winners drive off in their new SUV]

The governor of Ulyanovsk region in Russia is offering prizes to
couples who have babies in exactly nine months - on Russia's
national day on 12 June.

Sergei Morozov wants couples to take the day off work to have sex.
If a baby is born on national day, they will receive cars, TVs or
other prizes.

It'll be like the contests for who has the first baby of the year 2000
(am avoiding the &quot;m&quot; word because a pedant might claim it didn't start
until 2001).  Moos are so greedy for the prizes, they endanger the
health of the baby by trying to force an early birth at 12:01 AM on
the day of the contest, often by having a spontaneous C-section.

Stupid Russians, not only the big issue of wishing for a higher
population, but also the smaller issue of encouraging forced births on
a specific date.

It's also bad for the kid's self-esteem: &quot;We only had you so we could
win a TV or a car&quot;.

Hey, let's send all of the illegal overbreeders from the US to Russia -
they'll have more kids than they know what to do with every 9 months. Does
Russia have a good welfare system to pay for them though???

I'm not sure a woman can have a *spontanious* C-section.
An *on demand* C-section would fit the bill, but that's
quite different.

It's not that the obstetricians get mentioned in the news
reports (in the breeder-oriented media), or anything. No,
they performed the delivery then as it was essential for
the child's and the mother's health. Even though they had
to charge 7 hours of overtime in order to be there.

They have lots of bears there, and plenty of woods. No need for
the kid to live long enough to even be aware of their own birthday.

[link to article about Russian contest trying to get people to have
more babies snipped]

Well, stupid as this contest is, and it is, there is some reason to
pay attention.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rates_by_federal_subject...

There is clearly something &quot;afoot&quot; in the former portions of the
USSR. A population change (as in Russia) from 1.9 million in
1990 to 1.5 million in 2004 is something to at least pay attention to.
Radically brain damaged wastes-of-space such as elizabeth will
rejoice at the decrease in dreaded humans. After all, she judges
others by herself.

It's a trend that should be watched fairly closely. Radical changes
in population have often got unpleasant associations, whether
up or down. Many institutions stop working when the population
isn't what was planned for when the stuff was built. A road
system gets mighty unpleasant when the population rises.
However, when the sewer system fails because not enough
people are flushing, as has happened in several cities, things
are also not so pleasant.

But, not to worry. There are ready solutions for the open-minded.
For some strange reason that I've not been able to determine,
Russia has a significant over representation of women. So lots
of women in Russia can't find a mate. Well China, just a hop,
skip, and a jet ride away, has too many boys. And both places
are finding they have some serious social problems due to these
imbalances. A swap is in order.

In reality, the reason nobody is breeding in these areas is that
the places suck rocks through a straw. Make them nicer and
people will have more babies.

I believe the general reason in Russia is that Russian men make lousy
husbands/fathers. Note their falling lifespan and astonishing alcoholism
rates. In fact, how about all those Russian/former Soviet Union kids
being adopted to other countries? A friend of mine and his wife got a
girl from there, blond/blue-eyes, of course. Yes, they wanted someone
who &quot;looked like us.&quot; Of course, they are both brown-haired, brown eyes,
but they didn't want, say, a Honduran kid.

Note that is Russians they are trying to convince to breed.  Russians.
There are huge families of non-ethnic Russians in Russia (and the FSU), but
that's not what the Russian government wants.  This latest breeding project
is the marriage of virulent nationalism and the Orthodox Church, and it's
nasty. It is about breeding for the state,  a common program under communism
and the Nazis.  No good will come of this if it continues.

The kids in orphanages hardly count.  They are for the most part the
children of alcoholics, druggies, and the mentally ill.  Many are
abandoned, neglected, sick, mentally and emotionally damaged, and abused,
and the Russian government, though I think getting better, has not cared for
them sufficiently.  Most of these kids live under very adverse conditions
and at the age of 16 or 18 will be released into the population with a
minimum of education and fall into various mafias, sweat shop work, or sex
work.  back in the late 80s on one of my first trips to Russia (then the SU)
I saw  TV show about the bleak future for these kids--and the danger to
public health and safety they would become if steps weren't taken to clean
up this mess.  Of course, not much was done.

Compared to the number of kids in orphanages, the number who are adopted in
the West is pretty small--and come with their own problems, which I won't
get into here.  Russians traditionally don't adopt since they consider these
kids other people's problems.  The government has started programs to
encourage adoption, but it's a long way off yet.  The exception are the new
rich of Moscow and other large urban areas who are adopting Novgorodian
stock trophies--blond, blue eyed, light skinned...and girls if possible.
Not much different than the US.

Uh, the land itself has never been able to sustain high population.

They are simply pulling a Ceaucescu using capitalist means rather than
direct force.

Since the Soviet Union broke up, homelessness, child abandonment and
sexual slavery has skyrocketed.  Since this is exactly what keeps the
thugs running things, of course they wish to overbreed.

The nogoodness is already a done deal.  However, the Russian Mafia
needs a steady supply of sellable young women, since the main export
for the former USSR is sex slaves, with a strong drug trafficking
trade.  Hardly new; this has been discussed in the mainstream media,

system in America is exploding?  Esp in California?  When you in any
way promote excess breeding, of course the lowest common denominator
takes advantage, look at AFDC.  Sheesh.  Don't bother learning
history, it just keeps repeating itself.

And there were no such places before the Soviet system fell apart.
People did not live on the streets then (and this comes from some
Russian ballet dancers who were amont the first to be allowed to dance
in the USA back in the 1980s).  Sure, life sucked, but it sucked for
everybody, now the mega millionaires in the USSR are richer than
ever.  Organized crime runs just about everything.

Except it's a way harsher place to live than anywhere here.  There are
huge areas of polluted mess, stuff that you can't believe, and it's
not talked about, it's not just Chernobyl.  The climate is
unbelievable, esp to Americans who've never even been in a blizzard or
experienced below zero weather.

You are right about the rampant ethnicism, and this is nothing new.
Ethnic minorities always got the short end of the stick , in Imperial
days, under the Soviets, and from what I've heard, the disparities
between rich and poor are at about pre Revolution levels.

I loved the irony of how the Soviets kept minorities out of power--you
see, they had a really good educational system, and anyone could
attend university if you had the academic chops.  To appease
minorities, they encouraged local primary and secondary schools to use
their native language, and of course, to be in University, you had to
be very proficient in Russian, so the ethnics never could compete, and
because they didn't have the degrees, they didn't get the jobs with
power.

Kinda like what we're seeing with &quot;English as a Second Language&quot;
bilingual programs here.

Name of God the Merciful

Hello

Good Day,

Islam gave women rights and privileges at a time when only barbaric
manners and values dominated.
Yet, some people argue that Islam has alienated women in some domains.
In fact, this belief is a misconception. People who say so, may have
read about it in a magazine or seen it on TV. A quick examination of
the issues judged as unjust to women will certainly correct the
misunderstanding.

Man as the head of the household:

Some people believe that a woman in Islam is regarded as inferior to
man since the Quran says (what means):&quot;Men have one degree above
women.&quot; [Quran 2: 228]

In the Quran it also says (what means): &quot;Men are the protectors and
maintainers of women, because Allaah has given the one more than the
other and because men support them from their means.&quot; [Quran 4:34]

This verse implies that it is a man's duty to support his wife, and
not the reverse, but this, in no way, makes him superior to her.

In fact, the rights and responsibilities of a woman are equal to those
of a man but they are not necessarily identical. Since men and women
are not created identical, they have different physical and emotional
qualities, jobs and privileges. This does not mean that women are
inferior.

On the contrary, women are considered crucial members of society in
Islam since they are assigned the job of bringing up future
generations. People today tend to look down at housewives but, in
fact, raising children is one of the most important and difficult
tasks. The way a mother brings up her child determines the way he will
behave in the future. This duty, which requires patience, love,
understanding and wisdom was significantly assigned to women in Islam
because her nature suits this job.

Allaah The Exalted, in His Wisdom, has assigned a role for each member
of the family so that there would be no arguments concerning who
should do what. If a sailboat has two leaders, each will want to
follow a path, leading ultimately to chaos and even a crash. In the
same manner, how many times have your parents fought over some
decision because each had their own point of view and wanted to apply
it? This is precisely why it is preferable to have one leader for each
household. However, this does not give the leader the right to be a
dictator, or to neglect the role of his companion. This does not make
him superior to other members of his family. It just gives him a
larger duty.

Inheritance:

Some people claim that Islam is unjust towards women because it
entitles them to inherit half of what men get. In fact, those people
only know one side of the truth.

First, the principle of women inheriting half the money is only
applicable in 45 percent of the cases. In the other 55 percent, women
inherit the same amount or sometimes even more. For example, a mother
and a father each inherit the sixth of their son's property when they
are not the only inheritors.

In addition, the laws of inheritance in Islam are proportional to the
duties of spending. Indeed, a man in Islam has the responsibility of
supporting his family, his brother's children (when his brother dies),
his parents (when they retire and do not have an income), his children
from his previous marriage (if he has them) and his household,
including his wife and children. A woman, on the other hand, does not
bear this responsibility. She has the freedom to use the money she
collects from her dowry or work as she pleases.

You might object here, saying that women today are working and helping
their husbands pay the expenses, which entitles them to share equality
with men. In fact, you should know that women's economic assistance to
their husbands, which has become the norm today, is only an answer to
the females' wishes. Islam does not oblige women to spend on their
households. It is a free choice many women have themselves taken today
to feel more liberated, so it does not entitle them to a bigger
portion of the inheritance.

Polygyny:

Polygyny is one of the most questioned principles that Islam grants
men and women. Indeed, many people wrongfully accuse Islam of
injustice because it allows a man to have up to four wives.
Nevertheless, like every instruction in the Quran, polygyny has a
reason. You see, Islam is a practical religion that acknowledges the
needs and temptations of human beings and provides laws that deal with
them, thus preserving harmony and morality.

- Polygyny might be the solution for a couple if the wife is barren,
the husband wants children of his own and the option of separation
does not appeal to both parties.

- If a woman is chronically ill and is unable to perform her marital
duties. Polygyny may also be the solution when the couple does not
want divorce.

- Polygyny is the religion's answer to cases where some men have
excessive sexual needs that cannot be fulfilled by one wife. This in
no way means that men should abuse this right and use it whenever they
fancy a woman. It is rather a chance Islam has provided to prevent men
from committing adultery. Many people who condemn polygyny cheat on
their wives, calling this phenomenon a 'swift affair.' Islam, at
least, has offered the second woman the option of being called 'a
wife' rather than 'a mistress', especially in some countries where
women remarkably outnumber men.

- Polygyny may settle the problem of an increased number of unmarried
women, especially during wars.

However, polygyny has some limits and conditions to be met. Indeed,
the Quran instructs the man to be fair with his wives on all levels,
including treatment, money, house, etc. The only level where the man
may have an uneven stance is the level of the feelings that he cannot
control:

The Quran says (what means): &quot;You will never be able to do perfect
justice between wives even if it is your ardent desire, so do not
incline too much to one of them [by giving her more of your time and
provision] so as to leave the other hanging [i.e. neither divorced nor
married]. And if you do justice, and do all that is right and fear
Allaah by keeping away from all that is wrong, then Allaah is Ever-
Forgiving and All-Merciful.&quot; [Quran 4:129]

Finally, it is worth knowing that Islam gives a woman the right to
refuse polygyny for her husband by setting it as a condition during
the marriage procedures. If this condition is set, then the woman is
granted divorce if her husband marries another while he is still
married to her.

You might ask, why could not there be polyandry (a woman having more
than one husband)? The answer is simple. Islam did not allow it
because Allaah is All-Aware that it will create a problem of kinship.
This means that the child may not know who is actually his father (it
could be anyone of the four husbands). In addition to the
psychological damage it may cause, this problem also complicates the
issue of inheritance. Even birds and animals do not allow polyandry.

In fact, to understand this Quranic verse, you should see another one,
related to the issue in question. It reveals the wisdom behind this
concept.

Thanks

Among the many topics of interest to non-Muslims, the status of Muslim
women and the theme of their rights -- or rather, the perceived lack
of them - seems to be foremost.  The media's portrayal of Muslim
women,   usually outlining their &quot;oppression and mystery&quot; seems to
contribute to this negative perception.

The main reason for this is that people often fail to distinguish
between culture and religion -- two things that are completely
different. In fact, Islam condemns oppression of any kind whether it
is towards a woman or humankind in general.

The Quran is the sacred book by which Muslims live. This book was
revealed 1400 years ago to a man named Muhammad -peace be upon him-,
who would later become the Prophet -peace be upon him-. Fourteen
centuries have passed and this book has not been changed since, not
one letter has been altered.

In chapter 33, entitled Soorah Al-Ahzaab (The Clans), verse 59 Allaah
The Exalted Almighty Says (what means): &quot;O Prophet, tell your wives
and your daughters and the woman of the believers to bring down over
themselves (part) of their outer garments. That is more suitable that
they will be known (as free respectable women) and not be abused. And
ever is Allaah Forgiving and Merciful.&quot; [Quran 33:59] This verse shows
that Islam makes wearing a Hijaab necessary. Hijaab is the word used
for covering, not only the headscarves (as some people may think) but
also wearing loose clothes that are not too bright.

Sometimes, people see covered Muslim women and they think of this as
oppression. This is wrong. A Muslim woman is not oppressed, in fact,
she is liberated. This is because she is no longer valued for
something material, such as her good looks or the shape of her body.
She compels others to judge her for her intelligence, kindness,
honesty and personality. Therefore, people judge her for who she
actually is.

When Muslim women cover their hair and wear loose clothes, they are
obeying the orders of their Lord to be modest, not cultural or social
mores. In fact, Christian nuns cover their hair out of modesty, yet no
one considers them &quot;oppressed&quot;. By following the command of Allaah,
Muslim women are doing the exact same thing.

The lives of the people who responded to the Quran have changed
drastically. It had a tremendous impact on so many people, especially
women, since this was the first time that the souls of man and women
were declared equal -- with the same obligations as well as the same
rewards.

For the first time in history, women were granted economic
independence in Islam. The money they bring in to marriage is theirs
as well as the money they earn. In Islam, women are allowed to choose
their own husbands and in extreme cases, ask for divorce. A woman has
the right to be educated, contrary to what the contemporary world
might think. The responsibility is that of the person who is raising
her.

Islam is a religion that holds women in high regard. Long ago, when
baby boys were born, they brought great joy to the family. The birth
of a girl was greeted with considerably less joy and enthusiasm.
Sometimes, girls were hated so much that they were buried alive. Islam
has always been against this irrational discrimination against girls
and female infanticide.

The Prophet Muhammad, sallallaahu 'alayhi wasallam, said: &quot;Seeking
knowledge is mandatory for every Muslim (male and female).&quot; Men and
women both have the capacity for learning and understanding. Since it
is also their obligation to promote good behavior and condemn bad
behavior in all spheres of life, Muslim women must acquire the
appropriate education to perform this duty in accordance with their
own natural talents and interests.

While maintenance of their homes, providing support to the husband and
bearing, raising and teaching children are among the first and very
highly regarded roles for a woman, if she has the skills to work
outside the home for the good of the community, she may do so.
However, this is allowed only as long as her family obligations are
met and as long as she complies with the Islamic code of dress and
conduct, with no intermingling with men in the workplace.

Islam recognizes and fosters the natural differences between men and
women despite their equality. Some types of work are more suitable for
men and other types for women. This differentiation in no way
diminishes the effort or benefit of one gender over the other. God
will reward both genders equally for the value of their work, though
it may not necessarily be within the same sphere of activity.

The two great roles a woman plays in life are that of a wife and a
mother. The Prophet -peace be upon him-, once said to a group of
Companions:

Concerning motherhood, the Prophet Muhammad, sallallaahu 'alayhi
wasallam, said: &quot;Heaven lies under the feet of mothers.&quot; This implies
that the success of a society can be traced to the mothers who raised
it. The first and greatest influence on a person comes from the sense
of security, affection and training received from the mother.
Therefore, a woman having children must be educated and conscientious
in order to be a skillful parent.

A man came to the Prophet, sallallaahu 'alayhi wasallam, and asked:
&quot;Who among my kinfolk is worthy of my good companionship?&quot; The Prophet
-peace be upon him-, replied: &quot;Your mother&quot; three times before saying:
&quot;Your father.&quot; This indicates the impact that a mother has in a
person's life. So women are highly honored in this great religion.

Islam is a religion that treats women fairly. The Muslim woman was
given a role, duties and rights 1400 years ago that most women do not
enjoy even today in the West. These rights are from God and are
designed to maintain a balance in society; what may seem &quot;unjust&quot; or
&quot;missing&quot; in one place is compensated for or explained in another
place.

From: Al-Jumu'ah Vol. 14

&quot;The best among you are those who are the best to their wives.&quot; This
shows that Islam highly encourages treating the wives well. They
should be shown love, respect and care. To foster the love and
security that comes with marriage, Muslim wives have various rights.
The first of the wife's rights is to receive dowry, a gift from the
husband, which is part of the marriage contract and required for the
legality of the marriage.

The second right of a wife is maintenance. Despite any wealth she may
have, her husband is obligated to provide her with food, shelter and
clothing. He is not forced, however, to spend beyond his capability
and his wife is not entitled to make unreasonable demands.

&gt; &gt; 1.  Saute bacon pieces in a skillet until lightly browned.  Drain and
&gt; &gt; set aside, reserving 1 teaspoon of bacon drippings.

&gt; &gt; 2.  Put reserved bacon drippings in skillet with olive oil over medium
&gt; &gt; heat.

&gt; &gt; 3.  Add sliced onions and &quot;sweat&quot; them for several minutes (do not
&gt; &gt; allow them to brown, however).

&gt; &gt; 4.  Add mushrooms and toss.  Cook mixture for several minutes, until
&gt; &gt; mushrooms begin to soften noticeably.

&gt; &gt; 5.  Add wine, stir,  and cook for 1 minute.  Taste.

&gt; &gt; 6.  Add salt and pepper, as required.

&gt; &gt; Turn dish out into a serving bowl and sprinkle with chopped parsley
&gt; &gt; garnish.

&gt; &gt; Serves 4 ordinary people, or just me by myself.

&gt; Goddammit, I wasn't hungry until I read that post.

&gt; Hmmm, but there must be some kind of mistake - it's
&gt; missing blue cheese! Mild will do, probably can go
&gt; in stage 2 with the onions.

I never even noticed him on this group before. He was plonked
within seconds of arriving in the technical comp.compression
newsgroup as he was clearly devoid of any will or ability to
understand the scientific field.

However, as I'm not offended by people saying &quot;You're one fat
fuck walrus, Phil&quot;, people's need to resort to such comments
makes me chuckle, he's not earnt a place in the killfile for
this group yet.

Right, time for nosh...

I'm not the one that trolls like a professional 3&quot;1 632-pound cock-
sucker on that board. I've contributed way more to that newsgroup than
your sorry fat ass has.

You've contributed nothing but complete bollocks. You are
either utterly ignorant of the field, or doing your best
to come over as entirely ignorant of the field. Calling
you out for your idiocy is not &quot;trolling&quot;, it's &quot;policing&quot;.
Unfortunately for people like you, intellectually I'm armed,
you're not - in fact you're defenceless - and I always
shoot to kill. And you don't like that fact.

Ah, now I remember which loon you are, you're the one
who wouldn't recognise a definition if it was selotaped
to your eyeballs:
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.compression/browse_thread/thread/...

So yup, you're devoid of brain, and not worth reading on
here either.

&lt;PLONK&gt;

only one I could find ATM, I ain't searchin' thru 200 of my posts. But
by the standards of that, callin' me a troll is pretty rich, pal.

Oh yeah I forgot your a moderator. No? Then fuck you. And
&quot;intellectually armed&quot; would be a pretty hilarious description for
some disfigured fatso like yourself, the onlyu seful post I've seen
you make was to that Matrix Swish thread. Then again I haven't read it
yet so I dunno why I'm assuming, all I know is that it wasn't some
&quot;your liek um IGNORANT hehehehe PLONK PLONK&quot;!

LOL. DUDE, I practically SPOON-FED you the fuckin' definition and you
still couldn't get it. Kindergarten time, Phil: if you would ask me to
define text data, would giving you a text file be a definition? If you
asked me to define &quot;video data&quot; would providing a PHILSUCKS.AVI be a
valid definition?

Exactly. And random-appearing data is... random-fucking-appearing,
just examine the files I linked you to and it should've answered all
your questions. I dunno what else you wanted, obviously you didn't
wanna admit that you are simply a motherfuckin' TWAT.
