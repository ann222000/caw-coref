So I have this promising priest on the quest on NAO, who gets
seperated from his pet minotuar and fall down to the bottom level.
First thing I do is engrave Elbereth with my wand of fire, then
obliterate the quest monsters with #turn.  Nalzok shows up, and flees,
showing me where the upstairs are.  So far so good...

I start moving in that direction, when he summons monsters.  A mind
flayer shows up, among other creature.  Elbereth again, and they all
flee.  I put on my ring of regeneration and start whittling on the
nasties.  All of a sudden I get messages like &quot;Nalzok hits, the mind
flayer hits, the umber hulk hits&quot;.  I check the engraving and its no
longer Elbereth.  Huh?  I immediatly branch-port out with the Eye (to
the rogue level), accidentally taking some nasties with me.  Then I
zap myself with a wand of teleport and Nalzok follows.  I do the same
thing with the wand of fire and sure enough, three turns lateer and
Nalzok is hitting me again, and it no longer says Elbereth.  Re-write
Elbereth, wait for everyone to flee, zap wand of digging straight
down, Branch-port back to the quest, and pick up my minotaur.

Anybody have any ideas?

Your wand of fire ran out of charges and you were engraving in the
dust.

No Elbereth is forever.  To keep the E as long as possible you need to
avoid doing things that erode it.  One of the things that erodes E
quickly is to make melee attacks.

If you threw things instead it would last longer.

Best would be to levitate and cast spells.

Wrong. Burned ones should be. Mike's probably right, and Knnn didn't notice
his wand running out of charges so it was in fact a dust-E.

All these hold true for dusted and engraved E-words, not for burned
(/oFire or /oLightning). Obliteration after three turns of melee (as the OP
reported) very much sounds like dust.

ok.
After posting this I realized that the wand may have been out of
charges so I went back and checked.  Sure enough, it says &quot;written in
the the dust&quot;.

Sorry about this.  Serves me right for playing at 2:00am.
