Thoughts on the anniversary of Steve Biko's death
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Last night, over tea at Gramadoelos after the show which had nothing
whatsoever to do with Biko at the Market Theatre, a group of us were
talking and it was mentioned that one of the shows that night was a
Steve Biko thing at the Market Laboratory.  I mentioned that way back
on 12 September 1977 (or even a few days later) I learned about the
death of a man that I had never known.  In fact I didn't even know of
him either.  I was politically naive.  I couldn't really understand
what an impact this had on our country, although I did realise it was
all about murder by police officers who had not only failed in their
duty to protect a prisoner in their care, but brought shame on
themselves and the entire system.  This was a system which I had never
really questioned at the time despite the recent Soweto Uprising which
touched my life so briefly the year before as a college student in
Cape Town.

My revelation apparently shocked my companions, some of whom were more
politically aware (well, one could hardly be *less* politically aware)
at that stage in their lives than I was.  It was mentioned that most
of us became politically literate as a result of various factors,
including the liberal mixing of black and white people as both
performers and audience at the Market Theatre.   I certainly wasn't
acquiring a liberal political education at RAU where I was studying at
the time.

I wonder if the last thirty years have made much difference to my
thinking?  Am I any more politically aware than I was thirty years
ago?  Am I more tuned in to what the masses are thinking?  Am I still
so caught up in my own lifestyle that, while recognising that it
represents a very small minority of people, I am incapable of
visualising life as others see it?

As I contemplated these questions I realised that the life of Steve
Biko was the more powerful for his martyrdom.  If he hadn't died as a
result of injuries inflicted on him by the police while he was in
their custody a new generation now wouldn't be hearing about him.  The
scary thing about this scenario is that without the death of Steve
Biko in 1977, the eventual process which lead to the peaceful change
of government in 1994, I - and others of my hue - might not be alive
to look back on the last thirty years.  A kind of fatalistic destiny
thought.

Ja, nee.  Just thoughts.

I thought that one of the benefits of being one of 'the masses' is
that you're excused too much thinking. 'The masses', as far as I can
tell, have always (since at least the days of the Ancient Egyptians)
thought mainly about food, shelter, sex, booze, soccer/gladiatorial
fights/horse racing/camel racing/etc, the coming weekend, the
attractiveness of their neighbour's ox, the wickedness of the younger
generation, war, literature and politics in about that order.

South Africans are generally far more politically aware, even the
unaware ones, than most Europeans, Ozzies, Kiwis and possibly all
Yanks. I'm sure that Czechs, Russians and similarly previously, or
currently, abused peoples are also pretty politically aware.

It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good - but I agree, it is a
rather cruel irony that matyring somebody can be, ultimately, a
positive force for good.

I always have problems with terms like &quot;politically aware&quot; because the
people who use them too often don't mean &quot;aware of what is going on in
the political sphere&quot; but really mean &quot;sides with me&quot; or, if you're
cynical like me, &quot;we are one-step removed from the facists&quot;.

I had an interesting conversation some years ago with somebody at
Earthlife Africa. I was starting to think that finding out more about
environmental issues was a good idea and Earthlife seemed to be the
bunch who were addressing such issues (this was the late 80s).

I gave them a call and expressed interest.

They asked about my party political affiliations and I asked them what
the heck that had to do with the environment?

The reply was that Earthlife were a &quot;politically aware&quot; organisation.
I then asked if they actually believed that membership of a specific
party meant that one was more or less concerned with environmental
issues, and further asked if they didn't think it would be
constructive to reach people across the political concerned about the
environment and perhaps allow these people to find some common ground.

So the person at the other end asked who I'd voted for in the last
election.

By now I was peeved and smelt a rat and feeling a tad mischievous, so
I said &quot;KP&quot;.

I was told &quot;don't bother applying for membership&quot;.

But if we're talking about being aware of what is going on around one,
and degrees of awareness, then I must congratulate you on at least
knowing, at the time, that Biko had died whilst in custody.

Several people that I know claim that at the time they didn't know
anything about political prisoners dying in custody or even that there
WERE political prisoners, that there was a system called apartheid,
that there were laws that entrenched discrimination and disadvantaged
South Africans on the basis of skin colour etc etc.

I find this hard to believe, but then I can remember conversations I
had with various people in the 70s and 80s in which the risible and
scurrilous claims that I made about things like there being a seperate
education system and policy for black South Africans were given the
pooh-poohing that they deserved and were denounced as lies.

So there you go...

I'm obviously not politically aware enough - who are 'KP'? I wouldn't,
of course, vote for them, since I don't vote for anybody, but I'd be
interested to read their manifesto if they're that distasteful to pinkos.

I certainly knew these things at the time and, as far as I know the
people I met knew about them too. One of my happiest memories was the
day we learned that the monster Verwoerd had been assasinated, I
remember it so clearly, we had been playing by the Frangi-pani tree and
the news lit up the day with delight.

Of course, that is one way of thinking.  I know you don't give a damn
about politically correct thinking, but it is generally quite bad form
to admit that one considers the masses to be stupid (even though this
is a fact recognised by any one who doesn't consider themself to be
part of the masses).  However, now that you raise the subject I'm
obliged to consider whether I'm any better.  I think about food, sex
and the coming weekend quite often, (and I suppose I work to keep the
bond on the shelter paid, so I consider that for a large proportion of
the day) and the wickedness of the younger generation at most family
gatherings, and the attractiveness of the neighbour's ox almost as
often as I consider the attractiveness of the neighbour, although most
of my neighbours are not as attractive as their oxen.  Admittedly war
and literature feature somewhat less.  And politics, indeed, only when
the subject is thrust upon me.  Nah!  It would appear I'm one of the
masses, if not one of the 'great unwashed'.  That's quite a
frightening thought given with what loathing I consider the
masses.  :-)

More politically aware specifically, or better informed generally?
I've had a few dealings with young people in Toastmasters where
they've been given permission to speak freely about anything they're
interested in for 5-7 minutes.  And I've mostly been impressed with
what they come up with. (Never end a sentence on a preposition unless
one can't think of anything else to end it with).

Judging by some of the teen movies I've been subjected to recently
American teenagers don't even have the brain power of fluffy white
rabbits.

A trend that I'm noticing is that young people are not speaking about
the politicised themes they were addressing fifteen years ago.  They
now speak on health, wealth and happiness.  We're turning out a
generation of motivational speakers.

&gt;
The masses couldn't possibly be wrong about everything, that'd be a form
of sense all on its own.

You're confusing 'if - then' with 'if and only if - then'. If you are
one of the masses then you will do X, does not mean that, if you do X,
then you are one of the masses.

I think more politically aware specifically. When I first moved to the
UK in 1980, I was pretty shocked at the level of ignorance and
indifference that my peers had towards politics - but it made sense, it
wasn't a matter of life and death to understand it.

I meant it to be &quot;going on the political sphere&quot;.  I'm given to being
a &quot;space cadet&quot; according to a friend.  That or an &quot;idiot savant&quot; of
sorts.  I'm quite lucid on points which interest me, but a bit vague
in other spheres.  I've shared before that I was in Standard 3 (Grade
5 in today's terminology) before I worked out that one is supposed to
run as fast as one can in a race.  I remember the moment lucidly.  It
was after I'd finished dead last and someone was teasing me.

No.  That was specifically stated at the time.  But I did have an
inkling that all the people who committed suicide by jumping out of
the window, or hanging themselves in the showers, of dying while
slipping on the soap, were actually being murdered in police custody.
I just don't recall feeling much more than mild righteous indignation
about it back then.  Later, yes.  But in 1977? No.   Human rights
abuses didn't mean much to me.  Admittedly I was at RAU and the
culture there was not to think too broadly for oneself along political
lines.  I remember meeting this gorgeous, tanned environmentally aware
hunk named Deon, who also happened to be politically very liberal
(skandaal!) and knowing that he was friends with some &quot;funny&quot; people,
but I was no more interested in his politics than I was of the son of
one of the cabinet ministers (or some such awesome position) who also
studied with me and who occasionally invited me to his home for a meal
while we worked.  In fact, I don't have a clue what his political
leanings were.  His sexual proclivities were another thing altogether,
though.  He was gay.  I was the cover.

A lot of people don't understand about servants. Firstly that it is an
honourable thing to be a servant and it is a job in which you can take
pride - many jobs are, in fact, a matter of serving people, even if it
is less direct than being a domestic servant or a valet, say.

I think that it happened after the war. Before the war people had money
to employ servants, after it, because wars cost a lot of money, they
didn't. So, as people often do, they made a virtue out of necessity and
are now inverse snobs about servants. Just don't let it bother you, it's
only another manifestation of political correctness - they'd like to
feel superior about doing their own ironing and look down on you for, as
you say, giving somebody a job, along with the relative security and
dignity that comes with that. As with all such attempts, it's best
simply to laugh at them and point out their hypocrisy and ignorance.

The old Conservative Party - Treunicht's bunch. I might not have said
&quot;KP&quot; in that many letters at the time, but I  give the the other,
politically aware, party reason to believe that I had voted
Conservative.

I was living in Yeoville at the time. Round about that time there'd
been a &quot;Yeoville Resident's Association&quot; formed to represent the
interests of the good people of Yeoville. And there was a Yeoville
Mardi Gras. And it was announced that at the Mardi Gras in the year in
question there would be a &quot;Speakers Corner&quot;.

Now I am seldom short of an opinion and decided to take myself along
to said Speakers Corner. I had an idea about what was really going on
- I was more right than I thought.

Turned out that the Speakers Corner was run by said residents
association - and that nobody could speak without YRA approval. So I
asked for permission to speak, assuring them that I was indeed a
resident, had been for many years, was not intoxicated and would do my
best to not overrun whatever allocation of time I was given. Well, of
course (and silly old me and all that) my application hadn't been
ratified by the YRA executive.

Which got me onto another subject: Who were the YRA, who was on the
executive and who chose them. After all, I'd live in Yeoville for
years and nobody had asked me to nominate or vote for anybody and I
really couldn't recall any public meetings or information campaigns.

Well you'd think I had just emerged from the deepest bowels of hell.
Why did I need to know who was on the executive, or ask questions
about how they got appointed? What was I? A Nat?

So I thanked them for their time and informed them that I was going to
try and find some other organisation that understood a little bit
about democracy.

Then they got really cross....

Dharma Yoga, the yoga or work, would suggest that it's actually very
good for you, not quite good enough that you could charge people to come
around to work for you.

I don't iron my shirts myself now, so I have extremely well ironed
shirts. When I did iron my own shirts, though, I found it a very
pleasant meditative process, particularly with a good steam iron with
lots of buttons to play with.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I wonder if the last thirty years have made much difference to my
&gt;&gt; &gt; thinking?  Am I any more politically aware than I was thirty years
&gt;&gt; &gt; ago?  Am I more tuned in to what the masses are thinking?  Am I still
&gt;&gt; &gt; so caught up in my own lifestyle that, while recognising that it
&gt;&gt; &gt; represents a very small minority of people, I am incapable of
&gt;&gt; &gt; visualising life as others see it?

&gt;&gt; I thought that one of the benefits of being one of 'the masses' is
&gt;&gt; that you're excused too much thinking. 'The masses', as far as I can
&gt;&gt; tell, have always (since at least the days of the Ancient Egyptians)
&gt;&gt; thought mainly about food, shelter, sex, booze, soccer/gladiatorial
&gt;&gt; fights/horse racing/camel racing/etc, the coming weekend, the
&gt;&gt; attractiveness of their neighbour's ox, the wickedness of the younger
&gt;&gt; generation, war, literature and politics in about that order.

&gt; Of course, that is one way of thinking.  I know you don't give a damn
&gt; about politically correct thinking, but it is generally quite bad form
&gt; to admit that one considers the masses to be stupid (even though this
&gt; is a fact recognised by any one who doesn't consider themself to be
&gt; part of the masses).  However, now that you raise the subject I'm
&gt; obliged to consider whether I'm any better.  I think about food, sex
&gt; and the coming weekend quite often, (and I suppose I work to keep the
&gt; bond on the shelter paid, so I consider that for a large proportion of
&gt; the day) and the wickedness of the younger generation at most family
&gt; gatherings, and the attractiveness of the neighbour's ox almost as
&gt; often as I consider the attractiveness of the neighbour, although most
&gt; of my neighbours are not as attractive as their oxen.  Admittedly war
&gt; and literature feature somewhat less.  And politics, indeed, only when
&gt; the subject is thrust upon me.  Nah!  It would appear I'm one of the
&gt; masses, if not one of the 'great unwashed'.  That's quite a
&gt; frightening thought given with what loathing I consider the
&gt; masses.  :-)

&gt;&gt; South Africans are generally far more politically aware, even the
&gt;&gt; unaware ones, than most Europeans, Ozzies, Kiwis and possibly all
&gt;&gt; Yanks. I'm sure that Czechs, Russians and similarly previously, or
&gt;&gt; currently, abused peoples are also pretty politically aware.

&gt; More politically aware specifically, or better informed generally?
&gt; I've had a few dealings with young people in Toastmasters where
&gt; they've been given permission to speak freely about anything they're
&gt; interested in for 5-7 minutes.  And I've mostly been impressed with
&gt; what they come up with. (Never end a sentence on a preposition unless
&gt; one can't think of anything else to end it with).

That is interesting Moira...are you active &quot;Toast-mastres&quot; or
&quot;Toastmistress&quot;?
About 20 years back, I joined TM and enjoyed every meeting.
I even got my daughter to join. She was &quot;under the age&quot; but they made
and exception. She is now lawyer and enjoys public speaking as much as I do.
There was not group in Auckland Park - at my time, so we had to drive every
week
to some country club ( can't remember the name but it was somewhere
between Houghton and Yeoville)...

Not any more.  I was a Toastmistress from about 1983 through to 1988 when I
entered seminary.  I was a Toastmaster from 1992 through to 2001.  They are
two different organisations.  In 1987 it became illegal in the USA to
withhold membership from an organisation based on sex and both Toastmasters
and Toastmistress were forced to accept members of the opposite sex.
Toastmasters had a few clubs which allowed women back then, but most were
men only.  Toastmistress changed its name from &quot;International Toastmistress
Clubs&quot; (ITC) to &quot;International Training in Communication&quot; (ITC) and
Toastmasters just continued.

Sounds like the Johannesburg Club which met at Old Eds, or the City Club
which met at Emoyeni in Parktown.  The minimum age for joining is 18.
Toastmasters have special programmes and clubs for under 18s, which is where
I heard the young people speak as described in my post.  A friend, also a
former Toastmaster, which is where I met him, joined St. John.  We now have
speech competitions for the young people in St. John run very much on the
lines of Toastmasters competitions.  So I still get to hear the opinions of
young people.

I know it is a somewhat different thing, but I was fascinated to learn
from a colleague who does volunteer work with school debating just how
much this has progressed since my childhood. An example of the sort of
thing is at:

http://learn.uvm.edu/wdi/?Page=about.html

When I was at at school I was, of course, involved in debating
societies from prep school. I loved the process, but it was all very
amateur. We'd have the odd inter-school debates, but there was no
proper judging or review of the skills, something I found searious
lacunae even then. I wasn't happy that it was left up to simple voting
- I'm not a democrat as you know, so I always thought that a more
interesting metric of the quality of a debate would be the difference
in votes on a topic before and after a debate, rather than simply a
vote taken at the end that might simply reflect either entrenche
positions on the matter or partisan voting for your own side, rather
than on the matter. I longed for somebody credible to provide a
critique afterwards, to provide material for improvement.

Now the matter is far more formal and competitive with leagues and
championships that lead to international debating competitions.
Absolutely brilliant, in my view. I've wondered what is going on in
Cape Town in this matter and whether I could get involved with it.

Public speaking is fun and and important skill for children to
develop, I think, even in these days of e-mail. There's an even
stronger argument, I think for honing skills in arguing for positions
and using the various logical and rhetorical devices.

Regarding the sex exclusion Moira. You may be correct about
Toastmistresses but I'm afraid you are wrong about Toastmasters. My
wife &amp; I were charter members of Boksburg club in 1981 along with
Glynis Reverra (sp) who was a reporter on the Boksburg Advertiser. To
the best of my recollection the only all male club on the reef, at
that time,was Bedford View which was funny considering it was home to
Murray Franz, a womaniser of great repute, sadly no longer with us.

Somehow I also recolect, that our membership in Old Eds (now I know the

about 50/50 male / female membership. However that was in about 1990.

CIS (Chartered Institute of Secretaries) was an all male club for a long
time after the mandatory change as was Johannesburg Engineers.  But even in
the days when I was a Toastmistress I occasionally attended Toastmasters
meetings at Golden City (a club that met at the Wanderer's Club and had
blind Toastmasters as well as sighted ones).  The Eskom one at Megawatt Park
was all male in the 80s, but it was only open to Eskom employees.  My father
reckoned it was pretty dull.  By the time I visited it in the 90s it was a
very different club with a young and vibrant membership.  I dated three of
the members a few times.  I've probably shared about the humiliating
experience of throwing up on a date.  The unfortunate fellow to witness that
one was one of the Toastmasters from Megawatt Park.  Bedfordview
Toastmasters Club wasn't an all male club by the time I joined in 1992,
although I only recall visiting it once.

To do that he had to lower the voting age and allow citizens of South
West Africa (as it then was) to vote.  Oh... and he had to ignore the
stipulation - put in place by Strijdom - that a 2/3 majority vote was
required to enact a constitutional change.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; anything about political prisoners dying in custody or even that there
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; WERE political prisoners, that there was a system called apartheid,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that there were laws that entrenched discrimination and disadvantaged
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; South Africans on the basis of skin colour etc etc.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I find this hard to believe, but then I can remember conversations I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; had with various people in the 70s and 80s in which the risible and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; scurrilous claims that I made about things like there being a seperate
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; education system and policy for black South Africans were given the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pooh-poohing that they deserved and were denounced as lies.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I certainly knew these things at the time and, as far as I know the
&gt;&gt; &gt; people
&gt;&gt; &gt; I met knew about them too. One of my happiest memories was the day we
&gt;&gt; &gt; learned that the monster Verwoerd had been assasinated, I remember it
&gt;&gt; &gt; so
&gt;&gt; &gt; clearly, we had been playing by the Frangi-pani tree and the news lit
&gt;&gt; &gt; up
&gt;&gt; &gt; the day with delight.

&gt;&gt; Can you specify, why would you call Verwoerd a monster? I was under

&gt;&gt; impression that he established your free country. Free from British
&gt;&gt; colony.

&gt; To do that he had to lower the voting age and allow citizens of South
&gt; West Africa (as it then was) to vote.  Oh... and he had to ignore the
&gt; stipulation - put in place by Strijdom - that a 2/3 majority vote was
&gt; required to enact a constitutional change.
">

Do you really think that British colony could be the better choice? As I see
it
he made SA strong independent country - contrary to any other B colony.
It took only the global financial mafia to break it. And let's face it, were
the blacks
better off - before or after independence? As I see it to Brits they were
slaves.
To SAfricans they were different citizens ( apartheid). Not right as well
but which one
was better?

No idea. It's easy to hypothesise afte the event. And England was busy
shedding itself of colonies anyway - so maybe Verwoerd's machinations
just speeded up the inevitable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; it

Maybe... but there was a lot of existing wealth, so all he had to do
was not foul things up too badly.

And wealth (which is what I presume you mean with your reference to
strength) was not on his agenda really - he had told his followers
that SA had to be prepared to be white and poor rather than rich and
integrated. He was an idealist, not a pragmatist.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It took only the global financial mafia to break it.

Really? I thought it was a fine (no sarcasm intended) display of
pragmatism by the Nats on one side and the ANC on the other. Neither
had the resources to continue forever, and both realised that it was
better to strike a deal at the time than fight on and end up being
king of nothing.

Well if Verwoerd's vision had been fulfilled there wouldn't have been
any black SAns.

Also I dispute that they were slaves under England and just a
different class of citizen under the NP. One of the first things the
Nats busied themselves with after coming to power was further reducing
the political rights of non-white SAns. They took disenfranchisement
further than the English did.

What had happened was that at the time of Union England, so as to
avoid antagonism, decided to not interfere with the way things had
always been done in the old Boer republics, and also left the status
quo intact in Cape and Natal colonies. The Nats wasted little time in
taking things to a lowest common denominator.

So, no, I don't believe that the status of non-white SAns was better
under the Nats than under the English.

The Nats deliberately set about entrenching even more racism in the
laws of the country.

The key juncture, really, was when Smuts lost an election to the Nats.
Smuts intended setting in place a system whereby the political rights
of non-white SAns would be gradually restored.
