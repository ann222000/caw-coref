professional service provider (as yet)?During your web surfing, you
might have come across messages,&quot;Support me&quot;,&quot;If you like this
site&quot;,&quot;Tip jar&quot;etc with a small button to donate via PayPal.Also,
payment for services is also common (credit-cards etc). Request for
online payment via credit-cards is something that we bump into every
now and then. It helps if you are a professional service provider, and
say your services are in demand.But what a programmer who, maybe
initially for his personal purposes twisted around the Application
Programming Interface (API) (an API gives access to the building blocks
of the service as well as the public data, which a creative programmer
can put to any use) to develop a wonderful application.There may be a
wide potential audience, but hey, you may not have infrastructure to
nurture an idea till it may or may not become a popular
application.Also, earning money doesn't hurt, does it :)?Here enters
PayPal and other online online e-commerce sites. Registered users of
PayPal can display a donate button (). Tip: Steps to Create your own
PayPal Donation Button
