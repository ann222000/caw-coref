JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES: IS JESUS CHRIST YOUR MEDIATOR?
by Timothy Oliver

The teachings of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society regarding
the mediatorship of Christ are radically at odds with the Bible.
And surprising as it may be to many Jehovah's Witnesses, the
Watchtower's teachings, if true, leave virtually all living
Jehovah's Witnesses without a mediator, and therefore without
hope of forgiveness of sins and life everlasting.

The Biblical View of Christ as Mediator

To really understand this issue one must first have a clear
understanding of the biblical view of the Mediatorship of Christ,
and of the covenant which He mediates.

According to the Bible, Christ is the only Mediator between God
and men (1 Timothy 2:5). The covenant which He mediates is
through His blood, i.e., through His death (Matthew 20:28; Mark
10:45; Colossians 1:20-22; Hebrews 9:15-17, 25-28).

This covenant provides certain blessings to all those who enter
into the covenant. First of all, the new covenant provides
forgiveness of sins (Romans 3:24, 25; Matthew 26:28; Ephesians
1:7; Jeremiah 31:34; Hebrews 8:12; 10:17).

Forgiveness is required because man has sinned against God.
Forgiveness that upholds God's law cannot exist without atonement
for sin.

Atonement requires a perfect sacrifice. Therefore, there is
nothing an imperfect, sinful man can do to atone for his own sin.

A mediator is necessary. Under the old covenant the work of the
High Priests was to mediate for the people by offering sacrifices
for sin. However, this role was only a type of the Mediator who
would come.

In the new covenant Jesus became our permanent High Priest,
mediating for us by offering the perfect sacrifice of His own
sinless life in atonement for our sin, thus providing forgiveness
of sins.

Second, in the new covenant God promises that He Himself will
write His laws on our hearts (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10;
10:16). That is, He is at work for all those brought into the new
covenant to change their innermost being. Believers can be
assured that He is going to conform them to the image of His Son
(Romans 8:28, 29).

Third, the new covenant provides eternal life with God. It is sin
that brought about death (Romans 5:12; 6:23) and put a barrier
between man and God (Proverbs 28:9; Isaiah 59:2). In the new
covenant God has promised (as shown above) to both forgive and
remove sin from our lives.

By His resurrection from the dead and ascension into heaven Jesus
demonstrated that His sacrifice had been accepted. Sin had been
successfully atoned for (Romans 4:25). The wages of sin, death,
was now abolished for all those in the new covenant; they can now
enter the presence of God and live (Romans 6:23; 2 Timothy 1:10;
2:10; John 14:2, 3; Jeremiah 31:33, 34; Hebrews 8:10, 11;
10:19-22).

It must be pointed out that the roles of Christ as Mediator and
as High Priest cannot be arbitrarily separated. They are
virtually one and the same thing. The function of the high
priest, his job, was to mediate.

Christ is our Mediator because He is our High Priest. Mediation
for man before God, fully and inexorably effective for bringing
in all the blessings of the covenant for all those who are in the
covenant, that is what Jesus does as High Priest (Hebrews 8:1;
9:11-15, 24-28).

The Scripture speaks of no work of Christ or blessings provided
by Him, as High Priest, other than those provided by His work as
Mediator. The blessings of the atonement and the blessings of the
new covenant are one and the same, mediated to us by our High
Priest, Jesus Christ.

Similarly, Scripture speaks of no one receiving covenant
blessings without being adopted into the covenant. To receive
covenant blessings is to be adopted into the covenant, and vice
versa. It cannot be stated too clearly or too often: forgiveness
of sins cannot exist, nor eternal life be given, apart from a
Mediator.

The Watchtower's View of Christ as Mediator

What does the Watchtower teach of the Mediatorship of Christ?
First, the Watchtower teaches that Jesus Christ is the Mediator
of the new covenant (Insight on the Scriptures, Vol. 2, p. 360).
Out of all human history, those who are in the covenant,
&quot;spiritual Israel,&quot; are supposed to number only 144,000 (Ibid.,
p. 362). And Watchtower material says expressly, &quot;Jesus'
mediatorship operates solely toward those in the new covenant&quot;
(Ibid., p. 362).

Jesus is Mediator, then, for only these 144,000. And only they
will ever be together with Jesus in heaven. For it is only &quot;by
means of this covenant [that] it became possible for them to gain
heavenly life with Christ...&quot; (Survival Into A New Earth, p. 72).

Out of the several million currently registered members of the
Jehovah's Witnesses organization, only a few thousand are
considered to be among the 144,000 of the new covenant, with a
&quot;heavenly hope.&quot;

Thus, it is expressly declared that for the great mass of
Watchtower members, Jesus is not their mediator and they can
never expect to be with Him in heaven.

Jesus Christ is Both Mediator and High Priest

Watchtower leaders have arbitrarily and unscripturally separated
Jesus Christ's being Mediator from His being High Priest
(Insight, Vol. 2, pp. 362-363). Forgiveness of sins and eternal
life, blessings that scripture declares are integral to the new
covenant, are then said to be available to those outside the
covenant.

The possibility of forgiveness of sins and eternal life for those
in the covenant is the result of Christ's work as Mediator. The
possibility of the same for those outside the covenant is said to
be the result of His work as High Priest (Ibid., pp. 362-63).

The idea that forgiveness of sins (a blessing of the covenant)
can be obtained by those outside the covenant, is promulgated by
the Watchtower's use of 1 John 2:2.

But when the scripture says that Jesus &quot;is the propitiation for
our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the
whole world,&quot; it is not saying that forgiveness is available for
people outside the new covenant. Rather, it means the value of
the atonement was of infinite worth. People presently outside the
covenant can still be adopted into the covenant, and thus receive
forgiveness of sins.

According to the Watchtower, the &quot;other sheep&quot; referred to by
Jesus in John 10 &quot;are persons who are not in the covenant...
who... are being gathered within Jehovah's provision for eternal
life on the basis of their faith in the sacrificial value of
Jesus' blood. They are the same as the 'great crowd' of
Revelations 7:9, 10, 14, and so they have the prospect of
surviving the coming great tribulation...they are included in the
great crowd of prospective survivors of the coming day of divine
wrath&quot; (Survival, pp. 73, 80). They are said to be &quot;putting faith
in the merit of his ransom sacrifice&quot; (Insight, Vol. 2, p. 363)
These, of course, are the Jehovah's Witnesses not included in the
144,000.

Speaking of &quot;putting faith in the merit of his ransom sacrifice&quot;
and &quot;the sacrificial value of Jesus' blood&quot; not only gives the
appearance of being Christian, it naturally leads many Jehovah's
Witnesses to falsely suppose that Jesus is their Mediator. But if
the Watchtower is correct, Jesus cannot be their mediator unless
they are a part of the 144,000.

That so many Jehovah's Witnesses think of Jesus as their Mediator
is, in fact, testimony to the real truth that forgiveness of sins
cannot exist nor eternal life be given apart from a mediator.
Those are provisions of the covenant, mediated by Jesus' blood,
the &quot;blood of the new testament [covenant], which is shed for
many for the remission of sins&quot; (Matthew 26:28).

Speaking of Christ providing these blessings as High Priest and
not as Mediator totally ignores all the biblical facts concerning
the role of the High Priest and the nature of his work to
mediate.

It also contravenes the Jehovah's Witnesses own definition of a
mediator: &quot;One who interposes between two parties who are at
variance to reconcile them; an intercessor; an intermediary agent
or go-between&quot; (Insight, Vol. 2, p. 360)

If Jesus forgives the sins of ordinary Jehovah's Witnesses, those
who are in the &quot;great crowd,&quot; then He certainly has &quot;interposed
between&quot; them and God, &quot;two parties at variance to reconcile
them.&quot; He has become their &quot;intercessor.&quot; By their own definition
this makes Him their Mediator.

Yet they say, &quot;...Jesus' mediatorship operates solely toward
those in the new covenant, i.e. the 144,000..&quot;(Ibid., p.
362).This is actually to deny the possibility of forgiveness of
sins for all others. To claim forgiveness of sins for the &quot;great
crowd&quot; is to deny the claim that Christ is Mediator for only the
144,000. Forgiveness is impossible without a Mediator.

Already, the Jehovah's Witness is faced with a choice. He can
believe the Watchtower's teaching is true, or he can have
forgiveness of sins through the Mediator of the new covenant. He
cannot rationally believe the former and at the same time hope
for the latter, unless he is part of the 144,000. But this morass
of confusion is still not the worst of Watchtower doctrine on the
subject.

The 144,000 as Mediators

Since it denies that Jesus is the mediator for all but the
144,000, Watchtower doctrine has elevated these 144,000 to the
position of being mediators themselves. Note carefully again the
last phrase of the Watchtower's definition of a mediator: &quot;an
intermediary agent or go-between.&quot; Then read the following
statements about the 144,000:

&quot;With Christ they make up the agency by means of which blessings
will be extended to all other obedient ones among mankind&quot;
(Survival, p. 65). &quot;Being made kings and priests

I must admit that of all the people who knock on my door regarding God,
the Jehovah Witness are persistant and aside from the rare Mormon visits,
the only denomination who regularly witness.  Now, if the abortions of
Christianity can afford to send street missionaries door to door, what is
wrong with the rest of the crowd who never show up?  Not interested?  Lazy?
Apathetic?  Selfish?  Too timid?

John,

A man after my own heart.

I am not a JW or a Mormon and have not studied the teachings of either
group.  The JW's do go door to door and while I will be hospitable
enough to offer them something cool to drink and talk about
non-biblical stuff with them; I tell them straight up that I will not
attend their services.  They deserve to be treated with dignity and
respect.  At least they are trying to do the word of God.

I have never seen a Mormon missionary crew in my neighborhood and
haven't spoken to one (or two)  in years.  But they also deserve to be
treated with dignity and respect.  At least they are trying to do the
word of God.

The Baptists in my area don't mess with adults; they go after children
(not the wrong way).  They recruit children for Sunday school and send
transportation to pick them up.  Using the kids to get to the parents.
I do not have respect for that type of behavior.  The AME do the same
thing, go after children to attend church hoping to rope in their
parents through the kids.  Of course the really big churches advertise
on TV and radio; come to our church for entertainment and fancy coffee
and snacks and other activities.  Wonder what happened to Jesus.

In my younger days I used to love to go door to door witnessing; now
they come to my door to be witnessed to.  Like today when the
temperature was 104 we had a bunch of people in my house who needed to
get out of the heat.  Okay, so they came for the air conditioning and
one of them is still lying on my living room couch.  Isn't it the
goodness of God that leadeth men to repentance?  Do I have to speak
King Jimmy; or, can I get away with being nice to people and answer
questions about God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Bible when they
ask them?

I really do have a problem with Carl's hate posts against other
religious groups.  He is another John Wolf, though I suspect John Wolf
knew more Bible than Carl.  Ouch!  I said that?

Years ago while in the military at Fort Knox I worked with a guy whose
whole family was Catholic.  His brother was a priest on the post.  We
would spend hours together every work day talking Bible and had a
great time doing it.  He was smart a go getter and bold.  This went on
for months and then one day he, his wife, and his baby daughter and
myself and two of my brothers in Christ had a picknik at one of the
base parks.  One of my brothers in Christ, trying to impress the
couple with his knowledge of the Bible responded to the wife's comment
about their baby being baptized; that the baby was not saved.  I felt
like hitting Pete dead in the mouth for making such a stupid
statement; but didn't.

Long story short, they got scared and went back to their Catholic
church and became nice little obedient church mice.  Pete did not stop
and think before he spoke.  He did not know the family background or
the security the woman's belief system afforded her.

I will take on the big BB guns like Carl who try to sway people from a
faith he doesn't understand without offering them something to replace
what they will lose.  With regular people, I wait for them to ask me
questions.  Then I know that they think I may know the answer to their
question and that they are willing to trust me to answer their
questions.  My job is reconciling people to God; not changing people
or their belief systems.

I wonder why Carl don't post any of his hate posts against the
Muslims.

Kinda like baptists, methodists, catholics, and people from other
groups do.

I would be willing to bet that fewer JW's are molesters than members
of other groups.  I am not a JW or familiar with their doctrines; but
they do use a lot of fear motivation so I doubt too many JW's are into
heavy duty crime.

You know, folks...I'm beginning to believe that Collins isn't a &quot;Reverend&quot;
but just some atheist/agnostic pretending to be a &quot;Steve Winter&quot;-type to see
what sort of ride he or she can get out of folks. Although Steve Winter was
indeed a heretic, a reprobate and an evil, wicked person he at least
promoted what he interpreted as scriptural lessons. I don't believe I have
seen anything of the sort from Collins. Perhaps the nick comes from the old
horror/soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; which the lead character was named
&quot;Barnabas Collins&quot;? Just a thought.

&gt;&gt; Hello, you filthy reprobate. Why do you put down your brother &quot;Carl&quot;?

&gt;&gt; You will BOTH have plenty of time to &quot;spar&quot; when you are......BURNING
&gt;&gt; IN HELL!!!!!

&gt;&gt; Have a BLESSED Day,

&gt;&gt; Rev. BR Collins

&gt;You know, folks...I'm beginning to believe that Collins isn't a &quot;Reverend&quot;
&gt;but just some atheist/agnostic pretending to be a &quot;Steve Winter&quot;-type to see
&gt;what sort of ride he or she can get out of folks. Although Steve Winter was
&gt;indeed a heretic, a reprobate and an evil, wicked person he at least
&gt;promoted what he interpreted as scriptural lessons. I don't believe I have
&gt;seen anything of the sort from Collins. Perhaps the nick comes from the old
&gt;horror/soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; which the lead character was named
&gt;&quot;Barnabas Collins&quot;? Just a thought.

Carl,

I have noticed that you sure do tell a lot of lies.  How about you go
to a real Christian and ask him to check to see if your are the pawn
of a deceiving spirit?

Carl, you would know how to discern a satanic force it there were
fifty of them around you.  You are about as &quot;spiritual&quot; as a three
year old; except the three year old wouldn't be evil like you.

Name once false doctrine I &quot;embrace and espouse&quot; and then prove the
doctrine to be wrong from the scriptures.

Who did I call a heretic?  I said something along the lines that you
were like a heretic; but did not say you are one.

When did I call a cult children of God?  I did speak of people within
cults being children of God in the context of couldn't there be ten
saved JW's out of the millions of JW's - then I quoted how Abraham
shows you to be a fraud:

Gen 18:32 KJV
And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but
this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will
not destroy it for ten's sake.

Face it Carl, you are a hate monger and a messenger of Satan sent by
Satan to harm the children of God that you chose to speak evil of.
Your words and deeds are too much like those of Satan for you not to
be influenced by him.  I will not say that you are subject to seducing
and deceiving and unclean spirits because one cannot discern spirits
over Usenet.  But you are unclean (unholy by your words and deeds) and
work very hard to seduce and deceive people.  Your posts prove that.

I'm here to help you get on the right path but you will need to repent
of your evil and get honest with God before I can help you.  Then it
will have to be via email or phone so that your false pride will not
get in the way.

Yes, I have seen that, and it confuses me much. I knew that he was not
really believer in the Bible as God's inerrant word, but somehow I
thought he loved fellow Christians. However, when I read such things, I
really have to doubt. I wonder if I should take him serious at all in
future. Surely not when he insults my brothers, my sisters and myself
like that. I did not know he thinks I am in a &quot;cult&quot;.

But - uh - my sister has even said this to me lately... And my
sister-in-law does not invite me to her birthday parties anymore,
because they fear that they might not really be funny for me when they
tear down their husbands in their dirty little jokes. But they are no
Christians and it is to be expected. It is really sad that those who
call themselves Christians like Bible Bob say such mean things. But in
the end, we were not promised the love of the world, were we? We are
told to love one another. They would love us if we belonged to them, and
when they hate us, we know that it is actually the hate against God.
They will do to us what they did to Jesus. The bad thing for them is
that they have no excuse, because they know of Jesus. If they hate us,
they hate Jesus, and if they hate Jesus they hate the one who sent Him.

As you know I even wondered at one point if he was John Wolf

The similarity is very striking

The underlying assumption that supports all this behaviour is that we
somehow are dealing with a matter of salvation.  It is the original sin
doctrine rewritten into Protestant form - the already malfunctioning
Pauline atonement theology gone haywire

I am totally convinced that salvation in this form is a superstitious and
not a realistic concept, and that even within that concept the sub concept
that salvation is dependent on belief is a nonsense spiritually, and
dysfunctional logically, and in terms of reason. I find no basis for it -
except within itself.  Indeed I would go further and attribute it to the
pseudo pagan charlatan doctrine of Paulism that came to dominate
Christianity in the generation after Jesuses supposed life and execution

Carl operates within what German would describes as a Scheinwelt- an
imaginary universe with its own internally artifically ordered logical
rules and concepts.  But it is a human artifact that justifies an entirely
falsely based &quot;religion&quot;. Ass uch it is a form of Paulist thinking

The dominating personality trait displayed  in Carl is the same as within
Wolf, when objectively and externally observed - it is simple separation
from reality - almost a derealisation of the personality into mental
operation within absolute fantasy.

&gt;&gt; The following article from Timothy Oliver shows yet another unBiblical
&gt;&gt; teaching held by Jehovah's Witnesses as taught to them by the ungodly
&gt;&gt; Watchtower Bible And Tract Society.

&gt;&gt; May God bless,

&gt;&gt; JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES: IS JESUS CHRIST YOUR MEDIATOR?
&gt;&gt; by Timothy Oliver

&gt;&gt; The teachings of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society regarding
&gt;&gt; the mediatorship of Christ are radically at odds with the Bible.
&gt;&gt; And surprising as it may be to many Jehovah's Witnesses, the
&gt;&gt; Watchtower's teachings, if true, leave virtually all living
&gt;&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses without a mediator, and therefore without
&gt;&gt; hope of forgiveness of sins and life everlasting.

&gt;    I must admit that of all the people who knock on my door regarding God,
&gt;the Jehovah Witness are persistant and aside from the rare Mormon visits,
&gt;the only denomination who regularly witness.  Now, if the abortions of
&gt;Christianity can afford to send street missionaries door to door, what is
&gt;wrong with the rest of the crowd who never show up?  Not interested?  Lazy?
&gt;Apathetic?  Selfish?  Too timid?
">

I am one of the crowd that won't show up at your door.  I will instead
show up at the rescue mission, jail, prison, soup kitchen, and in
various places where I will teach such as Sunday schools, children's
church, and sometimes Precept Ministry classes.

God does not give the same gifts to all men, but gives SEVERALLY
(differently) as the Spirit Wills, according to the Bible.

So making a blanket statement like that is not a good idea, John.

Just thought I'd put in my two cents worth.

in the Name of Jesus,
