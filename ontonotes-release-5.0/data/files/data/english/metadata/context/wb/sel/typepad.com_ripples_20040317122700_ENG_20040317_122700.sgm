I am learning more about the presidential candidates than I ever
expected and it's because bloggers are free to say what they mean.

They may rant, or persuade with great eloquence, or spit out
mind-numbing arrays of data, but they usually manage to say all that
they want and provide some way to check on their sources.

I don't have to agree with them, and I often don't, but I get reams
of data and some interesting insights when my blogging friends report on
political issues like abuse of the environment , or on the questionable
veracity of a candidate. I can always dig deeper and see what the
original facts were and make a decision for myself.

Not only can I dig deeper, I can read comments which give me every
possible side to the story and give me a good view of the passions
surrounding it as well.

This is in such obvious contrast to contracted media figures who whip
out their sound bites with well-practiced insincerity or indignation,
whatever fits the needs of the moment. There are so many ways to slant a
story when there are no links to follow back to the original source.

This is one presidential campaign that you have no right to remain
uninformed. If you want to know what the candidates have done, or not
done, you just need to search the web.

In the same inquiring spirit, I looked up John Kerry's voting record
and Edward Kennedy's voting record for the past year. I may not agree
with Edward Kennedy, but I do know that he performed his duties as a
Senator. John Kerry was conspicuously absent for most of the last year.
That does not speak well for his capability to get things done. His
indecisiveness is another subject for study.

On the other hand, I am not at all happy with the Bush
Administration's record regarding the environment. That is my next area
of study.

I hope to be able to determine which of the candidates will bring us
through the next four years with the right balance of regard for all
aspects of our complex and democratic society.

I expect to find the answers by searching through weblogs to find the
underlying documents. There is a lot of heat and smoke to get through,
but I will find who has done what and if it means anything in the long
run.

Stay tuned... I look forward to an election year when I don't have to
consider which is the lesser of two evils.

It is wonderful how much information is out there. One of the things
that brought me into the blogging world was the availability of
viewpoints that would never have penetrated into my circle of
"real-life" acquaintances. Lots of work needed to sort through things,
but tremendously eye-opening.

Denny, I think you will never see an election where all candidates
have clean and spotless records. I would venture to say that none of us
would be comfortable if our entire lives were paraded on the internet
for all to examine. Elections are a matter of making choices between
human beings as to who is most fit to lead. Their record of service in
all areas is one of the valid ways to determine whether a candidate is a
grandstander or can be relied on when the chips are down. Likeability
and charisma can get a candidate elected, even though they are a poor
example as a human being and as an executive. I feel that blogs let us
look behind the public facades of the candidates and let us deal with
what we discover. I wrote a post about this on Jan 21, 2004. All we need
is enough data and we can decide the following for ourselves: 1. Does
the candidate make sense? 2. Do I like the way he presents his ideas? 3.
Does he set realistic expectations? 4. Do I feel I can trust what he
says? 5. How does he behave under pressure? 6. How does he behave when
he makes a mistake? 7. Does he address sensitive issues with emotion or
with logic. 8. What proportion of his time is spent proposing solutions
vs attacking other solutions. 9. Is he emotionally tough enough to stand
up for his ideas in the face of extreme criticism. 10.Is he a man of
integrity or does he give the impression he is hiding things? And
finally, does he do what he says he will do?
