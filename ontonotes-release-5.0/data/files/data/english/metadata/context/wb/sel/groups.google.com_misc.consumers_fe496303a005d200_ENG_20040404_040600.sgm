Here in New York City, when you subscribe to
residential phone service, you can choose your default
long-distance carrier (e.g., AT&amp;T, Sprint, etc.) so
that when you make an out-of-town call, you just dial
the number.

Now, aren't there lots of independent long-distance
carriers that you can use for any out-of-town call just
by dialing their prefix (usually starting with 1010..)?
And often the brand-name carriers (such as AT&amp;T)
try to get you to pay either &quot;minimum usage&quot;
and/or monthly fees
so that low-usage customers end up wasting money.

Therefore, my question is, although we have a choice of
long-distance carrier, do we have the option of
choosing *NO* long-distance carrier?

"/> Usually you do have the choice of not having any long distance
carrier but your local phone company may charge you a fee for
that. That is, you may have to pay a monthly charge for NOT
having service.

There are many long distance companies that don't charge monthly
fees. You might try one of them.

"/> Can't speak for NY because I imagine laws regarding this differ from state

Our basic phone service provider is Verizon, and we have chosen not to have
an long distance service. There is no monthly fee for not having an LD
carrier. However, we are still able to dial 800 etc numbers.

For LD, we buy AT&amp;T phone cards at Sam's and the cost per minute is .029
(two point nine cents).

The down side to this is all the numbers required to make a call.
- AT&amp;T 800 number
- 12 digit Card number
- Area code and number desired.

That's a lot of numbers, and it is a real bummer when I make an error
dialing the number I want and have to start all over.

call your residential phone service provider to ask. In the
area where I live, which is about 90 miles south of NYC in NJ,
Verizon does not require that its residential phone customers
have long-distance service; I don't.

getting offers from MCI, SPRINT, AT&amp;T, etc. And with the no-call list, they
are unable to harass you via the phone. Take a look at MCI, they decided to
go around the do not call, and they have been fined up the ass.

If you have broadband and are adventurous, you can try VoIP and get rid of
your phone company entirely. I'd recommend a cell phone or pager for backup,
however.

See  http://www.dslreports.com/forum/voip

Otherwise, it is good to have no LD &quot;service&quot; at all to avoid accidentally
making an LD call. Use Onesuite and program the access number on speed dial.
If you have a Uniden phone you can program it on the Rocketdial button.and
make an LD call with just one touch.

Now you only have to hit two buttons to call long distance.

OBfrugal: My phone is a &quot;Lenox Sound&quot; 13 memory speakerphone,
purchased about a decade ago for $10 from Pic 'n Save (now Big!Lots).

You can program a number into each of the 10 number digits. Across

Since they became obsolete when 911 was implemented, I use them to

&gt;that when you make an out-of-town call, you just dial

&gt;Now, aren't there lots of independent long-distance

&gt;by dialing their prefix (usually starting with 1010..)?

&gt;and/or monthly fees
&gt;so that low-usage customers end up wasting money.

&gt;Therefore, my question is, although we have a choice of

I am with Qwest (the only option where I live). They charge between $1-2 /
month to not have a long distance carrier. We use our cell phone minutes
for long distance, so we don't need home long distance.

Instead, I signed up with MCI and asked for a plan that did not have any
monthly fees. The plan just charged a connection fee for every call, had a
decently low price per minute, and had no monthly fee. Since we didn't use
it, we didn't care. I was also glad I had it for a backup, in case I didn't
have my cell phone for any reason.

Recently I switched back to Qwest for my long distance since they offered me
no monthly fee long distance. I still don't use it, but I like to keep
everything with one company if I can.

You do not need a long distance carrier. This is especially important
if you only make a few calls. Your alternatives are dial around services
or phonecards.

Here is some dial around information:

http://10-10phonerates.com/

As for phone cards be very careful. Some cards advertise unbelievable
low prices but:

Have high per call connection charges( i.e., 1 cent a minutes with a
49 cent connect charge means 50 cents for a 1 minute call)
3,5 or even 6 minute rounding.
weekly maintenance fees.
fake taxes. There are no federal taxes on phone cards. ( I saw one card
which said something like &quot;price does not include federal excise tax of
10 percent which will be based on assumption of average call lasting 15
minutes)
High pay phone surcharges. The FCC requires owners of 800 numbers to
pay the owner of a pay phone 27 cents per call. I have seen charges as
high as 99 cents.

The best phone card that I have seen in Costco at 3.9 cents a minutes
with no other fees other than the 27 cent payphone charge.

So find a LD carrier that does not charge a monthly fee or have
a minimum. They are out there. If you have Verizon local
service, you should be able to take them as your LD carrier with
no fee, and they will pay (or not charge you) to switch. Then
don't use them if you don't want, but at least you won't get an
obscene monthly charge if you make a 2 minute call.
