Woolsey
Carl A. is no different than some of those "Bush bashers",  who lie
about the President,  only Carl is a "Pelosi basher"!
He hates Pelosi so much,   that he's more than willing to believe
(almost) anything bad about her,  and won't waste time finding out if
it's true,  or not!
I don't understand how anyone can have such blind faith in one
political party over the other,  as if one political party can save them
from the other's diabolical schemes!
Most people believe what they want to hear,  and reason has nothing to
do with it!

Is that the best you can do?

First, you hide behind an anonymous remailer.
Then you provide evidence for smearing me but it only ends up demonstrating
that you misrepresent financial reports or don't have the brains to
interpret them.

It is impossible to "smear" Pelosi, she is doing an adequate job of
demonstrating her corruption and incompetence.

Now, shut up and go away until you have the courage to post with a real

"Woolsey" provided a link to prove that Pelosi doesn't own more than $10 Mio
worth of Del Monte stock.  The link shows owners of 5% or more of the stock,
and since Pelosi's name doesn't appear, "Woolsey" considers it proof that my
assertion was incorrect.

The point of my reply was to explain why Pelosi, with possibly a point five
percent ownership, would not be listed as a 5% owner.

Additional googling than brings out that the Pelosi investment is said to be
$17 Million, and that the investment was made through the husband's personal
investment company, thereby shielding the information.

I stand by my observation that Pelosi is the epitome of corruption.

Carl A., obviously has gotten to it's hurt little core because it also
recently
used the anonoymous name of "Carl Leberkahn" to post.

This is one of it's typical anonymous coward tactics of using other
variations of people's names to post in a ligitimate thread or it's own
illigitimate anonymous coward thread.

I do not know if the Palosi's own Del Monte Stock or not. Makes no
difference to me, because Nancy Pelosi is a HYPOCRIT regardless.

What really is HYPOCRISY is this coward twit that comes to our
forum with minus zero credibility calling others Hypocrits when it
is the King Coward of ALL Yellow Anonymous Hypocrits!

It posts on various Usenet Groups but always returns to RORT.
This means it is either VERY bothered by wise conservative
posts here or it is just a Liberal Leftist RORT Regular that is
too coward to come out of it's closet hidey hole into the actual
bright sunlight of real truth and decent discourse. I suspect the
latter.

It will not come out. It is a COWARD!

In order to meet the definition of slander, it has to be FALSE.

That doesn't seem to be the case.

http://www.buckeyeag.com/blogs/index.php?blog=7&amp;cat=31

NewsBusters points out that few in the Mainstream Media will cover this
story given their breathless love for the new Speaker. FoxNews has
picked up the story, questioning the potential influence Del Monte may
have as a major player in the Speaker's District. Doing my own research,
however, I've discovered that the impropriety is much deeper. Speaker
Pelosi's husband Paul, it turns out, owns something to the order of $17
million in Del Monte stock! I wonder if he stands to benefit should
StarKist avoid an additional $2 hike in hourly wages...

Follow the money trail a little further and Speaker Pelosi may have a
sympathetic accomplice in the US Senate. It turns out that the H.J.
Heinz Company owns nearly 75% of Del Monte's stock. Heinz, of course, is
the company owned in large part by the H.J. Heinz family of whom Teresa
Heinz is a major heir as the widow of H.J. Heinz the III, the late
Senator from Pennsylvania. And who did Mrs. Heinz marry shortly after
her late husband's passing? Senator John Forbes Kerry of
Massachussettes! I wonder if they would stand to benefit from StarKist
avoiding an additional $2 hike in hourly wages...

So much for that whole ethics in Congress thing. I wonder if this counts
as a major failure in the First 100 Hours strategy? Who'd of thought
TunaGate would be the first scandal of the 110th Congress?

Update - After BizzyBlog and NewBusters picked up my thread about the
Paul Pelosi connection, I felt obligated to dig a bit further. I've
found a few stories addressing Tom's question about full disclosure of
the Pelosi ivestments. This from SFGate.com earlier this year seems
particularly pertinent:

In fact, Nancy Pelosi's most recent financial disclosure statement shows
just how careful Paul Pelosi has been in his investment decisions.
Because the federal statements require a politician to give only a range
of value for investments, they show the Pelosis' net worth was $14.7
million to $55 million in 2005, ranking them ninth in the House and 17th
in the entire Congress.

The bulk of the Pelosis' money comes from investments in stocks and real
estate. Operating through Financial Leasing Services, his San Francisco
investment firm, Paul Pelosi owns stock in companies including
Microsoft, AT&amp;T, Cisco Systems, Disney, Johnson &amp; Johnson and a variety
of tech stocks.

Real estate investments include a four-story office building at 45
Belden St. in the Financial District, office buildings on Battery and
Sansome streets near the Embarcadero, a building housing a Walgreens
drugstore near Ocean Beach and other commercial property in San Anselmo.

Other investments include a St. Helena vineyard worth between $5 million
and $25 million, a $1 million-plus townhome in Norden (Nevada County),
and minority interests in the Auberge du Soleil resort hotel in
Rutherford, the CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin, and the Piatti
Italian restaurant chain.

In other words, with Pelosi's ivestment firm holding the chips, there
isn't nearly as much transparency here as we might expect.

and then adds more verbiage from SF Gate that proves nothing.

If you had followed the link you cite, you would have found that it
leads to nothing. This is a typical GOP smear campaign with no
foundation in fact.

Here is the truth:

"Democratic leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives recently pushed
through a bill raising the minimum wage.  Soon after, a Republican
Congressman reported "something fishy" in the bill:  an exemption for
American Samoa, where the Del Monte company, through its Starkist
subsidiary, packs tuna for sale around the world.
What's the really fishy part?  Supposedly, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's
husband owns a good deal of stock in Del Monte, which is also based in
Pelosi's California Congressional District.  Building in an exemption
for a constituent company to underpay its employees while pushing a "job-
killing" minimum wage hike?  SCANDAL.

There's only one problem:  It's not true.  Nancy Pelosi's husband does
not own Del Monte stock.  There was an addition made to a page on
Wikipedia noting that her husband owns this stock, but the entry was
removed within hours of its submission - the Wikipedia team keeps a
close eye on its political profiles information to watch for exactly
this type of hatchet job.  Likewise, the connection between the minimum
wage bill and Samoa is tenuous at best:  the bill has been virtually
unchanged since its original introduction in 1999, and Del Monte did not
buy the Samoa facility until 2002.  Lastly, this "news" is being
reported in the Washington Times.  It can be confusing to keep track of
all the Timeses and Posts and Heralds and Tribunes, but let it never be
said that the Washington Times is the most scrupulous or balanced of
news publications in Washington D.C.

Let's review:  Wikipedia entry gets modified.  Republican Congressman
holds a press conference.  Wikipedia entry gets rolled back.  Washington
Times [Update: And others!] report.  Local blogs pick up Washington
Times, making it sound like a respected publication.  In the financial
sector, this would be called laundering:  passing assets through so many
hands and mouths and typesetters that by the time you see them, they
look and sound clean as a whistle.  The only problem is, the laundering
process doesn't give the laundry any more veracity, or remove the stink
of a political hatchet job.
Newly-minted Democratic Congressman Tim Walz is being attacked for co-
sponsoring this minimum wage bill, on the basis of flimsy evidence that
stands refuted, and has nothing to do with the content or intent of the
bill anyway.  Local conservative pundits have spent plenty of electrons
criticizing DFL leaders instead of offering thoughtful, conservative
measures to help the DFL legislative majorities provide a balance of
economic incentive and requisite government program funding. President
Bush has said in recent days that Congressional Democrats aren't
offering an alternative to his escalation in Iraq, echoing the well-
worn "they aren't for anything, just against America" theme.

There's a deeper problem here - the laundering of facts to fit the
purpose of gaining and keeping power.  This purported "story" isn't
about spurring debate or getting real facts into the public domain, it's
about establishing a media narrative that's favorable to leaders who
want to keep the rich and the poor exactly where they are, who are
pushing a war that has made us less, not more, secure, and who seem to
care little for the common good to which they are committed by solemn
oath.  It's not about truthful discussions, it's about trying to soften
a freshman Congressman up for a challenge in 2008.

In the media as in life, caveat emptor:  let the buyer, or in the case
the reader, beware.  Especially when it comes to politics"

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $10/share.  A $10 Million investment represents about 1 Million

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Here is the truth:

&gt; &quot;Democratic leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives recently
&gt; pushed
&gt; through a bill raising the minimum wage.  Soon after, a Republican
&gt; Congressman reported &quot;something fishy&quot; in the bill:  an exemption for
&gt; American Samoa, where the Del Monte company, through its Starkist
&gt; subsidiary, packs tuna for sale around the world.
&gt; What's the really fishy part?  Supposedly, House Speaker Nancy
&gt; Pelosi's
&gt; husband owns a good deal of stock in Del Monte, which is also based in
&gt; Pelosi's California Congressional District.  Building in an exemption
&gt; for a constituent company to underpay its employees while pushing a
&gt; &quot;job-
&gt; killing&quot; minimum wage hike?  SCANDAL.

&gt; There's only one problem:  It's not true.  Nancy Pelosi's husband does
&gt; not own Del Monte stock.  There was an addition made to a page on
&gt; Wikipedia noting that her husband owns this stock, but the entry was
&gt; removed within hours of its submission - the Wikipedia team keeps a
&gt; close eye on its political profiles information to watch for exactly
&gt; this type of hatchet job.  Likewise, the connection between the
&gt; minimum
&gt; wage bill and Samoa is tenuous at best:  the bill has been virtually
&gt; unchanged since its original introduction in 1999, and Del Monte did
&gt; not
&gt; buy the Samoa facility until 2002.  Lastly, this &quot;news&quot; is being
&gt; reported in the Washington Times.  It can be confusing to keep track
&gt; of
&gt; all the Timeses and Posts and Heralds and Tribunes, but let it never
&gt; be
&gt; said that the Washington Times is the most scrupulous or balanced of
&gt; news publications in Washington D.C.

&gt; Let's review:  Wikipedia entry gets modified.  Republican Congressman
&gt; holds a press conference.  Wikipedia entry gets rolled back.
&gt; Washington
&gt; Times [Update: And others!] report.  Local blogs pick up Washington
&gt; Times, making it sound like a respected publication.  In the financial
&gt; sector, this would be called laundering:  passing assets through so
&gt; many
&gt; hands and mouths and typesetters that by the time you see them, they

Thanks for posting that. Yea, laundered news is what the repubs are best
at. The sad thing is, they know it. In the previous thread Carl posted
on Democrate Ethics it was clear then that they were the one's with
ethics issues. Now this apparent lie about Nancy Pelosi's husband owning
the stock.  This unethical behavior of spreading laundered news by the
republicans is going to continue in full force because these people
don't care about the real facts. At least it appears that way because
even when it's cut and dry and as clear as water that what they are
saying is untrue, they don't back down.  It's like telling them their
fly is open and them looking down, seeing their fly is open, then
denying it. They know they are lying and everyone else that looks knows
that thier fly is open. Then there are those other repubs that refuse to
look at the first republicans fly and just agree with him that his fly
is not open. Those type repubs are just as bad because they know they
might be wrong but they just don't care.

Please provide proof that the Pelosis, through their investment company, are
not shareholders in Heinz and Del Monte.

I will accept as proof a clear denial by a Pelosi.

You can't, can you?  So where is the "apparent lie"?

OTOH, I have supplied proof that $17 Mio in stock ownership in Del Monte
does not amount to an ownership percentage covered by the 5% rule.

You alliance with a coward who relies on an anonymous remailer makes me

Ah yes! Yet another anonoymous COWARD. At least you don't seem to
have a long stream of alias names like the "Woolsey" Jerk and alol it's

Woolsey/Hagar Etc. posts here all the time as a COWARD under an
alias because it IS A COWARD. PERIOD. Do you fit that same category?
Why is it that YOU post anonymously? What are you afraid of? What

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for posting that. Yea, laundered news is what the repubs are best
&gt;&gt;&gt; at. The sad thing is, they know it. In the previous thread Carl posted
&gt;&gt;&gt; on Democrate Ethics it was clear then that they were the one's with
&gt;&gt;&gt; ethics issues. Now this apparent lie about Nancy Pelosi's husband owning
&gt;&gt;&gt; the stock.

&gt;&gt; Please provide proof that the Pelosis, through their investment company,
&gt;&gt; are not shareholders in Heinz and Del Monte.

&gt; Carl, if I tell you that Bush owns stock in Halliburton, how are you going
&gt; to prove to me that he doesn't? Tell you what, why don't you prove that
&gt; he/she does own those stocks beyond someone just saying so.

&gt; Carl, your fly is open.

&gt; Ben

Ben,

don't you know that by law all his stock ownerships have to be in a blind
trust?  Same goes for Cheney.  That law doesn't apply to members of
Congress.  Consequently, an affirmative statement by and/or on behalf of the
Pelosis that neither she nor her husband nor their investment company owns
stock in Del Monte and/or Heinz would be very helpful.

I'm willing to bet a four figure contribution to your favorite charity that
such an affirmative denial will not be forthcoming.

Pelosi is simply too corrupt for that sort of clear-cut denial.

That was some snazzy detective work to "out",  Phyllis Stone as "My
Name is Nobody"!  Are you sure she's the "right" Nobody?    That seems
like a pretty common "Nom d' Plume"?
Why would a gal "into" crafts,  and soap operas,  start defending
politicians on RORT,  because the DNC told her to squelch the ugly
rumors about Pelosi?  HawHawHaw!
Perhaps you'll wonder about the wisdom of posting your name,  address,
and phone number on usenet  -  When you're being hounded by those
wonderful folks from Nigeria,  calling to tell you,  about fortunes left
to you by relatives you never heard of!  "Mining stock" salesmen can be
a nuisance too!
I don't know if Pelosi, (or her husband) owns any stock in Dole,  or
not,  but I wouldn't put it past her,  him,  or any other politician,
regardless of party affiliation!
However,  it's easy to believe anything  about "enemies" skullduggery,
real,  or imagined,  which is reaso why Carl posted his "tidbit" of
information on a Democrat he reviles!
