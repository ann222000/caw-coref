WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush's most recent surgeon general accused
the administration Tuesday of muzzling him for political reasons on
hot-button health issues such as emergency contraception and
abstinence-only education.

Dr. Richard Carmona, the nation's 17th surgeon general, told lawmakers
that all surgeons general have had to deal with politics but none more
so than he.

For example, he said he wasn't allowed to make a speech at the Special
Olympics because it was viewed as benefiting a political opponent.
However, he said was asked to speak at events designed to benefit
Republican lawmakers.

&quot;The reality is that the nation's doctor has been marginalized and
relegated to a position with no independent budget, and with
supervisors who are political appointees with partisan agendas,&quot; said
Carmona, who served from 2002 to 2006.

Responding, the White House said Carmona was given the authority and
had the obligation to be the leading voice for the health of all
Americans.

&quot;It's disappointing to us if he failed to use his position to the
fullest extent in advocating for policies he thought were in the best
interests of the nation,&quot; said Deputy Press Secretary Tony Fratto. &quot;We
believe Dr. Carmona received the support necessary to carry out his
mission.&quot;

Confirmation hearings are scheduled to be held Thursday for Dr. James.
Holsinger Jr., the Kentucky cardiologist Bush nominated as the
nation's 18th surgeon general. The nomination has been criticized by
gay rights groups.

Carmona testified Tuesday at a hearing of the House Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform. Also appearing were Drs. C. Everett
Koop, who served as surgeon general from 1981-1889, and David Satcher,
who served from 1998-2001.

&quot;Political interference with the work of the surgeon general appears
to have reached a new level in this administration,&quot; said committee
Chairman Henry Waxman, D-Calif.

Koop is probably the most recognized former surgeon general. He talked
about AIDS as a public health issue rather than a moral issue, which
won him many admirers and some critics. He said President Reagan was
pressed to fire him every day, but Reagan would not interfere.

Koop said that after he left office he had more access to the
secretary of Health and Human Services than his successor, Satcher,
and that embarrassed him. &quot;Dr. Carmona was treated with even less
respect than Dr. Satcher,&quot; Koop said.

A report condemning secondhand smoke was a hallmark of Carmona's
tenure.

Another report, on global health challenges, was never released after
the administration demanded changes that he refused to make, Carmona
said.

&quot;I was told this would be a political document or you're not going to
release it.&quot; Carmona said. &quot;I said it can't be a political document
because the surgeon general never releases political documents. I
release scientific documents that will help our elected officials and
the citizens understand the complex world we live in and what their
responsibilities are.&quot;

He refused to identify the officials who sought the changes.

Carmona said he believed the surgeon general should show leadership on
health issues. But his speeches were edited by political appointees,
and he was told not to talk about certain issues. For example, he
supported comprehensive sex education that would include abstinence in
the curriculum, rather than focusing solely on abstinence.

&quot;However, there was already a policy in place that didn't want to hear
the science, but wanted to quote, unquote preach abstinence, which I
felt was scientifically incorrect,&quot; Carmona said.

I watch the hearings on TV, Carmona said he had to use Bush's
name 3 times per page in anything he released.

Thank you Bush, for being such an ass for 6 years.
