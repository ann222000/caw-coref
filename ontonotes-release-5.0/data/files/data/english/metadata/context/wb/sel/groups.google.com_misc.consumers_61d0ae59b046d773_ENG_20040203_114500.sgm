Hi

I need a favor. I've been asked to speak at a workshop given by a
branch of the National Institutes of Health on Feb. 18th. I want to
talk to them about the social problems/discrimination being caused by the
&quot;war on obesity&quot; and all the recent publicity about how expensive we
are to the economy and how we're all going to die slow and expensive
deaths.

I want people to give me stories of things that have happened in the
last year or so as a result of this increased anti-fat publicity. Of
course, their names would not be used. I'm interested in anybody who was
turned down for a job because of health/insurance concerns, anything
painful that happened to a fat child, nasty remarks, etc.

Of course, as usual I need this stuff right away. Anybody who wants
to talk by phone instead of email can just send me an email with their
number and I'll call them at their convenience. I really need some
back-up on this because without specifics I'll be ignored.

Thanks so much!

We *are* expensive and probably *will* die slow and expensive deaths if we
don't lose weight. Quit whining and take some personal responsibility for
your obesity as the rest of us are doing. Except for the very, very rare
cases of genuine hormonal imbalances, we all have a measure of control over
our weight, and what we put in our mouths. Let's be honest here.
Discrimination agains size or weight is not the same as discrimination
against race or sex -- as much as we'd love to pass the blame for our
obesity onto society.

Michelle,
I found your smoking analogy to be very interesting. This evening I was
listening to a radio talk show out of Richmond, VA. They were discussing a
proposed new $1.00/pack state &quot;sin tax&quot; on cigarettes to help balance the
state's $1billion deficit. Of course, all the smokers were calling in and
saying how unfair it was, and how they're being disriminated against. One
smoker suggested that if they add the tax to cigarettes, they should also
add a $1 tax to Big Macs and Whoppers so that the fat people have to pay for
their sin also! He had a point ...

Discrimination is discrimination and racism is racism, totally different. I
do agree with you though we should and do need take personal responsibility,
whatever our circumstances are. I'd never sue Macdonalds just cause I may
have eaten one to many Big Macs. But we do have to remember that a person
is a person is a person. If you hate fat and what it does to you fine, but
one shouldn't be hated or discriminated against &quot;because&quot; they are fat. Do
you see the difference? All I'm saying is, you can hate my fat, but there's
no need to hate me because I'm fat.

&gt;who was turned down for a job because of health/insurance concerns,
&gt;anything painful that happened to a fat child, nasty remarks, etc.

&gt;Of course, as usual I need this stuff right away. Anybody who wants
&gt;to talk by phone instead of email can just send me an email with
&gt;their number and I'll call them at their convenience. I really need
&gt;some
&gt;back-up on this because without specifics I'll be ignored.

&gt;Thanks so much!

"/> Wow! Lots of idiots jumped on this thread, didn't they?

Hello. You may want to take a look at my post called &quot;The idiot FAQ&quot;
posted elsewhere in SSFA. It Partially Chronicles my battle with the
idiots in this group. I committed the crime of saying that fat people
should not be ridiculed and have been a target ever sense. I don't
mind really but the idiots hurt a lot of other people who are more
timid than myself.

I do not use remailers and I sign my posts with PGP.

If you would like to discuss further-you may want to contact me off
line. My email works.

thanks

WHY did you insist on crossposting to the array of groups you did as
opposed to multiposting? Any posts that you crosspost to a fat
acceptance group and a diet group will almost certainly result in a
flame war. In future please post to each group separately.

&lt;Yes, I know this reply is crossposted. Unfortunately since the
reason for the crossposting may have been to save the poster a few
minutes and a mouse click or three it was unavoidable.&gt;

The decision to give one's lifestyle a complete makeover is not an
easy one, but it is a possible one. I've lost over 70 pounds in the
last two years despite having hypothyroidism, so I don't have the
excuse of my glands anymore. And I did not take extreme measures
to accomplish this. My weight loss was (initially) purely accidental,
based on changing my WOE for *health reasons only*. I figured
since I had a head start, I may as well keep on going.

&gt;|
&gt;We *are* expensive and probably *will* die slow and expensive deaths if we
&gt;don't lose weight.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Discrimination agains size or weight is not the same as discrimination
&gt;against race or sex -- as much as we'd love to pass the blame for our
&gt;obesity onto society.

"/> Women are also expensive to society &amp; corporations. WOmen are capable
of being pregnant and cost companies in not only additional medical
care that would not be applied to a singular male but also must
swallow the impact of lost weeks of work continuity and short staffing
caused by maternity leave. SO based on this somewhat warpeded form of
logic--if you blame everything about a person's body and the resultant
costs on that person and society accepts no responsibility whatsoever,
women can't complain about being discriminated against in the
workplace, since no one forces them to get pregnant and create a
medical condition that will be expensive and incur costs on a business
and their insurance carrier (which is a large part of the concept that
fat people are expensive)

Discrimination against obese is no different than discriminating
against ugly or handicapped or race or sex or smoking.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Quit whining and take some personal responsibility for
&gt;your obesity as the rest of us are doing. Except for the very, very rare
&gt;cases of genuine hormonal imbalances, we all have a measure of control over
&gt;our weight, and what we put in our mouths. Let's be honest here.

being fat causes cancer too), one is diabetes and the other is
surgical. I guess a bunch of names strung together with younger ages

"/> So you are content to just pig out and get fatter and allow your kids
to be fat and that is OK with you? It's been proven that fat people
run health risks just by being fat and thus raise all of our
collective insurance rates. I don't have any problem with a fat person
who is at least trying to diet and exercise, but don't blame you
laziness or lack of willpower on your genes or think that everyone has
to agree that there is nothing wrong with you or your children being
clinically obese.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I would start with refutation of a supposition that fat people
&gt;&gt;&gt; are expensive to the economy.

&gt;&gt;I agree. Anyone with any health issue is going to cost a bit
&gt;&gt;more. The problem of being overweight is quite a controllable
&gt;&gt;one, too. The problem is, fat people have had diets shoved down
&gt;&gt;their throats for so long and told they are somehow less of a
&gt;&gt;human, that many people simply have their ears shut and minds
&gt;&gt;closed, and I don't blame them. I was one of those.

&gt;&gt;However, being a &quot;burden&quot; on society is no excuse for the outright
&gt;&gt;cruelty of which I've seen a fair number of fat people be the
&gt;&gt;recipients.

&gt;&gt;The decision to give one's lifestyle a complete makeover is not an
&gt;&gt;easy one, but it is a possible one. I've lost over 70 pounds in
&gt;&gt;the last two years despite having hypothyroidism, so I don't have
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;excuse of my glands anymore. And I did not take extreme measures
&gt;&gt;to accomplish this. My weight loss was (initially) purely
&gt;&gt;accidental, based on changing my WOE for *health reasons only*. I
&gt;&gt;figured
&gt;&gt;since I had a head start, I may as well keep on going.

"/> No. She is doing great because she is losing weight for HERSELF and
not for idiots like you.

That decision is self realizing and comes from deep within a person.
If you think that you and your fellow sperm cells have anything to do
with that you are delusional.

&gt;&gt; Hi

&gt;&gt; I need a favor. I've been asked to speak at a workshop given by a
&gt;&gt; branch of the National Institutes of Health on Feb. 18th. I want
&gt;&gt; to talk to them about the social problems/discrimination being
&gt;&gt; caused by the &quot;war on obesity&quot; and all the recent publicity about
&gt;&gt; how expensive we are to the economy and how we're all going to
&gt;&gt; die slow and expensive deaths.

&gt;&gt; I want people to give me stories of things that have happened in
&gt;&gt; the last year or so as a result of this increased anti-fat
&gt;&gt; publicity. Of course, their names would not be used. I'm
&gt;&gt; interested in anybody who was turned down for a job because of
&gt;&gt; health/insurance concerns, anything painful that happened to a
&gt;&gt; fat child, nasty remarks, etc.

&gt;&gt; Of course, as usual I need this stuff right away. Anybody who
&gt;&gt; wants to talk by phone instead of email can just send me an email

&gt;So you are content to just pig out and get fatter and allow your
&gt;kids to be fat and that is OK with you? It's been proven that fat
&gt;people
&gt;run health risks just by being fat and thus raise all of our
&gt;collective insurance rates. I don't have any problem with a fat
&gt;person who is at least trying to diet and exercise, but don't blame
&gt;you
&gt;laziness or lack of willpower on your genes or think that everyone
&gt;has to agree that there is nothing wrong with you or your children
&gt;being clinically obese.

"/> If has also been proven that idiots like yourself are cowards in real
life. You don't have to agree. All you have to open that steel trap
mind of yours and realize that life comes in all sizes and that all
sizes have a right to it.

She did do it on her own. She single handedly slapped the FA movement
across the face by endorsing everything they refuse to believe.

She SHOULD be commended for having the stones to admit weight loss is
possible for EVERYONE. Kudos to her for proving it's a matter of self
control and determination.

Kudos to you for highlighting it even further by having no clue what
you read. LOL!

Excessively fat women look ugly. It is impractical to try and have sex when
she's 100lbs overweight and the weight is all fat - but most women ain't
that big.

You of course do know what a lot of Asian women prefer, right? Besides,
after fucking a cute asian chick, experience tells me it isn't all that
except that she looks good on your arm. In bed it ain't much at all. If the
lights go out, any guy whose hormones are more fixed on performance than
looks, is going to go to sleep right there and then.

Ray Simpson, 1945-2002
Fat Acceptance Pioneer

by Marilyn Simpson

Ray Simpson was born and raised in Pasadena, California. Ray worked as a
taxpayer specialist for the IRS for 23 years. He was one of the top, most
knowledgeable people who was honored by his peers and management as one of
the best and hardest working employees throughout his time with them.

As a young fat man, Ray struggled with all the problems we all have as fat
people, and he started looking for ways to protest the way he was treated
because of his weight. In 1969, Ray read in the newspaper about a group
that had started in New York that was fighting the fight for fat
acceptance. This intrigued him and he wrote to Bill Fabrey, who was
mentioned in the article, and inquired about starting a group in the Los
Angeles area. This led to him meeting some wonderful women who worked
beside him in NAAFA. Ray became a lifetime member in NAAFA as he was there
from the beginning. After a while, Ray and a few of the ladies felt NAAFA
wasn't radical enough and they formed the &quot;Fat Underground&quot; and did things
on their own. They wrote position papers about seat belts in cars,
turnstiles in grocery stores, etc. Early on when seatbelts were first
installed there were no extenders and some cars would not start without the
seatbelts hooked up. What were fat people to do? In airplanes they were
giving extenders to pregnant women, but fat people were kind of unaware
they had them and were sometimes embarrassed when they couldn't fasten the
seat belts. In grocery stores it was very hard for a fat person to get
through the turnstiles to even shop. Ray and the ladies wrote these
position papers and went to health fairs, set up booths for themselves and
passed out their papers. They went to Weight Watcher meetings and stood
outside and passed out their papers. They tended to make a lot of noise
regarding the fat acceptance movement. They always felt you could be fat
and happy and have always fought to end discrimination.

Ray was President of the LA-NAAFA Chapter for several years in the late
'80s. While he was president, we wrote a petition for the national board
members to change the name from the National Association to Aid Fat
Americans to the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance. Many of us
were bothered by the word AID in the name; we felt it was labeling us as
&quot;handicapped&quot;. We wanted acceptance - not aid. The Board of Directors voted
on this and thus, the new name for NAAFA.

My name is Marilyn (Mann - Kastleman) Simpson. In 1985, at a LA-NAAFA pool
party, I met Ray. The LA Chapter of NAAFA had all come together to have
some fun and finish the planning of the national convention that was to be
in Los Angeles a few weeks later. Ray and I started talking about all the
plays and concerts that we had both been to and all the things we liked and
had in common, not to mention NAAFA, and became instant best friends and
realized we were soul mates soon after. We were engaged within a few weeks
and married just three months later. This man was one of a kind; a jewel of
a man who was a dream husband and stepfather - the true love of my life. He
was a large man, and the most gentle, kind and loving man anyone could
dream of.

Ray showed me the world. We went on several cruises in our 16+ years
together and he had been to some 50+ countries before I met him. His thirst
for knowledge and new experiences was so great. Life excited him so - and
sharing it with me made him so happy - and vice versa. Being a fat man (a
fat couple) never fazed him as far as stopping him from doing the things he
loved. His attitude was that he only had one life to live, this was it, and
he was going to live it to the fullest. He did.

My beloved Ray discovered he had diabetes when we first met in 1985. We
joined the Diabetes Group in NAAFA. He fought the diabetes fight and slowly
lost over 100 pounds over the years, but that was not enough. The damage
had been done. In 1999 Ray had a triple bypass. He had a small blister on
his foot at the same time and that took on a life of its own. Soon one
surgery after another took his toes, then parts of his foot, then leg, then
part of the other foot. He had to take a disability retirement from the IRS
in 1999 and had been struggling hard with the effects of diabetes for the
last three years.

Ray lost his battle on March 5, 2002, but in his short 57 years he lived a
fantastic life. He still believed in and loved NAAFA until the very end. He
fought the fight quietly; he just wasn't an active member towards the end.
We were grateful for NAAFA bringing us together. No couple was happier or
more compatible. We had more fun than two people had a right to have. Thank
you NAAFA!

****

Even after her husband died from the fat he was accepting this nut defends
the cult.

Fat acceptance kills.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I need a favor. I've been asked to speak at a workshop given by a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;branch of the National Institutes of Health on Feb. 18th. I want
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to talk to them about the social problems/discrimination being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;caused by the &quot;war on obesity&quot; and all the recent publicity about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;expensive we are to the economy and how we're all going to die
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;slow and expensive deaths.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I want people to give me stories of things that have happened in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last year or so as a result of this increased anti-fat publicity.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course, their names would not be used. I'm interested in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anybody who was turned down for a job because of health/insurance
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;concerns, anything painful that happened to a fat child, nasty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;remarks, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course, as usual I need this stuff right away. Anybody who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wants to talk by phone instead of email can just send me an email
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with their number and I'll call them at their convenience. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;really need some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;back-up on this because without specifics I'll be ignored.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wow! Lots of idiots jumped on this thread, didn't they?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just one that I see.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hello. You may want to take a look at my post called &quot;The idiot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;FAQ&quot; posted elsewhere in SSFA.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nobody wants to read any more of your idiocy than they have to,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It Partially Chronicles my battle with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;idiots in this group.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You mean the four year spanking you've received for running a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;virtual &quot;fuckwit&quot; bot?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I committed the crime of saying that fat people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should not be ridiculed and have been a target ever sense.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No. You've been a target because you've a repulsive, rude and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;incredibly stupid human being who's addicted to feeding the trolls.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mind really but the idiots hurt a lot of other people who are more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;timid than myself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A touch of humility might improve your rabid cave-man appearance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I do not use remailers and I sign my posts with PGP.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jeez, you'd think someone gave a tiny shit and asked you to fart
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;about yourself for 50 lines.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you would like to discuss further-you may want to contact me off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;line. My email works.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bobbi, cruise for dates elsewhere. You're making us sick.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I rest my case. Thanks for proving my point.

&gt;&gt;You proved all my points. Incredibly stupid? YES! totally illiterate?
&gt;&gt;YES! Addicted to replying to trolls? YES YES YES! Feed them Bobbi.
&gt;&gt;Dance when we command it. Good moron.

&gt;&quot;Feed them&quot;? Do you really think she'd share anything edible?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Could this cros-post

&gt;&gt;YES. thanks for the suggestion, troll.
