*9. Alien abductions - 2* The following cases show that abductions
experiences can involve far more than pure fantasy.
The first reported alien abduction during the modern UFO era occurred in
1957 and involved a Brazilian law student named Antonio Villas-Boas. In the
morning of 16 October while ploughing on his parents' ranch, he noticed an
extremely bright red star overhead. As it approached it changed into an
egg-shaped craft which landed on 3 telescoping legs. His tractor engine
died. He was then confronted by a short humanoid being, which he pushed
away, causing it to stumble and fall. But 3 other humanoids grabbed him and
he was carried on board the craft. The beings were 5 ft tall, wore
tight-fitting siren-suits and helmets, and communicated with one another by
making growling sounds. They stripped off his clothes and 'washed' him with
an oily-looking liquid. Blood samples were taken from under his chin.
Left alone, Villas-Boas noticed a strange odour in the room and finally
vomited. A naked woman then entered. She was slim, with blue eyes, high
cheekbones, a pointed chin, very pointed breasts, and bright red pubic hair.
The woman began to caress him and he was surprised that he felt sexually
aroused. They had sex twice, and the woman also took a sperm sample. Before
she left, she pointed to her stomach and then to the sky. After getting
dressed, Villas-Boas was taken to another room. He thought of stealing a box
with a clocklike face as proof of his experience, but one of the beings
immediately pushed him away. After a tour of the ship he climbed down a
ladder to the ground and the craft took off. He had been on it for more than
4 hours.
Villas-Boas suffered from excessive sleepiness for about a month after
the incident. An examination revealed 2 scars on either side of his chin. He
was also found to have suffered radiation poisoning. At the time the case
was too bizarre for anyone to accept as authentic, even though Villas-Boas
was a sincere, intelligent young man, who eventually became an attorney. It
is significant that he remembered the abduction consciously and that no
hypnosis was used. The case set the tone for the abduction reports that
would follow.
Just prior to the above incident, Villas-Boas had 2 other strange
experiences. On 5 October 1957, he could not sleep because of the heat,
opened the shutters of his house, and saw a bright, fluorescent light, which
seemed to sweep up into the sky. Shortly afterwards he looked outside again.
The light was still there and moved towards the window. He closed the
shutters but the light bled through the slats and through the tiles of the
roof, while he and his brother watched. On 14 October, he was ploughing a
field with his brother late at night when they saw a bright light hovering
in the sky. He tried to get close to it, but it kept moving away [1].
The famous abduction of Betty and Barney Hill on 19 September 1961 had
several parallels with the Villas-Boas case, though the latter was not
publicized until 1966. The Hills saw a UFO following their car on a lonely
road in New Hampshire. Barney got out and saw figures inside. Terrified, he
got back into the car and drove off at high speed. Shortly afterwards, the
couple heard a series of electronic beeps and felt drowsy. Later they heard
a second series of beeps and found that they were nearly home. It was only
some time after the event that they realized the journey had taken 2 hours
longer than it should have done.
Betty became obsessed with UFOs and began to have disturbing dreams,
which she discussed with her husband. Her husband developed ulcers as a
result of anxiety caused by his experience, and also developed warts around
his groin; he later remembered an instrument being placed over his genitals
on the UFO. Under hypnosis they recalled that after the first set of beeps
Barney had inexplicably turned off the main road and stopped before a group
of figures on the road. They were taken on board a landed craft and
subjected to a medical examination. Betty believed she had communicated with
the alien leader telepathically. The couple agreed that the aliens were
about 5 ft tall, with broad foreheads, but Betty remembered large noses and
black hair, while Barney recalled no noses, just 2 slits for nostrils, and
no hair. The hypnotist took the view that they were recounting a fantasy. It
is worth noting that after the Hills' close encounter, they began to
experience poltergeist phenomena in their home, and that Betty had a past
history of paranormal experiences [2].
The following abduction occurred at Bebedouro, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in
the afternoon of 4 May 1969. 24-year-old José Antonio da Silva, an enlisted
soldier, was fishing on a lagoon when suddenly he heard voices, became aware
of figures moving behind him, and felt a burst of light strike his leg. He
dropped his fishing rod and fell to his knees.

Two beings, about four feet tall, wearing aluminumlike suits and what
appeared to be helmets, seized him and dragged him to an object sitting on a
dirt road. The object was shaped like an upright cylinder and had black
platforms at each end. The soldier was taken inside, where the beings put
one of their 'helmets' on him. ...
Da Silva felt the craft rise. The beings talked animatedly among
themselves in a language he did not recognize. After a long period of
travel, he felt a jarring that suggested their craft had landed. The soldier
was then blindfolded and led to a large room, where they removed the wrap
from his eyes.
A being stood in front of him who was extremely hairy and slightly
taller than the rest. His waist-long hair was reddish and wavy. ... When the
others took off their helmets, they were of similar appearance.
Da Silva watched as the beings, at one point more than a dozen, examined
his fishing equipment and took one of every item he had in duplicate. Later
the witness noticed on a low shelf the bodies of four human men, one black,
and became terribly frightened. Later still, the beings gave him a dark
green liquid to drink out of a cubical stone glass.
The dwarf leader then began a strange conservation with the soldier,
mostly about weapons, which was conducted entirely with gestures and
drawings. Da Silva also understood that they wanted him to help in their
relations with humans. When the soldier refused, the dwarf snatched the
crucifix from the rosary Da Silva always carried with him. As the soldier
began praying, a Cristlike figure appeared to him, making revelations.

Shortly afterwards, Da Silva was blindfolded again and taken back to
earth. As the craft landed, he felt he was being dragged and lost
consciousness. He woke up alone near the town of Vitoria, about 200 miles
from where he had been fishing. He was dehydrated and hungry, but drank from
a stream and was able to catch some fish as he still had his rod with him.
Only his identity card, which the aliens had examined, had disappeared. He
had a swollen knee where the ray had struck him and three open wounds on his
neck where the helmet had rubbed against his skin. He had been away four and
a half days [3].

Harry Trumbore)[4].

One of the central questions in this case is how Da Silva travelled the
200 miles from Bebedouro to Vitoria, and where his physical body was during
his 4.5-day absence. If there had been witnesses and video equipment at both
locations would they have observed him being taken aboard a craft, the craft
taking off, the landing of the craft at the other location, and his
emergence from it?     Most of the abduction could easily be a vision.
Jacques Vallee points out the striking parallels between the man's
experience and initiation ordeals. Initiation rituals are characterized by
the following general scenes: the candidate is confronted by members of the
occult group wearing a special costume; he is blindfolded; he is led by the
arm along a rough and difficult route; he is taken into a specially designed
chamber with no windows; he is brought into the presence of a 'master'; he
is given a test and made to answer questions; he is shown a variety of
symbols designed to remind him of death; the situation suggests he may not
survive the ordeal; he is given ritual food or drink; he is blindfolded
again and led outside. All these elements are present in the case of Antonio
da Silva [5].
On 25 October 1974, Carl Higdon, an oil-field driller, was hunting in a
forest in the Wyoming countryside. He spotted 5 elk, raised his rifle and
fired at one, but felt no kick from the high-powered weapon and heard no
report. Absolute silence descended on the forest. The bullet seemed to float
from the barrel and fell to the ground 50 ft in front of him. After
retrieving the bullet, he heard a twig snap (a common feature in
otherworldly encounters). He turned to see a bow-legged humanlike figure,
about 6 ft 2 inches tall, standing near him. His skin tone was like that of
an Oriental, and the face seemed to blend into the neck. As in so many other
cases, the being was dressed in a one-piece suit. His right arm ended in a
cone-shaped device. The man, who later revealed that he was called 'Ausso',
greeted him by saying, 'How you doin'?', and then asked if he was hungry.
Before Higdon could answer, a small package floated toward him. Inside were
4 pills, and he found himself taking one.

*Fig. 9.2.* Alien encountered by Carl Higdon, October 1974. [6]

He then spotted the creature's ship in the distance, and was asked if he
wanted to come along. Before he could answer he found himself inside a
transparent cubical craft, strapped to a chair and wearing a helmet. Ausso
and another ufonaut were with him, and the 5 elk were crammed inside in a
cage behind him. When Ausso pointed his arm at the controls, the craft began
moving and Higdon saw the earth receding below him. Moments later they
landed on a dark planet that Ausso said was '163,000 light-miles' (!) from
earth. Outside was a huge tower with a bright rotating light, and he saw
what looked like 5 humans standing in the nearby plaza. When Ausso pointed
his arm again, Higdon found himself inside a room in the tower. A device
came out of the wall in front of him and examined him for several minutes.
Ausso then told him he was not what they needed and would be taken back.
Ausso returned his rifle and floated the remaining pills out of his pocket.
The next thing Higdon remembered was walking along a road, feeling dazed
and confused. About 2.5 hours had passed. He still had his rifle, but didn't
know who he was or where he was. In the distance he saw a parked truck and
decided to use it for shelter, not realizing that it was his own vehicle.
The truck stood in the middle of a mudhole, with no tracks to show how it
had got there. He used the two-way radio to call for help and was eventually
found. His truck had to be towed out, and those involved concluded it must
have been deposited there from the air. He was taken to hospital, and late
the next day he began to regain his memory and equilibrium.
The bullet Higdon had fired at the beginning of his adventure was
examined by an expert, who could not explain the state it was in. The lead
had disappeared, it showed none of the deformation expected of a spent
bullet, and it looked as if it had been *turned inside out*. Much of
Higdon's experience, however, sounds very dreamlike; some of the details
were recalled with the help of hypnosis. Higdon passed a lie-detector test,
and was considered to be a reliable character. Other people had seen lights
in the sky on the night of the abduction [7].
Another incident very different from the modern standard abduction took
place in Emilcin, Poland, on 10 May 1978. A 71-year-old farmer, Jan Wolski,
was travelling on a horse-drawn wagon along a country road when he
encountered 2 'freaks', as he called them. They had greenish faces, wore
one-piece overalls ending in some kind of foot flipper, and walked by making
supple jumps like divers on the seabed. Suddenly they got into his wagon on
either side of him, but Wolski continued on his journey without saying
anything. He thought they must be 'foreigners', since they had slanted eyes,
prominent cheekbones, and spoke in an unknown language.
A short while later they came across a strange vehicle in a clearing,
looking like 'a bus hovering in the air'. The humanoids signalled to Wolski
to step onto a platform that was lowered from the object. He did so, then
rose up into a dark rectangular room where he met 2 more 'foreigners' who
told him to remove his clothes. After a brief examination with 'two plates',
he was told to get dressed. He galloped all the way home, then returned with
his sons, and they found a series of trapezoidal, almost rectangular
footprints. A 6-year-old boy who lived nearby said he had seen an aircraft
resembling a bus fly very low over a barn, then climb vertically into the
air and vanish. This incident is regarded as a benchmark abduction account,
with little or no contamination from the outside world and none of the media
exposure that characterizes American abduction stories [8].
