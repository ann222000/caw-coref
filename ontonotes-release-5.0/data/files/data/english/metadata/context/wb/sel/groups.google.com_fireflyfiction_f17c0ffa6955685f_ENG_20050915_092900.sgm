&quot;I'm not bothering you, am I?&quot;

He shook his head.

&quot;Bothering? No. I'd have to be doing something for you to be bothering it,
wouldn't I?&quot; He made an apologetic expression. &quot;Sorry, it's just, they're up
there planning strategies and I'm left out in the cold again. Sure, they'll
load me up and expect me to follow, but I can't help strategize...&quot;

Inara gave a patient smile and he stopped.

&quot;Sorry again.&quot; He clicked off the screen. &quot;What can I help you with?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Her face was blank, but Simon wasn't fooled. &quot;I was just distracting
myself like you were. They don't want my superior strategic mind either.&quot;

Silence stretched out awkwardly and Inara smiled again, with interest and
concern this time.

&quot;I was wondering, how's your leg?&quot;

He looked down in surprise.

&quot;My...?&quot; Then it hit him. &quot;Oh! The gun shot? It's okay. Still aches a little,
especially if I'm chasing River around the ship, but it's good.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; She nodded. &quot;Good.&quot;

Something in her voice made Simon look up. A second revelation hit him.

&quot;You're worried about this, aren't you?&quot;

&quot;I've never been shot before.&quot; Voice small and weak. &quot;I mean, there's nothing
to say I will be today, is there? It's just...&quot;

&quot;Possibilities for casualties seem a little high?&quot; He finished for her. &quot;The
thought had crossed my mind as well.&quot;

&quot;Mal does have a tendency to drag us all into danger, doesn't he?&quot; She said
with a small, indulgent smile. &quot;Even if we don't want to go.&quot;

Simon thought for a moment.

&quot;He also has a tendency to be right sometimes.&quot; It was a quiet admission. &quot;He
trusts River and Jonah to get us out of this, maybe we should, too.&quot;

Inara looked at her own hands, twisting into each other in front of her
stomach. Simon looked out to the common room behind her. Neither of them saw
the other nod in gentle agreement.

***

&quot;He's very loud.&quot; Said the man on the right.

&quot;Loud?&quot; Responded the doctor in front of him. &quot;He's just had a round of bullets
put through his eye!&quot;

Screams sounded from the elevator shaft behind them, where several people were
hoisting the man up. The two men with blue hands sighed. They had almost smiled
when they'd been told progress had been made.

&quot;He shouldn't have put his eye to the hole.&quot; The man on the left replied. &quot;At
least now we know they're armed.&quot;

The doctor looked at the data pod in his hand.

&quot;The guards were armed. There were four of them and Dr. Warne down there.&quot;

&quot;Not for long.&quot; Said the man on the right. &quot;The children must know by now.&quot;

&quot;Nobody can leave that basement.&quot; Added the man on the left. &quot;Terminate
anything that moves.&quot;

***

Sebastian and Bethany entered the main room at a crouch, they kept to the walls
as they made their way over to the open elevator doors. It was quiet, the
screaming man had been taken away and the gunfire was at a standstill. Alex
stood with her back pressed against the wall to the left of the door. The twins
to the right. They all had their guns at the ready.

A sudden burst of fire sounded and sparks bounced off the floor. They counted
to three. The fire stopped as they knew it would.

*Now.*

Alex and Minmei turned and fired through the small opening.

***

&quot;Stay there!&quot;

&quot;I don't think so!&quot; Kaylee shouted as they ran down the corridor. &quot;I can hear
the gunfire, too.&quot;

Daniel skidded to a stop and turned to block her.

&quot;Look. There's no one else down here, Sebastian and I scanned the floor. The
safest place for you is anywhere but that room. Do you hear me? I don't have
time for this.&quot;

She stopped short of barreling into him.

&quot;Then let me help.&quot;

&quot;You can help by staying here. Right here. Don't move.&quot; He looked at her
stubborn face. &quot;River would kill me if I got you hurt. Stay here.&quot;

He turned and ran towards the noise. Kaylee clenched her jaw and twisted the
chair leg in her hands, muttering under her breath. She hoped he could read her
thoughts right then. Boy howdy, did she.

***

&quot;Honey?&quot; Zoe asked sweetly. Too sweetly. Wash sensed danger. &quot;What the hell
were you doing to our room?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Now, he knew from experience that when she got like this it ended up a
lot easier, for everyone, to come right out and admit it. Whatever the hell it
was. The only problem now was that he had no idea. Hell, if he knew he would
own up to it, he wanted to own up to it. If he knew what it was, he'd say it.
&quot;I don't...&quot;

&quot;My clothes are thrown all over the floor. It's a complete mess.&quot; Her smile was
not friendly. &quot;And I know that I didn't do it. Which, out of the two of us,
leaves you.&quot;

&quot;I haven't been down there.&quot; He pleaded his innocence as he gestured to the
bridge controls. &quot;I've been here preparing our incredibly incredible canon
confusion defense plan. You know that.&quot;

&quot;I can count to two, husband.&quot; She wasn't even fake smiling anymore. &quot;Minus me,
makes one.&quot;

Wash's mouth thinned out and his eyes narrowed.

&quot;I said I didn't do it, sweetie cakes.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Inara stopped at the door. &quot;I thought Mal was here, I need to talk
to him. Someone's been through my things, my shuttle is a mess...&quot;

Her words trailed off as Zoe and Wash turned to stare at her.

***

She crept down the corridor, inching closer and closer to the main room. Light
flared in time with the sound. The firing continued in short bursts and with
each one she held her breath. There were no cries from this side of the
elevator that she could tell and that was a good thing.

When she got to the corner, she pressed her back against it. Slowly, so very
slowly, she peered around the corner. Alex and Sebastian were on one side of
the doors, Bethany and Minmei were on the other. She saw Daniel and Binh
dragging the guards out of the way.

Daniel looked up and glared at her.

&quot;Stay close to the wall.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Bring that table over here. You get hit
by a stray bullet and I'm not responsible.&quot;

Kaylee dragged the table over and watched him turn it on his side, creating
cover for the five captives. She looked at the faces of the men, some scared
and some angry, all of them glaring. The question didn't even need to be asked.

&quot;These men are innocent.&quot; He explained. &quot;Well, maybe not the good doctor here,
but these guards? Haven't done a thing against us yet, we made sure of that.
It's not their fault who they work for.&quot;

Her eyes flicked to the gun fight.

&quot;Those men?&quot; He answered. &quot;They're shooting at us and are fair game.&quot;

&quot;Okay then.&quot; That was logic Kaylee could understand. &quot;What do I do now?&quot;

&quot;You stay here and you watch these men, make sure they don't become a problem.
And this time do what I say and stay behind the table.&quot;

He waited until she got into position.

&quot;I knew you wouldn't stay away.&quot; He told her. &quot;And yes, I could hear your
thoughts.&quot;

She made a face at him and he smiled back.

***

It took great skill to walk in combat boots without making a sound, River had
been practicing. Her usually bare feet were tightly bound in the large boots
and she could feel the pores of her skin crying out for air. Silently, she
promised them great freedom soon.

She had to promise a lot of her body freedom. Her own assortment of clothes
consisted of free flowing dresses, loose pants and shirts. Nothing that suited
her needs. At that particular moment, only the boots and leggings belonged to
her.

There was no time to bend to the flows of confusion and anger that she knew she
had caused. They would find ways to move on. She needed to be ready. She needed
the strong armor of Zoe's clothes, the stretch and elasticity of Inara's. And a
Chinese pendant around her neck from Kaylee, because she wanted it and it meant
happiness.

He didn't hear her come up behind him and that was just the way she wanted it.
She reached around his shoulder and took the blade from his hand.

&quot;What the...?&quot; Jayne spun in his chair and his face flared in shock for a
second before he relaxed. &quot;Gorram it, girl, don't you be takin' my knives.&quot;

She set the blade carefully on the cloth with its counterparts and pushed the
whole thing aside. In its place she gently laid down one sheet of blank white
paper. Disarm.

&quot;Not now.&quot; He growled. &quot;We ain't got time. I gotta get these babies ready.&quot;

&quot;Two hours.&quot; She did not sound worried at all. &quot;More than enough.&quot;

She handed him a pencil. He looked down at it.

&quot;I told you, I don't draw pretty.&quot;

&quot;You owe me.&quot; She pointed out. &quot;Fair and square. I won.&quot;

&quot;Weren't nothing fair about it.&quot; He mumbled as he glared back at her. &quot;I'm not
gonna draw no...&quot;

&quot;I owe you, too.&quot;

River's eyes sparkled as she leaned close to his ear, her lips stopped just
short of touching the flesh of his lobe. Warm breath tickled his neck as she
whispered to him. A grin floated over Jayne's face. Disable.

&quot;That's just to start.&quot; She straightened up, walked around his chair and primly
sat down next to him, placing her own sheet of paper in front of her. &quot;More
where that came from. Lots of.&quot;

Jayne coughed and looked at his page.

&quot;Pretty? You reckon?&quot;

River hummed to herself as she began to draw.

***

*DISARM. DISABLE.*

*The words flash, white and stark, burnt into her brain by the screen as it
flicks images at them so quickly they can barely register what they're seeing.
Her eyes, watering with the effort not to struggle against the clamps holding
them open. Her hands twitch in the binds holding them down. She can hear the
others next to her, behind her, in front of her, can feel them give in.*

*A split second image of a man with a gun. A sunflower. Disarm. A foot rising
fast. A flame. A feather. Blood flying. A hand with a ring on it. Disable. A
body falling to the ground. Water. Stars in a black sky. A cry. A book with its
pages open.*

*Over and over again until River sees them behind the lids of her eyes when she
can finally close them. She sees it in her sleep. It makes her mouth dry and
her eyes ache.*

*DISARM*

*It's such rewarding work. River doesn't blink as she speaks, she looks him
straight in the eye as the gown falls to her feet. Working with gifted children
all day, stretching their minds.*

*She watches him knowingly and does not break eye contact as she steps into the
tank. His pulse is escalating and his eye twitches.*

*Stop it.*

*She's so proud of her daddy, she boasts about you to her friends. River gives
a wicked smile. But you don't tell her about this, do you? She wouldn't be so
proud if she knew about the blood, would she? About the screams?*

*DISABLE*

*I said stop it. He can't meet her eyes anymore. Just get in there.*

*I wonder how much she could take before she screamed. River lowers herself
into the water. How long it would take for her big, brave daddy to put a stop
to it.*

*He doesn't answer, but River hears it anyway, sees the truth to the thought he
desperately scrambles to cover from her. A contract signed. A deal made
concrete. At least this man will fight for his daughter, won't sell her out for
any price.*

*It makes her gasp out loud.*

*DISARM*

*River lies back and lets the water cover her, waits for the lid to close so
she can weep. A flash of pain hits her forehead, a red stabbing agony that
makes her jackknife. Water splashes as she sits up and grabs the edges of the
tank. She knows the shape of it now, knows the depth of the cry.*

*Jonah. She cries the name. Leave him alone.*

*His hand pushes her back down and the back of her head hits the edge, water
gets into her open mouth and she chokes on it as the lid closes quickly. She
can't breathe, but she has to take in the oxygen that hisses into the darkness,
has no choice, because how else can she sob when she feels the blades in
another man's skull?*

*DISABLE*

***

A loud explosion sounded and Kaylee finally took her eyes from her captives.
Heat swarmed over her and made her blink. She pushed herself up and struggled
to see through the haze.

&quot;Kaylee!&quot; Came Sebastian's voice. &quot;Get back now!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; She tried to see where he was. &quot;What about...?&quot;

&quot;Leave them!&quot; Bethany's voice now. &quot;They'll be fine.&quot;

She felt a small grip on her arm and was pulled away. Her eyes cleared and she
saw Alex attached to the hand. They scooted around the corner and back into the
hallway, breathing hard.

&quot;The others are fine.&quot; Alex said automatically. &quot;But our defense just weakened.&quot;

Kaylee looked up at the sound of heavy footsteps.

&quot;Go!&quot; Shouted Daniel as he appeared. &quot;Back to the lab, now!&quot;

She didn't have time to wait for the others to appear, Alex grabbed her hand
and began to run. Kaylee had to force herself not to pull back, not to demand
they wait for a visual head count of the others.

They burst into the room and Kaylee stopped to catch her breath. Alex scanned
the lab and immediately pointed at a door in the far wall. They hadn't gone
through that one when they'd been there before.

&quot;Get down!&quot; Minmei hissed as she came running in, followed by Binh. &quot;And it's
silence from now.&quot;

They dropped to the floor and Kaylee realized her fingers were gripping the
steel of her chair leg tightly. She was going to need to have it surgically
removed at this point.

As the sound of gunfire echoed through the floor, Kaylee followed Alex as they
crawled towards the door on their elbows and stomachs. She turned back to see
the twins lying in wait on either side of the door they'd just entered. Binh
gestured for her to keep going.

Glass shattered over the floor as a window exploded.

Kaylee breathed in and slowly swept a path clean with her hand. It didn't stop
the shards that crunched under her elbows when she pulled herself forward. She
bit her lip against the sting of it.

Alex scrambled to a sitting position when she got to the next room and gestured
for Kaylee to do the same. They sat with their backs against the wall, waiting
for the next move.

She wanted to ask what was happening, but the warning look in Alex's eyes told
her to stay quiet. Kaylee picked the small glass pieces from her skin and tried
not to look up at the drawers that were significantly larger than the ones in
the first room.

***

&quot;Wait...&quot; Mal paused as he leaned over the bridge to look out into the black.
&quot;that's it? That little moon over there? There ain't nothing on it.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Simon replied with a straight face. &quot;The top secret government facility
that specializes in torturing children is obviously going to be in the midst of
a thriving metropolis.&quot;

&quot;Are you helping?&quot; Mal turned on him. &quot;'Cause if you're not helping, you can go
see to your sister.&quot;

***

Jayne frowned at the wall. He bit his lip. Reluctantly, he reached up and edged
his fingers underneath the corner of one of the more worn posters. The paper
tore easily and he felt something inside him wince. Just one. He could spare
one. He didn't need no gorram nudie posters anyway.

Very carefully, he lifted the new sheet of paper and smoothed it against the
wall, his right hand finding the tape, stretching off a piece and sticking the
picture up.

He hated to admit it, he really did, but there weren't nobody Jayne knew could
draw a fine picture like this. It beat any of the pictures he'd had before.
Girl knew how to create something worth looking at.

She'd drawn a gun. Damn if she hadn't gotten all the specs right, too. It
wasn't Vera, but it might have been a very close relative. Hell, if Jayne ever
came across this one in real life, he'd have to be careful not to make Vera
jealous.

It made him wonder what River had done with the picture he'd scribbled at.

***

Kaylee swallowed and closed her eyes, she leaned her head back against the wall
and tried not to listen to the sounds of fighting that burst over the
increasingly small space.

A small hand made its way into hers and she closed her fingers around it,
gripped it tight.

&quot;It's gonna be okay.&quot; She whispered as quietly as she could. &quot;You'll see.&quot;

Another gunshot and Kaylee felt Alex shift that little bit closer.

&quot;That's what River used to say.&quot; There was a long pause before the tiny little
voice returned. &quot;But she stopped saying it after a while.&quot;

***

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Wash tapped the screen again, just for emphasis. &quot;No scans, no ID
requests, not even a patrol ship.&quot;

&quot;They're masking it.&quot; Zoe said. &quot;They have to be.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Mal stared at the land they were hurtling themselves at. &quot;They want us
there. They won't attack until we're too close to turn away.&quot;

The three of them turned for confirmation from River and Jonah who were both
staring out at the approaching building. River looked scared and her head shook
side to side slightly as her mouth formed words she didn't say out loud. Jonah
didn't move, but his whole body seemed to press forward.

&quot;They don't know.&quot; River said. &quot;Not even watching.&quot;

&quot;That's good.&quot; Wash looked from her to Mal. &quot;Isn't it?&quot;

&quot;I don't think so.&quot; Mal replied softly.

&quot;Something's happening on the inside.&quot; It was Jonah who spoke. &quot;Something big.&quot;

&quot;Not good.&quot; Confirmed Wash.

&quot;Fry them anyway.&quot; River ordered, then pointed to the right of the building.
&quot;Land there.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

They looked at Jonah, but he wasn't talking to River, he was still staring
forward.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Contradicted River, matter of factly.

Mal looked between them.

&quot;No, yes, what?&quot;

&quot;My question, exactly.&quot; Wash launched the landing gear.

&quot;They're not together?&quot; Zoe guessed.

&quot;They're together,&quot; Jonah told them, &quot;but they're in the basement.&quot;

&quot;Dead tunnels.&quot; River whispered. &quot;No one comes out. Not twice. Shouldn't go in.&quot;

&quot;That's never stopped me before.&quot; Mal tried to lighten the mood.

&quot;Not you.&quot; River rolled her eyes.

&quot;What does it mean?&quot; Mal moved the conversation along. &quot;That they're there?&quot;

&quot;It means,&quot; Jonah clarified, &quot;that to get to them we have to go through every
single person in that building, fifteen floors worth of armed guards and
several feet of solid steel. They've barricaded themselves in.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Was Mal's reply.

&quot;That's why nobody's looking for us. We have to go straight through them to get
what we want.&quot;

&quot;If we can't get to them,&quot; suggested Zoe, &quot;that means that no one else can
either. Doesn't it?&quot;

&quot;Brick by brick.&quot; River recited. &quot;London bridge is falling and down will come
baby, cradle and all.&quot;

&quot;That.&quot; Agreed Jonah.

***

Kaylee felt Alex jolt, she looked down to see the girl's eyes wide with
surprise. It scared her, stopped her heart for a second, until she made out the
beginnings of a smile on the small face.

Alex jumped into a crouch and gestured for Kaylee to follow her again. Minmei
and Binh were already making their way down the main corridor. They walked in a
crouch, close to the ground. Far ahead, closer to the main room, Kaylee thought
she saw a flash of color in the dark, a glimpse of Bethany's red hair.

***

&quot;Five minutes, people.&quot; Mal ran down the stairs into the cargo bay, his feet
thundering on the metal. &quot;Time to get organized.&quot;

Zoe was already unlocking the weapons cabinet. They were joined by Jayne and
Book. Simon stepped in from the door to the infirmary and Inara from her
shuttle. Wash entered from the stairs leading to the bridge.

&quot;First and foremost,&quot; Mal declared as he reached in and grabbed hold of a
weapon or two. &quot;This is a rescue mission. We get in, we get Kaylee and the
others, we get out.&quot;

He looked at each of them as he handed the guns out. They nodded in response.

&quot;No need for heroics.&quot; He cocked a small pistol and handed it with reverence to
Inara. &quot;No fancy moves. Everybody in agreement here?&quot;

Mal went to ready the next gun, a large semi automatic, it jammed in his hands.
He gave a small, patient smile.

&quot;Zoe, Wash, Inara, you're with me. We're the draw, we provide cover and we hold
the exit.&quot; He bit his lip as he used the heel of his hand to bat at the
mechanism. &quot;Jayne, Simon and River you're the... River? Doc, where is your
sister?&quot;

&quot;Here.&quot; Mal jumped as River appeared next to him. She reached out and took the
gun from him.

&quot;Hey now, I don't think...&quot; River gave him a look and he gave her one right
back. &quot;No guns, remember?&quot;

She looked him straight in the eye and, without watching what she was doing,
clicked the bolt into place, adjusted the trigger mechanisms and fired the gun
up. It whirred in her hands. Her eyebrows rose in amusement and with a carefree
dangle of her wrist, she handed it over to Jonah who was behind her.

&quot;New rules.&quot; She told him. &quot;No killing Kaylee.&quot;

River leaned forward, bending past Mal's unmoving form, to reach into the
cabinet and pick out the weapons of her choice. She stepped back and stood up
straight between Zoe and Jayne.

Mal blinked.

&quot;You know, I just can't argue with that.&quot; He handed some grenades to Zoe.
&quot;Fine. You three head straight for that elevator shaft and get those people
back.&quot;

The ship shuddered. Wash scanned the walls.

&quot;Looks like we've hit land.&quot;

***

*He remembers when River first woke up she was quiet, that she shied away from
them a little. He remembers that it took several more operations before she
cried with the strength of it, until she could barely stand to be in the same
room with them.*

*Jonah wakes up once and he knows what they've done. Knows that the onrush of
sound and light and voices are not his. There's nothing gentle about the way
they've stripped him back, nothing to ease him into it.*

*He barely makes it to the sink before he throws up, deep and trembling. It
doesn't help, because it's not physical, what his body needs to purge.*

*It doesn't help knowing that he asked for it.*

*When they come into his room, it's like a hundred different screams in his
head. He knows what River means by too loud and too sharp, it makes him cry out
in a way that they hadn't been able to find before.*

*How do you feel, Jonah?*

*Such a smug question, so sure of itself. He wants to hurt them, wants to make
them see what they've done, to him and River, to poor little Charles and what
they'll likely do to the others.*

*I can't... He begins and then stops. It's too much.*

*There's something in there, he feels it for a second. A thread of
disappointment. He knows in an instant that one of them wanted him to succeed,
wanted him to break from it and show them how it was done.*

*Jonah breathes in and tries to find it again, pushes past the countless
meaningless images he gets of faces and paperwork and meals not eaten and the
horrid possibility of other children before them that didn't even make it this
far.*

*You've done this before.*

*The accusation is heavy and instantly a current runs through the room, dark
and dangerous. He has to be careful, Jonah knows that if he says too much too
soon that they're going to do something he won't like.*

*This is what you did to her.*

*Again a flash of disappointment, a sudden excitement smothered with reality.
He wants to examine it, wants to know what it really means, but he can't
decipher it. Everything is crowded and thin and he can't grasp hold of any one
thing let alone the one that he wants to.*

*She's so still when they lead him into the large room. He knows even without
looking for her that she's sitting in the corner, watching the door. Her eyes
seek him out and run over him, top to bottom, but it's the openness of her that
makes him gasp.*

*Where everyone else is closed and hard to see, River shows it all. He's not
sure if it's because of what they've done to her or if she's always been like
this. He can feel the twist of emotions in her, the relief and the anger,
building up and winding into each other. She begged him not to do this and he's
done it anyway, but she's glad he's back and that he's not hurt. Not on the tip
of the iceberg, anyway.*

*If he tries hard enough, he can block out everyone else and focus on her.
Jonah knows that if he can do that, he can learn to control it like he promised
her and if he can do that, he can teach her to do it, too.*

***

There was an explosion in his brain, Jonah felt it hit him like he hadn't felt
it since those first few months. Hard and fast and painful, red hot and sharp.
It took his breath away. He had to stop himself moaning out loud as he closed
his eyes and leaned against the wall. Six of them reaching out to him at once,
eager and relieved, worn and ready to snap.

He tried hard to push them back, to tell them to be patient. It wasn't time yet
and it was too much for River. Jonah felt her stumble under the onslaught. It
took everything he had to break through to her from this distance. Simon and
Jayne were with her and he could feel them holding her up.

*You wait!* It was harsher than he'd meant it and he felt them recoil as if
he'd slapped them. He toned it down a little. *Let her adjust. Just hold your
positions, wait for us and clear the shaft.*

Finally he felt River give her okay. They were waiting in place. Jonah nodded
at Mal and a small stunner grenade was thrown around the corner, down the
hallway towards the large group of armed men who weren't even looking their
way. He counted twenty men as Zoe and Wash slipped across the mouth of the
corridor to the other side.

The guards reacted immediately, lining up with their backs against the wall,
ten on either side. They weren't too worried. It was a straight hallway and
their directive was clear: all they had to do was prevent anyone making it past
them to the elevator shaft and down to the kids. The men in front knelt down,
guns aimed and ready, those behind aimed over their shoulders. Those in the
very back got onto their coms and called for backup. Slowly, the first few in
line began approaching their attackers and the group moved forward.

***

*River, it's time.*

She nodded to Simon and Jayne.

Silently, River opened the door. Her gun was armed as she slipped into the
hallway and faced the guards. Jayne slid up next to her. She rolled her eyes at
him and he rolled his back. Babes in the woods. Not one of the twenty armed men
was looking their way. They both aimed carefully anyway.

Behind them, Simon carefully applied the sealant to the stair access door next
to the elevator. He set the fuse and stepped back.

*Jonah. Now.*

Another grenade was launched and it exploded at the same time as the door.
River nodded at Jayne and looked back at Simon, she grabbed his arm and spun
him to face the guards. Shouts and heavy pounding from the now obscured door
called attention back to them.

That's when the gunfire started.

***

*You heard him. Clear the shaft. Any way we can.*

&quot;Kaylee.&quot; Alex said. &quot;Stay against the wall, but stay close.&quot;

They ran into the main room. It did not take Kaylee long to locate all six
children. She wasn't sure why there had been such a sudden shift in their
tactics, but it had to be drastic and it made her heart race. It made her wish
she could read their minds, too. Just for a moment. They were firing heavily
now and not aiming to merely wound. Kaylee saw Sebastian pistol whip a man and
take him down.

Bethany turned, eyes wide, and began to shout a warning. Kaylee spun to see the
doctor staggering towards her, having freed his arms from the ties. It happened
in slow motion and, as she raised the chair leg, Kaylee saw his left arm
hanging oddly. The leg came down hard on his dislocated shoulder and he
crumpled into a moaning heap.

&quot;Ha!&quot; Kaylee crowed. &quot;I don't need no stinkin' gun!&quot;

***

&quot;Zoe!&quot; Mal yelled.

They turned and fired again. Jonah had to hand it to them, they had taken out a
few of the guards already. At an unspoken signal they pressed back against the
wall on either side of the corridor and moved aside, letting Wash and Inara
take over as they reloaded. Wash puffed up his chest.

&quot;Inara!&quot; He called in a deep voice and she let a wry grin float over her face
as they took aim and fired.

&quot;Cover us.&quot; Jonah grabbed Book's arm as Mal and Zoe came to the fore again.
&quot;We're going in.&quot;

They ran doubled over as the bullets whizzed past them. The first door was
locked, but the second was open.

&quot;Make sure no one comes in.&quot; He said as he sat on the floor and then laid
himself out. &quot;No matter what happens.&quot;

***

River heard them coming.

&quot;Eyes front.&quot; She ordered. &quot;Thirteen left.&quot;

Jayne and Simon closed ranks as she stepped back and turned to face the
elevator shaft. She was ready when the doors were prized open. The first two
fell back with her bullets. The rest were more cautious, but she still had the
advantage as she aimed upwards and sent a volley of ammo ricocheting around the
shaft.

Their screams were punctuated by a spike of desperation from Simon. River
looked down at the guns she had left, one of which was almost out of ammo, then
back up at the half open doors. She felt them swarming into position.

&quot;Here.&quot; She thrust one into his hand. &quot;Eight rounds left.&quot;

&quot;River, no.&quot;

&quot;Simon.&quot; She whined until she felt him relent and take it from her. She reached
around Jayne's waist and slipped a large blade from its sheath. Her eyes
gleamed. &quot;Thanks Jayne. Follow me when the bullets stop. Get down to them.&quot;

And then she was gone through the door.

***

&quot;Zoe!&quot;

Wash jumped forward as she was blown back and hit the wall with a thud, he
grabbed her arm and pulled her out of the line of fire. She was okay, he told
himself that before even had a chance to run his eyes over her, before he heard
her strained voice reassuring him. He had to keep telling himself that after he
saw the blood.

&quot;How many are left, Mal?&quot; He asked without looking up.

&quot;Six.&quot; Came the response. &quot;Only a matter of time, we're pickin' them off like
flies now. She okay?&quot;

&quot;I'm fine.&quot; Came Zoe's voice. &quot;Just a graze.&quot;

&quot;Let me go to...&quot;

&quot;You stay behind me, Inara!&quot; Mal ordered. &quot;She says she's fine.&quot;

***

Jayne stepped backwards. There were two men facing them, three facing Mal and
the others at the end of the hallway and another man who'd just gone down. Far
as he could tell there had been very few casualties on their end. It was a good
day. Another step backwards.

There was a click as his gun ran empty.

&quot;You heard the girl, doc, jump in after her.&quot;

They slipped through the thin space left by the doors, Simon first and Jayne
coming after, to find what looked to be an empty shaft. No sight of anyone.
Nothing but a sheer down and several ropes careening down.

And several groaning bodies lying in a heap at the bottom.

&quot;Where'd she go?&quot; Simon asked.

&quot;Through that hole down there, I guess.&quot; Jayne shrugged and wound one of the
cables around his wrist. &quot;Same place we're headed.&quot;

Simon gave a little whimper and reached for one of the abandoned climbing
cables. Next to him, Jayne gave a cry and Simon looked to see the rope around
his wrist pulled tight. They looked up to see several more men above them.

&quot;Doc?&quot; Jayne dropped his empty gun. &quot;Gimme that gun.&quot;

Simon hesitated and Jayne frowned.

&quot;You know how to climb and shoot at the same time? Do ya?&quot; Simon shook his head
and Jayne snatched the gun. &quot;Then gimme!&quot;

&quot;You don't know what you're doing!&quot; Came a voice from above. &quot;You don't even
know who you're dealing with!&quot;

&quot;Huh.&quot; Jayne answered through gritted teeth as they began making their way
down. &quot;Wouldn't be a bunch of untrained goons, half of whom are lyin' on the
floor pissin' their pants, would it?&quot;

&quot;We're talking about River Tam, you fool. You have no idea what she can and
will do.&quot;

Jayne felt Simon pause beside him.
