We are repeating the Flatness Is Relative ride once again.  It'll start
at 9:00 am, Oct 14, at Big Bone State Park.

The weather should be great, in the 50s at the start, but warming up to
the mid 60s, and sunny.

This is a really nice ride, with a few 150 foot hills, and the rest of
the route is flat to rolling.  We go 21 miles north to Petersburg, and
stop for water and food and bathrooms at the store there.  We return on
the same route, with an interesting optional detour on Ryle Rd along the
river.  There's only two turns, so riders that want to go faster or
slower can navigate this route.  I'll bring extra maps if needed.  We
have typically split into smaller groups of 5 or 6 riders going at
different paces.

Here's the page from last time, Aug 26.

flat!  Click the slideshow button if you have high speed internet.

We could do this loop at the end: 12 miles with two big climbs.  (Ralph
Mitchell likes to name the climbs; these are the Evil Twins).  They are
both about 5% grades, so not too hard to climb, but one follows right
after the other.  I'm not sure about Riddles Run Rd, I've never been on
it.   I could drive it before the ride starts at 9am to check on it.
Here's the loop.

Well, Mark tells me the Evil Twins are more than 5% grades.  I rode it
over a year ago, at the beginning of a ride, so I probably don't
remember it exactly.  Maybe I'll test it again someday.

Here's something more reasonable:  Climbing up Big Bone Church Rd, then
down Big Bone Rd, with a few short climbs on the way down.  It's a 7.7
mile loop.  The climb up Big Bone Church Rd is nice, a 2-3% grade,
rural. It's a 350 foot climb in 4 miles, averaging less steep than
Kugler Mill Rd (but a longer distance). It looks like Big Bone Rd has a
steeper downhill near the bottom, we'll have to be more careful there.

Here's the map: click the Elevation button to see the climbing.
http://www.toporoute.com/cgi-bin/getSavedRoute.cgi?routeKey=UEDPKEYEWFGLKEY

Most routes around that part of Boone County will be steep or busy
highways.  Maybe someone else has some ideas.

Jim, I think that you forgot one little detail.  If you are doing the Evil
Twins at the end of the ride, I assume that you didn't intend to first go
all the way back to Riddle Rd first, but actually up Rt 18 (aka Cardiac
Hill) to 536.  This is no b.s., this is a really serious climb and very
appropriately named.  I have never known Ralph to exaggerate the difficulty
of hills by misnaming them.  So you have three killer hills and could come
down Riddle Run which is a very nice route.
Mark

That looks good, but I wonder about the traffic on 338, since it's after
12:00.  It seems to me that I see quite a few cars on the drive home
from the ride.

I was looking at the map, and came up with this:  Riddles Run Rd to 536
to Big Bone Church.  That's a long, shallow downhill, were we'll still
need to pedal somewhat.  It happens to be 17 miles, too.   Or it could
be done in the opposite direction.
http://www.mapmyride.com/ride/united-states/ky/union/670402861

Also, we may get some riders to take this alternate route at
Petersburg:  Only one rider was willing, last time, so we skipped it.

So many roads to ride and so little time to ride them all.  What to do?

Having ridden each way, I tend to lean towards Jim's proposal (sorry Sonja)
in thinking his route might be a bit better.  In both cases I would go up
Big Bone Church Rd. which is easy riding.  On Sonja's route there might be a
little traffic on 338, and the downhill on Beaver Rd hill is long and fast
but not too exciting.  If we do Jim's route there may also be a few cars and
some motorcycles coming up behind us on their way to Rabbit Hash.  But the
ride down Riddles Run is very much fun and should be experienced on a bike.
Actually, it would be more like 15 miles since Jim mapped it from Big Bone
Lick SP and we would probably not ride all the way back there.

I look forward to doing this extra loop.  If others want to do the extra,
practically no hills, seven mile loop down Ryle/Boat Dock Rds just before
the park they can easily do so without a ride leader.  It looks like Sunday
will be a great day for this ride.

Actually, I was planning to stop at Big Bone Park first, to refill water and make a bathroom stop, etc.

Interesting--going up Big Bone Church Rd and down Riddles Run Rd is the reverse that I posted.  Sounds better your way.

Of course, since I want to stop at the Park first, we could do the Ryle Rd loop on the way back from Petersburg.  It's an extra 6 miles on Ryle, but we skip a mile of the normal route, so it's only 5 more miles. (Even less if we take the back road into the Park, instead of going all the way to 338.)

Or, since we pass Ryle Rd after the Big Bone Church loop, we can decide to head back on 338 or take the Ryle Rd detour instead.

I rode out of Petersburg today, to check out the Woolper alternate
route, and decide what layers to wear tomorrow.

Here's the Woolper route:
http://www.toporoute.com/cgi-bin/getSavedRoute.cgi?routeKey=IGIVVMTEKPOFMOR

The 8.5 mile alternate route from Petersburg to Rt 20 - Woolper Rd -
Botts Ln - Rt 18 only adds two miles to the ride, but there's three
hills to climb.  The first is 150 feet of climbing right out of
Petersburg.  I did it by spinning my low gear, 34-26.   After a
downhill,  the turn onto Woolper starts a mostly gradual climb.  The
road is smooth, and no traffic.

Then another downhill leads to Botts Lane.  This is a much steeper
climb, especially the first half mile, which is about 250 feet of
climbing.  I had to do most of it standing up, at 3-4 mph.  There are a
few points where the grade flattens out, to catch your breath before
the next section.  The steepest pitches are probably 8-10% grade, a
pretty steep grade, steeper than any of our usual Sunday routes.

After a flat section and another smaller climb,we are at the high point
of the ride .It's a fun downhill for a mile to Rt 18, then it continues
gradually downhill, past the Dinsmore Homestead park and museum.

This is a scenic route, with woods, and views from the top of the
climbs.  The steep climb is hard, but the rest of the route is nice.
We'll have to see who wants to go that way after the Petersburg stop.
This alternate route does skip a few 100 foot hills on the regular
route.

It was low 50s at the start.  I had full finger gloves, a short sleeve
jersey with a nylon windbreaker, and leg warmers.   I was a bit chilly
at first on the downhills, but quickly warmed up on the climbs.  If I'm
a bit cold when standing around before the ride starts, then I'm
usually good on the ride.

It'll be low 50s at the start, then warming to mid 60s by noon on
Sunday.

After the 42 mile ride, we'll stop back at Big Bone Park before the 17
mile addtional ride, to stop at the bathrooms, get water, and to drop
off extra layers of clothing. I'll pick up another Clif bar, too.

Interesting--going up Big Bone Church Rd and down Riddles Run Rd is the reverse that I posted. Sounds better your way.

Of course, since I want to stop at the Park first, we could do the Ryle Rd loop on the way back from Petersburg. It's an extra 6 miles on Ryle, but we skip a mile of the normal route, so it's only 5 more miles. (Even less if we take the back road into the Park, instead of going all the way to 338.)

Or, since we pass Ryle Rd after the Big Bone Church loop, we can decide to head back on 338 or take the Ryle Rd detour instead.

Having ridden each way, I tend to lean towards Jim's proposal (sorry Sonja)
in thinking his route might be a bit better. In both cases I would go up
Big Bone Church Rd. which is easy riding. On Sonja's route there might be a
little traffic on 338, and the downhill on Beaver Rd hill is long and fast
but not too exciting. If we do Jim's route there may also be a few cars and
some motorcycles coming up behind us on their way to Rabbit Hash. But the
ride down Riddles Run is very much fun and should be experienced on a bike.
Actually, it would be more like 15 miles since Jim mapped it from Big Bone
Lick SP and we would probably not ride all the way back there.

I look forward to doing this extra loop. If others want to do the extra,
practically no hills, seven mile loop down Ryle/Boat Dock Rds just before
the park they can easily do so without a ride leader. It looks like Sunday
will be a great day for this ride.

Subject: [CCC.Sun] Re: Oct 14 ride plans That looks good, but I wonder about the traffic on 338, since it's after
12:00. It seems to me that I see quite a few cars on the drive home
from the ride.

I was looking at the map, and came up with this: Riddles Run Rd to 536
to Big Bone Church. That's a long, shallow downhill, were we'll still
need to pedal somewhat. It happens to be 17 miles, too. Or it could
be done in the opposite direction. http://www.mapmyride.com/ride/united-states/ky/union/670402861 Also, we may get some riders to take this alternate route at
Petersburg: Only one rider was willing, last time, so we skipped it. http://www.mapmyride.com/ride/united-states/ky/union/70084105 Sonja wrote: http://www.toporoute.com/cgi-bin/getSavedRoute.cgi?routeKey=HPJEFOYGVXDMSUU Additional 17 miles and some nice climbs and rollers, I have ridden this
entire route and it is nice

Just a suggestion
