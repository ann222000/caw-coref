Chorus levers, converted from 9 to 8 speed. Could they be converted to
10 speed?

Numbers, such a puzzle.

Dear Andrew,

Here's a page with pictures of what's meant by pointy versus round:

http://www.bikyle.com/SmallPartsRd.asp

I'm sensitive today about parts diagrams and people so experienced
that they know at a glance what's going on.

I had to replace a piece in a 1950's Moen kitchen sink faucet that
turned out to be a cracked pre-1965 two-piece brass version of the
newer but interchangeable post-1965 one-piece improved chrome part.

After several plumbing shops shook their heads, a fellow who's been in
business forever took one look, told his counter man that Moen never
made a model 730C--that's a delicately worn model 7300, so go fetch
such-and-so parts bag, see how this would fit?

He was so pleased by the opportunity to show his experience that he
refused to charge me for it, despite my protests that I ought to pay
something.

(My protests were general and did not include the detail that Moen
sells the little part for $20 on its web site.)

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

I battled with my 1950 updated kitchen and it's Moen faucet, although
I think the faucet was a new replacement in the mid 60's, and in those
simpler times parts were fairly standard, and the diagrams pretty
simple.  You should see a modern faucet diagram.  Then the faucet
handle broke clear through like in those crankarm picts, undoubtedly
due to a hollow section in an attempt to shave grams (or increase
strength) and crush the competition.  Luckily the Chinese replacements
cost the same as the original part did, which was okay since the
kitchen wasn't the strong suite of that house.

You should see their heads shake at the sight of broken 1904 toilet
linkages, or the need to match window latches for the 1920 solarium
addition.  Luckily knob and tubes for the wiring was fairly durable,
and only gave a faint odor of burning wood with the a/c running, even
though the future of electricity was in question in 1904, and so they
provided gas lines and wall fixtures throughout the house, not sure
whether it would replace gas as the favored lighting.  FRom what I
understand it gave a beautiful light, but filled the house and
walls/ceilings with soot.  Unfortunately the guy who knew about those
toilet parts I sought probably died back in '17, so in the interest of
keeping the old much better stuff we just left the lid off and reached
down and pulled the linkages to flush.  Oh, but the joy of beautiful
original stuff.

Andrew, except for 1998 when 2 top model levers including chorus were
round, but were no convertable to 10 speed.
1999 and up round is the rule.

If they are 1999 and later, yes. If they are 1997 and older 9-8-9

Hmm.
My 1904 Wolf Bros toilet is one of the few things in my house that
hasn't broken! It's all brass linkage in there! (cross fingers)

Re read the original.

Dear Carl: In my experience, if you put that fine old Moen back
together with new parts and it worked, you have been living right (of
course we here already know that, but...)

Dear D,

Yes, it's the single-piece 92309 retainer-pivot-nut, which long ago
replaced this (upside-down) two-piece assembly:

http://i18.tinypic.com/3yc9o2b.jpg

Another crack on the near side of the threaded piece isn't really
visible, but has gone half-way down.

So far, so good. Usually, I just replace the complicated plunging
brass valve doohickey that Moen calls "replacement cartridge 1225"
while cursing the "retainer clip 1883" (prone to failure).

Sadly, my plumbing expertise is limited to waiting until Mondy to work
on anything, in hopes that the plumber is more likely to be available
quickly if a minor mistake floods the basement.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

It's the diverter that is usually the problem. The older plumbers told
me at some point "they changed them" and I certainly had problems with
replacements. The word was, Moen was formerly one of the favorites to
work on because they worked right with new parts in them. Unlike, for
instance, American Standard (curses).

That clip is always replaced with new.

BTW, there is a nifty puller for the cartridge, which if old and
crusty can be tough to remove (say in a tub/shower valve in an all-
Moen house). The only way to even try getting a bad one out. IME, once
out, a new cart. almost always works w/o problems.

Dear D,

Well, yes, a new clip is probably always used by experienced plumbers,
but clods who pick up only what they think is needed on a ten-mile
round trip have to be willing to re-use a part or two.

As for a removal tool, the Moen cartridges usually come with a white
plastic "wrench", but Fogel Labs sometimes employs a more rugged metal
instrument (available at any hardware store) in order to yank the
damned things out of their hidey-hole:

http://i16.tinypic.com/2zxsdpg.jpg

It's a bit like quick-connect bicycle chain-links. I know that in
theory I can bend and push and squeeze just right and pull quick-links
apart with my bare hands (unless they're horribly worn or terribly
dirty), but I gave up on theory a long time ago because it's a lot
quicker and easier to reason with quick links with needlenose pliers.

A boat in the basement to deal with plumbing mishaps? Alas, no boats
are found on the premises, although I've hinted that a steam yacht
would make an acceptable birthday present and could easily be moored
at the local reservoir.

But I once pumped sewage onto my own roof, a feat that still excites
wide-eyed admiration from local plumbing experts. (At least I think it
must be admiration--none of them have ever claimed to have done such a
thing.)

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

If they are the earliest production of "round" levers (1998, I believe),
then they can not be converted (easliy) to 10-spd.  The $50 "bolt"
through the middle changed sizes after that.  Consequently, I have a set
of gears for 10-spd that I'm sitting on until I happen upon another
9-spd set.  (OTOH, those "round" 1998 Chrous levers work very nicely!)

Perhaps Peter could give you a pointer as to how to tell those early
ones from more recent (and convertable) production?

One snag - Branford has gone out of business (a fire wiped out their
warehouse).  That was the source many of us used for parts.
