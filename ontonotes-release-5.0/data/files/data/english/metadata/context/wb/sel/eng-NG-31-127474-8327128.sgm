WASHINGTON - The universe has a gargantuan hole devoid of galaxies,
stars, even dark matter, astronomers said Thursday.

The University of Minnesota researchers said the void is nearly a
billion light-years across and they had no idea why it is there. &quot;Not
only has no one ever found a void this big, but we never even expected
to find one this size,&quot; said astronomy professor Lawrence Rudnick.

Writing in the Astrophysical Journal, Rudnick and colleagues Shea
Brown and Liliya Williams said they had been examining a cold spot
using the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe satellite when they
found the hole.

&quot;We already knew there was something different about this spot in the
sky,&quot; Rudnick said. The region stood out as being colder in a survey
of the cosmic microwave background -- the faint radio buzz left over
from the big bang that gave birth to the universe.

&quot;What we've found is not normal, based on either observational studies
or on computer simulations of the large-scale evolution of the
universe,&quot; Williams said in a statement.

The astronomers said the region even appeared to lack dark matter,
which cannot be seen directly but is usually detected by measuring
gravitational forces.

The void is in a region of sky in the constellation Eridanus,
southwest of Orion.

Allow me to expound, then.

Goddidit!

And those of you relying on EVILution and no void space, can see why
Science was and will always be wrong. Einstein has been disproven,
Newton (devout Christian) was right, so really it has now been proven
that the universe was created about 6000 years ago.

Darwin also has been disproven too, because it clearly says &quot;large-
scale evolution&quot; is not normal.

People owe an unreserved apology to Noah and Sons, Inc.

I did hear of the anomaly in the WMAP data, but I wasn't sure they
finished the analysis. It's really interesting, if this is true. At
the moment I can't even guess what it means, I'll do some digging and
see if I can find anything. They don't have anything on their website
or any publications out yet (that I can see). It could be interactions
with dark energy (not dark matter). It would be interesting because
this might actually be a virtual image of dark energy.

Oh wow. I didn't think about it being dark energy. That really is
pretty exciting if it were.

It could be, who knows. It would be pretty neat if it were, i grant
you that ;)
