*In a staccato burst of attacks on Tuesday, 7 US troops were wounded
in Baghdad and Kirkuk. In Baghdad insurgents waited on a bridge until a
US convoy was passing and then lobbed a homemade bomb at it. In Kirkuk,
assailants fired a rocket propelled grenade at US military vehicles. In
another incident in Baghdad, a military vehicle ran over a mine. A
British soldier was wounded by a sniper. Two Iraqi policemen in training
were wounded by a grenade tossed at them in the Shaab quarter of
Baghdad. Al-Hayat calls all this a "war of nerves" against the
occupation, which is maybe a more nuanced way of saying 'low grade
guerrilla war.'

*Some 500 protesters in Kabul stormed the Pakistani embassy on
Tuesday, and Pakistan closed its mission until security can be restored.
The Kabulis were angry about what they saw as Pakistani army incursions
into Afghan territory in hot pursuit of Taliban and al-Qaeda residents.
The Afghans who demonstrate objected to such pursuits. Hamid Karzai and
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf are attempting to paper over the
problems, but it is true that there is a lot of ill-will toward Pakistan
in the public. The Pakistanis after all had supported the Taliban before
September 11.

*In a message posted to his web page, Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir
al-Hakim, head of the Supreme Council, has backed down from his earlier
opposition to serving in an appointed political council. He was
apparently convinced to join Bremer's appointed governmental council by
Ahmad Chalabi, and finally accepted that elections could not be held any
time soon in Iraq. This is very good news for the Bremer administration,
since SCIRI is among the few religious Shiite parties with strong grass
roots. I haven't heard, but I assume that the al-Da`wa party, another
Shiite group, is also aboard. Only the Communists are holding out and
refusing to cooperate. Bremer appears to have gained this acceptance
only by substantially increasing the power of the appointed governmental
council and making it less of a debating society. He insists on
retaining a veto over its decisions, though. The "Group of Seven"
(Chalabi, Hakim, the two Kurdish leaders, al-Da`wa and a couple of
others) called on the US to depart from Iraqi cities and to set up an
Iraqi security force to take their place. (Quite a lot of US troops in
Iraq would love to do just that, and come home). One dark cloud: The
Sadr movement is not represented on the Council, and they are probably
the majority of religious Shiites.

*Now the American-appointed governor of the Shiite holy city of
Karbala has had to resign over corruption charges. He steps down in the
wake of his counterpart in Najaf. From the point of view of Shiites in
these towns, they have not been well served by American appointees. In
Najaf the US had even installed a Sunni Baath officer! That was
offensive to the Shiite townspeople, in the first place, even if he
hadn't embezzled and kidnapped people. At least these resignations show
that the Marines are trying to keep tabs on the situation and correct
mistakes.

*Shirzad Shaikhani reports for Asharaq al-Awsat that he was told by a
high Kurdish official that the Turkish military had infiltrated Kirkuk
in order to destabilize Iraqi Kurdistan by assassinating the governor of
Kirkuk. The Turkish government has vehemently denied this allegation.
But what were Turkish Special Forces doing in Kirkuk. Shaikhani says
that initially even the Americans hadn't known of their presence!

*The new Iraqi mayor of Basra, Judge Wa'il Abdul Latif, said in a
press conference that there is no resistance to the Coalition forces in
his city. He said that it was unrealistic to expect order to have been
returned to the country in only two months. He also said that looting
used to go on under the Baath regime of Saddam, but that no one dared
speak of it. I doubt the looting was on the same scale, but it occurs to
me that Judge Abdul Latif may have a point. It could be that Iraqi
society was not as regimented as it seemed from the outside. If the
gangs of looters predated the invasion, that would explain some of their
success.
