Suicide?  RRRRRRIIIIIGHT.

http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,298595,00.html

PHOENIX -  A man who agreed to plead guilty in a plot to extort more than $1
million from Tom Cruise for the actor's stolen wedding photos was found dead
in his home, authorities said.

Investigators said it appeared David Hans Schmidt, 47, who was under house
arrest and faced up to two years in federal prison, had committed suicide.

He was found dead in his townhouse around 3 p.m. Friday after police noticed
a tracker placed on him had not moved and he had not checked in, said Lt.
Anthony Lopez.

It wasn't known when Schmidt, who was free on $100,000 bond, was to enter
his plea in court. He also faced a $250,000 fine under a plea agreement
filed Aug. 24 in Los Angeles.

Schmidt, known for brokering deals involving compromising celebrity photos
and videos, was arrested in July after federal authorities said a
co-defendant obtained photos of Cruise's wedding to Katie Holmes in Italy
last year from the event's official photographer, court documents show.

Starting in May, Schmidt had repeated contact with Cruise representatives
and threatened to release the photos if he didn't receive between $1.2 and
$1.3 million, authorities said.

Schmidt also tried to auction off Paris Hilton's diaries, along with photos
of her in various stages of undress and other personal items that had been
locked away in a Los Angeles-area storage locker until a few months ago.
He also claimed to have brokered deals to sell a sex video of Dustin
Diamond, who played Screech on &quot;Saved by the Bell,&quot; and a video of skater
Tonya Harding's wedding night, according to published reports. He also
claimed to have obtained topless shots of rescued U.S. Army POW Pfc. Jessica
Lynch.

Yea, and John Travolta was seen getting into a car driven by Priscilla
Presley outside the deceased's townhouse.
They were both wearing sunglasses with fake nose and moustaches.
Priscilla also had on a babushka.

Travolta was carrying a suitcase and when he opened it in the car, a bright
green glow was seen for miles around.

I'll admit, believing that a Jewish carpenter to be the son of God is a
little far-fetched.  But believing in a &quot;religion&quot; that charges an estimated
$380 K to get to the highest levels of knowledge is just not for me, thanks.

&lt;Juliette Lewis is fawkin' hideous! Greta is a BIG surprise. I just lost
all respect for her. I thought she was intelligent.&gt;

I found out about Greta back during the Scott Peterson trial...someone
mentioned it on the Court TV message boards, and I haven't looked at her
the same ever since. It blew my mind. I can see a bunch of Hollywood
idiots going for it, but Greta does seem together and intelligent in
most everything she does. Oh well.

The other one that surprised me the most was Anne Archer. The rest...no
surprises there.

There was a guy in the Zappa newsgroup that pretty much went insane
because of the harassment he underwent at the hands of the Scientology
legal team. That's what they do, they just overwhelm you with
litigation. I've heard some of these people doing interviews. They can
not carry on an intellectual discussion; they can not carry on a
conversation point for point. They always end up talking over you so you
can't get your point across or just plain start shouting at you and
cutting you off. They ramble on but will not let their opponent get a
word in edge-wise. This is the hallmark of someone who is full of shit.
also a very popular neo-con debate strategy, I might add.
