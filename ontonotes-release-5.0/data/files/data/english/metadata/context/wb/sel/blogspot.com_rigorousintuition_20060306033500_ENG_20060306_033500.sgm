They're saying things that I can hardly believe,

They really think we're getting out of control. - Elvis Costello

Did you hear about last Friday's "catastrophic tragedy" in Iraq? The
handcuffed and headless bodies of 100 Shiites - "children, women and
men" - were taken to Kerbala from south Baghdad, writes Iraqi blogger
"Sam Hammorabi." Reputedly, Sunni militia had been killing the Shiites
"every day and hour passing." The arrival of the corpses "provoked a
storm of anger and cry among the people there." Hammorabi adds the dash
of colour that the slaughtered children "were bloodstained all over."

I first saw this here where it was commented on with some clucking
about how the Sunnis "must be suicidal," and the credulous metaphor that
US forces were the cure for the cancer of Iraqi barbarity. But did it
happen? That depends what you mean by happen .

Do these 100 headless corpses, children covered in blood, exist? Well
no; it appears that they don't. Not beyond "Sam Hammorabi's" blog. Does
this seeming fiction increase the likelihood of their existing, and many
more besides? Naturally.

Back in October 2004, Hammorabi posted graphic images of children
killed by a "Zarqawi" bombing in Baghdad. Funny thing about that: a
Reuters crew filmed their "identical twins, who died that same day after
a US airstrike in Fallujah." Why would "Sam" lift photos of children
killed by US bombs and apply the atrocity to another "foreign fighter"?

Look to "Hommorabi's" links for the answer: FoxNews, The Washington
Times , MEMRI, the US Embassy, and the blogger "Mover Mike" ( January 2,
2006 : "John Kerry promised, on national TV, to sign form SF-180 and
release his military records. He has yet to do so.") Now, why would this
clearly Bush-positive blogger be publishing material to incite civil
war?

In a March 2 interview with Australian Television, Robert Fisk asked
a similar, rhetorical question:

The real question I ask myself is: who are these people who are
trying to provoke the civil war? Now the Americans will say it's Al
Qaeda, it's the Sunni insurgents. It is the death squads. Many of the
death squads work for the Ministry of Interior. Who runs the Ministry of
Interior in Baghdad? Who pays the Ministry of the Interior? Who pays the
militia men who make up the death squads? We do, the occupation
authorities . I'd like to know what the Americans are doing to get at
the people who are trying to provoke the civil war. It seems to me not
very much. We don't hear of any suicide bombers being stopped before
they blow themselves up. We don't hear of anybody stopping a mosque
getting blown up. We're not hearing of death squads all being arrested.
Something is going very, very wrong in Baghdad. Something is going wrong
with the Administration.

In the same broadcast, professional coincidentalist Daniel Pipes was
as forthcoming as modesty permitted: "should there be a civil war, it is
not necessarily all that bad for our interests. By no means am I
endorsing it, by no means do I want one. I'm looking at it in a cool way
and saying there are advantages to it ."

Eighty percent of Americans have been conditioned to believe that
civil war in Iraq is likely. The Iraqi government has been "assured" US
forces will remain "as long as needed." (I'm fairly certain that, if I
searched for it, I could find similar assurances from Leonid Brezhnev to
the Czechoslovak government after the Prague Spring.) And yet, from an
aid worker's email :

Since the bombing of the Al-Askari Shrine in Samarra on 22 February
2006, local media and friends have deluged the Christian Peacemaker Team
(CPT) in Iraq with information. I raqi Islamic television reported that
the U.S. military and Iraqi police were seen at the shrine the night
before it was bombed . The next morning, two shrine guards were found
alive but handcuffed inside. Baghdadiya television aired the same
report. The Minister of Housing and Reconstruction said the job would
have taken ten men about twelve hours to set up enough explosives to do
this kind of damage. We have not heard this information reported outside
Iraq. The U.S. made offers to rebuild the shrine, but the Iraqi Islamic
Party asked that repair be delayed until an independent investigation
was completed. Samarra citizens have locked down the shrine to preserve
evidence.

...

While the New York Times and other media focus on ethnic hatred,
sectarian violence, and civil war, we receive other reports that most of
the western media ignore. A team friend calls us daily with stories of
Sunni/Shi'a unity, cries for peace, and the deep passion of all Iraqis
to live as one family . In neighborhoods that have been hotbeds of
violence, we hear of Sunni and Shi'a working together to repair and
rebuild damaged mosques. Shi'a Iraqis have protected Sunni mosques in
their neighborhoods. In a Basrah shrine, Sunni and Shi'a have gathered
to pray together.

Iraq's Shiites and Sunnis mean as much to this administration as
Hutus and Tutsis did to Clinton's. The only difference may be that
Rwanda was allowed to bleed, while Iraq is made to bleed. I'm still
troubled by how the US refused to endorse UN action against the
incitements to genocide broadcast by Rwanda's RTLM , claiming that it
was "the best radio for information and that its euphemisms were subject
to many interpretations." Even as the score ran into the hundreds of
thousands, the US demured. (And where should we peg America's media on
the long, hard slide from the end of the Fairness Doctrine to RTLM,
given the likes of Ann Coulter who argued John Walker should have been
exectuted "in order to physically intimidate liberals, by making them
realize that they can be killed too"?)

Disinformation unchecked is an agent of death, but it's only by much
death that some can hold dominion.

Please don't be offended, but that is the exact opposite of how I

The Hutu/Tutsi conflict far predates the Clinton administration. In
fact, in 1988, it was the Hutu who were on a murderous rampage, and
later the tables were turned. I wrote a song about it then, "Cry for the
Hutu", which doesn't make as much sense now because it seems I got the
tribes' names turned around...

tried, half a minute later by googling "rigorous intuition," and then
clicking on the link from there, eye had no problem...so who gnose?

great post. eye, for one, find worthwhile information from both the
deep politics and deep strangeness posts, but eye tend to see them as
equal parts of the big reality taking place. the only thing the site
lacks for kmee are exhortations to look at the positive, which is to
say, that which we, as individuals, are still able to change and to
choose. but eye get that elsewhere...suffice to say, reading this blog,
helps to keep in mind that importance of getting free, both mentally and
physically, from the system in which all of us in the human world are

The most logical policy for the U.S. is to create a soup of intrigue,
civil war, banditry and general chaos in the region. For those who don't
like "conspiracy theories" and "tin foil hat" items--I suggest you are
afraid to face facts and the truth. In fact, it is very unsettling if
you believe half of what you read at RI. So I can understand all those
people clinging desperately to a reality matrix that is easy to grasp.
But sorry, normal consensus reality is completely untenable from an
intellectual point of view.

i don't know if this is all we can do, but what would really, really
help is to spread the information.

as this blog's subtitle says:

What we don't know can't hurt them.

and so if you want to affect the system dictating the norms what we
all must do is show everyone this information.

i like what poster maryk croft/marykmusic said above.

"People whose Reality Box is still stretched beyond acceptance by

and understand that its that box which keeps you down and under. the

see, the lie that movies and media and politicians like to teach us
is that only one leader can really change anything (think arnold
swarzenegger). but the truth is we are all leaders, by the very fact we
exist, our society is based on the fact each individual gets to
determine his or her fate. and so we could all do what the PTB wants us
to do and wait for some non-existent savior, jesus, morpheus or not, or
we could understand the unused power every person has to act locally and
change people's minds.

5:42 PM

Seems to me that it's already happening fast. The stability of the
middle class in this country has (and is) been slowly bled to death by
outsourcing and rampant illegal and legal importation of diverse
low-paid immigrants. The skies are filled day and night with chemtrails
that are for who knows what. The daily news is enough to send a sane man
crazy...what's missing for you in this handwriting on the wall?

Imagine it's 1964 and, somehow, you were transported to today. Would
you, could you, believe what has gone on (especially since 911)? There
was a saying popular back in the '60's that seems appropo for these dark
days, "Good-bye, cruel world!"

Man, I'll tell you, these days are enough to try a soul. Hmmm...maybe
that's just the point.

The Appointment In Samarra

W. Somerset Maugham

Death speaks: There was a merchant in Bagdad who sent his servant to
market to buy provisions and in a little while the servant came back,
white and trembling, and said, Master, just now when I was in the
market-place I was jostled by a woman in the crowd and when I turned I
saw it was Death that jostled me. She looked at me and made a
threatening gesture; now, lend me your horse, and I will ride away from
this city and avoid my fate. I will go to Samarra and there Death will
not find me. The merchant lent him his horse, and the servant mounted it
and he dug his spurs in its flanks and as fast as the horse could gallop
he went. Then the merchant went down to the marketplace and he saw me
standing in the crowd and he came to me and said, Why did you make a
threatening gesture to my servant when you saw him this morning? That
was not a threatening gesture, I said, it was only a start of surprise.
I was astonished to see him in Bagdad for I had an appointment with him
tonight in Samarra.

With these examples of horror are you implying the U.S. is not a free
country, has no free press, and allows, nay, takes part in, unspeakable
large-scale genocides?

If so, I must as much as it pains me to say it, fully agree.

As to some who feel this type of article is much better than
UFO/satanic/mind control "tin foil" ones; I think the two are intimately
related if not about the same stuff, and that is the point.

The same people involved in that area seem to control gov't and power
in general, and are behind events described in this post.

It's good to get to know them a little better even if you have to
plug your nose doing it, in fact that on a large scale seems essential.

My only question is now that this veil of our innocence is being
lifted, what can be done if anything, other than just keep reconfirming
with endless new details what we have already learned?

Another point. For a very exhaustive picture of the puzzle these
things all form a part of, that were previously hidden from public view
from dummies like me (through a lifetime of brainwashing), is an
excellent presentation titled:

DEATH OF THE PHOENIX - FINAL ACT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA by
Barbara Aho, at http://watch.pair.com/death-phoenix.html

Interesting format for this series of articles which appear to
combine amazing hidden history up to the present, with what looks to me
like partial conjecture and partial fact about where this is all going
to, and it is all mind-boggling.

I appreciate how Barbara sheds much light on hurricane Katrina and
our government's role in that abomination.

I was up till 5AM last night reading this, paid dearly for it all
day, but it was well worth it.

I don't know how Barbara does all that research, providing such
excellent historical knowledge and unique priceless tidbits all
throughout, which always check out when I bother to confirm things,
which considering the significance of so many of the points raised, I do
often.

Much of Barbara's data though from a different perspective than
Jeff's from what I can see, confirms much of Jeff's information very
well and adds to it, and contradicts none of it, and she connects many
other dots that still remained for me at least.

I caution those new to these topics that it takes a long time to
disabuse one's self of so many myths we've all been force-fed all our
lives, that form our basis of our logical assumptions and mental
framework that we take for granted, and often cause us to prematurely
reject such material which is spot on true and urgent we learn, on any
number of points, as ridiculous based on our experience. And that
precisely was the purpose of that propaganda.

The gist of Jeff's post today is also echoed in this excellent piece
by Dahr Jamail :

http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/030606L.shtml

One of the recent posts by Riverbend, the Bagdhad Burning blogger,
also implies much the same message. It seems many Iraqis are alert to
the likelihood that their occupiers are primarily responsible for the
chaos and mayhem in their country. It is not unlike what the CIA created
in Viet Nam with its Phoenix Program of assassinations or by Central
American death squads perpetrated in the 1980's by Reagan-Bush.

This article reveals information that disputes the propaganda line we
Americans have been receiving that most Iraqi deaths are at the hands of
other Iraqis. The vast majority are due to aerial bombardment by
coalition forces in helicopters and planes according to the Lancet
Report, and there have been far more Iraqi deaths than reported thus
far.

I am in agreement with many other commenters that I prefer today's RI
post to others dealing with more occult, anti-rational subject matter.
However, I have to acknowledge that even sober people like Jimmy Carter
have been intrigued by the subjects of UFOs and "remote viewing." As a
president, he used the privileged position to research these matters
from intelligence archives and recently spoken about his findings. It
was also related in a recent post at the Wayne Madsen Report, if one
cares to check it out. I am still skeptical, although my journalist
sister who has CIA contacts says those contacts take remote viewing
seriously. I try to keep an open mind, nevertheless.

Re: links between deep politics/provocateurs in Iraq and the
occult/UFO/ritual-satanic abuses...

It seems fairly obvious -- to me, at least -- that people who are
trying to put together some sort of occult ritual need human lives to be
sacrificed.

Raising the number of deaths in Iraq, by any means necessary ,
provides them with plenty of deaths, and may allow kidnappings to take
place virtually unnoticed.

After all, if a large enough car bomb explodes in a crowded place,
children can be separated from their parents and taken away by
undercover kidnappers.

Does this sound far-fetched? Maybe, but don't forget this is (almost)
a common practice in some parts of the world. See, for instance, the
Lord's Army in Uganda, which uses brainwashed, kidnapped children as
soldiers and sex slaves. See also what happened recently in places like
Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Rwanda, Congo, etc.

If this is what is taking place in a 3rd world country, just imagine
what must be possible with the kind of technology the CIA has been
putting together since the 'Artichoke' and 'MkUltra' days...

... And, the worst thing is, we know these programs were real, and
that they really took place, and really attempted to brainwash people
with things like LSD and electroshocks. What if the events in Iraq
really were attempts to brainwash and control an entire nation by
driving communities psychotic?

So, yes, as far as I am concerned, there is a connection. And it's
not good news.

the oppotunity to defeat the enemy lies within the enemy itself.

the smartest move the iraqi people could do now is to band together
and do exactly the opposite thing the US really wants them to do....find
order, cohesion and solidarity. That will leave the US with only one
embarrasing option....to leave.

Once the iraqi people can get control of their own affairs they can
then call the shots and control the US by throttling the Oil valves. If
all middle east people could see this tactic as valid they would no
longer have problems....

Anonymous 9:27 said --

Imagine it's 1964 and, somehow, you were transported to today. Would
you, could you, believe what has gone on (especially since 911)?

Actually, someone from 1964 would understand today perfectly well. I
was a college freshman in 1963-64, and I recall how at breakfast on the
morning after the Kennedy assassination a bunch of us were sitting
around the dorm dining room table, speculating on how bad the crackdown
might get if they could pin it on the Soviets and whether there would
still be time to get out of the country.

The only illusion we had in those days was that we'd gotten out from
under the shadow of McCarthyism and that barring a major shock to the
system the country could eventually return to full sanity. Of course,
what we didn't realize was that, like Patrick McGoohan's Prisoner of a
few years later, we had escaped McCarthyism only to find ourselves in a
slightly larger prison.

But we were pretty savvy about the rest -- with a degree of awareness
that largely got lost after the 60's and has only gradually been
recovered.

I wonder now, with the advantage of hindsight, whether the killing of
Kennedy may have been a premature 9/11, intended precisely to plunge us
back into the depths of Cold War insanity. In that case, the slipshod
coverup -- the lone gunman, the magic bullet, and all the rest of the
Warren Commission apparatus -- may have been designed not to protect the
perpetrators but to foil their immediate designs.

Not that I see the Warren Commission folks as good guys in any sense.
It's more of a Yankee/Cowboy War thing -- the traditional East Coast
Establishment against the crazy generals and Texas billionaires (and a
few pissed-off Cubans) who were behind the plot.

That's the other important point about 1964 -- in the immediate
aftermath of the assassination, we were all pretty sure we knew who our
enemies were. They were the same extreme right-wing figures and John
Birchers and Dr. Strangelove types that were already scaring the shit
out of us. It's only in more recent years that the image of the CIA, the
Mob, and the anti-Castro Cubans cooking it up as some kind of clinical
exercise in social control has taken hold.

In its way, that image is as divorced from the actual political
issues of the period as the lone gunman theory -- and perhaps just as
much of a coverup.

It might not hurt to look back to 1964 a bit more seriously. In many
ways, we knew more then than we still know today.

I saw the Fisk interview on lateline.

His body language was something else, like he was scared to say what
he really thought, and was holding back trying to hint at what was going
on.

I have seen him on that show before and he seemed to lack some
natural confidence and self assuredness that I had seen him exhibit
before.

That line by that ann coulter psycho, about liberals realising they
could die too. What she meant was that "we" (the neocons and the right,
who are by definition "right thinking") are gonna start making you die,
IMFUO.

And it seemed like Fisk was contemplating his own death at the hands
of his people in a foreign war, as a genuine possibility, perhaps for
the first time in his life.

Or I could be reading too much into it.

two thoughts:

all this stuff is all interconnected and it reminds me of that old
Connections series with James Burke.

Connections was a ten-episode documentary television series created
by science historian James Burke in 1978. It takes an interdisciplinary
approach to the history of science and invention. Each episode
demonstrates how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and
historical world events have linked together over the centuries to bring
about particular aspects of modern technology.

and what this show clearly demonstrates is how interelated things
are, and sometimes improbably so - but clearly are. and so i find it
interesting 'conspiracy theorists' are really conspiracy exposers.
labeled as fringe lunatics when acually their the most 'in it' you can
be. to live dissassociated and mindless seems to be considered normal
now.

which leads me to this:

our future relies on knowledge of the past. and of the present too.
just keep learning. and remembering and reminding people.

show everyone the evidence.

Well, well yawl come running to the defense of your assigned
alternate reality. I am out of teh box, I'm just not in your box or
necessarily anyone's for that matter.

Frankly a lot that is presented here is very interesting but of a
conjectural nature, then some is not so much 'too far out for me to
handle', but is of dubious origin, a questionably factual nature and/or
a stretch of logic/reason or semantics to just take simply as 'fact'.

Problem is no one here seems to be a genuine skeptic, you all just
take for granted the presented coincedences (your eye wink/nod term for
conspiracy theories etc) without much thought other than agreeing with
the presenter, oh sure you claim to be skeptics, but only of anyone who
comes across as not in you reality distortion field (such as myself), or
of the mainstream,accepted(able) facts published by those who might seek
to destory your alternate reality with cover-ups, lies, deceptions and
other skullduggery.

Anyway I digress...

"One of the recent posts by Riverbend, the Bagdhad Burning blogger,
also implies much the same message. It seems many Iraqis are alert to
the likelihood that their occupiers are primarily responsible for the
chaos and mayhem in their country. It is not unlike what the CIA created
in Viet Nam with its Phoenix Program of assassinations or by Central
American death squads perpetrated in the 1980's by Reagan-Bush."

Well, I'm glad you brought that Phoenix Program bit up, because it
reminded me of the recent Bush Baby appointee as the Ambassador of Iraq,
John Negroponte.

Thus its hardly surprising, you know why? Because Negroponte twenty
years ago in Honduras was Bonesman G. H. W. Bush's "man on the spot" for
secret war there, when he was Ambassador of Honduras.

John Negroponte was connected with Honduras's Vietnam era Phoenix
Program style strategies implemented there.

Then, Baby Bush of course just appointed his daddy's John "Phoenix"
Negroponte to Ambassador of Iraq to crack heads there.

In short, the secret war style of the Bush family goes on, with the
same person twenty years before in Honduras, now setting being set up in
Iraq in the same Ambassdor position!

I would surmise--even accuse--that Negroponte is behind all this. He
was sent in to help with Bush's and Britain's civil war psyops attempt,
out of the "knowledge" he gained as a known human rights abuser and mass
torturer in Honduras for George. H. W. Bush. With 'diplomatic'
Ambassadors like Negroponte, he could additionally help smooth the drug
trade connections the CIA set up in Afghanistan--which was what he did
in Honduras as well.

??

Well, to put it mildly, don't be naive. I don't really think that was
the case that it was a "slipshod" cover up, because it worked.

It worked in the sense that the point was that no one went to jail
for really killing Kennedy, and there was no trial, so it worked out
fine with them. there was even a "quick, look over here, instead!" sort
of thing immediately put in the papers: the artificial kidnapping story
of Mafia connected singer, Frank Sinatra. THAT was the story that the
media decided to cover. THAT and the sudden change of heart with the
back to back Beatles weeks on the Ed Sullivan show... by the way all
those "naturally excited screaming girls" that met the Beatles at the
plane--were actress hires from an all girls school. And the 1960s drug
culture came straight out of the CIA and Eli Lilly drug corporation that
first synthesized it for them.

Sounds like "Rovian media war" tactics have been used for quite some
time and they came on strong immediately after the 1963 Kennedy
assassination.

I do however agree with you that it is a laughably transparent cover
up story, a bald lie, even a bad one, though from the point of view of
nothing happenening at all legally for punishing or going after any of
the killers, and without any publcity of a trial afterwards, I think you
would allow that it "worked."

It was a coup of sorts to reseat a coterie of groups in the
Presidency that had gotten out of "their" (insert your favorite group in
"their") control. They wanted to remove a noncontrollable President
Kennedy, or at least a Kennedy controlled and aligned with other groups
that the previous "they" weren't apart of. Take your pick.

From the CIA's point of view a President that wouldn't provide air
cover for their invasion of Cuba in the Bay of Pigs led to its failure.
George Bush of course almost 99% sure involved in that one. And there is
that "George Bush of the CIA" note that shows J. Edgar Hoover chatting
with in the immediate wake of the 1963 assassnation. Offically, we are
led to believe in the lie of the "consensus reality" that Bush just sort
of was inserted in the CIA in 1975-76. That's pretty much nonsense. Is
the CIA going to rename their building after a mere one year
presidential appointee? Is the CIA going to work (illegally) for the
1980 Bush Presidential campaign for free, if he wasn't "one of them"
from a long period?

An interesting book is the one that was put together by French
Intelligence sources on the JFK assassination. It was published in a
roundabout way as a strategic mechanism to support RFK's 1968
Presidential Run and was intimately associated with that run.

The book (which you can still find) is called Farewell, America: The
Plot to Kill JFK. It was (corporate bookseller) banned in the U.S. for
25 years. And by 1968, when RFK was done in as well--just after he was
going to win the Democratic Ticket in that year since he got the big
state of California (days later, bam, he's dead). The bookpublisher,
based in "Litschenstien," totally disappears back into the French
intelligence woodwork. More about all that in the foreword of the book
that was republished recently, seemingly for free, since no one wanted
to come out and claim that they were connected with writing it to defend
their copyrights...

ON your note of the "pre 9-11" fascism theme of the JFK assassination
that you talk of that was inherent in it, I would agree: know that
electronic voting machines started coming in like a plague immedidately
after this 1963 assassination/palace coup. These were the riggable
electronic voting tabulators and "media pre-called elections" techniques
of reportage (forget real deliberative counts, how passe) were
introduced in the United States in 1964 right after the 1963 Kennedy
assassination.

And don't forget the real Martin Luther King, the one who was about
to go to Vietnam to tell the Black folk that they were fighting "the
yellow man in a white man's war." Bam, he's dead. Trip unmade. War goes
on.

Burke's "Connections" indeed...

The CIA took the presidency in 1963, and has pretty much had it ever
since.

Everyone seen that "wink and a smile" picture that quickly sworn in
President Johnson (on the plane) gave a compatriot, even as he clutched
at Jackie Kennedy?

The wink says it all.

Johnson was close to Brown and Root war contrators, now of
course....part of Halliburton and the Iraq war. Brown and Root built
well over half the U.S. army's infrastructure for them in the Vietnam
war, lots of money made in that war for them. Same for Halliburton/KBR
in Iraq.

It's the same people. It's the same people. Nothing really has
changed in the U.S. politically speaking for 40 years.

Nice done, Anon. 720

In reference to the parapolitical vrs. paranormal discourse, I also
see intimate connections between the two.

"The United States, which has long been called a melting pot, should
more descriptively be called a witches' cauldron- wherein the 'Hierarchy
of the Grand Architect of the Universe' arranges for ritualistic crimes
and psychopolitical psychodramas to be performed in accordance with a
Master plan."

-James Shelby Downard

And the suspicious destruction of the Al-Askari Shrine reminds me of
the tunnel bored under the dome of the rock (the site housing the mosque
where Mohammed is said to have ascended to paradise)10 years ago in
Jerusalem:

The Palestinians were enraged due to their fear that the opening of
the Tunnel was the beginning of the end for the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the
start of the rebuilding of the Third Temple, which is the fabled goal to
which most of the esoteric secret societies of the West, and most
especially the orders of Freemasonry, are oriented...

The "implements" of the old Temple, according to the Talmud, were
hidden on the Temple Mount before the destruction of the Second
Temple...

Great job, Jeff. Thanks again.

I just have to get in on this discussion on the relevency of the
"UFO/Occult/Tin Hat" blogs.

Although I agree with some of the earlier comments on how this
current blog type is more informative and useful than the type in
question. I also firmly believe you should keep posting them. As I was
browsing through the various comments, I recalled something Alex Jones
often reminds his listeners about. I'll paraphrase:

"Even if YOU don't believe in this stuff (i.e. the occult, mind
control, etc...), THEY do."

Whether or not ritual sacrifice, alien abductions, and other such
things are REAL, In my view, doesnt matter as much as the mere fact that
such things can so easily be connected to the people in power. The
people in control.

It's kind of like riding in a bus driven by a crazy man who is guided
only by the "voices in his head". Does it matter to you, the rider, if
he is actually hearing any voices? Of course not. You would likely be
more concerned with what those perceived voices are telling him to do,
hoping thy're not telling him to drive off a cliff.

One thing is certian, we are ALL being taken for a ride.

Anyway, it's your blog, but I like it the way it is.

I'm 'anon 7:20.'

Here's that wink--showing of course Vice President Johnson (who had
everything to gain) was in on the Kennedy assassination, and obviously,
Congressman Albert Thomas:

The Most Revealing Wink

Of The 20th Century

http://www.rense.com/general41/wew.htm

wink wink

nudge nudge

say no more

Poor Jackie, surrounded by her husband's scot-free murder plotters
laughing at JFK's death right in front of her.

Poor America.

Poor world.

Then the CFR boot Johnson out, put in Nixon (like they had planned),
Bush Senior attempts to implant himself in the Vice Presidency with
Nixon, fails to work. (i.e.,when Nixon unseated, it would have been
George Bush in 1973!) As it worked out, what they had to do was first
unseat the VP Agnew instead, then insert a novel VP (Ford), and then
unseat Nixon, to get the unelected Ford.

Ford of course brings in all the cronies still running the U.S. right
now:

Ford's Chief of Staff: Richard Cheney

Ford's Sec. of Defense: Donald Rumsfeld

Ford's CIA Director: George H. W. Bush

Here's an interesing article to read about legal ways to get to the
presidency without elections that seem to have been used during the
period:

Title: WOODWARD, Pentagon plant, rep. of people 2 remove Nixon: why?
"THE 25TH AMEND. TRICK"

Author: skolnick

Date: 2004.04.21 10:02

Description: THE 25TH AMENDMENT TRICK--USED IN TWO ATTEMPTS TO GET TO
THE PRESIDENCY WITHOUT ANY ELECTION Queuing up to appoint President
Nelson Rockefeller, via a SLOW COUP of appointments and assassinations,
a technique that Bush has learned from well it seems. In 1973: plan was
to remove VP Agnew first, appoint a crony, then remove Nixon next
(suitably bribed), thus, having both appointed Pres & VP as appointees,
after the JFK assassination; then kill off the Pres. appointeee (Ford,
who had appointed Nelson as VP). However, Ford survived 3 assassination
attempts--messing the queueing all up. Did the Nelson Rockefeller scheme
die with him, in 1979, after he basically appointed the whole
administration of Trilaterals to Jimmy Carter's administration as a
consolation prize to his failed slow coup? Or did it live on in the
attempt to remove Gore in 1998? and then in Gore assassination attempts
in 2000? And the attempts to vacate Cheney without vacating Bush?
Something to keep in mind: this would be an entirely legal coup. Watch
out. Since November 22, 1963 (murder of U.S. President John F. Kennedy
by a Nazi inside cabal linked to Johnson, Lemnitzer, Nixon, Bush Sr.),
American politics has been overshadowed by a gangster turf war. It was
not taken seriously by voters for four decades. Voters might be well
advised to rethink their decision to ignore this.

http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2004/04/286401.shtml

Another interesting continuity point is that when George H. W. Bush
of the CIA was in charge, his agency started "sitting in" on how to
create the perfect WTC terrorist hit--just for "finding out the
loopholes" of course. What a great cover, eh, for state terrorism? As
someone in the guise of perfecting security, what the problems are, so
you can know what they are yourself and pass them to your terrorist
buddies as was so obviosuly done in 2001--just like Bush planned it out
as early as 1976?

Title: US DoD McNiven RICO SUIT! BUSH SENIOR, CIA head, & his 1976
state terror plan to hit WTCs!

Author: repost

Date: 2005.03.20 06:18

Description: A LIVE COURT CASE! WELCOME TO REALITY.

Our own U.S. Army devised a plan commissioned by Congress to bring
down the WTC [during George H. W. Bush's short tenure of CIA Director in
1976]...McNiven, who first went public in an affidavit included in a
9/11-related federal conspiracy (RICO) lawsuit filed against Bush and
others in 2004, claims his unit was ordered to create the "perfect
terrorist plan" using commercial airliners as weapons and the Twin
Towers as their target.....publicized version of the study, commissioned
by Congress, was to identify security lapses and [supposedly] submit
corrective measures to lawmakers. However, McNiven claims the real
purpose of the study was to brainstorm how to pull off the perfect
terrorist attack using the exact same 9/11 scenario.

The study, commissioned to C-Battery 2/81st Field Artillery, U.S.
Army, stationed in Strassburg, Germany in 1976, specifically devised the
scenario of the Twin Towers being leveled by Middle Eastern terrorists
using commercial airliners and even plastic box cutters to bypass
security.

To silence critics, McNiven has successfully passed a credible lie
detector test regarding his participation in the study as well as other
specific orders given to him by his superiors in case of a real attack
on the Twin Towers. The head of the 1976 mock terrorist plan was Lt.
Michael Teague of Long Island, who McNiven says was given specific
orders by higher-ups in the military to use the Twin Towers as the
terrorist target.

McNiven said he has been unable to contact Lt. Teague, but was
interested in his opinion now that "the 9/11 attacks happened the way we
planned them in 1976."

"During the course of the terrorist plan we were devising, I made the
statement to Lt. Teague that if the WTC was ever attacked like we
planned, I'd go public. I was then physically assaulted and told never
to reveal anything we were doing regarding the Twin Towers." However,
about a week later a strange turn of events occurred.

For no apparent reason, McNiven claims his superiors completely
changed their minds. "I was given the direct order that if the Twin
Towers were ever attacked the way we discussed in the 1976 study, I was
to do everything in my power to bring the similarities to the attention
of the American people." I have no idea why they changed their minds,
but I was then emphatically told that this order was never to be
rescinded - never - because those who would rescind it, would be the
very same people who turned against the American people."

Yes, of course everything is connected in one holistic universe. How
could it possibly be otherwise? That doesn't mean it's connected the way
any given person says it is, nor does it mean that the 'facts' one
decides to connect are even real facts.

This is the first RI post in a looong time that I've read completely,
as the other more obtuse ones, at least of late, always lose my
interest. I think the main reason is that they are so far from what I
can fully grok and, even more important, have any effect on, that I
prefer to devote my energies to combatting, or at least being
well-informed about, more obvious and incontrovertible horrors and
crimes.

I've been around occult thinking all of my 59-year life (my beloved
and respected grandfather was a pretty well known astrologer and an
Alice Bailey-, theosophy- and UFOlogy-follower; he even claims to have
been abducted by aliens) and I've concluded without a doubt that there's
every bit as much controversy, deceit, confusion and power-mongering in
that world as in the consensus reality. Maybe more.

Anybody with fairly well develped understanding knows how easy it is
to 'connect the dots' even when the connections made are, in fact,
completely bogus. And aybody who's honest admits s/he has done the same
thing countless times. So I don't find any of these defenses of
paranormal realities to be the slightest bit convincing.

I'm not saying paranormal reality is false, indeed I believe in it,
but in a way that is uniquely my own based on my own experience (just
like you). But I don't pretend that I've got a corner on the truth, or
that everybody who doesn't buy it is just too conditioned or stupid or
scared to believe as I do (not that we aren't all conditioned; of course
we are).

To Jeff's credit, he carefully avoids claiming his posts are factual
or that a Great Conspiracy is necessarily the truth.

True believers or all stripes are highly suspicious, to say the
least, and rarely worth listening to.

LOL indeed Anonymous 1:28

I was just wanting to post a add-on to my previous post along those
same lines you pointed out, although I'll try to be less 'John
Kerry-ish'

Its not that I don't think that such things are of no importance at
all, in fact, with the exception of alien abductions, I believe that
most of the things Jeff writes about that could be considerd 'far-out'
are actually happening in one form or another. (For example, I have
actually seen the famous 'Flying Triangles' with my own eyes. Although
it seems to me that these turning out to be secret gov't craft is a more
likely explanation than attributing them to aliens.)

Although the apparent explanation may or may not be correct, this
doesn't change the fact that odd and disturbing things are still
happening. Fortunately these 'odd and disturbing things' don't impact
most of us in our day to day lives (for now...). But, what IS disturbing
is how the trail almost always leads back to either the CIA, MIC, or
elite politicians, and all too often, all three.

So the point is, every piece to the puzzle is still a piece to the
puzzle. Even though some are more relevant to the overall picture than
others, sometimes its difficult to tell the importance of a piece right
away. For this reason they're all worth at least a glance, even the
weird ones.

Because, who knows...?

How much shit we're in depends on how you look at things. Much as I
generally try to stick to patiently putting the facts together (and
trusting that the very act of assembly will help determine which facts
are reliable and which aren't), I do also have a variety of meta-stories
that I pull out from time to time when I feel in need of encouragement.

The best story that I know (which comes with no guarantees that it's
true, merely that it fits the situation as well as any other) is that
what we're seeing is the death throes of the old, repressive way of
doing things -- but that it isn't going without a fight.

The roots of this story go way back. It starts 10,000 years ago, with
the crucial shift in human lifestyle from hunting-gathering to
agriculture. Agriculture was, on the whole, a good thing. It brought a
far greater degree of control over the environment, more stability and
greater opportunities for social and artistic creativity. But it also
brought increased vulnerability to disruptions of that control, such as
natural disasters.

After several thousand years of living on an environmental roller
coaster, the world's advanced agricultural societies all settled on a
common solution, in the form of highly-regimented societies based upon a
strong degree of social coercion. In short, civilization. It wasn't
pretty, but it worked, and there hasn't been a major wipeout since the
big one of c. 2200 BC.

However, over the last 500 years, things have begun changing again.
Science has been coming up with more subtle ways of maintaining a stable
environment. Technology has been substituting machines for brute human
labor. Capitalism has been offering the profit motive as a less
oppressive way than slavery of making sure the dirty jobs get done. And
democracy has provided the ideological justification for slowly
dismantling the old hierarchical and coercive mechanisms.

However, this process isn't going entirely smoothly. Technology and
capitalism between them seem as prone to crapping the environment up as
to taking responsible control of it. The old ruling classes, seeing
their power slip away, have been willing to do anything it takes to
maintain it. And many people, upset by the pace of change and uncertain
about their futures, are willing to fall blindly into line behind the
first person who offers them a sense of reassurance.

Does that cover about all the bases?

The other half of it -- and this is where it takes a leap of faith --
is believing that we as a species will come through this transition
sucessfully, as we have through all the others. And that, with luck,
what we find on the other side will be less coercive, more humane, and
more fulfilling for the average individual than the old condition of
Bronze Age despotism.

Meanwhile, though, until things get sorted out, we're likely to be in
for a fairly bumpy ride.

pull off that Mosque bombing! My money says IT WAS an inside job
designed to start a civil war so the Neo-Convicts can justify dragging
the Iraq War on forever. Is Iran next? YEp!!! That may have a serious
effect on the security of all of us Americans. Russia, China, and maybe
the EU, all could turn on us if we attack them! It's a Catch-22, we are
damned if we do attack Iran and damned if we don't. We are left with no

My responce to Jones was to accknowledge his point that delusion is a
big issue.

The design of any new set of criteria for understanding will therefor
contain elements that address this issue.

Think Satan, the great deciever.

I am with you all the way, starroute, on the opinion that we will
transition sucessfully...

Now, as a community lets create the elements that will functionally
guide this transition, but its not about luck as we must consciouslly
frame our parameters for understanding.

"..but its not about luck as we must consciouslly frame our

After reading some of Jeff's posts, I sometimes feel the only
rational way to "frame my parameters" is unplug the phones and to crawl
under my bed with a beer or two.

If you look at the list of links Hammie provides it's like a bad
dream. FOX, CNN and most notably MEMRI which every Middle Easterner
knows is a CIA front for disinformation. Look into it yourself. He's a
liar and a fraud.

I remember the story of "private detective" Anthony Pellicano in the
newspapers at about the same time. They mentioned all the details - like
the dead fish warning, etc., and mentioned he worked for Jackson at some
point, but never explicitly connected the dots.

http://www.vanityfair.com/commentary/content/articles/050411roco03c?page=3

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Pellicano

From the Vanity Fair article:

At the time, Jackson had Anthony Pellicano, known as "the private
detective to the stars," who cultivates a Tony Soprano image, working
for him. Big-name Hollywood lawyers who don't want to get their hands
dirty often hire Pellicano, who was intimately involved in trying to
negotiate with Jordie Chandler's father--whom he accused of
extortion--and in discrediting the accusers. "Bert [Fields] gives me an
absolute free hand when I'm involved," Pellicano told me in 1993. "This
is why I have the reputation I have, because I solve problems." (He was
reportedly later fired from the case.) When police wired Jackson's maid
Blanca Francia, whose son was one of the boys involved in the
investigation, according to someone on the prosecution team, they heard
Pellicano beg her not to go to the police with her information. Other
former employees reported threats and harassment from Pellicano, and
some still cower when they speak of him.

Last November, Pellicano was arrested by F.B.I. agents, who found
explosives in his safe "strong enough to bring down an airplane" after
an informant fingered him as the person who had hired a tough guy to put
a bullet through the windshield of the parked car of a Los Angeles Times
reporter working on a story about the actor Steven Seagal and the Mob. A
dead fish was left on the car, as well as a rose and a cardboard sign
saying STOP. Vanity Fair contributing editor Ned Zeman, who published a
Seagal story in last October's issue, says a man confronted him with a
gun, pointed it at his head, and pulled the trigger. The gun was empty.
Zeman has no idea who the man was. (Pellicano has said he has no
involvement with Seagal.) Former reporter Rod Lurie told me that
Pellicano had phoned him 35 times over a six-month period to try to get
him to kill a piece he was writing about the source-gathering techniques
of the National Enquirer. Lurie was mysteriously hit by a car while
riding his bike. Very few knew of the accident, but Pellicano was one of
the first to call to console him. Diane Dimond, who aggressively pursued
the Michael Jackson story for the TV show Hard Copy starting in 1993,
told me, "My home was vandalized, my car was broken into, and our
defense documents were stolen. Paramount [which owned Hard Copy] gave me
bodyguards."
