Lithuania's state television closes Russian-language news

04.07.2007, 12.22

VILNIUS, July 4 (Itar-Tass) - Lithuania's state-run television LTV
will close the Russian-language news program in September.

On Tuesday, the LTV authorities voted unanimously for this decision.

LTV Director-General Kestutis Petrauskis said the rating of the
Russian-language daily news makes up only one percent.

&quot;Lithuania that repeatedly blames some foreign mass media for
misinterpretation of its policy rejects one more opportunity - it
sounds paradoxically - to deliver first-hand information to people,&quot;
Tatyana Yasinskaya, who chairs the Russian culture centre in
Lithuania, said in her comments.

&quot;Whether a program can have any other rating, if it is shifted to off-
peak hours in the broadcast calendar - 17:20 pm, when people are
returning home from work,&quot; she said.

Not at all... That's no reason for nuking anything. People obviously
haven't really been getting the information from LTV anyhow, low
ratings, odd time slot, etc. They'll be getting their news where they
get it now: First Baltic Channel, Russian-language press (some of
which is exported from Latvia, such as the now-weekly rag, Vesti
Segondya). It's really LTV's loss, not the Russophone public.

Admittedly, though, if you don't consider the news programs, I
personally found that Russian-language TV broadcast in Riga's cable
much more entertaining than Latvian-language counterparts. There was
only one comedy show I watched on LNT, which was quiet amusing.

Maybe that's why even among Lettophones, Russian-language TV is rather
still popular. Maybe that's why cable broadcasters still offer a wide
range of the Russian-language programming to its consumers. I know
Latvian TV doesn't appear to win the competition for the audience.
Even among the political elite there's constant complaint that Latvian
State TV loses in the ratings. Now Murdock-owned LNT offers an
interesting alternative, but very few shows are locally produced,
because the market is so small in Latvia. Most of the shows produced
though are adaptations from foreign series, such as I Love Lucy, for
example. There are similar incidents on Russian TV channels which now
broadcast a series based off of the US series Nanny.

Before Karlamov's head gets really really big, I will just say that no
news program coming from Russia is worth watching. They're rarely
objective and rarely relevant to what's going on in Latvia.

So people like Aleks find russkie programming, from Latvia, more
entertaining than that of others.  Should we be surprised?  Anyway
Petriukas should be happy that Latvia can get even with Lithuania
in this way.  The Lithuanian TV has to transmit tha garbage as a
result of a signed agreement between &quot;friendly nations&quot;.

Sometimes one wonders.

It's really a simple competition. Capitalism, really. Russian TV
offers better and entertaining TV. Even Latvian national TV channels
are flooded with Russian police dramas about as much as they're
flooded with American TV dramas.

Here's an LNT lineup from today. Now that's Latvian TV channel that
broadcasts in Latvian, Henry.
18:02 - Sasisto lukturu ielas, a Russian police drama.
19:00 - Sirdsm    Monika, a Latvian remake and adaptation of a US TV
series I Love Lucy
19:40 - Zelta drudzis, a game show
20:00 - LNT zi as, news
20:20 - Sporta un laika zi as. Degpunkt . Sports news and weather
along with criminal news.
20:55 - Zeltra i, an &quot;Easterner&quot; adventure, produced, you guessed it,
in Russia.
22:00 - Sasisto lukturu ielas, a Russian police drama
23:05 - Krievijas krimin lhronika, a Russian police news
23:40 - Mentu kari, a Russian film

That's a fact of life, Henry.

Well, biedna Latvija.  I was in Lithuania from Easter until late June
and I was never desperate enough to look at Russian TV.  Quite a few
times, however, I watched programs in French, Spanish, German and
Italian.

Euro News is fabuloso.  You can switch from French to Spanish to
German to Italian and a couple of more.  I liked watching the same
news item an hour later in another language.  Great pedagogical tool.

I have no complaints about Lithuanian televison.  They do the best
they can under the circumstances and they do very well.  In North
America the number of channels available reaches three figures, but
the number of them worth watching barely gets out of the single digit
figures.

I love it that some Lithuanian TV is available on Internet.  That
reminds me, must catch up on Dvira io Šou later today.  Love those
dumb blonde twins and the cuckoo noises that represent them trying to
think.  Mauzeris and S rskis (political commentary mice) are cool
too.  Klausim lis is another good show.  One episode was asking people
in the street who Adomas Mickevi ius was.  One young fellow said it
was the actor who played the male lead in &quot;Titanic&quot;.  So they ended
the show with a paste-up of Adomo Mickevi iaus venerable head on the
shoulders of  whoever that actor was, as he perched on the bow of the
sinking Titanic, ready to jump off, and the caption was: Adomo
Mickevi iaus paskutin  kelion   (Adomas Mickevicius' Last Journey).

Sure. And I cannot speak for Lithuania, but in Latvia, it would seem
such if you didn't grow up there and if you don't speak -- or don't
want to speak -- Russian. Them sure, you'll tune it to English,
French, Spanish, German programming. But since more people speak
Russian than any of those languages, it becomes the lingua franca of
the local TV.

I love Latvian TV's political programming. From &quot;What's going on in
Latvia?&quot;, a debate show, to simple News. I don't have a problem with
current-events programming on Latvian TV. But when it comes to
entertainment, it seems a bit Russian...

I thought some of the Russian TV programming was quite good actually.
Some of the historical revisionism is pretty pathetic, ie a number of
programs with local scholars who explain that the soviet union wasnt
such a bad thing at first. Then there's the lengthy animated feature
seen in a basement bar in Daugavpils (was it called the Gestapo?) of a
young pioneer boy rescuing young pioneer girls and clearly
appreciative fuzzy bunny rabbits from the slanty eyed
foreigners...soviet era rooskie animation was really good - just cant
say much for the story.

All that high quality German and other Euro programming is certainly
available via hotel room satellite TV - but venture away from those
western comforts and out into the countryside where satellite TV is
less accessible and those bad German channels cost premium money via
local cable - and you'll see, as Aleks in fact describes - alot of
Russian TV programming. If thats a problem - then maybe LTV should
offer a competitive product.

LTV canceling its news in Russian programming because of poor ratings
is representative of the poor quality of the programming and not
because there isnt a substantial market for Russian language
programming in place.

&gt;&gt; VILNIUS, July 4 (Itar-Tass) - Lithuania's state-run television LTV

Exactly.  In our modern age, Russian-speaking people have so many
choices and sources of information that it is up to the news providers
to compete for the public attention. A Russian-language viewer has a
choice between 24 hours a day of Euronews Channel in Russian; First
Baltic Channel; the pro-Putin news from RTR, RTR News, ORT and NTV;
the hardliner news from TVC; the anti-Putin news from RenTV and RTVi;
Ukrainian channels; etc, etc., all done by skilled first-rate
professionals.

The fact that LTV could not attract any viewers to its Russian-
language news means that either this program was not interesting
(i.e., badly done) or was not considered to be a provider of truthful
or useful information. The Lithuanian government has lost an
opportunity to influence the views of its Russian-speaking citizens
and to present to them their side of the news.

Well, that's natural. The number of Russian-speakers in the World is
maybe 200 times larger than the number of Latvian-speakers. Thus,
Russian-language TV channels have a 200 times larger audience and 200
times as much money to spend on new programming. Plus they have 200
times more talent that can create good programming.

That's the advantage of large cultures over small ones. Nothing to be

&gt; Maybe that's why even among Lettophones, Russian-language TV is rather
&gt; still popular. Maybe that's why cable broadcasters still offer a wide
&gt; range of the Russian-language programming to its consumers. I know
&gt; Latvian TV doesn't appear to win the competition for the audience.
&gt; Even among the political elite there's constant complaint that Latvian
&gt; State TV loses in the ratings. Now Murdock-owned LNT offers an
&gt; interesting alternative, but very few shows are locally produced,
&gt; because the market is so small in Latvia. Most of the shows produced
&gt; though are adaptations from foreign series, such as I Love Lucy, for
&gt; example. There are similar incidents on Russian TV channels which now
&gt; broadcast a series based off of the US series Nanny.

I saw one episode. Real crap. Even worse than the original American
Nanny.

Do you watch Chto?Gde?Kogda?

&gt; Before Karlamov's head gets really really big, I will just say that no
&gt; news program coming from Russia is worth watching. They're rarely
&gt; objective and rarely relevant to what's going on in Latvia.

I personally get most of my TV news from RTVi, RenTV and a bit from
Euronews, all in Russian (along with the Daily Show here in USA in
English).  I have no complaints. I sure trust them more than Murdoch's
FoxNews or CNN.

&gt; Well, biedna Latvija.

&gt; I was in Lithuania from Easter until late June

So, you have no first-hand knowledge about it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Quite a few
&gt; times, however, I watched programs in French, Spanish, German and
&gt; Italian.

&gt; Euro News is fabuloso.  You can switch from French to Spanish to
&gt; German to Italian and a couple of more.  I liked watching the same
&gt; news item an hour later in another language.  Great pedagogical tool.

Why didn't you switch to the Russian version? You could have improved
your Russian.

&gt; I have no complaints about Lithuanian televison.  They do the best
&gt; they can under the circumstances and they do very well.  In North
&gt; America the number of channels available reaches three figures, but
&gt; the number of them worth watching barely gets out of the single digit
&gt; figures.

&gt; I love it that some Lithuanian TV is available on Internet.

Yes, internet is amazing. One can get close to 100 Russian-language
channels plus archives from places like Corbina.tv,
RussianTVonline.com, Zahav.ru, eTVnet.ca  , etc.

&gt; That
&gt; reminds me, must catch up on Dvira io Šou later today.  Love those
&gt; dumb blonde twins and the cuckoo noises that represent them trying to
&gt; think.  Mauzeris and S rskis (political commentary mice) are cool
&gt; too.  Klausim lis is another good show.  One episode was asking people
&gt; in the street who Adomas Mickevi ius was.  One young fellow said it
&gt; was the actor who played the male lead in &quot;Titanic&quot;.  So they ended
&gt; the show with a paste-up of Adomo Mickevi iaus venerable head on the
&gt; shoulders of  whoever that actor was, as he perched on the bow of the
&gt; sinking Titanic, ready to jump off, and the caption was: Adomo
&gt; Mickevi iaus paskutin  kelion   (Adomas Mickevicius' Last Journey).

Wow...
