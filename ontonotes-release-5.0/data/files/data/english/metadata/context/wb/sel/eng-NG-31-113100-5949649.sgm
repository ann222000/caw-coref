Data is plural. I know lots of people use it as though it were singular,
but I'm not ready to roll over and wave my legs in the air on that point
yet &lt;smile&gt;.

There're certainly data -- I have a ton of them here! I agree that there

I would suggest that the phrase "those data" is certainly a valid and
literate construction -- especially if you are referring to more than one
set of data.

Please Miss! It weren't me it were Peter!

Cheers,

Daniel and I are in in serious disagreement here over the proper usage of
data, so I made a new thread, no doubt due to light-headedness &lt;grin&gt;.

I have to mull over my case for singular, but still hold that if a speaker
is going to say "these data" or "those data", it's non-standard.

I'll return with reinforcements shortly,

Joanne

PS: my spell-checker likes *data's*.

"Data" is clearly a word in transition, and will some day be as
singular as "agenda" has become; but that day is not today or tomorrow
or even next week.

For any usage in transition, we have two choices: if we are enamored of
it, for whatever reasons, we can valiantly soldier on for it by
invariably using it; if, however, we carry no special brief, we can and
should use the original form.

The reason is simple enough: those used to the older form will
understand it readily, but will often be offended, sometimes deeply, by
the use of the newer form; those accustomed to the newer form will
almost invariably understand the older, and rarely if ever be much
affronted by its use.  So if we use the older form, we are universally
(or very nearly so) understood and offend few if any, whereas if we use
the newer form we probably have almost the same reach as to
understanding but take a nontrivial risk of needlessly offending a
certain fraction of our audience.  (And, incidentally, by offending
them we disturb the smooth flow of our ideas into their minds, and so
diminish the usefulness of our speech or writing.)

I have very serious doubts, despite your asertion, whether anyone
concerned with data with literally not understand the word "datum".
And did any so respond, you can casually toss off that it is the
singular of the plural form "data".  Take my word for it, they will not
in consequence lynch you from a lamp-post.

One result of having been forced to study Latin from age 11 to 16,
coupled with a fairly traditional English education, is that I feel
uneasy with usages like "a media", "the data is...", "the stadiums
are", etc. I have actually seen the pronouncements of a politician
called "dictums". I expect that by the time I am dead everybody will be
talking in text-speak anyway, so I try not to let it affect me too much.

It certainly had all the hallmarks of one.  The bit about by the time
you're dead they'll all be speaking "text-speak", especially.  If
you've been following AEU for any amount of time, you'd know that such
a, um, prediction is commonly thrown about by the more rabid
prescriptivists and 'careful' users of the language to mourn the current
state of English and to show what all of these changes will, in their
opinion, lead to.  (And the other being "we'll all be communicating in

For some values of non-standard, perhaps. I agree that "those data" is not
something that most people would say, though I would certainly say it rather
than "this data".

As I've indicated in another posting I do consider data to be plural in
nature, and therefore deserving of a plural noun. Data is not just an
uncountable like sand, for example, because each little fact that makes up a
body of data is in general interesting in and of itself -- whereas the
differences between grains of sand on a beach are generally of interest to
nobody. It seems therefore fitting English has chosen the plural word "data"
to describe such facts /en masse/, and for use to then use the word as
though it were a singular seems show a failure to understand the nature of
the things being described.

I do know, though, that for most people "data" is singular in form as sand,
and that my refusal to conform is unlikely to change a thing.

All I can post in answer, for the moment, is that if Microsoft offers data's

necessity of data's plurality, although I'm using a possessive context.

Seriously:  Grin (or, if you can't grin, wince imperceptibly) and bear
it.

Like you, I carry around in my 'tween-ears computer lots of usages
that are now out of fashion, and I hear many a fashionable usage that
makes me want to shout out a "correction."  So I not only understand
your point but sympathize with it.  I do my infinitesimal part to try
to maintain what I consider appropriate usages, and if enough people
do the same thing we may be able to slow ever so slightly the drift we
don't like.  But in the long run the language goes where it goes, and
user by user we decide how long we care to conduct our little
retrograde actions.

Text-speak is an extreme case of evolving language, primarily because
it exists in a new medium that prizes "virtues" that are undesirable
in more traditional contexts.  I prefer to think of it as a new and
evolving jargon, from which, as from any other jargon, usages leak
into the standard language.  Again, there's no stopping it.  The best
we can hope for is that it remains a jargon and that the leakage is
slow.

Some processes are not only irresistible but not particularly worth
resisting.  For example, the conversion to English plurals for
naturalized Latin and Greek words is not only inevitable but probably,
on balance, a Good Thing.  Consider this little list, with its varying
degrees of acceptability: agendas, dictums, octopuses, octopi,
criterions, criterias, data (singular), media (singular).  Each is
worthy of a little lecture, but just consider your own reactions to
each, then think about which are likely to be in common use 25 or 50
years from now.

I offer you two of the usage group cliches for what good they will do:
"(1) If there were no language change, we'd all sound like Chaucer (or
Beowulf or &lt;insert name here&gt;." (2) The Borg are right -- you will be
assimilated.

Finally, if you look at the reactions you have elicited, you may have
noticed that there is little of substance to be said in response to
someone who doesn't like a given usage.  We can discuss what we think
is or is not current usage, how some usage got to be the way it was,
how something might be better expressed, and maybe even how to stop
the drift of a particular usage.  But pet peeves don't really elicit
much beyond other pet peeves, and that's just me-too-ism.

Sheesh.  Where did all that come from?

I *STRONGLY* agree.  (See, it's in asterisks and in caps. Wow!)

I would convert to using the regular English plural for all of those
Greek and Latin derived nouns overnight if we didn't have the rather
unfortunate legacy of being judged as illiterate and uneducated
because we don't express our knowledge of Latin and Greek in our
English sentences.

Don't get the wrong idea about my view on this, though.  I taught
myself Latin and I could rattle off all the declensions in my sleep,
blindfolded with my hands tied behind my back, so it's not some inverse
snobbery at work here.
But that's Latin (or Greek) inflectional morphology, and it should have
no influence on English morphology.

&gt; All I can post in answer, for the moment, is that if Microsoft offers data's

But the possessive of "data" is the same whether it's singular or
plural.  Either way it's "data's".  Microsoft's spell-checker isn't
smart enough to know what you're doing when you write "datas"; it only
knows it's been told to mark it wrong and suggest a correction.  In
fact, at least on the version of MSWord that I use, you get a list of
five suggested corrections for "datas", in this order: dates data's
data daters dataset.  There's no reason, then, to think that "data's"
as suggested by MS is either singular or plural.  It's just a form
that MS thinks might be what you wanted to have where "datas" is
found.

This in turn leads to the conclusion that the MS spellchecker has
nothing to say about the current use of "data" as singular or plural.
For that you must look elsewhere.  When I look elsewhere, I find mixed
usages -- some singulars, some plurals.  In my opinion, which in this
case ain't all that humble, either or even both can be correct in a
given context. I don't understand why some people -- and I'm NOT
aiming "some people" particularly at you, Joanne -- can't accept this.

You should know me better than that by now.

Just for the record, media is still a plural but there's some difficulty
when it comes to the singular. We talk about the media in contexts where
we used to say the press, but we don't usually desribe a newspaper as a
medium. Media in that sense has become a collective.

For artists, watercolour is a medium and charcoal is a medium.

For me, a laughing psychic is a happy medium.

I was using the lack of an entry in the Concise Oxford to decide whether
I agreed that the singular of agenda was "obvious" as claimed. I think
that's a reasonable criterion.

Excellent question.

I quote:

[Latin, neut. pl. of gerundive of /agere/ 'do']

There is a usage note suggesting it is still sometimes used as a plural,
meaning 'items to be considered,' but /agendum/ is not given.

A few catchall comments:

What the singular or the plural form of a given word may be, and
especially whether it is "faithful" to its language of origin, is
immaterial so long as the great majority of reasonably literate users
of the tongue can readily distinguish the two forms (assuming the thing
being named can reasonably have a singular and a plural). It is only
when we would confuse one form with the other that there are problems.

Nor is the disappearance of one form or the other of great consequence
when there is little or no need for that form, which I feel includes
the case of "agendum".

(Sidebar: I still maintain that "agendum" is now past obsolescent and
into obsolete: while a simple Google does turn up 137,000 instances of
"agendum", it turns up 288,000,000 instances of "agenda", a ratio well
over 2000:1.)

The word "agenda" is now conceived as singular in that it is taken as
roughly synonomous with "list" (roughly but not exactly, an agenda
being--I say this from my own impressions, not a dictionary search--not
just a list of items, but a list of things to be done or accomplished,
especially matters for consideration at a meeting, as opposed to, say,
a laundry list).  A particular entry on such a list is a point or topic
or matter, as context suggests.  I don't say that we didn't lose
perhaps a little specificity by that evolution, but to me it is not
enough for deep concern.  Deep concern is called for when an evolution
would leave us without a convenient close synonym for the term that is
disappearing or mutating (as with "transpire" or "connive"), or when a
new or mutating term is simply a needless near-precise synonym for some
extant term (as with "transpire" and "happen").

"Media" as a singular is thus bad business in two ways: first, it
severly muddies the distinction between singular and plural forms, for
there remains a host of legitimate uses for plural a "media".  Second
(and, I daresay, graver), singular "media" is a conceptual meat
grinder, making verbal hamburger out of things that deserve to be kept
reasonably well separated in our thoughts: there are numerous
substantial and important differences of several sorts, inherent in the
nature of each medium, between the treatment of news by newspapers,
radio, television, and now the internet; to lump them up as one
monolithic thing needlessly fuzzes comprehension.

We do not typically refer to a newspaper as "a medium" because we have
the handy word "newspaper", which fully comprises the idea of a medium
for delivering news.  With the others, we need to rely on the context
to suggest that we are referring to them in their capacity as
deliverers of news (or whatever it is that Fox delivers), but that is
rarely if ever a difficulty.  (Notice that we no longer feel a need to
say "the news media"--bare "media" suffices just because the context is
invariably sufficiently defining.)  By keeping "media" plural, we have
a constant reminder that several rather different things that work
rather differently are being rolled up in one word.

The same sort of argument applies to data: it is well worth being
constantly reminded when we use the word that it signifies a collection
of individual facts, which may well be of substantially varying
significance or reliability, rather than some amorphous single thing.
It is also quite useful at times to be able to refer to a particular
datum.  Scientists, who perhaps deal with data more than anyone,
usually keep the distinction quite clear: you will rarely if ever see
"data is" in an article or paper by a scientist.

(Oh, and "octopi" was never a plural form of octopus except to the
"ain't" school of speech: the recommended form has--at least in modern
times, I have not OED'ed it [new coinage there?]--always been
"octopuses", with "octopodes" as a pedantic and now-deprecated but
technically passable form.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not in my vocabulary, in which 'agenda' is plural.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hilarious. What's the singular?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Agendum, obviously.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How is that obvious? It's not in my dictionary.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then whichever one you're using, ditch it and invest in a better
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(It's certainly in Collins.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;I only checked the Concise Oxford because if it's not in there, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;obvious&quot; singular is not obvious.

&gt;&gt; So what derivation did the Concise Oxford give?

&gt;Excellent question.

&gt;I quote:

&gt;[Latin, neut. pl. of gerundive of /agere/ 'do']

&gt;There is a usage note suggesting it is still sometimes used as a plural,
&gt;meaning 'items to be considered,' but /agendum/ is not given.
">

So the Concise Oxford is a bit too concise.  The gerundive is alluded
to but not specified.

Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary has this for the etymology:
"Latin, neuter plural of _agendum_, gerundive of _agere_"

Then YOU look in the dictionary, under "agenda."

Or is the dictionary correct only when it agrees with you?

And why do I ask questions to which I know the answer?

There's a reason it's called Concise.  The singular form is so obvious to
literate users it would have been redundant to spell it out.

Sand is quite amenable to count uses--

"The bright white sands found in tropical and subtropical coastal
settings are ground-up limestone."

"Unlike the haunting so-called booming sands that Marco Polo and others
discovered among the isolated dunes of storied deserts, the noises sand
makes are not always mellifluous."

"Rising from the heart of the Tularosa Basin is one of the world's
great natural wonders - the glistening white sands of New Mexico."

"Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year, vehicles that look like
prehistoric beasts move across an arctic wasteland, extracting the oil
sands."

--as are (as you quite correctly point out) data.

Yes; pleasantly.  You have obviously avoided unpleasant encounters with

If octopodes is the plural of octopus, then the singular of antipodes is
antipus.

Sorry, you have to look under "agere" --- it's the future passive
participle.
