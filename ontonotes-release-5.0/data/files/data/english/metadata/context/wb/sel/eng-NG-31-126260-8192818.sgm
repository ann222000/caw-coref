Non-spouse inherited IRA rollover/transfer?

A relative of mine has just inherited a share of a trad IRA and a Roth
IRA from her father.  The IRAs listed her and her sister as 50/50
beneficiaries.

I'm trying to make sure my relative (the decedent's daughter) doesn't
get hosed on this...

She's contacted her late father's financial advisor (who works with
American funds -- her dad's trad and Roth IRA accounts are with
American). The advisor is trying like heck to discourage my relative
from transferring her share of the inherited IRA to an inherited IRA
account at Fidelity (which is where all her other investments are
kept).

Anyhow, after finally and politely getting the advisor to admit
defeat, he said she could do a &quot;60-day rollover&quot; to get the money into
the inherited IRA account at Fido. She has NOT signed off on that yet.

I am under th impression that this could not be done -- if a check
made payable to her is sent, it'll (a) all be taxable income (except
from the funds from the Roth), and (b) it will not be able to be put
back into inherited IRA accounts.  In other words, only a direct
trustee-to-trustee transfer will do the trick (which could involve a
check, as long as the check is made out to &quot;Fidelity FBO [whatever]&quot;
and not to my relative).

Is my understanding correct?

And if so, could you point to pubs/regs/IRC that states this, so I can
give that reference to my relative so she can in turn quote it at the
advisor.

Thanks!

I would so call Fidelity to get their take on what is
necessary right now, then back it up with the publications
etc. search. The Fido call is quick-and-dirty, and since
Fido has an interest in this, the chances of their getting
it right (or correcting any mistake it makes in the actual
transfer) are good.

You absolutely should be able to do a trustee-to-trustee
transfer.  See:

&lt; http://personal.fidelity.com/products/retirement/inheritedira/parento... &gt;

I think this guy isn't being &quot;polite&quot; and is instead
trying another means to frighten her into leaving the
assets with him.  I could be wrong, but it wouldn't
be the first time someone were being misled for such
reasons.

She should talk to someone at Fidelity.  They'll
help her fill in the appropriate forms - she'll need
a new account in addition to whatever accounts she
has there already - to receive the assets.  It should
work similarly to a 401k-&gt;IRA rollover.

See IRS Pub p590, page 20:

&quot;... you cannot roll over any amounts into or out of
the inherited IRA.  However, you can make a
trustee-to-trustee transfer as long as the IRA
into which amounts are being moved is set up and
maintained in the name of the deceased IRA owner
for benefit of you as the beneficiary&quot;.

I'd say that that's further evidence that the &quot;advisor&quot;
is full of crap.

See IRS Pub 590, &quot;What If You Inherit an IRA&quot;, p. 20.  It states:

&quot;If you inherit a traditional IRA from anyone other than your deceased
spouse, you cannot treat the inherited IRA as your own.  This means
[...] you cannot roll over any amounts into or out of the inherited
IRA.  However, you can make a trustee-to-trustee transfer as long as
the IRA into which amounts are being moved is set up and maintained in
the name of the deceased IRA owner for the benefit of you as
beneficiary.&quot;

I suspect that the destination IRA would have to have been set up
already by the deceased.  Normally, an individual cannot open a new
IRA in someone else's name, and they cannot mess with the
beneficiaries without POA.

Also note the rules under &quot;When Must You Withdraw Assets / IRA
Beneficiaries&quot;,  starting on p. 35.

The advisor is dangerously wrong. Rich, I recommend you have a copy of
Ed Slott's recent books. As an advisor you need to know IRA rules cold
to speak with authority.

joeu's cite is correct (of course, from IRS pub). An inherited IRA has
to go as a direct transfer, no 60 day rollover applies. This false
information from the 'advisor' would break the IRA and it would be
deemed a distribution. That's enough reason to move away from him, I'd
think.

joeu also wrote &quot;I suspect that the destination IRA would have to have
been set up already by the deceased.  Normally, an individual cannot
open a new IRA in someone else's name, and they cannot mess with the
beneficiaries without POA.&quot;

The destination IRAs are not opened until they are about to be funded.
Typically, an IRA must be opened with a deposit, but the paperwork to
the receiving broker is enough. The new title of my account reads
&quot;Inherited IRA of JoeTaxpayer, beneficiary&quot;.
No POA (power of attorney) was needed. A properly worded IRA beneficiary
designation will come before any will or other paperwork, thus a proper
(notarized) death certificate is all you need. In my case it helped that
the money was staying at the same broker. They were happy to move it to
the new account.

Like the paperwork and information on &quot;inherited IRAs&quot;
accessible at
http://personal.fidelity.com/global/search/inquira/resultsindex.shtml... .
Fido is also currently offering up to a year of free trading
for IRA accounts transferred to it (including inherited
ones) valued over $25k.

Having worked with Fidelity for decades now, I find them a
fount of well-organized information, both online and via
their reps. I typed the phrase &quot;inherited IRA&quot; into the
search window at the top of www.fidelity.com , and several
easy-to-understand hits came up, explaining quickly that the
American guy is misguided.

By the way, I think &quot;trustee-to-trustee&quot; transfer, as Rich
puts it, is erroneous. What would transpire here is a
&quot;custodial transfer&quot; from &quot;American Funds&quot; to Fidelity.
American is the current custodian. The goal is for Fidelity
to take over custodian-ship of this inherited IRA. &quot;Trustee&quot;
has some other meanings, and I think using it here would
muddy the discussions with American and Fidelity.

You might consider retitling the inherited IRA with the current
advisor before the transfer.  It may not be necessary,
but might ease the process.

Once the IRA is retitled, remember to declare new beneficiaries.

">

In this context, &quot;custodian&quot; and &quot;trustee&quot; are treated the same.  That
is, both terms refer to the financial institution (e.g. bank or
brokerage) where the IRA is maintained.

I will explain that in more detail below.  But to keep it simple,
merely look at IRS Pub 590 or the excerpts therefrom provided in this
thread.  The IRS uses the term &quot;trustee-to-trustee transfer&quot; for the
kind of transfer that we are talking about in this thread.

To explain....

An IRA is an account that complies with the law and regulations
defined in IRS Code section 408 (26 USC 408) and IRS Regulations
section 1.408-1 et seq (26 CFR 1.408-1).

According to IRC 408(a), ``the term &quot;individual retirement account&quot;
means a trust created or organized in the United States for the
exclusive benefit of an individual or his beneficiaries``.  IRC 408(a)
(2) states that the &quot;trustee is a bank [...] or such other person&quot;
that meets the requirements of IRC 408.

IRC 408(h) states:  &quot;For purposes of this section, a custodial account
[that meets the requirements of an IRA] shall be treated as a trust if
the assets of such account are held by a bank [...] or another person
[that meets the requirements of IRC 408].  [....] [I]n the case of a
custodial account treated as a trust by reason of the preceding
sentence, the custodian of such account shall be treated as the
trustee thereof.&quot;

As you may know, in law, the term &quot;person&quot; can apply to an individual
or to an entity (e.g. corporation or partnership).  But IRR 1.408-2(e)
limits the use of that term as applied to the trustee of an IRA.

IRR 1.408-2(e)(1) states:  &quot;The trustee [...] may be a person other
than a bank [...].   The person must demonstrate by written
application that the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) to (e)(6) of
this section will be met&quot;.

IRR 1.408-2(e)(2)(i)(A) states:  &quot;The applicant must assure the
uninterrupted performance of its fiduciary duties nonwithstanding
[sic] the death or change
of its owners.  [....] Therefore, the applicant cannot be an
individual.&quot;

If there is any lingering doubt that the financial institution that
maintains the IRA is treated as the &quot;trustee&quot; of the IRA, I leave you
with an excerpt from Example (a) in IRR 1.408-2:   &quot;Trustee X is a
broker-dealer and is a member of the Securities Investment Protection
Corporation.  Trustee X also has been approved as a nonbank trustee
for individual retirement accounts (IRAs) [...].&quot;

I hope that &quot;unmuddies&quot; the discussions here.  I'm sure that both
American and Fidelity understand that &quot;trustee-to-trustee&quot; refers to
themselves.  I know that Schwab does.

Yes I read further and see that they are generally the same
in this context, though with the caveat that sometimes a
trust not meaning what you say it means is involved. E.g.
Fidelity notes that an inherited IRA may be left to a trust,
and Fido does not mean a custodian like itself here. Of
course such a trust, in this other context, also has a
trustee. For the laity, this may muddy the waters.

The &quot;Fidelity IRA and Inherited IRA&quot; application asks in
section 2 whether the inherited IRA is &quot;registered in the
name of a trust, estate, or minor&quot; (whence for the trust,
there will also be a trustee different from American and
Fidelity). The word &quot;trustee&quot; is used some 28 times in this
application, and only in one instance does it mean what you
wrote. The application uses the word &quot;custodian&quot; seven
times, and six of those times it means what I indicated
earlier. I know you understand the distinction, but the
unwashed may not. I agree Fidelity will probably, with a few
clarifying questions, know for what the customer is asking.
But completing the form, for one, might be abetted by
understanding the differences.

I'm sorry.  It was not my intent to confuse you further by throwing a
lot of legalese at you.  In fact, my point was just the opposite:  the
term trustee-to-trustee transfer is not &quot;erroneous&quot; to use in this
context, as you asserted it was; and it is not legalese.

It is the common term (or perhaps one of the common terms) used to
describe this type of transfer, expressly to distinguish it from a
distribution to an individual.  It is the term that my brokers
(Schwab, Fidelity, Wachovia, Metlife/General American and others) have
used for this type of transfer.

Personally, I am always thrown off by the specialized meanings of
&quot;rollover&quot;, &quot;direct rollover&quot; and &quot;trustee-to-trustee transfer&quot;.  They
are all &quot;rollovers&quot; in my mind.  But that does not make it &quot;erroneous&quot;
when someone uses those terms correctly, especially to distinguish
them for the purpose of explaining the different rules that apply.

Of course, you are free to have your own preference.  But another
person's preference, when applied correctly, is no more &quot;erroneous&quot;
than yours.

The court most likely wouldn't have decided anything. The NASD is a

It is well known that &quot;self-regulating&quot; organizations tend to be lax in
their regulation and protect their own people. Binding arbitration sounds
like a good idea, but if I am not mistaken, some liabilities cannot be
signed away despite what is in the fine print. For example, if an agent is
guilty of gross negligence or out and out fraud, an action in court cannot
be avoided by previous agreements in a contract.

Its true that criminal actions (like fraud) can and will be tried in a
court of law.  Other serious allegations, like the current Richard
Scrushy indictments, also end in civil litigation but also have
origins in criminal activity. Rarely, if ever, do any complaints that
are not also accompanied by criminal conduct make it out of
arbitration.

I was not aware that &quot;It is well known that &quot;self-regulating&quot;
organizations tend to be lax in their regulation and protect their own
people&quot;. The implication is insulting, and I would love to see a
source cited. Its not in my nature to let generalities pass as &quot;fact&quot;
without validation, sorry.

Try to imagine what the stock market would be like today if the Securities
and Exchange Commission had not come into existence in 1933 and everything
had been left to &quot;self-regulation&quot; by the industry. Or consider what would
happen if regulation of foods and drugs were left entirely to the companies

That is your political opinion and one I do not share, but that is
your right.

I an economist and a staunch libertarian. I'm laissez-faire and
minimal government to the bone. I happen to think that most industries
WOULD be better off if government agencies were not implemented to
regulate them. Free market theory suggests that inferior competitors
will either a)be driven out of business, b)rapidly grow to compete by
improving their product, or c)not go out of business, but rather
supply a lessor product for a lower price that some people would be
willing to buy (IOW, fill a currently lacking market niche).
Government agencies also slow free market response time with red tape,
and costs a fortune to maintain (our fortune).

All that aside, your logic confuses me. You called the NASD corrput
and fraternal in your original post, but now say that government
regulation is necessary. The NASD is overseen by the SEC! Furthermore,
their authority is completely dependent on their reputation of
fairness and justice. They were given that authority BY THE GOVERNMENT
and its agencies (the SEC) and they can be dethroned if the gov't
finds them not serving their purpose. If government agencies are the
answer, and the NASD is corrupt, then why in the SECs infinite wisdom
do they not fix this SRO that they themselves empower?

I can see no logic in your claim that we need government regulation,
but then once the government empowers and oversees an organization to
do just that, you call that body corrupt. What makes a government
agency superior to a government appointed agency that is continually
monitored? The government already gave the NASD their &quot;seal of
approval&quot; and the NASD isn't going to endanger that by becoming
overtly corrupt.

Almost everyone would agree that government regulation of some things is
absolutely necessary, while people of varying political views disagree about
what things and how much. It seems to me that more government regulation of
the securities industry would be highly desirable, including the manner in
which financial products are promoted and sold to the public.

Of course, the rising popularity of the internet and the increasing access
to information it makes possible goes a long way toward exposing and
preventing abuses. Scams and frauds that have been rampant in the past will
eventually become more widely recognized.

Such issues are highly relevant to financial planning. To regard them as
&quot;off topic&quot; just restricts what is considered to be &quot;on topic&quot; to views that
everybody agrees upon and which therefore are bland and have less practical
importance for newbies and people trying to learn more.

Rich,
I haven't read the replies to your post (yes was back in Yosemite) but
I'd suggest having your relative set up an IRA-BDA through the custodian
for her father's IRA, and have them transfer her share of the IRA to it.
She can just make like she's leaving everything there. This is the &quot;path
of least resistance&quot; for the change of title for the account.

Simultaneously she should open an IRA-BDA through Fidelity and request a
TOA of the original account using ACAT. She will need to include a copy
of the death certificate, with the account application. The other
custodian doesn't need to get involved if you do it this way. I did one
of these recently (Raymond James to Fido) and it went smoothly.

And in general, I think this is the best approach when moving assets
from one custodian to another. If you tell the former custodian your
intention to transfer assets out, they'll do everything they can to
discourage you. Don't even bother...use ACAT and the assets just journal
over.

If her dad's account was directly with the custodian (especially
if the custodian had no-load funds), I'd tell her to do that in
a heartbeat.

However, to me at least, it's somewhat more complicated than that:
* Her dad's IRA is run by a financial advisor affiliated with
AIG(American General Securities)/American Funds (or at least one
who uses AF as the custodian for his clients' accounts).  Some of
the funds in the IRA are not AF funds (I recall a Washington Mutual
fund on the statement), but the beneficiary claim form is from American.
* My relative's share is north of $100K, so the advisor isn't thrilled
with losing it.  My relative had to talk with him for over 20 minutes
insisting again and again she wanted to roll it to Fidelity before
he told her how to fill out the distributions option of the claims form,
* If she does want to open an IRA-DBA there, he's making it sound
like she needs to sign up to be a client.  In addition to the
claims form (which is clearly a straight-from-American form),
there's a &quot;account worksheet&quot; form from AIG with his name pre-filled
in a number of places.
* It looks like AF is a load house.  The Bond Fund of America, for
example, appears to have a 3.75% load.  I'd hate to have
my relative pay thousands of dollars in loads for an account
that'll only be open for a month or so.
* She's worried the advisor will intentionally or not mess things
up.  He already (mistakenly) told her she could take a
&quot;60-day rollover&quot;, for example.

One thing we've wondered is if there's any way to cut him out
of the loop -- like sending the claims for straight to American
and so attempting to open an IRA-BDA directly with them
and then doing the ACAT.

Rich, you still should be able to do this. The distribution to the
IRA-BDA could be done in-kind so there shouldn't be any loads assessed.
It is correct that she needs to sign on as a client even if only for a
short time period -- that's just a regulatory reality. It's going to be
a new account owned by her, and so far the only person signing a form
with the custodian is the decendent, correct?

That Washington Mutual fund is probably one of the AF family so maybe
all of them are? If so it's possible that she would need to sell all
funds and move to a money-market, if none of the funds can be custodied
through Fidelity retail (I forget how that works with AF). That step may
need to be done to make the transfer work. Generally &quot;liquidate and
transfer&quot; requests via ACAT have mixed results, and the delivering firm
may not honor them. If it's in money-market that should be a
straightforward ACAT transaction...or put another way, &quot;transfer all
holdings in kind&quot; typically works if the only fund held is a
money-market fund, because tagging along with it is &quot;and liquidate and
transfer any MM funds.&quot;

It's not a bad thing to have to work with an advisor, someone needs to
handle the paperwork and transfer to the IRA-BDA. And as I said above,
she does need to become a client just to do the distribution to the
IRA-BDA. Maybe get someone else on the AF list if this guy is being a
pain in the neck.

I've been told (and given the cite to the Regs.) that the bar on
&quot;rollovers&quot; does *not* include a check being made out to the receiving
inherited IRA (like when someone moving a 401k to an IRA asks to be
sent a check made out to &quot;Fidelity Investments FBO Jane Doe, IRA&quot; --
even though a check is cut and no ACAT transfer happens, that still
counts as a direct trustee-to-trustee movement because the check is
non-negotiable by Jane).  So why can't AF just make out an analogous
check and send it to Fido (or my relative) without opening an account
(or opening a &quot;phantom&quot; account that exists just long enough for the
check to be cut and cashed)?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, according to Fido's website, at least some American Funds
(like Bond Fund of America) can be *bought* through Fidelity's
website (I just entered and cancelled an order for ABNDX),
which seems slightly odd to be given that American Funds's website
says their funds can only be bought through an advisor), so
perhaps that can be custodied there.

I appreciate you're an advisor too, but that paperwork
is no big deal and (aside from the rules imposed by AF) no advisor
needs to deal with it.  It's not complicated.

As I said, the main issue is that my relative has a very bad impression
of the advisor.  He gave her the runaround for close to a half-hour
despite being told directly what she wanted, and then suggested something
(a &quot;60-day rollover&quot;) that would break the inherited IRA and cost
my relative tens of thousands of dollars in taxes.

That's a good question. A check to Fidelity F/B/O an existing IRA-BDA
should work. But a) it needs to be made out the right way and b) make
its way through the mail and c) Fidelity probably won't accept the check
without a specifically worded letter from the custodian...saying it's
just a custodian-to-custodian transfer, not reportable, naming the
decedent, and some other details. That's more stuff for the former
custodian to mess up and more steps where you lose track of what is
going on! If you use ACAT the steps are a bit simpler and you can
monitor each step. There's probably less risk of a 1099 being coded
incorrectly as a taxable distribution, and if it happens it's an easy
fix. Checks are messy, I avoid them as much as possible and use ACAT
instead.

[For posterity: I keep saying ACAT...ACAT stands for Automated Customer
Account Transfer. It's an electronic system that links brokerage firms,
and is the easiest way to move securities from one custodian to another.
A nice thing about it is that you don't need to inform your former
custodian/broker of the transfer -- you intitiate a transfer at the
receiving firm, not the delivering firm.]

Thanks for explaining this.  I hate to appear ignorant (I am ignorant,
I just hate to APPEAR that way), but here's two questions:

1.  This apparently applies to rollovers/transfers in kind of stocks
and bonds.  Does it also apply to cash?  For example, could I close
out a brokerage IRA at Merrill Lynch and transfer the cash via ACAT to
Fidelity mutual funds and buy Fidelity mutual funds?

2. Is this process also available for regular (non-IRA) accounts?

If so, how does an investor or beneficiary initiate ACAT - is it as
simple as contacting the new custodian?

I've done plenty of ACATs over the years as I moved from

Once the account is open at the new broker/custodian, follow their
procedures to initiate a transfer.  For example, at Fido you
can fill out their &quot;Transfer of Assets&quot; form or (depending
on who the source is) you can submit the info through Fido's
website instead of submitting a paper form.  Once that's done,
the new broker takes over and you just sit back and wait for
the transfer to complete.

Skip, you might never see the term ACAT used, it's the system that works
behind the scenes when you request a transfer of assets between
brokerage accounts. Yes, cash comes over too. For that Merrill to
Fidelity example, you would open a Fidelity brokerage account and fill
out a transfer of assets request (whatever they call that form) and
attach a recent statement for your Merrill account.

This works with all sorts of accounts, not just IRAs, but the titling of
the accounts at either end generally needs to match.

Must the new custodian be a brokerage account?  For example, could the
Merrill account be liquidated, and the cash sent straight to one of
Fido's Money Market Funds?  (And once there, allocated to several
other funds, all without use of a Fido brokerage account.)

I ask this because the usual approach is to open a new account at
Fido, Vanguard, T Rowe Price, etc., then for the investor/IRA owner to
have to go to the old custodian and request a check.  Many investors
have trouble with this because of the natural reluctance of the
current custodian to easily give it up.

what to do with it then because it was already set up that way.
Or so it would appear to me - exactly analogous to how one does
a 401k rollover to them, though with a different account app form.

I don't think that's possible for this - it is a new account and

Well, my relative called Fidelity, and they strongly advised her
to open the account with American Funds and then submit a
a transfer of assets form.

For what it's worth, the Fidelity IRA-BDA application itself
only lists two funding options -- a transfer from another
Fidelity IRA-BDA and a transfer from an indentically-registered
IRA-BDA at another institution.

&gt; what to do with it then because it was already set up that way.

Perhaps it's different with the retail side of Fidelity, but
institutional recently added a requirement that a letter be sent from
the prior custodian with a bunch of details, when the IRA assets come
over by check. I had one earlier this year where the letter-exchange
didn't happen soon enough (delay by the soon-to-be-former custodian) and
the original check-request was canceled by the former. But there was no
way to know this was going on really, from both sides things appeared to
be on track. It wasted two months and required multiple sets of paperwork.

And in general I'd say I see maybe a 1/3 - 1/4 failure rate (meaning,
delay or some mistake to correct) on any non-routine IRA transfer, and
funding a BDA with a check from the decedent's IRA would certainly
qualify. Similarly 401k rollovers at prior-employer plans go better if
you use custodian's option, if offered, to do a 401k-to-IRA rollover
within the firm, and then transfer the IRA to your preferred custodian.
No surprise that keeping assets within the custodian is a more
straightforward process than moving them out -- for several reasons!

&gt; I don't think that's possible for this - it is a new account and
&gt; the ACAT requires the accounts to be registered to exactly the
&gt; same owner and name, doesn't it?  This new account is different
&gt; and differently owned from the account from which the assets are
&gt; being transferred.

I'm recommending that Rich do an IRA-to-BDA transfer within AIG/AF, and
then BDA-to-BDA, so yes he can use ACAT for this second step. You're
correct that you couldn't use ACAT for moving money from the decedent's
IRA to a BDA at Fidelity.

Oh, one caveat on all this...ACAT often triggers a fee from former
custodian ($50 is typical) but it depends on the account type and
custodian. Worth it, IMO, to avoid a potential several-month delay.
