I bought an old packing trunk, with some sort of metal binding and leather.
The metal is completely rust-covered. Does anyone know the safest way to
clean it up? What do you recommend for the leather covering?

Many thanks

Dino, I purchased an old trunk which had been cleaned using buttermilk
on a rag. She had poured it in a pan, and changed rags until they were
no longer &quot;dirty&quot;. I later tried this on a smaller leather case and it
worked well for me. There is no smell once the leather dries, and it
will actually polish a bit with a dry towel.

Not sure about the rusty metal. Good Luck

"/> I've cleaned rusty metal with a wire brush to get most of the loose rust
off. Then I wipe with a tack cloth. Then paint the surface with
Rustoleum's Rust Reformer. You can pick this up at a hardware store. About
$7 a squeeze bottle. It's kind of expensive, so use it up before it
thickens. (It's good on your car too!) It seals metal and is like a
primer. Then paint matte black, gloss, whatever you choose.
I don't know if this is *museum* quality restoration for metal, but I like
the results.
