I have a Mitutoyo dial caliper, and occasionally the needle gets
misaligned. I prefer that it point upwards (12 o'clock) when closed;
right now it is at 7 o'clock. What is  the procedure to adjust the
pointer? I know the use of a shim has been mentioned before, but how is
it accomplished?

TIA,
Joe

You got dirty teeth.  You need to brush.  (no... really)

A chip has caused the pinion to skip teeth.

You can't _easily_ get the pointer back, except perhaps by running the
pinion over that chip a few times in the hope that it restores.

But you can get the chip(s) out so they don't cause it to happen again --
then take care to keep your calipers meticulously clean --  I don't mean
_clean_ them frequently, I mean make sure they don't ever get dirty.  Don't
lay them where errant chips and filings can reach.  Don't put them down on
chip-covered surfaces.

To clean out the rack, the simplest way is to use a very fine embroidery
needle, and _gently_ rake out each tooth.  Use a magnifying glass, and make
sure every one is clean of chips.

Then, don't ever get them dirty again.

There are fully-shielded calipers available.  Most of the lower-end ones
have a sliding shield, but it doesn't cover all of the rack all of the time.

Decent quality optical (digital) calipers aren't prone to this sort of
failure, but you can damage the scale if you get chips between scale and
slider.

Well, there is a way:  Use an unrolled piece of flat watch spring and
slide it between the rack and the pinion inside the head, and cause the
pinion to skip a tooth in the opposite direction.  The pinion is
spring-loaded against the rack, to prevent backlash, and will tolerate
this without difficulty.

I've also taken a bought-used Mitutoyo dial height gage apart and
cleaned it.  Reassembly was not difficult.  Resembles working on a
mechanical clock.  The main advice is to work on a clean table over a
large pan lined with fabric (so dropped items don't bounce), so you
don't lose any parts.  It's also good to vacuum the floor before
starting, so you have a prayer of finding dropped parts.

Not _completely_ crazy, just a little.  Most folks don't have that tool.
They buy a bottom-of-the-line dial caliper, and wouldn't even think to look
for the adjustment tool.

The watch spring idea is probably more in line with what the average guy
will have just lying around.  But selectively "skipping" over the vagrant
chip works most of the time, and requires no tools at all.

You don't have to get the needle precisely at 12:00 o'clock, just close --
it's only a matter of convenience for reading.  The bezel will set to zero
anywhere.

THE tool for most is a little key-shaped item made out of shim stock,
the small end is a little less than rack width. Most of the dial
calipers I've seen have the pinion spring-loaded, you take above item
and press it into the rack/pinion interface area to disengage the
pinion, then mess with the thing until the pointer is about where you
want it.  Higher quality dial calipers include the tool, it's maybe 5
or 10 thou thick, usually under the foam in the case.  Brush your
rack's teeth too, you've got a chip in there somewhere.

And once it's fixed a trick and old time machinist taught me to lessen the
chance of chips falling in or help chips fall out is to always lay it face
DOWN against it's crystal(plastic?) face.

Oh and for those of you who are the dissasembly kind of people, my father
was a photographer and repaired cameras.  He sealed and painted white the
big file drawer in his desk. When it was time to dissassemble a camera or
shutter he'd stick it and his hands in the drawer and close it as far a he
could, THEN he'd take it apart... if any parts fell out or springs flew away
they'd stay in the drawer :-)

Remove the bezel clamp screw and plastic clamp, and there is a small
slot moulded in the back of the face housing. Find a length of stiff
wire that will push in to this slot and lift the gear clear of the
rack, then set the dial to zero and close the caliper, remove the wire
and job done. This is how its done on the Mitutoyo calipers i have
used unless yours is different.

Ya know Larry, I though that too.

But I figured my old time machinist friend who worked for Rockwell and made
parts that put men on the moon knew what he was talking about.. the face on
his 30 year old Starett look just fine, I'm going on 15 years now with same
caliper and it's as clear as the day I bought it.

I'll take a few scratchs on crystal over a trashed rack and pinion every
time :-)

Mitutoyo generally supplies, with the caliper,  the tiny tool that permits
reorientation of the pointer.    It's that tiny brass finger you thought

Thanks to everybody for the suggestions, especially to Paul. It turns
out that the slot on my calipers is on the top of the dial - no screw
removal needed. Now my "anal-retentive" self is satisfied with the results.

This set is "never" used in a machine shop; it's used for metrology,
usually in a pretty clean environment. Sometimes, however, another one
of the techs will borrow it (for unspecified purposes) and it comes back
with, um, 'altered' characteristics. Previously I would just wait until
it was time to send it out for recertification, and let the outside lab
fix the dial. Now I'm even more valuable to the Company!

I've learned a thing or two since joining this ng 7 or 8 years ago.

I like it! &lt;vbg&gt;

That's why it's important to buy at least some HF tools. Keep a spare
of whatever someone might wish to borrow. Get a security deposit for
the value, and then loan it out. When (not if) it comes back screwed,
have them keep it and you can get a fresh one.  The clincher is that
anyone who couldn't afford to rent one surely couldn't afford to put
up a security deposit, and anyone who would offer their friendship up
before a security deposit isn't your friend anyway. ;)

That's exactly how I deal with the loan of my books nowadays. I've never
had a loaned book returned in the past, now no one even bothers to ask.
The deposit I would ask on my rarer, out-of-print books might require a
second mortgage on the part of the borrower. It's all a matter of
perceived value - I perceive it as more valuable than they do.

We do something similar in our office when a kid's parent asks to borrow
a book from our library. We politely ask them to leave us a check for
our guesstimated value of the book and tell them we won't cash it unless
they "forget" to return the book within two months. I can't recall
anyone not returning a book timely in the several years since we started
doing that.

I figure that maybe if they balance their checkbooks once in a while
they'll notice the uncleared check and do something about getting our
book back to us.

**************

Re measuring tools; About 40 years ago there was an excellent toolmaker
named Sven Somethingorother in the model shop at the place I was working
for.

I had a crappy beat up 1" mike and one day a few of us young injuneers
hatched a plot to pull Sven's chain with it.

I went over to his bench and asked him if I could borrow his 1" mike for
a couple of minutes. He reluctantly agreed and handed it to me. I could
feel his eyes on my back as I walked over to where the other guys were,
but before I'd got there I'd switched my mike for his.

I proceeded to clamp a piece of plate to another piece sticking up out
of a vise, using the crappy mike like a C-clamp, while pretending to
twist the mike's barrel (with both hands) as hard as I could.

Sven beat the world record time for running from his bench to ours, but
I was holding his mike up in front of me by the time he made it over. I
can't remember if he appreciated the gag or not, but the rest of us sure
did.

There was a short article in the latest issue of Home Shop Machinist (or
maybe it was Machinist's Workshop) magazine which arrived in the mail a
couple of days ago.

It showed how to use a digital caliper as an adding or subtracting
calculator by appropriate use of the zero button and the movable jaw.

So simple anyone on rcm can figure out how to do it without more
details, and it might just be handy if you don't have a pencil and paper
handy.

Years ago someone (Mike Graham?) posted a tip about using a digital
calipers that way.  Maybe ... his tip was using the zero to get a direct
reading of oversize-ness for turning on a lathe:
- open the calipers to the desired size
- zero it there
- measure the work size
- the calipers now read the oversize amount (at the final size the
calipers will read zero)

I do this all the time and it is *really* handy!

Also works really nicely for turning to a metric size:
- in metric mode zero at desired size as above
- switch to inches mode and continue as above - the readings now tell
you in inches how much you are over your metric size

Heh!

You want the full story?     I allowed a *friend* to borrow our car, which
was returned with a wrecked fender.   Same dude that was doing her,
unbeknownst to me at the time.   As you suggested--------:-)

My measuring tools are still virgins.

While it may be handy, what it is to precision is questionable.   If you're
doing close tolerance work (anything under .005"), I hope you pick up a
micrometer at the appropriate time.   Calipers, even good calipers, are
useless for precision measurements, so your work will be better than your
ability to measure only by chance.

I use that method all the time but when I zero the readout, I use a
calibrated reference.  Now for that particular measurment the caliper is
accurate to at least .001 in. and you are less likely to make a mistake
with addition or subtraction.
