Transcommunity.

It's late and I need to go to bed soon.  But I feel like I should
blog out what I'm thinking because I feel so damn overwhelmed, more
than a little lost, and...because I want to honour some people who
really deserve more credit than they usually receive.

I never grew up with any knowledge of trans issues beyond what
mainstream culture revealed to me, and we all know what that means.
Jerry Springer screamfests, Ricki Lake parades, drag queens.
Overexaggerated, unexplained, misinterpreted.  I thought transfolk
were scary and strange at best, and weird amalgamations of people at
worst.  It shames me to admit that, now, but growing up in a
Catholic home with parents for whom transgender issues did not exist
and were not discussed, it was all I had the ability to understand.

Then I went to college, became wildly activist, and everything
changed.  I met transpeople by the dozen.  I started learning a
little bit about their world and their lives, learning the important
differences between, say, transsexual and transgendered (and a
million other terms), learning that gender identity is so much more
complex and fascinating than we give it credit for.  It was the
transcommunity in college who embraced my androgyny, and a
transwoman who taught me every makeup trick I have.  They became my
family then and they embraced me and surrounded me with an
absolutely unlimited and accepting love that I will never, ever,
ever forget.  When I was experimenting with my own gender at the
time, when I got called a tranny bitch by a boy I met in a bar, it
was the transcommunity that literally and metaphorically embraced me
and told me it was going to be alright.

Now, my - well.  She doesn't want me to call her my father any more,
and we feel odd calling her my mother...but my parent who has
recently come out as MtF transsexual is dealing with all the issues
that sometimes hit people who participate in the trans community:
being abandoned, being scorned, being mocked, being told that there
is something innately wrong with them.

I've just been sitting here thinking of the violence and the hate
perpetrated against the most beautiful people who don't deserve it.
It frightens me.  It frightens me how goddamned ugly people can be,
how hateful, how absolutely destructive towards anything that they
can't understand.  It scares me that just for being who they are
some people have to endure physical violence and even the threat of
death.  It breaks my heart.  I want to cry.

I want to cry because they don't deserve it.  Because all they want,
goddamnit, is to be who they are, just like I do, to be who we are,
to be a part of the world and to function in it like the beautiful
souls they are.

I have been involved in a lot of communities throughout my life.
Activist communities, friend communities, ED communities, and none
of them have ever been supporting as the transfamilies I have found,
as the beautiful people who seem hellbent on accepting others
because they know firsthand the pain of being rejected themselves.

...every day the transwoman I befriended at the department store,
the one with a child named Seamus (I blogged about her a while back)
sends me an e-card.  And it always has a little sunshine on it or
some little flowers, and it always comes with a similar message: &quot;I
hope you love who you are today.&quot;  &quot;You are beautiful.&quot;  &quot;Remember
to be happy with yourself.&quot;

Beautiful.    F*cking beautiful and f*cking precious.

It destroys me sometimes that the world will not recognise that.

&quot;[T]he job of the gay community is not to deal with extremists who
would castigate us or put us on an island and drop an H-bomb on us.
The fact of the matter is that there is a small percentage of people
in America who understand the true nature of the homosexual
community. There is another small percentage who will never
understand us. Our job is not to get those people who dislike us to
love us. Nor was our aim in the civil rights movement to get
prejudiced white people to love us. Our aim was to try to create the
kind of America, legislatively, morally, and psychologically, such
that even though some whites continued to hate us, they could not
openly manifest that hate. That's our job today: to control the
extent to which people can publicly manifest antigay sentiment.&quot;
