I've just plugged in a new desk lamp which sits on my computer desk - it has
its own wall socket.  When I switch it on or off, there's a loud 'pop' from
the PC's speakers.  How can I stop it?  Need I bother?  Thanks in advance
for any advice.

Steve.

Bet it's a low power bulb, not an incandescent.

Strangely enough, I thought the exact opposite and would have bet on it
being a halogen. The switch on &quot;pop&quot; could be due to the large inrush
current into a cold lamp. THe switch off &quot;pop&quot; could be due to breaking
an inductive circuit - a transformer between switch and wall socket.

However, probably nothing to get worried about. It might be stoppable,
or at least reduced, by a ferrite core on the power lead.

Hi
First find out if your PC's feeding your speakers (ie they do not have a
separate mains supply).
If so you have potential problems as PC's don't like surges of any kind
.(recommend you get a surge protection device either extinction lead with
built in or stand alone )
Either way you need to identify what is causing the &quot;pop&quot; .(yes I know when
you switch the lamp on ) the noise is interference which can be caused by
the switch arcing,the lamp lighting or even a loose wire in the lamp or plug
to name but 4.
This causes interference which can be either transmitted through the mains
cabling or radiated as a pulse which your speakers detect.(rather like when
you touch the end of the phono plug and it hums).

Solutions vary depending on the type and cause try the following.
Move the lamp away from the speakers and switch it on if still as loud most
likely case mains born interference.
A simple suppressor of filter should stop this.

If  noise is softer then its more likely to be inductive (radiated pulse )
In this case a simple faraday loop** on the phono lead may cure it (or just
relocate the lamp or main speaker)

The pop could damage the speakers eventually and if you have an expensive
speakers then you should try and sort the problem.

&quot;&quot; find a ferite ring  and loop the phoho lead through it 2 or 3 times .Try
an old usb lead sometimes they have one. (ferite is like grey/black stone )
or if you have a mobile or camcorder sometimes they give you one in the box
.(JVC did)

Ah, didn't think of that.  I was thinking of the choke in a CFL.  OK,

Bet it isn't a *conventional* incandescent!
