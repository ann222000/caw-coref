Hi

I'd like to capture some audio stream from a web radio.  I know about
streamripper, but it does not work for real audio.  And in particular,
if possible, I'd like to record what is being played, without knowing
the address of the real audio file (which I actually don't know: bbc
radio just starts the real player plugin in the web page).

any clue please?

thanks in advance
Lorenzo

that one requires an URL (see my post: I don't know how to get the

You mean that if you hold the mouse over the link, you don't see where
its pointing?  Personally, I wouldn't click on such a link.

Have you tried VLC?

I look into the HTML source and find the link to the real stream data. I
then download it using mplayer's &quot;-dumpstream&quot; option.

However, I've only done this for streamed Windows Media files using the
mms:// protocol.

YMMV

This is pretty easy if you have either mplayer or audacity installed.
If you happen to be playing from BBC 7 it is particularly easy, and all
you have to do is right click on the listen link and save the ram file
to your drive.  Then you just read it as it is plain text, and inside
you will find something like:

rtsp://rmv8.bbc.net.uk/bbc7/0930_sun.ra?BBC-UID=34f67dd2ff9daa4baac9cd5c20f 0b659244a9c75a07060437bfa8149d4698951&amp;SSO2-UID=

All you need is the stuff up to and including &quot;.ra&quot; which we can use in
an mplayer command as follows:

mplayer rtsp://rmv8.bbc.net.uk/bbc7/0930_sun.ra -vo null -vc null -ao
pcm:file=0930_sun.wav

That will then stream the content live and record it directly to the
hard drive as a wav file.

If you are using some other bbc site, such as BBC 4, then you just left
click on the listen button, which will pop up a new window with a
built-in player.  On the left side is a link for &quot;Play in standalone
Real player&quot; or some such.  Right click on this and save the resulting
ram or rm file and continue just as above.  The BBC radio sites other
than BBC 7 just have a built in litle player window of some kind
abstracting away the ram file, but it is still available in that link.

BTW, if all of that fails for some reason then you can always open
audacity (before the audio player to make sure your sound card is
available for recording), adjust your input to volume and set the volume
levels.  Then you can open the browser and start the player, and begin
the recording in audacity.  This will record the stream as a wav as
well, though if your signal drops out you will have to clean up any
silent patches in the file.  The mplayer way is much, much better as it
will automatically correct any failures in the feed and so the resulting
file will have no blank patches in it, so I really would recommend that
way first.

Hope this helps,

Patrick

In Iceweasel try Tools-&gt; Page Info-&gt; Media. It's definitely there in

This is a tough one.

Click the &quot;Listen&quot; link. A new window pops up. Then find the link named
&quot;Listen using stand-alone Real Player&quot;; right click that link and select
&quot;Copy to clipboard.&quot;

In an X terminal, use &quot;curl&quot; to view that link, e.g.

curl &quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/realmedia/fmg2.ram &quot;

That line returns a URL starting with &quot;rtsp://&quot;

Use copy and paste to download that URL with the downloader of your
choice, e.g.

mplayer -dumpstream &quot;rtsp://rmlive.bbc.co.uk/bbc-rbs/...&quot;

&gt; Well, neither could I.  I suppose that the Beeb has decided to really
&gt; hide the actual content and this time did a bang up job as far as I can
&gt; tell.  They seem to have gotten rid of the standalone player link on
&gt; their listen again player (though oddly BBC4 still has it and it is also
&gt; on the BBC Radio 2 listen live page) and that definitely puts a kink in
&gt; things.  I tried viewing the source for each frame and that didn't show
&gt; anything useful, at least not that I could recognize. :-) I even looked
&gt; via ps for the running realplay in hopes that it would reveal some clue,
&gt; but got nothing useful.

stupid since I wasn't able to find no such links ;-)

If you go to the home page for BBC radio 2 and click on Listen at the
top right, you will see the &quot;Listen using stand-alone Real Player&quot; link
on the left hand side.  That is the link I had expected on the player
used for Listen again, and it does seem odd that it exists on one player
and not the other.  Maybe BBC has a policy about listen again since it
is effectively &quot;play on demand&quot; where the live player requires you
stream in real time just when it happens to be on?  There is also a
disclaimer of sorts on the BBC Radio 2 pages saying that the listen
again player is having some difficulties.  Maybe this is one?  I am
inclined to think that is not the case though, and likely it is
intentional and has to do with the perceived difference of listen again
and live playing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Glad to hear.  It has always served me fine.  BTW, the only reason I
have not been prone to using dumpstream as I know others do is that for
some reason a while back I would get a mysterious failure that way and
mplayer would quit midstream.  I really don't know why, but using '-ao
pcm...&quot; has not had that problem as often, though I have run into it
from time to time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; by the way, isn't there a way to record directly in mp3 I suppose?
">

I suppose it may be possible, but I have never tried.  I always clean up
the resulting file anyway.  The files that mplayer records this way are
almost always quite a bit longer than the actual item being recorded,
and so I like to trim off the extra stuff on the ends, and I use either
audacity or sox to do that.  Wavs mean not having to uncompress and
recompress the stream which keeps it from degrading.  I also like to
normalize it and while it can be done with mp3 it doesn't work on most
players and so I do that to the wav and then compress it to ogg or mp3.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I do hope this is not the way that the BBC Radio people will be doing

">

Opera and Firefox (Iceweasel) just play the file in a hidden and
seamless way, which is obviously what should happen.  That makes it hard
to know what is being played but it does seem the expected behaviour.
Epiphany, on the other hand, fails and so alerts me to that and tells me
the full name of the file in so doing.  Good for us, but since the file
doesn't play it means that the plugins for realplay are not present and
working and neither is totem (which is what epiphany is trying to open
the file with.)  So, something in there does seem broken right now,
though that is actually a good thing.  It makes me wonder if I moved
realplay would that make the other browsers alert me similarly?  Just a
thought if I were desperate.

Note that the BBC-UID parameter is a cookie that enables them to
gather statistics about the number of users using their site and
things like that.  It may be left off entirely and the link will work
fine (but without providing them user statistics).  Normally a browser
would return the same cookie for that browser for the same user when
they visit the site again or download other content.

In other words it would probably be friendly if everyone avoided using
the same cookie.  Not providing a cookie I believe would appear as a
browser with cookies disabled.

&gt; by the way, isn't there a way to record directly in mp3 I suppose?

Not presently, at least not that mplayer allows.  The best that can be
done AFAICT is to dump to a pipe and to encode to ogg from the pipe in
parallel.  I have seen references to an &quot;mplayer-stdout&quot; but have not
been able to capture it yet.  I use the dump-to-a-named-pipe method
and then encode to ogg in parallel.

Agreed.

&gt;&gt; This is pretty easy if you have either mplayer or audacity installed.
&gt;&gt; If you happen to be playing from BBC 7 it is particularly easy, and all
&gt;&gt; you have to do is right click on the listen link and save the ram file
&gt;&gt; to your drive.  Then you just read it as it is plain text, and inside
&gt;&gt; you will find something like:

&gt; I'm trying with this one

&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/musicclub/events_andrewlloydwebber.shtml

&gt; and can't find such links, not even with Page Info (as suggested by
&gt; Joachim); could it be they changed something in their site?

&gt;&gt; BTW, if all of that fails for some reason then you can always open
&gt;&gt; audacity (before the audio player to make sure your sound card is
&gt;&gt; available for recording), adjust your input to volume and set the volume
&gt;&gt; levels.  Then you can open the browser and start the player, and begin
&gt;&gt; the recording in audacity.  This will record the stream as a wav as
&gt;&gt; well, though if your signal drops out you will have to clean up any
&gt;&gt; silent patches in the file.  The mplayer way is much, much better as it
&gt;&gt; will automatically correct any failures in the feed and so the resulting
&gt;&gt; file will have no blank patches in it, so I really would recommend that
&gt;&gt; way first.

&gt; I'll also try with audacity, but I'd like to use mplayer as you suggest...

&gt; thanks in advance

The reason you couldn't find the link was that you need to click on the
left hand side - the grey &quot;Now Playing&quot; section.  This is a separate frame
from the rest of the page and obviously gives different results to the right
hand side, when using Firefox/Iceweasel's View Page Info.  The media tab
now shows the required link:

/radio/aod/shows/rpms/radio2/fridaymusic.rpm

Append this to the BBC website address and use curl in a terminal window to
identify the direct
realaudio link, ie:

curl http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/shows/rpms/radio2/fridaymusic.rpm

The BBC isn't deliberately hiding the link - some pages come with a &quot;Open in
standalone player&quot; link, others don't.

I would also reiterate the need for saving the stream in .wav format as
there is usually dross (news/announcements etc) at the beginning and end of
the file that needs deleting.  This is best done on the lossless .wav file
rather than the lossy .mp3 - the latter is akin to re-editing a jpg file.
And the source audio isn't exactly CD quality to start with.
Audacity does a good job and offers many editing options and features.

To avoid having to remember the lengthy mplayer command line switches, I
generally record the stream then convert it, ie:

mplayer -dumpstream URL         (this is .ra format and can be played with
helix/realplayer)
mplayer -ao pcm stream.dump     (this is .wav format and can be opened in
audacity)

Incidently, others have already created direct links to many of the BBC
progs, see:

http://www.2blu.co.uk
http://beebotron.timeforabrew.com/#listenagainlinks

Funnily enough, your Friday Night is Music Night link is different in
each! Oh well, that's why we're using Linux - choice!
