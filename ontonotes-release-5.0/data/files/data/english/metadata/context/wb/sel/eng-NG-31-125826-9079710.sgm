outlines the case of two motorists who killed three people.

I wonder how badly motorists have to behave to be sentenced to the
full period for causing death by dangerous driving. If their actions
were not bad enough, what actions are?

I also wonder what it takes to get motorists charged with the
appropriate offence.

&gt;From the Brake website section on the guidelines for Judges
">

&quot;The most serious offences
5. The Panel suggested that custodial sentences over five years should
be reserved for cases involving an extremely high level of culpability
on the offender's part. This might be indicated by the presence of
three of more aggravating factors although an exceptionally bad
example of a single aggravating feature could be sufficient to place
on offence into this category. A sentence close to the maximum would
be appropriate in a case displaying a large number of these features,
or where there were other aggravating factors.&quot;

Given that they got jail sentences and a 6 year ban and you think this
is lenient what would a suitable sentence be in your view?

The law isn't really at fault, but weak judges are giving sentences based
on the prison population and the weak cps always is always going for the
easiest offence to make their life easier.  We need an elected DA type
position so that the public will is better reflected without the same
person trying to balance the enforcement the law with the cost of doing so.

In some cases I do feel a manslaughter charge would be better though, eg
like that one or this.

Indeed. More serious charges should have been made. Even if they
were not made, the Hutton should have imposed near the maximum
sentence, say 12 years.

Hmm, being strictly accurate, it appears one motorist killed three
people. Since the report states that the Porsche hit the Proton and
makes no mention of the Toyota having done so. It's also notable that
the Porsche driver had a history that indicates a driver attitude close
to insanity, in that he had on a previous occasion sprayed ammonia into
a driver's eyes. That tends to indicate that he had planned his actions,
since I doubt many driver carry a spray bottle of ammonia under normal
circumstances.

I agree, that driver should have faced a more severe penalty. The
sentence for the Toyota driver appears appropriate.

I wonder what self-righteous indignation Daily Mail readers like you and
Duhg will work your way up to next?

Why do you expect a government to value human life and to inculcate a
sense of value for human life at home, when that same givernment
exterminates hundreds of thousands simply to flex political muscles?

If you're trying to make some wider point about motorists, then your
logic is as flawed as ever. Drivers don't have to join some sort of
bizarre club where they all have to swear allegiance to each other, we
leave that up to the loonies who attend climate camps.

Sorry, I should have added that it seems to be a problem associated with
Porsche drivers. This happened not far from my home:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/370678.stm

Both drivers were acquitted:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/466909.stm

So if you want to get hysterically worked up about injustice, the case I
refer to is a better one to pick.

I think we can agree that Porsche drivers are twats, I doubt that you
will agree that there's really no wider point to be made.

Would manslaughter be more serious?  In the link above it resulted in
a 4 year sentence for the cyclist killer while the dangerous driving
charge resulted in 7 years for each racing driver.

Evidence of the &quot;appropriate offence&quot;, I should think.

Obviously, some people believe that convictions should be automatic,
without the nicety of evidence of guilt of the charge employed.

The report you have cited includes the following:

&quot;Fellow motorists described hearing a roaring noise 'like a jet
engine' as Kuti's Cayenne 4x4 whistled past - moments before ploughing
into a Proton pulling out of a junction.&quot;

Think about that, and consider whether a defence lawyer couldn't make
a lot of it.

For the record in the two cases quoted- I agree with you about the
case at Highclere and I think that the sentence for the Cayenne driver
was too lenient- he deserved the maximum penalty (14 years?) and a
life ban.

Its the gross generalisations that get up my nose- I've driven
Porsches for years and I've never had an accident or a conviction. Its

At the moment either a Mercedes or a FoB 4xFord, I prefer to drive
Jaguars and usually had one or two around until very recently. Jaguars
are, like RHD Porsches, entirely impractical for long drives on the
mainland. At present I'm thinking of buying an absolutely mindlessly
large 4x4 van.

So I'm used to knee-jerk prejudice.

However whereas Mercs appear to be the car of choice for inflated-ego
sales &quot;executives&quot;, and 4x4s are characterised as either for &quot;soccer
mums&quot; or &quot;gangstas&quot; just about every Porsche I see on the roads is
driven by a homicidal maniac. The few that are not are simply
statistical noise.

The other thing that Porker owners have in common is an overblown sense
of worth for their pointless vehicles. Possibly the worst combination
being any owner of the extremely stupid and ugly Cayenne, a vehicle
which seems to come with a lifetime supply of mind-altering drugs, since
most drivers of them seem to think that the asthmatic six cylinder
tiptronic has the performance of a Boxster.

It's worth noting that the driver who got seven years drove one of these
heaps of crap.

I work(ed) with TrafPol a lot, and it was fairly noteable that the
drivers being hauled up again and again and again... were all 911
drivers and that their speed was always such that they got a ban. If the
drivers aren't all anencephalic drooling retards why do they feature so
highly in plod's lists of car makes nicked for amusingly fast speeding?

BTW, here's a photo of a tyical Porker driver:

&lt; http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_articl
e_id=477535&amp;in_page_id=1770&gt;

Interestingly enough, he got nicked close to where a car I was in was
road raged by another 911 driver [1], who didn't seem to realise that
the vehicle I was in was an unmarked police vehicle driven by a traffic
officer. It wasn't possible for us to chase him, but the TO radioed in
the report and that driver was later nicked at 160mph.

[1] What seemed to irritate Mr Porker was the TO performing a perfectly
executed entry to a dual carriageway from the slip, matching his speed
to the traffic in lane 1.

Well, whie not screaming all-out fast like a Ferrari or Porsche, one can
drive any recent Aston, the Jag XJR and the XKR without looking like a

&gt; At the moment either a Mercedes or a FoB 4xFord, I prefer to drive

Hang on! Why are you suddenly agreeing with me for a change? Why the
radical viewpoint? Could it be that your conscience is finally
catching up with you and demanding that you take a closer, more
critical look at the world around you? Be careful though, you might be
prompted to give up your 4x4 and use a bicycle, while no longer
wastefully and cruelly exploiting animals for food.

People do agree with you from time to time on your less extreme

It's not &quot;a radical viewpoint.&quot;

I haven't changed my views and you have not previously expressed a view
