Do banks have to cut back on lending if the public desires to hold more

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; currency and fewer demand deposits?
">

No, if a bank is considered a good credit risk and can therefore borrow in
the money market, its lending is constrained only by the capital adequacy
requirement, not the reserve ratio requirement.  See
http://wfhummel.net/banklending.html .

If the public draws down its demand deposits to acquire currency (from
reserves of vault cash), the Fed will have to replenish the lost reserves by
purchasing Treasury securities in the open market.  Otherwise the Fed would
lose control of the Fed funds rate as banks scramble in the Fed funds market
to borrow the reserves they need to meet the reserve ratio requirement.  As
the Fed adds reserves of Fed funds, banks will swap them for cash from the
Fed as needed to replenish their lost vault cash.

The comments by Arnold Kling are ambiguous.  When one speaks of currency
depreciating, it can refer either to the loss in forex value of the nation's
currency (unit of account) or to rising prices of domestic goods and
services.  Since Kling mentions a run on banks, I suspect his reference to
currency is in the context of cash withdrawn from banks.  If so, that has no
direct effect on the money supply, which includes cash in circulation as
wells as the deposit liabilities of banks.  Also the amount of cash in
circulation does not drive prices as he implies.

Kling speaks of &quot;raising the growth rate of money&quot; as though it were a
control variable.  That can lead to a whole set of incorrect conclusions.
In truth the money supply varies as a function of demand for credit.  The
fact that the money supply rises is not important in itself since it is a
residual, i.e. dependent variable.

The important point is: what is creating an increase in the demand for
credit?  There are several factors that could be involved.  One is an
increase in commodity prices like oil which affects the general price level
of many products and services, including transportation and heating.
Another is increasing business investment in a growing economy.  Yet another
is an increasing employment level resulting in increased consumer spending,
especially through credit card usage.

Mark,

There is a host of misconceptions regarding money, in particular about money supply.
[M] I understand that if you raise the growth rate of the money supply, the currency depreciates.
[j] Money supply is an undefined quantity. That is the basic reason it is not longer used by the Fed to maintain a stable currency (very low inflation rate). [I am assuming that by  &quot;currency depreciates&quot; you mean inflation increases]. The Fed uses interest rates to stabilize the rate of overall demand change: it is generally successful at that. I do not mean that the money supply is irrelevant to the economy; it is quite relevant, if it means 'availability of money for purchasing'. However, it is practically ignored because there is no way to measure it. I believe that the reason for that is our compulsion, and the existence of opportunities,to save (to not spend).

[M] And I can see where banks that are suffering from a run might need reserves.
[j] Since the establishment of deposit insurance, back in 1935, there can be no bank runs in the U.S.

[M] ...and if the central bank adds reserves then this increases the money supply.
[j] The CB only adds reserve when interest rates are deemed too high. As I said, nobody that matters cares about money supply anymore.

[M] if the public switches out of demand deposits and into currency, then banks have to cut back on lending, and the money supply goes down.
[j] The bulk of bank lending come from savings deposits. There is about 15 times more savings than demand deposits. In addition, demand deposits are more useful as money than currency, except for small purchases. Most people (with money to spare) keep their money in 'cash management funds' (paying interest close to that of the Fed funds), and use credit cards for most purchases.
Also, bank lending is generally limited by demand,not by supply. Banks can always borrow reserves, rather than denying a loan.

Jorge.

The term &quot;money&quot; is used in many different ways, which is why there are many
conflicting points of view on the subject.  So let's avoid the ambiguity and
use the term &quot;dollars&quot; instead of money, and note that dollars are created
exclusively by the Fed, either as physical notes or bank deposits at the
Fed.

Banks issue credit which is simply a promise to pay dollars on demand, even
though a bank does not have enough dollars to meet all of its promises
simultaneously.  A deposit of dollars in a bank adds to the bank's
reserves.  However creating a deposit to fund a bank loan adds nothing to
the bank's reserves or its capital.  The only thing that results is a new
entry on the borrower's account.  A bank loan does indeed create credit (as
distinct from dollars) out of thin air.

That is the reason their liabilities (deposits) are equal to their assets

If bank assets equaled liabilities, its capital/asset ratio would be zero

William,
I beg to differ: banks can not create loans out of thin air. They need deposits. What a bank lends is bank money (claims to currency), and not the currency itself (the bank makes the exchange between one and the other automatically, so some people do not notice the difference). What you call 'a promise to pay dollars on demand' is what everybody else calls bank money (or claims to currency). Credit is a loan payable at a future date, and by no means 'a promise to pay dollars on demand'.
[W]For example, if you purchase something with a credit card, you have created a liability (and a credit) out of thin air.
When one 'pays' with a credit card, one is drawing on a line of credit; it all seem like coming from thin air, but please believe me it does not.

But I guess we could have avoided this growing controversy if you could just tell me where do you think the money that a bank lends, come from. Wait, if your answer is 'from thin air' please don't bother repeating it: I get your point.

Jorge.

The bank doesn't lend dollars (as I defined it previously to avoid this

loan.  A credit card loan is basically a bank loan created out of thin air
by the act of using the card to pay for the purchase.

William,
Sorry to have to disagree, again.
[W] To cover the loan created by the bank, it will need $10,000 in reserves.  Deposits are bank liabilities and reserves are assets.  Total reserves held by banks are a small fraction of their deposit liabilities.
[j] A $10,000 loan does not affect reserves. Reserves are required only on checking deposits. As long as the loan remains in the bank as demand deposit (as I said, for very short time), the bank requires only about $1,000 in reserves; when the loan money is withdrawn, the bank would need to receive another $9,000 to cover the $10,000 loan (the $1,000 in reserve is no longer necessary).
Only in a full reserve regime (which we are not in) would a bank need to back its $10,000 loan with a $10,000 reserve.
Another thing; it is true that deposits are bank liabilities, but loans are the bank assets. Reserves are also assets, but they constitute a very small fraction of the outstanding loans.

[j] Loans and deposits must balance.

[W]] Not exactly true.
[j] I neglected to include reserves in the balance between assets (loans) and deposits, but reserves are less than 1% of total deposits.
[W] ...Government spending creates a net imbalance between deposits and loans.
The effects of government spending, except for its size are just like those of any private company, or a very wealthy individual. Government, the Fed excluded, has no powers to create currency. I have no idea of the kind of imbalance you have in mind. Do you know what is the relative size of such imbalance? And how long does it last?
[W] However cash withdrawals from banks do not create an imbalance because the Fed normally  replenishes deposits by buying securities from the public to replace the cash reserves lost to such withdrawals.
[j] Cash withdrawals from a bank go normally to other banks, thus there is no net loss of reserve to the banking system. There are leakages, certainly, like when currency is sent abroad, or kept under a mattress.
And the Fed only acts after the imbalance is large enough to affect the interest of interbank loans.

But, aren't we getting off the subject? Whatever happened to the loans been made out of thin air?

Jorge.

&gt;     Sorry to have to disagree, again.
&gt; [W] To cover the loan created by the bank, it will need $10,000 in
&gt; reserves.  Deposits are bank liabilities and reserves are assets.  Total
&gt; reserves held by banks are a small fraction of their deposit liabilities.
&gt; [j] A $10,000 loan does not affect reserves. Reserves are required only on
&gt; checking deposits. As long as the loan remains in the bank as demand deposit
&gt; (as I said, for very short time), the bank requires only about $1,000 in
&gt; reserves; when the loan money is withdrawn, the bank would need to receive
&gt; another $9,000 to cover the $10,000 loan (the $1,000 in reserve is no longer
&gt; necessary).

The bank had better have $10,000 in reserves at the time it makes a $10,000
loan, because the funds may be spent on the same day granted.  In your
previous message you said &quot; the bank will need $10,000 in deposits to
replace the lost reserves.&quot;  Ultimately it will need deposits of that
amount, but it can borrow the required reserves in the money market for an
indefinite period, and normally does so.  Non-banks do that as a regular
practice.

[W] ...Government spending creates a net imbalance between deposits and

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; loans.
">

The effects of government spending, except for its size are just like those

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; of any private company, or a very wealthy individual. Government, the Fed
&gt; excluded, has no powers to create currency. I have no idea of the kind of
&gt; imbalance you have in mind. Do you know what is the relative size of such
&gt; imbalance? And how long does it last?
">

Government spending is now balanced on average with receipts from taxes and
bond sales to the public.  However in the past, the the Treasury spent money
acquired directly from the sale of bonds to the Fed, which had the effect of
increasing deposits (and bank reserves) not matched by bank loans.  That
ended in 1951 with the Accord between the Treasury and the Fed.  I don't
know how much of that imbalance remains today.

[W] However cash withdrawals from banks do not create an imbalance because

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the Fed normally  replenishes deposits by buying securities from the public
&gt; to replace the cash reserves lost to such withdrawals.
">

[j] Cash withdrawals from a bank go normally to other banks, thus there is

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; no net loss of reserve to the banking system. There are leakages, certainly,
&gt; like when currency is sent abroad, or kept under a mattress.
">

No, withdrawals of cash go mainly to foreign interests, not to US banks.
The overseas demand for US currency accounts for most of the Treasury debt
held by the Fed which it monetized to restore reserves lost by US banks.

But, aren't we getting off the subject? Whatever happened to the loans been

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; made out of thin air?
">

Banks can increase total transaction deposits at will and the Fed must
respond by providing whatever reserves the banks need to cover the
transactions.  That amounts to creating loans out of thin air.  I don't
think there is much more to say about it.
