Vintage Steel Rod and 1905 deuce Reel

Reminds me of one my dad had when I was a little boy some 60 odd years ago.
Seems to be in great shape and the reel even works like new!
I bought it at an old farm auction in Minnesota several years ago and just
never did anything with it.

The set was made in the USA and the reel is a 1905 Deuce model PX. There is
more writing on it but these old eyes can't read it.
The steel rod still flexes like new and the handles and everything else is
in great shape.
It is an ACTION ROD made by Orchard Industries Inc. Detroit 12, Michigan.
