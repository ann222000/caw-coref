Hi Folks,
Boy, I went away for a few days and look what happened. Where did all
the fs: and wtb: posts come from? I thought this was a discussion group. I
guess we'll have to make it as clear as can be
NO FS: OR WTB: HERE.
Now, what part of no don't you understand?
This ought to rattle a few cages, how about it Ben

I think it should be pretty obvious what has happened to the group. It
has died. It is dead. It has gone the way of all others who stray from
their stated purpose. It's an interesting process. It is a good thing at
the start, with people sharing information and talking about antiques --
real antiques. And then the first few FS posts show up, and then more
when they are allowed to stay without comment. And then the few folks who
do speak up are spammed mercilessly, lectured about *free trade* and the
rights of man to buy and sell Velvet Elvis paintings and 1992 Playboy
magazines. And then the latecomers are right... they are just doing what
they see everyone else doing, while the discussion group melts and turns
away with a bad taste in their mouths.

I'm afraid no amount of breastbeating will change it. The group is dead.
Personally, I am patronizing sites where the antiques are pictured and the
prices are posted. You want this, you pay this much. Simple. I *talk*
about antiques with regulars who have kept in touch over time. It would
be nice to talk to others about the things I like but I'm afraid they've
all left the group for greener pastures.

I wish you all, old and new members alike, the best and good hunting for
what you like. Those of us who feel a bit disgruntled will just have to
swallow hard and move on. It's a shame, because it was nice while it
lasted.

If this is your attitude Ben then why in the hell do you subscribe to

to pass-on information to others what's your point in being here?
Although I do find your post &quot;Funny&quot; not amusing just ..... Funny.

As I said: &quot;Get real&quot;. And as you well know by now that others have been
telling you and yours from all around the world by there WTB/FS postings,
that since this group is unmoderated it really doesn't matter what this
groups was &quot;founded&quot; upon or what the FAQ says!

Likewise, if you ask ninetynine out of a hundred people something specific
about anything, you might want to just go ahead and look it up in a couple
of good reference books to get the right answer. At least that is what
this groups FAQ goes on, and on, and on about. And if your still too lazy
to do that, then just pay someone else to do it for you.

Actually news:rec.antiques.marketplace and other such WTB/FS groups like
news:alt.military.collecting are far more interesting places than here, as
the unrestricted &quot;free&quot; trade in antiques and relics is where the action
is!

The only ''wooden head'' here Iam afraid is yourself Ben. You can call
me anything under the sun, but one thing Iam not, is a ng control
freak, nor a ''freek'' although Iam sure what a ''freek'' is, perhaps
one of those Californian terms.

So really what's your hang-up Ben? This ng is for discussion that is
conversation on specific subjects and the subject in this ng is
''antiques'' so what's the problem with that. Don't think I recall any
of your post so far dicussing anything other than ''your'' right to
post WTB/FS ads to this ng. Time you grew up, you are behaving like an
ill-breed child.

By the way Ben............... how many other languages do you speak
other than (American) English and Bollocks?

:&gt;P.S. we dont believe the Captain of the Bounty spelt his name like that.

There was a Nellie Bly, U.S.newspaper writer whose around-the-world
race against a theoretical record made the name celebrated and a
synonym for the feminine star reporter.

On Nov. 14, 1889, she sailed from New York to beat the record of
Phileas Fogg, hero of Jules Verne's romance Around the World
in Eighty Days. The ''World'' built up the story by daily articles and
a guessing contest in which whoever came nearest to naming
Nellie's time in circling the globe would get a trip to Europe. There
were nearly 1,000,000 entries in the contest. Nellie rode on ships and
trains, in jinrikishas and sampans, on horses and burros. On the final
lap of her journey the ''World'' brought her from San Francisco to New
York by special train; she was greeted everywhere by brass bands,
fireworks, and like panoply. Her time was 72 days, 6 hours, 11
minutes, and 14 seconds.

Of course William Bligh, was the English admiral who commanded HMS
Bounty at the time of the celebrated mutiny on that ship. In a
remarkable feat of seamanship, Bligh eventually reached Timor in the
East Indies on June 14, 1789, after a voyage of about 3,600 miles
(5,800 km) in the open longboat. Christian and eight others took the
Bounty to Pitcairn Island, where the small colony that they founded
was undiscovered until 1808 and where their descendants still reside.
Of the mutineers who later went to Tahiti, three were taken to England
and hanged. The mutiny made little difference to Bligh's career. He
visited Tahiti again and successfully transported more breadfruit
trees to the West Indies (1792). As captain of the Director, he was
put ashore when his crew joined the mutiny of The Nore (1797). He
commanded this ship with distinction at the Battle of Camperdown that
year, however, as he did the Glatton at Copenhagen (1801). He was sent
to New South Wales as governor in 1805. Again, complaints of his
&quot;oppressive behaviour&quot; led in 1808 to a mutiny, this time under the
acting head of the New South Wales Corps in Sydney, Major George
Johnston, who put Bligh under arrest. The mutineers were subsequently
found guilty of conspiracy. Bligh was later promoted to rear admiral
(1811) and vice admiral (1814).

Bligh's character has been variously interpreted. He does not seem to
have been unduly tyrannical, but his abusive tongue and his
overbearing manner made him unpopular as a commander. He possessed
undoubted courage in battle and great skill as a navigator.

I'm really getting tired of all the pot shots being taken out here. This
is a free internet! if you don't like what you are finding in this
newsgroup, turn it off !!!!! No one single person or group of persons for
that matter is going to control the content of this or any other public or
unmoderated newsgroup. So why don't you all grow up and accept what is
coming over the newsgroup or shut the damn thing off ! I am really getting
tired of getting messages from the mommies of this group when I post
messages about upcoming auctions that my posts are inappropriate. This
isn't a private phone line for you to conduct only business you deem
appropriate. I'm happy to share any information that I may have about
particular subject with out wanting any kind of pay back for it. But I
also believe that I should not be penalized for offering information that
is not asked for. As Ben says this is a free enterprise system and if we
all stayed where we were supposed to be there would be no United States of
America ! After all our country was founded by people who were tired of
people telling them where to go &amp; what to do ! Why don't you all go to
some of the so called antique oriented spam sites that you all are
complaining about &amp; maybe you might learn something ! I went to Ben's site
last night &amp; there is a great deal of information dealing with the civil
war &amp; other military flags. It was a wealth of knowledge ! In other other
words live &amp; let live ! If your not interested in the title of the post,
don't read it ! Simple as that.. Stop being so petty &amp; controlling ! I
realize this message may, to quote a member of this group, antagonize a
few people, but what the heck ! Free speech is worth every lost customer,
no matter how much money they may have ! I'm just a poor honest working
stiff trying to support a family &amp; make a living ! Luck &amp; Success to all..

"/> Actually, We all get real tired of all this but there is a
rec.antiques.marketplace newsgroup, also unmoderated, which was
specially created to take the WTB/FS messages. It is a successful
newsgroup and so newcomers are asked to use it and keep rec.antiques
for discussion rather than buying/selling. Doesn't that seem reasonable ?

A Free Internet you say ? Take a good look around you...there are
more and more restrictions being placed on newsgroups through
moderation and auto-bots...all because more users adopt the attitude
that they are free to do whatever they like and upset other users.

If newsgroup users increasingly adopt the attitude &quot; I'll post what

newsgroups will become Moderated, with approved-users lists, and
then nobody will be able to &quot;post where and what the hell they like&quot;

There have already been 2 attempts to change &quot;rec.antiques&quot; to
moderated status and that is happening to a lot of newsgroups right
now. Do you read &quot;news.announce.newgroups&quot; regularly ? Watch how
many proposals and votes there are for Moderated newsgroups.

And
:&gt;So why don't you all grow up and accept what is

Does this only apply to the rest of us, or are you included as well?

And went on:
:&gt;:&gt; I'm happy to share any information that I may have about

:&gt;:&gt;also believe that I should not be penalized for offering information that

So what are you saying, that you are happy to supply (free)
information to the ng members 'provided' that you can also post your
commercial advertisements, promoting your services and websites.

I have been to your websites and to be honest I found no informative
information, I found thumbnails of your stock and the promotion of
your auctions, a purely commercial sites. The advertisements you have
posted to this ng have been the same advertisements (ie content) you
have post to several other groups, almost like mini-spams.

Personally I don't care what you post to this or any other ng, I don't
read FS/WTB or Spams, and my software doesn't download any thing
bigger than 100lines, so I miss the big spams. Without wishing to
contol anybody or anything the majority in this group do not wish
WTB/FSs or Spams, it was like that when I joined approx a year ago and
to my knowledge it has always been that way, so I go along with the
majority and the ng Charter. Whether one agrees or disagrees with this
really isn't the point, it's whether you a prepared to accept the
current situration and the objectives of the ng, and the reasons for
its existence, if you're not, then what's your point.

So I disagree with you, fair enough, but I can't stop you and your
like posting adverts, I read and keep what interests me the rest goes
down the pan.

I just had one more thought. ( no snide remarks please ) I know there are
a lot of people that are lurking in the shadows &amp; following this rather
amusing thread. So I have a proposition. I would like to take an informal
pole of all the readers of this group &amp; ask them if a post about an
antique auction or an antique web site really offends them or if they at
least occasionally go look into some of these posts &amp; find them of
interest. If the majority seems to agree with the charter of this group
not only will I stop posting my so called commercial advertisements I will
help keep others from doing so. I have tried to participate in this group
only to have my posts responded to in a sarcastic manner or not at all. So
I guess that has contributed to my attitude. All the complaining about
commercial posts seem to be coming from a small group of individuals which
seem to be speaking for the masses. So how about it all you lurkers let's
hear your opinion &amp; maybe we can put this thread to rest. Luck &amp; Success
To All !

As a semi-lurker that visits this group on at least a daily basis, my view
is that this place was to be a relaxed lounge where we could discuss and
also view others opinions and advice on issues about collecting antiques,
problems of finding restoration sources or historic references, and in
general enjoy the fellowship of those with a common interest. These types
of groups are patterned after their real world counterparts where
collectors and dealers often congregrate at a local watering hole after a
show and discuss the hobby with a gentleperson's (pc) agreement that this
is a time to unwind and not to market and those that seem unable to keep
handbills, business cards, flyers in their pockets are usually shunned,
laughed at, or decorated with some stray stale beer until they get the
message. When attending most professional seminars and association
meetings the same &quot;No Solicitation&quot; manners apply. That's why you're
getting these hostile reactions- if we wanted to hear the din of commerce
we know hundreds of places to go but we should have the right to find a
place where we have mutually agreed to put the sales book away, put our
feet up on the furniture and relax. Having found that and agreed on the
rules tacked on the door as the price of admission, we welcome all to sit
by the fire and swap tales and woes &quot;All very large, because nobody ever
brought anything small in a bar&quot; (Elwood Dowd, in Harvey)

(and continued...)

All the complaining about commercial posts seem to be coming from a small
group of individuals which seem to be speaking for the masses. So how about
it all you lurkers let's hear your opinion &amp; maybe we can put this thread
to rest.

One lurker's response:
I swore not to participate in the bickering that, you are quite correct,
many of
us have been reading, but you so completely state the point of the people
who
are objecting to the commercialism that I have to point it out.

You, yourself, say that &quot;if the majority seems to agree with the charter of
this group...&quot; Well, dammit, that's the point. The majority does agree with
the
charter of the group, by definition, else it would have a different
charter! As
several others have pointed out, there is a perfectly acceptable newsgroup
chartered for the posting of WTB and FS notices. It's not this one. It
seems to me that your return would be small from a &quot;commercial&quot; posting in
a group where it isn't expected. Your return should be greater from a group
where people go specificially to find them, don't you think?

Having said that, I must admit that I personally am able to read or not
read
any posting here, as are we all. The fact that you wish to post your ads
here
really doesn't bother me, because I can read them or not. It's just the
wrong-headed logic that I have seen several posts (maybe not yours; I don't
file them) using to support someone's &quot;right&quot; to do so that is annoying.
Please don't confuse personal freedom with anarchy. I think that will cause
more problems than it will solve, in the long run. And don't confuse me
with a net-control freak for having said that. I was a hippie in the 60s,
and I have yet to turn Republican! I just vote for common sense and mutual
understanding that we are using a SHARED resource. Thanks.

SNIP!!!

&gt; One lurker's response:
&gt; I swore not to participate in the bickering that, you are quite correct,
&gt; many of
&gt; us have been reading, but you so completely state the point of the people
&gt; who
&gt; are objecting to the commercialism that I have to point it out.

&gt; .............................................................As
&gt; several others have pointed out, there is a perfectly acceptable newsgroup
&gt; chartered for the posting of WTB and FS notices. It's not this one.

"/> SNIP!!! A nicely make series of points sacrificed to the bandwidth Gods.

Another Lurker's response:

My vote is for complying with the charter. After all,
rec.antiques.marketplace should provide an adequate vehicle for the
FS/WTB notices.

It really annoys me to read it in the &quot;marketplace&quot; ng and then
encounter the same notice here. I view &quot;marketplace&quot; for the purpose of
seeing what is available, but what I want when I come to this newsgroup
is information. Admittedly I just skip the FS/WTB items, but I think
many of the people that used to contribute a great deal of information
and help have become irritated completely abandoned this ng because of
the abuse that is taking place.

Because there is a separate marketplace newsgroup, I feel that FS/WTB
posts do not belong in rec.antiques, including pointers to web sites
unless the site contains reference information that goes beyond a
merchandising ploy. The charter has value and helps atttract people who
make the group interesting. We've lost many valuable contributors who
felt choked out by inappropriate postings.

On the other hand, I'm not against posting slightly off-charter messages
in groups where there is no good alternative. I think the friction that
results is healthy because it can stimulate creation of an appropriate
group. For instance, there is no marketplace group that attracts exactly
the same sort of person who reads rec.antiques.radio+phono. And in my
case, there is no group specifically for discussing early electricity in
general. So I lurk in r.a.r.+.p., and probably post more non-radio/phono
messages there than some readers would like. Eventually there may be
enough of us old electricity or light-bulb freaks to successfully launch
our own group.

&gt; I am not interested in seeing what people have to sell in this
&gt; newsgroup. For that, there is rec.antiques.marketplace. I really do wish
&gt; people would use rec.antiques for discussion, and only for discussion.

&gt; Karen

"/> I agree with Karen. It would be nice if people kept the commerce out
of rec.antiques and used it for discussion and information. If I were
looking to buy or sell something, I'd go to rec.antiques.marketplace.

Posts about auctions fall into the same category;I'd prefer to see them
in r.a.marketplace. Posts about websites are interesting if the website
in question actually contains information or articles about antiques
rather than just a list of items for sale.

"/> Unfortunately, Darlene is right, and it's a real shame. Remember the
70's mantra, &quot;Knowledge wants to be free!&quot;? Everytime the real
discussion moves off to a private mailing group, people who don't
belong lose the opportunity to learn something they might enjoy or profit
from knowing. The potential of the net is unrealized.

There's a nasty cycle going over and over again, since every week a new
crop of participants join, people who didn't help charter the group in
the first place and who either don't understand why a group should be
limited to discussion, or just don't care. In face-to-face
organizations, you quickly build up a situation so that new people are
taken under somebody's wing and learn off-line, so the group as a whole
expands in knowledge. But here, off-topic people are always coming on,
and the old ones get tired of being the only ones contributing to the
discussion, and so we are constantly forming and re-forming, and never
get a chance to develop further.

In the three years I've been reading this newsgroup I've seen it reach
the desperation point twice, and each time, we lose people I learned so
much from. If the vendors went to the marketplace, where we could visit
them when we felt like buying, I would hope that that cycle would be
broken, and we could keep the old wise ones as we gain new ones (and
there are always really nifty new people just waiting to talk if they
don't get scared off by spam and bickering.)

I used to think it was just a matter of education and patience, but now
I'm discouraged.

it's nice to have a place where we can talk without somebody putting the

THE VOTE IS IN !
Greetings to all !
Well it's been 2 days since I asked for my informal poll on the opinion of
the lurkers of this group &amp; the overwelming response is to keep all FS &amp;
WTB
&amp; site notification posts OUT. I bow to the ruling of the majority &amp; offer
my most sincere apologies. I will no longer post my auction ads or web
site notices in this group. Now can we put this thread to rest ! I have a
suggestion for the posting of the Charter Guidelines. Whoever is the
keeper of the Rules should post once each day the rules of the group under
a heading something like this. ! Newcomers READ FIRST. The leading
exclamation point will put the post at the top of the list each day so the
first thing they see will be the post containing the guidlines of the
group. I realize this won't stop all the junk from coming through but at
least the people who care to play by the rules will know what they are.
Luck &amp; Success To All !

&gt; :&gt;the fs: and wtb: posts come from? I thought this was a discussion
group. I
&gt; :&gt;guess we'll have to make it as clear as can be
&gt; :&gt; NO FS: OR WTB: HERE.
&gt; :&gt;Now, what part of no don't you understand?
&gt; :&gt; This ought to rattle a few cages, how about it Ben
&gt; :&gt;sam

&gt; Well Ralph .... one+63

&gt; You've heard of the Oscars, and the Toni's, think you should be given
&gt; the special ''Benny'' award. One+63 must be the biggest thread ever in
&gt; rec.antiques ............................ and it's all down to you :-)

&gt; Going away again Ralph. :-)

Interesting that, not seeing too many Oscars on the market over here
I've never really thought about the collectable value before, but I
suppose your right. And I suppose the artist would make the big
difference, for example John Wayne's ''True Grit'' Oscar most be worth
a lot of money. But if you had a real one on the mantlepiece no one
would believe you, would all think it was one of those cheapo repros.

Anyways Ben, forget the Oscars only way you'll get one is indeed at
one of these silly Hollywood auctions, all for charity done in the
best possible taste.

The ''Benny'' is a better bet, these are ........ priceless. Now be a
good boy Ben and who knows, might be your turn next :-)

If anyone is really hot for an OSCAR, try Christies's of Los Angeles
(310-385-2644). In their Saturday, 7 June 1997, Classic Hollywood Sale
unsold lot #176 featured Claudette Colbert's 1934 Best Actress Oscar for
&quot;It Happened One Night&quot;. Unrealized estimate was $150,000 to $200,000.

The Oscar sales price track record to date is:

1) Best Picture, $ 15,769 ..&quot;American In Paris&quot; (1951). sold in 1988.
2) Marlon Brando, $ 13,500 ..&quot;On The Waterfornt&quot; (1954), sold in 1980's.
3) Special Effects $ 10,648 ..&quot;Spawn Of The North&quot; (1938), sold in 1980's
4) Charles Corburn,$ 15,000 ..&quot;The More The Merrier&quot;(1943)
5) Harold Russel $ 57,000 ..&quot;The Best Years Of Our Lives&quot;,in 1990's
6) Joan Crawford $ 68,000 &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, sold in 1994.
7) John Lennon $110,000 ..?????
8) Howard Koch $184,000 ..&quot;Casablanca&quot; co-writer, sold in 1994.
9) Viviein Leigh $510,000 ..&quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, sold in 1993
10) Clark Gable $607,500 ..&quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, sold in 1996

Have never seen a fake Oscar, only real ones, which are quite easy to
recognize as they weigh 8.5 pounds, are 13.5 inches tall (10.5 inches of
statuette on a three inch base), bottom base is 5.25 inches wide, the
statuette being made of Britannia; an alloy of tin (92.5%), coper (7.5%),
and antimony (like hard pewter), and then it is platted with coatings of
copper, nickel, silver, and 24-karat gold. Britannia by the way was also
the material used in the pistol ball that killed U.S. President Lincoln!

As for actually finding one the statistics are not all that astronomical
based on the documented numbers that have been distributed:

81 BEST PICTURE, year first awarded (1927/28) [Called First Awards]
65 BEST ACTOR, (1927/28) [tie in 1931/32] [2 refusals - 1970, 72]
51 BEST ACTOR, SUPPORTING (1932-42 plaque, 1943 Statuette)
67 BEST ACTRESS, (1927/28) [tie in 1968]
51 BEST ACTRESS, SUPPORTING (1936-42 plaque, 1943 Statuette)
210 ART DIRECTION (1927/28) -- SET DECORATION (1955)
108 CINEMATOGRAPHY (1927/28)
84 COSTUME DESIGN (1948)
66 DIRECTING (1928/29) [2 director winners for 1961]
1 DIRECTING - COMEDY (1927/28 only)
1 DIRECTING - DRAMA (1927/28 only)
129 DOCUMENTARY FEATURE/SHORT SUBJECT (1945)
1 ENGINEERING EFFECTS (1927/28 only)
70 FILM EDITING (1943)
46 FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM (1947) [&quot;Honorary Award&quot; pre-1956]
28 *JEAN HERSHOLT HUMANITARIAN AWARD (1956)
98 *HONORARY/SPECIAL AWARD (1927/28) [other listed elsewhere]
28 *MAKEUP (1981) [&quot;Honorary Awards&quot; in 1964 and 1968]
120 MUSIC - SCORING (1945)
94 MUSIC - SONG (1945)
11 *GORDON E&gt; SAWYER AWARD (1981)
60 *SCIENTIFIC/TECHNICAL - Class I/Award of Merit (1929/30)
58 SHORT SUBJECT/FILM - Animated (1945)
76 SHORT SUBJECT/FILM - Live Action (1945)
128 SOUND (1929/30)
5 SOUND EFFECTS (1963-1975)
18 *SOUND EFFECTS EDITING (1981)
41 *SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD (1972)
42 SPECIAL EFFECTS (1942-1962)
1 UNIQUE AND SRTISTIC PICTURE (1927/28 only)
67 *VISUAL EFFECTS (1963)
207 WRITING (1927/28) [1st award ever refused 1935]

2,113 TOTAL AWARDS distributed up to and including 1996. However legally
only pre-1950's Oscars without signed anti-sales agreements can be sold.

Good hunting!!

"/> ***********************************************************
Oscar's birth took place at a Hollywood banquet on May 11, 1927. Louis B.
Mayer, president of MGM, had Cedric Gibbons, an MGM art director, design
the statuette; a figure of a knight holding a crusader's sword standing
atop a reel of film whose five spokes signified the five original
branches of the Academy (Actors, Directors, Producers, Tecnicians, and
writers). The official name of the statuette has always been; &quot;The Academy
Award of Merit&quot;; The more familiar nickname &quot;Oscar&quot; was first recorded in
print by Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky, in his column dated March 18,
1934. Others have claimed to be the origin of the name; such as Best
Actress Betty Davis, who was quoted as saying that the statuette reminded
her of her husband's physique. Her husband happened to be named Oscar.

About the John Lennon Oscar; it was for &quot;Let It Be&quot;.

&gt;I would love to see this group return to its charter and be a discussion
&gt;group. Unfortunately, I truly doubt that that will ever happen.

"/> Sure it can happen. But someone's gotta make it happen.
In the 5 or so years I've been reading this newsgroup (and posting
when I have time, which hasn't been often lately), this argument
about WTB/FS ads has come up more times than I care to recall.

I adamantly supported and still support keeping this an unmoderated
newsgroup, simply because I enjoy the freedom to decide for myself
what I will and will not read. The price is that we get a few
novices who don't see the FAQ and post WTB/FS ads here and,
occasionally, some stubborn souls who feel it's their *right*
to ignore the charter. It can be annoying, but in the context
of life in general, no one will die over it, regardless of
which side they're on. :)

If you want to see more discussions, ask a question that will
be likely to evoke more than yes-or-no answers. Share an experience.
Tell about your latest treasure dug out of a pile of Tupperware
at a garage sale. And if you ignore the people who insist
They have some God-ordained right to post their for sale ads
here, instead of calling them names and engaging in endless
arguments, they *might* go away.

Back to lurking,

constant otherwise your pictures will look distorted and munged
unless viewed in exactly the same font as the one you have used.

&gt; discussion/advice and firmly sending those who have things to sell to the
&gt; Marketplace site.

&gt; Much of this is a symptom of what's going around our whole personal world;
&gt; Not every inter-personal contact should be a marketing opportunity and
&gt; it's nice to have a place where we can talk without somebody putting the
&gt; sell on us. Sadly, too many people take more care in whether they have
&gt; enough business cards in going to a wedding or funeral than thinking about
&gt; the fundimental reason they were invited.

Evidently you do not visit many newsgroups.
Generally they host &quot;for sale&quot; and &quot;wanted&quot; postings as long as the
subject falls under the catagory of the NG. Lots of folks seek out the
NG's for that reason. They can center their posts to the appropriate
readers and seekers.
Millions more people each year are seeking out NG's in fields of their
interests or hobbies and as long as the titles are so vague as this
group
you will find more of what is distasteful to YOU.
This does not by any means make those postings unpleasant to other
readers of the group. If you just bought this NG and have your own
following of old crows who believe as you do, than change the name to
suit your pleasures.

RESPECTFULLY,

Just a bit of antique American flag info in passing. If ever you run
across a copy of the 1973 Smithonian book entitled: &quot;Thirteen-Star Flags&quot;,
by Grace Cooper, therein you will find that the round 13 star American
flag pattern (the so called &quot;Colonies&quot; flag) earliest usage dates to 1792.
And that the 3/2/3/2/3 six pointed star pattern dates to prior to 1779.

"/> Hi,

I'm new to this ng and have, with some amusement, read all the bantering
back and forth about whats supposed to be posted here and what's not.
I can understand both sides of the arguement about posting WTB and FS as
long as they pertain to the subject(I for one have posted a WTB here
before I knew better). What I can't understand is this &quot;artwork&quot; that
keeps showing up here. Am I missing something? What does this have to
do with antiques? Just because you deal in costume jewelery doesn't mean
you should clog up this ng with this stuff. It has no merit here......

I guess find another Cromwell? In any case, it would make for lots of new
obsolete and then antique flags, like those of Hong Kong. Seems the UK
flag hasn't really changed since the addition of Saint Patrick Cross of
Ireland in 1801.

"/> ********************************************
For anyone interested, unlike the UK flag, the U.S. flag has &quot;officially&quot;
changed some 27 times since the first U.S. flag act of June 14th 1777. So
if you want to know how old your American flag is just count the number of
stars, and also be sure to do a textile and construction analysis to
verify it is of the period? The star/state count goes something like this:

#Stars Period of use
------ -------------
1) 13 1777 to 1795
2) 15 1795 to 1818
3) 20 1818 to 1819
4) 21 1819 to 1820
5) 23 1820 to 1822
6) 24 1822 to 1836
7) 25 1836 to 1837
8) 26 1837 to 1845
9) 27 1845 to 1846
10) 28 1846 to 1847
11) 29 1847 to 1848
12) 30 1848 to 1851
13) 31 1851 to 1858
14) 32 1858 to 1859
15) 33 1859 to 1861
16) 34 1861 to 1863
17) 35 1863 to 1865
18) 36 1865 to 1867
19) 37 1867 to 1877
20) 38 1877 to 1890
21) 43 1890 to 1891
22) 44 1891 to 1896
23) 45 1896 to 1908
24) 46 1908 to 1912
25) 48 1912 to 1959
26) 49 1959 to 1960

may be taking, if you truely belong to the group, then your input is
important. It is much better retaining such disscussions within one
thread than spreading the discussion to serveral threads, which
happens in this group much to often. Of course everyone has the free
choice as to what they read or don't read, which is where we came in,

about the ng being controlled or tells the rest of us they have the

Subject: Re: Better US FLAG
Date: Mon, 22 Nov 1993 01:30:23 GMT

Just so you want to get all the measurements right, a US flag should
be similar to the specifications set out by President Taft in 1912:

The width (hoist) / length (fly) ratio should be in the ratio of 1
to 1.9. The thirteen stripes at equal width. The hoist of the blue
field containing the stars fixed at 7/13 of the overall hoist,
extending from the top of the flag to the bottom of the seventh
stripe. The fly of the blue field was fixed at a tiny fraction over
3/4 fourths of the overall hoist. The diameter of each star is a
minute fraction under 1/16 of the overall hoist. So there!

&gt;So there!

"/> ***************************************************
Only the 48/49/50 star U.S. flags are subject to the cited size and
proportion &quot;specifications&quot;. Earlier U.S. flags were made any old way, and
as such are considered, like quilts, to be works of &quot;folk art&quot;.

This is also why the &quot;specificications&quot; referenced came into being as
there was no standardization of the design of the earlier star pattern
flags, i.e.:

13/15/20/21/23/24/25/26/27/28/29/30/31/32/33/34/35/36/37/38/43/44/45/46

"/> Why yes, JS ... we will if you will! Re. Old Fostoria Glassware, then ...
what can you tell me about a stemware pattern attributed to George Sakier, who
supposedly assigned the patent to Fostoria in 1934. The stems were sold under
the name &quot;Carlton Cocktail Glasses&quot;, catalog #90130, in the specialties line
of housewares by the Chase Brass &amp; Copper Company during the late
thirties-early forties. The stems were 4&quot; high and 2.75&quot; wide at the brim;
the stem was vertically reeded and round in cross-section. Chase sold these
by themselves in sets of six or as components of a couple of different
complete cocktail sets. I have been trying to find a Fostoria expert who can
confirm the Chase-Sakier-Fostoria connection and give me a Fostoria pattern
number. Of course, it is possible these were done exclusively for Chase.
