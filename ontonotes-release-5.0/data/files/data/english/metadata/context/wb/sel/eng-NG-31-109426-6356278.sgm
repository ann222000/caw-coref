Are You Willing To Wait For God To Exalt You?

Job 36:22 tells us - "Behold, God exalteth by His power..."
1 Peter 5:6 informs us that God has a proper time - a "due time"  - when
He exalts the humble.
So many are running ahead of God's "best"  time and exalting themselves.
Hence, they are not properly prepared and oftentimes end up falling flat
on their faces.
What will it be for you?
Are you in a hurry to be in the "limelight" ? Or will you wait for God's
fit time to promote you?

In Job 7:17, Job inquired - "What is man, that Thou shouldest magnify
him?..." We learn from his question that it is God Who "magnifies" -
raises a man or woman to honor or dignity - or makes him great.

In Job 36:22, Elihu made the bold statement - "Behold, God exalteth by
His power..." He is the One Who may, can, and does set up or pull down
whom He pleases by His unlimited power.

In 1 Peter 5:6, the Apostle Peter implied who the only candidates were
for this exaltation when he exhorted the believers to - "Humble
yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you
in due time."  Only those who submit patiently and quietly to God's will
for their lives experience a season of visitation when He personally
raises them up.

To those who are willing to "humble themselves under the mighty hand of
God" - He deals kindly with them. He displays His grace,  goodness, help,
and favor to them. They make themselves little in His sight, and He - in
turn -  makes Himself little to them through His condescension. Out of
this condescension comes - "greatness" - or exaltation - "...thy
gentleness hath made me great."  (Psalm 18:35).

There were two men in the Bible who experienced exaltation by "the mighty
hand of God." They were Joshua and Solomon.

Joshua 3:7 relates of Joshua - "And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day
will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may
know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee."
Joshua 4:14 also says - "On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the
sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the
days of his life."

Notice first of all that the One Who was raising Joshua up in Moses'
stead was the Lord.

"This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel..."
"On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel..."

Another note of importance is that when the Lord did magnify Joshua,
everyone in Israel knew it. Just like Moses, he was endued with
supernatural might, great understanding, and the token of God's presence
in his midst. His authority from God was confirmed when he foretold how
the waters would be cut off as soon as the feet of the priests touched
them(Joshua 3:13). When it happened just as he said, he proved to all
that God was working in and through him.

In addition, 1 Chronicles 29:25 relates of Solomon - "And the LORD
magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed
upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in
Israel."
2 Chronicles 1:1 also says - "And Solomon the son of David was
strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and
magnified him exceedingly."

It was Solomon's God Who "magnified" him by giving him such a large
measure of wisdom and understanding...putting honor upon him so that the
whole nation marvelled at how famous he was...making him very great and
extremely powerful...giving His blessing to all that he did... and giving
him the glory of the Kingdom - wealth, riches, honor, and reverence -
like none before or after him.

Look what happens when God "magnifies" individuals - when men wait for
the fit time to be exalted by Him.

"Behold, God exalteth by His power..."

Like Joshua and Solomon, will you wait for God's "due time" to exalt you?

When He does, you will not have to tell a soul. Everyone will know it.

May God Bless His Word.
