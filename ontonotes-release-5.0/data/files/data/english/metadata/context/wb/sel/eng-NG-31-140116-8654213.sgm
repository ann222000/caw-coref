Sept. 30, 2001

(CBS) Two dozen members of Osama bin Laden's family were urgently evacuated from the United States in the _first days_ following the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, according to the Saudi ambassador to Washington.

One of bin Laden's brothers frantically called the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Washington looking for protection, Prince Bandar bin Sultan told The New York Times. The brother was sent to a room in the Watergate Hotel and was told not to open the door.

Most of bin Laden's relatives were attending high school and college. The young members of the bin Laden family were driven or flown under FBI supervision to a secret place in Texas and then to Washington, The Times reported Sunday.

Many were terrified, fearing they would be lynched after hearing reports of violence against Muslims and Arab-Americans.

They left the country on a private charter plane when airports reopened three days after the attacks.

King Fahd, the ailing Saudi ruler, sent an urgent message to his embassy in Washington pointing out that there were &quot;bin Laden children all over America&quot; and ordered, &quot;Take measures to protect the innocents,&quot; the ambassador said.

It's a tragedy,&quot; Prince Bandar told the Times. &quot;The elders&quot; of the students &quot;came to see me, and one of them was a bright boy from Harvard who like the others had absolutely nothing to do with this and yet we had to tell him to go home and wait until the emotions calmed down. And he told me that he never really appreciated why the Japanese wanted a memorial or an apology for their treatment in World War II.

The student added, according to the prince, &quot;I understand now that when you are innocent, in the face of emotion, nothing, not even common sense, can help argue your case.&quot;

Osama bin Laden is one of more than 50 children of a Yemeni-born migrant who made a vast fortune building roads and palaces in Saudi Arabia and his extended family spans the globe. Many have been educated in the United States and the family has donated millions of dollars to several American universities.

Bin Laden is estranged from his family and from Saudi Arabia, which revoked his citizenship in the early 1990s after he was caught smuggling weapons from Yemen.

Which of your rights have suffered? I'll answer..... none of them so

Curiously, I have not heard of ONE American who has claimed that their
rights were taken away or abused since 9/11!!!

One would think that with all this talk of abuses of rights the
Liberal media could drum out at least ONE American in the last 6 years
to claim abuse!!!!

They haven't because the rights of Americans have NOT been abused. The
rights of terrorists  have!!!

Yet people like Dano and Ray O'Hara (son of atheist Maureen O'Hara)
claim that it is true so it must be!!!

And John Edwards charges $50,000 for every speech about poverty.

They were trespassing. They had no right to be there.

If I have a private rally for all my friends (I have eleventy
kajillion) I deserve the right to ban fucktards.

The suit was settled because the settlement would cost less than the
lawyer fees.

Is this the ONLY thing you can find of rights being trampled????

Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) was in the final minutes of an
energy speech today - billed as her second major policy address of the
year - when she called on Americans to take seriously the burgeoning
energy crisis facing the country.

&quot;Sen. Clinton please you haven't mentioned the war.&quot; one woman asked.
&quot;You haven't mentioned the war in Iraq.&quot;

As a handful of Secret Service agents and others rushed to remove the
female, another said: &quot;Please don't fuel the war.&quot;

The protestors were quickly removed - one woman squirmed and fought so
long that an innocent bystander was knocked out of her chair - and the
senator concluded the speech without acknowledging the disturbance.

Hitlery will NOT stand opposing thought!!!

No they aren't.  You are forgetting the intelligence factor.  They have

At least this article refutes the left's favorite lie:  That they were

The FBI interviewed them and they were allowed to leave.  The liberals

Well, since you can't get your head around the fact that laws and rights
exist for everyone, I'm not surprised you would look at it that way.  The
right wing and Republicans will not always be in power.  So when the
bastards on either extreme (right or left) use the same powers you're so
willing to allow them, they'll be able to use them against you too.  Have
you heard of Directive 51?  I suggest you do a Google search and see exactly
what your fearless leader has in mind.

Probably just ignorance, I don't see what they could do with it.  Work out a

know people who use them and they have those pay by the minute phones to
contact people, same with gamblers I know.  If someone has something to hide
they should just be smart enough to use them.  The potential gain outweighs
the risk of hurting a criminal or asshole.  Keep in mind, they don't care

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When anyone's rights are taken away, EVERYONE'S are.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; No they aren't.  You are forgetting the intelligence factor.  They have
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; people who know what and who to look for.  They aren't doing random call
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; screenings...  If you are worried about the rights of people with links
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (no matter how thin it is) to terrorist groups or criminal activities
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; then I can't change your mind but if someone isn't doing anything they
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; don't have to worry.  Trust me, it would piss me off (for about six
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; seconds) if I found out the government was listening to my calls but I'm
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not fucking insane enough to believe they ever would and even if they
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; did, they'd be bored and at least I'd know security is still on their
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; mind.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Intelligence?  You mean like that which was tailored, misused and abused
&gt; &gt;&gt; to make a case for this disgraceful, fucked up war we can't find a way
&gt; &gt;&gt; out of? Those are the LAST people I wish to trust right now.  I now we
&gt; &gt;&gt; need good intelligence, but like anything it can be misused in the wrong
&gt; &gt;&gt; hands...like for political purposes.  That's why *domestic* intelligence
&gt; &gt;&gt; MUST be carefully considered.

&gt; &gt; Distrust in the intelligence community as a whole is understandable but
&gt; &gt; there are a lot of intelligence success stories also.  Don't look at it as
&gt; &gt; a community, look at it as one guy or girl doing their job, one that
&gt; &gt; includes a healthy dose of drive to succeed (these are A types) and also a
&gt; &gt; desparate need to keep this country safe.  Pulling numbers out of my ass,
&gt; &gt; of a thousand taps, if 998 are legit and 50 lead to valuable info isn't it
&gt; &gt; worth it to have a couple of folks lose a bit of privacy?  As said earlier
&gt; &gt; that I'd be pissed off but really, if they heard me placing a $25 bet with
&gt; &gt; a buddy or talking about some hot piece of ass I saw while out with my
&gt; &gt; wife would I have to worry about them ratting me out or busting me?
&gt; &gt; Besides, isn't there a bit of question as to whether or not these taps
&gt; &gt; were really illegal?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They just haven't gotten to you yet.  Moron's like you can't grasp that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;notion.  You would be pitiable were your stupidity not so harmful to the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rest of us.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I won't suggest you are a moron for having an opposing thought but you
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; do sound awfully paranoid.  Do you think any of this will stop if one of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; your boys, IE Hillary or Obama, is elected?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks...I guess...but just because one is paranoid doesn't mean someone
&gt; &gt;&gt; isn't out to get them.

&gt; &gt; It wasn't a knock but really, if you think HLS, be it FBI or CIA, is in
&gt; &gt; any form is out to get you, change your ways.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Healthy distrust of those in power is a necessary component of a free
&gt; &gt;&gt; society.  Why are you so sure that people won't take advantage of such
&gt; &gt;&gt; powers to enhance their political strength?

No. On the contrary. They can also be tapped you just need to know the
number, but if you have the number they are calling/being called you
can still gather useful information you might otherwise miss. Of
course the number could be changed quickly which makes the quickness
in tapping all the more urgent if you do need to tap it. If you try to
obtain a warrant they'll have a new phone by then. Of course the point
gets lost that some ungodly amount of numbers tapped under the
warrantless tap program were from outside the US.

Scenario:

A phone number in Pakistan is known to have AL Queda ties.
Throw away cell phone in Atlanta calls this three times in a week.
They throw away the number after 1 week.

You can quickly tap that phone after the first call for the remaining
portion of the day/week and maybe get information on how new phones
are obtained/who is obtaining or using  them/what they are doing.
Granted they might switch phones but the ability to hear the
conversation prior to this could provide intel that would save you and
your family. But then again they could also listen to your phone sex
too so we better ban it right?

Oh no we get it believe that. One you couldn't give two shits about
national security, you hate Bush and everything he does is wrong, you
feel closer and share more with the terrorists that want to kill us
all than to fellow citizens of your own country ( they hate illegal
wiretaps too DAMNIT). I think we get it just fine.

&gt;&gt; what's the use...

&gt; Oh no we get it believe that. One you couldn't give two shits about
&gt; national security, you hate Bush and everything he does is wrong, you
&gt; feel closer and share more with the terrorists that want to kill us
&gt; all than to fellow citizens of your own country ( they hate illegal
&gt; wiretaps too DAMNIT). I think we get it just fine.

Yeah...that's right...you are too thick witted to see the world in anything
but black &amp; white...no shades of gray, let alone color.  Whatever.

People like Dano actually hate George Bush more than they hate al Qaeda and
bin Laden.  They celebrate terrorist successes because it justifies their
continuing hatred of Bush.  They want to make it as difficult as possible
for the government to protect us, and then if something goes horribly wrong
and terrorists strike again, they want to criticize the same government for
not doing their job.

I agree. I just wonder when the Democrats do take the Whitehouse as I
expect they will if his/their rhetoric about wiretaps (which will
continue out of friggen neccesity) and Iraq (everything will instantly
be a success, we'll start to see the soldiers giving out candy
pictures again), and how instantly the world loves and respects us
again (while they plot the next 9/11) will continue.
