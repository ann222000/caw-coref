Do they still sell the Nintendo DS? Or is it just the DS lite version
that is out???

Any difference other than size?

Shipping for my kid for XMAS.

Thanks
Patty

I still see them but it's getting hard to find now.  I guess Nintendo
isn't making them anymore or the local stores are only carrying the
Lite version.

Better battery life I believe but nothing else.  If you're going to
get the accessories, make sure the case, sleeves, or skins will fit
whichever DS you get.  Or better yet, let the kids pick the
accessories later.

The DS screen is 100% better than the original DS. It has four brightness
settings &amp; the colors are bright &amp; vivid instead of dark &amp; murky on the old
DS. It does have better battery life depending on which of the four
brightness settings you use. Your kid would definitely want the lite as
it's what's "in &amp; cool" currently &amp; more importantly it's a well designed
device on top of looking good.

&gt; Might be worth you trying them if you can, I tried a lite and it was a
&gt; bit too cramped for me compared to the regular DS.

&gt; I kept my regular rather than upgrade to a lite

Good idea, I'm an adult male &amp; I find the lite to be perfectly comfortable
but it's still good to check in case.

Doesn't the Lite version have a bigger stylus?  That's reason enough
for me to go Lite instead of regular.  Or maybe it's just a normal
length stylus and the regular is just super small.  I found it very
annoying personally.

Yes the lite stylus is bigger than the old DS one.
