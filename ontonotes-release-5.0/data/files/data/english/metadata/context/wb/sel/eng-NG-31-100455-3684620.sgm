The FBI and domestic spying: Reason to be wary

By Dan K. Thomasson
Scripps Howard News Service
29-DEC-05

http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&amp;pk=THOMASSON-12-2...

WASHINGTON - The FBI, it seems, has been keeping an eye on any
number of domestic organizations that appear to have little to do
with its stepped up counterintelligence assignment _ shades of
Cointelpro, "Commie" hunting, black-bag jobs, and a variety of other
notorious activities from the '50s, '60s, and '70s that made the
bureau the scourge of any protester who might disagree with
prevailing government policy in a demonstrative fashion.

The difference, of course, is that the word "terrorism" has been
substituted for "communism" (at least in most cases) as the stated
reason for checking up on such groups as the People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (PETA), an admittedly pain-in-the-rear group who
would discourage us from such violent activity as milking cows. This
comes at a time when the bureau's reputation for ferreting out truly
dangerous folks who might be plotting another assault on America is
under attack from a half-dozen quarters, including Congress, where
former allies have been disillusioned by one failure after another.

The bureau reportedly has some 4,000 of its 11,000-plus agents now
assigned to seeking out domestic links to al Qaeda and other
terrorist networks. So why, it is proper to ask, is it concerned with
the antics of environmental extremists such as Greenpeace and
anti-war demonstrators? The bureau says that it has a duty to check
into any group that might be plotting some criminal activity. Fair
enough, but as violent as some of these groups and individuals get is
to climb a tree and refuse to come down or unfurl a banner where they
shouldn't.

Don't misunderstand, the '70s weren't all that benign and the FBI did
have legitimate concerns when it came to the violent student groups
such as the anarchic Weather Underground many of whose members were
extremely bright, if intellectually twisted, and who alluded capture
for years. Groups such as the Symbanese Liberation Army of Patty
Hearst infamy were actually just made up of sociopaths who
infiltrated the legitimate antiwar movement as an excuse for other
activities, including extortion and robbery.

For that reason, the FBI's current posture in surveillance of
seemingly nonthreatening organizations is not all bad. The danger
comes in wasting time and money and effort on groups that are
well-established with goals that have nothing to do with violent
terrorism. This policy merely engenders bad publicity, is
constitutionally questionable, and deters the bureau from the mission
of preventing another 9-11. In a town where nothing is a secret for
long, there is no hope of keeping such activity under wraps, nor
should there be. The bureau has struggled to overcome the "storm
trooper" image of the '70s and to install reforms that would preclude
the abuses from recurring.

Granted the terrorists are a threat unlike any the nation has ever
confronted, given their faceless nature. But there also are demands
to maintaining an open society. Balancing the need to protect that
openness from external threats while not adopting internal measures
that injure the freedoms that have made it so great is always
delicate. Sometimes the cost of liberty is high, but it is necessary
to pay it. Few of the nation's institutions should understand that
better than the FBI with its record of internal turmoil over the last
century.

Americans are increasingly sensitive about the "Big Brother"
intrusions into their everyday living. Few complain about the need
for stricter security nearly everywhere they go. But to be subjected
to warrantless wiretaps and official fishing expeditions and other
government spying on every aspect of their existence, including what
they read at the library, is becoming almost an intolerable burden.
That is especially true when it comes against a backdrop of decreased
privacy in every normal endeavor of modern life.

Cointelpro, the compiling of information about anyone who seemed to
disagree with what J. Edgar Hoover and his minions saw as the
American way, was a disgrace the bureau survived only by cleaning up
its act. The break ins and other activities, some clearly illegal and
others highly questionable, conducted by the FBI were career ending
for any number of dedicated FBI supervisors and agents, including
Mark Felt, who recently admitted to being the "Deep Throat" of
Watergate fact and fiction. Felt was convicted and subsequently
pardoned for his part in illegal activities in the name of national
security.

The last thing the FBI wants is a repeat of those activities. It can
only undermine what is needed to keep the true terrorists at bay. No
organization needs to be more diligent in monitoring itself to
prevent the excesses.

Agreed. Begin by treating all Muslims as terrorism suspects
because their religion and philosophy recommend terrorism
as a means of solving conflicts:

This was probably a good reason why the west oppossed India's Prevention of
Terrorism Act (POTA) was to be enacted by the Congress Party and then the
BJP and put alot of pressure on the GoI. When it comes to supporting
terrorism against India the west and the Islamic world are very good at it.
However, post 9/11 we see how the west has laws that challenge civil
liberties and there is hardly any opposition!

Shows the double standards that are in place.

But is it not the case that all religions that have their roots in the
Abrehamic religions have terrorised people? Just look at what the Christians
have done simple by looking at the map of the world and seeing the
destruction that these religions have bought the world over.

Like any other religion, Islam has many different interpretations.
There are plenty people who call themselves Muslims and don't
believe their religion and philosophy to be compatible with
Al-Qu'eada's actions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The FBI and domestic spying: Reason to be wary

&gt; &gt; &gt; By Dan K. Thomasson
&gt; &gt; &gt; Scripps Howard News Service
&gt; &gt; &gt; 29-DEC-05

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&amp;pk=THOMASSON-12-2...

&gt; &gt; &gt; WASHINGTON - The FBI, it seems, has been keeping an eye on any
&gt; &gt; &gt; number of domestic organizations that appear to have little to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; with its stepped up counterintelligence assignment _ shades of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cointelpro, &quot;Commie&quot; hunting, black-bag jobs, and a variety of other
&gt; &gt; &gt; notorious activities from the '50s, '60s, and '70s that made the
&gt; &gt; &gt; bureau the scourge of any protester who might disagree with
&gt; &gt; &gt; prevailing government policy in a demonstrative fashion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The difference, of course, is that the word &quot;terrorism&quot; has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; substituted for &quot;communism&quot; (at least in most cases) as the stated
&gt; &gt; &gt; reason for checking up on such groups as the People for the Ethical
&gt; &gt; &gt; Treatment of Animals (PETA), an admittedly pain-in-the-rear group who
&gt; &gt; &gt; would discourage us from such violent activity as milking cows. This
&gt; &gt; &gt; comes at a time when the bureau's reputation for ferreting out truly
&gt; &gt; &gt; dangerous folks who might be plotting another assault on America is
&gt; &gt; &gt; under attack from a half-dozen quarters, including Congress, where
&gt; &gt; &gt; former allies have been disillusioned by one failure after another.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The bureau reportedly has some 4,000 of its 11,000-plus agents now
&gt; &gt; &gt; assigned to seeking out domestic links to al Qaeda and other
&gt; &gt; &gt; terrorist networks. So why, it is proper to ask, is it concerned with
&gt; &gt; &gt; the antics of environmental extremists such as Greenpeace and
&gt; &gt; &gt; anti-war demonstrators? The bureau says that it has a duty to check
&gt; &gt; &gt; into any group that might be plotting some criminal activity. Fair
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough, but as violent as some of these groups and individuals get is
&gt; &gt; &gt; to climb a tree and refuse to come down or unfurl a banner where they
&gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't misunderstand, the '70s weren't all that benign and the FBI did
&gt; &gt; &gt; have legitimate concerns when it came to the violent student groups
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as the anarchic Weather Underground many of whose members were
&gt; &gt; &gt; extremely bright, if intellectually twisted, and who alluded capture
&gt; &gt; &gt; for years. Groups such as the Symbanese Liberation Army of Patty
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hearst infamy were actually just made up of sociopaths who
&gt; &gt; &gt; infiltrated the legitimate antiwar movement as an excuse for other
&gt; &gt; &gt; activities, including extortion and robbery.

&gt; &gt; &gt; For that reason, the FBI's current posture in surveillance of
&gt; &gt; &gt; seemingly nonthreatening organizations is not all bad. The danger
&gt; &gt; &gt; comes in wasting time and money and effort on groups that are
&gt; &gt; &gt; well-established with goals that have nothing to do with violent
&gt; &gt; &gt; terrorism. This policy merely engenders bad publicity, is
&gt; &gt; &gt; constitutionally questionable, and deters the bureau from the mission
&gt; &gt; &gt; of preventing another 9-11. In a town where nothing is a secret for
&gt; &gt; &gt; long, there is no hope of keeping such activity under wraps, nor
&gt; &gt; &gt; should there be. The bureau has struggled to overcome the &quot;storm
&gt; &gt; &gt; trooper&quot; image of the '70s and to install reforms that would preclude
&gt; &gt; &gt; the abuses from recurring.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Granted the terrorists are a threat unlike any the nation has ever
&gt; &gt; &gt; confronted, given their faceless nature. But there also are demands
&gt; &gt; &gt; to maintaining an open society. Balancing the need to protect that
&gt; &gt; &gt; openness from external threats while not adopting internal measures
&gt; &gt; &gt; that injure the freedoms that have made it so great is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; delicate. Sometimes the cost of liberty is high, but it is necessary
&gt; &gt; &gt; to pay it. Few of the nation's institutions should understand that
&gt; &gt; &gt; better than the FBI with its record of internal turmoil over the last
&gt; &gt; &gt; century.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Americans are increasingly sensitive about the &quot;Big Brother&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; intrusions into their everyday living. Few complain about the need
&gt; &gt; &gt; for stricter security nearly everywhere they go. But to be subjected
&gt; &gt; &gt; to warrantless wiretaps and official fishing expeditions and other
&gt; &gt; &gt; government spying on every aspect of their existence, including what
&gt; &gt; &gt; they read at the library, is becoming almost an intolerable burden.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is especially true when it comes against a backdrop of decreased
&gt; &gt; &gt; privacy in every normal endeavor of modern life.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Cointelpro, the compiling of information about anyone who seemed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; disagree with what J. Edgar Hoover and his minions saw as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; American way, was a disgrace the bureau survived only by cleaning up
&gt; &gt; &gt; its act. The break ins and other activities, some clearly illegal and
&gt; &gt; &gt; others highly questionable, conducted by the FBI were career ending
&gt; &gt; &gt; for any number of dedicated FBI supervisors and agents, including
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mark Felt, who recently admitted to being the &quot;Deep Throat&quot; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Watergate fact and fiction. Felt was convicted and subsequently
&gt; &gt; &gt; pardoned for his part in illegal activities in the name of national
&gt; &gt; &gt; security.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The last thing the FBI wants is a repeat of those activities. It can
&gt; &gt; &gt; only undermine what is needed to keep the true terrorists at bay. No
&gt; &gt; &gt; organization needs to be more diligent in monitoring itself to
&gt; &gt; &gt; prevent the excesses.

Yes, Christian terrorists are the worst -- especially
because they are a lot closer to nukes and other weapons
of mass destruction than are Muslim terrorists.

Caste

Verdict from Belgium

Last month, two ardent Hindus battled out the
controversial pros and cons of caste. This month's
assessment, from Europe, focuses on history and how jati
and varn have, for the most part, helped rather than
hurt Hinduism.

By Prof. Koenraad Elst
Hinduism Today
http://www.hinduismtoday.com
September 1994

In an inter-faith debate, most Hindus can easily be put
on the defensive with a single word -- caste. Any anti-
Hindu polemist can be counted on to allege that "the
typically Hindu caste system is the most cruel apartheid,
imposed by the barbaric white Aryan invaders on the
gentle dark-skinned natives." Here's a more balanced and
historical account of this controversial institution.

Merits of the Caste System

The caste system is often portrayed as the ultimate
horror. Inborn inequality is indeed unacceptable to us
moderns, but this does not preclude that the system has
also had its merits.

Caste is perceived as an "exclusion-from," but first of
all it is a form of "belonging-to," a natural structure
of solidarity. For this reason, Christian and Muslim
missionaries found it very difficult to lure Hindus away
from their communities. Sometimes castes were
collectively converted to Islam, and Pope Gregory XV
(1621-23) decreed that the missionaries could tolerate
caste distinction among Christian converts; but by and
large, caste remained an effective hurdle to the
destruction of Hinduism through conversion. That is why
the missionaries started attacking the institution of
caste and in particular the brahmin caste. This
propaganda has bloomed into a full-fledged anti-
brahminism, the Indian equivalent of anti-Semitism.

Every caste had a large measure of autonomy, with its own
judiciary, duties and privileges, and often its own
temples. Inter-caste affairs were settled at the village
council by consensus; even the lowest caste had veto
power. This autonomy of intermediate levels of society is
the antithesis of the totalitarian society in which the
individual stands helpless before the all-powerful state.
This decentralized structure of civil society and of the
Hindu religious commonwealth has been crucial to the
survival of Hinduism under Muslim rule. Whereas Buddhism
was swept away as soon as its monasteries were destroyed,
Hinduism retreated into its caste structure and weathered
the storm.

Caste also provided a framework for integrating immigrant
communities: Jews, Zoroastrians and Syrian Christians.
They were not only tolerated, but assisted in efforts to
preserve their distinctive traditions.

Typically Hindu?

It is routinely claimed that caste is a uniquely Hindu
institution. Yet, counter examples are not hard to come
by. In Europe and elsewhere, there was (or still is) a
hierarchical distinction between noblemen and commoners,
with nobility only marrying nobility. Many tribal
societies punished the breach of endogamy rules with
death.

Coming to the Indian tribes, we find Christian
missionaries claiming that "tribals are not Hindus
because they do not observe caste." In reality,
missionary literature itself is rife with testimonies of
caste practices among tribals. A spectacular example is
what the missions call "the Mistake:" the attempt, in
1891, to make tribal converts in Chhotanagpur inter-dine
with converts from other tribes. It was a disaster for
the mission. Most tribals renounced Christianity because
they chose to preserve the taboo on inter-dining. As
strongly as the haughtiest brahmin, they refused to mix
what God hath separated.

Endogamy and exogamy are observed by tribal societies the
world over. The question is therefore not why Hindu
society invented this system, but how it could preserve
these tribal identities even after outgrowing the tribal
stage of civilization. The answer lies largely in the
expanding Vedic culture's intrinsically respectful and
conservative spirit, which ensured that each tribe could
preserve its customs and traditions, including its
defining custom of tribal endogamy.

Description and History

The Portuguese colonizers applied the term caste,
"lineage, breed," to two different Hindu institutions:
jati and varn. The effective unit of the caste system is
the jati, birth-unit, an endogamous group into which you
are born, and within which you marry. In principle, you
can only dine with fellow members, but the pressures of
modern life have eroded this rule. The several thousands
of jatis are subdivided in exogamous clans, gotr. This
double division dates back to tribal society.

By contrast, varn is the typical functional division of
an advanced society -- the Indus/Saraswati civilization,
3rd millennium, BCE. The youngest part of the Rg-Ved
describes four classes: learned brahmins born from
Brahma's mouth, martial kshatriya-born from his arms;
vaishya entrepreneurs born from His hips and shoodr
workers born from His feet. Everyone is a shoodr by
birth. Boys become dwij, twice-born, or member of one of
the three upper varns upon receiving the sacred thread in
the upanayan ceremony.

The varn system expanded from the Saraswati-Yamuna area
and got firmly established in the whole of Aryavart
(Kashmir to Vidarbha, Sindh to Bihar). It counted as a
sign of superior culture setting the arya, civilized,
heartland apart from the surrounding mlechh, barbaric,
lands. In Bengal and the South, the system was reduced to
a distinction between brahmins and shudras. Varn is a
ritual category and does not fully correspond to
effective social or economic status. Thus, half of the
princely rulers in British India were shoodr and a few
were brahmins, though it is the kshatriya function par
excellence. Many shoodr are rich, many brahmins
impoverished.

The Mahabharat defines the varn qualities thus: "He in
whom you find truthfulness, generosity, absence of
hatred, modesty, goodness and self-restraint, is a
brahman. He who fulfills the duties of a knight, studies
the scriptures, concentrates on acquisition and
distribution of riches, is a kshatriya. He who loves
cattle-breeding, agriculture and money, is honest and
well-versed in scripture, is a vaishya. He who eats
anything, practises any profession, ignores purity rules,
and takes no interest in scriptures and rules of life, is
a shoodr." The higher the varn, the more rules of self-
discipline are to be observed. Hence, a jati could
collectively improve its status by adopting more
demanding rules of conduct, e.g. vegetarianism.

A person's second name usually indicates his jati or
gotra. Further, one can use the following varn titles:
Sharma (shelter, or joy) indicates the brahmin, Varma
(armour) the kshatriya, Gupta (protected) the vaishya and
Das (servant) the shoodr. In a single family, one person
may call himself Gupta (varn), another Agrawal (jati),
yet another Garg (gotra). A monk, upon renouncing the
world, sheds his name along with his caste identity.

Untouchability

Below the caste hierarchy are the untouchables, or
harijan (literally "God's people"), dalits ("oppressed"),
paraiah (one such caste in South India), or scheduled
castes. They make up about 16% of the Indian population,
as many as the upper castes combined.

Untouchability originates in the belief that evil spirits
surround dead and dying substances. People who work with
corpses, body excretions or animal skins had an aura of
danger and impurity, so they were kept away from
mainstream society and from sacred learning and ritual.
This often took grotesque forms: thus, an untouchable had
to announce his polluting proximity with a rattle, like a
leper.

Untouchability is unknown in the Vedas, and therefore
repudiated by neo-Vedic reformers like Dayanand
Saraswati, Narayan Guru, Gandhiji and Savarkar. In 1967,
Dr. Ambedkar, a dalit by birth and fierce critic of
social injustice in Hinduism and Islam, led a mass
conversion to Buddhism, partly on the (unhistorical)
assumption that Buddhism had been an anti-caste movement.
The 1950 constitution outlawed untouchability and
sanctioned positive discrimination programs for the
Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Lately, the Vishva Hindu
Parishad has managed to get even the most traditionalist
religious leaders on the anti-untouchability platform, so
that they invite harijans to Vedic schools and train them
as priests. In the villages, however, pestering of dalits
is still a regular phenomenon, occasioned less by ritual
purity issues than by land and labor disputes. However,
the dalits' increasing political clout is accelerating
the elimination of untouchability.

Caste Conversion

In the Mahabharat, Yuddhishtthir affirms that varn is
defined by the qualities of head and heart, not by one's
birth. Krishna teaches that varn is defined by one's
activity (karm) and quality (guna). Till today, it is an
unfinished debate to what extent one's "quality" is
determined by heredity or by environmental influence. And
so, while the hereditary view has been predominant for
long, the non-hereditary conception of varn has always
been around as well, as is clear from the practice of
varn conversion. The most famous example is the 17th-
century freedom fighter Shivaji, a shoodr who was
accorded kshatriya status to match his military
achievements. The geographical spread of Vedic tradition
was achieved through large-scale initiation of local
elites into the varn order. From 1875

recently, a non-commercial consignment from India was seized by customs
because it contained a small quantity of Jira(cooking spices) and Henna
among other domestic-use things - Interestingly, the prevention of
terrorism (spread of bio terrorism) clause was applied to sieze the
parcel. In the name of terrorism, these guys are running riots.

&gt; The FBI and domestic spying: Reason to be wary

&gt; By Dan K. Thomasson
&gt; Scripps Howard News Service
&gt; 29-DEC-05

&gt; http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&amp;pk=THOMASSON-12-2...

&gt; WASHINGTON - The FBI, it seems, has been keeping an eye on any
&gt; number of domestic organizations that appear to have little to do
&gt; with its stepped up counterintelligence assignment _ shades of
&gt; Cointelpro, &quot;Commie&quot; hunting, black-bag jobs, and a variety of other
&gt; notorious activities from the '50s, '60s, and '70s that made the
&gt; bureau the scourge of any protester who might disagree with
&gt; prevailing government policy in a demonstrative fashion.

&gt; The difference, of course, is that the word &quot;terrorism&quot; has been
&gt; substituted for &quot;communism&quot; (at least in most cases) as the stated
&gt; reason for checking up on such groups as the People for the Ethical
&gt; Treatment of Animals (PETA), an admittedly pain-in-the-rear group who
&gt; would discourage us from such violent activity as milking cows. This
&gt; comes at a time when the bureau's reputation for ferreting out truly
&gt; dangerous folks who might be plotting another assault on America is
&gt; under attack from a half-dozen quarters, including Congress, where
&gt; former allies have been disillusioned by one failure after another.

&gt; The bureau reportedly has some 4,000 of its 11,000-plus agents now
&gt; assigned to seeking out domestic links to al Qaeda and other
&gt; terrorist networks. So why, it is proper to ask, is it concerned with
&gt; the antics of environmental extremists such as Greenpeace and
&gt; anti-war demonstrators? The bureau says that it has a duty to check
&gt; into any group that might be plotting some criminal activity. Fair
&gt; enough, but as violent as some of these groups and individuals get is
&gt; to climb a tree and refuse to come down or unfurl a banner where they
&gt; shouldn't.

&gt; Don't misunderstand, the '70s weren't all that benign and the FBI did
&gt; have legitimate concerns when it came to the violent student groups
&gt; such as the anarchic Weather Underground many of whose members were
&gt; extremely bright, if intellectually twisted, and who alluded capture
&gt; for years. Groups such as the Symbanese Liberation Army of Patty
&gt; Hearst infamy were actually just made up of sociopaths who
&gt; infiltrated the legitimate antiwar movement as an excuse for other
&gt; activities, including extortion and robbery.

&gt; For that reason, the FBI's current posture in surveillance of
&gt; seemingly nonthreatening organizations is not all bad. The danger
&gt; comes in wasting time and money and effort on groups that are
&gt; well-established with goals that have nothing to do with violent
&gt; terrorism. This policy merely engenders bad publicity, is
&gt; constitutionally questionable, and deters the bureau from the mission
&gt; of preventing another 9-11. In a town where nothing is a secret for
&gt; long, there is no hope of keeping such activity under wraps, nor
&gt; should there be. The bureau has struggled to overcome the &quot;storm
&gt; trooper&quot; image of the '70s and to install reforms that would preclude
&gt; the abuses from recurring.

&gt; Granted the terrorists are a threat unlike any the nation has ever
&gt; confronted, given their faceless nature. But there also are demands
&gt; to maintaining an open society. Balancing the need to protect that
&gt; openness from external threats while not adopting internal measures
&gt; that injure the freedoms that have made it so great is always
&gt; delicate. Sometimes the cost of liberty is high, but it is necessary
&gt; to pay it. Few of the nation's institutions should understand that
&gt; better than the FBI with its record of internal turmoil over the last
&gt; century.

&gt; Americans are increasingly sensitive about the &quot;Big Brother&quot;
&gt; intrusions into their everyday living. Few complain about the need
&gt; for stricter security nearly everywhere they go. But to be subjected
&gt; to warrantless wiretaps and official fishing expeditions and other
&gt; government spying on every aspect of their existence, including what
&gt; they read at the library, is becoming almost an intolerable burden.
&gt; That is especially true when it comes against a backdrop of decreased
&gt; privacy in every normal endeavor of modern life.

&gt; Cointelpro, the compiling of information about anyone who seemed to
&gt; disagree with what J. Edgar Hoover and his minions saw as the
&gt; American way, was a disgrace the bureau survived only by cleaning up
&gt; its act. The break ins and other activities, some clearly illegal and
&gt; others highly questionable, conducted by the FBI were career ending
&gt; for any number of dedicated FBI supervisors and agents, including
&gt; Mark Felt, who recently admitted to being the &quot;Deep Throat&quot; of
&gt; Watergate fact and fiction. Felt was convicted and subsequently
&gt; pardoned for his part in illegal activities in the name of national
&gt; security.

&gt; The last thing the FBI wants is a repeat of those activities. It can
&gt; only undermine what is needed to keep the true terrorists at bay. No
&gt; organization needs to be more diligent in monitoring itself to
&gt; prevent the excesses.

Taliban had the support of its people too. So did Saddam. That never
stopped USA from attacking them. People who live in Iraq and Afganistan
meant no harm to USA - yet entire nations were classified as terrorist
and genocidal war imposed upon them and thousands of innocent had to
die at american hands  - more innocent people died at american hands in
its response to 9/11 than died during 9/11. If loss of few thousand
innocents in 9/11 caused so much moral outrage that Americans are
willing to condone killing of hundred times more innocents in the name
of fighting terrorism - for the actions of few terrorists, entire
nations can be bombed and subjected to mass destruction without remorse
- in the name of fighting terrorism, whole citizonery can be  subjected
to spying and survellience - than it is a great moral flow of America -
and if american people are not willing to correct it, rest of the world
will have to. If US citizenery can't come to senses on their own, the
dumb citizonery need to be brought back to senses by outsiders. Sorry,
it is no longer your internal matter when your bombs fall on innocents
of other nations. It becomes rest of the world's business because your
phantom war on terrorism is targetting americans and non-americans
alike in an immoral and indiscreet manner.

In our country, we let those who don't want to confirm to society or

&gt; Merits of the Caste System

&gt; Caste also provided a framework for integrating immigrant
&gt; communities: Jews, Zoroastrians and Syrian Christians.
">

Did Varna provide such a framework? Jati did, and jati didn't come from
Aryavarta, so can framers of varna be credited with providing such a
framework? How was varna useful, in any way, to these communities?

No.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Description and History

&gt; The Portuguese colonizers applied the term caste,
&gt; &quot;lineage, breed,&quot; to two different Hindu institutions:
&gt; jati and varn. The effective unit of the caste system is
&gt; the jati, birth-unit, an endogamous group into which you
&gt; are born, and within which you marry. In principle, you
&gt; can only dine with fellow members, but the pressures of
&gt; modern life have eroded this rule.
">

There is no such rule in jatis. Find yourself a hill tribe and see
whether its members will get branded for sharing their food with you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The several thousands
&gt; of jatis are subdivided in exogamous clans, gotr. This
&gt; double division dates back to tribal society.
">

Back to tribal society, eh? Find yourself a hill tribe and ask what
their gotr is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; By contrast, varn is the typical functional division of
&gt; an advanced society
">

Indeed? What are the varnas in Japan?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The varn system expanded from the Saraswati-Yamuna area
&gt; and got firmly established in the whole of Aryavart
&gt; (Kashmir to Vidarbha, Sindh to Bihar). It counted as a
&gt; sign of superior culture setting the arya, civilized,
&gt; heartland apart from the surrounding mlechh, barbaric,
&gt; lands.
">

Apartheid in South Africa counted as a sign of superior culture too:-&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In Bengal and the South, the system was reduced to
&gt; a distinction between brahmins and shudras. Varn is a
&gt; ritual category and does not fully correspond to
&gt; effective social or economic status.
">

It does not. Did it always not correspond to socioeconomic status? Name
some high socioeconomic status S'udras mentioned in the upanishads.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Mahabharat defines the varn qualities thus: &quot;He in
&gt; whom you find truthfulness, generosity, absence of
&gt; hatred, modesty, goodness and self-restraint, is a
&gt; brahman. He who fulfills the duties of a knight, studies
&gt; the scriptures, concentrates on acquisition and
&gt; distribution of riches, is a kshatriya. He who loves
&gt; cattle-breeding, agriculture and money, is honest and
&gt; well-versed in scripture, is a vaishya. He who eats
&gt; anything, practises any profession, ignores purity rules,
&gt; and takes no interest in scriptures and rules of life, is
&gt; a shoodr.&quot; The higher the varn, the more rules of self-
&gt; discipline are to be observed. Hence, a jati could
&gt; collectively improve its status by adopting more
&gt; demanding rules of conduct, e.g. vegetarianism.
">

According to the Mahabharata, what is the varna of one in whom one
finds truthfulness, generosity, absence of hatred, modesty, goodness
and self-restraint, practises any profession he finds interesting,
ignores purity rules he finds silly and takes no interest in
scriptures?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A person's second name usually indicates his jati or
&gt; gotra. Further, one can use the following varn titles:
&gt; Sharma (shelter, or joy) indicates the brahmin, Varma
&gt; (armour) the kshatriya, Gupta (protected) the vaishya and
&gt; Das (servant) the shoodr. In a single family, one person
&gt; may call himself Gupta (varn), another Agrawal (jati),
&gt; yet another Garg (gotra). A monk, upon renouncing the
&gt; world, sheds his name along with his caste identity.
">

Once he sheds his caste identity, is he back to being a S'udra like
when he was born?

&gt; Racial Theory of Caste

&gt; Nineteenth-century Westerners projected the colonial

&gt; over the black natives. This outdated view is still
&gt; repeated ad-nauseam by anti-Hindu authors: now that
&gt; &quot;idolatry&quot; has lost its force as a term of abuse,
&gt; &quot;racism&quot; is a welcome innovation to demonize Hinduism. In
&gt; reality, India is the region where all skin color types

&gt; &gt; Merits of the Caste System

&gt; &gt; Caste also provided a framework for integrating immigrant
&gt; &gt; communities: Jews, Zoroastrians and Syrian Christians.

&gt; Did Varna provide such a framework? Jati did, and jati didn't come from
&gt; Aryavarta, so can framers of varna be credited with providing such a
&gt; framework? How was varna useful, in any way, to these communities?
">

Varna provides broad classifications and within each classification,
more specializations had to occue which could have evolved into Jati.
Just as doctor is a general classification within which different
specialities has evolved - so we now have cadiologists and radiologists
and gynacologists etc.

As deviation from the norms would occur over time, as new immigrants
arrived, as more specializations occured over time, the varna system
had to integrate them - that would explain emergence of jatis. Thus
verna had to be loose and broad classification - to provide elasticity
to society to absorb chages over time.

Verna and Jatis allowed space and freedom to group aspirations and
immigrants, accmodated social, cultural and religious differentiations
- usually diversity in social, cultural and religious sphere becomes
the greatest source of conflicts and disharmony - In case of India,
they found a accomodating framework in verna and jatis.

&gt; &gt; Typically Hindu?

&gt; No.

&gt; &gt; Description and History

&gt; &gt; The Portuguese colonizers applied the term caste,
&gt; &gt; &quot;lineage, breed,&quot; to two different Hindu institutions:
&gt; &gt; jati and varn. The effective unit of the caste system is
&gt; &gt; the jati, birth-unit, an endogamous group into which you
&gt; &gt; are born, and within which you marry. In principle, you
&gt; &gt; can only dine with fellow members, but the pressures of
&gt; &gt; modern life have eroded this rule.

&gt; There is no such rule in jatis. Find yourself a hill tribe and see
&gt; whether its members will get branded for sharing their food with you.
">

The tribals had the same rules like all others - they rarely mingled
with other tribes - socially or culturally. They remained endogomus and
strictly confined themselves to their own tribe. Even in modern times
when most other jatis have integrated to some sort of integrated modern
culture, tribals refuse to integrate into any mainstream - they
fiercely cling to their tribal ways.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The several thousands
&gt; &gt; of jatis are subdivided in exogamous clans, gotr. This
&gt; &gt; double division dates back to tribal society.

&gt; Back to tribal society, eh? Find yourself a hill tribe and ask what
&gt; their gotr is.
">

Tribals have remained endogomous till date - they refuse to evolve.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; By contrast, varn is the typical functional division of
&gt; &gt; an advanced society

&gt; Indeed? What are the varnas in Japan?
">

Japan was never part of Aryavrat. Advanced societies outside Aryavrat
may not have explicit varna system, but they must have those Verna
functionality carried out within their societies - they must have large
enough intellectual class, warrier class, business class and working
people functioning in harmony and integrated manner in order to become
advanced.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The varn system expanded from the Saraswati-Yamuna area
&gt; &gt; and got firmly established in the whole of Aryavart
&gt; &gt; (Kashmir to Vidarbha, Sindh to Bihar). It counted as a
&gt; &gt; sign of superior culture setting the arya, civilized,
&gt; &gt; heartland apart from the surrounding mlechh, barbaric,
&gt; &gt; lands.

&gt; Apartheid in South Africa counted as a sign of superior culture too:-&gt;
">

South Africa had an advanced culture compared to communities
surrounding them and south africans had every right to be proud of
their cultural achievements and they were well within rights to
maintain their cultural autonomy and reject integration with other
cultural groups surrounding them. It would have been perfectly alright
if south african culture had existed in europe or some white country -
what made south african policies demonized as apartheid was that south
africa existed within africa - that made it an imperialist project with
racist and supermacist connotations. It became a case of - they came,
they saw, they settled, they defeated and displaced the natives and now
don't want to deal with the natives. South africans seem to want to do
what other white racists did to America - wipe out natives and occupy
their land and confine the natives to concentration camps. Hindus never
carried out such imperialism. It was their verna system that would make
them such pluralistic and integrating force.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; In Bengal and the South, the system was reduced to
&gt; &gt; a distinction between brahmins and shudras. Varn is a
&gt; &gt; ritual category and does not fully correspond to
&gt; &gt; effective social or economic status.

&gt; It does not. Did it always not correspond to socioeconomic status? Name
&gt; some high socioeconomic status S'udras mentioned in the upanishads.
">

Some sudras ended up writing scriptures - valmiki, Vyas and Tulsidas,
to name a few. HIndu scriptures are not fixated on socio-economic
status of any verna. All verna has to be equally important for society
to advance.

&gt; &gt; The Mahabharat defines the varn qualities thus: &quot;He in
&gt; &gt; whom you find truthfulness, generosity, absence of
&gt; &gt; hatred, modesty, goodness and self-restraint, is a
&gt; &gt; brahman. He who fulfills the duties of a knight, studies
&gt; &gt; the scriptures, concentrates on acquisition and
&gt; &gt; distribution of riches, is a kshatriya. He who loves
&gt; &gt; cattle-breeding, agriculture and money, is honest and
&gt; &gt; well-versed in scripture, is a vaishya. He who eats
&gt; &gt; anything, practises any profession, ignores purity rules,
&gt; &gt; and takes no interest in scriptures and rules of life, is
&gt; &gt; a shoodr.&quot; The higher the varn, the more rules of self-
&gt; &gt; discipline are to be observed. Hence, a jati could
&gt; &gt; collectively improve its status by adopting more
&gt; &gt; demanding rules of conduct, e.g. vegetarianism.

&gt; According to the Mahabharata, what is the varna of one in whom one
&gt; finds truthfulness, generosity, absence of hatred, modesty, goodness
&gt; and self-restraint, practises any profession he finds interesting,
&gt; ignores purity rules he finds silly and takes no interest in
&gt; scriptures?
">

That is highly hypothetical question. One can never be truthful,
without hate, modest, good and self-restraint in a proper sense if one
takes no interest in scriptures and ignores rule of purity. Anarchy and
behaviour of lowest common denominator is always a sign of moral
breakdown and not moral advancement.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; A person's second name usually indicates his jati or
&gt; &gt; gotra. Further, one can use the following varn titles:
&gt; &gt; Sharma (shelter, or joy) indicates the brahmin, Varma
&gt; &gt; (armour) the kshatriya, Gupta (protected) the vaishya and
&gt; &gt; Das (servant) the shoodr. In a single family, one person
&gt; &gt; may call himself Gupta (varn), another Agrawal (jati),
&gt; &gt; yet another Garg (gotra). A monk, upon renouncing the
&gt; &gt; world, sheds his name along with his caste identity.

&gt; Once he sheds his caste identity, is he back to being a S'udra like
&gt; when he was born?
">

If one seeks to transend Samaj and seek to move on to higher spiritual
or jan-kalyan pursuits, one can not fall down in status but move up in
status to become sadhu, sanyasi, sainthood etc.

&gt; &gt; Racial Theory of Caste

&gt; &gt; Nineteenth-century Westerners projected the colonial
&gt; &gt; situation and the newest race theories on the caste
&gt; &gt; system: the upper castes were white invaders lording it
&gt; &gt; over the black natives. This outdated view is still
&gt; &gt; repeated ad-nauseam by anti-Hindu authors: now that
&gt; &gt; &quot;idolatry&quot; has lost its force as a term of abuse,
&gt; &gt; &quot;racism&quot; is a welcome innovation to demonize Hinduism. In
&gt; &gt; reality, India is the region where all skin color types
&gt; &gt; met and mingled, and you will find many brahmins as black
&gt; &gt; as Nelson Mandela.

&gt; ... or darker.

&gt; &gt; Ancient &quot;Aryan&quot; heroes like Raam,
&gt; &gt; Krishna, Draupadi, Ravan (a brahmin) and a number of
&gt; &gt; Vedic seers were explicitly described as being dark-
&gt; &gt; skinned.

&gt; &gt; But doesn't varn mean &quot;skin color?&quot;

&gt; No. In which literature is there any suggestion that Brahmanas' and
&gt; Kshatriyas' skin colors are different?
">

Skin color is modern fixation imported from racist cultures. Varna and
HIndu literature have largely remained color blind. They remained
focussed on Guna rather than physical attributes.

Where may people with red or

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; yellow skin be found?
">

American Indians were considered red because of their tanned reddish
brown skin. Similarly, japanese were consdiered yellow in order to
differentiate them from whites. Of course so-called whites are not
really white, but because of their lighter skin than others, they
called themselves white. So ascribing different colors to different
races is not in a literal sense.

&gt; &gt; The FBI and domestic spying: Reason to be wary

&gt; &gt; By Dan K. Thomasson
&gt; &gt; Scripps Howard News Service
&gt; &gt; 29-DEC-05

&gt; &gt; http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&amp;pk=THOMASSON-12-2...

&gt; &gt; WASHINGTON - The FBI, it seems, has been keeping an eye on any
&gt; &gt; number of domestic organizations that appear to have little to do
&gt; &gt; with its stepped up counterintelligence assignment _ shades of
&gt; &gt; Cointelpro, &quot;Commie&quot; hunting, black-bag jobs, and a variety of other
&gt; &gt; notorious activities from the '50s, '60s, and '70s that made the
&gt; &gt; bureau the scourge of any protester who might disagree with
&gt; &gt; prevailing government policy in a demonstrative fashion.

&gt; &gt; The difference, of course, is that the word &quot;terrorism&quot; has been
&gt; &gt; substituted for &quot;communism&quot; (at least in most cases) as the stated
&gt; &gt; reason for checking up on such groups as the People for the Ethical
&gt; &gt; Treatment of Animals (PETA), an admittedly pain-in-the-rear group who
&gt; &gt; would discourage us from such violent activity as milking cows. This
&gt; &gt; comes at a time when the bureau's reputation for ferreting out truly
&gt; &gt; dangerous folks who might be plotting another assault on America is
&gt; &gt; under attack from a half-dozen quarters, including Congress, where
&gt; &gt; former allies have been disillusioned by one failure after another.

&gt; &gt; The bureau reportedly has some 4,000 of its 11,000-plus agents now
&gt; &gt; assigned to seeking out domestic links to al Qaeda and other
&gt; &gt; terrorist networks. So why, it is proper to ask, is it concerned with
&gt; &gt; the antics of environmental extremists such as Greenpeace and
&gt; &gt; anti-war demonstrators? The bureau says that it has a duty to check
&gt; &gt; into any group that might be plotting some criminal activity. Fair
&gt; &gt; enough, but as violent as some of these groups and individuals get is
&gt; &gt; to climb a tree and refuse to come down or unfurl a banner where they
&gt; &gt; shouldn't.

&gt; &gt; Don't misunderstand, the '70s weren't all that benign and the FBI did
&gt; &gt; have legitimate concerns when it came to the violent student groups
&gt; &gt; such as the anarchic Weather Underground many of whose members were
&gt; &gt; extremely bright, if intellectually twisted, and who alluded capture
&gt; &gt; for years. Groups such as the Symbanese Liberation Army of Patty
&gt; &gt; Hearst infamy were actually just made up of sociopaths who
&gt; &gt; infiltrated the legitimate antiwar movement as an excuse for other
&gt; &gt; activities, including extortion and robbery.

&gt; &gt; For that reason, the FBI's current posture in surveillance of
&gt; &gt; seemingly nonthreatening organizations is not all bad. The danger
&gt; &gt; comes in wasting time and money and effort on groups that are
&gt; &gt; well-established with goals that have nothing to do with violent
&gt; &gt; terrorism. This policy merely engenders bad publicity, is
&gt; &gt; constitutionally questionable, and deters the bureau from the mission
&gt; &gt; of preventing another 9-11. In a town where nothing is a secret for
&gt; &gt; long, there is no hope of keeping such activity under wraps, nor
&gt; &gt; should there be. The bureau has struggled to overcome the &quot;storm
&gt; &gt; trooper&quot; image of the '70s and to install reforms that would preclude
&gt; &gt; the abuses from recurring.

&gt; &gt; Granted the terrorists are a threat unlike any the nation has ever
&gt; &gt; confronted, given their faceless nature. But there also are demands
&gt; &gt; to maintaining an open society. Balancing the need to protect that
&gt; &gt; openness from external threats while not adopting internal measures
&gt; &gt; that injure the freedoms that have made it so great is always
&gt; &gt; delicate. Sometimes the cost of liberty is high, but it is necessary
&gt; &gt; to pay it. Few of the nation's institutions should understand that
&gt; &gt; better than the FBI with its record of internal turmoil over the last
&gt; &gt; century.

&gt; &gt; Americans are increasingly sensitive about the &quot;Big Brother&quot;
&gt; &gt; intrusions into their everyday living. Few complain about the need
&gt; &gt; for stricter security nearly everywhere they go. But to be subjected
&gt; &gt; to warrantless wiretaps and official fishing expeditions and other
&gt; &gt; government spying on every aspect of their existence, including what
&gt; &gt; they read at the library, is becoming almost an intolerable burden.
&gt; &gt; That is especially true when it comes against a backdrop of decreased
&gt; &gt; privacy in every normal endeavor of modern life.

&gt; &gt; Cointelpro, the compiling of information about anyone who seemed to
&gt; &gt; disagree with what J. Edgar Hoover and his minions saw as the
&gt; &gt; American way, was a disgrace the bureau survived only by cleaning up
&gt; &gt; its act. The break ins and other activities, some clearly illegal and
&gt; &gt; others highly questionable, conducted by the FBI were career ending
&gt; &gt; for any number of dedicated FBI supervisors and agents, including
&gt; &gt; Mark Felt, who recently admitted to being the &quot;Deep Throat&quot; of
&gt; &gt; Watergate fact and fiction. Felt was convicted and subsequently
&gt; &gt; pardoned for his part in illegal activities in the name of national
&gt; &gt; security.

&gt; &gt; The last thing the FBI wants is a repeat of those activities. It can
&gt; &gt; only undermine what is needed to keep the true terrorists at bay. No
&gt; &gt; organization needs to be more diligent in monitoring itself to
&gt; &gt; prevent the excesses.

HOW WOMEN ARE TREATED IN THE U.S.

Facts about women in the U.S.

Compiled by the majority staff of the Senate
Judiciary Committee (July 31, 1990).

The most serious crimes against women are rising at a
significantly faster rate than total crimes: during the
past 10 years, rape rates have risen nearly four times
as fast as the total crime rate.

Every hour, 16 women confront rapists; a woman is raped
every 6 minutes.

Every 18 seconds, a woman is beaten; 3-4 million women
are battered each year.

Since 1974, the rate of assaults against young women
(20-24) has jumped almost 50%.  For young men, it has
decreased.

Three out of four women will be victims of at least one
violent crime during their lifetimes.

A woman is 10 times more likely to be raped than to die
in a car crash.

Only 50% of rapes are ever reported; of those reported,
less than 40% result in arrest.

One third of all domestic violence cases, if reported,
would be charged as felony rape or felonious assault.

Each year, more than one million women seek medical
assistance for injuries caused by battering.

The crime rate against women in the United States is
significantly higher than in other countries -- the
United States has a rape rate that is 13 times higher
than England's, nearly 4 times higher than Germany's,
and more than 20 times higher than Japan's.

Of the American women alive today, 25 million either
have been, or will be, raped at least once during their
lives.

Last year, the number of women abused by their husbands
was greater than the number of women who got married.

In 1950, police caught 83% of all rapists; in 1988
police caught only 53% of them.

Nearly 50% of abusive husbands batter their wives when
they are pregnant, making them four times more likely to
bear infants of low birth weight.

Of all those arrested for major crimes -- murder, rape,
robbery, assault, burglary, larceny theft, motor vehicle
theft, and arson -- rapists are the most likely to
escape conviction.

If every woman victimized by domestic violence last year
were to join hands in a line, the string of people would
span from New York to Los Angeles and back again.

More than half of all homeless women are on the street
because they are fleeing domestic violence.

More than 40% of college women who have been raped say
that they expect to be raped again.

There were more women injured by rapists last year than
marines wounded by the enemy in all of World War II.

There are nearly three times as many animal shelters in
the United States as there are battered women's
shelters.

Although campus studies suggest that 1,275 women were
raped at America's 3 largest universities in 1989, only
3 of those rapes were reported to police.

1 out of every 7 women currently attending college has
been raped.

486,000 of the girls now attending high school will have
been raped before they graduate.

The average age of a rape victim is 18 1/2 years old.

Young women 16-19 years old are the most likely to be
raped.

57% of college rape victims are attacked by dates. Girls
raped before age 18 are least likely to report the
incident to the police.

Girls aged 12-15 are the most likely to be raped by
strangers.

Rape victims aged 12-19 are the least likely to receive
hospital care.

Since 1974, the rate of assaults against young women
(20-24) has jumped 48%. For men of the same age group,
it has decreased 12%.

Half the cases of women killed in this country are
victims of domestic violence.

Committee (July 31, 1990).

I know as our family buys them all the time from any number of local
stores in USA. However, the customs at newyork applied the prevention
of bio-terrorism clause to confiscate the parcel. In a parcel of 20kg,
the jira and Henna were barely 1kg, rest were dresses for family and
utensils for common kicken use. Than they demanded $375 to return the
parcel back to the sender in india or else they would destory the
parcel.  The cost of goods in the parcel was barely worth $100 in
India. So my friend had to let the parcel be destroyed by customs.
Similar parcels with similar content were sent to other family members
in US thru different couriers and they reached their destinations
without any hassle from customs. It shows how arbitrary and mindless
these anti-terrorism measures have become.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The FBI and domestic spying: Reason to be wary

&gt; &gt; &gt; By Dan K. Thomasson
&gt; &gt; &gt; Scripps Howard News Service
&gt; &gt; &gt; 29-DEC-05

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&amp;pk=THOMASSON-12-2...

&gt; &gt; &gt; WASHINGTON - The FBI, it seems, has been keeping an eye on any
&gt; &gt; &gt; number of domestic organizations that appear to have little to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; with its stepped up counterintelligence assignment _ shades of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cointelpro, &quot;Commie&quot; hunting, black-bag jobs, and a variety of other
&gt; &gt; &gt; notorious activities from the '50s, '60s, and '70s that made the
&gt; &gt; &gt; bureau the scourge of any protester who might disagree with
&gt; &gt; &gt; prevailing government policy in a demonstrative fashion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The difference, of course, is that the word &quot;terrorism&quot; has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; substituted for &quot;communism&quot; (at least in most cases) as the stated
&gt; &gt; &gt; reason for checking up on such groups as the People for the Ethical
&gt; &gt; &gt; Treatment of Animals (PETA), an admittedly pain-in-the-rear group who
&gt; &gt; &gt; would discourage us from such violent activity as milking cows. This
&gt; &gt; &gt; comes at a time when the bureau's reputation for ferreting out truly
&gt; &gt; &gt; dangerous folks who might be plotting another assault on America is
&gt; &gt; &gt; under attack from a half-dozen quarters, including Congress, where
&gt; &gt; &gt; former allies have been disillusioned by one failure after another.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The bureau reportedly has some 4,000 of its 11,000-plus agents now
&gt; &gt; &gt; assigned to seeking out domestic links to al Qaeda and other
&gt; &gt; &gt; terrorist networks. So why, it is proper to ask, is it concerned with
&gt; &gt; &gt; the antics of environmental extremists such as Greenpeace and
&gt; &gt; &gt; anti-war demonstrators? The bureau says that it has a duty to check
&gt; &gt; &gt; into any group that might be plotting some criminal activity. Fair
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough, but as violent as some of these groups and individuals get is
&gt; &gt; &gt; to climb a tree and refuse to come down or unfurl a banner where they
&gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't misunderstand, the '70s weren't all that benign and the FBI did
&gt; &gt; &gt; have legitimate concerns when it came to the violent student groups
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as the anarchic Weather Underground many of whose members were
&gt; &gt; &gt; extremely bright, if intellectually twisted, and who alluded capture
&gt; &gt; &gt; for years. Groups such as the Symbanese Liberation Army of Patty
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hearst infamy were actually just made up of sociopaths who
&gt; &gt; &gt; infiltrated the legitimate antiwar movement as an excuse for other
&gt; &gt; &gt; activities, including extortion and robbery.

&gt; &gt; &gt; For that reason, the FBI's current posture in surveillance of
&gt; &gt; &gt; seemingly nonthreatening organizations is not all bad. The danger
&gt; &gt; &gt; comes in wasting time and money and effort on groups that are
&gt; &gt; &gt; well-established with goals that have nothing to do with violent
&gt; &gt; &gt; terrorism. This policy merely engenders bad publicity, is
&gt; &gt; &gt; constitutionally questionable, and deters the bureau from the mission
&gt; &gt; &gt; of preventing another 9-11. In a town where nothing is a secret for
&gt; &gt; &gt; long, there is no hope of keeping such activity under wraps, nor
&gt; &gt; &gt; should there be. The bureau has struggled to overcome the &quot;storm
&gt; &gt; &gt; trooper&quot; image of the '70s and to install reforms that would preclude
&gt; &gt; &gt; the abuses from recurring.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Granted the terrorists are a threat unlike any the nation has ever
&gt; &gt; &gt; confronted, given their faceless nature. But there also are demands
&gt; &gt; &gt; to maintaining an open society. Balancing the need to protect that
&gt; &gt; &gt; openness from external threats while not adopting internal measures
&gt; &gt; &gt; that injure the freedoms that have made it so great is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; delicate. Sometimes the cost of liberty is high, but it is necessary
&gt; &gt; &gt; to pay it. Few of the nation's institutions should understand that
&gt; &gt; &gt; better than the FBI with its record of internal turmoil over the last
&gt; &gt; &gt; century.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Americans are increasingly sensitive about the &quot;Big Brother&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; intrusions into their everyday living. Few complain about the need
&gt; &gt; &gt; for stricter security nearly everywhere they go. But to be subjected
&gt; &gt; &gt; to warrantless wiretaps and official fishing expeditions and other
&gt; &gt; &gt; government spying on every aspect of their existence, including what
&gt; &gt; &gt; they read at the library, is becoming almost an intolerable burden.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is especially true when it comes against a backdrop of decreased
&gt; &gt; &gt; privacy in every normal endeavor of modern life.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Cointelpro, the compiling of information about anyone who seemed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; disagree with what J. Edgar Hoover and his minions saw as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; American way, was a disgrace the bureau survived only by cleaning up
&gt; &gt; &gt; its act. The break ins and other activities, some clearly illegal and
&gt; &gt; &gt; others highly questionable, conducted by the FBI were career ending
&gt; &gt; &gt; for any number of dedicated FBI supervisors and agents, including
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mark Felt, who recently admitted to being the &quot;Deep Throat&quot; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Watergate fact and fiction. Felt was convicted and subsequently
&gt; &gt; &gt; pardoned for his part in illegal activities in the name of national
&gt; &gt; &gt; security.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The last thing the FBI wants is a repeat of those activities. It can
&gt; &gt; &gt; only undermine what is needed to keep the true terrorists at bay. No
&gt; &gt; &gt; organization needs to be more diligent in monitoring itself to
&gt; &gt; &gt; prevent the excesses.

They could go back to India if life in the US is so terrible. That is
the problem with the "immigrants" coming here from 3rd world countries.
They do not share our values but they want the benefits of our free
society. In India they slaughter each other over religious differences
and brutally discriminate against their own citizens based on their
caste system. They sell their daughters while still young girls into
marriages to old perverts and beat them to death if the dowry is not
good enough. What is even more disgusting is that a country like India
where people are starving and live in filth would spend billions on
nuclear weapons and wage war against its neighbors to gain territory.
Why don't you clean up your own country before you condemn others?

Jatis is a unique feature of hindu civilization. it is possible that
Jatis in a loose functional sense could have pre-existed. But what
facilitated evolution of Jatis as we know them in Indian context? The
seeds are in varna. Metaphysics has to plant the seeds before it can

jatis could evolve.

&gt; varnas might have split into jatis, this is not how Jati originated, so
&gt; there was no emergence of Jati from Varna.

I disagree. verna is the chicken and jatis are the eggs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Verna and Jatis allowed space and freedom to group aspirations and
&gt; &gt; immigrants, accmodated social, cultural and religious differentiations
&gt; &gt; - usually diversity in social, cultural and religious sphere becomes
&gt; &gt; the greatest source of conflicts and disharmony - In case of India,
&gt; &gt; they found a accomodating framework in verna and jatis.

&gt; They found an accomodating framework in Jati, not in &quot;Varna and Jati&quot;.
&gt; What space and freedom did varna allow?
">

Varna and jatis could not have survived without each other. Show me a
civilization where they exist independently and by themselves. In other
civilizations, both concepts are absent. Varna are firmly rooted in
Hindu mataphysics and therefore it is the mother of all social
realities produced by Hindu mataphysics. Without varna, jatis can not
exist.
varna provides the necessary framewrok for Jatis to evolve.

Very few items made in the US are attractive

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The FBI and domestic spying: Reason to be wary

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By Dan K. Thomasson
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scripps Howard News Service
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 29-DEC-05

&gt; http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&amp;pk=THOMASSON-12-2...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WASHINGTON - The FBI, it seems, has been keeping an eye on any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; number of domestic organizations that appear to have little to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with its stepped up counterintelligence assignment _ shades of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cointelpro, &quot;Commie&quot; hunting, black-bag jobs, and a variety of other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; notorious activities from the '50s, '60s, and '70s that made the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bureau the scourge of any protester who might disagree with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevailing government policy in a demonstrative fashion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The difference, of course, is that the word &quot;terrorism&quot; has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substituted for &quot;communism&quot; (at least in most cases) as the stated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reason for checking up on such groups as the People for the Ethical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Treatment of Animals (PETA), an admittedly pain-in-the-rear group who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would discourage us from such violent activity as milking cows. This
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes at a time when the bureau's reputation for ferreting out truly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dangerous folks who might be plotting another assault on America is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; under attack from a half-dozen quarters, including Congress, where
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; former allies have been disillusioned by one failure after another.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bureau reportedly has some 4,000 of its 11,000-plus agents now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assigned to seeking out domestic links to al Qaeda and other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrorist networks. So why, it is proper to ask, is it concerned with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the antics of environmental extremists such as Greenpeace and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anti-war demonstrators? The bureau says that it has a duty to check
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into any group that might be plotting some criminal activity. Fair
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough, but as violent as some of these groups and individuals get is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to climb a tree and refuse to come down or unfurl a banner where they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't misunderstand, the '70s weren't all that benign and the FBI did
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have legitimate concerns when it came to the violent student groups
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such as the anarchic Weather Underground many of whose members were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extremely bright, if intellectually twisted, and who alluded capture
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for years. Groups such as the Symbanese Liberation Army of Patty
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hearst infamy were actually just made up of sociopaths who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; infiltrated the legitimate antiwar movement as an excuse for other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; activities, including extortion and robbery.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For that reason, the FBI's current posture in surveillance of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seemingly nonthreatening organizations is not all bad. The danger
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes in wasting time and money and effort on groups that are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well-established with goals that have nothing to do with violent
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrorism. This policy merely engenders bad publicity, is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constitutionally questionable, and deters the bureau from the mission
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of preventing another 9-11. In a town where nothing is a secret for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; long, there is no hope of keeping such activity under wraps, nor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should there be. The bureau has struggled to overcome the &quot;storm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trooper&quot; image of the '70s and to install reforms that would preclude
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the abuses from recurring.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Granted the terrorists are a threat unlike any the nation has ever
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confronted, given their faceless nature. But there also are demands
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to maintaining an open society. Balancing the need to protect that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; openness from external threats while not adopting internal measures
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that injure the freedoms that have made it so great is always
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delicate. Sometimes the cost of liberty is high, but it is necessary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to pay it. Few of the nation's institutions should understand that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better than the FBI with its record of internal turmoil over the last
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; century.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Americans are increasingly sensitive about the &quot;Big Brother&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intrusions into their everyday living. Few complain about the need
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for stricter security nearly everywhere they go. But to be subjected
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to warrantless wiretaps and official fishing expeditions and other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; government spying on every aspect of their existence, including what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they read at the library, is becoming almost an intolerable burden.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is especially true when it comes against a backdrop of decreased
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; privacy in every normal endeavor of modern life.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cointelpro, the compiling of information about anyone who seemed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disagree with what J. Edgar Hoover and his minions saw as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; American way, was a disgrace the bureau survived only by cleaning up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its act. The break ins and other activities, some clearly illegal and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others highly questionable, conducted by the FBI were career ending
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for any number of dedicated FBI supervisors and agents, including
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mark Felt, who recently admitted to being the &quot;Deep Throat&quot; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Watergate fact and fiction. Felt was convicted and subsequently
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pardoned for his part in illegal activities in the name of national
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; security.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The last thing the FBI wants is a repeat of those activities. It can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only undermine what is needed to keep the true terrorists at bay. No
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; organization needs to be more diligent in monitoring itself to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevent the excesses.

No, it is better to make positive changes in the US to make it
a better place for as many people as possible.  Now if you don't
like positive changes and betterment, you CAN return to wherever

to make room for higher priority ones. America has used
criminzalization of drugs to incarcerate majority of Black youths in
jails - one in 10 black youths has been to jail. Millions of Black and
hispanics live like second class citizens - no matter what they do,
they never see empowerment or economic progress and most continue to
live in ghettos. Every president in this century has waged some
form(direct or proxy) of war on foreign land on one or another pretext
killing millions of people abroad. Millions of abortions are performed
year after year. America kills highest number of people thru death
penulty in the world. America posesses the highest number of weapons of
mass destruction in the world and yet it keep amassing weapons of mass
destructions year after year and it is the only country that has used
them and refuses to agree to no-first-nuclear-strike pledge - in
essence, it has become a global bully and want to dictate terms to the
world by military might. I can go on and on, buddy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Merits of the Caste System

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Caste also provided a framework for integrating immigrant
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communities: Jews, Zoroastrians and Syrian Christians.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did Varna provide such a framework? Jati did, and jati didn't come from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aryavarta, so can framers of varna be credited with providing such a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; framework? How was varna useful, in any way, to these communities?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Varna provides broad classifications and within each classification,

&gt; &gt; Were Nishada warriors kshatriyas? Were Nishada or Naga priests
&gt; &gt; Brahmanas or at a later date, were Mullahs Brahmanas? If not, varna was
&gt; &gt; not just a broad occupational classification.

&gt; What i said is true within he context of Indian civilization.

No. Nishadas, Gonds, Izhavas, etc. were part of Indian civilization and
they didn't have chaturvarna.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Imported

Indians at large have never got integrated into the varna system. Varna
followers got integrated into the jati system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; more specializations had to occur which could have evolved into Jati.

&gt; &gt; Are these occupational specializations, that had to occur?  Aiyars and
&gt; &gt; Aiyangars have not historically had different occupational
&gt; &gt; specializations. Kammas and Reddis have not historically had different
&gt; &gt; occupational specializations either.

&gt; Occupational specialization is not the only factor. immigration and
&gt; non-occupational specializations and evolutions over time could be
&gt; other factors.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As deviation from the norms would occur over time, as new immigrants
&gt; &gt; &gt; arrived, as more specializations occured over time, the varna system
&gt; &gt; &gt; had to integrate them - that would explain emergence of jatis.

&gt; &gt; Jati was the norm; there were jatis before there were varnas.

&gt; Jatis is a unique feature of hindu civilization. it is possible that
&gt; Jatis in a loose functional sense could have pre-existed. But what
&gt; facilitated evolution of Jatis as we know them in Indian context? The
&gt; seeds are in varna.

The seeds of Tamil kuDis were not in chaturvarna. There were kuDis

The Poems of Ancient Tamil
http://indiaclub.com/shop/SearchResults.asp?ProdStock=8889
Using Tamil poems written between the first and third centuries AD as a
source, George Hart embarks on a study of the literature and the
society that produced it.
He considers what the poems reveal about ancient south India that
demonstrates that pre-Aryan religion and society had characteristics
that illuminate the origins of certain key elements in pan-Indian
culture. Through close and comparative readings of the poems and their
context, Hart presents evidence that the culture which flourished in
south India in the first millennium BC is an important source for
cultural elements today spread all over India.

REVIEWS:
A thought-provoking, not to say provocative book. Some of Hart's
insights are truly marvelous, and must certainly be followed up by
future research...refreshing, original, excellent work of first-class
importance.
- Kamil V Zvelebil, Journal of the American Oriental Society

&gt; &gt; &gt; Verna and Jatis allowed space and freedom to group aspirations and
&gt; &gt; &gt; immigrants, accmodated social, cultural and religious differentiations
&gt; &gt; &gt; - usually diversity in social, cultural and religious sphere becomes
&gt; &gt; &gt; the greatest source of conflicts and disharmony - In case of India,
&gt; &gt; &gt; they found a accomodating framework in verna and jatis.

&gt; &gt; They found an accomodating framework in Jati, not in &quot;Varna and Jati&quot;.
&gt; &gt; What space and freedom did varna allow?

&gt; Varna and jatis could not have survived without each other. Show me a
&gt; civilization where they exist independently and by themselves.

Past Indian civilization. Some societies had chaturvarna, other
societies (see GLH's article below) had jati and other societies had
both chaturvarna and jati.

Early Evidence for Caste in South India
George L. Hart
http://tamil.berkeley.edu/Research/Articles/Caste2.pdf
The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of caste in
South India in the period from about 100 A.D. to about 700 A.D.
Obviously, if one says that caste is simply varïa, then early South
Indian sources will be of little use. If, on the other hand, one looks
at other features of caste that seem to be more important to how it
actually functions-the nature of untouchability, for example-then
the early Tamil sources have much to reveal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In other
&gt; civilizations, both concepts are absent. Varna are firmly rooted in
&gt; Hindu mataphysics and therefore it is the mother of all social
&gt; realities produced by Hindu mataphysics. Without varna, jatis can not
&gt; exist.
&gt; varna provides the necessary framewrok for Jatis to evolve.
">

Repeating bullshit doesn't make it true. All sorts of places have jatis
without having chaturvarna.  . In S Africa, Mandela is of Xhosa
(non-occupational) jati. Tamizhaham had non-occupational and
occupational jatis. Kerala had YahUdi (Jewish) jatis before people with
chaturvarna showed up.

The big difference is that the early immigrants to America appreciated
their new found freedom and opportunities. People like you come here
from countries that are horrible places but instead of appreciating
your good fortune, trash like you bite the hand that feeds them. So,
stop attacking the country that gave you opportunities you could never
have in your backward country or go back to India and buy yourself a
child wife and murder her if the dowry is not to your liking. That is
your country.

I didn't say they're referred to as a group; I said they're referred to
as a jAti by Malayalis speaking Malayalam. vidyArtigaL (students) were
not referred to as a jAti by Malayalis. I tried asking older people
what the terminology was in the early 20th century and found that
kristiyAnigaL or nasRANigaL (or subsets thereof) were jAtis even at
that time. Varna was not used in a class or status context even in my
parents' time. A low status is called tANa jAti. That means a high
status jAtis would be an uyarna jAti. I have not, however, heard any
jAti being called an uyarna jAti or any other term implying a high
status.

Here too, I haven't heard the term varna used; I've heard only jAti and
vargam (category) used by Christians to refer to other groups of
Christians. Also terms like acAyanmAr (either genteel families or
old-money familes depending on the context) or cOvanmAr (from a
laboring class background). An example of usage of vargam is "raNDu
kUTTarum orE vargattil paTTadANa" - both clans fall into the same
category (i.e., they're birds of a feather).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Catching terrorist scum is no easy business.

&gt; &gt; This was probably a good reason why the west oppossed India's Prevention
of
&gt; &gt; Terrorism Act (POTA) was to be enacted by the Congress Party and then
the
&gt; &gt; BJP and put alot of pressure on the GoI. When it comes to supporting
&gt; &gt; terrorism against India the west and the Islamic world are very good at
it.
&gt; &gt; However, post 9/11 we see how the west has laws that challenge civil
&gt; &gt; liberties and there is hardly any opposition!

&gt; &gt; Shows the double standards that are in place.

The place was, until quite recently, an extremely backward place, made
even more miserable by its perverse attachment to an especially
pernicious form of socialism.  The place is only now taking off, far
later than China and far later than they might have done, because of a

When I was young and growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, the mental
image of India with its TENS of millions of cripplingly impoverished,
literally starving people was *THE* image of extreme poverty and
desperation.  Children in North America were always told to "clean your
plate (don't waste food), because some poor starving child in India is
dying" (as if the poor starving Indian kid had any hope of getting the
food.)  India's economic woes were almost entirely of their own making.
Gandhi and the horrendously corrupt and despotic Nehru gang
(Jawaharlal Nehru, daughter Indira Gandhi, and her two halfwit sons)
all should have been HANGED for what they did to their country and
countrymen.  M. Gandhi, Indira and Rajiv got what they deserved.

You seem to be answering to me but I do not take part in religious
discussions. More people got killed over religion than any other cause.
My interest in vegetarianism is based primarily on my concern for the
cruel and unsanitary conditions in the meat industry and my desire not
to have another creature to be killed for my enjoyment. The only reason
I got into this thread was because I objected to some of the smears
directed at the US but I decided to drop from the thread when I noted
that the meat industry shill Erikson was arguing on my side. I wish to
have nothing to do with his kind. Now, I am really done with this

Very well put.

TRIBUTES TO HINDUISM

1. Mahatma Gandhi:

"Hinduism has made marvelous discoveries in things of
religion, of the spirit, of the soul. We have no eye for
these great and fine discoveries. We are dazzled by the
material progress that western science has made. Ancient
India has survived because Hinduism was not developed
along material but spiritual lines.

"India is to me the dearest country in the world, because
I have discovered goodness in it. It has been subject to
foreign rule, it is true. But the status of a slave is
preferable to that of a slave holder."

2. Henry David Thoreau:

"In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous
and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita in
comparison with which our modern world and its literature
seems puny.

"What extracts from the Vedas I have read fall on me like
the light of a higher and purer luminary, which describes
a loftier course through purer stratum. It rises on me
like the full moon after the stars have come out, wading
through some far stratum in the sky."

3. Arthur Schopenhauer:

"In the whole world there is no study so beneficial and
so elevating as that of the Upanishads. It has been the
solace of my life -- it will be the solace of my death."

4. Ralph Waldo Emerson said this about the Gita:

"I owed a magnificent day to the Bhagavad Gita. It was as
if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but
large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old
intelligence which in another age and climate had
pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which
exercise us."

The famous poem "Brahm" is an example of his Vedanta
ecstasy.

5. Wilhelm von Humboldt pronounced the Gita as:

"The most beautiful, perhaps the only true philosophical
song existing in any known tongue ... perhaps the deepest
and loftiest thing the world has to show."

6. Lord Warren Hastings, the Governor General, was very
much impressed with Hindu philosophy:

"The writers of the Indian philosophies will survive,
when the British dominion in India shall long have ceased
to exist, and when the sources which it yielded of wealth
and power are lost to remembrances."

7. Mark Twain:

"So far as I am able to judge, nothing has been left
undone, either by man or nature, to make India the most
extraordinary country that the sun visits on his rounds.
Nothing seems to have been forgotten, nothing overlooked.

"Land of religions, cradle of human race, birthplace of
human speech, grandmother of legend, great grandmother of
tradition. The land that all men desire to see and having
seen once even by a glimpse, would not give that glimpse
for the shows of the rest of the globe combined."

8. Rudyard Kipling to Fundamental Christian Missionaries:

"Now it is not good for the Christian's health to hustle
the Hindu brown for the Christian riles and the Hindu
smiles and weareth the Christian down; and the end of the
fight is a tombstone while with the name of the late
deceased and the epitaph drear, "A fool lies here who
tried to hustle the east".

9. Jules Michelet, a French historian, said:

"At its starting point in India, the birthplace of races
and religions, the womb of the world." This is what he
said of the Raamyana in 1864: "Whoever has done or willed
too much let him drink from this deep cup a long draught
of life and youth .. . Everything is narrow in the West -
- Greece is small and I stifle; Judea is dry and I pant.
Let me look toward lofty Asia, and the profound East for
a little while. There lies my great poem, as vast as the
Indian ocean, blessed, gilded with the sun, the book of
divine harmony wherein is no dissonance. A serene peace
reigns there, and in the midst of conflict an infinite
sweetness, a boundless fraternity, which spreads over all
living things, an ocean (without bottom or bound) of
love, of pity, of clemency."

10. Shri Aurobindo:

"Hinduism.....gave itself no name, because it set itself
no sectarian limits; it claimed no universal adhesion,
asserted no sole infallible dogma, set up no single
narrow path or gate of salvation; it was less a creed or
cult than a continuously enlarging tradition of the
Godward endeavor of the human spirit. An immense many-
sided and many staged provision for a spiritual self-
building and self-finding, it had some right to speak of
itself by the only name it knew, the eternal religion,
sanaatan dharm...."

11. Will Durant would like the West to learn from India,
tolerance and gentleness and love for all living things:

"Perhaps in return for conquest, arrogance and
spoliation, India will teach us the tolerance and
gentleness of the mature mind, the quiet content of the
unacquisitive soul, the calm of the understanding spirit,
and a unifying, a pacifying love for all living things."

12. Joseph Campbell:

"It is ironic that our great western civilization, which
has opened to the minds of all mankind the infinite
wonders of a universe of untold billions of galaxies
should be saddled with the tightest little cosmological
image known to mankind? The Hindus with their grandiose
Kalpas and their ideas of the divine power which is
beyond all human category (male or female). Not so alien
to the imagery of modern science that it could not have
been put to acceptable use.

"There is an important difference between the Hindu and
the Western ideas. In the Biblical tradition, God creates
man, but man cannot say that he is divine in the same
sense that the Creator is, where as in Hinduism, all
things are incarnations of that power. We are the sparks
from a single fire. And we are all fire. Hinduism
believes in the omnipresence of the Supreme God in every
individual. There is no 'fall'. Man is not cut off from
the divine. He requires only to bring the spontaneous
activity of his mind stuff to a state of stillness and he
will experience that divine principle with him."

13. Sir Monier-Williams:

The Hindus, according to him, were Spinozists more than
2,000 years before the advent of Spinoza, and Darwinians
many centuries before Darwin and Evolutionists many
centuries before the doctrine of Evolution was accepted
by scientists of the present age.

14. Carl Sagan, (the late scientist), asserts that the
dance of Nataraj signifies the cycle of evolution and
destruction of the cosmic universe (Big Bang Theory). "It
is the clearest image of the activity of God which any
art or religion can boast of."

15. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a professor of Eastern
Religions at Oxford and later President of India:

"Hinduism is not just a faith. It is the union of reason
and intuition that cannot be defined but is only to be
experienced. Evil and error are not ultimate. There is no
Hell, for that means there is a place where God is not,
and there are sins which exceed his love."

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tell us about your caste system:-)))))

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure as is written in the Bhagvat Gita God tells us that we all have our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individual nature determines our occupation not birth. There are many
&gt; &gt; people
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who follow the teachings however there are many who do not and exploit
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so called caste system to take advantage of others.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Our faith is Sanatan Dharma (Eternal Servents of God), each and everyone
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us should be the servent of the servent of God and together we should be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; building a spritual society.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I have given you the essences of what is the bases of the caste
&gt; &gt; system
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (division of labour). What else do you want to know?

&gt; &gt; &gt; How is that you denigrate millions of your own people based on your
&gt; &gt; &gt; caste system and still try to preach others?

&gt; &gt; i think hinduism, unlike other religions, is never preached. you gota want
&gt; &gt; to learn it, and pay for it.
&gt; &gt; you won't see hindu books handed out free like bibles are in usa.
&gt; &gt; caste discriminiation is banned in india. but things happen just as they do
&gt; &gt; in usa against blacks and swedes.

&gt; You seem to be answering to me but I do not take part in religious
&gt; discussions. More people got killed over religion than any other cause.
">

Which religion or religions? Also, are there some stats about this?  What
about the number of people killed due to the cause of acquiring wealth,
or oil, or smoking cigarettes, or the cause of living it up by engaging
in harmful activities, or the cause of invading countries, etc., etc.?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My interest in vegetarianism is based primarily on my concern for the
&gt; cruel and unsanitary conditions in the meat industry and my desire not
&gt; to have another creature to be killed for my enjoyment. The only reason
&gt; I got into this thread was because I objected to some of the smears
&gt; directed at the US but I decided to drop from the thread when I noted
&gt; that the meat industry shill Erikson was arguing on my side. I wish to
&gt; have nothing to do with his kind. Now, I am really done with this
&gt; thread!

Enjoy the healthy, vegetarian lifestyle!

Interesting to see the contrast between, say, Kerala and Maharastra or
Nagaland and Delhi.
