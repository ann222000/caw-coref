I started a thread a little over a year ago (Question about grout in
new shower 4/25/06).  Here's a summary of how things tuned out last
year - and some new problems...

It turned out that they *did* use two different colored grouts.  When
the sub-contractor came back out, he brought the almond colored grout
used for most of the job.  That was clearly different than the
bone/grey grout (that they left with use) used for approximately 10%
of the job.  After apologizing, the sub-contractor proceeded to scrape
out the bone/grey grout and apply almond grout.

Now, about a year later, we have a thin crack, about 6 inches long,
that extends through the grout *and* through one of the tiles.  The
crack also happens to be in one of the locations that originally had
the wrong colored grout.  I'm wondering if there could be a
connection.

Some points:

1) I believe the sub-contractor used a razor blade to scrape out the
old grout - perhaps not the correct instrument.  Also, I don't believe
he scraped out all the old grout (but probably the majority).

2) The crack is along the edge of tile that was cut/sawed to fit in
place (it's actually outside of the shower, along a thin strip of
wall, that was thinner than the tiles - hence the cutting).  I believe
they used an appropriate tile saw to do the cutting.  But I'm
wondering if the cutting could weaken the tile - leading to the crack.

So to summarize, the crack goes through the grout that was replaced
and alongside the cut tiles (on the side that was cut) then through
one of the cut tiles itself.  So I'm wondering if the initial use of
the wrong grout or the cutting of the tiles could have caused the
crack?  Or perhaps, these are just coincidences.

Also - we have some small cracks in the grout in the upper corners of
the shower, where we have &quot;thicker&quot; tiles that protrude from the wall
(don't know the technical term for this).  Because of the way these
tiles meet in the corners, I'm guessing that it was difficult to fill
the entire gap with grout - leading to these cracks.

Solutions?

Is it &quot;OK&quot; to simply fill in the cracks with more grout, or does one
need to properly remove the old grout first?  Also, though we have a
replacement tile for the one that is cracked, I'm wondering if there
is way to repair the cracked tile itself?  I've read that &quot;paintable
grout&quot; could be used for this purpose.  Given that the replacement
tile would have to be cut (and I'm speculating that different saws
might leave different looking tiles edges), perhaps a replacement tile
might look more out of place than simply repairing the cracked tile?

Finally - I'm interested in opinions as to why we have these various
cracks?  The shower is barely a year old, so it concerns me that we
already have grout and tile cracks.  I don't want to have repairs
done, only to have more cracks a year from now...

Thanks for any advice!
