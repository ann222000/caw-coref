Child abuse? Can't say
State says federal memo puts a lock on its files in fatality cases

For the past 10 years, a federal law has required welfare officials,
following a child-abuse death, to disclose any prior involvement they
had with the child's family.

Now state officials are withhold ing information that they previ ously
would have made public in child-death cases, citing new guidelines from
Washington on what they can release.

Federal officials say the guidelines do not represent a change in
policy. But state Department of Children and Families Commis sioner
Kevin Ryan, after consulting Attorney General Anne Milgram, believes
they prohibit the state from disclosing a family's history -- such as a
previous investigation -- if it does not pertain to the incident that
caused the child's death.

The state cited a federal memo this week in declining to provide The
Star-Ledger with details of the state's involvement with 2-year-old
Zaheera Williams of Newark, who died Monday after swallowing her
great-grandmother's medication, according to police.

Meanwhile, the Office of the Child Advocate -- the independent
&quot;watchdog&quot; agency for government entities serving kids -- has not re
leased a report on the state Divi sion of Youth and Family Services'
prior involvement with three children killed in two incidents last year.

Ryan's staff fears Washington may sanction the state by withholding
federal funds if the information is made public, Child Advo cate's
Office chief of staff Tiffany Ellis said.

The state's concern stems from a Sept. 5 memo issued by the U.S.
Administration of Children and Families.

An official in the federal agency said the law has not changed and New
Jersey should continue to re lease information to the public as it
always had.

The September memo was meant only to prevent states from revealing
&quot;personal identifying information and things not relevant to the facts
of the case,&quot; said Susan Orr, associate commissioner of the Children's
Bureau in the Administration of Children and Families. New Jersey &quot;can
decide whether previous involvement is relevant,&quot; Orr said.

State officials say they asked for a clarification, but when that ar
rived Oct. 3, it was just as murky, said Ryan spokeswoman Mary Helen
Cervantes.

&quot;The clarification still left questions for many people. We want to make
sure we are in compliance,&quot; she said. There will be a meeting today
among officials from the At torney General's Office, the Child
Advocate's Office and the Department of Children and Families on how
they should proceed, Cer vantes said.

Child welfare advocates, officials and critics are concerned.

Passage of the federal law 10 years ago offered a rare glimpse into
agencies that often are accused of hiding behind iron-clad
confidentiality rules.

Because of it, the state had to admit four years ago that it had made
grievous errors in the case of Faheem Williams (no relation to Zaheera
Williams), the 7-year-old boy whose body was found stuffed in a basement
closet in Newark.

The revelation that DYFS had literally lost track of Faheem and his
family elicited the outrage -- and political will -- to drive what has
become a nearly half-billion- dollar reform of the long-mismanaged and
underfunded agency, said Cecilia Zalkind, executive director of the
Association for Children of New Jersey.

Had the law been interpreted this narrowly in 2003, the public would not
have learned that DYFS never investigated a tip that Fa heem's mother
had scalded and beaten him and his brothers. That was not directly
related to Fa heem's later death, which resulted from rough play with
the son of his mother's cousin.

&quot;This is very disturbing. It undermines the intent of the law,&quot; Zalkind
said. &quot;You must consider the child and family's history with the agency
to assess how DYFS handled the case. That was the whole point&quot; of the
10-year-old federal law, she said.

Susan Lambiase, associate di rector of the national advocacy
organization Children's Rights, who has sued New Jersey to improve DYFS,
called the change &quot;an enor mous loss. The law focused attention on
problems that are too often behind closed doors.&quot;

Ryan has asked federal officials for more information.

If &quot;the new federal policy disal lows important disclosures that are
inherent to this work, we think the Bush administration has moved in the
wrong direction,&quot; DYFS spokeswoman Kate Bernyk said.

Child Advocate E. Susan Hodg son said she believes federal officials
have adequately clarified what DYFS is allowed to disclose and she's
anxious to release her report on the three child deaths.

&quot;These kids have paid the highest price,&quot; Hodgson said. &quot;If these kids
have died because the systems they were involved in did not serve to
protect them, those are the very things that need public focus.&quot;

CURRENTLY CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES VIOLATES MORE CIVIL RIGHTS ON A
DAILY BASIS THEN ALL OTHER AGENCIES COMBINED INCLUDING THE NSA / CIA
WIRETAPPING PROGRAM....

CPS Does not protect children...
It is sickening how many children are subject to abuse, neglect and even
killed at the hands of Child Protective Services.

every parent should read this .pdf from
connecticut dcf watch...

http://www.connecticutdcfwatch.com/8x11.pdf

http://www.connecticutdcfwatch.com

Number of Cases per 100,000 children in the US
These numbers come from The National Center on
Child Abuse and Neglect in Washington. (NCCAN)
Recent numbers have increased significantly for CPS

*Perpetrators of Maltreatment*

Physical Abuse CPS 160, Parents 59
Sexual Abuse CPS 112, Parents 13
Neglect CPS 410, Parents 241
Medical Neglect CPS 14 Parents 12
Fatalities CPS 6.4, Parents 1.5

Imagine that, 6.4 children die at the hands of the very agencies that
are supposed to protect them and only 1.5 at the hands of parents per
100,000 children. CPS perpetrates more abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse
and kills more children then parents in the United States. If the
citizens of this country hold CPS to the same standards that they hold
parents too. No judge should ever put another child in the hands of ANY
government agency because CPS nationwide is guilty of more harm and
death than any human being combined. CPS nationwide is guilty of more
human rights violations and deaths of children then the homes from which
they were removed. When are the judges going to wake up and see that
they are sending children to their death and a life of abuse when
children are removed from safe homes based on the mere opinion of a
bunch of social workers.

CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES, HAPPILY DESTROYING THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT
FAMILIES YEARLY NATIONWIDE AND COMING TO YOU'RE HOME SOON...

BE SURE TO FIND OUT WHERE YOUR CANDIDATES STANDS ON THE ISSUE OF
REFORMING OR ABOLISHING CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES (&quot;MAKE YOUR CANDIDATES
TAKE A STAND ON THIS ISSUE.&quot;) THEN REMEMBER TO VOTE ACCORDINGLY IF THEY
ARE &quot;FAMILY UNFRIENDLY&quot; IN THE NEXT ELECTION...
