Report: Exporting Jobs Overseas Will Help U.S.

WASHINGTON - The movement of American factory jobs and white-collar
work to other countries is part of a positive transformation that will
enrich the U.S., the Bush administration said today...

The report endorses the relatively new phenomenon of outsourcing
high-end white-collar work to India and other countries, a trend that
has created concern within affected professions such as computer
programming and medical diagnostics.

&quot;The gains from trade that take place over the Internet or telephone
lines are no different then the gains from trade in physical goods
transported by ship or plane,&quot; it says. &quot;When a good or service is
produced at lower cost in another country, it makes sense to import it
rather than to produce it domestically.&quot;...

That would be an increase of 216,000 jobs every month. Or 325,000/month

Jobs, Jobs, Jobs
By PAUL KRUGMAN

Last Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics delivered yet another
disappointing employment report.

Since there's a lot of confusion on this subject, let's talk about the
numbers. The bureau actually produces two estimates of employment, one
based on a survey that asks each employer in a random sample how many
workers are on its payroll, the other on a survey that asks each
household in a random sample how many of its members are employed.
Most experts regard the employer survey as more reliable; even in the
midst of the recovery, that survey has contained nothing but bad news.
The household numbers look better, but not particularly good.

For technical reasons involving seasonal adjustment, many economists
expected the January report to show a one-time bounce in both
measures. Yet employment as measured by the payroll survey rose by
only 112,000 - well short of the increase needed just to keep up with
a growing population. If employment were rising as rapidly as it did
when the economy was emerging from the 1990-1991 recession, we'd be
seeing monthly numbers more like 275,000.

Taking a longer view, the payroll numbers tell a dismal story. Since
the recovery officially began in November 2001, employment has
actually fallen by half a percent, while the working-age population
has increased about 2.4 percent. By this measure, jobs are becoming
ever scarcer.

The household survey, on which the official unemployment rate is
based, tells a less dismal but far from happy story. (Why the
discrepancy? We don't know.) The number of people who say they have
jobs has risen since the recovery began - but has still lagged behind
population growth.

The only seemingly favorable statistic is the unemployment rate, which
has recently fallen to 5.6 percent, the same as in November 2001. But
how is that possible, when employment has grown more slowly than the
population, or even declined? The answer is that people aren't counted
as unemployed unless they're looking for work, and a growing fraction
of the population isn't even looking. It's hard to see how this is
good news.

Other indicators continue to suggest a grim job picture. In the last
three months, more than 40 percent of the unemployed have been out of
work more than 15 weeks. That's the worst number since 1983, and a
sign that jobs remain very hard to find - which is what anyone who has
lost a job will tell you.

One last statistic - not about jobs, but about wages. Since the last
quarter of 2001, real G.D.P. has risen 7.2 percent. But wage and
salary income, after adjusting for inflation, is up only 0.6 percent.
This matches what the employer survey is telling us: America's workers
have seen very little benefit from this recovery.

In the light of these dreary statistics, President Bush's recent
cheerfulness seems almost surreal. On Friday, he said that he was
&quot;pleased, obviously, with the new job growth.&quot; When Tim Russert asked
in the &quot;Meet the Press&quot; interview what happened to all the jobs that
Mr. Bush promised his tax cuts would create, he replied: &quot;It's
happening. And there is good momentum when it comes to the creation of
new jobs.&quot;

We expect politicians to place a positive spin on economic news, but
to insist that things are going great when many people have personal
experience to the contrary seems foolish. Mr. Bush's father lost the
1992 election in large part because he was perceived as being out of
touch with the difficulties faced by ordinary Americans. Why is Mr.
Bush - whose poll numbers are a bit worse than his father's were at
this point in 1992 - running the risk of repeating his experience?

The answer, I think, is that the younger Mr. Bush has no choice. He
has literally gone for broke, with repeated tax cuts that have fed a
$500 billion deficit. To justify policies that more and more people
call irresponsible, he must claim that wonderful things are happening
as a result.

For a while, that famous 8 percent growth rate seemed to be just what
he needed. But in the fourth quarter, growth dropped to 4 percent. And
as we've seen, the jobs still aren't there.

So Mr. Bush must put on a brave face. He and his officials must talk
up weak economic statistics as if they represented stunning success,
and predict marvelous things any day now. After all, they have to keep
this up for only nine more months.

"/> Do those unemployment figures include all the people who have given up
looking for work? Usually unemployment figures only include people who are
still looking for work (ie are collecting unemployment, or have signed up
for job counseling, etc.). There may be millions more who are still
unemployed but not signed up for government unemployment services, so there
is no way to count them. That is usually the case. -Dave

this by at least aiming his controversial tax cuts towards job creation,

US gives India assurance on outsourcing
CHIDANAND RAJGHATTA
TIMES NEWS NETWORK

WASHINGTON: The Indian government and businesses have won a major
assurance from the Bush Administration on the issue of outsourcing.

A senior US official has said Washington is against any attempt by
state governments to legislate a ban on outsourcing on the lines of
what is being considered in New Jersey and other states.

The official, US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, gave this
assurance in course of three hours of intensive talks with Indian
Commerce Minister Arun Jaitley, during which they discussed subjects
ranging from the movement of people to the export of Indian mangoes to
the US.

"/> To the contrary, this mess started in 1987, when a proposed
change to our corporate income tax laws (which would have
taxed income from foreign production and GREATLY reduced
the incentive to ship American jobs overseas) was dropped at
the insistence of Ronald Reagan. The exodus of manufacturing
and other American jobs started not long afterwards and
continues to this day. Our government rewards corporations
for exporting as many jobs as they can.

There may be better ways to do this, but two that come to my mind:

- Tie the high-income tax rates to unemployment so the wealthy's taxes go up
exponentially with the unemployment rate.

- Tie the maximum work hours to unemployment, so that the higher the
unemployment rate the fewer hours of overtime people can be required to work.
That'll put an end to the feast-or-famine situation I'm seeing now where so

"/> You are absolutely correct. I suspect you say this in sarcasm, but it is
the only answer if you truly believe in allowing the market to regulate
itself. We now have a labor market strictly controlled by the government to
make it easier for business to profit by the low wages of employees rather
than by producing a profitable good or service. If a business can't pay
it's employees a living wage than it SHOULD go out of business. Why should
workers and consumers have to subsidize a poorly managed business?

the initial recession and unknowns such as 9/11 that served as a double

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have read numerious post complaing about the exporting of american
&gt;&gt;jobs,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I have a very simple question for those who make such a
&gt;&gt;complaint. What
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would you do to solve the &quot;perceived&quot; problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A tax credit or other financial incentive to corporations, to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bring jobs back to America would help, among 100 other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possible solutions. Don't count on it, though, at least until we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get the current prostitutes out of office. They're too busy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; giving 87 billion of our tax dollars to a country with the world's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; third largest proven oil reserves.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a better idea.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For each job exported, a 50% tax (to the corporation) based on each lost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;salary to go into a fund to be determined. Suggestions are welcomed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's a suggestion: Go to the library and get a text on elementary
&gt;&gt;&gt; economics...read about the Law of Comparative Advantage; then once you
&gt;&gt;&gt; are at least slightly educated, come back here, and we'll let you sit
&gt;&gt;&gt; closer to the grownup's table.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ain't the truth Beautiful!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Have a Fredrick Hayek kind of day!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheerio and Hoo-Raah!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dennis, Proud America-Loving NEOCON CAPITALIST, Finest Kind

&gt;&gt;And this law became a law when? Like the law of gravity eh? You people and
&gt;&gt;your economic laws are ridiculous. The only economic laws that exist are
&gt;&gt;those we believe in and make happen. Period. Otherwise we control the
&gt;&gt;situation day by day by our actions not by some immutable law. Most of our
&gt;&gt;economic theory came into place back in the time of the robber barons to
&gt;&gt;excuse their excess and anybody who swallows the nonsense is a fool.

&gt; Try believing that when you are just one of ten who NEED...NEED... to
&gt; buy a pound of ham, and there's only one pound available for sale.
&gt; You'll learn how &quot;mutable&quot; economic laws are; you'll wish your mother

Record spending, record budget deficits, record trade deficits,
near record job losses, failure to capture bin Laden (or anyone

"/> Great source! Of course you left this part out:

&quot;Economists are virtually unanimous in saying that the tax cuts that
have taken effect so far have created jobs. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, for example, said in a recent speech: “Economic activity
perked up in late spring and then accelerated further this summer as tax
cuts provided a substantial boost to the disposable incomes of
households.” And when the Blue Chip asked economists why they had failed
to predict the size of 126,000-job gain in October, the reason they gave
more than any other was underestimating that consumers would spend such
a large proportion of “additional after-tax income resulting from tax cuts.”

&quot;Comparing the Bush economy to Hoover's Great Depression is just
silly, and implying that tax cuts are not contributing to job growth
deserves an &quot;F&quot; in Freshman economics.&quot;

Tax cuts do work, the mroe the better!

capitulated and submitted to international inspections and disarmament?
Do you consider the failure of the Clinton Administration to tackle Iraq

Arabian men taking flight lessons and who subsequently boarded four

Anyway, the right winger charge is, since the recession started

the fact that the GOP ran the House and Senate since 1995.

Somehow, the right wingers wish us to pretend, like them, that these fools

Somehow, just to get back to square 1, Bush has to do something that
creates 2.6 million jobs, which in the 10 months to go is 260,000 a month.
December saw 1000 jobs created. Last month, 112,000. But that is just to
gat back to where we were3 years ago, we need more jobs to account for
population growth, and many of the jobs lost under Bush have been replaced
with jobs far less desirable, dead end jobs with low pay and few benefits.

No president since Hoover ended an administration with less jobs that that
adminstration started with.
Bush will probably not make up 2.6 million jobs by November.

Its true. What YOU need to do, Son, is go to  www.nytimes.com , sign up for
a free account and actually read a newspaper with decent coverage of
economic issues. Today's story, the $400 billion plus trade deficit, which
is a new record and not by just a little. Economists are now warning us

&gt;&gt; And that's the BEST spin neocons have been able to put on

&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;Great source! Of course you left this part out:

&gt;&quot;Economists are virtually unanimous in saying that the tax cuts that
&gt;have taken effect so far have created jobs. Federal Reserve Chairman
&gt;Alan Greenspan, for example, said in a recent speech: “Economic activity
&gt;perked up in late spring and then accelerated further this summer as tax
&gt;cuts provided a substantial boost to the disposable incomes of
&gt;households.” And when the Blue Chip asked economists why they had failed
&gt;to predict the size of 126,000-job gain in October, the reason they gave
&gt;more than any other was underestimating that consumers would spend such
&gt;a large proportion of “additional after-tax income resulting from tax cuts.”

&gt;&quot;Comparing the Bush economy to Hoover's Great Depression is just
&gt;silly, and implying that tax cuts are not contributing to job growth
&gt;deserves an &quot;F&quot; in Freshman economics.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have read numerious post complaing about the exporting of american

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I have a very simple question for those who make such a complaint.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would you do to solve the &quot;perceived&quot; problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A tax credit or other financial incentive to corporations, to
&gt;&gt;&gt; bring jobs back to America would help, among 100 other
&gt;&gt;&gt; possible solutions. Don't count on it, though, at least until we
&gt;&gt;&gt; get the current prostitutes out of office. They're too busy
&gt;&gt;&gt; giving 87 billion of our tax dollars to a country with the world's
&gt;&gt;&gt; third largest proven oil reserves.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt; I have a better idea.

&gt;&gt; For each job exported, a 50% tax (to the corporation) based on each lost
&gt;&gt; salary to go into a fund to be determined. Suggestions are welcomed.

&gt; An even better idea is to place a tariff on goods coming into the U.S.
&gt; from American corporations running factories overseas.

&gt; It will make U.S. produced goods cheaper than the foreign goods coming
&gt; from U.S. companies, and won't violate WTO trade agreements.

"/> Or we could revise our trading agreements to mandate that any foreign
company that does business with the United States allow unions to enter
their shops. Right now, I think that's against the trading treaties.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have read numerious post complaing about the exporting of
american
&gt; jobs,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I have a very simple question for those who make such a
&gt; complaint. What
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would you do to solve the &quot;perceived&quot; problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A tax credit or other financial incentive to corporations, to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bring jobs back to America would help, among 100 other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possible solutions. Don't count on it, though, at least until we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get the current prostitutes out of office. They're too busy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; giving 87 billion of our tax dollars to a country with the world's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; third largest proven oil reserves.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a better idea.

&gt;&gt;&gt;For each job exported, a 50% tax (to the corporation) based on each
lost
&gt;&gt;&gt;salary to go into a fund to be determined. Suggestions are welcomed.

&gt;&gt; Here's a suggestion: Go to the library and get a text on elementary
&gt;&gt; economics...read about the Law of Comparative Advantage; then once you
&gt;&gt; are at least slightly educated, come back here, and we'll let you sit

"/> Omigosh ... you really do think that supply and demand works like gravity?
This fairy tale world of thought goes far to explain the world we live in.
Obviously there is a rudimentary and basic relationship between levels of
supply and demand. But these are so basic and easily manipulated as to have
no useful bearing in modern economics. Mega-corporations simultaneously
control the supply and demand of multiple commodities simply by flooding or
squelching markets. Since business now effectively controls the government,
they control the flow of commerce across borders. A good example would be
to plant yourself in the middle of Disneyland and go looking for a Pepsi.
In that microworld a Pepsi, if it could be found, might have some precious
value ... but in reality that doesn't happen because the alternatives abound
cheap and plentiful. You buy Coke because it is readily available and
affordable. There are no people fighting in the streets over black market
Pepsi. We live in a modern world of huge diversity that makes the law of
supply and demand so general as to be nearly non-existent. Even once rare
items like gold and diamonds have markets so controlled and modulated by
monopolies to control the price, thus controlling both supply and demand.
People and their actions control these variables.

You may now sit at the grownup table if you will agree to quit muttering
early 18th century economic theories.

&gt;&gt;Report: Exporting Jobs Overseas Will Help U.S.

&gt;&gt;WASHINGTON - The movement of American factory jobs and white-collar
&gt;&gt;work to other countries is part of a positive transformation that will
&gt;&gt;enrich the U.S., the Bush administration said today...

&gt;&gt;The report endorses the relatively new phenomenon of outsourcing
&gt;&gt;high-end white-collar work to India and other countries, a trend that
&gt;&gt;has created concern within affected professions such as computer
&gt;&gt;programming and medical diagnostics.

&gt;&gt;&quot;The gains from trade that take place over the Internet or telephone
&gt;&gt;lines are no different then the gains from trade in physical goods
&gt;&gt;transported by ship or plane,&quot; it says. &quot;When a good or service is
&gt;&gt;produced at lower cost in another country, it makes sense to import it
&gt;&gt;rather than to produce it domestically.&quot;...

&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; I think outsourcing Bush would be the perfect solution to the loss of jobs we
&gt; have now.

&gt;&gt;Omigosh ... you really do think that supply and demand works like gravity?
&gt;&gt;This fairy tale world of thought goes far to explain the world we live in.
&gt;&gt;Obviously there is a rudimentary and basic relationship between levels of
&gt;&gt;supply and demand. But these are so basic and easily manipulated as to have
&gt;&gt;no useful bearing in modern economics. Mega-corporations simultaneously
&gt;&gt;control the supply and demand of multiple commodities simply by flooding or
&gt;&gt;squelching markets. Since business now effectively controls the government,
&gt;&gt;they control the flow of commerce across borders. A good example would be
&gt;&gt;to plant yourself in the middle of Disneyland and go looking for a Pepsi.
&gt;&gt;In that microworld a Pepsi, if it could be found, might have some precious
&gt;&gt;value ... but in reality that doesn't happen because the alternatives abound
&gt;&gt;cheap and plentiful. You buy Coke because it is readily available and
&gt;&gt;affordable. There are no people fighting in the streets over black market
&gt;&gt;Pepsi. We live in a modern world of huge diversity that makes the law of
&gt;&gt;supply and demand so general as to be nearly non-existent. Even once rare
&gt;&gt;items like gold and diamonds have markets so controlled and modulated by
&gt;&gt;monopolies to control the price, thus controlling both supply and demand.
&gt;&gt;People and their actions control these variables.

&gt; So, what you are describing is a country (USA) where plenty
&gt; abounds...and there are multiple choices for products of a highly
&gt; similar nature. However, if one really...really...needs that Pepsi,
&gt; but can only find Coke, then their demands aren't met, and they will
&gt; continue searching for a supply of Cole.

&gt; You may obfuscate all you want with mercantilist conspiracies and

rights, ignoring the need for safety in the work place, and polluting

But hey, the economy is doing well except there are no jobs. While
Clinton created 22 million jobs, Bush has lost 2.7 million. And don't
think there will be any jobs in the future.

As well as outsourcing middle class jobs, more and more of our imports
are either being made by American and other transnational corporations
who have sweatshops, neo sweatshops or other lower cost facilities in
countries where labor costs are low, low, low. Dollar stores filled
with cheap foreign goods are growing exponentially. And it's not only
clothing and the small stuff. China is planning to get into the car
market. and the larger electronic stuff. Soon it will be hard to find
labels with &quot;made in America&quot;.

And the tax system doesn't help the workers. The tax philosphy has
changed from the old days when it was designed to keep a strong middle
class by distributing enormous wealth from the top echelons of society
to public services that benefit all of society . Nowadays the tax
cuts are geared to the rich, many of whom have said they don't want
it, e.g. Gates and Buffet. And the middle class is being eroded
while the bottom echelons are becoming more and more destitute as the
gap between rich and poor gets ever wider.

how this economy operates. President's do not have effective control of the
economy. At best they can help the economy or hurt the economy, but they do
not control the direction of the economy, the Federal Reserve Bank does by
its policies. To accuse a President, any President for the condition we
find ourselves, shows me you don't understand the dynamics at work.

&gt;&gt; The point is that there are NO rational workings of the market. It is
not
&gt;&gt; rational to allow slave, child, and elder labor. There are no rational
&gt;&gt; reasons for human beings to treat each other like animals and excuse the
&gt;&gt; behavior by blaming the market. WE control the market. Period. If we
&gt;&gt; allowed &quot;the efficacy of economic laws&quot; Attila the Hun would still be
&gt;&gt; running the world. The market says he who has all the gold rules ... do
&gt; you
&gt;&gt; want to live that way. We are headed back in that direction and it
really
&gt;&gt; sucks.

&gt; What in the world are you talking about. What has slave, child, and elder
&gt; labor got to do with the economic law of supply and demand. How does a
&quot;law
&gt; of economics&quot; affect what Attila the Hun did. You lost me on that one.

"/> You can't be this dense. Supply and demand in the purest sense would allow
those with the most muscle to enslave the weak. As they have throughout
history. Considering there will always be an overabundance of human labor
in a mechanized world ... you soon create a situation where people have to
live like slaves unless there is intervention.

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (when the LAW of supply and
demand was first lauded as an excuse) slave labor of all types was rampant
and would have continued in America today were it not for people making
change. Now we use it as an excuse to impoverish people in other countries
as well as our own.

Go back farther to the time when force ruled the world and folks like Attila
the Hun determined supply and demand because they controlled both by force
of violence. If you didn't like it you could forfeit your head. You might
anyway.

Throughout history people have used silly excuses and phony theories to
justify the greed of the haves over the have-nots. The point I have been
trying to make is that these so-called laws are no excuse for tyranny and
greed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Omigosh ... you really do think that supply and demand works like gravity?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This fairy tale world of thought goes far to explain the world we live in.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obviously there is a rudimentary and basic relationship between levels of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;supply and demand. But these are so basic and easily manipulated as to have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;no useful bearing in modern economics. Mega-corporations simultaneously
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;control the supply and demand of multiple commodities simply by flooding or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;squelching markets. Since business now effectively controls the government,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they control the flow of commerce across borders. A good example would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to plant yourself in the middle of Disneyland and go looking for a Pepsi.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In that microworld a Pepsi, if it could be found, might have some precious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;value ... but in reality that doesn't happen because the alternatives abound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cheap and plentiful. You buy Coke because it is readily available and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;affordable. There are no people fighting in the streets over black market
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pepsi. We live in a modern world of huge diversity that makes the law of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;supply and demand so general as to be nearly non-existent. Even once rare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;items like gold and diamonds have markets so controlled and modulated by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;monopolies to control the price, thus controlling both supply and demand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People and their actions control these variables.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So, what you are describing is a country (USA) where plenty
&gt;&gt;&gt; abounds...and there are multiple choices for products of a highly
&gt;&gt;&gt; similar nature. However, if one really...really...needs that Pepsi,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but can only find Coke, then their demands aren't met, and they will
&gt;&gt;&gt; continue searching for a supply of Cole.

&gt;&gt;You might want to put that bong down for a few weeks,
&gt;&gt;Sparky.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You may obfuscate all you want with mercantilist conspiracies and
&gt;&gt;&gt; using trivial examples for your illustration, but the law of supply
&gt;&gt;&gt; and demand remains extant. You have not repealed it with your facile
&gt;&gt;&gt; argument using gold and precious gems as your commodities of
&gt;&gt;&gt; necessity.

&gt;&gt;Michael is correct. The &quot;law&quot; of supply and demand exists
&gt;&gt;only as a concept inside people's brains, and is used by the
&gt;&gt;haves as a lame excuse every time they wish to justify stealing
&gt;&gt;yet again from the have nots.

&gt;&gt;Where was the &quot;law&quot; of supply and demand when our
&gt;&gt;government bailed out the savings and loan industry? Or
&gt;&gt;Chrysler? Seems this immutable &quot;law&quot; applies to some of us
&gt;&gt;but not others.

&gt;&gt;Rick

&gt; Rick, the mis-using of gov't to interfere with the rational workings
&gt; of the market doesn't obviate the efficacy of economic laws and
&gt; principles.

"/> But that's the whole point here, Dennis. &quot;Rational workings of
the market&quot;, &quot;free market&quot; etc. are concepts and exist only in
economic theory. In many cases, what we have in reality are
markets that are controlled and manipulated by small groups of
suppliers, who price their products irrespective of demand.

One example of this recently surfaced when our local oil refinery
(Tasco) was asked why our region of California is paying an
average of $.50 more a gallon for gas than the rest of the country.
Their answer? &quot;Because we can afford it.&quot; No other reason.
It has absolulely nothing to do with demand, the rule of thumb
is and always has been, &quot;Gouge the consumer as much as
possible&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Michael is correct. The &quot;law&quot; of supply and demand exists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;only as a concept inside people's brains, and is used by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;haves as a lame excuse every time they wish to justify stealing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;yet again from the have nots.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Where was the &quot;law&quot; of supply and demand when our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;government bailed out the savings and loan industry? Or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chrysler? Seems this immutable &quot;law&quot; applies to some of us
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but not others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick, the mis-using of gov't to interfere with the rational workings
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the market doesn't obviate the efficacy of economic laws and
&gt;&gt;&gt; principles.

&gt;&gt; But that's the whole point here, Dennis. &quot;Rational workings of
&gt;&gt; the market&quot;, &quot;free market&quot; etc. are concepts and exist only in
&gt;&gt; economic theory. In many cases, what we have in reality are
&gt;&gt; markets that are controlled and manipulated by small groups of
&gt;&gt; suppliers, who price their products irrespective of demand.

&gt;&gt; One example of this recently surfaced when our local oil refinery
&gt;&gt; (Tasco) was asked why our region of California is paying an
&gt;&gt; average of $.50 more a gallon for gas than the rest of the country.
&gt;&gt; Their answer? &quot;Because we can afford it.&quot; No other reason.
&gt;&gt; It has absolulely nothing to do with demand, the rule of thumb
&gt;&gt; is and always has been, &quot;Gouge the consumer as much as
&gt;&gt; possible&quot;.

&gt; Do you have any idea what you are talking about. If a company raises it
&gt; prices, the user can, either pay the price, or don't.

"/> Sure, I'll just walk the 40 miles to my office.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> See above.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If they reduce their consumption, that oil company will soon

&gt; between supply and demand.

"/> Yes it is. And very simply that is all that it is. It is not a &quot;reason&quot;

The context in which this argument flared was that it was in itself a reason
to explain why it was considered OK to ship American jobs overseas. That
these economic theories make it right and inevitable that jobs flow to
lowest cost. The lowest cost labor is slave labor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Omigosh ... you really do think that supply and demand works like
&gt; gravity?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This fairy tale world of thought goes far to explain the world we
&gt; live in.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obviously there is a rudimentary and basic relationship between
&gt; levels of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;supply and demand. But these are so basic and easily manipulated
as
&gt; to have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;no useful bearing in modern economics. Mega-corporations
&gt; simultaneously
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;control the supply and demand of multiple commodities simply by
&gt; flooding or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;squelching markets. Since business now effectively controls the
&gt; government,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they control the flow of commerce across borders. A good example
&gt; would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to plant yourself in the middle of Disneyland and go looking for a
&gt; Pepsi.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In that microworld a Pepsi, if it could be found, might have some
&gt; precious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;value ... but in reality that doesn't happen because the
&gt; alternatives abound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cheap and plentiful. You buy Coke because it is readily available
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;affordable. There are no people fighting in the streets over
black
&gt; market
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pepsi. We live in a modern world of huge diversity that makes the
&gt; law of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;supply and demand so general as to be nearly non-existent. Even
&gt; once rare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;items like gold and diamonds have markets so controlled and
&gt; modulated by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;monopolies to control the price, thus controlling both supply and
&gt; demand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People and their actions control these variables.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, what you are describing is a country (USA) where plenty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abounds...and there are multiple choices for products of a highly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar nature. However, if one really...really...needs that Pepsi,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but can only find Coke, then their demands aren't met, and they
will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; continue searching for a supply of Cole.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You might want to put that bong down for a few weeks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sparky.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You may obfuscate all you want with mercantilist conspiracies and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using trivial examples for your illustration, but the law of supply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and demand remains extant. You have not repealed it with your

the seller to either lower the prices and stop gouging by threat of force,
or the user could simply take the product. We, by means of government,
regulate what the buyer and seller may do. We do not allow the user any
such leverage by enforcing monopoly laws against big oil. In fact, for some
lame brain reason, we put big oil in the White House.

The point that you are missing is that these economic laws can and have been
manipulated. Currently in the favor of the producer. If you live without
mass-transit (which is most of America) than you must buy energy and the
cost of that energy has been hugely inflated by taxes and gouging. We can
affect that by electing different people.

GEEEEZ... People, get real. It's so simple:

Change your PSYCHOLOGY, and there WILL be millions of jobs!

Anyday now...

Under Fire Over Jobs, Bush Hones Upbeat Message
Mon February 16, 2004 04:16 PM ET

TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - President Bush stepped up a counter-offensive
against his Democratic rivals on the economy, boldly talking up the
recovery on Monday to counter complaints about the unemployed and jobs
moving overseas.

Contrary to recent polls and the election-year charges of his
presidential challengers, Bush said there was an &quot;undeniable&quot; sense of
optimism about the economy.

Democrats accused the Republican president of being out of touch.
Nearly 2.8 million factory jobs have been lost since Bush took office
and the issue looms large ahead of November's vote.

During a 49-minute round-table at a Tampa window and door factory,
Bush described the economy as &quot;strong&quot; four times, expressed optimism
repeatedly, and said how &quot;upbeat&quot; he was another four times.

Democratic presidential front-runner John Kerry countered that such
appearances were more about &quot;creating photo opportunities than job
opportunities.&quot;

Bush acknowledged that &quot;a lot of economic growth depends upon the
psychology of the people making decisions all throughout our economy.&quot;

He did his part on Monday to shape that &quot;psychology.&quot;

&quot;You can say, 'Well of course, they just pick the upbeat people.'
Well, the truth of the matter is people are pretty upbeat all over the
country. That's what I'm here to report to you,&quot; he said.

Bush's goal is to reverse his slide in recent polls by boosting
confidence in his economic stewardship.

An ABC News/Washington Post survey released on Friday found Bush at a
low point in public approval, his popularity depressed by questions
about the Iraq war, continued economic frustration and interest in his
leading Democratic rival.

In his remarks at NuAir Manufacturing in Tampa, Bush steered clear of
negative economic news, including a recent report showing Americans
turned increasingly cautious on the economy. Analysts say weak jobs
creation has dampened consumer confidence despite a strengthening U.S.
economy.

Bush seized on NuAir's hopes to hire 40 more workers this year. &quot;Forty
workers here, five workers there, begin to add up,&quot; he said. It was
his 19th visit to the state as president.

Sen. Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, derided Bush's two-day visit to
the state that was at the center of the 2000 ballot recount
controversy. &quot;Had he spent a little more time, he would have seen some
of the suffering people,&quot; he said.

'THINGS ARE LOOKING BETTER'

Bush made no mention of the controversy surrounding the chairman of
the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Gregory Mankiw, who
praised the shifting of U.S. jobs abroad.

&quot;The facts bear me out,&quot; Bush said. &quot;The last six months of growth
have been tremendous. Housing starts are way up. Inflation is low.
Interest is low. New jobs are being created ... Things are looking
better for America.&quot;

&quot;There's an optimism in our country that is undeniable,&quot; he added.
&quot;The key question is: Are we wise enough to ... keep the policies in
place that encourage growth.&quot;

He called on Congress to make his tax cuts permanent -- a move
Democrats say will benefit the rich and increase an already record
$500-billion-plus budget deficit.

Bush did his part for the Tampa economy on Sunday night.

After mixing with the masses at the Daytona 500 stock-car race, the
president and his wife settled in at Tampa's exclusive Bern's Steak
House with local political allies.

The restaurant's dinner menu boasts $60.68 porterhouse steaks, golden
Iranian caviar for $92 a serving, and 150- to 200-year-old bottles of
wine including an 1851 Gruaud Larose for $10,000.

&gt;And I would take your explanation one step further if I may: Market forces
&gt;do not carry any inherent inevitability or predestined outcome. Market
&gt;outcomes are a result of human behavior not of some inevitable result of
&gt;supply or demand. WE can often (not always) decide the supply or the demand
&gt;if we so choose and the market will react to that choice.

"/> Damn, you make a hell of a lot more sense than Scott And/Or Janet
(what an unusal name). Of course, we always decide what is in &quot;short
supply&quot;..one twig in a forest is of no value, but one pound of ham in
a famine is priceless. No one needs the stick, everyone needs the
ham...that's supply and demand. Market forces driven by human needs.
Very rational.

&gt;as well as our own.

&gt;Go back farther to the time when force ruled the world and folks like Attila
&gt;the Hun determined supply and demand because they controlled both by force
&gt;of violence. If you didn't like it you could forfeit your head. You might
&gt;anyway.

&gt;Throughout history people have used silly excuses and phony theories to
&gt;justify the greed of the haves over the have-nots. The point I have been
&gt;trying to make is that these so-called laws are no excuse for tyranny and
&gt;greed.

"/> Puh-leeze...don't trot out that old, hoary chestnut. Slavery has
always been a most ineffiecient means of production. Why the hell do
you think the industrial revoluton succeeded so spectacularly?
Machines out-produce humans every time. Market forces will always
drive out economics-driven slavery.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Omigosh ... you really do think that supply and demand works like gravity?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This fairy tale world of thought goes far to explain the world we live in.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obviously there is a rudimentary and basic relationship between levels of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;supply and demand. But these are so basic and easily manipulated as to have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;no useful bearing in modern economics. Mega-corporations simultaneously
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;control the supply and demand of multiple commodities simply by flooding or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;squelching markets. Since business now effectively controls the government,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they control the flow of commerce across borders. A good example would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to plant yourself in the middle of Disneyland and go looking for a Pepsi.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In that microworld a Pepsi, if it could be found, might have some precious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;value ... but in reality that doesn't happen because the alternatives abound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cheap and plentiful. You buy Coke because it is readily available and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;affordable. There are no people fighting in the streets over black market
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pepsi. We live in a modern world of huge diversity that makes the law of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;supply and demand so general as to be nearly non-existent. Even once rare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;items like gold and diamonds have markets so controlled and modulated by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;monopolies to control the price, thus controlling both supply and demand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People and their actions control these variables.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, what you are describing is a country (USA) where plenty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abounds...and there are multiple choices for products of a highly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar nature. However, if one really...really...needs that Pepsi,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but can only find Coke, then their demands aren't met, and they will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; continue searching for a supply of Cole.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You might want to put that bong down for a few weeks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Sparky.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You may obfuscate all you want with mercantilist conspiracies and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using trivial examples for your illustration, but the law of supply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and demand remains extant. You have not repealed it with your facile
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; argument using gold and precious gems as your commodities of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Michael is correct. The &quot;law&quot; of supply and demand exists
&gt;&gt;&gt;only as a concept inside people's brains, and is used by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;haves as a lame excuse every time they wish to justify stealing
&gt;&gt;&gt;yet again from the have nots.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Where was the &quot;law&quot; of supply and demand when our
&gt;&gt;&gt;government bailed out the savings and loan industry? Or
&gt;&gt;&gt;Chrysler? Seems this immutable &quot;law&quot; applies to some of us
&gt;&gt;&gt;but not others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick

&gt;&gt; Rick, the mis-using of gov't to interfere with the rational workings
&gt;&gt; of the market doesn't obviate the efficacy of economic laws and
&gt;&gt; principles.

&gt;But that's the whole point here, Dennis. &quot;Rational workings of
&gt;the market&quot;, &quot;free market&quot; etc. are concepts and exist only in
&gt;economic theory. In many cases, what we have in reality are
&gt;markets that are controlled and manipulated by small groups of
&gt;suppliers, who price their products irrespective of demand.

&gt;One example of this recently surfaced when our local oil refinery
&gt;(Tasco) was asked why our region of California is paying an
&gt;average of $.50 more a gallon for gas than the rest of the country.
&gt;Their answer? &quot;Because we can afford it.&quot; No other reason.
&gt;It has absolulely nothing to do with demand, the rule of thumb
&gt;is and always has been, &quot;Gouge the consumer as much as
&gt;possible&quot;.

&gt;Rick

"/> Rick, I used this sentence in another reply, but it works here as
well: &quot;That's why there are always going to be those who try to become
suppliers, and as soon as they do, the price of that which is in
demand goes down.&quot; It's always been that way in a free market, and
always will. Bet you're already looking for another gas station.

Certainly in Eastern Europe and Russia, communism and socialism is either
gone or fading.

the transition from communism, and is today an old fashioned free market

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The point is that there are NO rational workings of the market.
It
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rational to allow slave, child, and elder labor. There are no
&gt;&gt; rational
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons for human beings to treat each other like animals and
excuse
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior by blaming the market. WE control the market. Period.
If
&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allowed &quot;the efficacy of economic laws&quot; Attila the Hun would still
&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; running the world. The market says he who has all the gold rules
&gt; ...
&gt;&gt; do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want to live that way. We are headed back in that direction and
it
&gt;&gt;&gt; really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sucks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What in the world are you talking about. What has slave, child, and
&gt;&gt; elder
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; labor got to do with the economic law of supply and demand. How
does
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;law
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of economics&quot; affect what Attila the Hun did. You lost me on that
&gt; one.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You can't be this dense. Supply and demand in the purest sense would
&gt;&gt; allow
&gt;&gt;&gt; those with the most muscle to enslave the weak. As they have
throughout
&gt;&gt;&gt; history. Considering there will always be an overabundance of human
&gt; labor
&gt;&gt;&gt; in a mechanized world ... you soon create a situation where people
have
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; live like slaves unless there is intervention.

&gt;&gt; I don't think you know what you are talking about. The economic law of
&gt;&gt; supply and demand is very simply an effort to define the relationship
&gt;&gt; between supply and demand.

&gt; Yes it is. And very simply that is all that it is. It is not a &quot;reason&quot;
&gt; for what happens but an explanation of what might happen or has happened.
&gt; The context in which this argument flared was that it was in itself a
reason
&gt; to explain why it was considered OK to ship American jobs overseas. That
&gt; these economic theories make it right and inevitable that jobs flow to
&gt; lowest cost. The lowest cost labor is slave labor.

"/> So what? The fact is that you either compete or you go broke. If you go
broke there are no winners, only losers. Unless you want to construct a
barrier against all foriegn goods coming into this country. Then what
happens, well of course, the U.S. producers have no incentive to lower their
cost. As for your statement that these jobs are &quot;slave labor&quot;, aren't you
being just a wee bit over dramatic. If you were in a country where they
have no opportunities, and are barely surviving, and someone offers you a
job that pays you more than you would otherwise get, is that slave labor...I
think not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obviously there is a rudimentary and basic relationship between

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;squelching markets. Since business now effectively controls the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they control the flow of commerce across borders. A good
example
&gt;&gt; would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to plant yourself in the middle of Disneyland and go looking for
a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In that microworld a Pepsi, if it could be found, might have
some

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;value ... but in reality that doesn't happen because the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;affordable. There are no people fighting in the streets over

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pepsi. We live in a modern world of huge diversity that makes
the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;supply and demand so general as to be nearly non-existent. Even
&gt;&gt; once rare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;items like gold and diamonds have markets so controlled and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;monopolies to control the price, thus controlling both supply
and
&gt;&gt; demand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People and their actions control these variables.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, what you are describing is a country (USA) where plenty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abounds...and there are multiple choices for products of a highly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar nature. However, if one really...really...needs that
Pepsi,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but can only find Coke, then their demands aren't met, and they
will

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Michael is correct. The &quot;law&quot; of supply and demand exists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;only as a concept inside people's brains, and is used by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;haves as a lame excuse every time they wish to justify stealing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;yet again from the have nots.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Where was the &quot;law&quot; of supply and demand when our

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chrysler? Seems this immutable &quot;law&quot; applies to some of us

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick, the mis-using of gov't to interfere with the rational workings
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the market doesn't obviate the efficacy of economic laws and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; principles.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But that's the whole point here, Dennis. &quot;Rational workings of

&gt;&gt;&gt; economic theory. In many cases, what we have in reality are

soon
&gt;&gt; react by doing something to increase the rate of consumption, i.e.
reduce
&gt;&gt; their price. No company can survive if no one is willing to buy their

&gt; But the &quot;user&quot; is not confined to those options. The user could also tell
&gt; the seller to either lower the prices and stop gouging by threat of force,
&gt; or the user could simply take the product. We, by means of government,
&gt; regulate what the buyer and seller may do. We do not allow the user any
&gt; such leverage by enforcing monopoly laws against big oil. In fact, for
some
&gt; lame brain reason, we put big oil in the White House.

prusue monopoly actions against then is not possible, because unless you can

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The point that you are missing is that these economic laws can and have
been
&gt; manipulated. Currently in the favor of the producer. If you live without
&gt; mass-transit (which is most of America) than you must buy energy and the
&gt; cost of that energy has been hugely inflated by taxes and gouging. We can
&gt; affect that by electing different people.

"/> No you cannot. In Hawaii, they are going to try and &quot;regulate&quot; the price of
oil that comes into the state. The method of choice is to tie the selling
price of gasoline to the west coast price for a barrel of oil. The problem
with this scheme is it probably will not work, because oil can be brought
from a variety of places. What happens when the cost of a barrel of oil is
say Indonesia, is lower than the west coast price of oil. Well, of course,
the oil companies in the state are going to bring in their oil from
Indonesia. And even if the oil companies buy their oil from west coast
facilities, what is the state going to do if the west coast price is higher
than the world price for a barrel of oil. Price controls do not work and
have never worked over a long period of time.

&gt;&gt; Rick, I used this sentence in another reply, but it works here as
&gt;&gt; well: &quot;That's why there are always going to be those who try to become
&gt;&gt; suppliers, and as soon as they do, the price of that which is in
&gt;&gt; demand goes down.&quot; It's always been that way in a free market, and
&gt;&gt; always will. Bet you're already looking for another gas station.

&gt; How many new oil or energy companies have you seen in the U.S.
&gt; (or elsewhere for that matter) in the past half century? Aside from
&gt; mergers, aquisitions etc, the answer is close to NONE. And even
&gt; if you were to start one tomorrow, do you suppose the existing
&gt; cartels would allow your company to get beyond the borders of
&gt; your home town? Do you suppose you'd be given an office, IN
&gt; THE FREAKING WHITE HOUSE, right next to George W.'s,
&gt; as Ken Lay was?

&gt; The same state of affairs is true for everything from credit markets
&gt; to entertainment networks to auto manufacturers, home appliances,
&gt; pharmaceutical producers, food producers and most every other
&gt; market. True &quot;free market economy&quot; is dead and has been since
&gt; the 1960's.

&gt; My brother, who was an investment banker for over 30 years has
&gt; his own phrase to describe it: &quot;socialism for the rich, and capitalism
&gt; for the poor&quot;. THAT'S the state of the &quot;free market&quot; in the U.S.,
&gt; and that's also the reason why the predominant form of government
&gt; in the world today, by far, is socialism and not capitalism. America
&gt; will eventually be faced with a choice -- to eventually become
&gt; socialist or greed itself to death. As horrible as that first option is,
&gt; if you want to see the results of the other choice, watch a film called
&gt;&quot;Soylent Green&quot;, where a tiny group of megarich corporate robber
&gt; barons are supported by 200 million minimum wage burger sloppers.
&gt; We're already further along that road than most people realize or
&gt; would be willing to admit.

"/> Interesting statement. Do you realize that the fastest growing segment of
our economy is small businesses, not large businesses.

&gt;&gt; Yes it is. And very simply that is all that it is. It is not a
&quot;reason&quot;
&gt;&gt; for what happens but an explanation of what might happen or has
happened.
&gt;&gt; The context in which this argument flared was that it was in itself a
&gt; reason
&gt;&gt; to explain why it was considered OK to ship American jobs overseas.
That
&gt;&gt; these economic theories make it right and inevitable that jobs flow to
&gt;&gt; lowest cost. The lowest cost labor is slave labor.

&gt; So what? The fact is that you either compete or you go broke. If you go
&gt; broke there are no winners, only losers. Unless you want to construct a
&gt; barrier against all foriegn goods coming into this country. Then what
&gt; happens, well of course, the U.S. producers have no incentive to lower
their
&gt; cost. As for your statement that these jobs are &quot;slave labor&quot;, aren't you
&gt; being just a wee bit over dramatic. If you were in a country where they
&gt; have no opportunities, and are barely surviving, and someone offers you a
&gt; job that pays you more than you would otherwise get, is that slave
labor...I
&gt; think not.

"/> I had hoped a chain of irrefutable logic would make sense to you. Let's try
again.

The lowest cost labor is slave labor. Yes? I did not say anybody was a
slave or that any slaves were currently laboring ... we can argue that
later. Simply. The lowest cost labor is slave labor. An unfettered
economy seeking the lowest cost labor would seek the lowest cost of labor
(even fettered ones do, but for the sake of pure argument). So seeking the
lowest cost to produce goods the labor eventually has to be free in order to
compete. Free labor is usually forced. Many people would call such forced
labor without recompense ... slave labor. Can we agree that far?

Why would this not be the inevitable outcome of free, unfettered trade that
you declare the law of supply and demand would regulate?

Plan, President Clinton cut taxes on 15 million low-income families
and made tax cuts available to 90 percent of small businesses, while
raising taxes on just 1.2 percent of the wealthiest taxpayers.

"/> The recession's been over for almost two years. But it's rather hard to tell
unless you're well off. If you work for a living it's business as usual.

Just my opinion, but I believe Greenspan put the brakes on our economy in
1999 when he consistently raised interest rates in the face of sharply
rising energy costs. It had nothing to do with Clinton or GW.

not control the economy. If the economy is growing, jobs will be created.
If the economy is not growing, not enough jobs are created. Let us put it
this way. If say some President comes up with a series of policies, such as
the WPA program, it will only work if the Federal Reserve Bank plays along
with the game. But while the President can create such a policy, the
Federal Reserve can cut the legs right out from under that policy by simply
slowing down the growth of money supply, or greatly incresing the discount
rate.

"/> Again, at the fringes, yes, by reducing the deficit he did help the economy.
But once again, that worked because inflation was relatively low, and the
Federal Reserve Bank stood on the sidelines. But the simple fact is, that a
growing economy has a tendency to result in inflation rearing its ugly head.
When that happens, the Federal Reserve Bank steps in and tries to reign in
the possibility (which is one of their primary responsibilities), which is
exactly what they started to do toward the end of the Clinton Admistration.
Spend some time and do some research. You will see that the Federal Reserve
started to take actions to slow down the economy long before Bush came into
office. The last part of your message is a political message which I will
not respond to...sorry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes it is. And very simply that is all that it is. It is not a
&gt;&quot;reason&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; for what happens but an explanation of what might happen or has
&gt; happened.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The context in which this argument flared was that it was in itself a
&gt;&gt; reason
&gt;&gt;&gt; to explain why it was considered OK to ship American jobs overseas.
&gt; That
&gt;&gt;&gt; these economic theories make it right and inevitable that jobs flow to
&gt;&gt;&gt; lowest cost. The lowest cost labor is slave labor.

&gt;&gt; So what? The fact is that you either compete or you go broke. If you
go
&gt;&gt; broke there are no winners, only losers. Unless you want to construct a
&gt;&gt; barrier against all foriegn goods coming into this country. Then what
&gt;&gt; happens, well of course, the U.S. producers have no incentive to lower
&gt; their
&gt;&gt; cost. As for your statement that these jobs are &quot;slave labor&quot;, aren't
you
&gt;&gt; being just a wee bit over dramatic. If you were in a country where they
&gt;&gt; have no opportunities, and are barely surviving, and someone offers you
a
&gt;&gt; job that pays you more than you would otherwise get, is that slave
&gt; labor...I
&gt;&gt; think not.

&gt; I had hoped a chain of irrefutable logic would make sense to you. Let's
try
&gt; again.

&gt; The lowest cost labor is slave labor. Yes? I did not say anybody was a
&gt; slave or that any slaves were currently laboring ... we can argue that
&gt; later. Simply. The lowest cost labor is slave labor. An unfettered
&gt; economy seeking the lowest cost labor would seek the lowest cost of labor
&gt; (even fettered ones do, but for the sake of pure argument). So seeking
the
&gt; lowest cost to produce goods the labor eventually has to be free in order
to
&gt; compete. Free labor is usually forced. Many people would call such
forced
&gt; labor without recompense ... slave labor. Can we agree that far?

"/> No, it is just the lowest cost labor. You can chose to call it slave labor
if you wish. That is a matter of definition of what the term means. My
dictionary defines the word &quot;slave&quot; as &quot;a human being who is owned as
property by another and is absolutely subject to his will&quot;. That is what I
mean when I think of as a slave. And yes, businesses generally want to pay
the lowest wages they can to produce or sell their product. So what? And I
would argue with your use of the phrase &quot;free labor is actually forced&quot;. No
one &quot;forces&quot; someone to work for the wages they are paid. They &quot;accept&quot; the
wages they are paid, to survive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Why would this not be the inevitable outcome of free, unfettered trade
that
&gt; you declare the law of supply and demand would regulate?

"/> The law of supply and demand does not &quot;regulate&quot; anything. It is simply a
way to predict what will happen.

Feb. 20, 2004
As jobs vanish, U.S. is an agricultural colony
By Pat Buchanan

Sen. John Edwards did not win Wisconsin, but he closed a huge gap with
John Kerry with astonishing speed in the final week.

The issue propelling Edwards was jobs, the lost jobs under George
Bush, and Edwards' attribution of blame for the losses on NAFTA and
the trade deals for which John Kerry voted in Congress.

Edwards has plugged into an issue that could cost Bush his presidency.
Indeed, Kerry's sudden conversion into fiery critic of trade deals for
which he himself voted suggests that he senses not only his
vulnerability on Super Tuesday, but his opportunity in the fall.

For a precise measure of what this issue is about, one can do no
better than to consult Charles McMillion of MGB Services. Each
February, McMillion methodically pulls together from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics his grim annual index of the decline and fall of the
greatest industrial republic the world had ever seen.

Since Bush's inauguration, 2.8 million U.S. manufacturing jobs have
simply vanished. By industry, the job losses are heaviest in
computers, where 28 percent of all the manufacturing jobs that existed
when Bush took office are gone, semiconductors where we have lost 37
percent, and communications equipment, where jobs losses have reached
39 percent in just three years.

One in three textile and apparel jobs has disappeared, and the losses
continue to run at the rate of 100,000 jobs a year. This helps to
explain Edwards' rout of Kerry in South Carolina.

With the markets soaring, the Bush recovery is being called a jobless
recovery. Not so. We are creating millions of jobs overseas -- even as
we are destroying manufacturing jobs at a rate of 77,000 per month in
the United States.

Consider: Last year, we bought $958 billion worth of
foreign-manufactured goods and our trade deficit in manufactures alone
was more than $400 billion, more than $1 billion a day. Millions of
foreign workers now labor in plants that manufacture for America,
doing jobs that used to be done by American workers.

Not so long ago, Detroit was the auto capital of the world and the
United States was the first nation in the production of TVs.

We don't make TVs anymore. Our trade deficits in cars, trucks, TVs,
VCRs, automatic data processing equipment and office machines added up
last year to $218 billion. We retain a trade surplus in airplanes and
airplane parts, but, because of the competition from Airbus, that is
shrinking.

After airplanes, our No. 1 export in terms of a trade surplus is . . .
soybeans. Corn is next, followed by wheat, animal feeds, cotton, meat,
metal ore, scrap, gold, hides and skins, pulp and waste paper,
cigarettes, mineral fuels, rice, printed materials, coal, tobacco,
crude fertilizer and glass. Airplanes aside, the United States has the
export profile of an agricultural colony.

To neoconservatives of the Wall Street Journal school, these trade
numbers are yardsticks of their success at creating a global economy
and measures of their triumph in championing NAFTA and the World Trade
Organization. To the Old Right, however, manufacturing was a critical
component of American power, indispensable to our sovereignty and
independence, and the access road for working Americans into the
middle class.

Seeing the devastation of NAFTA and its progeny, sensing rising
opportunity in the industrial Midwest, Democrats are jumping ship on
free trade. Bush, if he does not temper his enthusiasm for these
one-sided trade deals, may just go down with it. If he does, one prays
he will at least ensure the neoconservatives have first been locked
securely in the cargo hold.

Well, thanks alot Pat. If those hundreds of seniors in Palm Beach Co. FL hadn't
voted for you by mistake in 2000 (that goofy butterfly ballot). Maybe things
would be different now.

&gt; As jobs vanish, U.S. is an agricultural colony
&gt; By Pat Buchanan

&gt; Sen. John Edwards did not win Wisconsin, but he closed a huge gap with
&gt; John Kerry with astonishing speed in the final week.

&gt; The issue propelling Edwards was jobs, the lost jobs under George
&gt; Bush, and Edwards' attribution of blame for the losses on NAFTA and
&gt; the trade deals for which John Kerry voted in Congress.

&gt; Edwards has plugged into an issue that could cost Bush his presidency.
&gt; Indeed, Kerry's sudden conversion into fiery critic of trade deals for
&gt; which he himself voted suggests that he senses not only his
&gt; vulnerability on Super Tuesday, but his opportunity in the fall.

&gt; For a precise measure of what this issue is about, one can do no
&gt; better than to consult Charles McMillion of MGB Services. Each
&gt; February, McMillion methodically pulls together from the Bureau of
&gt; Labor Statistics his grim annual index of the decline and fall of the
&gt; greatest industrial republic the world had ever seen.

&gt; Since Bush's inauguration, 2.8 million U.S. manufacturing jobs have
&gt; simply vanished. By industry, the job losses are heaviest in
&gt; computers, where 28 percent of all the manufacturing jobs that existed
&gt; when Bush took office are gone, semiconductors where we have lost 37
&gt; percent, and communications equipment, where jobs losses have reached
&gt; 39 percent in just three years.

&gt; One in three textile and apparel jobs has disappeared, and the losses
&gt; continue to run at the rate of 100,000 jobs a year. This helps to
&gt; explain Edwards' rout of Kerry in South Carolina.

&gt; With the markets soaring, the Bush recovery is being called a jobless
&gt; recovery. Not so. We are creating millions of jobs overseas -- even as
&gt; we are destroying manufacturing jobs at a rate of 77,000 per month in
&gt; the United States.

&gt; Consider: Last year, we bought $958 billion worth of
&gt; foreign-manufactured goods and our trade deficit in manufactures alone
&gt; was more than $400 billion, more than $1 billion a day. Millions of
&gt; foreign workers now labor in plants that manufacture for America,
&gt; doing jobs that used to be done by American workers.

&gt; Not so long ago, Detroit was the auto capital of the world and the
&gt; United States was the first nation in the production of TVs.

&gt; We don't make TVs anymore. Our trade deficits in cars, trucks, TVs,
&gt; VCRs, automatic data processing equipment and office machines added up
&gt; last year to $218 billion. We retain a trade surplus in airplanes and
&gt; airplane parts, but, because of the competition from Airbus, that is
&gt; shrinking.

&gt; After airplanes, our No. 1 export in terms of a trade surplus is . . .
&gt; soybeans. Corn is next, followed by wheat, animal feeds, cotton, meat,
&gt; metal ore, scrap, gold, hides and skins, pulp and waste paper,
&gt; cigarettes, mineral fuels, rice, printed materials, coal, tobacco,
&gt; crude fertilizer and glass. Airplanes aside, the United States has the
&gt; export profile of an agricultural colony.

&gt; To neoconservatives of the Wall Street Journal school, these trade
&gt; numbers are yardsticks of their success at creating a global economy
&gt; and measures of their triumph in championing NAFTA and the World Trade
&gt; Organization. To the Old Right, however, manufacturing was a critical
&gt; component of American power, indispensable to our sovereignty and
&gt; independence, and the access road for working Americans into the
&gt; middle class.

&gt; Seeing the devastation of NAFTA and its progeny, sensing rising
&gt; opportunity in the industrial Midwest, Democrats are jumping ship on
&gt; free trade. Bush, if he does not temper his enthusiasm for these
&gt; one-sided trade deals, may just go down with it. If he does, one prays
&gt; he will at least ensure the neoconservatives have first been locked
&gt; securely in the cargo hold.
