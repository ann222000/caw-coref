Yes, your right about that but I do need help; not because I'm angry a
lot but because I've rarely beeen angry (or at least been conscious of
it) in my entire life. I have wondered how come I don't get angry at
certain things but since I've been finally recovering from this last
bout of depression, I know that I probably do get very angry on an
unconscious level, just don't accept the anger &amp; submerge it.

I've recently read that depression can be anger turned inwards &amp; that
makes a lot of sense in my case. Lately, it's been sort of erupting at
odd times when I even scare myself with the intensity. I need to be
able to express it *more* often, but in appropriate ways &amp; for
appropriate reasons. When my ex phones up even now, I still talk to
him in such a really nice, passive way &amp; yet can suddenly feel so much
anger at people I read about in the news - that's just inappropriate.
I really would like to be able to be in a room with him tied up &amp; kick
&amp; punch him but  I know even if I could, I wouldn't &amp; that is just so
frustrating.

Was ex-hubby into sadomaschism? Actually I can imagine you as a tubby
dominatrix. What about the yank and his nice donkey, when he tells
you to &quot;kiss my ass&quot; do you kick it and then claim you misheard him?
If so then that is animal cruelty, I don't approve.

Naw no SM, it's just I wouldn't be able to get near enough to do him
