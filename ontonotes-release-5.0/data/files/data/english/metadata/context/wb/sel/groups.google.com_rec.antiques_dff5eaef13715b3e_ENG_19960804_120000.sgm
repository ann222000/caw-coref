We did an outdoor show yesterday, a monthly flea market that always
draws a big crowd of people who like to spend money on nice things.
99% of the people we talk to are wonderful, but yesterday we met the
Roseville-by-the-inch expert.

You see, I have these two Baneda pieces. One is pink, a little over
five inches tall; the other green, about four and a half inches tall.
Both are priced at just over $300. So I had them out at this show.
I also had out a pink Foxglove piece, approximately the same size as
the Baneda pieces, priced at $75.

Maybe I should also mention that I've bought and sold in excess of
200 pieces of Roseville, many different patterns, at what many people
reading this newsgroup can attest are extremely reasonable prices.
Maybe I shouldn't be, but I'm proud of that. I don't try to gouge
people.

So I'm wrapping something up when I hear this man start to &quot;educate&quot;
my partner who (unfortunately for her) had asked if she could help
him with anything. He's complaining--loudly--about the prices on the
Baneda pieces. &quot;Rosevilles of this size always go for a lot less than
that,&quot; he insists. &quot;Every show I've been to, a Roseville goes for much
much less than that.&quot;

He picks up the Foxglove piece. &quot;Now, THIS ONE is much more reasonably
priced.&quot;

I called out, &quot;Perhaps you're not familiar with the pattern of the other
two pieces.&quot;

&quot;No, I'm not,&quot; he admitted. (I thought that was the end of it.) He
continues, &quot;So you looked these up in some book? And that's how you
came up with those prices?&quot;

I lost it.

&quot;I've been offered $500 for the pair, by a dealer,&quot; I snapped, and
turned away until I was sure he was gone.

So now he's probably telling all his buddies about this nasty dealer.

You know, I don't have any problem with people coming up to me and saying,
&quot;I wonder if you can clear up something for me...I don't know that much
about pottery. Why is this one pink piece $75 and the other $300?&quot; I'm
happy to share what I know with people who honestly want to learn. And
I think most fair-minded knowledgeable dealers are that way.

"/> I'm not sure I understand *that* one entirely myself, except that it
seems to go 1) blue 2) brown 3) green. At least around here.

"/> Yep, that seems to be the deal everywhere. The only fun fact I know of
(and it's one of those things that I can't remember where I heard it, so
take it for what it's worth, OK?) is that Frank Ferrell (the designer) was
supposedly fondest of the green color scheme and insisted that the pieces
coming out of the new mold (ie. the crispest and best molds) be decorated
in the green colors. It does seem to hold that if you look at the green
pine cone line, the quality of the molding consistently is very good. B-
