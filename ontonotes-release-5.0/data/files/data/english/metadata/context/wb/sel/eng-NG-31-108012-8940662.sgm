Picked up a nice marrow bone with surrounding meat, little over a
pound. Thinking about making a vegetble beef soup around it. Should I
brown it first. Wife likes a clear broth, unrouxed, but I could
probably brown it to pick up some flavor without muddying the broth.
She's not a complainer. What'dya think?  Would you do something else
with the bone and meat?

Saw/Cut it in slices, roast it and serve it with sea salt and crusty bread !

Have it cut into 3&quot; segments and feed it to my dogs who would
collectively gain several hours of very cheap entertainment, not to
mention a good tooth cleaning.

I'd brown the bones in the oven then make the beef stock.  You can always
clarify the stock once it's cooled down.

Would extract the marrow to make marrow dumplings!

I always brown the bones and leftover meat in the oven. Add an onion cut in
half. That will add flavor and darken the stock. Also, ask your butcher for
a veal bone to go along with it. It adds the richness home mad stock should
have.
