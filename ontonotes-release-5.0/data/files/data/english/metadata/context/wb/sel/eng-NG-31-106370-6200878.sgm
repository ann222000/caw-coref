Ex husband shouldn't receive half for house?

My father lent my husband and me an interest free loan for $72,000 in 1987
to buy our house (cost, $75,000), which is now paid off. Our monthly
payments were $400 (applied to principle only). I am now getting a divorce.
The house is worth $150,000; my husband wants me to pay him half of that,
since I am keeping the house. I now have to borrow the $75,000 from my
father again to pay my husband his half of the value. I don't feel it's fair
for my husband to calculate the full fair market value, since he would have
much less equity without my father's help. My CPA calculated that my father
lost $100,552 in compounded interest ($64,800 simple interest) had his money
been invested at 6%.

We prepared a hypothetical amortization on the note over 40 years (we couldn
't use 30 years because the monthly payment would be over $400). The present
balance on the note using this hypothetical amortization is $54,072.  Do I
have any legal merit in arguing any of these?

1) The house should be valued at less than FMV

2) My husband's equity would be less without the interest free loan from my
father?

3) My father gifted the interest to me, so the gifted interest should be
excluded from the marital assets to be divided.

Any other ideas, anyone?

I might argue that you bought the house together and paid for it together,
so now you should split it 50/50.  But it's a divorce.  Logic doesn't count.
The only question is "Can your lawyer beat up his lawyer".

depends on your state.   In CA that loan would have been to the two of you
and he'd get half the present value of the house if the money you used to
pay back the loan came from "onerous" income ie work.

whoops didn't see that other stuff.  You say it's a 'loan' but a loan is not
a loan without interest.  But that's only for the IRS.  So it might be
considered a gift.. but probably not since you in fact paid it back.

The other poster was correct in the sense that family law is a court of
equity not law so the judge can do pretty much what he wants.  You could
argue it that's for sure but again all this might change if you're in a
strange state like Louisiana with different laws.

Hire a couple of independent appraisers and see if hubby is even close.
To my knowledge, interest on a loan is a never a factor in determing FMV.
What he wants, and will get from a judge are two different things.

.   Not a lawyer but also divorced.   The only chance you had to
keep any of your father's loan/gift wholly in your name was to keep it
totally separate,  in your name only during the course of the marriage.
You didn't.  You merged it into your joint marital assets.

The lawyers will hammer out a property settlement which
approximates a 50/50 split and the judge will essentially rubber stamp
the agreement.   Mine was 42/58 to be exact but that's life.   The
larger wage earner tends to come out on the lower side of these splits.

You are in a divorce.   By definition,  you are under stress and not
thinking clearly.  Don't fixate on each and every topic that comes up.
Note that the more you fight over each and every item,   the higher
your lawyer fees.    One of my friends had a bit too much acrimony in
her divorce and ended up with a $20,000 lawyer bill back in the 1980's.

Try for counseling if you can afford it.   The important thing is
figuring out how to get on with your life afterwards.

Why?  You can take a home equity loan.  You can also sell the house and
put the $75,000 proceeds in your pocket.

None of your arguments have any legal or logical merit.  Read on.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1) The house should be valued at less than FMV
">

The house is worth what it is worth.  The source of the purchase money
has no bearing on its value.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) My husband's equity would be less without the interest free loan from my
&gt; father?
">

As you say, this argument is hypothetical.  You are basing it on events
that did not occur.  Therefore it is irrelevant.  Besides, your equity
would be less too, so it's a wash.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3) My father gifted the interest to me, so the gifted interest should be
&gt; excluded from the marital assets to be divided.
">

He did no such thing.  He never received any interest and he had no
right to it.  He cannot give something he never owned, so there was no
gift.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Any other ideas, anyone?
">

Let's assume, for argument's sake, that you had taken a regular
mortgage to buy the house.  All the interest on the mortgage would be
money down the drain, and the marital estate would be that much poorer.
The same would be true if your father had charged interest.

You are trying to re-write history.  Twenty years ago your father did
something nice for you and your husband, and you are now trying to
steal his share of the benefit.  No unbiased judge will buy what you
are selling.  Make these arguments and I can assure you that not only
will you lose on this issue, but you will also lose credibility, so the
judge will scrutinize everything else you say much more closely.

Assuming you live in a community property state, your husband is entitled to
half the house since you were married during the time you paid off the
purchase money loan.  In determining asset distribution on a divorce, it is
irrelevant whether you paid interest on the loan.

The house should be valued at FMV.

The equity would be less had you taken out a regular mortgage, but you
didn't.  The law deals in what actually occurred, not what might have
occurred.

There was no gift, but a loan with a term of 0% interest.  There is no duty
to charge interest, so 0% interest would not be a gift.

That's incorrect.  On related party loans, the IRS will impute interest
unless the loan meets one of the exceptions. See IRS Publication 550.

Your conclusion is correct, but your reasoning is not.  The elements of
a gift are intent, delivery, and acceptance.  Duty is irrelevant.

There was no gift in this case because there was no delivery, and
(arguably) because there was no donative intent.

Sure, he would have had less equity without your father's help. So would
you. How would it be any different if y'all still owed 50K on the house with
a conventional loan? You each still get half the 100K of equity - he'd get
50K, and you'd get the house plus responsibility for the remaining 50K on
the loan. Then part of the cost of your divorce is that you'd be borrowing a
total of 100K instead of 75K. Now aren't you glad that house is paid for?

When a couple divorces in a non-community-property state (I assume this is
the case) each takes roughly half of the couple's joint assets. The exact
ratio can be determined by negotiation and settlement or by fighting it out
in the courts. But either way, like it or not, your soon-to-be-ex husband is
going to end up with about half the current market value of the house. You
can either take out another mortgage and pay him, or sell the house and
divide the proceeds.

Not long ago while taking a crowded commuter train into a nearby large
city, I overheard one (tasteless) commuter apparently in her
mid-thirties yell across the car to another (equally tasteless)
neighbor, "How much did yours cost?" to which the other answered,
"Just under two hundred - how about you?" to which the initiator
responded, "Forty-five in the first month then, over the next year or
so, another two hundred or so, but I think it will be over soon."

It quickly became apparent to the involuntary "audience" members,
captive fellow commuters, that the "yours" and "it" referred to were
divorce litigations and that these two were bragging to more than
commiserating with one another about which had paid more to his and
her respective divorce lawyers in terms of orders of magnitude of
thousands of dollars.
