I have to hide my love away?
Help!

n case you hadn't heard, the Beatles blow. They're overrated
lightweights who aren't as influential as certain pivotal punk bands,
and they're to blame for all that soft rock commemorated in the latest
Time Life Music infomercial. And those Sgt. Pepper costumes are, let's
face it, cornier than any boy-band outfit of the '90s.

Of course, what you have heard and already know is that Beatle-bashing
is as old as the Beatles' music itself: They've been derided by
everyone from Lou Reed to incensed Christians. Lately, though, rampant
Beatle-dissing has taken on an intensity and force it never had
before. The impetus for much of it has been the fortieth anniversary
of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which produced not only the
expected media nostalgia wave but a storm of revisionist thinking. And
the backlash will only grow louder when Julie Taymor's eye roll-
inducing movie musical Across the Universe arrives on September 14.

In a New York Times op-ed, no less a pop classicist than Aimee Mann
admitted she loved the album as a child but now feels it's missing
&quot;emotional depth,&quot; that &quot;John Lennon's melodies feel a bit
underwritten while Paul McCartney's relentless cheerfulness is
depressing.&quot; On Salon, rock writer Gina Arnold weighed in, &quot;There's a
number of current bands that you can say, 'These guys like Sgt.
Pepper,' but they're oddballs, like the Polyphonic Spree.&quot; So the
album's legacy amounts to a bunch of toga-clad, faux-cheery ironists:
Ouch.

Simultaneously, the Internet burst with &quot;Beatles are overrated&quot;
threads that went to the heart of the band itself. &quot;When you really
think about it, they were a good but not great pop band,&quot; wrote a
Slate letter writer: &quot;A little lite [sic] and fluffy, a bit quirky,
but not much else,&quot; and certainly, the writer added, not nearly as
good as the Stones, the Clash, Jeff Buckley, or Radiohead. On the same
page, another reader argued that Beatle music &quot;has not aged well&quot; and
that their influence &quot;has been limited to soft pop acts and perhaps
Oasis.&quot; Others called their music irritating--or, in the words of a 27-
year-old writing to Salon, &quot;a bore, a relic, and decidedly tame.&quot;

My first encounter with this mindset occurred not long ago, when I was
working at a national entertainment magazine. During a group email
exchange about which boxed sets to include in a roundup, our thirty-
something editors explained that a Beatles collection could be
excluded--not because it was a repackaging of old albums but because,
as one said, &quot;they're the worst band in history&quot; and, the other added,
&quot;everybody knows they suck.&quot; They are, and we do?

Across the Universe won't help matters. The film exhumes every '60s
cliché imaginable: Earnest kid gets drafted. Naïve suburban waif gets
caught up with The Revolution and sees the error of the Man's ways.
Greenwich Village blues mama becomes ersatz Janis. Greenwich Village
blues guitar virtuoso becomes ersatz Jimi. Throughout, the characters,
even the Jimi and Janis clones, break out into &quot;Come Together,&quot; &quot;All
You Need Is Love,&quot; and other Fab songs. It's almost enough to make you
wish John met Paul in school but decided he was a simp and couldn't be
bothered forming a band with him.

The Beatles have long been a focal point for those who analyze All
That Went Wrong with Our Culture, dating back to the record burnings
that ensued when Lennon mused that his band commanded a larger fan
base than the Son of the Almighty. In her new anti-boomer screed The
Death of the Grown-Up, Washington Times columnist Diana West
essentially accuses the Beatles of murder: Paul McCartney singing
about &quot;California grass&quot; in &quot;Get Back,&quot; she writes, was &quot;downright
dangerous, prefiguring the explosion in drug use that destroyed
thousands of lives.&quot; A recent report on CNN about born-again teenagers
quoted one saying he had to stop listening to the band because they
&quot;had a negative effect&quot; on him due to the music's connection with
&quot;sex, drugs, and violence.&quot;

The idea that the Beatles, of all people, would embody debauchery is
laughable; they weren't exactly the first gangsta rappers. But what's
at work now is different. It's generational revolt. More than ever,
the Beatles are the flashpoint for overbearing boomer culture. The
post-boomers, namely Gen X, are sick of it, and perhaps rightly so;
they have their own heroes to trumpet, like the Clash or the Police
or, as the same Radiohead-loving Slate correspondent dared to bring
up, Adam and the Ants.

Up to a point, the Beatle bashers make persuasive arguments. As more
than one blogger has proclaimed, the Ramones feel a lot more
influential these days; you can hear their aural footprints all over
grunge, Green Day, and emo. The Beatles' influence amounts to ...
Fountains of Wayne? Look at what melody has come down to in pop: the
smarmy come-ons of Maroon 5. Sgt. Pepper itself is responsible for
enough bad knockoffs to fill an iPod, from XTC to Madonna's &quot;Dear
Jessie&quot;, quite possibly the most cloying thing she's ever put on
record.

While I'm no Gen Xer, I can relate. I tired of hearing the Beatles
years ago, after my older sister, a proud boomer, played every single
one of their LPs to death. The fact that my mother loved &quot;Penny Lane&quot;
and would sing it around the house only added to the uncoolness of
those four musical comics from England. It's no wonder that, at an
early age, I gravitated toward my own music--copies of the Stones' Hot
Rocks 1964-1971 and Sticky Fingers, my version of &quot;alt rock.&quot;

Yet what's absurd about the current argument--what truly sucks, as my
former editor would've put it--is that it amounts to an attempt to
rewrite history based on a generational grudge. To be annoyed by the
Beatles is one thing; it would be nice indeed if classic-rock radio
wouldn't play &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; on a daily basis. But to
dismiss them?

All the grousing made me dig back into records I hadn't heard since
the CD came into play. The band's early covers, like &quot;Roll Over
Beethoven&quot; and &quot;Please Mister Postman,&quot; still sound insubstantial. To
modern high-fidelity ears, albums like Help! and Revolver feel as
crudely made as Dust Bowl ballads--or, in the case of the White Album,
as disjointed as a latter-day Wu-Tang Clan disc. But an equal number
of rediscoveries awaited me: the ominous, bad-day-coming vibe of
Lennon's White Album songs, the unashamed (and glorious)
sentimentality of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; (the orchestrated Phil
Spector take, incidentally, not the emaciated version on Let It Be ...
Naked), the still-rousing &quot;It's Getting Better,&quot; the exquisite melody
of &quot;She's Leaving Home,&quot; the snarl always tucked inside Harrison's
songs. We can only hope OK Computer sounds so good in 2020.

Rehearing the music made me realize that what's suspect about the
Beatles these days isn't their image, or even their ubiquity. It's
what else I heard in those records: beauty, sincerity, earnestness.
You can still hear that impulse in the indie balladeer wave that began
with the late, Beatle-admiring Elliott Smith and has been carried on
by the Shins, Death Cab for Cutie, and Sufjan Stevens, among others.
But in the culture at large, they all still feel fairly marginal, and
in an age where everything cheesy is revered--where the likes of Bret
Michaels and Scott Baio are faux-celebrated kitsch icons largely
because they're associated with utter crap--the Beatles and everything
they stand for can feel hopelessly outdated. Listening back to Sgt.
Pepper, I was nostalgic not for the Summer of Love but for humanity
and soul--music that didn't glorify hostility or rage but looked for a
way to imagine it all getting better, all the time.

Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly referred to
the song &quot;Come Together&quot; as &quot;Get Together.&quot;

This article is laughable.  It sets up all these straw dog arguments
(people don't like the Beatles because they represent mainstream
culture--everyone knows the Ramones are more influential now) and
intentionally confuses slagging the Beatles with thinking Sgt. Pepper
is over-rated.   I mean, we're supposed to take seriously, as points
of argument, unnamed entertainment writers who say things like

This is the New Republic.  Aren't they famous for making shit up?

This is the trippiest section from the Salon article/interview:

&quot;And if you think of the Beatles/Rolling Stones debate, the Stones won
that in every possible way -- in terms of long life and record sales
and influence -- and yet, they're impossible to like. I think the
greatest proof there is no God is that most of the Ramones are dead
and most of the Rolling Stones aren't. It's just so wrong. The same
could be said for the Beatles. Why are half the Beatles dead and Mick
Jagger and Keith Richards still alive? Are you there, God?&quot;

The Beatles were one of the first boy bands - the idols of cream &amp;
scream.  Prior to which, sheer presence points to Elvis, a roots shift
of native black Motown from delta-blues inspiration.   Elvis Pelvis, a
moot point by a time &quot;bad boys&quot; Stones arrived.  That can of worms, by
then, had been already opened. Fully.

Maybe it was B.B. King who said country was cousin to blues;- he also
said, he was no rock star when he started, that he had to go to
women's homes to sing to get some, instead of the other way around.
Come to think of it, he left something a prodigy and extended, nuclear
family.

I suppose country music once may have carried a larger significance to
national listening audiences. An influx to blues, rhythm, and soul
appears in keeping more of recent with the advancement of liberalism
and leeway given freedom of expression since the Medieval Ages. One
step for man and one generation at a time.

Frizz to shred, disco ducked into rap, grunge came, saw, and dust
becomes dust before the phoenix of creation, all interesting and
extensive evolvements;- as someone may plausibly have explained why
the beat goes on, to a sound of walking in boots, simply to be all
over you.

As for a 200-year-rock left standing by milestones to a future class
reformation, can't say.  If I might, though, I'd stick this over the
Beatles for an epitome (alt-mooies speaking): Cameron Crowe's Almost
Famous, before long last making a momentary post-Beatles observance;-
and, upon that particular tome, a note of respect if lingeringly to
say, &quot;Damn, Sam, shame he wasn't born a few years earlier.&quot;

I actually am - although a very specific one.  I like specific songs a
lot, and dislike almost everything else they did a lot.  I think that,
being the most famous, influential etc pop group ever means they're
open to a massive amount of revaluation.  Anyone who is credited with
the 'best ever' or 'first ever' this or that is bound to have those
positions questioned after a time.  I think perhaps what separates
them from Dylan is the fact that the Beatles' hype was there from the
start, whereas I think Dylan's hype has built up more in retrospect.
Perhaps that's because he was 'difficult' from the beginning, whereas
even a controversial record like SPLHCB was a massive hit almost
immediately wasn't it?  Anyway, I listen to far more of the Stones -
because I like rock 'n' roll far more than whatever it was the Beatles
produced after 1966 - and think that the Stones are open to far less
criticism because they were never credited with as much in the first
place (only 'the greatest rock 'n' roll band in the world', which I
think they probably were).  I don't think they've produced a great
record since 1978 at least, but Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky
Fingers and Exile On Main St are peerless albums

'Emotional Rescue' I've found to be very good lately, if one
rearranges the song order...  The cover art is a large part of its
alienation, but very prophetic in a pre-massive-MTV-pop way...

&gt; Time Life Music infomercial. And those Sgt. Pepper costumes are, let's
&gt; face it, cornier than any boy-band outfit of the '90s.

&gt; Of course, what you have heard and already know is that Beatle-bashing
&gt; is as old as the Beatles' music itself: They've been derided by
&gt; everyone from Lou Reed to incensed Christians. Lately, though, rampant
&gt; Beatle-dissing has taken on an intensity and force it never had
&gt; before. The impetus for much of it has been the fortieth anniversary
&gt; of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which produced not only the
&gt; expected media nostalgia wave but a storm of revisionist thinking. And
&gt; the backlash will only grow louder when Julie Taymor's eye roll-
&gt; inducing movie musical Across the Universe arrives on September 14.

&gt; In a New York Times op-ed, no less a pop classicist than Aimee Mann
&gt; admitted she loved the album as a child but now feels it's missing
&gt; &quot;emotional depth,&quot; that &quot;John Lennon's melodies feel a bit
&gt; underwritten while Paul McCartney's relentless cheerfulness is
&gt; depressing.&quot; On Salon, rock writer Gina Arnold weighed in, &quot;There's a
&gt; number of current bands that you can say, 'These guys like Sgt.
&gt; Pepper,' but they're oddballs, like the Polyphonic Spree.&quot; So the
&gt; album's legacy amounts to a bunch of toga-clad, faux-cheery ironists:
&gt; Ouch.

&gt; Simultaneously, the Internet burst with &quot;Beatles are overrated&quot;
&gt; threads that went to the heart of the band itself. &quot;When you really
&gt; think about it, they were a good but not great pop band,&quot; wrote a
&gt; Slate letter writer: &quot;A little lite [sic] and fluffy, a bit quirky,
&gt; but not much else,&quot; and certainly, the writer added, not nearly as
&gt; good as the Stones, the Clash, Jeff Buckley, or Radiohead. On the same
&gt; page, another reader argued that Beatle music &quot;has not aged well&quot; and
&gt; that their influence &quot;has been limited to soft pop acts and perhaps
&gt; Oasis.&quot; Others called their music irritating--or, in the words of a 27-
&gt; year-old writing to Salon, &quot;a bore, a relic, and decidedly tame.&quot;

&gt; My first encounter with this mindset occurred not long ago, when I was
&gt; working at a national entertainment magazine. During a group email
&gt; exchange about which boxed sets to include in a roundup, our thirty-
&gt; something editors explained that a Beatles collection could be
&gt; excluded--not because it was a repackaging of old albums but because,
&gt; as one said, &quot;they're the worst band in history&quot; and, the other added,
&gt; &quot;everybody knows they suck.&quot; They are, and we do?

&gt; Across the Universe won't help matters. The film exhumes every '60s
&gt; clich� imaginable: Earnest kid gets drafted. Na�ve suburban waif gets
&gt; caught up with The Revolution and sees the error of the Man's ways.
&gt; Greenwich Village blues mama becomes ersatz Janis. Greenwich Village
&gt; blues guitar virtuoso becomes ersatz Jimi. Throughout, the characters,
&gt; even the Jimi and Janis clones, break out into &quot;Come Together,&quot; &quot;All
&gt; You Need Is Love,&quot; and other Fab songs. It's almost enough to make you
&gt; wish John met Paul in school but decided he was a simp and couldn't be
&gt; bothered forming a band with him.

&gt; The Beatles have long been a focal point for those who analyze All
&gt; That Went Wrong with Our Culture, dating back to the record burnings
&gt; that ensued when Lennon mused that his band commanded a larger fan
&gt; base than the Son of the Almighty. In her new anti-boomer screed The
&gt; Death of the Grown-Up, Washington Times columnist Diana West
&gt; essentially accuses the Beatles of murder: Paul McCartney singing
&gt; about &quot;California grass&quot; in &quot;Get Back,&quot; she writes, was &quot;downright
&gt; dangerous, prefiguring the explosion in drug use that destroyed
&gt; thousands of lives.&quot; A recent report on CNN about born-again teenagers
&gt; quoted one saying he had to stop listening to the band because they
&gt; &quot;had a negative effect&quot; on him due to the music's connection with
&gt; &quot;sex, drugs, and violence.&quot;

&gt; The idea that the Beatles, of all people, would embody debauchery is
&gt; laughable; they weren't exactly the first gangsta rappers. But what's
&gt; at work now is different. It's generational revolt. More than ever,
&gt; the Beatles are the flashpoint for overbearing boomer culture. The
&gt; post-boomers, namely Gen X, are sick of it, and perhaps rightly so;
&gt; they have their own heroes to trumpet, like the Clash or the Police
&gt; or, as the same Radiohead-loving Slate correspondent dared to bring
&gt; up, Adam and the Ants.

&gt; Up to a point, the Beatle bashers make persuasive arguments. As more
&gt; than one blogger has proclaimed, the Ramones feel a lot more
&gt; influential these days; you can hear their aural footprints all over
&gt; grunge, Green Day, and emo. The Beatles' influence amounts to ...
&gt; Fountains of Wayne? Look at what melody has come down to in pop: the
&gt; smarmy come-ons of Maroon 5. Sgt. Pepper itself is responsible for
&gt; enough bad knockoffs to fill an iPod, from XTC to Madonna's &quot;Dear
&gt; Jessie&quot;, quite possibly the most cloying thing she's ever put on
&gt; record.

&gt; While I'm no Gen Xer, I can relate. I tired of hearing the Beatles
&gt; years ago, after my older sister, a proud boomer, played every single
&gt; one of their LPs to death. The fact that my mother loved &quot;Penny Lane&quot;
&gt; and would sing it around the house only added to the uncoolness of
&gt; those four musical comics from England. It's no wonder that, at an
&gt; early age, I gravitated toward my own music--copies of the Stones' Hot
&gt; Rocks 1964-1971 and Sticky Fingers, my version of &quot;alt rock.&quot;

&gt; Yet what's absurd about the current argument--what truly sucks, as my
&gt; former editor would've put it--is that it amounts to an attempt to
&gt; rewrite history based on a generational grudge. To be annoyed by the
&gt; Beatles is one thing; it would be nice indeed if classic-rock radio
&gt; wouldn't play &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; on a daily basis. But to
&gt; dismiss them?

&gt; All the grousing made me dig back into records I hadn't heard since
&gt; the CD came into play. The band's early covers, like &quot;Roll Over
&gt; Beethoven&quot; and &quot;Please Mister Postman,&quot; still sound insubstantial. To
&gt; modern high-fidelity ears, albums like Help! and Revolver feel as
&gt; crudely made as Dust Bowl ballads--or, in the case of the White Album,
&gt; as disjointed as a latter-day Wu-Tang Clan disc. But an equal number
&gt; of rediscoveries awaited me: the ominous, bad-day-coming vibe of
&gt; Lennon's White Album songs, the unashamed (and glorious)
&gt; sentimentality of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; (the orchestrated Phil
&gt; Spector take, incidentally, not the emaciated version on Let It Be ...
&gt; Naked), the still-rousing &quot;It's Getting Better,&quot; the exquisite melody
&gt; of &quot;She's Leaving Home,&quot; the snarl always tucked inside Harrison's
&gt; songs. We can only hope OK Computer sounds so good in 2020.

&gt; Rehearing the music made me realize that what's suspect about the
&gt; Beatles these days isn't their image, or even their ubiquity. It's
&gt; what else I heard in those records: beauty, sincerity, earnestness.
&gt; You can still hear that impulse in the indie balladeer wave that began
&gt; with the late, Beatle-admiring Elliott Smith and has been carried on
&gt; by the Shins, Death Cab for Cutie, and Sufjan Stevens, among others.
&gt; But in the culture at large, they all still feel fairly marginal, and
&gt; in an age where everything cheesy is revered--where the likes of Bret
&gt; Michaels and Scott Baio are faux-celebrated kitsch icons largely
&gt; because they're associated with utter crap--the Beatles and everything
&gt; they stand for can feel hopelessly outdated. Listening back to Sgt.
&gt; Pepper, I was nostalgic not for the Summer of Love but for humanity
&gt; and soul--music that didn't glorify hostility or rage but looked for a
&gt; way to imagine it all getting better, all the time.

&gt; Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly referred to
&gt; the song &quot;Come Together&quot; as &quot;Get Together.&quot;

The Stones lose the last two, and most other areas as well.  The &quot;long life&quot;

The long hair was a big deal.  John and Yoko were famously naked on an album
cover (among other events).  Not that this should be construed as the
embodiment of debauchery.  The Stones were more overtly sexual, as was Jimi,
Janis, Jimbo, a few others.

Deconstruction time.  Whoever said the Stones is impossible to like
never played a blues scale or has any appreciation for Chuck Berry,
roots Ron credits a practised style (simplistic, in a sense, the way
he also explains tuning his guitar).  Our writer obviously is
establishing his age-gender, bent/proclivity, having already stated he
in as much hates the Stones, (fundamental Aristolean, this/that
plurality construct), alluding to his personal preference and
spiritual awaking, (sic as to all people), since man evolved from
chimps, to begin swaying beneath an ancient full moon symbolic of
rhythmic chanting, for untold possibly transcendental, orgiastic
delights.   Personally, I wouldn't know, having never actually hung
from the rafters with the Ramones in a NYC club basement, which I'll
nonetheless grant him in good stead.  He then asks if God is here.
Yes, I must assure him, should anyone care kindly to convey my
regards. God's power exists alive and well in music;-- Indeed, our
Ramones friend need only look so far to a church choir assemblage to
see all its evolutionary glory (sans all orgiastic references in lieu
of sanctified matrimony, but of course);-- Forms which tend transcend
by means of cosmic ascendancy from base prose and become verses of
harmonized accord in so strikingly posed listeners.

don't believe you can accurately guage the beatles impact on pop music

1964, frankie avalon and fabian were playing played on the radio.
kennedy was dead and all kinds of shit was about to go down. dylan
heard the same thing that millions of others heard. something was
happening here. the decade of the 60's really did change the world;
not the way some people wanted it but change the world it did. people
are still living off the table scraps of the sixties. it was so much
more than the music of the beatles, it was a phenomenon in the truest
sense of the word.
you really had to have been there to fully grasp the great cultural
impact this band made on the world of popular music and on society as
a whole.

With the exception of rap and maybe punk, after the Beatles and even
up through now, people aren't quite certain what to do that is wildly
different.  The Beatles and other similar music of that explosive
period are a hard act to follow.  The shift from jazz to rock--as
popular music-- was extremely dramatic and nothing that dramatic has
been repeated since then.  But I got the impression that this article
was more a backlash against Sgt. Pepper's.  I think that record was
the first to be made after the death of their manager, Brian Epstein.
Lennon complained that McCartney took over the band and made himself
leader, pissing off the John-ster.  He assumed control of everything
and Lennon groused that the others just had to dutifully look up to
him.  Could be.  Who knows.  But this might explain the comparative
weakness of Sgt Pepper's--when compared against White Album, Revolver,
Rubber Soul.  I believe that the real blasts in that record were the
Harrison sitar trk and the Lennon car crash/acid song.  Especially in
the Lennon song you could see the extent they could go with irony in a
rock song if they really wanted to when describing the &quot;scene&quot; and the
contempo world they saw.  I wonder if Brother Bob even reached quite
as far as that song in any of his trks.  But most everything else in
Sgt P's was kind of art production and gimmicks, methinks.  Sort of
musical hall crap.  A much better use of old English music hall songs
to ironically set off fractured romances and fractured lives is Dennis
Potter's &quot;Cream In My Coffee,&quot; a British TV drama (for anyone who's
interested).  An absolute gem.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; groups determined to luxuriate in their prolonged adolescent rebellion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and struggling mightily but fruitlessly to more firmly establish their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; own wispy sense of cultural identity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; not like it was in your day?

&gt; &gt; Bunch of crap - every day has to go through that.  More or less.  Only
&gt; &gt; thing different about the beatles was things were ripe then, due for a
&gt; &gt; change.  It happens.  The music more or less meant more, some of the
&gt; &gt; times but not all times, to some but not all peoples.

&gt; ......

&gt; &gt; Think of all the present forms of music and what that would mean to
&gt; &gt; attention given them, if all that shifted into another stage of
&gt; &gt; change, and perception a people see affecting them.  Yes, they too,
&gt; &gt; may be singing Penny Lane in their own way.  Doesn't mean a damn
&gt; &gt; whether you or I like seeing changes.

&gt; With the exception of rap and maybe punk, after the Beatles and even
&gt; up through now, people aren't quite certain what to do that is wildly
&gt; different.  The Beatles and other similar music of that explosive
&gt; period are a hard act to follow.  The shift from jazz to rock--as
&gt; popular music-- was extremely dramatic and nothing that dramatic has
&gt; been repeated since then.  But I got the impression that this article
&gt; was more a backlash against Sgt. Pepper's.  I think that record was
&gt; the first to be made after the death of their manager, Brian Epstein.
&gt; Lennon complained that McCartney took over the band and made himself
&gt; leader, pissing off the John-ster.  He assumed control of everything
&gt; and Lennon groused that the others just had to dutifully look up to
&gt; him.  Could be.  Who knows.  But this might explain the comparative
&gt; weakness of Sgt Pepper's--when compared against White Album, Revolver,
&gt; Rubber Soul.  I believe that the real blasts in that record were the
&gt; Harrison sitar trk and the Lennon car crash/acid song.  Especially in
&gt; the Lennon song you could see the extent they could go with irony in a
&gt; rock song if they really wanted to when describing the &quot;scene&quot; and the
&gt; contempo world they saw.  I wonder if Brother Bob even reached quite
&gt; as far as that song in any of his trks.  But most everything else in
&gt; Sgt P's was kind of art production and gimmicks, methinks.  Sort of
&gt; musical hall crap.  A much better use of old English music hall songs
&gt; to ironically set off fractured romances and fractured lives is Dennis
&gt; Potter's &quot;Cream In My Coffee,&quot; a British TV drama (for anyone who's
&gt; interested).  An absolute gem.

&gt; &gt; Bottom line is without &quot;our days&quot; we'd be effectively a nation
&gt; &gt; focused, united and overtly racist, (MLK/JFK never would have been
&gt; &gt; born), and we'd be the only superpower in the world still shaking its
&gt; &gt; ass at the expense of dumb inner-city and clod-hopper attrition rates.
">

I wasn't after personality or political aspects of the Fab Four, no
doubt with a few twists and turns amid the labyrinths and intrigues.
Somewhere in there, can't offhand precisely say it's Sgt. Pepper's,
the Beatles did feel influenced by a responsive artistic pressure of
wunderkind genius, Beach Boys' Brian Wilson (one freaky
autobiography).  Yep - Sgt. Pepper's was definitely real trippy groovy
stuff compared to post-WW2 leather slick Teddy Boys.  Max something or
other doing cover art illustrations, probably gained it's broadest
influence following Monte Python's Flying Circus.  Oh, all that crap
was great back then, loose clothes, bell bottoms, and everything else,
at least while it lasted.  PBS dug some ancient archival Stones
footage out of a trashbag, lot of people I'd imagine have seen,
playing recently for sponsorship promotion airings.  What a way to
test out a recent HDTV broadcast.  What a look on Jagger's face, very
naive, young and innocent, a sweet smile for his very own special
party and part of something happening;- polished musicianship, too,
for the band at an early stage.

I agree.  I don't think it's within a broader peoples' choice to
determine artistically what to do at any given time, any more than a
notable general or conqueror is given the elective choice to be
great.  Times and occurrences randomly cast for fate to the lot, a
free-for-all and meld as to who rises with the mettle to meet
occasions within contingencies.

That's true. But it doesn't really detract from the point - McCartney
had taken over leadership of the band by the time Peppers was recorded.
McCartney wanted to create a concept lp and the album started off that
way. But the others got tired of trying to make their songs fit into a
concept, so the idea was pretty much abandoned, but the Pepper
intro/outro and &quot;Little Help&quot; remained as book-ends to the majority of
the album. The real weakness in the record was just the selection of songs.

It was the Magical Mystery Tour where McCartney's leadership really
began to piss off the others. By the White Album they were a group in
name only. Their peak was not Sgt Pepper's but Revolver. They still
wrote good songs after that, but no lp of theirs was as strong end to
end as Revolver.

Many great songs after Revolver.  In my view the albums that followed were
at least as good as Revolver, except for Let It Be and (US only / greatest
hits) Magical Mystery Tour.  Also the US &amp; UK versions were different before
Pepper.  Pepper had the biggest single impact of any rock album, with the
possible exception of Meet The Beatles.  Their most enduring album over the
years is Abbey Road.

The larger point above, I think, was that Brian was the glue of the
whole operation, the wizard who sold the band to the rest of the
world, the stage manager (which he was before he began to work at a
record store, and what he always wanted to be)...  Also, he was
squarely in John's corner and recognized John as the leader of the
group...

Magical Mystery Tour on many levels is more enjoyable than Sgt
Pepper's.  The songs placed in this seemingly whimsical, sugary
confection are real standouts:  Strawberry Fields, All You Need Is
Love, Hello Goodbye, Fool On the Hill, Penny Lane, Your Mother Should
Know, and so forth.  The songs are fun, spontaneous, ironic, melodic,
alive.  Sgt Pepper's is dour by comparison. One of the first things
you see on the cover is four guys at a funeral.  If Mystery Toru was
conceptually not all there, well then it was a brilliant mistake and I
give them points for trying and  creating a blueprint for the bigger
concept efforts that would follow by other bands.

Yes, there were many great songs after Revolver. But that's why I put in
the qualifier of &quot;strong end to end&quot;.

Sgt Peppers is roundly criticized anymore. I like the songs but agree
that the album is overrated. MMT just sucked. Some of the songs were
good, but I remember even way back being disappointed with that lp.

Now had The Beatles listened to George Martin The White Album may have
been reduced down to one LP that could have been kick-ass. And they
would still have had plenty of material for LIB and things may have gone
differently. As it is White is a good collection with some crummy
material added in.

Abbey Road may be their most popular album with most today, but
Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Octopus's Garden weaken it.

But, now you're also correct about the british/US lps.  When I say
Revolver was their strongest album, I'm talking about the British
release. The American Record Companies really did a number on that album.

And while they were touring Brian did have a lot of say. But when they
stopped touring Brian's influence waned. He was against the Pepper LP
cover but was overridden.

There's a lot to be said for the argument that The Beatles had matured,
were becoming more and more individualized and the differences that
came between them would not have been manageable by Epstein anymore than
they were by Martin.

That is what George said about the White Album, it 4 guys each taking turns
