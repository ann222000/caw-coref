Greetings from St. Alexis'!  Wednesday is Ash Wednesday, the end of the
Epiphany season and the beginning of Lent.  In  the church calendar Lent is a
penetial season that last forty days (plus Sundays) that is set aside for
preparation for Easter. Most people think of Lent as a time of "giving up something" -
snacks,caffine, TV).  It's fine to do that, but it's better to think of it as
a time to rethink your life.  You might take on something, add something,
subtract something.  We're called to live a particular kind of life: a life of
compassion, truth, purpose, joy, finding its focus in relationship with God and
each other.  What's standing between you and that kind of life?  Experiment
some and feel the deep joy of Easter.

Here's this week's news:

****The Tuesday before Ash Wednesday is know for more than drinking a lot in
New Orleans.  It's also called Shrove Tuesday and is a traditional time for
pancake suppers in many churches.  We're having a lazy Shrove Tuesday Pancake
Supper for - but not at - St. Alexis.  Meet us at IHOP on the I-55 N west
frontage road for pancakes and a variety of syrups, served in a gloriously tacky
atmosphere.  7:00 this Tuesday night

**** Wednesday night we are having our Ash Wednesday service of Imposition of
Ashes and Holy Eucharist.  Come experience the power of the liturgy as we
enter into the spirit and season of Lent.  The service begns at 6:30.  This week
there will not be a supper or our Soul Food conversation.

**** Next week Soul Food will meet at 6:30 for supper and at 7:00 for
conversation as usual.  There is one new and exciting feature: our conversation will
be led by Bishop Duncan Gray.  The Bishop is an excellent teacher and has a
clear vision of what he hopes St. Alexis will become.  It's an unusual chance to
spend time with the Bishop in a small group setting.   Make your plans to be
there.

****We are in an exciting time in our life as a community.  Attendance is
growing and so are our opportunities.  We need your skills, thoughts and
imagination as we move forward!  Please get involved with one of our planning groups.
Here are the areas groups are forming around: Evangelism (advertising,
community presence, inviting); Outreach/Ministry (ways to make a difference in the
world); Social/Hospitality (what will we do for fun/how will we welcome
visitors and help them enter our circle); Building Development (what do we do
next/how do we do it?); Children's Ministries (for the children we have and those yet
to come - nursery, classes, etc.); Study/Formation (opportunities to learn
and share); Pastoral Ministries (how do we care for each other).  Please
consider using your skills in one or more areas.  You can join in by e-mailing or
talking to me.

****Upcoming events: St. Paddy's Day: 5-k for runners, walkers and spectators
and later in the day a St. Alexis celebration in tandem with the big parade.
Serving lunch at Stewpot - Sunday, March 11 at 12:30.
March 31/April 1: Anti-Racism Event at St. Alexis'.  And in April, the
Bishop's formal visitation with baptisms and confirmation and Holy Week services and
Easter Vigil.  More info on all that soon.

Have a holy Lent!

Peace,

Chuck

Have a holy Lent. Chuck, if anyone in your group has to work nights and
can't get to your 6:30 service on Ash Wed., we're having 2 services at
UMC they're welcome to attend. The first is at 7 a.m. in the new chapel
in the new hospital (the one closest to N. State St.). The 2nd one is at
noon in the Nelson Student Union Bldg upstairs (that's the 1st large
bldg on the right off the Lakeland Dr entrance to the campus). If those
times work for any of your folks and they need extra directions, have
them call me (815-2112) or page me (991-8891). I'm not trying to recruit
your folks away from your service, just to offer an alternative to those
who work around here and can't get to yours.
Peace,
Ruth
