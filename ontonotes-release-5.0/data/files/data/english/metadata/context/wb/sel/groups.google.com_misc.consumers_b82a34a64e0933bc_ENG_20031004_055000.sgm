If anyone wants to find out about private companies that are selling
your private medical records and how 27% of consumers state they have
been harmed by unauthorized leaks of their medical records, visit:

HLisprot probably never took his head out of his medical texts, as he
seems to be rather ignorant of the subject surrounding the state of
today's medical practices.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why would I want to know what experiences you think youve had? You
&gt;&gt;&gt;are correct in saying that doctors make decisions based on clinical
&gt;&gt;&gt;and empirical evidence. If you have a better way to do it then you
&gt;&gt;&gt;can live the rest of your life without seeing a doctor, in ignorance
&gt;&gt;&gt;and paranoia.

&gt;&gt;So, doctors can base their opinions on experience, but usenet posters
&gt;&gt;can't, specially if YOU disagree with them?

&gt; You can base your opinions on experiences, I just don't want to hear
&gt; about them. Next time you can actually read what I wrote.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Blah blah blah - people who crosspost are retarded attention seekers
&gt;&gt;&gt;or just plain dumb, everyone knows it. Really, they ought to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;manuals for this funky internet thing, and just forbid aol and webTV
&gt;&gt;&gt;users altogether. Dont cry yourself to sleep over it though. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;suggest you find a friend who has been on usenet a little longer than
&gt;&gt;&gt;yourself and ask what he thinks about it.

&gt;&gt;Posting to more than one group isn't a violation of netiquette. Posting
&gt;&gt;to 10 groups is. Most servers limit you to 5 groups in x-posting. Hope
&gt;&gt;you know more about medicine than you do about the usenet.

&gt; You can think what you want, you are entitled to your own opinion. I
&gt; will never crosspost, I like to actually find a forum that is related
&gt; to the topic at hand, then post there only. Not like you, obviously -
&gt; notice the title of this particular group. With that said, I wont
&gt; bother to post any more after this, cause it is just getting silly.

&gt;&gt;Bull. You have Medicare and you have the Medical Information Bureau,
&gt;&gt;which is like the credit reporting agencies, except it reports your
&gt;&gt;medical history. I also know people who have gone to physicians, where
&gt;&gt;it is quite obvious that the doctor knew their medical history before he
&gt;&gt;had even seen them.

&gt; I should hope so - I for one like to know as much about a patient as
&gt; possible before I go and talk to them. This in no way alters my
&gt; judgement or limits my ability to take in new information that a
&gt; patient has, but it does allow me to be efficient. And the Medical
&gt; information bureau is an insurance claim database - you can pay out of
&gt; pocket and you will never be in it, but it doesnt matter anyway, since
&gt; doctors have no direct access to it in an ambulatory or an inpatient
&gt; setting. Any information that a doctor has beforehand comes from teh
&gt; records that are generated from previous visits to his office or, in
&gt; the case of the VA network, from previous visits to the VA. It is
&gt; tremendously valuable and allows doctors to communicate with each
&gt; other, have access to important patient care data, and be much more
&gt; time efficient.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I would also like to remeind you that in the public sector, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;accounts for most ot the healthcare in the US, doctors are not paid on
&gt;&gt;&gt;a patient bases, they are salaried and/or paid by the procedure, so it
&gt;&gt;&gt;matters very little how much money a patient has, they all get the
&gt;&gt;&gt;same care, the best that particular system can afford. Yes some are
&gt;&gt;&gt;better than others, and yes, if you have money you can get all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;expensive, often redundant or unnessesary tests at your choice of
&gt;&gt;&gt;private hospitals.

&gt;&gt;More bull. Doctors own practices. Practices exist to make money. Poor
&gt;&gt;patients with poor insurance do not generate money. Hence if your're
&gt;&gt;poor there's no reason to examine you properly, make a thorough
&gt;&gt;diagnosis, call for the necessary expensive tests, etc.

&gt; Doctors do own some practices, yes, but poor patients are subsidized
&gt; by the government, and are payed for on a state and federal basis.
&gt; That is why doctors treat them. I suggest you take a field trip out
&gt; of your home and to the local county hospital and see how many
&gt; patients there are paying directly. Yet still the manage to get
&gt; treated as best as that particular hospital can manage with doctors
&gt; that you say don't care and are only there to make money. One of
&gt; these days you will need a doctor and you will find out first hand
&gt; just how caring they can be. I know quite a few doctors who donate
&gt; their weekends to work for free at local homeless shelters - I have
&gt; worked with them, we take donations from anyone who will give, then we
&gt; use them as best we can to treat people who have nothing more than the
&gt; shirt on their back - if that.

&gt; And if you dont make an accurate diagnosis, order the recommeded
&gt; tests, etc, then you are going to be sued - malpractice lawyers are
&gt; making a killing these days. And you dont have to make money to
&gt; afford one, they work based on the money they win clients. Doctors
&gt; are forced to be (overly) careful in this day and age, and many are
&gt; forced out of practice by rising malpractice insurance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am not saying that all doctors are saints and that all the right
&gt;&gt;&gt;decisions are made for every patient. if you have a particular gripe
&gt;&gt;&gt;with an experience then take it up with that doctor, but please do not
&gt;&gt;&gt;blame them as a whole.

&gt;&gt;As the original poster correctly observed, our entire U.S. society is
&gt;&gt;decadent. Why should physicians be any better. Doctors nowadays use a
&gt;&gt;mental stopwatch; if you exceed their 5 minute limit, they're gone. Too
&gt;&gt;bad they didn't happen to catch what was wrong with you or to treat you.
&gt;&gt;If you have really good insurance, the 5 minute limit becomes longer
&gt;&gt;depending on how many tests they can squeeze out of your insurance
&gt;&gt;company, often done in office, so they can reap additional profits.

&gt; I wont say the US isnt decadent - I agree. And doctors are forced to
&gt; be rushed in many cases, but that does not mean that they do not try
&gt; to make the best diagnosis. Often, especially in an ambulatory
&gt; setting, a diagnosis can be made in less than a minute, just as
&gt; accurately as if you spent all day and had every test in the book.

&gt; In addition, doctors would love to be able to order more tests, but
&gt; just ask any one, and you will see that insurance companies do not let
&gt; them. If a family practice doctor thinks his or her patient needs an
&gt; MRI, the hoops they have to jump through for the insurance companies
&gt; are unbelieveable, and yet we jump. Many insurances limit the amount
&gt; that they will pay per patient, so you can get any test you want, but
&gt; you only get reimbursed X amount, regardless, and docs are forced to
&gt; play statistics in order to get by.

&gt;&gt;Talking to most doctors is a waste of time. They don't listen and they
&gt;&gt;resent that anyone would have the audacity to question that they are not
&gt;&gt;doing things perfectly right without their patients input. Something
&gt;&gt;happens to them after they get out of med school and everyone starts
&gt;&gt;kissing their collective asses. They think their gods. Wrong again.

&gt; Sounds like you have had poor doctors, I wish people would just
&gt; understand that if you don't like you doctor, you can change. Every
&gt; insurance plan has many many... If you dont think your doc listens,
&gt; leave.

&gt;&gt;BTW, besides the 50+ years I've had going to doctors, I've sold to
&gt;&gt;doctors, been in on surgery and had a chance to see that they are
&gt;&gt;definitely NOT gods,despite their wishful and insecure thinking.

&gt; Duh - doctors know better than anyone that they are not gods. If we
&gt; had all the answers it would make life a lot easier. If evrything
&gt; went the way we planned then we wouldnt even need doctors. Im glad
&gt; youve been in on surgeries, you must know how stressful they are (I
&gt; wont get into how surgeons are changing). Doctors are human just like
&gt; anyone else, mistakes are made, things happen that arent planned for,
&gt; and worse case scenarios can occur.

&gt;&gt;I suggest you start reading the newspapers and become aware of how much
&gt;&gt;new resentment there is towards the medical profession. You will also
&gt;&gt;see how many malpractice attorneys make very good livings suing for all
&gt;&gt;your mistakes (that's your in the collective sense).

&gt; Again, to be a doctor in this day and age, you have to keep up. The
&gt; resentment that is out there for doctors and those who make their
&gt; living off it are everywhere. Unless something is done, then it will
&gt; be the end of the system as we know it, and the whole medical field
&gt; will collapse and then disease will run rampant. Sounds like fun.

&gt; And I dont understand how you can bitch about doctors not being
&gt; personable, not spending time with patients, not doing enough to make
&gt; you happy, then sit here and espouse the very entities which are
&gt; responsible. It makes me sick, really, and to be honest, I hope I am
&gt; long gone when these problems come around and bit you on your ass
&gt; (thats your in the collective sense).
