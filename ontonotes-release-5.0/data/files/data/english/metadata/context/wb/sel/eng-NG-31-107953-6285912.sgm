New Oil Law Means Victory in Iraq for Bush
By Chris Floyd
t r u t h o u t | UK Correspondent

Monday 08 January 2007

I. Surging Toward the Ultimate Prize

The reason that George W. Bush insists that "victory" is
achievable in
Iraq is not that he is deluded or isolated or ignorant or detached
from
reality or ill-advised. No, it's that his definition of "victory" is
different from those bruited about in his own rhetoric and in the
ever-earnest disquisitions of the chattering classes in print and
online.
For Bush, victory is indeed at hand. It could come at any moment now,
could
already have been achieved by the time you read this. And the driving
force
behind his planned "surge" of American troops is the need to preserve
those
fruits of victory that are now ripening in his hand.

At any time within the next few days, the Iraqi Council of
Ministers is
expected to approve a new "hydrocarbon law" essentially drawn up by
the
Bush administration and its UK lackey, the Independent on Sunday
reported.
The new bill will "radically redraw the Iraqi oil industry and throw
open
the doors to the third-largest oil reserves in the world," says the
paper,
whose reporters have seen a draft of the new law. "It would allow the
first
large-scale operation of foreign oil companies in the country since
the
industry was nationalized in 1972." If the government's parliamentary
majority prevails, the law should take effect in March.

As the paper notes, the law will give Exxon Mobil, BP, Shell and
other
carbon cronies of the White House unprecedented sweetheart deals,
allowing
them to pump gargantuan profits from Iraq's nominally state-owned
oilfields
for decades to come. This law has been in the works since the very
beginning of the invasion - indeed, since months before the invasion,
when
the Bush administration brought in Phillip Carroll, former CEO of both
Shell and Fluor, the politically-wired oil servicing firm, to devise
"contingency plans" for divvying up Iraq's oil after the attack. Once
the
deed was done, Carroll was made head of the American "advisory
committee"
overseeing the oil industry of the conquered land, as Joshua Holland
of
Alternet.com has chronicled in two remarkable reports on the backroom
maneuvering over Iraq's oil: "Bush's Petro-Cartel Almost Has Iraq's
Oil and
"The US Takeover of Iraqi Oil."

From those earliest days until now, throughout all the twists and
turns, the blood and chaos of the occupation, the Bush administration
has
kept its eye on this prize. The new law offers the barrelling
buccaneers of
the West a juicy set of production-sharing agreements (PSAs) that will
maintain a fig leaf of Iraqi ownership of the nation's oil industry -
while
letting Bush's Big Oil buddies rake off up to 75 percent of all oil
profits
for an indefinite period up front, until they decide that their
"infrastructure investments" have been repaid. Even then, the
agreements
will give the Western oil majors an unheard-of 20 percent of Iraq's
oil
profits - more than twice the average of standard PSAs, the
Independent
notes.

Of course, at the moment, the "security situation" - i.e., the
living
hell of death and suffering that Bush's "war of choice" has wrought in
Iraq
- prevents the Oil Barons from setting up shop in the looted fields.
Hence
Bush's overwhelming urge to "surge" despite the fierce opposition to
his
plans from Congress, the Pentagon and some members of his own party.
Bush
and his inner circle, including his chief adviser, old oilman Dick
Cheney,
believe that a bigger dose of blood and iron in Iraq will produce a
sufficient level of stability to allow the oil majors to cash in the
PSA
chips that more than 3,000 American soldiers have purchased for them
with
their lives.

The American "surge" will be blended into the new draconian effort
announced over the weekend by Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki: an
all-out war by the government's Shiite militia-riddled "security
forces" on
Sunni enclaves in Baghdad, as the Washington Post reports. American
troops
will "support" the "pacification effort" with what Maliki says calls
"house-to-house" sweeps of Sunni areas. There is of course another
phrase
for this kind of operation: "ethnic cleansing."

The "surged" troops - mostly long-serving, overstrained units
dragooned
into extended duty - are to be thrown into this maelstrom of urban
warfare
and ethnic murder, temporarily taking sides with one faction in Iraq's
hydra-headed, multi-sided civil war. As the conflict goes on - and it
will
go on and on - the Bush administration will continue to side with
whatever
faction promises to uphold the "hydrocarbon law" and those profitable
PSAs.
If "Al Qaeda in Iraq" vowed to open the nation's oil spigots for
Exxon,
Fluor and Halliburton, they would suddenly find themselves transformed
from
"terrorists" into "moderates" - as indeed has Maliki and his violent,
sectarian Dawa Party, which once killed Americans in terrorist actions
but
are now hailed as freedom's champions.

So Bush will surge with Maliki and his ethnic cleansing for now.
If the
effort flames out in a disastrous crash that makes the situation worse
- as
it almost certainly will - Bush will simply back another horse. What
he
seeks in Iraq is not freedom or democracy but "stability" - a
government of
any shape or form that will deliver the goods. As the Independent
wryly
noted in its Sunday story, Dick Cheney himself revealed the true goal
of
the war back in 1999, in a speech he gave when he was still CEO of
Halliburton. "Where is the oil going to come from" to slake the
world's
ever-growing thirst, asked Cheney, who then answered his own question:
"The
Middle East, with two-thirds of the world's oil and the lowest cost,
is
still where the prize ultimately lies."

And therein lies another hidden layer of the war. For Iraq not
only has
the world's second largest oil reserves; it also has the world's most
easily retrievable oil. As the Independent succinctly notes: "The
cost-per-barrel of extracting oil in Iraq is among the lowest in the
world
because the reserves are relatively close to the surface. This
contrasts
starkly with the expensive and risky lengths to which the oil industry
must
go to find new reserves elsewhere - witness the super-deep offshore
drilling and cost-intensive techniques needed to extract oil form
Canada's
tar sands."

This is precisely what Cheney was getting at in his 1999 talk to
the
Institute of Petroleum. In a world of dwindling petroleum resources,
those
who control large reserves of cheaply-produced oil will reap
unimaginable
profits - and command the heights of the global economy. It's not just
about profit, of course; control of such resources would offer
tremendous
strategic advantages to anyone who was interested in "full spectrum
domination" of world affairs, which the Bush-Cheney faction and their
outriders among the neo-cons and the "national greatness" fanatics
have
openly sought for years. With its twin engines of corporate greed and
military empire, the war in Iraq is a marriage made in Valhalla.

II. The Win-Win Scenario

And this unholy union is what Bush is really talking about when he
talks about "victory." This is the reason for so much of the drift and
dithering and chaos and incompetence of the occupation: Bush and his
cohorts don't really care what happens on the ground in Iraq - they
care
about what comes out of the ground. The end - profit and dominion -
justifies any means. What happens to the human beings caught up in the
war
is of no ultimate importance; the game is worth any number of broken
candles.

And in plain point of fact, the Bush-Cheney faction - and the
elite
interests they represent - has already won the war in Iraq. I've
touched on
this theme before elsewhere, but it is a reality of the war that is
very
often overlooked, and is worth examining again. This ultimate victory
was
clear as long ago as June 2004, when I first set down the original
version
of some of the updated observations below.

Put simply, the Bush Family and their allies and cronies represent
the
confluence of three long-established power factions in the American
elite:
oil, arms and investments. These groups equate their own interests,
their
own wealth and privilege, with the interests of the nation - indeed,
the
world - as a whole. And they pursue these interests with every weapon
at
their command, including war, torture, deceit and corruption.
Democracy
means nothing to them - not even in their own country, as we saw in
the
2000 election. Laws are just whips to keep the common herd in line;
they
don't apply to the elite, as Bush's own lawyers and minions have
openly
asserted in the memos, signing statements, court cases and
presidential
decrees asserting the "inherent power" of the "unitary executive" to
override any law he pleases.

The Iraq war has been immensely profitable for these Bush-linked
power
factions (and their tributary industries, such as construction);
billions
of dollars in public money have already poured into their coffers.
Halliburton has been catapulted from the edge of bankruptcy to the
heights
of no-bid, open-ended, guaranteed profit. The Carlyle Group is gorging
on
war contracts. Individual Bush family members are making out like
bandits
from war-related investments, while dozens of Bush minions - like
Richard
Perle, James Woolsey, and Joe Allbaugh - have cashed in their insider
chips
for blood money.

The aftermath of the war promises equal if not greater riches.
Even if
the new Iraqi government maintains nominal state control of its oil
industry, there are still untold billions to be made in PSAs for
drilling,
refining, distributing, servicing

It has always been about oil, including 911 and even TWA flight-800.

The mutually perpetrated cold-war actually wasn't much different, was
it.

I'm thinking Usama bin Laden was sufficiently right to kick our energy
sucking and global domination butts.

It is true it is about oil. But, it was all published in the DOE
website years ago, in the form of charts and figures.  Iraq has about
100  years of oil, so they claim.  We could be looking at another lie,
because lately, who can we believe?  Anyway, the oil is cheaper to
extract (technically that is) than oil in Siberia, or Alaska, or
midwestern shale.  So, it saves money for corporations.    Global oil
companies will enjoy the benefits of the Iraqi war, while we the
American people, foot the bill for the troops we supplied to protect
their interests.  Unfortunately, according to the DOE, most of that oil
is not even coming to America.  Yikes!
So, we paid 400 billion dollars, or about $6400 per family to protect
foreign oil interests, while we pay more money at the pump. Meanwhile,
we could easily be powering our cars using methane generated locally
from manure, sewage, and waste.  But, the government doesn't like to
fund pig farmer's digesters.  What, give them a $100,000 grant?
Never, better buy a missile and blow it up.   So, yes,  they have
giving us the royal screw.

When are American's going to wake up and do something!

Just read DOE website, it's all there.

What I find even more amazing, is that most Americans still believe that

Thank god there are always losers like you to say "I told you so" and "I
thought of it first". Get a life. The most important thing isn't how
smart you think you are, and comments like yours above illustrate your

Typical simple minded lefthead. Lots of noise and nothing at all
offered for a different solution. You have nothing to offer as an
alternative so you choose to criticize with big names and unimaginative
rhetoric.
When you finish sucking the taste of Pelosi's ass from Ted Kennedy's
cock, try offering something of a different solution rather than taking
the simple route of regurgitated hate speech.

Yes, I chose to side with organizations with big names like The National

I am, of course, not a "lefthead".  But I'm not one of those
crazed idiots who support the current administration as it
makes a complete hash out of Iraq, either.

I'll offer the same solution I did before Bush made a mess,
and then two specific ways to unscrew the mess given where
we are now.

###############################################################

WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE:

Hit every al Qaeda facility we could identify, anywhere in
the world, with conventional stand-off weapons.  Ignore
proximity to civilian populations.

Choose the highest value target in Afghanistan not hugging a
large civilian population.  Use a low-yield nuclear weapon on
that one target.  This is a warning shot with a specific
symbolic meaning.

Announce we will continue hunting al Qaeda, and that we will
not be deterred by proximity to civilian populations.
Announce that we will not consider ourselves limited to
conventional weapons.  Advise governments to remove al Qaeda
before we do it for them.

###############################################################

GIVEN THAT ERIC WAS RIGHT AND WE WENT INTO IRAQ HALF-ASSED
WITHOUT A THIRD OF THE TROOPS WE NEED:

(1) Victory option: make the rich pay taxes.  (They don't,
and don't bullshit me on that.)  Institute a draft,
starting with the Bush daughters and no deferments for
the rich kids.  Quadruple the number of boots on the
ground.  Disarm the militias, dismantle the broken-ass
joke of a government we installed, run the country and
fix the infrastructure, give the kids a liberal western
education, and leave in a generation or two.

(2) Cut-and-run sensibly option: Note that we can
determine who controls the country when we leave by who we
give weapons to or take them away from.  Talk with the local
ethnic groups and Syria and Iran.  Hold an auction, and sell
the country to the bidder that offers us the best deal (no
bases for al Qaeda, access to oil, yadda, yadda).  Leave.
But keep a small, toothy residual presence to enforce the
deal.

###############################################################

There are other options, of course.

But anyone supporting the Bush administration at this point
is either dumber than dirt or living in an alternative
universe where physics and war don't work like they do here.

If we keep going down the path we're on, we're going to have
a bunch more kids coming home in body bags, a much larger
number of ragheads are going to be meeting Allah prematurely,
and at the end of the day we're going to completely lose.

Just fucking unbelievably stupid.

- Mrphlstich

Where did I say I supported anything. I just want to hear real
solutions to real problems. We're in Iraq, you can't change that. Offer
a real solution that will minimize loss of life and put down the
extremist takeover of the Muslim faith. Offer a real soultion to
"global warming" that addresses the emerging 3rd world countries as
well as options for lowered dependence on fossil fuels. Offer a real
solution for hunger and poverty that addresses the flow of money to the
privilaged few but also maintains a geteway for personal
responsibility, incentive to succeed, and individual freedom. When was
it the governments job to "take care of" everyone?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

For what? All you have is hatred for the current President and a grudge
because you can't over the '04 election. You have the democratic party
now in a majority and so far have done nothing beyond "feel good"
legislation (minimum wage, stem cells, and criticize the Iraq
situation) and show they also have nothing but partisanship and corrupt
associations.
The easy answer is there is no easy answer. The GOP/DEM controlled
government is a joke and barely maintains the red tape it hides behind.
The middle east is lost in a religious war centuries old and we only
care because there is oil under their sand. The average citizen of any
country falls victim to whatever propoganda latches them first and
everyone is in a hurry to get the next gaming system.
Plus - more people are worried about whether Paris Hilton is wearing
panties than whether their government is actually working.

So, offer solutions or crawl back into the hole of sound-bites that
spawned you.

Actually, no real class envy -- my net wealth is in the high
7 digits, and I have (legally) not paid taxes in years.  In
fact, in about 60% of the recent years the IRS has paid *me*.

Most folks who earn wages do not understand the implications
of the current taxes laws for folks with high net worth.
Most high-net-worth people often have little or no earned
income.  Most of their wealth is in capital gains, and you do
not pay taxes on gains until you sell the underlying asset.

Even then, there are numerous ways to (legally) avoid or defer
taxes.

And there are literally thousands of other ways that you can
increase your net worth without incurring taxes.  The tax
code was literally designed to shear the sheep in the income-
earning classes while preserving the wealth of the asset-
holding class.

Without estate taxes, you can pass it all intact to your
children.  I've never much worried estate planning because I
have no heirs, but my (possibly wrong) understanding is that
assets have their basis adjusted to current market value as
part of the inheritance process, so the really KEWL thing is
that your heirs get all the capital gains you've accumulated
during your life utterly tax-free (so long as the estate tax
doesn't exists).

The real wealth you accumulated is *never* taxed.

(Fools believe the estate tax is double-taxation.  It's not.
It's the *only* tax the asset-holding class would ever pay,
and in it's old incarnation proper estate planning or a shift
of citizenship to a tax-haven country before death [Forbes
recommended that as patriotic!] allowed you to still avoid
taxes entirely.)

Life is good when you're rich.

Misguided Muslims who hate the west only because they've been told to

What has Bush offered?  Same old.  He's been wrong about every single thing to
do with Iraq, so his credibility is very low.

Anything would be better than sending 20,000 more Americans do die for
nothing.

Half of U.S. still believes Iraq had WMD - Aug 7, 2006

Do you believe in Iraqi "WMD"? Did        Saddam Hussein's government have
weapons of mass destruction in 2003?

Half of America apparently still thinks so, a new poll finds, and experts
see a
raft of reasons why: a drumbeat of voices from talk radio to die-hard
bloggers
to the Oval Office, a surprise headline here or there, a rallying around a
partisan flag, and a growing need for people, in their own minds, to justify
the
war in        Iraq.

People tend to become "independent of reality" in these circumstances, says
opinion analyst Steven Kull.

The reality in this case is that after a 16-month, $900-million-plus
investigation, the U.S. weapons hunters known as the Iraq Survey Group
declared
that Iraq had dismantled its chemical, biological and nuclear arms programs
in
1991 under U.N. oversight. That finding in 2004 reaffirmed the work of U.N.
inspectors who in 2002-03 found no trace of banned arsenals in Iraq.
Despite this, a Harris Poll released July 21 found that a full 50 percent of
U.S. respondents - up from 36 percent last year - said they believe Iraq did
have the forbidden arms when U.S. troops invaded in March 2003, an attack
whose
stated purpose was elimination of supposed WMD. Other polls also have found
an
enduring American faith in the WMD story.

"I'm flabbergasted," said Michael Massing, a media critic whose writings
dissected the largely unquestioning U.S. news reporting on the Bush
administration's shaky WMD claims in 2002-03.

"This finding just has to cause despair among those of us who hope for an
informed public able to draw reasonable conclusions based on evidence,"
Massing
said.

Timing may explain some of the poll result. Two weeks before the survey, two
Republican lawmakers, Pennsylvania's Sen. Rick Santorum (news, bio, voting
record) and Michigan's Rep. Peter Hoekstra (news, bio, voting record),
released
an intelligence report in Washington saying 500 chemical munitions had been
collected in Iraq since the 2003 invasion.

"I think the Harris Poll was measuring people's surprise at hearing this
after
being told for so long there were no WMD in the country," said Hoekstra
spokesman Jamal Ware.

But the        Pentagon and outside experts stressed that these abandoned
shells, many found in ones and twos, were 15 years old or more, their
chemical
contents were degraded, and they were unusable as artillery ordnance. Since
the
1990s, such "orphan" munitions, from among 160,000 made by Iraq and
destroyed,
have turned up on old battlefields and elsewhere in Iraq, ex-inspectors say.
In
other words, this was no surprise.

"These are not stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction," said Scott
Ritter,
the ex-Marine who was a U.N. inspector in the 1990s. "They weren't
deliberately
withheld from inspectors by the Iraqis."

Conservative commentator Deroy Murdock, who trumpeted Hoekstra's
announcement in
his syndicated column, complained in an interview that the press "didn't
give
the story the play it deserved." But in some quarters it was headlined.
"Our top story tonight, the nation abuzz today ..." was how Fox News led its
report on the old, stray shells. Talk-radio hosts and their callers seized
on
it. Feedback to blogs grew intense. "Americans are waking up from a
distorted
reality," read one posting.

Other claims about supposed WMD had preceded this, especially speculation
since
2003 that Iraq had secretly shipped WMD abroad. A former Iraqi general's
book -
at best uncorroborated hearsay - claimed "56 flights" by jetliners had borne
such material to        Syria.

But Kull, Massing and others see an influence on opinion that's more
sustained
than the odd headline.

"I think the Santorum-Hoekstra thing is the latest 'factoid,' but the basic
dynamic is the insistent repetition by the Bush administration of the
original
argument," said John Prados, author of the 2004 book "Hoodwinked: The
Documents
That Reveal How Bush Sold Us a War."

Administration statements still describe Saddam's Iraq as a threat. Despite
the
official findings, Secretary of State        Condoleezza Rice has allowed
only
that "perhaps" WMD weren't in Iraq. And Bush himself, since 2003, has
repeatedly
insisted on one plainly false point: that Saddam rebuffed the U.N.
inspectors in
2002, that "he wouldn't let them in," as he said in 2003, and "he chose to
deny
inspectors," as he said this March.

The facts are that Iraq - after a four-year hiatus in cooperating with
inspections - acceded to the        U.N. Security Council's demand and
allowed
scores of experts to conduct more than 700 inspections of potential weapons
sites from Nov. 27, 2002, to March 16, 2003. The inspectors said they could
wrap
up their work within months. Instead, the U.S. invasion aborted that work.
As recently as May 27, Bush told West Point graduates, "When the
United
Nations Security Council gave him one final chance to disclose and disarm,
or
face serious consequences, he refused to take that final opportunity."
"Which isn't true," observed Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a scholar of
presidential
rhetoric at the University of Pennsylvania. But "it doesn't surprise me when
presidents reconstruct reality to make their policies defensible." This
president may even have convinced himself it's true, she said.

Americans have heard it. A poll by Kull's WorldPublicOpinion.org found that
seven in 10 Americans perceive the administration as still saying Iraq had a
WMD
program. Combine that rhetoric with simplistic headlines about WMD "finds,"
and
people "assume the issue is still in play," Kull said.

"For some it almost becomes independent of reality and becomes very
partisan."
The WMD believers are heavily Republican, polls show.

Beyond partisanship, however, people may also feel a need to believe in WMD,
the
analysts say.

"As perception grows of worsening conditions in Iraq, it may be that
Americans
are just hoping for more of a solid basis for being in Iraq to begin with,"
said
the Harris Poll's David Krane.

Charles Duelfer, the lead U.S. inspector who announced the negative WMD
findings
two years ago, has watched uncertainly as TV sound bites, bloggers and
politicians try to chip away at "the best factual account," his group's
densely
detailed, 1,000-page final report.

"It is easy to see what is accepted as truth rapidly morph from one
representation to another," he said in an e-mail. "It would be a shame if
one
effect of the power of the Internet was to undermine any commonly agreed set
of
facts."

The creative "morphing" goes on.

As Israeli troops and Hezbollah guerrillas battled in Lebanon on July 21, a
Fox
News segment suggested, with no evidence, yet another destination for the
supposed doomsday arms.
