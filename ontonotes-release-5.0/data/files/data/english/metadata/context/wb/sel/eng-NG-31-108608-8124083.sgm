BOTH ARE HOT.

RELIGION KILLED 1,00,000 PEOPLE (US-Iraq war)

SCIENCE KILLED 1,00,000 PEOPLE (Nuclear Bomb at Hiroshima by US)

Both are just facts. Nothing is absolute.

Neither science nor religion killed those people. People did. And people

Religion's job is not to save lives. It answers the question &quot;what is the

we would make better choices in what we ask of science.

Numerous religious malpractitioners think you can use religion to get what

That is a very bleak and cynical view. Cristianity certainly went through
some phases (e.g., the Holy Roman Empire) where I am sure they were at odds
with Christ's own teaching. As I said in an earlier post, religious

What evidence do you have for such assertions? I believe that there are many
people who are clinically depressed who are religious and yet if they
weren't religious they might have commited suicide. There is no way to
determine how many people were _not_ murdered because the person decided
that regardless of anything else he loves God above all and for that reason
wouldn't break the &quot;Shall not commit murder&quot; commandment.  Studies have been
done in which a person, who believes that they are being prayed for, have a
higher survival rate then those who don't believe that they are being prayed
for.

Still, you're speaking about apples and oranges. But then again sometimes
science and religion touch on the same subject. Its a good point you're
making in this post. Worthy of my further study and I thank you for it.

Where do you get this opinion from? I'm a devout Christian and have never
been to jail and am far from being an evil hypocrit. I do my best to live
the life that God wants me to live as revealed by his Son Jesus. I try to
base all my morals on what the Bible says as interpreted by the New
Testament if different from the Old Testament. It can be very hard at times
trying to figure out how to do this. E.g. not only must it apply to daily
life situations but it must also apply to online interactions with others.
When those others prove to be impossible to get along with no matter how
much I try I keep the faith by kill filing them and thus my computer knows
which people I shouldn't attempt to communicate with.

How so. Even Christians have a hard time following that rule, never mind
non-Christians. I look at it this way. It was the Bible which originated
that idea. People who are not religious heard it and to them it sounds like
a good moral rule to live but.

">

Why would it be a bad thing if everyone believed in a benevolent God? One
main thing that we Christians live with is almost an entire lack of the fear
of dying for we believe that there is an after life in which we will reside
in paradise (i.e. heavean).

From experience I can tell you that being a devout Christian brings me a
piece of mind that I never had before it, with the possible exception of my
Christianity before I hit my rebellious teenage years.

&gt;&gt; &gt; That is a good thing, since it would fail miserably.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It answers the question &quot;what is the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; purpose of humanity?&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; But that question can be answered without religion. It can be answered
&gt;&gt; &gt; by philosphy, tradition, custom, politics. Such are the answers of
&gt;&gt; &gt; religion that most practioners, when push comes to shove, don't really
&gt;&gt; &gt; believe them anyway.

&gt;&gt; Sure. But there seems to be a movement to give Cristianity the bum's
&gt;&gt; rush,
&gt;&gt; and I think that would be a regrettable loss. Much philosophy, tradition,
&gt;&gt; custom and even politics, are based on it. Not that I am anxious to
&gt;&gt; preserve
&gt;&gt; whatever it is that passes for Christianity these days, but we should not
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; too hasty, lest we throw the baby out with the bathwater.

&gt; I agree with much of what you say. But so much of what passes for
&gt; &quot;Christiantiy&quot; is nothing but the most evil hypocrisy. The only
&gt; &quot;Chrisitians&quot; to be seen are those trying to get out of jail early, or
&gt; to redeem their &quot;substance abuse&quot;.
">

Those are the ones gleefully spotlighted by the media (because the media
love to point out hyprocrisy in others). Most &quot;good&quot; Christians are quietly
living their faith and not bothering anyone. The occasional Mother Theresa
gets media attention, but that's about it.

I believe that the much maligned and ridiculed &quot;What Would Jesus Do&quot; (WWJD)
really is the best way to get a true idea of what a Christian should really
be (and to cut through all the BS, dogma and politics that you will find in
almost any Christian denomination).

&gt;&gt; That's the sound bite version, which does seem to have minimal value to

I think we have to be careful not to confuse the roles of science and
religion.

Science answers the question &quot;how do I get what I want&quot; by describing causal
relationships in the nature of the universe (allowing us to create the
technology to get what we want, be it medicine, abortions or bullets).

Religion answers the question &quot;what ought I to want&quot; by describing a moral
and ethical framework that helps us to choose, medicine, abortions or
bullets.

One difficulty with religion is that there is no objective way to prove the
correctness of any given religion (or branch of religion - Christians
disagree about medicine, abortions and bullets. Shiite and Sunni Muslims
obviously disagree over lots of things, and Jews, Christians and Muslims are
frequently in mutual disagreement over their very existence).

This diversity is certainly harmful to the peace and tranquility of the
planet. And yet, it is not very different from the &quot;cultural diversity&quot; that
the PC crowd is promoting. People tend to disagree less when they share the
same values.

&gt; Where do you get this opinion from? I'm a devout Christian and have never

&gt; the life that God wants me to live as revealed by his Son Jesus. I try to
&gt; base all my morals on what the Bible says as interpreted by the New
&gt; Testament if different from the Old Testament.

Jesus says comparatively few things that are forbidden. But look when
he is asked specifically about divorce. The talent of Christians
(particularly Protestants) to jump up and down about the Catholic's
Immaculate Conception (&quot;For all have sinned and fall short of the
glory of God&quot;), but miss the point entirely when Jesus says that MOses
only allowed divorce because the people's hearts were hard.

If you are basically a good person, you will interpret the Gospels as
commanding you to be good (which you are, anyway). If you were
basically a scumbag, you would find plenty of verses that supposedly
told you that being a scumbag is OK, too. (Say, the Prodigal Son, for
example)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Religion has saved 0 lives.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Religion's job is not to save lives.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That is a good thing, since it would fail miserably.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It answers the question &quot;what is the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; purpose of humanity?&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But that question can be answered without religion. It can be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; answered
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; by philosphy, tradition, custom, politics. Such are the answers of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; religion that most practioners, when push comes to shove, don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; really
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; believe them anyway.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sure. But there seems to be a movement to give Cristianity the bum's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rush,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and I think that would be a regrettable loss. Much philosophy,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; tradition,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; custom and even politics, are based on it. Not that I am anxious to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; preserve
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; whatever it is that passes for Christianity these days, but we should
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; too hasty, lest we throw the baby out with the bathwater.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I agree with much of what you say. But so much of what passes for
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Christiantiy&quot; is nothing but the most evil hypocrisy. The only
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Chrisitians&quot; to be seen are those trying to get out of jail early, or
&gt;&gt; &gt; to redeem their &quot;substance abuse&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Those are the ones gleefully spotlighted by the media (because the media
&gt;&gt; love to point out hyprocrisy in others).

&gt; But not in themselves - touche.

&gt;&gt; Most &quot;good&quot; Christians are quietly
&gt;&gt; living their faith and not bothering anyone. The occasional Mother
&gt;&gt; Theresa
&gt;&gt; gets media attention, but that's about it.

&gt; Agreed. But whether these same people would be any better or worse if
&gt; they were raised Mtethodist or Lutheran, Baptist or Catholic is
&gt; impossible to say.

&gt; I tend to suspect not. Even among very religious people, I have not
&gt; found them to be dissuaded from doing wrong because of fear of the
&gt; afterlife. The potential for &quot;forgiveness&quot; gives complete carte

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what we want (medicine or bombs) science neither wins nor loses.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Numerous religious malpractitioners think you can use religion to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; get
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you want (i.e., science's role - hence the confusion). Using

&gt;&gt; &gt; True. But one could achieve the same goal without religion at all.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I see science and religion as orthogonal, complementary disciplines. I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; would
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; extend your statement thus: With religion alone, or science alone, we
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; still just savages in the jungle.- Hide quoted text -

We have a neighbor, a &quot; devout Christian&quot;. She talks about Christ and
God constantly. She's not preachy or annoying, just devout. Her
husband is much less so. We've been neighbors for over 20 years. Our
daughter and their son went to school together. Ten yrs ago she said
she'd disown either son if they were gay. Guess what. 17 y/o. He came
out. The poor kid. Fucking religion.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I agree with much of what you say. But so much of what passes for
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Christiantiy&quot; is nothing but the most evil hypocrisy. The only
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Chrisitians&quot; to be seen are those trying to get out of jail early, or
&gt;&gt; &gt; to redeem their &quot;substance abuse&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Where do you get this opinion from? I'm a devout Christian and have never
&gt;&gt; been to jail and am far from being an evil hypocrit. I do my best to live
&gt;&gt; the life that God wants me to live as revealed by his Son Jesus. I try to
&gt;&gt; base all my morals on what the Bible says as interpreted by the New
&gt;&gt; Testament if different from the Old Testament.

&gt; Jesus says comparatively few things that are forbidden.
">

He rally didn't need to since it wasn't creating a new religion but
fulfilling an old one. Jesus held that the scriptures (I.e. Old Testament)
was what people should live by and it was valid and all ways of living were
sent from God. He did add a few things such as no divorcing, do not take
Othes etc. But there is more to being a Christian than following the Old
Testament.

However you bring up an excellant question for me to ask myself: What part
of following God was brought by Jesus?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But look when
&gt; he is asked specifically about divorce. The talent of Christians
&gt; (particularly Protestants) to jump up and down about the Catholic's
&gt; Immaculate Conception (&quot;For all have sinned and fall short of the
&gt; glory of God&quot;), but miss the point entirely when Jesus says that MOses
&gt; only allowed divorce because the people's hearts were hard.

&gt; If you are basically a good person, you will interpret the Gospels as
&gt; commanding you to be good (which you are, anyway). If you were
&gt; basically a scumbag, you would find plenty of verses that supposedly
&gt; told you that being a scumbag is OK, too. (Say, the Prodigal Son, for
&gt; example)
">

People who are doing that are making a strong attempt to twist what the
Bible says. But they know that they are doing it. At least that is my guess
since I'm not like that myself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; How so. Even Christians have a hard time following that rule, never mind
&gt;&gt; non-Christians.

&gt; There were no good people before the Bible?
">

There are things in the Bible which one might never have followed without
the Bible/religion. E.g. orgies, incest, homosexuality. There is nothing
which is obviously morally lacking in these actions and therefore good
people might have done such thing. In fact Abraham married his sister in
law. However when the Laws of Moses were set down then that became
forbidden.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I look at it this way. It was the Bible which originated
&gt;&gt; that idea.

&gt; There were no prohibitions against murder or theft before the
&gt; BIble????
">

I appologize. I lost track of this. What prompted this comment?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; People who are not religious heard it and to them it sounds like
&gt;&gt; a good moral rule to live but.

&gt;&gt; &gt; On the other hand, atheistic movements have been capable of complete
&gt;&gt; &gt; barbarity, also. The best situation (from a political point of view)
&gt;&gt; &gt; is a mixture of relgion and non-religion, and within religion a
&gt;&gt; &gt; mixture of faiths. So long as no one group is strong enough to
&gt;&gt; &gt; obliterate the other, the better off everyone is.

&gt;&gt; Why would it be a bad thing if everyone believed in a benevolent God?

&gt; &quot;Belief&quot; is worthless.
">

&quot;Belief&quot; is important in everyone's lives, espectially scientists. Yes.
Scientists must use a certain amount of (non-religous) faith to do their
work (loosley speaking)

&gt; Read the Epistle of James, unless you are
&gt; Lutheran, in which case it isn't in your BIble. Luther recognized that
&gt; James had pre-empted his &quot;justification by faith&quot; argument 1500 years
&gt; ahead of time so effectively, that Luther simply removed it .

&gt; For the dangers of a &quot;benevolent God&quot;, read NIetzsche.

&gt;&gt; One
&gt;&gt; main thing that we Christians live with is almost an entire lack of the
&gt;&gt; fear
&gt;&gt; of dying for we believe that there is an after life in which we will
&gt;&gt; reside
&gt;&gt; in paradise (i.e. heavean).

&gt;&gt; From experience I can tell you that being a devout Christian brings me a
&gt;&gt; piece of mind that I never had before it, with the possible exception of
&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt; Christianity before I hit my rebellious teenage years.

&gt; Then that is good for you.

Thanks. :)

In case you're curious, at this time I am a Protestant. But that is only
because I go to a Protastant Church. I have yet to sit done and study the
canons of each sect of Christianity. I just happened to be asked to come to
service there. I had been looking for a way to go to Church since I had
didn't have a car. So what rules do I follow? Those laid out in the Bible.
If an interpretation I try my best to interpret it.

Thanks for your questions

Pete

them? I recommend it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Religion has saved 0 lives.

&gt;&gt; What evidence do you have for such assertions? I believe that there are
&gt;&gt; many
&gt;&gt; people who are clinically depressed who are religious and yet if they
&gt;&gt; weren't religious they might have commited suicide.

&gt; Catholics have a very strong prohibition against suicide. Did
&gt; Catholics have a lower rate of suicide than other religions?
&gt; Do &quot;very religious&quot; people have lower rates of suicide than &quot;less
&gt; religious&quot; people?

&gt;&gt; There is no way to
&gt;&gt; determine how many people were _not_ murdered because the person decided
&gt;&gt; that regardless of anything else he loves God above all and for that
&gt;&gt; reason
&gt;&gt; wouldn't break the &quot;Shall not commit murder&quot; commandment.

&gt; Do Christians have lower rates of murder than non-Christians?
&gt; Murder rates vary very widely. If you have a link to any studies that
&gt; look at the relgious angle, it would be very interesting.

&gt;&gt; Studies have been
&gt;&gt; done in which a person, who believes that they are being prayed for, have
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; higher survival rate then those who don't believe that they are being
&gt;&gt; prayed
&gt;&gt; for.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Science has saved many millions.(Sanitation, antibiotics,
&gt;&gt; &gt; immunization, medicines, mechanization of agriculture, imporved
&gt;&gt; &gt; transportation to take varied diet great distances with minimal waste,
&gt;&gt; &gt; weather satellites to warn of hurricanes/tornados, communications to
&gt;&gt; &gt; send help faster,....

&gt;&gt; Still, you're speaking about apples and oranges. But then again sometimes
&gt;&gt; science and religion touch on the same subject. Its a good point you're
&gt;&gt; making in this post. Worthy of my further study and I thank you for it.

&gt;&gt; Pete

You bring up some excellant points Sir! :) Thank you for starting this
thread. I will save this post and the other one with your response and
someday when I'm done with what word I have set myself out to do then I will
seek answers to these questions. We'll talk more than or in e-mail, if that
is your desire.

From experience I know that if a doctor told you that you have a very deadly
form of cancer, one in which you know of and believe to have to cure for,
Then there is a few days in which I believed I would be dead in a few
months. Religion became the most important thing in my life then. So I had
the rest of my life (2 months/weeks??) to be the best person I could be. So
I said to myself &quot;Of what use am I now? I can't prove my love for god (I was
an agnostic/Christian at that time) when I'm dying of cancer.&quot;

So I chose to use the rest of my life to be the best person I could be. In
practice this meant that I'd be the best patient I could be. I'm glad I did.
All the nurses were sad to see me leave because they all cared very much for
me. They thought I was a very brave person and a very nice person. I'm happy
I chose that path. Then I turned out to be a miracle patient. I made it
through chemo with the least amount of readmissions that my social worker
has ever seen, even up to this date.

Here's one: &quot;Science And Faith: Understanding Meaning, Method, And Truth&quot; by
Dr. William H. Chalker

In college I took a course from the author that made me realize religion
wasn't superstition or magic, but a meaningful part of human existence. It
was a graduation requirement: &quot;Introduction to Biblical Literature&quot;. He also
taught logic and philosophy, and he knows more about the philosophy of
science than some of the science profs I took courses from. Some years after
I graduated in 1978, being a Presbyterian minister, he presided over me and
my wife's wedding. He is one of the wisest and thoughtful people I ever knew
(and a very popular prof). This book came out last year. I was glad to see
he's still alive and still active. It is a very scholarly and typically
methodical book. It is well worth reading, especially if you hold religion
in contempt. It may not change your mind, but at least you will understand
religion better (and also how far off the mark some overtly religious folk
really are).

I have a friend who got caught up in this group of people who called
themselves &quot;Born Again Christians&quot;, which is kind of a silly term because
being a Christian already means that you're born again. Some people go
beyond that and some evern get baptised again. In fact next month I'm going
to be baptised. I was baptised as a infant but that was an act of my parents
faith. My baptism this time will be my act of faith as an adult Christian.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's good. My friend was a real &quot;bible thumper&quot; back in the day (late
70s). Everytime I was near him I could strongly sense that he wanted to
thump the bible. I always try to keep an open mind so I went to his church
and discussed Christianity with him. But I was just out of my rebelious
stage of life and I was unsure of what it was I believed regarding my faith.
His church friends then told him that we can't be friends if I don't be like
them. As I recall he decided that something was wrong with that attitude so
he slacked off and then eventually left the church. We remain friends until
this day. Actually at this time I think I'm more religious that he is.

That's a rotten thing to do. Homosexual *acts* are forbidden. I never read
in the Bible that homosexual thoughts were a sin. Even so one thing about
being a Christian is to not judge others, especially your children.
Disowning a child because he's homosexual seems to me to be anti-Christian.
Recall that Jesus came to save the sinners and spent alot of time with them.
Jesus loves us _despite_ our sins. He died on the cross so that we wouldn't
be condemed for our sins. It is to honor God/Jesus that we do our best not
to sin.
