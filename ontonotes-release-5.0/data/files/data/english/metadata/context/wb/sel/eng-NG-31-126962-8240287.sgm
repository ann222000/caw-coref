The gas-guzzler is gas-guzzled and loaded with fishing gear. Get out of my
way Koolchickie, I'm not slowing down, 'cept to wave my passport at the
bored-spitless person in the booth. I shall soon be wrestling with French
River denizens.

BTW, my buddy was up there a few weeks ago and landed a 53-inch, 40lb
muskie. Well, he got it to the net and his line broke, but another guy
managed to grab it by the gills before it escaped, so I guess my buddy
didn't technically land it and if he doesn't shut up about it, I'm gonna
tell the world he didn't technically land it, then I'm gonna kill him.

Anyway, o rivers, monsewers and messy dames.

Well, I'm down in the south west of Ontario so unless you are dead
heading through the Motor city, I have not a thing to worry about. You
will be in Money shock when you get up here. Our dollar is at $.95 US.
Given that out beer is stronger than yours, it should not be that bad
for you, all things considered. I don't think you will have much of a
problem getting into Canada ( we let in all kinds you know ) but I'm a
bit concerned about making sure you get back home ( I'm not sure outr
health care system could handle the extra ordinary burden you would
represent). BTW the OPP are on the rampage up where you're going, ever
since they caught two 'Merkins doing 160 in their Vette's on the 400.

Quite the Busy Bee, that Ray Haddad!

Ray Haddad:  &quot;I [...] have been to Canada as an OFFICIAL
representative of the United States government
on two occasions. Once in 1971 and again in
1985.&quot;

Miz ing:  &quot;Wow.  I'm *impressed*. No doubt you were here
on official business as a high  falutin' employer
of 'many Americans' -- an 'international
businessman' kind of, right?

&quot;So they must've treated you right -- even got
the Sara Lee out for the official dinner dessert.
Gosh. Did ya get Pierre's autograph? Did ya have
some poutine? Suck back a Brador?

&quot;So ... how come you're a pro magician these days?
Fall on hard times?&quot;   [1]

Ray Haddad:  &quot;No. Official US Military business both times.
Once to carry documents from one place in the
US to Ottowa and another as temporary duty
on a Canadian warship in port and later underway
for outfitting and training. Both times, I had
diplomatic orders instead of military orders.
Go figure.&quot;

&quot;I've been there as a tourist lots and as a
performer once or twice. Other business?
Nope. [...] I've been a pro magician for most of
my life.&quot;

Papers due on Monday.  Discuss.

I'll start:  &quot;LIAR!   LIAR!   LIAR!&quot;

NO  ONE  BELIEVES  YOU, and I'm not
going to waste more of my time arguing
with a LYING  MORON who keeps snipping
the evidence that shows him wrong and
then claiming in the very next post that it
didn't exist.&quot;

Ray Haddad:  &quot;Good for you, Josh. I love surrender.
It looks good on you.&quot;

&quot;Well, Steve. There you have it. Next time, ask

&quot;Josh, Dishonesty about service or LACK THEREOF in Vietnam
has always been a very touchy issue among veterans of that
war. There are even groups who set out to discredit those
who lie about their service in Vietnam; FAMOUS OR NOT.
It's not just Kerry who is or has felt the sting. [...] his lies
about [...] Vietnam and now IT'S  TIME  to  PAY  THE  PIPER.&quot;

John Kerry's claims about military service
because &quot;Kerry was a liar and a fraud&quot;.
(&quot;Get over it. Nobody smeared him. They
told the truth about the liar.&quot;)

&quot;Have you heard of the term, 'valor thief,' Ray? [...]
it seems there are people out there who specialise
in outing fake Vietnam vets. They LIKE doing it, Ray.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;              John Kerry's claims about military service
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;              because &quot;Kerry was a liar and a fraud&quot;.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;              (&quot;Get over it. Nobody smeared him. They
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;              told the truth about the liar.&quot;)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;      &quot;Have you heard of the term, 'valor thief,' Ray? [...]
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;       it seems there are people out there who specialise
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;       in outing fake Vietnam vets. They LIKE doing it, Ray.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;       Shall I contact them, and let them know what you've
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;       been claiming, where you've been claiming it, etc?&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;              --  Mr. Pillock to Ray Haddad,  APR 8 2007

&gt;&gt; &gt;What the heck were you being trained on in '85 Ray?

&gt;&gt; When a ship goes underway with a mission of training rather than a
&gt;&gt; mission of other import, it's referred to as a training mission for
&gt;&gt; obvious reasons. Thus, I was there during a small part of the
&gt;&gt; outfitting and all of the training.

&gt;So was it that anti missile thingie that Ronnie was trying to sell us
&gt;back then?
">

It was to do with organizational training for various ranks in both
services for later joint exercises in the North Atlantic. Canadians
were on our ships and we were on yours. I think we were 6 in number.
If the &quot;bigger picture&quot; had to do with missile defense, I wasn't
made aware of that. Sorry. But you may be on to something. It was
the right timing.

Mr. $Zero:  &quot;Ray felt totally comfortable emailing Bob Sloan for
a 'personal favor' Navy 'shipmate' back-up, even
after Ray made a pig of himself over Sloan's
friend 'P's death -- Ray contacted a person who
has told him several times that he doesn't want
any emails from him,

'As long as you have an e-mail address,
you have no say over whether or not
I send you an e-mail. Get used to it.'

Haddad, Mr. Koolchicki did *not* ask you to define your clumsy phrase &quot;a

you didn't even use that phrase in your claim of being sent to Canada in

Mr. Koolchicki asked you *what kind* of training you meant.

So, Haddad:

1)   What kind of desperately needed special duty knowledge and
experience were you, Ray Haddad, lacking that made it necessary for the
United States Navy to team up with the U.S. Department of State's
Foreign Service bureau so they could send you on a joint mission to the
country of Canada for training onboard &quot;a Canadian warship&quot;?

--  Ray Haddad, E-5 SAILOR, claims superiority
in Military Knowledge Based on his Direct,
Eye to Eye Combat Duty

&quot;A significant difference between you and me is that I
mourn both sides in their death and grieving. As a US
Military man with two years (yes 2 calendar years) of
TOTAL TIME in COMBAT ZONES in DIRECT COMBAT,
I mourned every enemy soldier WHO DIED BECAUSE
OF MY ACTIONS actions and prayed for their immortal
souls as fervently as I did for any of my own who had fallen.&quot;

--  Ray Haddad: an E-5 SAILOR with two years of
Direct Combat Duty, during which he grieved
for *every* SOLDIER he PERSONALLY KILLED

&quot;I never have lost one minute of sleep over things I did
in Vietnam. I experience no flashbacks, no tearful soul
searching and certainly NO REGRETS for DOING WHAT
I HAD TO DO to REMAIN ALIVE.&quot;

--  Ray Haddad, Vietnam War COMBAT Veteran :
Grieving for every soldier he killed while
In Country during the Vietnam War?
OK, maybe *not* so much.

&quot;I fought a real enemy in a real war and had real SNIPERS
SHOOTING AT ME at me. I survived and many of them didn't.
For your sake, leave it at that. I'd hate to see you getting
into a lather over my combat record. What war were you in, Alan?&quot;

--  Ray Haddad, an E-5 SAILOR, claims
superiority in Military Knowledge Based on
Having Killed Snipers (specifically, just the
snipers that shot at people, not the ones
that didn't) . Also claims kindness in sparing
Mr. Hope further Particulars (what a guy!).

&quot;Have you any idea of how hard it is to kill someone who is
actively involved in trying to kill you? For MANY OF US
over there, those choices stung EACH TIME they were made.&quot;

--  Ray Haddad, an E-5 SAILOR, claims
superiority in Military Knowledge Based on his
years experience &quot;over there&quot; in the hard job
of killing an individual enemy soldier who is
(no, really) &quot;actively involved in trying to kill&quot; him.

&quot;That's easy for me to answer. I've stared death in the
face and I'm still here.&quot;

in Military Knowledge Based on his Direct, Face to Face,
Inches-From-the-Enemy Combat Duty

&quot;I'm retired from killing now, Geno. I haven't

anyone *since* engaged in Direct, Face to Face,

It seems &quot;psychiatric&quot;?  gawd.

&quot;And yet we do keep trying to get through to you, Josh.
Someday, perhaps, we'll succeed. Keep trying to understand.
Ok? Read the small words first. Then look up the big ones.
See if that helps.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  So, are you standing by what you claimed here:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;       &quot;I [...] have been to Canada as an OFFICIAL representative of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;        the United States government on two occasions. Once in 1971
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;        and again in  1985. [...]

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;       &quot;Official US Military business both times. Once to carry
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;        documents from one place in the US to Ottowa and another as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;        temporary duty on a Canadian warship in port and later underway
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;        for outfitting and training. Both times, I had diplomatic orders
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;        instead of military orders.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;       &quot;Go figure.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;                       --  Ray Haddad, OFFICIAL representative of

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Or, are you going to weasel? Again.
&gt;.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;What the heck were you being trained on in '85 Ray?
&gt;.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; When a ship goes underway with a mission of training rather than a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; mission of other import, it's referred to as a training mission for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; obvious reasons.
&gt;.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;      &lt;staring&gt;    &lt;eye roll&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   [  BULLSHIT! Horn blares  ]

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Haddad, Mr. Koolchicki did *not* ask you to define your clumsy phrase &quot;a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;mission of training&quot; (&quot;a training mission&quot;--DUH!). He couldn't have as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;you didn't even use that phrase in your claim of being sent to Canada in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;1971 and in 1985 as &quot;an OFFICIAL representative of  the United States
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;government&quot; on &quot;Official US Military business&quot;... on &quot;diplomatic orders&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Mr. Koolchicki asked you *what kind* of training you meant.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;So, Haddad:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;1)   What kind of desperately needed special duty knowledge and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;experience were you, Ray Haddad, lacking that made it necessary for the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;United States Navy to team up with the U.S. Department of State's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Foreign Service bureau so they could send you on a joint mission to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;country of Canada for training onboard &quot;a Canadian warship&quot;?
&gt;.
&gt;&gt; &gt;None of your business, Sylvia.

&gt;You published your bragging military claims to a public forum, Haddad.

&gt;         &quot;I just believe that if Kerry raises the issue of
&gt;          his service, he ought to at least stand up to the
&gt;          scrutiny that he invited. &quot;

&gt;                    -- Ray Haddad, the Epitome of Hypocrisy

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;2)   What kind of desperately needed special duty knowledge and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;experience did you, Ray Haddad, have that made it necessary for the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;United States Navy to team up with the U.S. Department of State's

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;country of Canada &quot;to carry documents from one place in the US to

&gt;&gt; &gt;Anyone reading this? Come on. Squeak up. Sylvia is craving attention

&gt;Twiiiiiiiiisssst, Haddad!
