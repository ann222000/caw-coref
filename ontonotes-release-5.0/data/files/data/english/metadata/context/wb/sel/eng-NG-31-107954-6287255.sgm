Many have described ISIS as a solution looking for a problem.  I've had a
couple of ISIS BB go crunchy fairly quickly (500-1000) miles but
admittedly they were low end.   Octalink BB have the same size spindle as
ISIS, so there is the same limited room for bearings.  Do Octalink
brackets share the same shortcomings as ISIS seem to?  thanks to all . .

Could be a bearing quality, not size, issue. I've got an FSA Ti ISIS bb,
which is really dumb (I weigh 173 and spend most of my time climbing &amp;
sprinting), and after 15k miles, it's still quiet and as smooth as the day I
installed it. I really thought it would be a one-season bb.

Wow, that's great. How much do you weigh if I may ask?
Mine are spin masters so far. My LBS really did me right w/ used DA
crank and Ultegra octalink BB
parts and install for $100. Made my bike feel 10x its value before
hand, and I was starting to get
discouraged too. No more, sky's the limit now.

Can't speak to ISIS, but when I "upgraded" from 7 speed to 9 speed, my
Ultegra 6500 Octalink BB seized up after only 5,000 mi. Glad I bought
several for about $28 each at Nashbar. Anyway, someone paid me twice
that much on eBay for my old, used steel Dura Ace 7400 BB with over
25,000 mi. on it. Of course, that one was still running smooth as
silk, barely broken in...sigh.

Everyone is different and is misunderstood by a segment of the

But I find Jim extremely bright, to the point, and always helpful. To
me, his posts are the most credible of all so far and there
are very many credible experts who post here with many influencing

Of course you may be kidding, which is hard without visual cues (ha-

But absolute rules in any context are often absolutely wrong given the
wide range human variability, especially in gifted persons
personalities.

If G.T. really wants to suggest he lacks credibility he should point
when he last said something misleading or wrong that he didn't

It doesn't but the OD of the spindle, in an attept to make things
lighter, makes bearings smaller, affecting longevity.

You said in another thread that Shimano's needle/roller bearings account for
the durability of its octalink cartridges. But since then we've learned that
only the Dura Ace bb (i.e., not a cartridge) uses those bearings. So the
question remains, in what way are Shimano's ball bearings better than those
in Isis bb's?

The spindle diameter is larger. The space between it and the frame shell
then is smaller. This restricts the bearing size.

From that experience, crank designers moved the bearing outside.

It does for me too.

I also find the Octalink splines a pain to get the crank
properly aligned on.  I've seen a few cranks ruined because of this --
people rode on cranks that weren't on right.
