I see M-W fucked up again. Clarence House said
he came out of the nightclub at three in the AM
tripped and fell onto a photographer but there had
been no "aggressive intent". Bwaah! Yeah, right,
we believe you, guys. He tripped and fell onto the
photographer. Sure, we believe you, of course
we do. Thousands, nay, millions wouldn't, but you
took us in, here in MW. MW for M-W, I say.
