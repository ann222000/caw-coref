Coming late to this , I discover that several of my favourites have already been suggested. Whatever. I'm a very inconsistent TV watcher, with odd tastes and huge gaps where other people have knowledge (what is this "CSI" of which they speak? ) Ah well, here we go, in no specific order, just as they occur to me, with notes as they seem needed.

1. Nile Crane (Frasier) - without whose deadpan humour the best sitcom ever would have been still-born. (Best sequence is the one where he attempts to iron a pair of trousers and ends up nearly burning down the apartment.)
2. Toby Ziegler (The West Wing) - again, gets most of the best deadpan lines. And some good dramatic bits. And twins ("I didn't realise babies come with hats").
3. Seeley Booth (Bones) ("Jesus was NOT a zombie! I shouldn't have to tell you that....")
4. Reggie Perrin (The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin) - for so many reasons. Think of all those excuses for lateness ("Twenty-two minutes late, badger ate a junction box at New Malden." "Twenty-two minutes late, escaped puma, Chessington North. " "Twenty-two minutes late, fed up by train delays, came by bike. Slow puncture at Peckham. ")
5. Cornfed (Duckman) - the most under-rated cartoon series ever, bar none. A depraved, corrupt private detective (Duckman - a duck) with a smoothly efficient sidekick (Cornfed - a pig). Sample line: "Any ex-wandering troubadour slash hostage negotiator could've done it. " And how can anyone not love a series with an episode entitled "The One With Lisa Kudrow In A Small Role"?
6. Fry (Futurama) - although almost any character would have done. A great series.
7. Damien Day (Drop The Dead Donkey) - can anyone watch a broadcast from a war zone now without thinking, however briefly, of Damien's hyped-up versions?
8. Marvin (The Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy) - OK, the appearance of the TV Marvin sucked big-time, but that was just one more thing to depress him.
9. Zaphod Beeblebrox (The Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy) - the Coolest Dude Ever (with a nice line in stolen starships).
10. Dana Scully (The X-Files) - as well as being the hottest thing on TV for decades, Agent Scully was the perfect foil for Fox Mulder's flights of (sometimes justified) wackiness. Clarice Starling with a license to perform autopsies. (I considered putting The Lone Gunmen in here as a single entry, BTW.)
11. Claire Fisher (Six Feet Under) - if for no other reason than that she paid back a school bully by putting a severed hand in his locker.
12. Jed Clampett (The Beverley Hillbillies) - in a sitcom full of over-the-top characters, the quiet purveyor of hillbilly wisdom. And still the funniest thing in it.
13. Jeeves (Jeeves and Wooster) - the Stephen Fry version.
14. Jason King (Department S) - Best. TV. Secret. Agent. Ever.
15. Toby Wren (Doomwatch) - Robert Powell's entry into stardom in 1970s eco-drama (exiting while trying unsuccessfully to defuse a nuclear device)
16. Sir Humphrey Appleby (Yes, Minister) - a performance which turned "Sir Humphrey" into part of the language, as every slick civil servant with an answer for everything.
17. Obadiah Slope (Barchester Towers) - Alan Rickman became a household name as this loathsome sycophant.
18. Livia (I, Claudius) - the best and baddest evil character in television history. ("Don't touch the figs.")
19. Johnny Bravo (Johnny Bravo) - for the deluded egotist inside each of us.
20. Bob Ferris (Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads) - the funnier half of a very funny pair, in a sitcom which pulled off the amazing trick of being a sequel about five years after the original, and being funnier. The humour was all about the stresses of being a lad-about-town who's now settled down and got engaged (then married), and Rodney Bewes managed to be completely convincing as the lad-about-town and as the settled middle-class guy, both at once , which is what made him so funny.
21. Sideshow Bob (The Simpsons) - OK, so I like bad guys.
22. Rupert Giles (Buffy The Vampire Slayer) Giles: Well, I'm... afraid that is not... You have responsibilities that other girls do not. Buffy: Oh! I know this one! Slaying entails certain sacrifices, blah, blah, bity blah, I'm so stuffy, gimme a scone. Giles (sarcastically): It's as if you know me.
23. Brenda Wilson (Watching) - the best character from one of the most under-rated sitcoms of all time.
24. Phoebe Buffay (Friends) - the best character from a rather over-rated sitcom, but still mostly pretty damn funny. Would get in on account of the "Smelly Cat" song alone.
25. Lurcio (Up Pompeii) - no, titter ye not. Any character based on an original (actually, a number of different smart slaves) created by Plautus who makes it on prime-time TV has to be worth including. Plus the character names were almost Asterix-like (Ammonia, Ludicrus, Hernia, Stovus Primus...)

Duckman! Scully! The Lone Gunmen (what a pity they got such a lame-ass episode to leave on: still shed a tear though...)

PS I think Cloud fell a little bit in love with Liza Tarbuck in Watching...

I was beginning to think I was Duckman's only fan: certainly mention of the series is normally met by blank incomprehension. If it weren't for the web I'd have begun to think I'd dreamt it. (I remember being overjoyed as a student to meet somebody else who remembered the sitcom "My Mother, The Car" which evoked similar blank looks from most people.)

Did you realise it's out on DVD now? All four series?

I missed most of the last series of 'The X-Files' (and a few others) so missed the last Lone Gunmen one. Ah well.

I think I fell a little in bit in love with Emma Wray, actually. Oh, and the first series of 'Watching' is out on DVD as well.

Blimey, I don't know who half of these are.

I agree about Claire Fisher though.

I came here looking for a first line you referenced in Rullsenberg's Hanging on the Telephone first line post... but I can't find what you mean and am only operating on minimal battery power (only 3 hours' sleep) so am being a bit ineffective!

Clare - Lisa was ahead of you, guessing that #22 in my 25 First Lines ( here )was by Blondie. You can still guess the song though.

I did warn you that my TV tastes are a bit odd...

Hmmm, might do this one myself some time. But numbers one and two would be in my list as well. Actually, in the case of Frasier it would be difficult to choose. I might end up with all five of the main cast. Plus Bulldog. Plus Eddie. In fact, might as well throw Maris in there as well!
