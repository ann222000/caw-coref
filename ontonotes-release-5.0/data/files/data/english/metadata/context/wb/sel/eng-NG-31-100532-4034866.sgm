88 Truck Wont Start after installing new battery--turns over

I changed the battery on my truck and now it won't start
Also, the lights won't come on, the fan on the hearer won't turn, noting
electrical works.  I feel sure I hooked everything on the battery cables
up right.  The starter does turn over like it should, but no electricty,
and I think that is why it won't start.  Anybody got any answers?

It is a 4 cylinder

Thanks
Daniel

Does the positive battery cable have one heavy wire and one smaller
wire? If so check the smaller wire, it may not be making a connection.
You didn't hook it up backwards by chance? Even for an instant?

No answers. Only suggestions for testing that I would follow. This may
give you something to do while waiting for answers.
Assuming that you removed the battery in the proper manner and didn't
get a short circuit while doing so:
Check the battery's cables. The positive battery terminal clamp may have
two or more cables attached to it. A fat cable and one or more thinner
cables. The fat cable goes directly to the starter and starter circuit.
You say the starter works, so that one must be OK. The thinner one(s)
work most other electrical circuits. Make sure the thinner one(s) have a
good connection to the terminal clamp and are not broken off, loose, or
corroded. If any are broken off, replace the whole cable assembly with
one from the dealer.
If they are not broken off and are still connected to the clamp, they
could be loose or corroded. You might try turning the headlight switch
on, and then jiggling the thinner cables. If the headlights flicker on
and off while jiggling, replace the whole cable as above. If they don't
flicker, well, that's about as technical as I can get.
Any other answers will have to be supplied by more knowledgeable people.

Thanks for your response.  Nissan has a positive ground, so the negative
cable is the one with all the extra wires coming out of it.

My truck has the starter cable on the negative terminal, also a small
single wire and then a small wiring harness--all three connected to the
negative terminal.  I checked to make sure all connections are tight and
clean and even checked the connections with a volt meter and they are
getting current from the battery.

Dont know what else it could be unless I blew a fuse somewhere.  Does
anyone know where the fuse box is on the 88 Nissan? or what else I could
try.  This is really confusing.

Well, like I said, you can wait for more knowledgeable answers, but I
will say that all my US Nissans had negative ground. They included an 85
Pulsar, a 93 Sentra, an 89 and 00 Maxima, and a 97 pickup.
As far as I know, the last cars that used positive ground were British
autos, and that was back in the 60's.

Did you remove the protective plastic cap from the battery terminal
posts?????
If you have voltmeter, measure the voltage across the terminals on the
cable side and on the terminal post.
Could have a bad battery?

Never saw a Nissan with a positive ground, and I've bought nothing but
Nissans ever (33 years).  I think you hooked it up backwards and blew
something.

Candidates for what blew:

The alternator diodes, or a fuse that protects them if there is one.  If you hooked it up
backwards, this DID happen, but it shouldn't stop everything else from working,
just stop the battery from charging.

The fusible link.

The wiring (but the fusible link should have gone first).

I agree -- it is hard to believe that they still make positive ground
cars because it opens up a can of worms when it comes to aftermarker
radios, plug in radar detectors and phone chargers. And those are the
simple issues!

Btw, the car will probably still turn over when you turn the key with
the battery reversed.

Check your manual or invest in a haynes manual for your truck to make
absolutely sure. I sure hope you didn't hook the thing up backwards,
because that will be very costly.

Remco

WHAT!?!?

I have an 1988 Nissan Hardbody truck, 4 cylinder.  I assure you it's
negative ground.

I did hook it up backwards.  So what do you think it likely blew?

It most likely blew anything that is not working now.
Have it towed to the dealer or a qualified service station. If you don't
know how to hook up battery cables properly, you are certainly not
qualified to work on anything more technical.

It for sure blew the diodes in the alternator, or the fuse
that protects them, IF it has such a fuse (they aren't
usual, but do exist).

What does work?  What doesn't work?  You said "noting
electical works".  If it's really nothing but the starter,
you blew the fusible link.  Think of this as a very high
amperage fuse.  It's usually a piece of wire that's
specially designed to blow.  It may come from the positive
side of the battery, it may come from where the positive
cable attaches to the starter.  I blew one once (accident
damage shorted +12 to ground), and it was very clearly
fried.  You may have more thean one fusible link, I recall
that my PF has about three.  My 240Z where I fried it had
one.

If you have an ampmeter, you may have fried that.  On the
Z, the ampmeter fried in the short too.  But it was
repairable -- the ampmeter coil was about two turns of 12
gauge wire, and it got hot and unsoldered itself.  I was
able to resolder it.  You could also just put a piece of
heavy gauge wire across the ampmeter terminals, or if
screw-on, just put both wires on one terminal.  The ampmeter
wouln't work, but the car would.

But I agree with wilshak: "If you don't know how to hook up
battery cables properly, you are certainly not qualified to
work on anything more technical.", though I'd phrase it a
little differently: "If you don't know how to hook up
battery cables properly, and took this long to figure out
that you did, you are certainly not qualified to work on
anything more technical. "
