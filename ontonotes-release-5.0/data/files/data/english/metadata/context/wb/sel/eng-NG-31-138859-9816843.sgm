*Like A Small Town*
*In A Hurry*

Our lives have become increasingly fast-paced, and the effort to keep up
often occupies all our time and attention. We are so busy rushing from point
A to point B that we forget to enjoy the ride. We race to the store without
noticing the leaves on the trees or the clouds in the sky. We go through the
checkout line feeling too pressed to converse with the cashier or the other
people in line. At the end of a day filled with this kind of frantic pace,
we may begin to wonder what it is we do all these things for, if we don't
even have the time to occasionally stop and just take it all in.

Always being rushed and in a hurry doesn't allow time for the soul to enjoy
life, which is composed of small, ordinary moments, like watching snow fall
from the sky, having a spontaneous conversation with a stranger, or
lingering over a meal for several hours. Small towns and the people who live
in them can teach us all a thing or two about living life to the fullest as
a daily matter. City people have a tendency to think that their lives are
full because they are doing so many different things, but in a small town,
there tends to be more time left open to be spontaneous or take an extended
moment of rest. This certainly doesn't mean that we can't live in a city and
enjoy life fullyâ€”we can and do; it just takes a little more awareness.

One thing we can do, wherever we live, is bring awareness breaks into our
day and take 10 minutes to simply look out the window and observe what's
happening outside. We might also choose to cultivate a relationship with
someone we see regularly, such as a clerk at the convenience mart, a
neighbor, or someone we see in the elevator at work. Taking time to have a
conversation that is not necessary is a true luxury in this day and age, as
is staring out the window. Participating in these acts of timelessness makes
the biggest city in the world start to feel a little bit more like a small
town.
