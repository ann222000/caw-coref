Trans ex-prisoner loses suit, plans appeal

The transgender former prisoner who sued the California Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation for failing to protect her from sexual
assault filed an appeal to the 1st District Court of Appeal in San
Francisco Tuesday, August 7 after a civil jury ruled against her last
week.

On August 2, after nearly two weeks of testimony, a San Francisco
Superior Court jury ruled in favor of six of the seven prison
officers. The jury deadlocked against a sergeant, which caused a
mistrial in his case, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

According to Greg Walston, the attorney for Alexis Giraldo, seven of
the 12 jurors were in agreement that Sergeant Darrel Ayers, who was
the last prison official to be notified that there was a problem, did
not follow through with responding to Giraldo's reports of alleged
rape. In a civil case, nine jurors needed to agree that Ayers failed
to adhere to prison protocol to protect Giraldo, according to Walston.

&quot;Ayers was the last one who was told and says, 'Okay, well I'll handle
it,'&quot; said Walston. &quot;So he's left with holding the bag.&quot;

The state deputy attorneys general representing the defendants were
pleased with the jury's decision.

&quot;It demonstrates that the jury agreed that the defendants did not do
anything wrong in this case,&quot; said Deputy Attorney General Jose A.
Zelidon-Zepeda. &quot;That under the circumstances, they took appropriate
action.&quot;

While Giraldo alleged she was raped, during the trial the state
elicited testimony from her during cross-examination that she did have
a brief consensual relationship with her cellmate. That later turned
to allegations of sexual assault, Giraldo said during the trial.

In response to the jury's decision, Walston filed what he called a
&quot;suicide appeal&quot; to address California's &quot;cruel and unusual
punishment&quot; clause that the superior court did not hear. If the court
agrees to take up the appeal, then all seven of the prison officials
would be tried for alleged &quot;intentional infliction of emotional
distress,&quot; Walston said.

&quot;If the state's cruel or unusual prohibition does apply to corrections
officials, which would be sickening if it didn't, we're going to wind
up with a new trial,&quot; said Walston. &quot;To recognize that contrary to the
trial court, that correction officials have far more duties to inmates
than simply the duty not to assault them or subject them to other
intentional harm.&quot;

Giraldo, 30, a Puerto Rican transgender woman, alleged in the original
lawsuit against CDCR that two inmates with whom she shared cells
between January and March 2006 repeatedly raped her. According to the
lawsuit, which was filed earlier this year, Giraldo informed multiple
prison officials during February and March 2006 that she was being
raped daily, beaten, and held &quot;hostage&quot; by her second cellmate.
Giraldo, according to the lawsuit, did not report the alleged sexual
assaults perpetrated by her first cellmate.

The lawsuit claimed Giraldo suffered emotional distress and claims
violation of the state constitution. Giraldo was paroled July 13, just
before her trial started. She had been serving a sentence for
shoplifting and a parole violation.

Giraldo told the Bay Area Reporter that by filing the appeal based on
the cruel and unusual punishment clause in the state's constitution,
she could reach her goal, which is to seek justice for other
transgender prisoners. Superior Court Judge Ellen Chaitin dismissed
Giraldo's request to create a policy to protect transgender inmates,
according to the Chronicle.

&quot;That will make them change the rules and the policy,&quot; said Giraldo in
a phone interview on August 2. &quot;I did it for those girls that are
still in there and those girls that I know that may eventually fall
into that into that terrible and drastic situation.&quot;

According to Alex Lee, director of the Transgender, Gender Variant and
Intersex Justice Project, transgender prisoners are reporting changes
in how they are being treated due to Giraldo's case.

In a statement from the CDCR that Zelidon-Zepeda read to the B.A.R.
over the phone on August 3, &quot;The department would like to emphasize
that it remains committed to ensuring the safety of every inmate
within its custody without regards to race, sex, or transgender status
or any other distinction.&quot;

While reported changes are occurring, Walston is determined to fulfill
Giraldo's goal to create policies that will protect transgender prisoners.

&quot;I look forward to making new law and recognizing rights that should
have been recognized a long time ago,&quot; Walston said.

Giraldo has returned to Southern California in compliance with her
parole orders, Walston said.
