It is every humanbeing's right to know about the Universe, about the
world we live in, about our bodies and about our true idenity which is
connected to God. The more we understand, the more we can appreicate
life and the more we can care for it.

Science was once part of the Church indeed although there were Greek
philosphers long before, knowledge had been reserved for only the few
until the Church formed universities. When Science workers discovered
knowledge of the universe that contradicted the church's teachings,
the church rejected the science workers, who later went underground,
rejected the church and became atheists because they were not able to
distinguish between man's church and God. Now science is a leading
authority in our secular world.

Today, science forbids people to say they believe the universe comes
from God, but they allow themselves to say religions are man's
invention that occurred in order to attribute superstitions and things
ancient man could not understand onto  a god. As if man invented God!

Indeed all religions have some contamination by ancient man, in that
they try to control others by saying see here it is written.
Meanwhile, Science had said almost 40 years ago, through the media,
that the universe just popped out of no where for no reason, and
accept it.

This belief is not a fact but a bias. Even though we need science and
science is here to stay, it is backed by people who do the research
and who present their findings. If science is relatively atheist what
happens is, people see no purpose or importance to life itself. They
believe they are here today and forever gone tomorrow. Then they think
they can do whatever they want, that it doesn't matter because life
itself doesn't matter.

Well, science is wrong to promote their atheists view and forgets why
it became atheist to begin with. Even though the church was wrong, God
remains real.

This is God's universe, and God created it and the world we live in
for an importance and a purpose. God desired to be experieced not just
believed in. The purpose of life, is to experience the Creator. It is
a relationship like no other. There is only God and all of life is
part of God, so imagine, science studied and worked so hard, only
studying God's intelligence and never figured that out. One day
science workers will learn that all science has ever studied has been
God because God is all that exists.

The universe did not pop out of no where for no reason, that is just
bias man talking. Bias man is saying because he can not see where the
universe came from and because he can see no reason for the universe,
then he falsely concluded that the universe came from no where for no
reason.

Not only is the universe an expression of God's intelligence. It is
made of dust. God is a spiritual being and who we are is spiritual
too. The reason why science can't put a person's mind under a
microscope is because the mind is spiritual energy. The universe is
like a glove and the life force in all of life including us, is the
hand. Indeed, God made life to experience and to enjoy life.

God is One entity governing all of existence with one intelligence.
Humankind is the fastest evolving life form on earth. Science thought
the reason man was the fastest evolving life form  was because man was
a hunter, which is not true because many carnavoires are also hunters,
then science thought it was because man has a bigger brain, no whales
have the biggest brains, and every reason science gave, such as man
making tools, etc  was because it always attempted to avoid referring
to God. That is the last thing science wants to do.

Yet, humankind is the fastest evolving life form because of its
purpose and importance to our world. We were created to nurture the
world. That requires cooperation, team work, and appreciation for all
the diverse roles humankind has. Nurturing can not happen, when life
has no meaning and money, fame, fortune, power are given more value
than people.

Nurturing our world, requires emotional intelligence which is the last
of the diverse forms of intelligences to be discovered and developed.
The life force in us is energy. There is such a thing as happiness
which generates energy and there is such a thing as sadness which robs
one of energy. Nurturing our world requires happy energy. It is a lot
of work to keep the world from being exploited and polluted, to end
deviant behavior such as crimes and war.

To have this happy energy, in order to fulfill our purpose and
importance as a life form on earth, we are the fastest growing life
form on earth because we are to experience God for only God knows how
to nurture the world and God works through us.

Proof that God works through us, even atheists! Is that God guides us
through intuition, dreams, and visions as All inventions and
discoveries came from God. As did all the universe. A galaxy with
billions of stars is slightly more complex than tv's, cars etc, so God
knows what we need to have happy lives. We need purpose and importance
as does life itself.

When we know God is with us to love and to guide us always in all
things, then we know our purpose and importance in being alive, and
this knowledge gives us happy energy to do all the things we want or
need to do. We learn that all of life is interconnected, all has
purpose and importance and we learn to appreciate all the diverse
expressions of God's immense intelligence. When we experience God
through our intuition, visions and dreams, as well as communicate
through talking and listening to God who is always with us, we
experience immense joy in being alive. There is something startling
and wonderful knowing the one who made the universe is with you to
love and to guide you in all things.

So, if Science could understand the church is not God, and the church
was governed by men who only believed in God but did not experience
God, and if science workers could know God would make their studies
and their work so much more easier and rewarding, then so many other
medical wonders and discoveries and inventions would take place.

Whether Atheists appreciate it or not, God is with them always without
exception and knows all their arguements. If they opened their hearts
and minds up to the possibility that God is part of them as they are
part of God, they would know that often seeing is believing, and  they
would be a thousand times happier than the state of atheism offers.

Virtually every discovery made by scientists is contrary to what the
bible says. A scientist does not stop believing in god because they
seek the truth, they stop believing in god because they begin the find
the truth in science.  You seem to think that if a scientist tries to
prove god, they could.  The reality is they have been trying to do
that for centuries and have failed because there is no god.

The happiest day of my life was the day that I said to myself aloud.
&quot;I am not a catholic, I AM AN ATHEIST&quot;.  The weight that was removed
from my shoulders that day was immeasurable. Only then was I truly

written hundreds of years ago, but I could seek the truth.  The bible
does not lead you to truth.  The bible leads you to faith.  In the

LL: If you turn that paragraph around to read as follows:

&gt; The universe did not pop out of no where for no reason, that is just
&gt; bias man talking. Bias man is saying because he can not see where the
&gt; universe came from and because he can see no reason for the universe,
&gt; then he falsely concluded that the universe came from no where for no
&gt; reason.

&gt; Not only is the universe an expression of God's intelligence. It is
&gt; made of dust. God is a spiritual being and who we are is spiritual
&gt; too. The reason why science can't put a person's mind under a
&gt; microscope is because the mind is spiritual energy. The universe is
&gt; like a glove and the life force in all of life including us, is the
&gt; hand. Indeed, God made life to experience and to enjoy life.

&gt; God is One entity governing all of existence with one intelligence.
&gt; Humankind is the fastest evolving life form on earth. Science thought
&gt; the reason man was the fastest evolving life form  was because man was
&gt; a hunter, which is not true because many carnavoires are also hunters,
&gt; then science thought it was because man has a bigger brain, no whales
&gt; have the biggest brains, and every reason science gave, such as man
&gt; making tools, etc  was because it always attempted to avoid referring
&gt; to God. That is the last thing science wants to do.

&gt; Yet, humankind is the fastest evolving life form because of its
&gt; purpose and importance to our world. We were created to nurture the
&gt; world. That requires cooperation, team work, and appreciation for all
&gt; the diverse roles humankind has. Nurturing can not happen, when life
&gt; has no meaning and money, fame, fortune, power are given more value
&gt; than people.

&gt; Nurturing our world, requires emotional intelligence which is the last
&gt; of the diverse forms of intelligences to be discovered and developed.
&gt; The life force in us is energy. There is such a thing as happiness
&gt; which generates energy and there is such a thing as sadness which robs
&gt; one of energy. Nurturing our world requires happy energy. It is a lot
&gt; of work to keep the world from being exploited and polluted, to end
&gt; deviant behavior such as crimes and war.

&gt; To have this happy energy, in order to fulfill our purpose and
&gt; importance as a life form on earth, we are the fastest growing life
&gt; form on earth because we are to experience God for only God knows how
&gt; to nurture the world and God works through us.

&gt; Proof that God works through us, even atheists! Is that God guides us
&gt; through intuition, dreams, and visions as All inventions and
&gt; discoveries came from God. As did all the universe. A galaxy with
&gt; billions of stars is slightly more complex than tv's, cars etc, so God
&gt; knows what we need to have happy lives. We need purpose and importance
&gt; as does life itself.

&gt; When we know God is with us to love and to guide us always in all
&gt; things, then we know our purpose and importance in being alive, and
&gt; this knowledge gives us happy energy to do all the things we want or
&gt; need to do. We learn that all of life is interconnected, all has
&gt; purpose and importance and we learn to appreciate all the diverse
&gt; expressions of God's immense intelligence. When we experience God
&gt; through our intuition, visions and dreams, as well as communicate
&gt; through talking and listening to God who is always with us, we
&gt; experience immense joy in being alive. There is something startling
&gt; and wonderful knowing the one who made the universe is with you to
&gt; love and to guide you in all things.

&gt; So, if Science could understand the church is not God, and the church
&gt; was governed by men who only believed in God but did not experience
&gt; God, and if science workers could know God would make their studies
&gt; and their work so much more easier and rewarding, then so many other
&gt; medical wonders and discoveries and inventions would take place.

&gt; Whether Atheists appreciate it or not, God is with them always without
&gt; exception and knows all their arguements. If they opened their hearts
&gt; and minds up to the possibility that God is part of them as they are
&gt; part of God, they would know that often seeing is believing, and  they
&gt; would be a thousand times happier than the state of atheism offers.

No shit Dick Tracy ?But who the fuck believes it ? Name names give us

Before beginning the examination of the evidence surrounding current
cosmology, it is important to understand what Big Bang Theory (BBT) is
and is not. Contrary to the common perception, BBT is not a theory
about the origin of the universe. Rather, it describes the development
of the universe over time. This process is often called &quot;cosmic
evolution&quot; or &quot;cosmological evolution&quot;; while the terms are used by
those both inside and outside the astronomical community, it is
important to bear in mind that BBT is completely independent of
biological evolution. Over the last several decades the basic picture
of cosmology given by BBT has been generally accepted by astronomers,
physicists and the wider scientific community. However, no similar
consensus has been reached on ideas about the ultimate origin of the
universe. This remains an area of active research and some of idea
current ideas are discussed below. That said, BBT is nevertheless
about origins -- the origin of matter, the origin of the elements, the
origin of large scale structure, the origin of the Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation, etc. All of this will be discussed in detail
below.

No science only professes to seek truth, as it is a badge of authority
like religions use to be.It has a lot of bias.  There is proof of God,
God is with each person providing guidance to each person regardless
if they believe or if they don't. Proof of God's existence is our
intuitive senses, dreams and visions.

Since we are first spiritual beings have a physical experience, the
Bible is often written metaphorically. The purpose of the Bible was to
point to God's presence in your personal life. The Bible is a
composite of what God said and what man thinks God said. To
distinquish between the two sometimes is quite challenging.

God is all there is, and discovering God is with you, is discovering
truth. The bible was written in ancient times, when science did not
exist. They did not know of billions of years, they did not know much
of what science knows today, even though science is still at a
kindergarden level for it does not know all it ever studied has been
God.

God did not pop out of no where, and the universe didn't either. No
God is not responsible for anything that causes suffering, we are. We
are responsible for crimes, for guns, for wars, and I can go to the
extreme to say we are responsible for injuries and even sickness. For
the power of the mind let alone the collective mind of humankind, is
still uncharted terrain to be explored and discovered.

The happiest day for you was when you said outloud that you were an
atheist. What came off your shoulder was all the stuff churches use to
instill fear and guilt. You are entitled to be free of both fear and
guilt. Indeed being happy is a great and natural state that I hope
will be everlasting for you.

I appreciate what you wrote.

&gt; Science forbids nothing that is truth.  If Science could prove God, it

&gt; The reality is that you can not prove what does not exist.  Nothing

&gt; &gt; One day
&gt; &gt; science workers will learn that all science has ever studied has been
&gt; &gt; God because God is all that exists.

&gt; Virtually every discovery made by scientists is contrary to what the
&gt; bible says. A scientist does not stop believing in god because they
&gt; seek the truth, they stop believing in god because they begin the find
&gt; the truth in science.  You seem to think that if a scientist tries to
&gt; prove god, they could.  The reality is they have been trying to do
&gt; that for centuries and have failed because there is no god.

&gt; &gt; The universe did not pop out of no where for no reason, that is just
&gt; &gt; bias man talking.

&gt; No scientist says the universe just popped out of nowhere.  That would
&gt; be as stupid as believing that God just popped out of nowhere... Oh
&gt; Wait, thats what you believe.  Sorry.

&gt; &gt; All inventions and
&gt; &gt; discoveries came from God.

&gt; So God is responsible for all  nuclear weapons, abortion, guns,
&gt; cancer, AIDS and the Andy Griffith Show.
&gt; God is also responsible for the discovery of evolution.  Hmm.

&gt; &gt; Whether Atheists appreciate it or not, God is with them always without
&gt; &gt; exception and knows all their arguements. If they opened their hearts

&gt; The happiest day of my life was the day that I said to myself aloud.
&gt; &quot;I am not a catholic, I AM AN ATHEIST&quot;.  The weight that was removed
&gt; from my shoulders that day was immeasurable. Only then was I truly
&gt; happy.  Why?  Because I no longer had to take the word of a book
&gt; written hundreds of years ago, but I could seek the truth.  The bible
&gt; does not lead you to truth.  The bible leads you to faith.  In the
&gt; battle of Truth vs. Faith, Truth wins every time.

Thank YOU LL for your response. Some people call God life, others call
God love, some say God is Jesus and some call him Zeus. I suppose if I
was Greek living in ancient times, so would I call him Zeus, even
though there is only one God who made the universe and was with
humankind since the beginning until now.

It is true: Atheists are certain in their conviction but this site is
Atheism versus Christianity. It is not solely an Atheism site perhaps
it should be.

&gt; You would understand why your point means nothing to atheists.

&gt; &gt; It is every humanbeing's right to know about the Universe, about the

&gt; &gt; Well, science is wrong to promote their atheists view and forgets why

&gt; &gt; This is God's universe, and God created it and the world we live in

&gt; &gt; To have this happy energy, in order to fulfill our purpose and

&gt; &gt; billions of stars is slightly more complex than tv's, cars etc, so God
&gt; &gt; knows what we need to have happy lives. We need purpose and importance
&gt; &gt; as does life itself.

&gt; &gt; When we know God is with us to love and to guide us always in all

Good points Medusa, much appreciated. There is so much of our health
care system that is abusive. Rarely do people learn that farmers often
give their livestock antibiotics and other things like growth
hormones, and these aniboiotics are injested into our system, thereby
weakening the antibiotics we take in the times we need them.

Even these these ancient little creatures are far older than us,
actually they are the first life forms on earth, we still are the
fastest evolving life form.

Also, it is a good point, what makes me think Atheists are unhappy?
Having been Agnostic, the only time I ever experienced true happiness
is when I learnt God is real simualtaneously to learning God loves me.
It is when I discovered joy is more than a 3 letter word, it is the
happy  energy denied to us by the deceptions of the world.

&gt; Virii are the fastest evolving life forms on the planet.  Why do you
&gt; think it is so difficult to keep vaccinations up to date?  The
&gt; pathogens are constantly evolving and changing, so that new vaccines
&gt; have to be formulated every year.

&gt; A huge problem has emerged with the evolution to &quot;superbugs.&quot;  These
&gt; microbes have become resistant to medications; basic evolution at
&gt; work.

&gt; &gt;We were created to nurture the
&gt; &gt; world. That requires cooperation, team work, and appreciation for all
&gt; &gt; the diverse roles humankind has. Nurturing can not happen, when life
&gt; &gt; has no meaning and money, fame, fortune, power are given more value
&gt; &gt; than people.

&gt; And this is new?  Read some basic history books; fortune and power
&gt; have always been a huge motivation for humans.

&gt; &gt; Whether Atheists appreciate it or not, God is with them always without
&gt; &gt; exception and knows all their arguements. If they opened their hearts
&gt; &gt; and minds up to the possibility that God is part of them as they are
&gt; &gt; part of God, they would know that often seeing is believing, and  they
&gt; &gt; would be a thousand times happier than the state of atheism offers.

&gt; What makes you think atheists are unhappy?

Oh Observer, you don't have to swear and insult, your words are very
informative and powerful without them. I hope you keep up with the
research, and I hope you keep exploring and discovering yourself, It
is a whole new world I am sure.

&gt; And just what do you *think* you have special knowledge about ?

&gt; &gt; Science was once part of the Church indeed although there were Greek

&gt; &gt; rejected the church and became atheists because they were not able to
&gt; &gt; distinguish between man's church and God. Now science is a leading
&gt; &gt; authority in our secular world.

&gt; Ramble ramble Yawn

&gt; &gt; Today, science forbids people to say they believe the universe comes
&gt; &gt; from God,

&gt; Observer
&gt; There are not enough pejoratives in even my vocabulary to describe the
&gt; stupidity of that statement.
&gt; &quot;science forbids&quot; are all Christians having to pass a stupidity
&gt; requirement to be admitted in to a church?

&gt;  but they allow themselves to say religions are man's

&gt; &gt; invention that occurred in order to attribute superstitions and things
&gt; &gt; ancient man could not understand onto  a god. As if man invented God!

&gt; Observer
&gt; Give us proof that it was otherwise or quit spouting off that of which
&gt; you obviously know nothing.

&gt; &gt; Indeed all religions have some contamination by ancient man, in that
&gt; &gt; they try to control others by saying see here it is written.

&gt; Observer
&gt; &quot;Some contamination by ancient man&quot; All of the myths about all of the
&gt; gods
&gt; were concocted by men/women , but mostly men seeking a priestly
&gt; domination over their fellows..
&gt; Prove otherwise.

&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Science had said almost 40 years ago, through the media,
&gt; &gt; that the universe just popped out of no where for no reason, and
&gt; &gt; accept it.

&gt; Observer

&gt; Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
&gt; You are incredibly undereducated aren't you ?
&gt; Have you ever read a science book dealing with cosmology , never mind
&gt; it is obvious that you have not.

&gt; &gt; This belief is not a fact but a bias.

&gt; Observer
&gt; No shit Dick Tracy ?But who the fuck believes it ? Name names give us
&gt; references so that we can laugh that idiot out of the real world.

&gt; Before beginning the examination of the evidence surrounding current
&gt; cosmology, it is important to understand what Big Bang Theory (BBT) is
&gt; and is not. Contrary to the common perception, BBT is not a theory
&gt; about the origin of the universe. Rather, it describes the development
&gt; of the universe over time. This process is often called &quot;cosmic
&gt; evolution&quot; or &quot;cosmological evolution&quot;; while the terms are used by
&gt; those both inside and outside the astronomical community, it is
&gt; important to bear in mind that BBT is completely independent of
&gt; biological evolution. Over the last several decades the basic picture
&gt; of cosmology given by BBT has been generally accepted by astronomers,
&gt; physicists and the wider scientific community. However, no similar
&gt; consensus has been reached on ideas about the ultimate origin of the
&gt; universe. This remains an area of active research and some of idea
&gt; current ideas are discussed below. That said, BBT is nevertheless
&gt; about origins -- the origin of matter, the origin of the elements, the
&gt; origin of large scale structure, the origin of the Cosmic Microwave
&gt; Background Radiation, etc. All of this will be discussed in detail
&gt; below.

&gt; continue here

&gt; http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html

&gt;  Even though we need science

&gt; Observer

&gt; You appearantly don't as you display no knowledge of science.

&gt; and

&gt; &gt; science is here to stay, it is backed by people who do the research
&gt; &gt; and who present their findings.

&gt; If science is relatively atheist what happens is, people see no
&gt; purpose or importance to life itself.

&gt; Observer
&gt; Are you a complete fucking moron or just quoting a mindless uneducated
&gt; dumb ass preacher/priest?

&gt; They

&gt; &gt; believe they are here today and forever gone tomorrow.

&gt; Observer
&gt; And just what makes you think that you could fathom even the smallest
&gt; portion of what unbelievers think about their world?

&gt; Then they think

&gt; &gt; they can do whatever they want, that it doesn't matter because life
&gt; &gt; itself doesn't matter.

&gt; Observer

&gt; I can't believe that such gross stupidity prevails even if it is among
&gt; Christians.

&gt; &gt; Well, science is wrong to promote their atheists view and forgets why
&gt; &gt; it became atheist to begin with.

&gt; Observer
&gt; You with your obvious double digit I.Q. and complete lack of
&gt; meaningful education.  Are such a ego maniacal  twit as to challenge
&gt; the produce of hundreds of thousands of the most intelligent ,best
&gt; trained minds in the world , who use tools you could not even
&gt; pronounce ?

&gt; Even though the church was wrong, God

&gt; &gt; remains real.

&gt; Observer
&gt; Just supply us with verifiable affirmative data that a god thing
&gt; exists .

&gt; &gt; This is God's universe, and God created it and the world we live in
&gt; &gt; for an importance and a purpose.

&gt; Observer
&gt; Pure ignorant superstitious drivel.

&gt; God desired to be experieced not just&gt; believed in.

&gt; Observer
&gt; \First you presume to tell us what the scientific comunity thinks and
&gt; now you want us to believe that you know what a purely fictive god
&gt; thing would think/want if it existed.
&gt; Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha ha Ha

&gt; The purpose of life, is
&gt; Observer
&gt; The purpose of life, is completely unknown to an ignorant fool such as
&gt; you.

&gt; to experience the Creator.

&gt; Observer
&gt; Prove that there is a creator .

&gt; It is

&gt; &gt; a relationship like no other.

&gt; Observer
&gt; Because it is total hallucination .
&gt; I have cut and pasted this for you morons enough. Look it up your
&gt; self.

&gt; http://www.reference.com/search?q=hallucination

&gt; There is only God and all of life is

&gt; &gt; part of God,

&gt; Observer
&gt; Proof

&gt; so imagine, science studied and worked so hard, only

&gt; &gt; studying God's intelligence

&gt; Observer

&gt; What intelligence the failed god hypothesis has no intelligence
&gt; What is it about no god has ever been shown to exist that you can't
&gt; understand .

&gt; If you think otherwise then give us verifiable substantiating data.
&gt; Or understand your god thing is fictive and of no value .

&gt;  and never figured that out. One day

&gt; &gt; science workers will learn that all science has ever studied has been
&gt; &gt; God because God is all that exists.

&gt; Observer
&gt; One on the most inane statements ever made and of course it came from
&gt; a Christian lunatic.

&gt; Observer
&gt; Damn you are stupid .

&gt; &gt; The universe did not pop out of no where for no reason, that is just
&gt; &gt; bias man talking. Bias man is saying because he can not see where the
&gt; &gt; universe came from and because he can see no reason for the universe,
&gt; &gt; then he falsely concluded that the universe came from no where for no
&gt; &gt; reason.

&gt; Observer
&gt; We have here on this cite , in fact he is one of the moderators ,a
&gt; working particle physicist .
&gt; Go to this cite and look at the peer reviewed scientific papers he has
&gt; published. http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=find+a+rappoc ...

&gt; Then look up his posts and learn something.

&gt; His handle is rappoccio.

&gt; &gt; Not only is the universe an expression of God's intelligence. It is
&gt; &gt; made of dust.

&gt; What fucking bullshit

Thank YOU Dave for your response. Wasn't the discovering of the Iceman
in the Italian Alps fasinating. He wore several layers of clothing,
knew to stuff his boots with insultating hay, had evidence of
acupucture and carried with him flint to spark a fire. Today we have
become so specialize due to the hard work of all those who came before
us. Even so, We could not survive should we loose our electricity, how
then could we open a can of food without our electric can openers?
Well, in the Bronze age, it was just before man discovered war as a
means of subsistence. There belief in God perhaps helped them cope and
survive in their harsh wilderness because God was with all people
throughout all the world, in every era until even now.

You know, the word &quot;God&quot; have so many meanings that I don't believe it

Science can, and I can understand why you don't like it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; God is One entity governing all of existence with one intelligence.
&gt; Humankind is the fastest evolving life form on earth. Science thought
&gt; the reason man was the fastest evolving life form  was because man was
&gt; a hunter, which is not true because many carnavoires are also hunters,
&gt; then science thought it was because man has a bigger brain, no whales
&gt; have the biggest brains, and every reason science gave, such as man
&gt; making tools, etc  was because it always attempted to avoid referring
&gt; to God. That is the last thing science wants to do.

&gt; Yet, humankind is the fastest evolving life form because of its
&gt; purpose and importance to our world. We were created to nurture the
&gt; world. That requires cooperation, team work, and appreciation for all
&gt; the diverse roles humankind has. Nurturing can not happen, when life
&gt; has no meaning and money, fame, fortune, power are given more value
&gt; than people.

&gt; Nurturing our world, requires emotional intelligence which is the last
&gt; of the diverse forms of intelligences to be discovered and developed.
&gt; The life force in us is energy. There is such a thing as happiness
&gt; which generates energy and there is such a thing as sadness which robs
&gt; one of energy. Nurturing our world requires happy energy. It is a lot
&gt; of work to keep the world from being exploited and polluted, to end
&gt; deviant behavior such as crimes and war.

&gt; To have this happy energy, in order to fulfill our purpose and
&gt; importance as a life form on earth, we are the fastest growing life
&gt; form on earth because we are to experience God for only God knows how
&gt; to nurture the world and God works through us.

&gt; Proof that God works through us, even atheists! Is that God guides us
&gt; through intuition, dreams, and visions as All inventions and
&gt; discoveries came from God. As did all the universe. A galaxy with
&gt; billions of stars is slightly more complex than tv's, cars etc, so God
&gt; knows what we need to have happy lives. We need purpose and importance
&gt; as does life itself.

&gt; When we know God is with us to love and to guide us always in all
&gt; things, then we know our purpose and importance in being alive, and
&gt; this knowledge gives us happy energy to do all the things we want or
&gt; need to do. We learn that all of life is interconnected, all has
&gt; purpose and importance and we learn to appreciate all the diverse
&gt; expressions of God's immense intelligence. When we experience God
&gt; through our intuition, visions and dreams, as well as communicate
&gt; through talking and listening to God who is always with us, we
&gt; experience immense joy in being alive. There is something startling
&gt; and wonderful knowing the one who made the universe is with you to
&gt; love and to guide you in all things.

&gt; So, if Science could understand the church is not God, and the church
&gt; was governed by men who only believed in God but did not experience
&gt; God, and if science workers could know God would make their studies
&gt; and their work so much more easier and rewarding, then so many other
&gt; medical wonders and discoveries and inventions would take place.

&gt; Whether Atheists appreciate it or not, God is with them always without
&gt; exception and knows all their arguements. If they opened their hearts
&gt; and minds up to the possibility that God is part of them as they are
&gt; part of God, they would know that often seeing is believing, and  they
&gt; would be a thousand times happier than the state of atheism offers.

We will survive even without the comforts of technology.
The question is only how many will manage to survive.

Animals manage to survive with far less then what we had, even in
ancient eras. And yet they survive.
God is a nice theory, but definitely not necessary to explain our
survival.

Yeah, that'll get us far.

An unbiased examination of the data we observe points to the

Well, your fallacious understanding of cosmology notwithstanding, I'll
attempt to educate you.

The current theories of the early universe entail one of several
possibilities:

1) The Big Bang (what you refer to): In this case, time and space
&quot;began&quot; with the universe. I say &quot;began&quot; because there is no word to
describe what actually happened. Since time itself &quot;began&quot; at the same
time, asking what was &quot;before&quot; the big bang is nonsensical, akin to
asking what is north of the north pole (it's not &quot;nothing&quot;, it's &quot;a
nonsensical question&quot;, like dividing by zero).
2) Cosmic inflationary model: The universe existed &quot;before&quot; (if such a
concept exists) the rapid inflationary phase, and our observable
universe was formed from a local fluctuation in space-time that placed
the universe in a &quot;false vacuum state&quot; (i.e. was metastable and caused
a rapid inflation).
3) Modification of the cosmic inflationary model: There is a universe
that existed &quot;forever&quot; that underwent a rapid inflation.
4) Second modification of the cosmic inflationary model: There is a
&quot;multiverse&quot; of which our universe is a part of, and other universes
may exist as well. Same thing as before, our observable universe
underwent a rapid inflationary phase due to a false vacuum
instability.

So one of these models postulates the beginning of time with the
universe, the other three don't. However, there is nothing that is
made &quot;impossible&quot; by the big bang scenario, it's just outside our
realm of intuition because our intuition relies on causality. If
causality doesn't hold (i.e. time doesn't exist), then our intuition
fails completely. So saying &quot;the universe just popped out of no where
for no reason&quot; is fallacious. &quot;Nowhere&quot; isn't defined &quot;before&quot; the big
bang, just like &quot;before&quot; isn't even defined &quot;before&quot; the big bang.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This belief is not a fact but a bias.
">

No, it's a model that explains the fact that the universe underwent a
rapid inflationary phase. There are in fact 4 models as I've described
above. There is no bias involved because these are the simplest
assumptions one can make using the tools of science as we understand
them.

Would you rather we go back to the thing that might not exist, living
in a place we don't know exists, using a magical force that no one has
observed instead?

That's not &quot;unbiased&quot;. That's called &quot;theology&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Even though we need science and
&gt; science is here to stay, it is backed by people who do the research
&gt; and who present their findings. If science is relatively atheist what
&gt; happens is, people see no purpose or importance to life itself.
&gt; They
&gt; believe they are here today and forever gone tomorrow. Then they think
&gt; they can do whatever they want, that it doesn't matter because life
&gt; itself doesn't matter.
">

This is a bunch of condescending uninformed bullshit. Religion is the
most likely candidate for destroying the life on this planet, in case
you haven't been paying attention. No scientists are strapping bombs
to themselves and blowing people up, or waging war against countries
with Muslims in it because God told them to do it.

However I'll indulge your delusional fantasy, and answer.

Atheists (not scientists, you're making a stupid false analogy) think
there is no afterlife. Instead of your stupid allegation that this
means they think life is pointless and stupid, it means precisely the
opposite to them... that life is precious, and should be cherished
while we are here, instead of worrying about appeasing a magic sky
fairy hell-bent on everyone in the world feeding into it's
narcissistic ego.

The size isn't what matters, it's the number of neural connections. In

*nearly* as complex as humans and other apes like chimpanzees. Aside
from apes (humans and chimpanzees) they have the most complex social

their brains are nearly as complex as our own. So if anything, this

&gt; &gt; about our bodies and about our true idenity which is

&gt; Which isn't demonstrated to be part of the universe you've described
&gt; (arbitrary capitalization and all).

&gt; &gt; The more we understand, the more we can appreicate
&gt; &gt; life and the more we can care for it.

&gt; &gt; Science was once part of the Church indeed although there were Greek
&gt; &gt; philosphers long before, knowledge had been reserved for only the few
&gt; &gt; until the Church formed universities.

&gt; You mean after the 1000 years that the Church actively stamped out all
&gt; scientific thought, and continued to do so until people finally
&gt; realized &quot;These people suck. I'm going to do science my way.&quot;? Do I
&gt; have to tell you that the universities started as seminaries, for the
&gt; most part?

&gt; &gt; When Science workers discovered
&gt; &gt; knowledge of the universe that contradicted the church's teachings,
&gt; &gt; the church rejected the science workers,

&gt; Surprise, surprise.

&gt; &gt; who later went underground,
&gt; &gt; rejected the church

&gt; Actually their most egregious case (Galileo) remained a staunch
&gt; Catholic his whole life. He was finally exonerated (sort of) by Pope
&gt; John Paul II in the mid-1990's.

&gt; &gt; and became atheists because they were not able to
&gt; &gt; distinguish between man's church and God. Now science is a leading
&gt; &gt; authority in our secular world.

&gt; Bravo. Very good.

&gt; &gt; Today, science forbids people to say they believe the universe comes
&gt; &gt; from God, but they allow themselves to say religions are man's
&gt; &gt; invention that occurred in order to attribute superstitions and things
&gt; &gt; ancient man could not understand onto  a god.

&gt; So instead of actually looking at the situation in an unbiased way,
&gt; you'd rather we conjectured the existence of a maximally complex being
&gt; that isn't demonstrated to exist, living in a realm that no one has
&gt; ever seen, and operates through forces that no one has ever
&gt; experienced?

&gt; Yeah, that'll get us far.

&gt; I'll clue you in as to why we don't do this: Because there is no need.
&gt; An unbiased examination of the data we observe points to the
&gt; conclusion that no God is necessary to explain it. We have other
&gt; theories that are UNBIASED that explain our observations much better.

&gt; &gt; As if man invented God!

&gt; There's no evidence otherwise.

&gt; Before beginning the examination of the evidence surrounding current
&gt; cosmology, it is important to understand what Big Bang Theory (BBT) is
&gt; and is not. Contrary to the common perception, BBT is not a theory
&gt; about the origin of the universe. Rather, it describes the development
&gt; of the universe over time. This process is often called &quot;cosmic
&gt; evolution&quot; or &quot;cosmological evolution&quot;; while the terms are used by
&gt; those both inside and outside the astronomical community, it is
&gt; important to bear in mind that BBT is completely independent of
&gt; biological evolution. Over the last several decades the basic picture
&gt; of cosmology given by BBT has been generally accepted by astronomers,
&gt; physicists and the wider scientific community. However, no similar
&gt; consensus has been reached on ideas about the ultimate origin of the
&gt; universe. This remains an area of active research and some of idea
&gt; current ideas are discussed below. That said, BBT is nevertheless
&gt; about origins -- the origin of matter, the origin of the elements, the
&gt; origin of large scale structure, the origin of the Cosmic Microwave
&gt; Background Radiation, etc. All of this will be discussed in detail

&gt; &gt; they
&gt; &gt;  would be a thousand times happier than the state of Christianity
&gt; &gt; offers.

&gt; &gt; You would understand why your point means nothing to atheists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is every humanbeing's right to know about the Universe, about the
&gt; &gt; &gt; world we live in, about our bodies and about our true idenity which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; connected to God. The more we understand, the more we can appreicate
&gt; &gt; &gt; life and the more we can care for it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Science was once part of the Church indeed although there were Greek
&gt; &gt; &gt; philosphers long before, knowledge had been reserved for only the few
&gt; &gt; &gt; until the Church formed universities. When Science workers discovered
&gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge of the universe that contradicted the church's teachings,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the church rejected the science workers, who later went underground,
&gt; &gt; &gt; rejected the church and became atheists because they were not able to
&gt; &gt; &gt; distinguish between man's church and God. Now science is a leading
&gt; &gt; &gt; authority in our secular world.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Today, science forbids people to say they believe the universe comes
&gt; &gt; &gt; from God, but they allow themselves to say religions are man's
&gt; &gt; &gt; invention that occurred in order to attribute superstitions and things
&gt; &gt; &gt; ancient man could not understand onto  a god. As if man invented God!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed all religions have some contamination by ancient man, in that
&gt; &gt; &gt; they try to control others by saying see here it is written.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Science had said almost 40 years ago, through the media,
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the universe just popped out of no where for no reason, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; accept it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This belief is not a fact but a bias. Even though we need science and
&gt; &gt; &gt; science is here to stay, it is backed by people who do the research
&gt; &gt; &gt; and who present their findings. If science is relatively atheist what
&gt; &gt; &gt; happens is, people see no purpose or importance to life itself. They
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe they are here today and forever gone tomorrow. Then they think
&gt; &gt; &gt; they can do whatever they want, that it doesn't matter because life
&gt; &gt; &gt; itself doesn't matter.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, science is wrong to promote their atheists view and forgets why
&gt; &gt; &gt; it became atheist to begin with. Even though the church was wrong, God
&gt; &gt; &gt; remains real.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is God's universe, and God created it and the world we live in
&gt; &gt; &gt; for an importance and a purpose. God desired to be experieced not just
&gt; &gt; &gt; believed in. The purpose of life, is to experience the Creator. It is
&gt; &gt; &gt; a relationship like no other. There is only God and all of life is
&gt; &gt; &gt; part of God, so imagine, science studied and worked so hard, only
&gt; &gt; &gt; studying God's intelligence and never figured that out. One day
&gt; &gt; &gt; science workers will learn that all science has ever studied has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; God because God is all that exists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The universe did not pop out of no where for no reason, that is just
&gt; &gt; &gt; bias man talking. Bias man is saying because he can not see where the
&gt; &gt; &gt; universe came from and because he can see no reason for the universe,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then he falsely concluded that the universe came from no where for no
&gt; &gt; &gt; reason.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Not only is the universe an expression of God's intelligence. It is
&gt; &gt; &gt; made of dust. God is a spiritual being and who we are is spiritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; too. The reason why science can't put a person's mind under a
&gt; &gt; &gt; microscope is because the mind is spiritual energy. The universe is
&gt; &gt; &gt; like a glove and the life force in all of life including us, is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; hand. Indeed, God made life to experience and to enjoy life.

&gt; &gt; &gt; God is One entity governing all of existence with one intelligence.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Humankind is the fastest evolving life form on earth. Science thought
&gt; &gt; &gt; the reason man was the fastest evolving life form  was because man was
&gt; &gt; &gt; a hunter, which is not true because many carnavoires are also hunters,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then science thought it was because man has a bigger brain, no whales
&gt; &gt; &gt; have the biggest brains, and every reason science gave, such as man
&gt; &gt; &gt; making tools, etc  was because it always attempted to avoid referring
&gt; &gt; &gt; to God. That is the last thing science wants to do.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet, humankind is the fastest evolving life form because of its
&gt; &gt; &gt; purpose and importance to our world. We were created to nurture the
&gt; &gt; &gt; world. That requires cooperation, team work, and appreciation for all
&gt; &gt; &gt; the diverse roles humankind has. Nurturing can not happen, when life
&gt; &gt; &gt; has no meaning and money, fame, fortune, power are given more value
&gt; &gt; &gt; than people.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nurturing our world, requires emotional intelligence which is the last
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the diverse forms of intelligences to be discovered and developed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The life force in us is energy. There is such a thing as happiness
&gt; &gt; &gt; which generates energy and there is such a thing as sadness which robs
&gt; &gt; &gt; one of energy. Nurturing our world requires happy energy. It is a lot
&gt; &gt; &gt; of work to keep the world from being exploited and polluted, to end
&gt; &gt; &gt; deviant behavior such as crimes and war.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To have this happy energy, in order to fulfill our purpose and
&gt; &gt; &gt; importance as a life form on earth, we are the fastest growing life
&gt; &gt; &gt; form on earth because we are to experience God for only God knows how
&gt; &gt; &gt; to nurture the world and God works through us.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Proof that God works through us, even atheists! Is that God guides us
&gt; &gt; &gt; through intuition, dreams, and visions as All inventions and
&gt; &gt; &gt; discoveries came from God. As did all the universe. A galaxy with
&gt; &gt; &gt; billions of stars is slightly more complex than tv's, cars etc, so God
&gt; &gt; &gt; knows what we need to have happy lives. We need purpose and importance
&gt; &gt; &gt; as does life itself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; When we know God is with us to love and to guide us always in all
&gt; &gt; &gt; things, then we know our purpose and importance in being alive, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; this knowledge gives us happy energy to do all the things we want or
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to do. We learn that all of life is interconnected, all has
&gt; &gt; &gt; purpose and importance and we learn to appreciate all the diverse
&gt; &gt; &gt; expressions of God's immense intelligence. When we experience God
&gt; &gt; &gt; through our intuition, visions and dreams, as well as communicate
&gt; &gt; &gt; through talking and listening to God who is always with us, we
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience immense joy in being alive. There is something startling
&gt; &gt; &gt; and wonderful knowing the one who made the universe is with you to
&gt; &gt; &gt; love and to guide you in all things.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, if Science could understand the church is not God, and the church
&gt; &gt; &gt; was governed by men who only believed in God but did not experience
&gt; &gt; &gt; God, and if science workers could know God would make their studies
&gt; &gt; &gt; and their work so much more easier and rewarding, then so many other
&gt; &gt; &gt; medical wonders and discoveries and inventions would take place.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether Atheists appreciate it or not, God is with them always without
&gt; &gt; &gt; exception and knows all their arguements. If they opened their hearts
&gt; &gt; &gt; and minds up to the possibility that God is part of them as they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; part of God, they would know that often seeing is believing, and  they
&gt; &gt; &gt; would be a thousand times happier than the state of atheism offers.- Hide quoted text -

Bacterium were the first, then we have animal life for s brief time,
followed by another long period of bacterium.  Then the surface of the
earth will melt long after it becomes uninhabitable and the seas will
turn blood red and boil before the sun goes supergiant - but this is
looong after animal life stops evolving at its very slow rate.

Although one argument is that we will have to engineer our planet to
continue to be habitable at some point based on the rise of carbon
isotopes.  Some estimates suggest that we are getting close to the

fossil fuel consumption.

True.  This why many people are trying to eat &quot;organic&quot; food; use of
antibiotics is not permitted on animals which will be sold as organic.

The foodchain was free of modern antibiotics and hormones in 1918,
when the influenza epidemic broke out and killed millions of people.
The causitive virus had rapidly evolved into one no humans had any
immunity to.

No, humans are not the &quot;fastest evolving&quot; life forms.  Microbes are.
Microbes go through generations in a few days, not years as the higher
animals do.

I am happy in myself and in my interactions with other people.  I do
not believe in a supreme being who loves me, provided I believe in him
and live my life as he wants me to.  Of course, this being is going to
throw me into an eternal lake of fire if I do not toe his line.  Not
believing in any gods has made me feel happier, actually.
