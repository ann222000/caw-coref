Mooring whips work best when their bent, not straight out. Now if
you've got tides to deal with, and the whips are mounted on your
bulkhead, the whips do very little, or nothing, at high tide, and are
worthless during a storm surge. If you mount them to a float they
should be OK for a light boat, but then you may have a problem with
sticking out too far.

Myself, I think their worthless, I would never use them. I've seen
many a boat on whips get beaten up in bad weather. On my cannal their
popular, with people new to boating, most of the guy's that have had
them before got rid of them long ago. And then their's the problem of
getting off and on the boat.

What problem is that?

I usually see the whips just plain used wrong.

You still need 4 lines - bow, stern, &amp; 2 spring lines, in addition to
the whip lines, &amp; properly placed fenders.

The whips are great when used properly.  With all of the lines in place,
there is no problem boarding or going ashore.

I've used the same set of whips for over 10 years now, no problem.

As Rob said, you still need the regular lines plus the whip lines,
but, at least with my boat, we have to leave one of the lines untied
from the whip until everyone is off. Then we tie off the final line to
the forward whip. You can get on and off with the whips connected but
it's easier with one untied so you can hold the boat right alongside
the dock and not drop anything or anyone in the drink.

Also, it is true that from a fixed dock or bulkhead they are useless
during high water in storms, unless you're actually out there to
frequently adjust the lines to compensate for changing water levels.

If you lease your dock space and use mooring whips, make sure that you
keep your monthly payments current.

Failing to do so could result in the marina operator securing your
vessel to the dock, and that just might attract that questionable
element that is fascinated with whips and chains. :-)
