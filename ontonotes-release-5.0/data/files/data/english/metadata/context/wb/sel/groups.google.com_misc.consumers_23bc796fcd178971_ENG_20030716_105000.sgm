Car Plows Through Calif. Market, 8 Dead
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- A car driven by an elderly man plowed
through a crowded farmers market Wednesday, killing eight and injuring
up to 45 others as the vehicle hurled victims through the air,
smashing through market tents and boxes of produce.

Police said 15 victims were critically injured, and a 3-year-old girl
was among those killed along three downtown blocks closed for the
once-a-week market, transformed within seconds into a makeshift
hospital morgue.

``It was like a hurricane just came down the center of the street,''
said Megan Sheehy, general manager of a nearby restaurant.

Police Chief James T. Butts Jr. said 20 to 30 people had moderate or
light injuries.

Butts said the 86-year-old driver told officers he couldn't stop.
``His statement is that he possibly hit the gas instead of the
brakes,'' he said.

Police did not identify the driver, but he was identified as Russell
Weller of Santa Monica by the man's neighbors. Weller is one of the
registered owners of the car, according to Department of Motor Vehicle
records.

Butts said the driver was taken to a hospital for a blood test and
initial results found no traces of alcohol or psychoactive drugs such
as antidepressants and hallucinogens.

The driver was not arrested, but authorities were considering whether
the case was ``manslaughter of some type'' and investigating whether
he was qualified to drive, Butts said.

``There may be some negligence as to his capacity to drive safely,''
Butts said, although he added that the man has a valid driver's
license.

The man left police headquarters by late afternoon. Walking unsteadily
with a cane, he hugged and smiled at people who picked him up from the
police station. He declined to comment to a reporter.

Besides the child, the dead included five women and two men, coroner's
official Juan Jimenez said. The unidentified bodies remained at the
scene late in the day as the investigation continued.

Butts said he did not have an estimate of the car's speed. Witnesses
said the red 1992 Buick was moving very fast along Arizona Avenue.

``Sixty miles per hour and it wasn't slowing down. It was flying. And
then people down, dead and everything,'' said David Lang, manager of a
shoe store along the market route.

``I heard a car just hit, bang, bang, bang,'' said Mojgan Pour, 38.
``I heard people screaming. By the time I looked, I never even saw the
car. I tried to help a man and he died while I was helping him.''

David Leifer was shopping for tropical fruit when he heard someone
scream, ``Oh my God.'' He looked around to see a street full of
bleeding, critically injured people.

He stripped off his shirt and used it to prop up the head of a badly
cut woman, then grabbed some oranges to support her legs.

``I had blood all over me,'' Leifer said.

Bahram Manahedgi, 50, said one person was on the hood of the car when
it finally came to rest, and a woman was crushed beneath it.

Manahedgi said that when he went to pull the driver out, ``he was an
old man. His eyes were open and he was alive. I said, 'Do you know
what the hell you did?' He said, 'No.' I just opened the door, I
pulled him out.''

A crowd gathered around the car and ``wanted to beat him up,''
Manahedgi said. ``I said, 'He's an old man, leave him alone.'''

Mary Roney, who has lived two doors from Weller and his wife for 30
years, said he has never had any trouble driving and she did not know
of any health problems.

``A more careful, gentle, loving person you'll never find,'' Roney
said. She described Weller as active in the community, including
serving on a library board and tutoring students at Santa Monica High
School.

The car was extensively damaged, including a smashed front end and
windshield. What appeared to be shoes were on its roof.

The injured were treated on large orange dropsheets before they were
taken to hospitals by ambulance or helicopter.

The avenue was strewn with tents collapsed around their twisted metal
frames. Handbags and shoes littered the scene.

A baby stroller sat in the street. Jerry Farias, who had been selling
potatoes and melons at the market, said he saw a woman snatch her
child from the path of the speeding car. The woman was struck, and the
child suffered a head cut, but neither appeared to have
life-threatening injuries, he said.

The Wednesday market bisects Santa Monica's popular Third Street
pedestrian promenade and is near the famous Santa Monica Pier. It
draws thousands of shoppers.

"/> Well, yes. Murder is intentional killing. With malice (intent to
cause harm). Doing something stupid is negligence. If your
negligence results in somebody getting killed, that's manslaughter (or
negligent homicide, depending on which state).

It's even possible that he wasn't negligent at all. Say he had a
small stroke the night before that affected his ability to drive
safely. He might not notice it as he got up in the morning, got
dressed, etc. Only when he (literally) ran into the farmer's market
did his inability to drive show up.

I knew somebody who had a stroke in his 30s (rare, but it happens).
He got up in the morning, shaved, got dressed, drove to work, sat down
at his desk and started to work. He thought he was fine until a
co-worker walked by and said &quot;hello&quot;. Then he discovered that he
couldn't talk. There was nothing else wrong with him, he had just
lost the area of his brain that tells the vocal chords to make speech
sounds.

He drafted a short document explaining his problem and printed several
copies. Handed one to his boss, propped one up on his desk. Drove to
the hospital(*) and handed a copy to the triage nurse.

He eventually recovered some ability to speak, but had another stroke
and died less than a year later.

So, yes, it's quite possible that this old man could have lost his
ability to drive and not known about it until he killed 8 people and
injured 45 more. Sometimes accidents just happen. It's very sad,
but it's part of life.

(*) This may not have been the wisest move - for all he knew the
stroke *could* have affected his ability to drive an unfamiliar route
even though he had driven to work without problems.

OTOH, it's possible he had a degenerative disease like Alzheimer's.
In that case, the negligence was on the part of those who allowed him
to continue driving. My father had Frontal Lobe Dementia (similar to
Alzheimers but the symptoms occur in a different order). His driving
habits were very safe, but he developed a tendency to get lost. A
couple of times he failed to complete a left turn and ended up on the
wrong side of the street (no crash, just had to turn around and go
back).

We took away his car keys, but one time he got mad at my mother over
something. While she was in another room he got her keys from her
purse and drove off somewhere. Parked the car, got out and started
walking. Eventually somebody found him and called her. We picked him
up, drove around, and eventually found the car.

We knew he shouldn't drive, even wrote to the DMV asking to have his
license revoked. The eventually did, about 8 months later. By that
time he and mother had moved to an assisted living facility. Even
then, Mother would let him drive the car up and down the parking
structure. She said &quot;not letting him drive would be taking his
manhood away&quot;. This was a combination of forgetfulness (she has some
memory loss, but not nearly as bad as his) and denial.

Luckily he never hurt anybody or damaged anything. If he had, we
would have been at least partly responsible. But it wouldn't have
been _his_ fault. People with Alzheimer's don't know that they are
losing their faculties, and won't believe you if you tell them.

"/> It may well be appropriate for us older folks to be re certified for
driving at some closer intervals.

At 73, my driving is not what it was -- I have considerable arthritis
of my neck making it difficult to swing my head around when entering
traffic or when changing lanes --- with a co-pilot there is no real
problem but there ought to be a concern.

The driver in California was in his later eighties, fifteen years on
(from me) -- who knows what dilapidations and depletions will come to
me in the next fifteen years?

An aqauntance of mine in his 60s was riding his Harley a few months
and suffered a mild stroke on the highway. He recalled what happened
- his brain telling is hand to twist the throttle or something, but
nothing happening. He managed to get off the road and stop without
getting hurt - could have easily been much more tragic.

Accidents happen. Sometimes the results are horrific. Something
beyond this old man's control could have happened. If for whatever

"/> You are correct, there 'may' be an answer or reason for this, that was not
his 'fault'. We should not prejudge him.However, on the surface, it looks
like the 'typical' driver who happens to be elderly who should no longer
have their license. We'll see. But on the other hand, CA is notorious for
sympathy towards the criminal rather than the victim. When was the last time
a prisoner who rec'd the death sentence, actually was put to death ? How
long will it take to put the lights out for Westerfield ???? I will be
curious as to the results of the investigation for this horrible
accident --with 9 dead....

"/> If it'll make you feel better, Kitty, you should know that California does,
indeed, put criminals to death.

Check out &lt;http://www.deathpenalty.org/facts/other/facts_statistics.shtml&gt;

Maybe what California does is right, . . maybe it's wrong. But, thank God
that that they do whatever they do with reticence and forethought. You
might also check out the relative stats on criminality in the states where
the death penalty is more freely applied. Is the populace of, say, Florida
or Texas, more safe than Californians?

One might also check out the figures showing the numbers of persons whose
innocence has been indisputably established after being sentenced to death,
or even after having been put to death. So far as we now know, DNA doesn't
lie, or make mistakes. Yet, DNA tests have proven beyond doubt that many,
many criminal defendants have been wrongfully convicted.

Is one to suppose that's just tough luck, and better them than me? Or that
they ALL must have done something, and probably had it coming anyhow?

I'm all for tough criminal penalties. Lock 'em up. Throw the key into the
deepest nearby river. Make penal servitude as difficult and punitive as you
care to.

But, count me among those who believe that the imposition of the death
penalty does far, far more damage to society than it is given credit for.

Somehow, all but six of the world's nations now blunder along somehow
without resorting to the death penalty.

I haven't looked at the figures over the past several years. But, when I
last checked, the United States had the distinction of not only resorting to
the death penalty, but also of sending a greater proportion of it's
population to prison, for longer periods, than any nation on earth.

There! . . . Now you can sleep better.

"/> There was a movement to do that in California. The elder lobby opposed
it on the grounds that it was age discrimination. And indeed, people
of any age can be bad drivers, and older people are *mostly* better
drivers than younger ones. More skill acquired over the years -- and
more patience -- compensates for increased reaction time etc.

But I, like you, think it is not a major imposition to take a behind
the wheel test every few years and maybe a written test every year. I
think that would be a good idea. Whether it would be legal under
Federal laws against age discrimination remains to be seen.

vision/hearing are unimpaired, there is no reason not to continue
driving. But some people lose the ability to drive safely at 70 or
younger. My father was about 77 when his mental deterioration made it
unsafe for him to drive. But my father-in-law was still driving the
day before he died at age 89. Not that he was a particularly great
driver -- his car had several minor dents in it -- but as far as we
can tell he was no worse at 89 than he had been at 30. And my
mother-in-law stopped driving at night in her 60s because she found
oncoming headlights seemed to draw her toward them. She stopped
driving at all at about 80 because of macular degeneration -- she
could no longer see well enough to drive. (And I was printing books
from The Gutenberg Project in 60-point type so she could read them --
that means a capital M is over 3/4&quot; wide.)

&gt;&gt; Car Plows Through Calif. Market, 8 Dead
&gt;&gt; By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

&gt;&gt; SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- A car driven by an elderly man plowed
&gt;&gt; through a crowded farmers market Wednesday, killing eight and injuring
&gt;&gt; up to 45 others as the vehicle hurled victims through the air,
&gt;&gt; smashing through market tents and boxes of produce.

&gt;&gt; Police said 15 victims were critically injured, and a 3-year-old girl
&gt;&gt; was among those killed along three downtown blocks closed for the
&gt;&gt; once-a-week market, transformed within seconds into a makeshift
&gt;&gt; hospital morgue.

&gt;&gt; ``It was like a hurricane just came down the center of the street,''
&gt;&gt; said Megan Sheehy, general manager of a nearby restaurant.

&gt;&gt; Police Chief James T. Butts Jr. said 20 to 30 people had moderate or
&gt;&gt; light injuries.

&gt;&gt; Butts said the 86-year-old driver told officers he couldn't stop.
&gt;&gt; ``His statement is that he possibly hit the gas instead of the
&gt;&gt; brakes,'' he said.

&gt;&gt; Police did not identify the driver, but he was identified as Russell
&gt;&gt; Weller of Santa Monica by the man's neighbors. Weller is one of the
&gt;&gt; registered owners of the car, according to Department of Motor Vehicle
&gt;&gt; records.

&gt;&gt; Butts said the driver was taken to a hospital for a blood test and
&gt;&gt; initial results found no traces of alcohol or psychoactive drugs such
&gt;&gt; as antidepressants and hallucinogens.

&gt;&gt; The driver was not arrested, but authorities were considering whether
&gt;&gt; the case was ``manslaughter of some type'' and investigating whether
&gt;&gt; he was qualified to drive, Butts said.

&gt;&gt; ``There may be some negligence as to his capacity to drive safely,''
&gt;&gt; Butts said, although he added that the man has a valid driver's
&gt;&gt; license.

&gt;&gt; The man left police headquarters by late afternoon. Walking unsteadily
&gt;&gt; with a cane, he hugged and smiled at people who picked him up from the
&gt;&gt; police station. He declined to comment to a reporter.

&gt;&gt; Besides the child, the dead included five women and two men, coroner's
&gt;&gt; official Juan Jimenez said. The unidentified bodies remained at the
&gt;&gt; scene late in the day as the investigation continued.

&gt;&gt; Butts said he did not have an estimate of the car's speed. Witnesses
&gt;&gt; said the red 1992 Buick was moving very fast along Arizona Avenue.

&gt;&gt; ``Sixty miles per hour and it wasn't slowing down. It was flying. And
&gt;&gt; then people down, dead and everything,'' said David Lang, manager of a
&gt;&gt; shoe store along the market route.

&gt;&gt; ``I heard a car just hit, bang, bang, bang,'' said Mojgan Pour, 38.
&gt;&gt; ``I heard people screaming. By the time I looked, I never even saw the
&gt;&gt; car. I tried to help a man and he died while I was helping him.''

&gt;&gt; David Leifer was shopping for tropical fruit when he heard someone
&gt;&gt; scream, ``Oh my God.'' He looked around to see a street full of
&gt;&gt; bleeding, critically injured people.

&gt;&gt; He stripped off his shirt and used it to prop up the head of a badly
&gt;&gt; cut woman, then grabbed some oranges to support her legs.

&gt;&gt; ``I had blood all over me,'' Leifer said.

&gt;&gt; Bahram Manahedgi, 50, said one person was on the hood of the car when
&gt;&gt; it finally came to rest, and a woman was crushed beneath it.

&gt;&gt; Manahedgi said that when he went to pull the driver out, ``he was an
&gt;&gt; old man. His eyes were open and he was alive. I said, 'Do you know
&gt;&gt; what the hell you did?' He said, 'No.' I just opened the door, I
&gt;&gt; pulled him out.''

&gt;&gt; A crowd gathered around the car and ``wanted to beat him up,''
&gt;&gt; Manahedgi said. ``I said, 'He's an old man, leave him alone.'''

&gt;&gt; Mary Roney, who has lived two doors from Weller and his wife for 30
&gt;&gt; years, said he has never had any trouble driving and she did not know
&gt;&gt; of any health problems.

&gt;&gt; ``A more careful, gentle, loving person you'll never find,'' Roney
&gt;&gt; said. She described Weller as active in the community, including
&gt;&gt; serving on a library board and tutoring students at Santa Monica High
&gt;&gt; School.

&gt;&gt; The car was extensively damaged, including a smashed front end and
&gt;&gt; windshield. What appeared to be shoes were on its roof.

&gt;&gt; The injured were treated on large orange dropsheets before they were
&gt;&gt; taken to hospitals by ambulance or helicopter.

&gt;&gt; The avenue was strewn with tents collapsed around their twisted metal
&gt;&gt; frames. Handbags and shoes littered the scene.

&gt;&gt; A baby stroller sat in the street. Jerry Farias, who had been selling
&gt;&gt; potatoes and melons at the market, said he saw a woman snatch her
&gt;&gt; child from the path of the speeding car. The woman was struck, and the
&gt;&gt; child suffered a head cut, but neither appeared to have
&gt;&gt; life-threatening injuries, he said.

&gt;&gt; The Wednesday market bisects Santa Monica's popular Third Street
&gt;&gt; pedestrian promenade and is near the famous Santa Monica Pier. It
&gt;&gt; draws thousands of shoppers.

I know I've told this story, but I'm not sure it was at alt.true-crime.

My father had macular degeneration. He told me that he was &quot;legally blind&quot;,
and that he was getting a deduction on his federal income taxes because of
it...yet he continued to drive. I said, &quot;Daddy, the State of Texas doesn't
like blind people driving on their streets and highways. The IRS will tell
the State about your exemption, and they're going to take away your
license.&quot; He said, &quot;Oh, no; those are two separate entities; they won't
know.&quot; Then later, the State called him in to question him about it, and
ultimately, the State limited him to driving in his neighborhood at no more
than 45 mph, and he wasn't supposed to go onto freeways or interstates. He
said, &quot;Somebody told me the State and the Federal Government would get
together.&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, that was me.&quot;&quot;No, it wasn't you; it was somebody
else.&quot;

I think it's awful that someone getting the &quot;blind&quot; exemption is allowed to
drive at even 45 mph.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ``There may be some negligence as to his capacity to drive
safely,''
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Butts said, although he added that the man has a valid driver's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; license.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No murder 1? No &quot;50 years&quot; with no parole? 8 people dead,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 45 injured, and they're convinced &quot;there may be some
&gt;&gt;&gt; negligence as to his capacity to drive safely&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Hey don't act surprised--we're talkin bout California !!!!

&gt; This wouldn't likely be murder in any state. Murder requires intent.
&gt; First degree murder requires malice in advance. Unless you think this
&gt; old man got in his car with the intent to go run people down, your are
&gt; going nowhere with a cry for murder charges.

&gt; As another reply stated, this may not even be a case of negligence.
&gt; An aqauntance of mine in his 60s was riding his Harley a few months
&gt; and suffered a mild stroke on the highway. He recalled what happened
&gt; - his brain telling is hand to twist the throttle or something, but
&gt; nothing happening. He managed to get off the road and stop without
&gt; getting hurt - could have easily been much more tragic.

&gt; Accidents happen. Sometimes the results are horrific. Something
&gt; beyond this old man's control could have happened. If for whatever
&gt; reason this guy lost control of his car and ran over a fire hydrant or
&gt; a mailbox, we would all be laughing. Just because, tragically, he ran
&gt; over a lot of people, it doesn't mean he should get the chair.

&gt; Of course we may learn more that will change we all think about
&gt; it.....

"/> That's how I feel about this too. First thing I thought was maybe a mild
stroke. Strokes can make people do odd things when the stroke isn't enough
to cause the person to go unconscious. I don't blame the old guy (yet), I
feel sorry for him and all involved. I maybe blame the system for not
coming up with something, like yearly road testing for the older
generation. They have always threatened that over the years, but have
done nothing. I don't think that would be discrimination any more than
restricting a person with epilepsy, or some other medical reason. I've
read way too many stories in the papers of elderly causing fatality-type
accidents.

&gt;If it'll make you feel better, Kitty, you should know that California does,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Maybe what California does is right, . . maybe it's wrong. But, thank God
&gt;that that they do whatever they do with reticence and forethought. You
&gt;might also check out the relative stats on criminality in the states where
&gt;the death penalty is more freely applied. Is the populace of, say, Florida
&gt;or Texas, more safe than Californians?

&gt;One might also check out the figures showing the numbers of persons whose
&gt;innocence has been indisputably established after being sentenced to death,
&gt;or even after having been put to death. So far as we now know, DNA doesn't
&gt;lie, or make mistakes. Yet, DNA tests have proven beyond doubt that many,
&gt;many criminal defendants have been wrongfully convicted.

them. If there are a few innocents on death row, think how many more

&gt;deepest nearby river. Make penal servitude as difficult and punitive as you
&gt;care to.

&gt;But, count me among those who believe that the imposition of the death
&gt;penalty does far, far more damage to society than it is given credit for.

&gt;Somehow, all but six of the world's nations now blunder along somehow

Some people deserve worse than death, but torture is cruel.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;I haven't looked at the figures over the past several years. But, when I

&gt;the death penalty, but also of sending a greater proportion of it's

We arrest approximately 3/4 of a million every year on people for

Violent crime is something we should take seriously, but someone smoking
a little grass isn't something we should even be interested in.

Warehousing criminals is a relatively new idea historically speaking.

Life is filled with consequences, and the severity of those consequences
needs to match the severity of whatever it is that they did.

Killing another human being is something that should have severe
consequences. Can you actually imagine actually murdering someone
yourself? (Probably not, I'm hoping). It's just unthinkable for most

"/> Kitty, m'dear, discussions work best when those who participate either
listen to what the other has to say or read it. I answered your question, .
. specifically. And, I amplified my opposition to the so-called 'country
club' prisons we have all read and heard about.

BTW, do you happen to have specific knowledge regarding the conditions
within California's prisons? . . . If you did you'd know that 'college'
opportunities are few and far between, and only for prisoners who are
adjudged to have real hope of rehab. Conjugal visits? Again, few and far
between, but, in any event, what is the harm in attempting to have what is
possibly the ONLY positive aspect of a con's life continue, . . will it make
him less of a risk when he gets out? Sure, some cons get married to the
dippy women who seem drawn to write them endlessly, but I've not read of any
such marriage being consumated whilst the incarceration continues.
Marriage, like barely adequate legal counsel, is a right assured us all by
our Constitution. Finally, as for lawsuits, it seems that no one has yet
figured out a way to stop frivolous lawsuits, whether by prisoners or others
(though many people have diligently tried, [me among them], and gazillions
of hours of thought and discussion have been devoted to the subject). . . As
I said before, rest easy. California does indeed execute some of its
criminals, . . though clearly not so many as you'd like. (Of course, you
could always move to Texas or Florida.) And, regardless of what you may see
on TV, doin' time in a Cal prison is no picnic. Indeed, Pelican Bay,
Folsom, San Quentin, et al, are among the nation's toughest. Hopefully,
California will continue its efforts to avoid confining, say for example, a
kid who, for the first time, joyrides a car with hardened cons who are
recidivist, gang-related, violence prone, and racist. After all, it's not
really unheard of for SOME people to learn their lesson and reform their
lives.

&gt;It's a sad coincidence, but something very similar happened in Phoenix in
&gt;the last year or two. An elderly woman plowed through an art fair; I forget
&gt;if anyone was killed or not, but I think a couple people were. She said a
&gt;garbage can she keeps in the car got jammed under her pedals or some
&gt;such thing. She wasn't charged with anything. There were the usual rumblings
&gt;about increased driver testing for the elderly, but of course nothing
&gt;happened.

"/> I think that may have been right within a half-mile from where I work.
Either that or there was another similar incident in the area.

I just wanted to add that I too am suspicious of this driver. I am
not convinced that it was an accident. I think it is possible that
this man was upset that the road was closed for the farmer's market,
and was determined to use the road regardless. Again, I am only
saying this is possible, but my reasons are:
1) Initial reports from witnesses said that the man had a
&quot;determined&quot; look on his face
2) He seems to have a lack of remorse -- only says that he made a
mistake.
3) It's hard to believe he wasn't able to take his foot of the gas
(I wonder what finally stopped him...)

Just my two cents ...
I would like to hear more from the police about what the old man told
them.

Car crash may have started market tragedy

10th victim to die a 7-month-old boy

By Henry Weinstein, Doug Smith and Carl Ingram
Los Angeles Times Staff Writers
Published July 18, 2003, 7:01 AM CDT

LOS ANGELES -- An elderly driver was apparently set on his deadly
course through the Santa Monica Farmers' Market by a collision with
another car, police and an eyewitness said Thursday as new evidence
emerged in the investigation into the tragedy.

A 7-month-old boy became the 10th victim to die.

Officials said it could take three weeks to determine whether
86-year-old George Russell Weller committed a crime Wednesday when he
drove his maroon Buick sedan at high speed through the market, sending
bodies catapulting and transforming a serene afternoon into a day of
horror.

In the still-vivid aftermath of the crash, attention turned both to
grief for those who died and to issues of blame: whether to charge
Weller, and whether the city of Santa Monica shares responsibility for
failing to install sturdy barriers at either end of the site where the
twice-weekly market is held.

Weller's lawyer, Vicki I. Podberesky, said she had &quot;no indication
whatsoever that he's going to be charged As far as we know, Mr. Weller
is being treated as a witness.&quot;

The California Highway Patrol impounded a Mercedes that, authorities
said, apparently was involved in an accident with Weller's car just
before he sped into the market.

A high-level CHP source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
agency is interested in a witness' report that Weller may have crashed
into the Mercedes, turned his vehicle around -- either because he was
disoriented or because he was attempting to flee -- and then plowed
into the farmers market.

The source stressed that he could not confirm the validity of that
account. Another source familiar with the investigation cautioned that
physical evidence from the scene indicated Weller may have lost
control of his car, then hit the Mercedes on his way into the market.

Investigators also said an inspection of Weller's home had shown that
his car had repeatedly hit the wall of his garage.

In another development, several Los Angeles television stations played
a videotape Thursday that purported to show Weller in the immediate
aftermath of a minor accident 10 years ago. The tape was made by a man
who said the accident, in which a Buick LeSabre crashed into a
retaining wall, raised questions about Weller's ability to drive.

The chief of the California Highway Patrol called Thursday on the
Legislature to consider requiring motorists older than 75 to pass a
behind-the-wheel test as a condition of renewing their licenses.

Commissioner D.O. &quot;Spike&quot; Helmick stressed that he had reached no
conclusion on whether Weller's age played a part in the crash. But he
said the case focuses attention on whether elderly drivers should be
tested more thoroughly and frequently than others.

&quot;At some point, other people have the right to have some safety out
there,&quot; Helmick told reporters.

Meanwhile, along Santa Monica's Arizona Avenue, which had been a
colorful scene of summer bounty until Weller's Buick sped through just
before 2 p.m. Wednesday, a dozen cleanup workers were on their hands
and knees. They systematically scrubbed and tarred over areas where
bright orange, teal and red spray paint markings had denoted the
locations of bodies and evidence. Patches of fresh tar dotted the
street, marking the car's fatal route.

More than 50 people were hospitalized with injuries suffered in the
mayhem. The crash claimed its 10th and youngest victim Thursday when
Brandon Davidi died early in the afternoon at UCLA Mattel Children's
Hospital, the coroner's office said. He had been at the market with
his grandmother, Molok Ghoulian Nabatian, who was also killed.

Brandon suffered severe head injuries and had been the first patient
admitted to Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center after the accident. He
was later transferred to the children's hospital in Westwood.

Dr. Lawrence Schecter, the Santa Monica center's medical director,
said the hospital first learned of the disaster when police arrived
with Brandon. Expressing sympathy for the boy's parents, the doctor
said: &quot;There is nothing worse in the world.&quot;

Eight victims of the crash, including a 3-year-old girl, have been
identified by the Los Angeles County coroner's office. The identity of
a ninth was confirmed by friends, while another has been identified by
law enforcement sources but not confirmed.

At the crash scene, candles, flowers, stuffed animals and cards were
left beneath a dolphin sculpture in front of Cafe Promenade, in the
heart of the market area. Carole Moritz Pauken, 41, of Santa Monica
pushed her 2-year-old daughter while clutching a bouquet.

&quot;When I heard about the little girl getting killed, it really hit a
nerve,&quot; she said, motioning toward her daughter, who was kicking off
her shoes and sucking a lollipop while giggling.

Similar emotions were expressed by Weller's pastor, the Rev. Stephen
C. Lien of Brentwood Presbyterian Church.

Lien described his meeting with Weller and his wife after the crash.
At one point, the minister recalled, he embraced Weller and said,
&quot;Russ, we are praying for you. He said, 'Pray for all of the others
affected by this.' &quot;

Lien said he had told church staff that &quot;if our faith means anything
to us, it's got to mean something at a time like this.

&quot;If we believe our faith is relevant to life, to senseless tragedies,
to accidents, to cataclysmic events,&quot; he said, &quot;it's got to be real at
a time like this.&quot;

Potential charges against Weller range from negligent manslaughter to
homicide, but some legal experts expressed doubt that he would ever be
sentenced to jail.

One of the state's top experts on vehicular homicide law, Pasadena
attorney Richard A. Hutton, said he doubted that Weller would face
serious charges.

The California Penal Code allows for charges of murder, manslaughter
with gross negligence or manslaughter with ordinary negligence in
cases in which a sober driver kills someone while driving a car.

&quot;As I understand the facts, he probably hit the accelerator rather
than the brake,&quot; Hutton said. &quot;That is ordinary negligence.&quot;

For vehicular manslaughter with ordinary negligence, the maximum
sentence would be one year in jail per count. Hutton said he doubted
that Weller would get such a sentence, given his age and clean
criminal and driving record.

One potential complication emerged Thursday with the broadcast of the
videotape purporting to show Weller's car shortly after he crashed it
into a retaining wall at a party in 1993.

A man who identified himself as Chuck Morrell said he was a friend of
Weller's and had made the videotape as a joke. He said that nobody was
hurt in the accident, but that it left him wondering if Weller should
be driving.

&quot;I saw him last night on the TV and said, 'Wait a minute. I know this
guy,' &quot; Morrell said in a telephone interview.&quot;

Even if Weller is not charged with a crime, Santa Monica attorney
Larry Feldman said, the families of those killed may have a strong
personal-injury case against him. But it is unlikely that Weller, or
any individual, would be insured for the amount of damage involved in
Wednesday's crash, Feldman added.

&quot;The real issue,&quot; he said, &quot;is who else is liable.&quot;

One likely entity is the city of Santa Monica, which could face claims
for failing to have a barrier that could have prevented the carnage.
Several people who work around the market have raised questions about
that issue.

&quot;In the back of my mind, I knew that something like this could
happen,&quot; said Mike Ayoub, 44, owner of Gift Time, a jewelry and watch
store in the Third Street Promenade a block from the accident scene.
&quot;They never had cement barriers to block cars. You would think with
all this talk about terrorists, they would have something.&quot;

The market, which draws about 9,000 people Wednesdays and also
operates Saturdays, is separated from traffic by wooden sawhorses and
signs. Santa Monica officials said Thursday that they would consider
strengthening the barriers.

the
adults? Are the adults chopped liver or something?

And yes, I'm a parent, I still feel that way (just in case many of you
annoying parents want to go off on how &quot;when you become a parent

are the deaths of adults somehow less tragic. Never mind that they

being as innocent in cases like this is nonsense. A life is a life.

&gt;&gt;One might also check out the figures showing the numbers of persons whose
&gt;&gt;innocence has been indisputably established after being sentenced to death,
&gt;&gt;or even after having been put to death. So far as we now know, DNA doesn't
&gt;&gt;lie, or make mistakes. Yet, DNA tests have proven beyond doubt that many,
&gt;&gt;many criminal defendants have been wrongfully convicted.

"/> DNA tests have shown that some (not many) suspects may have not been
the primary criminal. That does not mean they are innocent.

If I pay someone to murder someone, my DNA won't be there, but that
does not make me innocent.

However, I do believe that a majority of those who have been released
due to new DNA evidence were in fact innocent, just not to the degree
that you do.

In Illinois, for example, our previous governor let everyone off of
death row whether they were guilty or not. He even freed the first 5,
even though they were career criminals, just in case the police lied.

I am all for reforming the way that police and courts treat people,
but the overwhelming majority of people in jail are guilty.

"/> Not all cultures react the way we do.

In the Arabic culture, for example, there is a classic situation:

A man is out in a rowboat with his mother, his wife, and his child.

The boat springs a leak. He can save only one. Which does he choose?

We, in the West, would automatically opt for the child, because it
hasn't yet had a chance to live its life.

But the Arab mind thinks differently: The man can get another wife,
he can get another child, but he has only one mother. So she
gets saved.

&gt;Look at the first chart. Fatalities start to skyrocket after age 74.

"/> When I've looked at the numbers, it turned out that what really happens is
not that they crash more severely, but that they crash in roughly the same
manner as everyone else. They are just more fragile and die in lesser and
lesser crashes as they age.

That said, I think there should be retests for all drivers every 10 years
and if the passing score was, say, 70%, anyone scoring less than 90% would
need to be retested every 5 years until their score again exceeds 90%.
Also, there would be tracking of scores to crashes, and if a link is found,
then the insurance agencies could surcharge those who score worse.

This would not only retest, but encourage people to take the tests
seriously and focus on their driving.

July 19, 2003
Elderly Driver May Have Had Earlier Crash
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Investigators believe an elderly driver who
crashed through a crowded farmers market, killing 10 people, may have
been speeding away from the scene of a collision at the time.

Russell Weller, 86, might have hit a Mercedes after leaving a post
office, then fled less than a block west toward the street market,
said Tom Marshall, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol.
Details about the Mercedes crash were not immediately available.

``We're trying to do two things: determine first of all that he hit
the Mercedes, and two, what his motivation was for leaving if he did
hit it,'' Marshall said. ``He could have been confused, he could have
been scared and tried to get away, we just don't know at this point.''

Like Weller's Buick sedan, the Mercedes has been impounded and is
being examined, Marshall said.

Weller's attorney, Jim Bianco, released a statement Wednesday saying
the farmers market crash was an accident. He and another attorney for
Weller did not return calls for comment Friday.

Police have said Weller told them he didn't realize until too late
that Arizona Avenue, crammed with pedestrians and produce Wednesday,
was closed to traffic. They said Weller believes he might have hit the
gas instead of the brake as he tried to stop.

Witnesses said Weller's car sped down the entire length of the
open-air market, knocking down stalls, scattering produce and hitting
as many as 50 people. Ten victims, ranging in age from 7 months to 78
years, were killed.

The market was reopening Saturday, with a memorial service for the
victims.

``The market will go on as planned,'' city spokeswoman Judy Rambo
said. Santa Monica Mayor Richard Bloom and local religious leaders
were to speak.

At least 13 people remained hospitalized Friday, three of them in
critical condition. Officials at two of the hospitals where victims
were taken did not immediately return calls seeking the number of
patients still in their care.

Marshall said it could take weeks for the CHP and Santa Monica
authorities to complete their investigation. Santa Monica police Lt.
Frank Fabrega said his department wasn't releasing any information
about the investigation.

86-Year-Old Driver Plows Through Calif. Market

His statement is that he hit the gas instead of the brake while having
sex
with 28-year-old woman. the 86-Year-Old man took to much viagra and
went crazy
he said look baby hoe long and big it is lets doit now. while trying
to pull over he
put his foot on the gas not the brake and plowed through a crowded
farmers market
Wednesday, killing eight and injuring up to 45 others as the vehicle
hurled victims
through the air, smashing through market tents and boxes of produce.

Police said 15 victims were critically injured, and a 3-year-old girl
was among those
killed along three downtown blocks closed for the once-a-week market,

within seconds into a makeshift hospital morgue.

&quot;It was like a hurricane just came down the center of the street,&quot;
said Megan Sheehy,
general manager of a nearby restaurant.

Police Chief James T. Butts Jr. said 20 to 30 people had moderate or
light injuries.

Butts said the 86-year-old driver told officers he couldn't stop.

&gt;Drunks don't scare me. The number that do the truly unpredictable things
&gt;(wrong way on a freeway) are pretty small. The alcohol related crashes are
&gt;more likely a drunk that reacts slow or with poor judgement. Most drunks
&gt;are on the road late at night. If you just realize this and treat all
&gt;other drivers as incompetent at night, you will have few problems (it also
&gt;helps to treat all drivers during the day as incompetent as well).

"/> YES.

The last time I went to drivers school for a ticket, the instructor,
who worked for Northwestern University, gave statistics for how many
drunks are on the road when.

Now, these statistics are probably fictional, but just in case...

Friday/Saturday night between about 10PM and 2AM were the worst.

Yet, midday on any day still had high numbers.

The point I took away is that there are always drunks on the road.
That coupled with the majority of the population being incapable of
driving correctly, well, that leads me to your point.

"/> You seem to have an odd idea of life in prison. If you go to prison,
you will wake up when you are told to, not when you want to. You will
eat your 3 meals a day when you are told to. You will shower when you
are told to. If you get to watch TV, the prison will decide what
shows are allowable. And even among the allowable shows, the choice
will be made by some group of people who have to share the TV. It's
possible you might be listened to when that choice is made, or maybe
not.

You can forget about sex unless you are married or can con somebody
into marrying you. If you _do_ get &quot;conjugal visits&quot;, you might get
to see your spouse, alone, for maybe 1 hour once a month. If you're
unmarried, forget about going to a bar to pick up a girl or paying a
prostitute. That's right out. Unless you like to have sex with other
people of the same sex. Then maybe you can find a corner to hide in
where the guards won't see you. If you get caught, you can expect to
be punished further -- solitary confinement and/or an increase in your
sentence. Or, if you _don't_ swing that way, you better be careful to
stay _out_ of such corners, lest some older and stronger con rape you.

Of course, we have several kinds of prison. There are minimum
security prisons where the convicts have individual cells, maybe
individual TVs and maybe even Internet access. You know who gets
sent to these &quot;country club&quot; prisons? White collar criminals, people
who are convicted of insider trading or embezzlement or something.
Most of them used to live in multi-room houses, with fancy stereo
systems, the latest PCs, etc. Now they get a cell with a 17&quot; TV and a
couple of hours a day on a 5-year-old computer with a 14&quot; screen. And
forget about going out to your favorite French restaurant. You get
what the prison cook feels like cooking.

Murderers don't qualify for &quot;minimum security&quot;. They go into &quot;medium&quot;
or &quot;maximum security&quot; prisons.

And btw, people may have forgotten to mention that some of the guards
are sadists. They're mostly too smart to get caught beating somebody
up for no reason, but you can bet if they catch somebody sleeping
during the day they'll wake them up and send them off to exercise or
take a shower or something.

If you think prison is so much better than life outside, ask yourself
why there are so many homeless people wandering the streets, huddling
over steam vents for heat, digging through dumpsters for food. All
they have to do is commit a crime and they can go to prison. They
would get a bed to sleep in (instead of concrete), it never gets

"/> Interesting variation of the Felony Murder Rule. Almost every state
has it, but there _still_ has to be an intention to commit a felony,
even if not to kill.

It's a lot stricter in California. Only certain felonies qualify
(assault, robbery, arson, burglary, a couple more) and there has to be
a fairly direct connection between the accused's actions and the
death.

One case I heard about: a guy started a fistfight (assault) which
escalated into a mass beating and the person punched ended up getting
beaten to death. The guy who threw the first punch was convicted
under Felony Murder. He started a mass fight, and somebody getting
killed was a predictable result of that.

Other cases, _especially_ ones where a witness just dropped dead of a
heart attack, haven't held up in court in CA.

There have been a few prosecutions for _second_ degree murder for
drunk driving, on the basis that driving in that condition constituted
_gross_negligence_ (which can be considered a form of intent in some
cases). AFAIK all those cases were plea bargained. I don't think
anybody has gotten a murder conviction on that theory -- in CA
at least.

if nobody got hurt, and a felony if somebody was hurt in the original
accident. But it's not one of the felonies on the CA list to qualify
for Felony Murder.

It doesn't look like he had a sudden stroke, which would excuse him.
In fact, he had a history of hitting his own garage wall, and at least
once ran into his neighbor's wall. At the least he's probably guilty
of negligent manslaughter, just for driving when he should have known
he wasn't in any shape to do so.

It could have been my Dad. He continued driving for maybe a year
after he really shouldn't have done so. He wasn't under my control,
so I didn't have any legal basis to take his car away, but we got him
to mostly stop driving after he and Mom moved to an assisted living
facility.

He died last month so I don't have to worry about that any more.

&gt; You seem to have an odd idea of life in prison. If you go to prison,
&gt; you will wake up when you are told to, not when you want to. You will
&gt; eat your 3 meals a day when you are told to. You will shower when you
&gt; are told to. If you get to watch TV, the prison will decide what
&gt; shows are allowable. And even among the allowable shows, the choice
&gt; will be made by some group of people who have to share the TV. It's
&gt; possible you might be listened to when that choice is made, or maybe
&gt; not.

&gt; You can forget about sex unless you are married or can con somebody

&gt; unmarried, forget about going to a bar to pick up a girl or paying a
&gt; prostitute. That's right out. Unless you like to have sex with other
&gt; people of the same sex. Then maybe you can find a corner to hide in
&gt; where the guards won't see you.

"/> Even though homosexual sex in prison is officially against the rules,
it is actually encouraged by prison officials, usually. And many times,
this &quot;sex&quot; is nothing more than predatory rape by stronger, more violent
inmates against the smaller, weaker ones. This has long been a part
of prison life in America, but has gotten worse since the integration of
inmates in the '60s. Most rapes involve blacks raping whites, contrary
to the image we're usually given in movies, etc. The prison rape
problem is one of the big travesties of justice in America. And
the rapists are almost never punished. Predators thrive in prison.

"/> No state &quot;rushes&quot; to execute. I believe the appeals process has made
an absolute joke of capital punishment. We recently had a man executed
for a crime he committed THIRTY years ago. (The man was Carl Isaacs,
who led the slaughter of an entire family in SW Georgia in 1973, and
BTW, he and his buddies were escaped convicts from Maryland, and Isaacs
had been brutally gang raped as a teenager there in stir. Perhaps
this treatment helped make him into the sadistic, heartless killer he
became. As I said, prison officials usually encourage rape. It keeps
the violent inmates more content...at the expense of the weaker victims
of course. But most inmates eventually get their freedom; into OUR
midst.)

But yes, there may have been some very small percentage of people
wrongfully executed, but that is no reason to stop capital punishment,
just as there is no reason to stop driving because some people will
be killed wrongfully in car accidents. But as far as the kind of
country I myself would like to live in...I would like to live in one
in which the threat of gang rape, the threat of spending years being
bought and sold as a sex slave for the price of a pack of cigarettes,
and the threat of death every day from other inmates, were not part
of the criminal justice system. In other words, I would like to live
in a country in which the Constitution was respected and abided by;
especially the part about no citizen being subjected to cruel and
unusual punishment.

incompetent. There can be a great failing of physical attributes and still
have a safe driver. The biggest problem isn't those that can't hit the
brake or turn, but those that hit the gas and become so confused that they
hold down the gas until they crash. The test would need to be changed to
discover those that can no longer think in an emergency. Also, there are
generally &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; days, and if the person being tested waits for a
&quot;good&quot; day, they won't be prevented from driving.

Yes, retesting is a good thing, but those are just some of the issues I see
with it.

"/> Maybe you need to look at the death penalty statistics for Texas. And
maybe we wouldn't need such a long appeals process if we worked harder
at making sure that the accused gets a fair trial in the first place.
In some southern states a court-appointed attorney gets $1000 for
handling a capital case. That's supposed to pay him for his living
expenses, the rent on his office, *plus* whatever investigation he
does to try to prove his client innocent. Needless to say, this
doesn't allow him to put very many hours into the case, or to do much
if any investigation.

Prosecutors love to blame appeals courts for overturning convictions.
But it wouldn't have been necessary if the prosecutor had refrained
from using questionable methods and evidence. He will push as hard as
he can for a favorable ruling from the trial judge, and not worry
about whether it will be overturned until the appeal happens and
&quot;surprise&quot;, it _does_ get overturned.

Put more work into trials and a long appeals process and overturned
convictions will become rarities. My suggestions:

1. Allocate at least as much money to court-appointed attorneys (or
public defenders) as is spent by the prosecution on a case. That
includes not only the salaries of the Asst. DAs on the case, but all
the overhead (office space, secretaries, etc.) *and* a proportionate
share of the police budget (based on average effort put into this type
of crime vs. the total spending for the police dept.).

2. Hold back 10% of the salaries of DAs and asst. DAs. They get the
money when the cases they worked on are finally complete (all appeals
finished). But if the cases are overturned and sent back for new
trials, the money for the time spent on that trial goes to the defense
instead. DAs should have an incentive to make sure the trial is done
right the _first_ time.

3. Same for judges.

departments to share in seizure proceeds have the same effect, and it's
really skewing their priorities today.)

Instead, I would say if police arrest someone (or tear up his home or
car in a search, or seize his property) and fail to convict him -- or
if they use unlawful degrees of force (such as beatings), whether a
conviction follows or not! -- they should face civil liability
(restitution plus punitive damages) as if they had done the same acts
without a badge (kidnapping, home invasion, and so forth). If the
department feels the action was justified they can pay the bill on
behalf of the officer, but the victim is still entitled to be
compensated, IMO. This reform is the only thing that will put a stop
to &quot;driving while black&quot; and &quot;contempt of cop&quot; and the like.

&gt;How about just legalizing drugs? It would remove the profit motive
&gt;from the illegal drug trade, depriving street gangs of money to buy
&gt;automatic weapons. It would also mean that most users of illegal
&gt;drugs could continue to be contributing members of society(*) instead
&gt;of turning to robbery or prostitution to support their habits. And

&gt;(*) Contrary to myth, most drug users _are_ capable of holding down a

&gt;functional (if not in tip-top form) after a night's sleep.

"/> I know. A number of my friends are drug users, and some family

been an asshole. Of course, he is a liberal democrat, so maybe that
is why I don't like him. :-)

"/> Maybe small cities have to have insurance. I can't imagine why a city
the size of Los Angeles would pay an insurance company to protect it
against claims like this. I've never heard of a claim against a city
going for more than about $10mil, and that's a drop in the bucket
compared to LA's several billion $$ annual budget. At the least I'd
have a deductible of, say, $5mil per incident.

You buy insurance to protect you against catastrophic events, not
against events that occur pretty much every year even if you don't
know when.

Besides, if the payouts drop the city can negotiate for a lower
insurance rate, thereby saving money... which can be distributed as a
bonus to cops.

It's great for the prosecution. The DA doesn't even have to run an
expensive ad campaign against the judge. Of course, a DA could do
_that_ even now. But that would:
1) Use up money he could otherwise spend on his own re-election
campaign.
2) Piss off the judge, which no sensible lawyer on either side
wants to do.

&gt;I just wanted to add that I too am suspicious of this driver. I am
&gt;not convinced that it was an accident. I think it is possible that
&gt;this man was upset that the road was closed for the farmer's market,
&gt;and was determined to use the road regardless. Again, I am only
&gt;saying this is possible, but my reasons are:
&gt; 1) Initial reports from witnesses said that the man had a
&gt;&quot;determined&quot; look on his face
&gt; 2) He seems to have a lack of remorse -- only says that he made a
&gt;mistake.
&gt; 3) It's hard to believe he wasn't able to take his foot of the gas
&gt;(I wonder what finally stopped him...)

&gt;Just my two cents ...
&gt;I would like to hear more from the police about what the old man told
&gt;them.

"/> This bothers me, too. If he hadn't kept driving at full speed for
three blocks, I'd buy that he got confused. The only other explanation
that makes sense -- to me -- is that he had a TIA (transcient ischemic
attack) aka a &quot;mini-stroke.&quot; I've seen my mother-in-law have them
standing up and spacing out and falling over like a felled tree. It
doesn't last long (probably long enough to drive 3 city blocks at
about 50mph), and when she comes out of it, she has no idea it has
happened. When she comes out of it, she often short-circuits right
into elderrage or a fit of vascular dementia, acting mean and crazy.
But when she's done something bad while under the influence of an
organic condition, she's appropriately contrite.

&gt; Your source? The sources I've seen say that while prison rape is a
&gt; problem (and occasionally makes headlines), consensual homosexual sex
&gt; is much more common.

"/> Surf over to  http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/

Take time and read all the stuff there, and related links.
I believe this site to be accurate and on the mark. And there
are other sites on the subject that you can find with searches.
I've visited several, which seem to be unbiased, factual, and
written by people with a lot of experience with the prison
experience, including guards.

But as you will learn, &quot;consensual&quot; sex is often a case of
a straight guy (usually a non-violent type, or small with no
gang affiliations for protection) who decides to be a &quot;woman&quot;
for a strong, respected inmate in exchange for protection from
other predators. They find it preferable to being a gang rape
target throughout their stay in the joint.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You are mostly describing the maximum-security prisons, especially the
&gt; ones with active gangs (as we have in California).

"/> Actually, no. Even medium-security (levels 2, 3, and 4) prisons
can be just as bad for a weak inmate with no connections. The
maximum-security cons call these prisons &quot;gladiator schools&quot; because
they teach inmates the life of doing hard time. They call the level-one,
minimum-security prisons &quot;kiddie joints.&quot;

And we have gangs in our medium-security prisons here in this state.
I actually talked to a guy who served time in one not long ago. The
Aryan Brothers gang that we hear so much about in prisons was actually
formed in the '60 as a means of unity to protect white inmates from
being victimized by the black inmates, who made(and make) up a much
larger % of the prison population.

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I agree with you here. Which makes me wonder about earlier posts in
&gt; this thread. Some people were suggesting that the 86-year-old man who
&gt; lost control of his car and plowed through the Santa Monica farmer's
&gt; market should be sent to prison.

"/> I doubt he'd suffer much in prison. Life there would be hardly any
different than life outside, at his age and condition. He certainly
wouldn't be targeted as a victim in there. I don't think he should
walk on this one. Others like him must be discouraged from such
deadly irresponsibility.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Surely punishment is one thing, torture is another?

"/> I agree.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Maybe you need to look at the death penalty statistics for Texas. And
&gt; maybe we wouldn't need such a long appeals process if we worked harder
&gt; at making sure that the accused gets a fair trial in the first place.
&gt; In some southern states a court-appointed attorney gets $1000 for
&gt; handling a capital case. That's supposed to pay him for his living
&gt; expenses, the rent on his office, *plus* whatever investigation he
&gt; does to try to prove his client innocent. Needless to say, this
&gt; doesn't allow him to put very many hours into the case, or to do much
&gt; if any investigation.

"/> I still believe that the VAST majority of individuals who get strapped
down to the gurney deserve to be there. Of course, according to them
and their supporters, a lot of them are as innocent as babies.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then you need to either reduce the number of crimes so there will be
&gt; fewer people in the prisons, or spend a lot more on the prisons so you
&gt; can have enough guards to control the inmates without relying on other
&gt; inmates to do it for them.

"/> A serious look needs to be taken at our prison system. Corruption is
a big problem...(running short on time, gotta go so I'll truncate here.)
