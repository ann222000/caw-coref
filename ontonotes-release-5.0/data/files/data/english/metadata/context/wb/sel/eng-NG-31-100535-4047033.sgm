This happens wether engine is hot or cold. Engine starts revving up and
down, in idle. When driven, it seems to take a while for it to shift gears
- trans fluid was low a week ago. No fluid seen on ground. Does anybody
have have a checklist of things for me to look for, before having it taken
in to a mechanic. Not too many peolpe work on Z-cars around here and the
ones that do seem to gouge. Thanks!

I know what u mean,First check all rubber vacuum lines around the engine
for leaks, replace any that even look suspect. Â Also check web site
Zcar.com for a lot of useful info.Good luck Jim
