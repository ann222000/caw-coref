A man takes his wife to the stock show. They start heading down the alley
that had the bulls. They come up to the first bull and his sign stated:
"This bull mated 50 times last year." The wife turns to her husband and
says, "He mated 50 times in a year, you could learn from him." They proceed
to the next bull and his sign stated: "This bull mated 65 times last year."
The wife turns to her husband and says, "This one mated 65 times last year.
That is over 5 times a month. You can learn from this one, also." They
proceeded to the last bull and his sign said: "This bull mated 365 times
last year." The wife's mouth drops open and says, "WOW! He mated 365 times
last year. That is ONCE A DAY!!! You could really learn from this one." The
man turns to his wife and says, "Go up and inquire if it was 365 times with
the same cow."

Mr. Mistery.

Pity his name wasn't Kelvin Coolridge. Would have made a nice pun.
