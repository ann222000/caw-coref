Kraft is being sued because the drink Caprisun is/was allegedly labeled
"All Natural" despite that one of the main ingredients is high fructose
corn syrup.  Apparently, products containing HFCS are not legally
entitled to carry the "all natural" label according to the complaint.
That would certainly make sense.

This news item really grabbed my attention because I've had so many
problems with gluten in Kraft products that were allegedly wheat free.
Companies that run fast and loose in one area tend to abuse the
consumers' trust in other areas as well.

Labeling as "natural"
In May 2006, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) threatened
to file a lawsuit against Cadbury Schweppes for labeling 7 Up as "All
Natural", despite containing high fructose corn syrup. While the FDA has no
definition of "Natural", CSPI claims that HFCS is not a "natural" ingredient
due to the high level of processing and the use of at least one genetically
modifed (GMO) enzyme required to produce it.[19] In January 2007, Cadbury
Schweppes agreed to stop calling 7 Up "All Natural".[

I guess that means bullcrap ain't all-natural either, according to CSPI; it

It's not that corn is not a natural product, but that high fructose corn
syrup is not because of the industrial chemical process used to make it. I'm
not sure of the transformation that they do (starch to sugar, or one type of
sugar to another), but personally I would say it crosses the line from plain
old cooking into chemical processing. That's why some don't consider it
natural.

I'm not a hippie health freak by any stretch of the imagination, but
HFCS is something that I try to avoid.  Many, many items labeled "all-
natural" contain HFCS, Newman's Own products come to mind.

Natural, eh, a bit of a non-term.  Lots of things that are in their
natural state I would never put into my body.  Hey look at this rock,
it's all-natural, shall we snack on it?  Mmm foxglove (digitalis), mmm
radium, mmm mercury.  All natural, to be taken with a grain of salt
when it is used to infer healthfulness of a product.

What exactly is a "non-term"?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Arsenic is all natural.

Irrelevant.  Context is important.

I was reporting what I heard in the food news and have no esoteric
knowledge on the specific statutory or regulatory requirements material
to this litigation (as yet).  However, it seems to me that what is
important here is how the term "all natural" (and of course it is a
term) is generally understood by consumers as it applies to *food
products* --- not common poisons or bodily waste.  The "all natural"
descriptor implies that the food is safe and healthy without chemical
additives, used in this context and that is how it is generally
perceived by the vast majority of consumers.  Further, that is precisely
what Kraft means to convey when it applies that label because Kraft
wants to sell a lot of product and make a great deal of money on it.
Kraft knows that is what people want to buy.

If the product is not what Kraft implies or represents it to be and is
playing semantic games, then it is a fraud on the consumer just as it
would be a fraud to label a product that includes HFCS "sugar-free" by
asserting that "sugar-free" only implies the absence of cane sugar.

This is BS.  Almost all manufacturers (and probably the USDA)
consider HFCS "All Natural" and label it as such.  Some greedy

I find it noteworthy that you seem come down on the side of misleading
consumers.  Kraft, on the other hand, said it will revise the label and
the formulation of the product.  Perhaps you should let them know you
disagree and think they can continue to mislead consumers unfettered by
either rule or ethic.  USDA regulations, BTW, say that meat and poultry
can only be labeled "all natural" if they contain no artificial or
synthetic ingredients and if they are minimally processed.  Of course it
is the FDA that is relevant here (not USDA) and their regulations are
reportedly not as clear.

One minor nit, a GMO is a "genetically modified organism."  In other words
a living thing.  An enzyme is not a living thing, though living things both
depend upon and produce enzymes, they aren't organisms in themselves and
you could not genetically modify an enzyme.  You might
genetically modify an organism to produce a different enzyme, or maybe
just more of a particular enzyme, but the enzyme itself is just an
enzyme and neither an organism or genetic.

On the "natural" vs. "un-natural" I'll just say that people have been
using various bacteria, yeasts, and molds to convert starches and sugars
into different forms for millenia.  Is bread, beer, and wine all un-natural?.
I'm pretty sure the yeasts and mothers have been selectively bred and "modified"
over the years.  Now, if they had to use gene-splicing, I can at least see
the argument.  Not that I totally agree, but I can at least see it as a valid
point of argument.

A&gt; Imho,

I'm glad you said IMHO since HFCS  refers to a group of corn
syrups which have undergone enzymatic processing in order to
increase their fructose content and are then mixed with pure
corn syrup (100% glucose) to reach their final form (Wikipedia).
Processing, be it by machines or enzymes, is *not* genetic
engineering. Even if people did not know it, they were using
enzymes before history began.

It was H.G. Wells who said that the most unnatural thing he
could think of was a ploughed field but
the familiar always seems more "natural" than the new.

I think it's safe to say that Indians started hybridizing
corn thousands of years ago and there is no such thing as
a wild strain of corn in agriculture.

Where you draw the line between normal hybridizing and
genetic engineering, I'm not sure.

Gosh, I'm just a little curious about what your "fringe" conclusion is
based on.  Could you elaborate?  Was it that they managed to get lower
amounts of sodium nitrates in bacon and similar foods?  Was it their

they were able to get fast food enterprises to stop cooking french fries

With normal hybridization, genetic modifications are not usually

genes from animals can be implanted into the DNA of a plant for

Sounds like a reasonable distinction.  (Although I have heard
that "lateral gene transfers" occur in nature, specifically
genes that have been artificially spliced in tend to migrate
around and appear in unexpected places...)

To me, natural, in regard to food products, means it doesn't
have stuff in it that doesn't belong in it.  Frintance, ice cream
is made with eggs (sometimes not), milk and/or cream, sugar,
and natural flavors like pure vanilla extract (or vanilla bean),
strawberries, peaches, etc.  Guar gum is not a natural component
of ice cream, therefore anyone who claims their ice cream is
"all natural" had better not have things in it like guar gum
or carrageenan, etc.

The bottom line is this: Consumers who don't read ingredients, or understand
the ones they *do* read, deserve whatever they get. If they base their
decisions on the biggest most colorful words on the front of the package,
they're idiots. But, we already know this.

The "Piss Water Ale" defense doesn't hold any water either. ;)

Your "BS", "Piss Water Ale" and "greedy lawyer" defenses all appear to
be calculated at belittling the efforts of the plaintiff whose intent is
to prevent dishonest food labeling.  It's nonetheless clear that a
growing number of consumers want more honest food labeling despite
others, perhaps like you, who seem have no problem with a vicious,
'caveat emptor' kind of food market.  It may be easy for some to dismiss
people who buy such products as simple-minded or ignorant for believing
such labels or "all natural" claims--- that they deserve what they get.
But here we have a product that is aimed primarily at children and they
are not the buyers of the product.  And it is those children who may
have to suffer life-long obesity, diabetes, and other medical problems
because their parents, with all good intention, bought them something
they thought was "all natural" and healthy--- a cruel trick on those
children indeed.

Like I said, overblown nonsense.  HFCS is a "natural" product.  At least
by the FDA's definition.  They aren't misleading anyone.  See, there's
the problem.  You seem to think HFCS is *obviously* not a natural product,
but I don't see it your way.  This is a "fringe" issue in my opinion.

HFCS has been around since 1971.  It's sugar.  Yes, corn starch processed
with enzymes to become sugar, but if stuff processed by enzymes makes it
un-natural then all forms of cheese, wine, beer, bread, yogurt and who knows
what all else must be un-natural.  OK, I guess matzo would be natural.
And I'm pretty darn sure they weren't using any GMOs to get those enzymes
in 1971, so the implication that it isn't natural because they had to use
GMOs is silly.

Uh, you are the one who brought the other stuff into the discussion.

No, I'm not going to waste a lot of time researching what issues CSPI were
harping on in the past that lead me to form a poor opinion of them.  I
came to my conclusion years ago, and pretty much tuned out anything they
have had to say since.  If I see them on one side of some issue, I tend
to treat that side with more skepticism because of them.  That doesn't mean
I won't come to agree with that side, just that they make me question
it more first.

Actually, HFCS is metabolized very differently than table sugar, and

OK, so if they substituted pure cane sugar instead of the HFCS they
would have no problem labelling it "all natural" in your opinion, right?
Would that really help the obesity and bad nutition?  If you think that,
you are kidding yourself.  Too much sugar is too much sugar even if you
personally approve each individual sugar cane or beet.  The source of
the sugar is not the problem, it's the amount, no matter the source.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think it's safe to say that Indians started hybridizing
&gt;&gt;&gt;corn thousands of years ago and there is no such thing as
&gt;&gt;&gt;a wild strain of corn in agriculture.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Where you draw the line between normal hybridizing and
&gt;&gt;&gt;genetic engineering, I'm not sure.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Steve

&gt;&gt; I'd imagine that genetic engineering differs from hybridization in
&gt;&gt; that cross-species genetic exchanges do not occur in hybridization,
&gt;&gt; but they do in genetic engineering.  For example no amount of breeding
&gt;&gt; any number of corn varieties will intoduce the insecticidal abilities
&gt;&gt; of Bacillus thuringiensis into corn, but gentic engineering has.  Bt
&gt;&gt; corn is quite common now.

&gt;I think I would say that all hybridization is genetic engineering
&gt;(of a very old-fashioned, low tech sort) but not all genetic
&gt;engineering is hybridization.  It may be cross-species or intraspecies
&gt;genetic manipulation.  But just because no one took a gene from
&gt;a &quot;petrie dish&quot; and put it in a syringe and injected it into another
&gt;organism (or whatever mechanism they use to do this) doesn't mean
&gt;that one isn't &quot;engineering&quot; a modified organism.

Hybridization was still considered pretty high tech in the early part
of the 20th century, and there was plenty of controvery and resistance
then much like GM starting in the 1990s.
