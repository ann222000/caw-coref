What happens to a bullet when you strike a bullet in its rear without
putting it in a pistol?

For example, you put it on its side on the ground.  Then, take a nail
and strike the rear of the bullet.

Would the core of the bullet simply but silently fly out of its casing?

[Assuming you meant a loaded cartridge, not just the bullet itself]

Same question as to what happens if you put a cartridge in a fire.   Not
much without the constraint of the chamber.  The case would rupture and
possibly send small pieces of shrapnel (brass and unburnt powder) flying..
Since you're holding the case then it would kick back just a little and the
bullet might travel forward a very short distance (inches)....at a very low
velocity.   In an unconstrained situation, (a fire), the case would travel a
few feet and the bullet wouldn't move much.   Firemen in turnout gear face
no hazard from ammunition in a fire.

But I sense what you're getting at is a silent weapon.  No, this wouldn't
work at all.  The brass case is too weak to allow the powder to build up any
significant pressure before it ruptures or before the bullet is pushed from
the case.

There was a thread about this recently either here or in alt.rec.gun.

Er, nothing interesting, usually. That is, if you only strike the bullet
and not a whole cartridge.

# For example, you put it on its side on the ground.  Then, take a nail
# and strike the rear of the bullet.

This is likely to do nothing of note with a bare bullet. It will also do
nothing of note if there isn't a functional primer that you hit, with a
whole cartridge.

Hitting the primer, though, will be somewhat more exciting.

IIRC, back when I'd gotten drafted, we had some joker in the military
sink a whole blank cartridge in a piece of firewood. Then, someone else
decided to make the piece of firewood a bit smaller, and hit it with an
axe, losing an eye when the blank cartridge went off and sent a piece of
brass flying.

Do you mean a bullet or a loaded cartridge?

Hitting an unchambered loaded cartridge's primer with something like a
nail is a truly stupid idea.  The cartirdge will fire, but the bullet
won't go far. Bits of brass from the split case and the primer will
fly in several directions, possibly injuring anyone dumb enough to try
the stunt.

If the primer doesn't detonate, the cartridge and case  will just go
flying together like any other object hit by a hammer.

If you smack a jacketed -bullet- on the rear end with a hammer, you
will not dislodge the core.  Think about it.  The core is designed to
stay in place under the much greater stress of being fired in a gun.

I know I shouldn't ask this but do you mean a bullet or a loaded and
primed cartridge. If the latter I think you missed one important
detail in your scenario, how will you hold it still. If you don't
intend on holding it still I guess you'll just be chasing it around
the ground after every hit or if your foolhardy enough you could put
your foot on it, I'd like to see that one on a YouTube video. In
short, not advised, As the box reads &quot;only intended for use in

That would be dumb to try by hand without mechanical shielding and
hearing and eye protection.   If the nail strikes with sufficient force
the primer will fire igniting the powder.  The resulting explosion
certainly  wouldn't be silent but it wouldn't be quite as loud as firing
the cartridge in a pistol.  The bullet will be propelled forward and the
case will be propelled rearward (toward the nail),  both with velocities
a small fraction of the normal bullet speeds but likely enough velocity
to cut skin  and certainly enough to do eye damage.  Depending on the
ratio of masses of the bullet and case the case likely will carry more
kinetic energy than the bullet as it's usually lighter and also will
have some &quot;rocket&quot; effect.  The brass case may or may not split open.
How loud or dangerous it would be depends on  the particular &quot;pistol
bullet&quot;.    A 500 S&amp;W cartridge  would  release in the order of 20 times
as much energy as a 25 ACP.  Either could cause serious injury.

There would be a bang (assuming the primer went off), and the bullet and
casing would fly apart.  Since the mass of the bullet greatly exceeds
the mass of the casing, most of the velocity would go to the casing and
less to the bullet.  In addition, in the absence of a barrel, the force
applied by the expanding gas would act over a very brief time (just the
length of time required for the slug to clear the casing), so there
would be minimal acceleration of either lead or brass.

The TV show &quot;Mythbusters&quot; did an experiment some time ago regarding the
story of the guy who replaced a car fuse with a live round.  As I
recall, the conclusion was that a short _could_ fire the round, but that
there was insufficient velocity induced to the bullet to cause any
damage beyond a bruise or scratch.  (My recollection could be faulty -
refer to the show.)

Having said that, I would rank this activity in the same category as
running with scissors or jumping from a cliff into the lake.  Odds are
you'd get away with it 99 times out of 100.  The potential bad
consequences of the 100th try are, however, a bit out of proportion to
the grievousness of the sin.

# What happens to a bullet when you strike a bullet in its rear without
# putting it in a pistol?

just the bullet, mostly it will roll around the table

the &quot;bullet&quot; is the part that flies thru the air, completely inert.

the &quot;cartridge&quot; includes the case, primer, powder and bullet

I think what happens if you can strike the primer of a loaded cartridge is
that it will ignite the powder which will burn and build up pressure until
the case ruptures. the bullet may or may not fly off in one direction,
pieces of brass case almost certainly will, it will go bang real loud.
Probably couldn't kill youself but you could blind yourself or someone else.
many many years ago a magazine article showed what would happen, they used
heat to ignite the primer from a safe distance the cartridge was under a
box, brass pieces got embedded in the box.

DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME KIDS!

Poole

# For example, you put it on its side on the ground.  Then, take a nail
# and strike the rear of the bullet.

if it was loose, you couldn't hit it hard enough to go off, you'd send it
skidding across the floor. if you held the loaded cartridge in a vise that
would work as above, don't do it!

It wouldn't be silent.  See the earlier discussion of throwing
cartridges in a fire.  The powder will be ignited and will expand,
causing the cartridge case to fail, breaking it, and ejecting the bullet
at fairly low velocity.

The answer to your question is--the same as would happen if you struck
a stone.  A bullet is a projectile located at the front of a loaded
cartridge. If you intended to ask what if---wrt a loaded cartridge,
that's another matter.  If the primer in the cartridge were struck it
might or might not explode, igniting the powder in the cartridge case.
If the primer exploded the bullet would fly maybe a few feet because
of its weight being less than the case. The case would go further.  If
all this is done inside a carboard box, likely nothing would fly out
of the box.

DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!

I think you are getting bullets and cartridges mixed up or don't know the
difference.  The cartridge is the case, powder, primer and bullet. If you
hit the primer on the end of the cartridge w/o it being in a pistol, it will
go off, but the bullet will not go far, and you will get a split case and
hot powder flying around and maybe pieces of the case. It will not be
silent.  I do not recommend you try this.

The casing would split, sending the bullet a very short distance (likely
under 6&quot;) forward, spitting powder and casing fragments in every direction,
and kick the casing backwards a foot or three.

You probably need to check your vocabulary to see if you asked what you
thought you were asking.  Do you really mean to strike the rear of a
&quot;bullet&quot; or do you mean you are wondering about striking the primer of a
&quot;cartridge&quot; while it is laying loose outside of a gun?   The results will be
dramatically different depending on your answer to this question?    If you
strike a &quot;bullet&quot; in the rear with a sharp instrument, all you will do is
put a small dent in the bullet.   If you do this same action to a
&quot;cartridge&quot;, you will get ignition of the primer and powder, followed most
probably by the rupturing of the brass case, somewhat like a firecracker,
but with little bits of brass shrapnel.  Because the &quot;bullet&quot; in the
&quot;cartridge&quot; has more mass than the brass case, if it moves at all, it will
be minor, maybe a few inches or feet.  A very similar discussion just
occured in the past week or two in this newsgroup, concerning throwing
cartridges in a fire.    Basically, unchambered cartridges burst, chambered
cartridges project a bullet down a barrel at high speed.

Assuming we're speaking of fixed ammunition, it would be impossible to
strike a bullet in its rear, at least while it was still in its case. If
you first pulled the bullet and then struck the base of the bullet
nothing would happen, it's just metal. Same for hitting a bullet on its
side. You can smash a bullet any way you wish. All you'll you achieve is
a misshaped piece of metal.

You could get hurt real bad. The powder will rupture the case,
but, what I would really be afraid of is the primer. Those little
buggers make one big bang and if you were to hit one on concrete with a
hammer it would blow a small chunk out of the concrete and pepper you
with the debris. Don't fool around with loaded ammunition! You WILL get
hurt. I have seen live rounds discharged as you mentioned and they do
rupture and spew debris at rather violent rates of speed. Although their
range is not far, they are rather potent within an arm's range. Just
don't do it.  ------------------------------------------

Well if not anything the OP sure had a good lesson in cartridge
construction and the terminologies that go along with it but in all
fairness the word bullet has been misused for so many years, kind of
like clip vs magazine, most if not everyone knows what the person
truly means unless your placing an order by phone. I've been guilty of
it myself, on the way to the range (gotta stop at Wally-World and pick
up a few boxes of bullets), I gotta pick up a few boxes of cartridges
may well be correct but just doesn't sound the same. Could just be a
lazy way of speech we've grown accustom to. What would get my
attention would be calling a paper cartridge a paper bullet and still
not sure where shells vs casings came into play...

You're talking about a cartridge,  and it's bullet. The bullet is what comes
out of the cartridge when it goes off. This has been debated here
ad-nauseum. The consensus is that without containment, (a barrel) the bullet
achieves very little velocity, if any.

There was a story published some years ago about a man and wife at a
shooting event.  The fellow got a cartridge stuck in his chamber and
had his wife hold the gun while he attempted to ram it out with a
cleaning rod from the muzzle end of the gun.  The cartridge broke
loose and when it cam out it struck something , probably the ejector,
and went off.  The brass case blew into pieces and killed his wife on
the spot.  I might add the cartridge was clear of the chamber.  So yes
you can get killed by setting off a loaded round outside of the gun or
chamber of the gun.

I think the most dangerous projectile would probably be the primer
itself...I've heard of cases where, even with an open casing with
no bullet (and no powder), the primer came out of
its pocket with quite a bit of
speed...not lethal, but certainly a hazard, especially to eyes.
(The casing was held in a vise, so it couldn't move...it may be
that when the casing is free to move, the primer might be less
likely to separate from the casing, but I wouldn't count on it).

garage of his uncles and take 22 mag ammo out of the little orange
container, stick them into the ground with the rim sticking straight
up but level with the dirt (basically buried) and then I (I mean my
friend) would shoot the 22 mag cartridge with a bb gun hitting the
primer with the barrel less than an inch away.  The projectile would
be about 2 to 3 inches into the soft ground, and the brass would fly
at a very fast pace straight into the air.  I only did this a dozen
times until the brass eventually hit me in the elbow causing a bruise
and a slight burn.  Can't remember what I had told my mom.  AHAHAH!  I
look back at those times, and boy was I lucky and stupid.

Of course this was 25+ years ago and people never locked up their
ammo.  Wait a minute, most people still don't.

take care,

When I was a little kid, young and stupid, we took a .38 special cartridge,
put it in a vise and pulled the bullet with some pliers.  Then we dumped out
the powder and burned it.  Not satisfied, I took a hammer and nail and hit
the primer while the case was still held in the vise.  Surprise, a big bang
like a loud firecracker, the hammer when flying back over my shoulder and
the nail made a hole in the garage roof flying out to parts unknown.
Needless to say, I was still stupid, but learned right there not to play
with guns and ammo. - CW

# What happens to a bullet when you strike a bullet in its rear without

#
# For example, you put it on its side on the ground.  Then, take a nail

# Would the core of the bullet simply but silently fly out of its casing?

First of all... don't do it. You could hurt yourself... badly.

With that out of the way... striking the rear (primer I assume) of
a cartridge would probably ignite the primer and fire the round.

The pressure of the burning gunpowder would just burst the brass
shell casing and make it fly away. The brass casing might also split
into several &quot;petals&quot; of metal in the process.

The bullet itself, having much more mass, probably wouldn't go very
far... it would just probably pop out, fly a few feet and plop on the
floor.

Since the shell casing itself would burst open very quickly (i.e. long
before the proper chamber pressure was reached), most of the gunpowder
would probably not even ignite, but just fall out as grains.

The primer, because it is explosive rather than just the fuel/oxidizer
mixture that gunpowder is, might develop enough pressure to violently
pop itself out of the shell casing and become a relatively dangerous
high velocity projectile.

In proper use (i.e. in a &quot;gun&quot;), the cartridge propellant is ignited by
the primer, the powder begins to burn, the pressure rapidly rises (which
causes the powder burn RATE to increase) and the pressure pushes the
bullet down the barrel and out. Of course, the rifling of the barrel
imparts a spin to the bullet for stability.

In proper use, most of the powder is burned and transformed into high
pressure gas which fires the bullet down the barrel.

Outside of the confines of the gun chamber, the cartridge blows apart
and vents the pressure long before all the powder can burn.

The result is just a rather wimpy &quot;pop&quot; sound along with a few pieces
of metal flying a few feet in different directions.

In a way, this is similar to the design of the fission (atomic) bomb.

Great pains were taken to use heavy spheres of U238 (non fissionable)
metal as a &quot;chamber&quot; (tamper) to hold the fissile core together long
enough for a &quot;good&quot; reaction to take place.

Without the &quot;tamper&quot;, the uranium or plutonium core would turn to plasma
and blow apart without releasing very much energy (i.e. a &quot;dud&quot;).

Lastly, as I said in the beginning... DON'T mess with firearm cartridges.

Only use them as they were intended. Playing with them can get you hurt,
burned or even killed. Don't do it. Please.

Roger

When I was in the eighth grade (in a very bad school, think blackboard
Jungle), the kid in front of me decided to empty a 12ga shotgun shell in
his desk, the old-fashioned kind with the hinged lid.  He was working
inside the desk with the lid lying on his forearms while he emptied the
shell.  Once he had the crimp open, the shot out, the wadding and the
powder out, he decided to remove the primer.  It didn't come easily (it
wouldn't, would it? &lt;g&gt;) he tried to knock it out with his ruler (metal
edge).

Obviously, it went off.  Big Bang, desk lid flew up and slammed back
down on his arms.  Kid not really hurt, but he learned something that day.

The teacher had been standing in the door.  He turned back to the class
and said sternly, &quot;That better not happen again!&quot;   Ha!

I call shennanigans.  Hatcher's Notebook indicated that brass from a
similar event wouldn't even penetrate a cardboard box.  And, the person
you're asking for a cite is notorious for ignoring requests for same
(how about that alleged Glock external safety you claimed they were

When we were young, we put a shotgun shell in a fence and shot at it
with a BB gun until the primer was hit. The primer came out at a high
velocity, struck another little boy on the shoulder, making a wound that
took weeks to heal.

When we were young, we shoved a 22 magnum rimfire cartridge into hard
dirt with the rear of the cartridge just protruding from the ground. We
threw rocks at it until it exploded and some dirt landed in my mouth.

Was wondering about that.  I wanted a cite because it seemed unlikely that a
piece of brass would have enough inertia to penetrate deep enough to kill.
I like to check before adding anything to our curriculum.  It helps keep our
credibility up.  &quot;I heard...&quot; and &quot;I seem to recall ...&quot; aren't good enough.

Right.  Enough alarmist misinformation out there from the overt anti's,
no reason to add more ourselves.

If it's a lead bullet the point of the nail would most likly stick in
the base of the bullet.  If the the base is solid jacket you would dull
the point of the nail.

Well, yeah, there wouldn't be a big bang, but it would produce enough
radiation to kill anyone in the near vicinty.  That's what happened to
at least one Los Alamos guy who got sub-critical lumps of fissile
material too close to one another for too long.  And a cloud of
vaporized plutonium would leave one nasty clean-up project for the
custodians.
