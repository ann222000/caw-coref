Analysis: Cheney favors attack on IranBy CLAUDE SALHANI
UPI International Editor
WASHINGTON, July 30 (UPI) -- Diplomatic arm-wrestling between Iran and
the West over the future of the Islamic republic's nuclear program has
not prevented talk of the military option as a solution to the crisis,
despite the tsunami-like reaction such a military adventure would
generate in the Arab and Islamic world.

Of late, there has been much speculation regarding the probability of
U.S. and/or Israeli military strikes intended to destroy the Islamic
republic's nuclear power sites before they become fully operational.
The Iranians say the plants are being built for peaceful purposes, but
Western sources believe Iran's intention is to develop military-grade
nuclear material.

In fact, President George W. Bush has reiterated on numerous occasions
that &quot;everything is still on the table&quot; when it comes to discussing
Iran's nuclear development and how to sanction Iran over its
continuing refusal to abide by directives from the international
community.

But a well-informed source tells United Press International that
according to senior U.S. intelligence officials, President Bush has
definitely decided not to strike any of Iran's alleged nuclear weapons
production facilities this year.

The sources say the officials stressed the words &quot;this year,&quot; meaning
in 2007. That, however, does not rule out the possibility of military
intervention in 2008, right until January 2009, when Bush's term in
the White House comes to an end.

This information seems to back up a report published in the July 16
issue of the London Guardian that claims President Bush gave in to
Vice President Dick Cheney, accepting to carry out military action
against Iran before he leaves office.

According to the Guardian, a series of meetings held during June and
July involving top White House, Pentagon and State Department
officials was used by the vice president to stress the point that the
diplomatic approach to solving the crisis had failed. The London
newspaper went on to say that the vice president was able to convince
the president by saying that no future U.S. administration would have
the courage to act militarily against Tehran.

At the same time, sources familiar with the intelligence community
report that there have been &quot;a lot of stories about bunker buster
bombs being moved to the region.&quot; The source says, however, that there
is no basis for these reports, which, according to them, are being
floated by Israeli intelligence.

&quot;This is 'PSYOP' rubbish,&quot; a well-informed source told UPI. PSYOP
stands for psychological operations; or in other words, playing mind
games with the enemy.

The aim of PSYOP is to demoralize the enemy by inseminating doubt
among his troops as well as the local population. Psychological
operations play a vital role in military and political planning of
most countries.

One prime example of PSYOPs was used during Operation Desert Storm in
1990-91, when the United States led an international coalition to oust
Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, which he had occupied in August 1990. By
placing a Marine expeditionary force aboard Navy vessels anchored off
the coast, U.S. military planners had Saddam believe that the U.S.
Marines would launch a seaborne assault on Kuwait, therefore tying
down large numbers of Iraqi forces and building massive defenses along
Kuwait's beachfront for an attack that never materialized. Instead,
the major thrust came across the desert from Saudi Arabia, a move the
Iraqi leader did not expect.

Part of the task performed by PSYOPs includes developing and employing
propaganda in a convincing manner.

Instead of a direct attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, Vice
President Cheney has proposed a measure that would launch a very
limited military strike at one or more known Iranian training centers
whose forces are being deployed to Iraq.

Cheney's proposal has gotten no approval, so far, say the sources.

Indeed, the Bush administration accuses Iran of supporting terrorism,
primarily groups in Lebanon and in the Palestinian territories, groups
Washington considers to engage in terrorist activities. A particular
point of contention between Iran and the Bush administration are
accusations from Washington over the nefarious role Iran continues to
play in neighboring Iraq, while Iran accuses the United States of
trying to implement regime change in Iran.

One of the primary culprits accused by the Bush administration of
fomenting trouble in Iraq is Moqtada Sadr, the pro-Iranian firebrand
young Shiite cleric, and his Mahdi Army. It is believed that Iran
supplies Sadr and his fighters with logistic and financial support, as
well as weapons and improvised explosive devices.

U.S. intelligence sources, however, say that the White House estimates
of the assistance provided to the Iraqi Shiite community by Iran, as
well as the amounts, &quot;are exaggerated.&quot;

Launching a war against Iran in 2008 -- their last year in office --
the Bush administration would in fact be leaving a second war they
started in the Middle East for the next administration to resolve.

Ex-CIA officer Slams US Allegations against Iran as Sham

CASMII Press Release
28 July 2007
In an alarming exposure of the acceleration and urgency of the
American war party's push towards catastrophic war with Iran, Philip
Giraldi, former CIA counter terrorism officer, in an interview [1] on
24th July with Anti War Radio debunked the NeoCons' repeated myth of
Iran's support for AlQaeda as a pretext for war. Whilst acknowledging
Iran's helpfulness in trying to establish security in both Afghanistan
and Iraq, Giraldi spoke of the United States' hypocritical and illegal
support for terrorist separatists groups inside Iran, and various
plans and scenarios which have been drawn up to destroy Iran's
military and economic infrastructure by massive bombardment, with the
use of nuclear bombs a real and stated possibility.
Giraldi refuted the assumption that sharing hostilities towards the
US, placed Iran and AlQaeda in the same camp and sharing similar
agenda, arguing that Iran followed a very different agenda in its
dealings with the US. He emphasised both the fact of Iranians'
helpfulness in Iraq, in terms of pushing for greater stability, and
also their help and cooperation in Afghanistan, as well as the reality
of the deep hostilities between Shiia Iran and Sunni extremism of
AlQaeda. Giraldi recalled the major attack against the Iranian
consulate general in Afghanistan by the Taliban, a close ally of
AlQaeda, in which 11 Iranian diplomats were killed, and the regular
AlQaeda violent attacks against Shiia population in Iraq, and
concluded that a Shiia Iranian-AlQaeda alliance was not a plausible
possibility.
He described the recent New York Sun's allegation [2] that AlQaeda
prisoners in Iran led terrorist operations inside Iraq under the
advice of the Iranian government, as one of many propaganda pieces
making a case for war. He said how in 2003, the Iranian government,
through the Swiss embassy, had offered to hand over the six AlQaeda
prisoners kept in Iran, which includes Osama Bin Laden's son, in
exchange for the US ceasing its support for the MEK, and how this
offer was rejected by the US. He said of the MEK that it was sheltered
and armed by Saddam against Iran, and now supported and armed by
Pentagon against Iran.
Highlighting what he called American &quot;ultimate hypocrisy&quot;, Giraldi
explained how the US government is supporting terrorist groups and
ethnic division in Iran and charging the Iranians in Iraq for what the
US was doing in Iran itself and with a lot more evidence. Giraldi
talked of US's support for Jundullah which he described as a Sunni
Baluchi separatist group in eastern Iran that has launched deadly
terrorist attacks inside Iran. He also spoke of US support for
separatists amongst the Arab minority which is closer to the border
with Iraq.
Giraldi repeated the alarm call he first made in his revelations in
the American Conservative Magazine in 2005 that Dick Cheney, who has
no authority under the constitution, had ordered the air force to draw
up plans for air strike against Iran that even included the use of
nuclear weapons. He said he thought there was a lot of evidence since
then to suggest that nuclear weapons are still very much on the table
and named Republican Senators such as McCain, Gilliani and Romney who
had not &quot;flinched at all&quot; in the debate about the prospect of using
nuclear weapons against Iran.
He spoke of various war scenarios cooked up by the war party. One
scenario was of the automatic use of the nuclear weapons in order to
reach and destroy the Iranian nuclear sites buried under ground.
Another scenario was to use the nuclear threat if the &quot;Iranians
continue to fight back after we staged our attack&quot;, the idea being
&quot;that's what the nukes are for, our nukes that everybody knows that we
in fact do have, is to tell them, listen, you are going to sit there
and take it while we bomb you for a week or two and you are not going
to fight back and if you do fight back then we will use nuclear
weapons on you&quot;, and he cited the example scenario of Iranians
resisting by staging attack in the Strait of Hormouz or destabilising
Afghanistan.
Setting out the horrifying context of the possibility of the US using
nuclear strikes against Iran, under the pretext of destroying Iranian
nuclear bombs which do not exist and Iran's cooperation with AlQaeda,
another propaganda fabrication, Giraldi drew attention to the recent
warning to Iran and the threat of war issued by AlQaeda for Iran's
support for the Shiia government in Iraq, as well as AlQaeda's
constant horrific attacks

You posted, &quot;...tsunami-like reaction such a military adventure would
generate in the Arab and Islamic world.&quot;

I suggest that you would be surprised to see just how quickly the
countries of the free world would stomp a mud hole in the Arab and
Islamic world's  ass. Further more, I have little doubt that China
would be a bit perturbed at you Islamic dumb asses starting something
that would screw up their long range plan for economic development.
And since they are practically within walking distance of you I
suspect that they would let you know real soon that you've dropped
your dick in the dirt and they intend to step on it, HARD!

Bottom line; You don't want to piss the bad boys off when you're
nothing more than uneducated goat herders whose best weapon is a
suicider with a bomb tied to his ass. We know you slipper wearing
freaks really don't want to drink that much kool Aid.
