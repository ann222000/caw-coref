Operation Lightning

<P>Mohammed at Iraq The Model has posted that Operation Lightning has
started: Yesterday operation lightning began and we noticed an excessive
presence of the Iraqi army and police forces on the streets and main
squares in Baghdad with an obvious readiness for confronting the
terrorists. It's become clear that the phenomenon of seeing terrorists
taking control of streets and government buildings in Baghdad had
diminished long time ago but it's not completely over yet. And I guess
that operation lightning will mobilize the terrorists out of their hides
because awaiting clashing with the security forces is worse (from the
terrorists point of view) is much worse than the fight itself and they
realize that having their hides assaulted one at a time will render them
weaker as they would have to fight in much smaller groups. Baghdad had
witnessed high activity for the terrorists in the western part of the
city which is geographically close to Anbar province; around a hundred
armed men tried to control a police station where many of the most
dangerous criminals were kept in custody and it seems that one of the
prisoners is of significant value to the terrorists and my assumption is
that the police force in charge wasnâ€™t aware of the importance of that
prisoner. The attackers detonated a number of car bombs in the nearby
intersections apparently in an attempt to prevent Iraqi or American
reinforcements from reaching the operation scene while they attacked the
police station with mortars and RPGs. The battle lasted for more than 2
hours and helicopters and jet fighters attended the scene and eye
witnesses said that some f-16's patrolled the area at very low altitudes
but didn't fire at anything. The policemen fought bravely and defended
their station and the attack was successfully repelled after a number of
the attackers got killed while the rest fled the area but additional
army and police forces blocked the adjacent streets and started chasing
the terrorists. According to news sources in Baghdad, hundreds (nearly
500) suspects were captured in the 1st 24 hours of operation lightning
and many weapons were confiscated; some were hidden in caches while
others were found during inspecting vehicles in checkpoints. If we
follow the curve of the terrorists power we'll find that the curve is
going down in general and I believe that they cannot win the battle on
the strategic or the tactical level. The illusion of the "resistance"
had anaesthetized many people that they even forgot all logical and
scientific calculations and I don't know how those people are going to
deal with the facts when the terrorists are completely defeated. We've
been challenged in our home and we cannot afford to runaway from the
challenges and keep weeping about the past. It's our battle and it's a
battle for existence and that's why we must fight it to the end. The
Daily Telegraph has a little more: Meanwhile, Iraqi forces have launched
their biggest security crackdown since the fall of Saddam Hussein with
the start of Operation Lightning, a sweep by 40,000 Iraqi troops who
will seal off Baghdad and hunt for insurgents. Backed by the 10,000 US
troops in the capital, Iraqi soldiers would block major routes into
Baghdad and search the city district by district, looking for foreign
Arab fighters and Iraqi guerrillas, Iraqi officials said. Bit more here
with news they nabbed a high ranking Saddam official: BAGHDAD, Iraq -
Police fought pitched battles with insurgents Sunday as thousands of
security forces backed by American troops began "Operation Lightning,"
sweeping through Baghdad's streets to flush out militants responsible
for killing more than 720 people since Iraq's new government was
announced in April. Insurgents killed at least 30 people, including a
British soldier, and a senior U.S. military intelligence official
acknowledged there are few indications they "are packing their bags."
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's al-Qaida in Iraq claimed responsibility for
nearly all the attacks. In the biggest coup of Operation Lightning,
Iraqi and U.S. soldiers arrested a former general in Saddam Hussein's
intelligence service who was also a member of his Fedayeen secret
police. The arrest came during a raid in western Baghdad, the scene of
some of Sunday's heaviest fighting. "He now leads the military wings of
several terror cells operating in the west Baghdad neighborhood of
Ghazaliyah," the military said. It did not release his name or provide
further details. There is also news that that they arrested a Sunni
leader accidently but quicky released him and apologized plus the
terrorists triggered a few car bombs in the last few hours. Neither is
surprising, sometimes when your dealing with mass arrests a few mistakes
are made identifying people but it was quickly resolved. As far as the
car bombs, the last gasps of a failed terrorist insurgency</P>
