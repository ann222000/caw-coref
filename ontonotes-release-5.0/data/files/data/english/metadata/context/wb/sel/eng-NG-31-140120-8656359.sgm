AAA: Fresno lost to Salt Lake 5-4

Fresno: CF Clay Timpner: 1 for 3, BB
Fresno: DH Lance Niekro: 2 for 4
Fresno: C Eliezer Alfonzo: 3 for 4, SO
Salt Lake: SS Brandon Wood: 1 for 3, HR, 2 SO

Fresno: RHP Matt Kinney: 6.0 IP, 5 H, 5 R, 4 ER, 2 BB, 6 K, 2 HR
Fresno: RHP Dan Giese: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 0 HR
Fresno: RHP Billy Sadler: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 0 K, 0 HR
Salt Lake: RHP Bartolo Colon: 5.0 IP, 6 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 1 BB, 4 K, 0 HR

The two Grizzlies with multiple hits were a couple hitters who began
the year on the Giants' 25-man roster.  Alfonzo and Niekro raised
their respective AVGs to .302 and .299.  Timpner also reached base
twice.  Wood, the Angels' top prospect, homered for the third time in
the four-game series.

Kinney's ERA edged back above 4.00 in what is presumably his final
start of the season.  He has 141 K in 156.2 IP, both categories in
which he leads the team (although Blackley should go back ahead in
IP).  Giese and Sadler both faced the minimum number of hitters,
although Sadler did issue yet another walk to a PCL hitter.  Colon
made his third start this year with Salt Lake and his second start on
his current rehab stint.  He threw 44 of 69 pitches for strikes.

AA: Connecticut defeated New Hampshire 8-1

Connecticut: CF Eugenio Velez: 3 for 3, 3B, 2B, BB
Connecticut: RF John Bowker: 1 for 2, HR, 2 SF
Connecticut: 1B Tyler Von Schell: 0 for 4, 3 SO
Connecticut: 3B Simon Klink: 2 for 4, HR, 2B, 3 E

Connecticut: RHP Garrett Broshuis: 7.0 IP, 5 H, 1 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 6 K,
0 HR

Velez reached base in all four plate appearances.  After six triples
in June, when it seemed like he might be on pace to set a league
record in that category for the second consecutive season, he has hit
three triples the rest of the season.  Bowker's 5 HRs in August have
all come in the last week.  Klink had a fine night offensively,
including his 11th HR; but the defense was a mess with three errors,
raising his season total to 18.  Von Schell's SO/AB ratio for the
season is over 29.0% following tonight's hat trick.

Broshuis has seen more than his share of bad luck losses this year, so
it is nice to see him finish out the 2007 season with a win.  He
improved his ERA to 3.88 and his W-L record to 3-17.

A+: San Jose lost to Lancaster 13-1

San Jose: 2B Travis Denker: 1 for 3, 2B, BB, E
San Jose: DH Eddy Martinez-Esteve: 1 for 3, 2B, BB, GiDP
San Jose: C Adam Witter: 1 for 3, BB, HBP, SO, PB

San Jose: LHP Jesse English: 2.1 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 2 BB, 2 K, 0 HR
San Jose: RHP Ryan Paul: 2.0 IP, 1 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 2 BB, 2 K, 0 HR

No one for the Giants had a multiple-hit line.  Denker and EME led the
way, as they had the team's only XBHs and both reached base twice.
Denker has 29 doubles and 14 errors this year.  Witter reached base
three times, but he allowed his 16th passed ball.

English had his least effective appearance in some time, perhaps since
June.  Paul had the best line of the four Giants pitchers.

A-: Augusta defeated Greenville 3-2

Augusta: 3B Ryan Rohlinger: 2 for 4, 2B
Augusta: C Barry Gunther: 2 for 3, 2B, BB

Augusta: LHP Benjamin Snyder: 6.0 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 7 K, 0
HR--1 HB
Augusta: RHP Osiris Matos: 1.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 0 HR

After having 16 doubles the first two months of the season, Rohlinger
has just 14 doubles the last three months, as he finally reached the
benchmark of 30 doubles.  Gunther has appeared with more affiliates
than anyone else in the organization this year, appearing with every
team but Connecticut in at least two games.  His overall season line
is a disappointing .218/.323/.275 in 142 AB.

Snyder finishes the season with one of his best starts of the season.
He improved his ERA to 2.09 and his W-L record 16-5.  He has 145 K in
151.0 IP.  I believe that is more strikeouts than any other Giants
minor league pitcher this year.  Matos picked up his 4th save.

ssA: Salem-Keizer defeated Vancouver 5-0

Salem-Keizer: CF Shane Jordan: 2 for 4, 2B, BB, CS
Salem-Keizer: 1B Matthew Downs: 3 for 5
Salem-Keizer: DH Garrett Baker: 3 for 3, HR, 2 BB

Salem-Keizer: RHP T.J. Brewer: 5.0 IP, 4 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 3 K, 0
HR--1 HB
Salem-Keizer: LHP Joe Paterson: 1.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 0
HR

Baker had a huge night, reaching base in all five plate appearances
and connecting for his 7th HR.  Downs, the NWL co-MVP, also had three
hits, raising his team-leading AVG to .337.  Jordan also reached base
three times.

Brewer improved his W-L record to 9-1.  He entered the night with a
1.48 GO/AO ratio and further improved that with a 12/0 GO/FO line.
After allowing 1 ER in each of his first two appearances as a Volcano,
Paterson has allowed an run in just one of his last six appearance.

R: Giants lost to Mariners 8-5 in the AZL championship game
(scoring four runs in 9th inning to make the final score the closest
it had been since the end of the 1st inning)

Scottsdale: SS Charlie Culberson: 1 for 5, 2 SO, E
Scottsdale: DH Nick Noonan: 0 for 4, 3 SO
Scottsdale: 3B Angel Villalona: 0 for 4, 2 SO
Scottsdale: 1B Andy D'alessio: 0 for 2, 2 BB
Scottsdale: 2B Ramon Corona: 1 for 3, BB, SO
Scottsdale: C Johnny Monell: 1 for 3, HBP, PB

Scottsdale: RHP Wilber Bucardo: 3.1 IP, 7 H, 5 R, 5 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 0
HR--1 HB, 1 WP
Scottsdale: RHP Richard Wilshire: 02. IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 0
HR
Peoria: RHP Jacob Wild: 8.0 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 14 K, 0 HR

No one had multiple hits or an extra base hit for the Giants, but
D'alessio, Corona and Monell each reached base twice.  They all are
late round picks drafted out of four-year colleges.  The three
youngsters at the top of the lineup collectively had perhaps their
worst game of the year.  Villalona, Noonan and Culberson reached base
just once and had 8 SO in 13 PA.  D'alessio and Monell were the only
Giants without a strikeout as the team struck out fourteen times.

Bucardo, the team's young ace, had his least effective start of the
year.  In his eleven starts, he had allowed just 13 ER.  Wilshire was
the only one of four Giants pitchers not to allow a run.  The
Mariners' 22-year-old Wild, their 26th round pick out of the
University of Pacific, had perhaps the best start of his career.  He
had dominant stats this year, but he had also started in just four of
his seventeen appearances.

His worst, I'd say.  Notably, he got the start -- his first this year.
