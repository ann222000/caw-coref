Hmmm.  So does the author of this piece have reason to assume that Chaplin
was never married to Paulette Goddard?  Or that Mildred Harris was 16, not
17, when Chaplin married her?  And who among us knew that by 1920 Chaplin
had starred in multiple feature films, and that the one we do know about had
been directed by Chaplin rather than Mack Sennett?

Please understand that I'm leery about accepting what the article has to say
about re-entry permits and the admissability of blood-test results.

I'm assuming there was an inadvertant omission of the word 'not' in
your last sentence. The issues of the re-entry permit and blood tests
in California law are pretty well documented (although some would love
to ignore evidence of the meeting between McGranery and Hoover).

I my opinion the general scholarly standards of American Heritage have not
been the same since it (of necessity) stopped being a subscription-only
publication &amp; went to newsstands.  It's a pretty common occurance, though
Smithsonian is still pretty good.

&gt; Chaplin never WAS legally married to Paulette.  Kevin Brownlow
&gt; looked into this question quite deeply in his huge picture book
&gt; about Chaplin three or four years ago (I think it was called
&gt; CHARLIE CHAPLIN, MASTER COMEDIAN).

&gt; And Mildred was 16 when Chaplin got involved with her, though
&gt; not necessarily when he married her.

The article on the whole looks carefully researched compared to most
stuff one finds in newspapers and on the internet. I'm just not sure
what the point of publishing it was, since it doesn't have anytning
new to say.

As someone who was once a teenaged girl, I see very little (if any)
difference between the ages of 16, 17, and 18, all of which are
considered the age of consent or above in most countries and in the
vast majority of states in the US.

I think it was the age difference between Grey and Chaplin that people
found disturbing, not the technicalities of consent.  My grandmother got
married at the age of 16, around the same time, but her husband was 19.
If he'd been 35 there would certainly have been talk.

If a 35 year-old man came on to you sexually, in a very agrressive way,
when you were 15, would you have found that an acceptably normal
situation?  Would the society you grew up in have found it acceptable?

I was just informed by a reliable source that the birthday I've got
for Ben Turpin is off by five years--he started changing the year of
his birth when he married a woman 16 years his junior, and he
apparently thought it would raise fewer eyebrows to make the
difference 11 years. But the 1880 census reveals the truth.

So, it'll be incorrect in the 2008 calendar (zut alors!), but I'll
have it right by 2009.

....and I just now got word that the calendars are finished. If you
HAVE to have yours soon, order them this weekend; I'll be in Kansas
from 9/27 though 10/1, and can't mail them. However, if you come to
Salina, Iola, or Webster Groves you can buy your calendar straight
from the source and save on postage. But these will not sell out (or
if they do I'll reprint them) until January, so you've got plenty of
time.

You assume (based on what, I don't know) that it was the 35 year old
who came on to the 15 year old. From what I know, based on the reports
of some who were there, it wasn't anywhere near as black and white as
you've presented it here. What was the role, and responsibility of the
15 year old's family?

My own great grandparents were married when my great grandfather was
31 and his bride was 14. She and her sister married brothers from the
same home town in France. The brothers had come to the US several
years prior to the wedding, the sisters only some months prior.
Whether it was the brides' or the grooms' family who instigated the
pretty obviously arranged marriages, we don't know. Would it make a
difference in terms of them being seen as an &quot;acceptably normal
situation&quot;? Was there &quot;talk?&quot; Not that we're aware of (and there's
been a good deal of family research into the lives of these people).
Perhaps it is simply that my great grandparents didn't live around
people as prudish as those around your grandparents from whom you
claim &quot;there would certainly have been talk.&quot; Perhaps as a result, our
standards are different as far as gossip is concerned.

Whether or not Chaplin was within &quot;acceptably normal&quot; societal
standards is arguable. But it is an entirely separate issue from the
presumptive claim you try to tie to the situation with the
hypothetical you present. I have talked with both Rollie and Lita
directly. The picture of CC as the sole &quot;sexually...very agressive&quot;
individual in the relationship is not at all what I got from those
conversations.

There were only two people present when Chaplin first tried to have sex
with the 15 year year-old Grey.  By her account Chaplin was physically
aggressive and she resisted him.  She may have been lying, but somehow I
doubt it.

Did she flirt with him to try and get a role in a film?  I don't doubt
it.  Did Chaplin and his pals use that as justification for his sexual
predation?  (&quot;Why, the little hussy THREW herself at him!&quot;)  I don't
doubt that, either.

The point of course is that there is no such thing as equality of choice
between a 15 year-old girl of modest means and a rich and powerful man
of 35.  In the arranged marriages you speak of, there was probably no
choice at all, on either side, so the comparison is inexact.

I don't think it's &quot;prudish&quot; to be concerned when a 35 year-old man
engages in an aggressive sexual pursuit of a 15 year-old girl.  It's
creepy -- and quite a different thing from making a life-long commitment
to an arranged marriage which two families have mutullly approved.  As
you know, marriage was the last thing on Chaplin's mind when he was
having sex with the 15 year-old Grey.

I thought we were talking about contemporary standards, not what you

Well, until you publish the transcripts of your conversations with Grey
and the others, there's really no way to evaluate what you say in light
of the other available evidence.  The portrait of Chaplin as a sexual
predator of young girls reflects my best understanding of the published
sources.  The picture that emerges from even the most sympathetic of
these, like David Robinson's biography, is very disturbing.

">

In stating that I was leery, I was remembering what I had read about the
Barry paternity case in John McCabe's biography of Chaplin titled &quot;Charlie
Chaplin&quot; (Doubleday, 1978):

&quot;[A] blood test showed that Joan Barry's was A, [daughter] Carol Ann's was
B, and Chaplin's O, thus making it impossible for him to be the father of
the child. But the presiding judge ruled that the 'ends of justice' would be
best served by a 'full and fair trial of the issues.' Since the key issue
had already been medically determined, this thinking would seem to be rather
clouded. Chaplin, in any case, was placed on trial, which ended in a hung
jury voting seven to five for acquittal. A mistrial being declared, a second
trial began April 12, 1944. [end of page 206]

&quot;Chaplin had retained for his defense Charles A. 'Pat' Millikan, a
straightforward, no-nonsense lawyer, who was sure that the undisputed
medical evidence would acquit his client. Millikan did not count on the
presence on the other side of Joseph Scott, a jury of the old school.  Joan
Barry's first lawyer, on hearing the results of the blood test, withdrew
from the case [!!! take notice of that first lawyer's reaction !!!], but
Scott, a prominent old counselor who had the reputation of putting love of
church and country before all else, forgot the former as he nursed the
latter in spasms of outraged patriotism. [...]

&quot;The Scott histrionics won the day. The jury was out for three hours and
returned with an eleven-to-one decision against Chaplin. The judge ruled
that Chaplin must pay seventy-five dollars a week for Carol Ann until she
was twenty-one. This was done.&quot; [page 207]

Whatever the rules were in California about the weight that could or should
be placed on the results of blood tests in determining paternity in
California courts in 1944, the above passage indicates that the lawyers (on
both sides) expected the blood test results to be introduced and discussed
in the proceedings.  Furthermore, I recall another full-fledged bio that
reported that when Chaplin moved for there to be blood test results as
evidence, he was informed that if any blood samples were taken from the
mother and the child, then those results and Chaplin's too must be provided
to the prosecution, regardless of whose side would be substantiated by the
three-part results.  The account goes on to say that because Chaplin had a
blood type that could result in a baby with blood types other than his, he
was taking a bigger chance than the average person that the results would
make him a &quot;maybe&quot; or a &quot;match&quot; rather than someone ruled out as
possibility.  Nonetheless, Chaplin took the risk by ordering the tests.  His
losing the case despite medical evidence that was statistically-unexpected
made the verdict all the more a miscarriage of justice.

The American Heritage article would have readers believe that blood tests
were inadmissable and thus the jury never heard about them.

I spend a lot of time looking at 1860 -1920 census, and I dont find
May-September marriages all that unusual  for that time period at
all.  Although most seem to be female 16-18, male 26-32 range.
My speculation is that  usually two things account for this, first the
male is generally establishing himself in a profession,  and second
that this is his second marriage (the first usually being deceased -
in those days before antibiotics).

I do note that I have seen fudging upward of the female's age in the
census at times, usually for those who should be 18 and already have 2
children or so (and for those wondering, I estimate the correct age on
the birthyear as reported by their parent in the previous census, and
not on just their ages 20-30 years later).   While not uncommon to be
married at 15 or so,  i'm guessing it was frowned on even then.

(this writer should note that he recalls that his home state had the

&gt; &gt;&gt; [...]  And who among us knew that by 1920 Chaplin
&gt; &gt;&gt; had starred in multiple feature films, and that the one we do know about
&gt; &gt;&gt; had
&gt; &gt;&gt; been directed by Chaplin rather than Mack Sennett?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Please understand that I'm leery about accepting what the article has to
&gt; &gt;&gt; say
&gt; &gt;&gt; about re-entry permits and the admissability of blood-test results.

&gt; &gt; I'm assuming there was an inadvertant omission of the word 'not' in
&gt; &gt; your last sentence. The issues of the re-entry permit and blood tests
&gt; &gt; in California law are pretty well documented (although some would love
&gt; &gt; to ignore evidence of the meeting between McGranery and Hoover).

&gt; In stating that I was leery, I was remembering what I had read about the
&gt; Barry paternity case in John McCabe's biography of Chaplin titled &quot;Charlie
&gt; Chaplin&quot; (Doubleday, 1978):

&gt; &quot;[A] blood test showed that Joan Barry's was A, [daughter] Carol Ann's was
&gt; B, and Chaplin's O, thus making it impossible for him to be the father of
&gt; the child. But the presiding judge ruled that the 'ends of justice' would be
&gt; best served by a 'full and fair trial of the issues.' Since the key issue
&gt; had already been medically determined, this thinking would seem to be rather
&gt; clouded. Chaplin, in any case, was placed on trial, which ended in a hung
&gt; jury voting seven to five for acquittal. A mistrial being declared, a second
&gt; trial began April 12, 1944. [end of page 206]

&gt; &quot;Chaplin had retained for his defense Charles A. 'Pat' Millikan, a
&gt; straightforward, no-nonsense lawyer, who was sure that the undisputed
&gt; medical evidence would acquit his client. Millikan did not count on the
&gt; presence on the other side of Joseph Scott, a jury of the old school.  Joan
&gt; Barry's first lawyer, on hearing the results of the blood test, withdrew
&gt; from the case [!!! take notice of that first lawyer's reaction !!!], but
&gt; Scott, a prominent old counselor who had the reputation of putting love of
&gt; church and country before all else, forgot the former as he nursed the
&gt; latter in spasms of outraged patriotism. [...]

&gt; &quot;The Scott histrionics won the day. The jury was out for three hours and
&gt; returned with an eleven-to-one decision against Chaplin. The judge ruled
&gt; that Chaplin must pay seventy-five dollars a week for Carol Ann until she
&gt; was twenty-one. This was done.&quot; [page 207]

&gt; Whatever the rules were in California about the weight that could or should
&gt; be placed on the results of blood tests in determining paternity in
&gt; California courts in 1944, the above passage indicates that the lawyers (on
&gt; both sides) expected the blood test results to be introduced and discussed
&gt; in the proceedings.  Furthermore, I recall another full-fledged bio that
&gt; reported that when Chaplin moved for there to be blood test results as
&gt; evidence, he was informed that if any blood samples were taken from the
&gt; mother and the child, then those results and Chaplin's too must be provided
&gt; to the prosecution, regardless of whose side would be substantiated by the
&gt; three-part results.  The account goes on to say that because Chaplin had a
&gt; blood type that could result in a baby with blood types other than his, he
&gt; was taking a bigger chance than the average person that the results would
&gt; make him a &quot;maybe&quot; or a &quot;match&quot; rather than someone ruled out as
&gt; possibility.  Nonetheless, Chaplin took the risk by ordering the tests.  His
&gt; losing the case despite medical evidence that was statistically-unexpected
&gt; made the verdict all the more a miscarriage of justice.

&gt; The American Heritage article would have readers believe that blood tests
&gt; were inadmissable and thus the jury never heard about them.
">

Well, in terms of a very narrow, technical reading of the term, it
turns out that David H is right to be leery about the &quot;admissibility&quot;
of the blood evidence in Barry v. Chaplin. However, it is also true,
in an effective sense, that blood evidence was not (at that time)
&quot;admissible&quot; in the same dispositive, conclusive way that is now
legally accepted in excluding paternity. Here's a bit of supporting
documentation:

http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DC123FF930A15752...

&quot;In &quot;DNA Fingerprinting Has Value as Evidence&quot; (letter, Jan. 10), Lee
M. Silver erroneously states that the 1944 verdict forcing Charlie
Chaplin to pay child support for a child that blood testing had
conclusively shown was not his came after the blood test was ruled
inadmissible in court.
In fact, the blood test that excluded Chaplin as father was admitted
into evidence. However, the trial judge allowed the case to go to the
jury on the basis of the mother's &quot;equally persuasive&quot; testimony that
Chaplin was the only man with whom she had had sexual intercourse at
the appropriate times. The jury found the mother more credible than
the scientific evidence. A New Jersey case six years later had the
same result.
That the jury was permitted to consider the evidence and decide
against it is the heart of the issue. The notion that a scientific
test may be so conclusive as to dispose of a case without jury
deliberation has been difficult for courts to accept. Lawyers and
judges tend to believe the surest way to truth is through testimonial
evidence with vigorous cross-examination, and there is a suspicion of
tests that claim to short-circuit the process. Hence juries are
permitted to weigh the scientific and testimonial evidence together,
and grave injustice can result -- as for Chaplin.&quot;

http://books.google.com/books?id=_zU4PCsY774C&amp;pg;=PA39&amp;lpg;=PA39&amp;dq;=blo...

&quot;Establishing A Definition Of Expertise: Frye V. U.S. (1923)

&quot;The presiding judge ruled to exclude the lie detection evidence [in
the Frye case], because it was not based upon a well-recognized and
scientific principle. The ruling was eventually upheld by a Federal
Court of Appeals, yielding the Frye standard for expert admissibility.
Were an expert's opinion not based on &quot;generally accepted&quot; procedures,
it would not be allowed as testimony.

&quot;The Legacy Of The Frye Standard

&quot;Over the years, this rather narrow standard has led to some apparent
injustices. For instance, what about new technologies that have yet to
permeate the practice in a field? The actor Charlie Chaplin, for
example, lost a paternity suit in the 1940s, after a California court
decided that a newly developed blood test eliminating him as the
father was not reliable enough to be binding on the jury. Today, such
a test is considered conclusive proof of paternity and would have
exonerated Mr. Chaplin.&quot;

I will note, however that there are many web citations that use the
&quot;admissiblity&quot; term in the same way as the author of the Am. Heritage
article, including some within the legal field:

http://blog.moschettilaw.com/2007/03/paternity_tests_not_just_for_t.html

&quot;Paternity testing first hit the headlines in 1943, when starlet Joan
Berry sued Charlie Chaplin, claiming he was the father of her child. A
simple blood-type test proved Chaplin could not be the father, but at
the time such tests weren't admissible in court, and Chaplin was
ordered to pay child support. The case prompted new laws allowing
blood tests in paternity cases, but those tests could eliminate just
40 percent of males as father.&quot;

Now, what ecaxtly is it that makes you leery about the re-entry permit
issue?

&gt; I do note that I have seen fudging upward of the female's age in the

&gt; children or so (and for those wondering, I estimate the correct age on
&gt; the birthyear as reported by their parent in the previous census, and
&gt; not on just their ages 20-30 years later).   While not uncommon to be
&gt; married at 15 or so,  i'm guessing it was frowned on even then.

Females did tend to marry at earlier ages in the 1920s than they do now
-- but I hope it's not forgotten in all this that when Chaplin began his
affair with the 15 year-old Grey he had no intention of marrying her.
Far from it.  When she became pregnant he offered her and her family a
lot of money to just go away.

It's one thing for an older man to marry a teenager with the intention
of supporting her and staying with her for the rest of his life -- quite
another to simply want to enjoy her sexual favors at his convenience,
putting her at a far greater risk socially and financially than he would
have to face.

Marriage was a more stable and respected institution then than it is
today, and the offer of it constituted a bona fides on the part of a
suitor which cannot be ascribed to Chaplin in the Grey case.

In the first place, we don't know what Chaplin's intentions were when
he
was first attracted to Lita Grey. He tended to act on impulse when he
was
attracted to someone, without considering the possible consequences,
But
his intentions, assuming that he had any, are  rather beside the
point. If the
age of consent in California had been sixteen and not eighteen (which
was
exceptionally high then, and still is), there would have been nothing
illegal
about his relationship with her, whether he intended to marry her or
not.

We also don't know how he came on to her, but we do know from
some of Jim Tully's writings that she was actively seeking his
attentions.
Whatever approach he used, it probably didn't come as a surprise.

That's not quite the story.  According  to Tully, she came alone to
the studio looking for Chaplin one evening after she was hired, and
Tully
told her where to find Chaplin in order to avoid spending an evening

Chaplin himself. As David pointed out, where was the parental
supervision?

Or was Carlyle Robinson right to think that her mother encouraged her
to make herself so readily available?

Lita always claimed that her mother was determined to protect her

&gt;The point of course is that there is no such thing as equality of choice

&gt; choice at all, on either side, so the comparison is inexact.

&gt; I don't think it's &quot;prudish&quot; to be concerned when a 35 year-old man

&gt; creepy -- and quite a different thing from making a life-long commitment

My guess is that you are attempting to inject your own moral

misquoted) words of someone you never knew or met. If you could be

Predation!?!! You might have a point if you didn't feel compelled to
resort to prudish and false exaggerations of reality as often as you
do. But then, isn't that what 'decency' police have done for what was
it you said, &quot;ten thousand or so years&quot;? And isn't it kind of
tautological anyway, since you reserve for yourself the right to
define who those &quot;decent people&quot; are in the first place? Rather
convenient, don't you think?

And no, I don't think I can &quot;explain away&quot; Chaplin's behavior because
I don't think it needs to be. Realistically understood in context,
yes. Explained away, no need. To quote a pretty astute observer of the
human condition, &quot;I'd sooner understand it, and the nature of it than
condemn it.&quot;

It's nice you have personal standards you're so certain of. It's just
laughable when you think they're universally consistent and applicable
within ten thousand or so years of all the cultural variations that
have made up human history. Are you sure you aren't related to Hedda

the &quot;political police&quot; to deal with.)

I feel fine, but thanks for asking.  Much early recorded history
consists of religious texts which reflect the accumulated beliefs of
people over time, and almost all religious systems throughout history
show disapproval for the sort of behavior Chaplin indulged himself in.
These religious systems of course reflected ideas of what sort of
behavior was required to keep social systems functioning, and this did
not include powerful older men having recreational sex with young girls
outside of marriage.  This has always happened, of course, but the vast
preponderance of religious and social tradition has tended to stigmatize it.

&quot;Decent&quot; doesn't just imply moral uprightness but also a concern for the
welfare of society as a whole, which includes protecting its less
powerful members from the predatory instincts of its more powerful members.

I don't see the relevance of this.  First of all, sex between men and
boys doesn't have the same social and biological consequences as sex
between men and girls and second, even given that fact, the vast
preponderance of historical tradition has tended to stigmatize
extra-marital sex between older men and children of whatever sex.

There are exceptions to everything, of course, but often they just go to
prove the rule.

I'd be far more interested in discovering whether Chaplin's behavior
actually fit, in any objective, rational way, within the meaning of

The section of quote above that I have capitalized, shows the fallacy
of your statement.  If so many people were doing it, then it wasn't
genuinely looked down upon.  It's like the way pornography is today:
publicly most people, and the Church of course, say they're against it
and they claim that society is against it, but it accounts for, by
some estimates, as high as 80% of internet traffic.  Likewise,
although the very idea of marriage is against cheating, there's no
shortage of people cheating on their spouses.  What people say and
what they do are seldom related.  I bet if Chaplin had been
interviewed on the subject before it became public, he'd have said he
was against older men having affairs with younger women.

Women are capable of giving birth at what we consider to be a very
young age, and the reason they're capable at such a young age is quite
simple: It's part of evolution.  Women wouldn't have the ability to
give birth as young as 11 or so unless at some point in history they
were regularly doing so.  And you may have noticed that the common
thing is for females to like older males and for males to like younger
women.  You see a lot more 20 year-old women wanting to date 30
year-old men than you see the reverse.

The whole idea of childhood that we have today is a fairly recent
thing, say about 70 years old.  Before that kids generally didn't have
the kind of childhood that we knew and want for our children.  Kids
were young adults, working full days, helping support their families.
They weren't showered with toys and spending their days at Disneyland.
Lita herself didn't think of herself as a child the way girls of her
age do today; she was out looking for work and looking for a man.

And don't forget that there's no shortage of religions that
*encourage* older men to bed and wed very young women.

There has always been murder, too, but almost all relgious and social
traditions have condemned it.  Does that mean that it hasn't been
&quot;genuinely looked down upon&quot;?

People have socially disruptive sexual and violent urges which society
stimatizes in the interest of creating a more humane, a more &quot;decent&quot;
social order.  &quot;Decency&quot; is indeed a word that's often used to mask
hypocrisy and a double standard, but I still think it's fair to say that
all decent people condemn murder and always have.  It's hard to
imagine any definition of &quot;decent&quot; which wouldn't involve the
condemnation of murder.

Traditionally there has been a social and economic logic in older men
MARRYING younger women, but there has never been a social and econmoic
logic in older men having sex with younger women, and inevitably
impregnating them from time to time, without any corresponding social or
financial commitment to them.  Quite the opposite.  It's a recipe for
social disaster.

I will note again that Chaplin had no interest in or intention of
marrying Lita Grey and did so only under the pressure of her and her
family threatening to create a scandal.  This sort of treatment of young
women has been condemned by almost all societies throughout history,
just about as consistently as murder has been condemned.  The
condemnation may not have eliminated sexual predation or murder but it
has certainly tended to make societies more decent, more humane.

I think it's quite clear from the record (including the above) that
Chaplin's sexual interest in Grey began at the time of &quot;The Kid&quot; -- when
she was 12 years-old.

To me it's quite irrelevant, and somewhat disturbing, to suggest that
the 12 year-old or the 15 year-old Grey &quot;encouraged&quot; this interest.  At
neither age could there have been anything remotely resembling equality
of responsibility or choice between Grey and Chaplin.  Society condemns
the sexual predation of young girls by older and more powerful men
precisely because there is a power imbalance built into the situation,
as well as social consequences (mostly for the young girls) which they
are in no position to evaluate fully.

The case is further complicated morally by the fact that Grey was
fatherless and that part of her supposed &quot;attraction&quot; to the older
Chaplin probably involved a desire for a father figure -- though again
at her age this was very likely not something she understood
consciously.  Part of the responsibility of adult males includes not
taking sexual advantage of children based on such factors.

Yep, that's a fairly accurate transcription. Like I said, Rollie
certainly questioned Chaplin's taste, it's clear to me that's what he
was doing in that quote. It's also clear to me, that if you take the
&quot;drooling&quot; comment as a literal description, you don't know who Rollie
was.

And why am I not surprised you didn't also quote some of the material
just prior where Rollie recounts a conversation with Arthur Kelly
talking about the PR consequences of the Lita relationship, and this
immediately following material where Rollie indicates what he thought
Lita's mother's role was (during the early stages of The Gold Rush):

********
Rollie: So, a little girl...who was...[btw, the elipses indicate
pauses, not omitted material] by the name of Betty Morrissey, was a
friend of Lita's or got to know Lita...and there were several girls,
they used to swim in our swimmin' tank there [the studio pool]...so
Charlie invited Lita, Betty Morrissey and this other girl, I don't
really remember her [garbled], to his home to spend the evening. And
it seemed they all slept in the same bed with him.

(Rollie's brother) Dan: Ooh!

Rollie: Well I know that because the next morning, my office faces
right along side of the gates where he drives in, where he always
drove in. I saw a car, this car pull up, then, out came the old lady,
Lita, and Betty Morrissey and this other girl. And the old lady said,
&quot;I know your secrets now. I know your secrets now.&quot; Well, he froze...

Dan: She must have been an awful...

Rollie: &quot;I know your secrets now.&quot;

Dan: My god, the old lady must have been an awful bitch to have
permitted all this stuff to go on, with teenaged daughters...

[overtalk]

Rollie: Sure. Sure. It was all set. Same way like Lita Grey, Mildred
Harris. The old lady had a lot to do with that too.

*********

So thanks, George, for confirming what I said about the Rollie
transcript and your selective usage thereof.

Given the world's overpopulation, that's certainly true...now. But
again, it is just laughable that you totally ignore the evolutionary
and (nearly universal) historic cultural mandate to &quot;go forth and
multiply,&quot; the familial restrictions on that mandate being very recent
in man's history (especially since after all we're talking on a scale
of &quot;ten thousand or so years&quot;). But that reality blows the whole basis
for your position, so it's quite obvious why you'd choose to ignore
it.

Besides, where's any evidence that Chaplin was going to ignore &quot;any
corresponding social or  financial commitment to&quot; Lita? Or any other
women that you certainly imply (by refering to &quot;women&quot; plural),
without putting yourself in the position of having to name any of
them, that Chaplin was supposedly 'preying' on?

Perhaps condemned, at least in very recent terms (there's still that
ten thousand or so year span). But what evidence can you provide that
it's made &quot;societies more decent, more humane.&quot; I don't see a lot to
indicate that it's true. In fact, one might more logically argue the

barbarism. I guess I just haven't bought into the political religious
right's hypocritical use of 'family values/marriage' in the same way
that you seem to have.

How do you deduce sexual interest in *Lita* from this? I'll grant that
Rollie seems to, but it appears to me that the scene is about a seductive
young female (Lita was made up to look older.) dominating a helpless
male. Of all the footage shot of Lita for the film, why did this
particular scene spark such intense interest? If sexual interest in *Lita*
was the motive, why wasn't he running the shot of her kissing the Tramp
and Reisner repeatedly?

It's probable that Chaplin did see Lita as a potentially attractive
young woman when she was twelve--people do this all the time, and it's
hardly creepy. But according to Carlyle Robinson, he had forgotton
all about her when she showed up at the studio hoping to try out for the
part of the dance hall girl.

We know how he felt about it when it was obvious that he was being
forced into
it. We don't know what he had in mind (if anything) when the liaison
began.
My impression is that in romantic and sexual matters, Chaplin wasn't
much
given to forethought or foresight. The cynical, exploitive attitude
you ascribe to him is
purely a product of your imagination.

The relationship with Lita has always seemed to me like a mildly self-
destructive
repetition of the relationship with Mildred, carried out by a person
with a deeply
ingrained (and easily documented) penchant for repetition. In both
relationships, but
especially the second, Chaplin victimized himself along with the
person he was attracted to.

But now I'm not sure exactly what you're condemning. First you
complained about
the difference in age being &quot;creepy&quot;; now it seems that that's OK, as
long as the older
man has matrimony in mind--even if he is a father figure..

Yes, you're so right.  We can never know what's in another person's
mind.  So why not assume that Chaplin dreamed of a lifetime commitment
to Grey but was put off the idea by the bad behavior of her family in
DEMANDING that he marry her?  Poor fellow!  He wanted to do the right
thing, but others derailed his good intentions.

Sure -- that's the way it was.  Had to be!  And no one can prove
otherwise, can they?

Your devotion to Chaplin is touching but I fear it exists in Neverland.

&gt; Yes, you're so right.  We can never know what's in another person's
&gt; mind.  So why not assume that Chaplin dreamed of a lifetime commitment
&gt; to Grey but was put off the idea by the bad behavior of her family in
&gt; DEMANDING that he marry her?  Poor fellow!  He wanted to do the right
&gt; thing, but others derailed his good intentions.

&gt; Sure -- that's the way it was.  Had to be!  And no one can prove
&gt; otherwise, can they?
">

Prove? Probably not. But there are certainly indicators which, if the
bias and prejudice isn't too strong, could help point the way toward
reason.

I'd ask, where are the historical realities that point toward
&quot;predation?&quot; Or that Chaplin &quot;just wanted to enjoy her sexual favors
with no corresponding commitment?&quot; Is that consistent with what we
know about any of his other relationships? With Hetty? Was his
reaction to her death an indication of a lack of emotional commitment?
Or with Mildred, who faked a pregnancy to get Chaplin to marry her?
Tell me again, who was the predator in that relationship? Did Chaplin
avoid responsibility to Mildred, even though she tricked him into the
marriage? Who are the other girls (there must be others, because those
certainly don't support your contentions or characterizations) that
were the victims of Chaplin's predation? Can you possibly contend that
Paulette was one. Or Oona? Who then?

See, the fact is that we DO have evidence of Chaplin accepting
(regardless of whatever reluctance there may have been on his part, or
familial coercion that existed) responsibility for his sexual
involvements. Can you cite an example of a situation where he didn't?

This entirely misses the point of the conversation at hand, which
concerns Lita Grey.  Chaplin accepted responsibility for the
relationship only under the pressure of Grey and her family threatening
to create a scandal.  There is no way he intended or wanted to assume
such responsibility when his sexual relationship with the 15 year-old
Grey began.  To suggest otherwise -- or to dismiss the issue with the
observation that &quot;we can never know what's in another person's mind&quot; --
is, at best, naive.

I agree completely. The &quot;we can never know...&quot; was a direct quote from
you in a previous post.

And the point at hand was not Lita Grey. It was your characterization
of Chaplin as a predator unwilling to accept responsibility for his
sexual activities. I quite simply pointed out that your
characterization is inconsistent with historic reality. You claim to
know (with absolute certainty, if your choice of language means
anything) that &quot;[t]here is no way he [Chaplin] intended or wanted to
assume such responsibility when his sexual relationship with the 15
year-old Grey began.&quot; Setting aside for the moment the fact that a
vast majority of sexual relationship beginnings throughout history
(certainly if we're talking about the timeframe you've suggested of
ten thousand or so years) happen when both partners are unsure about
their commitment, HOW is it that you KNOW with such certainty  &quot;there
was no way&quot; Chaplin was willing to accept the consequences for his
actions? The FACT that Chaplin 'did the right thing' by Lita, even
with the pressure from her family, proves less about his original
intentions than it does about the willingness of her family to resort
to manipulation and greed (especially if the reports about her
mother's involvement are to be considered). From his previous
relations? What we know of his relationships with Hetty and Mildred
indicate otherwise. From his later actions? With whom? You simply
continue down your myopic path in spite of all the factual evidence to
the contrary.

Was Chaplin attracted to younger women? All the evidence would
indicate absolutely yes. Was he a predator unwilling to accept
responsibility for his actions? You haven't offered a shred of
evidence to indicate that was the case. I myself am not aware of any,
and indeed I have offered facts that indicate Chaplin was not as you
contend. Yet you continue to act as if your portrayal is gospel. I
can't think of a single logical reason for that. The only rational
explanation I can conceive of is blinding prejudice and bias or
perhaps an unquestioning willingness to accept conventional wisdom
even in the face of contradicting facts (which may be one and the same
thing). What else can it be?

Not necessarily. Sometimes they tell us, but we don't have any

I don't recall anyone assuming this--least of all me. Everything I've
learned
about Chaplin makes me think that he was simply following his
impulses. One could regard this as irresponsible, and he certainly
paid for it.

Trying to force anyone into marriage is indeed bad behavior, and
most people today have sense enough not to do it.

If a daughter of yours got pregnant, would you force an unwilling
father to marry her?

Of course Chaplin was wealthy, and had other rare advantages
to offer a spouse. That couldn't have had anything to do with
Lita's family insisting on marriage, could it?. ;-)

Your view of Lita and her family as innocent victims of predation
hovers in the realm of pure absurdity.

And you haven't answered my question regarding what it is that you
actually object to.

Desperation must be setting in.

So, when I contend that I know; based on previous statements, and the
philosophies of several of his films, as well as the context of the
event and surrounding events at which the words were spoken (not to
mention a plain reading of the quoted words themselves), that
Chaplin's toast at the Geneva Peace Conference was not intended as
support for dictatorships but instead was an expression of Chaplin's
mindset of &quot;hope and desire for a better life for the Chinese people,
and for all people,&quot; you would be &quot;at best, naive&quot; to dismiss my
observation?    Funny, that's what *I've* thought all along.

It's like putting your hands over your ears in order to avoid hearing an

That was my characterization of Chaplin's behavior in the Grey affair.
I believe it to be not only correct but painfully obvious to any
non-biased observer.
