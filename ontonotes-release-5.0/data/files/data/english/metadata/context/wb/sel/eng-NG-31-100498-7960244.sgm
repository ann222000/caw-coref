the fuel pump has been changed but i'm wondering if it could be the
brain/pcm or ignition module.Any help anyone can give me would be
appreciated
thanks

I didn't know that they made a '98 Aerostar..........
Production stopped in '97.

If it were a 1988 Aerostar, I'd say the TFI module.

Sorry everyone, my bad.I incorrectly stated that it was a 1998.The date of
manufacture is 4/95.
It is the weirdest thing,after driving for an hour or so it sputters
like its running out of gas,but after checking the fuel line by the
filter
there was no clog but plenty of fuel pressure.
I let it sit for awhile then it restarts.In the morning it must be cool
enough cause it doesnt act up . But in these lovely arizona
afternoons,Yuck! the heat zaps it

The fuel pressure regulator.

Put a pressure gauge on the Schrader valve on the fuel rail and watch
it(tape it to the windshield facing in)  as you drive and the symptoms
return.

It seems to be a common problem on 3.0 &amp; 4.0 Aerostars... underhood
temps maybe an issue?  It appears to come up more on Aerostars than on
Explorers/Rangers &amp; the Taurus/Sable.

Heat soak, vapor lock.

Even with EFI and the fuel line under pressure form the in-tank
pump, if you cook the fuel it will still vaporize in the lines, and
the &quot;Low Emissions&quot; gasoline blends with lots of alcohol in them don't
help.  And if you're at higher altitudes that's a triple whammy.

Some cars have a bypass orifice or a pressure regulator near the
engine that continuously circulates some of the fuel back to the tank,
and it's supposed to bypass the vapors if it vaporlocks before that
point.

But if it vaporlocks past that point, on top of the engine in the
fuel rails, you just have to wait for the fuel to cool and liquefy
again or purge it out through the injectors.

Make sure that any places the fuel line goes past the exhaust system
or other hot points it is well shielded - there may have been factory
heat shielding there that a clueless mechanic removed because &quot;It was
in the way&quot; or &quot;It got greasy&quot; and they didn't replace it because they
weren't thinking.

The test is to wrap a rag around the fuel line in the suspect area
and keep it wet with water from a spray bottle, and see if you solve
the problem.

It dies, you pop the hood and wet down the fuel lines with a little
hand spray bottle full of cool water to condense it, the engine starts
right back up - that's proof for me.

That will show where you need to install more permanent forms of
heat blocking over the fuel line, like fiberglass pipe-wrap insulation
covered with a layer of high-heat aluminum foil style duct-tape as
radiant reflective insulation (and oil/grease block).

And quite possibly the ignition system. The fuel pressure regulator
can be a PITA to change on an Aerostar. It's not hard, just
inconvenient. A shortened Allen wrench can really help. As often as
they go out on an Aero, it's almost a maintenance item.
