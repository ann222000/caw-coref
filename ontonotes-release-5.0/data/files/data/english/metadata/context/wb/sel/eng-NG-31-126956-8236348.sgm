Like many of the other athletes on our vaunted list, the man who would be
called Mr. Wonderful got his start on the grid iron. Also like many of the
wrestlers on this list college success was met with apathy by professional
scouts. While Orndorff was not able to catch on as a running back after
success at the University of Tampa, he turned to legendary wrestling trainer
Hiro Matsuda, who also trained Hulk Hogan and many other top wrestlers out
of Florida, to teach him the noble art of professional wrestling.

Early in his career he was a top star in many of the NWA member federations
winning titles in Georgia, the Mid-Atlantic, Tri-state, and Mid-America
regions. He even was tapped to pursue Ric Flair for the NWA world
championship. He was unable to win and soon headed &quot;up North&quot; where he would
achieve his greatest notoriety.

Upon his arrival to the WWF he aligned himself with &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper and
Bob &quot;Ace&quot; Orton. These three soon became the top heels in the company
feuding with the likes of the Junkyard Dog and Jimmy Snuka. Orndorff
competed at the infamous &quot;War to Settle the Score&quot; defeated Tony Atlas
before interfering on behalf of Roddy Piper against Hulk Hogan to set up the
main event for the first ever Wrestlemania.

Orndorff took the fall in the first Wrestlemania main event, and was
subsequently left behind by his former allies Orton and Piper. Over the next
few months he became the unlikely ally of Hulk Hogan against Piper and
Orton. This alliance was not to last though, as Orndorff soon became
resentful of Hogan's popularity insisting he was the better wrestler and in
better shape. Mr. Wonderful turned on the beloved Hulkster and the result
was the feud of the year for 1986. Their hatred culminated in one of the
best cage matches ever after both simultaneously escaping the cage the match
was restarted and Paul succumbed to the Hulkamania machine. Orndorff spent a
few more years in the WWF before heading south for a &quot;cup of coffee&quot; in the
NWA.

He disappeared from the wrestling scene for a few years before resurfacing
in Smokey Mountain Wrestling. It would not be long before the big time would
call again. This time it was in the form of WCW and in short order he won a
tournament for the vacant WCW Television title. After a short run with that
belt he teamed with &quot;Pretty&quot; Paul Roma as &quot;Pretty Wonderful.&quot; Say what you
will about Roma, but the tandem did win two WCW tag team titles.

Injuries eventually sidelined Orndorff's in-ring career, the worst of which
was a stinger that led to an atrophied right side of his body. This is where
Orndorff's toughness and character truly shined through. He has stated in
interviews that despite the atrophied look of his right side in many ways
his right arm was much stronger. He worked very hard to make sure that this
setback would not set him back at all.

Orndorff capped off his stellar career with induction into the 2005 WWE Hall
of Fame. He shared this honor with Hulk Hogan, Bob Orton, and Roddy Piper
with whom he shared some of his biggest moments in his WWF career. Paul
Orndorff will always be remembered for his devastating Pile Driver finishing
maneuver and his all around toughness as a wrestler and a human being.
