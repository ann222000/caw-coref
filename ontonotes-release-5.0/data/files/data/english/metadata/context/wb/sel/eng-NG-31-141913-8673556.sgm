Attorneys push individual GM rice cases

Only a lowdown man crosses family and friends. So when Martin Phipps
heard GM rice class action attorneys had claimed in a Delta Farm
Press article that attorneys shepherding individual lawsuits werent
presenting a full picture of the litigious situation, his ire was set
to boil.

In August, class co-counsel Adam Levitt said attorneys advocating
individual suits were within their rights (see http://
deltafarmpress.com/rice/070823-GM-suit/index.html). But what weve
seen and heard is some information being imparted  thats both
inaccurate and, frankly, misleading.

It creates a negative impression of whats going on, it oversells,
it ignores the process and effect of the class certification ruling
in the case (which hasnt happened yet), it overstates potential
recoveries and puts the farmers in a position of making a decision
without having all the information

Phipps, a partner in the San Antonio, Texas-based Goldman, Pennebaker
and Phipps, vehemently rejects those charges and others made in the
article.

We werent trolling for clients. We were called because we have
family members who are rice farmers. We now represent over 100 Texas
rice farmers and began meeting with them at their request. Were a
defense firm and dont normally represent plaintiffs, dont advertise
for them.

Were not fighting with the class. Im not here to defeat the class.
Im here to make sure farmers are provided all their options. How is
that not in their best interest?

Phipps took calls from farmers immediately after the Aug. 18, 2006,
USDA announcement that Bayers GM LibertyLink trait had been found in
U.S. rice supplies. Following the announcement, markets were jolted
and later several popular varieties found with the trait were banned
from production. Lawsuits  both individual and class action  were
filed.

Jim Thompson of Hare, Wynn, Newell and Newton, LLP, is also unhappy
with anyone steering farmers away from individual cases.

If you get into a class action, 99 times out of 100 you wont be
made whole, says Thompson, whose firm  with offices in Birmingham,
Ala., and Little Rock, Ark.  is representing some 275 individual
Arkansas farmers. Just look at the StarLink case to see that. If you
are in an individual suit, you have the opportunity to say my
damages are X, and I want every penny.

A few years ago, the StarLink case made global headlines when a GM
trait was found in U.S. corn and food products were pulled from
market shelves. Thompson says the class action brought on behalf of
farmers achieved little outside heaping coin into class attorney
pockets.

They settled that StarLink case for $110 million. Then, they shipped
out a bunch of Visa debit cards to the members for about $1,000 a
piece. The lawyers made $34 million. So a class action isnt always
the way to go.

We know what were doing when it comes to farming, we know what (our
clients) damages are and theyre a lot more than $1,000 a piece.

Thompson promises the individual cases will take the opposite course.
Each farmer has a unique situation on his farm. One may have more
damages than another. Whatever those damages are, well prove and
well ask a jury to give it to them  to the penny.

From south Texas, Phipps echoes Thompson. Weve retained an expert
who has done these type of cases since 1993. We decided to go with
individual cases  and each farmer will be looked at individually and
wont be clumped in with general damages. Were giving each person
the right of control. Well have a team of experts and each farmer
will have his farm studied and a damage model will be done for each.

Phipps partner, Doug Pennebaker, says there is an obvious
philosophical difference between him and class attorneys as to what
type of litigation is in farmers best interest. We have a fair
disagreement on that.

Class action lawyers believe a class action is the quicker way to
get a recovery for farmers, with the least effort by farmers. And
thats true. As a general rule, in a class action most of the farmers
wont do anything.

Class actions are most suitable when there are a many people who have
small, similar damages, says Pennebaker, originally from Indianola,
Miss. For example, if youve got $100 in damages, you wont hire a
lawyer to represent you. In such situations, class actions serve a
very important function of representing a mass of people that
wouldnt be able to have legal representation otherwise.

However, if a persons damages are large, a class action isnt
necessarily the best option. Thats also true if the damages are
disparate.

We believe its best that our experts sit down, meet with the
farmers, evaluate their operations, determine a damage model based on
(findings), and present that in court. Now, Bayer wont just roll
over and agree with the damage models. But our goal is to create a
model that will capture all the farmers damages.

Thompson points to his firms recent success in backing aggrieved hog
farmers taking on Tyson Foods (see http://deltafarmpress.com/news/
farming_former_tyson_producer/index.html) and says similar success
will come to rice growers. When we represented the Tyson farmers,
every one of them was made whole  Weve got (rice) farmers with
6,000 acres of rice to those with 400 to 500 acres. Theyre scattered
up and down the state.

Does suing not only German-based Bayer but also Stuttgart, Ark.-based
Riceland Foods give Thompson pause?

Not in the least. Juries get the right answers if they get the facts
of a case. Even a jury in Stuttgart can give a proper verdict. Tyson
was an Arkansas company too. Eventually well be back in Arkansas
trying these cases.

Damage claims could cost Bayer in excess of $1 billion, says
Thompson. He hasnt looked into how much the cases could cost
Riceland.

Phipps claims eagerness to take on Bayer. Listen, if we have to go
to trial, theres no one Id rather represent against a foreign
company than an American farmer.

When considering damages, the entire scope of the situation must be
tallied, say the attorneys. After all, the StarLink genes are yet to
be fully purged and rice seed can be viable for many years. How might
volunteer rice affect future exports and shipment testing? If the
trait gets into red rice, what will farmers do?

There can be volunteer GM rice for 15 years, says Phipps. So
(potential) damages wont be from just this year. We ask farmers how
to stop the problem cold. No one has an answer.

Damages wont be calculated based solely on acreage, says Thompson.
One farmer may have 700 acres and a $50,000 loss. Another farmer may
have 3,000 acres with $1 million in losses.

Weve hired experts to study farms numbers and tax returns so they
can tell us what each farmer lost. Were not going to throw all the
farmers in a cattle car and send them a $1,000 debit card and walk
off with our $34 million fee. Thats not right.

How quickly might individual cases be tried? We dont know, says
Pennebaker. It will take another year, for sure  maybe two years.

Time is where we really have an advantage, says Thompson. We
expect to have these cases prepared and tried by the end of 2008. The
class action could drag on for years. The best they can do right now
is a 2009 trial date.

Thats one advantage of being in a state court, in your backyard,
where the judges will set cases for trial.

Phipps tells farmers, Yes, a class action is less work. The chance
of (resolving the case) quicker is more likely. But you must weigh
the possibility of recovery in a class versus an individual case.

Our farmers will have both choices. If theres ever a class offer,
Ill meet with every farmer and ask, What do you want to do? Im
sure some farmers will take it.

There is an element of gamesmanship and strategy leading up to trial,
say all attorneys interviewed. We tell farmers, The more people we
represent, when we negotiate with Bayer, the more we have to bargain
with, says Phipps. Not only that, but look at the companys
expenses. As a practical matter, Bayer can call a class lawyer and
try to settle most cases based on one farmer. Thats a lot cheaper
than, Lets talk about Farmer A. Next, lets see what well do for
Farmer B.

There are politics here, too. If too many individual cases are
filed, it makes it more difficult to have a class action certified.

The difference between the two sets of attorneys, claims Thompson,
is were trial lawyers and theyre class action attorneys. They
dont go to court. They go to settle.

Facing a possible schedule of hundreds of cases doesnt worry the
firms. We may have to go to trial with every single case, says
Phipps. Each farmer may have to be deposed and answer discovery  I
take offense at anyone who says we cant handle these cases because
were a small firm. These farmers include my friends and family! I
will go to the ends of the earth for them. I have to look them in the
eye. We will fight it to the end.

Whatever happens, the lawyers say their rice-farming neighbors are
sinking. We get calls every week from farmers trying to restructure
debt and on the verge of bankruptcy, says Pennebaker. Times were
already tough before the (rice GM situation) happened.

A significant percentage of our farmers will go out of business,
claims Thompson, who vows to take no pay from any farming client who
doesnt win more money individually than they would from the class
action. They cant pay their debts, they cant buy fertilizer, they
cant buy seed rice. They cant stay in business because of this
Our only goal is to get the farmers justice.
