It works on the M42, as it has done in Holland for many years.

Hard shoulders were necessary when cars frequently broke down. Nowadays they
are a waste of valuable road space.

Are they peak time only in Holland?

Of course it does mean that cameras will be deployed everywhere they are
used.  The scheme should pay for itself in no time at all!

Have you actually used the M42 at peak hours when this system is in
operation?
It works surprisingly well.

The hard shoulder is only used when the speed has dropped to 40 or 50 mph
and the traffic flow is much more constant with none of the sudden braking
you get on other motorways. As a result the chances of a shunt are much
reduced and there's extra bays to the left of the hard shoulder every few
hundred meters for cars to pull into.
In addition, on the M42 the hard shoulder isn't continuous - it only runs
between junctions so it's used by cars that have just joined before they
move over to L1 , and cars that plan to leave that move left after the last
exit.

The hard shoulder is only opened (using gantry signs) when congestion builds
to a point where traffic speeds fall below a certain level. Essentially this
means during the rush hour.

Should an ambulance need to get through I would presume it does the same as
it does on a dual carriageway.

It is safer because when in use, the lane can be returned to a hard
shoulder through the use of cameras and electronic signage in a very
short period of times (less than a couple of minutes).

The variable limit on the M25 seems to be effective at that without

Build parallel routes (German style):

&lt; http://maps.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF8&amp;om;=1&amp;ll;=51.679368,7.207031&amp;spn;=5.14... &gt;

That way, the journey can be more direct and a single overturned lorry
is less likely to paralyse a region.

Easy.

Just:

(a) build asymmetrically (using the current full width for
unidirectional travel, whilst placing another carriageway some
distance away, or even above the current one, as per various examples
in the UK or - more particularly - in Italy), or

(b) construct a completely new line for the route and use the old (ie,
currect) route for something else (eg, as a more local road). That's
not only currently being done (progressively) on the Italian A1
autostrada through the Apennines near Bologna, but is also being done
right now on the A2 at Gravesend.

AIUI the Highway Authority bought enough land to widen the M1 to 4
lanes from the outset 35 ++ years ago.

If they didn't they could well have done before all the housing was
built alongside the motorway in Long Eaton.

I don't know if the land they bought would have supported a full whack
widening to 4 lanes or just the miserable miser-rate proposals we are
presented with.

Given the absolutely horrendous rates of accidents and consequent
delays around the East Midlands section of the M1 on Thursdays and
Fridays, it is absolutely scandalous that this issue has not been
addressed before now.
