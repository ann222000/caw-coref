Surge and destroy in Iraq
By Michael Schwartz

If you are trying to figure out how US President George W Bush's new
strategy is progressing, or just trying to figure out what is
happening in Iraq, here is a diagnosis and a bit of a prognosis.

Bush has promised three prongs to his new strategy: (1) attacking and
neutralizing Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia; (2) confronting
Iran; and (3) a new offensive against Sunni insurgents.

Neutralizing the Mehdi Army: Since 2004, cleric Muqtada al-Sadr has
been the Shi'ite the Bush administration has most loved to hate.
Early in the war, occupation officials tried to have him arrested and
fought three large battles (two in Najaf, one in the vast Baghdad
slum of Sadr City) in an attempt to suppress his guerrilla militia,
the Mehdi Army. Each time, he and his forces, deeply entrenched in
Sadr City, have bounced back stronger and more popular than ever. In
its fourth manifestation, the intention to dislodge, disrupt or
destroy the Mehdi Army appears guaranteed to fail. It is just a
matter of what sort of failure the US will choose.

As the new strategy has so far been implemented, US military tactics
seem designed to yield a relatively modest failure, though one that
may prove indirectly responsible for significant Iraqi civilian
casualties. US troops have begun operations in Sadrist strongholds
(notably Sadr City), which were, until late last year, US "no-go zones".

But they are not trying to pacify them, as they have been attempting
with Sunni neighborhoods in the capital. Instead, they are mounting
raids designed to arrest specific Sadrist leaders, while leaving the
rest of the community alone. So far, Muqtada's men have decided to
lie low and not resist the US intrusions (though the targeted
individuals are frequently gone when the Americans arrive, often
resulting, evidently, in the arrest of any fighting-age man in the
vicinity). There are even rumors that Muqtada is cooperating with at
least some of the arrests, allowing the Americans to apprehend
"rogue" Mehdi Army leaders who have not been following his orders.

Whatever the story may be, this strategy will leave the strength of
the Mehdis - who are not just a militia but, like Hezbollah in
Lebanon, a social movement with deep and complex ties to, and support
from, poor Shi'ite communities - unimpaired. It cannot generate
sufficient arrests to decapitate the militia; nor can its "hit and
run" tactics undermine the political and military domination
exercised by the Sadrists in these neighborhoods. At best, it is a
kind of ongoing harassment, a symbolic denial of Sadrist power.

It will not be surprising, therefore, if the US escalates these raids
into larger-scale attacks on Sadrist strongholds. If this were done,
it would involve the sort of brutal invasions currently being
undertaken in Sunni neighborhoods. Typically these attacks begin when
US troops close off an area, demand that all women and children
leave, and then initiate a house-to-house sweep, treating the
community, in essence, as a "free-fire zone". Each house is inspected
for lurking insurgents or other suspicious characters (sometimes
simply any men of fighting age) and searched for arms caches (which
are plentiful). Anyone who evades the invaders, hinders their search,
or offers any sort of resistance may be considered an enemy
combatant. The level of destruction can be quite awesome.

If the US tries this in Sadrist strongholds, the Mehdis will have no
choice but to fight back; they will not sit by while their
communities are savaged. This could trigger a guerrilla confrontation
in Shi'ite communities much like the ferocious fighting that has been
seen in Sunni areas. The battle of Tal Afar, which in 2005 turned
parts of that city into ghost neighborhoods and reduced a quarter of
it to rubble (still not cleared away), has been explicitly mentioned
as a "model" for these sorts of offensives.

It is one thing to mount such attacks against Iraq's Sunni minority.
Used against the 60% majority Shi'ite community, these tactics would
likely spur a response that would spread around the country and prove
disastrous for US plans, which are already in tatters. The Mehdis
would certainly retaliate in other neighborhoods - wherever, in fact,
the Americans are vulnerable. If the US military is already almost
drowning in the Sunni insurgency, imagine the predicament of US
troops should they suddenly have to fight any significant number of
Shi'ites as well.

Such a development would have two clear consequences: an exponential
growth in the strain on an already overstretched US military, and a
dramatic increase in the use of air power to back up embattled troops
on the ground. Together, these could result not just in massacres,
but in the rubble-ization of significant parts of Baghdad and
possibly other Iraqi cities.

If the US military stays with its current strategy of surgical
incursions, it might escape with only a modest defeat. If it
escalates, it is courting unmitigated disaster in the wake of
unprecedented brutality.

Confronting Iran: There are all sorts of symptoms of the new approach
to Iran, including the (mostly trumped up) accusations about that
country supplying Iraqi insurgents with advanced weaponry, the
arrests of accused Iranian infiltrators and their Iraqi allies, and
the stationing of a second aircraft-carrier task force in the Persian
Gulf (with possibly two more on the way). And the US and foreign
media have been carrying a constant stream of reports about possible
US or Israeli air attacks on Iran itself.

Bush administration accusations of Iranian "interference" in the
Iraqi political and military situation are particularly ironic, and
not just because the idea of the US accusing anyone else of "outside
interference" in Iraq is so absurd. The added irony derives from the
administration's most dramatic claim - that the Iranians are
supplying the insurgency with a new type of improvised explosive
device (IED) that can pierce armor.

There is plenty of debate over the accuracy of this charge, but if
the Iranians are supplying sophisticated IEDs, it's to the Shi'ite
insurgents (even the US military admits to that); and the US is not
(currently) fighting the Shi'ite insurgents, it's fighting Sunni
insurgents, who hate Iran just as much as - possibly more than - the
US. However, this accusation is most often stripped of this critical
"detail" in the media (especially on television news). Therefore, the
impression is left that a large proportion of American casualties are
somehow being caused by Iranian technology. That, too, is absurd.

The same can be said about most other Bush administration claims
against Iran, including those about that country's possible nuclear-
weapons program. The latest US intelligence reports indicate that the
Iranians could develop a bomb in perhaps five to 10 years, hardly the
sort of immediate threat that might provide a handy justification for
an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.

But the fact that these accusations are so spindly only adds to fears
that the administration is constructing a web of lies, half-truths,
and cherry-picked intelligence to justify an already-planned attack -
just as its top officials did four years ago in the run-up to the
invasion of Iraq.

There are, unfortunately, plenty of indications that the US might
indeed be preparing to attack Iran or have the Israelis do it. The
presence of two aircraft-carrier battle groups is but the most
visible (with a third and even a fourth one rumored to be en route);
the appointment of the first US Navy man, Admiral William J Fallon,
to head Centcom - and he has a background in naval aviation at that -
is another; and the recent reports of behind-the-scenes protests over
a possible air assault on Iran from top military officers (including
unprecedented threats of high-level resignations) are all tangible
signs of serious intent.

But many similar indications were present last spring and no attack
occurred, presumably because saner heads inside the Bush
administration prevailed. This reflects the fact that, even from the
point of view of many of those who embrace the goal of US pre-
eminence in the Middle East (which might indeed call for reversing
the upward trajectory of Iranian regional power), such an attack
might well appear to be counterproductive.

Instead of stabilizing the situation in Iraq and reducing Iranian
leverage in the region, it would likely destabilize Iraq further
(because Iran's Shi'ite allies there would certainly respond
forcefully and violently), and it might even undermine the viability
of Saudi Arabia (because Shi'ite rebellions could spread to the oil-
rich areas of that country). Most significant, instead of dislodging
the Iranian regime, a US attack, no matter how powerful, would
probably entrench it - and at a terrible cost. Instead of restoring
US credibility as an indomitable military presence in the Middle
East, the failure of such an attack would further undermine it (as
Israel's fruitless attack on Lebanon did for it last summer).

The logic of the situation suggests that all this is saber-rattling -
an attempt to use the threat of war to wrest concessions from the
Iranians. But we are dealing with the Bush administration, which has
a habit of pursuing "counterproductive" policies. We must carefully
watch the events of the coming months, particularly the current talk
about actual negotiations between the administration and the Iranian
regime. This one could tip either way.

Attacking the Sunni insurgents: What might happen sooner or later in
Shi'ite neighborhoods is already the reality in Sunni communities and
cities. For the most part, the new strategy in Sunni areas of Baghdad
is the same old strategy, seen not only in major battles such as
those of Fallujah and Tal Afar, but in various neighborhoods of such
cities as Ramadi, Mosul or Samarra. There is, however, a new twist:
the Americans now intend to keep troops at fortified mini-bases in
many of Baghdad's Sunni neighborhoods - supposedly to establish long-
term stability and facilitate reconstruction - after (and sometimes
even before) they are "cleared of insurgents". The small forward
bases - really glorified police stations - will be placed in the
middle of Baghdad "hot spots".

The first prong of this new policy is doomed. No area in Baghdad, or
for that matter in Iraq, has been successfully pacified in this
manner. That includes Fallujah and Tal Afar, where this very strategy
has been applied and has failed. About 1,000 American soldiers,
supplemented by Iraqi (Shi'ite) troops, have been in Fallujah for 27
months since the city was "cleared" (that is, largely destroyed).
They have established a particularly harsh form of martial law and
yet the insurgency in the city, without ever having disappeared, has
slowly grown again in strength. Fallujah is not pacified and the
Americans have never actually initiated a real program of
reconstruction there. In other cities, with less comprehensive
occupations, the insurgency is even more robust, and there isn't even
talk of reconstruction.

US implementation of this plan in Baghdad has already begun, with a
devastating offensive in the Haifa Street area, near the heavily
fortified Green Zone, which quickly escalated into the wholesale
destruction of the neighborhood. Once the initial onslaught was over,
the offensive devolved into a case of Shi'ite ethnic cleansing; Sunni
residents who left during the heavy fighting are not being allowed
back in by the Shi'ite police and troops who arrived with the
Americans. We can expect a regular diet of such clashes, possibly
marked by the liberal use of air power, guaranteed to devastate
neighborhoods, followed by sectarian struggles over who will
repossess the destroyed buildings, usually resolved in favor of the
Shi'ite allies of the US troops.

The second prong of the new policy - the creation of a permanent US
presence in insurgent strongholds - is only now beginning to be
implemented. Besides the fact that the planned number of outposts
(not more than 50 in any published estimates) could not hope to purge
the city of Sunni insurgents, this tactic will provide stationary
targets for guerrilla fighters - invitations for well-planned attacks.

In Ramadi, where this strategy is being implemented, there has
already been a successful car-bombing at the most important of the US
posts, and it seems likely that this is only the beginning. We should
expect reports of various forms of attacks against these bases as
soon as the Sunni insurgents get their bearings and develop their
strategic plans.

The bottom line
We are looking at desperate measures aimed at reversing the decline
of US power in the Middle East. In all three areas designated by the
surge plan, this desperation has led to the consideration of, or even
the embrace of, more destructive strategies.

The immediate results on the ground already look disastrous in ways
that - though they shouldn't - invariably seem to catch US officials
off-guard. For instance, when they focus the limited forces available
to them on Baghdad, the guerrillas begin to look for less well-
guarded targets elsewhere, as seems now to be happening in the city
of Samarra.

In addition, even the so-far-modest US incursions into Shi'ite areas
of the capital have had the horrifying effect of facilitating some of
the most horrendous suicide car-bombings yet recorded. One instance
of this was succinctly described by New York Times reporters James
Wong and Wassam Habeeb:
On February 18, just two days after Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-
Maliki called the opening stage of the security drive a "dazzling
success", two bombs ripped through a market in the New Baghdad
neighborhood, where American soldiers had been on patrol just minutes
earlier, killing at least 60 people.
The way a US patrol and a car-bombing coincided was no accident. The
New Baghdad neighborhood, like almost all Shi'ite communities in the
capital, has been policed by the Mehdi Army on an ongoing basis.
Besides enforcing all manner of local law, the Mehdis are also
vigilant about possible suicide bombers, quickly recognizing strange
people or vehicles that enter their neighborhoods. At the same time,
wary citizens are also on the lookout, alerting the local Mehdis
whenever they see someone who looks suspicious.

When the Americans come through on patrol or - even worse - when they
set up permanent checkpoints (either US- or Iraqi-manned), the Mehdis
have to lie low, since the Americans (or their Iraqi sidekicks) will
arrest or kill them. The community is then in essence left
unprotected and open to intruders.

The Sunni jihadis know this, and they also know that the Americans
(and their Iraqi sidekicks) have neither the ability nor the
inclination to spot and interdict suspicious-looking outsiders. So
they target precisely those Shi'ite neighborhoods that the Americans
are busy "pacifying". Very often, as in the case of the New Baghdad
bombing, they time their attacks just after the Americans pass
through, and before the Mehdis can return to the streets.

Since the surge policy began, there has been a rash of these almost
coordinated bombings, including the sequential car bombs in Sadr City
that killed 215, the demolition of the Baghdad booksellers' market
that killed at least 38, and the attack on Shi'ite pilgrims outside
Hilla that killed at least 70. In each of these cases, the bombings
coincided with US patrols that virtually "ran interference" (to use
an unfortunately appropriate US football term) for terrorist attacks.
And in each case, local residents registered furious complaints that
the Mehdi Army had been forced to "stand down".

All of this is unsettling enough. Worse yet, in the confrontation
with the Sadrists, the Bush administration appears to be edging
toward search-and-destroy operations that will rubble-ize Shi'ite
neighborhoods; in the confrontation with Iran, it appears to be
lurching toward a possible air assault on a remarkably wide range of
targets inside that country, guaranteeing staggering levels of
civilian casualties; in the confrontation with the Sunni insurgents,
it is already mobilizing its ground and air power with the promise of
the subsequent imposition of an extreme form of martial law. The
hallmark of all these new strategies is the high level of destruction
and mayhem they promise.

There is a larger pattern that should, by now, be clear in these
developments, and all that have come before. The architects of US
policy in the Middle East tend to keep escalating the level of
brutality in search of a way to convince the Iraqis (and now the
Iranians) that the only path that avoids indiscriminate slaughter is
submission to a Pax Americana. Put another way, US policy in the
Middle East has devolved into unadorned state terrorism.
