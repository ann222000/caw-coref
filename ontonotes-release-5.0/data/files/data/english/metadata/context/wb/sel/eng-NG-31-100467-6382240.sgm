Dear All,

I have been reading your posts for a while. Seems like what has been
happening to me lately is important enough to ask about it online.  It
relates to my job/career. I was hoping to get a long-term position at
the school where i work, currenlty i am on "soft money" project-
related position. I was expecting to get the position but it went
completely opposite and I end up much worse off in terms of my
prospects for the future. So I wanted to elicit your opinion on what
does it look I should do, i.e. move away and when. The interview was
on the 7th of this month
the data is fifth of september year seventy-two, eighteen-thirty time;
55n45  37e35;
i work in 55n53 4w15 if that helps. (sorry about cryptic locations -
first time ever posting online!)
My knowledge of astrology is minimal, nevertheless I could see the
uranus square MC right now; I would like to figure out more if
possible.

Thanks very much in advance!

I'm not sure if I can help BUT I think it would help if you could
clarify a few things.
First, you were born in Moscow on the fifth day of September 1972 but
at what time? Is that 8:30 AM or PM? Was there a Daylight Savings time
change (similar to British Summer Time) instituted in Soviet Russia at
that time?
Also, you currently work in Glasgow, Scotland. Do you also live
there? This information would be useful to someone who might do a
relocation chart for you.

Vinnie, M Zimmermann's TOB is "eighteen-thirty", not 8:30.  18:30
(universal time) = 6:30 PM.  The time zone given by SolarFire is BAT.

My best guess is you're referring to 18:30 locat time, as opposed to
18:30 universal time..  This would place transiting Uranus in square
with your MC, as you noted.

I see some other things going on, too.  For instance, Saturn and
Neptune are currently in opposition, and Neptune has been traveling
over your ascendant.  Meanwhile Uranus has been in opposition to your
natal 7th house Sun / Mars, as well as squaring your midheaven..

The Saturn / Neptune transit might be at it's worst right now, as it's
being activated by Mars.  It's influence will be lessening on a daily
basis.  Don't let confusion and frustration get the best of you.  You
put your faith in someone, but they weren't able to deliver  There are
other opportunities out there for someone with your keen mind, and no
doubt glowing qualifications.

Twenty years ago when I was your age, I was also working at a
university, in a non-teaching position.  I made a switch to the
regular business world and have done much better financially than I
would have if I'd stayed.  If your position doesn't improve during the
coming weeks, I would advise looking elsewhere.  I suspect things will
come to a head in the second half of April, and you'll know for sure
that it's time to leave.  Don't accept something new just to get away.
Take your time if you can afford to, and wait for something worthy of
your talents to present itself.  Years from now you'll realize this
was the best thing that could have happened.  It will set you on a new
and positive course for the future.

Thanks to everyone who replied. Yes, 18:30 was local time. And Ron you
are right about the second half of April when there should be some
sort of resolution to the matter.
