Kevin Warwick imagines a day when humans will speak to each other not in
words but in thought. A time when people will be able to upgrade their own
intelligence and even take vacations in faraway lands just by downloading
them directly to their brains.
To Warwick, this is no science-fiction fantasy. This is the reality of the
not-too-distant future - a time when humans have brain implants connecting
them to the vastly superior intellectual powers of computers.
He believes this cyborg evolution is inevitable and vital to our very
survival as a species.
&quot;If we don't, the alternative is to have intelligent machines running
everything. I don't really fancy that,&quot; the scientist says in a phone
interview from his home near London. &quot;But this alternative, I see as quite a
positive alternative: humans staying in control of what is going on, even
though we have to become cyborgs to do it.&quot;
His is not a lone voice in the wilderness.

The renowned Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking also believes humans need
an upgrade.
&quot;In contrast with our intellect, computers double their performance every 18
months,&quot; Hawking told the German news magazine Focus in 2001. &quot;So the danger
is real that they could develop intelligence and take over the world. We
must develop as quickly as possible technologies that make possible a direct
connection between brain and computer, so that artificial brains contribute
to human intelligence rather than opposing it.&quot;
Warwick, a cybernetics professor at the University of Reading in England, is
involved in ambitious and dangerous experiments in the quest to meld man and
machine.
In March 2002, an electrode was implanted in his wrist in order to read the
electrical signals pulsing through his nerves and report the information to
a computer, thus providing a link between the machine and his nervous
system.
The surgery was a success, although it could have proved fatal if the glass
enclosing the electrodes broke inside his body. The implant collected the
signals pulsing through nerves and transmitted them back to his computer.
The computer stored the transmissions but also, on occasion, replayed them -
sending signals directly into his central nervous system.
Then the following June, his wife Irena set out to join him. An electrode
was placed in her arm, then she was rushed to a lab at the university where
husband and wife both connected the wires running from their arms to
computers. A quick test showed the computers were picking up the signals
pulsing from their nervous systems. Warwick could hardly breath as he was
blindfolded and the computers were linked together. This is when he would
find out if his idea would fly: would they be able to telegraph messages
between their nervous systems?
He felt a sudden shock down his left index finger. He was startled,
surprised. &quot;Yes,&quot; he shouted. The pulses kept coming, one after another.
Others in the lab broke out in a chorus of cheers. Every time Irena closed
her hand, he would feel a charge. Her nervous system was talking to his -
the first-ever such link. Warwick was elated: his idea worked. It confirmed
that his dream of direct thought communication between humans could indeed
become real one day. It also gave hope to his vision of creating a
substitute nervous system for people who are paralysed.
The first time he tried something like this was more than two years before,
when a different silicon chip was implanted in his arm. This experiment was
less ambitious, but proved a chip inside the body could send signals. It
sent out radio waves alerting computers at the cybernetics department to his
actions and whereabouts. As he walked through the main doors of the
building, the computer welcomed him with a polite hello. As he neared his
lab, it opened the door and turned on the lights.
When that first implant was taken out nine days later, he felt strange,
oddly upset. He missed it. It felt like a friend had died. It was something
he had not at all expected: he had grown emotionally attached. The
husband-and-wife implants from this year's experiments have been removed
now, but Warwick makes it clear that these most recent experiments are just
the beginning. If electric signals coursing through our bodies can be
shared, he believes it is just a matter of time before we can command
computers with nothing but our thoughts, before our brains meld with the
power of future-generation PCs, before we start thinking to each other
instead of speaking.
He imagines a future experiment: he is in London, his wife in New York. With
her brain link on, her portable computer records a thought conversation,
sends it over the internet to his computer, which in turn dispatches it to
his brain. Her thoughts pop into his head.
&quot;The direction I am interested in ultimately is linking up to the human
brain: can we give people extra memory? Can we allow people to communicate
just by thinking to each other? My goal in life is to bring about thought
communication between people. That's what I would like to achieve.&quot;
He is convinced thought communication will be reality within the next two
decades. It may seem far fetched, but we are closer than you might think.
Scientists are making significant breakthroughs in getting computers to
interpret thought. In March 2002, the journal Nature detailed the work of
scientists at Brown University in Rhode Island who implanted electrodes in
the brains of monkeys that allowed the primates to move a computer cursor
just by thinking about it.
As surprising and revolutionary as this seems, scientists have had some
success with humans.
In Atlanta, researchers at Emory University have helped a man severely
disabled by a stroke communicate by having his brainwaves power a computer
cursor. Three years ago, a neurosurgeon implanted a pair of glass-encased
electrodes in Vietnam veteran John Ray's brain. The implant eavesdropped on
his brain activity and, together with sensors taped to the shoulder and
above the eyebrow reading the electrical activity of muscle contractions,
allowed him to slowly spell out words with the power of thought.
Scientists in Australia have developed a &quot;mind switch&quot; which allows people
to activate electrical devices - turn on a light, power up a radio - by
thinking. At a demonstration in England last year, its developers showed how
electrodes attached to the outside of the skull monitor brain activity and
turn on the appliances when the voltage of the signals reaches certain
levels.
Ashley Craig, a neuroscientist at the University of Technology, Sydney, who
helped develop the switch, says it is able to control any electrical device.
Disabled patients have been able to turn on the television and even switch
channels. Like other research looking at harnessing the power of the brain,
his experiments are aimed at improving the lives of the disabled.
In Canada, a team at the University of Victoria is working on a device that
it hoped would allow teenager Claire Minkley to use a computer by
brainwaves.
A rare affliction has left the 18-year-old in a wheelchair, unable to speak
and with little control over her muscles. Though incredibly smart, most of
her thoughts and feelings are locked inside her head - she communicates only
by pointing to letters and blocks on a board. The team began working on a
system of electrodes attached to headgear she could wear so that a computer
could interpret brain signals and translate them into words.
A pioneer in this area of research is John Chapin, director of the Center
for Neurorobotics and Neuroengineering at the State University of New York.
His focus is on having the brain instruct robotic limbs so that people who
are paralysed can one day regain function of their arms or legs. He is
hoping to devise a system that will allow limbs not only to respond to
thought commands, but to send sensory information back to the brain -
restoring the feeling of touch.
He agrees that it will be possible - at least in theory - for the human
brain and computers to link on a wide scale, that the technology will grow
beyond helping people with disabilities.
&quot;That being the case, whether or not it can ever really be done ethically or
technologically is a totally different story,&quot; he says, wondering aloud how
the brain would have to be wired up to talk to the computer. &quot;How many
electrodes do you need? You might need tens of thousands. You'd almost have
to wait for some sort of non-invasive technique to become available to do
that.&quot;
Michael Arbib, an expert in both computers and brain function, also wonders
about the practicality.
&quot;Will people want to have chips planted in their heads, just to have the
higher bandwidth? I don't know,&quot; says Arbib, a professor of computer science
and neuroscience at the University of Southern California and the author of
more than 20 books, including Computers and the Cybernetic Society.
&quot;That's why you've got ethical discussions. But we do accept a lot of
intrusions now - first we had glasses, then we had contact lenses, now we're
having surgery on the lens of the eye itself.&quot;
So, why not brain implants?
Arbib believes it is possible for the brain to drive technology, that
someday we may indeed be able to drive just by thinking. &quot;The question is,
in the long run, is it really worthwhile monitoring the brain and having to
develop special skills to come up with the right thought patterns for all
these different machines? Or is it easier to simply come up with voice
control and have you simply say what you want?&quot;
Kevin Warwick concedes some people think he is crazy, but that hardly
dampens his drive. He thinks of others who have achieved what was once
thought impossible, such as the American aviator Charles Lindbergh, who in
1927 was first to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.
He has spent his adult life devoted to researching artificial intelligence
and robotics.
When he casts his mind to the decades to come, he envisions a society where
humans wire themselves with extra brain power by co-opting the computer, and
take on new senses such as X-ray vision or ultrasound radar just by adopting
the technological wizardry.
He sees a time when medicine is electronic - pain relievers,
anti-depressants and the like are pieces of software you download onto the
brain. Indeed, he has already had inquiries wondering if it would be
possible to program a virtual high - instead of snorting cocaine, call up
the program.
From there, it's easy to imagine immersing yourself in the adventure of an
exotic vacation without leaving the living room. Connect a computer to a
your brain port and let it feed you the experience instead, or perhaps let
it transport you to a different reality much as Keanu Reeves's character
experienced in The Matrix.
While Warwick worries that machines may conquer man if we don't become part
machine, he is not concerned that computers will end up taking over if we do
team up with them.
&quot;The new system that we move to is essentially an intelligent machine
network that has human nodes connected to it. I see it as if you are not
connected to the network - if you are not a cyborg - you're not part of it
at all.&quot;
He sees an era ending and feels &quot;a little bit nostalgic for humans&quot;. He also
sees a new one dawning where there must be progress or we could very well be
doomed to a future where humans are inferior - and robots rule.
&quot;We can't say it is not possible. For me, this is an alternative: if you
can't beat them, join them.&quot;
