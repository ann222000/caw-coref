Children eat more in larger groups, study finds 45 minutes ago

PARIS (AFP) - Children who eat in large groups may consume nearly a
third more than when they are in small groups, a finding that sheds
light on the problem of child obesity, a study says.

University of Michigan researchers assessed the eating habits of 54
pre-school children aged between two and a half and six and a half.

Accompanied by their regular classroom teachers, but discreetly filmed
by two cameras, the children were given a snack of wholewheat biscuits
and offered a drink of milk, juice or water.

A plate of biscuits was put on each table, and the children could help
themselves.

Two snack-eating sessions were carried out -- with the children in
groups of three and again, in groups of nine.

No time limit was set for the sessions. The children had a routine
whereby when each had finished their snack, they left the table and
returned to their classroom. As a result, the session time varied,
ranging from 10 to 15 minutes.

After each session, the researchers went over the film to see how much
each child had eaten and weighed the amount of any food left on the
child's plate.

If the snack time was relatively short, the children ate slightly more
in a group of nine than when they were in a group of three.

But if the snack time was long, they ate almost 30 percent more on
average in the larger group than when they were in the smaller group.

Social arousal -- noise and group activity -- are the likely drivers
for the higher consumption, say the authors, led by Julie Lumeng of
the university's Center for Human Growth and Development.

This implies that having a peaceful, structured environment for
eating, with a small number of people at the table, can be a good way
of encouraging children to eat sensibly.

"The child who eats inadequate quantities may consume more when eating
in a group (e.g. with the family at the table for a planned mealtime)
than when eating alone, as often occurs when children graze over the
course of the day," Lumeng says.

"For the child who overeats, overconsumption may be driven by having
meals in over-stimulating busy or chaotic environments, as is often
the case when eating out, particularly at fast-food restaurants."

The study appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a journal of
the British Medical Association (BMA).

Interesting study, but it may be just another very small, almost
insignificant factor. What I notice is that some kids eat everything
in sight and want more, while others, (the skinny ones) never eat all
their food and have no compunction to leave large quantities of it on
their plates. These kids just don't seem to get all that hungry and
they fill up faster. My 10-year old is an example. She says she's
really hungry, then proceeds to eat about 300 calories and says she's
stuffed. She is also thin. Â Perhaps the idea of being satisfied is
where the real difference lies. I know a nurse who lets her kids eat
as little or much as they like. The whole family is skinny though.
They often don't seem to eat a balanced meal either, but they are all
healthy far as I can tell. I don't really know if the mother throws
the leftovers away, but I think she does. This must be partly genetic
too with both kids skinny and both parents thin in their 40s. dkw

Skinny on the outside doesn't mean healthy on the inside(heart, liver,
kidneys, etc...)
