Forgotten behind its high walls, one of Europe's most important
19th-century Jewish cemeteries, now dilapidated, desperately awaits
salvation after years of indifference on the part of Viennese
authorities.

VIENNA (AFP) - Over 7,000 graves dating from 1784 to 1874 when Austria
was at the height of the industrial revolution, are facing total ruin
in Vienna's Waehring cemetery, worn as they are by time, overrun with
weeds and sometimes vandalised.

&quot;It is a jewel unequalled in Central Europe. And look what has become
of it,&quot; said Austrian historian Tina Walzer, who has been trying for 15
years to save the site.
Past the heavy wooden gate, usually closed to visitors, the cemetery
recalls the jungle-invaded Cambodian temple of Angkor Wat.
At the foot of hundred-year-old linden trees, thousands of
Biedermeier-style tombs have been overrun by weeds, giving the place an
almost surreal feeling.
&quot;If nothing is done very quickly, the damage will be irreparable,&quot;
Walzer said.
A few sections cleared out by volunteers led by the historian point to
the cemetery's historic significance: here rest the Jewish masters of
finance, industry and railroads who helped the Austrian economy take
off in the 19th century.
Beautiful Ashkenazi graves of polished granite, adorned with epitaphs
in German, or more rarely in Hebrew, compete with more Oriental-looking
tombs that are unique north of the Alps, according to Walzer.
&quot;These are the tombs of Sephardis from the Ottoman Empire, who were
allowed to settle in Vienna following an agreement with the Sublime
Porte (the Ottoman court),&quot; she added.
Although some 2,000 tombs were destroyed under the Nazis and about 200
others were violated and the bodies transferred to Vienna's Natural
History museum, where they disappeared, the cemetery was spared the
systematic rampage that was perpetrated elsewhere under the Third Reich.
Instead, it is now being neglected by the Austrian state, although the
latter is responsible for maintaining and preserving all Jewish
cemeteries under an agreement signed in Washington in 2001.

&quot;Unlike Germany, which very early accepted its responsibilities towards
the Jewish community (after the Holocaust), Austria is struggling to
come to terms with its past. The current situation flows from that,&quot;
said the head of Vienna's Israeli community IKG, Raimund Fastenbauer.
The alliance of conservatives and the far right that was in power until
January also explains why the state was for so long unwilling to do
anything, Vienna's Deputy Mayor Renate Brauner, a Social Democrat,
added.
&quot;The city of Vienna called on the State several times to shoulder its
reponsibilities, but in vain,&quot; she told AFP.
Things could soon change. In mid-July, Parliament President Barbara
Prammer, another Social Democrat, announced on a trip to Jerusalem that
preliminary studies would be launched in the autumn with a view to
beginning restoration work on the cemetery in &quot;two to three years.&quot;
Clearing and restoring the site, estimated to cost some 14 million
euros (19 million dollars), could take between six and ten years, she
added.
But Fastenbauer was cautious: &quot;The gesture is encouraging, but only
results matter: until now, declarations of this sort have had no
follow-up,&quot; he told AFP.
&quot;The Waehring cemetery does not need new studies, but immediate
measures,&quot; Walzer added.
