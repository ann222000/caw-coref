I know this is a very personal question and I don't expect exact
answers, but was really just curious what a java developers make these
days?  And I think this is probably the best forum to ask and I think
we could all benefit from knowing...

If I'm a senior java developer (Top 10% performer) with 10 years of
experience in software engineering and have lots of experience with
java web applications, spring, hibernate, struts, JSF, EJB, JEE...
What kind of salary range does everyone fit into or expect?

$90K - $100K

$100K - $110K

$110K - $120K

$120K - $130K

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; $130K
">

Then what's the career path after senior java developer?  architect?
management? technology evangelist?  What would their salary ranges be?

Part of this is going to depend on where in the country you
live. In Ohio people can expect $70k to $90k. If you are at
a big company like Kroger, Fidelity, or one of the insurance
companies, your pay will be lower. If you are at a smaller
company, the pay goes up because they have a harder time
attracting talent or don't have the bureaucracy that drives down
the amount they are willing to pay for talent.

In Seattle I made 30% more than I do in Ohio. I moved there
so my family could be near relatives. Although it sounds like
a big pay cut, once the bills are paid, I have money left over
for the fun stuff. In Seattle all my money went to living costs.

Ya, I'd expect some differences based on location.  I'm hoping that
people will reply and give input on their location and what someone
might expect.  I'm looking at making a move for a similar reason soon.

Where are you located and where do you want to go?

My wife looked at a calculator that showed NYC being 152%
higher in costs than Ohio. However, the salary difference was
only 18% higher. That doesn't give you much pizza money.

Brent. I would urge you to setup an anonymous quick poll of some kind
and link to it. I doubt many will answer your question based on the
fact that they are readily identified, I know I wont. ;)

Well I'm comparing Phoenix Arizona to Maryland.  According to
salary.com Maryland is 18% higher in cost of living then Arizona.

Casper, If I get the time maybe I will setup a poll, but I doubt I'll
have time... I'm not expecting people to answer exactly what they
make.  Only something like:

I live in AZ and most senior java developers make between 80K - 100K.

I'm also curious on what the potential salary range is for techies
like us...  Is 150K the top? or is 250K the top?  What does the top
people in our field make? (ie. Joshua Bloch, neil gafter, java posse
members, etc...)

Josh and Neil's salaries are immutable and cant be updated... now only
if they had used components... :) sorry.

&quot;The top&quot; is whatever someone is willing to pay, but generally I think
the dot com hysteria days are over.  You can make alot of money with a
You Tube but you have to make it successful first.

I found I could earn more money living in Sydney, but living expenses
were much higher than then difference to say Brisbane.  But I find
money less relevant than finding the right company for you with the
opportunities you want.  You more often find the prestigious companies
(ie. one people have heard of) in bigger cities.  Companies in smaller
cities may be ambitious but they may not have the right connections
that help them be successful.  But there are no rules about such
things.

My brisbane career was quite ordinary until I moved to Sydney.  The
start up I worked for moved in next door to Sybase.  Before you knew
it were were contracting to California and sold our payment gateway to
ANZ.  We were then purchased by ANZ, then EFD, then Fidelity
National.  We are now problem solvers for a multi billion dollar
company and next week I'm off to Philadelphia.  I couldn't see that
happening if I'd stayed in Brisbane.

Actually, my comments about big companies in big cities may not be so
relevant to the US.  In Australia, Sydney and Melbourne are the only
&quot;real cities&quot;.  Everything gravitates there.  I did notice the US had
a more practical approach of not trying to shove everything of
importance within the &quot;North Sydney CBD&quot;.

in London a good, experienced Java Developer outside the banking sector can
get anywhere between £45-55k($88,000 - 107,000).

The banking sector tends to pay more, about £65k plus bonus ($127,000).

We also have &quot;contractors&quot; - slef emplyed workers on 3-6 month contracts.
The average for them is about £400 per day outside banking, £500 inside and
they can bring home roughly 70% of that.

It mind sound alot, but its very expensive living in London!!! I had my
cousins come over from Iowa this xmas and they could not believe how much we
pay in living costs.

Do you work in the banking sector, and if so would you say the stress
and extra work was worth the extra money?

no, I don't work in the banking sector but i know people who do. The
stress/extra money is ok if you are not interested in work/life balance ie
no wife/kids.

I'd say this is in the ball park for London.  Depending on what you
are doing and how good you are, contractor rates can be up to £600 /
day in banking.

but of course they can be updated if they're immutable, we only need to
