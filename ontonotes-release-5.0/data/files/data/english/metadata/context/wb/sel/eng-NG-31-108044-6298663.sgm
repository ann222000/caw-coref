I have currently have 3 4th Edition Gurps books - Campaigns,
Charicters, and Magic,  And I am setting up 2 online campains that I
will be GMing, one will be a Fantasy, and the other will be the "tramp
steamer in space" style campaign.   Now I have a good idea of what I
want to do with space (traveler but in a more harder SF setup.) So is
it worth buying GURPS space, or should I just take what I have in 3ed
Traveler and modify it for 4th edition?

GURPS Space has a world generation system that is probably more
"realistic" than that of Traveller and certainly more detailed if you
do the full generation instead of the basic (fleshing out the whole
system and including world details like axial tilt, orbit times, day
length and frequency of earthquakes).   And you generate much higher
gravity world than the maximum in Traveller, although they're rare
when randomly generated.  It also has a really nifty random alien
generator, animals and people.  Between the two of them, they dominate
the book.  I can't say whether that would be worth it for you.

I haven't seen Space 4e (no FLGS for 120 miles), but I do own GURPS
Traveller: First In, which has advanced system generation rules and a
random alien generator. I strongly suspect that Space 4e drew heavily
from the systems in GT:FI, so if GT:FI is one of the GT books he owns,
Space 4e becomes much less useful.

Also, worth noting that Space 4e contains _no_ starship design system.

That was very deliberate.  "Space" covers everything from crunchy-hard

hours to trade blaster shots with the forces of Warlord Krugg.  It

Space is about the conventions of a campaign set in space, oddly
enough. The two big rules sections that are needed for that sort of
genre - worlds and aliens - are handled extremely well.

I've used the advanced world generation system from GURPS Traveller:
First In perhaps once. Same for the random crature generation. While
they look good, neither are as useful as rules for starship
construction and combat.

Space 4e makes a very wrong-headed assumption that everyone wants
maximum detail on worlds and don't care about how they travel between
them.

Not very well.  I prefer the model taken this time, with loose
discussions of technology and their implications in a space-based
campign, rather than the nuts and bolts, which belongs in a different
book.

Hell, I've never seen the need for excessive detailing of starships
anyway.  They're devices to advance the story.  Your ship can cover
.87ly a day, is lightly armed, and has x-cubic meters of cargo space.
Star Trek did very well with only the slimmest actual details of how
the Enterprise worked.

In many campaigns, a spaceship is an adventure location; even more
commonly, it's a home base. The PCs will spend a lot of time there,
and the GM will often want adventure scenes to play out on board the
ship, or on board other ships.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Star Trek did very well with only the slimmest actual details of how
&gt; the Enterprise worked.
">

Yet there were also many episodes set largely on board the ship, and
it's a hugely common trope of the genre.

If the adventure calls for the PCs to roam around a ship -- ours,
theirs or disputed -- as a scene in the adventure, you need to
convince them they're *on the ship*. A keyed deck plan then becomes
just as important as any other keyed adventure map.

If the PCs use the ship as a mobile home base, the players are going
to be interested in knowing what goes where. Even if no adventure
scenes are planned on board, it's very helpful to the players'
imagination to be able to picture the place they inhabit.

I'm with Douglas here, the new 4e trend of "genre" books (Fantasy,
Space), that are very sparse on commitments to particular settings,
dovetails nicely with the all-about-one-setting books (Banestorm,
Interstellar Wars).

I'm glad that the material in the book called "Space" is broadly
applicable to a great range of settings, rather than having a sizeable
portion of the book dedicated to material far more specific than the
rest.

It seems to me that people are mostly annoyed because, in spite of the
plentiful commentary online about how the 4e genre books are *not*
complete replacements for the 3e books of the same name, these people
still have a strong expectation from the 3e book contents.

The only way to avoid that would be to release these books with
*different* names; but I don't think that's worth the price. With SJG
publishing a book that's all about the multitude of Space campaigns
with the GURPS system, and nothing about any particular setting, I
don't want that book called anything else but "GURPS Space".

If anything, this just shows that the equivalent books for 3e were the
ones with the mismatched title-to-content.

Yes but nobody randomly generates starships.  In the end the GM has to
set what ships are available with only a few minor modular variations.
The great thing about randomly generating worlds and aliens is that it
is very inspirational.  I think of new possible plotlines even as I do
it.  I _could_ just say "OK, the world around Tau Ceti has a

Well there is nolonger going to be a 4e GURPS Vehicles it could do the

A ship design system lets you know, roughly, how much space is taken

Actually, I think the problem is slightly different.

One of the lessons that SJG learned from 3e is that when you really
need new rules or new systems, multiple authors will develop them
independently, and they'll be incompatible.  People don't like that.
The alternative is developing them once and then duplicating them, and
people *really* don't like that.  So one of the decisions they made
for 4e was that all the rules for vehicle construction would be in one
place, all the rules for high-tech weaponry would be in one place, and
so on.  This makes a lot of sense, and solves the two problems they
were trying to avoid.

But what they didn't anticipate was the production speed.  They wrote
Space with the idea that the rules for building starships would be in
a later Vehicles supplement and the rules for high-tech weapons would
be in a later Ultra-Tech supplement.  Unfortunately, there are no
announced Vehicles supplements that I know of, and Ultra-Tech is not
quite out yet.

(My own solution is to Make Stuff Up, but that annoys people who want
to run a long campaign and don't want to have to retcon everything
in 2 years when official stats are published.)

I don't think it's possible for a world not to be usable.  Some aren't

where you can't figure out how that combination of traits could work
together, but I don't find it common.  But all worlds are usable.

True but there are no real details there.  Most of the time somebody would
walk into the Turbolift, grab the handle, and say something like "Deck 12",
"Sickbay", "Engineering", or "Shuttle Bay" and off they went.

Furthermore while there were a good number of episodes set onboard they
were very limited in scope.  Even in "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"
wherea Bele chases Lokai through the ship all that they really see is just
one curving coridor after another.

And how many rules did he need to draw up the floorplan?

Let me tell you about floorplans.  Traveller, arguably, is home to the
most anal-retentive mob of gear heads in gaming.  I know, because I am
one.  We are talking about people who love to pull out their Texas
Insturments scientific calculator because the party *might* need a
hovercraft. And we will design everything down to the last litre of
space and watt of power.

And with all that I have never seen a set of Traveller deckplans that
can within 10% of the actual volume of the craft they purported to map
out. The worst offender was the Marava-Class Far Trader, which should
have named the TARDIS-class!

None of it mattered in the heat of the game. And that was the
beginning of my... not quite conversion from gear-heading, but my
realization of its proper place.

Take the Enterpise.  We knew it had a bridge, a shuttle bay, and
engineering control room, sickbay, some cargo holds, at least one mess
hall, and that the crew had individual staterooms.  Later, we learned
that the ship was riddled with access tubes and that there was a
bowling alley somewhere onboard!  All of these things were connected
by a smart set of turbo lifts that not only respinded to voice
commands, but recognized who was allowed in secure areas (at least I
hope the bridge wasn't open to every yahoo Enginnering Tech/3rd with a
complaint!) We had a vague idea where all these things were.  Picture
the following gaming sessions..

GM: "The Klingons take advantage of the monetary shield flutter,
they've beamed a team into Engineering."

Player 1: "Captain, they've frozen out the turbo lifts!"

Player 2: (To GM) "Is there another way to get to engineering?"

GM: "Sure, just let me get out my detail maps of every level between
you and engineering!" *THUD* "Could you move the pizza? Thanks.  OK,
behind the communications station is a crawlspace, which leads to a
Jeffries tube..."

*or*

to get to engineering."

Player 3: "Captain, I suggest that a more cautious route would be
logical"

Player 2: "Good point. We're going to head down to engineering, but
take it slow and careful."

Maps have their place, as does detailing.  I just don't let either
take over the flow of the game.

As far as I know, 4ed Vehicles hasn't been written yet, so there's no
way to tell what it may or may not have in it once it's ready to go to
playtest.  Have patience...

OTOH, there is going to be a Vehicle Design System book which will be
released on e23, and possibly (probably?) as a Print On Demand (POD). VDS is
currently somewhere in the editing stage AFAIK.

CW&gt; -- WTF?

The plan that has been mentioned repeatedly is that GURPS Vehicles
will be stats for vehicles, and GURPS Vehicle Design will be a system
of rules for designing vehicles.  The goal here is that people who
want a book of stats for cars won't have to buy umpty-hundred pages of
crunch when what they want to know is how fast it goes, how hard it is
to damage with bullets, and how much weight it can carry, while people
who want gearhead crunch can buy a book chock full of it for their
delectation.

Of course, titles and plans may change up until the minute the book is
in your hands, and nobody at SJG has publicly committed to a schedule
for either book.

IMHO this is not true.   For the most part in a story a vehicle is at
best a plot device whose performance and abilities has more to do what
the writer needs it to do rather than anything in reality.

Having come into the hobby from tactical level wargaming, overdetail
and number-crunching are part of the experience for me.

Besides, "Vehicles will lack rules for desgining vehicles.", at least
on first reading, sounds like something out of WEG's "Paranoia."

GMs can get away with a lot.  Even in 'realistic' settings the GM just has
to apply a little common sense.  For example if the setting in WWI you are
not going to see any 200 mph aircraft and likely not any 150 mph either
unless they are *very* cutting edge.

Only in that a writer has totally control over *all* the characters unless
it is a retelling of a RPG (Lodoss War for example).  Also if a writer goes
too far afield in handling characters they don't tend to do well.  This is
more apparent with long established characters than 'one shots'.  For
example Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a stage play where Holmes was so OOC
that it bombed and so he turned it into what is generally regarded as the
worse story in the canon: The Mazarin Stone.  Marvel did something just as
bad with Spiderman and the Clone Saga.

Additionally most RPGs have cinematic elements in them where GMs have to
'fudge' the die rolls so the PCs don't become stains on the landscape just
because they rolled bad (as opposed to doing something out right stupid)
